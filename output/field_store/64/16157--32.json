That which  shameth the good, gratifieth the wicked! Alas, moved by ignorance and  passion and slaves of their own senses, even fools perform many acts of  (apparent merit) to gratify in after-life their appetites! With eyes  open are these men led astray by their seducing senses, even as a  charioteer, who hath lost his senses, by restive and wicked steeds! When  any of the six senses findeth its particular object, the desire  springeth up in the heart to enjoy that particular object. And thus when  one's heart proceedeth to enjoy the objects of any particular sense a  wish is entertained which in its turn giveth birth to a resolve. And  finally, like unto an insect falling into a flame from love of light,  the man falleth into the fire of temptation, pierced by the shafts of  the object of enjoyment discharged by the desire constituting the seed  of the resolve! And thenceforth blinded by sensual pleasure which he  seeketh without stint, and steeped in dark ignorance and folly which he  mistaketh for a state of happiness, he knoweth not himself! And like  unto a wheel that is incessantly rolling, every creature, from ignorance  and deed and desire, falleth into various states in this world,  wandering from one birth to another, and rangeth the entire circle of  existences from a _Brahma_ to the point of a blade of grass, now in  water, now on land, and now against in the air!    \"'This then is the career of those that are without knowledge. Listen  now to the course of the wise they that are intent on profitable virtue,  and are desirous of emancipation! The _Vedas_ enjoin act but _renounce_  (interest in) action. Therefore, shouldst thou act, renouncing  _Abhimana_,[5] performance of sacrifices, study (of the _Vedas_), gifts,  penance, truth (in both speech and act), forgiveness, subduing the  senses, and renunciation of desire,--these have been declared to be the  eight (cardinal) duties constituting the true path. Of these, the four  first pave the way to the world of the _pitris_. And these should be  practised without _Abhimana_. The four last are always observed by the  pious, to attain the heaven of the gods. And the pure in spirit should  ever follow these eight paths. Those who wish to subdue the world for  purpose of salvation, should ever act fully renouncing motives,  effectually subduing their senses, rigidly observing particular vows,  devotedly serving their preceptors, austerely regulating their fare,  diligently studying the _Vedas_, renouncing action as mean and  restraining their hearts. By renouncing desire and aversion the gods  have attained prosperity. It is by virtue of their wealth of yoga[6]  that the _Rudras_, and the _Sadhyas_, and the _Adityas_ and the _Vasus_,  and the twin _Aswins_, rule the creatures. Therefore, O son of Kunti,  like unto them, do thou, O Bharata, entirely refraining from action with  motive, strive to attain success in _yoga_ and by ascetic austerities.  Thou hast already achieved such success so far as thy debts to thy  ancestors, both male and female concerned, and that success also which  is derived from action (sacrifices). Do thou, for serving the regenerate  ones endeavour to attain success in penances. Those that are crowned  with ascetic success, can, by virtue of that success, do whatever they  list; do thou, therefore, practising asceticism realise all thy  wishes.'\"        [5] Reference to self, i.e. without the motive of bettering      one's own self, or without any motive at all. (This contains the      germ of the doctrine preached more elaborately in the _Bhagavad      gita_.)        [6] This _Yoga_ consists, in their case, of a combination of      attributes by negation of the contrary ones, i.e. by      renunciation of motives in all they do.      SECTION III    Vaisampayana said, \"Yudhishthira the son of Kunti, thus addressed by  Saunaka, approached his priest and in the midst of his brothers said,  'The Brahmanas versed in the _Vedas_ are following me who am departing  for the forest. Afflicted with many calamities I am unable to support  them. I cannot abandon them, nor have I the power to offer them  sustenance: Tell me, O holy one, what should be done by me in such a  pass.'\"    Vaisampayana said, \"After reflecting for a moment seeking to find out  the (proper) course by his _yoga_ powers, Dhaumya, that foremost of all  virtuous men, addressed Yudhishthira, in these words, 'In days of old,  all living beings that had been created were sorely afflicted with  hunger. And like a father (unto all of them), _Savita_ (the sun) took  compassion upon them. And going first into the northern declension, the  sun drew up water by his rays, and coming back to the southern  declension, stayed over the earth, with his heat centered in himself.  And while the sun so stayed over the earth, the lord of the vegetable  world (the moon), converting the effects of the solar heat (vapours)  into clouds and pouring them down in the shape of water, caused plants  to spring up. Thus it is the sun himself, who, drenched by the lunar  influence, is transformed, upon the sprouting of seeds, into holy  vegetable furnished with the six tastes. And it is these which  constitute the food of all creatures upon the earth. Thus the food that  supporteth the lives of creatures is instinct with solar energy, and the  sun is, therefore, the father of all creatures. Do thou, hence, O  Yudhishthira, take refuge even in him. All illustrious monarchs of pure  descent and deeds are known to have delivered their people by practising  high asceticism. The great Karttavirya, and Vainya and Nahusha, had all,  by virtue of ascetic meditation preceded by vows, delivered their people  from heavy afflictions. Therefore, O virtuous one, as thou art purified  by the acts do thou likewise, entering upon a file of austerities. O  Bharata, virtuously support the regenerate ones.'\"    Janamejaya said, \"How did that bull among the Kurus, king Yudhishthira,  for the sake of the Brahmanas adore the sun of wonderful appearance?\"    Vaisampayana said, \"Listen attentively, O king, purifying thyself and  withdrawing thy mind from every other thing. And, O king of kings,  appoint thou a time. I will tell thee everything in detail, And, O  illustrious one, listen to the one hundred and eight names (of the sun)  as they were disclosed of old by Dhaumya to the high-souled son of  Pritha. Dhaumya said, 'Surya, Aryaman, Bhaga, Twastri, Pusha, Arka,  Savitri, Ravi, Gabhastimat, Aja, Kala, Mrityu, Dhatri, Prabhakara,  Prithibi, Apa, Teja, Kha, Vayu, the sole stay, Soma, Vrihaspati, Sukra,  Budha, Angaraka, Indra, Vivaswat, Diptanshu, Suchi, Sauri, Sanaichara,  Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Skanda, Vaisravana, Yama, Vaidyutagni,  Jatharagni, Aindhna, Tejasampati, Dharmadhwaja, Veda-karttri, Vedanga,  Vedavahana, Krita, Treta, Dwapara, Kali, full of every impurity, Kala,  Kastha, Muhurtta, Kshapa, Yama, and Kshana; Samvatsara-kara, Aswattha,  Kalachakra, Bibhavasu, Purusha, Saswata, Yogin, Vyaktavyakta, Sanatana,  Kaladhyaksha, Prajadhyaksha, Viswakarma, Tamounda, Varuna, Sagara, Ansu,  Jimuta, Jivana, Arihan, Bhutasraya, Bhutapati, Srastri, Samvartaka,  Vanhi, Sarvadi, Alolupa, Ananta, Kapila, Bhanu, Kamada, Sarvatomukha,  Jaya, Visata, Varada, Manas, Suparna, Bhutadi, Sighraga, Prandharana,  Dhanwantari, Dhumaketu, Adideva, Aditisuta, Dwadasatman, Aravindaksha,  Pitri, Matri, Pitamaha, Swarga-dwara, Prajadwara, Mokshadwara,  Tripistapa, Dehakarti, Prasantatman, Viswatman, Viswatomukha,  Characharatman, Sukhsmatman, the merciful Maitreya. These are the  hundred and eight names of Surya of immeasurable energy, as told by the  self-create (Brahma). For the acquisition of prosperity, I bow down to  thee, O Bhaskara, blazing like unto gold or fire, who is worshipped of  the gods and the _Pitris_ and the Yakshas, and who is adored by Asuras,  Nisacharas, and Siddhas. He that with fixed attention reciteth this hymn  at sunrise, obtaineth wife and offspring and riches and the memory of  his former existence, and by reciting this hymn a person attaineth  patience and memory. Let a man concentrating his mind, recite this hymn.  By doing so, he shall be proof against grief and forest-fire and ocean  and every object of desire shall be his.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Having heard from Dhaumya these words suitable  to the occasion, Yudhishthira the just, with heart concentrated within  itself and purifying it duly, became engaged in austere meditation,  moved by the desire of supporting the Brahmanas. And worshipping the  maker of day with offerings of flowers and other articles, the king  performed his ablutions. And standing in the stream, he turned his face  towards the god of day. And touching the water of the Ganges the  virtuous Yudhishthira with senses under complete control and depending  upon air alone for his sustenance, stood there with rapt soul engaged in  _pranayama_.[7] And having purified himself and restrained his speech,  he began to sing the hymn of praise (to the sun).    \"Yudhishthira said, 'Thou art, O sun, the eye of the universe. Thou art  the soul of all corporeal existences. Thou art the origin of all things.  Thou art the embodiment of the acts of all religious men. Thou art the  refuge of those versed in the _Sankhya_ philosophy (the mysteries of the  soul), and thou art the support of the _Yogins_. Thou art a door  unfastened with bolts. Thou art the refuge of those wishing for  emancipation. Thou sustainest and discoverest the world, and sanctifiest  and supportest it from pure compassion. Brahmanas versed in the _Vedas_  appearing before thee, adore thee in due time, reciting the hymns from  the respective branches (of the _Vedas_) they refer. Thou art the adored  of the _Rishis_.

Pandu has five sons, who are called Pandavas after him,  while Dhritarashtra has a hundred sons called Kauravas after Kuru, their  common grandfather. As children the two families grow up at the same  court, but almost immediately jealousies arise which are to have a deadly  outcome. Hatred begins when in boyish contests the Pandavas outdo the  Kauravas. The latter resent their arrogance and presently their father,  the blind king, is persuaded to approve a plot by which the five Pandavas  will be killed. They are to sleep in a house which during the night will  be burnt down. The plot, however, miscarries. The house is burnt, but  unbeknown to the Kauravas, the five brothers escape and taking with them  their mother, Kunti, go for safety to the forest. Here they wander for a  while disguised as Brahmans or priests but reach at last the kingdom of  Panchala. The King of Panchala has a daughter, Draupadi, whose husband is  to be chosen by a public archery competition. Arjuna, one of the five  brothers, wins the contest and gains her as bride. The Pandavas, however,  are polyandrous and thus, on being married to one brother, Draupadi is  also married to the other four. At the wedding the Pandavas disclose their  identities. The Kauravas learn that they are still alive and in due course  are reconciled. They reinstate the Pandavas and give them half the  kingdom. Before Arjuna, however, can profit from the truce, he infringes  by accident his elder brother's privacy by stumbling on him while he is  with their common wife. As a consequence he violates a standing agreement  and has no alternative but to go into exile for twelve years. Arjuna  leaves the court, visits other lands, acquires a new wife and makes a new  alliance. In other respects, all is well and the two families look forward  to many years of peaceful co-existence.    The fates, however, seem determined on their destruction. The leader of  the Pandavas is their eldest brother, Yudhisthira. He conquers many other  lands and is encouraged to claim the title, 'ruler of the world.' The  claim is made at a great sacrifice accompanied by a feast. The claim  incenses the Kauravas and once again the ancient feud revives. Themselves  expert gamblers, they challenge Yudhisthira to a contest by dice.  Yudhisthira stupidly agrees and wagering first his kingdom, then his  brothers and finally his wife, loses all and goes again into exile. With  him go the other Pandavas, including Arjuna who has since returned. For  twelve years they roam the forests, brooding on their fate and planning  revenge. When their exile ends, they at once declare war. Both sides seek  allies, efforts at peacemaking are foiled and the two clash on the  battle-field of Kurukshetra. For eighteen days the battle rages till  finally the Pandavas are victorious. Their success, however, is at an  appalling cost. During the contest all five Pandavas lose their sons. The  hundred sons of their rival, the blind king Dhritarashtra, are dead and  with a sense of tragic futility, the epic ends.    It is as an actor in this tangled drama that Krishna appears. Alongside  the Pandavas and the Kauravas in Northern India is a powerful people, the  Yadavas. They live by grazing cattle but possess towns including a  capital, the city of Dwarka in Western India. At this capital resides  their ruler or king and with him is a powerful prince, Krishna. This  Krishna is related to the rival families, for his father, Vasudeva, is  brother of Kunti, the Pandavas' mother. From the outset, therefore, he is  placed in intimate proximity to the chief protagonists. For the moment,  however, he himself is not involved and it is only after the Pandavas have  gone into exile and reached the kingdom of Panchala that he makes his  entrance. The occasion is the archery contest for the hand of Draupadi.  Krishna is there as an honoured guest and when Arjuna makes the winning  shot, he immediately recognizes the five Pandavas as his kinsmen although  as refugees they are still disguised as Brahmans. When the assembled  princes angrily protest at Draupadi's union with a Brahman, and seem about  to fight, Krishna intervenes and persuades them to accept the decision.  Later he secretly meets the Pandavas and sends them wedding presents.  Already, therefore, he is fulfilling a significant role. He is a powerful  leader, a relative of the central figures and if only because the feud is  not his own, he is above the conflict and to some extent capable of  influencing its outcome.    His next appearance brings him closer still to the Pandavas. When Arjuna  is exiled for his breach of marriage etiquette, he visits Krishna in his  city of Dwarka. A great festival is held and in the course of it Arjuna  falls in love with Krishna's sister, Subhadra. Krishna favours the  marriage but advises Arjuna to marry her by capture. Arjuna does so and by  becoming Krishna's brother-in-law cements still further their  relationship.    This friendship has one further consequence, for, after Arjuna has  completed his exile and returned to the Pandava court, Krishna visits him  and the two go into the country for a picnic. 'After a few days, Arjuna  said to Krishna, \"The summer days have come. Let us go to the River Jumna,  amuse ourselves with some friends and come back in the evening.\" Krishna  replied, \"I would like that very much. Let us go for a bathe.\" So Arjuna  and Krishna set out with their friends. Reaching a fine spot fit for  pleasure and overgrown with trees, where several tall houses had been  built, the party went inside. Food and wine, wreaths of flowers and  fragrant perfumes were laid out and at once they began to frolic at their  will. The girls in the party with delightful rounded haunches, large  breasts and handsome eyes began to flirt as Arjuna and Krishna commanded.  Some played about in the woods, some in the water, some inside the houses.  And Draupadi and Subhadra who were also in the party gave the girls and  women costly dresses and garments. Then some of them began to dance, some  to sing, some laughed and joked, some drank wine. And the houses and  woods, filled with the noise of flutes and drums, became the very seat of  pleasure.'[6]    A little later, Krishna is accorded special status. At the sacrifice  performed by Yudhisthira as 'ruler of the world,' gifts of honour are  distributed. Krishna is among the assembled guests and is proposed as  first recipient. Only one person objects, a certain king Sisupala, who  nurses a standing grievance against him. A quarrel ensues and during it  Krishna kills him. Krishna's priority is then acclaimed but the incident  serves also to demonstrate his ability as a fighter.    One other aspect of Krishna's character remains to be noted. Besides being  a bold warrior, he is above all an astute and able ally. During the  Pandavas' final exile in the forest, he urges them to repudiate their  banishment and make war. When the exile is over and war is near, he acts  as peace-maker, urging the Kauravas to make concessions. When he is foiled  by Duryodhana, the blind king's son, he attempts to have him kidnapped.  Finally, once the great battle is joined, he offers both sides a choice.  Each may have the help either of himself alone or of his immediate  kinsmen, the Vrishnis. The Vrishnis will fight in the battle, while  Krishna himself will merely advise from a distance. The Kauravas choose  the fighters, the Pandavas Krishna. Krishna accordingly aids the Pandavas  with counsel. He accompanies Arjuna as his charioteer and during the  battle is a constant advocate of treachery. As Kama, a leading Kaurava,  fights Arjuna, his chariot gets stuck and he dismounts to see to it. The  rules of war demand that Arjuna should now break off but Krishna urges him  to continue and Kama is killed unresisting. Similarly when Bhima, one of  the five Pandava brothers, is fighting Duryodhana with his club, Krishna  eggs him on to deal a foul blow. Bhima does so and Duryodhana dies from a  broken thigh. In all these encounters, Krishna shows himself completely  amoral, achieving his ends by the very audacity of his means.    So far, Krishna's character is merely that of a feudal magnate, and there  is nothing in his views or conduct to suggest that he is Vishnu or God.  Two incidents in the epic, however, suddenly reveal his true role. The  first is when Yudhisthira has gambled away Draupadi and the Kauravas are  intent on her dishonour. They attempt to make her naked. As one of them  tries to remove her clothes, Draupadi beseeches Krishna as Vishnu to  intervene and save her. Krishna does so and by his help she remains  clothed; however many times her dress is removed. The second occasion is  on the final battle-field of Kurukshetra. Arjuna, seeing so many brothers,  uncles and cousins ranged on either side is moved to pity at the senseless  nature of the strife and confides his anguished doubts in Krishna. Krishna  seems, at first, to be only his friend, his brother-in-law and adviser. He  points out that to a warrior nothing is nobler than a righteous war and  declares, 'Do your duty always but without attachment.' He then advocates  the two paths of _yoga_(knowledge) and _dharma_ (righteousness). 'Even if  a man falls away from the practice of _yoga_, he will still win the heaven  of the doers of good deeds and dwell there many long years. After that, he  will be reborn into the home of pure and prosperous parents. He will then  regain that spiritual discernment which he acquired in his former body;  and so he will strive harder than ever for perfection. Because of his  practices in the previous life, he will be driven on toward union with the  Spirit, even in spite of himself. For the man who has once asked the way  to the Spirit goes farther than any mere fulfiller of the Vedic rituals.  By"]]]
