You will be  tried at once.\"    It was in vain for the prisoners to protest. Matters were carried with  a high hand. They were allowed a spokesman, and Captain Weston, who  understood Spanish, was selected, that language being used. But the  defense was a farce, for he was scarcely listened to. Several officers  testified before the admiral, who was judge, that they had seen the  submarine rise out of the water, almost under the prow of the San  Paulo. It was assumed that the Advance had tried to wreck the warship,  but had failed. It was in vain that Captain Weston and the others told  of the reason for their rapid ascent from the ocean depths--that Mr.  Swift had been shocked, and needed fresh air. Their story was not  believed.    \"We have heard enough!\" suddenly exclaimed the admiral.  \"The evidence  against you is over-whelming--er--what you Americans call conclusive,\"  and he was speaking then in broken English. \"I find you guilty, and the  sentence of this court-martial is that you be shot at sunrise, three  days hence!\"    \"Shot!\" cried Captain Weston, staggering back at this unexpected  sentence. His companions turned white, and Mr. Swift leaned against his  son for support.    \"Bless my stars! Of all the scoundrelly!\" began Mr. Damon.    \"Silenceo!\" shouted the lieutenant, waving his sword.    \"You will be shot,\" proceeded the admiral. \"Is not that the verdict of  the honorable court?\" he asked, looking at his fellow officers. They  all nodded gravely.    \"But look here!\" objected Captain Weston. \"You don't dare do that! We  are citizens of the United States, and--\"    \"I consider you no better than pirates,\" interrupted the admiral. \"You  have an armed submarine--a submarine with torpedo tubes. You invade our  harbor with it, and come up almost under my ship. You have forfeited  your right to the protection of your country, and I have no fear on  that score. You will be shot within three days. That is all.  Remove  the prisoners.\"    Protests were in vain, and it was equally useless to struggle. The  prisoners were taken out on deck, for which they were thankful, for the  interior of the ship was close and hot, the weather being intensely  disagreeable. They were told to keep within a certain space on deck,  and a guard of sailors, all armed, was placed near them. From where  they were they could see their submarine floating on the surface of the  little bay, with several Brazilians on the small deck. The Advance had  been anchored, and was surrounded by a flotilla of the native boats,  the brown-skinned paddlers gazing curiously at the odd craft.    \"Well, this is tough luck!\" murmured Tom. \"How do you feel, dad?\"    \"As well as can be expected under the circumstances,\" was the reply.  \"What do you think about this, Captain Weston?\"    \"Not very much, if I may be allowed the expression,\" was the answer.    \"Do you think they will dare carry out that threat?\" asked Mr. Sharp.    The captain shrugged his shoulders. \"I hope it is only a bluff,\" he  replied, \"made to scare us so we will consent to giving up the  submarine, which they have no right to confiscate. But these fellows  look ugly enough for anything,\" he went on.    \"Then if there's any chance of them attempting to carry it out,\" spoke  Tom, \"we've got to do something.\"    \"Bless my gizzard, of course!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"But what? That's  the question. To be shot! Why, that's a terrible threat! The villains--\"    \"Silenceo!\" shouted Lieutenant Drascalo, coming up at that moment.          Chapter Twenty-One    The Escape      Events had happened so quickly that day that the gold-hunters could  scarcely comprehend them. It seemed only a short time since Mr. Swift  had been discovered lying disabled on the dynamo, and what had  transpired since seemed to have taken place in a few minutes, though it  was, in reality, several hours. This was made manifest by the feeling  of hunger on the part of Tom and his friends.    \"I wonder if they're going to starve us, the scoundrels?\" asked Mr.  Sharp, when the irate lieutenant was beyond hearing. \"It's not fair to  make us go hungry and shoot us in the bargain.\"    \"That's so, they ought to feed us,\" put in Tom. As yet neither he nor  the others fully realized the meaning of the sentence passed on them.    From where they were on deck they could look off to the little island.  From it boats manned by natives were constantly putting off, bringing  supplies to the ship. The place appeared to be a sort of calling  station for Brazilian warships, where they could get fresh water and  fruit and other food.    From the island the gaze of the adventurers wandered to the submarine,  which lay not far away. They were chagrined to see several of the  bolder natives clambering over the deck.    \"I hope they keep out of the interior,\" commented Tom. \"If they get to  pulling or hauling on the levers and wheels they may open the tanks and  sink her, with the Conning tower open.\"    \"Better that, perhaps, than to have her fall into the hands of a  foreign power,\" commented Captain Weston.  \"Besides, I don't see that  it's going to matter much to us what becomes of her after we're--\"    He did not finish, but every one knew what he meant, and a grim silence  fell upon the little group.    There came a welcome diversion, however, in the shape of three sailors,  bearing trays of food, which were placed on the deck in front of the  prisoners, who were sitting or lying in the shade of an awning, for the  sun was very hot.    \"Ha! Bless my napkin-ring!\" cried Mr. Damon with something of his  former gaiety. \"Here's a meal, at all events. They don't intend to  starve us. Eat hearty, every one.\"    \"Yes, we need to keep up our strength,\" observed Captain Weston.    \"Why?\" inquired Mr. Sharp.    \"Because we're going to try to escape!\" exclaimed Tom in a low voice,  when the sailors who had brought the food had gone. \"Isn't that what  you mean, captain?\"    \"Exactly. We'll try to give these villains the slip, and we'll need all  our strength and wits to do it. We'll wait until night, and see what we  can do.\"    \"But where will we escape to?\" asked Mr. Swift. \"The island will afford  no shelter, and--\"    \"No, but our submarine will,\" went on the sailor.    \"It's in the possession of the Brazilians,\" objected Tom.    \"Once I get aboard the Advance twenty of those brown-skinned villains  won't keep me prisoner,\" declared Captain Weston fiercely. \"If we can  only slip away from here, get into the small boat, or even swim to the  submarine, I'll make those chaps on board her think a hurricane has  broken loose.\"    \"Yes, and I'll help,\" said Mr. Damon.    \"And I,\" added Tom and the balloonist.    \"That's the way to talk,\" commented the captain. \"Now let's eat, for I  see that rascally lieutenant coming this way, and we mustn't appear to  be plotting, or he'll be suspicious.\"    The day passed slowly, and though the prisoners seemed to be allowed  considerable liberty, they soon found that it was only apparent. Once  Tom walked some distance from that portion of the deck where he and the  others had been told to remain. A sailor with a gun at once ordered him  back. Nor could they approach the rails without being directed, harshly  enough at times, to move back amidships.    As night approached the gold-seekers were on the alert for any chance  that might offer to slip away, or even attack their guard, but the  number of Brazilians around them was doubled in the evening, and after  supper, which was served to them on deck by the light of swinging  lanterns, they were taken below and locked in a stuffy cabin. They  looked helplessly at each other.    \"Don't give up,\" advised Captain Weston. \"It's a long night. We may be  able to get out of here.\"    But this hope was in vain. Several times he and Tom, thinking the  guards outside the cabin were asleep, tried to force the lock of the  door with their pocket-knives, which had not been taken from them. But  one of the sailors was aroused each time by the noise, and looked in  through a barred window, so they had to give it up. Slowly the night  passed, and morning found the prisoners pale, tired and discouraged.  They were brought up on deck again, for which they were thankful, as in  that tropical climate it was stifling below.    During the day they saw Admiral Fanchetti and several of his officers  pay a visit to the submarine. They went below through the opened  conning tower, and were gone some time.    \"I hope they don't disturb any of the machinery,\" remarked Mr. Swift.  \"That could easily do great damage.\"    Admiral Fanchetti seemed much pleased with himself when he returned  from his visit to the submarine.    \"You have a fine craft,\" he said to the prisoners. \"Or, rather, you had  one. My government now owns it. It seems a pity to shoot such good boat  builders, but you are too dangerous to be allowed to go.\"    If there had been any doubt in the minds of Tom and his friends that  the sentence of the court-martial was only for effect, it was dispelled  that day. A firing squad was told off in plain view of them, and the  men were put through their evolutions by Lieutenant Drascalo, who had  them load, aim and fire blank cartridges at an imaginary line of  prisoners. Tom could not repress a shudder as he noted the leveled  rifles, and saw the fire and smoke spurt from the muzzles.    \"Thus we shall do to you at sunrise to-morrow,\" said the lieutenant,  grinning, as he once more had his men practice their grim work.    It seemed hotter than ever that day. The sun was fairly broiling, and  there was a curious haziness and stillness to the air. It was noticed  that the sailors on the San Paulo were busy making fast all loose  articles on deck with extra lashings, and hatch coverings were doubly  secured.    \"What do you suppose they are up to?\" asked Tom of Captain Weston.    \"I think it is coming on to blow,\" he replied, \"and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/95"],[0,"The Prisoner of Zenda (#20)"],[1,"which marked  it, without more public notice being directed to it. Duels were frequent  among all the upper classes, and private quarrels between great men  kept the old habit of spreading to their friends and dependents.  Nevertheless, after the affray which I have just related, such reports  began to circulate that I felt it necessary to be on my guard. The death  of the gentlemen involved could not be hidden from their relatives. I  issued a stern order, declaring that duelling had attained unprecedented  licence (the Chancellor drew up the document for me, and very well he  did it), and forbidding it save in the gravest cases. I sent a public  and stately apology to Michael, and he returned a deferential and  courteous reply to me; for our one point of union was--and it underlay  all our differences and induced an unwilling harmony between our  actions--that we could neither of us afford to throw our cards on the  table. He, as well as I, was a \"play-actor\", and, hating one another, we  combined to dupe public opinion. Unfortunately, however, the necessity  for concealment involved the necessity of delay: the King might die  in his prison, or even be spirited off somewhere else; it could not be  helped. For a little while I was compelled to observe a truce, and  my only consolation was that Flavia most warmly approved of my edict  against duelling, and, when I expressed delight at having won her  favour, prayed me, if her favour were any motive to me, to prohibit the  practice altogether.    \"Wait till we are married,\" said I, smiling.    Not the least peculiar result of the truce and of the secrecy which  dictated it was that the town of Zenda became in the day-time--I would  not have trusted far to its protection by night--a sort of neutral zone,  where both parties could safely go; and I, riding down one day with  Flavia and Sapt, had an encounter with an acquaintance, which presented  a ludicrous side, but was at the same time embarrassing. As I rode  along, I met a dignified looking person driving in a two-horsed  carriage. He stopped his horses, got out, and approached me, bowing low.  I recognized the Head of the Strelsau Police.    \"Your Majesty's ordinance as to duelling is receiving our best  attention,\" he assured me.    If the best attention involved his presence in Zenda, I determined at  once to dispense with it.    \"Is that what brings you to Zenda, Prefect?\" I asked.    \"Why no, sire; I am here because I desired to oblige the British  Ambassador.\"    \"What's the British Ambassador doing _dans cette galere_?\" said I,  carelessly.    \"A young countryman of his, sire--a man of some position--is missing.  His friends have not heard from him for two months, and there is reason  to believe that he was last seen in Zenda.\"    Flavia was paying little attention. I dared not look at Sapt.    \"What reason?\"    \"A friend of his in Paris--a certain M. Featherly--has given us  information which makes it possible that he came here, and the officials  of the railway recollect his name on some luggage.\"    \"What was his name?\"    \"Rassendyll, sire,\" he answered; and I saw that the name meant nothing  to him. But, glancing at Flavia, he lowered his voice, as he went on:  \"It is thought that he may have followed a lady here. Has your Majesty  heard of a certain Madame de Mauban?\"    \"Why, yes,\" said I, my eye involuntarily travelling towards the Castle.    \"She arrived in Ruritania about the same time as this Rassendyll.\"    I caught the Prefect's glance; he was regarding me with enquiry writ  large on his face.    \"Sapt,\" said I, \"I must speak a word to the Prefect. Will you ride on  a few paces with the princess?\" And I added to the Prefect: \"Come, sir,  what do you mean?\"    He drew close to me, and I bent in the saddle.    \"If he were in love with the lady?\" he whispered. \"Nothing has been  heard of him for two months;\" and this time it was the eye of the  Prefect which travelled towards the Castle.    \"Yes, the lady is there,\" I said quietly. \"But I don't suppose Mr.  Rassendyll--is that the name?--is.\"    \"The duke,\" he whispered, \"does not like rivals, sire.\"    \"You're right there,\" said I, with all sincerity. \"But surely you hint  at a very grave charge?\"    He spread his hands out in apology. I whispered in his ear:    \"This is a grave matter. Go back to Strelsau--\"    \"But, sire, if I have a clue here?\"    \"Go back to Strelsau,\" I repeated. \"Tell the Ambassador that you have a  clue, but that you must be left alone for a week or two. Meanwhile, I'll  charge myself with looking into the matter.\"    \"The Ambassador is very pressing, sir.\"    \"You must quiet him. Come, sir; you see that if your suspicions are  correct, it is an affair in which we must move with caution. We can have  no scandal. Mind you return tonight.\"    He promised to obey me, and I rode on to rejoin my companions, a little  easier in my mind. Enquiries after me must be stopped at all hazards for  a week or two; and this clever official had come surprisingly near the  truth. His impression might be useful some day, but if he acted on it  now it might mean the worse to the King. Heartily did I curse George  Featherly for not holding his tongue.    \"Well,\" asked Flavia, \"have you finished your business?\"    \"Most satisfactorily,\" said I. \"Come, shall we turn round? We are almost  trenching on my brother's territory.\"    We were, in fact, at the extreme end of the town, just where the hills  begin to mount towards the Castle. We cast our eyes up, admiring the  massive beauty of the old walls, and we saw a cortege winding slowly  down the hill. On it came.    \"Let us go back,\" said Sapt.    \"I should like to stay,\" said Flavia; and I reined my horse beside hers.    We could distinguish the approaching party now. There came first two  mounted servants in black uniforms, relieved only by a silver badge.  These were followed by a car drawn by four horses: on it, under a  heavy pall, lay a coffin; behind it rode a man in plain black clothes,  carrying his hat in his hand. Sapt uncovered, and we stood waiting,  Flavia keeping by me and laying her hand on my arm.    \"It is one of the gentlemen killed in the quarrel, I expect,\" she said.    I beckoned to a groom.    \"Ride and ask whom they escort,\" I ordered.    He rode up to the servants, and I saw him pass on to the gentleman who  rode behind.    \"It's Rupert of Hentzau,\" whispered Sapt.    Rupert it was, and directly afterwards, waving to the procession to  stand still, Rupert trotted up to me. He was in a frock-coat, tightly  buttoned, and trousers. He wore an aspect of sadness, and he bowed with  profound respect. Yet suddenly he smiled, and I smiled too, for old  Sapt's hand lay in his left breast-pocket, and Rupert and I both guessed  what lay in the hand inside the pocket.    \"Your Majesty asks whom we escort,\" said Rupert. \"It is my dear friend,  Albert of Lauengram.\"    \"Sir,\" said I, \"no one regrets the unfortunate affair more than I. My  ordinance, which I mean to have obeyed, is witness to it.\"    \"Poor fellow!\" said Flavia softly, and I saw Rupert's eyes flash at her.  Whereat I grew red; for, if I had my way, Rupert Hentzau should not  have defiled her by so much as a glance. Yet he did it and dared to let  admiration be seen in his look.    \"Your Majesty's words are gracious,\" he said. \"I grieve for my friend.  Yet, sire, others must soon lie as he lies now.\"    \"It is a thing we all do well to remember, my lord,\" I rejoined.    \"Even kings, sire,\" said Rupert, in a moralizing tone; and old Sapt  swore softly by my side.    \"It is true,\" said I. \"How fares my brother, my lord?\"    \"He is better, sire.\"    \"I am rejoiced.\"    \"He hopes soon to leave for Strelsau, when his health is secured.\"    \"He is only convalescent then?\"    \"There remain one or two small troubles,\" answered the insolent fellow,  in the mildest tone in the world.    \"Express my earnest hope,\" said Flavia, \"that they may soon cease to  trouble him.\"    \"Your Royal Highness's wish is, humbly, my own,\" said Rupert, with a  bold glance that brought a blush to Flavia's cheek.    I bowed; and Rupert, bowing lower, backed his horse and signed to his  party to proceed. With a sudden impulse, I rode after him. He turned  swiftly, fearing that, even in the presence of the dead and before a  lady's eyes, I meant him mischief.    \"You fought as a brave man the other night,\" I said. \"Come, you are  young, sir. If you will deliver your prisoner alive to me, you shall  come to no hurt.\"    He looked at me with a mocking smile; but suddenly he rode nearer to me.    \"I'm unarmed,\" he said; \"and our old Sapt there could pick me off in a  minute.\"    \"I'm not afraid,\" said I.    \"No, curse you!\" he answered. \"Look here, I made you a proposal from the  duke once.\"    \"I'll hear nothing from Black Michael,\" said I.    \"Then hear one from me.\" He lowered his voice to a whisper. \"Attack the  Castle boldly. Let Sapt and Tarlenheim lead.\"    \"Go on,\" said I.    \"Arrange the time with me.\"    \"I have such confidence in you, my lord!\"    \"Tut! I'm talking business now. Sapt there and Fritz will fall; Black  Michael will fall--\"    \"What!\"    \"--Black Michael will fall, like the dog he is; the prisoner, as you  call him, will go by 'Jacob's Ladder'--ah, you know that!--to hell! Two  men will be left--I, Rupert Hentzau, and you, the King of Ruritania.\"    He paused, and then, in a voice that quivered with eagerness, added:    \"Isn't that a hand to play?--a throne and your princess! And for me, say  a competence and your Majesty's gratitude.\"    \"Surely,\" I exclaimed, \"while you're above ground, hell wants its  master!\"    \"Well, think it over,\" he said. \"And, look you, it would take more than  a scruple or two to keep me from yonder girl,\" and his evil eye flashed  again at her I loved.    \"Get out of my reach!\" said I; and yet in a moment I began to laugh for  the very audacity of it.    \"Would you turn against your master?\""]]]
