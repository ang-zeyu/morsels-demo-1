RETTING    The method of separating the bast layer (in which the fibres are  embedded) from the stem of the plant requires a large supply of water,  since the plants must be completely submerged in the water for a  period varying from 8 to 30 days; such time is dependent upon the  period of the year and upon the district in which the operation is  performed.    The above operation of detaching the bast layer from the stem is  technically known as \"retting,\" and a good type of retting or  steeping place is an off-set of a run, branch, or stream where the  water moves slowly, or even remains at rest, during the time the  plants are under treatment.    The disintegration of the structural part of the plant is due to a  bacterial action, and gas is given off during the operation. The  farmer, or ryot, and his men know what progress the action is making  by the presence of the air bells which rise to the surface; when the  formation of air bells ceases, the men examine the plants daily to  see that the operation does not go too far, otherwise the fibrous  layer would be injured, and the resulting fibre weak. The stems are  tested in these examinations to see if the fibrous layer, or bast  layer, will strip off clean from the wood or stem. When the ryot  considers that the layers are separated from the core sufficiently  easy, the work of steeping ceases, and the process of stripping is  commenced immediately. This latter process is conducted in various  ways depending upon the practice in vogue in the district.      In one area the men work amongst the water breaking up the woody  structure of the retted plants by means of mallets and cross rails  fixed to uprights in the water; others break the stems by hand;  while in other cases the stems are handed out of the water to women  who strip off the fibrous layer and preserve intact the central core  or straw to be used ultimately for thatching. The strips of fibre  are all cleaned and rubbed in the water to remove all the vegetable  impurities, and finally the fibre is dried, usually by hanging it  over poles and protecting it from the direct rays of the sun.    If the water supply is deficient in the vicinity where the plants  are grown, it may be advantageous to convey the fibrous layers to  some other place provided with a better supply of water for the  final washing and drying; imperfect retting and cleaning are apt to  create defects in the fibre, and to cause considerable trouble or  difficulties in subsequent branches of the industry.    Fig. 3 illustrates photomicrographs of cross sections of a jute plant.  The lower illustration represents approximately one quarter of a  complete cross section. The central part of the stem or pith is  lettered A; the next wide ring B is the woody matter; the outer  covering or cuticle is marked C; while the actual fibrous layer  appears between the parts B and C, and some of the fibres are  indicated by D. The arrows show the corresponding parts in the three  distinct views. The middle illustration shows an enlarged view of a  small part of the lowest view, while the upper illustration is a  further enlarged view of a small section of the middle view. It will  be seen that each group of fibres is surrounded by vegetable matter.    [Illustration: FIG. 3 PHOTOMICROGRAPHS OF CROSS SECTIONS OF A JUTE  PLANT]    Another method of stripping the fibrous layer off the stems or stalks,  and one which is practised in certain districts with the object of  preserving the straws, consists in breaking off a small portion, say  one foot, at the top end of the stem; the operative then grasps the  tops by the hand and shakes the plants to and fro in the water, thus  loosening the parts, after which the straws float out, leaving the  fibrous layer free. The straws are collected for future use, while the  fibre is cleaned and washed in the usual way.          CHAPTER IV.  ASSORTING AND BALING JUTE FIBRE    The Indian raw jute trade is conducted under various conditions. The  method of marketing may be of such a nature that the farmers in some  districts may have to make a rough assortment of the fibre into a  number of qualities or grades, and these grades are well known in  the particular areas; on the other hand, the farmers may prefer to  sell the total yield of fibre at an overhead price per maund. A  maund is approximately equal to 8 lbs., and this quantity forms a  comparatively small bundle. In other cases, the fibre is made up into  what is known as a \"drum\"; this is a hand-packed bale of from 1 1/2  to 3 or 3 1/2 maunds; it is a very convenient size for transit in  India.    Practically one half of the total jute crop, of 9 to 10 million  bales of 400 lbs. each, is used in India, and the remaining half is  baled for export to the various parts of the world; a little over  one million bales are exported annually to Great Britain, the bulk  of this fibre comes to Dundee.    It is practically impossible for foreign purchasers to see the  material at the assorting stations, but the standardized method of  assorting and grading enables a purchaser to form a very good idea  of the quality of the fibre, and its suitability or otherwise for  special types of yarn and cloth. Thus, a form of selecting and  grading has been established on a basis that provides a very large  amount of jute each year of a quality which is known as \"a first mark.\"  A mark, in general, in reference to fibre, is simply some symbol,  name, letter, monogram or the like, or a combination of two or  more, oft-times with reference to some colour, to distinguish the  origin of the fibre, the baler, or the merchant.    In normal years there is also a large quantity of fibre of a better  quality than what is known as \"first mark,\" and this better quality  is termed \"fine jute\"; while there is yet a further lot, the quality  of which is below these good ones. Since there are hundreds of  different marks which are of value only to those connected directly  with the trade, it is unnecessary to dwell on the subject. The  following list, however, shows quotations of various kinds, and is  taken from the Market Report of the Dundee Advertiser of March, 1920.  The price of jute, like almost everything else, was at this date  very high, so in order to make comparisons with the 1920 and normal  prices, we introduce the prices for the corresponding grade, first  marks, for the same month in the years 1915 onwards.           JUTE PRICES, IN MARCH            First Marks       Year.       Price per ton.               L. s. d.

After these assorting operations are completed, the jute fibre is  made up into bundles or \"bojahs\" of 200 lbs. each, and two of these  200 lb. bundles are subsequently made up into a standard bale, the  weight of which is 400 lbs. This weight includes a permitted  quantity of binding rope, up to 6 lbs. in weight, while the  dimensions in the baling press of the 400 lb. bale are 4'1\" X 1'6\" X 1'  4\".    [Illustration: FIG. 4 NATIVES CARRYING SMALL BALES OF JUTE FIBRE  FROM BOAT TO PRESS HOUSE]    Large quantities of the smaller and loosely-packed bales are  conveyed from the various places by boats to the baling houses or  press houses as they are termed. These are very large establishments,  and huge staffs of operatives are necessary to deal rapidly and  efficiently with the large number of bales. In Fig. 4 scores of  natives, superintended by a European, are seen carrying the smaller  bales on their heads from the river boat to the press house. It is,  of course, unnecessary to make the solid 400 lb. bales for Indian  consumption; this practice is usually observed only for jute which  is to be exported, and all such bales are weighed and measured at  the baling station by a Chamber of Commerce expert.    Most of the baling presses used in the press houses in the Calcutta  district are made in Liverpool, and are provided with the most  efficient type of pumps and mechanical parts. Fig. 5 illustrates one  of these huge presses with a number of natives in close proximity.  Two or three distinct operations are conducted simultaneously by  different groups of operatives, and ingenious mechanism is essential  for the successful prosecution of the work. Two such presses as that  illustrated in Fig. 5 are capable, under efficient administration, of  turning out 130 bales of 400 lbs. each in one hour. The fibre is  compressed into comparatively small bulk by hydraulic pressure equal  to 6,000 lbs. per square inch, and no packed bale must exceed in  cubical capacity 11 cubic feet after it leaves the press; it is  usual for freight purposes to reckon 5 bales or 55 cubic feet per ton.  (Now changed to 50 cubic feet.)    The jute bales are loaded either at the wharf or in the river from  barges into large steamers, many of which carry from 30,000 to  46,000 bales in one cargo to the European ports. One vessel brought  70,000 bales.    As already mentioned, jute is sold under guarantees as to quality,  and all disputes must be settled by arbitration.  Although this is  the usual method of sale, it is not uncommon for quantities of jute  to be shipped unsold, and such quantities may be disposed of on the  \"Spot.\" It is a common practice to sell a number of bales to sample,  such number depending generally upon the extent of the quantity, or  \"parcel,\" as it is often called. The contract forms are very complete,  and enable the business to be conducted to the satisfaction of all  concerned in the trade.

Many a German was attracted thither, and not  without reason Heine hoped to find there a more promising field for  the employment of his talents than with all his wanderings he had  discovered in Germany. Toward the end of May, 1831, he arrived in  Paris, and Paris was thenceforth his home until his death on the  seventeenth of February, 1856.    II    In the preface to the second edition of the _Book of Songs_, written  at Paris in 1837, Heine confessed that for some time past he had felt  a certain repugnance to versification; that the poems therewith  offered for the second time to the public were the product of a time  when, in contrast to the present, the flame of truth had rather heated  than clarified his mind; and expressed the hope that his recent  political, theological, and philosophical writings--all springing from  the same idea and intention as the poems--might atone for any weakness  in the poems. Heine wrote poetry after 1831, and he wrote prose before  1831; but in a general way what he says of his two periods is correct:  before his emigration he was primarily a poet, and afterwards  primarily a critic, journalist, and popular historian. In his first  period he wrote chiefly about his own experiences; in his second,  chiefly about affairs past and present in which he was interested.    As to the works of the first period, we might hesitate to say whether  the _Pictures of Travel_ or the _Book of Songs_ were the more  characteristic product. In whichever way our judgment finally  inclined, we should declare that the _Pictures of Travel_ were  essentially prosified poems and that the poems were, in their  collected form, versified _Pictures of Travel_; and that both,  moreover, were dominated, as the writings after 1831 were dominated,  by a romantically tinged longing for individual liberty.    The title _Pictures of Travel_, to which Heine gave so definite a  connotation, is not in itself a true index to the multifarious  contents of the series of traveler's notes, any more than the volumes  taken each by itself were units. Pages of verse followed pages of  prose; and in the _Journey to the Hartz_, verse interspersed in prose  emphasizes the lyrical character of the composition. Heine does indeed  give pictures of some of the scenes that he visits; but he also  narrates his passage from point to point; and at every point he sets  forth his recollections, his thoughts, his dreams, his personal  reaction upon any idea that comes into his head; so that the  substance, especially of the _Journey to the Hartz_, is less what was  to be seen in the Hartz than what was suggested to a very lively  imagination; and we admire the agility with which the writer jumps  from place to place quite as much as the suppleness with which he can  at will unconditionally subject himself to the genius of a single  locality. For Heine is capable of writing straightforward descriptive  prose, as well-ordered and as matter-of-fact as a narrative of  Kleist's. But the world of reality, where everything has an assignable  reason for its being and doing, is not the world into which he most  delights to conduct us. This world, on the contrary, is that in which  the water \"murmurs and rustles so wonderfully, the birds pour forth  broken love-sick strains, the trees whisper as if with a thousand  maidens' tongues, the odd mountain flowers peep up at us as if with a  thousand maidens' eyes, stretching out to us their curious, broad,  drolly scalloped leaves; the sunrays flash here and there in sport,  the herbs, as though endowed with reason, are telling one another  their green legends, all seems enchanted\"--in other words, a  wonderland disturbed by no doubts on the part of a rationalistic  Alice. And a further secret of this fascinating, though in the long  run exasperating style, is the sublime audacity with which Heine  dances now on one foot and now on the other, leaving you at every  moment in amused perplexity, whether you shall next find him standing  firmly on mother earth or bounding upward to recline on the clouds.    \"A mixture of description of nature, wit, poetry, and observation a la  Washington Irving\" Heine himself called the _Journey to the Hartz_.  The novelty lay in the mixture, and in the fact that though the  ingredients are, so to speak, potentized in the highest degree, they  are brought to nearly perfect congruence and fusion by the  irresistible solvent of the second named. The _Journey to the Hartz_  is a work of wit, in the present sense, and in the older sense of  that word. It is a product of superior intelligence--not a _Sketch  Book_, but a single canvas with an infinitude of details; not a  _Sentimental Journey_--although Heine can outdo Sterne in  sentimentality, he too persistently outdoes him also in satire--the  work, fragmentary and outwardly formless, is in essence thoroughly  informed by a two-fold purpose: to ridicule pedantry and philistinism,  and to extol nature and the life of those uncorrupted by the world.    A similar unity is unmistakable in the _Book of Songs_. It would be  difficult to find another volume of poems so cunningly composed. If we  examine the book in its most obvious aspect, we find it beginning with  _Youthful Sorrows_ and ending with hymns to the North Sea; passing,  that is to say, from the most subjective to the most objective of  Heine's poetic expressions. The first of the _Youthful Sorrows_ are  _Dream Pictures_, crude and grotesque imitations of an inferior  romantic _genre_; the _North Sea Pictures_ are magnificent attempts in  highly original form to catch the elusive moods of a great natural  element which before Heine had played but little part in German  poetry. From the _Dream Pictures_ we proceed to _Songs_ (a very simple  love story told in forms as nearly conventional as Heine ever used),  to _Romances_ which, with the notable exception of _The Two  Grenadiers_ and _Belshazzar_, are relatively feeble attempts at the  objectivation of personal suffering; and thence to _Sonnets_, direct  communications to particular persons. Thereupon follow the _Lyrical  Intermezzo_ and the _Return Home_, each with a prologue and an  epilogue, and with several series of pieces which, like the _Songs_  above mentioned, are printed without titles and are successive  sentences or paragraphs in the poet's own love story. This he tells  over and over again, without monotony, because the story gains in  significance as the lover gains in experience, because each time he  finds for it a new set of symbols, and because the symbols become more  and more objective as the poet's horizon broadens. Then come a few  pieces of religious content (culminating in _The Pilgrimage to  Kevlaar_), the poems in the _Journey to the Hartz_ (the most striking  of which are animated by the poetry of folk-lore)--these poems clearly  transitional to the poetry of the ocean which Heine wrote with such  vigor in the two cycles on the North Sea. The movement is a steady  climax.    The truth of the foregoing observations can be tested only by an  examination of the entire _Book of Songs_. The total effect is one of  arrangement. The order of the sections is chronological; the order of  the poems within the sections is logical; and some poems were altered  to make them fit into the scheme. Each was originally the expression  of a moment; and the peculiarity of Heine as a lyric poet is his  disposition to fix a moment, however fleeting, and to utter a feeling,  of however slight consequence to humanity it might at first blush seem  to be. In the _Journey to the Hartz_ he never lost an opportunity to  make a point; in his lyrical confessions he suppressed no impulse to  self-revelation; and seldom did his mastery of form fail to ennoble  even the meanest substance.    Some of Heine's most perfect products are his smallest. Whether,  however, a slight substance can be fittingly presented only in the  briefest forms, or a larger matter calls for extended treatment, the  method is the same, and the merit lies in the justness and  suggestiveness of details. Single points, or points in juxtaposition  or in succession, not the developed continuity of a line, are the  means to the effect which Heine seeks. Connecting links are left to be  supplied by the imagination of the reader. Even in such a narrative  poem as _Belshazzar_ the movement is _staccato_; we are invited to  contemplate a series of moments; and if the subject is impiety and  swift retribution, we are left to infer the fact from the evidence  presented; there is neither editorial introduction nor moralizing  conclusion. Similarly with _The Two Grenadiers_, a presentation of  character in circumstance, a translation of pictorial details into  terms of action and prophecy; and most strikingly in _The Pilgrimage  to Kevlaar_, a poem of such fundamentally pictorial quality that it  has been called a triptych, three depicted scenes in a little  religious drama.    It is in pieces like these that we find Heine most successfully making  of himself the interpreter of objects in the outside world. The number  of such objects is greater than is everywhere believed--though  naturally his success is surest in the case of objects congenial to  him, and the variety of these is not great. Indeed, the outside world,  even when he appears to treat it most objectively, proves upon closer  examination to be in the vast majority of cases only a treasure-trove  of symbols for the expression of his inner self. Thus, _Poor Peter_ is  the narrative of a humble youth unfortunate in love, but poor Peter's  story is Heine's; otherwise, we may be sure, Heine would not have  thought it worth the telling. Nothing could seem to be less the  property of Heine than _The Lorelei_; nevertheless, he has given to  this borrowed subject so personal a turn that instead of the siren"]]]
