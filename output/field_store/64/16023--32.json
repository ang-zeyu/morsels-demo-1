It is  the most natural and most penetrating kind of logic; and I wish  merely to discharge a duty--\"    \"But you upset me, with that big sword of yours, you make me  nervous, and I cannot argue so long as you are flourishing it about.  Come now, put up your sword! Oh, what is anybody to do with you!  Here is the sheath for your sword,\" says she.    At this point they were interrupted.    \"Duke of Logreus,\" says the voice of Dame Anaitis, \"do you not think  it would be better to retire, before such antics at the door of my  bedroom give rise to a scandal?\"    For Anaitis had half-opened the door of her bedroom, and with a lamp  in her hand, was peering out into the narrow stairway. Jurgen was a  little embarrassed, for his apparent intimacy with a lady who had  been dead for sixty-three years would be, he felt, a matter  difficult to explain. So Jurgen rose to his feet, and hastily put up  the weapon he had exhibited to Queen Sylvia, and decided to pass  airily over the whole affair. And outside, a cock crowed, for it was  now dawn.    \"I bid you a good morning, Dame Anaitis,\" said Jurgen. \"But the  stairways hereabouts are confusing, and I must have lost my way. I  was going for a stroll. This is my distant relative Queen Sylvia  Tereu, who kindly offered to accompany me. We were going out to  gather mushrooms and to watch the sunrise, you conceive.\"    \"Messire de Logreus, I think you had far better go back to bed.\"    \"To the contrary, madame, it is my manifest duty to serve as Queen  Sylvia's escort--\"    \"For all that, messire, I do not see any Queen Sylvia.\"    Jurgen looked about him. And certainly his grandfather's ninth wife  was no longer visible. \"Yes, she has vanished. But that was to be  expected at cockcrow. Still, that cock crew just at the wrong  moment,\" said Jurgen, ruefully. \"It was not fair.\"    And Dame Anaitis said: \"Gogyrvan's cellar is well stocked: and you  sat late with Urien and Aribert: and doubtless they also were lucky  enough to discover a queen or two in Gogyrvan's cellar. No less, I  think you are still a little drunk.\"    \"Now answer me this, Dame Anaitis: were you not visited by two  ghosts to-night?\"    \"Why, that is as it may be,\" she replied: \"but the White Turret is  notoriously haunted, and it is few quiet nights I have passed there,  for Gogyrvan's people were a bad lot.\"    \"Upon my word,\" wonders Jurgen, \"what manner of person is this Dame  Anaitis, who remains unstirred by such a brutal murder as I have  committed, and makes no more of ghosts than I would of moths? I have  heard she is an enchantress, I am sure she is a fine figure of a  woman: and in short, here is a matter which would repay looking  into, were not young Guenevere the mistress of my heart.\"    Aloud he said: \"Perhaps then I am drunk, madame. None the less, I  still think the cock crew just at the wrong moment.\"    \"Some day you must explain the meaning of that,\" says she.  \"Meanwhile I am going back to bed, and I again advise you to do the  same.\"    Then the door closed, the bolt fell, and Jurgen went away, still in  considerable excitement.    \"This Dame Anaitis is an interesting personality,\" he reflected,  \"and it would be a pleasure, now, to demonstrate to her my grievance  against the cock, did occasion serve. Well, things less likely than  that have happened. Then, too, she came upon me when my sword was  out, and in consequence knows I wield a respectable weapon. She may  feel the need of a good swordsman some day, this handsome Lady of  the Lake who has no husband. So let us cultivate patience.  Meanwhile, it appears that I am of royal blood. Well, I fancy there  is something in the scandal, for I detect in me a deal in common  with this King Smoit. Twelve wives, though! no, that is too many. I  would limit no man's liaisons, but twelve wives in lawful matrimony  bespeaks an optimism unknown to me. No, I do not think I am drunk:  but it is unquestionable that I am not walking very straight.  Certainly, too, we did drink a great deal. So I had best go quietly  back to bed, and say nothing more about to-night's doings.\"    As much he did. And this was the first time that Jurgen, who had  been a pawnbroker, held any discourse with Dame Anaitis, whom men  called the Lady of the Lake.          18.    Why Merlin Talked in Twilight      It was two days later that Jurgen was sent for by Merlin Ambrosius.  The Duke of Logreus came to the magician in twilight, for the  windows of this room were covered with sheets which shut out the  full radiance of day. Everything in the room was thus visible in a  diffused and tempered light that cast no shadows. In his hand Merlin  held a small mirror, about three inches square, from which he raised  his dark eyes puzzlingly.    \"I have been talking to my fellow ambassador, Dame Anaitis: and I  have been wondering, Messire de Logreus, if you have ever reared  white pigeons.\"    Jurgen looked at the little mirror. \"There was a woman of the Leshy  who not long ago showed me an employment to which one might put the  blood of white pigeons. She too used such a mirror. I saw what  followed, but I must tell you candidly that I understood nothing of  the ins and outs of the affair.\"    Merlin nodded. \"I suspected something of the sort. So I elected to  talk with you in a room wherein, as you perceive, there are no  shadows.\"    \"Now, upon my word,\" says Jurgen, \"but here at last is somebody who  can see my attendant! Why is it, pray, that no one else can do so?\"    \"It was my own shadow which drew my notice to your follower. For I,  too, have had a shadow given me. It was the gift of my father, of  whom you have probably heard.\"    It was Jurgen's turn to nod. Everybody knew who had begotten Merlin  Ambrosius, and sensible persons preferred not to talk of the matter.  Then Merlin went on to speak of the traffic between Merlin and  Merlin's shadow.    \"Thus and thus,\" says Merlin, \"I humor my shadow. And thus and thus  my shadow serves me. There is give-and-take, such as is requisite  everywhere.\"    \"I understand,\" says Jurgen: \"but has no other person ever perceived  this shadow of yours?\"    \"Once only, when for a while my shadow deserted me,\" Merlin replied.  \"It was on a Sunday my shadow left me, so that I walked unattended  in naked sunlight: for my shadow was embracing the church-steeple,  where church-goers knelt beneath him. The church-goers were  obscurely troubled without suspecting why, for they looked only at  each other. The priest and I alone saw him quite clearly,--the  priest because this thing was evil, and I because this thing was  mine.\"    \"Well, now I wonder what did the priest say to your bold shadow?\"    \"'But you must go away!'--and the priest spoke without any fear. Why  is it they seem always without fear, those dull and calm-eyed  priests? 'Such conduct is unseemly. For this is High God's house,  and far-off peoples are admonished by its steadfast spire, pointing  always heavenward, that the place is holy,' said the priest. And my  shadow answered, 'But I only know that steeples are of phallic  origin.' And my shadow wept, wept ludicrously, clinging to the  steeple where church-goers knelt beneath him.\"    \"Now, and indeed that must have been disconcerting, Messire Merlin.  Still, as you got your shadow back again, there was no great harm  done. But why is it that such attendants follow some men while other  men are permitted to live in decent solitude? It does not seem quite  fair.\"    \"Perhaps I could explain it to you, friend, but certainly I shall not.  You know too much as it is. For you appear in that bright garment of  yours to have come from a land and a time which even I, who am a skilled  magician, can only cloudily foresee, and cannot understand at all. What  puzzles me, however\"--and Merlin's fore-finger shot out. \"How many feet  had the first wearer of your shirt? and were you ever an old man?\" says  he.    \"Well, four, and I was getting on,\" says Jurgen.    \"And I did not guess! But certainly that is it,--an old poet loaned  at once a young man's body and the Centaur's shirt. Aderes has  loosed a new jest into the world, for her own reasons--\"    \"But you have things backwards. It was Sereda whom I cajoled so  nicely.\"    \"Names that are given by men amount to very little in a case like  this. The shadow which follows you I recognize--and revere--as the  gift of Aderes, a dreadful Mother of small Gods. No doubt she has a  host of other names. And you cajoled her, you consider! I would not  willingly walk in the shirt of any person who considers that. But  she will enlighten you, my friend, at her appointed time.\"    \"Well, so that she deals justly--\" Jurgen said, and shrugged.    Now Merlin put aside the mirror. \"Meanwhile it was another matter  entirely that Dame Anaitis and I discussed, and about which I wished  to be speaking with you. Gogyrvan is sending to King Arthur, along  with Gogyrvan's daughter, that Round Table which Uther Pendragon  gave Gogyrvan, and a hundred knights to fill the sieges of this  table. Gogyrvan, who, with due respect, possesses a deplorable sense  of humor, has numbered you among these knights. Now it is rumored  the Princess is given to conversing a great deal with you in  private, and Arthur has never approved of garrulity. So I warn you  that for you to come with us to London would not be convenient.\"    \"I hardly think so, either,\" said Jurgen, with appropriate  melancholy; \"for me to pursue the affair any further would only  result in marring what otherwise will always be a perfect memory of  divers very pleasant conversations.\"    \"Old poet, you are well advised,\" said Merlin,--\"especially now that  the little princess whom we know is about to enter queenhood and  become a symbol. I am sorry for her, for she will be worshipped as a  revelation of Heaven's splendor, and being flesh and blood, she will  not like it.

Oh ill-starr'd folk,  Beyond all others wretched! who abide  In such a mansion, as scarce thought finds words  To speak of, better had ye here on earth  Been flocks or mountain goats.  As down we stood  In the dark pit beneath the giants' feet,  But lower far than they, and I did gaze  Still on the lofty battlement, a voice  Bespoke me thus: \"Look how thou walkest.  Take  Good heed, thy soles do tread not on the heads  Of thy poor brethren.\"  Thereupon I turn'd,  And saw before and underneath my feet  A lake, whose frozen surface liker seem'd  To glass than water.  Not so thick a veil  In winter e'er hath Austrian Danube spread  O'er his still course, nor Tanais far remote  Under the chilling sky.  Roll'd o'er that mass  Had Tabernich or Pietrapana fall'n,    Not e'en its rim had creak'd. As peeps the frog  Croaking above the wave, what time in dreams  The village gleaner oft pursues her toil,  So, to where modest shame appears, thus low  Blue pinch'd and shrin'd in ice the spirits stood,  Moving their teeth in shrill note like the stork.  His face each downward held; their mouth the cold,  Their eyes express'd the dolour of their heart.    A space I look'd around, then at my feet  Saw two so strictly join'd, that of their head  The very hairs were mingled.  \"Tell me ye,  Whose bosoms thus together press,\" said I,  \"Who are ye?\"  At that sound their necks they bent,  And when their looks were lifted up to me,  Straightway their eyes, before all moist within,  Distill'd upon their lips, and the frost bound  The tears betwixt those orbs and held them there.  Plank unto plank hath never cramp clos'd up  So stoutly.  Whence like two enraged goats  They clash'd together; them such fury seiz'd.    And one, from whom the cold both ears had reft,  Exclaim'd, still looking downward: \"Why on us  Dost speculate so long?  If thou wouldst know  Who are these two, the valley, whence his wave  Bisenzio slopes, did for its master own  Their sire Alberto, and next him themselves.  They from one body issued; and throughout  Caina thou mayst search, nor find a shade  More worthy in congealment to be fix'd,  Not him, whose breast and shadow Arthur's land  At that one blow dissever'd, not Focaccia,  No not this spirit, whose o'erjutting head  Obstructs my onward view: he bore the name  Of Mascheroni: Tuscan if thou be,  Well knowest who he was: and to cut short  All further question, in my form behold  What once was Camiccione.  I await  Carlino here my kinsman, whose deep guilt  Shall wash out mine.\"  A thousand visages  Then mark'd I, which the keen and eager cold  Had shap'd into a doggish grin; whence creeps  A shiv'ring horror o'er me, at the thought  Of those frore shallows.  While we journey'd on  Toward the middle, at whose point unites  All heavy substance, and I trembling went  Through that eternal chillness, I know not  If will it were or destiny, or chance,  But, passing 'midst the heads, my foot did strike  With violent blow against the face of one.    \"Wherefore dost bruise me?\" weeping, he exclaim'd,  \"Unless thy errand be some fresh revenge  For Montaperto, wherefore troublest me?\"    I thus: \"Instructor, now await me here,  That I through him may rid me of my doubt.  Thenceforth what haste thou wilt.\"  The teacher paus'd,  And to that shade I spake, who bitterly  Still curs'd me in his wrath.  \"What art thou, speak,  That railest thus on others?\"  He replied:  \"Now who art thou, that smiting others' cheeks  Through Antenora roamest, with such force  As were past suff'rance, wert thou living still?\"    \"And I am living, to thy joy perchance,\"  Was my reply, \"if fame be dear to thee,  That with the rest I may thy name enrol.\"    \"The contrary of what I covet most,\"  Said he, \"thou tender'st: hence; nor vex me more.  Ill knowest thou to flatter in this vale.\"    Then seizing on his hinder scalp, I cried:  \"Name thee, or not a hair shall tarry here.\"    \"Rend all away,\" he answer'd, \"yet for that  I will not tell nor show thee who I am,  Though at my head thou pluck a thousand times.\"    Now I had grasp'd his tresses, and stript off  More than one tuft, he barking, with his eyes  Drawn in and downward, when another cried,  \"What ails thee, Bocca?  Sound not loud enough  Thy chatt'ring teeth, but thou must bark outright?  What devil wrings thee?\"--\"Now,\" said I, \"be dumb,  Accursed traitor! to thy shame of thee  True tidings will I bear.\"--\"Off,\" he replied,  \"Tell what thou list; but as thou escape from hence  To speak of him whose tongue hath been so glib,  Forget not: here he wails the Frenchman's gold.  'Him of Duera,' thou canst say, 'I mark'd,  Where the starv'd sinners pine.'  If thou be ask'd  What other shade was with them, at thy side  Is Beccaria, whose red gorge distain'd  The biting axe of Florence.  Farther on,  If I misdeem not, Soldanieri bides,  With Ganellon, and Tribaldello, him  Who op'd Faenza when the people slept.\"    We now had left him, passing on our way,  When I beheld two spirits by the ice  Pent in one hollow, that the head of one  Was cowl unto the other; and as bread  Is raven'd up through hunger, th' uppermost  Did so apply his fangs to th' other's brain,  Where the spine joins it.  Not more furiously  On Menalippus' temples Tydeus gnaw'd,  Than on that skull and on its garbage he.    \"O thou who show'st so beastly sign of hate  'Gainst him thou prey'st on, let me hear,\" said I  \"The cause, on such condition, that if right  Warrant thy grievance, knowing who ye are,  And what the colour of his sinning was,  I may repay thee in the world above,  If that wherewith I speak be moist so long.\"          CANTO XXXIII    HIS jaws uplifting from their fell repast,  That sinner wip'd them on the hairs o' th' head,  Which he behind had mangled, then began:  \"Thy will obeying, I call up afresh  Sorrow past cure, which but to think of wrings  My heart, or ere I tell on't. But if words,  That I may utter, shall prove seed to bear  Fruit of eternal infamy to him,  The traitor whom I gnaw at, thou at once  Shalt see me speak and weep.  Who thou mayst be  I know not, nor how here below art come:  But Florentine thou seemest of a truth,  When I do hear thee.  Know I was on earth  Count Ugolino, and th' Archbishop he  Ruggieri.  Why I neighbour him so close,  Now list.  That through effect of his ill thoughts  In him my trust reposing, I was ta'en  And after murder'd, need is not I tell.  What therefore thou canst not have heard, that is,  How cruel was the murder, shalt thou hear,  And know if he have wrong'd me.  A small grate  Within that mew, which for my sake the name  Of famine bears, where others yet must pine,  Already through its opening sev'ral moons  Had shown me, when I slept the evil sleep,  That from the future tore the curtain off.  This one, methought, as master of the sport,  Rode forth to chase the gaunt wolf and his whelps  Unto the mountain, which forbids the sight  Of Lucca to the Pisan.  With lean brachs  Inquisitive and keen, before him rang'd  Lanfranchi with Sismondi and Gualandi.  After short course the father and the sons  Seem'd tir'd and lagging, and methought I saw  The sharp tusks gore their sides.  When I awoke  Before the dawn, amid their sleep I heard  My sons (for they were with me) weep and ask  For bread.  Right cruel art thou, if no pang  Thou feel at thinking what my heart foretold;  And if not now, why use thy tears to flow?  Now had they waken'd; and the hour drew near  When they were wont to bring us food; the mind  Of each misgave him through his dream, and I  Heard, at its outlet underneath lock'd up  The horrible tower: whence uttering not a word  I look'd upon the visage of my sons.  I wept not: so all stone I felt within.  They wept: and one, my little Anslem, cried:  \"Thou lookest so!  Father what ails thee?\"  Yet  I shed no tear, nor answer'd all that day  Nor the next night, until another sun  Came out upon the world.  When a faint beam  Had to our doleful prison made its way,  And in four countenances I descry'd  The image of my own, on either hand  Through agony I bit, and they who thought  I did it through desire of feeding, rose  O' th' sudden, and cried, 'Father, we should grieve  Far less, if thou wouldst eat of us: thou gav'st  These weeds of miserable flesh we wear,    'And do thou strip them off from us again.'  Then, not to make them sadder, I kept down  My spirit in stillness.  That day and the next  We all were silent.  Ah, obdurate earth!  Why open'dst not upon us?  When we came  To the fourth day, then Geddo at my feet  Outstretch'd did fling him, crying, 'Hast no help  For me, my father!'  There he died, and e'en  Plainly as thou seest me, saw I the three  Fall one by one 'twixt the fifth day and sixth:    \"Whence I betook me now grown blind to grope  Over them all, and for three days aloud  Call'd on them who were dead.  Then fasting got  The mastery of grief.\"  Thus having spoke,    Once more upon the wretched skull his teeth  He fasten'd, like a mastiff's 'gainst the bone  Firm and unyielding.  Oh thou Pisa! shame  Of all the people, who their dwelling make  In that fair region, where th' Italian voice  Is heard, since that thy neighbours are so slack  To punish, from their deep foundations rise  Capraia and Gorgona, and dam up  The mouth of Arno, that each soul in thee  May perish in the waters!  What if fame  Reported that thy castles were betray'd  By Ugolino, yet no right hadst thou  To stretch his children on the rack.  For them,  Brigata, Ugaccione, and the pair  Of gentle ones, of whom my song hath told,  Their tender years, thou modern Thebes! did make  Uncapable of guilt.  Onward we pass'd,  Where others skarf'd in rugged folds of ice  Not on their feet were turn'd, but each revers'd.    There very weeping suffers not to weep;  For at their eyes grief seeking passage finds  Impediment, and rolling inward turns  For increase of sharp anguish: the first tears  Hang cluster'd, and like"]]]
