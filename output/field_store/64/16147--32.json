Because women cannot use force.    12. Because the militants did use force.          Why We Oppose Pockets for Women      1. Because pockets are not a natural right.    2. Because the great majority of women do not want pockets. If they did  they would have them.    3. Because whenever women have had pockets they have not used them.    4. Because women are required to carry enough things as it is, without  the additional burden of pockets.    5. Because it would make dissension between husband and wife as to whose  pockets were to be filled.    6. Because it would destroy man's chivalry toward woman, if he did not  have to carry all her things in his pockets.    7. Because men are men, and women are women. We must not fly in the face  of nature.    8. Because pockets have been used by men to carry tobacco, pipes,  whiskey flasks, chewing gum and compromising letters. We see no reason  to suppose that women would use them more wisely.          Fashion Notes: Past and Present      1880--Anti-suffrage arguments are being worn long, calm and flowing this  year, with the dominant note that of woman's intellectual inferiority.    1890--Violence is very evident in this season's modes, and our more  conservative thinkers are saying that woman suffrage threatens the home,  the Church and the Republic.    1900--A complete change of style has taken place. Everything is being  worn _a l'aristocrate_, with the repeated assertion that too many people  are voting already.    1915--The best line of goods shown by the leading anti-suffrage houses  this spring is the statement that woman suffrage is the same thing as  free love. The effect is extremely piquant and surprising.          Why We Oppose Women Travelling in Railway Trains      1. Because travelling in trains is not a natural right.    2. Because our great-grandmothers never asked to travel in trains.    3. Because woman's place is the home, not the train.    4. Because it is unnecessary; there is no point reached by a train that  cannot be reached on foot.    5. Because it will double the work of conductors, engineers and brakemen  who are already overburdened.    6. Because men smoke and play cards in trains. Is there any reason to  believe that women will behave better?          Why We Oppose Schools for Children      (_By the Children's Anti-School League_.)    1. Because education is a burden, not a right.    2. Because not one-tenth of one per cent. of the children of this  country have demanded education.    3. Because if we are educated we should have to behave as if we were and  we don't want to.    4. Because it is essentially against the nature of a child to be  educated.    5. Because we can't see that it has done so much for grown-ups, and  there is no reason for thinking it will make children perfect.    6. Because the time of children is already sufficiently occupied without  going to school.    7. Because it would make dissension between parent and child. Imagine  the home life of a parent who turned out to be more ignorant than his  (or her) child?    8. Because we believe in the indirect education of the theatre, the  baseball field and the moving picture. We believe that schools would in  a great measure deprive us of this.    9. Because our parents went to school. They love us, they take care of  us, they tell us what to do. We are content that they should be educated  for us.          But Then Who Cares for Figures      An argument sometimes used against paying women as highly as men for the  same work is that women are only temporarily in industry.    Forty-four per cent of the women teachers in the public schools of New  York have been more than ten years in the service, while only twenty-six  per cent of the men teachers have served as long.           *       *       *       *       *    The Bundesrath of Germany has decided to furnish medical and financial  assistance to women at the time of childbirth, in order \"to alleviate  the anxiety of husbands at the front.\"    How strange this would sound: \"The Bundesrath has decided to furnish  medical assistance to the wounded at the front, in order to alleviate  the anxiety of wives and mothers at home.\"    When a benefit is suggested for men, the question asked is: \"Will it  benefit men?\"    When a benefit is suggested for women, the question is: \"Will it benefit  men?\"          Why We Oppose Votes for Men      1. Because man's place is the armory.    2. Because no really manly man wants to settle any question otherwise  than by fighting about it.    3. Because if men should adopt peaceable methods women will no longer  look up to them.    4. Because men will lose their charm if they step out of their natural  sphere and interest themselves in other matters than feats of arms,  uniforms and drums.    5. Because men are too emotional to vote. Their conduct at baseball  games and political conventions shows this, while their innate tendency  to appeal to force renders them peculiarly unfit for the task of  government.          The Logic of the Law      In 1875 the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in denying the petition of women  to practise before it said:    \"It would be shocking to man's reverence for womanhood and faith in  woman ... that woman should be permitted to mix professionally in all  the nastiness which finds its way into courts of justice.\"    It then names thirteen subjects as unfit for the attention of  women--three of them are crimes committed against women.          Consistency      (\"Vile insults, lewd talk and brutal conduct were used by the indicted  men to frighten respectable women who went to the polls in Terre Haute  at the last election, asserted District Attorney Dailey.\"--_Press  Dispatch_.)    Are the polls unfit for decent women?    No, sir, they are perfectly orderly.    Tut, tut! Go there at once and swear and be brutal, or what will become  of our anti-suffrage argument?          Sometimes We're Ivy, and Sometimes We're Oak      Is it true that the English government is calling on women to do work  abandoned by men?    Yes, it is true.    Is not woman's place the home?    No, not when men need her services outside the home.    Will she never be told again that her place is the home?    Oh, yes, indeed.    When?    As soon as men want their jobs back again.          Do You Know      That in 1869 Miss Jex-Blake and four other women entered for a medical  degree at the University of Edinburgh?    That the president of the College of Physicians refused to give the  women the prizes they had won?    That the undergraduates insulted any professor who allowed women to  compete for prizes?    That the women were stoned in the streets, and finally excluded from  the medical school?    That in 1877 the British Medical Association declared women ineligible  for membership?    That in 1881 the International Medical Congress excluded women from all  but its \"social and ceremonial meetings\"?    That the Obstetrical Society refused to allow a woman's name to appear  on the title page of a pamphlet which she had written with her husband?    That according to a recent dispatch from London, many hospitals, since  the outbreak of hostilities, have asked women to become resident  physicians, and public authorities are daily endeavoring to obtain women  as assistant medical officers and as school doctors?          Interviews With Celebrated Anti-Suffragists      \"Woman's place is in my home.\"--Appius Claudius.    \"I have never felt the need of the ballot.\"--Cleopatra.    \"Magna Charta merely fashionable fad of ye Barons.\"--King John.    \"Boston Tea Party shows American colonists to be hysterical and utterly  incapable of self-government.\"--George III.    \"Know of no really good slaves who desire emancipation.\"--President of  the United Slaveholders' Protective Association.          Another of Those Curious Coincidences      On February 15, the House of Representatives passed a bill making it  unlawful to ship in interstate commerce the products of a mill, cannery  or factory which have been produced by the labor of children under  fourteen years.    Forty-three gentlemen voted against it.    Forty-one of those forty-three had also voted against the woman suffrage  bill.    Not one single vote was cast against it by a representative from any  state where women vote for Congressmen.          The New Freedom      \"The Michigan commission on industrial relations has discovered,\" says  \"The Detroit Journal,\" \"that thousands of wives support their husbands.\"    Woman's place is the home, but under a special privilege she is  sometimes allowed to send her wages as a substitute.          To the Great Dining Out Majority      The New York State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage is sending out  leaflets to its members urging them to \"tell every man you meet, your  tailor, your postman, your grocer, as well as your _dinner partner_,  that you are opposed to woman suffrage.\"    We hope that the 90,000 sewing machine operatives, the 40,000  saleswomen, the 32,000 laundry operatives, the 20,000 knitting and silk  mill girls, the 17,000 women janitors and cleaners, the 12,000  cigar-makers, to say nothing of the 700,000 other women and girls in  industry in New York State, will remember when they have drawn off their  long gloves and tasted their oysters to tell their dinner partners that  they are opposed to woman suffrage because they fear it might take women  out of the home.          WOMEN'S SPHERE          Many Men to Any Woman          If you have beauty, charm, refinement, tact,      If you can prove that should I set you free,      You would not contemplate the smallest act      That might annoy or interfere with me.      If you can show that women will abide      By the best standards of their womanhood--      (And I must be the person to decide      What in a woman is the highest good);      If you display efficiency supreme      In"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11692"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 03 (#3)"],[1,", help seemed to come from the clouds. Two  Danish noblemen, ardent admirers quite unknown to him personally,  heard of his painful situation and offered him a pension of a thousand  thalers a year for three years. No conditions whatever were attached  to the gift; he was simply to follow his inclination, free from all  anxiety about a livelihood. Without hesitation he accepted the gift  and thus found himself, for the first time in his life, really free to  do as he chose. What he chose was to use his freedom for a grapple  with Kant's philosophy. Today this seems a strange choice for a sick  poet, but let Schiller himself explain what lay in his mind. He wrote  to Koerner:    \"It is precisely for the sake of artistic creation that I wish to  philosophize. Criticism must repair the damage it has done me. And it  has done me great damage indeed; for I miss in myself these many years  that boldness, that living fire, that was mine before I knew a rule.  Now I see myself in the act of creating and fashioning; I observe the  play of inspiration, and my imagination works less freely, since it is  conscious of being watched. But if I once reach the point where  artistic procedure becomes natural, like education for the  well-nurtured man, then my fancy will get back its old freedom and  know no bounds but those of its own making.\"    From these words we understand the nature of Schiller's enterprise--he  wished to fathom the laws of beauty. It seemed to him that beauty  could not be altogether a matter of changing taste, opinion, and  fashion; that somehow or other it must be grounded in eternal laws  either of the external world or of human nature. He felt, too, that a  knowledge of these laws, could it once become second nature, would be  very helpful to him as a dramatic poet. Whether he was right in so  thinking is a question too large to be discussed here, nor can we  follow him in the details of his esthetic speculation. The subject is  too abstruse to be dispatched in a few words. Suffice it to say that a  number of minor papers, the most important being _On Winsomeness and  Dignity (Ueber Anmut and Wuerde)_ and _On the Sublime_, prepared the way  for a more popular exposition of his views in the _Letters on Esthetic  Education_ and in the memorable essay _On Naive and Sentimental  Poetry_, which deserves to be called, next to Lessing's _Laocoon_, the  weightiest critical essay of the eighteenth century. The Letters  contain a ripe and pleasing statement of Schiller's philosophy in its  relation to the culture-problems of his epoch.    Along with these philosophic studies Schiller found time for much work  more closely related to his professorship of history. To say nothing  of his minor historical writings, he completed, in 1793, his _History  of the Thirty Years' War_. It appeared in successive numbers of  Goeschen's _Ladies' Calendar_, a fact which in itself indicates that it  was not conceived and should not be judged as a monument of research.  The aim was to tell the story of the great war in a readable style.  And in this Schiller succeeded, especially in the parts relating to  his hero, the Swedish king Gustav Adolf. Over Schiller's merit as a  historian there has been much debate, and good critics have caviled at  his sharp contrasts and his lack of care in matters of detail. But the  great fact remains that the _Defection of the Netherlands_ and the  _Thirty Years' War_ are the earliest historical classics in the German  language. Schiller was the first German to make literature out of  history.    The year 1794 brought about a closer relation between Schiller and  Goethe, an event of prime moment in the lives of both. On Goethe's  return from Italy, in the summer of 1788, Schiller was introduced to  him, but the meeting had no immediate consequences. In fact, Schiller  had quietly made up his mind not to like the man whom, for a whole  year, he had heard constantly lauded by the Weimar circle. He thought  of Goethe as a proud, self-centred son of fortune, with whom  friendship would be impossible. Goethe, on the other hand, was not  drawn to the author of _The Robbers_. He looked on the popularity of  the detestable play as a shocking evidence of depraved public taste  and was not aware how its author had changed since writing it. So it  came about that, for some six years, the two men lived as neighbors in  space but strangers in the spirit. At last, however, an accidental  meeting in Jena led to an interchange of views and prepared the way  for the most memorable of literary friendships.    By this time Schiller had undertaken the editorship of a new literary  magazine to be called _Die Horen_, which was to be financed by the  enterprising publisher Cotta in Stuttgart. The plan was that it should  eclipse all previous undertakings of its kind. But it was to eschew  politics. Germany was just then agitated by the fierce passions of the  revolutionary epoch, and this excitement was regarded by Schiller as  ominous for the nation. There was need of esthetic education. So he  proposed to keep the _Horen_ clear of politics and try to divert the  minds of men into the serener regions of letters and art. To Goethe,  who also hated the Revolution, this was a highly acceptable program.  So he readily undertook to write for the _Horen_, and thus he and  Schiller soon became linked together in the public mind as allied  champions of a cause. It is for this reason that the Germans are wont  to call them the Dioscuri.    By way of signalizing their community of interest the Dioscuri  presently began to write satirical distichs at the expense of men and  tendencies that they did not like. For example:      Gentlemen, keep your seats! for the curs but covet your places,    Elegant places to hear all the other dogs bark.    The making of these more or less caustic epigrams amused them.  Sometimes one would suggest the topic and the other write the distich;  again, one would do the hexameter, the other the pentameter. They  agreed that neither should ever claim separate property in the  _Xenia_, as they were called. The number grew apace, until it reached  nearly a thousand. About half the number on hand were published in  1797 in Schiller's _Musenalmanach_ and had the effect of setting all  Germany agog with curiosity, rage or solemn glee. Some of those hit  replied in kind or in vicious attacks, and for a little while there  was great excitement. But having discharged their broadside Goethe and  Schiller did not further pursue the ignoble warfare. They wisely came  to the conclusion that the best way to elevate the public taste was  not to assail the bad in mordant personal epigrams, but to exemplify  the good in creative work.    After his nine years of fruitful wandering in other fields Schiller  returned at last, in 1796, to dramatic poetry. Once more it came in  his way to write for the stage, since Goethe was now director of the  Weimar theatre. After some hesitation between _Wallenstein_ and _The  Knights of Malta_, both of which had long haunted his thoughts, he  decided in favor of the former. It occupied him for three years and  finally left his hands as a long affair in three parts. Yet it is not  a trilogy in the proper sense, but a play in ten acts, preceded by a  dramatic prelude. At first Schiller found the material refractory. The  actual Wallenstein had never exhibited truly heroic qualities of any  kind, and his history involved only the cold passions of ambition,  envy, and vindictiveness. Whether he was really guilty of treason was  a moot question which admitted of no partisan treatment. But  Schiller's genius triumphed splendidly over the difficulties inherent  in the subject. In the _Camp_ we get a picturesque view of the motley  soldatesca which was the basis of Wallenstein's power and prestige. In  _The Piccolomini_ we see the nature of the dangerous game he is  playing, and in _Wallenstein's Death_ the unheroic hero becomes very  impressive in his final discomfiture and his pitiable taking-off. The  love-tragedy of Max and Thekla casts a mellow light of romance over  the otherwise austere political action.    [Illustration: 1. THE MILITARY ACADEMY IN STUTTGART WHERE SCHILLER WAS  EDUCATED]    [Illustration: 2. THE THEATRE IN MANNHEIM IN 1782 WHERE SCHILLER'S  \"THE ROBBERS,\" \"FIESCO,\" AND \"LOVE AND INTRIGUE\" WERE FIRST PLAYED]    During the years 1795-1800 Schiller wrote a large number of short  poems in which he gave expression to his matured philosophy of life.  His best ballads also belong to this period. Pure song he did not  often attempt, his philosophic bent predisposing him to what the  Germans call the lyric of thought. Perhaps his invalidism had  something to do with it; at any rate the total number of his singable  lyrics, such as _The Maiden's Lament_, is but small. As a poet of  reflection he is at his best in _The Ideal and Life, The Walk, The  Eleusinian Festival_, and the more popular _Song of the Bell_. The  first-named of these four, at first called _The Realm of Shades_, is a  masterpiece of high thinking, charged with warm emotion and bodied  forth in gorgeous imagery. Its doctrine is that only by taking refuge  in the realm of the Ideal can we escape from the tyranny of the flesh,  the bondage of Nature's law, the misery of struggle and defeat. Yet it  is not a doctrine of quietism that is here preached, as if inner peace  were the supreme thing in life, but rather one of hopeful endeavor.  _The Walk_, one of the finest elegies in the German language, is a  pensive retrospect of the origins of civilization, loving  contemplation of Nature giving rise to reflections on man and his  estate. _The Song of the Bell_, probably the best known of all  Schiller's poems, gives expression to his feeling for the dignity of  labor and for the poetry of man's social life. Perhaps we may say that  the heart of his message is found in this stanza of _The Words of  Illusion_:      "]]]
