As soon as I feel an impulse, or experience motion, I am under the  necessity to acknowledge extent, solidity, density, impenetrability in  the substance I see move, or from which I receive impulse: thus, when  action is attributed to any cause whatever, I am obliged to consider  it MATERIAL. I may be ignorant of its individual nature, of its mode  of action, or of its generic properties; but I cannot deceive myself in  general properties, which are common to all matter: this ignorance will  only be increased, when I shall take that for granted of a being, of  which from that moment I am precluded by what I admit from forming any  idea, which moreover deprives it completely either of the faculty of  moving itself, giving an impulse, or acting. Thus, according to the  received idea of the term, a spiritual substance that moves itself, that  gives motion to matter, and that acts, implies a contradiction, that  necessarily infers a total impossibility.    The partizans of spirituality believe they answer the difficulties they  have accumulated, by asserting that \"_the soul is entire--is whole under  each point of its extent_.\" If an absurd answer will solve difficulties,  they certainly have done it. But let us examine this reply:--it will  be found that this indivisible part which is called soul, however  insensible or however minute, must yet remain something: then an  infinity of unextended substances, or the same substance having no  dimensions, repeated an infinity of times, would constitute a substance  that has extent: this cannot be what they mean, because according to  this principle, the human soul would then be as infinite as the Author  of Nature; seeing that they have stated this to be a being without  extent, who is an infinity of times whole in each part of the universe.  But when there shall appear as much solidity in the answer as there is  a want of it, it must be acknowledged that in whatever manner the spirit  or the soul finds itself in its extent, when the body moves forward the  soul does not remain behind; if so, it has a quality in common with  the body, peculiar to matter; since it is conveyed from place to place  jointly with the body. Thus, when even the soul should be admitted to  be immaterial, what conclusion must be drawn? Entirely submitted to the  motion of the body, without this body it would remain dead and inert.  This soul would only be part of a two-fold machine, necessarily impelled  forward by a concatenation, or connection with the whole. It would  resemble a bird, which a child conducts at its pleasure, by the string  with which it is bound.    Thus, it is for want of consulting experience, by not attending to  reason, that man has darkened his ideas upon the concealed principle of  his motion. If, disentangled from prejudice--if, destitute of gratuitous  suppositions--if, throwing aside error, he would contemplate his soul,  or the moving principle that acts within him, he would be convinced that  it forms a part of its body, that it cannot be distinguished from  it, but by abstraction; that it is only the body itself, considered  relatively with some of its functions, or with those faculties of which  its nature, or its peculiar organization, renders it susceptible:--he  will perceive that this soul is obliged to undergo the same changes as  the body; that it is born with it; that it expands itself with it;  that like the body, it passes through a state of infancy, a period of  weakness, a season of inexperience; that it enlarges itself, that it  strengthens itself, in the same progression; that like the body, it  arrives at an adult age or reaches maturity; that it is then, and not  till then, it obtains the faculty of fulfilling certain functions; that  it is in this stage, and in no other, that it enjoys reason; that it  displays more or less wit, judgment, and manly activity; that like the  body, it is subject to those vicissitudes which exterior causes obliges  it to undergo by their influence; that, conjointly with the body, it  suffers, enjoys, partakes of its pleasures, shares its pains, is sound  when the body is healthy, and diseased when the body is oppressed  with sickness; that like the body, it is continually modified by the  different degrees of density in the atmosphere; by the variety of the  seasons, and by the various properties of the aliments received into  the stomach: in short, he would be obliged to acknowledge that at some  periods it manifests visible signs of torpor, stupefaction, decrepitude,  and death.    In despite of this analogy, or rather this continual identity, of  the soul with the body, man has been desirous of distinguishing their  essence; he has therefore made the soul an inconceivable being: but  in order that he might form to himself some idea of it, he was,  notwithstanding, obliged to have recourse to material beings, and to  their manner of acting. The word _spirit_, therefore, presents to the  mind no other ideas than those of breathing, of respiration, of wind.  Thus, when it is said the _soul is a spirit_, it really means nothing  more than that its mode of action is like that of breathing: which  though invisible in itself, or acting without being seen, nevertheless  produces very visible effects. But breath, it is acknowledged, is a  material cause; it is allowed to be air modified; it is not, therefore,  a simple or pure substance, such as the moderns designate under the name  of SPIRIT.    It is rather singular that in the Hebrew, the Greek, and the Latin, the  synonymy, or corresponding term for spirit should signify _breath_.  The metaphysicians themselves can best say why they have adopted such  a word, to designate the substance they have distinguished from matter:  some of them, fearful they should not have distinct beings enough, have  gone farther, and compounded man of three substances, BODY, SOUL, and  INTELLECT.    Although the word _spirit_ is so very ancient among men, the sense  attached to it by the moderns is quite new: the idea of spirituality, as  admitted at this day, is a recent production of the imagination. Neither  PYTHAGORAS nor PLATO, however heated their brain, however decided  their taste for the marvellous, appear to have understood by spirit an  immaterial substance, or one without extent, devoid of parts; such as  that of which the moderns have formed the human soul, the concealed  author of motion. The ancients, by the word spirit, were desirous to  define matter of an extreme subtilty, of a purer quality than that which  acted grossly on our senses. In consequence, some have regarded the soul  as an ethereal substance; others as igneous matter; others again have  compared it to light. DEMOCRITUS made it consist in motion, consequently  gave it a manner of existence. ARISTOXENES, who was himself a musician,  made it harmony. ARISTOTLE regarded the soul as the moving faculty, upon  which depended the motion of living bodies.    The earliest doctors of Christianity had no other idea of the soul,  than that it was material. TERTULLIAN, ARNOBIUS, CLEMENT of ALEXANDRIA,  ORIGEN, SAINT JUSTIN, IRENAEUS, have all of them discoursed upon it; but  have never spoken of it other than as a corporeal substance--as matter.  It was reserved for their successors at a great distance of time, to  make the human soul and the soul of the world _pure spirits_; that is  to say, immaterial substances, of which it is impossible they could  form any accurate idea: by degrees this incomprehensible doctrine of  spirituality, conformable without doubt to the views of those who make  it a principle to annihilate reason, prevailed over the others: But  it might be fairly asked, if the pretended proofs of this doctrine owe  themselves to a man, who on a much more comprehensible point has been  proved in error; if, on that which time has shewn was accessible to  man's reason, the great champion in support of this dogma was deceived;  are we not bound to examine, with the most rigorous investigation, the  reasonings, the evidence, of one who was the decided, the proven child  of enthusiasm and error? Yet DESCARTES, to whose sublime errors the  world is indebted for the Newtonian system, although before him the  soul had been considered spiritual, was the first who established that,  \"_that which thinks ought to be distinguished from matter_;\" from whence  he concludes rather hastily, that the soul, or that which thinks in man,  is a spirit; or a simple indivisible substance. Perhaps it would have  been more logical, more consistent with reason, to have said, since  man, who is matter, who has no idea but of matter, enjoys the faculty of  thought, matter can think; that is, it is susceptible of that particular  modification called thought.    However this may be, this doctrine was believed divine, supernatural,  because it was inconceivable to man. Those who dared believe even that  which was believed before; namely, _that the soul was material_, were  held as rash inconsiderate madmen, or else treated as enemies to the  welfare and happiness of the human race. When man had once renounced  experience; when he had abjured his reason; when he had joined the  banner of this enthusiastic novelty; he did nothing more, day after day,  than subtilize the delirium, the ravings of his imagination: he pleased  himself by continually sinking deeper into the most unfathomable depths  of error: he felicitated himself on his discoveries; on his pretended  knowledge; in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8910"],[0,"The System of Nature, or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World. Volume 2 (#20)"],[1,"with qualities capable of being brought within the range  of his comprehension.    For the most part the notions on the Divinity, which obtain credit even  at the present day, are nothing more than a general terror diversely  acquired, variously modified in the mind of nations, which do not  tend to prove any thing, save that they have received them from their  trembling, ignorant ancestors. These gods have been successively  altered, decorated, subtilized, by those thinkers, those legislators,  those priests, who have meditated deeply upon them; who have prescribed  systems of worship to the uninformed; who have availed themselves  of their existing prejudices, to submit them to their yoke; who have  obtained a dominion over their mind, by seizing on their credulity,--by  making them participate in their errors,--by working on their fears;  these dispositions will always be a necessary consequence of man's  ignorance, when steeped in the sorrows of his heart.    If it be true, as asserted, that the earth has never witnessed any  nation so unsociable, so savage, to be without some form of religious  worship--who did not adore some god--but little will result from it  respecting the Divinity. The word GOD, will rarely be found to designate  more than the unknown cause of those effects which man has either  admired or dreaded. Thus, this notion so generally diffused, upon which  so much stress is laid; will prove little more than that man in all  generations has been ignorant of natural causes,--that he has been  incompetent, from some cause or other, to account for those phenomena  which either excited his surprise or roused his fears. If at the present  day a people cannot be found destitute of some kind of worship, entirely  without superstition, who do not acknowledge a God, who have not adopted  a theology more or less subtle, it is because the uninformed ancestors  of these people have all endured misfortunes--have been alarmed by  terrifying effects, which they have attributed to unknown causes--have  beheld strange sights, which they have ascribed to powerful agents,  whose existence they could not fathom; the details of which, together  with their own bewildered notions, they have handed down to their  posterity who have not given them any kind of examination.    It will readily be allowed, that the universality of an opinion by  no means proves its truth. Do we not see a great number of ignorant  prejudices, a multitude of barbarous errors, even at the present day,  receive the almost universal sanction of the human race? Are not nearly  all the inhabitants of the earth imbued with the idea of magic--in the  habit of acknowledging occult powers--given to divination--believers in  enchantment--the slaves to omens--supporters of witchcraft--thoroughly  persuaded of the existence of ghosts? If some of the most enlightened  persons are cured of these follies, they still find very zealous  partizans in the greater number of mankind, who accredit them with the  firmest confidence. It would not, however, be concluded by men of sound  sense, in many instances not by the theologian himself, that therefore  these chimeras actually have existence, although sanctioned with the  credence of the multitude. Before Copernicus, there was no one who did  not believe that the earth was stationary, that the sun described his  annual revolution round it. Was, however, this universal consent of  man upon a principle of astronomical science, which endured for so many  thousand years, less an error on that account? Yet to have doubted the  truth of such a generally-diffused opinion, one that had received  the sanction of so many learned men--that was clothed with the sacred  vestments of so many ages of credulity--that had been adopted by Moses,  acknowledged by Solomon, accredited by the Persian magi--that Elijah  himself had not refuted--that had obtained the fiat of the most  respectable universities, the most enlightened legislators, the wisest  kings, the most eloquent ministers; in short, a principle that embraced  all the stability that could be derived from the universal consent of  all ranks: to have doubted, I say, of this, would at one period have  been held as the highest degree of profanation, as the most presumptuous  scepticism, as an impious blasphemy, that would have threatened the very  existence of that unhappy country from whose unfortunate bosom such a  venomous, sacrilegious mortal could have arisen. It is well known what  opinion was entertained of Gallileo for maintaining the existence of the  antipodes. Pope Gregory excommunicated as atheists all those who gave it  credit. Thus each man has his God: But do all these gods exist? In reply  it will be said, somewhat triumphantly, each man hath his ideas of the  sun, do all these suns exist? However narrow may be the pass by which  superstition imagines it has thus guarded its favourite hypothesis,  nothing will perhaps be more easy than the answer: the existence of the  sun is a fact verified by the daily use of the senses; all the world see  the sun; no one bath ever said there is no sun; nearly all mankind have  acknowledged it to be both luminous and hot: however various may be the  opinions of man, upon this luminary, no one has ever yet pretended there  was more than one attached to our planetary system. But we may  perhaps be told, there is a wide difference between that which can be  contemplated by the visual organs, which can be understood by the sense  of feeling, and that which does not come under the cognizance of any  part of the organic structure of man. We must confess theology here  has the advantage; that we are unable to follow it through its devious  sinuosities; amidst its meandering labyrinths: but then it is the  advantage of those who see sounds, over those who only hear them; of  those who hear colours, over those who only see them; of the professors  of a science, where every thing is built upon laws inverted from those  common to the globe we inhabit; over those common understandings, who  cannot be sensible to any thing that does not give an impulse to some of  their organs.    If man, therefore, had the courage to throw aside his prejudices, which  every thing conspires to render as durable as himself--if divested  of fear he would examine coolly--if guided by reason he would  dispassionately view the nature of things, the evidence adduced  in support of any given doctrine; he would, at least, be under  the necessity to acknowledge, that the idea of the Divinity is not  innate--that it is not anterior to his existence--that it is  the production of time, acquired by communication with his own  species--that, consequently, there was a period when it did not actually  exist in him: he would see clearly, that he holds it by tradition from  those who reared him: that these themselves received it from their  ancestors: that thus tracing it up, it will be found to have been  derived in the last resort, from ignorant savages, who were our first  fathers. The history of the world will shew that crafty legislators,  ambitious tyrants, blood-stained conquerors, have availed themselves of  the ignorance, the fears, the credulity of his progenitors, to turn  to their own profit an idea to which they rarely attached any other  substantive meaning than that of submitting them to the yoke of their  own domination.    Without doubt there have been mortals who have dreamed they have seen  the Divinity. Mahomet, I believe, boasted he had a long conversation  with the Deity, who promulgated to him the system of the Mussulmans. But  are there not thousands, even of the theologians, who will exhaust their  breath, and fatigue their lungs with vociferating this man was a liar;  whose object was to take advantage of the simplicity, to profit by the  enthusiasm, to impose on the credulity of the Arabs; who promulgated  for truths, the crazy reveries of his own distempered imagination?  Nevertheless, is it not a truth, that this doctrine of the crafty Arab,  is at this day the creed of millions, transmitted to them by their  ancestors, rendered sacred by time, read to them in their mosques,  adorned with all the ceremonies of superstitious worship; of which the  inhabitants of a vast portion of the earth do not permit themselves for  an instant to doubt the veracity; who, on the contrary, hold those who  do not accredit it as dogs, as infidels, as beings of an inferior rank,  of meaner capacities than themselves? Indeed that man, even if he were  a theologian, would not experience the most gentle treatment from the  infuriated Mahometan, who should to his face venture to dispute the  divine mission of his prophet. Thus the ancestors of the Turk have  transmitted to their posterity, those ideas of the Divinity which they  manifestly received from those who deceived them; whose impositions,  modified from age to age, subtilized by the priests, clothed with  the reverential awe inspired by fear, have by degrees acquired that  solidity, received that corroboration, attained that veteran stability,  which is the natural result of public sanction, backed by theological  parade.    The word God is, perhaps, among the first that vibrate on the ear of  man; it is reiterated to him incessantly; he is taught to lisp it  with respect; to listen to it with fear; to bend the knee when it is  reverberated: by dint of repetition, by listening to the fables of  antiquity, by hearing it pronounced by all ranks and persuasions, he  seriously believes all men bring the idea with them into the world; he  thus confounds a mechanical habit with instinct; whilst it is for want  of being able to recal to himself the first circumstances under which  his imagination was awakened by this name; for want of recollecting all  the recitals made to him during the course of his infancy; for want of  accurately defining what was instilled into him by his education; in  short,"]]]
