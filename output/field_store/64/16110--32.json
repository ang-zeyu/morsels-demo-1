And it is obvious that the greater the mass of higher      and spiritual forces, whether found in those to whom the execution      of the law is assigned or in the great mass by whom the suffrage      is exercised, and who direct the execution of the law, the greater      will be the safety and the surer will be the happiness of the      state.        It is too late to question the intellectual and moral capacity      of woman to understand great political issues (which are always      primarily questions of conscience--questions of the intelligent      application of the principles of right and of wrong in public and      private affairs) and properly decide them at the polls. Indeed,      so far as your committee are aware, the pretense is no longer      advanced that woman should not vote by reason of her mental or      moral unfitness to perform this legislative function; but the      suffrage is denied to her because she can not hang criminals,      suppress mobs, nor handle the enginery of war. We have already      seen the untenable nature of this assumption, because those who      make it bestow the suffrage upon very large classes of men who,      however well qualified they may be to vote, are physically unable      to perform any of the duties which appertain to the execution of      the law and the defense of the state. Scarcely a Senator on      this floor is liable by law to perform a military or other      administrative duty, yet the rule so many set up against the right      of women to vote would disfranchise nearly this whole body.        But it unnecessary to grant that woman can not fight. History is      full of examples of her heroism in danger, of her endurance and      fortitude in trial, and of her indispensable and supreme service      in hospital and field; and in the handling of the deft and      horrible machinery and infernal agencies which science and art      have prepared and are preparing for human destruction in future      wars, woman may perform her whole part in the common assault or      the common defense. It is hardly worth while to consider this      trivial objection that she is incompetent for purposes of national      murder or of bloody self-defense as the basis of the denial of a      great fundamental right, when we consider that if that right were      given to her she would by its exercise almost certainly abolish      this great crime of the nations, which has always inflicted upon      her the chief burden of woe.    It will be admitted that the act of voting is operative in government  only as a means of deciding upon the adoption or rejection of measures  or of the selection of officers to enact, administer, and execute the  laws.    In the discharge of these functions it also must be admitted that  intelligence and conscience are the faculties requisite to secure  their proper performance.    In this day when woman has demonstrated that she is fully the  intellectual equal of man in the profound as well as in the politer  walks of learning--in art, science, literature, and, considering her  opportunities, that she is not his inferior in any of the professions  or in the great mass of useful occupations, while she is, in fact,  becoming the chief educator of the race and is the acknowledged  support of the great ministrations of charity and religion; when in  such great organizations as the suffrage associations, missionary  societies, the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and even  upon the still larger scale of international action, she has exhibited  her power by mere moral influences and the inspiration of great  purposes, without the aid of legal penalties or even of tangible  inconveniences, to mold and direct the discordant thought and action  of thousands and millions of people scattered over separate States,  and sometimes even living in countries hostile to each other to the  accomplishment of great earthly or heavenly ends, it is unreasonable  to deny to woman the suffrage in political affairs upon the  false allegation that she is wanting in the very qualities most  indispensable and requisite for the proper exercise of this great  right.    The advocates of universal male suffrage have long since ceased  to deny the ballot to woman upon the ground that she is unfit or  incompetent to exercise it.    There is a class of high-stepping objectors, like Ouida, who decry the  sound judgment and moral excellence of woman as compared with man, but  in the same breath these people deny the suffrage to the masses of men  and advocate \"the just supremacy of the fittest,\" so that no time need  be wasted in refutation of those malignant and libelous aspersions  upon our mothers, sisters, and wives, which, when carried to logical  conclusions by their own authors, deny the fundamental principles of  liberty to man and woman alike, and reassert in its baldest form the  dogma that \"the existing system of electoral power all over the world  is absurd, and will remain so because in no nation is there the  courage, perhaps in no nation is there the intellectual power, capable  of putting forward and sustaining the logical doctrine of the just  supremacy of the fittest.\"    In fact the minority of the committee, and this is true of all honest,  intelligent men who believe in the republican system of government at  all, concede that woman has the capacity and moral fitness requisite  to exercise the ballot. That class of women represented by the author  of \"Letters from a Chimney Corner,\" whose work has been adopted by  the minority as the basis of their report, speaking through the \"fair  authoress,\" say that \"if women were to be considered in their highest  and final estate as merely individual beings, and if the right to the  ballot were to be conceded to man as an individual, it might perhaps  he logically argued that women also possessed the inherent right to  vote.\" Let me read from the views of the minority on page 1:        The undersigned minority of the Committee of the Senate on Woman      Suffrage, to whom was referred Senate Resolution No. 5, proposing      an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to grant      the right to vote to the women of the United States, beg leave to      submit the following minority report, consisting of extracts from      a little volume entitled, \"Letters from a Chimney Corner,\" written      by a highly cultivated lady, Mrs. ----, of Chicago, This gifted      lady has discussed the question with so much clearness and force      that we make no apology to the Senate for substituting quotations      from her book in place of anything we might produce. We quote      first from chapter 3, which is entitled \"The value of suffrage to      women much overestimated.\"    The fair authoress says:        \"If women were to be considered in their highest and final estate      as merely individual beings, and if the right to the ballot were      to be conceded to man as an individual, it might perhaps be      logically argued that women also possessed the inherent right to      vote. But from the oldest times, and through all the history      of the race, has run the glimmer of an idea, more or less      distinguishable in different ages and under different      circumstances, that neither man nor woman is, as such, individual;      that neither being is of itself a whole, a unit, but each requires      to be supplemented by the other before its true structural      integrity can be achieved. Of this idea, the science of botany      furnishes the moat perfect illustration. The stamens on the one      hand, and the ovary and pistil on the other, may indeed reside in      one blossom, which then exists in a married or reproductive state.      But equally well, the stamens or male organs may reside in one      plant, and the ovary and pistil or female organs may reside in      another. In that case, the two plants are required to make one      structurally complete organization. Each is but half a plant, an      incomplete individual by itself. The life principle of each must      be united to that of the other; the twain must be indeed one flesh      before the organization is either structurally or functionally      complete.\"    This is a concession of the whole argument, unless the highest and  final estate of woman is to be something else than a mere individual.  It would also follow that if such be her destiny--that is, to be  something else than a mere \"individual being\"--and if for that reason  she is to be denied the suffrage, then man equally should be denied  the ballot if his highest and final estate is to be something else  than a \"mere individual.\"    Thereupon the minority of the committee, through the \"Fair Authoress,\"  proceed to show that both man and woman are designed for a higher  final estate--to wit, that of matrimony. It seems to be conceded  that man is just as much fitted for matrimony as woman herself, and  thereupon the whole subject is illuminated with certain botanical lore  about stamens and pistils, which, however relevant to matrimony, does  not seem to me to prove that therefore woman should not vote unless at  the same time it proves that man should not vote either. And certainly  it can not apply to those women any more than to those men whose  highest and final estate never is merged in the family relation at  all, and even \"Ouida\" concedes \"that the project ... to give votes  only to unmarried women may be dismissed without discussion, as it  would be found to be wholly untenable.\"    There is no escape from it. The discussion has passed so far that  among intelligent people who believe in the republican form--that  is, free government--all mature men and women have under "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11115"],[0,"Frank Merriwell at Yale; Or, Freshman Against Freshman (#3)"],[1," and his head was still attached to his body.    Then he forced a derisive laugh from his lips, and seemed not the least  disturbed, much to the disgust of the assembly.    \"Confound him!\" growled a voice, which Frank fancied he recognized as  belonging to Browning. \"There's no fun in him. Let's try another.\"    Then Frank was lifted to his feet and assisted to don his coat.    \"If you want to stay and see the fun, put on a mask,\" directed Mephisto.  \"You must not be recognized by the other freshies.\"    He was given a mask and he put it on as directed.    A moment later the masked youths began to howl and blow horns. A door  opened, and Diamond, blindfolded and bound, was led into the room.    The young Virginian stood up haughtily, and he was seen to strain and  struggle in an effort to free his hands.    \"I protest against this outrage!\" he cried, angrily. \"I want you to know  that my father--\"    The horns and the shouts drowned his words. He was forced to mount the  steps to a high platform, and an instant later he found himself shooting  down a slippery incline of planed and greased boards.    The racket stopped as Diamond scooted down the slippery surface. He  dropped sprawling into the vat of icy water. Several hands caught hold  of him, yanked him up, and thrust him down again.    \"Oh, somebody shall suffer for this!\" gurgled the helpless freshman,  spluttering water from his mouth.    He was dragged out of the vat, and then he was forced to endure all the  hustling, and thumping, and banging which Frank Merriwell had passed  through. His protests seemed to fall on deaf ears.    It had been reported that Diamond had declared that the sophomores would  not dare to haze him, as his father would make it hot for them if they  did. The report was remembered, and he was used more severely than Frank  had been.    Hazing at Yale was said to be a thing of the past, but Frank saw it was  still carried on secretly.    \"Make a speech, fresh!\" shouted a voice.    \"Speech! speech!\" yelled the masked lads.    Diamond was placed on a low table.    For a moment he hesitated, and then he fancied he saw his opportunity to  make a protest that would be heard.    \"I will make a speech,\" he declared. \"I'll tell you young ruffians what  I think of you and what--\"    Swish! a sponge that was dripping with dirty water struck him square in  the mouth. Some of the water went down his throat, and he choked and  strangled.    The table was jerked from beneath his feet, and he fell into the waiting  arms of the masked sophomores.    \"He called us ruffians! Give it to him!\"    Then the unfortunate freshman was used worse than ever. He was tossed in  a blanket, given a powerful shock of electricity, deafened by the horns,  pounded with the stuffed clubs, and hustled till there was scarcely any  breath left in his body.    Then the bandage was torn from Diamond's eyes and he was confronted by  the guillotine, over which fresh red ink had been liberally spattered.  The blade of the huge knife was dripping in a gory manner, and it really  looked as if it had just completed a deadly piece of work.    Despite himself, the young Virginian shivered when his eyes rested on  the apparently blood-stained blade.    \"Be careful!\" some one distinctly whispered. \"We do not want to kill  more than one freshman in a night.\"    Some one else spoke of the frightful manner in which the knife had cut  Merriwell, and then, despite his feeble struggles, Diamond was placed  upon the instrument of torture.    \"The other fresh died game,\" muttered the executioner. \"Of course we  didn't mean to kill him, but the knife is out of order and it slipped by  accident. We haven't time to fix it properly, but there are only about  nine chances out of ten that it will fall again.\"    \"Oh, you fellows shall pay for this!\" feebly gasped Diamond.    Despite himself, although he knew how unlikely such a thing was, he  could not help wondering if a terrible accident had really happened. If  not, where was Merriwell. He looked around, but saw nothing of Frank,  who was keeping in the background.    And then, when his nerves had been quite unstrung, the knife fell, the  ice and warm water were applied, and Diamond could not choke back the  cry of horror that forced itself from his lips.    A roar of laughter broke from the masked students.    When Diamond was lifted to his feet he was almost too weak to stand. He  clinched his teeth, vowing over and over to himself that he would find a  way to square accounts.    \"If it takes me a year, I'll find out who the leaders in this affair  are, and they shall suffer for it!\" he thought.    \"Give him a chance to see the others put through the mill,\" said  Mephisto, and Diamond's hands were released.    The Virginian looked around, seeming irresolute for a moment. Not far  away he saw a masked lad whose clothes were wet and bedaubed with dirt  and sawdust.    In an instant Diamond sprang toward this person and snatched the mask  from his face.    \"It's Merriwell!\" he triumphantly shouted, \"and he has helped to haze  me! His career at Yale will be suddenly cut short!\"          CHAPTER III.    THE BLOW.      There was a sudden hush. The students saw that Diamond was really  revengeful, and his words seemed to indicate that he intended to report  any one whose identity he discovered.    The Virginian was pale and he trembled with anger.    \"You don't mean to say that you will blow, do you?\" asked one.    \"That's exactly what I do mean, sir!\" came resolutely from the lips of  the infuriated freshman. \"I am a gentleman and the son of a gentleman,  and I'll never stand it to be treated like a cur. Hazing is said to be  no longer tolerated here, and an investigation is certain to follow my  report of this affair.\"    A little fellow stepped out.    \"You claim to be a gentleman,\" he said, distinctly, \"but you will prove  yourself a cad if you peach.\"    \"I had rather be a cad than a ruffian, sir!\"    \"If you were a gentleman you would take your medicine like a gentleman.  You'd never squeal.\"    \"You fellows are the ones who are squealing now, for you see you have  been imposing on the wrong man.\"    \"Man!\" shot back the little fellow, contemptuously. \"There's not much  man about a chap that blows when he is hazed a little.\"    \"A little! a little! Is this what you call a little?\"    \"Oh, this is nothing. Think of what the poor freshies used to go through  in the old days of Delta Kappa and Signa Epsilon. Why, sometimes a  fellow would be roasted so his skin would smell like burned steak for a  week.\"    \"That was when he was burned at the stake,\" said a chap in the  background, and there was a universal dismal groan.    \"This is some of the Delta Kappa machinery here,\" the little fellow  explained. \"Sometimes some of the fellows come here to have a cold bot  and hot lob. You freshies walked right in on us to-night, and we gave  you a pleasant reception. Now, if you blow I'll guarantee you'll never  become a soph. The fellows will do you, and do you dirty, before your  first year is up.\"    \"Such threats do not frighten me,\" haughtily flung back the lad from  Virginia. \"I know this was a put-up job, and Bruce Browning was in it.  He got us to come here. Frank Merriwell knew something about it, or he'd  never been so ready to come. And I know you, too, Tad Horner.\"    The little fellow fell back a step, and then, with a sudden angry  impulse, he tore off his mask, showing a flushed, chubby, boyish face,  from which a pair of great blue eyes flashed at Diamond.    \"Well, I am Tad Horner!\" he cried, \"and I'm not ashamed of it! If you  want to throw me down, go ahead. It will be a low, dirty trick, and will  show the kind of big stuff you are!\"    The masked lads were surprised, for Tad had never exhibited such spirit  before. He had always seemed like a mild, shy, mother-boy sort of chap.  He had been hazed and had cried; but he wouldn't beg and he never  squealed. After that Browning had taken him under his wing, had fought  his battles, and had stood by him through the freshman year. Anybody who  was looking for trouble could find it by imposing on Horner; and  Browning, for all of his laziness, could fight like a tiger when he was  aroused.    Some of the students clapped their hands in approbation of Tad's plain  words, and there was a general stir. One fellow proposed that everybody  unmask, so that all would be on a level with Horner, but the little  fellow quickly cried:    \"Don't do it! You'd all be spotted, and the faculty would know who to  investigate if anything should happen to Diamond. If I'm fired, I want  you fellows to settle with him for me.\"    \"We'll do it--we'll do it, Tad!\" cried more than twenty voices.    Diamond showed his white, even teeth and laughed shortly.    \"Perhaps you think that will scare me,\" he sneered. \"If so, you will  find I am not bluffed so easily.\"    \"We are not trying to scare you,\" declared another of the masked  students, \"but you'll find we are in earnest if you blow.\"    \"Well, you will find I am in earnest, and I do not care for you all.\"    The boys began to despair, for they saw that Diamond was determined and  obstinate, and it would be no easy thing to induce him to abandon his  intention of reporting the hazing. If he did so, Browning and Horner  would find themselves in deep trouble, and others might become involved  during the investigation. It was not probable that the consequences  would be serious for Merriwell, who would be able to prove his innocence  in the matter.    What could be done?    The boys fell to discussing the matter in little groups, and not a few  expressed regret that Tad Horner had unmasked, as an alibi could have  been arranged for him if he had not done so. Now he would be too proud  to permit them to try anything of the sort, and he would tell the truth  about his connection with the affair if the truth were demanded of him.    \"We're in a bad box,\" said one"]]]
