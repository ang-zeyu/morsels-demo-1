Mangita grew worse  and worse, but finally, when it seemed as if she would soon die,  the door opened and the old woman to whom she had been so kind came  into the room. She had a bag of seeds in her hand, and taking one  she gave it to Mangita, who soon showed signs of being better, but  was so weak that she could not give thanks.    The old woman then gave the bag to Larina and told her to give a seed  to her sister every hour until she returned. She then went away and  left the girls alone.    Larina watched her sister, but did not give her a single seed. Instead,  she hid them in her own long hair and paid no attention to Mangita's  moans of pain.    The poor girl's cries grew weaker and weaker, but not a seed would  her cruel sister give her. In fact, Larina was so jealous that she  wished her sister to die.    When at last the old woman returned, poor Mangita was at the point of  death. The visitor bent over the sick girl and then asked her sister  if she had given Mangita the seeds. Larina showed her the empty bag  and said she had given them as directed. The old woman searched the  house, but of course could not find the seeds. She then asked Larina  again if she had given them to Mangita. Again the cruel girl said  that she had done so.    Suddenly the room was filled with a blinding light, and when Larina  could see once more, in place of the old woman stood a beautiful  fairy holding the now well Mangita in her arms.    She pointed to Larina and said, \"I am the poor woman who asked for  rice. I wished to know your hearts. You were cruel and Mangita was  kind, so she shall live with me in my island home in the lake. As for  you, because you tried to do evil to your good sister, you shall sit  at the bottom of the lake forever, combing out the seeds you have  hidden in your hair.\" Then, she clapped her hands and a number of  elves appeared and carried the struggling Larina away.    \"Come,\" said the fairy to Mangita, and she carried her to her beautiful  home, where she lives in peace and happiness.    As for Larina, she sits at the bottom of the lake and combs her  hair. As she combs a seed out, another comes in, and every seed that  is combed out becomes a green plant that floats out of the lake and  down the Pasig.    And to this day people can see them, and know that Larina is being  punished for her wickedness.        How the World Was Made    This is the ancient Filipino account of the creation.    Thousands of years ago there was no land nor sun nor moon nor stars,  and the world was only a great sea of water, above which stretched  the sky. The water was the kingdom of the god Maguayan, and the sky  was ruled by the great god Captan.    Maguayan had a daughter called Lidagat, the sea, and Captan had a  son known as Lihangin, the wind. The gods agreed to the marriage of  their children, so the sea became the bride of the wind.    Three sons and a daughter were born to them. The sons were called  Licalibutan, Liadlao, and Libulan, and the daughter received the name  of Lisuga.    Licalibutan had a body of rock and was strong and brave; Liadlao  was formed of gold and was always happy; Libulan was made of copper  and was weak and timid; and the beautiful Lisuga had a body of pure  silver and was sweet and gentle. Their parents were very fond of them,  and nothing was wanting to make them happy.    After a time Lihangin died and left the control of the winds to his  eldest son Licalibutan. The faithful wife Lidagat soon followed her  husband, and the children, now grown up, were left without father or  mother. However, their grandfathers, Captan and Maguayan, took care  of them and guarded them from all evil.    After a time, Licalibutan, proud of his power over the winds, resolved  to gain more power, and asked his brothers to join him in an attack on  Captan in the sky above. At first they refused; but when Licalibutan  became angry with them, the amiable Liadlao, not wishing to offend  his brother, agreed to help. Then together they induced the timid  Libulan to join in the plan.    When all was ready the three brothers rushed at the sky, but they  could not beat down the gates of steel that guarded the entrance. Then  Licalibutan let loose the strongest winds and blew the bars in every  direction. The brothers rushed into the opening, but were met by  the angry god Captan. So terrible did he look that they turned and  ran in terror; but Captan, furious at the destruction of his gates,  sent three bolts of lightning after them.    The first struck the copper Libulan and melted him into a ball. The  second struck the golden Liadlao and he too was melted. The third  bolt struck Licalibutan and his rocky body broke into many pieces  and fell into the sea. So huge was he that parts of his body stuck  out above the water and became what is known as land.    In the meantime the gentle Lisuga had missed her brothers and started  to look for them. She went toward the sky, but as she approached the  broken gates, Captan, blind with anger, struck her too with lightning,  and her silver body broke into thousands of pieces.    Captan then came down from the sky and tore the sea apart, calling  on Maguayan to come to him and accusing him of ordering the attack on  the sky. Soon Maguayan appeared and answered that he knew nothing of  the plot as he had been asleep far down in the sea. After a time he  succeeded in calming the angry Captan. Together they wept at the loss  of their grandchildren, especially the gentle and beautiful Lisuga; but  with all their power they could not restore the dead to life. However,  they gave to each body a beautiful light that will shine forever.    And so it was that golden Liadlao became the sun and copper Libulan  the moon, while the thousands of pieces of silver Lisuga shine as  the stars of heaven. To wicked Licalibutan the gods gave no light,  but resolved to make his body support a new race of people. So Captan  gave Maguayan a seed and he planted it on the land, which, as you will  remember, was part of Licalibutan's huge body. Soon a bamboo tree grew  up, and from the hollow of one of its branches a man and a woman came  out. The man's name was Sicalac, and the woman was called Sicabay. They  were the parents of the human race. Their first child was a son whom  they called Libo; afterwards they had a daughter who was known as  Saman. Pandaguan was a younger son and he had a son called Arion.    Pandaguan was very clever and invented a trap to catch fish. The very  first thing he caught was a huge shark. When he brought it to land,  it looked so great and fierce that he thought it was surely a god,  and he at once ordered his people to worship it. Soon all gathered  around and began to sing and pray to the shark. Suddenly the sky and  sea opened, and the gods came out and ordered Pandaguan to throw the  shark back into the sea and to worship none but them.    All were afraid except Pandaguan. He grew very bold and answered that  the shark was as big as the gods, and that since he had been able to  overpower it he would also be able to conquer the gods. Then Captan,  hearing this, struck Pandaguan with a small thunderbolt, for he did not  wish to kill him but merely to teach him a lesson. Then he and Maguayan  decided to punish these people by scattering them over the earth,  so they carried some to one land and some to another. Many children  were afterwards born, and thus the earth became inhabited in all parts.    Pandaguan did not die. After lying on the ground for thirty days he  regained his strength, but his body was blackened from the lightning,  and all his descendants ever since that day have been black.    His first son, Arion, was taken north, but as he had been born before  his father's punishment he did not lose his color, and all his people  therefore are white.    Libo and Saman were carried south, where the hot sun scorched their  bodies and caused all their descendants to be of a brown color.    A son of Saman and a daughter of Sicalac were carried east, where the  land at first was so lacking in food that they were compelled to eat  clay. On this account their children and their children's children  have always been yellow in color.    And so the world came to be made and peopled. The sun and moon shine in  the sky and the beautiful stars light up the night. All over the land,  on the body of the envious Licalibutan, the children of Sicalac and  Sicabay have grown great in numbers. May they live forever in peace  and brotherly love!        The Silver Shower    Every night in Manila, when the bells of the city boom out the Angelus  and lights begin to appear in the windows, the walks are filled with  people hurrying toward the bay. In the streets hundreds of carriages,  their lamps twinkling like fireflies, speed quickly by, as the cocheros  urge on the little Filipino ponies. All are bound for the Luneta to  hear the evening concert.    A pretty place is the Luneta, the garden spot of the city. It is laid  out in elliptical form and its green lawns are covered with benches  for the people. A broad driveway surrounds it and hundreds of electric  lights transform the night into day.    A band stand is located at each end of the oval, and at night concerts  are given by the military bands.    Thousands of people gather to listen to the music. The bright uniforms  of officers and men, the white dresses of American ladies, the black  mantillas of the dark-eyed senoritas, and the gayly colored camisas  of the Filipino girls show that the beauty and chivalry of Manila  have assembled at the concert.    The band plays many beautiful selections and finally closes with the  \"Star-Spangled Banner.\" At once every head is bared and all stand  at rigid attention till the glorious old song is finished. Then the  musicians disperse, the carriages drive away, and people return to  their homes.

Whether the particular matter he investigates has a solid, a  liquid, or a gaseous form depends upon its rate of vibration.  If  it is a liquid, by raising its rate of vibration one third it  becomes a gas;  by reducing it one third it becomes a solid.    Each kind of matter has vibration only through one octave.  It is  known to us only by its vibration in that octave.  Each kind of  matter has a different octave--is set on a higher or lower key,  so to speak, but all octaves of vibration are between the highest  of hydrogen gas and the lowest of carbon.    In mechanical compounds, such as air or brass, the rate of  vibration of the compound is the least common multiple of the two  or more rates.  In chemical compounds, such as water or alcohol,  the rate is that of the highest, the others uniting in harmonic  fractions.    All matter as we know it through our senses--prakriti, as it is  called in the Secret Doctrine to distinguish it from non-sensual  matter--is the vibration of an universal Something, we do not  know what, through these different octaves.  The elementary  substances (so-called) are one and the same thing--this  Something--in different keys and chords of vibration;  keys that  run into one another, producing all sorts of beautiful harmonies.    Taking any one of these elements, or any of their compounds, all  we know of it is limited strictly to its changes during vibration  through one octave.  What happens when the vibration goes above  or below the octave has not yet been treated hypothetically.    While some elements are vibrating on higher and some on lower  keys, we can consider them all as vibrating within one great  octave, that octave of the universal Something which produces  sensual matter, or prakriti.    But matter is not confined, we know, to this great octave,  although our sensual knowledge of it is strictly confined to it.  How do we know it?    Knowledge comes to us in two ways, and there are two kinds of  knowledge.    1. That which comes through our senses, by observation and  experience.  This includes reasoning from relation.    2. That which comes through intuition--or, as some writers  inaccurately say, \"through the formal laws of thought.\"    All the observation and experience of the rising and the setting  of the sun for a thousand centuries could only have confirmed the  first natural belief that it revolved daily around the earth;  nor by joining this experience with other experiences could any  deduction have come from our reason that would have opposed it.  Not our reason but our intuition said that the sun stood still  and the earth revolved daily.  The oldest books in existence tell  us that this axial revolution of the earth was not only known in  the very dawn of time but that it has been known to every race  (except our own of European savages) from before the time thought  was first transmitted by writing.    Ask the ablest living geographer or physicist to prove to you  that the earth revolves daily and he will reply that it would be  the job of his life.  It can be done at great expense and great  labor, but that is because we know the answer and can invent a  way of showing it, not because there are any observations from  which a deduction would naturally follow.    Nearly if not all our great discoveries have come to us through  intuition and not from observation and experience.  When we know  the lines on which to work, when intuition has given us the KEY,  then the observation and experience men prize so highly, and the  reason they worship so devoutly, will fill in the details.  The  knowledge that flows from observation and the reasoning from the  facts it records, is never more than relatively true, it is  always limited by the facts, and any addition to the facts  requires the whole thing to be restated.  We never know all the  facts;  seldom even the more important;  and reason grasps only  details.    Lamarck's theory of evolution, known to all Asiatic races from  time immemorial, was the intuitional and absolute knowledge that  comes to all men when they reach a certain stage of development.  Reason could never have furnished it from the facts, as Cuvier  proved in the great debate in the French Academy in 1842, when he  knocked Lamarck out, for the time being, because \"it did not  conform to the facts, and did not follow from any relation of the  facts.\"    Darwin's theory of the survival of the fittest in the struggle  for existence, as an explanation of the origin of species, was  from observation and experience.  It was based on observed facts.  But Darwin was an evolutionist--a disciple of Lamarck.  He held  the Key.  He used the Key.  The value of Darwin's work does not  lie in his discovering that some bugs have been derived from  other bugs and that the intermediate bugs have died off.  Its  overwhelming value to mankind was in showing that work on the  theory of evolution was correct work and that the theory was  true.  When the intuition of man points out the way the reason of  man can follow the path and macadam the road.  It usually does  and claims all the credit for itself as the original discoverer.    This knowledge through intuition is absolute and exact.  It is  not relatively true.  It is absolutely and invariably true.  No  additional facts will ever modify it, or require a restatement.    When Sir William Hamilton based his Logic on the dictum that \"All  knowledge is relative, and only relatively true,\" the proposition  was self-evidently false.  It was in itself a statement of  absolute knowledge about a certain thing.  It was in itself  knowledge that was not relative.  All knowledge could not be  relative if this knowledge was not.  This knowledge could not  be either absolute or relative without upsetting his whole  proposition, for, if relative, then it was not always true;  and if absolute, then it was never true.    Sir William did not know the distinction between the two kinds of  knowledge, and what he meant to say was that \"All knowledge  obtained by observation and experience is relative, and only  relatively true.\"    His knowledge of this relativity was not obtained by observation  or from reason.  It could not possibly have been obtained in that  way.  It came from intuition, and it was absolute and exact.  A  man may have absolute and exact knowledge and yet not be able to  put it into words that exactly express it to another.  Hamilton  had this knowledge.  But it was not clearly formulated even in  his own mind.  He had two separate and distinct meanings for the  word \"knowledge,\" without being conscious of it.    We have yet to coin a proper word to express what comes to us  through intuition.  The old English word \"wisdom\" originally did.  The old verb \"wis\" was meant what a man knew without being told  it, as \"ken\" meant knowledge by experience.  Try and prove by  reason that a straight line is the shortest distance between two  points, or that a part can never be greater than the whole, and  your reason has an impossible task.  \"You must take them for  axioms,\" it says.  You must take them because you wis them, not  because you know (ken) them.    Intuitional knowledge must not be confounded with the relative  knowledge that flows through the reason:  that \"If the sum of two  numbers is one and their difference is five,\" the numbers are  minus two and plus three.    The point cannot be too strongly enforced that there is a  distinction between the sources of what we know, and that while  all we know through our sensations is only relatively true, that  which we know from intuition is invariably and absolutely true.  This is seen through a glass darkly, in theology, where intuition  is called inspiration and not differentiated from reason.    The false notion that we can only learn by observation and  experience, that the concept can never transcend the observation,  that we can only know what we can prove to our senses, has  wrought incalculable injury to progress in philosophy.    Because our sensual knowledge of matter begins and ends with  vibration in one octave it does not follow that this ends our  knowledge of it.  We may have intuitional knowledge, and this  intuitional knowledge is as susceptible to reason as if we had  obtained it by observation.    The knowledge that comes through intuition tells us of matter  vibrating in another great octave just beyond our own, which  Science has chosen to name the etheric octave, or plane.  The  instant our intuition reveals the cause of phenomena our reason  drops in and tells us it is the chording vibration of the matter  of the two planes--the physical and etheric--that produces all  physical phenomena.  It goes further and explains its variations.    This knowledge of another octave or plane of matter comes from  the logical relations of matter and its physical phenomena;  but  there was nothing in the observation or experience of mankind  that would have led us to infer from reason an etheric plane of  matter.  It was \"revealed\" truth.  But the flash of revelation  having once made the path apparent, the light of reason carries  us through all the winding ways.  Our knowledge of the ether is  not guess-work or fancy, any more than our geometry is, because  it is based on axioms our reason cannot prove.  In both cases the  basic axioms are obtained from intuition;  the structural work  from reason.  Our knowledge of the ether may be as absolute and  exact as our knowledge of prakriti, working on physical as we  work on geometrical axioms.    The recognition of the two sources of knowledge, the work of the  spirit within us and of the mind within us, is absolutely  necessary to correctly comprehend the true significance of the  results of modern science and to accept the ancient.
