Such a man is Louis Sullivan, though it must be admitted that not  always has he achieved success. That success was so marked, however,  in his treatment of the problem of the tall building, and exercised  subconsciously such a spell upon the minds even of his critics and  detractors, that it resulted in the emancipation of this type of  building from an absurd and impossible convention--the practice,  common before his time, of piling order upon order, like a house  of cards, or by a succession of strongly marked string courses  emphasizing the horizontal dimension of a vertical edifice, thus  vitiating the finest effect of which such a building is capable.    The problem of the tall building, with which his predecessors dealt  always with trepidation and equivocation, Mr. Sullivan approached  with confidence and joy. \"What,\" he asked himself, \"is the chief  characteristic of the tall office building? It is lofty. This  loftiness is to the artist-nature its thrilling aspect. It must be  tall. The force of altitude must be in it. It must be every inch a  proud and soaring thing, rising in sheer exultation that from bottom  to top it is a unit without a dissenting line.\" The Prudential  (Guaranty) building in Buffalo represents the finest concrete  embodiment of his idea achieved by Mr. Sullivan. It marks his  emancipation from what he calls his \"masonry\" period, during which  he tried, like so many other architects before and since, to make a  steel-framed structure look as though it were nothing but a masonry  wall perforated with openings--openings too many and too great not  to endanger its stability. The keen blade of Mr. Sullivan's mind cut  through this contradiction, and in the Prudential building he carried  out the idea of a _protective casing_ so successfully that Montgomery  Schuyler said of it, \"I know of no steel framed building in which the  metallic construction is more palpably felt through the envelope of  baked clay.\"    [Illustration: PLATE III. THE PRUDENTIAL BUILDING, BUFFALO N.Y.]    The present author can speak with all humbleness of the general  failure, on the part of the architectural profession, to appreciate  the importance of this achievement, for he pleads guilty of day after  day having passed the Prudential building, then fresh in the majesty  of its soaring lines, and in the wonder of its fire-wrought casing,  with eyes and admiration only for the false romanticism of the Erie  County Savings Bank, and the empty bombast of the gigantic Ellicott  Square. He had not at that period of his life succeeded in living down  his architectural training, and as a result the most ignorant layman  was in a better position to appraise the relative merits of these  three so different incarnations of the building impulse than was he.    Since the Prudential building there have been other tall office  buildings, by other hands, truthful in the main, less rigid, less  monotonous, more superficially pleasing, yet they somehow fail to  impart the feeling of utter sincerity and fresh originality inspired  by this building. One feels that here democracy has at last found  utterance in beauty; the American spirit speaks, the spirit of the  Long Denied. This rude, rectangular bulk is uncompromisingly practical  and utilitarian; these rows on rows of windows, regularly spaced, and  all of the same size, suggest the equality and monotony of obscure,  laborious lives; the upspringing shafts of the vertical piers stand  for their hopes and aspirations, and the unobtrusive, delicate  ornament which covers the whole with a garment of fresh beauty is like  the very texture of their dreams. The building is able to speak  thus powerfully to the imagination because its creator is a poet  and prophet of democracy. In his own chosen language he declares, as  Whitman did in verse, his faith in the people of \"these states\"--\"A  Nation announcing itself.\" Others will doubtless follow who will make  a richer music, commensurate with the future's richer life, but such  democracy as is ours stands here proclaimed, just as such feudalism  as is still ours stands proclaimed in the Erie County Bank just across  the way. The massive rough stone walls of this building, its pointed  towers and many dormered chateau-like roof unconsciously symbolize the  attempt to impose upon the living present a moribund and alien  order. Democracy is thus afflicted, and the fact must needs find  architectural expression.    In the field of domestic architecture these dramatic contrasts are  less evident, less sharply marked. Domestic life varies little from  age to age; a cottage is a cottage the world over, and some manorial  mansion on the James River, built in Colonial days, remains a fitting  habitation (assuming the addition of electric lights and sanitary  plumbing) for one of our Captains of Industry, however little an  ancient tobacco warehouse would serve him as a place of business.  This fact is so well recognized that the finest type of modern country  house follows, in general, this or some other equally admirable model,  though it is amusing to note the millionaire's preference for a feudal  castle, a French chateau, or an Italian villa of the decadence.    The \"man of moderate means,\" so called, provides himself with  no difficulty with a comfortable house, undistinguished but  unpretentious, which fits him like a glove. There is a piazza towards  the street, a bay-window in the living room, a sleeping-porch for the  children, and a box of a garage for the flivver in the bit of a back  yard.    For the wage earner the housing problem is not so easily nor  so successfully solved. He is usually between the devil of the  speculative builder and the deep sea of the predatory landlord, each  intent upon taking from him the limit that the law allows and giving  him as little as possible for his money. Going down the scale of  indigence we find an itinerancy amounting almost to homelessness, or  houses so abject that they are an insult to the very name of home.    [Illustration: PLATE IV: THE ERIE COUNTY SAVINGS BANK, BUFFALO, N.Y.]    It is an eloquent commentary upon our national attitude toward a most  vital matter that in this feverish hustle to produce ships, airplanes,  clothing and munitions on a vast scale, the housing of the workers was  either overlooked entirely, or received eleventh-hour consideration,  and only now, after a year of participation in the war, is it  beginning to be adequately and officially dealt with--how efficiently  and intelligently remains to be seen. The housing of the soldiers was  another matter: that necessity was plain and urgent, and the miracle  has been accomplished, but except by indirection it has contributed  nothing to the permanent housing problem.    Other aspects of our life which have found architectural expression  fall neither in the commercial nor in the domestic category--the great  hotels, for example, which partake of the nature of both, and our  passenger railway terminals, which partake of the nature of neither.  These latter deserve especial consideration in this connection, by  reason of their important function. The railway is of the very essence  of the modern, even though (with what sublime unreason) Imperial Rome  is written large over New York's most magnificent portal.    Think not that in an age of unfaith mankind gives up the building  of temples. Temples inevitably arise where the tide of life flows  strongest; for there God manifests, in however strange a guise. That  tide is nowhere stronger than in the railroad, which is the arterial  system of our civilization. All arteries lead to and from the heart,  and thus the railroad terminus becomes the beating heart at the center  of modern life. It is a true instinct therefore which prompts to  the making of the terminal building a very temple, a monument to  the conquest of space through the harnessing of the giant horses of  electricity and steam. This conquest must be celebrated on a scale  commensurate with its importance, and in obedience to this necessity  the Pennsylvania station raised its proud head amid the push-cart  architecture of that portion of New York in which it stands. It is not  therefore open to the criticism often passed upon it, that it is too  grand, but it is the wrong kind of grandeur. If there be truth in the  contention that the living needs of today cannot be grafted upon the  dead stump of any ancient grandeur, the futility of every attempt to  accomplish this impossible will somehow, somewhere, reveal itself to  the discerning eye. Let us seek out, in this building, the place of  this betrayal.    It is not necessarily in the main facade, though this is not a face,  but a mask--and a mask can, after its kind, always be made beautiful;  it is not in the nobly vaulted corridor, lined with shops--for all we  know the arcades of Imperial Rome were similarly lined; nor is it in  the splendid vestibule, leading into the magnificent waiting room, in  which a subject of the Caesars would have felt more perfectly at home,  perhaps, than do we. But beyond this passenger concourse, where the  elevators and stairways descend to the tracks, necessity demanded the  construction of a great enclosure, supported only on slender columns  and far-flung trusses roofed with glass. Now latticed columns, steel  trusses, and wire glass are inventions of the modern world too useful  to be dispensed with. Rome could not help the architect here. The mode  to which he was inexorably self-committed in the rest of the building  demanded massive masonry, cornices, mouldings; a tribute to Caesar  which could be paid everywhere but in this place. The architect's  problem then became to reconcile two diametrically different systems."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12629"],[0,"Language: An Introduction to the Study of Speech (#3)"],[1,"ch; there are only organs that are incidentally useful in the  production of speech sounds. The lungs, the larynx, the palate, the  nose, the tongue, the teeth, and the lips, are all so utilized, but they  are no more to be thought of as primary organs of speech than are the  fingers to be considered as essentially organs of piano-playing or the  knees as organs of prayer. Speech is not a simple activity that is  carried on by one or more organs biologically adapted to the purpose. It  is an extremely complex and ever-shifting network of adjustments--in the  brain, in the nervous system, and in the articulating and auditory  organs--tending towards the desired end of communication. The lungs  developed, roughly speaking, in connection with the necessary  biological function known as breathing; the nose, as an organ of smell;  the teeth, as organs useful in breaking up food before it was ready for  digestion. If, then, these and other organs are being constantly  utilized in speech, it is only because any organ, once existent and in  so far as it is subject to voluntary control, can be utilized by man for  secondary purposes. Physiologically, speech is an overlaid function, or,  to be more precise, a group of overlaid functions. It gets what service  it can out of organs and functions, nervous and muscular, that have come  into being and are maintained for very different ends than its own.    It is true that physiological psychologists speak of the localization of  speech in the brain. This can only mean that the sounds of speech are  localized in the auditory tract of the brain, or in some circumscribed  portion of it, precisely as other classes of sounds are localized; and  that the motor processes involved in speech (such as the movements of  the glottal cords in the larynx, the movements of the tongue required to  pronounce the vowels, lip movements required to articulate certain  consonants, and numerous others) are localized in the motor tract  precisely as are all other impulses to special motor activities. In the  same way control is lodged in the visual tract of the brain over all  those processes of visual recognition involved in reading. Naturally the  particular points or clusters of points of localization in the several  tracts that refer to any element of language are connected in the brain  by paths of association, so that the outward, or psycho-physical, aspect  of language, is of a vast network of associated localizations in the  brain and lower nervous tracts, the auditory localizations being without  doubt the most fundamental of all for speech. However, a speechsound  localized in the brain, even when associated with the particular  movements of the \"speech organs\" that are required to produce it, is  very far from being an element of language. It must be further  associated with some element or group of elements of experience, say a  visual image or a class of visual images or a feeling of relation,  before it has even rudimentary linguistic significance. This \"element\"  of experience is the content or \"meaning\" of the linguistic unit; the  associated auditory, motor, and other cerebral processes that lie  immediately back of the act of speaking and the act of hearing speech  are merely a complicated symbol of or signal for these \"meanings,\" of  which more anon. We see therefore at once that language as such is not  and cannot be definitely localized, for it consists of a peculiar  symbolic relation--physiologically an arbitrary one--between all  possible elements of consciousness on the one hand and certain selected  elements localized in the auditory, motor, and other cerebral and  nervous tracts on the other. If language can be said to be definitely  \"localized\" in the brain, it is only in that general and rather useless  sense in which all aspects of consciousness, all human interest and  activity, may be said to be \"in the brain.\" Hence, we have no recourse  but to accept language as a fully formed functional system within man's  psychic or \"spiritual\" constitution. We cannot define it as an entity in  psycho-physical terms alone, however much the psycho-physical basis is  essential to its functioning in the individual.    From the physiologist's or psychologist's point of view we may seem to  be making an unwarrantable abstraction in desiring to handle the subject  of speech without constant and explicit reference to that basis.  However, such an abstraction is justifiable. We can profitably discuss  the intention, the form, and the history of speech, precisely as we  discuss the nature of any other phase of human culture--say art or  religion--as an institutional or cultural entity, leaving the organic  and psychological mechanisms back of it as something to be taken for  granted. Accordingly, it must be clearly understood that this  introduction to the study of speech is not concerned with those aspects  of physiology and of physiological psychology that underlie speech. Our  study of language is not to be one of the genesis and operation of a  concrete mechanism; it is, rather, to be an inquiry into the function  and form of the arbitrary systems of symbolism that we term languages.    I have already pointed out that the essence of language consists in the  assigning of conventional, voluntarily articulated, sounds, or of their  equivalents, to the diverse elements of experience. The word \"house\" is  not a linguistic fact if by it is meant merely the acoustic effect  produced on the ear by its constituent consonants and vowels, pronounced  in a certain order; nor the motor processes and tactile feelings which  make up the articulation of the word; nor the visual perception on the  part of the hearer of this articulation; nor the visual perception of  the word \"house\" on the written or printed page; nor the motor processes  and tactile feelings which enter into the writing of the word; nor the  memory of any or all of these experiences. It is only when these, and  possibly still other, associated experiences are automatically  associated with the image of a house that they begin to take on the  nature of a symbol, a word, an element of language. But the mere fact of  such an association is not enough. One might have heard a particular  word spoken in an individual house under such impressive circumstances  that neither the word nor the image of the house ever recur in  consciousness without the other becoming present at the same time. This  type of association does not constitute speech. The association must be  a purely symbolic one; in other words, the word must denote, tag off,  the image, must have no other significance than to serve as a counter to  refer to it whenever it is necessary or convenient to do so. Such an  association, voluntary and, in a sense, arbitrary as it is, demands a  considerable exercise of self-conscious attention. At least to begin  with, for habit soon makes the association nearly as automatic as any  and more rapid than most.    But we have traveled a little too fast. Were the symbol \"house\"--whether  an auditory, motor, or visual experience or image--attached but to the  single image of a particular house once seen, it might perhaps, by an  indulgent criticism, be termed an element of speech, yet it is obvious  at the outset that speech so constituted would have little or no value  for purposes of communication. The world of our experiences must be  enormously simplified and generalized before it is possible to make a  symbolic inventory of all our experiences of things and relations; and  this inventory is imperative before we can convey ideas. The elements of  language, the symbols that ticket off experience, must therefore be  associated with whole groups, delimited classes, of experience rather  than with the single experiences themselves. Only so is communication  possible, for the single experience lodges in an individual  consciousness and is, strictly speaking, incommunicable. To be  communicated it needs to be referred to a class which is tacitly  accepted by the community as an identity. Thus, the single impression  which I have had of a particular house must be identified with all my  other impressions of it. Further, my generalized memory or my \"notion\"  of this house must be merged with the notions that all other individuals  who have seen the house have formed of it. The particular experience  that we started with has now been widened so as to embrace all possible  impressions or images that sentient beings have formed or may form of  the house in question. This first simplification of experience is at the  bottom of a large number of elements of speech, the so-called proper  nouns or names of single individuals or objects. It is, essentially, the  type of simplification which underlies, or forms the crude subject of,  history and art. But we cannot be content with this measure of reduction  of the infinity of experience. We must cut to the bone of things, we  must more or less arbitrarily throw whole masses of experience together  as similar enough to warrant their being looked upon--mistakenly, but  conveniently--as identical. This house and that house and thousands of  other phenomena of like character are thought of as having enough in  common, in spite of great and obvious differences of detail, to be  classed under the same heading. In other words, the speech element  \"house\" is the symbol, first and foremost, not of a single perception,  nor even of the notion of a particular object, but of a \"concept,\" in  other words, of a convenient capsule of thought that embraces thousands  of distinct experiences and that is ready to take in thousands more. If  the single significant elements of speech are the symbols of concepts,  the actual flow of speech may be interpreted as a record of the setting  of these concepts into mutual relations.    The question has often been raised whether thought is possible without  speech; further, if"]]]
