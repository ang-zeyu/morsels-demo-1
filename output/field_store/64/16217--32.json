Not only does it  mean a mystery box and a box holding a somnambulist, but a kind of  treasury of tiny twisted thoughts. There is not one line or conception in  it on the grand scale, or even the grandiose. It is a devil's toy-house.  One feels like a mouse in a mouse-trap so small one cannot turn around.  In Intolerance, Griffith hurls nation at nation, race at race, century  against century, and his camera is not only a telescope across the plains  of Babylon, but across the ages. Griffith is, in Intolerance, the  ungrammatical Byron of the films, but certainly as magnificent as Byron,  and since he is the first of his kind I, for one, am willing to name him  with Marlowe.    But for technical study for Art Schools, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is  more profitable. It shows how masterpieces can be made, with the  second-hand furniture of any attic. But I hope fairy-tales, not  diabolical stories, will come from these attics. Fairy-tales are  inherent in the genius of the motion picture and are a thousand times  hinted at in the commercial films, though the commercial films are not  willing to stop to tell them. Lillian Gish could be given wings and a  wand if she only had directors and scenario writers who believed in  fairies. And the same can most heartily be said of Mae Marsh.    Chapter XI--Architecture-in-Motion, being a continuation of the argument  about the Splendor Pictures, in chapters five, six, and seven. This is an  element constantly re-illustrated in a magnificent but fragmentary way by  the News Films. Any picture of a seagull flying so close to the camera  that it becomes as large as a flying machine, or any flying machine made  by man and photographed in epic flight captures the eye because it is  architecture and in motion, motion which is the mysterious fourth  dimension of its grace and glory. So likewise, and in kind, any picture  of a tossing ship. The most superb example of architecture-in-motion in  the commercial history of the films is the march of the moving war-towers  against the walls of Babylon in Griffith's Intolerance. But Griffith is  the only person so far who has known how to put a fighting soul into a  moving tower.    The only real war that has occurred in the films with the world's  greatest war going on outside was Griffith's War Against Babylon. The  rest was news.    Chapter XII--Thirty Differences between the Photoplays and the Stage. The  argument of the whole of the 1915 edition has been accepted by the  studios, the motion picture magazines, and the daily motion picture  columns throughout the land. I have read hundreds of editorials and  magazines, and scarcely one that differed from it in theory. Most of them  read like paraphrases of this work. And of all arguments made, the one in  this chapter is the one oftenest accepted in its entirety. The people who  dominate the films are obviously those who grew up with them from the  very beginning, and the merely stage actors who rushed in with the  highest tide of prosperity now have to take second rank if they remain in  the films. But most of these have gone back to the stage by this time,  with their managers as well, and certainly this chapter is abundantly  proved out.    Chapter XIII--Hieroglyphics. One of the implications of this chapter and  the one preceding is that the fewer words printed on the screen the  better, and that the ideal film has no words printed on it at all, but is  one unbroken sheet of photography. This is admitted in theory in all the  studios now, though the only film of the kind ever produced of general  popular success was The Old Swimmin' Hole, acted by Charles Ray. If I  remember, there was not one word on the screen, after the cast of  characters was given. The whole story was clearly and beautifully told by  Photoplay Hieroglyphics. For this feature alone, despite many defects of  the film, it should be studied in every art school in America.    Meanwhile \"Title writing\" remains a commercial necessity. In this field  there is but one person who has won distinction--Anita Loos. She is one  of the four or five important and thoroughly artistic brains in the  photoplay game. Among them is the distinguished John Emerson. In  combination with John Emerson, director, producer, etc., she has done so  many other things well, her talents as a title writer are incidental, but  certainly to be mentioned in this place.    The outline we are discussing continues through    _Book III--More Personal Speculations and Afterthoughts Not Brought  Forward so Dogmatically_.    Chapter XIV--The Orchestra, Conversation, and the Censorship. In this  chapter, on page 189, I suggest suppressing the orchestra entirely and  encouraging the audience to talk about the film. No photoplay people have  risen to contradict this theory, but it is a chapter that once caused me  great embarrassment. With Christopher Morley, the well-known author of  Shandygaff and other temperance literature, I was trying to prove out  this chapter. As soon as the orchestra stopped, while the show rolled on  in glory, I talked about the main points in this book, illustrating it by  the film before us. Almost everything that happened was a happy  illustration of my ideas. But there were two shop girls in front of us  awfully in love with a certain second-rate actor who insisted on kissing  the heroine every so often, and with her apparent approval. Every time we  talked about that those shop girls glared at us as though we were robbing  them of their time and money. Finally one of them dragged the other out  into the aisle, and dashed out of the house with her dear chum, saying,  so all could hear: \"Well, come on, Terasa, we might as well go, if these  two talking _pests_ are going to keep this up behind us.\" The poor girl's  voice trembled. She was in tears. She was gone before we could apologize  or offer flowers. So I say in applying this chapter, in our present stage  of civilization, sit on the front seat, where no one can hear your  whisperings but Mary Pickford on the screen. She is but a shadow there,  and will not mind.    Chapter XV--The Substitute for the Saloon. I leave this argument as a  monument, just as it was written, in 1914 and '15. It indicates a certain  power of forecasting on the part of the writer. We drys have certainly  won a great victory. Some of the photoplay people agree with this  temperance sermon, and some of them do not. The wets make one mistake  above all. They do not realize that the drys can still keep on voting  dry, with intense conviction, and great battle cries, and still have a  sense of humor.    Chapter XVI--California and America. This chapter was quoted and  paraphrased almost bodily as the preface to my volume of verses, The  Golden Whales of California. \"I Know All This When Gipsy Fiddles Cry,\" a  song of some length recently published in the New Republic and the London  Nation, further expresses the sentiment of this chapter in what I hope is  a fraternal way, and I hope suggests the day when California will have  power over India, Asia, and all the world, and plant giant redwood trees  of the spirit the world around.    Chapter XVII--Progress and Endowment. I allow this discourse, also, to  stand as written in 1914 and '15. It shows the condition just before the  war, better than any new words of mine could do it. The main change now  is the growing hope of a backing, not only from Universities, but great  Art Museums.    Chapter XVIII--Architects as Crusaders. The sermon in this chapter has  been carried out on a limited scale, and as a result of the suggestion,  or from pure American instinct, we now have handsome gasoline filling  stations from one end of America to the other, and really gorgeous Ford  garages. Our Union depots and our magazine stands in the leading hotels,  and our big Soda fountains are more and more attractive all the time.  Having recited of late about twice around the United States and,  continuing the pilgrimage, I can testify that they are all alike from New  York to San Francisco. One has to ask the hotel clerk to find out whether  it is New York or ----. And the motion picture discipline of the American  eye has had a deal to do with this increasing tendency to news-stand and  architectural standardization and architectural thinking, such as it is.  But I meant this suggestion to go further, and to be taken in a higher  sense, so I ask these people to read this chapter again. I have carried  out the idea, in a parable, perhaps more clearly in The Golden Book of  Springfield, when I speak of the World's Fair of the University of  Springfield, to be built one hundred years hence. And I would recommend  to those who have already taken seriously chapter eighteen, to reread it  in two towns, amply worth the car fare it costs to go to both of them.  First, Santa Fe, New Mexico, at the end of the Santa Fe Trail, the oldest  city in the United States, the richest in living traditions, and with the  oldest and the newest architecture in the United States; not a stone or a  stick of it standardized, a city with a soul, Jerusalem and Mecca and  Benares and Thebes for any artist or any poet of America's future, or  any one who would dream of great cities born of great architectural  photoplays, or great photoplays born of great cities. And the other city,  symbolized by The Golden Rain Tree in The Golden Book of Springfield, is  New Harmony, Indiana. That was the Greenwich Village of America more than  one hundred years ago, when it was yet in the heart of the wilderness,  millions of miles from the sea. It has a tradition already as dusty and  wonderful as Abydos and Gem Aten. And every stone is still eloquent of  individualism, and standardization has not yet set its foot there. Is it  not possible for the architects to brood in such places and then say to  one another:--\"Build from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13030"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 09 (#3)"],[1,"on, with aggravating  burdensomeness, to the inevitable crisis.    In the fall of 1844 Hebbel journeyed from Paris to Rome. He had met few  notables in Paris--Heine, Felix Bamberg, and Arnold Ruge almost complete  the tale--but in Italy he, like Goethe, made the acquaintance of a group  of German artists, and followed their leadership in the study of ancient  art. He enjoyed this study in natural, unaffected appreciation of the  beautiful; and a certain artistic polish distinguishes the poems which  nature and art in Italy inspired him to write. The Italian journey,  however, was far from being a renaissance to him as it had been to  Goethe. Hebbel remained a Northern artist. Vesuvius impressed him, but  Pompeii proved a disappointment; it was laid out, he said, like any  other city. He departed from Rome in October, 1845, richer in the  friendship of distinguished men--including Hermann Hettner--and in  accumulated experience, but not as one to whom the _Ponte Molle_ is a  bridge of sighs.    Hebbel's design was to return to Hamburg by way of Vienna. In Vienna,  which he reached on the fourth of November, 1845, he was cordially  received in literary circles. Men of influence promised their good  offices in getting his plays performed, but failed to take effective  measures, and he was about to continue his journey when the romantic  enthusiasm of two young barons Zerboni gave him an _entree_ into  aristocratic society, and he tarried. Ere long he had decided to stay  for life. In Christine Enghaus, the leading lady at the  _Hofburgtheater_, he found the feminine counterpart to his masculine  nature; and on the twenty-sixth of May, 1846, they were married.    From every point of view this marriage proved so perfect that we may  well question whether anything whatever ought to have been allowed to  stand in the way of it. To Elise, of course, it seemed an outrage--the  more so that she was entirely mistaken as to the character of Christine;  and with furious bitterness she reproached Hebbel for violating her most  sacred rights in his infatuation for an actress. The storm broke, but it  cleared the air for both; and upon the death of her second son in 1847,  Elise came at Christine's invitation to Vienna and spent a year in the  Hebbel household.    Hebbel himself rightly dated an epoch in his life from his marriage and  the renewed productivity which followed upon it. He enjoyed now for the  first time not only freedom from economic worries but also complete  serenity of mind. Outwardly, indeed, he still had to keep up his  offensive and defensive warfare. Beyond the circle of his immediate  adherents, only the more enlightened of his contemporaries, such as  Ruge, Hettner, and Theodor Vischer, perceived what he was aiming at, and  his own public discussions were so abstruse and repellent that it is no  wonder they were misunderstood. Grillparzer declared that he was groping  in esthetic fog. Julian Schmidt recognized his power and the poetic  charm of many of his passages, but thought him in danger of crossing the  line which separates sense from nonsense, genius from insanity. Hebbel  was restive under criticism, and the method of his polemics tended  rather to exasperate than to conciliate his adversaries. Meanwhile  _Maria Magdalena_ and _Judith_ were performed at the _Hofburgtheater_,  with Christine as the heroine. But in 1850 Heinrich Laube became  director of this theatre, and he not only rejected one play of Hebbel's  after another, but also withdrew from Christine the leading parts which  she had heretofore taken in the regular repertory.    The new epoch in Hebbel's dramatic activity really began in 1848. The  fruits of his sojourn in Italy, _A Tragedy in Sicily_ (1846), _Julia_  (1847), and _New Poems_ (published in 1847) were mediocre stragglers in  the train of his first successes. But _Herodes and Mariamne_, begun in  1847 and completed in November, 1848, is the first of a new series of  masterpieces. Mariamne, Hebbel said, was not simply written for  Christine, she _was_ Christine. _The Ruby_, which followed in the spring  of 1849, is a graceful dramatization of a fairy-tale written ten years  before in Munich; _Michel Angelo_ (1850), a satire on his critics, is a  slight but clever refutation of ignorant presumption. _Agnes Bernauer_  (1851) is a worthy successor of _Herodes and Mariamne_; _Gyges and his  Ring_ (1854) is the most poetic and perhaps the most characteristic of  his dramas. The trilogy on the _Nibelungen_ (1855-1860) was Hebbel's  last great work, ranking with Grillparzer's _Golden Fleece_ and  Schiller's _Wallenstein_; and if he had lived to complete _Demetrius_,  we should have had another remarkable drama, on a subject which Schiller  too was destined to leave unfinished.    In the fifties, Hebbel accompanied Christine on professional trips to  North Germany, and had ample occasion to observe the spread of his  influence. In 1852 he was feted at Munich in connection with the  production there of _Agnes Bernauer_. In 1858 he attended a performance  of _Genoveva_ in Weimar, and was decorated with an order by the Grand  Duke. In 1861 the Nibelungen trilogy was performed for the first time in  Weimar, with Christine as Brunhild and Kriemhild; and in the following  year Hebbel, who had even thought of going to live at Weimar, was the  guest of the Grand Duke at his castle in Wilhelmsthal. Though in Vienna  honors came later, Hebbel felt himself to be during these years at the  summit of his existence. In 1855 he bought a country home at Orth near  Gmunden in the Salzkammergut, and to the idyllic atmosphere of that  retreat he owed the inspiration for the epic poem _Mother and Child_  (1857), his gentlest treatment of a tragic theme. In 1857 he issued a  definitive edition of his _Poems_, dedicated to Uhland, \"the first poet  of the present time.\" In 1854 _Genoveva_, in modified form, was  successfully presented as _Magellone_ at the _Burgtheater_, with  Christine as the heroine. But Hebbel's first Viennese triumph did not  come until February 19, 1863, when Christine played Brunhild in the  first and second parts of the _Nibelungen_. On his deathbed he received  the news that the Berlin Schiller Prize had been awarded to him for the  _Nibelungen_. Hebbel died on the thirteenth of December, 1863. Christine  out-lived him by nearly half a century, until the twenty-ninth of June,  1910.    Rightly or wrongly, Hebbel regarded himself as the creator of a new form  of drama, setting in at a step beyond Shakespeare and Schiller, and  attacking problems in the manner suggested, but not fully developed, by  Goethe. Shakespeare and Schiller, he said, locate the conflict in the  breast of the hero: shall he, or shall he not, endeavor to attain the  object of his desire, against forces which oppose him from without, and  which have their allies in his own conscience, in his own sense of right  and wrong? He desires the wrong, or neglects the right, and for his  tragic fault atones with death. We pity the unfortunate individual,  console ourselves, however, with the inviolability of the moral law, and  profit by his example: only those are free whose will chooses to be  moral. But Goethe, in the dramatically conceived _Elective Affinities_,  focuses attention not upon the doings of individuals, but upon the  sanctions of the law which a power superior to their wills forces them  to break. And so Hebbel, passing over the individual, as one of myriads,  directs inquiry into the causes that make him what he is, that make him  do what he does, that prevent him from doing what at the same time they  impel him to attempt; and he reveals, back of the individual typical  phenomenon, an irreconcilable conflict in the very condition and  definition of its existence. This conflict has its roots in the dualism  of all being.    The corner-stone of Martin Luther's system of morals was the paradox: \"A  Christian is a sovereign lord over all things, and is subject to nobody;  a Christian is a duty-bound servant of all things, and is subject to  everybody.\" In other words, a man's soul is his own and is superior to  all the things of the flesh; but through his body he is made dependent  upon the life-giving earth, and subject to the laws which those other  \"bodies\" in the community in which he lives make for the common defense  and the general welfare. Hebbel carried the antithesis farther, asking  what is the soul, and what is the body? And he answered, in effect, that  the soul is indeed the very essence of personality, but is no original,  self-begotten, and self-sufficient entity--on the contrary, it is a  fragment, a participant in the animating principle of the universe--and  that the body is indeed the medium of contact between person and person,  but is also the separating barrier of soul from soul, and of the  individual soul from the soul of the world. The body is the form or  vessel which vouchsafes to the soul individual existence, and which the  soul, by its very impulse to activity, wears out and destroys. Birth is  a prophecy of destruction and a doom to death.    But life is activity, the soul is a motive force, self-assertion and  self-preservation are heaven's first law. Self-assertion, however, is  nothing but the operation of communicated and committed animation, and  self-preservation nothing but the postponement of the day of surrender.  Self-preservation is impossible; self-assertion is a challenge to the  assertiveness of other selves, as well as a hastener of dissolution. The  self follows its native bent, and its native impulse is for expansion;  but it thus, as a fraction, leaves, on its centrifugal path, the course  of the great world spirit from which it separates; and as both a  separate entity and a member of a community it must, in its attempt at  self-realization, meet the constraint which the community, whose only  object is likewise self-realization and self-preservation"]]]
