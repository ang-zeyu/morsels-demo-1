[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11560"],[0,"The Barbarism of Berlin (#3)"],[1," The vow is to the man what the song is to the bird, or the bark  to the dog; his voice, whereby he is known. Just as a man who cannot keep  an appointment is not fit even to fight a duel, so the man who cannot keep  an appointment with himself is not sane enough even for suicide. It is not  easy to mention anything on which the enormous apparatus of human life can  be said to depend. But if it depends on anything, it is on this frail cord,  flung from the forgotten hills of yesterday to the invisible mountains of  to-morrow. On that solitary string hangs everything from Armageddon to an  almanac, from a successful revolution to a return ticket. On that solitary  string the Barbarian is hacking heavily, with a sabre which is fortunately  blunt.    Anyone can see this well enough, merely by reading the last negotiations  between London and Berlin. The Prussians had made a new discovery in  international politics: that it may often be convenient to make a promise;  and yet curiously inconvenient to keep it. They were charmed, in their  simple way, with this scientific discovery, and desired to communicate it  to the world. They therefore promised England a promise, on condition that  she broke a promise, and on the implied condition that the new promise  might be broken as easily as the old one. To the profound astonishment of  Prussia, this reasonable offer was refused! I believe that the astonishment  of Prussia was quite sincere. That is what I mean when I say that the  Barbarian is trying to cut away that cord of honesty and clear record on  which hangs all that men have made.    The friends of the German cause have complained that Asiatics and Africans  upon the very verge of savagery have been brought against them from  India and Algiers. And in ordinary circumstances, I should sympathise  with such a complaint made by a European people. But the circumstances  are not ordinary. Here, again, the quiet unique barbarism of Prussia  goes deeper than what we call barbarities. About mere barbarities, it  is true, the Turco and the Sikh would have a very good reply to the  superior Teuton. The general and just reason for not using non-European  tribes against Europeans is that given by Chatham against the use of the  Red Indian: that such allies might do very diabolical things. But the  poor Turco might not unreasonably ask, after a week-end in Belgium, what  more diabolical things he _could_ do than the highly cultured Germans  were doing themselves. Nevertheless, as I say, the justification of any  extra-European aid goes deeper than any such details. It rests upon  the fact that even other civilisations, even much lower civilisations,  even remote and repulsive civilisations, depend as much as our own on  this primary principle, on which the super-morality of Potsdam declares  open War. Even savages promise things; and respect those who keep their  promises. Even Orientals write things down: and though they write them  from right to left, they know the importance of a scrap of paper. Many  merchants will tell you that the word of the sinister and almost unhuman  Chinaman is often as good as his bond: and it was amid palm trees and  Syrian pavilions that the great utterance opened the tabernacle to him that  sweareth to his hurt and changeth not. There is doubtless a dense labyrinth  of duplicity in the East, and perhaps more guile in the individual Asiatic  than in the individual German. But we are not talking of the violations  of human morality in various parts of the world. We are talking about a  new and inhuman morality, which denies altogether the day of obligation.  The Prussians have been told by their literary men that everything depends  upon Mood: and by their politicians that all arrangements dissolve before  \"necessity.\" That is the importance of the German Chancellor's phrase. He  did not allege some special excuse in the case of Belgium, which might  make it seem an exception that proved the rule. He distinctly argued, as  on a principle applicable to other cases, that victory was a necessity  and honour was a scrap of paper. And it is evident that the half-educated  Prussian imagination really cannot get any farther than this. It cannot  see that if everybody's action were entirely incalculable from hour to  hour, it would not only be the end of all promises, but the end of all  projects. In not being able to see that, the Berlin philosopher is really  on a lower mental level than the Arab who respects the salt, or the Brahmin  who preserves the caste. And in this quarrel we have a right to come with  scimitars as well as sabres, with bows as well as rifles, with assegai  and tomahawk and boomerang, because there is in all these at least a seed  of civilisation that these intellectual anarchists would kill. And if  they should find us in our last stand girt with such strange swords and  following unfamiliar ensigns, and ask us for what we fight in so singular  a company, we shall know what to reply: \"We fight for the trust and for  the tryst; for fixed memories and the possible meeting of men; for all  that makes life anything but an uncontrollable nightmare. We fight for the  long arm of honour and remembrance; for all that can lift a man above the  quicksands of his moods, and give him the mastery of time.\"          II    THE REFUSAL OF RECIPROCITY      In the last summary I suggested that Barbarism, as we mean it, is not mere  ignorance or even mere cruelty. It has a more precise sense, and means  militant hostility to certain necessary human ideas. I took the case of the  vow or the contract, which Prussian intellectualism would destroy. I urged  that the Prussian is a spiritual Barbarian, because he is not bound by his  own past, any more than a man in a dream. He avows that when he promised  to respect a frontier on Monday, he did not foresee what he calls \"the  necessity\" of not respecting it on Tuesday. In short, he is like a child,  who at the end of all reasonable explanations and reminders of admitted  arrangements has no answer except \"But I _want_ to.\"    There is another idea in human arrangements so fundamental as to be  forgotten; but now for the first time denied. It may be called the idea  of reciprocity; or, in better English, of give and take. The Prussian  appears to be quite intellectually incapable of this thought. He cannot,  I think, conceive the idea that is the foundation of all comedy; that, in  the eyes of the other man, he is only the other man. And if we carry this  clue through the institutions of Prussianised Germany, we shall find how  curiously his mind has been limited in the matter. The German differs from  other patriots in the inability to understand patriotism. Other European  peoples pity the Poles or the Welsh for their violated borders; but Germans  only pity themselves. They might take forcible possession of the Severn or  the Danube, of the Thames or the Tiber, of the Garry or the Garonne--and  they would still be singing sadly about how fast and true stands the watch  on Rhine; and what a shame it would be if anyone took their own little  river away from them. That is what I mean by not being reciprocal: and you  will find it in all that they do: as in all that is done by savages.    Here, again, it is very necessary to avoid confusing this soul of the  savage with mere savagery in the sense of brutality or butchery; in which  the Greeks, the French and all the most civilised nations have indulged in  hours of abnormal panic or revenge. Accusations of cruelty are generally  mutual. But it is the point about the Prussian that with him nothing is  mutual. The definition of the true savage does not concern itself even with  how much more he hurts strangers or captives than do the other tribes of  men. The definition of the true savage is that he laughs when he hurts you;  and howls when you hurt him. This extraordinary inequality in the mind is  in every act and word that comes from Berlin. For instance, no man of the  world believes all he sees in the newspapers; and no journalist believes a  quarter of it. We should, therefore, be quite ready in the ordinary way to  take a great deal off the tales of German atrocities; to doubt this story  or deny that. But there is one thing that we cannot doubt or deny: the seal  and authority of the Emperor. In the Imperial proclamation the fact that  certain \"frightful\" things have been done is admitted; and justified on  the ground of their frightfulness. It was a military necessity to terrify  the peaceful populations with something that was not civilised, something  that was hardly human. Very well. That is an intelligible policy: and in  that sense an intelligible argument. An army endangered by foreigners  may do the most frightful things. But then we turn the next page of the  Kaiser's public diary, and we find him writing to the President of the  United States, to complain that the English are using dum-dum bullets  and violating various regulations of the Hague Conference. I pass for  the present the question of whether there is a word of truth in these  charges. I am content to gaze rapturously at the blinking eyes of the True,  or Positive, Barbarian. I suppose he would be quite puzzled if we said that  violating the Hague Conference was \"a military necessity\" to us; or that  the rules of the Conference were only a scrap of paper. He would be quite  pained if we said that dum-dum bullets, \"by their very frightfulness,\"  would be very useful to keep conquered Germans in order. Do what he will,  he cannot get outside the idea that he, because he is he and not you, is  free to break the law; and also to appeal to the law. It is said that the  Prussian officers play at a game called Kriegsspiel, or the War Game. But  in truth they could not play at any game; for the essence of every game is  that the rules are the same on both sides.    But taking every German institution in turn, the case is the same;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11565"],[0,"Friends, though divided: A Tale of the Civil War (#3)"],[1,"war. Many  details have been omitted, the object being not to teach the history of  the time, but to show the general course of events which had led to so  broad and strange a division between the people of England. Even now,  after an interval of two hundred years, men still discuss the subject  with something like passion, and are as strong in their sympathies  toward one side or the other as in the days when their ancestors took up  arms for king or Commons.    It is with the story of the war which followed the conversation of Harry  Furness and Herbert Rippinghall that we have to do, not with that of the  political occurrences which preceded it. As to these, at least, no  doubts or differences of opinion can arise. The incidents of the war,  its victories and defeats, its changing fortunes, and its final triumph  are matters beyond the domain of politics, or of opinion; and indeed  when once the war began politics ceased to have much further sway. The  original questions were lost sight of, and men fought for king or  Parliament just as soldiers nowadays fight for England or France,  without in any concerning themselves with the original grounds of  quarrel.          CHAPTER II.    FOR THE KING.      It was late that evening when Sir Henry Furness returned from Oxford;  but Harry, anxious to hear the all-absorbing news of the day, had waited  up for him.    \"What news, father?\" he said, as Sir Henry alighted at the door.    \"Stirring news, Harry; but as dark as may be. War appears to be now  certain. The king has made every concession, but the more he is ready to  grant, the more those Puritan knaves at Westminster would force from  him. King, peers, bishops, Church, all is to go down before this knot of  preachers; and it is well that the king has his nobles and gentry still  at his back. I have seen Lord Falkland, and he has given me a commission  in the king's name to raise a troop of horse. The royal banner will be  hoisted at Nottingham, and there he will appeal to all his loyal  subjects for aid against those who seek to govern the nation.\"    \"And you think, sir, that it will really be war now?\" Harry asked.    \"Ay, that will it, unless the Commons go down on their knees and ask his  majesty's pardon, of which there is, methinks, no likelihood. As was to  be expected, the burghers and rabble of the large towns are everywhere  with them, and are sending up petitions to the Commons to stand fast and  abolish everything. However, the country is of another way of thinking,  and though the bad advisers of the king have in times past taken  measures which have sorely tried our loyalty, that is all forgotten  now. His majesty has promised redress to all grievances, and to rule  constitutionally in future, and I hear that the nobles are calling out  their retainers in all parts. England has always been governed by her  kings since she was a country, and we are going to try now whether we  are to be governed in future by our kings or by every tinker, tailor,  preacher, or thief sent up to Westminster. I know which is my choice,  and to-morrow I shall set about raising a troop of lads of the same  mind.\"    \"You mean to take me, sir, I hope,\" Harry said.    \"Take you?\" his lather repeated, laughing. \"To do what?\"    \"To fight, certainly,\" Harry replied. \"I am sure that among the tenants  there is not one who could use the small sword as I can, for you have  taught me yourself, and I do not think that I should be more afraid of  the London pikemen than the best of them.\"    \"No, no, Harry,\" his father said, putting his hand on the boy's  shoulder; \"I do not doubt your bravery. You come of a fighting stock  indeed, and good blood cannot lie. But you are too young, my boy.\"    \"But if the war goes on for a couple of years, father.\"    \"Ay, ay, my boy; but I hope that it will be ended in a couple of months.  If it should last--which God forbid!--you shall have your chance, never  fear. Or, Harry, should you hear that aught has happened to me, mount  your horse at once, my boy; ride to the army, and take your place at the  head of my tenants. They will of course put an older hand in command;  but so long as a Furness is alive, whatever be his age, he must ride at  the head of the Furness tenants to strike for the king. I hear, by the  way, Harry, that that Puritan knave, Rippinghall, the wool-stapler, is  talking treason among his hands, and says that he will add a brave  contingent to the bands of the Commons when they march hither. Hast  heard aught about it?\"    \"Nothing, father, but I hope it is not true. I know, however, that  Master Rippinghall's thoughts and opinions lie in that direction, for I  have heard from Herbert--\"    \"Ah, the son of the wool-stapler. Hark you, Harry, this is a time when  we must all take sides for or against the king. Hitherto I have  permitted your acquaintance with the wool-stapler's son, though, in  truth, he be by birth no fit companion for you. But times have changed  now. The sword is going to be drawn, and friends of the king can no  longer be grip hands with friends of the Commons. Did my own brother  draw sword for Parliament, we would never speak again. Dost hear?\"    \"Yes, sir; and will of course obey your order, should you determine that  I must speak no more to Herbert. But, as you say, I am a boy yet, too  young to ride to the wars, and Herbert is no older. It will be time for  us to quarrel when it is time for us to draw the sword.\"    \"That is so, Harry, and I do not altogether forbid you speaking with  him. Still the less you are seen together, the better. I like the lad,  and have made him welcome here for your sake. He is a thoughtful lad,  and a clever one; but it is your thoughtful men who plot treason, and  until the storm be overpast, it is best that you see as little of him as  may be. And now I have eaten my supper, and it is long past the time  that you should have been in bed. Send down word by Thomas Hardway to  Master Drake, my steward, to bid him send early in the morning notices  that all my tenants shall assemble here to-morrow at four in the  afternoon, and bid the cook come to me. We shall have a busy day  to-morrow, for the Furness tenantry never gather at the hall and go out  empty. And short though be the notice, they shall not do so this time,  which to some of us may, perchance, be the last.\"    The next day there was bustle and hurry at Furness Hall. The ponds were  dragged for fish; the poultry yard was scoured for its finest birds; the  keepers were early afield, and when they returned with piles of hares  and rabbits, these were seized by the cook and converted into huge pies  and pasties. Two sheep were slaughtered, and the scullions were hard at  work making confections of currants, gooseberries, plums, and other  fruits from the garden. In the great hall the tables were laid, and when  this was done, and all was in readiness, the serving men were called up  to the armory, and there, throughout the day, the cleaning of swords and  iron caps, the burnishing of breast and back pieces, the cleaning of  firelocks, and other military work went on with all haste.    The Furness estates covered many a square mile of Berkshire, and fifty  sturdy yeomen dismounted before Furness Hall at the hour named by Sir  Henry. A number of grooms and serving men were in attendance, and took  the horses as they rode up, while the major-domo conducted them to the  great picture gallery. Here they were received by Sir Henry with a  stately cordiality, and the maids handed round a great silver goblet  filled with spiced wine.    At four exactly the major-domo entered and announced that the quota was  complete, and that every one of those summoned was present.    \"Serve the tables then,\" Sir Henry said, as he led the Way to the great  dining-hall.    Sir Henry took the head of the broad table, and bade Harry sit on his  right hand, while the oldest of the tenants faced him at the opposite  end. Then a troop of servants entered bearing smoking joints, cold  boars' heads, fish, turkeys, geese, and larded capons. These were  placed upon the table, with an abundance of French wine, and of strong  ale for those who preferred it, to wash down the viands. The first  courses were followed by dishes of meats and confections, and when all  was finished and cleared away Sir Henry Furness rose to his feet.    \"Fill your glasses all,\" he said; \"and bumpers. The toast which I give  you to-day is 'The king, God bless him.' Never should Englishmen drink  his health more earnestly and solemnly than to-day, when rebels have  driven him from his capital, and pestilent traitors threatened him with  armed force. Perhaps, my friends, you, like me, may from time to time  have grumbled when the tax-collectors have come round, and you have seen  no one warrant for their demands. But if the king has been forced so to  exceed his powers, it was in no slight degree because those at  Westminster refused to grant him the sums which were needful. He has,  too, been surrounded by bad advisers. I myself loved not greatly either  Stratford or Laud. But I would rather bear their high-handed ways, which  were at least aimed to strengthen the kingdom and for the honor of the  king, than be ground by these petty tyrants at Westminster, who would  shut up our churches, forbid us to smile on a Sunday, or to pray, except  through our noses; who would turn merry England into a canting  conventicle, and would rule us with a rod to which that of the king were  as a willow wand. Therefore it is the duty of all true men and good to  drink the health of his majesty the king, and confusion to his enemies.\"    Upstanding, and with enthusiastic shouts, the whole of the tenants drank  the toast. Sir Henry was pleased with the spirit which was manifested,  and when the cheering had subsided and quiet was again restored, he went  on:    \"My friends, I have summoned you here to tell you what many of you no"]]]
