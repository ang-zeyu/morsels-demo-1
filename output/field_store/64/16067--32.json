If they before  The Gospel liv'd, they serv'd not God aright;  And among such am I. For these defects,  And for no other evil, we are lost;  Only so far afflicted, that we live  Desiring without hope.\"  So grief assail'd  My heart at hearing this, for well I knew  Suspended in that Limbo many a soul  Of mighty worth.  \"O tell me, sire rever'd!  Tell me, my master!\"  I began through wish  Of full assurance in that holy faith,  Which vanquishes all error; \"say, did e'er  Any, or through his own or other's merit,  Come forth from thence, whom afterward was blest?\"       Piercing the secret purport of my speech,  He answer'd: \"I was new to that estate,  When I beheld a puissant one arrive  Amongst us, with victorious trophy crown'd.  He forth the shade of our first parent drew,  Abel his child, and Noah righteous man,  Of Moses lawgiver for faith approv'd,  Of patriarch Abraham, and David king,  Israel with his sire and with his sons,  Nor without Rachel whom so hard he won,  And others many more, whom he to bliss  Exalted.  Before these, be thou assur'd,  No spirit of human kind was ever sav'd.\"       We, while he spake, ceas'd not our onward road,  Still passing through the wood; for so I name  Those spirits thick beset.  We were not far  On this side from the summit, when I kenn'd  A flame, that o'er the darken'd hemisphere  Prevailing shin'd.  Yet we a little space  Were distant, not so far but I in part  Discover'd, that a tribe in honour high  That place possess'd.  \"O thou, who every art  And science valu'st!  who are these, that boast  Such honour, separate from all the rest?\"       He answer'd: \"The renown of their great names  That echoes through your world above, acquires  Favour in heaven, which holds them thus advanc'd.\"  Meantime a voice I heard: \"Honour the bard  Sublime!  his shade returns that left us late!\"  No sooner ceas'd the sound, than I beheld  Four mighty spirits toward us bend their steps,  Of semblance neither sorrowful nor glad.       When thus my master kind began: \"Mark him,  Who in his right hand bears that falchion keen,  The other three preceding, as their lord.  This is that Homer, of all bards supreme:  Flaccus the next in satire's vein excelling;  The third is Naso; Lucan is the last.  Because they all that appellation own,  With which the voice singly accosted me,  Honouring they greet me thus, and well they judge.\"       So I beheld united the bright school  Of him the monarch of sublimest song,  That o'er the others like an eagle soars.  When they together short discourse had held,  They turn'd to me, with salutation kind  Beck'ning me; at the which my master smil'd:  Nor was this all; but greater honour still  They gave me, for they made me of their tribe;  And I was sixth amid so learn'd a band.       Far as the luminous beacon on we pass'd  Speaking of matters, then befitting well  To speak, now fitter left untold.  At foot  Of a magnificent castle we arriv'd,  Seven times with lofty walls begirt, and round  Defended by a pleasant stream.  O'er this  As o'er dry land we pass'd.  Next through seven gates  I with those sages enter'd, and we came  Into a mead with lively verdure fresh.       There dwelt a race, who slow their eyes around  Majestically mov'd, and in their port  Bore eminent authority; they spake  Seldom, but all their words were tuneful sweet.       We to one side retir'd, into a place  Open and bright and lofty, whence each one  Stood manifest to view.  Incontinent  There on the green enamel of the plain  Were shown me the great spirits, by whose sight  I am exalted in my own esteem.       Electra there I saw accompanied  By many, among whom Hector I knew,  Anchises' pious son, and with hawk's eye  Caesar all arm'd, and by Camilla there  Penthesilea.  On the other side  Old King Latinus, seated by his child  Lavinia, and that Brutus I beheld,  Who Tarquin chas'd, Lucretia, Cato's wife  Marcia, with Julia and Cornelia there;  And sole apart retir'd, the Soldan fierce.       Then when a little more I rais'd my brow,  I spied the master of the sapient throng,  Seated amid the philosophic train.  Him all admire, all pay him rev'rence due.  There Socrates and Plato both I mark'd,  Nearest to him in rank; Democritus,  Who sets the world at chance, Diogenes,  With Heraclitus, and Empedocles,  And Anaxagoras, and Thales sage,  Zeno, and Dioscorides well read  In nature's secret lore.  Orpheus I mark'd  And Linus, Tully and moral Seneca,  Euclid and Ptolemy, Hippocrates,  Galenus, Avicen, and him who made  That commentary vast, Averroes.       Of all to speak at full were vain attempt;  For my wide theme so urges, that ofttimes  My words fall short of what bechanc'd.  In two  The six associates part.  Another way  My sage guide leads me, from that air serene,  Into a climate ever vex'd with storms:  And to a part I come where no light shines.        CANTO V    FROM the first circle I descended thus  Down to the second, which, a lesser space  Embracing, so much more of grief contains  Provoking bitter moans.  There, Minos stands  Grinning with ghastly feature: he, of all  Who enter, strict examining the crimes,  Gives sentence, and dismisses them beneath,  According as he foldeth him around:  For when before him comes th' ill fated soul,  It all confesses; and that judge severe  Of sins, considering what place in hell  Suits the transgression, with his tail so oft  Himself encircles, as degrees beneath  He dooms it to descend.  Before him stand  Always a num'rous throng; and in his turn  Each one to judgment passing, speaks, and hears  His fate, thence downward to his dwelling hurl'd.       \"O thou!  who to this residence of woe  Approachest?\"  when he saw me coming, cried  Minos, relinquishing his dread employ,  \"Look how thou enter here; beware in whom  Thou place thy trust; let not the entrance broad  Deceive thee to thy harm.\"  To him my guide:  \"Wherefore exclaimest?  Hinder not his way  By destiny appointed;  so 'tis will'd  Where will and power are one.  Ask thou no more.\"       Now 'gin the rueful wailings to be heard.  Now am I come where many a plaining voice  Smites on mine ear.  Into a place I came  Where light was silent all.  Bellowing there groan'd  A noise as of a sea in tempest torn  By warring winds.  The stormy blast of hell  With restless fury drives the spirits on  Whirl'd round and dash'd amain with sore annoy.  When they arrive before the ruinous sweep,  There shrieks are heard, there lamentations, moans,  And blasphemies 'gainst the good Power in heaven.       I understood that to this torment sad  The carnal sinners are condemn'd, in whom  Reason by lust is sway'd.  As in large troops  And multitudinous, when winter reigns,  The starlings on their wings are borne abroad;  So bears the tyrannous gust those evil souls.  On this side and on that, above, below,  It drives them:  hope of rest to solace them  Is none, nor e'en of milder pang.  As cranes,  Chanting their dol'rous notes, traverse the sky,  Stretch'd out in long array:  so I beheld  Spirits, who came loud wailing, hurried on  By their dire doom.  Then I:  \"Instructor!  who  Are these, by the black air so scourg'd?\"--\" The first  'Mong those, of whom thou question'st,\" he replied,  \"O'er many tongues was empress.  She in vice  Of luxury was so shameless, that she made  Liking be lawful by promulg'd decree,  To clear the blame she had herself incurr'd.  This is Semiramis, of whom 'tis writ,  That she succeeded Ninus her espous'd;  And held the land, which now the Soldan rules.  The next in amorous fury slew herself,  And to Sicheus' ashes broke her faith:  Then follows Cleopatra, lustful queen.\"       There mark'd I Helen, for whose sake so long  The time was fraught with evil; there the great  Achilles, who with love fought to the end.  Paris I saw, and Tristan; and beside  A thousand more he show'd me, and by name  Pointed them out, whom love bereav'd of life.       When I had heard my sage instructor name  Those dames and knights of antique days, o'erpower'd  By pity, well-nigh in amaze my mind  Was lost; and I began:  \"Bard!  willingly  I would address those two together coming,  Which seem so light before the wind.\"  He thus:  \"Note thou, when nearer they to us approach.  Then by that love which carries them along,  Entreat; and they will come.\"  Soon as the wind  Sway'd them toward us, I thus fram'd my speech:  \"O wearied spirits!  come, and hold discourse  With us, if by none else restrain'd.\"  As doves  By fond desire invited, on wide wings  And firm, to their sweet nest returning home,  Cleave the air, wafted by their will along;  Thus issu'd from that troop, where Dido ranks,  They through the ill air speeding; with such force  My cry prevail'd by strong affection urg'd.       \"O gracious creature and benign!  who go'st  Visiting, through this element obscure,  Us, who the world with bloody stain imbru'd;  If for a friend the King of all we own'd,  Our pray'r to him should for thy peace arise,  Since thou hast pity on our evil plight.  ()f whatsoe'er to hear or to discourse  It pleases thee, that will we hear, of that  Freely with thee discourse, while e'er the wind,  As now, is mute.  The land, that gave me birth,  Is situate on the coast, where Po descends  To rest in ocean with his sequent streams.       \"Love, that in gentle heart is quickly learnt,  Entangled him by that fair form, from me  Ta'en in such cruel sort, as grieves me still:  Love, that denial takes from none belov'd,  Caught me with pleasing him so passing well,  That, as thou see'st, he yet deserts me not.  Love brought us to one death:  Caina waits  The soul, who spilt our life.\"  Such were their words;  At hearing which downward I bent my looks,  And held them there so long, that the bard cried:  \"What art thou pond'ring?\"  I in answer thus:  \"Alas!  by what sweet thoughts, what fond desire  Must they at length to that ill"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10084"],[0,"Kazan (#3)"],[1,"end of the sledge, just beyond the reach of  Kazan's chain.    \"Got you, didn't I?\" he repeated, the effect of the liquor beginning to  show in the glitter of his eyes. \"Wonder who changed your name, Pedro.  And how the devil did _he_ come by you? Ho, ho, if you could only  talk--\"    They heard Thorpe's voice inside the tent. It was followed by a low  girlish peal of laughter, and McCready jerked himself erect. His face  blazed suddenly red, and he rose to his feet, dropping the flask in his  coat pocket. Walking around the fire, he tiptoed cautiously to the  shadow of a tree close to the tent and stood there for many minutes  listening. His eyes burned with a fiery madness when he returned to the  sledge and Kazan. It was midnight before he went into his own tent.    In the warmth of the fire, Kazan's eyes slowly closed. He slumbered  uneasily, and his brain was filled with troubled pictures. At times he  was fighting, and his jaws snapped. At others he was straining at the  end of his chain, with McCready or his mistress just out of reach. He  felt the gentle touch of the girl's hand again and heard the wonderful  sweetness of her voice as she sang to him and his master, and his body  trembled and twitched with the thrills that had filled him that night.  And then the picture changed. He was running at the head of a splendid  team--six dogs of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police--and his master was  calling him Pedro! The scene shifted. They were in camp. His master was  young and smooth-faced and he helped from the sledge another man whose  hands were fastened in front of him by curious black rings. Again it was  later--and he was lying before a great fire. His master was sitting  opposite him, with his back to a tent, and as he looked, there came out  of the tent the man with the black rings--only now the rings were gone  and his hands were free, and in one of them he carried a heavy club. He  heard the terrible blow of the club as it fell on his master's head--and  the sound of it aroused him from his restless sleep.    He sprang to his feet, his spine stiffening and a snarl in his throat.  The fire had died down and the camp was in the darker gloom that  precedes dawn. Through that gloom Kazan saw McCready. Again he was  standing close to the tent of his mistress, and he knew now that this  was the man who had worn the black iron rings, and that it was he who  had beaten him with whip and club for many long days after he had killed  his master. McCready heard the menace in his throat and came back  quickly to the fire. He began to whistle and draw the half-burned logs  together, and as the fire blazed up afresh he shouted to awaken Thorp  and Isobel. In a few minutes Thorpe appeared at the tent-flap and his  wife followed him out. Her loose hair rippled in billows of gold about  her shoulders and she sat down on the sledge, close to Kazan, and began  brushing it. McCready came up behind her and fumbled among the packages  on the sledge. As if by accident one of his hands buried itself for an  instant in the rich tresses that flowed down her back. She did not at  first feel the caressing touch of his fingers, and Thorpe's back was  toward them.    Only Kazan saw the stealthy movement of the hand, the fondling clutch of  the fingers in her hair, and the mad passion burning in the eyes of the  man. Quicker than a lynx, the dog had leaped the length of his chain  across the sledge. McCready sprang back just in time, and as Kazan  reached the end of his chain he was jerked back so that his body struck  sidewise against the girl. Thorpe had turned in time to see the end of  the leap. He believed that Kazan had sprung at Isobel, and in his horror  no word or cry escaped his lips as he dragged her from where she had  half fallen over the sledge. He saw that she was not hurt, and he  reached for his revolver. It was in his holster in the tent. At his feet  was McCready's whip, and in the passion of the moment he seized it and  sprang upon Kazan. The dog crouched in the snow. He made no move to  escape or to attack. Only once in his life could he remember having  received a beating like that which Thorpe inflicted upon him now. But  not a whimper or a growl escaped him.    [Illustration: \"Not another blow!\"]    And then, suddenly, his mistress ran forward and caught the whip poised  above Thorpe's head.    \"Not another blow!\" she cried, and something in her voice held him from  striking. McCready did not hear what she said then, but a strange look  came into Thorpe's eyes, and without a word he followed his wife into  their tent.    \"Kazan did not leap at me,\" she whispered, and she was trembling with a  sudden excitement. Her face was deathly white. \"That man was behind me,\"  she went on, clutching her husband by the arm. \"I felt him touch me--and  then Kazan sprang. He wouldn't bite _me_. It's the _man_! There's  something--wrong--\"    She was almost sobbing, and Thorpe drew her close in his arms.    \"I hadn't thought before--but it's strange,\" he said. \"Didn't McCready  say something about knowing the dog? It's possible. Perhaps he's had  Kazan before and abused him in a way that the dog has not forgotten.  To-morrow I'll find out. But until I know--will you promise to keep away  from Kazan?\"    Isobel gave the promise. When they came out from the tent Kazan lifted  his great head. The stinging lash had closed one of his eyes and his  mouth was dripping blood. Isobel gave a low sob, but did not go near  him. Half blinded, he knew that his mistress had stopped his punishment,  and he whined softly, and wagged his thick tail in the snow.    Never had he felt so miserable as through the long hard hours of the day  that followed, when he broke the trail for his team-mates into the  North. One of his eyes was closed and filled with stinging fire, and his  body was sore from the blows of the caribou lash. But it was not  physical pain that gave the sullen droop to his head and robbed his body  of that keen quick alertness of the lead-dog--the commander of his  mates. It was his spirit. For the first time in his life, it was broken.  McCready had beaten him--long ago; his master had beaten him; and  during all this day their voices were fierce and vengeful in his ears.  But it was his mistress who hurt him most. She held aloof from him,  always beyond they reach of his leash; and when they stopped to rest,  and again in camp, she looked at him with strange and wondering eyes,  and did not speak. She, too, was ready to beat him. He believed that,  and so slunk away from her and crouched on his belly in the snow. With  him, a broken spirit meant a broken heart, and that night he lurked in  one of the deepest shadows about the camp-fire and grieved alone. None  knew that it was grief--unless it was the girl. She did not move toward  him. She did not speak to him. But she watched him closely--and studied  him hardest when he was looking at McCready.    Later, after Thorpe and his wife had gone into their tent, it began to  snow, and the effect of the snow upon McCready puzzled Kazan. The man  was restless, and he drank frequently from the flask that he had used  the night before. In the firelight his face grew redder and redder, and  Kazan could see the strange gleam of his teeth as he gazed at the tent  in which his mistress was sleeping. Again and again he went close to  that tent, and listened. Twice he heard movement. The last time, it was  the sound of Thorpe's deep breathing. McCready hurried back to the fire  and turned his face straight up to the sky. The snow was falling so  thickly that when he lowered his face he blinked and wiped his eyes.  Then he went out into the gloom and bent low over the trail they had  made a few hours before. It was almost obliterated by the falling snow.  Another hour and there would be no trail--nothing the next day to tell  whoever might pass that they had come this way. By morning it would  cover everything, even the fire, if he allowed it to die down. McCready  drank again, out in the darkness. Low words of an insane joy burst from  his lips. His head was hot with a drunken fire. His heart beat madly,  but scarcely more furiously than did Kazan's when the dog saw that  McCready was returning _with a club_! The club he placed on end against  a tree. Then he took a lantern from the sledge and lighted it. He  approached Thorpe's tent-flap, the lantern in his hand.    \"Ho, Thorpe--Thorpe!\" he called.    There was no answer. He could hear Thorpe breathing. He drew the flap  aside a little, and raised his voice.    \"Thorpe!\"    Still there was no movement inside, and he untied the flap strings and  thrust in his lantern. The light flashed on Isobel's golden head, and  McCready stared at it, his eyes burning like red coals, until he saw  that Thorpe was awakening. Quickly he dropped the flap and rustled it  from the outside.    \"Ho, Thorpe!--Thorpe!\" he called again.    This time Thorpe replied.    \"Hello, McCready--is that you?\"    McCready drew the flap back a little, and spoke in a low voice.    \"Yes. Can you come out a minute? Something's happening out in the woods.  Don't wake up your wife!\"    He drew back and waited. A minute later Thorpe came quietly out of the  tent. McCready pointed into the thick spruce.    \"I'll swear there's some one nosing around the camp,\" he said. \"I'm  certain that I saw a man out there a few minutes ago, when I went for a  log. It's a good night for stealing dogs. Here--you take the lantern! If  I wasn't clean fooled, we'll find a trail in the snow.\"    He gave Thorpe the lantern and picked up the heavy club. A growl rose in  Kazan's throat, but he choked it back. He wanted to snarl forth his  warning, to leap at the end of his leash, but he knew that if he did  that, they would return and beat him. So he lay still, trembling and  shivering, and whining softly. He watched them until they  disappeared--and then waited--listened. At last he heard the"]]]
