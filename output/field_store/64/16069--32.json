By this and by that, my head hummeth like to a  hive of bees on a hot June day.\"    Then he clapped his horn to his lips and winded a blast that went  echoing sweetly down the forest paths.  \"Ay, marry,\" quoth he again,  \"thou art a tall lad, and eke a brave one, for ne'er, I bow, is there a  man betwixt here and Canterbury Town could do the like to me that thou  hast done.\"    \"And thou,\" quoth the stranger, laughing, \"takest thy cudgeling like a  brave heart and a stout yeoman.\"    But now the distant twigs and branches rustled with the coming of men,  and suddenly a score or two of good stout yeomen, all clad in Lincoln  green, burst from out the covert, with merry Will Stutely at their head.    \"Good master,\" cried Will, \"how is this?  Truly thou art all wet from  head to foot, and that to the very skin.\"    \"Why, marry,\" answered jolly Robin, \"yon stout fellow hath tumbled me  neck and crop into the water and hath given me a drubbing beside.\"    \"Then shall he not go without a ducking and eke a drubbing himself!\"  cried Will Stutely.  \"Have at him, lads!\"    Then Will and a score of yeomen leaped upon the stranger, but though  they sprang quickly they found him ready and felt him strike right and  left with his stout staff, so that, though he went down with press of  numbers, some of them rubbed cracked crowns before he was overcome.    \"Nay, forbear!\" cried Robin, laughing until his sore sides ached again.  \"He is a right good man and true, and no harm shall befall him. Now hark  ye, good youth, wilt thou stay with me and be one of my band? Three  suits of Lincoln green shalt thou have each year, beside forty marks in  fee, and share with us whatsoever good shall befall us. Thou shalt eat  sweet venison and quaff the stoutest ale, and mine own good right-hand  man shalt thou be, for never did I see such a cudgel player in all my  life before.  Speak!  Wilt thou be one of my good merry men?\"    \"That know I not,\" quoth the stranger surlily, for he was angry at being  so tumbled about.  \"If ye handle yew bow and apple shaft no better than  ye do oaken cudgel, I wot ye are not fit to be called yeomen in my  country; but if there be any man here that can shoot a better shaft than  I, then will I bethink me of joining with you.\"    \"Now by my faith,\" said Robin, \"thou art a right saucy varlet, sirrah;  yet I will stoop to thee as I never stooped to man before. Good Stutely,  cut thou a fair white piece of bark four fingers in breadth, and set it  fourscore yards distant on yonder oak. Now, stranger, hit that fairly  with a gray goose shaft and call thyself an archer.\"    \"Ay, marry, that will I,\" answered he.  \"Give me a good stout bow and a  fair broad arrow, and if I hit it not, strip me and beat me blue with  bowstrings.\"    Then he chose the stoutest bow among them all, next to Robin's own, and  a straight gray goose shaft, well-feathered and smooth, and stepping to  the mark--while all the band, sitting or lying upon the greensward,  watched to see him shoot--he drew the arrow to his cheek and loosed the  shaft right deftly, sending it so straight down the path that it clove  the mark in the very center. \"Aha!\" cried he, \"mend thou that if thou  canst\"; while even the yeomen clapped their hands at so fair a shot.    \"That is a keen shot indeed,\" quoth Robin.  \"Mend it I cannot, but mar  it I may, perhaps.\"    Then taking up his own good stout bow and nocking an arrow with care, he  shot with his very greatest skill.  Straight flew the arrow, and so true  that it lit fairly upon the stranger's shaft and split it into  splinters. Then all the yeomen leaped to their feet and shouted for joy  that their master had shot so well.    \"Now by the lusty yew bow of good Saint Withold,\" cried the stranger,  \"that is a shot indeed, and never saw I the like in all my life before!  Now truly will I be thy man henceforth and for aye.  Good Adam Bell[1]  was a fair shot, but never shot he so!\"      [1] Adam Bell, Clym o' the Clough, and William of Cloudesly were three    noted north-country bowmen whose names have been celebrated in many    ballads of the olden time.    \"Then have I gained a right good man this day,\" quoth jolly Robin.  \"What name goest thou by, good fellow?\"    \"Men call me John Little whence I came,\" answered the stranger.    Then Will Stutely, who loved a good jest, spoke up. \"Nay, fair little  stranger,\" said he, \"I like not thy name and fain would I have it  otherwise.  Little art thou indeed, and small of bone and sinew,  therefore shalt thou be christened Little John, and I will be thy  godfather.\"    Then Robin Hood and all his band laughed aloud until the stranger began  to grow angry.    \"An thou make a jest of me,\" quoth he to Will Stutely, \"thou wilt have  sore bones and little pay, and that in short season.\"    \"Nay, good friend,\" said Robin Hood, \"bottle thine anger, for the name  fitteth thee well.  Little John shall thou be called henceforth, and  Little John shall it be. So come, my merry men, we will prepare a  christening feast for this fair infant.\"    So turning their backs upon the stream, they plunged into the forest  once more, through which they traced their steps till they reached the  spot where they dwelled in the depths of the woodland. There had they  built huts of bark and branches of trees, and made couches of sweet  rushes spread over with skins of fallow deer. Here stood a great oak  tree with branches spreading broadly around, beneath which was a seat of  green moss where Robin Hood was wont to sit at feast and at merrymaking  with his stout men about him. Here they found the rest of the band, some  of whom had come in with a brace of fat does.  Then they all built great  fires and after a time roasted the does and broached a barrel of humming  ale. Then when the feast was ready they all sat down, but Robin placed  Little John at his right hand, for he was henceforth to be the second in  the band.    Then when the feast was done Will Stutely spoke up.  \"It is now time, I  ween, to christen our bonny babe, is it not so, merry boys?\" And \"Aye!  Aye!\" cried all, laughing till the woods echoed with their mirth.    \"Then seven sponsors shall we have,\" quoth Will Stutely, and hunting  among all the band, he chose the seven stoutest men of them all.    \"Now by Saint Dunstan,\" cried Little John, springing to his feet, \"more  than one of you shall rue it an you lay finger upon me.\"    But without a word they all ran upon him at once, seizing him by his  legs and arms and holding him tightly in spite of his struggles, and  they bore him forth while all stood around to see the sport. Then one  came forward who had been chosen to play the priest because he had a  bald crown, and in his hand he carried a brimming pot of ale. \"Now, who  bringeth this babe?\" asked he right soberly.    \"That do I,\" answered Will Stutely.    \"And what name callest thou him?\"    \"Little John call I him.\"    \"Now Little John,\" quoth the mock priest, \"thou hast not lived  heretofore, but only got thee along through the world, but henceforth  thou wilt live indeed. When thou livedst not thou wast called John  Little, but now that thou dost live indeed, Little John shalt thou be  called, so christen I thee.\" And at these last words he emptied the pot  of ale upon Little John's head.    Then all shouted with laughter as they saw the good brown ale stream  over Little John's beard and trickle from his nose and chin, while his  eyes blinked with the smart of it. At first he was of a mind to be angry  but found he could not, because the others were so merry; so he, too,  laughed with the rest. Then Robin took this sweet, pretty babe, clothed  him all anew from top to toe in Lincoln green, and gave him a good stout  bow, and so made him a member of the merry band.    And thus it was that Robin Hood became outlawed; thus a band of merry  companions gathered about him, and thus he gained his right-hand man,  Little John; and so the prologue ends. And now I will tell how the  Sheriff of Nottingham three times sought to take Robin Hood, and how he  failed each time.          PART FIRST  Telling how the Sheriff of Nottingham swore that he would deal dole to  Robing Hood.  Also, how he made three trials thereat, but missed each  time by a good bow's length.      Robin Hood and the Tinker    NOW IT WAS TOLD BEFORE how two hundred pounds were set upon Robin Hood's  head, and how the Sheriff of Nottingham swore that he himself would  seize Robin, both because he would fain have the two hundred pounds and  because the slain man was a kinsman of his own. Now the Sheriff did not  yet know what a force Robin had about him in Sherwood, but thought that  he might serve a warrant for his arrest as he could upon any other man  that had broken the laws; therefore he offered fourscore golden angels  to anyone who would serve this warrant.  But men of Nottingham Town knew  more of Robin Hood and his doings than the Sheriff did, and many laughed  to think of serving a warrant upon the bold outlaw, knowing well that  all they would get for such service would be cracked crowns; so that no  one came forward to take the matter in hand. Thus a fortnight passed, in  which time none came forward to do the Sheriff's business.  Then said  he, \"A right good reward have I offered to whosoever would serve my  warrant upon Robin Hood, and I marvel that no one has come to undertake  the task.\"    Then one of his men who was near him said, \"Good master, thou wottest  not the force that Robin Hood has about him and how little he cares for  warrant of king or sheriff. Truly, no one likes to go on this service,  for fear of cracked crowns and broken bones.\"    \"Then I hold all Nottingham men to be cowards,\" said the Sheriff.  \"And  let me see the man in all Nottinghamshire that dare disobey the warrant  of our sovereign lord King Harry, for, by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1015"],[0,"The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life (#3)"],[1,"besides the spare horses  led by Shaw and myself, an additional mule was driven along with us as a  reserve in case of accident.    After this summing up of our forces, it may not be amiss to glance at  the characters of the two men who accompanied us.    Delorier was a Canadian, with all the characteristics of the true Jean  Baptiste. Neither fatigue, exposure, nor hard labor could ever impair  his cheerfulness and gayety, or his obsequious politeness to his  bourgeois; and when night came he would sit down by the fire, smoke his  pipe, and tell stories with the utmost contentment. In fact, the prairie  was his congenial element. Henry Chatillon was of a different stamp.  When we were at St. Louis, several gentlemen of the Fur Company had  kindly offered to procure for us a hunter and guide suited for our  purposes, and on coming one afternoon to the office, we found there a  tall and exceedingly well-dressed man with a face so open and frank that  it attracted our notice at once. We were surprised at being told that it  was he who wished to guide us to the mountains. He was born in a little  French town near St. Louis, and from the age of fifteen years had been  constantly in the neighborhood of the Rocky Mountains, employed for the  most part by the Company to supply their forts with buffalo meat. As a  hunter he had but one rival in the whole region, a man named Cimoneau,  with whom, to the honor of both of them, he was on terms of the closest  friendship. He had arrived at St. Louis the day before, from the  mountains, where he had remained for four years; and he now only asked  to go and spend a day with his mother before setting out on another  expedition. His age was about thirty; he was six feet high, and very  powerfully and gracefully molded. The prairies had been his school;  he could neither read nor write, but he had a natural refinement and  delicacy of mind such as is rarely found, even in women. His manly face  was a perfect mirror of uprightness, simplicity, and kindness of heart;  he had, moreover, a keen perception of character and a tact that would  preserve him from flagrant error in any society. Henry had not the  restless energy of an Anglo-American. He was content to take things  as he found them; and his chief fault arose from an excess of easy  generosity, impelling him to give away too profusely ever to thrive in  the world. Yet it was commonly remarked of him, that whatever he might  choose to do with what belonged to himself, the property of others was  always safe in his hands. His bravery was as much celebrated in the  mountains as his skill in hunting; but it is characteristic of him that  in a country where the rifle is the chief arbiter between man and man,  Henry was very seldom involved in quarrels. Once or twice, indeed,  his quiet good-nature had been mistaken and presumed upon, but the  consequences of the error were so formidable that no one was ever known  to repeat it. No better evidence of the intrepidity of his temper could  be wished than the common report that he had killed more than thirty  grizzly bears. He was a proof of what unaided nature will sometimes do.  I have never, in the city or in the wilderness, met a better man than my  noble and true-hearted friend, Henry Chatillon.    We were soon free of the woods and bushes, and fairly upon the broad  prairie. Now and then a Shawanoe passed us, riding his little shaggy  pony at a \"lope\"; his calico shirt, his gaudy sash, and the gay  handkerchief bound around his snaky hair fluttering in the wind. At noon  we stopped to rest not far from a little creek replete with frogs and  young turtles. There had been an Indian encampment at the place, and  the framework of their lodges still remained, enabling us very easily  to gain a shelter from the sun, by merely spreading one or two blankets  over them. Thus shaded, we sat upon our saddles, and Shaw for the first  time lighted his favorite Indian pipe; while Delorier was squatted over  a hot bed of coals, shading his eyes with one hand, and holding a little  stick in the other, with which he regulated the hissing contents of the  frying-pan. The horses were turned to feed among the scattered bushes of  a low oozy meadow. A drowzy springlike sultriness pervaded the air, and  the voices of ten thousand young frogs and insects, just awakened into  life, rose in varied chorus from the creek and the meadows.    Scarcely were we seated when a visitor approached. This was an old  Kansas Indian; a man of distinction, if one might judge from his dress.  His head was shaved and painted red, and from the tuft of hair remaining  on the crown dangled several eagles' feathers, and the tails of two or  three rattlesnakes. His cheeks, too, were daubed with vermilion; his  ears were adorned with green glass pendants; a collar of grizzly bears'  claws surrounded his neck, and several large necklaces of wampum hung  on his breast. Having shaken us by the hand with a cordial grunt of  salutation, the old man, dropping his red blanket from his shoulders,  sat down cross-legged on the ground. In the absence of liquor we offered  him a cup of sweetened water, at which he ejaculated \"Good!\" and was  beginning to tell us how great a man he was, and how many Pawnees he  had killed, when suddenly a motley concourse appeared wading across the  creek toward us. They filed past in rapid succession, men, women, and  children; some were on horseback, some on foot, but all were alike  squalid and wretched. Old squaws, mounted astride of shaggy, meager  little ponies, with perhaps one or two snake-eyed children seated behind  them, clinging to their tattered blankets; tall lank young men on foot,  with bows and arrows in their hands; and girls whose native ugliness not  all the charms of glass beads and scarlet cloth could disguise, made up  the procession; although here and there was a man who, like our visitor,  seemed to hold some rank in this respectable community. They were the  dregs of the Kansas nation, who, while their betters were gone to hunt  buffalo, had left the village on a begging expedition to Westport.    When this ragamuffin horde had passed, we caught our horses, saddled,  harnessed, and resumed our journey. Fording the creek, the low roofs of  a number of rude buildings appeared, rising from a cluster of groves and  woods on the left; and riding up through a long lane, amid a profusion  of wild roses and early spring flowers, we found the log-church and  school-houses belonging to the Methodist Shawanoe Mission. The Indians  were on the point of gathering to a religious meeting. Some scores of  them, tall men in half-civilized dress, were seated on wooden benches  under the trees; while their horses were tied to the sheds and fences.  Their chief, Parks, a remarkably large and athletic man, was just  arrived from Westport, where he owns a trading establishment. Beside  this, he has a fine farm and a considerable number of slaves. Indeed the  Shawanoes have made greater progress in agriculture than any other tribe  on the Missouri frontier; and both in appearance and in character form a  marked contrast to our late acquaintance, the Kansas.    A few hours' ride brought us to the banks of the river Kansas.  Traversing the woods that lined it, and plowing through the deep sand,  we encamped not far from the bank, at the Lower Delaware crossing. Our  tent was erected for the first time on a meadow close to the woods, and  the camp preparations being complete we began to think of supper. An old  Delaware woman, of some three hundred pounds' weight, sat in the porch  of a little log-house close to the water, and a very pretty half-breed  girl was engaged, under her superintendence, in feeding a large flock of  turkeys that were fluttering and gobbling about the door. But no offers  of money, or even of tobacco, could induce her to part with one of her  favorites; so I took my rifle, to see if the woods or the river could  furnish us anything. A multitude of quails were plaintively whistling  in the woods and meadows; but nothing appropriate to the rifle was to be  seen, except three buzzards, seated on the spectral limbs of an old dead  sycamore, that thrust itself out over the river from the dense sunny  wall of fresh foliage. Their ugly heads were drawn down between their  shoulders, and they seemed to luxuriate in the soft sunshine that was  pouring from the west. As they offered no epicurean temptations, I  refrained from disturbing their enjoyment; but contented myself with  admiring the calm beauty of the sunset, for the river, eddying swiftly  in deep purple shadows between the impending woods, formed a wild but  tranquillizing scene.    When I returned to the camp I found Shaw and an old Indian seated on the  ground in close conference, passing the pipe between them. The old man  was explaining that he loved the whites, and had an especial partiality  for tobacco. Delorier was arranging upon the ground our service of tin  cups and plates; and as other viands were not to be had, he set before  us a repast of biscuit and bacon, and a large pot of coffee. Unsheathing  our knives, we attacked it, disposed of the greater part, and tossed the  residue to the Indian. Meanwhile our horses, now hobbled for the first  time, stood among the trees, with their fore-legs tied together, in  great disgust and astonishment. They seemed by no means to relish this  foretaste of what was before them. Mine, in particular, had conceived a  moral aversion to the prairie life. One of them, christened Hendrick,  an animal whose strength and hardihood were his only merits, and who  yielded to nothing but the cogent arguments of the whip, looked toward  us with an indignant countenance, as if he meditated avenging his  wrongs with a kick. The other, Pontiac, a good horse, though of plebeian  lineage, stood with his head drooping and his mane hanging about his  eyes, with the grieved and sulky air of a "]]]
