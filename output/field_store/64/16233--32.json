I shall therefore expect you without fail.  I beg you will not take my _badinage_ amiss. I am, with sincere esteem,    Your friend,    BEETHOVEN      232.    TO G. DEL RIO.    Your friend has no doubt told you of my intention to send for Carl early  to-morrow. I wish to place his mother in a more creditable position with  the neighborhood; so I have agreed to pay her the compliment of taking her  son to see her in the company of a third person. This is to be done once a  month.    As to all that is past, I beg you will never allude to it again, either in  speaking or writing, but forget it all--as I do.      233.    TO FRAU VON STREICHER.    I have been occupied in arranging my papers; an immense amount of patience  is required for such an affair as putting them in order, but having once  summoned it to our aid we must persevere, or the matter would never be  completed. My papers, both musical and unmusical, are nearly arranged at  last; it was like one of the seven labors of Hercules![1]    [Footnote 1: Ries (in Wegeler's _Notizen_) relates: \"Beethoven placed very  little value on the MSS. of his pieces written out by himself; when once  engraved they were usually scattered about the anteroom, or on the floor in  the middle of his apartment, together with other music. I often arranged  his music for him, but the moment Beethoven began to search for any piece,  it was all strewed about again.\"]      234.    TO FRAU VON STREICHER.    You see what servants are! [He had gone out and taken the key with him.]  Such is housekeeping! So long as I am ill, I would fain be on a different  footing with those around me; for dearly as I usually love solitude, it is  painful to me now, finding it scarcely possible, while taking baths and  medicine, to employ myself as usual,--to which is added the grievous  prospect that I may perhaps never get better. I place no confidence in my  present physician, who at length pronounces my malady to be _disease of the  lungs_. I will consider about engaging a housekeeper. If I could only have  the faintest hope, in this corrupt Austrian State, of finding an honest  person, the arrangement would be easily made; but--but!! [He wishes to hire  a piano and pay for it in advance; the tone to be as loud as possible, to  suit his defective hearing.]    Perhaps you do not know, though I have not always had one of your pianos,  that since 1809 I have invariably preferred yours.    It is peculiarly hard on me to be a burden on any one, being accustomed  rather to serve others than to be served by them.      235.    TO FRAU VON STREICHER.    I can only say that I am better; I thought much of death during the past  night, but such thoughts are familiar to me by day also.      236.    TO F. RIES,--LONDON.    Vienna, July 9, 1817.    MY DEAR FRIEND,--    The proposals in your esteemed letter of the 9th of June are very  flattering, and my reply will show you how much I value them. Were it not  for my unhappy infirmities, which entail both attendance and expense,  particularly on a journey to a foreign country, I would _unconditionally_  accept the offer of the Philharmonic Society. But place yourself in my  position, and consider how many more obstacles I have to contend with than  any other artist, and then judge whether my demands (which I now annex) are  unreasonable. I beg you will convey my conditions to the Directors of the  above Society, namely:--    1. I shall be in London early in January.    2. The two grand new symphonies shall be ready by that time; to become the  exclusive property of the Society.    3. The Society to give me in return 300 guineas, and 100 for my travelling  expenses, which will, however, amount to much more, as I am obliged to  bring a companion.    4. As I am now beginning to work at these grand symphonies for the Society,  I shall expect that (on receiving my consent) they will remit me here the  sum of 150 guineas, so that I may provide a carriage, and make my other  preparations at once for the journey.    5. The conditions as to my non-appearance in any other public orchestra, my  not directing, and the preference always to be given to the Society on the  offer of equal terms by them, are accepted by me; indeed, they would at all  events have been dictated by my own sense of honor.    6. I shall expect the aid of the Society in arranging one, or more, benefit  concerts in my behalf, as the case may be. The very friendly feeling of  some of the Directors in your valuable body, and the kind reception of my  works by all the artists, is a sufficient guaranty on this point, and will  be a still further inducement to me to endeavor not to disappoint their  expectations.    7. I request that I may receive the assent to and confirmation of these  terms, signed by three Directors in the name of the Society. You may easily  imagine how much I rejoice at the thoughts of becoming acquainted with the  worthy Sir George Smart [Music Director], and seeing you and Mr. Neate  again; would that I could fly to you myself instead of this letter!    Your sincere well wisher and friend,    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.    [P.S. ON A SEPARATE SHEET OF PAPER.]    DEAR RIES,--    I cordially embrace you! I have purposely employed another hand in my  answer to the Society, that you might read it more easily, and present it  to them. I place the most implicit reliance on your kindly feelings toward  me. I hope that the Philharmonic Society may accept my proposals, and they  may rest assured that I shall employ all my energies to fulfil in the most  satisfactory manner the flattering commission of so eminent a society of  artists. What is the strength of your orchestra? How many violins, &c.?  Have you _one or two sets of wind instruments_? Is the concert room large  and sonorous?      237.    TO ZMESKALL.    NUSSDORF, July 23, 1817.    MY DEAR GOOD ZMESKALL,--    I shall soon see you again in town. What is the proper price for fronting a  pair of boots? I have to pay my servant for this, who is always running  about.    I am really in despair at being condemned by my defective hearing to pass  the greater part of my life with this most odious class of people, and to  be in some degree dependent on them. To-morrow, early, my servant will call  on you, and bring me back a _sealed answer_.      238.    TO ZMESKALL.    August 12, 1817.    MY DEAR GOOD Z.,--    I heard of your indisposition with great regret. As for myself, I am often  in despair, and almost tempted to put an end to my life, for all these  remedies seem to have no end. May God have compassion on me, for I look  upon myself to be as good as lost! I have a great deal to say to you. That  this servant is a _thief_, I cannot doubt--he must be sent away; my health  requires living _at home_ and greater comfort. I shall be glad to have your  opinion on this point. If my condition is not altered, instead of being in  London I shall probably be in my grave. I thank God that the thread of my  life will soon be spun out.    In haste, your    BEETHOVEN.    N.B. I wish you to buy me a quarter of a yard of green wax-cloth, green on  both sides. It seems incredible that I have not been able to get anything  of the kind from these _green_ people here. It is far.... [illegible].    [X. brought the Trio in C minor (Op. 1, No. 3) to show to Beethoven, having  arranged it as a quintet for stringed instruments (published by Artaria as  Op. 104). Beethoven evidently discovered a good many faults in the work;  still, the undertaking had sufficient attractions to induce him to correct  it himself, and to make many changes in it. A very different score was thus  of course produced from that of X., on the cover of whose work the genial  master, in a fit of good humor, inscribed with his own hand the following  title:--    A Terzet arranged as a Quintet,  by _Mr. Well-meaning_,    translated from the semblance into the reality of five parts, and exalted  from the depths of wretchedness to a certain degree of excellence,    by _Mr. Goodwill_.    Vienna, Aug. 14, 1817.    N.B. The original three-part score of the Quintet has been sacrificed as a  solemn burnt-offering to the subterranean gods.][1]    [Footnote 1: This Quintet appeared as Op. 104 at Artaria's in Vienna.]      239.    TO FRAU VON STREICHER.    When we next meet, you will be surprised to hear what I have in the mean  time learned. My poor Carl was only misled for the moment; but there are  men who are brutes, and of this number is the priest here, who deserves to  be well cudgelled.      240.    TO G. DEL RIO.    August 19, 1817.    I unluckily received your letter yesterday too late, for she had already  been here; otherwise I would have shown her to the door, as she richly  deserved. I sincerely thank Fraulein N. for the trouble she took in writing  down the gossip of this woman. Though an enemy to all tattling and gossip,  still this is of importance to us; so I shall write to her, and also give  her letter to me to Herr A.S. [Advocate Schoenauer?] I may possibly have let  fall some words in her presence in reference to the recent occurrence, and  the irregularity on your part, but I cannot in the slightest degree recall  ever having written to her about you.    It was only an attempt on her side to exasperate you against me; and thus  to influence you and obtain more from you, in the same way that she  formerly reported to me all sorts of things that you had said about me; but  I took no heed of her talk. On this recent occasion I wished to try whether  she might not be improved by a more patient and conciliatory mode of  conduct: I imparted my intention to Herr A.S., but it has utterly failed;  and on Sunday I made up my mind to adhere to the former necessary severity,  as even during the glimpse she had of Carl, she contrived to inoculate him  with some of her venom. In short, we must be guided by the zodiac, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13291"],[0,"The World's Great Men of Music: Story-Lives of Master Musicians (#3)"],[1,"this time he had done very little composing, but now he  set about teaching himself the art of composition.    The first thing he did was to take a number of concertos written for  the violin by Vivaldi, and set them for the harpsichord. In this way  he learned to express himself and to attain facility in putting his  thoughts on paper without first playing them on an instrument. He  worked alone in this way with no assistance from any one, and often  studied till far into the night to perfect himself in this branch of  his art.    From the very beginning, his playing on the new organ excited  admiration, but his artistic temperament frequently threatened to  be his undoing. For the young enthusiast was no sooner seated at the  organ to conduct the church music than he forgot that the choir and  congregation were depending on him and would begin to improvise at  such length that the singing had to stop altogether, while the people  listened in mute admiration. Of course there were many disputes  between the new organist and the elders of the church, but they  overlooked his vagaries because of his genius.    Yet he must have been a trial to that well-ordered body. Once he asked  for a month's leave of absence to visit Luebeck, where the celebrated  Buxtehude was playing the organ in the Marien Kirche during Advent.  Luebeck was fifty miles from Arnstadt, but the courageous boy made the  entire journey on foot. He enjoyed the music at Luebeck so much that  he quite forgot his promise to return in one month until he had stayed  three. His pockets being quite empty, he thought for the first time of  returning to his post. Of course there was trouble on his return, but  the authorities retained him in spite of all, for the esteem in which  they held his gifts.    Bach soon began to find Arnstadt too small and narrow for his soaring  desires. Besides, his fame was growing and his name becoming known in  the larger, adjacent towns. When he was offered the post of organist  at St. Blasius at Muelhausen, near Eisenach, he accepted at once. He  was told he might name his own salary. If Bach had been avaricious he  could have asked a large sum, but he modestly named the small amount  he had received at Arnstadt with the addition of certain articles of  food which should be delivered at his door, gratis.    Bach's prospects were now so much improved that he thought he might  make a home for himself. He had fallen in love with a cousin, Maria  Bach, and they were married October 17, 1707.    The young organist only remained in Muelhausen a year, for he received  a more important offer. He was invited to play before Duke Wilhelm  Ernst of Weimar, and hastened thither, hoping this might lead to an  appointment at Court. He was not disappointed, for the Duke was so  delighted with Bach's playing that he at once offered him the post of  Court organist.    A wider outlook now opened for Sebastian Bach, who had all his young  life struggled with poverty and privation. He was now able to give  much time to composition, and began to write those masterpieces for  the organ which have placed his name on the highest pinnacle in the  temple of music.    In his comfortable Weimar home the musician had the quiet and  leisure that he needed to perfect his art on all sides, not only in  composition but in organ and harpsichord playing. He felt that he had  conquered all difficulties of both instruments, and one day boasted  to a friend that he could play any piece, no matter how difficult, at  sight, without a mistake. In order to test this statement the friend  invited him to breakfast shortly after. On the harpsichord were  several pieces of music, one of which, though apparently simple,  was really very difficult. His host left the room to prepare the  breakfast, while Bach began to try over the music. All went well until  he came to the difficult piece which he began quite boldly but stuck  in the middle. It went no better after several attempts. As his friend  entered, bringing the breakfast, Bach exclaimed:--\"You are right. One  cannot play everything perfectly at sight,--it is impossible!\"    Duke Wilhelm Ernst, in 1714, raised him to the position of  Head-Concert Master, a position which offered added privileges. Every  autumn he used his annual vacation in traveling to the principal towns  to give performances on organ and clavier. By such means he gained a  great reputation both as player and composer.    On one of these tours he arrived in Dresden in time to learn of a  French player who had just come to town. Jean Marchand had won a great  reputation in France, where he was organist to the King at Versailles,  and regarded as the most fashionable musician of the day. All this had  made him very conceited and overbearing. Every one was discussing the  Frenchman's wonderful playing and it was whispered he had been offered  an appointment in Dresden.    The friends of Bach proposed that he should engage Marchand in a  contest, to defend the musical honor of the German nation. Both  musicians were willing; the King promised to attend.    The day fixed for the trial arrived; a brilliant company assembled.  Bach made his appearance, and all was ready, but the adversary failed  to come. After a considerable delay it was learned that Marchand had  fled the city.    In 1717, on his return from Dresden, Bach was appointed Capellmeister  to the young Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Coethen. The Prince was an  enthusiastic lover of music, and at Coethen Bach led a happy, busy  life. The Prince often journeyed to different towns to gratify his  taste for music, and always took Bach with him. On one of these trips  he was unable to receive the news that his wife had suddenly passed  away, and was buried before he could return to Coethen. This was a  severe blow to the whole family.    Four years afterward, Bach married again, Anna Magdalena Wuelkens was  in every way suited for a musician's wife, and for her he composed  many of the delightful dances which we now so greatly enjoy. He also  wrote a number of books of studies for his wife and his sons, several  of whom later became good musicians and composers.    Perhaps no man ever led a more crowded life, though outwardly a quiet  one. He never had an idle moment. When not playing, composing or  teaching, he would be found engraving music on copper, since that work  was costly in those days. Or he would be manufacturing some kind of  musical instrument. At least two are known to be of his invention.    Bach began to realize that the Coethen post, while it gave him plenty  of leisure for his work, did not give him the scope he needed for his  art. The Prince had lately married, and did not seem to care as much  for music as before.    The wider opportunity which Bach sought came when he was appointed  director of music in the churches of St. Thomas and St. Nicholas  in Leipsic, and Cantor of the Thomas-Schule there. With the Leipsic  period Bach entered the last stage of his career, for he retained this  post for the rest of his life. He labored unceasingly, in spite of  many obstacles and petty restrictions, to train the boys under his  care, and raise the standard of musical efficiency in the Schule, as  choirs of both churches were recruited from the scholars of the Thomas  School.    During the twenty-seven years of life in Leipsic, Bach wrote some of  his greatest works, such as the Oratorios of St. Matthew and St. John,  and the Mass in B Minor. It was the Passion according to St. Matthew  that Mendelssohn, about a hundred years later discovered, studied  with so much zeal, and performed in Berlin, with so much devotion and  success.    Bach always preferred a life of quiet and retirement; simplicity had  ever been his chief characteristic. He was always very religious; his  greatest works voice the noblest sentiments of exaltation.    Bach's modesty and retiring disposition is illustrated by the  following little incident. Carl Philip Emmanuel, his third son, was  cembalist in the royal orchestra of Frederick the Great. His Majesty  was very fond of music and played the flute to some extent. He had  several times sent messages to Bach by Philip Emmanuel, that he would  like to see him. But Bach, intent on his work, ignored the royal  favor, until he finally received an imperative command, which could  not be disobeyed. He then, with his son Friedmann, set out for  Potsdam.    The King was about to begin the evening's music when he learned that  Bach had arrived. With a smile he turned to his musicians: \"Gentlemen,  old Bach has come.\" Bach was sent for at once, without having time  to change his traveling dress. His Majesty received him with great  kindness and respect, and showed him through the palace, where he  must try the Silbermann pianofortes, of which there were several. Bach  improvised on each and the King gave a theme which he treated as a  fantasia, to the astonishment of all. Frederick next asked him to play  a six part fugue, and then Bach improvised one on a theme of his own.  The King clapped his hands, exclaiming over and over, \"Only one Bach!  Only one Bach!\" It was a great evening for the master, and one he  never forgot.    Just after completing his great work, The Art of Fugue, Bach became  totally blind, due no doubt, to the great strain he had always put  upon his eyes, in not only writing his own music, but in copying out  large works of the older masters. Notwithstanding this handicap he  continued at work up to the very last. On the morning of the day on  which he passed away, July 28, 1750, he suddenly regained his sight. A  few hours later he became unconscious and passed in sleep.    Bach was laid to rest in the churchyard of St. John's at Leipsic, but  no stone marks his resting place. Only the town library register tells  that Johann Sebastian Bach, Musical Director and Singing Master of the  St. Thomas School, was carried to his grave July 30, 1750."]]]
