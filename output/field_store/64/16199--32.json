The once slave, though free, would not leave his master. He  would have died for him. He was a man of about thirty, vigorous, active,  clever, intelligent, gentle, and calm, sometimes naive, always merry,  obliging, and honest. His name was Nebuchadnezzar, but he only answered  to the familiar abbreviation of Neb.    When Neb heard that his master had been made prisoner, he left  Massachusetts without hesitating an instant, arrived before Richmond,  and by dint of stratagem and shrewdness, after having risked his life  twenty times over, managed to penetrate into the besieged town. The  pleasure of Harding on seeing his servant, and the joy of Neb at finding  his master, can scarcely be described.    But though Neb had been able to make his way into Richmond, it was quite  another thing to get out again, for the Northern prisoners were very  strictly watched. Some extraordinary opportunity was needed to make the  attempt with any chance of success, and this opportunity not only did  not present itself, but was very difficult to find.    Meanwhile Grant continued his energetic operations. The victory of  Petersburg had been very dearly bought. His forces, united to those of  Butler, had as yet been unsuccessful before Richmond, and nothing gave  the prisoners any hope of a speedy deliverance.    The reporter, to whom his tedious captivity did not offer a single  incident worthy of note, could stand it no longer. His usually active  mind was occupied with one sole thought--how he might get out of  Richmond at any cost. Several times had he even made the attempt,  but was stopped by some insurmountable obstacle. However, the siege  continued; and if the prisoners were anxious to escape and join Grant's  army, certain of the besieged were no less anxious to join the Southern  forces. Among them was one Jonathan Forster, a determined Southerner.  The truth was, that if the prisoners of the Secessionists could not  leave the town, neither could the Secessionists themselves while the  Northern army invested it. The Governor of Richmond for a long time had  been unable to communicate with General Lee, and he very much wished to  make known to him the situation of the town, so as to hasten the march  of the army to their relief. Thus Jonathan Forster accordingly conceived  the idea of rising in a balloon, so as to pass over the besieging lines,  and in that way reach the Secessionist camp.    The Governor authorized the attempt. A balloon was manufactured and  placed at the disposal of Forster, who was to be accompanied by five  other persons. They were furnished with arms in case they might have  to defend themselves when they alighted, and provisions in the event of  their aerial voyage being prolonged.    The departure of the balloon was fixed for the 18th of March. It should  be effected during the night, with a northwest wind of moderate force,  and the aeronauts calculated that they would reach General Lee's camp in  a few hours.    But this northwest wind was not a simple breeze. From the 18th it was  evident that it was changing to a hurricane. The tempest soon became  such that Forster's departure was deferred, for it was impossible to  risk the balloon and those whom it carried in the midst of the furious  elements.    The balloon, inflated on the great square of Richmond, was ready to  depart on the first abatement of the wind, and, as may be supposed, the  impatience among the besieged to see the storm moderate was very great.    The 18th, the 19th of March passed without any alteration in the  weather. There was even great difficulty in keeping the balloon fastened  to the ground, as the squalls dashed it furiously about.    The night of the 19th passed, but the next morning the storm blew with  redoubled force. The departure of the balloon was impossible.    On that day the engineer, Cyrus Harding, was accosted in one of the  streets of Richmond by a person whom he did not in the least know. This  was a sailor named Pencroft, a man of about thirty-five or forty years  of age, strongly built, very sunburnt, and possessed of a pair of  bright sparkling eyes and a remarkably good physiognomy. Pencroft was an  American from the North, who had sailed all the ocean over, and who had  gone through every possible and almost impossible adventure that a being  with two feet and no wings would encounter. It is needless to say that  he was a bold, dashing fellow, ready to dare anything and was astonished  at nothing. Pencroft at the beginning of the year had gone to Richmond  on business, with a young boy of fifteen from New Jersey, son of a  former captain, an orphan, whom he loved as if he had been his  own child. Not having been able to leave the town before the first  operations of the siege, he found himself shut up, to his great disgust;  but, not accustomed to succumb to difficulties, he resolved to escape by  some means or other. He knew the engineer-officer by reputation; he knew  with what impatience that determined man chafed under his restraint. On  this day he did not, therefore, hesitate to accost him, saying, without  circumlocution, \"Have you had enough of Richmond, captain?\"    The engineer looked fixedly at the man who spoke, and who added, in a  low voice,--    \"Captain Harding, will you try to escape?\"    \"When?\" asked the engineer quickly, and it was evident that this  question was uttered without consideration, for he had not yet examined  the stranger who addressed him. But after having with a penetrating  eye observed the open face of the sailor, he was convinced that he had  before him an honest man.    \"Who are you?\" he asked briefly.    Pencroft made himself known.    \"Well,\" replied Harding, \"and in what way do you propose to escape?\"    \"By that lazy balloon which is left there doing nothing, and which looks  to me as if it was waiting on purpose for us--\"    There was no necessity for the sailor to finish his sentence. The  engineer understood him at once. He seized Pencroft by the arm, and  dragged him to his house. There the sailor developed his project, which  was indeed extremely simple. They risked nothing but their lives in its  execution. The hurricane was in all its violence, it is true, but so  clever and daring an engineer as Cyrus Harding knew perfectly well how  to manage a balloon. Had he himself been as well acquainted with the art  of sailing in the air as he was with the navigation of a ship, Pencroft  would not have hesitated to set out, of course taking his young friend  Herbert with him; for, accustomed to brave the fiercest tempests of the  ocean, he was not to be hindered on account of the hurricane.    Captain Harding had listened to the sailor without saying a word,  but his eyes shone with satisfaction. Here was the long-sought-for  opportunity--he was not a man to let it pass. The plan was feasible,  though, it must be confessed, dangerous in the extreme. In the night,  in spite of their guards, they might approach the balloon, slip into the  car, and then cut the cords which held it. There was no doubt that they  might be killed, but on the other hand they might succeed, and without  this storm!--Without this storm the balloon would have started already  and the looked-for opportunity would not have then presented itself.    \"I am not alone!\" said Harding at last.    \"How many people do you wish to bring with you?\" asked the sailor.    \"Two; my friend Spilett, and my servant Neb.\"    \"That will be three,\" replied Pencroft; \"and with Herbert and me five.  But the balloon will hold six--\"    \"That will be enough, we will go,\" answered Harding in a firm voice.    This \"we\" included Spilett, for the reporter, as his friend well knew,  was not a man to draw back, and when the project was communicated to him  he approved of it unreservedly. What astonished him was, that so simple  an idea had not occurred to him before. As to Neb, he followed his  master wherever his master wished to go.    \"This evening, then,\" said Pencroft, \"we will all meet out there.\"    \"This evening, at ten o'clock,\" replied Captain Harding; \"and Heaven  grant that the storm does not abate before our departure.\"    Pencroft took leave of the two friends, and returned to his lodging,  where young Herbert Brown had remained. The courageous boy knew of the  sailor's plan, and it was not without anxiety that he awaited the result  of the proposal being made to the engineer. Thus five determined  persons were about to abandon themselves to the mercy of the tempestuous  elements!    No! the storm did not abate, and neither Jonathan Forster nor his  companions dreamed of confronting it in that frail car.    It would be a terrible journey. The engineer only feared one thing; it  was that the balloon, held to the ground and dashed about by the  wind, would be torn into shreds. For several hours he roamed round the  nearly-deserted square, surveying the apparatus. Pencroft did the same  on his side, his hands in his pockets, yawning now and then like a man  who did not know how to kill the time, but really dreading, like  his friend, either the escape or destruction of the balloon. Evening  arrived. The night was dark in the extreme. Thick mists passed like  clouds close to the ground. Rain fell mingled with snow, it was very  cold. A mist hung over Richmond. It seemed as if the violent storm had  produced a truce between the besiegers and the besieged, and that the  cannon were silenced by the louder detonations of the storm. The streets  of the town were deserted. It had not even appeared necessary in that  horrible weather to place a guard in the square, in the midst of which  plunged the balloon. Everything favored the departure of the prisoners,  but what might possibly be the termination of the hazardous voyage they  contemplated in the midst of the furious elements?--    \"Dirty weather!\" exclaimed Pencroft, fixing his hat firmly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12680"],[0,"Children of the Ghetto: A Study of a Peculiar People (#3)"],[1,"ldren, all  washing down the luscious spicy compounds with cups of chocolate;  temporarily erected swinging cradles bore a vociferous many-colored  burden to the skies; cardboard noses, grotesque in their departure from  truth, abounded. The Purim _Spiel_ or Purim play never took root in  England, nor was Haman ever burnt in the streets, but _Shalachmonos_, or  gifts of the season, passed between friend and friend, and masquerading  parties burst into neighbors' houses. But the Lane was lively enough on  the ordinary Friday and Sunday. The famous Sunday Fair was an event of  metropolitan importance, and thither came buyers of every sect. The  Friday Fair was more local, and confined mainly to edibles. The  Ante-Festival Fairs combined something of the other two, for Jews  desired to sport new hats and clothes for the holidays as well as to eat  extra luxuries, and took the opportunity of a well-marked epoch to  invest in new everythings from oil-cloth to cups and saucers. Especially  was this so at Passover, when for a week the poorest Jew must use a  supplementary set of crockery and kitchen utensils. A babel of sound,  audible for several streets around, denoted Market Day in Petticoat  Lane, and the pavements were blocked by serried crowds going both ways  at once.    It was only gradually that the community was Anglicized. Under the sway  of centrifugal impulses, the wealthier members began to form new  colonies, moulting their old feathers and replacing them by finer, and  flying ever further from the centre. Men of organizing ability founded  unrivalled philanthropic and educational institutions on British lines;  millionaires fought for political emancipation; brokers brazenly foisted  themselves on 'Change; ministers gave sermons in bad English; an English  journal was started; very slowly, the conventional Anglican tradition  was established; and on that human palimpsest which has borne the  inscriptions of all languages and all epochs, was writ large the  sign-manual of England. Judaea prostrated itself before the Dagon of its  hereditary foe, the Philistine, and respectability crept on to freeze  the blood of the Orient with its frigid finger, and to blur the vivid  tints of the East into the uniform gray of English middle-class life. In  the period within which our story moves, only vestiges of the old gaiety  and brotherhood remained; the full _al fresco_ flavor was evaporated.    And to-day they are alt dead--the _Takeefim_ with big hearts and bigger  purses, and the humorous _Schnorrers_, who accepted their gold, and the  cheerful pious peddlers who rose from one extreme to the other, building  up fabulous fortunes in marvellous ways. The young mothers, who suckled  their babes in the sun, have passed out of the sunshine; yea, and the  babes, too, have gone down with gray heads to the dust. Dead are the  fair fat women, with tender hearts, who waddled benignantly through  life, ever ready to shed the sympathetic tear, best of wives, and cooks,  and mothers; dead are the bald, ruddy old men, who ambled about in faded  carpet slippers, and passed the snuff-box of peace: dead are the  stout-hearted youths who sailed away to Tom Tiddler's ground; and dead  are the buxom maidens they led under the wedding canopy when they  returned. Even the great Dr. Sequira, pompous in white stockings,  physician extraordinary to the Prince Regent of Portugal, lies  vanquished by his life-long adversary and the Baal Shem himself, King of  Cabalists, could command no countervailing miracle.    Where are the little girls in white pinafores with pink sashes who  brightened the Ghetto on high days and holidays? Where is the beauteous  Betsy of the Victoria Ballet? and where the jocund synagogue dignitary  who led off the cotillon with her at the annual Rejoicing of the Law?  Worms have long since picked the great financier's brain, the  embroidered waistcoats of the bucks have passed even beyond the stage of  adorning sweeps on May Day, and Dutch Sam's fist is bonier than ever.  The same mould covers them all--those who donated guineas and those who  donated \"gifts,\" the rogues and the hypocrites, and the wedding-drolls,  the observant and the lax, the purse-proud and the lowly, the coarse and  the genteel, the wonderful chapmen and the luckless _Schlemihls_, Rabbi  and _Dayan_ and _Shochet_, the scribes who wrote the sacred scroll and  the cantors who trolled it off mellifluous tongues, and the betting-men  who never listened to it; the grimy Russians of the capotes and the  earlocks, and the blue-blooded Dons, \"the gentlemen of the Mahamad,\" who  ruffled it with swords and knee-breeches in the best Christian society.  Those who kneaded the toothsome \"bolas\" lie with those who ate them; and  the marriage-brokers repose with those they mated. The olives and the  cucumbers grow green and fat as of yore, but their lovers are mixed with  a soil that is barren of them. The restless, bustling crowds that  jostled laughingly in Rag Fair are at rest in the \"House of Life;\" the  pageant of their strenuous generation is vanished as a dream. They died  with the declaration of God's unity on their stiffening lips, and the  certainty of resurrection in their pulseless hearts, and a faded Hebrew  inscription on a tomb, or an unread entry on a synagogue brass is their  only record. And yet, perhaps, their generation is not all dust.  Perchance, here and there, some decrepit centenarian rubs his purblind  eyes with the ointment of memory, and sees these pictures of the past,  hallowed by the consecration of time, and finds his shrivelled cheek wet  with the pathos sanctifying the joys that have been.              BOOK I.      CHILDREN OF THE GHETTO.              CHAPTER I.    THE BREAD OF AFFLICTION.      A dead and gone wag called the street \"Fashion Street,\" and most of the  people who live in it do not even see the joke. If it could exchange  names with \"Rotten Row,\" both places would be more appropriately  designated. It is a dull, squalid, narrow thoroughfare in the East End  of London, connecting Spitalfields with Whitechapel, and branching off  in blind alleys. In the days when little Esther Ansell trudged its  unclean pavements, its extremities were within earshot of the  blasphemies from some of the vilest quarters and filthiest rookeries in  the capital of the civilized world. Some of these clotted spiders'-webs  have since been swept away by the besom of the social reformer, and the  spiders have scurried off into darker crannies.    There were the conventional touches about the London street-picture, as  Esther Ansell sped through the freezing mist of the December evening,  with a pitcher in her hand, looking in her oriental coloring like a  miniature of Rebecca going to the well. A female street-singer, with a  trail of infants of dubious maternity, troubled the air with a piercing  melody; a pair of slatterns with arms a-kimbo reviled each other's  relatives; a drunkard lurched along, babbling amiably; an organ-grinder,  blue-nosed as his monkey, set some ragged children jigging under the  watery rays of a street-lamp. Esther drew her little plaid shawl tightly  around her, and ran on without heeding these familiar details, her  chilled feet absorbing the damp of the murky pavement through the worn  soles of her cumbrous boots. They were masculine boots, kicked off by  some intoxicated tramp and picked up by Esther's father. Moses Ansell  had a habit of lighting on windfalls, due, perhaps, to his meek manner  of walking with bent head, as though literally bowed beneath the yoke of  the Captivity. Providence rewarded him for his humility by occasional  treasure-trove. Esther had received a pair of new boots from her school  a week before, and the substitution, of the tramp's foot-gear for her  own resulted in a net profit of half-a-crown, and kept Esther's little  brothers and sisters in bread for a week. At school, under her teacher's  eye, Esther was very unobtrusive about the feet for the next fortnight,  but as the fear of being found out died away, even her rather morbid  conscience condoned the deception in view of the stomachic gain.    They gave away bread and milk at the school, too, but Esther and her  brothers and sisters never took either, for fear of being thought in  want of them. The superiority of a class-mate is hard to bear, and a  high-spirited child will not easily acknowledge starvation in presence  of a roomful of purse-proud urchins, some of them able to spend a  farthing a day on pure luxuries. Moses Ansell would have been grieved  had he known his children were refusing the bread he could not give  them. Trade was slack in the sweating dens, and Moses, who had always  lived from hand to mouth, had latterly held less than ever between the  one and the other. He had applied for help to the Jewish Board of  Guardians, but red-tape rarely unwinds as quickly as hunger coils  itself; moreover, Moses was an old offender in poverty at the Court of  Charity. But there was one species of alms which Moses could not be  denied, and the existence of which Esther could not conceal from him as  she concealed that of the eleemosynary breakfasts at the school. For it  was known to all men that soup and bread were to be had for the asking  thrice a week at the Institution in Fashion Street, and in the Ansell  household the opening of the soup-kitchen was looked forward to as the  dawn of a golden age, when it would be impossible to pass more than one  day without bread. The vaguely-remembered smell of the soup threw a  poetic fragrance over the coming winter. Every year since Esther's  mother had died, the child had been sent to fetch home the provender,  for Moses, who was the only other available member of the family, was  always busy praying when he had nothing better to do. And so to-night  Esther fared to the kitchen, with her red pitcher, passing in her  childish eagerness numerous women shuffling along on "]]]
