O when wilt thou             come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect             heart.    19:101:003 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work             of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.    19:101:004 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked             person.    19:101:005 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off:             him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I             suffer.    19:101:006 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they             may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall             serve me.    19:101:007 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he             that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.    19:101:008 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may             cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.    19:102:001 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.    19:102:002 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble;             incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me             speedily.    19:102:003 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned             as an hearth.    19:102:004 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget             to eat my bread.    19:102:005 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my             skin.    19:102:006 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the             desert.    19:102:007 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.    19:102:008 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad             against me are sworn against me.    19:102:009 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with             weeping.    19:102:010 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast             lifted me up, and cast me down.    19:102:011 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered             like grass.    19:102:012 But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance             unto all generations.    19:102:013 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to             favour her, yea, the set time, is come.    19:102:014 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the             dust thereof.    19:102:015 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the             kings of the earth thy glory.    19:102:016 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his             glory.    19:102:017 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise             their prayer.    19:102:018 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the             people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.    19:102:019 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from             heaven did the LORD behold the earth;    19:102:020 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are             appointed to death;    19:102:021 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in             Jerusalem;    19:102:022 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to             serve the LORD.    19:102:023 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.    19:102:024 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days:             thy years are throughout all generations.    19:102:025 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the             heavens are the work of thy hands.    19:102:026 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them             shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change             them, and they shall be changed:    19:102:027 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.    19:102:028 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed             shall be established before thee.    19:103:001 Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless             his holy name.    19:103:002 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:    19:103:003 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy             diseases;    19:103:004 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee             with lovingkindness and tender mercies;    19:103:005 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth             is renewed like the eagle's.    19:103:006 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are             oppressed.    19:103:007 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children             of Israel.    19:103:008 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and             plenteous in mercy.    19:103:009 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for             ever.    19:103:010 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us             according to our iniquities.    19:103:011 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his             mercy toward them that fear him.    19:103:012 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed             our transgressions from us.    19:103:013 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth             them that fear him.    19:103:014 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.    19:103:015 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field,             so he flourisheth.    19:103:016 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place             thereof shall know it no more.    19:103:017 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting             upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's             children;    19:103:018 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his             commandments to do them.    19:103:019 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his             kingdom ruleth over all.    19:103:020 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do             his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.    19:103:021 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that             do his pleasure.    19:103:022 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion:             bless the LORD, O my soul.    19:104:001 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great;             thou art clothed with honour and majesty.    19:104:002 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who             stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:    19:104:003 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh             the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the             wind:    19:104:004 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:    19:104:005 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be             removed for ever.    19:104:006 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters             stood above the mountains.    19:104:007 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they             hasted away.    19:104:008 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto             the place which thou hast founded for them.    19:104:009 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they             turn not again to cover the earth.    19:104:010 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the      "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/808"],[0,"The Complete Plays of Gilbert and Sullivan (#20)"],[1,"sively.)

My dear, under the circumstances you are doing    admirablyand you'll improve with practice.  It's so difficult    to be a lady when one isn't born to it.          JULIA (in a rage, to LUDWIG).

At any risk    I must gratify my urgent desire to know what is going on.    (Looking off.)  Why, what's that?  Surely I see a wedding    procession winding down the hill, dressed in my Troilus and    Cressida costumes!  That's Ludwig's doing!  I see how it ishe    found the time hang heavy on his hands, and is amusing himself by    getting married to Lisa.  Noit can't be to Lisa, for here she    is!      Enter LISA.            LISA (not seeing him).  I really cannot stand seeing my    Ludwig married twice in one day to somebody else!          ERN.  Lisa!    (LISA sees him, and stands as if transfixed with horror.).          ERN.  Come heredon't be a little foolI want you.    (LISA suddenly turns and bolts off.)          ERN.  Why, what's the matter with the little donkey?  One    would think she saw a ghost!  But if he's not marrying Lisa, whom    is he marrying?  (Suddenly.)  Julia!  (Much overcome.)  I see it    all!  The scoundrel!  He had to adopt all my responsibilities,    and he's shabbily taken advantage of the situation to marry the    girl I'm engaged to!  But no, it can't be Julia, for here she is!      Enter JULIA.          JULIA (not seeing him).  I've made up my mind.  I won't    stand it!  I'll send in my notice at once!          ERN.  Julia!  Oh, what a relief!      (JULIA gazes at him as if transfixed.)            ERN.  Then you've not married Ludwig?  You are still true    to    me?      (JULIA turns and bolts in grotesque horror.  ERNEST follows and          stops her.)            ERN.  Don't run away!  Listen to me.  Are you all crazy?          JULIA (in affected terror).  What would you with me,    spectre?  Oh, ain't his eyes sepulchral!  And ain't his voice    hollow!  What are you doing out of your tomb at this time of    dayapparition?          ERN.  I do wish I could make you girls understand that I'm    only technically dead, and that physically I'm as much alive as    ever I was in my life!          JULIA.  Oh, but it's an awful thing to be haunted by a    technical bogy!          ERN.  You won't be haunted much longer.  The law must be on    its last legs, and in a few hours I shall come to life    againresume all my social and civil functions, and claim my    darling as my blushing bride!          JULIA.  Ohthen you haven't heard?          ERN.  My love, I've heard nothing.  How could I?  There are    no daily papers where I come from.          JULIA.  Why, Ludwig challenged Rudolph and won, and now    he's    Grand Duke, and he's revived the law for another century!          ERN.  What!  But you're not seriousyou're only joking!          JULIA.  My good sir, I'm a light-hearted girl, but I don't    chaff bogies.          ERN.  Well, that's the meanest dodge I ever heard of!          JULIA.  Shabby trick, I call it.          ERN.  But you don't mean to say that you're going to cry    off!          JULIA.  I really can't afford to wait until your time is    up.    You know, I've always set my face against long engagements.          ERN.  Then defy the law and marry me now.  We will fly to    your native country, and I'll play broken-English in London as    you play broken-German here!          JULIA.  No.  These legal technicalities cannot be defied.
