Aytch,\" Maury Grays, First Tennessee Regiment (#3)"],[1," the \"boy the calf had run over.\"  We felt that the war was over, and we would have to return home without  even seeing a Yankee soldier.  Ah, how we envied those that were wounded.  We thought at that time that we would have given a thousand dollars to  have been in the battle, and to have had our arm shot off, so we could  have returned home with an empty sleeve.  But the battle was over,  and we left out.      STAUNTON    From Manassas our train moved on to Staunton, Virginia.  Here we again  went into camp, overhauled kettles, pots, buckets, jugs and tents,  and found everything so tangled up and mixed that we could not tell  tuther from which.    We stretched our tents, and the soldiers once again felt that restraint  and discipline which we had almost forgotten en route to this place.  But, as the war was over now, our captains, colonels and generals were  not \"hard on the boys;\" in fact, had begun to electioneer a little for  the Legislature and for Congress.  In fact, some wanted, and were looking  forward to the time, to run for Governor of Tennessee.    Staunton was a big place; whisky was cheap, and good Virginia tobacco was  plentiful, and the currency of the country was gold and silver.    The State Asylums for the blind and insane were here, and we visited all  the places of interest.    Here is where we first saw the game called \"chuck-a-luck,\" afterwards  so popular in the army.  But, I always noticed that chuck won, and luck  always lost.    Faro and roulette were in full blast; in fact, the skum had begun to come  to the surface, and shoddy was the gentleman.  By this, I mean that civil  law had been suspended; the ermine of the judges had been overridden by  the sword and bayonet.  In other words, the military had absorbed the  civil.  Hence the gambler was in his glory.      WARM SPRINGS, VIRGINIA    One day while we were idling around camp, June Tucker sounded the  assembly, and we were ordered aboard the cars.  We pulled out for  Millboro; from there we had to foot it to Bath Alum and Warm Springs.  We went over the Allegheny Mountains.    I was on every march that was ever made by the First Tennessee Regiment  during the whole war, and at this time I cannot remember of ever  experiencing a harder or more fatiguing march.  It seemed that mountain  was piled upon mountain.  No sooner would we arrive at a place that  seemed to be the top than another view of a higher, and yet higher  mountain would rise before us.  From the foot to the top of the mountain  the soldiers lined the road, broken down and exhausted.  First one  blanket was thrown away, and then another; now and then a good pair of  pants, old boots and shoes, Sunday hats, pistols and Bowie knives strewed  the road.  Old bottles and jugs and various and sundry articles were  lying pell-mell everywhere.  Up and up, and onward and upward we pulled  and toiled, until we reached the very top, when there burst upon our  view one of the grandest and most beautiful landscapes we ever beheld.    Nestled in the valley right before us is Bath Alum and Warm Springs.  It seemed to me at that time, and since, a glimpse of a better and  brighter world beyond, to the weary Christian pilgrim who may have been  toiling on his journey for years.  A glad shout arose from those who had  gained the top, which cheered and encouraged the others to persevere.  At last we got to Warm Springs.  Here they had a nice warm dinner waiting  for us.  They had a large bath-house at Warm Springs.  A large pool of  water arranged so that a person could go in any depth he might desire.  It was a free thing, and we pitched in.  We had no idea of the enervating  effect it would have upon our physical systems, and as the water was but  little past tepid, we stayed in a good long time.  But when we came out  we were as limp as dishrags.  About this time the assembly sounded and we  were ordered to march.  But we couldn't march worth a cent.  There we had  to stay until our systems had had sufficient recuperation.  And we would  wonder what all this marching was for, as the war was over anyhow.    The second day after leaving Warm Springs we came to Big Springs.  It was in the month of August, and the biggest white frost fell that I  ever saw in winter.    The Yankees were reported to be in close proximity to us, and Captain  Field with a detail of ten men was sent forward on the scout.  I was on  the detail, and when we left camp that evening, it was dark and dreary  and drizzling rain.  After a while the rain began to come down harder  and harder, and every one of us was wet and drenched to the skin--guns,  cartridges and powder.  The next morning about daylight, while standing  videt, I saw a body of twenty-five or thirty Yankees approaching, and I  raised my gun for the purpose of shooting, and pulled down, but the cap  popped.  They discovered me and popped three or four caps at me; their  powder was wet also.  Before I could get on a fresh cap, Captain Field  came running up with his seven-shooting rifle, and the first fire he  killed a Yankee.  They broke and run.  Captain Field did all the firing,  but every time he pulled down he brought a Yankee.  I have forgotten the  number that he did kill, but if I am not mistaken it was either twenty  or twenty-one, for I remember the incident was in almost every Southern  paper at that time, and the general comments were that one Southern man  was equal to twenty Yankees.  While we were in hot pursuit, one truly  brave and magnanimous Yankee, who had been badly wounded, said,  \"Gentlemen, you have killed me, but not a hundred yards from here is the  main line.\"  We did not go any further, but halted right there, and after  getting all the information that we could out of the wounded Yankee,  we returned to camp.    One evening, General Robert E. Lee came to our camp.  He was a fine-  looking gentleman, and wore a moustache.  He was dressed in blue  cottonade and looked like some good boy's grandpa.  I felt like going up  to him and saying good evening, Uncle Bob!  I am not certain at this late  day that I did not do so.  I remember going up mighty close and sitting  there and listening to his conversation with the officers of our  regiment.  He had a calm and collected air about him, his voice was kind  and tender, and his eye was as gentle as a dove's.  His whole make-up  of form and person, looks and manner had a kind of gentle and soothing  magnetism about it that drew every one to him and made them love, respect,  and honor him.  I fell in love with the old gentleman and felt like going  home with him.  I know I have never seen a finer looking man, nor one  with more kind and gentle features and manners.  His horse was standing  nipping the grass, and when I saw that he was getting ready to start I  ran and caught his horse and led him up to him.  He took the reins of the  bridle in his hand and said, \"thank you, my son,\" rode off, and my heart  went with him.  There was none of his staff with him; he had on no sword  or pistol, or anything to show his rank.  The only thing that I remember  he had was an opera-glass hung over his shoulder by a strap.    Leaving Big Springs, we marched on day by day, across Greenbrier and  Gauley rivers to Huntersville, a little but sprightly town hid in the  very fastnesses of the mountains.  The people live exceedingly well in  these mountains.  They had plenty of honey and buckwheat cakes, and  they called buttermilk \"sour-milk,\" and sour-milk weren't fit for pigs;  they couldn't see how folks drank sour-milk.  But sour-kraut was good.  Everything seemed to grow in the mountains--potatoes, Irish and sweet;  onions, snap beans, peas--though the country was very thinly populated.  Deer, bear, and foxes, as well as wild turkeys, and rabbits and squirrels  abounded everywhere.  Apples and peaches were abundant, and everywhere  the people had apple-butter for every meal; and occasionally we would  come across a small-sized distillery, which we would at once start to  doing duty.  We drank the singlings while they were hot, but like the old  woman who could not eat corn bread until she heard that they made whisky  out of corn, then she could manage to \"worry a little of it down;\"  so it was with us and the singlings.    From this time forward, we were ever on the march--tramp, tramp, tramp--  always on the march.  Lee's corps, Stonewall Jackson's division--I refer  you to the histories for the marches and tramps made by these commanders  the first year of the war.  Well, we followed them.      CHEAT MOUNTAIN    One evening about 4 o'clock, the drummers of the regiment began to beat  their drums as hard as they could stave, and I saw men running in every  direction, and the camp soon became one scene of hurry and excitement.  I asked some one what all this hubbub meant.  He looked at me with utter  astonishment.  I saw soldiers running to their tents and grabbing their  guns and cartridge-boxes and hurry out again, the drums still rolling and  rattling.  I asked several other fellows what in the dickens did all this  mean?  Finally one fellow, who seemed scared almost out of his wits,  answered between a wail and a shriek, \"Why, sir, they are beating the  long roll.\"  Says I, \"What is the long roll for?\"  \"The long roll, man,  the long roll!  Get your gun; they are beating the long roll!\"  This was  all the information that I could get.  It was the first, last, and only  long roll that I ever heard.  But, then everything was new, and Colonel  Maney, ever prompt, ordered the assembly.  Without any command or bugle  sound, or anything, every soldier was in his place.  Tents, knapsacks and  everything was left indiscriminately.    We were soon on the march, and we marched on and on and on.  About night  it began to rain.  All our blankets were back in camp, but we were  expected every minute to be ordered into action.  That night we came  to Mingo Flats.  The rain still poured.

VIOLA ROSEBOROUGH          GRANDMA'S CHRISTMAS GIFTS.      Grandma Burns sat knitting busily in the sun one bright morning the  week before Christmas. The snow lay deep, and the hard crust glistened  like silver. All at once she heard little sighs of grief outside her  door. When she opened it there sat Peter and Jimmy Rice, two very poor  little boys, with their faces in their hands; and they were crying.    \"My patience!\" cried grandma. \"What can be the matter with two bright  little boys this sunny morning?\"    \"We don't have no good times,\" sighed little Peter.    \"We can't slide. We haven't any sleds,\" whimpered Jimmy.    \"Why, of course boys can't have a good time without sleds,\" said  grandma, cheerily. \"Let us look about and see if we can't find  something.\" And grandma's cap-border bobbed behind barrels and boxes  in the shed and all among the cobwebs in the garret; but nothing could  be found suitable.    \"Hum! I do believe this would do for little Pete;\" and the dear old  lady drew a large, pressed-tin pan off the top shelf in the pantry.  A long, smooth butter-tray was found for Jimmy. Grandma shook her  cap-border with laughter to see them skim over the hard crust in their  queer sleds. And the boys shouted and swung their hands as they flew  past the window.    \"I do expect they'll wear 'em about through,\" murmured grandma; \"but  boys must slide,--that's certain.\"    And the pan was scoured as bright as a new silver dollar and the red  paint was all gone off the wooden tray when Peter and Jimmy brought  their sleds back.    Grandma knitted faster than ever all that day, and her face was bright  with smiles. She was planning something. She went to see Job Easter  that night. He promised to make two small sleds for the pair of socks  she was knitting.    When the sleds were finished she dyed them red and drew a yellow  horse upon each one. Grandma called them horses, but no one would have  suspected it. Then the night before Christmas she drew on her great  socks over her shoes to keep her from slipping, put on her hood and  cloak, and dragged the little sleds over to Peter and Timmy's house.    She hitched them to the door-latch, and went home laughing all the  way.          MAMA'S HAPPY CHRISTMAS.      It had seemed to the little Wendell children that they would have  a very sad Christmas. Mama had been very ill, and papa had been so  anxious about mama that he could not think of anything else.    When Christmas Day came, however, mama was so much better that she  could lie on the lounge. The children all brought their stockings into  her room to open them.    \"You children all seem as happy as if you had had your usual Christmas  tree,\" said mama, as they sat around her.    \"Why, I _never_ had such a happy Christmas before,\" said sweet little  Agnes. \"And it's just because you are well again.\"    \"Now I think you must all run out for the rest of the day,\" said the  nurse, \"because your mama wants to see you all again this evening.\"    \"I wish we could get up something expressly for mama's amusement,\"  said Agnes, when they had gone into the nursery.    \"How would you like to have some tableaux in here?\" asked their French  governess, Miss Marcelle.    \"Oh, yes,\" they all cried, \"it would be fun, mama loves tableaux.\"    So all day long they were busy arranging five tableaux for the  evening. The tableaux were to be in the room which had folding-doors  opening into Mrs. Wendell's sitting-room.    [Illustration: MAMA'S HAPPY CHRISTMAS]    At the proper time Miss Marcelle stepped outside the folding-doors  and made a pretty little speech. She said that some young ladies and  a young gentleman had asked permission to show some tableaux to Mrs.  Wendell if she would like to see them. Mrs. Wendell replied that she  would be charmed.    Then mademoiselle announced the tableaux; opening the doors wide for  each one. This is a list of the tableaux: First, The Sleeping Beauty;  second, Little Red Riding Hood; third, The Fairy Queen; fourth, Old  Mother Hubbard; fifth, The Lord High Admiral.    Miss Marcelle had arranged everything so nicely, and Celeste, the  French maid, helped so much with the dressing, that the pictures all  went off without a single mistake.    [Illustration: LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]    [Illustration: THE LORD HIGH ADMIRAL]    Mama was delighted. She said she must kiss those dear young ladies,  and that delightful young man who had given her such a charming  surprise.    So all the children came in rosy and smiling.    \"Why, didn't you know us?\" asked the little Lord Admiral.    \"I know this,\" said mama, \"I am like Agnes; I _never_ had such a happy  Christmas before.\"    MIRIAM T. BARNARD.          THE CHRISTMAS CAROL OF THE BIRDS.      Do you know, when we are having such good times at Christmas, what  sweet music they have in Norway, that cold country across the sea? One  day in the year the simple peasants who live there make the birds very  happy, so that they sing, of their own free-will, a glad, joyous carol  on Christmas morning.    And this is why they sing on that morning more than on any  other. After the birds have found shelter from the north wind on  Christmas-eve, and the night is still and bright with stars, or even  if the storm be ever so severe, the good people bring out sheaves of  corn and wheat from their storehouses. Tying them on slender poles,  they raise them from every spire, barn, gatepost, and gable; then,  when the Christmas sun rises over the hills, every spire and gable  bursts forth into joyous song.    You can well believe that these songs of the birds make the people  of Norway very happy. They echo, with all their hearts, their living,  grateful anthem, \"Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace,  good-will to men!\"    MRS. G. HALL.          A TURKEY FOR ONE.      Lura's Uncle Roy is in Japan. He used to take Christmas dinner at  Lura's home. Now he could only write her papa to say a box of gifts  had been sent, and one was for his little girl.    The little girl clapped her hands, crying, \"Oh, mamma! don't you think  it is the chain and locket dear uncle said he would sometime give me?\"    \"No,\" replied her papa, reading on. \"Your uncle says it is a turkey  for one.\"    \"But we do not need turkeys from Japan,\" remarked the little daughter,  soberly.    Her papa smiled, and handed the open letter to her mamma.    \"Read it aloud, every bit,\" begged Lura, seeing her mamma was smiling,  too.    But her mamma folded the letter and said nothing.    On Christmas eve the box, which had just arrived, was opened, and  every one in the house was made glad with a present. Lura's was a  papier-mache turkey, nearly as large as the one brought home at the  same time by the market-boy.    Next morning, while the fowl in the kitchen was being roasted, Lura  placed hers before a window and watched people admire it as they  passed. All its imitation feathers, and even more its red wattles,  seemed to wish every man and woman, boy and girl, a Merry Christmas.    Lura had not spoken of the jewelry since her uncle's letter was read.  It is not nice for one who receives a gift to wish it was different.  Lura was not that kind of a child.    When dinner was nearly over, her papa said to her, \"My dear, you have  had as much of my turkey as you wanted; if you please, I will now try  some of yours.\"    \"Mine is what Uncle Roy calls a turkey for one,\" laughed Lura. She  turned in her chair towards where her bird had been strutting on the  window-sill, and added, in surprise, \"Why, what has become of him?\"    At that moment the servant brought in a huge platter. When room had  been made for it on the table it was set down in front of Lura's papa,  and on the dish was her turkey.    \"Oh, what fun!\" gayly exclaimed the child. \"Did uncle tell you to  pretend to serve it?\"    \"I have not finished what he directs me to do,\" her papa said, with a  flourish of the carving-knife.    \"But, papa--oh, please!\" Her hand was on his arm. \"You would not spoil  my beautiful bird from Japan!    A hidden spring was touched with the point of the knife. The breast  opened, and disclosed the fowl filled with choice toys and other  things. The first taken out was a tiny box; inside was a gold chain  and locket; the locket held Uncle Roy's picture.    It was a turkey for one,--for only Uncle Roy's niece. But all the  family shared the amusement.    LAVINIA S. GOODWIN.          LITTLE CHRISTMAS CAROLLERS.        We are a band of carollers,      We march through frost and snow,    But care not for the weather      As on our way we go.      At every hall or cottage      That stands upon our way,    We stop to give the people      Best wishes for the day.      We pray a merry Christmas,      Made bright by Christmas cheer,    With peace, and hope, and gladness      And all they may hold dear.      And for all those that happen      To pass us on our way    We have a smile, and wish them      A merry Christmas-day.    L.A. FRANCE          [Illustration: CHRISTMAS CAROLLERS]      WHAT HAPPENED CHRISTMAS EVE.      It was Christmas Eve and the frost fairies were busy getting ready  for Christmas Day. First of all they spread the loveliest white snow  carpet over the rough, bare ground; then they hung the bushes and  trees with icicles that flashed like diamonds in the moonlight. Later  on, they planned to draw beautiful frost pictures on the window panes,  to surprise the little children in the morning.    The stars shone brightly and the moon sent floods of light in every  nook and corner. How could any one think of sleeping when there was  such a glory outside!    Jessie and Fred had gone to bed very early so they might be the first  to shout \"Merry Christmas!\" but their eyes would not stay shut.    \"Oh dear! it must be 'most morning,\" said Fred; \"let us creep softly  down"]]]
