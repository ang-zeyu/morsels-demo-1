Soon, ah, soon the shy birds  Will be at their fluting,  And the morning planet  Rise above the garden;                                                   10  For there is a measure  Set to all things mortal.          XIV      Hesperus, bringing together  All that the morning star scattered,--    Sheep to be folded in twilight,  Children for mothers to fondle,--    Me too will bring to the dearest,                                         5  Tenderest breast in all Lesbos.          XV      In the grey olive-grove a small brown bird  Had built her nest and waited for the spring.  But who could tell the happy thought that came  To lodge beneath my scarlet tunic's fold?    All day long now is the green earth renewed                               5  With the bright sea-wind and the yellow blossoms.  From the cool shade I hear the silver plash  Of the blown fountain at the garden's end.          XVI      In the apple boughs the coolness  Murmurs, and the grey leaves flicker  Where sleep wanders.    In this garden all the hot noon  I await thy fluttering footfall                                           5  Through the twilight.          XVII      Pale rose leaves have fallen  In the fountain water;  And soft reedy flute-notes  Pierce the sultry quiet.    But I wait and listen,                                                    5  Till the trodden gravel  Tells me, all impatience,  It is Phaon's footstep.          XVIII      The courtyard of her house is wide  And cool and still when day departs.  Only the rustle of leaves is there    And running water.    And then her mouth, more delicate                                         5  Than the frail wood-anemone,  Brushes my cheek, and deeper grow    The purple shadows.          XIX      There is a medlar-tree  Growing in front of my lover's house,    And there all day  The wind makes a pleasant sound.    And when the evening comes,                                               5  We sit there together in the dusk,    And watch the stars  Appear in the quiet blue.          XX      I behold Arcturus going westward  Down the crowded slope of night-dark azure,  While the Scorpion with red Antares  Trails along the sea-line to the southward.    From the ilex grove there comes soft laughter,--                          5  My companions at their glad love-making,--  While that curly-headed boy from Naxos  With his jade flute marks the purple quiet.          XXI      Softly the first step of twilight  Falls on the darkening dial,  One by one kindle the lights    In Mitylene.    Noises are hushed in the courtyard,                                       5  The busy day is departing,  Children are called from their games,--    Herds from their grazing.    And from the deep-shadowed angles  Comes the soft murmur of lovers,                                         10  Then through the quiet of dusk    Bright sudden laughter.    From the hushed street, through the portal,  Where soon my lover will enter,  Comes the pure strain of a flute                                         15    Tender with passion.          XXII      Once you lay upon my bosom,  While the long blue-silver moonlight  Walked the plain, with that pure passion    All your own.    Now the moon is gone, the Pleiads                                         5  Gone, the dead of night is going;  Slips the hour, and on my bed    I lie alone.          XXIII      I loved thee, Atthis, in the long ago,  When the great oleanders were in flower  In the broad herded meadows full of sun.  And we would often at the fall of dusk  Wander together by the silver stream,                                     5  When the soft grass-heads were all wet with dew,  And purple-misted in the fading light.  And joy I knew and sorrow at thy voice,  And the superb magnificence of love,--  The loneliness that saddens solitude,                                    10  And the sweet speech that makes it durable,--  The bitter longing and the keen desire,  The sweet companionship through quiet days  In the slow ample beauty of the world,  And the unutterable glad release                                         15  Within the temple of the holy night.  O Atthis, how I loved thee long ago  In that fair perished summer by the sea!          XXIV      I shall be ever maiden,  If thou be not my lover,  And no man shall possess me  Henceforth and forever.    But thou alone shalt gather                                               5  This fragile flower of beauty,--  To crush and keep the fragrance  Like a holy incense.    Thou only shalt remember  This love of mine, or hallow                                             10  The coming years with gladness,  Calm and pride and passion.          XXV      It was summer when I found you  In the meadow long ago,--  And the golden vetch was growing    By the shore.    Did we falter when love took us                                           5  With a gust of great desire?  Does the barley bid the wind wait    In his course?          XXVI      I recall thy white gown, cinctured  With a linen belt, whereon  Violets were wrought, and scented  With strange perfumes out of Egypt.    And I know thy foot was covered                                           5  With fair Lydian broidered straps;  And the petals from a rose-tree  Fell within the marble basin.          XXVII      Lover, art thou of a surety  Not a learner of the wood-god?  Has the madness of his music    Never touched thee?    Ah, thou dear and godlike mortal,                                         5  If Pan takes thee for his pupil,  Make me but another Syrinx    For that piping.          XXVIII      With your head thrown backward  In my arm's safe hollow,  And your face all rosy  With the mounting fervour;    While the grave eyes greaten                                              5  With the wise new wonder,  Swimming in a love-mist  Like the haze of Autumn;    From that throat, the throbbing  Nightingale's for pleading,                                              10  Wayward, soft, and welling  Inarticulate love-notes,    Come the words that bubble  Up through broken laughter,  Sweeter than spring-water,                                               15  \"Gods, I am so happy!\"          XXIX      Ah, what am I but a torrent,  Headstrong, impetuous, broken,  Like the spent clamour of waters    In the blue canyon?    Ah, what art thou but a fern-frond,                                       5  Wet with blown spray from the river,  Diffident, lovely, sequestered,    Frail on the rock-ledge?    Yet, are we not for one brief day,  While the sun sleeps on the mountain,                                    10  Wild-hearted lover and loved one,    Safe in Pan's keeping?          XXX      Love shakes my soul, like a mountain wind    Falling upon the trees,  When they are swayed and whitened and bowed    As the great gusts will.    I know why Daphne sped through the grove                                  5    When the bright god came by,  And shut herself in the laurel's heart    For her silent doom.    Love fills my heart, like my lover's breath    Filling the hollow flute,                                              10  Till the magic wood awakes and cries    With remembrance and joy.    Ah, timid Syrinx, do I not know    Thy tremor of sweet fear?  For a beautiful and imperious player                                     15    Is the lord of life.          XXXI      Love, let the wind cry  On the dark mountain,  Bending the ash-trees  And the tall hemlocks,  With the great voice of                                                   5  Thunderous legions,  How I adore thee.    Let the hoarse torrent  In the blue canyon,  Murmuring mightily                                                       10  Out of the grey mist  Of primal chaos,  Cease not proclaiming  How I adore thee.    Let the long rhythm                                                      15  Of crunching rollers,  Breaking and bellowing  On the white seaboard,  Titan and tireless,  Tell, while the world stands,                                            20  How I adore thee.    Love, let the clear call  Of the tree-cricket,  Frailest of creatures,  Green as the young grass,                                                25  Mark with his trilling  Resonant bell-note,  How I adore thee.    Let the glad lark-song  Over the meadow,                                                         30  That melting lyric  Of molten silver,  Be for a signal  To listening mortals,  How I adore thee.                                                        35    But more than all sounds,  Surer, serener,  Fuller with passion  And exultation,  Let the hushed whisper                                                   40  In thine own heart say,  How I adore thee.          XXXII      Heart of mine, if all the altars  Of the ages stood before me,  Not one pure enough nor sacred  Could I find to lay this white, white    Rose of love upon.                                                      5    I who am not great enough to  Love thee with this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1239"],[0,"The Spirit of the Border: A Romance of the Early Settlers in the Ohio Valley (#3)"],[1," up. To try to convert the redskins and influence  me for good is in both cases impossible. How often have I said there  wasn't any good in me! My desire is to kill Indians, not preach to  them, Jim. I'm glad to see you; but I wish you hadn't come. This  wild frontier is no place for a preacher.\"    \"I think it is,\" said Jim, quietly.    \"What of Rose--the girl you were to marry?\"    Joe glanced quickly at his brother. Jim's face paled slightly as he  turned away.    \"I'll speak once more of her, and then, never again,\" he answered.  \"You knew Rose better than I did. Once you tried to tell me she was  too fond of admiration, and I rebuked you; but now I see that your  wider experience of women had taught you things I could not then  understand. She was untrue. When you left Williamsburg, apparently  because you had gambled with Jewett and afterward fought him, I was  not misled. You made the game of cards a pretense; you sought it  simply as an opportunity to wreak your vengeance on him for his  villainy toward me. Well, it's all over now. Though you cruelly beat  and left him disfigured for life, he will live, and you are saved  from murder, thank God! When I learned of your departure I yearned  to follow. Then I met a preacher who spoke of having intended to go  West with a Mr. Wells, of the Moravian Mission. I immediately said I  would go in his place, and here I am. I'm fortunate in that I have  found both him and you.\"    \"I'm sorry I didn't kill Jewett; I certainly meant to. Anyway,  there's some comfort in knowing I left my mark on him. He was a  sneaking, cold-blooded fellow, with his white hair and pale face,  and always fawning round the girls. I hated him, and gave it to him  good.\" Joe spoke musingly and complacently as though it was a  trivial thing to compass the killing of a man.    \"Well, Jim, you're here now, and there's no help for it. We'll go  along with this Moravian preacher and his nieces. If you haven't any  great regrets for the past, why, all may be well yet. I can see that  the border is the place for me. But now, Jim, for once in your life  take a word of advice from me. We're out on the frontier, where  every man looks after himself. Your being a minister won't protect  you here where every man wears a knife and a tomahawk, and where  most of them are desperadoes. Cut out that soft voice and most of  your gentle ways, and be a little more like your brother. Be as kind  as you like, and preach all you want to; but when some of these  buckskin-legged frontiermen try to walk all over you, as they will,  take your own part in a way you have never taken it before. I had my  lesson the first few days out with that wagon-train. It was a case  of four fights; but I'm all right now.\"    \"Joe, I won't run, if that's what you mean,\" answered Jim, with a  laugh. \"Yes, I understand that a new life begins here, and I am  content. If I can find my work in it, and remain with you, I shall  be happy.\"    \"Ah! old Mose! I'm glad to see you,\" Joe cried to the big dog who  came nosing round him. \"You've brought this old fellow; did you  bring the horses?\"    \"Look behind the wagon.\"    With the dog bounding before him, Joe did as he was directed, and  there found two horses tethered side by side. Little wonder that his  eyes gleamed with delight. One was jet-black; the other iron-gray  and in every line the clean-limbed animals showed the thoroughbred.  The black threw up his slim head and whinnied, with affection  clearly shining in his soft, dark eyes as he recognized his master.    \"Lance, old fellow, how did I ever leave you!\" murmured Joe, as he  threw his arm over the arched neck. Mose stood by looking up, and  wagging his tail in token of happiness at the reunion of the three  old friends. There were tears in Joe's eyes when, with a last  affectionate caress, he turned away from his pet.    \"Come, Jim, I'll take you to Mr. Wells.\"    They stated across the little square, while Mose went back under the  wagon; but at a word from Joe he bounded after them, trotting  contentedly at their heels. Half way to the cabins a big, raw-boned  teamster, singing in a drunken voice, came staggering toward them.  Evidently he had just left the group of people who had gathered near  the Indians.    \"I didn't expect to see drunkenness out here,\" said Jim, in a low  tone.    \"There's lots of it. I saw that fellow yesterday when he couldn't  walk. Wentz told me he was a bad customer.\"    The teamster, his red face bathed in perspiration, and his sleeves  rolled up, showing brown, knotty arms, lurched toward them. As they  met he aimed a kick at the dog; but Mose leaped nimbly aside,  avoiding the heavy boot. He did not growl, nor show his teeth; but  the great white head sank forward a little, and the lithe body  crouched for a spring.    \"Don't touch that dog; he'll tear your leg off!\" Joe cried sharply.    \"Say, pard, cum an' hev' a drink,\" replied the teamster, with a  friendly leer.    \"I don't drink,\" answered Joe, curtly, and moved on.    The teamster growled something of which only the word \"parson\" was  intelligible to the brothers. Joe stopped and looked back. His gray  eyes seemed to contract; they did not flash, but shaded and lost  their warmth. Jim saw the change, and, knowing what it signified,  took Joe's arm as he gently urged him away. The teamster's shrill  voice could be heard until they entered the fur-trader's cabin.    An old man with long, white hair flowing from beneath his  wide-brimmed hat, sat near the door holding one of Mrs. Wentz's  children on his knee. His face was deep-lined and serious; but  kindness shone from his mild blue eyes.    \"Mr. Wells, this is my brother James. He is a preacher, and has come  in place of the man you expected from Williamsburg.\"    The old minister arose, and extended his hand, gazing earnestly at  the new-comer meanwhile. Evidently he approved of what he saw in his  quick scrutiny of the other's face, for his lips were wreathed with  a smile of welcome.    \"Mr. Downs, I am glad to meet you, and to know you will go with me.  I thank God I shall take into the wilderness one who is young enough  to carry on the work when my days are done.\"    \"I will make it my duty to help you in whatsoever way lies in my  power,\" answered Jim, earnestly.    \"We have a great work before us. I have heard many scoffers who  claim that it is worse than folly to try to teach these fierce  savages Christianity; but I know it can be done, and my heart is in  the work. I have no fear; yet I would not conceal from you, young  man, that the danger of going among these hostile Indians must be  great.\"    \"I will not hesitate because of that. My sympathy is with the  redman. I have had an opportunity of studying Indian nature and  believe the race inherently noble. He has been driven to make war,  and I want to help him into other paths.\"    Joe left the two ministers talking earnestly and turned toward Mrs.  Wentz. The fur-trader's wife was glowing with pleasure. She held in  her hand several rude trinkets, and was explaining to her listener,  a young woman, that the toys were for the children, having been  brought all the way from Williamsburg.    \"Kate, where's Nell?\" Joe asked of the girl.    \"She went on an errand for Mrs. Wentz.\"    Kate Wells was the opposite of her sister. Her motions were slow,  easy and consistent with her large, full, form. Her brown eyes and  hair contrasted sharply with Nell's. The greatest difference in the  sisters lay in that Nell's face was sparkling and full of the fire  of her eager young life, while Kate's was calm, like the unruffled  surface of a deep lake.    \"That's Jim, my brother. We're going with you,\" said Joe.    \"Are you? I'm glad,\" answered the girl, looking at the handsome  earnest face of the young minister.    \"Your brother's like you for all the world,\" whispered Mrs. Wentz.    \"He does look like you,\" said Kate, with her slow smile.    \"Which means you think, or hope, that that is all,\" retorted Joe  laughingly. \"Well, Kate, there the resemblance ends, thank God for  Jim!\"    He spoke in a sad, bitter tone which caused both women to look at  him wonderingly. Joe had to them ever been full of surprises; never  until then had they seen evidences of sadness in his face. A  moment's silence ensued. Mrs. Wentz gazed lovingly at the children  who were playing with the trinkets; while Kate mused over the young  man's remark, and began studying his, half-averted face. She felt  warmly drawn to him by the strange expression in the glance he had  given his brother. The tenderness in his eyes did not harmonize with  much of this wild and reckless boy's behavior. To Kate he had always  seemed so bold, so cold, so different from other men, and yet here  was proof that Master Joe loved his brother.    The murmured conversation of the two ministers was interrupted by a  low cry from outside the cabin. A loud, coarse laugh followed, and  then a husky voice:    \"Hol' on, my purty lass.\"'    Joe took two long strides, and was on the door-step. He saw Nell  struggling violently in the grasp of the half-drunken teamster.    \"I'll jes' hev' to kiss this lassie fer luck,\" he said in a tone of  good humor.    At the same instant Joe saw three loungers laughing, and a fourth,  the grizzled frontiersman, starting forward with a yell.    \"Let me go!\" cried Nell.    Just when the teamster had pulled her close to him, and was bending  his red, moist face to hers, two brown, sinewy hands grasped his  neck with an angry clutch. Deprived thus of breath, his mouth  opened, his tongue protruded; his eyes seemed starting from their  sockets, and his arms beat the air. Then he was lifted and flung  with a crash against the cabin wall. Falling, he lay in a heap on  the grass, while the blood flowed from a cut on his temple.    \"What's this?\" cried a man, authoritatively. He had come swiftly up,  and arrived at the scene where stood the grizzled frontiersman.    \"It"]]]
