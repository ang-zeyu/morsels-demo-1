He gave to France a positive claim to a great region, whose  illimitable wealth and possibilities were never fully appreciated by the  king and the people of France even in the later times of her dominion.  Francis, in 1540, gave a commission to Jean Francois de la Roque, Sieur  de Roberval, to act as his viceroy and lieutenant-general in the  country discovered by Cartier, who was elevated to the position of  captain general and master pilot of the new expedition. As the Viceroy  was unable to complete his arrangements by 1541, Cartier was obliged to  sail in advance, and again passed a winter on the St. Lawrence, not at  Stadacona but at Cap Rouge, a few miles to the west, where he built a  post which he named Charlesbourg-Royal. He appears to have returned to  France some time during the summer of 1542, while Roberval was on his  way to the St. Lawrence. Roberval found his way without his master pilot  to Charlesbourg-Royal, which he renamed France-Roy, and where he erected  buildings of a very substantial character in the hope of establishing a  permanent settlement. His selection of colonists--chiefly taken from  jails and purlieus of towns--was most unhappy, and after a bitter  experience he returned to France, probably in the autumn of 1543, and  disappeared from Canadian history.    From the date of Cartier's last voyage until the beginning of the  seventeenth century, a period of nearly sixty years, nothing was done to  settle the lands of the new continent. Fishermen alone continued to  frequent the great gulf, which was called for years the \"Square gulf\" or  \"Golfo quadrado,\" or \"Quarre,\" on some European maps, until it assumed,  by the end of the sixteenth century, the name it now bears. The name  Saint-Laurens was first given by Cartier to the harbour known as  Sainte-Genevieve (or sometimes Pillage Bay), on the northern shore of  Canada, and gradually extended to the gulf and river. The name of  Labrador, which was soon established on all maps, had its origin in the  fact that Gaspar Cortereal brought back with him a number of natives who  were considered to be \"admirably calculated for labour.\"    In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the English began to take a prominent  part in that maritime enterprise which was to lead to such remarkable  results in the course of three centuries. The names of the ambitious  navigators, Frobisher and Davis, are connected with those arctic waters  where so much money, energy, and heroism have been expended down to the  present time. Under the influence of the great Ralegh, whose fertile  imagination was conceiving plans of colonization in America, Sir  Humphrey Gilbert, his brother-in-law, took possession of Newfoundland on  a hill overlooking the harbour of St. John's. English enterprise,  however, did not extend for many years to any other part of North  Eastern America than Newfoundland, which is styled Baccalaos on the  Hakluyt map of 1597, though the present name appeared from a very early  date in English statutes and records. The island, however, for a century  and longer, was practically little more than \"a great ship moored near  the banks during the fishing season, for the convenience of English  fishermen,\" while English colonizing enterprise found a deeper interest  in Virginia with its more favourable climate and southern products. It  was England's great rival, France, that was the pioneer at the beginning  of the seventeenth century in the work of exploring, and settling the  countries now comprised within the Dominion of Canada.    France first attempted to settle the indefinite region, long known as  _La Cadie_ or _Acadie_[1]. The Sieur de Monts, Samuel Champlain, and the  Baron de Poutrincourt were the pioneers in the exploration of this  country. Their first post was erected on Dochet Island, within the mouth  of the St. Croix River, the present boundary between the state of Maine  and the province of New Brunswick; but this spot was very soon found  unsuitable, and the hopes of the pioneers were immediately turned  towards the beautiful basin, which was first named Port Royal by  Champlain. The Baron de Poutrincourt obtained a grant of land around  this basin, and determined to make his home in so beautiful a spot. De  Monts, whose charter was revoked in 1607, gave up the project of  colonizing Acadia, whose history from that time is associated for years  with the misfortunes of the Biencourts, the family name of Baron de  Poutrincourt; but the hopes of this adventurous nobleman were never  realized. In 1613 an English expedition from Virginia, under the command  of Captain Argall, destroyed the struggling settlement at Fort Royal,  and also prevented the establishment of a Jesuit mission on the island  of Monts-Deserts, which owes its name to Champlain. Acadia had  henceforth a checquered history, chiefly noted for feuds between rival  French leaders and for the efforts of the people of New England to  obtain possession of Acadia. Port Royal was captured in 1710 by General  Nicholson, at the head of an expedition composed of an English fleet and  the militia of New England. Then it received the name of Annapolis Royal  in honour of Queen Anne, and was formally ceded with all of Acadia  \"according to its ancient limits\" to England by the treaty of Utrecht.    [1: This name is now generally admitted to belong to the language of the  Micmac Indians of the Atlantic provinces. It means a place, or locality,  and is always associated with another word descriptive of some special  natural production; for instance, Shubenacadie, or Segubunakade, is the  place where the ground-nut, or Indian potato, grows. We find the first  official mention of the word in the commission given by Henry IV of  France to the Sieur de Monts in 1604.]    It was not in Acadia, but in the valley of the St. Lawrence, that France  made her great effort to establish her dominion in North America. Samuel  Champlain, the most famous man in the history of French Canada, laid the  foundation of the present city of Quebec in the month of June, 1608, or  three years after the removal of the little Acadian colony from St.  Croix Island to the basin of the Annapolis. The name Quebec is now  generally admitted to be an adaptation of an Indian word, meaning a  contraction of the river or strait, a distinguishing feature of the St.  Lawrence at this important point. The first buildings were constructed  by Champlain on a relatively level piece of ground, now occupied by a  market-house and close to a famous old church erected in the days of  Frontenac, in commemoration of the victorious repulse of the New England  expedition led by Phipps. For twenty-seven years Champlain struggled  against constantly accumulating difficulties to establish a colony on  the St. Lawrence. He won the confidence of the Algonquin and Huron tubes  of Canada, who then lived on the St. Lawrence and Ottawa rivers, and in  the vicinity of Georgian Bay. Recognizing the necessity of an alliance  with the Canadian Indians, who controlled all the principal avenues to  the great fur-bearing regions, he led two expeditions, composed of  Frenchmen, Hurons, and Algonquins, against the Iroquois or Confederacy  of the Five Nations[2]--the Mohawks, the Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas,  and Senecas--who inhabited the fertile country stretching from the  Genesee to the Hudson River in the present state of New York. Champlain  consequently excited against his own people the inveterate hostility of  the bravest, cruellest and ablest Indians with whom Europeans have ever  come in contact in America. Champlain probably had no other alternative  open to him than to become the active ally of the Canadian Indians, on  whose goodwill and friendship he was forced to rely; but it is also  quite probable that he altogether underrated the ability and bravery of  the Iroquois who, in later years, so often threatened the security of  Canada, and more than once brought the infant colony to the very verge  of ruin.    [2: In 1715 the confederacy was joined by the Tuscaroras, a southern  branch of the same family, and was then called more properly the Six  Nations.]    It was during Champlain's administration of affairs that the Company of  the Hundred Associates was formed under the auspices of Cardinal  Richelieu, with the express object of colonizing Canada and developing  the fur-trade and other commercial enterprises on as large a scale as  possible. The Company had ill-fortune from the outset. The first  expedition it sent to the St. Lawrence was captured by a fleet commanded  by David Kirk, a gentleman of Derbyshire, who in the following year also  took Quebec, and carried Champlain and his followers to England. The  English were already attempting settlements on the shores of  Massachusetts Bay; and the poet and courtier, Sir William Alexander,  afterwards known as the Earl of Stirling, obtained from the King of  England all French Acadia, which he named Nova Scotia and offered to  settlers in baronial giants. A Scotch colony was actually established  for a short time at Port Royal under the auspices of Alexander, but in  1632, by the treaty of St. Germain-en-Laye, both Acadia and Canada were  restored to France. Champlain returned to Quebec, but the Company of the  Hundred Associates had been severely crippled by the ill-luck which  attended its first venture, and was able to do very little for the  struggling colony during the three remaining years of Champlain's life.    The Recollets or Franciscans, who had first come to the country in 1615,  now disappeared, and the Jesuits assumed full control in the wide field  of effort that Canada offered to the missionary. The Jesuits had, in  fact, made their appearance in Canada as early as 1625, or fourteen  years after two priests of their order, Ennemond Masse and Pierre Biard,  had gone to Acadia to labour among the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12664"],[0,"Lyrics of Earth (#3)"],[1,"deep of hue,      And slender hawkweed tall and softly fair,          And rosy tops of fleabane veiled with dew.        So with thronged voices and unhasting flight          The fervid hours with long return go by;          The far-heard hylas piping shrill and high      Tell the slow moments of the solemn night              With unremitting cry;      Lustrous and large out of the gathering drouth          The planets gleam; the baleful Scorpion      Trails his dim fires along the droused south;          The silent world-incrusted round moves on.        And all the dim night long the moon's white beams          Nestle deep down in every brooding tree,          And sleeping birds, touched with a silly glee,      Waken at midnight from their blissful dreams,              And carol brokenly.      Dim surging motions and uneasy dreads          Scare the light slumber from men's busy eyes,      And parted lovers on their restless beds          Toss and yearn out, and cannot sleep for sighs.        Oft have I striven, sweet month, to figure thee,          As dreamers of old time were wont to feign,          In living form of flesh, and striven in vain;      Yet when some sudden old-world mystery              Of passion fired my brain,      Thy shape hath flashed upon me like no dream,          Wandering with scented curls that heaped the breeze,      Or by the hollow of some reeded stream          Sitting waist-deep in white anemones;        And even as I glimpsed thee thou wert gone,          A dream for mortal eyes too proudly coy,          Yet in thy place for subtle thought's employ      The golden magic clung, a light that shone              And filled me with thy joy.      Before me like a mist that streamed and fell          All names and shapes of antique beauty passed      In garlanded procession with the swell          Of flutes between the beechen stems; and last,        I saw the Arcadian valley, the loved wood,          Alpheus stream divine, the sighing shore,          And through the cool green glades, awake once more,      Psyche, the white-limbed goddess, still pursued,              Fleet-footed as of yore,      The noonday ringing with her frighted peals,          Down the bright sward and through the reeds she ran,      Urged by the mountain echoes, at her heels          The hot-blown cheeks and trampling feet of Pan.          DISTANCE          To the distance! Ah, the distance!          Blue and broad and dim!      Peace is not in burgh or meadow,          But beyond the rim.        Aye, beyond it, far beyond it;          Follow still my soul,      Till this earth is lost in heaven,          And thou feel'st the whole.          THE BIRD AND THE HOUR          The sun looks over a little hill        And floods the valley with gold--              A torrent of gold;      And the hither field is green and still;        Beyond it a cloud outrolled,        Is glowing molten and bright;      And soon the hill, and the valley and all,              With a quiet fall,        Shall be gathered into the night.        And yet a moment more,              Out of the silent wood,        As if from the closing door      Of another world and another lovelier mood,        Hear'st thou the hermit pour--              So sweet! so magical!--      His golden music, ghostly beautiful.          AFTER RAIN          For three whole days across the sky,      In sullen packs that loomed and broke,      With flying fringes dim as smoke,      The columns of the rain went by;      At every hour the wind awoke;          The darkness passed upon the plain;          The great drops rattled at the pane.        Now piped the wind, or far aloof      Fell to a sough remote and dull;      And all night long with rush and lull      The rain kept drumming on the roof:      I heard till ear and sense were full          The clash or silence of the leaves,          The gurgle in the creaking eaves.        But when the fourth day came--at noon,      The darkness and the rain were by;      The sunward roofs were steaming dry;      And all the world was flecked and strewn      With shadows from a fleecy sky.          The haymakers were forth and gone,          And every rillet laughed and shone.        Then, too, on me that loved so well      The world, despairing in her blight,      Uplifted with her least delight,      On me, as on the earth, there fell      New happiness of mirth and might;          I strode the valleys pied and still;          I climbed upon the breezy hill.        I watched the gray hawk wheel and drop,      Sole shadow on the shining world;      I saw the mountains clothed and curled,      With forest ruffling to the top;      I saw the river's length unfurled,          Pale silver down the fruited plain,          Grown great and stately with the rain.        Through miles of shadow and soft heat,      Where field and fallow, fence and tree,      Were all one world of greenery,      I heard the robin ringing sweet,      The sparrow piping silverly,          The thrushes at the forest's hem;          And as I went I sang with them.          CLOUD-BREAK          With a turn of his magical rod,      That extended and suddenly shone,      From the round of his glory some god      Looks forth and is gone.        To the summit of heaven the clouds      Are rolling aloft like steam;      There's a break in their infinite shrouds,      And below it a gleam.      O'er the drift of the river a whiff      Comes out from the blossoming shore;      And the meadows are greening, as if      They never were green before.        The islands are kindled with gold      And russet and emerald dye;      And the interval waters outrolled      Are more blue than the sky.      From my feet to the heart of the hills      The spirits of May intervene,      And a vapor of azure distills      Like a breath on the opaline green.        Only a moment!--and then      The chill and the shadow decline,      On the eyes of rejuvenate men      That were wide and divine.          THE MOON-PATH          The full, clear moon uprose and spread        Her cold, pale splendor o'er the sea;      A light-strewn path that seemed to lead        Outward into eternity.      Between the darkness and the gleam        An old-world spell encompassed me:      Methought that in a godlike dream        I trod upon the sea.        And lo! upon that glimmering road,        In shining companies unfurled,      The trains of many a primal god,        The monsters of the elder world;      Strange creatures that, with silver wings,        Scarce touched the ocean's thronging floor,      The phantoms of old tales, and things        Whose shapes are known no more.        Giants and demi-gods who once        Were dwellers of the earth and sea,      And they who from Deucalion's stones,        Rose men without an infancy;      Beings on whose majestic lids        Time's solemn secrets seemed to dwell,      Tritons and pale-limbed Nereids,        And forms of heaven and hell.        Some who were heroes long of yore,        When the great world was hale and young;      And some whose marble lips yet pour        The murmur of an antique tongue;      Sad queens, whose names are like soft moans,        Whose griefs were written up in gold;      And some who on their silver thrones        Were goddesses of old.        As if I had been dead indeed,        And come into some after-land,      I saw them pass me, and take heed,        And touch me with each mighty hand;      And evermore a murmurous stream,        So beautiful they seemed to me,      Not less than in a godlike dream        I trod the shining sea.          COMFORT OF THE FIELDS          What would'st thou have for easement after grief,        When the rude world hath used thee with despite,        And care sits at thine elbow day and night,      Filching thy pleasures like a subtle thief?      To me, when life besets me in such wise,      'Tis sweetest to break forth, to drop the chain,        And grasp the freedom of this pleasant earth,        To roam in idleness and sober mirth,      Through summer airs and summer lands, and drain      The comfort of wide fields unto tired eyes.        By hills and waters, farms and solitudes,        To wander by the day with wilful feet;        Through fielded valleys wide with yellowing wheat;      Along gray roads that run between deep woods,      Murmurous and cool; through hallowed slopes of pine,        Where the long daylight dreams, unpierced, unstirred,        And only the rich-throated thrush is heard;      By lonely forest brooks that froth and shine        In bouldered crannies buried in the hills;      By broken beeches tangled with wild vine,        And log-strewn rivers murmurous with mills.        In upland pastures, sown with gold, and sweet        With the keen perfume of the ripening grass,        Where wings of birds and filmy shadows pass,      Spread thick as stars with shining marguerite;      To haunt old fences overgrown with brier,        Muffled in vines, and hawthorns, and wild cherries,        Rank poisonous ivies, red-bunched elderberries,      And pied blossoms to the heart's desire,        Gray mullein towering into yellow bloom,        Pink-tasseled milkweed, breathing dense perfume,      And swarthy vervain, tipped with violet fire.        To hear at eve the bleating of far flocks,        The mud-hen's whistle from the marsh at morn;        To skirt with deafened ears and brain o'erborne      Some foam-filled rapid charging down its rocks      With iron roar of waters; far away        Across wide-reeded meres, pensive with noon,        To hear the querulous outcry of the loon;      To lie among deep rocks, and watch all day        On liquid heights the snowy clouds melt by;      Or hear from wood-capped mountain-brows the jay        Pierce the bright morning with his jibing cry.        To feast on summer sounds; the jolted wains,        The thrasher"]]]
