Can the direct and inevitable  tendency of the head-money system be doubted? Are cruisers the only men  over whom motives have no influence? Then why offer a reward at all?  When they want no stimulus to perform their duty, why tell them that if  the ship is empty, they get a hundred pounds: if laden, five thousand?  They know the rules of arithmetic;--they understand the force of  numbers. But, in truth, there is not an individual on all the coast of  Africa who will be misled by such appeals, or suffer all this to divert  them from their purpose of denouncing the system. There are persons high  in rank among the best servants of the crown, who know the facts from  their own observations, and who are ready to bear witness to the truth,  in spite of all the attempts that have been made to silence them.    The other great object of the African Institution regarded the West  Indies. The preparation of the negroes for that freedom which was their  absolute right, and could only be withheld for an hour, on the ground of  their not being prepared for it, and therefore being better without it,  was the first thing to be accomplished. Here the friends of the  abolition, all but Mr. Stephen, suffered a great disappointment. He  alone had uniformly-foretold that the hopes held out, as it seemed very  reasonably, of better treatment resulting from the stoppage of the  supply of hands, were fallacious. All else had supposed that interest  might operate on men whom principle had failed to sway; that they whom  no feelings of compassion for their fellow-creatures could move to do  their duty, might be touched by a feeling of their own advantage, when  interest coincided with duty. The Slave-mart is now closed, it was said;  surely the stock on hand will be saved by all means, and not wasted when  it can no longer be replaced. The argument was purposely rested on the  low ground of regarding human beings as cattle, or even as inanimate  chattels, and it was conceived that human life would be regarded of as  much value as the wear and tear of beasts, of furniture, or of tools.  Hence it was expected that a better system of treatment would follow,  from the law which closed the African market, and warned every planter  that his stock must be spared by better treatment, and kept up by  breeding, since it no longer could be, as it hitherto had been,  maintained by new supplies.    Two considerations were, in these arguments, kept out of view, both of a  practical nature, and both known to Mr. Stephen,--the cultivation of the  Islands by agents having wholly different interests from their masters,  and the gambling spirit of trading and culture which long habit had  implanted in the West Indian nature. The comforts of the slave depended  infinitely more upon the agent on the spot, than the owner generally  resident in the mother country; and though the interest of the latter  might lead to the saving of negro life, and care for negro comforts, the  agent had no such motives to influence his conduct; besides, it was with  the eyes of this agent that the planter must see, and he gave no  credence to any accounts but his. Now the consequence of cruelty is to  make men at war with its objects. No one but a most irritable person  feels angry with his beast, and even the anger of such a person is of a  moment's duration. But towards an inanimate chattel even the most  irritable of sane men can feel nothing like rage. Why? Because in the  one case there is little, in the other no conflict or resistance at all.  It is otherwise with a slave; he is human, and can disobey--can even  resist. This feeling always rankles in his oppressor's bosom, and makes  the tyrannical superior hate, and the more oppress his slave. The agent  on the spot feels thus, and thus acts; nor can the voice of the owner at  a distance be heard, even if interest, clearly proved, were to prompt  another course. But the chief cause of the evil is the spirit of  speculation, and it affects and rules resident owners even more than  absentees. Let sugar rise in price, and all cold calculations of  ultimate loss to the gang are lost in the vehement thirst of great  present gain. All, or nearly all, planters are in distressed  circumstances. They look to the next few years as their time; and if the  sun shines they must make hay. They are in the mine, toiling for a  season, with every desire to escape and realize something to spend  elsewhere. Therefore they make haste to be rich, and care little, should  the speculation answer and much sugar bring in great gain, what becomes  of the gang ten years hence. Add to all this, that any interference of  the local legislatures to discourage sordid or cruel management, to  clothe the slaves with rights, to prepare them for freedom by better  education, to pave the way for emancipation by restraining the master's  power, to create an intermediate State of transition from slavery to  freedom by partial liberty, as by attaching them to the soil, and  placing them in the preparatory state through which our ancestors in  Europe passed from bondage in gross to entire independence--all such  measures were in the absolute discretion; not of the planters, but of  the resident agents, one of the worst communities in the world, who had  little interest in preparing for an event which they deprecated, and  whose feelings of party, as well as individually, were all ranged on the  oppressor's side. All this Mr. Stephen, enlightened by experience, and  wise by long reflection, clearly and alone foresaw; all this vision of  the future was too surely realized by the event. No improvement of  treatment took place; no additional liberality in the supplies was  shown; no abstinence in the exaction of labour appeared; no interference  of the Colonial Legislature to check misconduct was witnessed; far less  was the least disposition perceived to give any rights to the slaves,  any security against oppression, any title independent of his Master,  any intermediate state or condition which might prepare him for freedom.  It is enough to say, that a measure which every man, except Mr. Stephen,  had regarded as the natural, almost the necessary effect of the  abolition--attaching the slaves to the soil--was not so much as  propounded, far less adopted; it may be even said, was never mentioned  in any one local assembly of any of our numerous colonies, during the  thirty years which elapsed between the abolition and the emancipation!  This is unquestionable, and it is decisive.    As soon as it began to be perceived that such was likely to be the  result of the abolition in regard to the emancipation, Mr. Stephen's  authority with his coadjutors, always high, rose in proportion to the  confirmations which the event had lent his predictions; and his zealous  endeavours and unwearied labours for the subversion of the accursed  system became both more extensive and more effectual. If, however,  strict justice requires the tribute which we have paid to this eminent  person's distinguished services, justice also renders it imperative on  the historian of the Abolition in all its branches, to record an error  into which he fell. Having originally maintained that the traffic would  survive the Act of 1807, in which he was right, that Act only imposing  pecuniary penalties, he persisted in the same opinion after the Act of  1811 had made slave-trading a felony; and long after it had been  effectually put down in the British dominions, he continued to maintain  that it was carried on nearly as much as ever, reasoning upon  calculations drawn from the island returns. Hence he insisted upon a  general Registry Act, as essential to prevent the continuance of an  importation which had little or no real existence. The importance of  such a measure was undeniable, with a view to secure the good treatment  of the negroes in the islands; but the extinction of the Slave Trade had  long before been effectually accomplished.    In the efforts to obtain Negro Emancipation, all the Abolitionists were  now prepared to join. The conduct of the Colonial Assemblies having long  shown the fallacy of those expectations which had been entertained of  the good work being done in the islands as soon as the supply of new  hands should be stopped by the Abolition, there remained no longer any  doubt whatever, that the mother country alone could abate a nuisance  hateful in the sight of God and man. Constant opportunities were  therefore offered to agitate this great question, which was taken up by  the enlightened, the humane, and the religious, all over the empire.    The magnitude of the subject was indeed worthy of all the interest it  excited. The destiny of nearly a million of human beings--nay, the  question whether they should be treated as men with rational souls, or  as the beasts which perish--should enjoy the liberty to which all God's  creatures are entitled, as of right, or be harassed, oppressed,  tormented, and stinted, both as regarded bodily food, and spiritual  instruction--whether the colonies should be peopled with tyrants and  barbarians, or inhabited by civilized and improving christian  communities--was one calculated to put in action all the best principles  of our nature, and to move all the noblest feelings of the human heart.    Thomas Clarkson, as far as his means extended, aided this great  excitement. He renewed his committees of correspondence all over the  country; aided by the Society of Friends, his early and steady  coadjutors in this pious work, he recommenced the epistolary intercourse  with the provinces, held for so many hopeless years on the Slave Trade,  but now made far more promising by the victory which had been obtained,  and by the unanimity with which all Abolitionists now were resolved to  procure emancipation.

It is the morning  before the sun is up, and when the dew is on the grass. Take the stories  which are translated in the present volume, and you might fancy them all  written by Ariosto, with a difference; the _Death of Agrican_ perhaps  with minuter touches of nature, but certainly not with greater simplicity  and earnestness. In the _Saracen Friends_ there is just Ariosto's balance  of passion and levity; and in the story which I have entitled _Seeing and  Believing_, his exhibition of triumphant cunning. During the lives of  Pulci and Boiardo, the fierce passions and severe ethics of Dante had  been gradually giving way to a gentler and laxer state of opinion before  the progress of luxury; and though Boiardo's enamoured Paladin retains a  kind of virtue not common in any age to the heroes of warfare, the lord  of Scandiano, who appears to have recited his poem, sometimes to his  vassals and sometimes to the ducal circle at court, intimates a smiling  suspicion that such a virtue would be considered a little rude and  obsolete by his hearers. Pulci's wandering gallant, Uliviero, who in  Dante's time would have been a scandalous profligate, had become the  prototype of the court-lover in Boiardo's. The poet, however, in his most  favourite characters, retained and recommended a truer sentiment, as in  the instance of the loves of Brandimart and Fiordelisa; and there is  a graceful cheerfulness in some of his least sentimental ones, which  redeems them from grossness. I know not a more charming fancy in the  whole loving circle of fairy-land, than the female's shaking her long  tresses round Mandricardo, in order to furnish him with a mantle, when he  issues out of the enchanted fountain.[5]    But Boiardo's poem was unfinished: there are many prosaical passages  in it, many lame and harsh lines, incorrect and even ungrammatical  expressions, trivial images, and, above all, many Lombard provincialisms,  which are not in their nature of a \"significant or graceful\" sort,[6] and  which shocked the fastidious Florentines, the arbiters of Italian taste.  It was to avoid these in his own poetry, that Boiardo's countryman  Ariosto carefully studied the Tuscan dialect, if not visited Florence  itself; and the consequence was, that his greater genius so obscured the  popularity of his predecessor, that a remarkable process, unique in the  history of letters, appears to have been thought necessary to restore  its perusal. The facetious Berni, a Tuscan wit full of genius, without  omitting any particulars of consequence, or adding a single story except  of himself, re-cast the whole poem of Boiardo, altering the diction of  almost every stanza, and supplying introductions to the cantos after the  manner of Ariosto; and the Florentine idiom and unfailing spirit of this  re-fashioner's verse (though, what is very curious, not till after a long  chance of its being overlooked itself, and a posthumous editorship which  has left doubts on the authority of the text) gradually effaced almost  the very mention of the man's name who had supplied him with the whole  staple commodity of his book, with all the heart of its interest, and  with far the greater part of the actual words. The first edition of Berni  was prohibited in consequence of its containing a severe attack on the  clergy; but even the prohibition did not help to make it popular. The  reader may imagine a similar occurrence in England, by supposing that  Dryden had re-written the whole of Chaucer, and that his reconstruction  had in the course of time as much surpassed the original in popularity,  as his version of the _Flower and the Leaf_ did, up to the beginning of  the present century.    I do not mean to compare Chaucer with Boiardo, or Dryden with Berni. Fine  poet as I think Boiardo, I hold Chaucer to be a far finer; and spirited,  and in some respects admirable, as are Dryden's versions of Chaucer, they  do not equal that of Boiardo by the Tuscan. Dryden did not apprehend  the sentiment of Chaucer in any such degree as Berni did that of his  original. Indeed, Mr. Panizzi himself, to whom the world is indebted both  for the only good edition of Boiardo and for the knowledge of the most  curious facts respecting Berni's _rifacimento_, declares himself unable  to pronounce which of the two poems is the better one, the original  Boiardo, or the re-modelled. It would therefore not very well become a  foreigner to give a verdict, even if he were able; and I confess, after  no little consideration (and apart, of course, from questions of dialect,  which I cannot pretend to look into), I feel myself almost entirely at a  loss to conjecture on which side the superiority lies, except in point  of invention and a certain early simplicity. The advantage in those two  respects unquestionably belongs to Boiardo; and a great one it is, and  may not unreasonably be supposed to settle the rest of the question in  his favour; and yet Berni's fancy, during a more sophisticate period of  Italian manners, exhibited itself so abundantly in his own witty poems,  his pen at all times has such a charming facility, and he proved himself,  in his version of Boiardo, to have so strong a sympathy with the  earnestness and sentiment of his original in his gravest moments, that I  cannot help thinking the two men would have been each what the other was  in their respective times;--the Lombard the comparative idler, given more  to witty than serious invention, under a corrupt Roman court; and the  Tuscan the originator of romantic fictions, in a court more suited to him  than the one he avowedly despised. I look upon them as two men singularly  well matched. The nature of the present work does not require, and the  limits to which it is confined do not permit, me to indulge myself in a  comparison between them corroborated by proofs; but it is impossible not  to notice the connexion: and therefore, begging the reader's pardon for  the sorry substitute of affirmative for demonstrative criticism, I may be  allowed to say, that if Boiardo has the praise of invention to himself,  Berni thoroughly appreciated and even enriched it; that if Boiardo has  sometimes a more thoroughly charming simplicity, Berni still appreciates  it so well, that the difference of their times is sufficient to restore  the claim of equality of feeling; and finally, that if Berni strengthens  and adorns the interest of the composition with more felicitous  expressions, and with a variety of lively and beautiful trains of  thought, you feel that Boiardo was quite capable of them all, and might  have done precisely the same had he lived in Berni's age. In the greater  part of the poem the original is altered in nothing except diction,  and often (so at least it seems to me) for no other reason than the  requirements of the Tuscan manner. And this is the case with most of the  noblest, and even the liveliest passages. My first acquaintance, for  example, with the _Orlando Innamorato_ was through the medium of Berni;  and on turning to those stories in his version, which I have translated  from his original for the present volume, I found that every passage but  one, to which I had given a mark of admiration, was the property of the  old poet. That single one, however, was in the exquisitest taste, full of  as deep a feeling as any thing in its company (I have noticed it in the  translated passage). And then, in the celebrated introductions to his  cantos, and the additions to Boiardo's passages of description and  character (those about Rodamonte, for example, so admired by Foscolo), if  Berni occasionally spews a comparative want of faith which you regret, he  does it with a regret on his own part, visible through all his jesting.  Lastly, the singular and indignant strength of his execution often makes  up for the trustingness that he was sorry to miss. If I were asked, in  short, which of the two poems I should prefer keeping, were I compelled  to choose, I should first complain of being forced upon so hard an  alternative, and then, with many a look after Berni, retain Boiardo. The  invention is his; the first earnest impulse; the unmisgivings joy; the  primitive morning breath, when the town-smoke has not polluted the  fields, and the birds are singing their \"wood-notes wild.\" Besides, after  all, one cannot be _sure_ that Berni could have invented as Boiardo did.  If he could, he would probably have written some fine serious poem of his  own. And Panizzi has observed, with striking and conclusive truth, that  \"without Berni the _Orlando Innamorato_ will be read and enjoyed; without  Boiardo not even the name of the poem remains.\"[7]    Nevertheless this conclusion need not deprive us of either work. Berni  raised a fine polished edifice, copied and enlarged after that of  Boiardo;--on the other hand, the old house, thank Heaven, remains; and  our best way of settling the question between the two is, to be glad that  we have got both. Let the reader who is rich in such possessions look  upon Berni's as one of his town mansions, erected in the park-like  neighbourhood of some metropolis; and Boiardo's as the ancient country  original of it, embosomed in the woods afar off, and beautiful as the  Enchanted Castle of Claude--      \"Lone sitting by the shores of old romance.\"           *       *       *       *       *    [Footnote 1: The materials for the biography in this notice have been  gathered from Tiraboschi and others, but more immediately from the  copious critical memoir from the pen of Mr. Panizzi, in that gentleman's  admirable edition of the combined poems of Boiardo and Ariosto, in nine  volumes octavo, published by Mr. Pickering.
