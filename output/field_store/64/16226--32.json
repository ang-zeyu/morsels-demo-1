CHOCOLATE GLACE CAKE    Beat to a cream a generous half cupful of butter, and gradually beat  into this one cupful of sugar. Add one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s  Premium No. 1 Chocolate, melted; also two unbeaten eggs. Beat vigorously  for five minutes; then stir in half a cupful of milk, and lastly, one  cupful and a half of flour, with which has been mixed one generous  teaspoonful of baking powder. Flavor with one teaspoonful of vanilla.  Pour into a buttered, shallow cake pan, and bake for half an hour in a  moderate oven. When cool, spread with glace frosting.    GLACE FROSTING. Put half a cupful of sugar and three tablespoonfuls of  water in a small saucepan. Stir over the fire until the sugar is nearly  melted. Take the spoon from the pan before the sugar really begins to  boil, because it would spoil the icing if the syrup were stirred after  it begins to boil. After boiling gently for four minutes, add half a  teaspoonful of vanilla extract, but do not stir; then set away to cool.  When the syrup is about blood warm, beat it with a wooden spoon until  thick and white. Now put the saucepan in another with boiling water, and  stir until the icing is thin enough to pour. Spread quickly on the cake.      CHOCOLATE GLACE    After making a glace frosting, dissolve one ounce of Walter Baker &  Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate in a cup, and put it with the frosting,  adding also a tablespoonful of boiling water.      CHOCOLATE BISCUIT    Cover three large baking pans with paper that has been well oiled with  washed butter. Over these dredge powdered sugar. Melt in a cup one ounce  of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate. Separate the whites and  yolks of four eggs. Add to the yolks a generous half cupful of powdered  sugar, and beat until light and firm. Add the melted chocolate, and beat  a few minutes longer. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff, dry froth.  Measure out three-fourths of a cupful of sifted flour, and stir it and  the whites into the yolks. The whites and flour must be cut in as  lightly as possible, and with very little stirring. Drop the mixture in  teaspoonfuls on the buttered paper. Sprinkle powdered sugar over the  cakes, and bake in a slow oven for about fourteen or fifteen minutes.  The mixture can be shaped like lady fingers, if preferred.      CHOCOLATE WAFERS    Grate four ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, and  mix with it two tablespoonfuls of flour and one-fourth of a teaspoonful  each of cinnamon, cloves and baking powder. Separate six eggs. Add one  cupful of powdered sugar to the yolks, and beat until very light; then  add the grated yellow rind and the juice of half a lemon, and beat five  minutes longer. Now add the dry mixture, and with a spoon lightly cut in  the whites, which are first to be beaten to a stiff froth. Pour the  mixture into buttered shallow pans, having it about half an inch thick.  Bake in a moderate oven for half an hour. When the cake is cool, spread  a thin layer of currant jelly over one sheet, and place the other sheet  on this. Ice with vanilla icing; and when this hardens, cut in squares.  It is particularly nice to serve with ice-cream.      CINDERELLA CAKES    Use two eggs, one cupful of sugar, one cupful and a quarter of flour,  one gill of cold water, one tablespoonful of lemon juice, one  teaspoonful of baking powder, one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium  No. 1 Chocolate, half a tumbler of any kind of jelly, and chocolate  icing the same as for eclairs.    Separate the eggs, and beat the yolks and sugar together until light.  Beat the whites until light, and then beat them with yolks and sugar and  grated chocolate. Next beat in the lemon juice and water, and finally  the flour, in which the baking powder should be mixed. Beat for three  minutes, and then pour the batter into two pans, and bake in a moderate  oven for about eighteen minutes. When done, spread one sheet of cake  with the jelly, and press the other sheet over it; and when cold, cut  into little squares and triangular pieces. Stick a wooden toothpick into  each of these pieces and dip each one into the hot icing, afterwards  removing the toothpick, of course.      CHOCOLATE ECLAIRS    Into a granite-ware saucepan put half a pint of milk, two well-rounded  tablespoonfuls of butter, and one tablespoonful of sugar, and place on  the stove. When this boils up, add half a pint of sifted flour, and cook  for two minutes, beating well with a wooden spoon. It will be smooth and  velvety at the end of that time. Set away to cool; and when cool, beat  in four eggs, one at a time. Beat vigorously for about fifteen minutes.  Try a small bit of the paste in the oven; and if it rises in the form of  a hollow ball, the paste is beaten enough; whereas, if it does not, beat  a little longer. Have tin sheets or shallow pans slightly buttered. Have  ready, also, a tapering tin tube, with the smaller opening about  three-quarters of an inch in diameter. Place this in the small end of a  conical cotton pastry bag. Put the mixture in the bag, and press out on  buttered pans, having each eclair nearly three inches long. There should  be eighteen, and they must be at least two inches apart, as they swell  in cooking. Bake in a moderately hot oven for about twenty-five minutes.  Take from the oven, and while they are still warm coat them with  chocolate. When cold, cut open on the side, and fill with either of the  following described preparations:--    FILLING NO. 1.--Mix in a bowl half a pint of rich cream, one teaspoonful  of vanilla, and four tablespoonfuls of sugar. Place the bowl in a pan of  ice-water, and beat the cream until light and firm, using either an  egg-beater or a whisk.    FILLING NO. 2.--Put half a pint of milk into a double-boiler, and place  on the fire. Beat together until very light one level tablespoonful of  flour, half a cupful of sugar, and one egg. When the milk boils, stir in  this mixture. Add one-eighth of a teaspoonful of salt, and cook for  fifteen minutes, stirring often. When cold, flavor with one teaspoonful  of vanilla.    ICING FOR ECLAIRS.--Put in a small granite-ware pan half a pint of sugar  and five tablespoonfuls of cold water. Stir until the sugar is  partially melted, and then place on the stove, stirring for half a  minute. Take out the spoon, and watch the sugar closely. As soon as it  boils, take instantly from the fire and pour upon a meat-platter. Let  this stand for eight minutes. Meantime, shave into a cup one ounce of  Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, and put it on the fire in  a pan of boiling water. At the end of eight minutes stir the sugar with  a wooden spoon until it begins to grow white and to thicken. Add the  melted chocolate quickly, and continue stirring until the mixture is  thick. Put it in a small saucepan, and place on the fire in another pan  of hot water. Stir until so soft that it will pour freely. Stick a  skewer into the side of an eclair, and dip the top in the hot chocolate.  Place on a plate, and continue until all the eclairs are \"glaced.\" They  will dry quickly. Do not stir the sugar after the first half minute, and  do not scrape the sugar from the saucepan into the platter. All the  directions must be strictly followed.      CHOCOLATE COOKIES    Beat to a cream half a cupful of butter and one tablespoonful of lard.  Gradually beat into this one cupful of sugar; then add one-fourth of a  teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of cinnamon, and two ounces of  Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, melted. Now add one  well-beaten egg, and half a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in two  tablespoonfuls of milk. Stir in about two cupfuls and a half of flour.  Roll thin, and, cutting in round cakes, bake in a rather quick oven. The  secret of making good cookies is the use of as little flour as will  suffice.      CHOCOLATE GINGERBREAD    Mix in a large bowl one cupful of molasses, half a cupful of sour milk  or cream, one teaspoonful of ginger, one of cinnamon, half a teaspoonful  of salt. Dissolve one teaspoonful of soda in a teaspoonful of cold  water; add this and two tablespoonfuls of melted butter to the mixture.  Now stir in two cupfuls of sifted flour, and finally add two ounces of  Walter Baker & Co.'s Chocolate and one tablespoonful of butter, melted  together. Pour the mixture into three well-buttered, deep tin plates,  and bake in a moderately hot oven for about twenty minutes.      VANILLA ICING    Break the white of one large egg into a bowl, and gradually beat into it  one cupful of confectioners' sugar. Beat for three minutes, add half a  teaspoonful of vanilla extract, and spread thinly on the cakes.      CHOCOLATE ICING    Make a vanilla icing, and add one tablespoonful of cold water to it.  Scrape fine one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate,  and put it in a small iron or granite-ware saucepan, with two  tablespoonfuls of confectioners' sugar and one tablespoonful of hot  water. Stir over a hot fire until smooth and glossy, then add another  tablespoonful of hot water. Stir the dissolved chocolate into the  vanilla icing.      CHOCOLATE PROFITEROLES    Shave into a cup one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1  Chocolate, and put the cup into a pan of boiling water. Make a paste the  same as for eclairs, save that instead of one tablespoonful of sugar  three must be used.    As soon as the paste is cooked, beat in the melted chocolate. When cold,  add the eggs, and beat until light. Drop this batter on lightly buttered  pans in round cakes, having about a dessertspoonful in each cake. Bake  for about twenty minutes in a moderately hot oven. Serve either hot or  cold, with whipped cream prepared the same as for Filling No. 1 for  eclairs.

Our bodies seem to demand the amount of  <p 19>  food to which we have accustomed them. If  we should increase the amount ten or twenty  per cent, we might, for a while, feel some  discomfort from it, but soon our system  would begin to demand the greater quantity  and we could not again return to the lighter  diet without a period of discomfort. Likewise  the amount of food which most of us  consume could be reduced materially with no  permanent injury or reduction of energy or  danger to health. Following the reduction  would be a period of discomfort and probable  reduction of weight. This period would last  for but a relatively short time, after which we  would again strike a physiological equilibrium  such that an increase of food would not be  craved nor be of any benefit.    Any great increase in the amount of physical  or mental work results in a feeling of weariness  which is usually sufficient to cause us to return  to our habitual amount of expenditure of  energy. Our system is, however, wonderful  in its capacity to adjust itself to changed  demands which come upon it, whether these  <p 20>  demands be in the nature of changes in temperature,  in stimulants, in nourishment, or in  the expenditure of physical or mental energy.    There is, of course, a limit to possible human  achievements. There are resources which  may not be exhausted without serious injury  to health. Those who accomplish most, however,  compare favorably with others in length  of days and retention of health.    _While overwork has its place among the things  which reduce energy and shorten life, it is my  opinion that overwork is not so dangerous or so  common as is ordinarily supposed_.    In not a few industries, the dominant house  or firm has for its head a man past seventy  who still keeps a firm and vigorous grip on the  business: men like Richard T. Crane of  Chicago, E. C. Simmons of St. Louis, and  James J. Hill, whose careers are records of  intense industry and absorbed devotion to the  work in hand.    _Many persons confuse overwork with what is  really underwork accompanied with worry or  unhygienic practices_.  <p 21>    A recent writer on sociology calls attention  to the fact that nervous prostrations and  general breakdowns are most common among  those members of society who achieve the  least and who may be regarded as parasites.  Exercise both of brain and of muscle is necessary  for growth and for health.    Those nations which expend the most energy  are probably the ones among whom longevity  is greatest and the mortality rate the lowest.  In the city of Chicago there are many conditions  adverse to health of body and mind, yet  the city is famous for its relatively low mortality  as a parallel fact. It is also affirmed  that the average Chicago man works longer  hours and actually accomplishes more than  the average man elsewhere. This excess in the  expenditure of energy--in so far as it is  wisely spent--may be one of the reasons for  the excellent health record of the city.    In every walk of life we see that the race  is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong.  We all know men clearly of secondary ability  who nevertheless occupy high positions in  <p 22>  business and state. We are acquainted also  with men of excellent native endowment who  still have never risen above the ranks of mediocrity.    _Human efficiency is not measured in terms  of muscular energy nor of intellectual grasp. It  is dependent upon many factors other than native  strength of mind and body_.    The attitude which one takes toward life  in general and toward his calling in particular  is of more importance than native ability.  The man with concentration, or the power of  continued enthusiastic application, will surpass  a brilliant competitor if this latter is  careless and indifferent towards his work.  Many who have accomplished great things  in business, in the professions, and in science  have been men of moderate ability. For  testimony of this fact take this striking quotation  from Charles Darwin.    ``I have no great quickness of apprehension  or wit, which is so remarkable in some clever  men,'' he writes. ``I am a poor critic. . . .  My power to follow a long and purely abstract  <p 23>  train of thought is very limited; and therefore  I never could have succeeded with metaphysics  or mathematics. My memory is extensive,  yet hazy; it suffices to make me cautious by  vaguely telling me that I have observed or read  something opposed to the conclusion which I  am drawing, or on the other hand in favor  of it. So poor in one sense is my memory,  that I have never been able to remember for  more than a few days a single date or a line  of poetry. I have a fair share of invention,  and of common sense or judgment, such as  every fairly successful lawyer or doctor must  have, but not, I believe, in any higher degree.''    This is presumably an honest statement  of fact, and in addition it should be remembered  that Darwin was always physically  weak, that for forty years he was practically  an invalid and able to work for only about  three hours a day. In these few hours he  was able to accomplish more, however, than  other men of apparently superior ability who  were able to work long hours daily for many  <p 24>  years. Darwin made the most of his ability  and increased his efficiency to its maximum.    For a parallel in business, Cyrus H. McCormick  might be named. The inventor of the  reaper and builder of the first American business  which covered the world was not a man of  extraordinary intellect, wit, or judgment. He  had, however, the will and power to focus his  attention on a single question until the answer  was evolved. Again and again, his biographers  tell us, he pursued problems which  eluded him far into the night and he was  frequently found asleep at his desk the morning  following. When roused, instead of seeking  rest, he addressed his task again and  usually overcame his obstacle before leaving  it.    All these considerations point to one conclusion.  It is quite certain, then, that most of  us are whiling away our days and occupying positions  far below our possibilities. A corollary  to this statement is Mr. Taylor's conclusion that  ``few of our best-organized industries have attained  the maximum output of first-class men.''  <p 25>    _Not to give too wide application to his discovery  that the average day's work is only half  or less than half what a first-class man can do,  it is more than probable that the average man  could, with no injury to his health, increase his  efficiency fifty per cent_.    We are making use of only part of our existing  mental and physical powers and are not  taxing them beyond their strength. Increased  accomplishments, and heightened efficiency  would cultivate and develop them, would  waken the latent powers and tap hidden  stores of energy within us, would widen the  fields in which we labor and would open up  to us new and wider horizons of honorable  and profitable activity.    In succeeding chapters will be described  specific methods, many of which are employed  by individual firms, but which could be utilized  by other business men, to insure their own efficiency  and that of their employees. The experiences  of many successful houses will be linked  to the laws of psychology to point the way that  will bring about greater results from men.        CHAPTER II    IMITATION    AS A MEANS OF INCREASING HUMAN  EFFICIENCY    TWENTY years ago the head of an industry  now in the million-a-month  class sat listening to his ``star'' salesman.  The latter, in the first enthusiasm of  discovery and creation, was telling how he had  developed the company's haphazard selling  talk and had taken order after order with a  standard approach, demonstration, and summary  of closing arguments. To prove the  effectiveness of ``the one best way,'' he challenged  his employer to act as a customer,  staged the little drama he had arranged, secured  admissions of savings his machine would  make, ultimately cornered the other, and sold  him.    ``That's great,'' the owner declared the in-  <p 26>  <p 27>  stant he had surrendered to the salesman's  logic. ``If we can get all our agents to learn  and use this new method of yours, we'll double  our business in three years.''    Then followed discussion of the means by  which the knowledge could be spread.    ``I've got it,'' the manager announced at  last. ``I'll telegraph five or six men to come  in''--he named the agents within a night's  ride of the factory--``and you can show  them how you sold fifteen machines last week.    ``We could take down your talk in shorthand  and send it to them, but that wouldn't  do the business. I want them to watch you  sell, to study how you make your points, how  you introduce yourself, how you get your  man's attention, how you bring out his  objections and meet them, how you lead up  to the signing minute, and show him where  to sign. _*What you say_ is about half the trick:  _*how you say it_ is the convincing part--the  thing the slowest man in the force by watching  you can learn more quickly than the smartest  could work out at home.''  <p 28>    The result of that conference was one of  the earliest organized training schools for  salesmen in the country. It was an unconscious,  but none the less certain, utilization  of the instinct of _*imitation_ for increasing the  efficiency in employees. Since then, business  has borrowed many well-recognized principles  from psychology and pedagogy and adapted  them to the same end.    Many important houses have grafted the  school upon their organizations and _*teach_  not only raw and untrained employees, but  provide instruction calculated to make workmen  and clerks masters of their jobs and also  to fit them for advancement to higher and  more productive planes. Teaching is by example  rather than by precept,"]]]
