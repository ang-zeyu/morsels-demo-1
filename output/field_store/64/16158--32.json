They did not Mocha and Java worth a Cent.    The Cardboard Motto in the Dining Room said, \"Love One Another,\" but  they were too Busy to Read.    He had a Clearing on the top of his Head and wore Side-Whiskers and bore  a general Resemblance to the Before in an Ad for a Facial Treatment, and  yet she suspected that all the Women in Town were Crazy to steal him  away from her.    Likewise, inasmuch as she was the same Width all the way up and down,  the same as a Poster Girl, and used to sport a Velvet Shroud with Black  Beads on it, and could wield a Tooth-Pick and carry on a Conversation at  the same time, he knew that sooner or later some Handsome Wretch with  Money would try to Abduct her.    Sometimes he would bring a Friend Home to Dinner, and then if the Friend  extended himself and told the Missus how well she was looking or  Perjured himself over her Hand-Painting, Papa would get a Grouch and  hide in the Corner.    [Illustration: BABY]    Then she would Fan herself rapidly and ask, \"Aren't you well, Dear?\"    Dear would force one of those Dying-Martyr Smiles and reply, \"I am quite  well, Puss.\"    Then Puss would tell the Visitor that Baby was simply ruining his Health  through Devotion to his Employers, but they didn't seem to Appreciate  him at all.    After the Visitor went away there would be Language all over the Shop,  and the poor Hired Girl would lock the Door and write to the  Intelligence Office for a new Place.    Truly, it was a Happy Little Home, with the Reverse English.    She would Frisk his Wardrobe every day or two, looking for Evidence, and  he would compel her to Itemize her Accounts so that he might be sure she  was not giving Jewelry to the Iceman.    She would find a certain Passage in a Book, relating to Man's Cruelty  and Woman's Silent Suffering, and then she would Mark the Passage and  put it where he could Find it. Then when he Found it, he would Mark it  \"Rot!\" and put it where She could find it, and then she would Weep and  write Letters to Lady Authors telling them how Sad and Lonely she was.    But all the Time they kept up an Affectionate Front before their  Acquaintances. They thought it better to avoid Scenes in Public; and  although each knew that the other was False and had ceased to Love, they  could not bring themselves to think of a Separation or a Divorce on  account of the Cat--their Cat! The Cat must never know.    However, one of his Business Associates was On. He was a Bachelor and  had lived at a European Hotel for Years, and he knew just how to  Arbitrate a Domestic Scrap. So he sat down one day and gave the Husband  a Good Talking-To. He said it was a Shame that such Nice People should  have their Differences when it was so easy to be Happy. With that he  handed over a Slew of Platitudes and Proverbs, such as: \"A Soft Answer  Turneth Away Wrath,\" \"It takes Two to Make a Quarrel,\" \"Think Twice  before you Speak once,\" _et cetera._    [Illustration: SWEETIE]    The Gist of his heart-to-heart Talk was that any Husband could stop  Rough House Proceedings and shoot all kinds of Sweetness and Light into  the sassiest Mooch a Wife ever got on to herself, if only he would  refuse to Quarrel with her, receive her Flings without a Show of Wrath,  and get up every Morning ready to Plug for a Renaissance of their Early  Love.    Oh, but it was a Beauty Bright System! The European Hotel Bachelor said  it couldn't Lose.    The Husband decided to give it a Trial. That very Afternoon he met his  Wife, who had come out in her long Fawn-Colored Coat that fell straight  in the Back. She had her Upper Rigging set, and was trying to Blanket  everything on the Street. He flashed a Smiling Countenance, and said he  was glad to see her. Then, instead of asking her When she left the  House, and Where she had been since then, and How Soon she expected to  go Home again, he told her she was looking Unusually Charming. She was  Startled.    [Illustration: THE CAT]    He handed her a Ten and told her to have a Good Time. Now, usually, when  she wanted any Pin Money, she had to Pry it out of him.    On her way home her Mind was in a Tumult. Why had he given her the Con  Speech and all that Money? What was the Ulterior Motive? What had he  been Doing that he should attempt to Coddle her into a Forgiving Mood?  Did he Fear that she would get next to his Past? Huh?    He just couldn't Fool her. She knew Something was Doing. Else why should  he try to Fix her?    As soon as he came Home that Evening she Accused him and said she knew  All. Instead of Countering with the usual Gibe, he told her that she was  the Only Woman he had ever Loved and would she go to a Show that  Evening? She went, thinking that perhaps the Other Woman might be there  and she could detect some Signal passing between them. While at the  Theater he fanned her and explained the Plot, and was all Attention.  They rode Home in a Cab, because he said a Car wasn't good enough for  His Queen. After they were at Home he asked her to sing the Song he had  liked so much in the Old Days, \"My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean.\" This was  Conclusive Proof to her that the Hussy's Name was Bonnie.    Next Morning before he started away he Kissed her, and it wasn't any  Make-Believe such as you see in Comic Opera. It was a genuine Olga  Nethersole Buss, full of Linger and Adhesion. To cap the Climax he said  he would stop in and order some Violets.    As soon as the Door slammed she Staggered toward the Kitchen, holding on  to the Furniture here and there, the same as a Sardou Heroine. In the  Kitchen was a Box of Rough on Rats. Hastily Concealing it beneath the  loose Folds of her Morning Gown, she went to her Room and looked in the  Mirror.    Ah, when he saw that Cold, White Face, then he would be Sorry. Upon  Second Thought, this didn't seem to be a Moral Certainty, so she  Weakened and had the Girl take the Poison and Hide it. She said she  would Live--Live to Forget his Perfidy.    That day she went back to Mamma, and took the Cat with her.    When he came Home in the Twilight he found no Wife, no Cat--only a  Scribbled Note saying that he could no longer Deceive her; that she had  seen through his Diabolical Plan to Lull her Suspicions, and that she  was no longer Safe in the Same House.    When the Deserted Husband went to the Friend and told him what had  Happened, the Wise Bachelor said:    \"I see. You did not go at her Strong enough.\"    MORAL: _They don't know Anything about it_.          _THE_ FABLE _OF THE_ EX-CHATTEL _AND THE_ AWFUL SWAT _THAT_ WAS WAITING  _FOR THE COLONEL_      In one of the States of the Sunny South there stood a war-time House  that had six white Columns along the Veranda, and the Chimney ran up the  outside of the Wall.    This House was the Abode of a Colonel who had a silver-gray Goatee and  the Manners of the Old School. All the First Families in the State were  related to him, and therefore he was somewhat Particular as to who Lined  Up with him when he took his Toddy.    He was proud of his Ancestry, and he carried the Scars to prove that he  would Resent an Insult.    Now it happened that the Thirteenth Amendment signified nothing to him.  He had been Reconstructed, but it didn't Take.    While on a Business Trip to the North he stopped at a Gaudy Hotel with  all kinds of Mirrors and Onyx Stairways.    The Head Waiter at this Hotel was a Colored Gentleman with a False Front  and a Dress Suit that fit him too soon. His Name was Mr. Winfield. He  was President of the Colored Waiters' Union, Vice-President of the  Republican County Central Committee, and Regal Commander of the Princes  of Ethiopia.    His Honors lay Heavily upon him. He showed People where to sit in the  Dining Room, and those who failed to Obey usually had to wait fifteen or  twenty Minutes for their Vermicelli.    [Illustration: THE COLONEL]    Mr. Winfield favored his Feet somewhat, which caused him to walk  Syncopated, but, everything considered, he was quite Important and  fairly Warm.    One morning the Colonel went into the Dining Room, and after he had  seated himself he called Mr. Winfield to him and said he wanted some Hot  Biscuit. At the same time he addressed Mr. Winfield as a Black Hound.  Mr. Winfield did not know that this was a Term of Endearment in  Apahatchie County, so he picked up a Silver Fruit Dish and bounced it  against the Colonel's Head.    The Colonel arose and pulled his Persuader, expecting to make it a Case  of Justifiable Homicide, but two Waiters named George and Grant grabbed  him and backed him up against the Wall.    There were other guests in the Dining Room, but they did not jump in  with any Gun Plays and make it a Race War, because Apahatchie County was  Eight Hundred Miles away. One of them Co-Operated to the extent of  Ringing three times for a Policeman.    The Officer of the Law who arrived in a few Minutes was Mr. Otis  Beasley, Most Worshipful Scribe of the Princes of Ethiopia, of which Mr.  Winfield was the Regal Commander.    Mr. Beasley walked up to Mr. Winfield, and placing his Left Hand on his  Brow, said, \"Hail, Brother.\"    \"Hail, Most Noble Prince!\" responded Mr. Winfield, making the Mystic  Sign.    \"What are the Objects of our Beloved Fraternity?\" asked Mr. Beasley, in  a whisper.    \"Hope, Coslosterousness, and Polotomy,\" replied the Regal Commander.    \"'Tis Well,\" said the Most Worshipful Scribe, giving him the Grip.    Having completed the Secret work, Mr. Beasley wanted to know what he  could do for Brother Winfield.    \"Remove this Pusson,\" said Mr. Winfield, pointing at the Colonel.    So it came about that He who in Apahatchie County had trained them to  hop off the Sidewalk and stand Uncovered until he had passed, now  suffered the Hideous Degradation of being marched downstairs by One of  Them and then slammed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11938"],[0,"Folklore of the Santal Parganas (#3)"],[1,"e.\" So the  next day Anuwa pretended to be dead and his mother went about crying;  she took her way to the jungle and there she met the jackal and she  told him that Anuwa had died in consequence of his curse and she  invited him to the funeral feast, saying that he used to eat the  rice which she had cooked and he had become like a son to her. The  jackal gladly promised to attend, and he collected a number of his  friends and at evening they went to Anuwa's house and sat down in  the courtyard. Then the old woman came out and began to bewail her  son: but the jackal said \"Stop crying, grannie, you cannot get back  the dead: let us get on to the feast.\" So she said that she would  fry some cakes first, as it would take some time before the rice was  ready. The jackals approved of this but they asked her to tie them up  with a rope first lest they should get to fighting over the food, so  the old woman brought a thick rope and tied them all up and tightest  of all she tied up the jackal which had cursed Anuwa; then she went  inside and put an iron pan on the fire and from time to time she  sprinkled water on it and when the jackals heard the water hissing  they thought that it was the cakes frying and jumped about with  joy. Suddenly Anuwa came out with a thick stick and set to beating  the jackals till they bit through the ropes and ran away howling;  but the first jackal was tied so tightly that he could not escape,  and Anuwa beat him till he was senseless and lay without moving all  night. The next morning Anuwa took the jackal and tied him to a stake  near the place where the village women drew water and he put a thick  stick beside it and every woman who went for water would give the  jackal one blow with the stick. After a few days beating the body  of the jackal became all swollen and one night some other jackals  came there and asked him what he ate that he had got so fat and he  said that every one who came to draw water gave him a handful of rice  and that was why he was so fat; and if they did not believe him they  could take his place and try for themselves.    So one jackal agreed to try and untied the first jackal and let himself  be tied in his place, but in the morning five women came down and  each gave him a blow with the stick till he jumped about for pain,  and seeing him jumping other women came and beat him till he died.          III. Ledha and the Leopard.    Once upon a time a boy named Ledha was tending cattle with other  boys at the foot of a hill, and these boys in fun used to call out  \"Ho, leopard: Ho, leopard,\" and the echo used to answer from the hill  \"Ho, leopard.\" Now there really was a leopard who lived in the hill  and one day he was playing hide and seek with a lizard which also  lived there. The lizard hid and the leopard looked every where for  it in vain. At last the leopard sat down to rest and it chanced that  he sat right on top of the lizard which was hiding in a hole. The  lizard thought that the leopard meant to hurt it and in revenge bit  him and fastened on to his rump so that he could not get it off,  so that day when the boys came calling out \"Ho, leopard,\" he ran  towards them to get their help: but when they saw the leopard they  all fled for their lives. Ledha however could not run fast because  he was lame, and the leopard headed him off and begged him to remove  the lizard. This he did after the leopard had sworn not to eat him,  and before they parted the leopard made him promise to tell no one  that the lizard had bitten him, and said that if he told then he would  be carried off and eaten. So Ledha rejoined his companions and told  them nothing of what had passed between him and the leopard. But that  night when they had all gone to bed, Ledha's sister-in-law began to  worry him to tell her what the leopard had said to him, when it had  caught him. He told her that the leopard would eat him if he told,  but she coaxed him and said that no one could hear them inside the  house; so at last he told her that he had taken off a lizard which  was hanging on to its rump. Then they went to sleep; but the leopard  was hiding at the back of the house and heard all that they said;  and when they were all asleep, he crept in and carried off Ledha's bed  with Ledha in it on his head. When Ledha woke up towards morning, he  found himself being carried through dense jungle and he quietly pulled  himself up into one of the trees which overhung the path. Thus when  the leopard put down the bed and was going to eat Ledha, he found it  empty. So he went back on his track and by and bye came to the tree  in which Ledha was hiding. The leopard begged Ledha to come down,  as he had something to say to him, and promised not to eat him; but  directly Ledha reached the ground the leopard said \"Now I am going to  eat you.\" Ledha was powerless, so he only asked to be allowed to have  one chew of tobacco before he died; the leopard assented and Ledha  felt in his cloth for his tobacco, but the tobacco did not come out  easily and as Ledha felt about for it the dry tobacco leaves crackled;  the leopard asked what the crackling sound was, and Ledha said \"That  is the lizard which bit you yesterday;\" then the leopard got into a  terrible fright and ran away as hard as he could, calling out \"Don't  let it loose: Don't let it loose.\"    So Ledha was saved from the leopard, but he did not know his way out  of the jungle. He wandered about, till he came to the place where the  wild buffaloes used to sleep at night, and he swept up the place and  made it clean and then took refuge in a hollow tree; he stayed there  some days, sweeping up the place daily and supporting himself on the  fruit of a fig-tree. At last one day the buffaloes left one cow behind  to watch and see who it was who swept up their sleeping place. The cow  pretended to be too ill to rise, and Ledha after watching for some  time came out and swept the ground as usual, and then tried to pull  the sick cow up by the tail; but she would not move so he went back to  his hollow tree. When the buffaloes returned they heard that it was a  kindhearted man who cleaned their sleeping place; so they called Ledha  out and said that they would keep him as their servant to clean their  sleeping place and to scrub them when they bathed in the river; they  made him taste the milk of all the cows and appointed the cow whose  milk he liked best to supply him. Thenceforward he used to wander  about with the buffaloes and he made a flute and used to play on it.    One day after scrubbing the buffaloes he washed his head in the river  and some of his hairs came out; so he wrapped them up in a leaf and  set the packet to float down the stream. Lower down the stream two  princesses were bathing with their attendants, and when they saw  the packet they tried who could fish it out and it was the younger  princess who caught it. Then they measured the hairs and found them  twelve cubits long. The princess who had taken the packet from the  water went home and took to her bed and said that she would not  eat until the man was found to whom the hairs belonged. Her father,  the Raja, sent messengers in all directions to search for the man  but they could not find him. Then he sent a parrot and the parrot  flew up high and looking down saw Ledha with the buffaloes in the  forest; but it did not dare to go near, so the parrot returned and  told the Raja that the man was in the forest but that no messenger  could approach for fear of the wild buffaloes. However a crow said,  \"I can bring him if any one can,\" so they sent the crow and it went  and perched on the backs of the buffaloes and began to peck them;  then Ledha threw stones at it, but it would not go away; then he threw  a stick at it and last of all he threw his flute. The crow caught up  the flute and flew up to a tree with it. Ledha ran after it, but the  crow kept flying on a short distance and Ledha still pursued until he  came to the Raja's city. The crow flew on till it entered the room  where the princess lay, and dropped the flute into the hands of the  princess. Ledha followed right into the room and they shut him in  and the princess gave him his flute after he had promised to marry her.    So he stayed there a long time, but meanwhile the buffaloes all got  weak and ill for want of some one to look after them. One day Ledha  set off to the jungle with his wife to see them and when he saw how  ill the buffaloes were, he decided to build a house in the jungle  and live there. And the Raja sent them money and horses and cattle  and elephants and servants and they built a palace and Ledha subdued  all the jungle and became a great Raja; and he made a highway to his  father-in-law's home and used to go to and fro on it.            IV. The Cruel Stepmother.    There was once a Raja whose wife died leaving him with one young  child. He reared it with great care and when it could toddle about  it took a great fancy to a cat; the child was always playing with it  and carrying it about.    All his friends begged the Raja to marry again, but he said that he  was sure that a stepmother would be cruel to his child; at last they  persuaded him to promise to marry again, if a bride could be found  who would promise to care for the child as her own, so his friends  looked out for a bride; but though they found plenty of girls who  were anxious to marry the Raja, not one would promise to care for  his child as her own. There was a young widow in a certain village  who heard of what was going on, and one day she asked whether a  bride had been found for the Raja and she was told that no one was  willing to take charge of the child. \"Why don't they agree,\" said she,  \"I would agree fast enough. If I were Rani I should have nothing to  do but look after the child and I would care for it more than its own  mother could.\" This came to the ears of the Raja and he sent for the  widow and was pleased"]]]
