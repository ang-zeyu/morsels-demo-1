They were busily engaged in separating  the fastenings of the horses, when the trooper on the piazza discharged  his pistols, and rushed, sword in hand, to the rescue.    The entrance of Caesar into the parlor had induced the wary dragoon  within to turn his attention more closely on his prisoner; but this new  interruption drew him again to the window. He threw his body out of the  building, and with dreadful imprecations endeavored, by his threats and  appearance, to frighten the marauders from their prey. The moment was  enticing. Three hundred of his comrades were within a mile of the  cottage; unridden horses were running at large in every direction, and  Henry Wharton seized the unconscious sentinel by his legs, and threw him  headlong into the lawn. Caesar vanished from the room, and drew a bolt  of the outer door.    The fall of the soldier was not great, and recovering his feet, he  turned his fury for a moment on his prisoner. To scale the window in the  face of such an enemy, was, however, impossible, and on trial he found  the main entrance barred.    His comrade now called loudly upon him for aid, and forgetful of  everything else, the discomfited trooper rushed to his assistance. One  horse was instantly liberated, but the other was already fastened to the  saddle of a Cowboy, and the four retired behind the building, cutting  furiously at each other with their sabers, and making the air resound  with their imprecations. Caesar threw the outer door open, and pointing  to the remaining horse, that was quietly biting the faded herbage of the  lawn, he exclaimed,--    \"Run--now--run--Massa Harry, run.\"    \"Yes,\" cried the youth as he vaulted into the saddle, \"now, indeed, my  honest fellow, is the time to run.\" He beckoned hastily to his father,  who stood at the window in speechless anxiety, with his hands extended  towards his child in the attitude of benediction, and adding, \"God bless  you, Caesar, salute the girls,\" he dashed through the gate with the  rapidity of lightning.    The African watched him with anxiety as he gained the highway, saw him  incline to the right, and riding furiously under the brow of some rocks,  which on that side rose perpendicularly, disappear behind a projection,  which soon hid him from view.    The delighted Caesar closed the door, pushing bolt after bolt, and  turning the key until it would turn no more, soliloquizing the whole  time on the happy escape of his young master.    \"How well he ride--teach him good deal myself--salute a young  lady--Miss Fanny wouldn't let old colored man kiss a red cheek.\"    When the fortune of the day was decided, and the time arrived for the  burial of the dead, two Cowboys and a Virginian were found in the rear  of the Locusts, to be included in the number.    Happily for Henry Wharton, the searching eyes of his captors were  examining, through a pocket glass, the column of infantry that still  held its position on the bank of the stream, while the remnants of the  Hessian yagers were seeking its friendly protection. His horse was of  the best blood of Virginia, and carried him with the swiftness of the  wind along the Valley; and the heart of the youth was already beating  tumultuously with pleasure at his deliverance, when a well-known voice  reached his startled ear, crying aloud,--    \"Bravely done, captain! Don't spare the whip, and turn to your left  before you cross the brook.\"    Wharton turned his head in surprise, and saw, sitting on the point of a  jutting rock that commanded a bird's-eye view of the valley, his former  guide, Harvey Birch. His pack, much diminished in size, lay at the feet  of the peddler, who waved his hat to the youth, exultingly, as the  latter flew by him. The English captain took the advice of this  mysterious being, and finding a good road, which led to the highway,  that intersected the valley, turned down its direction, and was soon  opposite to his friends. The next minute he crossed the bridge, and  stopped his charger before his old acquaintance, Colonel Wellmere.    \"Captain Wharton!\" exclaimed the astonished commander of the English  troops, \"dressed in mohair, and mounted on a rebel dragoon horse! Are  you from the clouds in this attire, and in such a style?\"    \"Thank God!\" cried the youth, recovering his breath, \"I am safe, and  have escaped from the hands of my enemies; but five minutes since and I  was a prisoner, and threatened with the gallows.\"    \"The gallows, Captain Wharton! surely those traitors to the king would  never dare to commit another murder in cold blood; is it not enough that  they took the life of Andre? Wherefore did they threaten you with a  similar fate?\"    \"Under the pretense of a similar offense,\" said the captain, briefly  explaining to the group of listeners the manner of his capture, the  grounds of his personal apprehensions, and the method of his escape. By  the time he had concluded his narration, the fugitive Germans were  collected in the rear of the column of infantry, and Colonel Wellmere  cried aloud,--    \"From my soul I congratulate you, my brave friend; mercy is a quality  with which these traitors are unacquainted, and you are doubly fortunate  in escaping from their hands uninjured. Prepare yourself to grant me  your assistance and I will soon afford you a noble revenge.\"    \"I do not think there was danger of personal outrage to any man, Colonel  Wellmere, from a party that Major Dunwoodie commands,\" returned young  Wharton, with a slight glow on his face. \"His character is above the  imputation of such an offense; neither do I think it altogether prudent  to cross this brook into the open plain, in the face of those Virginian  horse, flushed as they must be with the success they have just  obtained.\"    \"Do you call the rout of those irregulars and these sluggish Hessians a  deed to boast of?\" said the other with a contemptuous smile. \"You speak  of the affair, Captain Wharton, as if your boasted Mr. Dunwoodie, for  major he is none, had discomfited the bodyguards of your king.\"    \"And I must be allowed to say, Colonel Wellmere, that if the bodyguards  of my king were in yon field, they would meet a foe that it would be  dangerous to despise. Sir, my boasted Mr. Dunwoodie is the pride of  Washington's army as a cavalry officer,\" cried Henry with warmth.    \"Dunwoodie, Dunwoodie!\" repeated the colonel slowly, \"surely I have met  the gentleman before.\"    \"I have been told you once saw him for a moment, at the town residence  of my sisters,\" replied Wharton, with a lurking smile.    \"Ah! I do remember me of such a youth; and does the most potent congress  of these rebellious colonies intrust their soldiers to the leading of  such a warrior!\"    \"Ask the commander of yon Hessian horse, whether he thinks Major  Dunwoodie worthy of the confidence.\"    Colonel Wellmere was far from wanting that kind of pride which makes a  man bear himself bravely in the presence of his enemies. He had served  in America a long time, without ever meeting with any but new raised  levies, or the militia of the country. These would sometimes fight, and  that fearlessly, but they as often chose to run away without pulling a  trigger. He was too apt to judge from externals, and thought it  impossible for men whose gaiters were so clean, whose tread so regular,  and who wheeled with so much accuracy, to be beaten. In addition to all  these, they were Englishmen, and their success was certain. Colonel  Wellmere had never been kept much in the field, or these notions, which  he had brought with him from home, and which had been greatly increased  by the vaporing of a garrisoned town, would have long since vanished. He  listened to the warm reply of Captain Wharton with a supercilious smile,  and then inquired,--    \"You would not have us retire, sir, before these boasted horsemen,  without doing something that may deprive them of part of the glory which  you appear to think they have gained!\"    \"I would have you advised, Colonel Wellmere, of the danger you are about  to encounter.\"    \"Danger is but an unseemly word for a soldier,\" continued the British  commander with a sneer.    \"And one as little dreaded by the 60th, as any corps who wear the royal  livery,\" cried Henry Wharton, fiercely. \"Give but the word to charge,  and let our actions speak.\"    \"Now again I know my young friend,\" cried Wellmere, soothingly; \"but if  you have anything to say before we fight, that can in any manner help us  in our attack, we'll listen. You know the force of the rebels; are there  more of them in ambush?\"    \"Yes,\" replied the youth, chafing still under the other's sneers, \"in  the skirt of this wood on our right are a small party of foot; their  horse are all before you.\"    \"Where they will not continue long,\" cried Wellmere, turning to the few  officers around him. \"Gentlemen, we will cross the stream in column, and  deploy on the plain beyond, or else we shall not be able to entice these  valiant Yankees within the reach of our muskets. Captain Wharton, I  claim your assistance as an aid-de-camp.\"    The youth shook his head in disapprobation of a movement which his good  sense taught him was rash, but prepared with alacrity to perform his  duty in the impending trial.    During this conversation, which was held at a small distance in advance  of the British column, and in full view of the Americans, Dunwoodie had  been collecting his scattered troops, securing his few prisoners, and  retiring to the ground where he had been posted at the first appearance  of his enemy. Satisfied with the success he had already obtained, and  believing the English too wary to give him an opportunity of harassing  them further, he was about to withdraw the guides; and, leaving a strong  party on the ground to watch the movements of the regulars, to fall back  a few miles, to a favorable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9886"],[0,"The Book of Delight and Other Papers (#20)"],[1," address  the congregation, though he would do that rather in the school than in the  synagogue. Then a banquet would be spread for him. This banquet was called  one of the Seudoth Mitzvah, _i.e._ \"commandment meals,\" to which it was a  duty of all pious men to contribute their money and their own attendance.  It would be held in the communal hall, used mostly for marriage feasts.  When a wedding party came from afar, similar steps for general enjoyment  were taken. Men mounted on horseback went forth to welcome the bride, mimic  tournaments were fought _en route_, torch-light processions were made if it  were night time, processions by boats if it were in Italy or by the Rhine,  a band of communal musicians, retained at general cost, played merry  marches, and everyone danced and joined in the choruses. These musicians  often went from town to town, and the Jewish players were hired for Gentile  parties, just as Jews employed Christian or Arab musicians to help make  merry on the Jewish Sabbaths and festivals.    We need not wonder, then, that a traveller like Ibn Ezra was no croaker,  but a genial critic of life. He suffered, but he was light-hearted enough  to compose witty epigrams and improvise rollicking wine songs. He was an  accomplished chess player, and no doubt did something to spread the Eastern  game in Europe. Another service rendered by such travellers was the spread  of learning by their translations. Their wanderings made them great  linguists, and they were thus able to translate medical, astronomical, and  scientific works wherever they went. They were also sent by kings on  missions to collect new nautical instruments. Thus, the baculus, which  helped Columbus to discover America, was taken to Portugal by Jews, and a  French Jew was its inventor. They were much in demand as travelling  doctors, being summoned from afar to effect specific cures. But they also  carried other delights with them. Not only were they among the troubadours,  but they were also the most famous of the travelling _conteurs_. It was the  Jews, like Berechiah, Charizi, Zabara, Abraham ibn Chasdai, and other  incessant travellers, who helped to bring to Europe AEsop, Bidpai, the  Buddhist legends, who \"translated them from the Indian,\" and were partly  responsible for this rich poetical gift to the Western world.    Looking back on such a life, Ibn Ezra might well detect a Divine Providence  in his own pains and sorrows. So, Jew-like, he retained his hope to the  last, and after his buffetings on the troubled seas of life, remembering  the beneficent results of his travels to others, if not to himself, he  could write in this faithful strain:      My hope God knoweth well,    My life He made full sweet;    Whene'er His servant fell,    God raised him to his feet.    Within the garment of His grace,    My faults He did enfold,    Hiding my sin, His kindly face    My God did ne'er withhold.    Requiting with fresh good,    My black ingratitude.    There remain the great merchant travellers to be told about. They sailed  over all the world, and brought to Europe the wares, the products, the  luxuries of the East. They had their own peculiar dangers. Shipwreck was  the fate of others besides themselves, but they were peculiarly liable to  capture and sale as slaves. Foremost among their more normal hardships I  should place the bridge laws of the Middle Ages. The bridges were sometimes  practically maintained by the Jewish tolls. In England, before 1290, a Jew  paid a toll of a halfpenny on foot and a full penny on horseback--large  sums in those days. A \"dead Jew\" paid eightpence. Burial was for a long  time lawful only in London, and the total toll paid for bringing a dead Jew  to London over the various bridges must have been considerable. In the  Kurpfalz, for instance, the Jewish traveller had to pay the usual \"white  penny\" for every mile, but also a heavy general fee for the whole journey.  If he was found without his ticket of leave, he was at once arrested. But  it was when he came to a bridge that the exactions grew insufferable. The  regulations were somewhat tricky, for the Jew was specially taxed only on  Sundays and the Festivals of the Church. But every other day was some  Saint's Festival, and while, in Mannheim, even on those days the Christian  traveller paid one kreuzer if he crossed the bridge on foot, and two if on  horseback, the Jew was charged four kreuzer if on foot, twelve if on a  horse, and for every beast of burden he, unlike the Christian wayfarer,  paid a further toll of eight kreuzer. The Jewish quarter often lay near the  river, and Jews had great occasion for crossing the bridges, even for local  needs. In Venice, the Jewish quarter was naturally intersected by bridges;  in Rome there was the _pons Judeorum,_ which, no doubt, the Jews had to  maintain in repair. It must be remembered that many local Jewish  communities paid a regular bridge tax which was not exacted from  Christians, and when all this is considered, it will be seen that the  Jewish merchant needed to work hard and go far afield, if he was to get any  profit from his enterprises.    Nevertheless, these Jews owned horses and caravans, and sailed their own  ships long before the time when great merchants, like the English Jew  Antonio Fernandes Carvajal, traded in their own vessels between London and  the Canaries. We hear of Palestinian Jews in the third century and of  Italian Jews in the fifth century with ships of their own. Jewish sailors  abounded on the Mediterranean, which tended to become a Jewish lake. The  trade routes of the Jews were chiefly two. \"By one route,\" says Beazley,  \"they sailed from the ports of France and Italy to the Isthmus of Suez, and  thence down the Red Sea to India and Farther Asia. By another course, they  transported the goods of the West to the Syrian coast; up the Orontes to  Antioch; down the Euphrates to Bassora; and so along the Persian Gulf to  Oman and the Southern Ocean.\" Further, there were two chief overland  routes. On the one side merchants left Spain, traversed the straits of  Gibraltar, went by caravan from Tangier along the northern fringe of the  desert, to Egypt, Syria, and Persia. This was the southern route. Then  there was the northern route, through Germany, across the country of the  Slavs to the Lower Volga; thence, descending the river, they sailed across  the Caspian. Then the traveller proceeded along the Oxus valley to Balkh,  and, turning north-east, traversed the country of the Tagazgaz Turks, and  found himself at last on the frontier of China. When one realizes the  extent of such a journey, it is not surprising to hear that the greatest  authorities are agreed that in the Middle Ages, before the rise of the  Italian trading republics, the Jews were the chief middlemen between Europe  and Asia. Their vast commercial undertakings were productive of much good.  Not only did the Jews bring to Europe new articles of food and luxury, but  they served the various States as envoys and as intelligencers. The great  Anglo-Jewish merchant Carvajal provided Cromwell with valuable information,  as other Jewish merchants had done to other rulers of whom they were loyal  servants. In the fifteenth century Henry of Portugal applied to Jews for  intelligence respecting the interior of Africa, and a little later John,  king of the same land, derived accurate information respecting India from  two Jewish travellers that had spent many years at Ormuz and Calcutta. But  it is unnecessary to add more facts of this type. The Jewish merchant  traveller was no mere tradesman. He observed the country, especially did he  note the numbers and occupations of the Jews, their synagogues, their  schools, their vices, and their virtues.    In truth, the Jewish traveller, as he got farther from home, was more at  home than many of his contemporaries of other faiths when they were at  home. He kept alive that sense of the oneness of Judaism which could be  most strongly and completely achieved because there was no political bias  to separate it into hostile camps.    But the interest between the traveller and his home was maintained by  another bond. A striking feature of Jewish wayfaring life was the writing  of letters home. The \"Book of the Pious,\" composed about 1200, says: \"He  that departs from the city where his father and mother live, and travels to  a place of danger, and his father and mother are anxious on account of him;  it is the bounden duty of the son to hire a messenger as soon as he can and  despatch a letter to his father and mother, telling them when he departs  from the place of danger, that their anxiety may be allayed.\" Twice a year  all Jews wrote family letters, at the New Year and the Passover, and they  sent special greetings on birthdays. But the traveller was the chief  letter-writer. \"O my father,\" wrote the famous Obadiah of Bertinoro, in  1488, \"my departure from thee has caused thee sorrow and suffering, and I  am inconsolable that I was forced to leave at the time when age was  creeping on thee. When I think of thy grey hairs, which I no longer see, my  eyes flow over with tears. But if the happiness of serving thee in person  is denied to me, yet I can at least serve thee as thou desirest, by writing  to thee of my journey, by pouring my soul out to thee, by a full narrative  of what I have seen and of the state and manners of the Jews in all the  places where I have dwelt.\" After a long and valuable narrative, he  concludes in this loving strain: \"I have taken me a house in Jerusalem near  the synagogue, and my window overlooks it. In the court where my house is,  there live five women, and only one other man besides myself. He is blind,  and his wife attends to my needs. God be thanked, I have escaped the  sickness which affects nearly all travellers here. And I entreat you, weep  not at my absence, but rejoice in my joy, that I am in the Holy City. I  take "]]]
