It isn't a question of \"guessing\" with either  of us, really. It's a certainty. Not that she's said anything to me or  I to her. That is the malady of us all since you went. We are boiling  with secret thoughts, and keeping them to ourselves, which is bad for  us and for each other in the long run. I haven't told Monny that the  \"Egyptian Prince,\" as Rachel Guest has nicknamed him, is your friend  Captain Anthony Fenton playing some deep game, partly connected with  us, partly connected with a secret of his and yours; the secret you  said was a \"dusty\" one in which women would not be interested. I  haven't told her, because I don't want her to know. She is always  talking and thinking about him, and is vexed with herself for doing so.  She tries to stop, but can't. If she knew who he was, she wouldn't try  to stop. She'd let herself go, and feel she was living in a beautiful  romance. So she is living in a romance, but I want you to be the hero  of it, not your Anthony Fenton. That's why I don't open her eyes to the  game that's going on. The man is a perfect devil. Not a bad devil, but  a wild devil.    Mrs. East doesn't tell Monny that Antoun is \"Anthony with an h\" because  she is enjoying the thought that she alone knows the wonderful truth.  She imagines that she is in love with him. She believes Fate has  brought them together--that he is a \"reincarnation,\" as she is, and  that they ought to belong to each other. Well, let them! She isn't more  than six or seven years older than he, and she's rich (though poor  compared to Monny, of course), and every day she grows handsomer. So  does Monny. As for Rachel Guest--but she is in another part of my  story. Yet no, come to think of it, I'll bring her in now, because if  it weren't for developments concerning that young woman, I might be  able to wait one more day without begging you to come to us. She is  taking Monny away from me; and something odd is going on, I can't make  out what. Anyhow, that horrid Bedr el Gemaly is in it. And there's to  be a climax, I'm sure, to-morrow night. You'll get this letter  to-morrow morning, for I'm writing it early, with my hair down my back,  and my coffee not ordered, though I'm starving. We've left Shepheard's  because Monny wanted to live for a few days in a hotel close to the  Nile; and we were all pleased with the plan, for this was once a palace  of Khedive Ismael, and his furniture's still in it, the wildest mixture  of Orientalized French taste. There's a garden, with paths of vermilion  sand brought from somewhere in the desert. But the most convulsive  things live along the Nile Valley and spend their nights braying,  hooting, cooing, whining, bellowing, and barking. If only the donkeys  and dogs and birds and a few other sacred animals of Egypt would be a  little more reticent, especially after dark, the country would be  faultless. But what with worrying myself, and listening to furred and  feathered creatures worrying themselves, I couldn't sleep last night,  and I want you to help me! You'll be here to-morrow afternoon, and I  shall stay in to receive you instead of going to the bazaars with the  others, chaperoned by that dark-eyed devil of yours, \"Antoun.\" I was  there all yesterday, watching crowds of tourists buy beautiful  expensive things for themselves, and horrid inexpensive things to take  to their friends. Cleopatra purchased some disgracefully cheap pearls  no self-respecting _mummy_ would be seen in; and my prophetic soul  tells me that she's going to try and dissolve them in wine.    There's to be a fancy dress ball at this hotel to-morrow night--or  rather in the adjacent Casino, which is one reason we migrated here;  and praise the saints you'll be in time for it because if anything's  going to happen, you'll be able to stop whatever it is. If I were  supposed to know that Antoun was Anthony Fenton, I might take him into  my counsels. As it is, I can't. And anyhow, it wouldn't do much good,  at present, because a silent duel is going on between him and Monny. He  is bent on compelling her to acknowledge his authority. She is bent on  resisting it--which is a great compliment to his power--but he doesn't  know that, for he doesn't know Monny yet. It would be fun to watch them  together, if I hadn't your interests to think of.    He hasn't got rid of Bedr el Gemaly; but he would have done so, I'm  sure, if it hadn't been for an unexpected turn of the wheel, by the  hand of Fate in the person of Rachel Guest. Her hand is never _off_ the  wheel just now! The few days since you have been away have brought out  the true inwardness of her. _Felis Domestica_ with very little  _Domestica!_ Perhaps it's the air of Egypt which is having a really  extraordinary effect on all of us; perhaps it's the fact that Monny has  given Rachel a lot of lovely clothes which have rejuvenated and  apparently revitalized her. But you will see for yourself, and talk  things over with Your old friend, Biddy.    This was a nice letter to read, heaven knew how many hours too late!    My fatigue had slipped off like the skin off a grape. I felt energetic  enough to start out and walk to Cairo. What could be in Biddy's mind?  And what must she have thought when afternoon and evening passed  without even a telegram? The evening paper, if she had happened to  look, would have told her that the _Candace_ had reached Alexandria in  the morning, as she expected; and she could neither have guessed nor  believed that the whole day would pass without my having a chance to  read her letter. I ransacked the writing-table drawers for a telegraph  form; and finding one had begun to address it, when I stopped. The  message could not go out until morning. Meanwhile there were Monny's  and Anthony's letters to read. One or both might give me some clue to  the \"climax\" Biddy feared for to-night at the ball. I cut open Monny's  envelope, which had on it an alluring sunset picture of the Pyramids  and the name of the hotel. Hastily I ran through the pages. Not a hint  of anything disquieting! If I had read her letter instead of Brigit's I  might have gone to my well-earned rest without a qualm.    \"Dear Lord Ernest,\" Miss Gilder addressed me, in a handwriting which to  any \"expert\" would reveal some originality, more pride, still more  conscientiousness, any amount of self-will, and singularly little  conceit. An odd combination! But the Gilded Rose is that. She went on:    You asked me to write to you while you were away, and tell you the  news, and what I thought about things. But I'm thinking so much and so  fast that I can't sort out my thoughts. I suppose it must be so with  every one who comes to Egypt for the first time. Everything fascinates  and absorbs me, even more than I had hoped it would--almost too much, I  feel sometimes. Your Antoun Effendi is a very good guide, and I am not  sorry that we have him--except once in a while. And now and then I'm  glad. We're proud of his looks when we go about, for every one stares  at him and envies us for having him to take us about, instead of being  condemned to a mere dragoman. Oh, talking of dragomen (you see I _will_  call them that!), we still have Bedr, though I know you thought we  ought to give him up, and I don't see how we are ever to discharge him  now, for he has attached himself to Rachel G. in the most wonderful  way. It is _pathetic_. It began with a talk they had the day you left,  about his having been in America, and about _religion_. She found him  half inclined to be converted, and of course, her goodness and  unselfishness made her long to snatch him like a brand from the  burning. He thinks no one ever talked so wonderfully about religion as  she does, which she, dear thing, attributes to the fact that she taught  Sunday-school in Salem. She says, if she can have him to work upon even  for a few weeks, she is sure to make him a convert.    We haven't wasted a minute since you went away, but have seen sights  from morning till night, so as not to have missed anything when we  leave Cairo on the _Enchantress Isis_. I hope you'll be pleased that  I've given up my dream of having a private dahabeah, and that we shall  be with you on Sir Marcus Lark's boat. She is really a beauty. Antoun  took us over her, and on board we met Sir Marcus, who was showing some  friends round. Antoun introduced him to us. I think Sir M. asked him to  do it. We had great fun, for Sir Marcus seemed to take the most violent  fancy to Aunt Clara, who didn't like him at all. She says now that she  believes when she was Cleopatra he was Caesar, and that it's a pity he  can't wear a wreath to hide his baldness, as she remembers his doing  then. It's only a _very_ little bald spot, really, and Rachel Guest  says it reminds her of a tonsure on the head of a fine-looking monk.  Aunt C. quite resents Sir Marcus being able to engage the services of  you and Antoun. She wants you both to be there, but she doesn't like  Sir M. to have a superior position to Antoun's. That day on the  _Enchantress Isis_ Sir M. invited us to have tea on the deck, and it  really was enchanting; a deck like a huge open-air drawingroom, or one  of our biggest verandas at Newport, or somewhere,  with jolly green  wicker chairs and tables and sofas with heaps of cushions. But I  forgot--you've seen the boat. The best rooms _were_ engaged, but when  we talked to Sir Marcus, he called a man who can speak many languages  in bits--broken English, cracked German, fractured French, and goodness  knows what all. Between them, they arranged it somehow that we should  have our choice, and the other people were to take what was left. I  would have refused, because it didn't seem fair, but it was for Aunt  Clara's sake, evidently, that Sir M. wanted to make the exchange, and  _she_ accepted. She was as haughty as a queen, but in rather a  fascinating, soft way that I think men like."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9806"],[0,"Mr. Justice Raffles (#20)"],[1,"down into the square, but  leading like a companion hatchway into a valley of once red tiles, now  stained blue-black in the starlight. It was great to stand upright here  in the pure night air out of sight of man or beast. Smokeless  chimney-stacks deleted whole pages of stars, but put me more in mind of  pollards rising out of these rigid valleys, and sprouting with telephone  wires that interlaced for foliage. The valley I was in ended fore and  aft in a similar slope to that at either side; the length of it  doubtless tallied with the frontage of a single house; and when I had  clambered over the southern extremity into a precisely similar valley I  saw that this must be the case. I had entered the fourth house beyond  Burroughs and Burroughs's, or was it the fifth? I threaded three  valleys, and then I knew.    In all three there had been dormer windows on either hand, that on the  square side leading into the loft; the other, or others, forming a sort  of skylight to some top-floor room. Suddenly I struck one of these  standing very wide open, and trod upon a rope's end curled like a snake  on the leads. I stooped down, and at a touch I knew that I had hold of  Raffles's favourite Manila, which united a silken flexibility with the  strength of any hawser. It was tied to the window-post, and it dangled  into a room in which there was a dull red glow of fire: an inhabited room  if ever I put my nose in one! My body must follow, however, where Raffles  had led the way; and when it did I came to ground sooner than I expected  on something less secure. The dying firelight, struggling through the  bars of a kitchen range, showed my tennis-shoes in the middle of the  kitchen table. A cat was stretching itself on the hearth-rug as I made a  step of a wooden chair, and came down like a cat myself.    I found the kitchen door, found a passage so dark that the window at the  end hung like a picture slashed across the middle. Yet it only looked  into the square, for I peered out when I had crept along the passage, and  even thought I both heard and saw the enemy at their old post. But I was  in another enemy's country now; at every step I stopped to listen for the  thud of feet bounding out of bed. Hearing nothing, I had the temerity at  last to strike a match upon my trousers, and by its light I found the  outer door. This was not bolted nor yet shut; it was merely ajar, and so  I left it.    The rooms opposite appeared to be an empty set; those on the second and  first floors were only partially shut off by swing doors leading to  different departments of the mighty offices of Burroughs and Burroughs.  There were no lights upon these landings, and I gathered my information  by means of successive matches, whose tell-tale ends I carefully  concealed about my person, and from copious legends painted on the walls.  Thus I had little difficulty in groping my way to the private offices of  Sir John Burroughs, head of the celebrated firm; but I looked in vain for  a layer of light under any of the massive mahogany doors with which this  portion of the premises was glorified. Then I began softly trying doors  that proved to be locked. Only one yielded to my hand; and when it was a  few inches open, all was still black; but the next few brought me to the  end of my quest, and the close of my solitary adventures.          CHAPTER XII    A Midsummer Night's Work      The dense and total darkness was broken in one place, and one only, by a  plateful of light proceeding from a tiny bulb of incandescence in its  centre. This blinding atom of white heat lit up a hand hardly moving, a  pen continually poised, over a disc of snowy paper; and on the other  side, something that lay handy on the table, reflecting the light in its  plated parts. It was Raffles at his latest deviltry. He had not heard me,  and he could not see; but for that matter he never looked up from his  task. Sometimes his face bent over it, and I could watch its absolute  concentration. The brow was furrowed, and the mouth pursed, yet there was  a hint of the same quiet and wary smile with which Raffles would bowl an  over or drill holes in a door.    I stood for some moments fascinated, entranced, before creeping in to  warn him of my presence in a whisper. But this time he heard my step,  snatched up electric torch and glittering revolver, and covered me with  the one in the other's light.    \"A.J.!\" I gasped.    \"Bunny!\" he exclaimed in equal amazement and displeasure. \"What the devil  do you mean by this?\"    \"You're in danger,\" I whispered. \"I came to warn you!\"    \"Danger? I'm never out of it. But how did you know where to find me, and  how on God's earth did _you_ get here?\"    \"I'll tell you some other time. You know those two brutes you dodged the  other day?\"    \"I ought to.\"    \"They're waiting below for you at this very moment.\"    Raffles peered a few moments through the handful of white light between  our faces.    \"Let them wait!\" said he, and replaced the torch upon the table and put  down his revolver for his pen.    \"They're detectives!\" I urged.    \"Are they, Bunny?\"    \"What else could they be?\"    \"What, indeed!\" murmured Raffles, as he fell to work again with bent head  and deliberate pen.    \"You gave them the slip on Friday, but they must have known your game and  lain in wait for you here, one or other of them, ever since. It's my  belief Dan Levy put them up to it, and the yarn about the letter was just  to tempt you into this trap and get you caught in the act. He didn't want  a copy one bit; for God's sake, don't stop to finish it now!\"    \"I don't agree with you,\" said Raffles without looking up, \"and I don't  do things by halves, Your precious detectives must have patience, Bunny,  and so must you.\" He held his watch to the bulb. \"In about twenty minutes  there'll be real danger, but we couldn't be safer in our beds for the  next ten. So perhaps you'll let me finish without further interruption,  or else get out by yourself as you came in.\"    I turned away from Raffles and his light, and blundered back to the  landing. The blood boiled in my veins. Here had I fought and groped my  way to his side, through difficulties it might have taxed even him to  surmount, as one man swims ashore with a rope from the wreck, at the same  mortal risk, with the same humane purpose. And not a word of thanks, not  one syllable of congratulation, but \"get out by yourself as you came in!\"  I had more than half a mind to get out, and for good; nay, as I stood and  listened on the landing, I could have found it in my outraged heart to  welcome those very sleuthhounds from the square, with a cordon of police  behind them.    Yet my boiling blood ran cold when warm breath smote my cheek and a hand  my shoulder at one and the same awful moment.    \"Raffles!\" I cried in a strangled voice.    \"Hush, Bunny!\" he chuckled in my ear. \"Didn't you know who it was?\"    \"I never heard you; why did you steal on me like that?\"    \"You see you're not the only one who can do it, Bunny! I own it would  have served me right if you'd brought the square about our ears.\"    \"Have you finished in there?\" I asked gruffly.    \"Rather!\"    \"Then you'd better hurry up and put everything as you found it.\"    \"It's all done, Bunny; red tape tied on such a perfect forgery that  the crux will be to prove it is one; safe locked up, and every paper  in its place.\"    \"I never heard a sound.\"    \"I never made one,\" said Raffles, leading me upstairs by the arm. \"You  see how you put me on my mettle, Bunny, old boy!\"    I said no more till we reached the self-contained flat at the top of the  house; then I begged Raffles to be quiet in a lower whisper than his own.    \"Why, Bunny? Do you think there are people inside?\"    \"Aren't there?\" I cried aloud in my relief.    \"You flatter me, Bunny!\" laughed Raffles, as we groped our way in. \"This  is where they keep their John Bulldog, a magnificent figure of a  commissionaire with the V.C. itself on his manly bosom. Catch me come  when he was at home; one of us would have had to die, and it would have  been a shame either way. Poor pussy, then, poor puss!\"    We had reached the kitchen and the cat was rubbing itself against  Raffles's legs.    \"But how on earth did you get rid of him for the night?\"    \"Made friends with him when I called on Friday; didn't I tell you I had  an appointment with the bloated head of this notorious firm when I  cleared out of Lord's? I'm about to strengthen his already unrivalled  list of clients; you shall hear all about that later. We had another  interview this afternoon, when I asked my V.C. if he ever went to the  theatre; you see he had spotted Tom Fool, and told me he never had a  chance of getting to Lord's. So I got him tickets for 'Rosemary' instead,  but of course I swore they had just been given to me and I couldn't use  them. You should have seen how the hero beamed! So that's where he is,  he and his wife--or was, until the curtain went down.\"    \"Good Lord, Raffles, is the piece over?\"    \"Nearly ten minutes ago, but it'll take 'em all that unless they come  home in a cab.\"    And Raffles had been sitting before the fire, on the kitchen table,  encouraging the cat, when this formidable V.C. and his wife must be  coming every instant nearer Gray's Inn Square!    \"Why, my dear Bunny, I should back myself to swarm up and out without  making a sound or leaving a sign, if I heard our hero's key in the lock  this moment. After you, Bunny.\"    I climbed up with trembling knees, Raffles holding the rope taut to make  it easier. Once more I stood upright under the stars and the telephone  wires, and leaned against a chimney-stack to wait for Raffles. But before  I saw him, before I even heard his unnecessarily noiseless movements, I  heard something else that sent a chill all through me.    It was not the sound of a key in the lock. It was something far worse  than that. It was the sound of voices"]]]
