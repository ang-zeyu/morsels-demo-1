One of his earliest speeches in the Prussian Landtag was a  fervent protest against the introduction of civil marriage; yet the  civil marriage clause in the German constitution is his work. He was  by birth and tradition a believer in the divine right of kings; yet  the King of Hanover could tell something of the manner in which  Bismarck dealt with the divine right of kings if it stood in the way  of German unity. He took pride in belonging to the most feudal  aristocracy of western Europe, the Prussian Junkerdom; yet he did more  to uproot feudal privileges than any other German statesman since  1848. He gloried in defying public opinion, and was wont to say that  he felt doubtful about himself whenever he met with popular applause;  yet he is the founder of the German Parliament, and he founded it on  direct and universal suffrage. He was the sworn enemy of the Socialist  party--he attempted to destroy it, root and branch; yet through the  nationalization of railways and the obligatory insurance of workmen he  infused more Socialism into German legislation than any other  statesman before him.    Truly, a man who could thus sacrifice his own wishes and instincts to  the common good; who could so completely sink his own personality in  the cause of the nation; who with such matchless courage defended this  cause against attacks from whatever quarter--against court intrigue no  less than against demagogues--such a man had a right to stand above  parties; and he spoke the truth when, some years before leaving  office, in a moment of gloom and disappointment he wrote under his  portrait, _Patrice inserviendo consumor_.    III    There is a strange, but after all perfectly natural, antithesis in  German national character. The same people that instinctively believes  in political paternalism, that willingly submits to restrictions of  personal liberty in matters of State such as no Englishman would ever  tolerate, is more jealous of its independence than perhaps any other  nation in matters pertaining to the intellectual, social, and  religious life of the individual. It seems as if the very pressure  from without had helped to strengthen and enrich the life within.    Not only all the great men of German thought, from Luther down to the  Grimms and the Humboldts, have been conspicuous for their freedom from  artificial conventions and for the originality and homeliness of their  human intercourse; but even the average German official--wedded as he  may be to his rank or his title, anxious as he may be to preserve an  outward decorum in exact keeping with the precise shade of his public  status--is often the most delightfully unconventional, good-natured,  unsophisticated, and even erratic being in the world, as soon as he  has left the cares of his office behind him. Germany is the classic  land of queer people. It is the land of Quintus Fixlein, Onkel Braesig,  Leberecht Huehnchen, and the host of _Fliegende Blatter_ worthies; it  is the land of the beer-garden and the Kaffeekranzchen, of the  Christmas-tree and the Whitsuntide merry-making; it is the land of  country inns and of student pranks. What more need be said to bring  before one's mind the wealth of hearty joyfulness, jolly  good-fellowship, boisterous frolic, sturdy humor, simple directness,  and genuinely democratic feeling that characterizes social life in  Germany.    And still less reason is there for dwelling on the intellectual and  religious independence of German character. Absence of constraint in  scientific inquiry and religious conduct is indeed the very palladium  of German freedom. Nowhere is higher education so entirely removed  from class distinction as in the country where the imperial princes  are sent to the same school with the sons of tradesmen and artisans.  Nowhere is there so little religious formalism, coupled with such deep  religious feeling, as in the country where sermons are preached to  empty benches, while _Tannhauser_ and _Lohengrin, Wallenstein_ and  _Faust_, are listened to with the hush of awe and bated breath by  thousands upon thousands.    In all these respects--socially, intellectually, religiously--Bismarck  was the very incarnation of German character. Although an aristocrat  by birth and bearing, and although, especially during the years of  early manhood, passionately given over to the aristocratic habits of  dueling, hunting, swaggering and carousing, he was essentially a man  of the people. Nothing was so utterly foreign to him as any form of  libertinism; even his eccentricities were of the hardy, homespun sort.  He was absolutely free from social vanity; he detested court  festivities; he set no store by orders or decorations; the only two  among the innumerable ones conferred upon him which he is said to have  highly valued were the Prussian order of the Iron Cross, bestowed for  personal bravery on the battlefield, and the medal for \"rescuing from  danger\" which he earned in 1842 for having saved his groom from  drowning by plunging into the water after him.    All his instincts were bound up with the soil from which he had  sprung. He passionately loved the North German plain, with its gloomy  moorlands, its purple heather, its endless wheatfields, its kingly  forests, its gentle lakes, and its superb sweep of sky and clouds.  Writing to his friends when abroad--he traveled very little abroad--he  was in the habit of describing foreign scenery by comparing it to  familiar views and places on his own estates. During sleepless nights  in the Chancellery at Berlin there would often rise before him a  sudden vision of Varzin, his Pomeranian country-seat, \"perfectly  distinct in the minutest particulars, like a great picture with all  its colors fresh--the green trees, the sunshine on the stems, the blue  sky above. I saw every individual tree.\" Never was he more happy than  when alone with nature. \"Saturday,\" he writes to his wife from  Frankfort, \"I drove to Ruedesheim. There I took a boat, rowed out on  the Rhine, and swam in the moonlight, with nothing but nose and eyes  out of water, as far as the Maeuseturm near Bingen, where the bad  bishop came to his end. It gives one a peculiar dreamy sensation to  float thus on a quiet warm night in the water, gently carried down by  the current, looking above on the heavens studded with moon and stars,  and on each side the banks and wooded hilltops and the battlements of  the old castles bathed in the moonlight, whilst nothing falls on one's  ear but the gentle splashing of one's movements. I should like to swim  like this every evening.\" And what poet has more deeply felt than he  that vague musical longing which seizes one when far away from human  sounds, by the brook-side or the hill-slope? \"I feel as if I were  looking out on the mellowing foliage of a fine September day,\" he  writes again to his wife, \"health and spirits good, but with a soft  touch of melancholy, a little homesickness, a longing for deep woods  and lakes, for a desert, for yourself and the children, and all this  mixed up with a sunset and Beethoven.\"    His domestic affections were by no means limited to those united to  him by ties of blood; he cherished strong patriarchal feelings for  every member of his household, past or present. He possessed in a high  degree the German tenderness for little things. He never forgot a  service rendered to him, however small. In the midst of the most  engrossing public activity he kept himself informed about the minutest  details of the management of his estates, so that his wife could once  laughingly say that a turnip from his own fields interested him vastly  more than all the problems of international politics.    His humor, also, was entirely of the German stamp. It was boisterous,  rollicking, aggressive, unsparing--of himself as little as of  others--cynic, immoderate, but never without a touch of good-nature.  His satire was often crushing, never venomous. His wit was racy and  exuberant never equivocal. Whether he describes his _vis-a-vis_ at a  hotel table, his Excellency So-and-So, as \"one of those figures which  appear to one when he has the nightmare--a fat frog without legs, who  opens his mouth as wide as his shoulders, like a carpet-bag, for each  bit, so that I am obliged to hold tight on by the table from  giddiness\"; whether he characterizes his colleagues at the Frankfort  Bundestag as \"mere caricatures of periwig diplomatists, who at once  put on their official visage if I merely beg of them a light to my  cigar, and who study their words and looks with Regensburg care when  they ask for the key of the lavatory\"; whether he sums up his  impression of the excited, emotional manner in which Jules Favre  pleaded with him for the peace terms in the words, \"He evidently took  me for a public meeting\"; whether he declined to look at the statue  erected to him at Cologne, because he \"didn't care to see himself  fossilized\"; whether he spoke of the unprecedented popular ovations  given to him at his final departure from Berlin as a \"first-class  funeral\"--there are always the same childlike directness, the same  naive impulsiveness, the same bantering earnestness, the same sublime  contempt for sham and hypocrisy.    And what man has been more truthful in intellectual and religious  matters? He, the man of iron will, of ferocious temper, was at the  same time the coolest reasoner, the most unbiased thinker. He  willingly submitted to the judgment of experts, he cheerfully  acknowledged intellectual talent in others, he took a pride in having  remained a learner all his life, but he hated arrogant amateurishness.  He was not a church-goer; he declined to be drawn into the circle of  religious schemers and reactionary fanatics; he would occasionally  speak in contemptuous terms of \"the creed of court chaplains\"; but,  writing to his wife of that historic meeting with Napoleon in the  lonely cottage near the battlefield"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13058"],[0,"The Teeth of the Tiger (#3)"],[1," of  course, without charge. He lived first in Egypt and then in Algiers and  Morocco. Last year he settled down in Paris, where he died four weeks ago  as the result of a most stupid accident.\"    \"A carelessly administered hypodermic injection, was it not, Monsieur le  Prefet?\" asked the secretary of the American Embassy. \"It was mentioned  in the papers and reported to us at the embassy.\"    \"Yes,\" said Desmalions. \"To assist his recovery from a long attack of  influenza which had kept him in bed all the winter, Mr. Mornington, by  his doctor's orders, used to give himself injections of glycero-phosphate  of soda. He must have omitted the necessary precautions on the last  occasion when he did so, for the wound was poisoned, inflammation set in  with lightning rapidity, and Mr. Mornington was dead in a few hours.\"    The Prefect of Police turned to the solicitor and asked:    \"Have I summed up the facts correctly, Maitre Lepertuis?\"    \"Absolutely, Monsieur le Prefet.\"    M. Desmalions continued:    \"The next morning, Maitre Lepertuis called here and, for reasons which  you will understand when you have heard the document read, showed me  Cosmo Mornington's will, which had been placed in his hands.\"    While the Prefect was looking through the papers, Maitre Lepertuis added:    \"I may be allowed to say that I saw my client only once before I was  summoned to his death-bed; and that was on the day when he sent for me to  come to his room in the hotel to hand me the will which he had just made.  This was at the beginning of his influenza. In the course of conversation  he told me that he had been making some inquiries with a view to tracing  his mother's family, and that he intended to pursue these inquiries  seriously after his recovery. Circumstances, as it turned out, prevented  his fulfilling his purpose.\"    Meanwhile, the Prefect of Police had taken from among the documents an  open envelope containing two sheets of paper. He unfolded the larger of  the two and said:    \"This is the will. I will ask you to listen attentively while I read it  and also the document attached to it.\"    The others settled themselves in their chairs; and the Prefect read out:    \"The last will and testament of me, Cosmo Mornington, eldest son of  Hubert Mornington and Ermeline Roussel, his wife, a naturalized citizen  of the United States of America. I give and bequeath to my adopted  country three fourths of my estate, to be employed on works of charity in  accordance with the instructions, written in my hand, which Maitre  Lepertuis will be good enough to forward to the Ambassador of the United  States. The remainder of my property, to the value of about one hundred  million francs, consisting of deposits in various Paris and London banks,  a list of which is in the keeping of Maitre Lepertuis, I give and  bequeath, in memory of my dear mother, to her favourite sister Elizabeth  Roussel or her direct heirs; or, in default of Elizabeth and her heirs,  to her second sister Armande Roussel or her direct heirs; or, in default  of both sisters and their heirs, to their cousin Victor Roussel or his  direct heirs.    \"In the event of my dying without discovering the surviving members of  the Roussel family, or of the cousin of the three sisters, I request my  friend Don Luis Perenna to make all the necessary investigations. With  this object, I hereby appoint him the executor of my will in so far as  concerns the European portion of my estate, and I beg him to undertake  the conduct of the events that may arise after my death or in consequence  of my death to consider himself my representative and to act in all  things for the benefit of my memory and the accomplishment of my wishes.  In gratitude for this service and in memory of the two occasions on which  he saved my life, I give and bequeath to the said Don Luis Perenna the  sum of one million francs.\"    The Prefect stopped for a few seconds. Don Luis murmured:    \"Poor Cosmo! ... I should not have needed that inducement to carry out  his last wishes.\"    M. Desmalions continued his reading:    \"Furthermore, if, within three months of my death, the investigations  made by Don Luis Perenna and by Maitre Lepertuis have led to no result;  if no heir and no survivor of the Roussel family have come forward to  receive the bequest, then the whole hundred million francs shall  definitely, all later claims notwithstanding, accrue to my friend Don  Luis Perenna. I know him well enough to feel assured that he will employ  this fortune in a manner which shall accord with the loftiness of his  schemes and the greatness of the plans which he described to me so  enthusiastically in our tent in Morocco.\"    M. Desmalions stopped once more and raised his eyes to Don Luis, who  remained silent and impassive, though a tear glistened on his lashes.  Comte d'Astrignac said:    \"My congratulations, Perenna.\"    \"Let me remind you, Major,\" he answered, \"that this legacy is subject to  a condition. And I swear that, if it depends on me, the survivors of the  Roussel family shall be found.\"    \"I'm sure of it,\" said the officer. \"I know you.\"    \"In any case,\" asked the Prefect of Police of Don Luis, \"you do not  refuse this conditional legacy?\"    \"Well, no,\" said Perenna, with a laugh. \"There are things which one  can't refuse.\"    \"My question,\" said the Prefect, \"was prompted by the last paragraph of  the will: 'If, for any reason, my friend Perenna should refuse this  legacy, or if he should have died before the date fixed for its payment,  I request the Ambassador of the United States and the Prefect of Police  for the time being to consult as to the means of building and maintaining  in Paris a university confined to students and artists of American  nationality and to devote the money to this purpose. And I hereby  authorize the Prefect of Police in any case to receive a sum of three  hundred thousand francs out of my estate for the benefit of the Paris  Police Fund.'\"    M. Desmalions folded the paper and took up another.    \"There is a codicil to the will. It consists of a letter which Mr.  Mornington wrote to Maitre Lepertuis some time after and which explains  certain points with greater precision:    \"I request Maitre Lepertuis to open my will on the day after my death, in  the presence of the Prefect of Police, who will be good enough to keep  the matter an entire secret for a month. One month later, to the day, he  will have the kindness to summon to his office Maitre Lepertuis, Don Luis  Perenna, and a prominent member of the United States Embassy. Subsequent  to the reading of the will, a cheque for one million francs shall be  handed to my friend and legatee Don Luis Perenna, after a simple  examination of his papers and a simple verification of his identity. I  should wish this verification to be made as regards the personality by  Major Comte d'Astrignac, who was his commanding officer in Morocco, and  who unfortunately had to retire prematurely from the army; and as regards  birth by a member of the Peruvian Legation, as Don Luis Perenna, though  retaining his Spanish nationality, was born in Peru.    \"Furthermore, I desire that my will be not communicated to the Roussel  heirs until two days later, at Maitre Lepertuis's office. Finally--and  this is the last expression of my wishes as regards the disposal of my  estate and the method of proceeding with that disposal--the Prefect of  Police will be good enough to summon the persons aforesaid to his office,  for a second time, at a date to be selected by himself, not less than  sixty nor more than ninety days after the first meeting. Then and not  till then will the definite legatee be named and proclaimed according to  his rights, nor shall any be so named and proclaimed unless he be present  at this meeting, at the conclusion of which Don Luis Perenna, who must  also attend it, shall become the definite legatee if, as I have said, no  survivor nor heir of the Roussel sisters or of their cousin Victor have  come forward to claim the bequest.\"    Replacing both documents in the envelope the Prefect of Police concluded:    \"You have now, gentlemen, heard the will of Mr. Cosmo Mornington, which  explains your presence here. A sixth person will join us shortly: one of  my detectives, whom I instructed to make the first inquiries about the  Roussel family and who will give you the result of his investigations.  But, for the moment, we must proceed in accordance with the testator's  directions.    \"Don Luis Perenna's papers, which he sent me, at my request, a fortnight  ago, have been examined by myself and are perfectly in order. As regards  his birth, I wrote and begged his Excellency the Peruvian minister to  collect the most precise information.\"    \"The minister entrusted this mission to me,\" said Senor Caceres, the  Peruvian attache. \"It offered no difficulties. Don Luis Perenna comes of  an old Spanish family which emigrated thirty years ago, but which  retained its estates and property in Europe. I knew Don Luis's father in  America; and he used to speak of his only son with the greatest  affection. It was our legation that informed the son, three years ago, of  his father's death. I produce a copy of the letter sent to Morocco.\"    \"And I have the original letter here, among the documents forwarded by  Don Luis Perenna to the Prefect of Police. Do you, Major, recognize  Private Perenna, who fought under your orders in the Foreign Legion?\"    \"I recognize him,\" said Comte d'Astrignac.    \"Beyond the possibility of a mistake?\"    \"Beyond the possibility of a mistake and without the least feeling of  hesitation.\"    The Prefect of Police, with a laugh, hinted:    \"You recognize Private Perenna, whom the men, carried away by a sort of  astounded admiration of his exploits, used to call Arsene Lupin?\"    \"Yes, Monsieur le Prefet,\" replied the major sharply, \"the one whom the  men called Arsene Lupin, but whom the officers"]]]
