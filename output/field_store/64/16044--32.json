Have currant jelly to eat with it. As  venison chills immediately, the plates should be kept on heaters.    You may make another gravy with a pound and a half of scraps and  trimmings or inferior pieces of venison, put into a sauce-pan with  three pints of water, a few cloves, a few blades of mace, half a  nutmeg; and salt and cayenne to your taste. Boil it down slowly to  a pint. Then skim off the fat, and strain the gravy into a clean  sauce-pan. Add to it half a pint of currant jelly, half a pint of  claret, and near a quarter of a pound of butter divided into bits  and rolled in flour. Send it to table in two small tureens or  sauce-boats. This gravy will be found very fine.    Venison should never be roasted unless very fat. The shoulder is a  roasting piece, and may be done without the paper or paste.    Venison is best when quite fresh; but if it is expedient to keep  it a week before you cook it, wash it well with milk and water,  and then dry it perfectly with cloths till there is not the least  damp remaining on it. Then mix together powdered ginger and  pepper, and rub it well over every part of the meat. Do not,  however, attempt to keep it unless the weather is quite cold.      TO HASH COLD VENISON.    Cut the meat in nice small slices, and put the trimmings and bones  into a sauce-pan with barely water enough to cover them. Let them  stew for an hour. Then strain the liquid into a stew-pan; add to  it some bits of butter rolled in flour, and whatever gravy was  left of the venison the day before. Stir in some currant jelly,  and give it a boil up. Then put in the meat, and keep it over the  fire just long enough to warm it through; but do not allow it to  boil, as it has been once cooked already.      VENISON STEAKS.    Cut them from the neck or haunch. Season them with pepper and  salt. When the gridiron has been well heated over a bed of bright  coals, grease the bars, and lay the steaks upon it. Broil them  well, turning them once, and taking care to save as much of the  gravy as possible. Serve them up with some currant jelly laid on  each steak. Have your plates set on heaters.      VENISON PASTY.    The neck, breast, and shoulder are the parts used for a venison  pie or pasty. Cut the meat into pieces (fat and lean together) and  put the bones and trimmings into a stew-pan with pepper and salt,  and water or veal broth enough to cover it. Simmer it till you  have drawn out a good gravy. Then strain it.    In the mean time make a good rich paste, and roll it rather thick.  Cover the bottom and sides of a deep dish with one sheet of it,  and put in your meat, having seasoned it with pepper, salt,  nutmeg, and mace. Pour in the gravy which you have prepared from  the trimmings, and two glasses of port or claret, and lay on the  top some hits of butter rolled in flour. Cover the pie with a  thick lid of paste, and ornament it handsomely with leaves and  flowers formed with a tin cutter. Bake it two hours or more,  according to its size.      VENISON HAMS.    Venison for hams must be newly killed, and in every respect as  good as possible. Mix together equal quantities of salt and brown  sugar, and rub it well into the hams. Put them into a tub, and let  them lie seven days; turning them and rubbing them daily with the  mixture of salt and sugar. Next mix together saltpetre and common  salt, in the proportion of two ounces of saltpetre to a handful of  salt. Rub it well into your hams, and let them lie a week longer.  Then wipe them, rub them with bran, and smoke them a fortnight  over hickory wood. Pack them in wood ashes.    Venison ham must not be cooked before it is eaten. It is used for  the tea-table, chipped or shred like dried beef, to which it is  considered very superior.    It will not keep as long as other smoked meat.      TO ROAST A KID.    A kid should be cooked the day it is killed, or the day after at  farthest. They are best from three to four months old, and are  only eaten while they live on milk.    Wash the kid well, wipe it dry, and truss it. Stuff the body with  a force-meat of grated bread, butter or suet, sweet herbs, pepper,  salt, nutmeg, grated lemon-peel, and beaten egg; and sew it up to  keep the stuffing in its place. Put it on the spit and rub it over  with lard, or sweet oil. Put a little salt and water into the  dripping-pan, and baste the kid first with that, and afterwards  with its own gravy. Or you may make it very nice by basting it  with cream. It should roast about three hours. At the last,  transfer the gravy to a small sauce-pan; thicken it with a little  butter rolled in flour, give it a boil up, and send it to table in  a boat. Garnish the kid with lumps of currant jelly laid round the  edge of the dish.    A fawn (which should never be kept more than one day) may be  roasted in the same manner; also, a hare, or a couple of rabbits.    You may send to table, to eat with the kid, a dish of chestnuts  boiled or roasted, and divested of the shells.      TO ROAST A HARE.    If a hare is old do not roast it, but make soup of it. Wash and  soak it in water for an hour, and change the water several times,  having made a little slit in the neck to let out the blood. Take  out the heart and liver, and scald them. Drain, dry, and truss the  hare. Make a force-meat richer and more moist than usual, and add  to it the heart and liver minced fine. Soak the bread-crumbs in a  little claret before you mix them with the other ingredients.  Stuff the body of the hare with this force-meat, and sew it up.  Put it on the spit, rub it with butter, and roast it before a  brisk fire. For the first half hour baste it with butter; and  afterwards with cream, or with milk thickened with beaten yolk of  egg. At the last, dredge it lightly with flour. The hare will  require about two hours roasting.    For sauce, take the drippings of the hare mixed with cream or with  claret, and a little lemon-juice, a bit of butter, and some bread-crumbs.  Give it a boil up, and send it to table in a boat. Garnish  the hare with slices of currant jelly laid round it in the dish.      FRICASSEED RABBITS.    The best way of cooking rabbits is to fricassee them. Take a  couple of fine ones, and cut them up, or disjoint them. Put them  into a stew-pan; season them with cayenne pepper and salt, some  chopped parsley, and some powdered mace. Pour in a pint of warm  water (or of veal broth, if you have it) and stew it over a slow  fire till the rabbits are quite tender; adding (when they are  about half done) some bits of butter rolled in flour. Just before  you take it from the fire, enrich the gravy with a jill or more of  thick cream with some nutmeg grated into it. Stir the gravy well,  but take care not to let it boil after the cream is in, lest it  curdle.    Put the pieces of rabbit on a hot dish, and pour the gravy over  them.      TO STEW RABBITS.    Having trussed the rabbits, lay them in a pan of warm water for  about fifteen minutes. Then put them into a pot with plenty of  water and a little salt, and stew them slowly for about an hour,  or till they are quite tender. In the mean time, peel and boil in  a sauce-pan a dozen onions. When they are quite tender all  through, take them out, and drain and slice them. Have ready some  drawn, butter, prepared by taking six ounces of butter, (cut into  bits and rolled in about three tea-spoonfuls of flour,) and  melting it in a jill of milk. After shaking it round-over hot  coals till it simmers, add to it the onions, and give it one boil  up.    When the rabbits are done stewing lay them on a large dish (having  first cut off their heads, which should not he sent to table) and  cover them all over with the onion-sauce, to which you may add  some grated nutmeg.      TO FRY RABBITS,    Having washed the rabbits well, put them into a pan of cold water,  and let them lie in it two or three hours. Then cut them into  joints, dry them in a cloth, dredge them with flour, strew them  with chopped parsley, and fry them in butter. After you take them  out of the frying-pan, stir a wine-glass of cream into the gravy,  or the beaten yolk of an egg. Do not let it boil, but pour it at  once into the dish with the rabbits.    Rabbits are very good baked in a pie. A boiled or pot-pie may be  made of them.    They may he stuffed with force-meat and roasted, basting them with  butter. Cut off their heads before you send them to table.          POULTRY, GAME, &c.      GENERAL REMARKS    In buying poultry choose those that are fresh and fat. Half-grown  poultry is comparatively insipid; it is best when full-grown but  not old. Old poultry is tough and hard. An old goose is so tough  as to be frequently uneatable. When poultry is young the skin is  thin and tender, and can be easily tipped by trying it with a pin;  the legs are smooth; the feet moist and limber; and the eyes full  and bright. The body should be thick and the breast fat. The bill  and feet of a young goose are yellow, and have but few hairs on  them; when old they are red and hairy.    Poultry is best when killed overnight, as if cooked too soon  after-killing, it is hard and does not taste well. It is not the  custom in America, as in some parts of Europe, to keep game, or  indeed any sort of eatable, till it begins to taint; all food when  inclining to decomposition being regarded by us with disgust.    When poultry or game is frozen, it should be brought into the  kitchen early in the morning of the day on which it is to be  cooked. It may be thawed by laying it several hours in cold water.  If it is not thawed it will require double the time to cook, and  will be tough and tasteless when done. In drawing poultry be very  careful not to break the gall, lest its disagreeable bitterness  should be communicated to the liver.    Poultry should be always scalded in hot water to make the feathers  come out easily."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9629"],[0,"Ghost Stories of an Antiquary Part 2: More Ghost Stories (#20)"],[1," dark, and I felt the cupboard door pushed  out against me while I held it, and Thomas Snell helped me: but for all  we pressed to keep it shut as hard as we could, it was forced out against  us, and we had to fall back.    _L.C.J._ And pray what came out--a mouse?    _S._ No, my lord, it was greater than a mouse, but I could not see what  it was: it fleeted very swift over the floor and out at the door.    _L.C.J._ But come; what did it look like? Was it a person?    _S._ My lord, I cannot tell what it was, but it ran very low, and it was  of a dark colour. We were both daunted by it, Thomas Snell and I, but we  made all the haste we could after it to the door that stood open. And we  looked out, but it was dark and we could see nothing.    _L.C.J._ Was there no tracks of it on the floor? What floor have you  there?    _S._ It is a flagged floor and sanded, my lord, and there was an  appearance of a wet track on the floor, but we could make nothing of it,  neither Thomas Snell nor me, and besides, as I said, it was a foul night.    _L.C.J._ Well, for my part, I see not--though to be sure it is an odd  tale she tells--what you would do with this evidence.    _Att._ My lord, we bring it to show the suspicious carriage of the  prisoner immediately after the disappearance of the murdered person: and  we ask the jury's consideration of that; and also to the matter of the  voice heard without the house.    Then the prisoner asked some questions not very material, and Thomas  Snell was next called, who gave evidence to the same effect as Mrs  Arscott, and added the following:    _Att._ Did anything pass between you and the prisoner during the time Mrs  Arscott was out of the room?    _Th._ I had a piece of twist in my pocket.    _Att._ Twist of what?    _Th._ Twist of tobacco, sir, and I felt a disposition to take a pipe of  tobacco. So I found a pipe on the chimney-piece, and being it was twist,  and in regard of me having by an oversight left my knife at my house, and  me not having over many teeth to pluck at it, as your lordship or anyone  else may have a view by their own eyesight--    _L.C.J._ What is the man talking about? Come to the matter, fellow! Do  you think we sit here to look at your teeth?    _Th._ No, my lord, nor I would not you should do, God forbid! I know your  honours have better employment, and better teeth, I would not wonder.    _L.C.J._ Good God, what a man is this! Yes, I _have_ better teeth, and  that you shall find if you keep not to the purpose.    _Th._ I humbly ask pardon, my lord, but so it was. And I took upon me,  thinking no harm, to ask Squire Martin to lend me his knife to cut my  tobacco. And he felt first of one pocket and then of another and it was  not there at all. And says I, 'What! have you lost your knife, Squire?'  And up he gets and feels again and he sat down, and such a groan as he  gave. 'Good God!' he says, 'I must have left it there.' 'But,' says I,  'Squire, by all appearance it is _not_ there. Did you set a value on it,'  says I, 'you might have it cried.' But he sat there and put his head  between his hands and seemed to take no notice to what I said. And then  it was Mistress Arscott come tracking back out of the kitchen place.    Asked if he heard the voice singing outside the house, he said 'No,' but  the door into the kitchen was shut, and there was a high wind: but says  that no one could mistake Ann Clark's voice.    Then a boy, William Reddaway, about thirteen years of age, was called,  and by the usual questions, put by the Lord Chief Justice, it was  ascertained that he knew the nature of an oath. And so he was sworn. His  evidence referred to a time about a week later.    _Att._ Now, child, don't be frighted: there is no one here will hurt you  if you speak the truth.    _L.C.J._ Ay, if he speak the truth. But remember, child, thou art in the  presence of the great God of heaven and earth, that hath the keys of  hell, and of us that are the king's officers, and have the keys of  Newgate; and remember, too, there is a man's life in question; and if  thou tellest a lie, and by that means he comes to an ill end, thou art no  better than his murderer; and so speak the truth.    _Att._ Tell the jury what you know, and speak out. Where were you on the  evening of the 23rd of May last?    _L.C.J._ Why, what does such a boy as this know of days. Can you mark the  day, boy?    _W._ Yes, my lord, it was the day before our feast, and I was to spend  sixpence there, and that falls a month before Midsummer Day.    _One of the Jury._ My lord, we cannot hear what he says.    _L.C.J._ He says he remembers the day because it was the day before the  feast they had there, and he had sixpence to lay out. Set him up on the  table there. Well, child, and where wast thou then?    _W._ Keeping cows on the moor, my lord.    But, the boy using the country speech, my lord could not well apprehend  him, and so asked if there was anyone that could interpret him, and it  was answered the parson of the parish was there, and he was accordingly  sworn and so the evidence given. The boy said:    'I was on the moor about six o'clock, and sitting behind a bush of furze  near a pond of water: and the prisoner came very cautiously and looking  about him, having something like a long pole in his hand, and stopped a  good while as if he would be listening, and then began to feel in the  water with the pole: and I being very near the water--not above five  yards--heard as if the pole struck up against something that made a  wallowing sound, and the prisoner dropped the pole and threw himself on  the ground, and rolled himself about very strangely with his hands to his  ears, and so after a while got up and went creeping away.'    Asked if he had had any communication with the prisoner, 'Yes, a day or  two before, the prisoner, hearing I was used to be on the moor, he asked  me if I had seen a knife laying about, and said he would give sixpence to  find it. And I said I had not seen any such thing, but I would ask about.  Then he said he would give me sixpence to say nothing, and so he did.'    _L.C.J._ And was that the sixpence you were to lay out at the feast?    _W._ Yes, if you please, my lord.    Asked if he had observed anything particular as to the pond of water, he  said, 'No, except that it begun to have a very ill smell and the cows  would not drink of it for some days before.'    Asked if he had ever seen the prisoner and Ann Clark in company together,  he began to cry very much, and it was a long time before they could get  him to speak intelligibly. At last the parson of the parish, Mr Matthews,  got him to be quiet, and the question being put to him again, he said he  had seen Ann Clark waiting on the moor for the prisoner at some way off,  several times since last Christmas.    _Att._ Did you see her close, so as to be sure it was she?    _W._ Yes, quite sure.    _L.C.J._ How quite sure, child?    _W._ Because she would stand and jump up and down and clap her arms like  a goose [which he called by some country name: but the parson explained  it to be a goose]. And then she was of such a shape that it could not be  no one else.    _Att._ What was the last time that you so saw her?    Then the witness began to cry again and clung very much to Mr Matthews,  who bid him not be frightened.  And so at last he told this story: that on the day before their feast  (being the same evening that he had before spoken of) after the prisoner  had gone away, it being then twilight and he very desirous to get home,  but afraid for the present to stir from where he was lest the prisoner  should see him, remained some few minutes behind the bush, looking on the  pond, and saw something dark come up out of the water at the edge of the  pond farthest away from him, and so up the bank. And when it got to the  top where he could see it plain against the sky, it stood up and flapped  the arms up and down, and then run off very swiftly in the same direction  the prisoner had taken: and being asked very strictly who he took it to  be, he said upon his oath that it could be nobody but Ann Clark.    Thereafter his master was called, and gave evidence that the boy had come  home very late that evening and been chided for it, and that he seemed  very much amazed, but could give no account of the reason.    _Att._ My lord, we have done with our evidence for the King.    Then the Lord Chief Justice called upon the prisoner to make his defence;  which he did, though at no great length, and in a very halting way,  saying that he hoped the jury would not go about to take his life on the  evidence of a parcel of country people and children that would believe  any idle tale; and that he had been very much prejudiced in his trial; at  which the L.C.J. interrupted him, saying that he had had singular favour  shown to him in having his trial removed from Exeter, which the prisoner  acknowledging, said that he meant rather that since he was brought to  London there had not been care taken to keep him secured from  interruption and disturbance. Upon which the L.C.J. ordered the Marshal  to be called, and questioned him about the safe keeping of the prisoner,  but could find nothing: except the Marshal said that he had been informed  by the underkeeper that they had seen a person outside his door or going  up the stairs to it: but there was no possibility the person should have  got in. And it being inquired further what sort of person this might be,  the Marshal could not speak to it save by hearsay, which was not allowed.  And the prisoner, being asked if this was what he meant, said no, he knew  nothing of that, but it was very hard that a man should not be suffered  to be at quiet when his life stood on it. But it was observed he was very  hasty in his denial. And so he said no more, and called no witnesses.  Whereupon the Attorney-General spoke to the jury.
