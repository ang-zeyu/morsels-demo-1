The youngest of the four brothers, Karl Wilhelm Friedrich v. Bismarck,  had retired from the army at an early age: he was a quiet, kindly man of  domestic tastes; on the division of the estates, Schoenhausen fell to  his lot, and he settled down there to a quiet country life. He took a  step which must have caused much discussion among all his friends and  relations, for he chose as wife not one of his own rank, not a Kleist,  or a Katte, or a Bredow, or an Arnim, or an Alvensleben, or any other of  the neighbouring nobility; he married a simple Fraeulein Mencken. She  was, however, of no undistinguished origin. Her father, the son of a  professor at the University of Leipzig, had entered the Prussian Civil  Service; there he had risen to the highest rank and had been Cabinet  Secretary to both Frederick William II. and Frederick III. He was a man  of high character and of considerable ability; as was not uncommon among  the officials of those days, he was strongly affected by the liberal and  even revolutionary doctrines of France.    Fraeulein Mencken, who was married at the age of sixteen, was a clever  and ambitious woman. From her her son inherited his intellect; from  his father he derived what the Germans call _Gemueth_, geniality,  kindliness, humour. By his two parents he was thus connected with the  double foundation on which Prussia had been built: on his father's side  he had sprung from the fighting nobles; on his mother's, from the  scholars and officials. In later life we shall find that while his  prejudices and affections are all enlisted on the side of the noble,  the keen and critical intellect he had inherited from his mother enabled  him to overcome the prejudices of his order.    The early life of the young pair was not altogether fortunate. Several  children died at a very early age; the defeat of Prussia brought foreign  occupation; Schoenhausen was seized by French troopers; the marks of  their swords are still to be seen in a beam over one of the doors, and  Rittmeister v. Bismarck had to take his wife away into the woods in  order to escape their violence.    Of all the children of the marriage only three lived: Bernhard, who was  born in 1810, Otto, and one sister, Malvina, born in 1827.    Otto did not live at Schoenhausen long; when he was only a year old, his  father moved to Pomerania and settled on the estates Kniephof and Kulz,  which had come into the family on his grandfather's marriage. Pomerania  was at that time a favourite residence among the Prussian nobility; the  country was better wooded than the Mark, and game more plentiful; the  rich meadows, the wide heaths and forests were more attractive than the  heavy corn-lands and the sandy wastes of the older province. Here, in  the deep seclusion of country life, the boy passed his first years; it  was far removed from the bustle and turmoil of civilisation. Naugard,  the nearest town, was five miles distant; communication was bad, for it  was not till after 1815 that the Prussian Government began to construct  highroads. In this distant province, life went on as in the olden days,  little altered by the changes which had transformed the State. The  greater portion of the land belonged to large proprietors; the noble as  in old days was still all-powerful on his own estate; in his hands was  the administration of the law, and it was at his manorial court that men  had to seek for justice, a court where justice was dealt not in the name  of the King but of the Lord of the Manor. He lived among his people and  generally he farmed his own lands. There was little of the luxury of an  English country-house or the refinement of the French noblesse; he would  be up at daybreak to superintend the work in the fields, his wife and  daughters that of the household, talking to the peasants the pleasant  _Platt Deutsch_ of the countryside. Then there would be long rides or  drives to the neighbours' houses; shooting, for there was plenty of deer  and hares; and occasionally in the winter a visit to Berlin; farther  away, few of them went. Most of the country gentlemen had been to Paris,  but only as conquerors at the end of the great war.    They were little disturbed by modern political theories, but were  contented, as in old days, to be governed by the King. It was a  religious society; among the peasants and the nobles, if not among the  clergy, there still lingered something of the simple but profound faith  of German Protestantism; they were scarcely touched by the rationalism  of the eighteenth or by the liberalism of the nineteenth century; there  was little pomp and ceremony of worship in the village church, but the  natural periods of human life--birth, marriage, death--called for the  blessing of the Church, and once or twice a year came the solemn  confession and the sacrament. Religious belief and political faith were  closely joined, for the Church was but a department of the State; the  King was chief bishop, as he was general of the army, and the sanctity  of the Church was transferred to the Crown; to the nobles and peasants,  criticism of, or opposition to, the King had in it something of  sacrilege; the words \"by the Grace of God\" added to the royal title were  more than an empty phrase. Society was still organised on the old  patriarchal basis: at the bottom was the peasant; above him was the  _gnaediger Herr_; above him, _Unser allergnaedigste Herr_, the King, who  lived in Berlin; and above him, the _Herr Gott_ in Heaven.    To the inhabitants of South Germany, and the men of the towns, these  nobles of Further Pomerania, the _Junker_ as they were called, with  their feudal life, their medieval beliefs, their simple monarchism, were  the incarnation of political folly; to them liberalism seemed another  form of atheism, but in this solitude and fresh air of the great plain  was reared a race of men who would always be ready, as their fathers had  been, to draw their sword and go out to conquer new provinces for their  King to govern.          CHAPTER II.    EARLY LIFE.    1821-1847.      Of the boy's early life we know little. His mother was ambitious for her  sons; Otto from his early years she designed for the Diplomatic Service;  she seems to have been one of those women who was willing to sacrifice  the present happiness of her children for their future advancement. When  only six years old the boy was sent away from home to a school in  Berlin. He was not happy there; he pined for the free life of the  country, the fields and woods and animals; when he saw a plough he would  burst into tears, for it reminded him of his home. The discipline of the  school was hard, not with the healthy and natural hardships of life in  the open air, but with an artificial Spartanism, for it was the time  when the Germans, who had suddenly awoke to feelings of patriotism and a  love of war to which they had long been strangers, under the influence  of a few writers, were throwing all their energies into the cultivation  of physical endurance. It was probably at this time that there was laid  the foundation of that dislike for the city of Berlin which Bismarck  never quite overcame; and from his earliest years he was prejudiced  against the exaggerated and affected Teutonism which was the fashion  after the great war. A few years later his parents came to live  altogether in the town; then the boy passed on to the Gymnasium,  boarding in the house of one of the masters. The teaching in this school  was supplemented by private tutors, and he learned at this time the  facility in the use of the English and French languages which in after  years was to be of great service to him. The education at school was of  course chiefly in the classical languages; he acquired a sufficient  mastery of Latin. There is no evidence that in later life he continued  the study of classical literature. In his seventeenth year he passed the  Abiturienten examination, which admitted him as a student to the  university and entitled him to the privilege of serving in the army for  one instead of three years. His leaving certificate tells us that his  conduct and demeanour towards his comrades and teachers were admirable,  his abilities considerable, and his diligence fair.    The next year he passed in the ordinary course to the university,  entering at Goettingen; the choice was probably made because of the  celebrity which that university had acquired in law and history. It is  said that he desired to enter at Heidelberg, but his mother refused her  permission, because she feared that he would learn those habits of  beer-drinking in which the students of that ancient seat of learning  have gained so great a proficiency; it was, however, an art which, as  he found, was to be acquired with equal ease at Goettingen. The young  Bismarck was at this time over six feet high, slim and well built, of  great physical strength and agility, a good fencer, a bold rider, an  admirable swimmer and runner, a very agreeable companion; frank,  cheerful, and open-hearted, without fear either of his comrades or of  his teachers. He devoted his time at Goettingen less to learning than to  social life; in his second term he entered the Corps of the Hanoverians  and was quickly noted for his power of drinking and fighting; he is  reported to have fought twenty-six duels and was only wounded once, and  that wound was caused by the breaking of his opponent's foil. He was  full of wild escapades, for which he was often subjected to the ordinary  punishments of the university.    To many Germans, their years at the university have been the  turning-point of their life; but it was not so with Bismarck. To those  who have been brought up in the narrow surroundings of civic life,  student days form the single breath of freedom between the discipline of  a school and the drudgery of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12406"],[0,"Kepler (#3)"],[1,"the worlds, and could not  therefore account for it. He next tried an ingenious idea, comparing the  perpendiculars from different points of a quadrant of a circle on a  tangent at its extremity. The greatest of these, the tangent, not being  cut by the quadrant, he called the line of the sun, and associated with  infinite force. The shortest, being the point at the other end of the  quadrant, thus corresponded to the fixed stars or zero force;  intermediate ones were to be found proportional to the \"forces\" of the  six planets. After a great amount of unfinished trial calculations,  which took nearly a whole summer, he convinced himself that success did  not lie that way. In July, 1595, while lecturing on the great planetary  conjunctions, he drew quasi-triangles in a circular zodiac showing the  slow progression of these points of conjunction at intervals of just  over 240 deg. or eight signs. The successive chords marked out a smaller  circle to which they were tangents, about half the diameter of the  zodiacal circle as drawn, and Kepler at once saw a similarity to the  orbits of Saturn and Jupiter, the radius of the inscribed circle of an  equilateral triangle being half that of the circumscribed circle. His  natural sequence of ideas impelled him to try a square, in the hope that  the circumscribed and inscribed circles might give him a similar  \"analogy\" for the orbits of Jupiter and Mars. He next tried a pentagon  and so on, but he soon noted that he would never reach the sun that way,  nor would he find any such limitation as six, the number of \"possibles\"  being obviously infinite. The actual planets moreover were not even six  but only five, so far as he knew, so he next pondered the question of  what sort of things these could be of which only five different figures  were possible and suddenly thought of the five regular solids.[2] He  immediately pounced upon this idea and ultimately evolved the following  scheme. \"The earth is the sphere, the measure of all; round it describe  a dodecahedron; the sphere including this will be Mars. Round Mars  describe a tetrahedron; the sphere including this will be Jupiter.  Describe a cube round Jupiter; the sphere including this will be Saturn.  Now, inscribe in the earth an icosahedron, the sphere inscribed in it  will be Venus: inscribe an octahedron in Venus: the circle inscribed in  it will be Mercury.\" With this result Kepler was inordinately pleased,  and regretted not a moment of the time spent in obtaining it, though to  us this \"Mysterium Cosmographicum\" can only appear useless, even without  the more recent additions to the known planets. He admitted that a  certain thickness must be assigned to the intervening spheres to cover  the greatest and least distances of the several planets from the sun,  but even then some of the numbers obtained are not a very close fit for  the corresponding planetary orbits. Kepler's own suggested explanation  of the discordances was that they must be due to erroneous measures of  the planetary distances, and this, in those days of crude and infrequent  observations, could not easily be disproved. He next thought of a  variety of reasons why the five regular solids should occur in precisely  the order given and in no other, diverging from this into a subtle and  not very intelligible process of reasoning to account for the division  of the zodiac into 360 deg.. The next subject was more important, and dealt  with the relation between the distances of the planets and their times  of revolution round the sun. It was obvious that the period was not  simply proportional to the distance, as the outer planets were all too  slow for this, and he concluded \"either that the moving intelligences of  the planets are weakest in those that are farthest from the sun, or that  there is one moving intelligence in the sun, the common centre, forcing  them all round, but those most violently which are nearest, and that it  languishes in some sort and grows weaker at the most distant, because of  the remoteness and the attenuation of the virtue\". This is not so near a  guess at the theory of gravitation as might be supposed, for Kepler  imagined that a repulsive force was necessary to account for the planets  being sometimes further from the sun, and so laid aside the idea of a  constant attractive force. He made several other attempts to find a law  connecting the distances and periods of the planets, but without success  at that time, and only desisted when by unconsciously arguing in a  circle he appeared to get the same result from two totally different  hypotheses. He sent copies of his book to several leading astronomers,  of whom Galileo praised his ingenuity and good faith, while Tycho Brahe  was evidently much struck with the work and advised him to adapt  something similar to the Tychonic system instead of the Copernican. He  also intimated that his Uraniborg observations would provide more  accurate determinations of the planetary orbits, and thus made Kepler  eager to visit him, a project which as we shall see was more than  fulfilled. Another copy of the book Kepler sent to Reymers the Imperial  astronomer with a most fulsome letter, which Tycho, who asserted that  Reymers had simply plagiarised his work, very strongly resented, thus  drawing from Kepler a long letter of apology. About the same time Kepler  had married a lady already twice widowed, and become involved in  difficulties with her relatives on financial grounds, and with the  Styrian authorities in connection with the religious disputes then  coming to a head. On account of these latter he thought it expedient,  the year after his marriage, to withdraw to Hungary, from whence he sent  short treatises to Tuebingen, \"On the magnet\" (following the ideas of  Gilbert of Colchester), \"On the cause of the obliquity of the ecliptic\"  and \"On the Divine wisdom as shown in the Creation\". His next important  step makes it desirable to devote a chapter to a short notice of Tycho  Brahe.    [Footnote 2: Since the sum of the plane angles at a corner of a regular  solid must be less than four right angles, it is easily seen that few  regular solids are possible. Hexagonal faces are clearly impossible, or  any polygonal faces with more than five sides. The possible forms are  the dodecahedron with twelve pentagonal faces, three meeting at each  corner; the cube, six square faces, three meeting at each corner; and  three figures with triangular faces, the tetrahedron of four faces,  three meeting at each corner; the octahedron of eight faces, four  meeting at each corner; and the icosahedron of twenty faces, five  meeting at each corner.]              CHAPTER III.    TYCHO BRAHE.        The age following that of Copernicus produced three outstanding figures  associated with the science of astronomy, then reaching the close of  what Professor Forbes so aptly styles the geometrical period. These  three Sir David Brewster has termed \"Martyrs of Science\"; Galileo, the  great Italian philosopher, has his own place among the \"Pioneers of  Science\"; and invaluable though Tycho Brahe's work was, the latter can  hardly be claimed as a pioneer in the same sense as the other two.  Nevertheless, Kepler, the third member of the trio, could not have made  his most valuable discoveries without Tycho's observations.    Of noble family, born a twin on 14th December, 1546, at Knudstrup in  Scania (the southernmost part of Sweden, then forming part of the  kingdom of Denmark), Tycho was kidnapped a year later by a childless  uncle. This uncle brought him up as his own son, provided him at the age  of seven with a tutor, and sent him in 1559 to the University of  Copenhagen, to study for a political career by taking courses in  rhetoric and philosophy. On 21st August, 1560, however, a solar eclipse  took place, total in Portugal, and therefore of small proportions in  Denmark, and Tycho's keen interest was awakened, not so much by the  phenomenon, as by the fact that it had occurred according to prediction.  Soon afterwards he purchased an edition of Ptolemy in order to read up  the subject of astronomy, to which, and to mathematics, he devoted most  of the remainder of his three years' course at Copenhagen. His uncle  next sent him to Leipzig to study law, but he managed to continue his  astronomical researches. He obtained the Alphonsine and the new Prutenic  Tables, but soon found that the latter, though more accurate than the  former, failed to represent the true positions of the planets, and  grasped the fact that continuous observation was essential in order to  determine the true motions. He began by observing a conjunction of  Jupiter and Saturn in August, 1563, and found the Prutenic Tables  several days in error, and the Alphonsine a whole month. He provided  himself with a cross-staff for determining the angular distance between  stars or other objects, and, finding the divisions of the scale  inaccurate, constructed a table of corrections, an improvement that  seems to have been a decided innovation, the previous practice having  been to use the best available instrument and ignore its errors. About  this time war broke out between Denmark and Sweden, and Tycho returned  to his uncle, who was vice-admiral and attached to the king's suite. The  uncle died in the following month, and early in the next year Tycho went  abroad again, this time to Wittenberg. After five months, however, an  outbreak of plague drove him away, and he matriculated at Rostock, where  he found little astronomy but a good deal of astrology. While there he  fought a duel in the dark and lost part of his nose, which he replaced  by a composition of gold and silver. He carried on regular observations  with his cross-staff and persevered with his astronomical studies in  spite of the objections and want of sympathy of his fellow-countrymen.  The King of Denmark, however, having a higher opinion of the value of"]]]
