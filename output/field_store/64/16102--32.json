Stoical though he was, his dark eyes flashed with pleasure at the  unanimous call of the children, but, Indianlike, it would have been a great  breach of manners if he had let his delight be known. Then, again,  Indianlike, it would never have done to have seemed to be in a hurry. The  Indian children well knew this, but who ever heard of white children that  could sit like statues, grave and dignified, while the story-teller took  time to finish smoking a large pipe of tobacco?    So it was in this case. In their wild excitement and eagerness to have the  story begin, both Sagastao and Minnehaha sprang up and, rushing toward  Souwanas, vied with each other in seeing which could first pluck the  half-smoked calumet from his mouth. Such audacity appalled the Indian  children and fairly took the breath away from the older Indians. For was  not Souwanas a chief, and the calumet almost a sacred thing while between  his lips?    Souwanas, however, was greatly delighted. Here was a new experience, and  the very boldness of the children of the palefaces was an evidence of their  unbounded confidence and love. To little Sagastao the calumet was  surrendered, and, with the children cuddled around him, Souwanas began his  story:    [Illustration: \"With the children cuddled around him Souwanas began his  story.\"]    \"Now, you must know that Nanahboozhoo was a queer fellow. He could make  himself as tall as a tree or as small as a turtle or snake. Nothing could  kill him. He could not be drowned even if dropped hundreds of feet into  the lake, nor burned to death even if he tumbled into the fire. He often  met with accidents, but he always came up right again and was ready for  some other adventure in some new shape. He has left his marks on the rocks  and trees, leaves and flowers. Almost anywhere we look we see signs that  Nanahboozhoo has been around. As his temper was very uncertain he sometimes  caused trouble and injured the appearance of things which were once more  beautiful than they are now. But in general he was the friend of our race  and worked changes that were for our good.    \"One day, as Nanahboozhoo was walking along on a sandy shore, he felt very  hungry. It was now in the autumn of the year. As he wandered on he saw an  object moving toward him. He had not long to wait before he saw that this  object was a great black bear. He pulled up a young tree by the roots and  hid himself, preparing to kill the bear when he should come near. When the  bear came near Nanahboozhoo made a big jump out of his hiding place and  killed the bear with one blow. Then he built a big fire, and having singed  all the hair off the bear he cut him up and nicely roasted him. When the  meat was cooked Nanahboozhoo cut it up into fine pieces, for he intended to  enjoy his feast by eating leisurely.    \"While he was thus busy preparing his feast he was annoyed by a strange  sound among the tree tops that rubbed together when the wind blew.  Nanahboozhoo was very quick-tempered, and as the noise continued he  determined to stop it. So he left his feast on the ground and climbed away  up one of those trees to the spot where the other pressed against it. He  was endeavoring to pull the two great trees apart when one of his hands got  caught between them and was firmly held. While struggling to get loose he  heard a pack of wolves running toward his bear meat. This made him struggle  the harder to get his hand free. The fierce wolves soon scented the food  and had a good time devouring it, in spite of the shoutings of  Nanahboozhoo.    \"When Nanahboozhoo at length got his hand free and came down he found  nothing left of his feast but the skull of the bear. He was very angry, not  only at the wolves that had eaten his feast but also at the trees that had  held him, the great Nanahboozhoo, in so tight a grip. As the wolves had run  away he could not, at present, punish them, but he resolved that he would  so punish these great birch trees that they would never give him such a  squeeze again. So he prepared a great whip and with it he severely thrashed  the trees. Up to this time the birch had been the most beautiful of trees.  Its great trunk was of the purest white, without any blemish or blotch upon  it. But ever since the thrashing Nanahboozhoo gave it it has had to carry  the marks of that terrible whipping; and that is why the white birch tree  is so covered with scars.    \"When Nanahboozhoo had ceased thrashing the trees he found himself so very  hungry that he resolved to eat the brains that were in the head of the  bear, that had been overlooked by the wolves. However, he found the skull  very hard. So he transformed himself into a little snake, and in this way  got inside of the bear's skull and enjoyed his feast. In fact he enjoyed it  too much, for when he was through with his eating he could not get out of  the skull, he was so full. However, he was able to roll along, skull and  all, but as he could not see where he was going he bumped along in a very  erratic manner until at length he tumbled into a big lake and sank at first  deep down under the waves.    \"When he came up to the surface he just put a part of the head of the bear  out of the water, as does the bear when swimming. Then he listened  intently. It was not long before Nanahboozhoo heard voices saying:    \"'Look! There is a bear swimming. Let us kill him.\"    \"So there was a chase on the lake, and it was not long before the Indians  came up, in their canoe, and one of them with his stone ax struck the  bear's head such a blow that he split open the skull.    \"This just suited Nanahboozhoo, and instantly he sprang out and made for  the shore.    \"Then Nanahboozhoo journeyed on and again he began to feel very hungry. The  brains of the bear were not much to one who had had his mind set on eating  the whole carcass. It was not long before he met the raccoon awkwardly  carrying a birch _rogan_ that he had stolen from a couple of blind men.  Seeing the merry smile on the raccoon's face, Nanahboozhoo bade him a good  day, and asked him what was amusing him.    \"The raccoon, who did not know that it was Nanahboozhoo with whom he was  talking, told him how he obtained the dish. When Nanahboozhoo heard this he  was very angry at the raccoon for his heartless trick.    \"It seems that there was quite a large settlement of people who had among  them a couple of blind men. As these Indians were hunters they had to be on  the move a good deal of the time following the game. As the other people  were kind-hearted, instead of killing these old blind men, now that they  were unable to hunt, they arranged for them a wigwam in a safe, quiet  place, near the lake. Then they gave them a kettle and bowl and other  necessary things and cut a large pile of wood and placed it close at hand.  In order that they might be able to get water for their cooking and yet not  stumble into the water their friends fastened a rope, for their guidance,  from the door of the wigwam to a post on the edge of the lake.    \"The old men were now quite comfortable. Their friends came frequently with  abundant supplies of food and the blind men were able to do their own work  and were happy together. They divided the day's work so that one day one  would be the cook while the other would bring in the wood and go for the  water. Next day they would change about. It gave each enough to do, and not  too much.    \"For a long time the two men lived contented and happy. But it happened  that one day the raccoon was out prowling along the shore, looking for  something to eat, when he happened to find the end of the rope that was  tied to the post at the water's edge.    \"Now you must know,\" said Souwanas, \"that, next to the wolverine, the  raccoon is the biggest mischief in the woods. He is full of tricks, but he  is very cunning and suspicious. So before he interfered with the rope he  cautiously followed it up and found that its other end was at the wigwam of  these two old blind men. Hearing no noise, he cautiously peered into the  wigwam and saw them both sleeping near the fire. There was a smell of  something good to eat, and the raccoon decided to wait around to see if he  could not get hold of it.    \"While he was thus waiting the old men woke up, and one said to the other,  'My brother, I am feeling hungry; let us prepare our dinner.'    \"'Very well,' said the other; 'it is your turn to go to the lake for water  while I make the fire.'    \"When the raccoon heard this he ran down to the lake and quickly untied the  rope from the stake and, drawing it back, tied it to a clump of bushes on  the land. When the old man with the kettle felt his way along the rope  until he reached its end he tried to dip up the water as usual, but all in  vain. There was nothing but the dry earth and bushes. Not finding any water  he returned to his brother with the sad news that the lake had dried up,  and that already bushes were growing where yesterday there was plenty of  water. When his brother heard this doleful story he laughed at it, and  said:    \"'Why, that cannot be possible. No bushes could grow up in such a short  time.'    \"However his brother declared it was the case, and so the other one said,  'Well, let me go, and see if I can find some water.'    \"When the tricky raccoon heard this he hurried back and at once untied the  rope from the bushes and refastened it to the post near the water. When the  second brother came along he easily found the water, and filling the kettle  he returned to the wigwam where he vigorously accused his brother of lying.

He was alone with Defago in a primitive world: that was all. The canoe,  another symbol of man's ascendancy, was now to be left behind. Those  small yellow patches, made on the trees by the axe, were the only  indications of its hiding place.    Meanwhile, shouldering the packs between them, each man carrying his own  rifle, they followed the slender trail over rocks and fallen trunks and  across half-frozen swamps; skirting numerous lakes that fairly gemmed  the forest, their borders fringed with mist; and towards five o'clock  found themselves suddenly on the edge of the woods, looking out across a  large sheet of water in front of them, dotted with pine-clad islands of  all describable shapes and sizes.    \"Fifty Island Water,\" announced Defago wearily, \"and the sun jest goin'  to dip his bald old head into it!\" he added, with unconscious poetry;  and immediately they set about pitching camp for the night.    In a very few minutes, under those skilful hands that never made a  movement too much or a movement too little, the silk tent stood taut and  cozy, the beds of balsam boughs ready laid, and a brisk cooking fire  burned with the minimum of smoke. While the young Scotchman cleaned the  fish they had caught trolling behind the canoe, Defago \"guessed\" he  would \"jest as soon\" take a turn through the Bush for indications of  moose. \"_May_ come across a trunk where they bin and rubbed horns,\" he  said, as he moved off, \"or feedin' on the last of the maple leaves\"--and  he was gone.    His small figure melted away like a shadow in the dusk, while Simpson  noted with a kind of admiration how easily the forest absorbed him into  herself. A few steps, it seemed, and he was no longer visible.    Yet there was little underbrush hereabouts; the trees stood somewhat  apart, well spaced; and in the clearings grew silver birch and maple,  spearlike and slender, against the immense stems of spruce and hemlock.  But for occasional prostrate monsters, and the boulders of grey rock  that thrust uncouth shoulders here and there out of the ground, it might  well have been a bit of park in the Old Country. Almost, one might have  seen in it the hand of man. A little to the right, however, began the  great burnt section, miles in extent, proclaiming its real  character--_brule_, as it is called, where the fires of the previous  year had raged for weeks, and the blackened stumps now rose gaunt and  ugly, bereft of branches, like gigantic match heads stuck into the  ground, savage and desolate beyond words. The perfume of charcoal and  rain-soaked ashes still hung faintly about it.    The dusk rapidly deepened; the glades grew dark; the crackling of the  fire and the wash of little waves along the rocky lake shore were the  only sounds audible. The wind had dropped with the sun, and in all that  vast world of branches nothing stirred. Any moment, it seemed, the  woodland gods, who are to be worshipped in silence and loneliness, might  stretch their mighty and terrific outlines among the trees. In front,  through doorways pillared by huge straight stems, lay the stretch of  Fifty Island Water, a crescent-shaped lake some fifteen miles from tip  to tip, and perhaps five miles across where they were camped. A sky of  rose and saffron, more clear than any atmosphere Simpson had ever  known, still dropped its pale streaming fires across the waves, where  the islands--a hundred, surely, rather than fifty--floated like the  fairy barques of some enchanted fleet. Fringed with pines, whose crests  fingered most delicately the sky, they almost seemed to move upwards as  the light faded--about to weigh anchor and navigate the pathways of the  heavens instead of the currents of their native and desolate lake.    And strips of colored cloud, like flaunting pennons, signaled their  departure to the stars....    The beauty of the scene was strangely uplifting. Simpson smoked the fish  and burnt his fingers into the bargain in his efforts to enjoy it and at  the same time tend the frying pan and the fire. Yet, ever at the back of  his thoughts, lay that other aspect of the wilderness: the indifference  to human life, the merciless spirit of desolation which took no note of  man. The sense of his utter loneliness, now that even Defago had gone,  came close as he looked about him and listened for the sound of his  companion's returning footsteps.    There was pleasure in the sensation, yet with it a perfectly  comprehensible alarm. And instinctively the thought stirred in him:  \"What should I--_could_ I, do--if anything happened and he did not come  back--?\"    They enjoyed their well-earned supper, eating untold quantities of fish,  and drinking unmilked tea strong enough to kill men who had not covered  thirty miles of hard \"going,\" eating little on the way. And when it was  over, they smoked and told stories round the blazing fire, laughing,  stretching weary limbs, and discussing plans for the morrow. Defago was  in excellent spirits, though disappointed at having no signs of moose to  report. But it was dark and he had not gone far. The _brule_, too, was  bad. His clothes and hands were smeared with charcoal. Simpson, watching  him, realized with renewed vividness their position--alone together in  the wilderness.    \"Defago,\" he said presently, \"these woods, you know, are a bit too big  to feel quite at home in--to feel comfortable in, I mean!... Eh?\" He  merely gave expression to the mood of the moment; he was hardly prepared  for the earnestness, the solemnity even, with which the guide took him  up.    \"You've hit it right, Simpson, boss,\" he replied, fixing his searching  brown eyes on his face, \"and that's the truth, sure. There's no end to  'em--no end at all.\" Then he added in a lowered tone as if to himself,  \"There's lots found out _that_, and gone plumb to pieces!\"    But the man's gravity of manner was not quite to the other's liking; it  was a little too suggestive for this scenery and setting; he was sorry  he had broached the subject. He remembered suddenly how his uncle had  told him that men were sometimes stricken with a strange fever of the  wilderness, when the seduction of the uninhabited wastes caught them so  fiercely that they went forth, half fascinated, half deluded, to their  death. And he had a shrewd idea that his companion held something in  sympathy with that queer type. He led the conversation on to other  topics, on to Hank and the doctor, for instance, and the natural rivalry  as to who should get the first sight of moose.    \"If they went doo west,\" observed Defago carelessly, \"there's sixty  miles between us now--with ole Punk at halfway house eatin' himself full  to bustin' with fish and coffee.\" They laughed together over the  picture. But the casual mention of those sixty miles again made Simpson  realize the prodigious scale of this land where they hunted; sixty miles  was a mere step; two hundred little more than a step. Stories of lost  hunters rose persistently before his memory. The passion and mystery of  homeless and wandering men, seduced by the beauty of great forests,  swept his soul in a way too vivid to be quite pleasant. He wondered  vaguely whether it was the mood of his companion that invited the  unwelcome suggestion with such persistence.    \"Sing us a song, Defago, if you're not too tired,\" he asked; \"one of  those old _voyageur_ songs you sang the other night.\" He handed his  tobacco pouch to the guide and then filled his own pipe, while the  Canadian, nothing loth, sent his light voice across the lake in one of  those plaintive, almost melancholy chanties with which lumbermen and  trappers lessen the burden of their labor. There was an appealing and  romantic flavor about it, something that recalled the atmosphere of the  old pioneer days when Indians and wilderness were leagued together,  battles frequent, and the Old Country farther off than it is today. The  sound traveled pleasantly over the water, but the forest at their backs  seemed to swallow it down with a single gulp that permitted neither echo  nor resonance.    It was in the middle of the third verse that Simpson noticed something  unusual--something that brought his thoughts back with a rush from  faraway scenes. A curious change had come into the man's voice. Even  before he knew what it was, uneasiness caught him, and looking up  quickly, he saw that Defago, though still singing, was peering about him  into the Bush, as though he heard or saw something. His voice grew  fainter--dropped to a hush--then ceased altogether. The same instant,  with a movement amazingly alert, he started to his feet and stood  upright--_sniffing the air_. Like a dog scenting game, he drew the air  into his nostrils in short, sharp breaths, turning quickly as he did so  in all directions, and finally \"pointing\" down the lake shore,  eastwards. It was a performance unpleasantly suggestive and at the same  time singularly dramatic. Simpson's heart fluttered disagreeably as he  watched it.    \"Lord, man! How you made me jump!\" he exclaimed, on his feet beside him  the same instant, and peering over his shoulder into the sea of  darkness. \"What's up? Are you frightened--?\"    Even before the question was out of his mouth he knew it was foolish,  for any man with a pair of eyes in his head could see that the Canadian  had turned white down to his very gills. Not even sunburn and the glare  of the fire could hide that.    The student felt himself trembling a little, weakish in the knees.  \"What's up?\" he repeated quickly. \"D'you smell moose? Or anything queer,  anything--wrong?\" He lowered his voice instinctively.    The forest pressed round them with its encircling wall; the nearer tree  stems gleamed like bronze in the firelight;"]]]
