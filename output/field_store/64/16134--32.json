And I may say here that if any one of my  readers should ever come by ship to the winding harbour where the  forts of the Portuguese crumble in infinite greenery, where the baobab  stands like a corpse here and there in the palms, if he goes ashore  where no one has any business to go, and where no one so far as I know  has gone from a liner before (though it's little more than a mile or  so from the pier), and if he finds a golden shrine, which is near  enough to the shore, and a five-inch diamond in it carved in the shape  of a god, it is better to leave it alone and get back safe to the ship  than to sell that diamond idol for any price in the world.    Ali Kareeb Ahash went into the golden shrine, and when he raised his  head from the seven obeisances that are the due of the idol, behold!  it glowed with such a lustre as only it wears after answering recent  prayer.  No native of those parts mistakes the tone of the idol, they  know its varying shades as a tracker knows blood; the moon was  streaming in through the open door and Ali saw it clearly.    No one had been that night but Boob Aheera.    The fury of Ali rose and surged to his heart, he clutched his knife  till the hilt of it bruised his hand, yet he did not utter the prayer  that he had made ready about Boob Aheera's liver, for he saw that Boob  Aheera's prayers were acceptable to the idol and knew that divine  protection was over his enemy.    What Boob Aheera's prayer was he did not know, but he went back to the  beach as fast as one can go through cacti and creepers that climb to  the tops of the palms; and as fast as his canoe could carry him he  went down the winding harbour, till the liner shone beside him as he  passed, and he heard the sound of its band rise up and die, and he  landed and came that night into Boob Aheera's hut.  And there he  offered himself as his enemy's slave, and Boob Aheera's slave he is to  this day, and his master has protection from the idol.  And Ali rows  to the liners and goes on board to sell rubies made of glass, and thin  suits for the tropics and ivory napkin rings, and Manchester kimonos,  and little lovely shells; and the passengers abuse him because of his  prices; and yet they should not, for all the money cheated by Ali  Kareeb Ahash goes to Boob Aheera, his master.          EAST AND WEST    It was dead of night and midwinter.  A frightful wind was bringing  sleet from the East.  The long sere grasses were wailing.  Two specks  of light appeared on the desolate plain; a man in a hansom cab was  driving alone in North China.    Alone with the driver and the dejected horse.  The driver wore a good  waterproof cape, and of course an oiled silk hat, but the man in the  cab wore nothing but evening dress.  He did not have the glass door  down because the horse fell so frequently, the sleet had put his cigar  out and it was too cold to sleep; the two lamps flared in the wind.  By the uncertain light of a candle lamp that flickered inside the cab,  a Manchu shepherd that saw the vehicle pass, where he watched his  sheep on the plain in fear of the wolves, for the first time saw  evening dress.  And though he saw if dimly, and what he saw was wet,  it was like a backward glance of a thousand years, for as his  civilization is so much older than ours they have presumably passed  through all that kind of thing.    He watched it stoically, not wondering at a new thing, if indeed it be  new to China, meditated on it awhile in a manner strange to us, and  when he had added to his philosophy what little could be derived from  the sight of this hansom cab, returned to his contemplation of that  night's chances of wolves and to such occasional thoughts as he drew  at times for his comfort out of the legends of China, that have been  preserved for such uses.  And on such a night their comfort was  greatly needed.  He thought of the legend of a dragon-lady, more fair  than the flowers are, without an equal amongst daughters of men,  humanly lovely to look on although her sire was a dragon, yet one who  traced his descent from gods of the elder days, and so it was that she  went in all her ways divine, like the earliest ones of her race, who  were holier than the emperor.    She had come down one day out of her little land, a grassy valley  hidden amongst the mountains; by the way of the mountain passes she  came down, and the rocks of the rugged pass rang like little bells  about her, as her bare feet went by, like silver bells to please her;  and the sound was like the sound of the dromedaries of a prince when  they come home at evening--their silver bells are ringing and the  village-folk are glad.  She had come down to pick the enchanted poppy  that grew, and grows to this day--if only men might find it--in a  field at the feet of the mountains; if one should pick it happiness  would come to all yellow men, victory without fighting, good wages,  and ceaseless ease.  She came down all fair from the mountains; and as  the legend pleasantly passed through his mind in the bitterest hour of  the night, which comes before dawn, two lights appeared and another  hansom went by.    The man in the second cab was dressed the same as the first, he was  wetter than the first, for the sleet had fallen all night, but evening  dress is evening dress all the world over.  The driver wore the same  oiled hat, the same waterproof cape as the other.  And when the cab  had passed the darkness swirled back where the two small lamps had  been, and the slush poured into the wheel-tracks and nothing remained  but the speculations of the shepherd to tell that a hansom cab had  been in that part of China; presently even these ceased, and he was  back with the early legends again in contemplation of serener things.    And the storm and the cold and the darkness made one last effort, and  shook the bones of that shepherd, and rattled the teeth in the head  that mused on the flowery fables, and suddenly it was morning.  You  saw the outlines of the sheep all of a sudden, the shepherd counted  them, no wolf had come, you could see them all quite clearly.  And in  the pale light of the earliest morning the third hansom appeared, with  its lamps still burning, looking ridiculous in the daylight. They came  out of the East with the sleet and were all going due westwards, and  the occupant of the third cab also wore evening dress.    Calmly that Manchu shepherd, without curiosity, still less with  wonder, but as one who would see whatever life has to show him, stood  for four hours to see if another would come.  The sleet and the East  wind continued.  And at the end of four hours another came.  The  driver was urging it on as fast as he could, as though he were making  the most of the daylight, his cabby's cape was flapping wildly about  him; inside the cab a man in evening dress was being jolted up and  down by the unevenness of the plain.    This was of course that famous race from Pittsburg to Piccadilly,  going round by the long way, that started one night after dinner from  Mr. Flagdrop's house, and was won by Mr. Kagg, driving the Honourable  Alfred Fortescue, whose father it will be remembered was Hagar  Dermstein, and became (by Letters Patent) Sir Edgar Fortescue, and  finally Lord St. George.    The Manchu shepherd stood there till evening, and when he saw that no  more cabs would come, turned homeward in search of food.    And the rice prepared for him was hot and good, all the more after the  bitter coldness of that sleet.  And when he had consumed it her  perused his experience, turning over again in his mind each detail of  the cabs he had seen; and from that his thoughts slipped calmly to the  glorious history of China, going back to the indecorous times before  calmness came, and beyond those times to the happy days of the earth  when the gods and dragons were here and China was young; and lighting  his opium pipe and casting his thoughts easily forward he looked to  the time when the dragons shall come again.    And for a long while then his mind reposed itself in such a dignified  calm that no thought stirred there at all, from which when he was  aroused he cast off his lethargy as a man emerges from the baths,  refreshed, cleansed and contented, and put away from his musings the  things he had seen on the plain as being evil and of the nature of  dreams, or futile illusion, the results of activity which troubleth  calm.  And then he turned his mind toward the shape of God, the One,  the Ineffable, who sits by the lotus lily, whose shape is the shape of  peace, and denieth activity, and went out his thanks to him that he  had cast all bad customs westward out of China as a woman throws  household dirt out of her basket far out into neighbouring gardens.    From thankfulness he turned to calm again, and out of calm to sleep.          A PRETTY QUARREL    On one of those unattained, and unattainable pinnacles that are known  as the Bleaks of Eerie, an eagle was looking East with a hopeful  presage of blood.    For he knew, and rejoiced in the knowledge, that eastward over the  dells the dwarfs were risen in Ulk, and gone to war with the  demi-gods.    The demi-gods are they that were born of earthly women, but their  sires are the elder gods who walked of old among men.  Disguised they  would go through the villages sometimes in summer evenings, cloaked  and unknown of men; but the younger maidens knew them and always ran  to them singing, for all that their elders said: in evenings long ago  they had danced to the woods of the oak-trees.  Their children dwelt  out-of-doors beyond the dells of the bracken, in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11462"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 14, No. 382, July (#3)"],[1,"Art in England, in the embellishment of  cathedrals, &c.; among which is the following notice of one of the  earliest of our attempts at historical portraiture which can be  authenticated:--    \"It is a Painting on Wood; the figures are less than life, and represent  Henry the Fifth and his relations. It measures four feet six inches  long, by four feet four inches high, and was in the days of Catholic  power the altarpiece of the church of Shene. An angel stands in the  centre, holding in his hands the expanding coverings of two tents, out  of which the king, with three princes, and the queen, with four  princesses, are proceeding to kneel at two altars, where crosses, and  sceptres, and books are lying. They wear long and flowing robes, with  loose hair, and have crowns on their heads. In the background, St.  George appears in the air, combating with the dragon, while Cleodelinda  kneels in prayer beside a lamb. It is not, indeed, quite certain that  this curious work was made during the reign of Henry the Fifth, but  there can be little doubt of its being painted as early as that of his  son.\"    In the next page we have the following character of an English artist of  about the same period:--    \"He was at once architect, sculptor, carpenter, goldsmith, armourer,  jeweller, saddler, tailor, and painter. There is extant, in Dugdale, a  curious example of the character of the times, and a scale by which we  can measure the public admiration of art. It is a contract between the  Earl of Warwick and John Rag, citizen and tailor, London, in which the  latter undertakes to execute the emblazonry of the earl's pageant in his  situation of ambassador to France. In the tailor's bill, gilded griffins  mingle with Virgin Marys; painted streamers for battle or procession,  with the twelve apostles; and 'one coat for his grace's body, lute with  fine gold,' takes precedence of St. George and the Dragon.\"    We wish some of the criticism in this chapter had been milder, and a few  of the invectives not so highly charged; some of them even out-Herod the  fury of an article on Painting, in a recent number of the _Edinburgh  Review_. But we must pass on to pleasanter matters--as the following  poetical paragraphs:--    \"The art of tapestry as well as the art of illuminating books, aided in  diffusing a love of painting over the island. It was carried to a high  degree of excellence. The earliest account of its appearance in England  is during the reign of Henry the Eighth, but there is no reason to doubt  that it was well known and in general esteem much earlier. The  traditional account, that we were instructed in it by the Saracens, has  probably some foundation. The ladies encouraged this manufacture by  working at it with their own hands; and the rich aided by purchasing it  in vast quantities whenever regular practitioners appeared in the  market. It found its way into church and palace--chamber and hall. It  served at once to cover and adorn cold and comfortless walls. It added  warmth, and, when snow was on the hill and ice in the stream, gave an  air of social snugness which has deserted some of our modern mansions.    \"At first the figures and groups, which rendered this manufacture  popular, were copies of favourite paintings; but, as taste improved and  skill increased, they showed more of originality in their conceptions,  if not more of nature in their forms. They exhibited, in common with all  other works of art, the mixed taste of the times--a grotesque union of  classical and Hebrew history--of martial life and pastoral repose--of  Greek gods and Romish saints. Absurd as such combinations certainly  were, and destitute of those beauties of form and delicate gradations  and harmony of colour which distinguish paintings worthily so  called--still when the hall was lighted up, and living faces thronged  the floor, the silent inhabitants of the walls would seem, in the eyes  of our ancestors, something very splendid. As painting rose in fame,  tapestry sunk in estimation. The introduction of a lighter and less  massive mode of architecture abridged the space for its accommodation,  and by degrees the stiff and fanciful creations of the loom vanished  from our walls. The art is now neglected. I am sorry for this, because I  cannot think meanly of an art which engaged the heads and hands of the  ladies of England, and gave to the tapestried hall of elder days fame  little inferior to what now waits on a gallery of paintings.\"    Passing over Holbein, Sir Antonio Moore, Vandyke, Lely, Kneller, and  Thornhill, we come to the lives of Hogarth--Wilson--Reynolds and  Gainsborough--from which we select a few characteristic anecdotes and  sketches. In noticing Hogarth's early life, Mr. Cunningham has thrown  some discredit on a book, which on its publication, made not a little  chat among artists:--    \"Of those early days I find this brief notice in Smith's Life of  Nollekens the sculptor. 'I have several times heard Mr. Nollekens  observe, that he had frequently seen Hogarth, when a young man, saunter  round Leicester Fields with his master's sickly child hanging its head  over his shoulder.' It is more amusing to read such a book than safe to  quote it. Hogarth had ceased to have a master for seventeen years, was  married to Jane Thornhill, kept his carriage, and was in the full blaze  of his reputation, when Nollekens was born.\"    Among Hogarth's early labours are his Illustrations of Hudibras,  published in 1726. These were seventeen plates; and we have lately seen  in the possession of Mr. Britton, the architect, eleven original  paintings illustrative of Butler's witty poem, and attributed to  Hogarth.    From the notices of Hogarth's portraits we select the following:--    \"Hogarth's Portrait of Henry Fielding, executed after death from  recollection, is remarkable as being the only likeness extant of the  prince of English novelists. It has various histories. According to  Murphy, Fielding had made many promises to sit to Hogarth, for whose  genius he had a high esteem, but died without fulfilling them; a lady  accidentally cut a profile with her scissars, which recalled Fielding's  face so completely to Hogarth's memory, that he took up the outline,  corrected and finished it and made a capital likeness. The world is  seldom satisfied with a common account of any thing that interests  it--more especially as a marvellous one is easily manufactured. The  following, then, is the second history. Garrick, having dressed himself  in a suit of Fielding's clothes, presented himself unexpectedly before  the artist, mimicking the step, and assuming the look of their deceased  friend. Hogarth was much affected at first, but, on recovering, took his  pencil, and drew the portrait. For those who love a soberer history, the  third edition is ready. Mrs. Hogarth, when questioned concerning it,  said, that she remembered the affair well; her husband began the  picture--and finished it--one evening in his own house, and sitting by  her side.    \"Captain Coram, the projector of the Foundling Hospital, sat for his  portrait to Hogarth, and it is one of the best he ever painted. There is  a natural dignity and great benevolence expressed in a face which, in  the original, was rough and forbidding. This worthy man, having laid out  his fortune and impaired his health in acts of charity and mercy, was  reduced to poverty in his old age. An annuity of a hundred pounds was  privately purchased, and when it was presented to him, he said, 'I did  not waste the wealth which I possessed in self-indulgence or vain  expense, and am not ashamed to own that in my old age I am poor.'    \"The last which I shall notice of this class of productions, is the  portrait of the celebrated demagogue John Wilkes. This singular  performance originated in a quarrel with that witty libertine, and his  associate Churchill the poet: it immediately followed an article, from  the pen of Wilkes, in the North Briton, which insulted Hogarth as a man,  and traduced him as an artist. It is so little of a caricature, that  Wilkes good humouredly observes somewhere in his correspondence, 'I am  growing every day more and more like my portrait by Hogarth.' The  terrible scourge of the satirist fell bitterly upon the personal and  moral deformities of the man. Compared with his chastisement the  hangman's whip is but a proverb, and the pillory a post of honour. He  might hope oblivion from the infamy of both; but from Hogarth there was  no escape. It was little indeed that the artist had to do, to brand and  emblazon him with the vices of his nature--but with how much  discrimination that little is done! He took up the correct portrait,  which Walpole upbraids him with skulking into a court of law to obtain,  and in a few touches the man sank, and the demon of hypocrisy and  sensuality sat in his stead. It is a fiend, and yet it is Wilkes still.  It is said that when he had finished this remarkable portrait, the  former friendship of Wilkes overcame him, and he threw it into the fire,  from which it was saved by the interposition of his wife.\"    All the criticisms on Hogarth's _moral_ pictures have an air of  originality and freshness of mind, which is so attractive, as to make us  regret that we have not room for them. In proof of this, only let the  reader turn to Mr. Cunningham's remarks on the Harlot and Rake's  Progress, at pages 98 and 99. His descriptions too of the satirical  pictures are extremely ludicrous, and in effect second only to painting  itself. The following anecdote of the celebrated _March to Finchley_ is  curious, though well known:--    \"The original painting was, on the publication of the print, disposed of  by a kind of lottery. Seven shillings and sixpence were fixed as the  price of a print; and every purchaser of a print was entitled to a  chance in the lottery for the picture. Eighteen hundred and forty-three  chances were"]]]
