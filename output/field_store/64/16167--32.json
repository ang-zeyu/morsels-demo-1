[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12169"],[0,"Sakoontala; Or, The Lost Ring: An Indian Drama (#3)"],[1," own for the  grand, yet simple and chaste creation of Kalidasa.    The unrestricted liberty of employing hypermetrical lines of eleven  syllables, sanctioned by the highest authority in dramatic  composition, has, I think, facilitated the attainment of this object.  One of our own poets has said in relation to such lines: 'Let it be  remembered that they supply us with another cadence; that they add, as  it were, a string to the instrument; and--by enabling the poet to  relax at pleasure, to rise and fall with his subject--contribute what  most is wanted, compass and variety. They are nearest to the flow of  an unstudied eloquence, and should therefore be used in the drama[4].'  Shakespeare does not scruple to avail himself of this licence four or  five times in succession, as in the well-known passage beginning--      'To be or not to be, that is the question';    and even Milton uses the same freedom once or twice in every page.    The poetical merit of Kalidasa's '[S']akoontala' is so universally  admitted that any remarks on this head would be superfluous. I will  merely observe that, in the opinion of learned natives, the Fourth  Act, which describes the departure of [S']akoontala from the hermitage,  contains the most obvious beauties; and that no one can read this Act,  nor indeed any part of the play, without being struck with the  richness and elevation of its author's genius, the exuberance and glow  of his fancy, his ardent love of the beautiful, his deep sympathy with  Nature and Nature's loveliest scenes, his profound knowledge of the  human heart, his delicate appreciation of its most refined feelings,  his familiarity with its conflicting sentiments and emotions. But in  proportion to the acknowledged excellence of Kalidasa's composition,  and in proportion to my own increasing admiration of its beauties, is  the diffidence I feel lest I may have failed to infuse any of the  poetry of the original into the present version. Translation of poetry  must, at the best, resemble the process of pouring a highly volatile  and evanescent spirit from one receptacle into another. The original  fluid will always suffer a certain amount of waste and evaporation.    The English reader will at least be inclined to wonder at the  analogies which a thoroughly Eastern play offers to our own dramatic  compositions written many centuries later. The dexterity with which  the plot is arranged and conducted, the ingenuity with which the  incidents are connected, the skill with which the characters are  delineated and contrasted with each other, the boldness and felicity  of the diction, are scarcely unworthy of the great dramatists of  European countries. Nor does the parallel fail in the management of  the business of the stage, in minute directions to the actors, and  various scenic artifices. The asides and aparts, the exits and the  entrances, the manner, attitude, and gait of the speakers, the tone of  voice with which they are to deliver themselves, the tears, the  smiles, and the laughter, are as regularly indicated as in a modern  drama.    In reference to the constitution and structure of the play here  translated, a few general remarks on the dramatic system of the Hindus  may be needed[5].    Dramatic poetry is said to have been invented by the sage Bharata,  who lived at a very remote period of Indian history, and was the  author of a system of music. The drama of these early times was  probably nothing more than the Indian Nach-dance (Nautch) of the  present day. It was a species of rude pantomime, in which dancing and  movements of the body were accompanied by mute gestures of the hands  and face, or by singing and music. Subsequently, dialogue was added,  and the art of theatrical representation was brought to great  perfection. Elaborate treatises were written which laid down minute  regulations for the construction and conduct of plays, and subjected  dramatic composition to highly artificial rules of poetical and  rhetorical style. For example, the Sahitya-darpana divides Sanskrit  plays into two great classes, the Rupaka or principal dramas, and the  Uparupaka or minor dramas. At the head of the ten species of Rupaka  stands the Nataka, of which the '[S']akoontala' is an example. It should  consist of from five to ten Acts; it should have a celebrated story  for its plot; it should represent heroic or godlike characters and  good deeds; it should be written in an elaborate style, and be full of  noble sentiments. Moreover, it should be composed like the end of a  cow's tail; so that each of the Acts be gradually shorter.    In India, as in Greece, scenic entertainments took place at religious  festivals, and on solemn public occasions. Kalidasa's '[S']akoontala'  seems to have been acted at the commencement of the summer season--a  period peculiarly sacred to Kama-deva, the Indian god of love. We are  told that it was enacted before an audience 'consisting chiefly of men  of education and discernment.' As the greater part of every play was  written in Sanskrit, which, although spoken by the learned in every  part of India even at the present day, was certainly not the  vernacular language of the country at the time when the Hindu dramas  were performed, few spectators would be present who were not of the  educated classes. This circumstance is in accordance with the  constitution of Hindu society, whereby the productions of literature  as well as the offices of state, were reserved for the privileged  castes[6].    Every Sanskrit play opens with a prologue, or, to speak more  correctly, an introduction, designed to prepare the way for the  entrance of the _dramatis personae_. The prologue commences with a  benediction or prayer (pronounced by a Brahman, or if the  stage-manager happened to be of the Brahmanical caste, by the manager  himself), in which the poet invokes the favour of the national deity  in behalf of the audience. The blessing is generally followed by a  dialogue between the manager and one or two of the actors, in which an  account is given of the author of the drama, a complimentary tribute  is paid to the critical acumen of the spectators, and such a reference  is made to past occurrences or present circumstances as may be  necessary for the elucidation of the plot. At the conclusion of the  prologue, the manager, by some abrupt exclamation, adroitly introduces  one of the dramatic personages, and the real performance commences.    The play, being thus opened, is carried forward in scenes and Acts;  each scene being marked by the entrance of one character and the exit  of another, as in the French drama. The _dramatis personae_ were  divided into three classes--the inferior characters (nicha), who were  said to speak Prakrit in a monotonous accentless tone of voice  (anudattoktya); the middling (madhyama), and the superior (pradhana),  who were said to speak Sanskrit with accent, emphasis, and expression  (udattoktya). In general, the stage is never left vacant till the end  of an Act, nor does any change of locality take place until then. The  commencement of a new Act is often marked, like the commencement of  the piece, by an introductory monologue or dialogue spoken by one or  more of the _dramatis personae_, and called Vishkambha or Prave[S']aka.  In this scene allusion is frequently made to events supposed to have  occurred in the interval of the Acts, and the audience is the better  prepared to take up the thread of the story, which is then skilfully  carried on to the concluding scene. The piece closes, as it began,  with a prayer for national plenty and prosperity, addressed to the  favourite deity, and spoken by one of the principal personages of the  drama.    Although, in the conduct of the plot, and the delineation of  character, Hindu dramatists show considerable skill, yet they do not  appear to have been remarkable for much fertility of invention. Love,  according to Hindu notions, is the subject of most of their dramas.    The hero, who is generally a king, and already the husband of a wife  or wives (for a wife or two more or less is no encumbrance in Indian  plays), is suddenly smitten with the charms of a lovely woman,  sometimes a nymph, or, as in the case of [S']akoontala, the daughter of  a nymph by a mortal father. The heroine is required to be equally  impressible, and the first tender glance from the hero's eye reaches  her heart. With true feminine delicacy, however, she locks the secret  of her passion in her own breast, and by her coyness and reserve keeps  her lover for a long period in the agonies of suspense. The hero,  being reduced to a proper state of desperation, is harassed by other  difficulties. Either the celestial nature of the nymph is in the way  of their union, or he doubts the legality of the match, or he fears  his own unworthiness, or he is hampered by the angry jealousy of a  previous wife. In short, doubts, obstacles, and delays make great  havoc of both hero and heroine. They give way to melancholy, indulge  in amorous rhapsodies, and become very emaciated. So far, it must be  confessed, the story is decidedly dull, and its chain, however, does  not commence until the Fourth Act, when the union of the heroine with  King Dushyanta, and her acceptance of the marriage-ring as a token of  recognition, are supposed to have taken place. Then follows the King's  departure and temporary desertion of his bride; the curse pronounced  on [S']akoontala by the choleric Sage; the monarch's consequent loss of  memory; the bride's journey to the palace of her husband; the  mysterious disappearance of the marriage-token; the public repudiation  of [S']akoontala; her miraculous assumption to closes, as it began, with  a prayer for national plenty and prosperity, addressed to the  favourite deity, and spoken by one of the principal personages of the  drama.    Although, in the conduct of the plot, and the delineation of  character, Hindu dramatists "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12187"],[0,"The Mystery of 31 New Inn (#3)"],[1,"rational, and, as you may have gathered, rather obstinate.  That is the peculiar and puzzling feature in the case; this alternation  between a state of stupor and an almost normal and healthy condition.  But perhaps you had better see him and judge for yourself. He had a  rather severe attack just now. Follow me, please. The stairs are rather  dark.\"    The stairs were very dark, and I noticed that they were without any  covering of carpet, or even oil-cloth, so that our footsteps resounded  dismally as if we were in an empty house. I stumbled up after my guide,  feeling my way by the hand-rail, and on the first floor followed him  into a room similar in size to the one below and very barely furnished,  though less squalid than the other. A single candle at the farther end  threw its feeble light on a figure in the bed, leaving the rest of the  room in a dim twilight.    As Mr. Weiss tiptoed into the chamber, a woman--the one who had spoken  to me below--rose from a chair by the bedside and quietly left the room  by a second door. My conductor halted, and looking fixedly at the figure  in the bed, called out:    \"Philip! Philip! Here is the doctor come to see you.\"    He paused for a moment or two, and, receiving no answer, said: \"He seems  to be dozing as usual. Will you go and see what you can make of him?\"    I stepped forward to the bedside, leaving Mr. Weiss at the end of the  room near the door by which we had entered, where he remained, slowly  and noiselessly pacing backwards and forwards in the semi-obscurity. By  the light of the candle I saw an elderly man with good features and a  refined, intelligent and even attractive face, but dreadfully emaciated,  bloodless and sallow. He lay quite motionless except for the scarcely  perceptible rise and fall of his chest; his eyes were nearly closed, his  features relaxed, and, though he was not actually asleep, he seemed to  be in a dreamy, somnolent, lethargic state, as if under the influence of  some narcotic.    I watched him for a minute or so, timing his slow breathing by my  watch, and then suddenly and sharply addressed him by name; but the only  response was a slight lifting of the eyelids, which, after a brief,  drowsy glance at me, slowly subsided to their former position.    I now proceeded to make a physical examination. First, I felt his pulse,  grasping his wrist with intentional brusqueness in the hope of rousing  him from his stupor. The beats were slow, feeble and slightly irregular,  giving clear evidence, if any were needed, of his generally lowered  vitality. I listened carefully to his heart, the sounds of which were  very distinct through the thin walls of his emaciated chest, but found  nothing abnormal beyond the feebleness and uncertainty of its action.  Then I turned my attention to his eyes, which I examined closely with  the aid of the candle and my ophthalmoscope lens, raising the lids  somewhat roughly so as to expose the whole of the irises. He submitted  without resistance to my rather ungentle handling of these sensitive  structures, and showed no signs of discomfort even when I brought the  candle-flame to within a couple of inches of his eyes.    But this extraordinary tolerance of light was easily explained by closer  examination; for the pupils were contracted to such an extreme degree  that only the very minutest point of black was visible at the centre of  the grey iris. Nor was this the only abnormal peculiarity of the sick  man's eyes. As he lay on his back, the right iris sagged down slightly  towards its centre, showing a distinctly concave surface; and, when I  contrived to produce a slight but quick movement of the eyeball, a  perceptible undulatory movement could be detected. The patient had, in  fact, what is known as a tremulous iris, a condition that is seen in  cases where the crystalline lens has been extracted for the cure of  cataract, or where it has become accidentally displaced, leaving the  iris unsupported. In the present case, the complete condition of the  iris made it clear that the ordinary extraction operation had not been  performed, nor was I able, on the closest inspection with the aid of my  lens, to find any trace of the less common \"needle operation.\" The  inference was that the patient had suffered from the accident known as  \"dislocation of the lens\"; and this led to the further inference that he  was almost or completely blind in the right eye.    This conclusion was, indeed, to some extent negatived by a deep  indentation on the bridge of the nose, evidently produced by spectacles,  and by marks which I looked for and found behind the ears, corresponding  to the hooks or \"curl sides\" of the glasses. For those spectacles which  are fitted with curl sides to hook over the ears are usually intended to  be worn habitually, and this agreed with the indentation on the nose;  which was deeper than would have been accounted for by the merely  occasional use of spectacles for reading. But if only one eye was  useful, a single eye-glass would have answered the purpose; not that  there was any weight in this objection, for a single eye-glass worn  constantly would be much less convenient than a pair of hook-sided  spectacles.    As to the nature of the patient's illness, only one opinion seemed  possible. It was a clear and typical case of opium or morphine  poisoning. To this conclusion all his symptoms seemed to point with  absolute certainty. The coated tongue, which he protruded slowly and  tremulously in response to a command bawled in his ear; his yellow skin  and ghastly expression; his contracted pupils and the stupor from which  he could hardly be roused by the roughest handling and which yet did not  amount to actual insensibility; all these formed a distinct and coherent  group of symptoms, not only pointing plainly to the nature of the drug,  but also suggesting a very formidable dose.    But this conclusion in its turn raised a very awkward and difficult  question. If a large--a poisonous--dose of the drug had been taken, how,  and by whom had that dose been administered? The closest scrutiny of  the patient's arms and legs failed to reveal a single mark such as would  be made by a hypodermic needle. This man was clearly no common  morphinomaniac; and in the absence of the usual sprinkling of  needlemarks, there was nothing to show or suggest whether the drug had  been taken voluntarily by the patient himself or administered by someone  else.    And then there remained the possibility that I might, after all, be  mistaken in my diagnosis. I felt pretty confident. But the wise man  always holds a doubt in reserve. And, in the present case, having regard  to the obviously serious condition of the patient, such a doubt was  eminently disturbing. Indeed, as I pocketed my stethoscope and took a  last look at the motionless, silent figure, I realized that my position  was one of extraordinary difficulty and perplexity. On the one hand my  suspicions--aroused, naturally enough, by the very unusual circumstances  that surrounded my visit--inclined me to extreme reticence; while, on  the other, it was evidently my duty to give any information that might  prove serviceable to the patient.    As I turned away from the bed Mr. Weiss stopped his slow pacing to and  fro and faced me. The feeble light of the candle now fell on him, and I  saw him distinctly for the first time. He did not impress me favourably.  He was a thick-set, round-shouldered man, a typical fair German with  tow-coloured hair, greased and brushed down smoothly, a large, ragged,  sandy beard and coarse, sketchy features. His nose was large and thick  with a bulbous end, and inclined to a reddish purple, a tint which  extended to the adjacent parts of his face as if the colour had run. His  eyebrows were large and beetling, overhanging deep-set eyes, and he wore  a pair of spectacles which gave him a somewhat owlish expression. His  exterior was unprepossessing, and I was in a state of mind that rendered  me easily receptive of an unfavourable impression.    \"Well,\" he said, \"what do you make of him?\" I hesitated, still perplexed  by the conflicting necessities of caution and frankness, but at length  replied:    \"I think rather badly of him, Mr. Weiss. He is in a very low state.\"    \"Yes, I can see that. But have you come to any decision as to the nature  of his illness?\"    There was a tone of anxiety and suppressed eagerness in the question  which, while it was natural enough in the circumstances, by no means  allayed my suspicions, but rather influenced me on the side of caution.    \"I cannot give a very definite opinion at present,\" I replied guardedly.  \"The symptoms are rather obscure and might very well indicate several  different conditions. They might be due to congestion of the brain, and,  if no other explanation were possible, I should incline to that view.  The alternative is some narcotic poison, such as opium or morphia.\"    \"But that is quite impossible. There is no such drug in the house, and  as he never leaves his room now, he could not get any from outside.\"    \"What about the servants?\" I asked.    \"There are no servants excepting my housekeeper, and she is absolutely  trustworthy.\"    \"He might have some store of the drug that you are not aware of. Is he  left alone much?\"    \"Very seldom indeed. I spend as much time with him as I can, and when I  am not able to be in the room, Mrs Schallibaum, my housekeeper, sits  with him.\"    \"Is he often as drowsy as he is now?\"    \"Oh, very often; in fact, I should say that is his usual condition. He  rouses up now and again, and then he is quite lucid and natural for,  perhaps, an hour or so; but presently he becomes drowsy again and doses  off, and remains asleep, or half asleep, for hours on end. Do you know  of any disease that takes people in that way?\"    \"No,\" I answered. \"The symptoms are not exactly like those of any  disease that is known to me. But"]]]
