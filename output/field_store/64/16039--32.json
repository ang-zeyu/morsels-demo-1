I'll pull out  of your road in a jiffy, an' if we do go down in th' ditch, why we can  throw off part of th' load, lighten th' wagon, an' pull out again.  You've got t' hustle if ye git t' Shopton by three o'clock.\"    \"I can do it with a clear road,\" declared Tom, confidently.    \"Then ye'll have th' clear road,\" Mr. Lyon assured him. \"Come boys,  let's git th' hay t' one side.\"    The farmers pulled into the ditch. As they had feared the wagon went in  almost to the hubs, but they did not mind, and, even as Tom and Mr.  Damon shot past them, they fell to work tossing off part of the fodder,  to lighten the wagon. The young inventor and his companion waved a  grateful farewell to them as they fairly tore past, for Tom had turned  on almost the full current.    \"Do you suppose that was the Happy Harry gang, or some members of it  who were not captured and sent to jail?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"I don't believe so,\" answered the lad, shaking his head.  \"Maybe they  didn't really want to rob us. Perhaps they only wanted to delay us so  we wouldn't get to the bank on time.\"    \"Bless my top knot, you may be right!\" cried Mr. Damon.    Further conversation became difficult, as they struck a rough part of  the road, where the vehicle swayed and jolted to an alarming degree.  But Tom never slackened pace. On and on they rushed, Mr. Damon  frequently looking at his watch.    \"We've got twenty minutes left,\" he remarked as they came out on the  smooth stretch of road, that led directly into Shopton.    Then Tom turned all the reserve power into the motor. The machinery  almost groaned as the current surged into the wires, but it took up the  load, and the electric car, swaying more than ever, dashed ahead with  its burden of wealth.    Now they were in the town, now speeding down the street leading to the  bank. One or two policemen shouted after them, for they were violating  the speed laws, but it was no time to stop for that. On and on they  dashed.    They came in sight of the bank. A long line of persons was still in  front. They seemed more excited than in the morning, for the hour of  three was approaching, and they feared the bank would close its doors,  never to open them again.    \"The run is still on,\" observed Mr. Damon.    \"But it will soon be over,\" predicted Tom.    Some news of the errand of the automobile must have penetrated the  crowd, for as Tom swung past the front entrance to the bank, to go up  the rear alley, he was greeted with a cheer.    \"They've got the cash!\" a man cried. \"I'm satisfied now. I won't draw  out my deposit.\"    \"I want to see the cash before I'll believe it,\" said another.    Tom slowed up to make the turn into the alley. As he did so he glanced  across the street to the new bank. In the window stood Andy Foger and  his father. There was a look of surprise on their faces as they saw the  arrival of the powerful car, and, Tom fancied, also a look of chagrin.    Up the alley went the car, police keeping the crowd from following. The  porter was at the door. So, also, was Mr. Pendergast and Mr. Swift,  while some of the other officers were grouped behind them.    \"Did you get the money?\" gasped the president.    \"We did,\" answered Tom. \"Are we on time, Dad?\"    \"Just on time, my boy! They're paying out the last of the cash now!  You're on time, thank fortune!\"          CHAPTER XXI    OFF TO THE BIG RACE      From their task of handing out money to eager depositors, the wearied  tellers looked up as Tom and Mr. Damon entered with the big valise  crammed full of money. It was opened, and the bundles of bills turned  out on a table.    \"Perhaps you'd better make an announcement to the crowd, Mr.  Pendergast,\" suggested Mr. Swift. \"Tell them we now have cash enough to  meet all demands, and that the bank will be kept open until every one  is paid.\"    \"I will,\" agreed the aged president. His announcement was received with  cheers, and had exactly the effect the inventor hoped it would.    Many, learning that the bank was safe, and that they could have their  money whenever they wanted it, concluded not to withdraw it, thus  saving the interest. Scores in the waiting crowd turned out of line and  went home. Their example was contagious, and, though many still  remained to get their deposits, the run was broken. Only part of the  sixty thousand dollars Tom and Mr. Damon had brought through after a  race with time, was needed. But had it not been for the moral effect of  the cash arriving as it did, the bank would have failed.    \"You have a great car, Tom Swift,\" complimented Mr. Pendergast, when  the excitement had somewhat cooled down, and the story of the hold-up  had been told.    \"I think so myself,\" agreed the young inventor modestly. \"I must get  ready for the races now.\"    \"And as for those farmers, I think I'll send them a reward,\" went on  the president. \"They deserve something for the trouble they had with  the load of hay. I certainly shall send them a reward,\" which he did,  and a substantial one, too.    Of course the hold-up was at once reported to the police after the run  had quieted down, but Chief Simonson surprised Tom by saying that he  had expected it.    \"The gang that held you up,\" said the police officer, \"was one that  escaped from a jail, about twenty miles away. I got a tip after you  left, that they were going to rob you, for, in some way, they learned  about the money you and Mr. Damon were to bring from the bank. The  unfortunate part of it was that the tip I got was to the effect that  the hold-up would take place just outside of Clayton. I telephoned to  the police there, just after you left, and they said they'd send out a  posse. But the gang changed their plans; and held you up near here,  where I wasn't expecting it. But I'll get 'em yet.\"    Chief Simonson did not arrest the gang, but some other police officers  did, and they were taken back to jail. They were not prosecuted for the  attempted robbery of Tom, as it was considered difficult to fix the  guilt on them, but they received such a long additional sentence for  breaking jail, that it will be many years before they are released.    When Tom reached home that night he found some mail from the officials  of the Touring Club of America. It was to the effect that arrangements  for the big contest had been completed, and that contesting cars must  be on the ground by September first.    \"That gives me two weeks yet,\" thought our hero.    He read further of the regulations covering the race. Each car must  proceed from the home town or city of the owner, and go to the track  under its own power. This was a new regulation, it was stated, and was  adopted to better develop the industry of building electric autos. Two  passengers, or one in addition to the driver, must be carried, it was  stated, and this one would also be expected to be in the car during the  entire race.    Regarding the race proper it was stated that at first it had been  decided to make it a twenty-four hour endurance contest, but that for  certain reasons this was changed, as it was found that few storage  batteries could go this length of time without a number of rechargings.  Therefore the race was to be one for distance--five hundred miles, on  the new Long Island track, and the car first covering that distance  would win. Cars were allowed to change their batteries as often as they  needed to, but all time lost would count against them. There were other  rules and regulations of minor importance.    \"Well,\" remarked Tom, as he read through the circulars, \"I must get my  car in shape. It will be quite a trip to Long Island, and I think my  best plan will be to go direct to the cottage we had when we were  building the submarine, and from there proceed to the track. That will  comply with the rules, I think. But who will I get to go with me? I  suppose Mr. Damon or Mr. Sharp will be willing. I'll ask them.\"    He broached the matter to his two friends that night, and they both  agreed to go to Long Island in the car, though only Mr. Sharp would  accompany Tom in the race. The next two weeks were busy ones for Tom.  He worked night and day over his car, getting it in shape for the big  event.    The young inventor made some changes in his battery, and also adopted a  new gear, which would give greater speed. He also completed the  exterior of the auto, giving it several coats of purple paint and  varnish, so that when it was finished, though it was different in shape  from most autos, it was as fine an appearing car as one could wish. He  arranged to carry two extra wheels, with tires inflated, and, under the  rear seats, or tonneau, as he called it, Tom fitted up a complete  tire-repairing outfit. Mr. Sharp agreed to ride there, and in case  there was need to use more than two spare wheels during the race, the  rubber shoes or inner tubes could be mended while the car was swinging  around the track.    Mr. Damon would ride in front with Tom on the cross-country trip, and  occasionally relieve him at steering, or would help to manage the  electrical connections. Spare fuses, extra parts, wires and different  things he thought he might need, the young inventor stored in his car.  He also found means to install a small additional storage battery, to  give added power in case of emergency.    Tom learned from the racing officials that if he made a trip from  Shopton to the cottage on the coast, near the city of Atlantis, and  later traveled from there to the track, it would fulfill the conditions  of the contest.    Finally all was in readiness, and one morning, having spent the better  part of the night going over his machine, to see that he had forgotten  nothing, Tom invited Mr. Damon and Mr. Sharp to enter, and prepare for  the trip to Long Island.    \"Well, Tom, I certainly hope you win that race,\" remarked Mrs. Baggert,  as she stood in the doorway, waving a farewell.    \"If I do I'll buy you a pair"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/953"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Big Tunnel; Or, The Hidden City of the Andes (#20)"],[1,"to his big shoulders, and, as this would  provide meat enough for some time, Tom started back for camp.    As he and Mr. Damon, with Koku in the rear, passed through a little  clearing, they saw, on the far side, a native hut.  And from it rushed  a woman, who approached Tom, casting herself on her knees, while she  pressed his free hand to her head.    \"Bless my scarf pin!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"What does this mean, Tom?\"    \"Oh, this is the mother of the child I saved from the condor,\" said  Tom. \"Every time she sees me she thanks me all over again. How is the  baby?\" he asked in the Indian tongue, for he was a fair master of it by  now.    \"The baby is well. Will the mighty hunter permit himself to enter my  miserable hovel and partake of some milk and cakes?\"    \"What do you say, Mr. Damon?\" Tom asked. \"She's clean and neat, and she  makes a drink of goat's milk that isn't bad.  She bakes some kind of  meal cakes that are good, too. I'm hungry.\"    \"All right, Tom, I'll do as you say.\"    A little later they were partaking of a rude, but none the less  welcome, lunch in the woman's hut, while the baby whose life Tom had  saved cooed in the rough log cradle.    \"Say, Masni,\" asked Tom, addressing the woman by name, \"don't you know  where we can get some men to work the tunnel?\" Of course Tom spoke the  Indian language, and he had to adapt himself to the comprehension of  Masni.    \"Men no work tunnel?\" she inquired.    \"No, they've all skipped out--vamoosed. Afraid of some spirit.\"    The woman looked around, as though in fear. Then she approached Tom  closely and whispered:    \"No spirit in tunnel--bad man!\"    \"What!\" cried Tom, almost jumping off his stool. \"What do you mean,  Masni?\"    \"Me tell mighty hunter,\" she went on, lowering her voice still more.  \"My man he no want to tell, he 'fraid, but I tell. Mighty hunter save  Vashni,\" and she looked toward the baby. \"Me help friends of mighty  hunter. Bad man in tunnel--no spirit!    \"Men go. Spirit no take um--bad man take um.\"    \"Where are they now?\" asked Tom. \"Jove, if I could find them the secret  would be solved!\"    The woman looked fearfully around the hut and then whispered:    \"You come--me show!\"    \"Bless my toothbrush!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"What is going to happen, Tom  Swift?\"    \"I don't know,\" was the answer, \"but something sure is in the wind. I  guess I shot better than I knew when I killed that condor.\"          Chapter XX    Despair      Calling to a girl of about thirteen years to look after her baby, Masni  slipped along up a rough mountain trail, motioning to Tom, Mr. Damon  and Koku to follow. Or rather, the woman gave the sign to Tom, ignoring  the others, who, naturally, would not be left behind. Masni seemed to  have eyes for no one but the young inventor, and the manner in which  she looked at him showed the deep gratitude she felt toward him for  having saved her baby from the great condor.    \"Come,\" she said, in her strange Indian tongue, which Tom could  interpret well enough for himself now.    \"But where are we going, Masni?\" he asked. \"This isn't the way to the  tunnel.\"    \"Me know. Not go to tunnel now,\" was her answer. \"Me show you men.\"    \"But which men do you mean, Masni?\" inquired Tom. \"The lost men, or the  bad ones, who are making trouble for us?  Which men do you mean?\"    Masni only shook her head, and murmured: \"Me show.\"    Probably Tom's attempt to talk her language was not sufficiently clear  to her.    \"My man--he good man,\" she said, coming to a pause on the rough trail  after a climb which was not easy.    \"Yes, I know he is,\" Tom said. \"But he went on a strike with the  others, Masni. He no work. He go on a 'hit,' as Serato calls it,\" and  Tom laughed.    \"My man he good man--but he 'fraid,\" said the wife. \"He want to tell  you of bad mans, but he 'fraid. You save my baby, I no 'fraid. I tell.\"    \"Oh, I see,\" said Tom. \"Your husband would have given away the secret,  only he's afraid of the bad men. He likes me, too?\"    \"Sure!\" Masni exclaimed. \"He want tell, but 'fraid. He go 'way, I tell.\"    Tom was not quite sure what it all meant, but it seemed that after his  slaying of the condor both parents were so filled with gratitude that  they wanted to reveal some secret about the tunnel, only Masni's  husband was afraid. She, however, had been braver.    \"Something is going to happen,\" said Tom Swift. \"I feel it in my bones!\"    \"Bless my porous plaster!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"I hope it isn't anything  serious.\"    \"We'll see,\" Tom went on.    They resumed their journey up the mountain trail. It wound in and out  in a region none of them had before visited.  Though it could not be  far from the tunnel, it was almost a strange country to Tom.    Suddenly Masni stopped in a narrow gorge where the walls of rock rose  high on either hand. She seemed looking for something. Her sharp, black  eyes scanned the cliff and then with an exclamation of satisfaction she  approached a certain place. With a quick motion she pulled aside a mass  of tangled vines, and disclosed a path leading down through a V shaped  crack in the cliff.    \"Mans down there,\" she said. \"You go look.\"    For a moment Tom hesitated. Was this a trap? If he and his friends  entered this narrow and dark opening might not the Indian woman roll  down some rock back of them, cutting off forever the way of escape?    Tom turned and looked at Masni. Then he was ashamed of his suspicion,  for the honest black face, smiling at him, showed no trace of guile.    \"You go--you see lost men,\" the woman urged.    \"Come on!\" cried Tom. \"I believe we're on the track of the mystery!\"    He led the way, followed by Mr. Damon, while Koku came next and then  Masni. It could be no trap since she entered it herself.    The path widened, but not much. There was only room for one to walk at  a time. The trail twisted and turned, and Tom was wondering how far it  led, when, from behind him, came the cry of the woman:    \"Watch now--no fall down.\"    Tom halted around a sharp turn, and stood transfixed at the sight which  met his gaze. He found himself looking out through a crack in the face  of a sheer stone cliff that went straight down for a hundred feet or  more to a green-carpeted valley.    Tom was standing in a narrow cleft of rock--the same rock through which  they had made their way. And at the foot of the cliff was a little  encampment of Indians. There were a dozen huts, and wandering about  them, or sitting in the shade, were a score or more of Indians.    \"There men from tunnel,\" said Masni, and, as he looked, wondering, Tom  saw some of the workers he knew. One especially, was a laborer who  walked with a peculiar limp.    \"The missing men!\" gasped the young inventor.    \"Bless my almanac!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Where?\"    \"Here,\" answered Tom. \"If you squeeze past me you can see them.\"    Mr. Damon did so.    \"How did they get here?\" asked the odd man, as he looked down in the  little valley where the missing ones were sequestered.    \"That's what we've got to find out,\" Tom said. \"At any rate here they  are, and they seem to be enjoying life while we've been worrying as to  what had become of them. How did they get here, Masni?\"    \"Me show you. Come.\"    \"Wait until I take another look,\" said Tom.    \"Be careful they don't see you,\" cautioned Mr. Damon.    \"They can't very well. The cleft is screened by bushes.\"    Tom looked down once more on the group of men who had so mysteriously  disappeared. The little valley stretched out away from the face of the  cliff, through which, by means of the crack, or cleft in it, Tom and  the others had come. Tom looked down the wall of rock. It was as smooth  as the side of a building, and offered no means of getting down or up.  Doubtless there was an easier entrance to the valley on the other side.  It was like looking down into some vast hall through an upper window or  from a balcony.    \"And those men have been in hiding, or been hidden here, ever since  they disappeared from the tunnel,\" said Mr. Damon.    \"It doesn't look as though they were detained by force,\" Tom remarked.  \"I think they are being paid to stay away. How did they get here,  Masni?\"    \"Me show you. Come!\"    They went back along the trail that led through the split in the rock,  until they had come to the place where the natural curtain of vines  concealed the entrance. Tom took particular notice of this place so he  would know it again.    Then Masni led them over the mountain, and this time Tom saw that they  were approaching the tunnel. He recognized some places where he had  taken samples of rock from the outcropping to test the strength of his  explosive.    Reaching a certain wild and desolate place, Masni made a signal of  caution. She seemed to be listening intently.  Then, as if satisfied  there was no danger, she parted some bushes and glided in, motioning  the others to follow.    \"Now I wonder what's up,\" Tom mused.    He and the others were soon informed.    Masni stopped in front of a pile of brush. With a few vigorous motions  of her arms she swept it aside and revealed a smooth slab of rock. In  the centre was what seemed to be a block of metal Masni placed her foot  on this and pressed heavily.    And those watching saw a strange thing.    The slab of rock tilted to one side, as if on a pivot, revealing a  square opening which seemed to lead through solid stone. And at the far  end of the opening Tom Swift saw a glimmer of light.    Stooping down, he looked through the hole thus strangely opened and  what he saw caused him to cry out in wonder.    \"It's the tunnel!\" he cried. \"I can look right down into the tunnel.  It's the incandescent lights I see. I can look right at the ledge of  rock where I kept watch that day, and where I saw--where I saw the face  of Waddington!\" he cried.  \"It wasn't a dream after all. This is a  shaft connecting with the tunnel. We didn't discover it because this  rock fits right in the"]]]
