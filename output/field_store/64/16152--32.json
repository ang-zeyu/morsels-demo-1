I tuk Mother's money, an' what  the cook give me, an' got Baldy out, an' bought him a license so's he'd  be safe nex' time. Now,\" sadly, \"there ain't goin' t' be any nex' time.\"    \"There really did not seem to be any other way out of it for the  moment,\" observed the Woman sympathetically.    \"No, ma'am, but it wasn't very honest t' use the cook's money, ner  Mother's; it'll take a long time t' pay 'em back, an' I guess Mother  won't have much patience with Baldy after this. I wouldn't mind gittin'  punished myself, but I don't want him blamed. He'd be a lot better off  with you, Mr. Allan; an' mebbe ef you'd feed him up, an' give him a  chanct, he'd be a racer some day. He'd never lay down on you, an',\"  almost defiantly, \"he's got good legs.\"    \"Scotty\" felt the dog's legs, and noted the breadth of his chest. \"What  do you want for him, Ben?\"    \"Would ten dollars be too much?\" asked the boy, eagerly.    \"Ten dollars would be too little,\" quickly exclaimed the Woman. \"You see  we are getting ahead of all the others who do not know his fine points  yet, and we should be willing to pay something extra for this  opportunity. Do you think that twenty-five dollars would be fair,  considering that we are in on the ground floor?\"    \"Yes, ma'am, that's lots more'n I expected. But it ain't so much the  money I'm gittin' as the home he's gittin' an' the trainin' an' all.\"    \"Well, that's a bargain, then; come to my husband's office--Darling and  Dean, on Front Street, you know--the first time you are in town, and we  will give you a check; and you can bring Baldy with you then.\"    \"I guess,\" slowly, \"you'd better take him now. It 'ud be easier fer me  t' let him go while I'm kinda worked up to it. Mebbe ef I thought about  it fer a few days I wouldn't be able t' do it, an' he mightn't have  another chanct like this in his whole life.\"    He drew a frayed bit of rope from a torn pocket, and tied it to the old  strap that served as Baldy's collar--handing the end to \"Scotty.\"    In the deepening shadows of the chill November dusk the boy's face was  ashen. He stooped over as if to see that the knot in the rope was secure  at the dog's neck--but the Woman knew in that brief instant the  trembling blue lips had been pressed in an agony of renunciation against  Baldy's rough coat.    \"Thank you both very much,\" he said in a tone that he tried to keep  steady. \"Thank you fer the ride and fer--fer everything.\"    He did not trust himself to look at the dog again, but stepped quickly  into the Golconda Trail.    \"You must come to see Baldy often,\" the Woman called to him.    \"Yes, ma'am, I'll be glad to--after a while,\" he replied gratefully.    And then as \"Scotty\" gave the word to the impatient Racers, and the team  swung round to return to Nome, there came to them out of the grayness a  voice, faint and quavering like an echo--\"Some day you'll be glad you've  got Baldy.\"    [Illustration]          II    Where Every Dog Has His Day    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    CHAPTER II    WHERE EVERY DOG HAS HIS DAY      Baldy's entrance into the Allan and Darling Kennel had failed to attract  the interest that the arrival of a new inmate usually created. He was an  accident, not an acquisition, and the little comment upon his presence  was generally unfavorable.    Even Matt, who took care of the dogs, and was a sort of godfather to  them all, shook his head dubiously over Baldy. \"He don't seem to belong  here, someway,\" had been his mild criticism; while the Woman complained  to \"Scotty\" that he was one of the most unresponsive dogs she had ever  known.    \"He's not exactly unresponsive,\" maintained \"Scotty\" justly; \"but he's  self-contained, and it's hard for him to adjust himself to these recent  changes. It's all strange to him, and he misses the boy. You can't watch  him with Ben and say that he's not affectionate; but he gives his  affection slowly, and to but few people. One must earn it.\"    The Woman regarded Baldy with amused contempt. \"So one must work hard  for his affection, eh? Well, with all of the attractive dogs here  willing to lavish their devotion upon us, I think it would hardly be  worth while trying to coax Baldy's reluctant tolerance into something  warmer.\"    \"Scotty\" admitted that Baldy could hardly be considered genial. \"He's  like some people whose natures are immobile--inexpressive. It's going to  take a little while to find out if it's because there is nothing to  express, or because he is undemonstrative, and has to show by his  conduct rather than by his manners what there is to him.\"    It was true that Baldy was unmistakably ill at ease in his new quarters,  and did not feel at home; for he was accustomed neither to the luxuries  nor to the restrictions that surrounded him. His early experiences had  been distinctly plebeian and uninteresting, but they had been quite free  of control.    Born at one of the mining claims in the hills, of worthy hard-working  parents, he had, with the various other members of the family, been  raised to haul freight from town to the mine. But his attachment for Ben  Edwards had intervened, and before he was really old enough to be  thoroughly broken to harness, he had taken up his residence at Golconda.    Here his desultory training continued, but a lesson in sled pulling was  almost invariably turned into a romp, so that he had only acquired the  rudiments of an education when he came under \"Scotty's\" supervision.    His complete ignorance in matters of deportment, and possibly, too, his  retiring disposition, made him feel an intruder in the exclusive coterie  about him; and certainly there was a pronounced lack of cordiality on  the part of most of the dogs toward him. This was especially true of  Tom, Dick, and Harry, the famous Tolman brothers, who were the Veterans  of Alaska Dog Racing, and so had a standing in the Kennel that none  dared question. That is, none save Dubby, who recognized no standard  other than his own; and that standard took no cognizance of Racers as  Racers. They were all just dogs--good or bad--to Dubby.    The fact that Tom, Dick, and Harry had been in every one of those unique  dashes across the snow-swept wastes of Seward Peninsula, from Bering Sea  to the Arctic Ocean and return, and had never been \"out of the money,\"  did not count greatly in his rigid code. The same distance covered  slowly by freighters in pursuance of their task of earning their daily  living would seem to him far more worthy of respect and emulation. And  so, when the Tolman brothers, who were apt to be quarrelsome with those  \"not in their class,\" showed a coldness toward Baldy that threatened to  break into open hostility at the slightest excuse, Dubby promptly ranged  himself on the side of the newcomer with a firmness that impressed even  Tom, Dick, and Harry with a determination to be at least discreet if not  courteous.    They had learned, with all of the others in the Kennel, to treat with a  studied politeness--even deference--the wonderful old Huskie whose  supremacy as a leader had become a Tradition of the North; and who was  still in fighting trim should cause for trouble arise. He did not rely  alone on his past achievements, which were many and brilliant, but he  maintained a reputation for ever-ready power which is apt to give  immunity from attack.    Dubby's attitude toward the Racers generally was galling in the extreme.  Usually he ignored them completely, turning his back upon them when they  were being harnessed, and apparently oblivious of their very existence;  except as such times when he felt that they needed suggestions as to  their behavior.    There was, in a way, a certain injustice in Dubby's contempt for what  might be called the sporting element of the stable; for, like college  athletes, they were only sports incidentally, and for the greater part  of the year they were as ready and willing to do a hard day's work in  carrying goods to the creeks as were the more commonplace dogs who had  never won distinction on the Trail.    But Dubby was ultra-conservative; and while \"Scotty\" must have had some  strange human reason for all of these silly dashes with an absolutely  empty sled, in his opinion hauling a boiler up to Hobson Creek would be  a far more efficacious means of exercise, and would be a practical  accomplishment besides. Dubby was of a generation that knew not racing.  Of noted McKenzie River parentage, he came from Dawson, where he was  born, down the Yukon to Nome with \"Scotty\" Allan. He had led a team of  his brothers and sisters, six in all, the entire distance of twelve  hundred miles, early manifesting that definite acknowledged mastery over  the others that is indispensable in a good leader. He had realized what  it meant to be a Pioneer, had penetrated with daring men the waste  places in search of fame, fortune and adventure; and had carried the  heavy burdens of gold wrested from rock-ribbed mountain, and bouldered  river bed. He had helped to take the United States Mail to remote and  inaccessible districts, and had sped with the Doctor and Priest to the  bedside of the sick or dying in distant, lonely cabins.    He and his kind have ever shared the toil of the development of that  desolate country that stretches from the ice-bound Arctic to where the  gray and sullen waters of Bering Sea break on a bleak and wind-swept  shore. They figure but little in the forest-crowned Alaska of the  South, with its enchanted isles, emerald green, in the sunlit, silver  waves; but they are an indispensable factor in the very struggle for  mere existence up beyond the chain of rugged Aleutians whose towering  volcanoes are ever enveloped in a sinister shroud of smoke. Up in the  eternal snows of the Alaska of the North, the unknown Alaska--the Alaska  of Men and Dogs.    [Illustration: THE ALASKA OF MEN AND DOGS June 1--The  steamer Corwin at the edge of the ice, five "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1176"],[0,"On Horsemanship (#3)"],[1,"whether the horse, when mounted, can be  induced to leave other horses, or when being ridden past a group of  horses standing, will not bolt off to join the company. Some  horses again, as the result of bad training, will run away from the  exercising-ground and make for the stable. A hard mouth may be detected  by the exercise called the {pede} or volte, (5) and still more so by  varying the direction of the volte to right or left. Many horses will  not attempt to run away except for the concurrence of a bad mouth along  with an avenue of escape home. (6)     (5) See Sturz, s.v.; Pollux, i. 219. Al. \"the longe,\" but the passage      below (vii. 14) is suggestive rather of the volte.     (6) Al. \"will only attempt to bolt where the passage out towards home      combines, as it were, with a bad mouth.\" {e... ekphora} = \"the      exit from the manege or riding school.\"    Another point which it is necessary to learn is, whether when let go at  full speed the horse can be pulled up (7) sharp and is willing to wheel  round in obedience to the rein.     (7) {analambanetai}, \"come to the poise\" (Morgan). For      {apostrephesthai} see ix.6; tech. \"caracole.\"    It is also well to ascertain by experience if the horse you propose to  purchase will show equal docility in response to the whip. Every one  knows what a useless thing a servant is, or a body of troops, that will  not obey. A disobedient horse is not only useless, but may easily play  the part of an arrant traitor.    And since it is assumed that the horse to be purchased is intended for  war, we must widen our test to include everything which war itself can  bring to the proof: such as leaping ditches, scrambling over walls,  scaling up and springing off high banks. We must test his paces by  galloping him up and down steep pitches and sharp inclines and along a  slant. For each and all of these will serve as a touchstone to gauge the  endurance of his spirit and the soundness of his body.    I am far from saying, indeed, that because an animal fails to perform  all these parts to perfection, he must straightway be rejected; since  many a horse will fall short at first, not from inability, but from want  of experience. With teaching, practice, and habit, almost any horse will  come to perform all these feats beautifully, provided he be sound and  free from vice. Only you must beware of a horse that is naturally of a  nervous temperament. An over-timorous animal will not only prevent the  rider from using the vantage-ground of its back to strike an enemy, but  is as likely as not to bring him to earth himself and plunge him into  the worst of straits.    We must, also, find out of the horse shows any viciousness towards other  horses or towards human beings; also, whether he is skittish; (8) such  defects are apt to cause his owner trouble.     (8) Or, \"very ticklish.\"    As to any reluctance on the horse's part to being bitted or mounted,  dancing and twisting about and the rest, (9) you will get a more exact  idea on this score, if, when he has gone through his work, you will try  and repeat the precise operations which he went through before you began  your ride. Any horse that having done his work shows a readiness to  undergo it all again, affords sufficient evidence thereby of spirit and  endurance.     (9) Reading {talla dineumata}, lit. \"and the rest of his twistings and      twirlings about.\"    To put the matter in a nutshell: given that the horse is sound-footed,  gentle, moderately fast, willing and able to undergo toil, and above all  things (10) obedient--such an animal, we venture to predict, will  give the least trouble and the greatest security to his rider in the  circumstances of war; while, conversely, a beast who either out of  sluggishness needs much driving, or from excess of mettle much coaxing  and manoeuvering, will give his rider work enough to occupy both his hands  and a sinking of the heart when dangers thicken.     (10) Al. \"thoroughly.\"        IV    We will now suppose the purchaser has found a horse which he admires;  (1) the purchase is effected, and he has brought him home--how is he to  be housed? It is best that the stable should be placed in a quarter  of the establishment where the master will see the horse as often as  possible. (2) It is a good thing also to have his stall so arranged that  there will be as little risk of the horse's food being stolen from the  manger, as of the master's from his larder or store-closet. To neglect  a detail of this kind is surely to neglect oneself; since in the hour of  danger, it is certain, the owner has to consign himself, life and limb,  to the safe keeping of his horse.     (1) Lit. \"To proceed: when you have bought a horse which you admire      and have brought him home.\"     (2) i.e. \"where he will be brought as frequently as possible under the      master's eye.\" Cf. \"Econ.\" xii. 20.    Nor is it only to avoid the risk of food being stolen that a secure  horse-box is desirable, but for the further reason that if the horse  takes to scattering his food, the action is at once detected; and any  one who observes that happening may take it as a sign and symptom  either of too much blood, (3) which calls for veterinary aid, or of  over-fatigue, for which rest is the cure, or else that an attack of  indigestion (4) or some other malady is coming on. And just as with  human beings, so with the horse, all diseases are more curable at their  commencement (5) than after they have become chronic, or been wrongly  treated. (6)     (3) \"A plethoric condition of the blood.\"     (4) {krithiasis}. Lit. \"barley surfeit\"; \"une fourbure.\" See Aristot.      \"H. A.\" viii. 24. 4.     (5) i.e. \"in the early acute stages.\"     (6) Al. \"and the mischief has spread.\"    But if food and exercise with a view to strengthening the horse's body  are matters of prime consideration, no less important is it to pay  attention to the feet. A stable with a damp and smooth floor will spoil  the best hoof which nature can give. (7) To prevent the floor being  damp, it should be sloped with channels; and to avoid smoothness, paved  with cobble stones sunk side by side in the ground and similar in size  to the horse's hoofs. (8) A stable floor of this sort is calculated  to strengthen the horse's feet by the mere pressure on the part in  standing. In the next place it will be the groom's business to lead out  the horse somewhere to comb and curry him; and after his morning's feed  to unhalter him from the manger, (9) so that he may come to his evening  meal with greater relish. To secure the best type of stable-yard, and  with a view to strengthening the horse's feet, I would suggest to take  and throw down loosely (10) four or five waggon loads of pebbles, each  as large as can be grasped in the hand, and about a pound in weight; the  whole to be fenced round with a skirting of iron to prevent scattering.  The mere standing on these will come to precisely the same thing as if  for a certain portion of the day the horse were, off and on, stepping  along a stony road; whilst being curried or when fidgeted by flies he  will be forced to use his hoofs just as much as if he were walking. Nor  is it the hoofs merely, but a surface so strewn with stones will tend to  harden the frog of the foot also.     (7) Lit. \"A damp and smooth floor may be the ruin of a naturally good      hoof.\" It will be understood that the Greeks did not shoe their      horses.     (8) See Courier, p. 54, for an interesting experiment tried by himself      at Bari.     (9) Cf. \"Hipparch,\" i. 16.     (10) Or, \"spread so as to form a surface.\"    But if care is needed to make the hoofs hard, similar pains should be  taken to make the mouth and jaws soft; and the same means and appliances  which will render a man's flesh and skin soft, will serve to soften and  supple a horse's mouth. (11)     (11) Or, \"may be used with like effect on a horse's mouth,\" i.e.      bathing, friction, oil. See Pollux, i. 201.        V    It is the duty of a horseman, as we think, to have his groom trained  thoroughly in all that concerns the treatment of the horse. In the first  place, then, the groom should know that he is never to knot the halter  (1) at the point where the headstall is attached to the horse's head. By  constantly rubbing his head against the manger, if the halter does not  sit quite loose about his ears, the horse will be constantly injuring  himself; (2) and with sores so set up, it is inevitable that he should  show peevishness, while being bitted or rubbed down.     (1) Lit. \"by which the horse is tied to the manger\"; \"licol d'ecurie.\"     (2) Al. \"in nine cases out of ten he rubs his head... and ten to      one will make a sore.\"    It is desirable that the groom should be ordered to carry out the dung  and litter of the horse to some one place each day. By so doing, he will  discharge the duty with least trouble to himself, (3) and at the same  time be doing the horse a kindness.     (3) Al. \"get rid of the refuse in the easiest way.\"    The groom should also be instructed to attach the muzzle to the horse's  mouth, both when taking him out to be groomed and to the rolling-ground.  (4) In fact he should always muzzle him whenever he takes him anywhere  without the bit. The muzzle, while it is no hindrance to respiration,  prevents biting; and when attached it serves to rob the horse of  opportunity for vice. (5)     (4) Cf. \"Econ.\" xi. 18; Aristoph. \"Clouds,\" 32.     (5) Or, \"prevents the horse from carrying out vicious designs.\"    Again, care should be taken to tie the horse up with the halter above  his head. A horse's natural instinct, in trying to rid himself of  anything that irritates the face, is to toss up his head, and by this  upward movement, if so tied, he only slackens the chain instead of  snapping it. In rubbing the horse down, the groom should begin with the  head and mane; as until the upper parts are clean, it is vain to"]]]
