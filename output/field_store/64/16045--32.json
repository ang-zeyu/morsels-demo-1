Nevertheless, come on, and I will strive my best to serve you all.\"    \"Stop!\" cried Robin Hood, \"we will fight no more. I take my vow, this  is an ill day for thee and me, Little John. I do verily believe that  my wrist, and eke my arm, are palsied by the jar of the blow that this  stranger struck me.\"    Then Little John turned to Robin Hood. \"Why, how now, good master,\" said  he. \"Alas! Thou art in an ill plight. Marry, thy jerkin is all befouled  with the dust of the road. Let me help thee to arise.\"    \"A plague on thy aid!\" cried Robin angrily. \"I can get to my feet  without thy help, good fellow.\"    \"Nay, but let me at least dust thy coat for thee. I fear thy poor bones  are mightily sore,\" quoth Little John soberly, but with a sly twinkle in  his eyes.    \"Give over, I say!\" quoth Robin in a fume. \"My coat hath been dusted  enough already, without aid of thine.\" Then, turning to the stranger, he  said, \"What may be thy name, good fellow?\"    \"My name is Gamwell,\" answered the other.    \"Ha!\" cried Robin, \"is it even so? I have near kin of that name. Whence  camest thou, fair friend?\"    \"From Maxfield Town I come,\" answered the stranger. \"There was I born  and bred, and thence I come to seek my mother's young brother, whom men  call Robin Hood. So, if perchance thou mayst direct me--\"    \"Ha! Will Gamwell!\" cried Robin, placing both hands upon the other's  shoulders and holding him off at arm's length. \"Surely, it can be none  other! I might have known thee by that pretty maiden air of thine--that  dainty, finicking manner of gait. Dost thou not know me, lad? Look upon  me well.\"    \"Now, by the breath of my body!\" cried the other, \"I do believe from my  heart that thou art mine own Uncle Robin. Nay, certain it is so!\" And  each flung his arms around the other, kissing him upon the cheek.    Then once more Robin held his kinsman off at arm's length and scanned  him keenly from top to toe. \"Why, how now,\" quoth he, \"what change is  here? Verily, some eight or ten years ago I left thee a stripling lad,  with great joints and ill-hung limbs, and lo! here thou art, as tight a  fellow as e'er I set mine eyes upon. Dost thou not remember, lad, how I  showed thee the proper way to nip the goose feather betwixt thy fingers  and throw out thy bow arm steadily? Thou gayest great promise of being a  keen archer. And dost thou not mind how I taught thee to fend and parry  with the cudgel?\"    \"Yea,\" said young Gamwell, \"and I did so look up to thee, and thought  thee so above all other men that, I make my vow, had I known who thou  wert, I would never have dared to lift hand against thee this day. I  trust I did thee no great harm.\"    \"No, no,\" quoth Robin hastily, and looking sideways at Little John,  \"thou didst not harm me. But say no more of that, I prythee. Yet I will  say, lad, that I hope I may never feel again such a blow as thou didst  give me. By'r Lady, my arm doth tingle yet from fingernail to elbow.  Truly, I thought that I was palsied for life. I tell thee, coz, that  thou art the strongest man that ever I laid mine eyes upon. I take my  vow, I felt my stomach quake when I beheld thee pluck up yon green tree  as thou didst. But tell me, how camest thou to leave Sir Edward and thy  mother?\"    \"Alas!\" answered young Gamwell, \"it is an ill story, uncle, that I  have to tell thee. My father's steward, who came to us after old Giles  Crookleg died, was ever a saucy varlet, and I know not why my father  kept him, saving that he did oversee with great judgment. It used to  gall me to hear him speak up so boldly to my father, who, thou knowest,  was ever a patient man to those about him, and slow to anger and harsh  words. Well, one day--and an ill day it was for that saucy fellow--he  sought to berate my father, I standing by. I could stand it no  longer, good uncle, so, stepping forth, I gave him a box o' the ear,  and--wouldst thou believe it?--the fellow straightway died o't. I think  they said I broke his neck, or something o' the like. So off they packed  me to seek thee and escape the law. I was on my way when thou sawest me,  and here I am.\"    \"Well, by the faith of my heart,\" quoth Robin Hood, \"for anyone escaping  the law, thou wast taking it the most easily that ever I beheld in all  my life. Whenever did anyone in all the world see one who had slain a  man, and was escaping because of it, tripping along the highway like a  dainty court damsel, sniffing at a rose the while?\"    \"Nay, uncle,\" answered Will Gamwell, \"overhaste never churned good  butter, as the old saying hath it. Moreover, I do verily believe that  this overstrength of my body hath taken the nimbleness out of my heels.  Why, thou didst but just now rap me thrice, and I thee never a once,  save by overbearing thee by my strength.\"    \"Nay,\" quoth Robin, \"let us say no more on that score. I am right glad  to see thee, Will, and thou wilt add great honor and credit to my band  of merry fellows. But thou must change thy name, for warrants will be  out presently against thee; so, because of thy gay clothes, thou shalt  henceforth and for aye be called Will Scarlet.\"    \"Will Scarlet,\" quoth Little John, stepping forward and reaching out his  great palm, which the other took, \"Will Scarlet, the name fitteth thee  well. Right glad am I to welcome thee among us. I am called Little John;  and this is a new member who has just joined us, a stout tanner named  Arthur a Bland. Thou art like to achieve fame, Will, let me tell thee,  for there will be many a merry ballad sung about the country, and many  a merry story told in Sherwood of how Robin Hood taught Little John and  Arthur a Bland the proper way to use the quarterstaff; likewise, as  it were, how our good master bit off so large a piece of cake that he  choked on it.\"    \"Nay, good Little John,\" quoth Robin gently, for he liked ill to have  such a jest told of him. \"Why should we speak of this little matter?  Prythee, let us keep this day's doings among ourselves.\"    \"With all my heart,\" quoth Little John. \"But, good master, I thought  that thou didst love a merry story, because thou hast so often made a  jest about a certain increase of fatness on my joints, of flesh gathered  by my abiding with the Sheriff of--\"    \"Nay, good Little John,\" said Robin hastily, \"I do bethink me I have  said full enough on that score.\"    \"It is well,\" quoth Little John, \"for in truth I myself have tired of  it somewhat. But now I bethink me, thou didst also seem minded to make a  jest of the rain that threatened last night; so--\"    \"Nay, then,\" said Robin Hood testily, \"I was mistaken. I remember me now  it did seem to threaten rain.\"    \"Truly, I did think so myself,\" quoth Little John, \"therefore, no doubt,  thou dost think it was wise of me to abide all night at the Blue Boar  Inn, instead of venturing forth in such stormy weather; dost thou not?\"    \"A plague of thee and thy doings!\" cried Robin Hood. \"If thou wilt have  it so, thou wert right to abide wherever thou didst choose.\"    \"Once more, it is well,\" quoth Little John. \"As for myself, I have been  blind this day. I did not see thee drubbed; I did not see thee tumbled  heels over head in the dust; and if any man says that thou wert, I can  with a clear conscience rattle his lying tongue betwixt his teeth.\"    \"Come,\" cried Robin, biting his nether lip, while the others could  not forbear laughing. \"We will go no farther today, but will return to  Sherwood, and thou shalt go to Ancaster another time, Little John.\"    So said Robin, for now that his bones were sore, he felt as though a  long journey would be an ill thing for him. So, turning their backs,  they retraced their steps whence they came.          The Adventure with Midge the Miller's Son    WHEN THE four yeomen had traveled for a long time toward Sherwood again,  high noontide being past, they began to wax hungry. Quoth Robin Hood, \"I  would that I had somewhat to eat. Methinks a good loaf of white bread,  with a piece of snow-white cheese, washed down with a draught of humming  ale, were a feast for a king.\"    \"Since thou speakest of it,\" said Will Scarlet, \"methinks it would not  be amiss myself. There is that within me crieth out, 'Victuals, good  friend, victuals!'\"    \"I know a house near by,\" said Arthur a Bland, \"and, had I but the  money, I would bring ye that ye speak of; to wit, a sweet loaf of bread,  a fair cheese, and a skin of brown ale.\"    \"For the matter of that, thou knowest I have money by me, good master,\"  quoth Little John.    \"Why, so thou hast, Little John,\" said Robin. \"How much money will it  take, good Arthur, to buy us meat and drink?\"    \"I think that six broad pennies will buy food enow for a dozen men,\"  said the Tanner.    \"Then give him six pennies, Little John,\" quoth Robin, \"for methinks  food for three men will about fit my need. Now get thee gone, Arthur,  with the money, and bring the food here, for there is a sweet shade in  that thicket yonder, beside the road, and there will we eat our meal.\"    So Little John gave Arthur the money, and the others stepped to the  thicket, there to await the return of the Tanner.    After a time he came back, bearing with him a great brown loaf of bread,  and a fair, round cheese, and a goatskin full of stout March beer, slung  over his shoulders. Then Will Scarlet took his sword and divided  the loaf and the cheese into four fair portions, and each man helped  himself. Then Robin Hood took a deep pull at the beer. \"Aha!\" said he,  drawing in his breath, \"never have I tasted sweeter drink than this.\"    After this no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/965"],[0,"The Black Tulip (#20)"],[1,"in itself a great honour for Cornelius van Baerle to be  confined in the same prison which had once received the learned master  Grotius.    But on arriving at the prison he met with an honour even greater. As  chance would have it, the cell formerly inhabited by the illustrious  Barneveldt happened to be vacant, when the clemency of the Prince of  Orange sent the tulip-fancier Van Baerle there.    The cell had a very bad character at the castle since the time when  Grotius, by means of the device of his wife, made escape from it in that  famous book-chest which the jailers forgot to examine.    On the other hand, it seemed to Van Baerle an auspicious omen that this  very cell was assigned to him, for according to his ideas, a jailer  ought never to have given to a second pigeon the cage from which the  first had so easily flown.    The cell had an historical character. We will only state here that,  with the exception of an alcove which was contrived there for the use  of Madame Grotius, it differed in no respect from the other cells of the  prison; only, perhaps, it was a little higher, and had a splendid view  from the grated window.    Cornelius felt himself perfectly indifferent as to the place where he  had to lead an existence which was little more than vegetation. There  were only two things now for which he cared, and the possession of which  was a happiness enjoyed only in imagination.    A flower, and a woman; both of them, as he conceived, lost to him for  ever.    Fortunately the good doctor was mistaken. In his prison cell the most  adventurous life which ever fell to the lot of any tulip-fancier was  reserved for him.    One morning, whilst at his window inhaling the fresh air which came from  the river, and casting a longing look to the windmills of his dear  old city Dort, which were looming in the distance behind a forest of  chimneys, he saw flocks of pigeons coming from that quarter to perch  fluttering on the pointed gables of Loewestein.    These pigeons, Van Baerle said to himself, are coming from Dort, and  consequently may return there. By fastening a little note to the wing of  one of these pigeons, one might have a chance to send a message there.  Then, after a few moments' consideration, he exclaimed,--    \"I will do it.\"    A man grows very patient who is twenty-eight years of age, and condemned  to a prison for life,--that is to say, to something like twenty-two or  twenty-three thousand days of captivity.    Van Baerle, from whose thoughts the three bulbs were never absent,  made a snare for catching the pigeons, baiting the birds with all the  resources of his kitchen, such as it was for eight slivers (sixpence  English) a day; and, after a month of unsuccessful attempts, he at last  caught a female bird.    It cost him two more months to catch a male bird; he then shut them up  together, and having about the beginning of the year 1673 obtained some  eggs from them, he released the female, which, leaving the male behind  to hatch the eggs in her stead, flew joyously to Dort, with the note  under her wing.    She returned in the evening. She had preserved the note.    Thus it went on for fifteen days, at first to the disappointment, and  then to the great grief, of Van Baerle.    On the sixteenth day, at last, she came back without it.    Van Baerle had addressed it to his nurse, the old Frisian woman; and  implored any charitable soul who might find it to convey it to her as  safely and as speedily as possible.    In this letter there was a little note enclosed for Rosa.    Van Baerle's nurse had received the letter in the following way.    Leaving Dort, Mynheer Isaac Boxtel had abandoned, not only his house,  his servants, his observatory, and his telescope, but also his pigeons.    The servant, having been left without wages, first lived on his little  savings, and then on his master's pigeons.    Seeing this, the pigeons emigrated from the roof of Isaac Boxtel to that  of Cornelius van Baerle.    The nurse was a kind-hearted woman, who could not live without something  to love. She conceived an affection for the pigeons which had thrown  themselves on her hospitality; and when Boxtel's servant reclaimed them  with culinary intentions, having eaten the first fifteen already, and  now wishing to eat the other fifteen, she offered to buy them from him  for a consideration of six stivers per head.    This being just double their value, the man was very glad to close the  bargain, and the nurse found herself in undisputed possession of the  pigeons of her master's envious neighbour.    In the course of their wanderings, these pigeons with others visited  the Hague, Loewestein, and Rotterdam, seeking variety, doubtless, in the  flavour of their wheat or hempseed.    Chance, or rather God, for we can see the hand of God in everything, had  willed that Cornelius van Baerle should happen to hit upon one of these  very pigeons.    Therefore, if the envious wretch had not left Dort to follow his  rival to the Hague in the first place, and then to Gorcum or to  Loewestein,--for the two places are separated only by the confluence of  the Waal and the Meuse,--Van Baerle's letter would have fallen into his  hands and not the nurse's: in which event the poor prisoner, like  the raven of the Roman cobbler, would have thrown away his time, his  trouble, and, instead of having to relate the series of exciting events  which are about to flow from beneath our pen like the varied hues of a  many coloured tapestry, we should have naught to describe but a weary  waste of days, dull and melancholy and gloomy as night's dark mantle.    The note, as we have said, had reached Van Baerle's nurse.    And also it came to pass, that one evening in the beginning of February,  just when the stars were beginning to twinkle, Cornelius heard on the  staircase of the little turret a voice which thrilled through him.    He put his hand on his heart, and listened.    It was the sweet harmonious voice of Rosa.    Let us confess it, Cornelius was not so stupefied with surprise, or  so beyond himself with joy, as he would have been but for the pigeon,  which, in answer to his letter, had brought back hope to him under her  empty wing; and, knowing Rosa, he expected, if the note had ever reached  her, to hear of her whom he loved, and also of his three darling bulbs.    He rose, listened once more, and bent forward towards the door.    Yes, they were indeed the accents which had fallen so sweetly on his  heart at the Hague.    The question now was, whether Rosa, who had made the journey from the  Hague to Loewestein, and who--Cornelius did not understand how--had  succeeded even in penetrating into the prison, would also be fortunate  enough in penetrating to the prisoner himself.    Whilst Cornelius, debating this point within himself, was building all  sorts of castles in the air, and was struggling between hope and fear,  the shutter of the grating in the door opened, and Rosa, beaming with  joy, and beautiful in her pretty national costume--but still more  beautiful from the grief which for the last five months had blanched her  cheeks--pressed her little face against the wire grating of the window,  saying to him,--    \"Oh, sir, sir! here I am!\"    Cornelius stretched out his arms, and, looking to heaven, uttered a cry  of joy,--    \"Oh, Rosa, Rosa!\"    \"Hush! let us speak low: my father follows on my heels,\" said the girl.    \"Your father?\"    \"Yes, he is in the courtyard at the bottom of the staircase, receiving  the instructions of the Governor; he will presently come up.\"    \"The instructions of the Governor?\"    \"Listen to me, I'll try to tell you all in a few words. The Stadtholder  has a country-house, one league distant from Leyden, properly speaking a  kind of large dairy, and my aunt, who was his nurse, has the management  of it. As soon as I received your letter, which, alas! I could not read  myself, but which your housekeeper read to me, I hastened to my aunt;  there I remained until the Prince should come to the dairy; and when he  came, I asked him as a favour to allow my father to exchange his post at  the prison of the Hague with the jailer of the fortress of Loewestein.  The Prince could not have suspected my object; had he known it, he would  have refused my request, but as it is he granted it.\"    \"And so you are here?\"    \"As you see.\"    \"And thus I shall see you every day?\"    \"As often as I can manage it.\"    \"Oh, Rosa, my beautiful Rosa, do you love me a little?\"    \"A little?\" she said, \"you make no great pretensions, Mynheer  Cornelius.\"    Cornelius tenderly stretched out his hands towards her, but they were  only able to touch each other with the tips of their fingers through the  wire grating.    \"Here is my father,\" said she.    Rosa then abruptly drew back from the door, and ran to meet old Gryphus,  who made his appearance at the top of the staircase.          Chapter 15. The Little Grated Window      Gryphus was followed by the mastiff.    The turnkey took the animal round the jail, so that, if needs be, he  might recognize the prisoners.    \"Father,\" said Rosa, \"here is the famous prison from which Mynheer  Grotius escaped. You know Mynheer Grotius?\"    \"Oh, yes, that rogue Grotius, a friend of that villain Barneveldt,  whom I saw executed when I was a child. Ah! so Grotius; and that's the  chamber from which he escaped. Well, I'll answer for it that no one  shall escape after him in my time.\"    And thus opening the door, he began in the dark to talk to the prisoner.    The dog, on his part, went up to the prisoner, and, growling, smelled  about his legs just as though to ask him what right he had still to be  alive, after having left the prison in the company of the Recorder and  the executioner.    But the fair Rosa called him to her side.    \"Well, my master,\" said Gryphus, holding up his lantern to throw a  little light around, \"you see in me your new jailer. I"]]]
