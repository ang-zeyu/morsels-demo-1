Et je me donne a toi, ne sachant rien  Sinon que je m'exalte a te connaitre,  Toujours meilleure et plus pure peut-etre  Depuis que ton doux corps offrit sa fete au mien.    L'amour, oh! qu'il nous soit la clairvoyance  Unique, et l'unique raison du coeur,  A nous, dont le plus fol bonheur  Est d'etre fous de confiance.    Fut-il en nous une seule tendresse,  Une pensee, une joie, une promesse,  Qui n'allat, d'elle-meme, au devant de nos pas?    Fut-il une priere en secret entendue,  Dont nous n'ayons serre les mains tendues  Avec douceur, sur notre sein?    Fut-il un seul appel, un seul dessein,  Un voeu tranquille ou violent  Dont nous n'ayons epanoui l'elan?    Et, nous aimant ainsi,  Nos coeurs s'en sont alles, tels des apotres,  Vers les doux coeurs timides et transis  Des autres:  Ils les ont convies, par la pensee,  A se sentir aux notres fiances,  A proclamer l'amour avec des ardeurs franches,  Comme un peuple de fleurs aime la meme branche  Qui le suspend et le baigne dans le soleil;  Et notre ame, comme agrandie, en cet eveil,  S'est mise a celebrer tout ce qui aime,  Magnifiant l'amour pour l'amour meme,  Et a cherir, divinement, d'un desir fou,  Le monde entier qui se resume en nous.    Le beau jardin fleuri de flammes  Qui nous semblait le double ou le miroir,  Du jardin clair que nous portions dans l'ame,  Se cristallise en gel et or, ce soir.    Un grand silence blanc est descendu s'asseoir  La-bas, aux horizons de marbre,  Vers ou s'en vont, par defiles, les arbres  Avec leur ombre immense et bleue  Et reguliere, a cote d'eux.    Aucun souffle de vent, aucune haleine.  Les grands voiles du froid,  Se deplient seuls, de plaine en plaine,  Sur des marais d'argent ou des routes en croix.    Les etoiles paraissent vivre.  Comme l'acier, brille le givre,  A travers l'air translucide et glace.  De clairs metaux pulverises  A l'infini, semblent neiger  De la paleur d'une lune de cuivre.  Tout est scintillement dans l'immobilite.    Et c'est l'heure divine, ou l'esprit est hante  Par ces mille regards que projette sur terre,  Vers les hasards de l'humaine misere,  La bonne et pure et inchangeable eternite.    S'il arrive jamais  Que nous soyons, sans le savoir,  Souffrance ou peine ou desespoir,  L'un pour l'autre; s'il se faisait  Que la fatigue ou le banal plaisir  Detendissent en nous l'arc d'or du haut desir;  Si le cristal de la pure pensee  De notre amour doit se briser,    Si malgre tout, je me sentais  Vaincu pour n'avoir pas ete  Assez en proie a la divine immensite  De la bonte;  Alors, oh! serrons-nous comme deux fous sublimes  Qui sous les cieux casses, se cramponnent aux cimes  Quand meme.--Et d'un unique essor  L'ame en soleil, s'exaltent dans la mort."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10065"],[0,"The Constitution of the United States (#3)"],[1,"tion, as they  entered upon their momentous task, were the mighty shades of Simon de  Montfort, Coke, Sandys, Bacon, Eliot, Hampden, Lilburne, Milton,  Shaftesbury and Locke. Could there be a better illustration of Sir  Frederick Pollock's noble tribute to the genius of the common law:        \"Remember that Our Lady, the Common Law, is not a task-mistress, but      a bountiful sovereign, whose service is freedom. The destinies of      the English-speaking world are bound up with her fortunes and      migrations and its conquests are justified by her works\"?    Another reason makes the consideration of the subject not only  interesting but opportune. \"These are the times that try men's souls.\"  It is a time of sifting, when men of all nations in civilization in  these critical days are again testing the value even of those political  institutions which have the sanction of the past. Society is in a state  of flux. Everywhere the foundations of governmental structures seem to  be settling--let us hope and pray upon a _surer_ foundation--and when  the seismic convulsion of the world war is taken into account, it is not  surprising that this is so. While the storm is not yet past and the  waves have not wholly subsided, it is natural that everywhere thoughtful  men as true mariners are taking their reckonings to know where they are  and whether the frail bark of human institutions is still sufficiently  seaworthy to keep afloat.    Moreover, the patent evidences of weakness in the international  organization that we call civilization, the imperative need of ending  the spirit of moral anarchy, and the urgent necessity of rebuilding the  shattered ruins of the social edifice on surer foundations by the  integration of the nations, if possible, into some new form of world  organization, gives peculiar interest in these terrible days to the  manner in which the American people solved a similar problem more than a  century ago.    Then, as now, a world war had ended. Then, as now, half the world was  prostrated by the wounds of fratricidal strife. As Washington said: \"The  whole world was in an uproar,\" and he added that the task \"was to steer  safely between Scylla and Charybdis.\" The problem, then as now, was not  only to make \"the world safe for democracy,\" but to make democracy, for  which there is no alternative, safe for the world. The thirteen colonies  in 1787, while small and relatively unimportant, were, however, a little  world in themselves, and, relatively to their numbers and resources,  this problem, which they confronted and solved, differed in degree but  not in kind from that which now confronts civilization. Impoverished in  resources, exhausted by the loss of the flower of their youth,  demoralized by the reaction from feverish strife, the forces of  disintegration had set in in the United States between 1783 and 1787.  Law and order had almost perished and the provisional government had  been reduced to impotence. A few wise and noble spirits, true Faithfuls  and Great Hearts, led a despondent people out of the Slough of Despond  till their feet were again on firm ground and their faces turned towards  the Delectable Mountains of peace, justice, and liberty. Let it be  emphasized that they did this, not by seeking more power, but by  imposing restraints upon themselves. That spirit of self-restraint is  the essence of the American Constitution.    So enduring was their achievement that to-day the Constitution of the  United States is the oldest comprehensive written form of government now  existing in the world. Few, if any, forms of government have better  withstood the mad spirit of innovation, or more effectively proved their  merit by the \"arduous greatness of things done.\"    For this reason, as the nations of the world are now trying in a cosmic  form and under similar conditions to do that which the founders of the  American Republic in 1787 did in a microcosmic form, a short narration  of that earlier achievement may not be unprofitable in this day and  generation, when we are blindly groping towards some common basis for  international co-ordination.    One of England's greatest Prime Ministers, William Pitt, shortly after  the adoption of the Constitution, prophetically said that it would be  the admiration of the future ages and the pattern for future  constitution building. Time has verified his prediction, for  constitution making has been, since the American Constitution was  adopted, a continuous industry. The American Constitution has been the  classic model for the federated State. Lieber estimated that three  hundred and fifty constitutions were made in the first sixty years of  the nineteenth century, and, in the constituent States of the American  Union, one hundred and three new Constitutions were promulgated in the  first century of the United States.    \"Have you a copy of the French Constitution?\" was asked of a bookseller  during the second French Empire, and the characteristically witty Gallic  reply was: \"We do not deal in periodical literature.\"    Constitutions, as governmental panaceas, have come and gone; but it can  be said of the American Constitution, paraphrasing the noble tribute of  Dr. Johnson to the immortal fame of Shakespeare, that the stream of  time, which has washed away the dissoluble fabric of many other paper  constitutions has left almost untouched its adamantine strength.  Excepting the first ten amendments, which were virtually a part of the  original charter, only nine others have been adopted in more than one  hundred and thirty years.    A constitution, while primarily for the distribution of governmental  powers, is, in its last analysis, a formal expression of adherence to  that which in modern times has been called the higher law, and which in  ancient times was called natural law. The jurisprudence of every nation  has, with more or less clearness, recognized the existence of certain  primal and fundamental laws which are superior to the laws, statutes, or  conventions of living generations. The original use of the term was to  import the superiority of the Imperial edict to the laws of the Comitia.  All nations have recognized this higher law to a greater or less extent.  If we turn to the writings of the most intellectual race in ancient  time and possibly in recorded history--the Greeks--we shall see the  higher law vindicated with incomparable power in the moral philosophy of  its three greatest dramatists, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. How  was it better expressed than by Antigone when she was asked whether she  had transgressed the laws of the state and replied:        \"Yes, for that law was not from Zeus, nor did Justice, dweller with      the gods below, establish it among men; nor deemed I that thy      decree--mere mortal that thou art--could override those unwritten      and unfailing mandates, which are not of to-day or yesterday, but      ever live and no one knows their birthtide.\"    Five centuries later the greatest of the Roman lawyers and orators,  Cicero, spoke in the same terms of a higher law, \"which was never  written and which we are never taught, which we never team by reading,  but which was drawn by nature herself.\"    The Roman jurists gave it express recognition. They always recognized  the distinction between _jus civile_, or the law of the State, and the  _jus naturale_, or the law of Nature. They nobly conceived that human  society was a single unit and that it was governed by a law that was  both antecedent and paramount to the law of Rome. Thus, the idea of a  higher law transcending the power of a living generation, and therefore  eternal as justice itself--became lodged in our system of jurisprudence.  Nor was the Common Law wanting in a recognition of a higher law that  would curb the power of King or Parliament, for its earlier masters,  including four Chief Justices (Coke, Hobart, Holt, and Popham),  supported the doctrine, as laid down by Coke, that the judiciary had the  power to nullify a law if it were \"against common right and  reason.\"--(_Bonham's Case_, 8 Coke Reports, 114.)    This view as to the limitation of government and the denial of its  omnipotence was powerfully accentuated in America by the very conditions  of its colonization. The good yeomen of England who journeyed to America  went in the spirit of the noble and intrepid Kent, when, turning his  back upon King Lear's temporary injustice, he said that he would \"shape  his old course in a country new.\" Was it strange that the early  colonists, as they braved the hardships and perils of a dangerous  voyage, only to be confronted in the wilderness by disease, famine and  massacre, should fall back for their own government upon these primal  verities of human society, and claim not only their inherited rights as  Englishmen, but also the peculiar privileges of pioneers in an  unconquered wilderness?    This spirit of constitutionalism in America, which culminated in the  Constitution of the United States, had its institutional origin in the  spacious days of Queen Elizabeth. That wonderful age, which gave to the  world not only Shakespeare, Spenser and Jonson, but also Drake,  Frobisher and Raleigh, was the Anglo-Saxon reaction to the Renaissance.  The spirit of man had a new birth and was breaking away from the too  rigid bonds of ancient custom and authority.    Among the notable, but little known, leaders of that time was Sir Edwin  Sandys, the leading spirit of the London (or Virginia) company. He was a  Liberal when to be such was an \"extra hazardous risk.\" He was the son of  a Liberal, for his father, a great prelate, had been sent to the Tower  for preaching in defence of Lady Jane Grey. The son, Sir Edwin, was the  foe of monopolies, and in the same Parliament that impeached the great  genius of this Inn, Francis Bacon, Sandys advocated the then novel  proposition that accused prisoners should have the right to be"]]]
