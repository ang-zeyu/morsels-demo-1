But even thus the good far predominates. The  elective system has destroyed the class games, and our institutions  have no units like the English colleges to be pitted against each  other, and so colleges grow, an ever smaller percentage of students  obtain the benefit of practise on the teams, while electioneering  methods often place second-best men in place of the best. But both  students and teachers are slowly learning wisdom in the dear school of  experience. On the whole, there is less license in \"breaking training\"  and in celebrating victories, and even at their worst, good probably  predominates, while the progress of recent years bids us hope.    Finally, military ideals and methods of psycho-physical education are  helpful regulations of the appetite for combat, and on the whole more  wholesome and robust than those which are merely esthetic. Marching in  step gives proper and uniform movement of legs, arms, and carriage of  body; the manual of arms, with evolution and involution of figures in  the ranks, gives each a corporate feeling of membership, and involves  care of personal appearance and accouterments, while the uniform  levels social distinction in dress. For the French and Italian and  especially the German and Russian adolescent of the lower classes, the  two or three years of compulsory military service is often compared to  an academic course, and the army is called, not without some  justification, the poor man's university. It gives severe drill,  strict discipline, good and regular hours, plain but wholesome fare  and out-of-door exercise, exposure, travel, habits of neatness, many  useful knacks and devices, tournaments and mimic or play battles;  these, apart from its other functions, make this system a great  promoter of national health and intelligence. Naval schools for  midshipmen, who serve before the mast, schools on board ship that  visit a wide curriculum of ports each year, cavalry schools, where  each boy is given a horse to care for, study and train, artillery  courses and even an army drill-master in an academy, or uniform, and a  few exterior features of soldierly life, all give a distinct character  to the spirit of any institution. The very fancy of being in any sense  a soldier opens up a new range of interests too seldom utilized; and  tactics, army life and service, military history, battles, patriotism,  the flag, and duties to country, should always erect a new standard of  honor. Youth should embrace every opportunity that offers in this  line, and instruction should greatly increase the intellectual  opportunities created by every interest in warfare. It would be easy  to create pregnant courses on how soldiers down the course of history  have lived, thought, felt, fought, and died, how great battles were  won and what causes triumphed in them, and to generalize many of the  best things taught in detail in the best schools of war in different  grades and lands.    A subtle but potent intersexual influence is among the strongest  factors of all adolescent sport. Male birds and beasts show off their  charms of beauty and accomplishment in many a liturgy of love antics  in the presence of the female. This instinct seems somehow continuous  with the growth of ornaments in the mating season. Song, tumbling,  balking, mock fights, etc., are forms of animal courtship. The boy who  turns cartwheels past the home of the girl of his fancy, is brilliant,  brave, witty, erect, strong in her presence, and elsewhere dull and  commonplace enough, illustrates the same principle. The true cake-walk  as seen in the South is perhaps the purest expression of this impulse  to courtship antics seen in man, but its irradiations are many and  pervasive. The presence of the fair sex gives tonicity to youth's  muscles and tension to his arteries to a degree of which he is rarely  conscious. Defeat in all contests is more humiliating and victory more  glorious thereby. Each sex is constantly passing the examination of  the other, and each judges the other by standards different from its  own. Alas for the young people who are not different with the other  sex from what they are with their own!--and some are transformed into  different beings. Achievement proclaims ability to support, defend,  bring credit and even fame to the object of future choice, and no good  point is lost. Physical force and skill, and above all, victory and  glory, make a hero and invest him with a romantic glamour, which, even  though concealed by conventionality or etiquette, is profoundly felt  and makes the winner more or less irresistible. The applause of men  and of mates is sweet and even intoxicating, but that of ladies is  ravishing. By universal acclaim the fair belong to the brave, strong,  and victorious. This stimulus is wholesome and refining. As is shown  later, a bashful youth often selects a maiden onlooker and is  sometimes quite unconsciously dominated in his every movement by a  sense of her presence, stranger and apparently unnoticed though she  be, although in the intellectual work of coeducation girls are most  influenced thus. In athletics this motive makes for refinement and  good form. The ideal knight, however fierce and terrible, must not be  brutal, but show capacity for fine feeling, tenderness, magnanimity,  and forbearance. Evolutionists tell us that woman has domesticated and  educated savage man and taught him all his virtues by exercising her  royal prerogative of selecting in her mate just those qualities that  pleased her for transmission to future generations and eliminating  others distasteful to her. If so, she is still engaged in this work as  much as ever, and in his dull, slow way man feels that her presence  enforces her standards, abhorrent though it would be to him to  compromise in one iota his masculinity. Most plays and games in which  both sexes participate have some of the advantages with some of the  disadvantages of coeducation. Where both are partners rather than  antagonists, there is less eviration. A gallant man would do his best  to help, but his worst not to beat a lady. Thus, in general, the  latter performs her best in her true rule of sympathetic spectator  rather than as fellow player, and is now an important factor in the  physical education of adolescents.    How pervasive this femininity is, which is slowly transforming our  schools, is strikingly seen in the church. Gulick holds that the  reason why only some seven per cent of the young men of the country  are in the churches, while most members and workers are women, is that  the qualities demanded are the feminine ones of love, rest, prayer,  trust, desire for fortitude to endure, a sense of atonement--traits  not involving ideals that most stir young men. The church has not yet  learned to appeal to the more virile qualities. Fielding Hall[14] asks  why Christ and Buddha alone of great religious teachers were rejected  by their own race and accepted elsewhere. He answers that these mild  beliefs of peace, nonresistance, and submission, rejected by virile  warrior races, Jews and ancient Hindus, were adopted where women were  free and led in these matters. Confucianism, Mohammedanism, etc., are  virile, and so indigenous, and in such forms of faith and worship  women have small place. This again suggests how the sex that rules the  heart controls men.    Too much can hardly be said in favor of cold baths and swimming at  this age. Marro[15] quotes Father Kneipp, and almost rivals his  hydrotherapeutic enthusiasm. Cold bathing sends the blood inward  partly by the cold which contracts the capillaries of the skin and  tissue immediately underlying it, and partly by the pressure of the  water over all the dermal surface, quickens the activity of kidneys,  lungs, and digestive apparatus, and the reactive glow is the best  possible tonic for dermal circulation. It is the best of all  gymnastics for the nonstriated or involuntary muscles and for the  heart and blood vessels. This and the removal of the products of  excretion preserve all the important dermal functions which are so  easily and so often impaired in modern life, lessen the liability to  skin diseases, promote freshness of complexion; and the moral effects  of plunging into cold and supporting the body in deep water is not  inconsiderable in strengthening a spirit of hardihood and reducing  overtenderness to sensory discomforts. The exercise of swimming is  unique in that nearly all the movements and combinations are such as  are rarely used otherwise, and are perhaps in a sense ancestral and  liberal rather than directly preparatory for future avocations. Its  stimulus for heart and lungs is, by general consent of all writers  upon the subject, most wholesome and beneficial. Nothing so directly  or quickly reduces to the lowest point the plethora of the sex organs.  The very absence of clothes and running on the beach is exhilarating  and gives a sense of freedom. Where practicable it is well to dispense  with bathing suits, even the scantiest. The warm bath tub is  enfeebling and degenerative, despite the cold spray later, while the  free swim in cold water is most invigorating.    Happily, city officials, teachers, and sanitarians are now slowly  realizing the great improvement in health and temper that comes from  bathing and are establishing beach and surf, spray, floating and  plunge summer baths and swimming pools; often providing instruction  even in swimming in clothes, undressing in the water, treading water,  and rescue work, free as well as fee days, bathing suits, and, in  London, places for nude bathing after dark; establishing time and  distance standards with certificates and even prizes;"]]]
