It is of fundamental importance in most  branches of geometry, and the basis of the whole of trigonometry--the  special branch of geometry that deals with the practical mensuration of  triangles. EUCLID devoted the whole of the first book of his _Elements  of Geometry_ to establishing the truth of this theorem; how PYTHAGORAS  demonstrated it we unfortunately do not know.      (1) Fig. 3 affords an interesting practical demonstration of the truth  of this theorem. If the reader will copy this figure, cut out the  squares on the two shorter sides of the triangle and divide them along  the lines AD, BE, EF, he will find that the five pieces so obtained can  be made exactly to fit the square on the longest side as shown by the  dotted lines. The size and shape of the triangle ABC, so long as it  has a right angle at C, is immaterial. The lines AD, BE are obtained  by continuing the sides of the square on the side AB, _i.e_. the side  opposite the right angle, and EF is drawn at right angles to BE.    After absorbing what knowledge was to be gained in Egypt, PYTHAGORAS  journeyed to Babylon, where he probably came into contact with even  greater traditions and more potent influences and sources of knowledge  than in Egypt, for there is reason for believing that the ancient  Chaldeans were the builders of the Pyramids and in many ways the  intellectual superiors of the Egyptians.    At last, after having travelled still further East, probably as far as  India, PYTHAGORAS returned to his birthplace to teach the men of his  native land the knowledge he had gained. But CROESUS was tyrant over  Samos, and so oppressive was his rule that none had leisure in which to  learn. Not a student came to PYTHAGORAS, until, in despair, so the story  runs, he offered to pay an artisan if he would but learn geometry. The  man accepted, and later, when PYTHAGORAS pretended inability any longer  to continue the payments, he offered, so fascinating did he find  the subject, to pay his teacher instead if the lessons might only be  continued. PYTHAGORAS no doubt was much gratified at this; and the  motto he adopted for his great Brotherhood, of which we shall make the  acquaintance in a moment, was in all likelihood based on this event. It  ran, \"Honour a figure and a step before a figure and a tribolus\"; or, as  a freer translation renders it:--    \"A figure and a step onward Not a figure and a florin.\"      \"At all events,\" as Mr FRANKLAND remarks, \"the motto is a lasting witness  to a very singular devotion to knowledge for its own sake.\"(1)      (1) W. B. FRANKLAND, M.A.: _The Story of Euclid_ (1902), p. 33    But PYTHAGORAS needed a greater audience than one man, however  enthusiastic a pupil he might be, and he left Samos for Southern  Italy, the rich inhabitants of whose cities had both the leisure and  inclination to study. Delphi, far-famed for its Oracles, was visited _en  route_, and PYTHAGORAS, after a sojourn at Tarentum, settled at Croton,  where he gathered about him a great band of pupils, mainly young people  of the aristocratic class. By consent of the Senate of Croton, he formed  out of these a great philosophical brotherhood, whose members lived  apart from the ordinary people, forming, as it were, a separate  community. They were bound to PYTHAGORAS by the closest ties of  admiration and reverence, and, for years after his death, discoveries  made by Pythagoreans were invariably attributed to the Master, a fact  which makes it very difficult exactly to gauge the extent of PYTHAGORAS'  own knowledge and achievements. The regime of the Brotherhood, or  Pythagorean Order, was a strict one, entailing \"high thinking and low  living\" at all times. A restricted diet, the exact nature of which is  in dispute, was observed by all members, and long periods of silence, as  conducive to deep thinking, were imposed on novices. Women were admitted  to the Order, and PYTHAGORAS' asceticism did not prohibit romance,  for we read that one of his fair pupils won her way to his heart, and,  declaring her affection for him, found it reciprocated and became his  wife.    SCHURE writes: \"By his marriage with Theano, Pythagoras affixed _the  seal of realization_ to his work. The union and fusion of the two lives  was complete. One day when the master's wife was asked what length of  time elapsed before a woman could become pure after intercourse with a  man, she replied: 'If it is with her husband, she is pure all the time;  if with another man, she is never pure.'\" \"Many women,\" adds the writer,  \"would smilingly remark that to give such a reply one must be the wife  of Pythagoras, and love him as Theano did. And they would be in the  right, for it is not marriage that sanctifies love, it is love which  justifies marriage.\"(1)      (1) EDOUARD SCHURE: _Pythagoras and the Delphic Mysteries_, trans. by F.  ROTHWELL, B.A. (1906), pp. 164 and 165.      PYTHAGORAS was not merely a mathematician, he was first and foremost a  philosopher, whose philosophy found in number the basis of all things,  because number, for him, alone possessed stability of relationship. As I  have remarked on a former occasion, \"The theory that the Cosmos has its  origin and explanation in Number... is one for which it is not difficult  to account if we take into consideration the nature of the times in  which it was formulated. The Greek of the period, looking upon Nature,  beheld no picture of harmony, uniformity and fundamental unity. The  outer world appeared to him rather as a discordant chaos, the mere sport  and plaything of the gods. The theory of the uniformity of Nature--that  Nature is ever like to herself--the very essence of the modern  scientific spirit, had yet to be born of years of unwearied labour  and unceasing delving into Nature's innermost secrets. Only in  Mathematics--in the properties of geometrical figures, and of  numbers--was the reign of law, the principle of harmony, perceivable.  Even at this present day when the marvellous has become commonplace,  that property of right-angled triangles... already discussed... comes  to the mind as a remarkable and notable fact: it must have seemed a  stupendous marvel to its discoverer, to whom, it appears, the regular  alternation of the odd and even numbers, a fact so obvious to us that  we are inclined to attach no importance to it, seemed, itself, to be  something wonderful. Here in Geometry and Arithmetic, here was order and  harmony unsurpassed and unsurpassable. What wonder then that Pythagoras  concluded that the solution of the mighty riddle of the Universe was  contained in the mysteries of Geometry? What wonder that he read mystic  meanings into the laws of Arithmetic, and believed Number to be the  explanation and origin of all that is?\"(1)      (1) _A Mathematical Theory of Spirit_ (1912), pp. 64-65.      No doubt the Pythagorean theory suffers from a defect similar to that  of the Kabalistic doctrine, which, starting from the fact that all words  are composed of letters, representing the primary sounds of language,  maintained that all the things represented by these words were created  by God by means of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. But at  the same time the Pythagorean theory certainly embodies a considerable  element of truth. Modern science demonstrates nothing more clearly  than the importance of numerical relationships. Indeed, \"the history of  science shows us the gradual transformation of crude facts of experience  into increasingly exact generalisations by the application to them of  mathematics. The enormous advances that have been made in recent years  in physics and chemistry are very largely due to mathematical methods  of interpreting and co-ordinating facts experimentally revealed, whereby  further experiments have been suggested, the results of which have  themselves been mathematically interpreted. Both physics and chemistry,  especially the former, are now highly mathematical. In the biological  sciences and especially in psychology it is true that mathematical  methods are, as yet, not so largely employed. But these sciences are far  less highly developed, far less exact and systematic, that is to say,  far less scientific, at present, than is either physics or chemistry.  However, the application of statistical methods promises good results,  and there are not wanting generalisations already arrived at which  are expressible mathematically; Weber's Law in psychology, and the law  concerning the arrangement of the leaves about the stems of plants in  biology, may be instanced as cases in point.\"(1)      (1) Quoted from a lecture by the present writer on \"The Law of  Correspondences Mathematically Considered,\" delivered before The  Theological and Philosophical Society on 26th April 1912, and published  in _Morning Light_, vol. xxxv (1912), p. 434 _et seq_.      The Pythagorean doctrine of the Cosmos, in its most reasonable form,  however, is confronted with one great difficulty which it seems  incapable of overcoming, namely, that of continuity. Modern science,  with its atomic theories of matter and electricity, does, indeed, show  us that the apparent continuity of material things is spurious, that all  material things consist of discrete particles, and are hence measurable  in numerical terms. But modern science is also obliged to postulate an  ether behind these atoms, an ether which is wholly continuous, and hence  transcends the domain of number.(1) It is true that, in quite recent  times, a certain school of thought has argued that the ether is  also atomic in constitution--that all things, indeed, have a grained  structure, even forces being made up of a large number of quantums  or indivisible units of force. But this view has not gained general  acceptance, and it seems to necessitate the postulation of an ether  beyond the ether, filling the interspaces"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12753"],[0,"The Legends of King Arthur and His Knights (#3)"],[1,"soon a proper fuel, ceased  not to rage, till spreading to a mighty conflagration, they burned down  the tower and Vortigern within it.    Then did Aurelius turn his strength against Hengist and the Saxons, and,  defeating them in many places, weakened their power for a long season, so  that the land had peace.    Anon the king, making many journeys to and fro, restoring ruined churches  and, creating order, came to the monastery near Salisbury, where all those  British knights lay buried who had been slain there by the treachery of  Hengist. For when in former times Hengist had made a solemn truce with  Vortigern, to meet in peace and settle terms, whereby himself and all his  Saxons should depart from Britain, the Saxon soldiers carried every one of  them beneath his garment a long dagger, and, at a given signal, fell upon  the Britons, and slew them, to the number of nearly five hundred.    The sight of the place where the dead lay moved Aurelius to great sorrow,  and he cast about in his mind how to make a worthy tomb over so many noble  martyrs, who had died there for their country.    When he had in vain consulted many craftsmen and builders, he sent, by the  advice of the archbishop, for Merlin, and asked him what to do. \"If you  would honour the burying-place of these men,\" said Merlin, \"with an  everlasting monument, send for the Giants' Dance which is in Killaraus, a  mountain in Ireland; for there is a structure of stone there which none of  this age could raise without a perfect knowledge of the arts. They are  stones of a vast size and wondrous nature, and if they can be placed here  as they are there, round this spot of ground, they will stand for ever.\"    At these words of Merlin, Aurelius burst into laughter, and said, \"How is  it possible to remove such vast stones from so great a distance, as if  Britain, also, had no stones fit for the work?\"    \"I pray the king,\" said Merlin, \"to forbear vain laughter; what I have  said is true, for those stones are mystical and have healing virtues. The  giants of old brought them from the furthest coast of Africa, and placed  them in Ireland while they lived in that country: and their design was to  make baths in them, for use in time of grievous illness. For if they  washed the stones and put the sick into the water, it certainly healed  them, as also it did them that were wounded in battle; and there is no  stone among them but hath the same virtue still.\"    When the Britons heard this, they resolved to send for the stones, and to  make war upon the people of Ireland if they offered to withhold them. So,  when they had chosen Uther the king's brother for their chief, they set  sail, to the number of 15,000 men, and came to Ireland. There Gillomanius,  the king, withstood them fiercely, and not till after a great battle could  they approach the Giants' Dance, the sight of which filled them with joy  and admiration. But when they sought to move the stones, the strength of  all the army was in vain, until Merlin, laughing at their failures,  contrived machines of wondrous cunning, which took them down with ease,  and placed them in the ships.    When they had brought the whole to Salisbury, Aurelius, with the crown  upon his head, kept for four days the feast of Pentecost with royal pomp;  and in the midst of all the clergy and the people, Merlin raised up the  stones, and set them round the sepulchre of the knights and barons, as  they stood in the mountains of Ireland.    Then was the monument called \"Stonehenge,\" which stands, as all men know,  upon the plain of Salisbury to this very day.    Soon thereafter it befell that Aurelius was slain by poison at Winchester,  and was himself buried within the Giants' Dance.    At the same time came forth a comet of amazing size and brightness,  darting out a beam, at the end whereof was a cloud of fire shaped like a  dragon, from whose mouth went out two rays, one stretching over Gaul, the  other ending in seven lesser rays over the Irish sea.    At the appearance of this star a great dread fell upon the people, and  Uther, marching into Cambria against the son of Vortigern, himself was  very troubled to learn what it might mean. Then Merlin, being called  before him, cried with a loud voice: \"O mighty loss! O stricken Britain!  Alas! the great prince is gone from us. Aurelius Ambrosius is dead, whose  death will be ours also, unless God help us. Haste, therefore, noble  Uther, to destroy the enemy; the victory shall be thine, and thou shalt be  king of all Britain. For the star with the fiery dragon signifies thyself;  and the ray over Gaul portends that thou shalt have a son, most mighty,  whom all those kingdoms shall obey which the ray covers.\"    Thus, for the second time, did Merlin foretell the coming of King Arthur.  And Uther, when he was made king, remembered Merlin's words, and caused  two dragons to be made in gold, in likeness of the dragon he had seen in  the star. One of these he gave to Winchester Cathedral, and had the other  carried into all his wars before him, whence he was ever after called  Uther Pendragon, or the dragon's head.    Now, when Uther Pendragon had passed through all the land, and settled  it--and even voyaged into all the countries of the Scots, and tamed the  fierceness of that rebel people--he came to London, and ministered justice  there. And it befell at a certain great banquet and high feast which the  king made at Easter-tide, there came, with many other earls and barons,  Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall, and his wife Igerna, who was the most famous  beauty in all Britain. And soon thereafter, Gorlois being slain in battle,  Uther determined to make Igerna his own wife. But in order to do this, and  enable him to come to her--for she was shut up in the high castle of  Tintagil, on the furthest coast of Cornwall--the king sent for Merlin, to  take counsel with him and to pray his help. This, therefore, Merlin  promised him on one condition--namely, that the king should give him up  the first son born of the marriage. For Merlin by his arts foreknew that  this firstborn should be the long-wished prince, King Arthur.    When Uther, therefore, was at length happily wedded, Merlin came to the  castle on a certain day, and said, \"Sir, thou must now provide thee for  the nourishing of thy child.\"    And the king, nothing doubting, said, \"Be it as thou wilt.\"    \"I know a lord of thine in this land,\" said Merlin, \"who is a man both  true and faithful; let him have the nourishing of the child. His name is  Sir Ector, and he hath fair possessions both in England and in Wales.  When, therefore, the child is born, let him be delivered unto me,  unchristened, at yonder postern-gate, and I will bestow him in the care of  this good knight.\"    So when the child was born, the king bid two knights and two ladies to  take it, bound in rich cloth of gold, and deliver it to a poor man whom  they should discover at the postern-gate. And the child being delivered  thus to Merlin, who himself took the guise of a poor man, was carried by  him to a holy priest and christened by the name of Arthur, and then was  taken to Sir Ector's house, and nourished at Sir Ector's wife's own  breasts. And in the same house he remained privily for many years, no man  soever knowing where he was, save Merlin and the king.    Anon it befell that the king was seized by a lingering distemper, and the  Saxon heathens, taking their occasion, came back from over sea, and  swarmed upon the land, wasting it with fire and sword. When Uther heard  thereof, he fell into a greater rage than his weakness could bear, and  commanded all his nobles to come before him, that he might upbraid them  for their cowardice. And when he had sharply and hotly rebuked them, he  swore that he himself, nigh unto death although he lay, would lead them  forth against the enemy. Then causing a horse-litter to be made, in which  he might be carried--for he was too faint and weak to ride--he went up  with all his army swiftly against the Saxons.    But they, when they heard that Uther was coming in a litter, disdained to  fight with him, saying it would be shame for brave men to fight with one  half dead. So they retired into their city; and, as it were in scorn of  danger, left the gates wide open. But Uther straightway commanding his men  to assault the town, they did so without loss of time, and had already  reached the gates, when the Saxons, repenting too late of their haughty  pride, rushed forth to the defence. The battle raged till night, and was  begun again next day; but at last, their leaders, Octa and Eosa, being  slain, the Saxons turned their backs and fled, leaving the Britons a full  triumph.    The king at this felt so great joy, that, whereas before he could scarce  raise himself without help, he now sat upright in his litter by himself,  and said, with a laughing and merry face, \"They called me the half-dead  king, and so indeed I was; but victory to me half dead is better than  defeat and the best health. For to die with honour is far better than to  live disgraced.\"    But the Saxons, although thus defeated, were ready still for war. Uther  would have pursued them; but his illness had by now so grown, that his  knights and barons kept him from the adventure. Whereat the enemy took  courage, and left nothing undone to destroy the land; until, descending to  the vilest treachery, they resolved to kill the king by poison.    To this end, as he lay sick at Verulam, they sent and poisoned stealthily  a spring of clear water, whence he was wont to drink daily; and so, on the  very next day, he was taken with the pains of death, as were also a  hundred others after him, before the villainy was discovered, and heaps of  earth thrown over the well.    The knights and barons, full of sorrow, now took counsel together, and  came to Merlin for his help to learn the king's will before he died, for  he was by this time speechless. \"Sirs, "]]]
