When \"a horrible tempest\" occurs, they puff and blow to  represent a storm; or should he mention \"the cries of the righteous in  distress,\" they all set up a loud screaming; and it not unfrequently  happens, that while some are still blowing the storm, others have already  begun the cries of the righteous, thus forming a concert which it is  difficult for any but a zealous Hebrew to hear with gravity.      CHARACTER OF THE KARPIANS, (ARABS.)      They are such consummate thieves and rogues, that, according to an ancient  tradition still current among them, they once tricked the devil himself.  The story is as follows:--The devil had acquired a right to their fields,  on which they agreed with him, that when their crops were ripe, they should  retain the upper part and the devil should have the lower. They sowed all  their lands with wheat, and the devil of course had nothing but the straw  for his share. Next year the old gentleman, fully determined not to be  again so bamboozled, stipulated that the upper part should belong to him  and the lower to the Karpians; but then they sowed all their grounds with  beet, turnips, and other esculent roots, and so the devil got nothing but  the green tops for his portion.    _Memoirs of Artemi._      THE MODERN WELSH.      The people of the principality are clean and industrious; there is,  however, in the nature of a Welshman such a hurriness of manner and want of  method, that he does nothing well; for his mind is over anxious, diverted  from one labour to another, and hence every thing is incomplete, and leaves  the appearance of confusion and negligence. The common exercises of the  Welsh are running, leaping, swimming, wrestling, throwing the bar,  dancing, hunting, fishing, and playing at fives against the church or  tower; and they constitute the joy of youth, and the admiration of old age.  The convivial amusements are singing and versification. In these favourite  exercises the performers are of humble merit; the singing is mere roar and  squeak; and the poetical effusions are nonsense, vested in the rags of  language; and always slanderous, because the mind of the bard is not  fertile in the production of topics. The Welsh character is the echo of  natural feeling, and acts from instantaneous motives. The fine arts are  strangers to the principality; and the Welshman seldom professes the  buskin, or the use of the mallet, the graver, or the chisel; but although  deficient in taste, he excels in duties and in intellect.    _Jones's History of Wales._      ITALIAN WOMEN.      Italy and England are undoubtedly possessed of a greater share of female  beauty than any other country in Europe. But the English and Italian  beauties, although both interesting, are very different from one another.  The former are unrivalled for the delicacy and bloom of their complexions,  the smoothness and mild expression of their features, their modest  carriage, and the cleanliness of their persons and dress; these are  qualities which strike every foreigner at his landing. On my first arrival  in England, I was asked by a friend how I liked the English women; to which  I replied that I thought them all handsome. This is the first impression  they produce. There is an air of calmness and pensiveness about them, which  surprises and interests particularly a native of the south. They seem to  look, if I may apply to them the fine lines of one of their living poets--      \"With eyes so pure, that from the ray    Dark vice would turn abash'd away;           *       *       *       *       *      Yet fill'd with all youth's sweet desires,    Mingling the meek and vestal fires    Of other worlds, with all the bliss    The fond weak tenderness of this.\"    The Italian beauties are of a different kind. Their features are more  regular, more animated; their complexions bear the marks of a warmer sun,  and their eyes seem to participate of its fires; their carriage is graceful  and noble; they have generally good figures; they are not indeed angelic  forms, but they are earthly Venuses. It has been supposed by some, that the  habitual view of those models of ideal beauty, the Greek statues, with  which Italy abounds, may be an indirect cause conducing to the general  beauty of the sex; be that as it may, I think the fine features and  beautiful forms of the Italian fair have a great influence upon the minds  of young artists, and this is perhaps one of the principal reasons why  Italy has so long excelled in figure painters. A handsome female  countenance, animated by the expression of the soul, is among the finest  works of nature; the sight of it elevates the mind, and kindles the sparks  of genius. Raphael took the models of his charming Madonnas from nature.  Titian, Guido, Caracci, and others, derived their ideas of female beauty  from the exquisite countenances so frequent in their native country.    _Italy in the Nineteenth Century._           *       *       *       *       *        MY COMMON-PLACE BOOK.    No. XXII.           *       *       *       *       *      A LINNET AT SEA.      It has been often observed, that birds, in the course of their flight from  one country to another, will frequently resort to the rigging of a ship, as  a resting-place in their transit across the wide ocean. Mr. Gray, in his  \"Letters on Canada,\" gives the following instance:--Among the extraordinary  things, he observes, one meets with at sea, it is not one of the least  surprising to observe small _land birds_ several hundred miles from land. I  was sitting on deck, when, to my great surprise, my attention was arrested  by the warbling of a bird. I looked up, and saw a _linnet_ perched on the  rigging, and whistling with as much ardour as if on a bush in a green  meadow. It is not a little astonishing how these little birds should be  able to continue on the wing so long as is necessary to fly several  hundreds of miles, particularly when the usual shortness of their flight is  considered. They continue sometimes with a vessel several days, and are  frequently caught by the sailors; but it is remarked that they seldom live,  though every care is taken to give them proper food. When the vessel rolls  much, they find it difficult to retain their footing on the rigging, and  you see them forced, as it were, to resume their flight in search of a  better resting-place.      THE ADVANTAGES OF AFFLICTION.          Behold this vine,    I found it a wild tree, whose wanton strength    Had swollen into irregular twigs    And bold excrescences,    And spent itself in leaves and little rings;    So in the flourish of its outwardness    Wasting the sap and strength    That should have given forth fruit;    But when I pruned the tree,    Then it grew temperate in its vain expanse    Of useless leaves, and knotted, as thou seest,    Into these full, clear clusters, to repay    The hand that wisely wounded it.    Repine not, O my son!    In wisdom and in mercy heaven indicts,    Like a wise leech, its painful remedies.    SOUTHEY.      WEATHERCOCKS.      Weathercocks do not always show the real direction of a very gentle wind.  The strange figures of them, usually the productions of capricious fancy,  is one cause of their imperfection as vanes to indicate the wind. Griffins,  half-moons, foxes, or figures of St. Margaret and the dragon, are not good  shapes for weathercocks, which ought to be plain fans, the large surface of  one side being counterbalanced against the weight of the other.      THE VALUE OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS.      A general, though superficial acquaintance with such subjects as  well-educated men and women talk about in mixed society is absolutely  necessary. A practised eye will easily distinguish the silence of modest  attention from the mute weariness of ignorance. The most inveterate talker,  if he be not quite a fool, desires to be listened to as well as heard; and  a \"yes\" or a \"no\" may be placed and accented so as to show intelligence, or  betray stupidity. Grace in action and deportment is so essential, that it  may almost be said to make all that is beautiful in beauty. We do not mean  that a lady should, in dancing, walking, or sitting, display attitudes  worthy of a painter's model. In walking we, however, recommend something  between the listless saunter of a she-dandy, and the bustling gait of a  notable body, who perhaps saves three minutes out of four-and-twenty hours,  by doing every thing throughout the day with a jerk and a toss.--Dancing,  unless it be done quietly and gracefully, without the fatal results of a  shining face, and red neck and arms, it is far better to forbear  altogether, it being a very superfluous quality in a gentlewoman; whereas  _to please_ by all honest means is her proper calling and occupation. A  high degree of _positive_ grace is very rare, especially in northern  climates, where the form is degraded and spoiled by ligatures and by cold;  but every woman may attain to _negative_ grace, by avoiding awkward and  unmeaning habits. The incessant twirling of a reticule, the assiduous  pulling of the fingers of a glove, opening and shutting a book, swinging a  bell-rope, &c. betray either impatience and weariness of the conversation,  disrespect of the speakers, or a want of ease and self-possession by no  means inseparably connected with modesty and humility; those persons who  are most awkward and shy among their superiors in rank or information being  generally most over-bearing and peremptory with their equals or inferiors.

Bolivar then demanded his passport,  and when taken before Monteverde, the Spanish general said that Colonel  Bolivar's request should be complied with, as a reward for his having  served the king of Spain by delivering up Miranda. Bolivar answered that he  arrested him to punish a traitor[2] to his country, and not to serve the  king. This answer had nearly included him in the general proscription; but  the good offices of Don Francisco Iturbe, secretary to Monteverde, procured  the passport, and Bolivar was allowed to sail for Curacoa. From that island  he went to Carthagena, where he obtained the command of a small force, with  which he proceeded up the Magdalena, and having beaten parties of the  royalist troops at various points on that river, he continued his march  from Ocana to Cucuta, and solicited assistance from the government of  Cundinamarca. Five hundred men were placed at his disposal, and with these,  added to his own small party, Bolivar undertook to effect the liberation of  his country. Four thousand Spaniards, under General Correa, were then on  that part of the Venezuelan frontier. A division of these was beaten by  Bolivar, who pursued his march to Truxillo, defeating on the way several  royalist detachments.       [2] Bolivar seems to have been hurried into a dreadful error by the         warmth of his feelings. Not only is the _expediency_ of the         capitulation admitted by eye witnesses of the first         respectability, but also that Miranda had no other alternative.         The rich and influential inhabitants withheld their support, not         that their political sentiments had undergone a change but         because they saw the useless of sacrificing property and life in         a wild attempt to stem the stream of public opinion; the bulk of         the people having become decidedly royalist in principle ever         since that earthquake, which had been represented by the         priesthood as a judgement of Heaven upon the insurgent cause.    The Spaniards from the commencement of the war, had put to death all  persons whom they found with arms in their hands. The South Americans, on  the contrary, gave quarter to those royalists who fell into their power.  The natives consequently preferred entering the royalist ranks, feeling  secure that, in case of being made prisoners, their lives would be spared.  Bolivar, perceiving the great disadvantage under which he laboured, and as  a retaliation for the horrid butcheries committed by the Spaniards, issued  a proclamation at Truxillo, declaring, that from that time forward he  should wage a war of extermination. This declaration of _guerra a muerte_  on the part of the independents made the danger, in that respect, equal on  both sides.    Bolivar, having separated his small corps into two divisions, entrusted the  command of the second to the active General Rivas. Bolivar himself  penetrated the Llanos, after having beaten the Spaniards at Niquitao,  Carache, Varinas, Tahuana, and Torcones. He then advanced to Vitoria,  within twenty leagues of Caracas, where he was met by Spanish  commissioners, who sued for, and obtained, a capitulation. The conqueror  entered his native city in triumph. But this did not put an end to the war.  The Spaniards were faithless in the observance of the capitulation, and  Monteverde, from within the walls of Puerto Cabello, fomented the discord  which prevailed in the interior provinces. About this time a strong  reinforcement arrived from Spain. Bolivar was obliged to evacuate Caracas;  but the royalists were beaten at Viguirima, Barbula, and Las Trincheras.  However, the Spanish general Cevallos had time to raise four thousand  recruits in the province of Coro, which had always shown itself inimical to  the cause of independence. Bolivar next gained the important battle of  Araure, and repossessed himself of Caracas. On the 2nd of January, 1814, he  assembled the public authorities of the city, and resigned to them the  supreme authority he had exercised, and with which his triumphs had  invested him. They, however, refused to admit his resignation; conferred  upon him the title of LIBERATOR OF VENEZUELA; and named him dictator.    About this period a Spaniard, Don Jose Tomas Boves, succeeded in bringing  about a counter-revolution in the Llanos, an immense tract of level  country, which traverses the centre of Venezuela, and extends to the  confines of New Granada. Boves organized a force, which consisted of men  mostly chosen for their desperate character, whom he led on by promises of  indiscriminate plunder, and by lavishing the greatest rewards upon the  perpetrators of the most revolting atrocities. The track of these ruffians,  to Calabozo, was every where marked with the blood of the aged and the  defenceless. Bolivar, who had detached a part of his force in pursuit of  Cevallos, had not above two thousand men left to make head against Boves,  who, with nearly five times that number, had possessed himself of the  fertile valleys of Aragua, and destroyed some patriot divisions sent to  check his progress. Bolivar took up a position at San Mateo, in order to  cover Caracas. A series of attacks, in the space of forty days, reduced the  number of Bolivar's force to four hundred. Cevallos had repaired the  effects of his defeat at Araure, and, reinforced by General Cagigal, had  penetrated to Valencia. The patriot division of the east having defeated  Boves at Bocachica, and compelled him to retire to the Llanos, and having  subsequently united with the remains of Bolivar's force, marched against  Cagigal and Cevallos, whose well-organized troops amounted to six thousand.  These were attacked and defeated by Bolivar, who then detached the greater  part of his force to reduce the province of Coro to submission, and himself  marched against Boves. Bolivar was overwhelmed by numbers at La Puerta. His  division dispersed, and fled to Cundinamarca. He was then obliged to  abandon Caracas. The same day witnessed the affecting spectacle of several  thousand inhabitants leaving their homes and property at the mercy of the  ruthless spoiler, while they themselves set out to face want, disease, and  death, in distant provinces.    On the 17th of August, Bolivar lost the battle of Aragua. The subsequent  affairs of Maturin, Cumana, Carupano, Guiria, Urica, and El Caris, were  fought, with varying success. All being lost in the east, Bolivar next  proceeded to Carthagena, and offered his services to New Granada, then  agitated by discordant parties of provincialists, centralists,  metropolists, federalists, royalists, and independents. A congress  assembled at Tunja conferred upon Bolivar the command of the forces of New  Granada. Santa Fe de Bogota submitted, the provinces acknowledged the  congress, and an effort was made to establish a constitutional form of  government.    Bolivar having proposed to take the town of Santa Marta, still held by the  Spaniards, he was authorized by the government of Santa Fe to procure guns,  &c., from the arsenals of Carthagena. The governor of that fortress refused  to furnish the necessary supplies. In order to enforce compliance, Bolivar  invested Carthagena, before which he remained a considerable time, when he  heard of the arrival at Margarita of General Morillo, with ten thousand  Spanish troops. Upon this, Bolivar placed his own investing force at the  disposal of his rival, the governor of Carthagena; and, unwilling that the  cause of his country should continue to suffer from the dissention which  had arisen between himself and the governor, withdrew to Jamaica. Morillo,  soon afterwards, laid siege to Carthagena, which, unfortunately, in  consequence of the long investment it had already sustained, was nearly  destitute of provisions, Bolivar sent from Jamaica some supplies for the  besieged garrison; but before they could arrive, that important fortress  was in possession of the Spaniards. This enabled them to reconquer New  Granada, and the blood of its citizens was made to stream from the  scaffold.    At Kingston, Bolivar narrowly escaped assassination. The casual  circumstance of exchanging apartments with another person, caused the  murderer's dagger to be planted in the heart of a faithful follower,  instead of in that of Bolivar. The author of these memoirs happened to  live, for a few days, in the same boarding-house. Some officers of a  British line-of-battle ship, not speaking Spanish, requested him to invite  Bolivar, in their name, to dine with them. This was only a few weeks  previous to the intended assassination of Bolivar.    From Jamaica, Bolivar went to Hayti, and was received at Port-au-Prince by  Petion with kind hospitality, and was assisted by him as far as his means  would allow.    In April, 1816, he sailed with three hundred men to Margarita, which island  had lately again shaken off the Spanish yoke. He arrived at Juan Griego,  where he was proclaimed supreme chief of the republic. On the 1st of June  he sailed, and on the 3rd landed at Campano, where he beat nine hundred  Spaniards. He then opened a communication with patriot chieftains, who had  maintained themselves in isolated parties dispersed over the _llanos_ of  Cumana, Barcelona, and the Apure. It is a curious fact, that the isolation  of several of these parties was so complete, that, for many months, they  did not know of any other than themselves being in arms for the delivery of  their country. It was only by their coming into accidental contact that  they discovered that there was more than one patriot guerilla in  existence.[3] Bolivar supplied some of them with arms, and at the same time  augmented his own force to a thousand men. The Spaniards assembled in  superior numbers to destroy them; but Bolivar embarked, and relanded at  Ocumare, with an intention of taking Caracas: great part,"]]]
