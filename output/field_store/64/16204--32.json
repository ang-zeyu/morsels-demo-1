A climax is the climbing to the top  rung of the ladder. A crisis is the meeting place of possible victory and  possible disaster. A single step divides between the two--the  precipice-height, and the canon's yawning gulf.    It was a climax of opportunity; and a crisis of action. _God's_ climax of  opportunity to man. _Man's_ crisis of action. God made man sovereign in  his power of choice. Now He would go the last step and give him the  opportunity of using that power and so reaching the topmost levels. God  led man to the hill of choice. The man must _climb_ the hill if he would  reach its top.    Only the use of power gives actual possession of the power. What we do not  use we lose. The pressure of the foot is always necessary to a clear  title. To him that hath possible power shall be given actual power through  use.    This opportunity was the last love-touch of God in opening up the way into  the fulness of His image. With His ideal for man God went to His limit in  _giving_ the power. He could give the power of choice. Man must _use_ the  power given. Only so could he own what had been given. God could open the  door. Man must step over the door-sill. Action realizes power.    The tree of knowledge of good and evil was the tree of choice. Obedience  to God was the one thing involved. That simply meant, as it always means,  keeping in warm touch with God. All good absolutely is bound up in  this--_obeying God_, keeping in warm touch. To obey Him is the very heart  of good. All evil is included in disobeying Him. To disobey, to fail to  obey is the seeded core of all evil.    Whichever way he chose he would exercise his God-like power of choice.  Whichever way he chose, the knowledge would come. If he chose to obey he  would know good by choosing it, and evil by rejecting it. He knew neither  good nor evil, for he had not yet had the contact of choice. Knowledge  comes only through experience. In choosing not to obey, choosing to  disobey, he would know evil with a bitter intimacy by choosing it. He  would become acquainted with the good which he had shoved ruthlessly away.    With the opportunity came the temptation: God's opportunity; Satan's  temptation. Satan is ever on the heels of God. Two inclined planes lead  out of every man's path. Two doors open into them side by side. God's door  up, the tempter's door down, and only a door-jamb between. Here the split  hoof can be seen sticking from under the cloak's edge at the very start.  Satan hates the truth. He is afraid of it. Yet he sneaks around the  sheltering corner of what he fears and hates. The sugar coating of his  gall pills he steals from God. The devil bare-faced, standing only on his  own feet, would be instantly booted out at first approach. And right well  he knows it.    A cunning half lie opens the way to a full-fledged lie, but still coupled  with a half-truth. The suggestion that God was harshly prohibiting  something that was needful leads to the further suggestion that He was  arbitrarily, selfishly holding back the highest thing, the very thing He  was supposed to be giving, that is, likeness to Himself. Eve was getting a  course in suggestion. This was the first lesson. The school seems to be in  session still. The whole purpose is to slander God, to misrepresent Him.  That has been Satan's favorite method ever since. God is not good. He  makes cruel prohibitions. He keeps from us what we should have. It is  passing strange how every one of us has had that dust in his eyes. Some of  us might leave the \"had\" out of that sentence.    See how cunningly the truth and the lie are interwoven by this old  past-master in the sooty art of lying. \"Your eyes shall be opened, and ye  shall be as God knowing good and evil.\" It was true because by the use of  this highest power of choice he would become like God, and through  choosing he would know. It is cunningly implied with a sticky, slimy  cunning that, by not eating, that likeness and knowledge would not come.  That was the lie. The choice either way would bring both this element of  likeness to God in the sovereign power of choice, and the knowledge.    Then came the choice. The step up was a step down: up into the use of his  highest power; down by the use of that power. In that wherein he was most  like God in power, man became most unlike God in character. First the  woman chose: then the man. Satan subtly begins his attack upon the woman.  Because she was the weaker? Certainly not. Because she was the stronger.  Not the leader in action, but the stronger in influence. He is the leader  in action: she in influence. The greater includes the less. Satan is a  master strategist, bold in his cunning. If the citadel can be gotten, all  is won. If he _could_ get the woman he _would_ get the man. She includes  him. She who was included in him now includes him. The last has become  first.    She was deceived. He was not deceived. The woman chose unwarily for the  supposed good. The man chose with open eyes for the woman's sake. Could  the word gallantry be used? Was it supposed friendship? He would not  abandon her? Yet he proved _not her friend_ that day, in stepping down to  this new low level. Man's habit of giving smoothly spoken words to woman,  while shying sharp-edged stones at her, should in all honesty be stopped.  Man can throw no stones at woman. If the woman failed God that day, the  man failed both God and the woman. If it be true that through her came the  beginning of the world's sin, through her, too, be it gratefully and  reverently remembered, came that which was far greater--the world's  Saviour.    The choice was made. The act was done. Tremendous act! Bring your  microscope and peer with awe into that single act. No fathoming line can  sound its depth. No measuring rod its height nor breadth. No thought can  pierce its intensity. That reaching arm went around a world. Millenniums  in a moment. A million miles in a step. An ocean in a drop. Volumes in a  word. A race in a woman. A hell of suffering in an act. The depths of woe  in a glance. The first chapter of Romans in Genesis three, six. Sharpest  pain in softest touch. God mistrusted--distrusted. Satan embraced. Sin's  door open. Eden's gate shut.    Mark keenly the immediate result that came with that intense rapidity  possible only to mental powers. At once they were both conscious of  something that had not entered their thoughts before. To the pure all  things are pure. To the imagination hurt by breaking away from God, the  purest things can bring up suggestions directly opposite. Through the open  door of disobedience came with lightning swiftness the suggestion of  using a pure, holy function of the body in a way and for a purpose not  intended. Making an end of that which was meant to be only a means to a  highest end. Degrading to an animal pleasure that which held in its pure  hallowed power the whole future of the race. There is absolutely no change  save in the inner thought. But what a horrid heredity in that one flash of  the imagination! Every sin lives first in the imagination. The imagination  is sin's brooding and birth-place. An inner picture, a lingering glance, a  wrong desire, an act--that is the story of every sin. The first step was  disobedience. That opened the door. The first suggestion of wrong-doing  that followed hot on the heels of that first step, through that open door,  struck at the very vitals of the race--both its existence and its  character. That first suggested unnatural action, with its whole brood,  has become the commonest and slimiest sin of the race.    Here, in the beginning, the very thought _shocked_ them. In that lay their  safety. Shame is the recoil of God's image from the touch of sin. Shame is  sin's first checkmate. It is man's vantage for a fresh pull up. There are  only two places where there is no shame: where there is no sin; where sin  is steeped deepest in. The extremes are always jostling elbows. Instantly  the sense of shame suggested a help. A simple bit of clothing was  provided. It was so adjusted as to help most. Clothing is man's badge of  shame. The first clothing was not for the body, but for the mind. Not for  protection, but for concealment, that so the mind might be helped to  forget its evil suggestions. It is one of sin's odd perversions that draws  attention by color and cut to the race's badge of shame. It would seem  strongly suggestive of moral degeneracy, or of bad taste, or, let us say  in charity, of a lapse of historical memory.    Mark the sad soliloquy of God: \"Behold the man has become as one of us: He  has exercised his power of choice.\" He tenderly refrains from saying, \"and  has chosen wrong! so pitiably wrong!\" That was plain enough. He would not  rub in the acid truth. He would not make the scar more hideous by pointing  it out. \"And now _lest_ he put forth his hand and take of the tree of  life.\" \"_Lest!_\" There is a further danger threatening. In his present  condition he needs guarding for his own sake in the future.  \"_Lest_\"--wrong choice limits future action. Sin narrows.    With man's act of sin came God's act of saving. Satan is ever on the heels  of God to hurt man. But God is ever on the heels of Satan to cushion the  hurt and save the man. It is a nip-and-tuck race with God a head and a  heart in the lead. Something had to be done. Man had started sin in  himself by his choice. The taint of disobedience, rebellion, had been  breathed out into the air. He had gotten out of sorts with his  surroundings. His presence would spoil his own heaven. The stain of his  sin would have been upon his eternal life. The zero of selfishness would  have been the atmosphere of his home. The touch of his unhallowed hand  must be taken away for his own sake. That unhallowed touch _has_ been upon  every function and relationship of life outside those gates."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12814"],[0,"Philippine Folk Tales (#3)"],[1,"to shine, and Aponibolinayen was with him. They traveled toward the  West, but when morning had passed into noontime and they had reached  the middle of the sky Aponibolinayen was so hot that she melted and  became oil. Then Ini-init put her into a bottle and wrapped her in  the blankets and pillows and dropped her down to earth.    Now one of the women of Aponibolinayen's town was at the spring dipping  water when she heard something fall near her. Turning to look, she  beheld a bundle of beautiful blankets and pillows which she began to  unroll, and inside she found the most beautiful woman she had ever  seen. Frightened at her discovery, the woman ran as fast as she could  to the town, where she called the people together and told them to  come at once to the spring. They all hastened to the spot and there  they found Aponibolinayen for whom they had been searching everywhere.    \"Where have you been?\" asked her father; \"we have searched all over  the world and we could not find you.'    \"I have come from Pindayan,\" answered Aponibolinayen. \"Enemies of  our people kept me there till I made my escape while they were asleep  at night\"    All were filled with joy that the lost one had returned, and they  decided that at the next moon [7] they would perform a ceremony for  the spirits [8] and invite all the relatives who were mourning for  Aponibolinayen.    So they began to prepare for the ceremony, and while they were  pounding rice, Aponibolinayen asked her mother to prick her little  finger where it itched, and as she did so a beautiful baby boy popped  out. The people were very much surprised at this, and they noticed  that every time he was bathed the baby grew very fast so that, in  a short time, he was able to walk. Then they were anxious to know  who was the husband of Aponibolinayen, but she would not tell them,  and they decided to invite everyone in the world to the ceremony that  they might not overlook him.    They sent for the betel-nuts that were covered with gold, [9] and  when they had oiled them they commanded them to go to all the towns  and compel the people to come to the ceremony.    \"If anyone refuses to come, grow on his knee,\" said the people,  and the betel-nuts departed to do as they were bidden.    As the guests began to arrive, the people watched carefully for one  who might be the husband of Aponibolinayen, but none appeared and they  were greatly troubled. Finally they went to the old woman, Alokotan,  who was able to talk with the spirits, and begged her to find what town  had not been visited by the betel-nuts which had been sent to invite  the people. After she had consulted the spirits the old woman said:    \"You have invited all the people except Ini-init who lives up  above. Now you must send a betel-nut to summon him. It may be that  he is the husband of Aponibolinayen, for the siksiklat vine carried  her up when she went to gather greens.\"    So a betel-nut was called and bidden to summon Ini-init.    The betel-nut went up to the Sun, who was in his house, and said:    \"Good morning, Sun. I have come to summon you to a ceremony which the  father and mother of Aponibolinayen are making for the spirits. If  you do not want to go, I will grow on your head.\" [10]    \"Grow on my head,\" said the Sun. \"I do not wish to go.\"    So the betel-nut jumped upon his head and grew until it became so  tall that the Sun was not able to carry it, and he was in great pain.    \"Oh, grow on my pig,\" begged the Sun. So the betel-nut jumped upon  the pig's head and grew, but it was so heavy that the pig could not  carry it and squealed all the time. At last the Sun saw that he would  have to obey the summons, and he said to the betel-nut:    \"Get off my pig and I will go.\"    So Ini-init came to the ceremony, and as soon as Aponibolinayen and the  baby saw him, they were very happy and ran to meet him. Then the people  knew that this was the husband of Aponibolinayen, and they waited  eagerly for him to come up to them. As he drew near, however, they saw  that he did not walk, for he was round; and then they perceived that  he was not a man but a large stone. All her relatives were very angry  to find that Aponibolinayen had married a stone; and they compelled  her to take off her beads [11] and her good clothes, for, they said,  she must now dress in old clothes and go again to live with the stone.    So Aponibolinayen put on the rags that they brought her and at once  set out with the stone for his home. No sooner had they arrived there,  however, than he became a handsome man, and they were very happy.    \"In one moon,\" said the Sun, \"we will make a ceremony for the spirits,  and I will pay your father and mother the marriage price [12] for you.\"    This pleased Aponibolinayen very much, and they used magic so that  they had many neighbors who came to pound rice [13] for them and to  build a large spirit house. [14]    Then they sent oiled betel-nuts to summon their relatives to the  ceremony. The father of Aponibolinayen did not want to go, but  the betel-nut threatened to grow on his knee if he did not. So he  commanded all the people in the town to wash their hair and their  clothes, and when all was ready they set out.    When they reached the town they were greatly surprised to find that  the stone had become a man, and they chewed the magic betel-nuts to  see who he might be. It was discovered that he was the son of a couple  in Aponibolinayen's own town, and the people all rejoiced that this  couple had found the son whom they had thought lost. They named him  Aponitolau, and his parents paid the marriage price for his wife--the  spirit house nine times full of valuable jars. [15]    After that all danced and made merry for one moon, and when the people  departed for their homes Ini-init and his wife went with them to live  on the earth.          Aponibolinayen    _Tinguian_      The most beautiful girl in all the world was Aponibolinayen of  Nalpangan. Many young men had come to her brother, Aponibalagen,  to ask for her hand in marriage, but he had refused them all, for he  awaited one who possessed great power. Then it happened that the fame  of her beauty spread over all the world till it reached even to Adasen;  and in that place there lived a man of great power named Gawigawen.    Now Gawigawen, who was a handsome man, had sought among all the pretty  girls but never, until he heard of the great beauty of Aponibolinayen,  had he found one whom he wished to wed. Then he determined that she  should be his wife; and he begged his mother to help him win her. So  Dinawagen, the mother of Gawigawen, took her hat which looked like  a sunbeam and set out at once for Nalpangan; and when she arrived  there she was greeted by Ebang, the mother of the lovely maiden,  who presently began to prepare food for them. [16]    She put the pot over the fire, and when the water boiled she broke  up a stick and threw the pieces into the pot, and immediately they  became fish. Then she brought basi [17] in a large jar, and Dinawagen,  counting the notches in the rim, [18] perceived that the jar had been  handed down through nine generations. They ate and drank together,  and after they had finished the meal, Dinawagen told Aponibalagen of  her son's wishes, and asked if he was willing that his sister should  marry Gawigawen. Aponibalagen, who had heard of the power of the  suitor, at once gave his consent. And Dinawagen departed for home,  leaving a gold cup as an engagement present. [19]    Gawigawen was watching at the door of his house for his mother's  return, and when she told him of her success, he was so happy that  he asked all the people in the town to go with him the next day to  Nalpangan to arrange the amount he must pay for his bride. [20]    Now the people of Nalpangan wanted a great price for this girl  who was so beautiful, and the men of the two towns debated for a  long time before they could come to an agreement. Finally, however,  it was decided that Gawigawen should fill the spirit house eighteen  times with valuable things; and when he had done this, they were all  satisfied and went to the yard where they danced and beat on the copper  gongs. [21] All the pretty girls danced their best, and one who wore  big jars about her neck made more noise than the others as she danced,  and the jars sang \"Kitol, kitol, kanitol; inka, inka, inkatol.\"    But when Aponibolinayen, the bride of Gawigawen, came down out of  the house to dance, the sunshine vanished, so beautiful was she;  and as she moved about, the river came up into the town, and striped  fish bit at her heels.    For three months the people remained here feasting and dancing, and  then early one morning they took Aponibolinayen to her new home in  Adasen. The trail that led from one town to the other had become very  beautiful in the meantime: the grass and trees glistened with bright  lights, and the waters of the tiny streams dazzled the eyes with their  brightness as Aponibolinayen waded across. When they reached the spring  of Gawigawen, they found that it, too, was more beautiful than ever  before. Each grain of sand had become a bead, and the place where the  women set their jars when they came to dip water had become a big dish.    Then said Aponibalagen to his people, \"Go tell Gawigawen to bring an  old man, for I want to make a spring for Aponibolinayen.\"    So an old man was brought and Aponibalagen cut off his head and put  it in the ground, and sparkling water bubbled up. [22] The body he  made into a tree to shade his sister when she came to dip water,  and the drops of blood as they touched the ground were changed into  valuable beads. Even the path from the spring to the house was covered  with big plates, and everything was made beautiful for Aponibolinayen.    Now during all this time Aponibolinayen had kept her face covered so  that she had never seen her husband, for although he was a handsome  man,"]]]
