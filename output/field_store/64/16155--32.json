What has happened?  Have you altered the curtains, or re-arranged the furniture, or where is  the indefinable difference of it? Are you wearing your hair in a new way  without warning me? I perceive a change clearly, and I cannot for the life  of me say what it is.\"    Then my wife answered in her most tragic voice, \"George,\" she said, \"that  William has not come near the place to-day! And Jane is crying her heart  out upstairs.\"    There followed a period of silence. Jane, as I have said, stopped singing  about the house, and began to care for our brittle possessions, which  struck my wife as being a very sad sign indeed. The next Sunday, and the  next, Jane asked to go out, \"to walk with William,\" and my wife, who never  attempts to extort confidences, gave her permission, and asked no  questions. On each occasion Jane came back looking flushed and very  determined. At last one day she became communicative.    \"William is being led away,\" she remarked abruptly, with a catching of the  breath, apropos of tablecloths. \"Yes, m'm. She is a milliner, and she can  play on the piano.\"    \"I thought,\" said my wife, \"that you went out with him on Sunday.\"    \"Not out with him, m'm--after him. I walked along by the side of them, and  told her he was engaged to me.\"    \"Dear me, Jane, did you? What did they do?\"    \"Took no more notice of me than if I was dirt. So I told her she should  suffer for it.\"    \"It could not have been a very agreeable walk, Jane.\"    \"Not for no parties, ma'am.\"    \"I wish,\" said Jane, \"I could play the piano, ma'am. But anyhow, I don't  mean to let _her_ get him away from me. She's older than him, and her  hair ain't gold to the roots, ma'am.\"    It was on the August Bank Holiday that the crisis came. We do not clearly  know the details of the fray, but only such fragments as poor Jane let  fall. She came home dusty, excited, and with her heart hot within her.    The milliner's mother, the milliner, and William had made a party to the  Art Museum at South Kensington, I think. Anyhow, Jane had calmly but  firmly accosted them somewhere in the streets, and asserted her right to  what, in spite of the consensus of literature, she held to be her  inalienable property. She did, I think, go so far as to lay hands on him.  They dealt with her in a crushingly superior way. They \"called a cab.\"  There was a \"scene,\" William being pulled away into the four-wheeler by  his future wife and mother-in-law from the reluctant hands of our  discarded Jane. There were threats of giving her \"in charge.\"    \"My poor Jane!\" said my wife, mincing veal as though she was mincing  William. \"It's a shame of them. I would think no more of him. He is not  worthy of you.\"    \"No, m'm,\" said Jane. \"He _is_ weak.    \"But it's that woman has done it,\" said Jane. She was never known to bring  herself to pronounce \"that woman's\" name or to admit her girlishness. \"I  can't think what minds some women must have--to try and get a girl's young  man away from her. But there, it only hurts to talk about it,\" said Jane.    Thereafter our house rested from William. But there was something in the  manner of Jane's scrubbing the front doorstep or sweeping out the rooms, a  certain viciousness, that persuaded me that the story had not yet ended.    \"Please, m'm, may I go and see a wedding tomorrow?\" said Jane one day.    My wife knew by instinct whose wedding. \"Do you think it is wise, Jane?\"  she said.    \"I would like to see the last of him,\" said Jane.    \"My dear,\" said my wife, fluttering into my room about twenty minutes  after Jane had started, \"Jane has been to the boot-hole and taken all the  left-off boots and shoes, and gone off to the wedding with them in a bag.  Surely she cannot mean--\"    \"Jane,\" I said, \"is developing character. Let us hope for the best.\"    Jane came back with a pale, hard face. All the boots seemed to be still in  her bag, at which my wife heaved a premature sigh of relief. We heard her  go upstairs and replace the boots with considerable emphasis.    \"Quite a crowd at the wedding, ma'am,\" she said presently, in a purely  conversational style, sitting in our little kitchen, and scrubbing the  potatoes; \"and such a lovely day for them.\" She proceeded to numerous  other details, clearly avoiding some cardinal incident.    \"It was all extremely respectable and nice, ma'am; but _her_ father  didn't wear a black coat, and looked quite out of place, ma'am. Mr.  Piddingquirk--\"    \"_Who_?\"    \"Mr. Piddingquirk--William that was, ma'am--had white gloves, and a coat  like a clergyman, and a lovely chrysanthemum. He looked so nice, ma'am.  And there was red carpet down, just like for gentlefolks. And they say he  gave the clerk four shillings, ma'am. It was a real kerridge they had--not  a fly. When they came out of church there was rice-throwing, and her two  little sisters dropping dead flowers. And someone threw a slipper, and  then I threw a boot--\"    \"Threw a _boot_, Jane!\"    \"Yes, ma'am. Aimed at her. But it hit _him_. Yes, ma'am, hard. Gev  him a black eye, I should think. I only threw that one. I hadn't the heart  to try again. All the little boys cheered when it hit him.\"    After an interval--\"I am sorry the boot hit _him_.\"    Another pause. The potatoes were being scrubbed violently. \"He always  _was_ a bit above me, you know, ma'am. And he was led away.\"    The potatoes were more than finished. Jane rose sharply with a sigh, and  rapped the basin down on the table.    \"I don't care,\" she said. \"I don't care a rap. He will find out his  mistake yet. It serves me right. I was stuck up about him. I ought not to  have looked so high. And I am glad things are as things are.\"    My wife was in the kitchen, seeing to the higher cookery. After the  confession of the boot-throwing, she must have watched poor Jane fuming  with a certain dismay in those brown eyes of hers. But I imagine they  softened again very quickly, and then Jane's must have met them.    \"Oh, ma'am,\" said Jane, with an astonishing change of note, \"think of all  that _might_ have been! Oh, ma'am, I _could_ have been so happy!  I ought to have known, but I didn't know...You're very kind to let me talk  to you, ma'am...for it's hard on me, ma'am...it's har-r-r-r-d--\"    And I gather that Euphemia so far forgot herself as to let Jane sob out  some of the fullness of her heart on a sympathetic shoulder. My Euphemia,  thank Heaven, has never properly grasped the importance of \"keeping up her  position.\" And since that fit of weeping, much of the accent of bitterness  has gone out of Jane's scrubbing and brush work.    Indeed, something passed the other day with the butcher-boy--but that  scarcely belongs to this story. However, Jane is young still, and time and  change are at work with her. We all have our sorrows, but I do not believe  very much in the existence of sorrows that never heal.            II.      THE CONE.      The night was hot and overcast, the sky red-rimmed with the lingering  sunset of midsummer. They sat at the open window, trying to fancy the air  was fresher there. The trees and shrubs of the garden stood stiff and  dark; beyond in the roadway a gas-lamp burnt, bright orange against the  hazy blue of the evening. Farther were the three lights of the railway  signal against the lowering sky. The man and woman spoke to one another in  low tones.    \"He does not suspect?\" said the man, a little nervously.    \"Not he,\" she said peevishly, as though that too irritated her. \"He  thinks of nothing but the works and the prices of fuel. He has no  imagination, no poetry.\"    \"None of these men of iron have,\" he said sententiously. \"They have no  hearts.\"    \"_He_ has not,\" she said. She turned her discontented face towards  the window. The distant sound of a roaring and rushing drew nearer and  grew in volume; the house quivered; one heard the metallic rattle of the  tender. As the train passed, there was a glare of light above the cutting  and a driving tumult of smoke; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,  eight black oblongs--eight trucks--passed across the dim grey of the  embankment, and were suddenly extinguished one by one in the throat of the  tunnel, which, with the last, seemed to swallow down train, smoke, and  sound in one abrupt gulp.    \"This country was all fresh and beautiful once,\" he said; \"and now--it is  Gehenna. Down that way--nothing but pot-banks and chimneys belching fire  and dust into the face of heaven...But what does it matter? An end comes,  an end to all this cruelty..._To-morrow.\"_ He spoke the last word in  a whisper.    \"_To-morrow,\"_ she said, speaking in a whisper too, and still staring  out of the window.    \"Dear!\" he said, putting his hand on hers.    She turned with a start, and their eyes searched one another's. Hers  softened to his gaze. \"My dear one!\" she said, and then: \"It seems so  strange--that you should have come into my life like this--to open--\" She  paused.    \"To open?\" he said.    \"All this wonderful world\"--she hesitated, and spoke still more softly--  \"this world of _love_ to me.\"    Then suddenly the door clicked and closed. They turned their heads, and he  started violently back. In the shadow of the room stood a great shadowy  figure-silent. They saw the face dimly in the half-light, with  unexpressive dark patches under the pent-house brows. Every muscle in  Raut's body suddenly became tense. When could the door have opened? What  had he heard? Had he heard all? What had he seen? A tumult of questions.    The new-comer's voice came at last, after a pause that seemed  interminable. \"Well?\" he said.    \"I was afraid I had missed you, Horrocks,\" said the man at the window,  gripping the window-ledge with his hand. His voice was unsteady.    The clumsy figure of Horrocks came forward out of the shadow. He made no  answer to Raut's remark. For a moment he stood above them.

It was no wonder that, whatever  changes took place, they were always ensured in their own possessions.  They were absolutely cold and hard by nature.  Not one of them--so far as  we have any knowledge--was ever known to be touched by the softer  sentiments, to swerve from his purpose, or hold his hand in obedience to  the dictates of his heart.  The pictures and effigies of them all show  their adherence to the early Roman type.  Their eyes were full; their  hair, of raven blackness, grew thick and close and curly.  Their figures  were massive and typical of strength.    \"The thick black hair, growing low down on the neck, told of vast  physical strength and endurance.  But the most remarkable characteristic  is the eyes.  Black, piercing, almost unendurable, they seem to contain  in themselves a remarkable will power which there is no gainsaying.  It  is a power that is partly racial and partly individual: a power  impregnated with some mysterious quality, partly hypnotic, partly  mesmeric, which seems to take away from eyes that meet them all power of  resistance--nay, all power of wishing to resist.  With eyes like those,  set in that all-commanding face, one would need to be strong indeed to  think of resisting the inflexible will that lay behind.    \"You may think, Adam, that all this is imagination on my part, especially  as I have never seen any of them.  So it is, but imagination based on  deep study.  I have made use of all I know or can surmise logically  regarding this strange race.  With such strange compelling qualities, is  it any wonder that there is abroad an idea that in the race there is some  demoniac possession, which tends to a more definite belief that certain  individuals have in the past sold themselves to the Devil?    \"But I think we had better go to bed now.  We have a lot to get through  to-morrow, and I want you to have your brain clear, and all your  susceptibilities fresh.  Moreover, I want you to come with me for an  early walk, during which we may notice, whilst the matter is fresh in our  minds, the peculiar disposition of this place--not merely your  grand-uncle's estate, but the lie of the country around it.  There are  many things on which we may seek--and perhaps find--enlightenment.  The  more we know at the start, the more things which may come into our view  will develop themselves.\"          CHAPTER III--DIANA'S GROVE      Curiosity took Adam Salton out of bed in the early morning, but when he  had dressed and gone downstairs; he found that, early as he was, Sir  Nathaniel was ahead of him.  The old gentleman was quite prepared for a  long walk, and they started at once.    Sir Nathaniel, without speaking, led the way to the east, down the hill.  When they had descended and risen again, they found themselves on the  eastern brink of a steep hill.  It was of lesser height than that on  which the Castle was situated; but it was so placed that it commanded the  various hills that crowned the ridge.  All along the ridge the rock  cropped out, bare and bleak, but broken in rough natural castellation.  The form of the ridge was a segment of a circle, with the higher points  inland to the west.  In the centre rose the Castle, on the highest point  of all.  Between the various rocky excrescences were groups of trees of  various sizes and heights, amongst some of which were what, in the early  morning light, looked like ruins.  These--whatever they were--were of  massive grey stone, probably limestone rudely cut--if indeed they were  not shaped naturally.  The fall of the ground was steep all along the  ridge, so steep that here and there both trees and rocks and buildings  seemed to overhang the plain far below, through which ran many streams.    Sir Nathaniel stopped and looked around, as though to lose nothing of the  effect.  The sun had climbed the eastern sky and was making all details  clear.  He pointed with a sweeping gesture, as though calling Adam's  attention to the extent of the view.  Having done so, he covered the  ground more slowly, as though inviting attention to detail.  Adam was a  willing and attentive pupil, and followed his motions exactly, missing--or  trying to miss--nothing.    \"I have brought you here, Adam, because it seems to me that this is the  spot on which to begin our investigations.  You have now in front of you  almost the whole of the ancient kingdom of Mercia.  In fact, we see the  whole of it except that furthest part, which is covered by the Welsh  Marches and those parts which are hidden from where we stand by the high  ground of the immediate west.  We can see--theoretically--the whole of  the eastern bound of the kingdom, which ran south from the Humber to the  Wash.  I want you to bear in mind the trend of the ground, for some time,  sooner or later, we shall do well to have it in our mind's eye when we  are considering the ancient traditions and superstitions, and are trying  to find the _rationale_ of them.  Each legend, each superstition which we  receive, will help in the understanding and possible elucidation of the  others.  And as all such have a local basis, we can come closer to the  truth--or the probability--by knowing the local conditions as we go  along.  It will help us to bring to our aid such geological truth as we  may have between us.  For instance, the building materials used in  various ages can afford their own lessons to understanding eyes.  The  very heights and shapes and materials of these hills--nay, even of the  wide plain that lies between us and the sea--have in themselves the  materials of enlightening books.\"    \"For instance, sir?\" said Adam, venturing a question.    \"Well, look at those hills which surround the main one where the site for  the Castle was wisely chosen--on the highest ground.  Take the others.  There is something ostensible in each of them, and in all probability  something unseen and unproved, but to be imagined, also.\"    \"For instance?\" continued Adam.    \"Let us take them _seriatim_.  That to the east, where the trees are,  lower down--that was once the location of a Roman temple, possibly  founded on a pre-existing Druidical one.  Its name implies the former,  and the grove of ancient oaks suggests the latter.\"    \"Please explain.\"    \"The old name translated means 'Diana's Grove.'  Then the next one higher  than it, but just beyond it, is called '_Mercy_'--in all probability a  corruption or familiarisation of the word _Mercia_, with a Roman pun  included.  We learn from early manuscripts that the place was called  _Vilula Misericordiae_.  It was originally a nunnery, founded by Queen  Bertha, but done away with by King Penda, the reactionary to Paganism  after St. Augustine.  Then comes your uncle's place--Lesser Hill.  Though  it is so close to the Castle, it is not connected with it.  It is a  freehold, and, so far as we know, of equal age.  It has always belonged  to your family.\"    \"Then there only remains the Castle!\"    \"That is all; but its history contains the histories of all the others--in  fact, the whole history of early England.\"  Sir Nathaniel, seeing the  expectant look on Adam's face, went on:    \"The history of the Castle has no beginning so far as we know.  The  furthest records or surmises or inferences simply accept it as existing.  Some of these--guesses, let us call them--seem to show that there was  some sort of structure there when the Romans came, therefore it must have  been a place of importance in Druid times--if indeed that was the  beginning.  Naturally the Romans accepted it, as they did everything of  the kind that was, or might be, useful.  The change is shown or inferred  in the name Castra.  It was the highest protected ground, and so  naturally became the most important of their camps.  A study of the map  will show you that it must have been a most important centre.  It both  protected the advances already made to the north, and helped to dominate  the sea coast.  It sheltered the western marches, beyond which lay savage  Wales--and danger.  It provided a means of getting to the Severn, round  which lay the great Roman roads then coming into existence, and made  possible the great waterway to the heart of England--through the Severn  and its tributaries.  It brought the east and the west together by the  swiftest and easiest ways known to those times.  And, finally, it  provided means of descent on London and all the expanse of country  watered by the Thames.    \"With such a centre, already known and organised, we can easily see that  each fresh wave of invasion--the Angles, the Saxons, the Danes, and the  Normans--found it a desirable possession and so ensured its upholding.  In  the earlier centuries it was merely a vantage ground.  But when the  victorious Romans brought with them the heavy solid fortifications  impregnable to the weapons of the time, its commanding position alone  ensured its adequate building and equipment.  Then it was that the  fortified camp of the Caesars developed into the castle of the king.  As  we are as yet ignorant of the names of the first kings of Mercia, no  historian has been able to guess which of them made it his ultimate  defence; and I suppose we shall never know now.  In process of time, as  the arts of war developed, it increased in size and strength, and  although recorded details are lacking, the history is written not merely  in the stone of its building, but is inferred in the changes of  structure.  Then the sweeping changes which followed the Norman Conquest  wiped out all lesser records than its own.  To-day we must accept it as  one of the earliest castles of the Conquest, probably not later than the  time of Henry I.  Roman and Norman were both wise in their retention of  places of approved strength or utility.  So it was that these surrounding  heights, already established and to a certain extent proved, were  retained.  Indeed, such characteristics as already pertained to"]]]
