I have told, or      tried to tell you, of men, who when menaced by famine, and      in the midst of pestilence, with every energy taxed by the      urgency of the hour, were building roads and bridges, laying      out villages, and planting cornfields, for the stranger      who might come after them, their kinsman only by a common      humanity, and peradventure a common suffering,--of men, who      have renewed their prosperity in the homes they have founded      in the desert,--and who, in their new built city, walled      round by mountains like a fortress, are extending pious      hospitalities to the destitute emigrants from our frontier      lines,--of men who, far removed from the restraints of law,      obeyed it from choice, or found in the recesses of their      religion, something not inconsistent with human laws, but      far more controlling; and who are now soliciting from the      government of the United States, not indemnity,--for the      appeal would be hopeless, and they know it--not protection,      for they now have no need of it,--but that identity of      political institutions and that community of laws with the      rest of us, which was confessedly their birthright when they      were driven beyond our borders.        \"I said I would give you the opinion I formed of the Mormons:      you may deduce it for yourselves from these facts.

RAMBLES IN THE PENINSULA.    NO. II.    GRENADA, May 26, 1850.    My Dear Friend--My companion, Mr. Ronalds, left this morning in the  diligence for Madrid, and I am, therefore, for the first time since I  have been in Europe _alone_--the only citizen of the United States at  present in this ancient Moorish city: _alone_, I may almost say, in  the midst of paradise. Yet the beauties of nature will not compensate  for the solitude of the heart, which is continually yearning after  sympathy; we wish for something beyond the pleasures of the eye, and  I would that you were with me. I would take you up to me Alhambra,  and descant to you for hours upon its perfections and its romantic  history. To me this wondrous pile has become _familiar_; I have seen  it at all hours of the day, and have visited it in the enchantment  of moonlight; and never will pass from my memory the pleasant hours  I have spent within its sacred precincts; I shall remember them and  those who shared them with me--forever. A few days since we made up a  party and rode out to the famous town of Santa Fe, in the delightful  Vega, about eight miles away. We were all dressed in the gay costume  of Andalusia, and presented, as you may imagine, a picturesque  appearance; my companions were lively fellows, and we had a great  deal of sport on the way. Santa Fe is now a dilapidated place, but  its associations make it well deserving a visit. It was built by  Ferdinand, during the memorable siege of Grenada; it was here that  Boabdil signed the capitulation of his city; and it was from this  spot, too, that Columbus was dispatched on his mission of discovering  a new world. The rich and fertile Vega, as we rode with the speed of  the wind over it, seemed to me like a fairy land--so luxuriant  the vegetation--so rich the meadows and fields of waving grain--so  exquisite the variety of cottages, and villages, and groves, dotting  so vast a plain--so pure and transparent the atmosphere, that the most  distant objects are as clearly defined as those nearest us. Imagine  so lovely a landscape--thirty miles in length by twenty-five in width,  surrounded by tremendous mountains,--those of the Sierra Nevada,  rising back of Grenada to the height of thirteen thousand feet above  the level of the sea, their summits covered by a dazzling mantle  of snow: imagine this, and you will have some faint idea of this  beautiful Eden of Spain. It is worth a long pilgrimage to gaze but  for one moment upon it, particularly from the Torre de la Vela of the  Alhambra, whence I have beheld it, both in the bright, gay sunshine,  and through the solemnly beautiful night, illumined by the stars and  moon.    The walks and gardens of Grenada are exceedingly beautiful. The  principal promenade is called (and very appropriately) El Salon. It is  of considerable extent--about eighty feet in width, with regular lines  of lofty elms on either side, the bending branches of which nearly  meet in an arch overhead. At both extremities of this charming avenue  is a large and handsome fountain of ever-flowing water. The ground  of the walk is hard--slightly curved; and as smooth and clean as the  floor of a ball-room, where convenient seats of stone, tastefully  arranged beneath the shade of the spreading trees, seem to invite  one to meditation and repose. Outside of this lovely promenade, are  blooming gardens, teeming with roses and other flowers, which fill  the air with fragrance, while through them on one side runs the river  Darre, and on the other the Xenie--gentle streams, whose waters unite  their melodious rippling to the chorus of nightingales, ever singing  above their pleasant banks. But description is tiresome, especially  when one is attempting to present something beyond his power, so I  shall not fatigue you with it any longer: besides, a worthy English  curate, now my only companion in this wretched hotel, is boring me so  incessantly with conversation that I find it difficult to collect any  thoughts to put on paper. I wish he was already in heaven, as, surely,  he well deserves to be.    It was my intention to have gone from this place to Almeria on  horseback, but as R. has left for Madrid, I shall return to Malaga,  probably, in the diligence to-night. It leaves at 12 o'clock, under an  escort of six cavalry, which on this road is indispensably necessary.  From Malaga I shall take steamer for Valencia and Barcelona, and  according to my present calculations, will reach Paris about the first  of June next. F---- wants me to go to Italy--I do not know exactly  what course to take, as traveling in Italy during the summer season is  not considered healthy. I should like to remain in France a month or  so, in order to improve myself in their language: as for Spanish, I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1298"],[0,"The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains (#3)"],[1,"ity. No polished person could have done it  better. What was the matter? I looked at him, and suddenly it came to  me. If he had tried familiarity with me the first two minutes of our  acquaintance, I should have resented it; by what right, then, had I  tried it with him? It smacked of patronizing: on this occasion he had  come off the better gentleman of the two. Here in flesh and blood was  a truth which I had long believed in words, but never met before. The  creature we call a GENTLEMAN lies deep in the hearts of thousands that  are born without chance to master the outward graces of the type.    Between the station and the eating-house I did a deal of straight  thinking. But my thoughts were destined presently to be drowned in  amazement at the rare personage into whose society fate had thrown me.    Town, as they called it, pleased me the less, the longer I saw it. But  until our language stretches itself and takes in a new word of closer  fit, town will have to do for the name of such a place as was Medicine  Bow. I have seen and slept in many like it since. Scattered wide, they  littered the frontier from the Columbia to the Rio Grande, from the  Missouri to the Sierras. They lay stark, dotted over a planet of  treeless dust, like soiled packs of cards. Each was similar to the next,  as one old five-spot of clubs resembles another. Houses, empty bottles,  and garbage, they were forever of the same shapeless pattern. More  forlorn they were than stale bones. They seemed to have been strewn  there by the wind and to be waiting till the wind should come again and  blow them away. Yet serene above their foulness swam a pure and quiet  light, such as the East never sees; they might be bathing in the air of  creation's first morning. Beneath sun and stars their days and nights  were immaculate and wonderful.    Medicine Bow was my first, and I took its dimensions, twenty-nine  buildings in all,--one coal shute, one water tank, the station, one  store, two eating-houses, one billiard hall, two tool-houses, one feed  stable, and twelve others that for one reason and another I shall not  name. Yet this wretched husk of squalor spent thought upon appearances;  many houses in it wore a false front to seem as if they were two stories  high. There they stood, rearing their pitiful masquerade amid a fringe  of old tin cans, while at their very doors began a world of crystal  light, a land without end, a space across which Noah and Adam might come  straight from Genesis. Into that space went wandering a road, over a  hill and down out of sight, and up again smaller in the distance, and  down once more, and up once more, straining the eyes, and so away.    Then I heard a fellow greet my Virginian. He came rollicking out of  a door, and made a pass with his hand at the Virginian's hat. The  Southerner dodged it, and I saw once more the tiger undulation of body,  and knew my escort was he of the rope and the corral.    \"How are yu' Steve?\" he said to the rollicking man. And in his tone I  heard instantly old friendship speaking. With Steve he would take and  give familiarity.    Steve looked at me, and looked away--and that was all. But it was  enough. In no company had I ever felt so much an outsider. Yet I liked  the company, and wished that it would like me.    \"Just come to town?\" inquired Steve of the Virginian.    \"Been here since noon. Been waiting for the train.\"    \"Going out to-night?\"    \"I reckon I'll pull out to-morro'.\"    \"Beds are all took,\" said Steve. This was for my benefit.    \"Dear me,\" said I.    \"But I guess one of them drummers will let yu' double up with him.\"  Steve was enjoying himself, I think. He had his saddle and blankets, and  beds were nothing to him.    \"Drummers, are they?\" asked the Virginian.    \"Two Jews handling cigars, one American with consumption killer, and a  Dutchman with jew'lry.\"    The Virginian set down my valise, and seemed to meditate. \"I did want a  bed to-night,\" he murmured gently.    \"Well,\" Steve suggested, \"the American looks like he washed the  oftenest.\"    \"That's of no consequence to me,\" observed the Southerner.    \"Guess it'll be when yu' see 'em.\"    \"Oh, I'm meaning something different. I wanted a bed to myself.\"    \"Then you'll have to build one.\"    \"Bet yu' I have the Dutchman's.\"    \"Take a man that won't scare. Bet yu' drinks yu' can't have the  American's.\"    \"Go yu'\" said the Virginian. \"I'll have his bed without any fuss. Drinks  for the crowd.\"    \"I suppose you have me beat,\" said Steve, grinning at him  affectionately. \"You're such a son-of-a---- when you get down to work.  Well, so long! I got to fix my horse's hoofs.\"    I had expected that the man would be struck down. He had used to the  Virginian a term of heaviest insult, I thought. I had marvelled to hear  it come so unheralded from Steve's friendly lips. And now I marvelled  still more. Evidently he had meant no harm by it, and evidently  no offence had been taken. Used thus, this language was plainly  complimentary. I had stepped into a world new to me indeed, and  novelties were occurring with scarce any time to get breath between  them. As to where I should sleep, I had forgotten that problem  altogether in my curiosity. What was the Virginian going to do now? I  began to know that the quiet of this man was volcanic.    \"Will you wash first, sir?\"    We were at the door of the eating-house, and he set my valise inside.  In my tenderfoot innocence I was looking indoors for the washing  arrangements.    \"It's out hyeh, seh,\" he informed me gravely, but with strong Southern  accent. Internal mirth seemed often to heighten the local flavor of his  speech. There were other times when it had scarce any special accent or  fault in grammar.    A trough was to my right, slippery with soapy water; and hanging from  a roller above one end of it was a rag of discouraging appearance. The  Virginian caught it, and it performed one whirling revolution on its  roller. Not a dry or clean inch could be found on it. He took off his  hat, and put his head in the door.    \"Your towel, ma'am,\" said he, \"has been too popular.\"    She came out, a pretty woman. Her eyes rested upon him for a moment,  then upon me with disfavor; then they returned to his black hair.    \"The allowance is one a day,\" said she, very quietly. \"But when folks  are particular--\" She completed her sentence by removing the old towel  and giving a clean one to us.    \"Thank you, ma'am,\" said the cow-puncher.    She looked once more at his black hair, and without any word returned to  her guests at supper.    A pail stood in the trough, almost empty; and this he filled for me from  a well. There was some soap sliding at large in the trough, but I got my  own. And then in a tin basin I removed as many of the stains of travel  as I was able. It was not much of a toilet that I made in this first  wash-trough of my experience, but it had to suffice, and I took my seat  at supper.    Canned stuff it was,--corned beef. And one of my table companions said  the truth about it. \"When I slung my teeth over that,\" he remarked, \"I  thought I was chewing a hammock.\" We had strange coffee, and condensed  milk; and I have never seen more flies. I made no attempt to talk,  for no one in this country seemed favorable to me. By reason of  something,--my clothes, my hat, my pronunciation, whatever it might be,  I possessed the secret of estranging people at sight. Yet I was doing  better than I knew; my strict silence and attention to the corned beef  made me in the eyes of the cow-boys at table compare well with the  over-talkative commercial travellers.    The Virginian's entrance produced a slight silence. He had done wonders  with the wash-trough, and he had somehow brushed his clothes. With all  the roughness of his dress, he was now the neatest of us. He nodded to  some of the other cow-boys, and began his meal in quiet.    But silence is not the native element of the drummer. An average fish  can go a longer time out of water than this breed can live without  talking. One of them now looked across the table at the grave,  flannel-shirted Virginian; he inspected, and came to the imprudent  conclusion that he understood his man.    \"Good evening,\" he said briskly.    \"Good evening,\" said the Virginian.    \"Just come to town?\" pursued the drummer.    \"Just come to town,\" the Virginian suavely assented.    \"Cattle business jumping along?\" inquired the drummer.    \"Oh, fair.\" And the Virginian took some more corned beef.    \"Gets a move on your appetite, anyway,\" suggested the drummer.    The Virginian drank some coffee. Presently the pretty woman refilled his  cup without his asking her.    \"Guess I've met you before,\" the drummer stated next.    The Virginian glanced at him for a brief moment.    \"Haven't I, now? Ain't I seen you somewhere? Look at me. You been in  Chicago, ain't you? You look at me well. Remember Ikey's, don't you?\"    \"I don't reckon I do.\"    \"See, now! I knowed you'd been in Chicago. Four or five years ago. Or  maybe it's two years. Time's nothing to me. But I never forget a face.  Yes, sir. Him and me's met at Ikey's, all right.\" This important point  the drummer stated to all of us. We were called to witness how well he  had proved old acquaintanceship. \"Ain't the world small, though!\" he  exclaimed complacently. \"Meet a man once and you're sure to run on to  him again. That's straight. That's no bar-room josh.\" And the drummer's  eye included us all in his confidence. I wondered if he had attained  that high perfection when a man believes his own lies.    The Virginian did not seem interested. He placidly attended to his  food, while our landlady moved between dining room and kitchen, and the  drummer expanded.    \"Yes, sir! Ikey's over by the stock-yards, patronized by all cattle-men  that know what's what. That's where. Maybe it's three years. Time never  was nothing to me. But faces! Why, I can't quit 'em.
