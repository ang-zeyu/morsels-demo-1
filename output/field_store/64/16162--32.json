On his examination of the Herculaneum manuscripts, at Naples, in 1818-19,  he was of opinion they had not been acted upon by fire, so as to be  completely carbonized, but that their leaves were cemented together by a  substance formed during the fermentation and chemical change of ages. He  invented a composition for the solution of this substance, but he could  not discover more than 100 out of 1,265 manuscripts, which presented any  probability of success.    Sir Humphry returned to England in 1820, and in the same year his  respected friend, Sir Joseph Banks, President of the Royal Society, died.  Several discussions took place respecting a proper successor, when  individuals of high and even very exalted rank were named as candidates.  But science, very properly in this case, superseded rank. Amongst the  philosophers whose labours had enriched the Transactions of the Royal  Society, two were most generally adverted to, Sir Humphry Davy and Dr.  Wollaston; but Dr. Wollaston very modestly declined being a candidate  after his friend had been nominated, and received from the council of the  Society the unanimous compliment of being placed in the chair of the  Royal Society, till the election by the body in November.[3] A trifling  opposition was made to Sir Humphry Davy's election, by some unknown  persons, who proposed Lord Colchester, but Sir Humphry was placed in the  chair by a majority of 200 to 13. For this honour no one could be more  completely qualified. Sir Humphry retained his seat as President till the  year 1827, when, in consequence of procrastinated ill health, in great  measure brought on by injuries occasioned to his constitution by  scientific experiments, he was induced, by medical advice, to retire to  the continent. He accordingly resigned his seat as President of the Royal  Society, the chair being filled, _pro tem_, by Davies Gilbert, Esq. who,  at the Anniversary Meeting, Nov. 30, 1827, was unanimously elected  President.    Since his retirement, Sir Humphry Davy resided principally at Rome, where  a short time ago he had an alarming attack of a paralytic nature, but  from which he was apparently, though slowly, recovering. Lady Davy, who  had been detained in England by her own ill health, joined Sir Humphry,  at Rome, on hearing of his alarming state. Thence he travelled by easy  stages to Geneva, without feeling any particular inconvenience, and  without any circumstances which denoted the approach of dissolution: but  on Friday, May 29, 1829, the illustrious philosopher closed his mortal  career, in the fifty-first year of his age, having only reached Geneva on  the day previous. Lady Davy had the gratification of contributing, by  her soothing care, to the comfort of his last days during their stay in  Italy, and on their journey to Geneva, where they intended to pass the  summer, and hoped to have derived benefit from the eminent practitioners  of that city. Sir Humphry had also been joined by his brother, Dr. John  Davy, physician to the forces in Malta, whence he came on receiving the  intelligence of his brother's danger. But all human art and skill were  of no avail. The last and fatal attack took place at half-past two on  Friday morning, and the pulse ceased to beat shortly after. The event was  no sooner known, than the afflicted widow received the condolence and  affectionate offer of services from the most distinguished individuals of  Geneva; amongst whom we must mention M. A. de Condolle, the eminent  botanist, and M. Sismondi, the historian, both equally beloved for their  amiable character, as illustrious throughout Europe for their works. M.  de Condolle obligingly took charge of all the details of the interment of  his illustrious colleague; and the governor of the Canton, the Academy of  Geneva, the Consistory of the Geneva Church, the Society of Arts and of  Natural Philosophy and History, together with nearly all the English  resident there, accompanied the remains to the burial-ground, where the  English service was performed by the Rev. Mr. John Magers of Queen's  College, and the Rev. Mr. Burgess. The members of the Academy, in the  absence of any relation of the deceased, took their place in the funeral  procession; and the invitations to the syndicate, and to the learned  bodies who accompanied it, were made by that body in the same character.  The whole was conducted with much appropriate order and decency, and  whilst every attention and respect were paid to the memory of the  deceased, nothing was attempted beyond the unostentatious simplicity  which the deceased had frequently declared to be his wish, whenever his  mortal remains should be consigned to their last home; and which in  accordance to that wish, had been expressly enjoined to her kind friends  by the afflicted widow. In the procession, which followed the corporate  bodies and the countrymen of the deceased, were many of the most eminent  manufacturers of Geneva, and a large body of mechanics, who were anxious  to pay this tribute of regard and gratitude to one whom they deservedly  looked upon as a great benefactor to the arts, and promoter of sciences,  by the application of which they earn their livelihood.[4]    During his retirement on the Continent, Sir Humphry continued to  communicate the splendid results of his labours to the Royal Society,  and at the anniversary meeting of the year 1827, the royal medal was  awarded to him for a series of brilliant discoveries developing the  relation between electricity and chemistry.[5] Upon this interesting  occasion, Mr. Davies Gilbert spoke at some length, commencing as  follows: \"It is with feelings most gratifying to myself that I now  approach to the award of a royal medal to Sir Humphry Davy; and I esteem  it a most fortunate occurrence, that this award should have taken place  during the short period of my having to discharge the duties attached to  the office of president; having witnessed the whole progress of Sir  Humphry Davy's advancement in science and in reputation, from his first  attempts in his native town to vary some of Dr. Priestly's experiments  on the extraction of oxygen from marine vegetables to the point of  eminence which we all know him to have reached. It is not necessary for  me more than to advert to his discovery of nitrous oxyde; to his  investigation of the action of light on gases; on the nature of heat; to  his successful discrimination of proximate vegetable elements; nor to  his most scientific, ingenious, and useful invention, the  safety-lamp,--an invention reasoned out from its principles, with all  the accuracy and precision of mathematical deduction.\"    The course of Sir Humphry Davy to the highest rank as a chemical  philosopher, was, after his appointment at the Royal Institution, rapid  and brilliant; and if he was previously aided by as few of the advantages  of fortune as any man living, he had then at his disposal whatever his  industry and talents chose to command. We have given but a hasty outline  of his labours; but it is possible that he may have left behind him much,  not yet made public, for which, science will be still further indebted to  him. His works, papers, and letters are numerous, and the greatest  portion of them are contained in the Transactions of the Royal Society.  One of the most popular and interesting of his recent papers is that on  the _Phenomena of Volcanoes_. This contains a series of investigations of  Vesuvius, made by the author during a residence at Naples in 1819-20, and  bearing upon a previous hypothesis, \"that metals of the alkalies and  earth might exist in the interior of the globe, and on being exposed to  the action of air and water, give rise to volcanic fires, and to the  production of lavas, by the slow cooling of which basaltic and other  crystalline rocks might subsequently be formed.\" We have not space for  the details of these investigations, interesting as they would prove to  an unscientific reader; but we give an abstract of the result of Sir  Humphry's observations:    \"The phenomena observed by the author afforded a sufficient refutation of  all the ancient hypotheses, in which volcanic fires were ascribed to such  chemical causes as the combustion of mineral coal, or the action of  sulphur upon iron; and are perfectly consistent with the supposition of  their depending upon the oxidation of the metals of the earths upon an  extensive scale, in immense subterranean cavities, to which water or  atmospheric air may occasionally have access. The subterranean thunder  heard at great distances under Vesuvius, prior to an eruption, indicates  the vast extent of these cavities; and the existence of a subterranean  communication between the Solfattara and Vesuvius, is established by the  fact that whenever the latter is in an active state, the former is  comparatively tranquil. In confirmation of these views, the author  remarks, that almost all the volcanoes of considerable magnitude in the  old world, are in the vicinity of the sea; and in those where the sea is  more distant, as in the volcanoes of South America, the water may be  supplied from great subterranean lakes; for Humboldt states that some of  them throw up quantities of fish. The author acknowledges, however, that  the hypothesis of the nucleus of the globe being composed of matter  liquefied by heat, offers a still more simple solution of the phenomena  of volcanic fires.\"[6]    We have hitherto spoken of Sir Humphry Davy as a philosopher. He was,  however, in every respect, an accomplished scholar, and was well  acquainted with foreign languages. He always retained a strong taste for  literary pleasures; and when his continued illness retarded his  scientific pursuits, he made literature his recreation. In this manner he  wrote _Salmonia: or Days of Fly-fishing_, in a series of conversations,  we gather from the Preface:-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12019"],[0,"Queen Hortense: A Life Picture of the Napoleonic Era (#3)"],[1,"of Terror--the red flag--still cast its bloody  shadow over Paris. Its inhabitants were terror-stricken; no one knew in  the evening that he would still be at liberty on the following day, or  that he would live to see another sunset. Death lay in wait at every  door, and reaped its dread harvest in every house and in every family.  In the face of these horrors, Josephine forgot all her earlier griefs,  all the insults and humiliations to which she had been subjected by her  husband; the old love revived in her breast, and, as it might well be  that on the morrow death would come knocking at her own door, she wished  to devote the present moment to a reconciliation with her husband, and a  reunion with her son.    But all her attempts in this direction were in vain. The viscount had  felt her flight to Martinique to be too grave an injury, too great an  insult, to be now willing to consent to a reconciliation with his wife.  Sympathizing friends arranged a meeting between them, without, however,  previously informing the viscount of their design. His anger was  therefore great when, on entering the parlor of Count Montmorin, in  response to that gentleman's invitation, he found there the wife he had  so obstinately and wrathfully avoided. He was about to retire hastily,  when a charming child rushed forward, greeted him tenderly in silvery  tones, and threw herself into his arms. The viscount was now powerless  to fly; he pressed his child, his Hortense, to his heart, and when the  child, with a winning smile, entreated him to kiss her mamma as he had  kissed her; when he saw the beautiful countenance of Josephine wet with  tears; when he heard his father's voice saying, \"My son, reconcile  yourself with my daughter! Josephine is my daughter, and I would not  call her so if she were unworthy,\" and when he saw his handsome son,  Eugene, gazing at him wistfully, his head resting on his mother's  shoulder, his heart relented. Leading little Hortense by the hand, he  stepped forward to his wife, and, with a loud cry of joy and a blissful  greeting of love, Josephine sank on his bosom.    Peace was re-established, and husband and wife were now united in a  closer bond of love than ever before. The storms seemed to have spent  their rage, and the heaven of their happiness was clear and cloudless.  But this heaven was soon to be overcast with the black shadow of the  revolution.    Viscount Beauharnais, returned by the nobility of Blois to the new  legislative body, the Estates-General, resigned this position, in order  to serve his country with his sword instead of his tongue. With the rank  of adjutant-general, he repaired to the Army of the North, accompanied  by Josephine's blessings and tears. A dread premonition told her that  she would never see the general again, and this premonition did not  deceive her. The spirit of anarchy and insurrection not only raged among  the people of Paris, but also in the army. The aristocrats, who were  given over to the guillotine in Paris, were also regarded with distrust  and hatred in the army, and Viscount Beauharnais, who, for his gallantry  on the battle-field of Soissons, had been promoted to the position of  commanding general, was accused by his own officers of being an enemy of  France and of the new order of things. He was arrested, taken back to  Paris, and thrown into the prison of the Luxembourg, where so many other  victims of the revolution lay in confinement.    The sad intelligence of her husband's misfortune soon reached Josephine,  and aroused her love to energetic action in his behalf. She mentally  vowed to liberate her husband, the father of her children, or to die  with him. She courageously confronted all dangers, all suspicions, and  was happy when she found him in his prison, where she visited him,  whispering words of consolation and hope in his ear.    But at that time love and fidelity were also capital crimes, and  Josephine's guilt was twofold: first, because she was an aristocrat  herself, and secondly, because she loved and wept for the fate of an  aristocrat, and an alleged traitor to his country. Josephine was  arrested and thrown into the prison of St. Pelagie.    Eugene and Hortense were now little better than orphans, for the  prisoners of the Luxembourg and St. Pelagie, at that time, only left  their prisons to mount the scaffold. Alone, deprived of all help,  avoided by all whom they had once known and loved, the two children were  threatened with misery, want, and even with hunger, for the estate of  their parents had been confiscated, and, in the same hour in which  Josephine was conducted to prison, the entrances and doors of their  dwelling were sealed, and the poor children left to find a sheltering  roof for themselves. But yet they were not entirely helpless, not quite  friendless, for a friend of Josephine, a Madame Ho1stein, had the  courage to come to the rescue, and take the children into her  own family.    But it was necessary to go to work cautiously and wisely, in order to  avoid exciting the hatred and vengeance of those who, coming from the  scum of the people, were now the rulers of France. An imprudent word, a  look, might suffice to cast suspicion upon, and render up to the  guillotine, this good Madame Ho1stein, this courageous friend of the two  children. It was in itself a capital crime that she had taken the  children of the accused into her house, and it was therefore necessary  to adopt every means of conciliating the authorities. It was thought  necessary that Hortense should, in company with her protectress, attend  the festivals and patriotic processions, that were renewed at every  decade in honor of the one and indivisible republic, but she was never  required to take an active part in these celebrations. She was not  considered worthy to figure among the daughters of the people; she had  not yet been forgiven for being the daughter of a viscount, of an  imprisoned _ci-devant._ Eugene had been apprenticed to a carpenter, and  the son of the viscount was now often seen walking through the streets  in a blouse, carrying a board on his shoulder or a saw under his arm.    While the children of the accused were thus enjoying temporary security,  the future of their parents was growing darker and darker, and not only  the life of the general, but also that of his wife, was now seriously  endangered. Josephine had been removed from the prison of St. Pelagie to  that of the Carmelites, and this brought her a step nearer the scaffold.  But she did not tremble for herself, she thought only of her children  and her husband; she wrote affectionate letters to the former, which she  bribed her jailer to forward to their destination, but all her efforts  to place herself in communication with her husband were abortive. One  day she received the fearful intelligence that her husband had just been  conducted before the revolutionary tribunal. Josephine waited for  further intelligence in an agony of suspense. Had this tribunal  acquitted her husband, or had it condemned him to death? Was he already  free, or was he free in a higher sense--was he dead? If he were free, he  would have found means to inform her of the fact; and if he were dead,  his name would certainly have been mentioned in the list of the  condemned. In this agony of suspense, Josephine passed the long day.  Night came, but brought no rest for her and her companions in  misery--the other occupants of the prison--who also looked death in the  face, and who watched with her throughout the long night.    The society assembled in this prison was brilliant and select. There  were the Dowager Duchess de Choiseul, the Viscountess de Maille, whose  seventeen-years-old daughter had just been guillotined; there was the  Marquise de Crequi, the intellectual lady who has often been called the  last marquise of the _ancien regime_, and who in her witty memoirs wrote  the French history of the eighteenth century as viewed from an  aristocratic standpoint. There was Abbe Texier, who, when the  revolutionists threatened him with the lantern, because he had refused  to take the oath of allegiance to the new constitution, replied: \"Will  you see any better after having hung me to the lantern?\" And there was  yet another, a M. Duvivier, a pupil of Cagliostro, who, like his  master, could read the future, and with the assistance of a decanter  full of water and a \"dove,\" that is, an innocent young girl of less than  seven, could solve the mysteries of fate.    To him, to the Grand Cophta, Josephine now addressed herself after this  day of dread uncertainty, and demanded information of the fate of  her husband.    In the stillness of the night the gloomy, desolate hall of the prison  now presented a strange aspect. The jailer, bribed with an assignat of  fifty francs, then worth only forty sous, however, had consented that  his little six-years-old daughter should serve the Grand Cophta as  \"dove,\" and had made all other preparations. A table stood in the middle  of the hall, on which was a decanter filled with clear, fresh water,  around which were three candles in the form of a triangle, and placed as  near the decanter as possible, in order that the dove should be able to  see the better. The little girl, just aroused from sleep and brought  from her bed in her night-gown, sat on a chair close to the table, and  behind her stood the earnest, sombre figure of the Grand Cophta. Around  the table stood the prisoners, these duchesses and marquises, these  ladies of the court of Versailles who had preserved their aristocratic  manners in the prison, and were even here so strictly observant of  etiquette, that those of them who had enjoyed the honor of the  _tabouret_ in the Tuileries, were here accorded the same precedence, and  all possible consideration shown them.    On the other side of the table, in breathless suspense, her large, dark  eyes fastened on the child with a"]]]
