They may  later prove to be partially or wholly wrong. They have the value,  nevertheless, of explaining in many cases why I did or did not do  certain things, and of disclosing the state of mind that in a measure  determined my conduct which without this recital of contemporaneous  impressions might mystify one familiar with what afterwards took place.  The notes, letters, and memoranda which are quoted in the succeeding  pages, as well as the opinions and beliefs held at the time (of which,  in accordance with a practice of years, I kept a record supplementing my  daily journal of events), should be weighed and measured by the  situation which existed when they were written and not alone in the  light of the complete review of the proceedings. In forming an opinion  as to my differences with the President it should be the reader's  endeavor to place himself in my position at the time and not judge them  solely by the results of the negotiations at Paris. It comes to this:  Was I justified then? Am I justified now? If those questions are  answered impartially and without prejudice, there is nothing further  that I would ask of the reader.          CHAPTER II    MR. WILSON'S PRESENCE AT THE PEACE CONFERENCE      Early in October, 1918, it required no prophetic vision to perceive that  the World War would come to an end in the near future. Austria-Hungary,  acting with the full approval of the German Government, had made  overtures for peace, and Bulgaria, recognizing the futility of further  struggle, had signed an armistice which amounted to an unconditional  surrender. These events were soon followed by the collapse of Turkish  resistance and by the German proposals which resulted in the armistice  which went into effect on November 11, 1918.    In view of the importance of the conditions of the armistice with  Germany and their relation to the terms of peace to be later negotiated,  the President considered it essential to have an American member added  to the Supreme War Council, which then consisted of M. Clemenceau, Mr.  Lloyd George, and Signor Orlando, the premiers of the three Allied  Powers. He selected Colonel Edward M. House for this important post and  named him a Special Commissioner to represent him personally. Colonel  House with a corps of secretaries and assistants sailed from New York on  October 17, _en route_ for Paris where the Supreme War Council was  in session.    Three days before his departure the Colonel was in Washington and we had  two long conferences with the President regarding the correspondence  with Germany and with the Allies relating to a cessation of hostilities,  during which we discussed the position which the United States should  take as to the terms of the armistice and the bases of peace which  should be incorporated in the document.    It was after one of these conferences that Colonel House informed me  that the President had decided to name him (the Colonel) and me as two  of the American plenipotentiaries to the Peace Conference, and that the  President was considering attending the Conference and in person  directing the negotiations. This latter intention of Mr. Wilson  surprised and disturbed me, and I expressed the hope that the  President's mind was not made up, as I believed that if he gave more  consideration to the project he would abandon it, since it was manifest  that his influence over the negotiations would be much greater if he  remained in Washington and issued instructions to his representatives in  the Conference. Colonel House did not say that he agreed with my  judgment in this matter, though he did not openly disagree with it.  However, I drew the conclusion, though without actual knowledge, that he  approved of the President's purpose, and, possibly, had encouraged him  to become an actual participant in the preliminary conferences.    The President's idea of attending the Peace Conference was not a new  one. Though I cannot recollect the source of my information, I know that  in December, 1916, when it will be remembered Mr. Wilson was endeavoring  to induce the belligerents to state their objects in the war and to  enter into a conference looking toward peace, he had an idea that he  might, as a friend of both parties, preside over such a conference and  exert his personal influence to bring the belligerents into agreement. A  service of this sort undoubtedly appealed to the President's  humanitarian instinct and to his earnest desire to end the devastating  war, while the novelty of the position in which he would be placed would  not have been displeasing to one who in his public career seemed to find  satisfaction in departing from the established paths marked out by  custom and usage.    When, however, the attempt at mediation failed and when six weeks later,  on February 1, 1917, the German Government renewed indiscriminate  submarine warfare resulting in the severance of diplomatic relations  between the United States and Germany, President Wilson continued to  cherish the hope that he might yet assume the role of mediator. He even  went so far as to prepare a draft of the bases of peace, which he  purposed to submit to the belligerents if they could be induced to meet  in conference. I cannot conceive how he could have expected to bring  this about in view of the elation of the Allies at the dismissal of  Count von Bernstorff and the seeming certainty that the United States  would declare war against Germany if the latter persisted in her  ruthless sinking of American merchant vessels. But I know, in spite of  the logic of the situation, that he expected or at least hoped to  succeed in his mediatory programme and made ready to play his part in  the negotiation of a peace.    From the time that Congress declared that a state of war existed between  the United States and the Imperial German Government up to the autumn of  1918, when the Central Alliance made overtures to end the war, the  President made no attempt so far as I am aware to enter upon peace  negotiations with the enemy nations. In fact he showed a disposition to  reject all peace proposals. He appears to have reached the conclusion  that the defeat of Germany and her allies was essential before permanent  peace could be restored. At all events, he took no steps to bring the  belligerents together until a military decision had been practically  reached. He did, however, on January 8,1918, lay down his famous  \"Fourteen Points,\" which he supplemented with certain declarations in  \"subsequent addresses,\" thus proclaiming his ideas as to the proper  bases of peace when the time should come to negotiate.    Meanwhile, in anticipation of the final triumph of the armies of the  Allied and Associated Powers, the President, in the spring of 1917,  directed the organization, under the Department of State, of a body of  experts to collect data and prepare monographs, charts, and maps,  covering all historical, territorial, economic, and legal subjects which  would probably arise in the negotiation of a treaty of peace. This  Commission of Inquiry, as it was called, had its offices in New York and  was under Colonel House so far as the selection of its members was  concerned. The nominal head of the Commission was Dr. Mezes, President  of the College of the City of New York and a brother-in-law of Colonel  House, though the actual and efficient executive head was Dr. Isaiah  Bowman, Director of the American Geographical Society. The plans of  organization, the outline of work, and the proposed expenditures for the  maintenance of the Commission were submitted to me as Secretary of  State. I examined them and, after several conferences with Dr. Mezes,  approved them and recommended to the President that he allot the funds  necessary to carry out the programme.    In addition to the subjects which were dealt with by this excellent  corps of students and experts, whose work was of the highest order, the  creation of some sort of an international association to prevent wars in  the future received special attention from the President as it did from  Americans of prominence not connected with the Government. It caused  considerable discussion in the press and many schemes were proposed and  pamphlets written on the subject. To organize such an association became  a generally recognized object to be attained in the negotiation of the  peace which would end the World War; and there can be no doubt that the  President believed more and more in the vital necessity of forming an  effective organization of the nations to preserve peace in the future  and make another great war impossible.    The idea of being present and taking an active part in formulating the  terms of peace had, in my opinion, never been abandoned by President  Wilson, although it had remained dormant while the result of the  conflict was uncertain. When, however, in early October, 1918, there  could no longer be any doubt that the end of the war was approaching,  the President appears to have revived the idea and to have decided, if  possible, to carry out the purpose which he had so long cherished. He  seemed to have failed to appreciate, or, if he did appreciate, to have  ignored the fact that the conditions were wholly different in October,  1918, from what they were in December, 1916.    In December, 1916, the United States was a neutral nation, and the  President, in a spirit of mutual friendliness, which was real and not  assumed, was seeking to bring the warring powers together in conference  looking toward the negotiation of \"a peace without victory.\" In the  event that he was able to persuade them to meet, his presence at the  conference as a pacificator and probably as the presiding officer would  not improbably have been in the interests of peace, because,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10475"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 12, No. 326, August (#3)"],[1,"was so extensive as to give me  a glimpse of Ehrenbreitstein, and of the line of hills from thence to  the Siebengebrige. Though my object in climbing the Feitsberg was very  different, my surprise and delight in unexpectedly catching  Ehrenbreitstein at the distance of twenty-four miles even served to  withdraw my attention some time from geologizing, or from the scene  close under me. I recollect the same sensation on descrying Gravelines  sometime ago from the heights of Dover Castle, not believing the  distance to be within the powers of the telescope. True indeed is it  that      \"Tis distance lends enchantment to the view.    And robes the mountain in its azure hue.\"    I was now in a rude and barren country, presenting a strong contrast to  the soft scenery I had left, and consisting of an elevated mountain  plateau, or table land of slate of the Greywacke sort, the heights on  the eastern side of the Rhine being of the same level, and the channel  of the river appearing as a narrow valley, which the eye overlooks  entirely. This table land is studded with isolated hills of volcanic  formation, and of a conical form, some of them having central funnels or  craters, from which the ancient eruptions have issued. The most complete  are the Hirschenberg, near Burgbrohl, the Bousenberg, between that  village and Olburg, the Poter, Pellenberg, and the Camillenberg, which  last rises about one thousand feet above the level of the surrounding  surface. There are many others extending for some distance in the Eiffel  chain and in the vicinity, but those I have mentioned are sufficient to  guide the footsteps of the inquirer. The basin of the Lake of Laach is  nearly circular and crateriform; it is a mile and a half long, and about  a mile and a quarter in breadth. Its average depth is two hundred feet,  but it is full of holes, the measure of which is very uncertain. Its  water is blueish, very cold, and of a nasty brackish taste. It has been  examined by several geologists, British and foreign, among whom is the  famous Humboldt, and there is no doubt that this great reservoir is the  crater of an extinct volcano. The fragments and minerals thrown up on  the banks are analogous to those found in other volcanic countries; and  on one side (that towards Nieder-mennig) is a regular rock of continued  lava, which is supposed to have flowed from the crater during the last  eruption. Mr. Scrope, whose opinion is entitled to great weight, thinks  it not improbable that this may have been the eruption recorded by  Tacitus, (13 lib. Annal.,) as having ravaged the country of the  Initones, near Cologne, in the reign of Nero. I should not forget to  mention that there is a cavern within the basin of the lake, the air of  which is so stifling and noxious, that animals die if forced to remain  in it, and lights are extinguished by the gas--phenomena precisely  similar to those of the well-known Grotto del Cane, near Naples.    While I am on the subject of volcanic phenomena, I may as well add a  word on the origin of the trass or tufa, which is so thickly spread over  this country. It is similar to that found near Naples, at Mont d'Or,  Carbal, and other parts of Italy; and, indeed, all the products of the  latter district are pretty nearly the same as these, allowing for the  difference of a slate surface in the one case, and a sandy and alluvial  soil in the other. The idea of the trass having any connexion with a  deluge, is, I believe, now exploded; and geologists have agreed that it  is the actual substance ejected by the volcano, subsided into a firm  paste. The rain has always been observed to fall heavily after  eruptions, and the water running down the sides of the hills, has formed  this crust, which makes the bottom and sides of the Laach. The same  causes are in action now; and if ever the lake should rise so high as to  burst its banks, it would overflow the whole country, and carry terrible  destruction with it. Such an event was actually foreseen by the  sagacious monks who formerly inhabited the abbey, for they cut a canal  nearly a mile long, to give the water vent; and the discharge by it  continues to this day. The abbey is now untenanted, and is in a  deplorable state of ruin; it was once celebrated for its hospitality and  a fine gallery of pictures; all, however, have vanished, and the ruins  are now the property of M. Delius, a magistrate of Treves. The situation  is so beautiful, surrounded as it is with fine timber, that one would  suppose it worth his while to repair the place, particularly as stone is  so plentiful in the neighbourhood. It forms, however, as it is, a  picturesque addition to the interest of the excursion to the lake, I  returned by the mineral spring of Heilbrunn, well satisfied with my  inspection of the country. The distance from Brohl to the abbey is  little more than five miles, and it is one which I would advise all  tourists on the Rhine to make if they have time, whether they be  geologists or non-geologists. I fancied I had a clearer conception of.  Aetna and Vesuvius, and the living fires, from having witnessed the  funnels of the extinct ones. At all events, though little is known as to  the causes of volcanic phenomena, enough is ascertained to convince us  that subterranean fire exists under the whole of Europe, there not being  one country or district exempt from occasional earthquakes, or some such  signs of terror.    D.           *       *       *       *       *        THE SKETCH-BOOK      GARDEN OF BREMHILL PARSONAGE.    _The Residence of the Rev. W. L. Bowles._      The garden contains upwards of two acres, with a gravel-walk under the  windows. A Gothic porch has been added, the bow-windows being surmounted  with the same kind of parapet as the house, somewhat more ornamental. It  lies to the morning sun; the road to the house, on the north, enters  through a large arch. The garden is on a slope, commanding views of the  surrounding country, with the tower of Calne in front, the woods of  Bowood on the right, and the mansion and woods of Walter Heneage, Esq.  Towards the south. The view to the south-east is terminated by the last  chalky cliffs of the Marlborough downs, extending to within a few miles  of Swindon. In the garden, a winding path from the gravel-walk, in front  of the house, leads to a small piece of water, originally a square pond.    This walk, as it approaches the water, leads into a darker shade, and  descending some steps, placed to give a picturesque appearance to the  bank, you enter a kind of cave, with a dripping rill, which falls into  the water below, whose bank is broken by thorns, and hazels, and  poplars, among darker shrubs. Here an urn appears with the following  inscription:--\"M.S. Henrici Bowles, qui ad Calpen, febre ibi exitiali  grassante, publice missus, ipse miserrime periit--1804. Fratri  posuit.\"--Passing round the water, you come to an arched walk of hazels,  which leads to the green in front of the house, where, dipping a small  slope, the path passes near an old and ivied elm. As this seat looks on  the magnificent line of Bowood park and plantations, the obvious thought  could not be well avoided:      \"When in thy sight another's vast domain    Spreads its dark sweep of woods, dost thou complain?    Nay! rather thank the God who placed thy state    Above the lowly, but beneath the great;    And still his name with gratitude revere,    Who bless'd the sabbath of thy leisure here.\"    The walk leads round a plantation of shrubs, to the bottom of the lawn,  from whence is seen a fountain, between a laurel arch; and through a  dark passage a gray sun-dial appears among beds of flowers, opposite the  fountain.    The sun-dial, a small, antique, twisted column, gray with age, was  probably the dial of the abbot of Malmesbury, and counted his hours when  at the adjoining lodge; for it was taken from the garden of the  farm-house, which had originally been the summer retirement of this  mitred lord. It has the appearance of being _monastic_, but a more  ornate capital has been added, the plate on which bears the date of  1688. I must again venture to give the appropriate inscription:--      \"To count the brief and unreturning hours,    This Sun-Dial was placed among the flowers,    Which came forth in their beauty--smiled and died,    Blooming and withering round its ancient side.    Mortal, thy day is passing--see that flower,    And think upon the Shadow and the Hour!\"    The whole of the small green slope is here dotted with beds of flowers;  a step, into some rock-work, leads to a kind of hermit's oratory, with  crucifix and stained glass, built to receive the shattered fragments, as  their last asylum, of the pillars of Stanly Abbey.    The dripping water passes through the rock-work into a large shell, the  gift of a valued friend, the author of \"The Pleasures of Memory;\" and I  add, with less hesitation, the inscription, because it was furnished by  the author of \"The Pains of Memory,\" a poem, in its kind, of the most  exquisite harmony and fancy, though the author has long left the bowers  of the muses, and the harp of music, for the severe professional duties  of the bar. I have some pride in mentioning the name of Peregrine  Bingham, being a near relation, as well as rising in character and fame  at the bar. The verses will speak for themselves, and are not unworthy  his muse whose poem suggested the comparisons. The inscription is placed  over the large Indian shell:--      \"Snatch'd from an Indian ocean's roar,    I drink the whelming tide no more;    But in this rock, remote and still,    Now serve to pour the murmuring rill.    Listen! Do thoughts awake, which long have slept--    Oh! like his song, who placed me here,    The sweetest song to Memory dear,    When life's tumultuous storms are past,    May we, to such sweet music, close at last    The eyelids that have wept!\"    Leaving the small oratory, a"]]]
