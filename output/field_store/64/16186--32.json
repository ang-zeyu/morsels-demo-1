Take the skin off the beef, have the yelk of an egg well  beaten, dip a feather in it and wash the top of your beef, sprinkle over  it the crumb of stale bread finely grated, put it in a Dutch oven  previously heated, put the top on with coals enough to brown, but not  burn the beef; let it stand nearly an hour, and prepare your gravy  thus:--Take a sufficient quantity of soup and the vegetables boiled in  it; add to it a table-spoonful of red wine, and two of mushroom catsup,  thicken with a little bit of butter and a little brown flour; make it  very hot, pour it in your dish, and put the beef on it. Garnish it with  green pickle, cut in thin slices, serve up the soup in a tureen with  bits of toasted bread.           *       *       *       *       *    VEAL SOUP.    Put into a pot three quarts of water, three onions cut small, one  spoonful of black pepper pounded, and two of salt, with two or three  slices of lean ham; let it boil steadily two hours; skim it  occasionally, then put into it a shin of veal, let it boil two hours  longer; take out the slices of ham, and skim off the grease if any  should rise, take a gill of good cream, mix with it two table-spoonsful  of flour very nicely, and the yelks of two eggs beaten well, strain this  mixture, and add some chopped parsley; pour some soup on by degrees,  stir it well, and pour it into the pot, continuing to stir until it has  boiled two or three minutes to take off the raw taste of the eggs. If  the cream be not perfectly sweet, and the eggs quite new, the thickening  will curdle in the soup. For a change you may put a dozen ripe tomatos  in, first taking off their skins, by letting them stand a few minutes in  hot water, when they may be easily peeled. When made in this way you  must thicken it with the flour only. Any part of the veal may be used,  but the shin or knuckle is the nicest.           *       *       *       *       *    OYSTER SOUP.    Wash and drain two quarts of oysters, put them on with three quarts of  water, three onions chopped up, two or three slices of lean ham, pepper  and salt; boil it till reduced one-half, strain it through a sieve,  return the liquid into the pot, put in one quart of fresh oysters, boil  it till they are sufficiently done, and thicken the soup with four  spoonsful of flour, two gills of rich cream, and the yelks of six new  laid eggs beaten well; boil it a few minutes after the thickening is put  in. Take care that it does not curdle, and that the flour is not in  lumps; serve it up with the last oysters that were put in. If the  flavour of thyme be agreeable, you may put in a little, but take care  that it does not boil in it long enough to discolour the soup.           *       *       *       *       *    BARLEY SOUP.    Put on three gills of barley, three quarts of water, few onions cut up,  six carrots scraped and cut into dice, an equal quantity of turnips cut  small; boil it gently two hours, then put in four or five pounds of the  rack or neck of mutton, a few slices of lean ham, with pepper and salt;  boil it slowly two hours longer and serve it up. Tomatos are an  excellent addition to this soup.           *       *       *       *       *    DRIED PEA SOUP.    Take one quart of split peas, or Lima beans, which are better; put them  in three quarts of very soft water with three onions chopped up, pepper  and salt; boil them two hours; mash them well and pass them through a  sieve; return the liquid into the pot, thicken it with a large piece of  butter and flour, put in some slices of nice salt pork, and a large  tea-spoonful of celery seed pounded; boil it till the pork is done, and  serve it up; have some toasted bread cut into dice and fried in butter,  which must be put in the tureen before you pour in the soup.           *       *       *       *       *    GREEN PEA SOUP.    Make it exactly as you do the dried pea soup, only in place of the  celery seed, put a handful of mint chopped small, and a pint of young  peas, which must be boiled in the soup till tender; thicken it with a  quarter of a pound of butter, and two spoonsful of flour.           *       *       *       *       *    OCHRA SOUP.    Get two double handsful of young ochra, wash and slice it thin, add two  onions chopped fine, put it into a gallon of water at a very early hour  in an earthen pipkin, or very nice iron pot; it must be kept steadily  simmering, but not boiling: put in pepper and salt. At 12 o'clock, put  in a handful of Lima beans; at half-past one o'clock, add three young  cimlins cleaned and cut in small pieces, a fowl, or knuckle of veal, a  bit of bacon or pork that has been boiled, and six tomatos, with the  skin taken off; when nearly done, thicken with a spoonful of butter,  mixed with one of flour. Have rice boiled to eat with it.           *       *       *       *       *    HARE OR RABBIT SOUP.    Cut up two hares, put them into a pot with a piece of bacon, two onions  chopped, a bundle of thyme and parsley, which must be taken out before  the soup is thickened, add pepper, salt, pounded cloves, and mace, put  in a sufficient quantity of water, stew it gently three hours, thicken  with a large spoonful of butter, and one of brown flour, with a glass of  red wine; boil it a few minutes longer, and serve it up with the nicest  parts of the hares. Squirrels make soup equally good, done the same way.           *       *       *       *       *    SOUP OF ANY KIND OF OLD FOWL.    _The, only way in which they are eatable._ Put the fowls in a coop and  feed them moderately for a fortnight; kill one and cleanse it, cut off  the legs and wings, and separate the breast from the ribs, which,  together with the whole back, must be thrown away, being too gross and  strong for use. Take the skin and fat from the parts cut off which are  also gross. Wash the pieces nicely, and put them on the fire with abort  a pound of bacon, a large onion chopped small, some pepper and salt, a  few blades of mace, a handful of parsley, cut up very fine, and two  quarts of water, if it be a common fowl or duck--a turkey will require  more water. Boil it gently for three hours, tie up a small bunch of  thyme, and let it boil in it half an hour, then take it out. Thicken  your soup with a large spoonful of butter rubbed into two of flour, the  yelks of two eggs, and half a pint of milk. Be careful not to let it  curdle in the soup.           *       *       *       *       *    CATFISH SOUP.    _An excellent dish for those who have not imbibed a needless prejudice  against those delicious fish._    Take two large or four small white catfish that have been caught in deep  water, cut off the heads, and skin and clean the bodies; cut each in  three parts, put them in a pot, with a pound of lean bacon, a large  onion cut up, a handful of parsley chopped small, some pepper and salt,  pour in a sufficient quantity of water, and stew them till the fish are  quite tender but not broken; beat the yelks of four fresh eggs, add to  them a large spoonful of butter, two of flour, and half a pint of rich  milk; make all these warm and thicken the soup, take out the bacon, and  put some of the fish in your tureen, pour in the soup, and serve it up.           *       *       *       *       *    ONION SOUP.    Chop up twelve large onions, boil them in three quarts of milk and water  equally mixed, put in a bit of veal or fowl, and a piece of bacon with  pepper and salt. When the onions are boiled to pulp, thicken it with a  large spoonful of butter mixed with one of flour. Take out the meat, and  serve it up with toasted bread cut in small pieces in the soup.           *       *       *       *       *    TO DRESS TURTLE.    Kill it at night in winter, and in the morning in summer. Hang it up by  the hind fins, cut off the head and let it bleed well. Separate the  bottom shell from the top, with great care, lest the gall bladder be  broken, which must be cautiously taken out and thrown away. Put the  liver in a bowl of water. Empty the guts and lay them in water; if there  be eggs, put them also in water. It is proper to have a separate bowl of  water for each article. Cut all the flesh from the bottom shell, and lay  it in water; then break the shell in two, put it in a pot after having  washed it clean; pour on as much water as will cover it entirely, add  one pound of middling, or flitch of bacon, with four onions chopped, and  set it on the fire to boil. Open the guts, cleanse them perfectly; take  off the inside skin, and put them in the pot with the shell; let them  boil steadily for three hours, and if the water boils away too much, add  more. Wash the top shell nicely after taking out the flesh, cover it,  and set it by. Parboil the fins, clean them nicely--taking off all the  black skin, and put them in water; cut the flesh taken from the bottom  and top shell, in small pieces; cut the fins in two, lay them with the  flesh in a dish; sprinkle some salt over, and cover them up. When the  shell, &c. is done, take out the bacon, scrape the shell clean, and  strain the liquor; about one quart of which must be put back in the pot;  reserve the rest for soup; pick out the guts, and cut them in small  pieces; take all the nice bits that were strained out, put them with the  guts into the gravy; lay in the fins cut in pieces with them, and as  much of the flesh as will be sufficient to fill the upper shell; add to  it, (if a large turtle,) one bottle of white wine; cayenne pepper, and  salt, to your taste, one gill of mushroom catsup, one gill of lemon  pickle, mace, nutmegs and cloves, pounded, to season it high. Mix two  large spoonsful of flour in one pound and a quarter of butter; put it in  with thyme, parsley, marjoram and savory, tied in bunches; stew all  these"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12539"],[0,"Observations Upon the Windward Coast of Africa (#3)"],[1,"to embark for Europe, where circumstances required me by the  first conveyance, I visited the colony of Sierra Leone, then under the  government of the late Capt. William Day, of the Royal Navy, to whom I had  a recommendatory letter. His reception of me was in conformity with his  general character, distinguished for urbanity and polite hospitality; and  such were the impressions upon my mind, both from observation and report,  of the skill and penetration he possessed to fulfil the arduous duties of  his station, that they never will be effaced, and I shall ever retain the  highest respect for his memory. He was then occupied in forming plans of  defence in the colony; and had he lived, I am firmly persuaded, from  subsequent observation and enquiry, that it would in a short period have  opposed to an enemy a formidable resistance, and that it might have been  speedily rescued from that anarchy and confusion which distracted councils,  and want of unanimity had occasioned.    The colony of Sierra Leone was established by the 31st of George III.  avowedly in opposition to the Slave Trade, and for the purpose of  augmenting more natural commerce, and introducing civilization among the  natives of Africa. The grant is from the 1st of July, 1791, and to continue  for the space of 31 years. During the late war with France, in September  1794, it was nearly destroyed by a French squadron, consisting of one  two-decker, several armed ships and brigs, in the whole about seven or  eight sail; they appeared in the offing on the evening of the 27th, and in  the morning of the 28th at day-light commenced their operations; the result  of which was, that the colony was ravaged by the enemy, and many houses  burnt and destroyed. This squadron was piloted into the river by two  Americans, one of whom was a Captain Neville. The pecuniary loss to the  colony by this attack has been estimated at about 40,000_l_. independant of  buildings destroyed, valued at first cost, about 15,000_l_. more. Bance  Island experienced the same fate, and suffered in pecuniary loss upwards of  20,000_l_.    In addition to this calamity, the Sierra Leone Company had to lament the  inefficiency of its superintendants, their want of unanimity, and various  other disasters and unforeseen difficulties which operated to augment the  charge in their establishment, and diminish its funds; and with every  deference to the benevolent undertakers, whose motives merit the highest  approbation of every enlightened mind, I would observe, they have likewise  to regret their misconception of the eligible grounds upon which so  beneficent a plan is to be productive of operative influence; but as at a  future stage of my narrative, I shall be enabled from more minute  investigation to enter at large upon this interesting subject, I shall for  the present dismiss it.    On the 28th of April I embarked on board his Majesty's sloop of war the  Lark, then upon the windward station; having looked into the river for  Governor Day's dispatches, &c.; and I cannot omit this opportunity of  expressing the obligations conferred upon me by Captain Langford, the  commander, and his officers, which invariably continued during my being on  board. At day-light we weighed, and were saluted by one of the forts with  15 guns, which were returned; nothing of moment occurred during our  passage, except being once overtaken with a tornado: this is a hurricane  which prevails upon the windward coast of Africa about this season of the  year, preceding the rainy season; and it is impossible to convey by  description an adequate idea of this explosion of the elements. It  announces its approach by a small white cloud scarcely discernible, which  with incredible velocity overspreads the atmosphere, and envelopes the  affrighted mariner in a vortex of lightning, thunder, torrents of rain, &c.  exhibiting nature in one universal uproar. It is necessary when this cloud  appears at sea, to take in all sail instantaneously, and bear away right  before the furious assailant, which soon expends its awful and tremendous  violence, and nature is again hushed into peaceful tranquillity.    To the southward of Cape Sierra Leone, and in about 8 degrees north  latitude, lie the Islands of Bannana, in a direction from east to west. To  the west of Great Bannana, lie the smaller islands, which are little more  than barren rocks. The soil of the Bannanas is very fertile, and the  climate healthy, from their proximity to the sea, and the refreshing  breezes which  it bestows upon them. They take their name from a fruit so  denominated; and are situated in the most eligible position for commerce,  upon the Windward Coast; combining, from their fertility of soil and  situation, great agricultural advantages, and peculiar salubrity of air. At  present the sovereignty of these islands is contended for by two chiefs, of  considerable intelligence and enterprise, named Caulker and Cleveland.  Caulker appears to be the legitimate sovereign; Cleveland's forefathers  having been established by Caulker's as _trade men_, on their account; and  by intermarriage with that family their claims are founded. James  Cleveland, who married king Caulker's sister, first began the war by his  Grummettas, on the Bannanas, attacking Caulker's people on the Plantains,  The result of this violence was, that Charles Caulker was killed in battle;  and his body mangled and cut into pieces, in the most savage and cruel  manner. In 1798, Stephen Caulker, the present chief, commenced war again,  to revenge his brother's death; and the barbarous contest has continued  ever since, marked with ferocious cruelty, and with various success to the  respective claimants. Soon after its renewal, James Cleveland died, and was  succeeded by his nephew, William, who has received his education in  England, and is a chief of no inconsiderable acquirements and talent.  Stephen Caulker has succeeded in obtaining from him the possession of the  Bannanas and Plantains, and at present sways authority over them; still,  however, exposed to the enterprising genius and intrigues of Cleveland.        [Illustration: THE COLONY of SIERRA LEONE A bearing S.W. by E. distant 3  MILES, and the BANANAS bearing S.W. by W distant 3 leagues. Published Aug 1  1807 by G & W Nicol]        Were it practicable to reconcile these contentions, and procure these  valuable islands, they would form most eligible auxiliaries and depots to  any establishment which Government might form upon this part of the coast,  and be of the utmost importance; or in the event of their being  unattainable, factories might be established at Kittim and Boom, both under  Caulker's influence and protection. I have had frequent intercourse with  this chief, and I found him of a very superior understanding, and acute  intellect, to the generality of his countrymen; and if his jealousies could  be allayed by the emollients of superior advantage, his intelligence and  co-operation would much facilitate any operations in this quarter.    On the 10th of April we arrived at Goree Roads, and came to an anchor  nearly opposite to that part of the island of Goree, called the Point de  Nore, and opening Cape Emanuel, which is by much the most eligible position  in the event of tornados, as a ship may always run in safety to sea,  between the island and the main land.    Goree is a small island, or barren rock, little more than three quarters of  a mile in length, and a few hundred yards in breadth. Its native  inhabitants are of colour, and a spurious progeny from the French; for whom  they still retain a great predilection. The number of what are called  principal inhabitants, does not exceed 50 males, with their families,  dependants, and slaves; which may in the aggregate amount to frequently  between three and four thousand souls. Their principal trade is in slaves,  of whom they annually export about two thousand, with a small proportion of  dead cargo, chiefly procured from Gambia.    Religion, of any description, is little practised or understood among them;  although it is evident that Christianity has been introduced into the  island, as there are traces of a catholic chapel and a monastery remaining.  Custom here, as in all the maritime countries of Africa, is the governing  principle of all their actions, added to an avaricious thirst for gain, and  the indulgence of sensual gratification. The ceremony of marriage is too  offensive for delicacy even to reflect upon, much less for me to narrate:  it does not attach to the union any sacred obligation, the bond being  broken at the moment of caprice in either party, or predilection in favour  of any other object. As a preliminary to this disgusting ceremony, a \"big  dinner,\" in their phraseology, and a few presents to the lady, first  obtaining her and her parents' consent, is all that is requisite. When the  happy pair are united, the dependants and slaves of the parties, and their  respective connexions, who are assembled round the buildings or huts, send  forth a most savage yell of exclamation, accompanied by their barbarous  music, gesticulations, and clapping of the hands, in unison with their song  of triumph. This dance is continued with unabating vociferation during the  night, and perhaps for a week, or greater length of time, bearing, however,  due reference to the rank and consequence of the connubial pair.    The following morning the bride issues forth, with solemn pace and slow, in  grand procession, preceded by her most intimate female associate during her  virgin state, reclining upon her shoulder with both hands; who, in  consequence, is considered as the next matrimonial candidate. They are  immediately surrounded by a concourse of attendants, accompanied by music,  dancing, and other wild expressions of joy; and in a body proceed to visit  her circle of acquaintance and friends, who are always expected to  contribute some"]]]
