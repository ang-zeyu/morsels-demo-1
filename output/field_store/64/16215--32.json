He is the wisest of the Gods in the sense that he remembers  most about the past and foresees most about the future; yet he is  powerless in difficulty without the craft of Loki and the hammer of  Thor. He always wanders in disguise, and the stories told of him are  chiefly love-adventures; this is true of all the deeds he mentions  in _Harbardsljod_, and also of the two interpolations in _Havamal_,  though one of the two had an object, the stealing of the mead of  inspiration from the giant Suptung, whose daughter Gunnloed guarded it.    _Voeluspa_ makes him one of three creative deities, the other two being  Lodur (probably Loki) and Hoeni, of whom nothing else is known except  the story that he was given as hostage to the Vanir in exchange for  Njoerd. The same three Gods (Odin, Loki and Hoeni) are connected with  the legend of the Nibelung treasure; and it was another adventure of  theirs, according to Snorri, which led to the loss of Idunn.    Of the other Gods, Bragi is a later development; his name means  simply king or chief, and his attributes, as God of eloquence and  poetry, are apparently borrowed from Odin. Heimdal, the watchman and  \"far-seeing like the Vanir,\" who keeps guard on the rainbow bridge  Bifroest, is represented in the curious poem _Rigsthula_ as founder of  the different social orders. He wandered over the world under the name  of Rig, and from his first journey sprang the race of thralls, swarthy,  crooked and broad-backed, who busied themselves with fencing land and  tending goats and swine; from his second, the churls, fine and ruddy,  who broke oxen, built houses and ploughed the land; from his third,  the earls, yellow-haired, rosy, and keen-eyed, who broke horses and  strung bows, rode, swam, and hurled spears; and the youngest of the  earls' race was Konung the king, who knew all mysteries, understood  the speech of birds, could quench fire and heal wounds. Heimdal is  said to be the son of nine mothers, and to have fought with Loki for  Freyja's Brising-necklace. His horn is hidden under Yggdrasil, to be  brought out at Ragnaroek, when he will blow a warning blast. His origin  is obscure. Still less is known of Vidar and Vali, two sons of Odin,  one of whom is to avenge Baldr's death, the other to slay the wolf  after it has swallowed up the chief God at Ragnaroek. Thor's stepson  Ullr (Glory) is probably, like his sons Modi and Magni (Wrath and  Strength), a mere epithet.    Frigg, Odin's wife and the chief Goddess, daughter of Earth,  is not very distinctly characterised, and is often confused with  Freyja. Gefion should be the sea-goddess, since that seems to be  the meaning of her name, but her functions are apparently usurped by  the Wane Njoerd; according to Snorri, she is the patron of those who  die unwedded.    _Baldr_.--The story of Baldr is the most debated point in the Edda. The  chief theories advanced are: (1) That it is the oldest part of Norse  mythology, and of ritual origin; (2) that Baldr is really a hero  transformed into a God; (3) that the legend is a solar myth with  or without Christian colouring;  (4) that it is entirely borrowed  from Mediaeval Greek and Christian sources. This last theory is too  ingenious to be credible; and with regard to the third, there is  nothing essentially Christian in the chief features of the legend,  while the solar idea leaves too much unexplained. The references to  the myth in the Elder Edda are:    (1) _Vegtamskvida_ (about 900 A.D.). Odin questions the Sibyl as to  the meaning of Baldr's dreams:    _Odin_. \"For whom are the benches (in hell) strewn with rings, the  halls fairly adorned with gold?\"    _Sibyl_. \"Here the mead, clear drink, stands brewed for Baldr; the  shields are spread. The sons of the Aesir are too merry.\"    _Odin_. \"Who will be Baldr's slayer and rob Odin's son of life?\"    _Sibyl_. \"Hoed bears thither the high branch of fame: he will be  Baldr's slayer and rob Odin's son of life.\"    _Odin_. \"Who will avenge the deed on Hoed and bring Baldr's slayer to  the funeral pyre?\"    _Sibyl_. \"Rind bears a son, Vali, in the halls of the west. He shall  not wash his hands nor comb his hair till he bears Baldr's foe to  the pyre.\"    (2) In _Lokasenna_ Frigg says: \"If I had a son like Baldr here in  Oegi's halls, thou shouldst not pass out from the sons of the Aesir,  but be slain here in thy anger\"; to which Loki replies, \"Wilt thou  that I speak more ill words, Frigg? I am the cause that thou wilt  never more see Baldr ride into the hall.\"    (3) In _Vafthrudnismal_ the only reference is Odin's question,  \"What said Odin in his son's ear when he mounted the pyre?\"    (4) In _Voeluspa_ the Sibyl prophesies, \"I saw doom threatening Baldr,  the bleeding victim, the son of Odin. Grown high above the meadows  stood the mistletoe, slender and fair. From this stem, which looked  so slender, grew a fatal and dangerous shaft. Hoed shot it, and Frigg  wept in Fenhall over Valhall's woe.\"  The following lines, on the  chaining of Loki, suggest his complicity.    (5) _Hyndluljod_ has one reference: \"There were eleven Aesir by  number when Baldr went down into the howe. Vali was his avenger and  slew his brother's slayer.\"    Besides these there is a fragment quoted by Snorri: \"Thoekk will weep  dry tears at Baldr's funeral pyre. I had no good of the old man's  son alive or dead; let Hel keep what she has.\" _Grimnismal_ assigns  a hall to Baldr among the Gods.    There are, in addition, two prose versions of the story by later  writers: the Icelandic version of Snorri (1178-1241) with all the  details familiar to every one; and the Latin one of the Dane Saxo  Grammaticus (about thirty years earlier), which makes Baldr and Hoed  heroes instead of Gods, and completely alters the character of the  legend by making a rivalry for Nanna's favour the centre of the plot  and cause of the catastrophe. On the Eddic version and on Saxo's  depend the theories of Golther, Detter, Niedner and other German  scholars on the one hand, and Dr. Frazer on the other.    It has often been pointed out that there is no trace of Baldr-worship  in other Germanic nations, nor in any of the Icelandic sagas except  the late Frithjofssaga. This, however, is true of other Gods, notably  of Tyr, who is without question one of the oldest. The only deities  named with any suggestion of sacrifice or worship in the Icelandic  sagas proper are Odin, Thor, Frey, Njoerd, Frigg and Freyja. The process  of choice is as arbitrary in mythology as in other sciences. Again,  it is more likely that the original version of the legend should have  survived in Iceland than in Denmark, which, being on the mainland,  was earlier subject to Christian and Romantic influences; and  that a heathen God should, in the two or three centuries following  the establishment of Christianity in the North, be turned into a  mortal hero, than that the reverse process should have acted at a  sufficiently late date to permit of both versions existing side by  side in the thirteenth century. A similar gradual elimination of the  supernatural may be found in the history of the Volsung myth. Snorri's  version is merely an amplification of that in the Elder Edda, which,  scanty as its account of Baldr is, leaves no doubt as to his divinity.    The outline gathered from the poems is as follows: Baldr, Odin's son,  is killed by his brother Hoed through a mistletoe spray; Loki is in some  way concerned in his death, which is an overwhelming misfortune to the  Gods; but it is on Hoed that his death is avenged. He is burnt on a pyre  (Snorri says on his ship, a feature which must come from the Viking  age; _Hyndluljod_ substitutes howe-burial). He will be absent from  the great fight at Ragnaroek, but _Voeluspa_ adds that he will return  afterwards. Nanna has nothing to do with the story. The connexion with  the hierarchy of the Aesir seems external only, since Baldr has no  apparent relation to the great catastrophe as have Odin, Thor, Frej,  Tyr and Loki; this, then, would point to the independence of his myth.    The genuineness of the myth seems to depend on whether the mistletoe  is an original feature of it or not, and on this point there can  be little real doubt. The German theory that Baldr could only be  killed by his own sword, which was therefore disguised by enchantment  and used against him, and that the Icelandic writers misunderstood  this to mean a mistletoe sprig, is far-fetched and romantic, and  crumbles at a touch. For if, as it is claimed, the Icelanders had no  mistletoe, why should they introduce it into a story to which it did  not belong? They might preserve it by tradition, but they would hardly  invent it. Granting this, the mistletoe becomes the central point of  the legend. The older mythologists, who only saw in it a sun-myth,  overlooked the fact that since any weapon would have done to kill  the God with, the mistletoe must have some special significance; and  if it is a genuine part of the story, as we have no reason to doubt,  it will be hard to overturn Dr. Frazer's theory that the Baldr-myth  is a relic of tree-worship and the ritual sacrifice of the God,  Baldr being a tree-spirit whose soul is contained in the mistletoe.    The contradictions in the story, especially as told by Snorri  (such as the confusion between the parts played by Hoed and Loki,  and the unsuspicious attitude of the Gods as Loki directs Hoed's aim)  are sometimes urged against its genuineness. They are rather proofs  of antiquity. Apparent contradictions whose explanation is forgotten  often survive in tradition; the inventor of a new story takes care to  make it consistent. It is probable, however, that there were originally  only two actors in the episode, the victim and the slayer, and that  Loki's part is later than Hoed's, for he really belongs to the Valhall"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13008"],[0,"The Edda, Volume 2 (#3)"],[1," ransom his head by giving  up his wealth. One ring the dwarf tried to keep back, but in vain;  and thereupon he laid a curse upon it: that the ring with the rest  of the gold should be the death of whoever should get possession of  it. In giving the gold to Hreidmar, Odin also tried to keep back the  ring, but had to give it up to cover the last hair. Then Fafni, one of  the two remaining sons, killed his father, first victim of the curse,  for the sake of the gold. He carried it away and lay guarding it in  the shape of a snake. But Regin the smith did not give up his hopes of  possessing the hoard: he adopted as his foster-son Sigurd the Volsung,  thus getting into his power the hero fated to slay the dragon.    The curse thus becomes the centre of the action, and the link between  the two parts of the story, since it directly accounts for Sigurd's  unconscious treachery and his separation from Brynhild, and absolves  the hero from blame by making him a victim of fate. It destroys in turn  Hreidmar, the Dragon, his brother Regin, the dragon-slayer himself,  Brynhild (to whom he gave the ring), and the Giukings, who claimed  inheritance after Sigurd's death. Later writers carried its effects  still further.    This narrative is also told in the pieces of prose interspersed through  _Reginsmal_. The verse consists only of scraps of dialogue. The first  of these comprises question and answer between Loki and the dwarf  Andvari in the form of the old riddle-poems, and seems to result  from the confusion of two ideas: the question-and-answer wager, and  the captive's ransom by treasure. Then follows the curse, in less  general terms than in the prose: \"My gold shall be the death of two  brothers, and cause strife among eight kings; no one shall rejoice in  the possession of my treasure.\" Next comes a short dialogue between  Loki and Hreidmar, in which the former warns his host of the risk he  runs in taking the hoard. In the next fragment Hreidmar calls on his  daughters to avenge him; Lyngheid replies that they cannot do so on  their own brother, and her father bids her bear a daughter whose son  may avenge him. This has given rise to a suggestion that Hjoerdis,  Sigurd's mother, was daughter to Lyngheid, but if that is intended,  it may only be due to the Norse passion for genealogy. The next  fragment brings Regin and Sigurd together, and the smith takes the  young Volsung for his foster-son. A speech of Sigurd's follows, in  which he refuses to seek the treasure till he has avenged his father  on Hunding's sons. The rest of the poem is concerned with the battle  with Hunding's race, and Sigurd's meeting with Odin by the way.    The fight with Fafni is not described in verse, very little of this  poetry being in narrative form; but _Fafnismal_ gives a dialogue  between the wounded dragon and his slayer. Fafni warns the Volsung  against the hoard: \"The ringing gold and the glowing treasure, the  rings shall be thy death.\" Sigurd disregards the warning with the maxim  \"Every man must die some time,\" and asks questions of the dragon in the  manner of _Vafthrudnismal_. Fafni, after repeating his warning, speaks  of his brother's intended treachery: \"Regin betrayed me, he will betray  thee; he will be the death of both of us,\" and dies. Regin returning  bids Sigurd roast Fafni's heart, while he sleeps. A prose-piece tells  that Sigurd burnt his fingers by touching the heart, put them in  his mouth, and understood the speech of birds. The advice given him  by the birds is taken from two different poems, and partly repeats  itself; the substance is a warning to Sigurd against the treachery  plotted by Regin, and a counsel to prevent it by killing him, and so  become sole owner of the hoard. Sigurd takes advantage of the warning:  \"Fate shall not be so strong that Regin shall give my death-sentence:  both brothers shall go quickly hence to Hel.\" Regin's enjoyment of  the hoard is therefore short. The second half of the story begins  when one of the birds, after a reference to Gudrun, guides Sigurd to  the sleeping Valkyrie:    \"Bind up the red rings, Sigurd; it is not kingly to fear. I know a  maid, fairest of all, decked with gold, if thou couldst get her. Green  roads lead to Giuki's, fate guides the wanderer forward. There a  mighty king has a daughter; Sigurd will buy her with a dowry. There  is a hall high on Hindarfell; all without it is swept with fire.... I  know a battle-maid who sleeps on the fell, and the flame plays over  her; Odin touched the maid with a thorn, because she laid low others  than those he wished to fall. Thou shalt see, boy, the helmed maid who  rode Vingskorni from the fight; Sigrdrifa's sleep cannot be broken,  son of heroes, by the Norns' decrees.\"    Sigrdrifa (dispenser of victory) is, of course, Brynhild; the name may  have been originally an epithet of the Valkyrie, and it was probably  such passages as this that misled the author of _Gripisspa_  into  differentiating the Valkyrie and Brynhild. The last lines have been  differently interpreted as a warning to Sigurd not to seek Brynhild and  an attempt to incite him to do so by emphasising the difficulty of the  deed; they may merely mean that her sleep cannot be broken except by  one, namely, the one who knows no fear. Brynhild's supernatural origin  is clearly shown here, and also in the prose in _Sigrdrifumal. Voelsunga  Saga_, though it paraphrases in full the passages relating to the magic  sleep, removes much of the mystery surrounding her by providing her  with a genealogy and family connections; while the _Nibelungen Lied_  goes further still in the same direction by leaving out the magic  sleep. The change is a natural result of Christian ideas, to which  Odin's Wishmaidens would become incomprehensible.    Thus far the story is that of the release of the enchanted princess,  popularly most familiar in the nursery tale of the Sleeping  Beauty. After her broken questions to her deliverer, \"What cut my  mail? How have I broken from sleep? Who has flung from me the dark  spells?\" and his answer, \"Sigmund's son and Sigurd's sword,\" she  bursts into the famous \"Greeting to the World\":    \"Long have I slept, long was I sunk in sleep, long are men's  misfortunes. It was Odin's doing that I could not break the runes of  sleep. Hail, day! hail, sons of day! hail, night! Look on us two with  gracious eyes, and give victory to us who sit here. Hail, Aesir! hail,  Asynjor! hail, Earth, mother of all! give eloquence and wisdom to us  the wonderful pair, and hands of healing while we live.\"    She then becomes Sigurd's guardian and protectress and the source of  his wisdom, as she speaks the runes and counsels which are to help him  in all difficulties; and from this point corresponds to the maiden who  is the hero's benefactress, but whom he deserts through sorcery: the  \"Mastermaid\" of the fairy-tales, the Medeia of Greek myth. Gudrun is  always an innocent instrument in drawing Sigurd away from his real  bride, the actual agent being her witch-mother Grimhild. This part  of the story is summarised in _Gripisspa_, except that the writer  seems unaware that the Wishmaiden who teaches Sigurd \"every mystery  that men would know\" and the princess he betrays are the same:    \"A king's daughter bright in mail sleeps on the fell; thou shalt hew  with thy sharp sword, and cut the mail with Fafni's slayer.... She  will teach thee every mystery that men would know, and to speak in  every man's tongue.... Thou shalt visit Heimi's dwelling and be the  great king's joyous guest.... There is a maid fair to see at Heimi's;  men call her Brynhild, Budli's daughter, but the great king Heimi  fosters the proud maid.... Heimi's fair foster-daughter will rob  thee of all joy; thou shalt sleep no sleep, and judge no cause,  and care for no man unless thou see the maiden.  ... Ye shall swear  all binding oaths but keep few when thou hast been one night Giuki's  guest, thou shalt not remember Heimi's brave foster-daughter.... Thou  shalt suffer treachery from another and pay the price of Grimhild's  plots. The bright-haired lady will offer thee her daughter.\"    _Voelsunga_ gives additional details: Brynhild knows her deliverer  to be Sigurd Sigmundsson and the slayer of Fafni, and they swear  oaths to each other. The description of their second meeting, when  he finds her among her maidens, and she prophesies that he will marry  Giuki's daughter, and also the meeting between her and Gudrun before  the latter's marriage, represent a later development of the story,  inconsistent with the older conception of the Shield-maiden. Sigurd  gives Brynhild the ring Andvaranaut, which belonged to the hoard,  as a pledge, and takes it from her again later when he woos her in  Gunnar's form. It is the sight of the ring afterwards on Gudrun's  hand which reveals to her the deception; but the episode has also  a deeper significance, since it brings her into connection with the  central action by passing the curse on to her. According to Snorri's  paraphrase, Sigurd gives the ring to Brynhild when he goes to her in  Gunnar's form.    For the rest of the story we must depend chiefly on _Gripisspa_ and  _Voelsunga_. The latter tells that Grimhild, the mother of the Giukings,  gave Sigurd a magic drink by which he forgot Brynhild and fell in love  with Giuki's daughter. Gudrun's brothers swore oaths of friendship  with him, and he agreed to ride through the waverlowe, or ring of  fire, disguised and win Brynhild for the eldest brother Gunnar. After  the two bridals, he remembered his first passing through the flame,  and his love for Brynhild returned. The Shield-maiden too remembered,  but thinking that Gunnar had fairly won her, accepted her fate until  Gudrun in spite and jealousy revealed the trick that had been played  on her. Of the treachery of the Giukings Brynhild takes little heed;  but death alone can pay for Sigurd's unconscious betrayal. She tells  Gunnar that"]]]
