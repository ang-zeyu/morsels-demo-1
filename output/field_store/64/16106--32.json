The others cut it open, and, behold I there was the  lost ornament. Benito thanked the King of the Fishes, took the ring,  and brought it to the monarch.    When the great ruler got the ring, he said to the Princess, \"Now that  I have your ring, will you become my wife?\"    \"I will be your wife,\" replied the Princess, \"if you will find the  earring I lost in the forest as I was journeying with Benito.\"    Instantly Benito was called, and was ordered to find the lost jewel. He  was very weary from his former journey; but, mindful of his duty,  he started for the forest, reaching it before the day was over. He  searched for the earring faithfully, following the road which he and  the Princess had taken; but all in vain. He was much discouraged, and  sat down under a tree to rest. To his surprise a mouse of monstrous  size appeared before him. It was the King of the Mice.    \"Why are you so sad?\" asked the Mouse.    \"I am searching for an earring which the Princess lost as we passed  through the forest, but am unable to find it.\"    \"I will find it for you,\" said the King-Mouse.    Benito's face brightened at hearing this. The King-Mouse called all  his followers, and all but one little mouse responded. Then the King  of the Mice ordered some of his subjects to find the absent one. They  found him in a small hole among the bamboo-trees. He said he could not  go because he was so satisfied (sated). So the others pulled him along  to their master; and he, finding that there was something hard within  the little mouse, ordered him to be cut open. It was done; and there  was the very earring for which the tired servant was looking. Benito  took it, thanked the King of the Mice, and brought the earring to  his own King.    When the monarch received it, he immediately restored it to its owner  and asked, \"Will you now become my wife?\"    \"Oh, dear King!\" responded the Princess, \"I have only one more thing  to ask of you; and if you will grant it, I will be your wife forever.\"    The King, pleased with his former successes, said, \"Tell me what it  is, and it shall be granted.\"    \"If you will get some water from heaven,\" said the Princess, \"and  some water from the nether-world, I will become your wife. That is  my last wish.\"    The King called Benito, and commanded him to get water from these two  places. \"I will, my King,\" said Benito; and he took some provisions  and started. He came to the forest; but there he became confused,  for he did not know in which direction to go to reach either of the  places. Suddenly he recalled the promise of the bird he had helped  the first time he entered the wood. He called the bird, and it soon  appeared. He told it what he wanted, and it said, \"I will get it  for you.\"    He made two cups of bamboo, and tied one to each of the bird's  legs. They were very light, and did not hinder the bearer at all. Away  the bird flew, going very fast. Before the day was ended, it came  back with each cup full of water, and told Benito that the one tied  to its right leg contained water from heaven, and the one tied to  its left leg contained water from the nether-world.    Benito untied the cups, taking great care of them. He was about to  leave, when the bird asked him to tarry long enough to bury it, as  the places to which it had been were so far away that it was weary  unto death.    Benito did not like to bury the bird, but he soon saw that it really  was dying, so he waited; and when it was dead, he buried it, feeling  very sorry over the loss of so helpful a friend.    He went back to the palace and delivered the two kinds of water to his  master. The Princess then asked the King to cut her in two and pour  the water from heaven upon her. The King was not willing to do it,  so she did it herself, asking the King to pour the water. This he did,  and, lo! the Princess turned into the most beautiful woman that ever  the sun shone on.    Then the King was desirous of becoming handsome; so he asked  the Princess to pour the other cup of water over him after he cut  himself. He cut himself, and she poured over his body the water from  the nether-world; but from him there arose a spirit more ugly and  ill-favored than imagination could picture. Fortunately, it soon  vanished from sight.    The Princess then turned to Benito, and said, \"You have been faithful  in your duties to your master, kind to me in restoring the jewels I  lost, and brave in delivering me from the cruel giants. You are the  man I choose for my husband.\"    Benito could not refuse so lovely a lady. They were married amid  great festivities, and became the king and queen of that broad and  fertile land.    Benito gave his parents one of the finest portions of his kingdom,  and furnished them with everything they could desire. From that time  on they were all very happy,--so happy that the story of their bliss  has come down through the centuries to us.          PART II    Visayan Folk-Tales.      Introduction.    These stories are intended to bring before the American public a  few of the tales related by Visayan parents to their children, or by  the public story-teller in the market, as the people gather to buy  the material for the evening meal. It was only toward the close of a  three years' stay in the Islands, in one province, and in neighboring  places, and after a fair acquaintance with Spanish and a little  knowledge of the native dialect had enabled us to obtain a closer  insight into the home life of our pupils than would otherwise have  been possible, that we ventured upon the collection of these tales,  hoping that they might prove of interest to people at home. Many of  the stories were written by our boys and girls as part of their work  in English composition. Others were prepared by the native teachers,  some of whom had been well educated by the Spaniards and had already  learned to write very fair English. Indeed, a few were able, at about  the time that these stories were written, to pass the civil service  examination for appointment as insular teachers. The articles on the  superstitious beliefs of the people were prepared by one of these  teachers, so that they might be as nearly correct as possible.    As might be expected, the stories are often very crude and simple,  presenting no difficult situations nor intricate plots. Sometimes  they resemble well-known tales from other lands, although great care  has been taken to collect only those from original sources.    The tales here presented were collected during the spring of 1904, in  the island of Panay, belonging to the Visayan group of the Philippine  Islands, and were obtained in our own class rooms, from native teachers  and pupils. Mr. Maxfield was stationed at Iloilo, and Mr. Millington  at Mandurriao, places five miles apart. We daily came in contact with  about one thousand pupils. The tales were gathered in both places,  and were found to be substantially alike, the differences being  only in petty details. After collecting one version, we endeavored  to ascertain whether the same narrative was current among natives  in other localities of the island. We were surprised to discover  that they seemed to be known wherever we became acquainted with the  people and had obtained their confidence sufficiently to induce them  to talk freely. There were often variations, but the framework was  always the same. If any stories were obtained from native teachers  who knew Spanish, we have always verified them by getting children  or natives from other places, who knew no Spanish, to relate them,  in order to assure ourselves that the narrative could not be a mere  translation of a Spanish tale.    We who have collected these stories can claim little credit for any  more than the mere arrangement of them, as, so far as possible, even  the wording of the original manuscripts has been retained. Doubtless,  much of the interest we have felt in the work is due to our personal  acquaintance with the writers who put on paper for us these simple  tales, yet we hope that they will not be wholly unattractive to those  for whose sake they have been collected.    February, 1906.    B. L. M.    W. H. M.      CHAPTER 1    How Jackyo Became Rich.    A long time ago there was a young man whose name was Jackyo. He was  very poor, and by his daily labor could earn barely enough for his  food and nothing at all for his clothes. He had a little farm at some  distance from the village in which he lived, and on it raised a few  poor crops.    One pleasant afternoon Jackyo started off to visit his farm. It was  late when he reached it, and after he had finished inspecting his  crops, he turned back homewards. But the bright day had gone and the  sun had set. Night came on quickly, and the way was dark and lonely.    At last he could no longer see the road. Not a star was to be seen,  and the only sounds he heard were the sad twitterings of the birds  and soft rustling of the leaves as they were moved by the wind.    At last he entered a thick forest where the trees were very big. \"What  if I should meet some wild beast,\" thought Jackyo; but he added half  aloud, \"I must learn to be brave and face every danger.\"    It was not long before he was very sure that he could hear a deep  roar. His heart beat fast, but he walked steadily forward, and soon  the roar was repeated, this time nearer and more distinctly, and he  saw in the dim light a great wild ox coming towards him.    He found a large hole in the trunk of a huge tree. \"I will pass the  night here in this tree,\" he said to himself.    In a little while an old man appeared. His body was covered with coarse  hair and he was very ugly. He looked fiercely at Jackyo from head to  foot and said: \"What are you thinking of to come in here? Do you not  know that this is the royal castle of the king of evil spirits?\"    Jackyo became"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11029"],[0,"American Hero-Myths: A Study in the Native Religions of the Western Continent (#3)"],[1,"ymy_, that is, the sameness in sound of words with  difference in signification. Thus _coatl_, in the Aztec tongue, is a word  frequently appearing in the names of divinities. It has three entirely  different meanings, to wit, a serpent, a guest and twins. Now, whichever  one of these was originally meant, it would be quite certain to be  misunderstood, more or less, by later generations, and myths would arise  to explain the several possible interpretations of the word--as, in fact,  we find was the case.    Closely allied to this is what has been called _otosis_. This is the  substitution of a familiar word for an archaic or foreign one of similar  sound but wholly diverse meaning. This is a very common occurrence and  easily leads to myth making. For example, there is a cave, near  Chattanooga, which has the Cherokee name Nik-a-jak. This the white  settlers have transformed into Nigger Jack, and are prepared with a  narrative of some runaway slave to explain the cognomen. It may also occur  in the same language. In an Algonkin dialect _missi wabu_ means \"the great  light of the dawn;\" and a common large rabbit was called _missabo_; at  some period the precise meaning of the former words was lost, and a  variety of interesting myths of the daybreak were transferred to a  supposed huge rabbit! Rarely does there occur a more striking example of  how the deteriorations of language affect mythology.    _Aztlan_, the mythical land whence the Aztec speaking tribes were said to  have come, and from which they derived their name, means \"the place of  whiteness;\" but the word was similar to _Aztatlan_, which would mean \"the  place of herons,\" some spot where these birds would love to congregate,  from _aztatl_, the heron, and in after ages, this latter, as the plainer  and more concrete signification, came to prevail, and was adopted by the  myth-makers.    _Polyonomy_ is another procedure often seen in these myths. A divinity has  several or many titles; one or another of these becomes prominent, and at  last obscures in a particular myth or locality the original personality of  the hero of the tale. In America this is most obvious in Peru.    Akin to this is what Prof. Max Mueller has termed _henotheism_. In this  mental process one god or one form of a god is exalted beyond all others,  and even addressed as the one, only, absolute and supreme deity. Such  expressions are not to be construed literally as evidences of a  monotheism, but simply that at that particular time the worshiper's mind  was so filled with the power and majesty of the divinity to whom he  appealed, that he applied to him these superlatives, very much as he would  to a great ruler. The next day he might apply them to another deity,  without any hypocrisy or sense of logical contradiction. Instances of this  are common in the Aztec prayers which have been preserved.    One difficulty encountered in Aryan mythology is extremely rare in  America, and that is, the adoption of foreign names. A proper name without  a definite concrete significance in the tongue of the people who used it  is almost unexampled in the red race. A word without a meaning was  something quite foreign to their mode of thought. One of our most eminent  students[1] has justly said: \"Every Indian synthesis--names of persons and  places not excepted--must preserve the consciousness of its roots, and  must not only have a meaning, but be so framed as to convey that meaning  with precision, to all who speak the language to which it belongs.\" Hence,  the names of their divinities can nearly always be interpreted, though for  the reasons above given the most obvious and current interpretation is not  in every case the correct one.    [Footnote 1: J. Hammond Trumbull, _On the Composition of Indian  Geographical Names_, p. 3 (Hartford, 1870).]    As foreign names were not adopted, so the mythology of one tribe very  rarely influenced that of another. As a rule, all the religions were  tribal or national, and their votaries had no desire to extend them. There  was little of the proselytizing spirit among the red race. Some exceptions  can be pointed out to this statement, in the Aztec and Peruvian  monarchies. Some borrowing seems to have been done either by or from the  Mayas; and the hero-myth of the Iroquois has so many of the lineaments of  that of the Algonkins that it is difficult to believe that it was wholly  independent of it. But, on the whole, the identities often found in  American myths are more justly attributable to a similarity of  surroundings and impressions than to any other cause.    The diversity and intricacy of American mythology have been greatly  fostered by the delight the more developed nations took in rhetorical  figures, in metaphor and simile, and in expressions of amplification and  hyperbole. Those who imagine that there was a poverty of resources in  these languages, or that their concrete form hemmed in the mind from the  study of the abstract, speak without knowledge. One has but to look at the  inexhaustible synonymy of the Aztec, as it is set forth by Olmos or  Sahagun, or at its power to render correctly the refinements of scholastic  theology, to see how wide of the fact is any such opinion. And what is  true of the Aztec, is not less so of the Qquichua and other tongues.    I will give an example, where the English language itself falls short of  the nicety of the Qquichua in handling a metaphysical tenet. _Cay_ in  Qquichua expresses the real being of things, the _essentia_; as, _runap  caynin_, the being of the human race, humanity in the abstract; but to  convey the idea of actual being, the _existentia_ as united to the  _essentia_, we must add the prefix _cascan_, and thus have  _runap-cascan-caynin_, which strictly means \"the essence of being in  general, as existent in humanity.\"[1] I doubt if the dialect of German  metaphysics itself, after all its elaboration, could produce in equal  compass a term for this conception. In Qquichua, moreover, there is  nothing strained and nothing foreign in this example; it is perfectly  pure, and in thorough accord with the genius of the tongue.    [Footnote 1: \"El ser existente de hombre, que es el modo de estar el  primer ser que es la essentia que en Dios y los Angeles y el hombre es  modo personal.\" Diego Gonzalez Holguin, _Vocabvlario de la Lengva Qqichua,  o del Inca; sub voce, Cay_. (Ciudad de los Reyes, 1608.)]    I take some pains to impress this fact, for it is an important one in  estimating the religious ideas of the race. We must not think we have  grounds for skepticism if we occasionally come across some that astonish  us by their subtlety. Such are quite in keeping with the psychology and  languages of the race we are studying.    Yet, throughout America, as in most other parts of the world, the teaching  of religious tenets was twofold, the one popular, the other for the  initiated, an esoteric and an exoteric doctrine. A difference in dialect  was assiduously cultivated, a sort of \"sacred language\" being employed to  conceal while it conveyed the mysteries of faith. Some linguists think  that these dialects are archaic forms of the language, the memory of which  was retained in ceremonial observances; others maintain that they were  simply affectations of expression, and form a sort of slang, based on the  every day language, and current among the initiated. I am inclined to the  latter as the correct opinion, in many cases.    Whichever it was, such a sacred dialect is found in almost all tribes.  There are fragments of it from the cultivated races of Mexico, Yucatan and  Peru; and at the other end of the scale we may instance the Guaymis, of  Darien, naked savages, but whose \"chiefs of the law,\" we are told, taught  \"the doctrines of their religion in a peculiar idiom, invented for the  purpose, and very different from the common language.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Franco, _Noticia de los Indios Guaymies y de sus Costumbres_,  p. 20, in Pinart, _Coleccion de Linguistica y Etnografia Americana_. Tom.  iv.]    This becomes an added difficulty in the analysis of myths, as not only  were the names of the divinities and of localities expressed in terms in  the highest degree metaphorical, but they were at times obscured by an  affected pronunciation, devised to conceal their exact derivation.    The native tribes of this Continent had many myths, and among them there  was one which was so prominent, and recurred with such strangely similar  features in localities widely asunder, that it has for years attracted my  attention, and I have been led to present it as it occurs among several  nations far apart, both geographically and in point of culture. This myth  is that of the national hero, their mythical civilizer and teacher of the  tribe, who, at the same time, was often identified with the supreme deity  and the creator of the world. It is the fundamental myth of a very large  number of American tribes, and on its recognition and interpretation  depends the correct understanding of most of their mythology and religious  life.    The outlines of this legend are to the effect that in some exceedingly  remote time this divinity took an active part in creating the world and in  fitting it to be the abode of man, and may himself have formed or called  forth the race. At any rate, his interest in its advancement was such that  he personally appeared among the ancestors of the nation, and taught them  the useful arts, gave them the maize or other food plants, initiated them  into the mysteries of their religious rites, framed the laws which  governed their social relations, and having thus started them on the road  to self development, he left them, not suffering death, but disappearing  in some way from their view. Hence it was nigh universally expected that  at some time he would return.    The circumstances attending the birth of these hero-gods have great  similarity. As a rule, each is a"]]]
