In a public conveyance, a gentleman should offer his seat to any  lady who is standing, and the lady should thank him audibly for  the courtesy. To turn his back upon her at once, and thus force  her to accept the courtesy in silence or shout her thanks, is  rude. A polite bow exchanged is a sufficient acknowledgment.    Loud talking and laughing in the street are sure signs of  vulgarity.    Never look back after any one passing; it is extremely ill-bred.    Staring is a mark of low breeding.    Whispering in a public conveyance is excessively rude.    Never call out loudly to an acquaintance who may be passing.    \"Cutting\" is to be avoided, if possible. There are other ways of  convincing a man that you will not know him; yet, to young ladies,  it is sometimes the only means available to rid them of a  troublesome acquaintance. Cutting consists in publicly ignoring,  by deed, and, if need be, by word, the acquaintance of the  offensive person. A stiff bow will usually effect the desired  object; if not, a purposed non-recognition will probably succeed.  It must be a very bad case where it is necessary to tell one you  \"have not the pleasure of an acquaintance\" with them. A gentleman  must never under any circumstances, cut a lady; an unmarried lady  may not cut a married one, nor a young man an old one.    George IV., when Prince of Wales, once cut Beau Brummell, with  whom he had quarrelled. The pair met in St. James-street, each  walking with a companion; the companions stopped to speak, but the  Prince did not see Brummell. The latter, to be revenged, and  knowing the horror the Prince had of being considered corpulent,  said to his companion, in a stage whisper, before the others were  out of ear-shot, \"Who is your fat friend?\"    On meeting and passing people in the street, keep to your right  hand, except when giving the upper side of the pavement as before  mentioned.    Let a lady walking with a gentleman have always the upper side of  the pavement, even if he changes sides at every turning.    Young persons, meeting elderly friends in the street, should wait  for a recognition before speaking, and then bow respectfully. To  nod carelessly at an old person is rude, if not actually  insulting.    If you meet two gentlemen in the street, and wish to speak to one  of them, apologize to the other, and make the detention as brief  as possible.    If a gentleman is about to enter or to leave a store, and meets a  lady in the door-way, he must stand aside, raise his hat, and wait  for her to pass. If the door is closed, and she is going the same  way as himself, he must pass before her, bow, saying, \"Permit me,\"  or \"allow me to open the door,\" open it, and hold it open until  she has passed.    A gentleman walking with a lady should endeavor to accommodate his  steps to hers, not force her to stride along or trot with short  steps or his long ones.    Etiquette is too often disregarded in that grand aim of most  ladies' excursions on the street--shopping. True politeness will  lead a lady to pay some attention to the feelings of the clerks  and women in attendance, and they are quick to observe who are  ladylike, and who are not, in their intercourse with them.    Do not enter a store unless you have some errand.    Ask for what you want as explicitly as possible, and do not take  the time of the attendants by examining fifty things that you do  not want.    If you do not intend to purchase goods, but wish to examine them  for future selections, say so.    Never try to cheapen goods. If the price is too high for the  quality offered, or will not suit your purse, look elsewhere for  what will better suit you.    Do not stand hesitating at a counter. Make up your mind quickly,  or leave the store to make your decision, even if you return  again.    Be careful not to injure goods by handling.    Never ask for patterns without apologizing for the trouble, and  not then unless you really intend to return for the goods, as when  you are shopping for a friend, or wish for the judgment or taste  of another person.    Never give unnecessary trouble.    It is best to have all bundles sent home; they are awkward  additions to a walking-dress, and boys are kept for that purpose  in all well-arranged stores.    Never keep a clerk waiting while you chat with a friend. If you  desire to speak with your acquaintances, stand aside, that the  clerk may understand he is released for the time, and free to wait  upon other customers.    Never call away a clerk who is waiting upon some one else. Wait,  if you have business with an especial clerk, until you see that he  is disengaged.    Sneering remarks upon goods is rude in the extreme. If they do not  suit you, you are not obliged to buy them; but spare your  comments.    Lounging over a counter is ill-bred.    Putting your elbows on a counter is rude.    Pushing aside another person is an act of ill-breeding.    You must never take hold of a piece of goods another person is  examining. Wait until it is replaced upon the counter, when you  are at liberty to take it up.    Stage asides or whispering in a store are rude.    It is rude to interrupt friends you may meet in a store, to ask  their attention to your purchases, before they have finished  making their own. It is as rude to offer your opinion, unasked,  upon their judgment or taste in selection of goods.    A gentleman walking with two ladies may offer an arm to each of  them, and they may thus sandwich him if they wish; but under no  circumstances may a lady take the arms of gentlemen at each side  of her.    If a gentleman is walking with two ladies in a rain-storm, and  there is but one umbrella, he should give it to his companions and  walk outside. Nothing can be more absurd than to see a gentleman  walking between two ladies holding an umbrella, which perfectly  protects himself, and sends little streams of water from every  point on the dresses of the ladies he is supposed to be  sheltering.    It is in bad taste to talk of personal matters in the street, or  to call loudly the names of persons you may mention. It is  impossible to say who may be near to you. To discuss friends by  name in a public conveyance of any kind is rude in the extreme.    If you meet a friend with whom you wish to shake hands, never put  out your own until you are quite near, as nothing looks more  awkward than hands extended to grasp each other two or three yards  apart.    Never turn a corner at full speed, or you may find yourself  knocked down or knocking down another by the violent contact.    Never bow from a store to a person on the street, or from the  street to a person in a store.    Never talk politics or religion in a public conveyance.    Never stop to quarrel with a hack-driver. Pay his fare, and  dismiss him; if you have any complaint to make, take his number,  and make it to the proper authorities. To keep a lady standing  while you are disputing with a hack-man is extremely rude.    It is a sign of ill-breeding to change your seat in a car or  omnibus. If you are unfortunate enough to have a neighbor who is  positively annoying and unendurable, it is better to get out and  take the next conveyance than to move to the other side. A  gentleman may move from a crowded side to one left comparatively  vacant; but a lady should not do this.    In a city, or in any lonely place, a lady must avoid being alone  after nightfall, if possible. It exposes her, not only to insult,  but often to positive danger. It is very much the custom in small  country places for two ladies to take evening walks; but it is  better to have the protection of a gentleman if convenient.    It is better for a lady to decline entering a car or an omnibus  that is already full. She must either stand up or force some  polite gentleman to do so. It is better to wait for the next  conveyance.      RIDING AND DRIVING.    THE rule of the road, both in riding and driving, is always to  \"Keep to the right, as the law directs.\"    In inviting a lady to ride, if a gentleman cannot offer the use of  his own horses, or the lady does not name a horse to which she has  been accustomed, he must be careful to select one of proved  gentleness, and trained to the side-saddle and riding-skirt. It is  exceedingly dangerous to allow a lady to mount a horse which may  be entirely strange to a lady's hand or habit; and it is not well  to trust this important matter to a livery-stable keeper or  servant.    A gentleman must be punctual to the appointed time, as it is  disagreeable for a lady to sit waiting in-doors in a riding-habit.  The lady, too, must exercise strict punctuality, that the horses  may not become restive from long standing.    Arrived at the house of his fair companion, the gentleman must  carefully examine the entire furniture of her horse. He must test  the firmness of the saddle and girths, examine well the stirrup  leather, guard against the danger of any buckle allowing a tongue  of leather to slip, see that the curb, bridle, headstall, and  reins are in perfect order; for the entire control of the horse is  lost if one of these breaks or slips. Leaving these matters to the  stable-men entirely is unsafe, as the constant handling of the  harness is apt to make them careless in fastening and testing it.    It is the duty of the gentleman to see the lady comfortably seated  in the saddle before he mounts himself. Having first asked  permission, he leads her to the horse. A groom should not be  allowed to render any assistance, if a gentleman is present,  except ing to hold the horse's head. The lady stands, with her  skirt gathered in her left hand, on the near side of the horse,  her right hand on the pommel of the saddle, and her face turned  towards the horse's head, The gentleman should stand at the  horse's shoulder, facing the lady, and stoop so that her left foot  may rest in his hand. When the lady makes a spring,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8492"],[0,"The King in Yellow (#20)"],[1," week and hunt with hawk and  hound in their company. I also obtained permission to come again from  Kerselec and visit her after my return.    \"Why,\" she said innocently, \"I do not know what I should do if you never  came back;\" and I, knowing that I had no right to awaken her with the  sudden shock which the avowal of my own love would bring to her, sat  silent, hardly daring to breathe.    \"You will come very often?\" she asked.    \"Very often,\" I said.    \"Every day?\"    \"Every day.\"    \"Oh,\" she sighed, \"I am very happy. Come and see my hawks.\"    She rose and took my hand again with a childlike innocence of possession,  and we walked through the garden and fruit trees to a grassy lawn which  was bordered by a brook. Over the lawn were scattered fifteen or twenty  stumps of trees--partially imbedded in the grass--and upon all of these  except two sat falcons. They were attached to the stumps by thongs which  were in turn fastened with steel rivets to their legs just above the  talons. A little stream of pure spring water flowed in a winding course  within easy distance of each perch.    The birds set up a clamour when the girl appeared, but she went from one  to another, caressing some, taking others for an instant upon her wrist,  or stooping to adjust their jesses.    \"Are they not pretty?\" she said. \"See, here is a falcon-gentil. We call  it 'ignoble,' because it takes the quarry in direct chase. This is a blue  falcon. In falconry we call it 'noble' because it rises over the quarry,  and wheeling, drops upon it from above. This white bird is a gerfalcon  from the north. It is also 'noble!' Here is a merlin, and this tiercelet  is a falcon-heroner.\"    I asked her how she had learned the old language of falconry. She did not  remember, but thought her father must have taught it to her when she was  very young.    Then she led me away and showed me the young falcons still in the nest.  \"They are termed _niais_ in falconry,\" she explained. \"A  _branchier_ is the young bird which is just able to leave the nest  and hop from branch to branch. A young bird which has not yet moulted is  called a _sors_, and a _mue_ is a hawk which has moulted in  captivity. When we catch a wild falcon which has changed its plumage we  term it a _hagard_. Raoul first taught me to dress a falcon. Shall I  teach you how it is done?\"    She seated herself on the bank of the stream among the falcons and I  threw myself at her feet to listen.    Then the Demoiselle d'Ys held up one rosy-tipped finger and began very  gravely.    \"First one must catch the falcon.\"    \"I am caught,\" I answered.    She laughed very prettily and told me my _dressage_ would perhaps be  difficult, as I was noble.    \"I am already tamed,\" I replied; \"jessed and belled.\"    She laughed, delighted. \"Oh, my brave falcon; then you will return at my  call?\"    \"I am yours,\" I answered gravely.    She sat silent for a moment. Then the colour heightened in her cheeks and  she held up her finger again, saying, \"Listen; I wish to speak of  falconry--\"    \"I listen, Countess Jeanne d'Ys.\"    But again she fell into the reverie, and her eyes seemed fixed on  something beyond the summer clouds.    \"Philip,\" she said at last.    \"Jeanne,\" I whispered.    \"That is all,--that is what I wished,\" she sighed,--\"Philip and Jeanne.\"    She held her hand toward me and I touched it with my lips.    \"Win me,\" she said, but this time it was the body and soul which spoke in  unison.    After a while she began again: \"Let us speak of falconry.\"    \"Begin,\" I replied; \"we have caught the falcon.\"    Then Jeanne d'Ys took my hand in both of hers and told me how with  infinite patience the young falcon was taught to perch upon the wrist,  how little by little it became used to the belled jesses and the  _chaperon a cornette_.    \"They must first have a good appetite,\" she said; \"then little by little  I reduce their nourishment; which in falconry we call _pat_. When,  after many nights passed _au bloc_ as these birds are now, I prevail  upon the _hagard_ to stay quietly on the wrist, then the bird is  ready to be taught to come for its food. I fix the _pat_ to the end  of a thong, or _leurre_, and teach the bird to come to me as soon as  I begin to whirl the cord in circles about my head. At first I drop the  _pat_ when the falcon comes, and he eats the food on the ground.  After a little he will learn to seize the _leurre_ in motion as I  whirl it around my head or drag it over the ground. After this it is easy  to teach the falcon to strike at game, always remembering to _'faire  courtoisie a l'oiseau'_, that is, to allow the bird to taste the  quarry.\"    A squeal from one of the falcons interrupted her, and she arose to adjust  the _longe_ which had become whipped about the _bloc_, but the  bird still flapped its wings and screamed.    \"What _is_ the matter?\" she said. \"Philip, can you see?\"    I looked around and at first saw nothing to cause the commotion, which  was now heightened by the screams and flapping of all the birds. Then my  eye fell upon the flat rock beside the stream from which the girl had  risen. A grey serpent was moving slowly across the surface of the  boulder, and the eyes in its flat triangular head sparkled like jet.    \"A couleuvre,\" she said quietly.    \"It is harmless, is it not?\" I asked.    She pointed to the black V-shaped figure on the neck.    \"It is certain death,\" she said; \"it is a viper.\"    We watched the reptile moving slowly over the smooth rock to where the  sunlight fell in a broad warm patch.    I started forward to examine it, but she clung to my arm crying, \"Don't,  Philip, I am afraid.\"    \"For me?\"    \"For you, Philip,--I love you.\"    Then I took her in my arms and kissed her on the lips, but all I could  say was: \"Jeanne, Jeanne, Jeanne.\" And as she lay trembling on my breast,  something struck my foot in the grass below, but I did not heed it. Then  again something struck my ankle, and a sharp pain shot through me. I  looked into the sweet face of Jeanne d'Ys and kissed her, and with all my  strength lifted her in my arms and flung her from me. Then bending, I  tore the viper from my ankle and set my heel upon its head. I remember  feeling weak and numb,--I remember falling to the ground. Through my  slowly glazing eyes I saw Jeanne's white face bending close to mine, and  when the light in my eyes went out I still felt her arms about my neck,  and her soft cheek against my drawn lips.      When I opened my eyes, I looked around in terror. Jeanne was gone. I saw  the stream and the flat rock; I saw the crushed viper in the grass beside  me, but the hawks and _blocs_ had disappeared. I sprang to my feet.  The garden, the fruit trees, the drawbridge and the walled court were  gone. I stared stupidly at a heap of crumbling ruins, ivy-covered and  grey, through which great trees had pushed their way. I crept forward,  dragging my numbed foot, and as I moved, a falcon sailed from the  tree-tops among the ruins, and soaring, mounting in narrowing circles,  faded and vanished in the clouds above.    \"Jeanne, Jeanne,\" I cried, but my voice died on my lips, and I fell on my  knees among the weeds. And as God willed it, I, not knowing, had fallen  kneeling before a crumbling shrine carved in stone for our Mother of  Sorrows. I saw the sad face of the Virgin wrought in the cold stone. I  saw the cross and thorns at her feet, and beneath it I read:      \"PRAY FOR THE SOUL OF THE    DEMOISELLE JEANNE D'Ys,    WHO DIED    IN HER YOUTH FOR LOVE OF    PHILIP, A STRANGER.    A.D. 1573.\"    But upon the icy slab lay a woman's glove still warm and fragrant.          THE PROPHETS' PARADISE      \"If but the Vine and Love Abjuring Band    Are in the Prophets' Paradise to stand,    Alack, I doubt the Prophets' Paradise,    Were empty as the hollow of one's hand.\"          THE STUDIO    He smiled, saying, \"Seek her throughout the world.\"    I said, \"Why tell me of the world? My world is here, between these walls  and the sheet of glass above; here among gilded flagons and dull jewelled  arms, tarnished frames and canvasses, black chests and high-backed  chairs, quaintly carved and stained in blue and gold.\"    \"For whom do you wait?\" he said, and I answered, \"When she comes I shall  know her.\"    On my hearth a tongue of flame whispered secrets to the whitening ashes.  In the street below I heard footsteps, a voice, and a song.    \"For whom then do you wait?\" he said, and I answered, \"I shall know her.\"    Footsteps, a voice, and a song in the street below, and I knew the song  but neither the steps nor the voice.    \"Fool!\" he cried, \"the song is the same, the voice and steps have but  changed with years!\"    On the hearth a tongue of flame whispered above the whitening ashes:  \"Wait no more; they have passed, the steps and the voice in the street  below.\"    Then he smiled, saying, \"For whom do you wait? Seek her throughout the  world!\"    I answered, \"My world is here, between these walls and the sheet of glass  above; here among gilded flagons and dull jewelled arms, tarnished frames  and canvasses, black chests and high-backed chairs, quaintly carved and  stained in blue and gold.\"          THE PHANTOM    The Phantom of the Past would go no further.    \"If it is true,\" she sighed, \"that you find in me a friend, let us turn  back together. You will forget, here, under the summer sky.\"    I held her close, pleading, caressing; I seized her, white with anger,  but she resisted.    \"If it is true,\" she sighed, \"that you find in me a friend, let us turn  back together.\"    The Phantom of the Past would go no further.          THE SACRIFICE    I went into a field of flowers, whose petals are whiter than snow and  whose hearts are pure gold.    Far afield a woman cried, \"I have killed him I loved!\" and from a jar she  poured blood upon the flowers whose petals are whiter than snow and whose  hearts are pure gold.    Far afield I followed, and on the jar"]]]
