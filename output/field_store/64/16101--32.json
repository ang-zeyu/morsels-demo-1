An' he waved his hand careless over to the settin' sun.    \"There was somethin' about him that made my heart swell up inside of  me. I looked down into them big brown eyes and wondered--well, I don't  know what I wondered; but I remembered all at once that I didn't have  no son.    \"'Who's your folks?' says I, gettin' more an' more curious.    \"He jest looked at me sort of bored.    \"'Where does your folks live at?' says I.    \"'Oh, they live around here,' says he, an' he waved his hand again,  an' this time over towards the east.    \"Says I: 'When do you figure on reachin' home?'    \"'Oh, most any day,' says he.    \"An' I looked around at them brown, naked hills with the night comin'  down over them. Then I stared back at the boy an' there was something  that come up in me like hunger. You see, he was lost; he was alone;  the queer ring of his whistlin' was still in my ears; an' I couldn't  help rememberin' that I didn't have no son.    \"'Then supposin' you come along with me,' says I, 'an' I'll send you  home in a buckboard tomorrow?'    \"So the end of it was me ridin' home with the little kid sittin' up  before me, whistlin' his heart out! When I got him home I tried to  talk to him again. He couldn't tell me, or he wouldn't tell me where  his folks lived, but jest kept wavin' his hand liberal to half the  points of the compass. An' that's all I know of where he come from. I  done all I could to find his parents. I inquired and sent letters to  every rancher within a hundred miles. I advertised it through the  railroads, but they said nobody'd yet been reported lost. He was still  mine, at least for a while, an' I was terrible glad.    \"I give the kid a spare room. I sat up late that first night listenin'  to the wild geese honkin' away up in the sky an' wonderin' why I was  so happy. Kate, that night there was tears in my eyes when I thought  of how that kid had been out there on the hills walkin' along so happy  an' independent.    \"But the next mornin' he was gone. I sent my cowpunchers out to look  for him.    \"'Which way shall we ride?' they asked.    \"I don't know why, but I thought of the wild geese that Dan had seemed  to be followin'.    \"'Ride north,' I said.    \"An' sure enough, they rode north an' found him. After that I didn't  have no trouble with him about runnin' away--at least not durin' the  summer. An' all those months I kept plannin' how I would take care of  this boy who had come wanderin' to me. It seemed like he was sort of a  gift of God to make up for me havin' no son. And everythin' went well  until the next fall, when the geese began to fly south.    \"Sure enough, that was when Dan ran away again, and when I sent my  cowpunchers south after him, they found him and brought him back. It  seemed as if they'd brought back half the world to me, when I seen  him. But I saw that I'd have to put a stop to this runnin' away. I  tried to talk to him, but all he'd say was that he'd better be movin'  on. I took the law in my hands an' told him he had to be disciplined.  So I started thrashin' him with a quirt, very light. He took it as if  he didn't feel the whip on his shoulders, an' he smiled. But there  came up a yellow light in his eyes that made me feel as if a man was  standin' right behind me with a bare knife in his hand an' smilin'  jest like the kid was doin'. Finally I simply backed out of the room,  an' since that day there ain't been man or beast ever has put a hand  on Whistlin' Dan. To this day I reckon he ain't quite forgiven me.\"    \"Why!\" she cried, \"I have never heard him mention it!\"    \"That's why I know he's not forgotten it. Anyway, Kate, I locked him  in his room, but he wouldn't promise not to run away. Then I got an  inspiration. You was jest a little toddlin' thing then. That day you  was cryin' an awful lot an' I suddenly thought of puttin' you in Dan's  room. I did it. I jest unlocked the door quick and then shoved you in  an' locked it again. First of all you screamed terrible hard. I was  afraid maybe you'd hurt yourself yellin' that way. I was about to take  you out again when all at once I heard Dan start whistlin' and pretty  quick your cryin' stopped. I listened an' wondered. After that I never  had to lock Dan in his room. I was sure he'd stay on account of you.  But now, honey, I'm gettin' to the end of the story, an' I'm goin' to  give you the straight idea the way I see it.    \"I've watched Dan like--like a father, almost. I think he loves me,  sort of--but I've never got over being afraid of him. You see I can't  forget how he smiled when I licked him! But listen to me, Kate, that  fear has been with me all the time--an' it's the only time I've ever  been afraid of any man. It isn't like being scared of a man, but of a  panther.    \"Now we'll jest nacherally add up all the points we've made about  Dan--the queer way I found him without a home an' without wantin'  one--that strength he has that's like the power of a mule compared  with a horse--that funny control he has over wild animals so that they  almost seem to know what he means when he simply looks at them (have  you noticed him with Black Bart and Satan?)--then there's the yellow  light that comes in his eyes when he begins to get real mad--you an' I  have both seen it only once, but we don't want to see it again! More  than this there's the way he handles either a knife or a gun. He  hasn't practiced much with shootin' irons, but I never seen him miss a  reasonable mark--or an unreasonable one either, for that matter. I've  spoke to him about it. He said: 'I dunno how it is. I don't see how  a feller can shoot crooked. It jest seems that when I get out a gun  there's a line drawn from the barrel to the thing I'm shootin' at. All  I have to do is to pull the trigger--almost with my eyes closed!' Now,  Kate, do you begin to see what these here things point to?\"    \"Tell me what you see,\" she said, \"and then I'll tell you what I think  of it all.\"    \"All right,\" he said. \"I see in Dan a man who's different from the  common run of us. I read in a book once that in the ages when men  lived like animals an' had no weapons except sticks and stones, their  muscles must have been two or three times as strong as they are  now--more like the muscles of brutes. An' their hearin' an' their  sight an' their quickness an' their endurance was about three times  more than that of ordinary men. Kate, I think that Dan is one of those  men the book described! He knows animals because he has all the powers  that they have. An' I know from the way his eyes go yellow that he has  the fightin' instinct of the ancestors of man. So far I've kept him  away from other men. Which I may say is the main reason I bought Dan  Morgan's place so's to keep fightin' men away from our Whistlin' Dan.  So I've been hidin' him from himself. You see, he's my boy if he  belongs to anybody. Maybe when time goes on he'll get tame. But I  reckon not. It's like takin' a panther cub--or a wolf pup--an tryin'  to raise it for a pet. Some day it gets the taste of blood, maybe its  own blood, an' then it goes mad and becomes a killer. An' that's what  I fear, Kate. So far I've kept Dan from ever havin' a single fight,  but I reckon the day'll come when someone'll cross him, and then  there'll be a tornado turned loose that'll jest about wreck these  parts.\"    Her anger had grown during this speech. Now she rose.    \"I won't believe you, Dad,\" she said. \"I'd sooner trust our Dan than  any man alive. I don't think you're right in a single word!\"    \"I was sure loco,\" sighed Cumberland, \"to ever dream of convincin' a  woman. Let it drop, Kate. We're about to get rid of Morgan's place,  an' now I reckon there won't be any temptation near Dan. We'll see  what time'll do for him. Let the thing drop there. Now I'm goin' over  to the Bar XO outfit an' I won't be back till late tonight. There's  only one thing more. I told Morgan there wasn't to be any gun-play in  his place today. If you hear any shootin' go down there an' remind  Morgan to take the guns off'n the men.\"    Kate nodded, but her stare travelled far away, and the thing she saw  was the yellow light burning in the eyes of Whistling Dan.          CHAPTER III      SILENT SHOOTS    It was a great day and also a sad one for Morgan. His general store  and saloon had been bought out by old Joe Cumberland, who declared  a determination to clear up the landscape, and thereby plunged the  cowpunchers in gloom. They partially forgave Cumberland, but only  because he was an old man. A younger reformer would have met armed  resistance. Morgan's place was miles away from the next oasis in the  desert and the closing meant dusty, thirsty leagues of added journey  to every man in the neighbourhood. The word \"neighbourhood,\" of  course, covered a territory fifty miles square.    If the day was very sad for this important reason, it was also very  glad, for rustling Morgan advertised the day of closing far and wide,  and his most casual patrons dropped all business to attend the big  doings. A long line of buckboards and cattle ponies surrounded the  place. Newcomers gallopped in every few moments. Most of them did not  stop to tether their mounts, but simply dropped the reins over the  heads of the horses and then went with rattling spurs and slouching  steps into the saloon. Every man was greeted by a shout, for one or  two of those within usually knew him, and when they raised a cry  the others joined in for the sake of good fellowship. As a rule he  responded by ordering everyone up to the bar.    One man, however, received no more greeting than the slamming of the  door behind him. He was a tall, handsome fellow with tawny hair and a  little smile of habit rather than mirth upon his lips. He had ridden  up on a strong bay horse, a full two hands taller than the average  cattle pony, and with legs"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10890"],[0,"Dio's Rome, Volume 5 (#3)"],[1,"though he censured  the extravagances of others, he kept five hundred three-legged tables of  cedar wood, every one of them with identical ivory feet, and he gave  banquets on them. In mentioning these details I have at least given a hint  of their inevitable adjuncts,--the licentiousness in which he indulged at  the very time that he made a most brilliant marriage, and the delight that  he took in boys past their prime (a practice which he also taught Nero to  follow). Nevertheless, his austerity of life had earlier been so severe  that he had asked his pupil neither to kiss him nor to eat at the same  table with him. [For the latter request he had a good reason, namely, that  Nero's absence would enable him to conduct his philosophical studies at  leisure without being hindered by the young man's dinners. But as for the  kiss, I can not conceive how that tradition came about. The only  explanation which one could imagine, namely, his unwillingness to kiss  that sort of mouth, is proved to be false by the facts concerning his  favorites. For this and for his adultery some complaints were lodged  against him, but at this time he was himself released without formal  accusations and succeeded in begging off Pallas and Burrus. Later on he  did not come out so well.]    [Sidenote: A.D. 59 (a.u. 811)] [Sidenote:--11--] There was a certain  Marcus Salvius Otho, who through similarity of character and sharing in  wrongdoing had become so intimate with Nero that he was not even punished  for saying one day to the latter: \"Then I hope you may see me Caesar.\" All  that came of it was the response: \"I sha'n't see you even consul.\" It was  to him that the emperor gave Sabina, of patrician family, after separating  her from her husband, and they both enjoyed her together. Agrippina,  therefore, fearing that Nero would marry the woman (for he was now  beginning to entertain a mad passion for her), ventured upon a most unholy  course. As if it were not enough for her story that she had attracted her  uncle Claudius into love for her by her blandishments and uncontrolled  looks and kisses, she undertook to enslave Nero also in similar fashion.  However, I am not sure whether this actually occurred, or whether it was  invented to fit their characters: but I state here what is admitted by  all, that Nero had a mistress resembling Agrippina of whom he was  especially fond because of this very resemblance. And when he toyed with  the girl herself or threw out hints about it to others, he would say that  he was having intercourse with his mother.    [Sidenote: A.D. 59 (a.u. 812)] Sabina on hearing about this began to  persuade Nero to get rid of his mother in order to forestall her alleged  plots against him. He was likewise incited,--so many trustworthy men have  stated,--by Seneca, whether it was to obscure the complaint against his  own name that the latter was anxious or to lead Nero on to a career of  unholy bloodguiltiness that should bring about most speedily his  destruction by gods and men. But they shrank from doing the deed openly  and were not able to put her out of the way secretly by means of poison,  for she took extreme precautions against all such things. One day they saw  in the theatre a ship that automatically separated in two, let out some  beasts, and came together again so as to be once more seaworthy; and they  at once had another one built like it. By the time the ship was finished  Agrippina had been quite won over by Nero's attentions, for he exhibited  devotion to her in every way to make sure that she should suspect nothing  and be off her guard. He dared, however, do nothing in Rome for fear the  crime should become widely known. Hence he went some distance into  Campania accompanied by his mother, and took a sail on the fatal ship  itself, which was adorned in the most brilliant fashion to the end that  she might feel a desire to use the vessel continually.    [Sidenote:--13--] When they reached Bauli, he gave for several days most  costly dinners at which he showed great solicitude in entertaining his  mother. If she were absent he feigned to miss her sorely, and if she were  present he was lavish of caresses. He bade her ask whatever she desired  and bestowed many gifts without her asking. When he had shaped the  situation to this extent [Footnote: Adopting Reiske's conjecture,  _nv_.], then rising from dinner about midnight he embraced her, and  straining her to his breast kissed her eyes and hands, exclaiming:  \"Mother, farewell, and happiness attend you! For you I live and because of  you I rule.\" He then gave her in charge of Anicetus, a freedman,  supposedly to convey her home on the ship that he had prepared.    But the sea would not endure the tragedy about to be enacted on it nor  would it submit to assume responsibility for the deception wrought by the  monstrous contrivance: therefore, though the ship parted asunder and  Agrippina fell into the water, she did not perish. In spite of the fact  that it was dark and she was full of strong drink and that the sailors  used their oar blades on her, so much so that they killed Acerronia Polla,  her fellow voyager, she nevertheless saved her life and reached home.  Thereupon she affected not to realize that it was a plot and let not a  word of it be known, but sent speedily to her son an account of the  occurrence with the implication that it had happened by accident, and  conveyed to him the good news (as she assumed it to be) that she was safe.  Nero hearing this could not endure the unexpected outcome but punished the  messenger as savagely as if he had come to assassinate him, and at once  despatched Anicetus with the sailors to make an end of his mother. He  would not entrust the killing of her to the Pretorians. When she saw them,  she knew for what they had come, and leaping from her bed tore open her  clothing; exposing her abdomen, and cried out: \"Strike here, Anicetus,  strike here, for this bore Nero!\"    [Sidenote:--14--] Thus was Agrippina, daughter of Germanicus, grandchild of  Agrippa, descendant of Augustus, slain by the very son to whom she had  given the sovereignty and for whose sake she had killed her uncle and  others. Nero when informed that she was dead would not believe it, for the  monstrousness of his bold deed plunged him in doubts; therefore he desired  to behold the victim with his own eyes. So he laid bare her body, looked  her all over and inspected her wounds, finally uttering a remark far more  abominable even than the crime. What he said was: \"I did not know I had so  beautiful a mother.\"    To the Pretorians he gave money evidently to secure their prayers for many  such occurrences, and he sent to the senate a message in which he  enumerated the offences of which he knew she was guilty, stating also that  she had plotted against him and on being detected had committed suicide.  Yet for all this calm explanation to the governing body he was frequently  subject to agitation at night, so that he would even leap suddenly from  his bed. And by day terror seized him at the sound of trumpets that seemed  to blare forth some horrid din of war from the spot where lay Agrippina's  bones. Therefore he went elsewhere. And when in his new abode he had again  the same experience, he distractedly transferred his residence to some  other place.    Nero, not having a word of truth from any one and seeing that all approved  what he had been doing, thought that either his actions had escaped notice  or that he had conducted himself correctly. Hence he became much worse  also in other respects. He came to think that all that it was in his power  to do was right and gave heed to those whose speech was prompted by fear  or flattery as if they told absolute truth. For a time he was subject to  fears and questionings, but, after the ambassadors had made him a number  of pleasing speeches, he regained courage.    [Sidenote:--15--] The population of Rome, on hearing the report, though  horrified were nevertheless joyful, because they thought that now he would  surely come to ruin. Nearly all of the senators pretended to rejoice at  what had taken place, participated in Nero's pleasure, and voted many  measures of which they thought he would be glad. Publius Thrasea Paetus  had also come to the senate-house and listened to the letter. When,  however, the reading was done, he at once rose without making any comment  and went out. Thus what he would have said he could not, and what he could  have said he would not. He behaved in the same way under all other  conditions. For he used to say: \"If it were a matter of Nero's putting  only me to death, I could easily pardon the rest who load him with  flatteries. But since among those even who praise him so excessively he  has gotten rid of some and will yet destroy others, why should one stoop  to indecent behavior and perish like a slave, when like a freeman one may  pay the debt to nature? There shall be talk of me hereafter, but of these  men not a word save for the single fact that they were killed.\" Such was  the kind of man Thrasea showed himself, and he would always encourage  himself by saying: \"Nero can kill me, but he can not harm me.\"    [Sidenote:--16--] When Nero after his mother's murder reentered Rome,  people paid him reverence in public, but in private so long as any one  could speak frankly with safety they tore his character to very tatters.  And first they hung by night a piece of hide on one of his statues to  signify that he himself ought to have a hiding. Second, they threw down in  the Forum a baby to which was fastened a board, saying: \"I will not take  you up for fear you may slay your mother.\"    At Nero's entrance into Rome they took down the statues of Agrippina. But  there was one which they did not cut loose soon enough, and so they threw  over it a cloth which gave it the appearance of being veiled. Thereupon  somebody at once affixed to the statue the"]]]
