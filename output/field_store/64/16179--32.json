It was rated eight and one-half horse-power; but, as every one  knows, American machines are overrated as a rule, while foreign  machines are greatly underrated. A twelve horse-power American  machine may mean not more than eight or ten; a twelve horse-power  French machine, with its four cylinders, means not less than  sixteen.    The foreign manufacturer appreciates the advantage of having it  said that his eight horse-power machine will run faster and climb  better than the eight horsepower machine of a rival maker; hence  the tendency to increase the power without changing the nominal  rating. The American manufacturer caters to the demand of his  customers for machines of high power by advancing the nominal  rating quite beyond the power actually developed.    But already things are changing here, and makers show a  disposition to rate their machines low, for the sake of  astonishing in performance. A man dislikes to admit his machine is  rated at forty horse-power and to acknowledge defeat by a machine  rated at twenty, when the truth is that each machine is probably  about thirty.    The tendency at the present moment is decidedly towards the French  type,--two or four cylinders placed in front.    In the construction of racing-cars and high-speed machines for  such roads as they have on the other side, we have much to learn  from the French,--and we have been slow in learning it. The  conceit of the American mechanic amounts often to blind  stubbornness, but the ease with which the foreign machines have  passed the American in all races on smooth roads has opened the  eyes of our builders; the danger just now is that they will go to  the other extreme and copy too blindly.    In the hands of experts, the foreign racing-cars are the most  perfect road locomotives yet devised; for touring over American  roads in the hands of the amateur they are worse than useless; and  even experts have great difficulty in running week in and week out  without serious breaks and delays. To use a slang phrase, \"They  will not stand the racket.\" However \"stunning\" they look on  asphalt and macadam with their low, rakish bodies, resplendent in  red and polished brass, on country roads they are very frequently  failures. A thirty horse-power foreign machine costing ten or  twelve thousand dollars, accompanied by one or more expert  mechanics, may make a brilliant showing for a week or so; but when  the time is up, the ordinary, cheap, country-looking, American  automobile will be found a close second at the finish; not that it  is a finer piece of machinery, for it is not; but it has been  developed under the adverse conditions prevailing in this country  and is built to surmount them. The maker in this country who runs  his machine one hundred miles from his factory, would find fewer  difficulties between Paris and Berlin.    The temptation is great to purchase a foreign machine on sight;  resist the temptation until you have ridden in it over a hundred  miles of sandy, clayey, and hilly American roads; you may then  defer the purchase indefinitely, unless you expect to carry along  a man.    Machine for machine, regardless of price, the comparison is  debatable; but price for price, there is no comparison whatsoever;  in fact, there is no inexpensive imported machine which compares  for a moment with the American product.    A single-cylinder motor possesses a few great advantages to  compensate for many disadvantages; it has fewer parts to get out  of order, and troubles can be much more quickly located and  overcome. Two, three, and four cylinders run with less vibration  and are better in every way, except that with every cylinder added  the chances of troubles are multiplied, and the difficulty of  locating them increased. Each cylinder must have its own  lubrication, its ignition, intake, and exhaust mechanisms,--the  quartette that is responsible for nine-tenths of the stops.    Beyond eight or ten horse-power the single cylinder is hardly  practicable. The kick from the explosion is too violent, the  vibration and strain too great, and power is lost in transmission.  But up to eight or ten horse-power the single-cylinder motor with  a heavy fly-wheel is practicable, runs very smoothly at high  speeds, mounts hills and ploughs mud quite successfully. The  American ten horse-power single-cylinder motor will go faster and  farther on our roads than most foreign double-cylinder machines of  the same horse-power. It will last longer and require less  repairs.    The amateur who is not a pretty good mechanic and who wishes to  tour without the assistance of an expert will do well to use the  single-cylinder motor; he will have trouble enough with that  without seeking further complications by the adoption of multiple  cylinders.    It is quite practicable to attain speeds of from twenty to thirty  miles per hour with a single-cylinder motor, but for bad roads and  hilly countries a low gear with a maximum of twenty to twenty-five  miles per hour is better. The average for the day will be higher  because better speed is maintained through heavy roads and on up  grades.    So far as resiliency is concerned, there is no comparison between  the French double-tube tire and the heavy American single tube,  --the former is far ahead, and is, of course, easily repaired on the  road, but it does not seem to stand the severe wear of American  roads, and it is very easily punctured. Our highways both in and  out of cities are filled with things that cut, and bristle with  wire-nails. The heavy American single-tube tire holds out quite  well; it gets many deep cuts and takes nails like a pin-cushion,  but comparatively few go through. The weight of the tire makes it  rather hard riding, very hard, indeed, as compared with a fine  Michelin.    There are many devices for carrying luggage, but for getting a  good deal into a small compass there is nothing equal to a big  Scotch hold-all. It is waterproof to begin with, and holds more  than a small steamer-trunk. It can be strapped in or under the  machine anywhere. Trunks and hat-boxes may remain with the express  companies, always within a few hours' call.    What to wear is something of a problem. In late autumn and winter  fur is absolutely essential to comfort. Even at fifteen or twenty  miles an hour the wind is penetrating and goes through everything  but the closest of fur. For women, fur or leather-lined coats are  comfortable even when the weather seems still quite warm.    Leather coats are a great protection against both cold and dust.  Unhappily, most people who have no machines of their own, when  invited to ride, have nothing fit to wear; they dress too thinly,  wear hats that blow off, and they altogether are, and look, quite  unhappy--to the great discomfort of those with them. It is not a  bad plan to have available one or two good warm coats for the  benefit of guests, and always carry water-proof coats and  lap-covers. In emergency, thin black oil-cloth, purchasable at  any country store, makes a good water-proof covering.    Whoever is running a machine must be prepared for  emergencies,  for at any moment it may be necessary to get underneath.    The man who is going to master his own machine must expect to get  dirty; dust, oil, and grime plentifully distributed,--but dirt is  picturesque, even if objectionable. Character is expressed in  dirt; the bright and shining school-boy face is devoid of  interest, an artificial product, quite unnatural; the smutty  street urchin is an actor on life's stage, every daub, spot, and  line an essential part of his make-up.    The spic and span may go well with a coach and four, but not with  the automobile. Imagine an engineer driving his locomotive in blue  coat, yellow waistcoat, and ruffles,--quite as appropriate as a  fastidious dress on the automobile.    People are not yet quite accustomed to the grime of automobiling;  they tolerate the dust of the golf links, the dirt of base-ball  and cricket, the mud of foot-ball, and would ridicule the man who  failed to dress appropriately for those games, but the mechanic's  blouse or leather coat of automobiling, the gloves saturated with  oil--these are comparatively unfamiliar sights; hence men are seen  starting off for a hard run in ducks and serges, sacks, cutaways,  even frocks, and hats of all styles; give a farmer a silk hat and  patent leather boots to wear while threshing, and he would match  them.    Every sport has its own appropriate costume, and the costume is  not the result of arbitrary choice, but of natural selection; if  we hunt, fish, or play any outdoor game, sooner or later we find  ourselves dressing like our associates. The tenderfoot may put on  his cowboy's suit a little too soon and look and be very  uncomfortable, but the costume is essential to success in the long  run.    The Russian cap so commonly seen is an affectation,--it catches  the wind and is far from comfortable. The best head covering is a  closely fitting Scotch cap.          CHAPTER THREE  THE START  \"IS THIS ROAD TO--\"    The trip was not premeditated--it was not of malice aforethought;  it was the outcome of an idle suggestion made one hot summer  afternoon, and decided upon in the moment. Within the same  half-hour a telegram was sent the Professor inviting him for a ride  to Buffalo. Beyond that point there was no thought,--merely a  nebulous notion that might take form if everything went well.    Hampered by no announcements, with no record to make or break, the  trip was for pleasure,--a mid-summer jaunt. We did intend to make  the run to Buffalo as fast as roads would permit,--but for  exhilaration only, and not with any thought of making a record  that would stand against record-making machines, driven by  record-breaking men.

Next day another crowd was seen  In the dark weather's sleety spleen.  Bald-headed to the storm came out  A man, who, 'mid a joyous shout,  Silently posted this brief sheet:    GLORIOUS VICTORY OF THE FLEET!    FRIDAY'S GREAT EVENT!    THE ENEMY'S WATER-BATTERIES BEAT!    WE SILENCED EVERY GUN!    THE OLD COMMODORE'S COMPLIMENTS SENT  PLUMP INTO DONELSON!    \"Well, well, go on!\" exclaimed the crowd  To him who thus much read aloud.  \"That's all,\" he said. \"What! nothing more\"  \"Enough for a cheer, though--hip, hurrah!\"  \"But here's old Baldy come again--\"  \"More news!\"--And now a different strain.    (Our own reporter a dispatch compiles,    As best he may, from varied sources.)    Large re-enforcements have arrived--    Munitions, men, and horses--  For Grant, and all debarked, with stores.      The enemy's field-works extend six miles--  The gate still hid; so well contrived.    Yesterday stung us; frozen shores    Snow-clad, and through the drear defiles    And over the desolate ridges blew  A Lapland wind.                 The main affair    Was a good two hours' steady fight  Between our gun-boats and the Fort.    The Louisville's wheel was smashed outright.  A hundred-and-twenty-eight-pound ball  Came planet-like through a starboard port,  Killing three men, and wounding all  The rest of that gun's crew,  (The captain of the gun was cut in two);  Then splintering and ripping went--  Nothing could be its continent.    In the narrow stream the Louisville,  Unhelmed, grew lawless; swung around,    And would have thumped and drifted, till  All the fleet was driven aground,  But for the timely order to retire.    Some damage from our fire, 'tis thought,  Was done the water-batteries of the Fort.    Little else took place that day,    Except the field artillery in line  Would now and then--for love, they say--      Exchange a valentine.  The old sharpshooting going on.  Some plan afoot as yet unknown;  So Friday closed round Donelson.    LATER.        Great suffering through the night--  A stinging one. Our heedless boys    Were nipped like blossoms. Some dozen    Hapless wounded men were frozen.  During day being struck down out of sight,  And help-cries drowned in roaring noise,  They were left just where the skirmish shifted--  Left in dense underbrush now-drifted.  Some, seeking to crawl in crippled plight,  So stiffened--perished.                          Yet in spite  Of pangs for these, no heart is lost.  Hungry, and clothing stiff with frost,  Our men declare a nearing sun  Shall see the fall of Donelson.    And this they say, yet not disown  The dark redoubts round Donelson,    And ice-glazed corpses, each a stone--      A sacrifice to Donelson;  They swear it, and swerve not, gazing on  A flag, deemed black, flying from Donelson.  Some of the wounded in the wood    Were cared for by the foe last night,  Though he could do them little needed good,    Himself being all in shivering plight.  The rebel is wrong, but human yet;  He's got a heart, and thrusts a bayonet.  He gives us battle with wondrous will--  The bluff's a perverted Bunker Hill._    The stillness stealing through the throng  The silent thought and dismal fear revealed;          They turned and went,      Musing on right and wrong      And mysteries dimly sealed--  Breasting the storm in daring discontent;  The storm, whose black flag showed in heaven,  As if to say no quarter there was given      To wounded men in wood,    Or true hearts yearning for the good--  All fatherless seemed the human soul.  But next day brought a bitterer bowl--    On the bulletin-board this stood;      _Saturday morning at 3 A.M.      A stir within the Fort betrayed    That the rebels were getting under arms;      Some plot these early birds had laid.    But a lancing sleet cut him who stared    Into the storm. After some vague alarms,    Which left our lads unscared,    Out sallied the enemy at dim of dawn,      With cavalry and artillery, and went      In fury at our environment.    Under cover of shot and shell      Three columns of infantry rolled on,      Vomited out of Donelson--    Rolled down the slopes like rivers of hell,      Surged at our line, and swelled and poured    Like breaking surf. But unsubmerged      Our men stood up, except where roared    The enemy through one gap. We urged    Our all of manhood to the stress,    But still showed shattered in our desperateness.        Back set the tide,    But soon afresh rolled in;      And so it swayed from side to side--    Far batteries joining in the din,    Though sharing in another fray--      Till all became an Indian fight,    Intricate, dusky, stretching far away,    Yet not without spontaneous plan      However tangled showed the plight;    Duels all over 'tween man and man,    Duels on cliff-side, and down in ravine,      Duels at long range, and bone to bone;    Duels every where flitting and half unseen.      Only by courage good as their own,    And strength outlasting theirs,      Did our boys at last drive the rebels off.    Yet they went not back to their distant lairs      In strong-hold, but loud in scoff    Maintained themselves on conquered ground--    Uplands; built works, or stalked around.    Our right wing bore this onset. Noon    Brought calm to Donelson.    The reader ceased; the storm beat hard;    'Twas day, but the office-gas was lit;    Nature retained her sulking-fit,        In her hand the shard.  Flitting faces took the hue  Of that washed bulletin-board in view,  And seemed to bear the public grief  As private, and uncertain of relief;  Yea, many an earnest heart was won,    As broodingly he plodded on,  To find in himself some bitter thing,  Some hardness in his lot as harrowing        As Donelson.    That night the board stood barren there,    Oft eyes by wistful people passing,    Who nothing saw but the rain-beads chasing  Each other down the wafered square,  As down some storm-beat grave-yard stone.  But next day showed--                         MORE NEWS LAST NIGHT.      STORY OF SATURDAY AFTERNOON.    VICISSITUDES OF THE WAR.      _The damaged gun-boats can't wage fight  For days; so says the Commodore.  Thus no diversion can be had.  Under a sunless sky of lead    Our grim-faced boys in blacked plight  Gaze toward the ground they held before,  And then on Grant. He marks their mood,  And hails it, and will turn the same to good.  Spite all that they have undergone,  Their desperate hearts are set upon  This winter fort, this stubborn fort,  This castle of the last resort,        This Donelson.    1 P.M.              An order given    Requires withdrawal from the front    Of regiments that bore the brunt  Of morning's fray. Their ranks all riven  Are being replaced by fresh, strong men.  Great vigilance in the foeman's Den;  He snuffs the stormers. Need it is  That for that fell assault of his,  That rout inflicted, and self-scorn--  Immoderate in noble natures, torn  By sense of being through slackness overborne--  The rebel be given a quick return:  The kindest face looks now half stern.  Balked of their prey in airs that freeze,  Some fierce ones glare like savages.  And yet, and yet, strange moments are--  Well--blood, and tears, and anguished War!  The morning's battle-ground is seen    In lifted glades, like meadows rare;    The blood-drops on the snow-crust there  Like clover in the white-week show--    Flushed fields of death, that call again--    Call to our men, and not in vain,  For that way must the stormers go.    3 P.M.              The work begins.  Light drifts of men thrown forward, fade    In skirmish-line along the slope,  Where some dislodgments must be made    Ere the stormer with the strong-hold cope.    Lew Wallace, moving to retake  The heights late lost--                         (Herewith a break.    Storms at the West derange the wires.  Doubtless, ere morning, we shall hear  The end; we look for news to cheer--    Let Hope fan all her fires.)_      Next day in large bold hand was seen  The closing bulletin:    VICTORY!          _Our troops have retrieved the day  By one grand surge along the line;  The spirit that urged them was divine.    The first works flooded, naught could stay  The stormers: on! still on!  Bayonets for Donelson!    Over the ground that morning lost  Rolled the blue billows, tempest-tossed,    Following a hat on the point of a sword.  Spite shell and round-shot, grape and canister,  Up they climbed without rail or banister--    Up the steep hill-sides long and broad,  Driving the rebel deep within his works.  'Tis nightfall; not an enemy lurks    In sight. The chafing men        Fret for more fight:    \"To-night, to-night let us take the Den\"  But night is treacherous, Grant is wary;  Of brave blood be a little chary.  Patience! the Fort is good as won;  To-morrow, and into Donelson._    LATER AND LAST.                    THE FORT IS OURS.      _A flag came out at early morn  Bringing surrender. From their towers    Floats out the banner late their scorn.  In Dover, hut and house are full    Of rebels dead or dying.    The national flag is flying  From the crammed court-house pinnacle.  Great boat-loads of our wounded go  To-day to Nashville. The sleet-winds blow;  But all is right: the fight is won,  The winter-fight for Donelson.        Hurrah!  The spell of old defeat is broke,    The Habit of victory begun;  Grant strikes the war's first sounding stroke        At Donelson.    For lists of killed and wounded, see  The morrow's dispatch: to-day 'tis victory._    The man who read this to the crowd    Shouted as the end he gained;    And though the unflagging tempest rained,      They answered him aloud.  And hand grasped hand, and glances met  In happy triumph; eyes grew wet.  O, to the punches brewed that night  Went little water. Windows bright  Beamed rosy on the sleet without,  And from the deep street came the frequent shout;  While some in prayer, as these in glee,"]]]
