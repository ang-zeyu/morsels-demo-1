Second, that it is the duty of the United States to demand, and  the government of the United States does hereby demand, that the  government of Spain at once relinquish its authority and government in  the island of Cuba, and withdraw its land and naval forces from Cuba  and Cuban waters.    Third, that the President of the United States be, and he hereby is,  directed and empowered to use the entire land and naval forces of  the United States, and to call into the actual service of the United  States the militia of the several states to such extent as may be  necessary to carry these resolutions into effect.    Fourth, that the United States hereby disclaims any disposition or  intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or control over  said island, except for the pacification thereof, and asserts its  determination when that is completed to leave the government and  control of the island to its people.    THE PRESIDENT SIGNED THIS RESOLUTION at 11:24 A.M. on the 20th of  April, 1898. The Spanish Minister, Senor Luis Polo y Bernarbe, was  served with a copy, upon which he asked for his passports, and  \"immediately left Washington.\"    \"This is a picture of Edward Savoy, who accomplished one of the most  signal diplomatic triumphs in connection with recent relations  with Spain. It was he who outwitted the whole Spanish Legation and  delivered the ultimatum to Minister Polo.\"    \"Edward Savoy has been a messenger in the Department of State for  nearly thirty years. He was appointed by Hamilton Fish in 1869, and  held in high esteem by James G. Blaine.\"      \"He was a short, squat, colored man, with a highly intelligent face,  hair slightly tinged with gray and an air of alertness which makes him  stand out in sharp contrast with the other messengers whom one meets  in the halls of the big building.\"    [Illustration: EDDIE SAVOY.]    \"Of all the men under whom 'Eddie,' as he is universally called, has  served he has become most attached to Judge Day, whom he says is the  finest man he ever saw.\"    \"Minister Polo was determined not to receive the ultimatum. He was  confident he would receive a private tip from the White House, which  would enable him to demand his passports before the ultimatum was  served upon him. Then he could refuse to receive it, saying that  he was no longer Minister. It will be remembered that Spain handed  Minister Woodford his passports before the American representative  could present the ultimatum to the Spanish Government.\"    \"Judge Day's training as a country lawyer stood him in good stead. He  had learned the value of being the first to get in an attachment.\"    \"The ultimatum was placed in a large, square envelope, that might have  contained an invitation to dinner. It was natural that it should be  given to 'Eddie' Savoy. He had gained the sobriquet of the nation's  'bouncer,' from the fact that he had handed Lord Sackville-West and  Minister De Lome their passports.\"    \"It was 11:30 o'clock on Wednesday morning when 'Eddie' Savoy pushed  the electric button at the front door of the Spanish Legation, in  Massachusetts avenue. The old Spanish soldier who acted as doorkeeper  responded.\"    \"'Have something here for the Minister,' said Eddie.\"    \"The porter looked at him suspiciously, but he permitted the messenger  to pass into the vestibule, which is perhaps six feet square. Beyond  the vestibule is a passage that leads to the large central hall. The  Minister stood in the hall. In one hand he held an envelope. It was  addressed to the Secretary of State. It contained a request for the  passports of the Minister and his suite. Senor Polo had personally  brought the document from the chancellory above.\"    \"When the porter presented the letter just brought by the Department  of State's messenger, Senor Polo grasped it in his quick, nervous  way. He opened the envelope and realized instantly that he had been  outwitted. A cynical smile passed over the Minister's face as he  handed his request for passports to 'Eddie,' who bowed and smiled on  the Minister.\"    \"Senor Polo stepped back into the hall and started to read the  ultimatum carefully. But he stopped and turned his head toward the  door.\"    \"'This is indeed Jeffersonian simplicity,' he said.\"    \"'Eddie' Savoy felt very badly over the incident, because he had  learned to like Minister Polo personally.\"    \"'He was so pleasant that I felt like asking him to stay a little  longer,' said 'Eddie,' 'but I didn't, for that wouldn't have been  diplomatic. When you have been in this department twenty-five or  thirty years you learn never to say what you want to say and never to  speak unless you think twice.'\"    \"Wherefore it will be seen that 'Eddie' Savoy has mastered the first  principles of diplomacy.\"--_N.Y. World._    A COPY OF THE RESOLUTION BY CONGRESS was also cabled to Minister  Woodford, at Madrid, to be officially transmitted to the Spanish  Government, fixing the 23d as the limit for its reply, but the Spanish  Minister of Foreign Affairs had already learned of the action of  Congress, and did not permit Minister Woodford to ask for his  passports, but sent them to him on the evening of the 21st, and this  was the formal beginning of the war.    [Illustration: JOSE MACEO.]    A FATAL STEP WAS THIS FOR SPAIN, who evidently, as her newspapers  declared, did not think the \"American pigs\" would fight. She was  unaware of the temper of the people, who seemed to those who knew the  facts, actually thirsting for Spanish blood--a feeling due more  or less to thirty years of peace, in which the nation had become  restless, and to the fact also that America had some new boats, fine  specimens of workmanship, which had been at target practice for a long  time and now yearned for the reality, like the boy who has a gun and  wants to try it on the real game. The proof of the superiority of  American gunnery was demonstrated in every naval battle. The accurate  aim of Dewey's gunners at Manilla, and Sampson and Schley's at  Santiago, was nothing less than wonderful. No less wonderful,  however, was the accuracy of the Americans than the inaccuracy of the  Spaniards, who seemed almost unable to hit anything.    WHILE ACCREDITING THE AMERICAN NAVY with its full share of praise for  its wonderful accomplishments, let us remember that there is scarcely  a boat in the navy flying the American flag but what has a number of  COLORED SAILORS on it, who, along with others, help to make up its  greatness and superiority.          CHAPTER II.      THE BEGINNING OF HOSTILITIES.      A COLORED HERO IN THE NAVY.    History records the Negro as the first man to fall in three wars of  America--Crispus Attacks in the Boston massacre, March 5, 1770; an  unknown Negro in Baltimore when the Federal troops were mobbed in  that city _en route_ to the front, and Elijah B. Tunnell, of Accomac  county, Virginia, who fell simultaneously with or a second before  Ensign Bagley, of the torpedo boat _Winslow_, in the harbor of  Cardenas May 11, 1898, in the Spanish-American war.    Elijah B. Tunnell was employed as cabin cook on the _Winslow_. The  boat, under a severe fire from masked batteries of the Spanish on  shore, was disabled. The Wilmington came to her rescue, the enemy  meanwhile still pouring on a heavy fire. It was difficult to get the  \"line\" fastened so that the _Winslow_ could be towed off out of range  of the Spanish guns. Realizing the danger the boat and crew were in,  and anxious to be of service, Tunnell left his regular work and went  on deck to assist in \"making fast\" the two boats, and while thus  engaged a shell came, which, bursting over the group of workers,  killed him and three others. It has been stated in newspaper reports  of this incident that it was an ill-aimed shell of one of the American  boats that killed Tunnell and Bagley. Tunnell was taken on board the  Wilmington with both legs blown off, and fearfully mutilated. Turning  to those about him he asked, \"Did we win in the fight boys?\" The reply  was, \"Yes.\"    He said, \"Then I die happy.\" While others fell at the post of duty it  may be said of this brave Negro that he fell while doing _more_ than  his duty. He might have kept out of harm's way if he had desired, but  seeing the situation he rushed forward to relieve it as best he could,  and died a \"volunteer\" in service, doing what others ought to have  done. All honor to the memory of Elijah B. Tunnell, who, if not  the first, certainly simultaneous with the first, martyr of the  Spanish-American war. While our white fellow-citizens justly herald  the fame of Ensign Bagley, who was known to the author from his youth,  let our colored patriots proclaim the heroism of Tunnell of Accomac.  While not ranking as an official in the navy, yet he was brave, he was  faithful and we may inscribe over his grave that \"he died doing what  he could for his country.\"    War between the United States and Spain began April 21, 1898. Actual  hostilities ended August 12, 1898, by the signing of the protocol by  the Secretary of State of the United States for the United States and  M. Cambon, the French Ambassador at Washington, acting for Spain.    The war lasted 114 days. The Americans were victorious in every  regular engagement. In the three-days battle around Santiago, the  Americans lost 22 officers and 208 men killed, and 81 officers and  1,203 men wounded, and 79 missing. The Spanish loss as best estimated  was near 1,600 officers and men killed and wounded.    Santiago was surrendered July 17, 1898, with something over 22,000  troops.    General Shatter estimates in his report the American forces as  numbering 16,072 with 815 officers.          CHAPTER III.      SERGEANT-MAJOR PULLEN OF THE 25TH INFANTRY DESCRIBES THE CONDUCT OF  THE NEGRO SOLDIERS AROUND EL CANEY.      THE TWENTY-FIFTH U.S. INFANTRY--ITS STATION BEFORE THE SPANISH  AMERICAN WAR AND TRIP TO TAMPA,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11112"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 13, No. 351, (#3)"],[1,"dvancing, the consternation became  general, and every one hurried to the Place Royale, where the  Hanoverians and Brunswickers were already mustering.    About one o'clock in the morning of the 16th, the whole population of  Brussels seemed in motion. The streets were crowded as in full day;  lights flashed to and fro; artillery and baggage-wagons were creaking in  every direction; the drums beat to arms, and the bugles sounded loudly  \"the dreadful note of preparation.\" The noise and bustle surpassed all  description; here were horses plunging and kicking amidst a crowd of  terrified burghers; there lovers parting from their weeping mistresses.  Now the attention was attracted by a park of artillery thundering  through the streets; and now, by a group of officers disputing loudly  the demands of their imperturbable Flemish landlords; for not even the  panic which prevailed could frighten the Flemings out of a single  stiver; screams and yells occasionally rose above the busy hum that  murmured through the crowd, but the general sound resembled the roar of  the distant ocean. Between two and three o'clock the Brunswickers  marched from the town, still clad in the mourning which they wore for  their old duke, and burning to avenge his death. Alas! they had a still  more fatal loss to lament ere they returned. At four, the whole  disposable force under the Duke of Wellington was collected together,  but in such haste, that many of the officers had not time to change  their silk stockings and dancing shoes; and some, quite overcome by  drowsiness, were seen lying asleep about the ramparts, still holding,  however, with a firm hand, the reins of their horses which were grazing  by their sides. About five o'clock, the word \"march\" was heard in all  directions, and instantly the whole mass appeared to move  simultaneously. I conversed with several of the officers previous to  their departure, and not one appeared to have the slightest idea of an  approaching engagement. The Duke of Wellington and his staff did not  quit Brussels till past eleven o'clock; and it was not till some time  after they were gone, that it was generally known the whole French army,  including a strong corps of cavalry, was within a few miles of Quatre  Bras, where the brave Duke of Brunswick first met the enemy:      \"And foremost fighting--fell.\"    Dismay seized us all, when we found that a powerful French army was  really within twenty-eight miles of us; and we shuddered at the thought  of the awful contest which was taking place. For my own part, I had  never been so near a field of battle before, and I cannot describe my  sensations. We knew that our army had no alternative but to fly, or  fight with a force four times stronger than its own: and though we  could not doubt British bravery, we trembled at the fearful odds to  which our men must be exposed. Cannon, lances, and swords, were opposed  to the English bayonet alone. Cavalry we had none on the first day, for  the horses had been sent to grass, and the men were scattered too widely  over the country, to be collected at such short notice. Under these  circumstances, victory was impossible; indeed, nothing but the stanch  bravery, and exact discipline of the men, prevented the foremost of our  infantry from being annihilated; and though the English maintained their  ground during the day, at night a retreat became necessary. The agony of  the British, resident at Brussels, during the whole of this eventful  day, sets all language at defiance. No one thought of rest or food; but  every one who could get a telescope, flew to the ramparts to strain his  eyes, in vain attempts to discover what was passing. At length, some  soldiers in French uniforms were seen in the distance; and as the news  flew from mouth to mouth, it was soon magnified into a rumour that the  French were coming. Horror seized the English and their adherents, and  the hitherto concealed partizans of the French began openly to avow  themselves; tri-coloured ribbons grew suddenly into great request, and  cries of \"Vive l'Empereur!\" resounded through the air. These  exclamations, however, were changed to \"Vive le Lord Vellington!\" when  it was discovered that the approaching French came as captives, not  conquerors.    Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I walked up to the  _Porte de Namur_, where the wounded were just beginning to arrive.  Fortunately some commodious caravans had arrived from England, only a  few days before, and these were now entering the gate. They were filled  principally with Brunswickers and Highlanders; and it was an appalling  spectacle to behold the very soldiers, whose fine martial appearance and  excellent appointments I had so much admired at the review, now lying  helpless and mutilated--their uniforms soiled with blood and dirt--their  mouths blackened with biting their cartridges, and all the splendour of  their equipments entirely destroyed. When the caravans stopped, I  approached them, and addressed a Scotch officer who was only slightly  wounded in the knee.--\"Are the French coming, sir?\" asked I.--\"Egad I  can't tell,\" returned he. \"We know nothing about it. We had enough to do  to take care of ourselves. They are fighting like devils; and I'm off  again as soon as my wound's dressed.\"--An English lady, elegantly  attired, now rushed forwards--\"Is my husband safe?\" asked she  eagerly.--\"Good God! Madam,\" replied one of the men, \"how can we  possibly tell! I don't know the fate of those who were fighting by my  side; and I could not see a yard round me.\" She scarcely heeded what he  said; and rushed out of the gate, wildly repeating her question to every  one she met. Some French prisoners now arrived. I noticed one, a fine  fellow, who had had one arm shot off; and though the bloody and mangled  tendons were still undressed, and had actually dried and blackened in  the sun, he marched along with apparent indifference, carrying a loaf of  bread under his remaining arm, and shouting _\"Vive l'Empereur!\"_ I asked  him if the French were coming.--\"Je le crois bien,\" returned he,  \"preparez un souper, mes bourgeois--il soupera a Bruxelles ce  soir.\"--Pretty information for me, thought I. \"Don't believe him, sir,\"  said a Scotchman, who lay close beside me, struggling to speak, though  apparently in the last agony. \"It's all right--I--assure--you--.\" The  whole of Friday night was passed in the greatest anxiety; the wounded  arrived every hour, and the accounts they brought of the carnage which  was taking place were absolutely terrific. Saturday morning was still  worse; an immense number of supernumeraries and runaways from the army  came rushing in at the _Porte de Namur,_ and these fugitives increased  the public panic to the utmost. _Sauve qui peut!_ now became the  universal feeling; all ties of friendship or kindred were forgotten, and  an earnest desire to quit Brussels seemed to absorb every faculty. To  effect this object, the greatest sacrifices were made. Every beast of  burthen, and every species of vehicle were put into requisition to  convey persons and property to Antwerp. Even the dogs and fish-carts did  not escape--enormous sums were given for the humblest modes of  conveyance, and when all failed, numbers set off on foot. The road soon  became choked up--cars, wagons, and carriages of every description were  joined together in an immovable mass and property to an immense amount  was abandoned by its owners, who were too much terrified even to think  of the loss they were sustaining. A scene of frightful riot and  devastation ensued. Trunks, boxes, and portmanteaus were broken open and  pillaged without mercy; and every one who pleased, helped himself to  what he liked with impunity. The disorder was increased by a rumour,  that the Duke of Wellington was retreating towards Brussels, in a sort  of running fight, closely pursued by the enemy; the terror of the  fugitives now almost amounted to frenzy, and they flew like maniacs  escaping from a madhouse. It is scarcely possible to imagine a more  distressing scene. A great deal of rain had fallen during the night, and  the unhappy fugitives were obliged literally to wade through mud. I had,  from the first, determined to await my fate in Brussels; but on this  eventful morning, I walked a few miles on the road to Antwerp, to  endeavour to assist my flying countrymen. I was soon disgusted with the  scene, and finding all my efforts to be useful, unavailing, I returned  to the town, which now seemed like a city of the dead; for a gloomy  silence reigned through the streets, like that fearful calm which  precedes a storm; the shops were all closed, and all business was  suspended. During the panic of Friday and Saturday, the sacrifice of  property made by the British residents was enormous. A chest of drawers  sold for five francs, a bed for ten, and a horse for fifty. In one  instance, which fell immediately under my own observation, some  household furniture was sold for one thousand francs, (about 40 l.) for  which the owner had given seven thousand francs, (280 l.) only three  weeks before. This was by no means a solitary instance; indeed in most  cases, the loss was much greater, and in many, houses full of furniture  were entirely deserted, and abandoned to pillage.    Sunday morning was ushered in by one of the most dreadful tempests I  ever remember. The crashing of thunder was followed by the roar of  cannon, which was now distinctly heard from the ramparts, and it is not  possible to describe the fearful effect of this apparent mockery of  heaven. I never before felt so forcibly the feebleness of man. The rain  was tremendous--the sky looked like that in Poussin's picture of the  Deluge, and a heavy black cloud spread, like the wings of a monstrous  vulture, over Brussels. The wounded continued to arrive the whole of  Saturday night and Sunday morning, in a condition which defies  description. They "]]]
