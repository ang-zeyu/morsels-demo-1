Then, coming in an opposite direction,  appeared the headlamp of another car, of a car that raced nearer and  nearer to us, so that, within a few seconds of its first appearance, we  found ourselves bathed in the beam of its headlights.    Smith bounded out into the road, and stood, a weird silhouette, with  upraised arms, fully in its course!    The brakes were applied hurriedly. It was a big limousine, and its  driver swerved perilously in avoiding Smith and nearly ran into me.  But, the breathless moment past, the car was pulled up, head on to the  railings; and a man in evening clothes was demanding excitedly what had  happened. Smith, a hatless, disheveled figure, stepped up to the door.    \"My name is Nayland Smith,\" he said rapidly--\"Burmese Commissioner.\" He  snatched a letter from his pocket and thrust it into the hands of the  bewildered man. \"Read that. It is signed by another Commissioner--the  Commissioner of Police.\"    With amazement written all over him, the other obeyed.    \"You see,\" continued my friend, tersely--\"it is carte blanche. I wish to  commandeer your car, sir, on a matter of life and death!\".    The other returned the letter.    \"Allow me to offer it!\" he said, descending. \"My man will take your  orders. I can finish my journey by cab. I am--\"    But Smith did not wait to learn whom he might be.    \"Quick!\" he cried to the stupefied chauffeur--\"You passed a car a minute  ago--yonder. Can you overtake it?\"    \"I can try, sir, if I don't lose her track.\"    Smith leaped in, pulling me after him.    \"Do it!\" he snapped. \"There are no speed limits for me. Thanks!  Goodnight, sir!\"    We were off! The car swung around and the chase commenced.    One last glimpse I had of the man we had dispossessed, standing alone by  the roadside, and at ever increasing speed, we leaped away in the track  of Eltham's captors.    Smith was too highly excited for ordinary conversation, but he threw out  short, staccato remarks.    \"I have followed Fu-Manchu from Hongkong,\" he jerked. \"Lost him at Suez.  He got here a boat ahead of me. Eltham has been corresponding with some  mandarin up-country. Knew that. Came straight to you. Only got in this  evening. He--Fu-Manchu--has been sent here to get Eltham. My God! and  he has him! He will question him! The interior of China--a seething  pot, Petrie! They had to stop the leakage of information. He is here for  that.\"    The car pulled up with a jerk that pitched me out of my seat, and the  chauffeur leaped to the road and ran ahead. Smith was out in a trice, as  the man, who had run up to a constable, came racing back.    \"Jump in, sir--jump in!\" he cried, his eyes bright with the lust of the  chase; \"they are making for Battersea!\"    And we were off again.    Through the empty streets we roared on. A place of gasometers and  desolate waste lots slipped behind and we were in a narrow way where  gates of yards and a few lowly houses faced upon a prospect of high  blank wall.    \"Thames on our right,\" said Smith, peering ahead. \"His rathole is by the  river as usual. Hi!\"--he grabbed up the speaking-tube--\"Stop! Stop!\"    The limousine swung in to the narrow sidewalk, and pulled up close by a  yard gate. I, too, had seen our quarry--a long, low bodied car, showing  no inside lights. It had turned the next corner, where a street lamp  shone greenly, not a hundred yards ahead.    Smith leaped out, and I followed him.    \"That must be a cul de sac,\" he said, and turned to the eager-eyed  chauffeur. \"Run back to that last turning,\" he ordered, \"and wait there,  out of sight. Bring the car up when you hear a police-whistle.\"    The man looked disappointed, but did not question the order. As he began  to back away, Smith grasped me by the arm and drew me forward.    \"We must get to that corner,\" he said, \"and see where the car stands,  without showing ourselves.\"        CHAPTER III. THE WIRE JACKET    I suppose we were not more than a dozen paces from the lamp when we  heard the thudding of the motor. The car was backing out!    It was a desperate moment, for it seemed that we could not fail to be  discovered. Nayland Smith began to look about him, feverishly, for a  hiding-place, a quest in which I seconded with equal anxiety. And Fate  was kind to us--doubly kind as after events revealed. A wooden gate  broke the expanse of wall hard by upon the right, and, as the result of  some recent accident, a ragged gap had been torn in the panels close to  the top.    The chain of the padlock hung loosely; and in a second Smith was up,  with his foot in this as in a stirrup. He threw his arm over the top and  drew himself upright. A second later he was astride the broken gate.    \"Up you come, Petrie!\" he said, and reached down his hand to aid me.    I got my foot into the loop of chain, grasped at a projection in the  gatepost and found myself up.    \"There is a crossbar on this side to stand on,\" said Smith.    He climbed over and vanished in the darkness. I was still astride the  broken gate when the car turned the corner, slowly, for there was scanty  room; but I was standing upon the bar on the inside and had my head  below the gap ere the driver could possibly have seen me.    \"Stay where you are until he passes,\" hissed my companion, below. \"There  is a row of kegs under you.\"    The sound of the motor passing outside grew loud--louder--then began to  die away. I felt about with my left foot; discerned the top of a keg,  and dropped, panting, beside Smith.    \"Phew!\" I said--\"that was a close thing! Smith--how do we know--\"    \"That we have followed the right car?\" he interrupted. \"Ask yourself the  question: what would any ordinary man be doing motoring in a place like  this at two o'clock in the morning?\"    \"You are right, Smith,\" I agreed. \"Shall we get out again?\"    \"Not yet. I have an idea. Look yonder.\"    He grasped my arm, turning me in the desired direction.    Beyond a great expanse of unbroken darkness a ray of moonlight slanted  into the place wherein we stood, spilling its cold radiance upon rows of  kegs.    \"That's another door,\" continued my friend--I now began dimly to  perceive him beside me. \"If my calculations are not entirely wrong, it  opens on a wharf gate--\"    A steam siren hooted dismally, apparently from quite close at hand.    \"I'm right!\" snapped Smith. \"That turning leads down to the gate. Come  on, Petrie!\"    He directed the light of the electric torch upon a narrow path through  the ranks of casks, and led the way to the further door. A good two feet  of moonlight showed along the top. I heard Smith straining; then--    \"These kegs are all loaded with grease!\" he said, \"and I want to  reconnoiter over that door.\"    \"I am leaning on a crate which seems easy to move,\" I reported. \"Yes,  it's empty. Lend a hand.\"    We grasped the empty crate, and between us, set it up on a solid  pedestal of casks. Then Smith mounted to this observation platform and I  scrambled up beside him, and looked down upon the lane outside.    It terminated as Smith had foreseen at a wharf gate some six feet to  the right of our post. Piled up in the lane beneath us, against the  warehouse door, was a stack of empty casks. Beyond, over the way, was a  kind of ramshackle building that had possibly been a dwelling-house at  some time. Bills were stuck in the ground-floor window indicating that  the three floors were to let as offices; so much was discernible in that  reflected moonlight.    I could hear the tide, lapping upon the wharf, could feel the chill from  the river and hear the vague noises which, night nor day, never cease  upon the great commercial waterway.    \"Down!\" whispered Smith. \"Make no noise! I suspected it. They heard the  car following!\"    I obeyed, clutching at him for support; for I was suddenly dizzy, and my  heart was leaping wildly--furiously.    \"You saw her?\" he whispered.    Saw her! yes, I had seen her! And my poor dream-world was toppling about  me, its cities, ashes and its fairness, dust.    Peering from the window, her great eyes wondrous in the moonlight and  her red lips parted, hair gleaming like burnished foam and her anxious  gaze set upon the corner of the lane--was Karamaneh... Karamaneh whom  once we had rescued from the house of this fiendish Chinese doctor;  Karamaneh who had been our ally; in fruitless quest of whom,--when, too  late, I realized how empty my life was become--I had wasted what little  of the world's goods I possessed;--Karamaneh!    \"Poor old Petrie,\" murmured Smith--\"I knew, but I hadn't the heart--He  has her again--God knows by what chains he holds her. But she's only  a woman, old boy, and women are very much alike--very much alike from  Charing Cross to Pagoda Road.\"    He rested his hand on my shoulder for a moment; I am ashamed to confess  that I was trembling; then, clenching my teeth with that mechanical  physical effort which often accompanies a mental one, I swallowed the  bitter draught of Nayland Smith's philosophy. He was raising himself, to  peer, cautiously, over the top of the door. I did likewise.    The window from which the girl had looked was nearly on a level with our  eyes, and as I raised my head above the woodwork, I quite distinctly  saw her go out of the room. The door, as she opened it, admitted a dull  light, against which her figure showed silhouetted for a moment. Then  the door was reclosed.    \"We must risk the other windows,\" rapped Smith.    Before I had grasped the nature of his plan he was over and had dropped  almost noiselessly upon the casks outside. Again I followed his lead.    \"You are not going to attempt anything, singlehanded--against him?\" I  asked.    \"Petrie--Eltham is in that house. He has been brought here to be put  to the question, in the medieval, and Chinese, sense! Is there time to  summon assistance?\"    I shuddered.

But Varro, a more matter-of-fact observer, does  not disguise the plain truth--that these disasters were often the  product of pure malicious frolic. For instance, in recommending a  certain kind of quickset fence, he insists upon it as one of its  advantages--that it will not readily ignite under the torch of the  mischievous wayfarer: \"Naturale sepimentum,\" says he, \"quod obseri  solet virgultis aut spinis, _praetereuntis lascivi non metuet facem_.\"  It is not easy to see the origin or advantage of this practice of  nocturnal travelling, (which must have considerably increased the  hazards of a journey,) excepting only in the heats of summer. It is  probable, however, that men of high rank and public station may have  introduced the practice by way of releasing corporate bodies in large  towns from the burdensome ceremonies of public receptions; thus making  a compromise between their own dignity and the convenience of the  provincial public. Once introduced, and the arrangements upon the road  for meeting the wants of travellers once adapted to such a practice,  it would easily become universal. It is, however, very possible that  mere horror of the heats of daytime may have been the original ground  for it. The ancients appear to have shrunk from no hardship as so  trying and insufferable as that of heat. And in relation to that  subject, it is interesting to observe the way in which the ordinary  use of language has accommodated itself to that feeling. Our northern  way of expressing effeminacy, is derived chiefly from the hardships of  cold. He that shrinks from the trials and rough experience of real  life in any department, is described by the contemptuous prefix of  _chimney-corner_, as if shrinking from the cold which he would meet on  coming out into the open air amongst his fellow men. Thus, a  _chimney-corner_ politician for a mere speculator or unpractical  dreamer. But the very same indolent habit of aerial speculation, which  courts no test of real life and practice, is described by the ancients  under the term _umbraticus_, or seeking the cool shade, and shrinking  from the heat. Thus an _umbraticus doctor_ is one who has no practical  solidity in his teaching. The fatigue and hardship of real life, in  short, is represented by the ancients under the uniform image of heat,  and by the moderns under that of cold.    _Blackwood's Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *        RETROSPECTIVE GLEANINGS.           *       *       *       *       *      \"PROGRESS\" OF CHARLES II.

The vicarage of Wyburn, or Winsburn, Cumberland, is of the following  tempting value: Fifty shilling per annum, a new surplice, a pair of  clogs, and feed on the common for one goose. This favoured church  preferment is in the midst of a wild country, inhabited by shepherds.  The clerk keeps a pot-house opposite the church. The service is once a  fortnight; and when there is no congregation, the Vicar and Moses  regale themselves at the bar.    D.P.           *       *       *       *       *      BAD ALE.

In _Domesday Book_ we find frequent mention of goldsmiths; and we know  the Anglo-Saxons had their goldsmiths, silversmiths, and coppersmiths.  Bowyers, or makers of cross-bows, are frequently mentioned--as are  carpenters, potters, bakers, and brewers, the last of which were  chiefly women. Both war and agriculture want the smith: hence his  importance among the Saxons. They were free from all other services,  on payment of a penny yearly for their forge. We also meet with  butchers, barbers, embroiderers, saddlers, parchment-makers, and  salt-makers.    D.P.           *       *       *       *       *      PHYSICIANS' FEES.

Those that are only licensed physicians, their due is  no more than _6s. 9d._, though they commonly demand _10s_. A surgeon's  journey is _12d._ a mile, be his journey far or near.

In the _Annals of Sporting_ it is observed:--\"If we are to place  confidence in traveller's tales, the ostrich is swifter than the  Arabian horse. During the residence of Mr. Adamson at Pador, a French  factory on the south side of the river Niger, he says that two  ostriches, which had been about two years in the factory, afforded him  a sight of a very extraordinary nature. These gigantic birds, though  young, were of nearly the full size. They were (he continues) so tame,  that two little blacks mounted both together on the back of the  larger. No sooner did he feel their weight, than he began to run as  last as possible, and carried them several times round the  village,--and it was impossible to stop him, otherwise than by  obstructing the passage. This sight pleased me so much, that I wished  it to be repeated, and, to try their strength, directed a full-grown  negro to mount the smallest, and two others the larger. This burden  did not seem at all disproportioned to their strength. At first, they  went at a pretty sharp trot; but when they became heated a little,  they expanded their wings, as though to catch the wind, and moved with  such fleetness that they seemed scarcely to touch the ground. Most  people have, at one time or other, seen the partridge run, and  consequently must know that there is no man able to keep up with it;  and it is easy to imagine, that if this bird had a longer step, its  speed would be considerably augmented. The ostrich moves like the  partridge, with this advantage; and I am satisfied that those I am  speaking of would have distanced the fleetest race-horses that were  ever bred in England. It is true, that they would not hold out so long  as a horse; but they would, undoubtedly, be able to go over the space  in less time. I have frequently beheld this sight, which is capable of  giving one an idea of the prodigious strength of the ostrich, and of  showing what use it might be of, had we but the method of breaking and  managing it as we do the horse.\"    The following interesting particulars, relating to the capability of  the ostrich to digest hard substances, is given by Mr. Fuller, in his  _Tour of the Turkish Empire_:--\"An ostrich, belonging to an English  gentleman, arrived at Cairo from Upper Egypt, and afforded us an  opportunity of observing this curious peculiarity in the natural  history of that animal.
