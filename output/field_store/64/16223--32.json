I    GOING TO WORK      On the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, where the sea forms a narrow  channel separating the British Isles from the European continent, lies  that part of France known as the old province of Normandy. There is  here a very dangerous and precipitous coast lined with granite cliffs.  The villages along the sea produce a hardy race of peasants who make  bold fishermen on the water and thrifty farmers on the land.    To this Norman peasant stock belonged Jean Francois Millet, the  painter of the pictures reproduced in this little book. He was brought  up to hard out-of-door labor on his father's farm in the village of  Greville, but when the artistic impulses within him could no longer  be repressed, he left his home to study art. Though he became a famous  painter, he always remained at heart a true peasant. He set up his  home and his studio in a village called Barbizon, near the Forest  of Fontainebleau, not many miles from Paris. Here he devoted all  his gifts to illustrating the life of the tillers of the soil. His  subjects were drawn both from his immediate surroundings and from the  recollections of his youth. \"Since I have never in all my life known  anything but the fields,\" he said, \"I try to say, as best I can, what  I saw and felt when I worked there.\" It is now a quarter of a century  since the painter's life work ended, and in these years some few  changes have been made in the customs and costumes which Millet's  pictures represented. Such changes, however, are only outward; the  real life of peasant labor is always the same. Seedtime and harvest,  toil, weariness and rest, the ties of home and of religion, are  subjects which never grow old fashioned.    In France the farm labors are shared by men and women alike. The  peasant woman is sturdily built, and her healthy out-of-door life  makes her very strong. She is fitted by nature and training to work  beside the men in the fields. In our first picture we see a young man  and woman starting out together for the day's work.    It is morning, and the early sun illumines the distant plain, where  ploughing has already begun. The light falls on the two figures as  they walk down the sloping hillside.    They are dressed for their work in clothing which is plain and coarse,  but which is perfectly suited for the purpose. The French peasants'  working clothes are usually of strong homespun cloth, fashioned in the  simplest way, to give the wearers entire ease in motion. They are in  the dull blues, browns, and reds which delight the artist's eye. Such  colors grow softer and more beautiful as they fade, so that garments  of this kind are none the less attractive for being old. Ragged  clothing is seldom seen among peasants. They are too thrifty and  self-respecting to make an untidy appearance.    [Illustration: From a carbon print by Braun, Clement & Co. John Andrew  & Son, Sc. GOING TO WORK]    The men wear soft felt hats, the brim of which can be pulled forward  to shade the eyes. The women cover their heads neatly with caps or  kerchiefs, and are nearly always seen with aprons. Men and women both  wear the heavy wooden shoes called _sabots_, in which the feet suffer  no pressure as from leather shoes, and are protected against the  moisture of the ground.    The peasants of our picture carry all they need for the day's work.  A three-pronged fork rests across the man's shoulder, and a wallet of  lunch hangs from his left arm. The woman has a basket, a linen sack,  and a bit of rope. Evidently something is to be brought home. Just now  she has swung the empty basket up over her shoulders and it covers her  head like a huge sunbonnet.    The two young people are full of the healthy vigor which makes work  a pleasure. They go cheerfully to their day's task as if they really  enjoyed it. We cannot help suspecting that they are lovers. The man  carries himself erect with a conscious air of manliness, and steps  briskly, with his hand thrust into his pocket. The girl hides her  shyness in the shadow of the basket as she turns her face towards  his. The two swing along buoyantly, keeping step as if accustomed to  walking together.    At the close of the day's work the basket and sack will be filled, and  the laborers will return to their home by the same way. The burden may  be heavy, but they will bear it as the reward of their toil.    The picture of Going to Work was painted at about the same time[1]  as the The Sower, which forms one of the later illustrations of our  collection. A comparison of the pictures will show interesting points  of resemblance between the two men striding down hill. Though Going to  Work is not as a work of art of equal rank with The Sower, we get in  both pictures a delightful sense of motion which makes the figures  seem actually alive.      [Footnote 1: That is, within a year. See dates in the _Historical  Directory_.]          II    THE KNITTING LESSON      In the picture we have been examining we have seen something of the  outdoor life of the French peasants, and now we are shown the interior  of one of their houses, where a Knitting Lesson is being given. The  girls of the French peasantry are taught only the plainest kinds of  needlework. They have to begin to make themselves useful very early in  life, and knitting is a matter of special importance. In these large  families many pairs of stockings are needed, and all must be homemade.  This is work which the little girls can do while the mother is busy  with heavier labors. The knitting work becomes a girl's constant  companion, and there are few moments when her hands are idle.    The little girl in our picture is still a beginner in the art, and the  lesson is a very exciting occasion to her. Already she feels like a  woman.    The mother and daughter have their chairs by the window to get a good  light on the work. It is a large and beautiful casement window, of the  kind almost universal in France, opening lengthwise in the middle in  two parts which swing on hinges like doors. The window seat serves as  a table, to hold the basket and scissors. The doll is thrust into the  corner; our little girl has \"put away childish things\"--at least for  the moment,--and takes her task very seriously.    The two chairs are drawn close together, the one a small counterpart  of the other. The child braces her feet firmly on one of the rounds  and bends her whole mind to her work. Both mother and daughter wear  close white caps, though the little girl's is of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1312"],[0,"Selected Stories of Bret Harte (#3)"],[1,"who has already gathered some idea of  the reckless irreverence of Roaring Camp. The master of ceremonies  was one \"Boston,\" a noted wag, and the occasion seemed to promise the  greatest facetiousness. This ingenious satirist had spent two days  in preparing a burlesque of the Church service, with pointed local  allusions. The choir was properly trained, and Sandy Tipton was to stand  godfather. But after the procession had marched to the grove with music  and banners, and the child had been deposited before a mock altar,  Stumpy stepped before the expectant crowd. \"It ain't my style to spoil  fun, boys,\" said the little man, stoutly eyeing the faces around him,  \"but it strikes me that this thing ain't exactly on the squar. It's  playing it pretty low down on this yer baby to ring in fun on him that  he ain't goin' to understand. And ef there's goin' to be any godfathers  round, I'd like to see who's got any better rights than me.\" A silence  followed Stumpy's speech. To the credit of all humorists be it said that  the first man to acknowledge its justice was the satirist thus stopped  of his fun. \"But,\" said Stumpy, quickly following up his advantage,  \"we're here for a christening, and we'll have it. I proclaim you Thomas  Luck, according to the laws of the United States and the State of  California, so help me God.\" It was the first time that the name of the  Deity had been otherwise uttered than profanely in the camp. The form  of christening was perhaps even more ludicrous than the satirist had  conceived; but strangely enough, nobody saw it and nobody laughed.  \"Tommy\" was christened as seriously as he would have been under a  Christian roof and cried and was comforted in as orthodox fashion.    And so the work of regeneration began in Roaring Camp. Almost  imperceptibly a change came over the settlement. The cabin assigned to  \"Tommy Luck\"--or \"The Luck,\" as he was more frequently called--first  showed signs of improvement. It was kept scrupulously clean and  whitewashed. Then it was boarded, clothed, and papered. The rose wood  cradle, packed eighty miles by mule, had, in Stumpy's way of putting it,  \"sorter killed the rest of the furniture.\" So the rehabilitation of the  cabin became a necessity. The men who were in the habit of lounging  in at Stumpy's to see \"how 'The Luck' got on\" seemed to appreciate  the change, and in self-defense the rival establishment of \"Tuttle's  grocery\" bestirred itself and imported a carpet and mirrors. The  reflections of the latter on the appearance of Roaring Camp tended to  produce stricter habits of personal cleanliness. Again Stumpy imposed a  kind of quarantine upon those who aspired to the honor and privilege of  holding The Luck. It was a cruel mortification to Kentuck--who, in the  carelessness of a large nature and the habits of frontier life, had  begun to regard all garments as a second cuticle, which, like a snake's,  only sloughed off through decay--to be debarred this privilege from  certain prudential reasons. Yet such was the subtle influence of  innovation that he thereafter appeared regularly every afternoon in a  clean shirt and face still shining from his ablutions. Nor were moral  and social sanitary laws neglected. \"Tommy,\" who was supposed to spend  his whole existence in a persistent attempt to repose, must not be  disturbed by noise. The shouting and yelling, which had gained the camp  its infelicitous title, were not permitted within hearing distance of  Stumpy's. The men conversed in whispers or smoked with Indian gravity.  Profanity was tacitly given up in these sacred precincts, and throughout  the camp a popular form of expletive, known as \"D--n the luck!\" and  \"Curse the luck!\" was abandoned, as having a new personal bearing.  Vocal music was not interdicted, being supposed to have a soothing,  tranquilizing quality; and one song, sung by \"Man-o'-War Jack,\" an  English sailor from her Majesty's Australian colonies, was quite popular  as a lullaby. It was a lugubrious recital of the exploits of \"the  Arethusa, Seventy-four,\" in a muffled minor, ending with a prolonged  dying fall at the burden of each verse, \"On b-oo-o-ard of the Arethusa.\"  It was a fine sight to see Jack holding The Luck, rocking from side  to side as if with the motion of a ship, and crooning forth this naval  ditty. Either through the peculiar rocking of Jack or the length of his  song,--it contained ninety stanzas, and was continued with conscientious  deliberation to the bitter end,--the lullaby generally had the desired  effect. At such times the men would lie at full length under the trees  in the soft summer twilight, smoking their pipes and drinking in  the melodious utterances. An indistinct idea that this was pastoral  happiness pervaded the camp. \"This 'ere kind o' think,\" said the Cockney  Simmons, meditatively reclining on his elbow, \"is 'evingly.\" It reminded  him of Greenwich.    On the long summer days The Luck was usually carried to the gulch from  whence the golden store of Roaring Camp was taken. There, on a blanket  spread over pine boughs, he would lie while the men were working in the  ditches below. Latterly there was a rude attempt to decorate this bower  with flowers and sweet-smelling shrubs, and generally some one would  bring him a cluster of wild honeysuckles, azaleas, or the painted  blossoms of Las Mariposas. The men had suddenly awakened to the fact  that there were beauty and significance in these trifles, which they  had so long trodden carelessly beneath their feet. A flake of glittering  mica, a fragment of variegated quartz, a bright pebble from the bed of  the creek, became beautiful to eyes thus cleared and strengthened,  and were invariably pat aside for The Luck. It was wonderful how many  treasures the woods and hillsides yielded that \"would do for Tommy.\"  Surrounded by playthings such as never child out of fairyland had  before, it is to be hoped that Tommy was content. He appeared to be  serenely happy, albeit there was an infantine gravity about him, a  contemplative light in his round gray eyes, that sometimes worried  Stumpy. He was always tractable and quiet, and it is recorded that once,  having crept beyond his \"corral,\"--a hedge of tessellated pine boughs,  which surrounded his bed,--he dropped over the bank on his head in  the soft earth, and remained with his mottled legs in the air in that  position for at least five minutes with unflinching gravity. He was  extricated without a murmur. I hesitate to record the many other  instances of his sagacity, which rest, unfortunately, upon the  statements of prejudiced friends. Some of them were not without a tinge  of superstition. \"I crep' up the bank just now,\" said Kentuck one  day, in a breathless state of excitement \"and dern my skin if he was  a-talking to a jay bird as was a-sittin' on his lap. There they was,  just as free and sociable as anything you please, a-jawin' at each  other just like two cherrybums.\" Howbeit, whether creeping over the pine  boughs or lying lazily on his back blinking at the leaves above him, to  him the birds sang, the squirrels chattered, and the flowers bloomed.  Nature was his nurse and playfellow. For him she would let slip between  the leaves golden shafts of sunlight that fell just within his grasp;  she would send wandering breezes to visit him with the balm of bay and  resinous gum; to him the tall redwoods nodded familiarly and sleepily,  the bumblebees buzzed, and the rooks cawed a slumbrous accompaniment.    Such was the golden summer of Roaring Camp. They were \"flush times,\" and  the luck was with them. The claims had yielded enormously. The camp  was jealous of its privileges and looked suspiciously on strangers. No  encouragement was given to immigration, and, to make their seclusion  more perfect, the land on either side of the mountain wall that  surrounded the camp they duly preempted. This, and a reputation for  singular proficiency with the revolver, kept the reserve of Roaring  Camp inviolate. The expressman--their only connecting link with the  surrounding world--sometimes told wonderful stories of the camp. He  would say, \"They've a street up there in 'Roaring' that would lay over  any street in Red Dog. They've got vines and flowers round their houses,  and they wash themselves twice a day. But they're mighty rough on  strangers, and they worship an Ingin baby.\"    With the prosperity of the camp came a desire for further improvement.  It was proposed to build a hotel in the following spring, and to invite  one or two decent families to reside there for the sake of The Luck, who  might perhaps profit by female companionship. The sacrifice that this  concession to the sex cost these men, who were fiercely skeptical in  regard to its general virtue and usefulness, can only be accounted for  by their affection for Tommy. A few still held out. But the resolve  could not be carried into effect for three months, and the minority  meekly yielded in the hope that something might turn up to prevent it.  And it did.    The winter of 1851 will long be remembered in the foothills. The snow  lay deep on the Sierras, and every mountain creek became a river,  and every river a lake. Each gorge and gulch was transformed into a  tumultuous watercourse that descended the hillsides, tearing down giant  trees and scattering its drift and debris along the plain. Red Dog had  been twice under water, and Roaring Camp had been forewarned. \"Water put  the gold into them gulches,\" said Stumpy. \"It been here once and will  be here again!\" And that night the North Fork suddenly leaped over its  banks and swept up the triangular valley of Roaring Camp.    In the confusion of rushing water, crashing trees, and crackling timber,  and the darkness which seemed to flow with the water and blot out the  fair valley, but little could be done to collect the scattered camp.  When the morning broke, the cabin of Stumpy, nearest the river-bank, was "]]]
