And for a great week I had my walks in another direction; but in the end  of that week, I must take my walk along the olden way, that I might  chance to have but a sight of My Lady. And, truly, I had all sight that  ever man did need to put him in dread pain and jealousy; for, truly, as  I came in view of the gap, there was the Lady Mirdath walking just  without the borders of the great wood; and beside her there walked the  clever-drest man of the Court, and she suffered his arm around her, so  that I knew they were lovers; for the Lady Mirdath had no brothers nor  any youthful men kin.    Yet, when Mirdath saw me upon the road, she shamed in a moment to be so  caught; for she put her lover's arm from about her, and bowed to me, a  little changed of colour in the face; and I bowed very low--being but a  young man myself--; and so passed on, with my heart very dead in me. And  as I went, I saw that her lover came again to her, and had his arm once  more about her; and so, maybe, they looked after me, as I went very  stiff and desperate; but, indeed, I looked not back on them, as you may  think.    And for a great month then, I went not near to the gap; for my love  raged in me, and I was hurt in my pride; and, truly, neither had a true  justice been dealt to me by the Lady Mirdath. Yet in that month, my love  was a leaven in me, and made slowly a sweetness and a tenderness and an  understanding that were not in me before; and truly Love and Pain do  shape the Character of Man.    And in the end of that time, I saw a little way into Life, with an  understanding heart, and began presently to take my walks again past the  gap; but truly Mirdath the Beautiful was never to my sight; though one  evening I thought she might be not a great way off; for one of her great  boar-hounds came out of the wood, and down into the road to nose against  me, very friendly, as a dog oft doth with me.    Yet, though I waited a good time after the dog had left me, I had no  sight of Mirdath, and so passed on again, with my heart heavy in me; but  without bitterness, because of the understanding that was begun to grow  in my heart.    Now, there passed two weary and lonely weeks, in which I grew sick to  have knowledge of the beautiful maid. And, truly, in the end of that  time, I made a sudden resolving that I would go in through the gap, and  come to the home-grounds about the Hall, and so maybe have some sight of  her.    And this resolving I had one evening; and I went out immediately, and  came to the gap, and went in through the gap, and so by a long walking  to the gardens about the Hall. And, truly, when I was come there, I saw  a good light of lanthorns and torches, and a great company of people  dancing; and all drest in quaint dress; so that I knew they had a  festival for some cause. And there came suddenly a horrid dread into my  heart that this might be the marriage-dance of the Lady Mirdath; but,  indeed, this was foolishness; for I had surely heard of the marriage, if  there had been any. And, truly, in a moment, I remembered that she was  come one-and-twenty years of age on that day, and to the end of her  ward-ship; and this surely to be festival in honour of the same.    And a very bright and pretty matter it was to watch, save that I was so  heavy in the heart with loneliness and longing; for the company was  great and gay, and the lights plentiful and set all about from the  trees; and in leaf-made arbours about the great lawn. And a great table  spread with eating matters and silver and crystal, and great lamps of  bronze and silver went all a-down one end of the lawn; and the dance  constant upon the other part.    And surely, the Lady Mirdath to step out of the dance, very lovely  drest; yet seeming, to mine eyes, a little pale in the looming of the  lights. And she to wander to a seat to rest; and, indeed, in a moment,  there to be a dozen youths of the great families of the country-side, in  attendance about her, making talk and laughter, and each eager for her  favour; and she very lovely in the midst of them, but yet, as I did  think, lacking of somewhat, and a little pale-seeming, as I have told;  and her glance to go odd-wise beyond the groupt men about her; so that I  understood in a moment that her lover was not there, and she to be  a-lack in the heart for him. Yet, why he was not there, I could not  suppose, save that he might have been called back to the Court.    And, surely, as I watched the other young men about her, I burned with a  fierce and miserable jealousy of them; so that I could near have stept  forth and plucked her out from among them, and had her to walk with me  in the woods, as in the olden days, when she also had seemed near to  love. But, truly, what use to this? For it was not they who held her  heart, as I saw plain; for I watched her, with an eager and lonesome  heart, and knew that it was one small man of the Court that was lover to  her, as I have told.    And I went away again then, and came not near to the gap for three great  months, because that I could not bear the pain of my loss; but in the  end of that time, my very pain to urge me to go, and to be worse than  the pain of not going; so that I found myself one evening in the gap,  peering, very eager and shaken, across the sward that lay between the  gap and the woods; for this same place to be as an holy ground to me;  for there was it that first I saw Mirdath the Beautiful, and surely lost  my heart to her in that one night.    And a great time I stayed there in the gap, waiting and watching  hopelessly. And lo! sudden there came something against me, touching my  thigh very soft; and when I looked down, it was one of the boar-hounds,  so that my heart leaped, near frightened; for truly My Lady was come  somewhere nigh, as I did think.    And, as I waited, very hushed and watchful; yet with an utter beating  heart; surely I heard a faint and low singing among the trees, so utter  sad. And lo! it was Mirdath singing a broken love song, and a-wander  there in the dark alone, save for her great dogs.    And I harked, with strange pain in me, that she did be so in pain; and I  ached to bring her ease; yet moved not, but was very still there in the  gap; save that my being was all in turmoil.    And presently, as I harked, there came a slim white figure out from  among the trees; and the figure cried out something, and came to a quick  pause, as I could see in the half-dark. And lo! in that moment, there  came a sudden and unreasoned hope into me; and I came up out of the gap,  and was come to Mirdath in a moment, calling very low and passionate and  eager: \"Mirdath! Mirdath! Mirdath!\"    And this way I came to her; and her great dog that was with me, to bound  beside me, in thought, mayhap, that it was some game. And when I came to  the Lady Mirdath, I held out my hands to her, not knowing what I did;  but only the telling of my heart that needed her so utter, and craved to  ease her of her pain. And lo! she put out her arms to me, and came into  mine arms with a little run. And there she bode, weeping strangely; but  yet with rest upon her; even as rest was come sudden and wondrous upon  me.    And sudden, she moved in mine arms, and slipt her hands to me, very  dear, and held her lips up to me, like some sweet child, that I kiss  her; but, indeed, she was also a true woman, and in honest and dear love  of me.    And this to be the way of our betrothal; and simple and wordless it was;  yet sufficient, only that there is no sufficiency in Love.    Now, presently, she loosed herself out of mine arms, and we walked  homeward through the woods, very quiet, and holding hands, as children  do. And I then in a while to ask her about the man of the Court; and she  laughed very sweet into the silence of the wood; but gave me no answer,  save that I wait until we were come to the Hall.    And when we were come there, she took me into the great hall, and made a  very dainty and impudent bow, mocking me. And so made me known to  another lady, who sat there, upon her task of embroidering, which she  did very demure, and as that she had also a dainty Mischief lurking in  her.    And truly, the Lady Mirdath never to be done of naughty laughter, that  made her dearly breathless with delight, and to sway a little, and set  the trembling of pretty sounds in her throat; and surely she must pull  down two great pistols from an arm-rack, that I fight a duel to the  death with the lady of the embroidering, who held her face down over her  work, and shook likewise with the wickedness of her laughter that she  could not hide.    And in the end, the Lady of the Embroidering looked up sudden into my  face; and I then to see somewhat of the mischief in a moment; for she  had the face of the man of the Court suit, that had been lover to  Mirdath.    And the Lady Mirdath then to explain to me how that Mistress Alison  (which was her name) was a dear and bosom friend, and she it was that  had been drest in the Court suit to play a prank for a wager with a  certain young man who would be lover to her, an he might. And I then to  come along, and so speedy to offence that truly I never saw her face  plain, because that I was so utter jealous. And so the Lady Mirdath had  been more justly in anger than I supposed, because that I had put hands  upon her friend, as I have told.    And this to be all of it, save that they had planned to punish me, and  had met every evening at the gap, to play at lovers, perchance I should  pass, so that I should have greater cause for my jealousy, and truly  they to have a good revenge upon me; for I had suffered very great a  long while because of it.    Yet, as you do mind, when I came upon them, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10671"],[0,"The Botanic Garden. Part II. (#3)"],[1," storge to preserve  its offspring? See note on Ilex, and Gloriosa.    In the Meadia, the Borago, Cyclamen, Solanum, and many others, the  filaments are very short compared with the slyle. Hence it became  necessary, 1st. to furnish the stamens with long anthers. 2d. To lengthen  and bend the peduncle or flower-slalk, that the  flower might hang  downwards. 3d. To reflect the petals. 4th. To erect these peduncles when  the germ was fecundated. We may reason upon this by observing, that all  this apparatus might have been spared, if the filaments alone had grown  longer; and that thence in these flowers that the filaments are the most  unchangeable parts; and that thence their comparative length, in respect  to the style, would afford a most permanent mark of their generic  character.]    [Illustration: Meadia]      65    Woo'd with long care, CURCUMA cold and shy          Meets her fond husband with averted eye:          _Four_ beardless youths the obdurate beauty move          With soft attentions of Platonic love.

[_Curcuma_. l. 65. Turmeric. One male and one female inhabit this  flower; but there are besides four imperfect males, or filaments without  anthers upon them, called by Linneus eunuchs. The flax of our country  has ten filaments, and but five of them are terminated with anthers;  the Portugal flax has ten perfect males, or stamens; the Verbena of our  country has four males; that of Sweden has but two; the genus Albuca, the  Bignonia Catalpa, Gratiola, and hemlock-leaved Geranium have only half  their filaments crowned with anthers. In like manner the florets, which  form the rays of the flowers of the order frustraneous polygamy of the  class syngenesia, or confederate males, as the sun-flower, are furnished  with a style only, and no stigma: and are thence barren. There is also  a style without a stigma in the whole order dioecia gynandria; the male  flowers of which are thence barren. The Opulus is another plant, which  contains some unprolific flowers. In like manner some tribes of insects  have males, females, and neuters among them: as bees, wasps, ants.    There is a curious circumstance belonging to the class of insects which  have two wings, or diptera, analogous to the rudiments of stamens above  described; viz. two little knobs are found placed each on a stalk or  peduncle, generally under a little arched scale; which appear to be  rudiments of hinder wings; and are called by Linneus, halteres, or  poisers, a term of his introduction. A.T. Bladh. Amaen. Acad. V. 7. Other  animals have marks of having in a long process of time undergone  changes in some parts of their bodies, which may have been effected to  accommodate them to new ways of procuring their food. The existence of  teats on the breasts of male animals, and which are generally replete with  a thin kind of milk at their nativity, is a wonderful instance of this  kind. Perhaps all the productions of nature are in their progress to  greater perfection? an idea countenanced by the modern discoveries and  deductions concerning the progressive formation of the solid parts of the  terraqueous globe, and consonant to the dignity of the Creator of all  things.]    [_Alcea_, l. 69. Flore pleno. Double hollyhock. The double flowers,  so much admired by the florists, are termed by the botanist vegetable  monsters; in some of these the petals are multiplied three or four times,  but without excluding the stamens, hence they produce some seeds, as  Campanula and Stramoneum; but in others the petals become so numerous as  totally to exclude the stamens, or males; as Caltha, Peonia, and Alcea;  these produce no seeds, and are termed eunuchs. Philos. Botan. No. 150.    These vegetable monsters are formed in many ways. 1st. By the  multiplication of the petals and the exclusion of the nectaries, as in  larkspur. 2d. By the multiplication of the nectaries and exclusion of  the petals; as in columbine. 3d. In some flowers growing in cymes, the  wheel-shape flowers in the margin are multiplied to the exclusion of  the bell-shape flowers in the centre; as in gelder-rose. 4th. By the  elongation of the florets in the centre. Instances of both these are  found in daisy and feverfew; for other kinds of vegetable monsters, see  Plantago.    The perianth is not changed in double flowers, hence the genus or family  may be often discovered by the calyx, as in Hepatica, Ranunculus, Alcea.  In those flowers, which have many petals, the lowest series of the petals  remains unchanged in respect to number; hence the natural number of the  petals is easily discovered. As in poppies, roses, and Nigella, or devil  in a bulb. Phil. Bot. p. 128.]    [_Iris_. l. 71. Flower de Luce. Three males, one female. Some of the  species have a beautifully freckled flower; the large stigma or head  of the female covers the three males, counterfeiting a petal with its  divisions.]    [_Cupressus_. l. 73. Cypress. One House. The males live in separate  flowers, but on the same plant. The males of some of these plants, which  are in separate flowers from the females, have an elastic membrane; which  disperses their dust to a considerable distance, when the anthers burst  open. This dust, on a fine day, may often be seen like a cloud hanging  round the common nettle. The males and females of all the cone-bearing  plants are in separate flowers, either on the same or on different  plants; they produce resins, and many of them are supposed to supply the  most durable timber: what is called Venice-turpentine is obtained from  the larch by wounding the bark about two feet from the ground, and  catching it as it exsudes; Sandarach is procured from common juniper; and  Incense from a juniper with yellow fruit. The unperishable chests, which  contain the Egyptian mummies, were of Cypress; and the Cedar, with which  black-lead pencils are covered, is not liable to be eaten by worms. See  Miln's Bot. Dict. art. coniferae. The gates of St. Peter's church at  Rome, which had lasted from the time of Constantine to that of Pope  Eugene the fourth, that is to say eleven hundred years, were of Cypress,  and had in that time suffered no decay. According to Thucydides, the  Athenians buried the bodies of their heroes in coffins of Cypress, as  being not subject to decay. A similar durability has also been ascribed  to Cedar. Thus Horace,                             _----speramus carmina fingi          Posse linenda cedre, & lavi servanda cupresso._    [_Osyris_. l. 75. Two houses. The males and females are on different  plants. There are many instances on record, where female plants have been  impregnated at very great distance from their male; the dust discharged  from the anthers is very light, small, and copious, so that it may spread  very wide in the atmosphere, and be carried to the distant pistils,  without the supposition of any particular attraction; these plants  resemble some insects, as the ants, and cochineal insect, of which the  males have wings, but not the female.]              With strange deformity PLANTAGO treads,          A Monster-birth! and lifts his hundred heads;          Yet with soft love a gentle belle he charms,  80    And clasps the beauty in his hundred arms.          So hapless DESDEMONA, fair and young,          Won by OTHELLO'S captivating tongue,          Sigh'd o'er each strange and piteous tale, distress'd,          And sunk enamour'd on his sooty breast.    85    _Two_ gentle shepherds and their sister-wives          With thee, ANTHOXA! lead ambrosial lives;      [_Plantago_. l. 77. Rosea. Rose Plantain. In this vegetable monster the  bractes, or divisions of the spike, become wonderfully enlarged; and are  converted into leaves. The chaffy scales of the calyx in Xeranthemum, and  in a species of Dianthus, and the glume in some alpine grasses, and the  scales of the ament in the salix rosea, rose willow, grow into leaves;  and produce other kinds of monsters. The double flowers become monsters  by the multiplication of their petals or nectaries. See note on Alcea.    [_Anthoxanthum_. l. 83. Vernal grass. Two males, two females. The other  grasses have three males and two females. The flowers of this grass give  the fragrant scent to hay. I am informed it is frequently viviparous,  that is, that it bears sometimes roots or bulbs instead of seeds, which  after a time drop off and strike root into the ground. This circumstance  is said to obtain in many of the alpine grasses, whose seeds are  perpetually devoured by small birds. The Festuca Dometorum, fescue grass  of the bushes, produces bulbs from the sheaths of its straw. The Allium  Magicum, or magical onion, produces onions on its head, instead of seeds.  The Polygonum Viviparum, viviparous bistort, rises about a foot high,  with a beautiful spike of flowers, which are succeeded by buds or bulbs,  which fall off and take root. There is a bulb, frequently seen on  birch-trees, like a bird's nest, which seems to be a similar attempt of  nature, to produce another tree; which falling off might take root in  spongy ground.    There is an instance of this double mode of production in the animal  kingdom, which is equally extraordinary: the same species of Aphis is  viviparous in summer, and oviparous in autumn. A. T.
