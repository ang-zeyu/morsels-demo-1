Each man wore a close fitting cap of black, decked  with a curling white feather. For arms, they carried simply a stout bow,  a sheaf of new arrows, and a short hunting-knife.    When the little party came before the dais on which the King and Queen  sat, the yeomen doffed their caps humbly, while Maid Marian was assisted  to dismount.    \"Your Gracious Majesty,\" she said, addressing the Queen, \"these be the  men for whom you sent me, and who are now come to wear your colors and  service you in the tourney.\"    The Queen leaned forward and handed them each a scarf of green and gold.    \"Lockesley,\" she said in a clear voice, \"I thank thee and thy men for  this service. Know that I have laid a wager with the King that ye can  outshoot the best five whom he has found in all his bowmen.\" The five  men pressed the scarfs to their lips in token of fealty.    The King turned to the Queen inquiringly.    \"Who are these men you have brought before us?\" asked he.    Up came the worthy Bishop of Hereford, growing red and pale by turns.    \"Your pardon, my liege lord!\" cried he; \"But I must denounce these  fellows as outlaws. Yon man in scarlet is none other than Robin Hood  himself. The others are Little John and Will Stutely and Will Scarlet  and Allan-a-Dale--all famous in the North Countree for their deeds of  violence.\"    \"As my lord Bishop personally knows!\" added the Queen significantly.    The King's brows grew dark. The name of Robin Hood was well known to  him, as to every man there present.    \"Is this true?\" he demanded sternly.    \"Aye, my lord,\" responded the Queen demurely. \"But, bethink you--I have  your royal promise of grace and amnesty.\"    \"That will I keep,\" said the King, holding in check his ire by a mighty  effort. \"But, look you! Only forty days do I grant of respite. When this  time has elapsed, let these bold outlaws look to their safety!\"    Then turning to his five victorious archers, who had drawn near, he  added, \"Ye have heard, my men, how that I have a wager with the Queen  upon your prowess. Now here be men of her choosing--certain free shafts  of Sherwood and Barnesdale. Wherefore look well to it, Gilbert and Tepus  and Geoffrey and Elwyn and Clifton! If ye outshoot these knaves, I will  fill your caps with silver pennies--aye, and knight the man who stands  first. But if ye lose, I give the prizes, for which ye have just  striven, to Robin Hood and his men, according to my royal word.\"    \"Robin Hood and his men!\" the saying flew round the arena with the speed  of wild-fire, and every neck craned forward to see the famous fellows  who had dared to brave the King's anger, because of the Queen.    Another target was now set up, at the same distance as the last, and  it was decided that the ten archers should shoot three arrows in turn.  Gilbert and Robin tossed up a penny for the lead, and it fell to the  King's men. So Clifton was bidden to shoot first.    Forth he stood, planting his feet firmly, and wetting his fingers before  plucking the string. For he was resolved to better his losing score of  that day. And in truth he did so, for the shaft he loosed sped true, and  landed on the black bull's-eye, though not in the exact center. Again he  shot, and again he hit the black, on the opposite rim. The third shaft  swerved downward and came within the second ring, some two fingers'  breadths away. Nathless, a general cry went up, as this was the best  shooting Clifton had done that day.    Will Scarlet was chosen to follow him, and now took his place and  carefully chose three round and full-feathered arrows.    \"Careful, my sweet coz!\" quoth Robin in a low tone. \"The knave has left  wide space at the center for all of your darts.\"    But Robin gave Will the wrong caution, for over-much care spoiled  his aim. His first shaft flew wide and lodged in the second ring even  further away than the worst shot of Clifton.    \"Your pardon, coz!\" quoth Robin hastily. \"Bid care go to the bottom of  the sea, and do you loose your string before it sticks to your fingers!\"    And Will profited by this hint, and loosed his next two shafts as  freely as though they flew along a Sherwood glade. Each struck upon the  bull's-eye, and one even nearer the center than his rival's mark. Yet  the total score was adjudged in favor of Clifton. At this Will Scarlet  bit his lip, but said no word, while the crowd shouted and waved yellow  flags for very joy that the King's man had overcome the outlaw. They  knew, also, that this demonstration would please the King.    The target was now cleared for the next two contestants--Geoffrey and  Allan-a-Dale. Whereat, it was noticed that many ladies in the Queen's  booths boldly flaunted Allan's colors, much to the honest pride which  glowed in the cheeks of one who sat in their midst.    \"In good truth,\" said more than one lady to Mistress Dale, \"if thy  husband can handle the longbow as skilfully as the harp, his rival has  little show of winning!\"    The saying augured well. Geoffrey had shot many good shafts that day;  and indeed had risen from the ranks by virtue of them. But now each of  his three shots, though well placed in triangular fashion around the rim  of the bull's-eye, yet allowed an easy space for Allan to graze within.  His shooting, moreover, was so prettily done, that he was right heartily  applauded--the ladies and their gallants leading in the hand-clapping.    Now you must know that there had long been a friendly rivalry in Robin  Hood's band as to who was the best shot, next after Robin himself. He  and Will Stutely had lately decided their marksmanship, and Will had  found that Robin's skill was now so great as to place the leader at the  head of all good bowmen in the forest. But the second place lay between  Little John and Stutely, and neither wished to yield to the other. So  to-day they looked narrowly at their leader to see who should shoot  third. Robin read their faces at a glance, and laughing merrily, broke  off two straws and held them out.    \"The long straw goes next!\" he decided; and it fell to Stutely.    Elwyn the Welshman was to precede him; and his score was no whit better  than Geoffrey's. But Stutely failed to profit by it. His besetting sin  at archery had ever been an undue haste and carelessness. To-day these  were increased by a certain moodiness, that Little John had outranked  him. So his first two shafts flew swiftly, one after the other, to  lodging places outside the Welshman's mark.    \"Man! man!\" cried Robin entreatingly, \"you do forget the honor of the  Queen, and the credit of Sherwood!\"    \"I ask your pardon, master!\" quoth Will humbly enough, and loosing as he  spoke his last shaft. It whistled down the course unerringly and struck  in the exact center--the best shot yet made.    Now some shouted for Stutely and some shouted for Elwyn; but Elwyn's  total mark was declared the better. Whereupon the King turned to the  Queen. \"What say you now?\" quoth he in some triumph. \"Two out of the  three first rounds have gone to my men. Your outlaws will have to shoot  better than that in order to save your wager!\"    The Queen smiled gently.    \"Yea, my lord,\" she said. \"But the twain who are left are able to do the  shooting. You forget that I still have Little John and Robin Hood.\"    \"And you forget, my lady, that I still have Tepus and Gilbert.\"    So each turned again to the lists and awaited the next rounds in silent  eagerness. I ween that King Harry had never watched the invasion of an  enemy with more anxiety than he now felt.    Tepus was chosen to go next and he fell into the same error with Will  Scarlet. He held the string a moment too long, and both his first and  second arrows came to grief. One of them, however, came within the black  rim, and he followed it up by placing his third in the full center,  just as Stutely had done in his last. These two centers were the fairest  shots that had been made that day; and loud was the applause which  greeted this second one. But the shouting was as nothing to the uproar  which followed Little John's shooting. That good-natured giant seemed  determined to outdo Tepus by a tiny margin in each separate shot; for  the first and the second shafts grazed his rival's on the inner side,  while for the third Little John did the old trick of the forest: he  shot his own arrow in a graceful curve which descended from above upon  Tepus's final center shaft with a glancing blow that drove the other out  and left the outlaw's in its place.    The King could scarce believe his eyes. \"By my halidom!\" quoth he, \"that  fellow deserves either a dukedom or a hanging! He must be in league with  Satan himself! Never saw I such shooting.\"    \"The score is tied, my lord,\" said the Queen; \"we have still to see  Gilbert and Robin Hood.\"    Gilbert now took his stand and slowly shot his arrows, one after  another, into the bull's-eye. 'Twas the best shooting he had yet  done, but there was still the smallest of spaces left--if you looked  closely--at the very center.    \"Well done, Gilbert!\" spoke up Robin Hood. \"You are a foeman worthy of  being shot against.\" He took his own place as he spoke. \"Now if you had  placed one of your shafts _there_\"--loosing one of his own--\"and another  _there_\"--out sped the second--\"and another _there_\"--the third was  launched--\"mayhap the King would have declared you the best bowman in  all England!\"    But the last part of his merry speech was drowned in the wild tumult  of applause which followed his exploit. His first two shafts had packed  themselves into the small space left at the bull's-eye; while his third  had split down between them, taking half of each, and making all three  appear from a distance, as one immense arrow.    Up rose the King in amazement and anger.    \"Gilbert is not yet beaten!\" he cried. \"Did he not shoot within the mark  thrice?

'Yes,' said Cyril, 'and precious pleased those Jevonses would be to see  us and our traps.'    Aunt Emma, indeed, was staying with some Jevonses--very prim people.  They were middle-aged and wore very smart blouses, and they were fond of  matinees and shopping, and they did not care about children.    'I know MOTHER would be pleased to see us if we went back,' said Jane.    'Yes, she would, but she'd think it was not right to show she was  pleased, because it's Bob's fault we're not met. Don't I know the sort  of thing?' said Cyril. 'Besides, we've no tin. No; we've got enough for  a growler among us, but not enough for tickets to the New Forest. We  must just go home. They won't be so savage when they find we've really  got home all right. You know auntie was only going to take us home in a  cab.'    'I believe we ought to go to Croydon,' Anthea insisted.    'Aunt Emma would be out to a dead cert,' said Robert. 'Those Jevonses go  to the theatre every afternoon, I believe. Besides, there's the Phoenix  at home, AND the carpet. I votes we call a four-wheeled cabman.'    A four-wheeled cabman was called--his cab was one of the old-fashioned  kind with straw in the bottom--and he was asked by Anthea to drive them  very carefully to their address. This he did, and the price he asked  for doing so was exactly the value of the gold coin grandpapa had given  Cyril for Christmas. This cast a gloom; but Cyril would never have  stooped to argue about a cab-fare, for fear the cabman should think he  was not accustomed to take cabs whenever he wanted them. For a reason  that was something like this he told the cabman to put the luggage  on the steps, and waited till the wheels of the growler had grittily  retired before he rang the bell.    'You see,' he said, with his hand on the handle, 'we don't want cook  and Eliza asking us before HIM how it is we've come home alone, as if we  were babies.'    Here he rang the bell; and the moment its answering clang was heard,  every one felt that it would be some time before that bell was answered.  The sound of a bell is quite different, somehow, when there is anyone  inside the house who hears it. I can't tell you why that is--but so it  is.    'I expect they're changing their dresses,' said Jane.    'Too late,' said Anthea, 'it must be past five. I expect Eliza's gone to  post a letter, and cook's gone to see the time.'    Cyril rang again. And the bell did its best to inform the listening  children that there was really no one human in the house. They rang  again and listened intently. The hearts of all sank low. It is a  terrible thing to be locked out of your own house, on a dark, muggy  January evening.    'There is no gas on anywhere,' said Jane, in a broken voice.    'I expect they've left the gas on once too often, and the draught blew  it out, and they're suffocated in their beds. Father always said they  would some day,' said Robert cheerfully.    'Let's go and fetch a policeman,' said Anthea, trembling.    'And be taken up for trying to be burglars--no, thank you,' said Cyril.  'I heard father read out of the paper about a young man who got into his  own mother's house, and they got him made a burglar only the other day.'    'I only hope the gas hasn't hurt the Phoenix,' said Anthea. 'It said it  wanted to stay in the bathroom cupboard, and I thought it would be all  right, because the servants never clean that out. But if it's gone and  got out and been choked by gas--And besides, directly we open the door  we shall be choked, too. I KNEW we ought to have gone to Aunt Emma, at  Croydon. Oh, Squirrel, I wish we had. Let's go NOW.'    'Shut up,' said her brother, briefly. 'There's some one rattling the  latch inside.' Every one listened with all its ears, and every one stood  back as far from the door as the steps would allow.    The latch rattled, and clicked. Then the flap of the letter-box lifted  itself--every one saw it by the flickering light of the gas-lamp that  shone through the leafless lime-tree by the gate--a golden eye seemed to  wink at them through the letter-slit, and a cautious beak whispered--    'Are you alone?'    'It's the Phoenix,' said every one, in a voice so joyous, and so full of  relief, as to be a sort of whispered shout.    'Hush!' said the voice from the letter-box slit. 'Your slaves have gone  a-merry-making. The latch of this portal is too stiff for my beak.  But at the side--the little window above the shelf whereon your bread  lies--it is not fastened.'    'Righto!' said Cyril.    And Anthea added, 'I wish you'd meet us there, dear Phoenix.'    The children crept round to the pantry window. It is at the side of the  house, and there is a green gate labelled 'Tradesmen's Entrance', which  is always kept bolted. But if you get one foot on the fence between you  and next door, and one on the handle of the gate, you are over before  you know where you are. This, at least, was the experience of Cyril and  Robert, and even, if the truth must be told, of Anthea and Jane. So in  almost no time all four were in the narrow gravelled passage that runs  between that house and the next.    Then Robert made a back, and Cyril hoisted himself up and got his  knicker-bockered knee on the concrete window-sill. He dived into the  pantry head first, as one dives into water, and his legs waved in the  air as he went, just as your legs do when you are first beginning  to learn to dive. The soles of his boots--squarish muddy  patches--disappeared.    'Give me a leg up,' said Robert to his sisters.    'No, you don't,' said Jane firmly. 'I'm not going to be left outside  here with just Anthea, and have something creep up behind us out of the  dark. Squirrel can go and open the back door.'    A light had sprung awake in the pantry. Cyril always said the Phoenix  turned the gas on with its beak, and lighted it with a waft of its wing;  but he was excited at the time, and perhaps he really did it himself  with matches, and then forgot all about it. He let the others in by the  back door. And when it had been bolted again the children went all over  the house and lighted every single gas-jet they could find. For they  couldn't help feeling that this was just the dark dreary winter's  evening when an armed burglar might easily be expected to appear at any  moment. There is nothing like light when you are afraid of burglars--or  of anything else, for that matter.    And when all the gas-jets were lighted it was quite clear that the  Phoenix had made no mistake, and that Eliza and cook were really out,  and that there was no one in the house except the four children, and the  Phoenix, and the carpet, and the blackbeetles who lived in the cupboards  on each side of the nursery fire-place. These last were very pleased  that the children had come home again, especially when Anthea had  lighted the nursery fire. But, as usual, the children treated the loving  little blackbeetles with coldness and disdain.    I wonder whether you know how to light a fire? I don't mean how to  strike a match and set fire to the corners of the paper in a fire  someone has laid ready, but how to lay and light a fire all by yourself.  I will tell you how Anthea did it, and if ever you have to light one  yourself you may remember how it is done. First, she raked out the ashes  of the fire that had burned there a week ago--for Eliza had actually  never done this, though she had had plenty of time. In doing this Anthea  knocked her knuckle and made it bleed. Then she laid the largest and  handsomest cinders in the bottom of the grate. Then she took a sheet  of old newspaper (you ought never to light a fire with to-day's  newspaper--it will not burn well, and there are other reasons against  it), and tore it into four quarters, and screwed each of these into a  loose ball, and put them on the cinders; then she got a bundle of wood  and broke the string, and stuck the sticks in so that their front ends  rested on the bars, and the back ends on the back of the paper balls.  In doing this she cut her finger slightly with the string, and when she  broke it, two of the sticks jumped up and hit her on the cheek. Then she  put more cinders and some bits of coal--no dust. She put most of that  on her hands, but there seemed to be enough left for her face. Then  she lighted the edges of the paper balls, and waited till she heard the  fizz-crack-crack-fizz of the wood as it began to burn. Then she went and  washed her hands and face under the tap in the back kitchen.    Of course, you need not bark your knuckles, or cut your finger, or  bruise your cheek with wood, or black yourself all over; but otherwise,  this is a very good way to light a fire in London. In the real country  fires are lighted in a different and prettier way.    But it is always good to wash your hands and face afterwards, wherever  you are.    While Anthea was delighting the poor little blackbeetles with the  cheerful blaze, Jane had set the table for--I was going to say tea, but  the meal of which I am speaking was not exactly tea. Let us call it a  tea-ish meal. There was tea, certainly, for Anthea's fire blazed and  crackled so kindly that it really seemed to be affectionately inviting  the kettle to come and sit upon its lap. So the kettle was brought and  tea made. But no milk could be found--so every one had six lumps of  sugar to each cup instead. The things to eat, on the other hand, were  nicer than usual. The boys looked about very carefully, and found in  the pantry some cold tongue, bread, butter, cheese, and part of a cold  pudding--very much nicer than cook ever made when they were at home. And  in the kitchen cupboard was half a Christmassy cake, a pot of strawberry  jam, and about a pound of mixed candied fruit, with soft crumbly slabs  of delicious sugar in each cup of lemon, orange, or citron.    It was indeed, as Jane said, 'a banquet fit for"]]]
