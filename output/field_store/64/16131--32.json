Of the _prose_ articles, we have already given some specimens--The Hour  Too Many, a fortnight since; and Vicenza, just quoted. The next we  notice is Recollections of Pere la Chaise, for the graphic accuracy of  which we can answer; Eliza Carthago, an African anecdote, by Mrs.  Bowditch; Terence O'Flaherty, a humorous story, by the Modern  Pythagorean of Blackwood; two interesting stories of Modern Greece; a  highly-wrought Persian Tale, by the late Henry Neele; Miss Mitford's  charming Cricketing Sketch; the Maid of the Beryl, by Mrs. Hofland; a  Chapter of Eastern Apologues, by the Ettrick Shepherd; the Goldsmith of  Westcheap, a story of the olden time--rather too long; and a  characteristic Naval Sketch.    As we have already drawn somewhat freely on the present volume, we may  adduce that as the best proof of the high opinion we entertain of its  merits. The editor has only two or three pieces; but the excellent taste  and judgment displayed in the editorship of the \"Forget-me-not\" entitle  it to a foremost place among the \"Annuals for 1829.\"           *       *       *       *       *          The Literary Souvenir,    _Edited by Alaric A. Watts, Esq_.      If the present were the first volume of the Literary Souvenir, the name  of the editor would be a passport to popularity; but as this is the  fifth year of its publication, any recommendation of ours would be  supererogatory.    But the Souvenir for 1829, realizes that delightful union of painting,  engraving, and literature, (at whose beneficial influence we have  glanced in our accompanying number) even more fully than its  predecessors. Ten out of the twelve embellishments are from celebrated  pictures, and the whole are by first-rate engravers. Of their cost we  spoke cursorily in a recent number; so that we shall only particularize  a few of the most striking.    The engravings are of larger size than heretofore, and, for the most  part, more brilliant in design and execution than any previous year.  We can only notice _the Sisters_, (frontispiece) full of graceful and  pleasing effect, by J.H. Robinson, after Stephanoff; _Cleopatra, on the  Cydnus_, a splendid aquatic pageant, by E. Goodall, after Danby; the  _Proposal_, consisting of two of the most striking figures in Leslie's  exquisite painting of May Day in Queen Elizabeth's time; a _Portrait of  Sir Walter Scott_, from Leslie's painting, and considered the best  likeness; this is from the burin of an American artist of high promise.  We must not, however, forget _Ehrenbreitstein, on the Rhine_, by John  Pye, from a drawing by J.M.W. Turner, which is one of the most  delightful prints in the whole series.    In the _poetry_ are Cleopatra, well according with the splendid scene it  is intended to illustrate--and I think of Thee, a tender lament--both by  Mr. T.K. Hervey; Mrs. Hemans has contributed four exquisite pieces:  Night, the Ship at Sea, and the Mariner's Grave, by Mr. John Malcolm,  only make us regret that we have not room for either in our columns;  Mary Queen of Scots, by H.G. Bell, Esq., is one of the most interesting  historical ballads we have lately met with; the Epistle from Abbotsford,  is a piece of pleasantry, which would have formed an excellent pendent  to Sir Walter's Study, in our last; Zadig and Astarte, by Delta, are in  the writer's most plaintive strain; the recollections of our happiest  years, are harmoniously told in \"Boyhood;\" a ballad entitled \"The  Captive of Alhama,\" dated from Woburn Abbey, and signed R----, is a  soul-stirring production, attributed to Lord John Russel; and the Pixies  of Devon has the masterly impress of the author of Dartmoor. And last in  our enumeration, though first in our liking, are the following by the  editor:--Invocation to the Echo of a Sea Shell; King Pedro's Revenge,  with a well written historiette; the Youngling of the Flock, full of  tenderness and parental affection; and some Stanzas, for our admiration  of which we have not an epithet at hand, so we give the original.        ON BURNING A PACKET OF LETTERS.    _By A.A. Watts, Esq._      Relics of love, and life's enchanted spring,    Of hopes born, rainbow-like, of smiles and tears:--  With trembling hand do I unloose the string,    Twined round the records of my youthful years.    Yet why preserve memorials of a dream,    Too bitter-sweet to breathe of aught but pain!  Why court fond memory for a fitful gleam    Of faded bliss, that cannot bloom again!    The thoughts and feelings these sad relics bring    Back on my heart, I would not now recall:--  Since gentler ties around its pulses cling,    Shall spells less hallowed hold them still in thrall!    Can withered hopes that never came to flower    Match with affections long and dearly tried  Love, that has lived through many a stormy hour,    Through good and ill,--and time and change defied!    Perish each record that might wake a thought    That would be treason to a faith like this!--  Why should the spectres of past joys be brought    To fling their shadows o'er my present bliss!    Yet,--ere we part for ever,--let me pay    A last, fond tribute to the sainted dead:  Mourn o'er these wrecks of passion's earlier day,    With tears as wild as once I used to shed.    What gentle words are flashing on my eye!    What tender truths in every line I trace!  Confessions--penned with many a deep drawn sigh.--    Hopes--like the dove--with but one resting place!    How many a feeling, long--too long--represt,    Like autumn flowers, here opened out at last!  How many a vision of the lonely breast    Its cherish'd radiance on these leaves hath cast?    And ye, pale violets, whose sweet breath hath driven    Back on my soul the dreams I fain would quell;  To whose faint perfume such wild power is given,    To call up visions--only loved too well;--    Ye too must perish!--Wherefore now divide    Tributes of love--first offerings of the heart;--  Gifts--that so long have slumbered side by side;    Tokens of feeling--never meant to part!    A long farewell:--sweet flowers, sad scrolls, adieu!    Yes, ye shall be companions to the last:--  So perish all that would revive anew    The fruitless memories of the faded past!    But, lo! the flames are curling swiftly round    Each fairer vestige of my youthful years;  Page after page that searching blaze hath found,    Even whilst I strive to trace them through my tears.    The Hindoo widow, in affection strong,    Dies by her lord, and keeps her faith unbroken;  Thus perish all which to those wrecks belong,    The living memory--with the lifeless token!      Barry Cornwall has contributed several minor pieces, though we fear his  poetical reputation will not be increased by either of them.    Some of the minor pieces are gems in their way, and one of the most  beautiful will be found appended to our current Number.    To the _prose_:--The first in the volume is \"the Sisters,\" a pathetic  tale of about thirty pages, which a little of the fashionable  affectation of some literary coxcombs might fine-draw over a brace of  small octavos. As it stands, the story is gracefully, yet energetically  told, and is entitled to the place it occupies. The author of Pelham  (_vide_ the newspapers) has a pleasant conceit in the shape of a  whole-length of fashion, which, being the best and shortest in its line  that we have met with, will serve to enliven our extracts:--      TOO HANDSOME FOR ANY THING!      Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy was one of those models of perfection of which  a human father and mother can produce but a single example,--Mr.  Ferdinand Fitzroy was therefore an only son. He was such an amazing  favourite with both his parents that they resolved to ruin him;  accordingly, he was exceedingly spoiled, never annoyed by the sight of  a book, and had as much plum-cake as he could eat. Happy would it have  been for Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy could he always have eaten plum-cake, and  remained a child. \"Never,\" says the Greek Tragedian, \"reckon a mortal  happy till you have witnessed his end.\" A most beautiful creature was  Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy! Such eyes--such hair--such teeth--such a  figure--such manners, too,--and such an irresistible way of tying his  neckcloth! When he was about sixteen, a crabbed old uncle represented to  his parents the propriety of teaching Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy to read and  write. Though not without some difficulty, he convinced them,--for he  was exceedingly rich, and riches in an uncle are wonderful arguments  respecting the nurture of a nephew whose parents have nothing to leave  him. So our hero was sent to school. He was naturally (I am not joking  now) a very sharp, clever boy; and he came on surprisingly in his  learning. The schoolmaster's wife liked handsome children.--\"What a  genius will Master Ferdinand Fitzroy be, if you take pains with him!\"  said she, to her husband.    \"Pooh, my dear, it is of no use to take pains with _him_.\"    \"And why, love?\"    \"Because he is a great deal too handsome ever to be a scholar.\"    \"And that's true enough, my dear!\" said the schoolmaster's wife.    So, because he was too handsome to be a scholar, Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy  remained the lag of the fourth form!    They took our hero from school.--\"What profession shall he follow?\" said  his mother.    \"My first cousin is the Lord Chancellor,\" said his father, \"let him go  to the bar.\"    The Lord Chancellor dined there that day: Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy was  introduced to him; his lordship was a little, rough-faced,  beetle-browed, hard-featured man, who thought beauty and idleness the  same thing--and a parchment skin the legitimate complexion for a lawyer.    \"Send him to the bar!\" said he, \"no, no, that will never do!--Send him  into the army; he is much too handsome to become a lawyer.\"    \"And that's true enough, my lord!\" said the mother. So they bought Mr.  Ferdinand Fitzroy a cornetcy in the ---- regiment of dragoons.

Volume 10, No. 284, (#3)"],[1,"four or five pieces of the leaves  of grass, which they glue together into a shapely polygonal case; others  employ portions of the stems of rushes, placed side by side, so as to form  an elegant fluted cylinder; some arrange round them pieces of leaves like  a spirally-rolled riband; other species construct houses which may be  called alive, forming them of the shells of various aquatic snails of  different kinds and sizes, even while inhabited, all of which are  immovably fixed to them, and dragged about at pleasure. However various  may be the form of the case externally, within it is usually cylindrical  and lined with silk.\"--_Introduction to Entomology, by Kirby and Spence._      _Engraving on Glass._    Cover one side of a flat piece of glass, after having made it perfectly  clean, with bees' wax, and trace figures upon it with a needle, taking  care that every stroke cuts completely through the wax. Next, make a  border of wax all round the glass, to prevent any liquor, when poured on,  from running off. Then take some finely powdered fluate of lime (fluor  spar,) strew it even over the glass plate upon the waxed side, and then  gently pour upon it, so as not to displace the powder, as much concentrated  sulphuric acid diluted with thrice its weight of water, as is sufficient  to cover the powdered fluor spar. Let every thing remain in this state for  three hours; then remove the mixture, and clean the glass, by washing it  with oil of turpentine; the figures which were traced through the wax will  be found engraven on the glass, while the parts which the wax covered will  be uncorroded. The fluate of lime is decomposed by the sulphuric acid, and  sulphate of lime is formed. The fluoric acid, disengaged in the gaseous  state, combines with the water that diluted the sulphuric acid, and forms  liquid fluoric acid, by which the glass is corroded.      _Habits of Seals._    The brain of this animal, observes Dr. Harwood, is I think, doubtless, of  greater proportionate magnitude than in any other quadruped, and not only  does it exhibit in its countenance, the appearance of sagacity, but its  intelligence is in reality far greater than in most land quadrupeds: hence  its domestication is rendered much easier than that of other animals, and  it is susceptible of more powerful attachment. The large seal, which was  exhibited some time ago at Exeter 'Change, appeared to me to understand  the language of its keeper as perfectly as the most faithful dog. When he  entered at one end of its long apartment, it raised its body from the  water, in which it was injudiciously too constantly kept, supporting itself  erect against the bar of its enclosure, and wherever he moved, keeping its  large, dark eyes steadfastly fixed upon him. When desired to make obeisance  to visitors, it quickly threw itself on one side, and struck the opposite  one several times in quick succession with its fore-foot, producing a loud  noise. The young seal, again, which was kept on board the Alexander, in one  of the northern expeditions, became so much attached to its new mode of  life, that after being thrown into the sea, and it had become tired of  swimming at liberty, it regularly returned to the side of the beat, to be  retaken on board. Such examples might be greatly multiplied; and I cannot  help stating, that aware of this disposition to become familiar, and this  participation in the good qualities of the dog, it is astonishing that  mankind have not chosen this intellectual and finely organized quadruped,  for aquatic services scarcely less important than some of those in which  the dog is employed on the surface of the land.--_Quarterly Journal._      _Gas from Resin._    Mr. Daniel, the meteorologist, has contrived a process for generating gas  from resin; which he effects by dissolving the resin in turpentine, or  any other essential oil, and then allowing the fluid to drop gradually in  a heated cylinder of iron.      _Liquorice Paper._    A mode has been discovered in France of fabricating paper solely from the  Glycyrrhiza Germanica, or liquorice plant. It is said that this paper is  cheap, that it is of a whiteness superior to that generally made, and that  size is not requisite in its manufacture.      _Tachygraphy._    A mathematical instrument maker at Paris, of the name of Conti, has  conceived the notion of a portable instrument which he calls a tachygraph,  by means of which any person may write, or rather print, as fast as any  other person can speak. M. Conti, however, like many other ingenious men,  is not rich; and he has applied to the Academie des Sciences, for pecuniary  assistance, and a very favourable report has been made upon his request.      _Valuable Discovery in Agriculture._    One of the most recent of useful discoveries in agriculture is to mix  layers of green or new cut clover with layers of straw in ricks or stacks;  thus the strength of the clover is absorbed by the straw, which, thus  impregnated, both horses and cattle eat greedily, and the clover is dried  and prevented from heating. This practice is particularly calculated for  second crops of clover and rye-grass.      _Pine Apples._    The largest pine ever grown in this kingdom was cut lately from the  hothouse of John Edwards, Esq. of Rheola, Glamorganshire, and was presented  to his Majesty at Windsor. It weighed 14 lbs. 12 oz. avoirdupois, was  12-1/2 inches high, exclusive of the crown, and 26 inches in circumference.      _Sea Couch for preventing Sickness._    An elastic or swinging seat, couch, or bed, for preventing the uneasy  motions of a ship or a carriage, has recently been invented. To effect  this, the frame of the seat or couch is suspended on juribals or joints,  turning at right angles to each other, and an elasticity is produced both  in the seat or cushion, and in the swinging frames, by the use of spiral  metal springs. These springs are made by twisting steel or iron wire into  the form of an hour glass, that is, like two cones united at their apices.  The lower points of their springs are to be sown to the canvass or webbing,  and their upper parts secured in their proper situations and erect  positions by pack-thread or small cords, tied or braced from one to the  other, crossing like a net. On the tops of these springs the usual covering  of canvass is laid, and then a thin layer of horsehair or wool, upon which  the outer covering is bitted. Sir Richard Phillips, in the _Monthly  Magazine_, describes the following successful experiment for preventing  sea-sickness, made on his crossing from Dover to Calais, a few years  since. He caused an armed chair to be placed on the deck of the vessel,  and being seated in it, he began to raise himself up and down, as on  horseback. The passengers laughed at his eccentricity, but before they  reached Calais, many of them were sea-sick, whilst Sir Richard continued  to enjoy his usual health and vigour.      _Bites of Venomous Reptiles._    M. le D'Record, sen. discovered, during a long residence in America, what  he considers a sure mode of preventing mischief from such bites. \"It is  sufficient,\" he says, \"to pour a few drops of tincture of cantharides on  the wound, to cause a redness and vesiccation; not only is the poison  rendered harmless, but the stings of the reptiles are removed with the  epidermis that the bladder raises.\"--_Med. Journal._      _Naval Schools of France._    In France, the system of mutual instruction among the working classes  prospers in the bosoms of the ports, and schools are founded for the  particular instruction of the sons of the inferior officers of the  arsenals, in the elements of calculation, of geometry, and of design, as  far as necessary for the plans of ships; also the principles of statics,  so as to enable them to judge of the action and effect of machinery. Prizes  of gold medals and special promotions are the rewards of the most deserving  students. Brest was formerly the only port furnished with these schools;  since the peace, however, libraries are forming in each of the others; and  in almost all, cabinets of natural history and botanical gardens are  enriched at every voyage undertaken by French ships, either to foreign  coasts, or to those of the French colonies. An observatory has been given  to Toulon and Rochefort. In both these ports naval museums are formed, in  order to preserve types of the most eminent vessels, whose originals either  have been, or soon will be, destroyed by time. Models of ingenious  machines, representations of interesting manoeuvres, a methodical  collection of raw materials, of tools, and of the product of all the arts  exercised in a dock-yard--Such are the rich materials collected in these  interesting repositories.--_From the French of M. Dupin._      _Antiquity of Locks._    Locks were known in Egypt above four thousand years since, as was inferred  by M. Denon, from some sculptures of the great temple of Karnac,  representing locks similar to those now used in that country. A lock  resembling the Egyptian is used in Cornwall, and the same has been seen in  the Faro Islands; to both which places it was probably taken by the  Phoenicians.--_Quarterly Journal._      _To increase the odour of Roses._    Plant a large onion by the side of the rose-tree in such a manner that it  shall touch the root of the latter. The rose which will be produced will  have an odour much stronger and more agreeable than such as have not been  thus treated; and the water distilled from these roses is equally superior  to that prepared by means of ordinary rose leaves.--_From the French._           *       *       *       *       *          The Selector;    AND LITERARY NOTICES OF _NEW WORKS_.           *       *       *       *       *    THE SPECTRE'S VOYAGE.      \"I see a hand you cannot see,      That beckons me away,    I hear a voice you cannot hear,      That will not let me stay.\"      There is a part"]]]
