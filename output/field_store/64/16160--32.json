He was always warning the factious that to  provoke the wrath of the king and the princes was to expose themselves to  almost certain death.  But, yielding to the prayers of this rebellious  and turbulent mob, he, instead of leaving Paris as the rest of his  profession had done, had remained there, and throwing himself boldly  amidst the storms of civil discord, he had advised the assumption of arms  and the defence of the city, which he knew was very displeasing to the  king and the grandees.\"  When he was taken to execution, \"he was put on a  car higher than the rest, that he might be better seen by everybody.\"  Nothing shook for a moment the firmness of this old man of seventy years.  \"Where are they who judged me?\" he said: \"let them come and set forth the  reasons for my death.  Judge me, O God, and separate my cause from that  of the evil-doers.\"  On his arrival at the market-place, some of the  spectators called out to him, \"Ask the king's mercy, Master John, that he  may pardon your offences.\"  He turned round, saying, \"I served well and  loyally his great-grandfather King Philip, his grandfather King John, and  his father King Charles; none of those kings ever had anything to  reproach me with, and this one would not reproach me any the more if he  were of a grown man's age and experience.  I don't suppose that he is a  whit to blame for such a sentence, and I have no cause to cry him mercy.  To God alone must I cry for mercy, and I pray Him to forgive my sins.\"  Public respect accompanied the old and courageous magistrate beyond the  scaffold; his corpse was taken up by his friends, and at a later period  honorably buried in the church of St. Catherine.    After the chastisements came galas again, of which the king and his court  were immoderately fond.  Young as he was (he was but seventeen), his  powerful uncle, the Duke of Burgundy, was very anxious to get him  married, so as to secure his own personal influence over him.  The wise  Charles V., in his dying hours, had testified a desire that his son  should seek alliances in Germany.  A son of the reigning duke, Stephen of  Bavaria, had come to serve in the French army, and the Duke of Burgundy  had asked him if there were any marriageable princess of Bavaria.  \"My  eldest brother,\" answered the Bavarian, \"has a very beautiful daughter,  aged fourteen.\"  \"That is just what we want,\" said the Burgundian: \"try  and get her over here; the king is very fond of beautiful girls; if she  takes his fancy, she will be Queen of France.\"  The Duke of Bavaria,  being informed by his brother, at first showed some hesitation.  \"It  would be a great honor,\" said he, \"for my daughter to be Queen of France;  but it is a long way from here.  If my daughter were taken to France, and  then sent back to me because she was not suitable, it would cause me too  much chagrin.  I prefer to marry her at my leisure, and in my own  neighborhood.\"  The matter was pressed, however, and at last the Duke of  Bavaria consented.  It was agreed that the Princess Isabel should go on  a visit to the Duchess of Brabant, who instructed her, and had her well  dressed, say the chroniclers, for in Germany they clad themselves too  simply for the fashions of France.  Being thus got ready, the Princess  Isabel was conducted to Amiens, where the king then was, to whom her  portrait had already been shown.  She was presented to him, and bent the  knee before him.  He considered her charming.  Seeing with what pleasure  he looked upon her, the constable, Oliver de Clisson, said to Sire De  Coney, \"By my faith, she will bide with us.\"  The same evening, the young  king said to his councillor, Bureau de la Riviere, \"She pleases me: go  and tell my uncle, the Duke of Burgundy, to conclude at once.\"  The duke,  delighted, lost no time in informing the ladies of the court, who cried,  \"Noel!\" for joy.  The duke had wished the nuptials to take place at  Arras; but the young king, in his impatience, was urgent for Amiens,  without delay, saying that he couldn't sleep for her.  \"Well, well,\"  replied his uncle, \"you must be cured of your complaint.\"  On the 18th  of July, 1385, the marriage was celebrated at the cathedral of Amiens,  whither the Princess Isabel \"was conducted in a handsome chariot, whereof  the tires of the wheels were of silvern stuff.\"  King, uncles, and  courtiers were far from a thought of the crimes and shame which would be  connected in France with the name of Isabel of Bavaria.  There is still  more levity and imprudence in the marriages of kings than in those of  their subjects.    Whilst this marriage was being celebrated, the war with England, and her  new king, Richard II., was going on, but slackly and without result.  Charles VI. and his uncle of Burgundy, still full of the proud confidence  inspired by their success against the Flemish and Parisian communes,  resolved to strike England a heavy blow, and to go and land there with a  powerful army.  Immense preparations were made in France for this  expedition.  In September, 1386, there were collected in the port of  Ecluse (Sluys) and at sea, between Sluys and Blankenberg, thirteen  hundred and eighty-seven vessels, according to some, and according to  others only nine hundred, large and small; and Oliver de Clisson had  caused to be built at Trdguier, in Brittany, a wooden town which was to  be transported to England and rebuilt after landing, \"in such sort,\" says  Froissart, \"that the lords might lodge therein and retire at night, so as  to be in safety from sudden awakenings, and sleep in greater security.\"  Equal care was taken in the matter of supplies.  \"Whoever had been at  that time at Bruges, or the Dam, or the Sluys would have seen how ships  and vessels were being laden by torchlight, with hay in casks, biscuits  in sacks, onions, peas, beans, barley, oats, candles, gaiters, shoes,  boots, spurs, iron, nails, culinary utensils, and all things that can be  used for the service of man.\"  Search was made everywhere for the various  supplies, and they were very dear.  \"If you want us and our service,\"  said the Hollanders, \"pay us on the nail; otherwise we will be neutral.\"  To the intelligent foresight shown in these preparations was added  useless magnificence.  \"On the masts was nothing to be seen but paintings  and gildings; everything was emblazoned and covered with armorial  bearings.  But nothing came up to the Duke of Burgundy's ship; it was  painted all over outside with blue and gold, and there were five huge  banners with the arms of the duchy of Burgundy and the countships of  Flanders, Artois, Rethel, and Burgundy, and everywhere the duke's device,  'I'm a-longing.'\"  The young king, too, displayed great anxiety to enter  on the campaign.  He liked to go aboard his ship, saying, \"I am very  eager to be off; I think I shall be a good sailor, for the sea does me no  harm.\"  But everybody was not so impatient as the king, who was waiting  for his uncle, the Duke of Berry, and writing to him letter after letter,  urging him to come.  The duke, who had no liking for the expedition,  contented himself with making an answer bidding him \"not to take any  trouble, but to amuse himself, for the matter would probably terminate  otherwise than was imagined.\"  The Duke of Berry at last arrived at Sluys  on the 14th of October, 1386.  \"If it hadn't been for you, uncle,\" said  the king to him, \"we should have been by this time in England.\"  Three  months had gone by; the fine season was past; the winds were becoming  violent and contrary; the vessels come from Treguier with the constable  to join the fleet had suffered much on the passage; and deliberations  were recommencing touching the opportuneness, and even the feasibility,  of the expedition thus thrown back. \"If anybody goes to England, I will,\"  said the king. But nobody went. \"One day when it was calm,\" says the monk  of St. Denis, \"the king, completely armed, went with his uncles aboard of  the royal vessel; but the wind did not permit them to get more than two  miles out to sea, and drove them back, in spite of the sailors' efforts,  to the shore they had just left.  The king, who saw with deep displeasure  his hopes thus frustrated, had orders given to his troops to go back,  and, at his departure, left, by the advice of his barons, some men-of-war  to unload the fleet, and place it in a place of safety as soon as  possible.  But the enemy gave them no time to execute the order.  As soon  as the calm allowed the English to set sail, they bore down on the  French, burned or took in tow to their own ports the most part of the  fleet, carried off the supplies, and found two thousand casks full of  wine, which sufficed a long while for the wants of England.\"    Such a mistake, after such a fuss, was probably not unconnected with a  resolution adopted by Charles VI. some time after the abandonment of the  projected expedition against England.  In October, 1388, he assembled at  Rheims a grand council, at which were present his two uncles, the Dukes  of Burgundy and Berry [the third, the Duke of Anjou, had died in Italy,  on the 20th of September, 1384, after a vain attempt to conquer the  kingdom of Naples], his brother, the Duke of Orleans, his cousins, and  several prelates and lords of note.  The chancellor announced thereat  that he had been ordered by the king to put in discussion the question,  whether it were not expedient that he should henceforth take the  government of his kingdom upon himself.  Cardinal Ascelin de Montaigu,  Bishop of Laon, the first to be interrogated upon this subject, replied  that, in his opinion, the king was quite in a condition, as well as in a  legal position, to take the government of his kingdom upon himself, and,  without naming anybody, he referred to the king's uncles, and especially  to the Duke of Burgundy, as being no longer necessary for the government  of France.  Nearly all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11954"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 4 (#3)"],[1," the scene of that victory which two  years previously had made them so proud.  A rumor spread that negotiation  was possible, and that the question of Milaness might be settled without  fighting.  The majority of the French captains repudiated the idea, but  the king entertained it.  His first impulses were sympathetic and  generous.  \"I would not purchase,\" said he to Marshal de Lautrec, \"with  the blood of my subjects, or even with that of my enemies, what I can pay  for with money.\"  Parleys were commenced; and an agreement was hit upon  with conditions on which the Swiss would withdraw from Italy and resume  alliance with the French.  A sum of seven hundred thousand crowns, it was  said, was the chief condition; and the king and the captains of his army  gave all they had, even to their plate, for the first instalment which  Lautrec was ordered to convey to Bufalora, where the Swiss were to  receive it.  But it was suddenly announced that the second army of twenty  thousand Swiss, which the Cardinal of Sion had succeeded in raising, had  entered Italy by the valley of the Ticino.  They formed a junction with  their countrymen; the cardinal recommenced his zealous preaching against  the French; the newcomers rejected the stipulated arrangements; and,  confident in their united strength, all the Swiss made common accord.  Lautrec, warned in time, took with all speed his way back to the French  army, carrying away with him the money he had been charged to pay over;  the Venetian general, D'Alviano, went to the French camp to concert with  the king measures for the movements of his troops; and on both sides  nothing was thought of but the delivery of a battle.    On the 13th of September, 1515, about midday, the Constable de Bourbon  gave notice to the king, encamped at Melegnano (a town about three  leagues from Milan), that the Swiss, sallying in large masses from Milan,  at the noisy summons of the bull of Uri and the cow of Unterwalden, were  advancing to attack.  \"The king, who was purposing to sit down to supper,  left it on the spot, and went off straight towards the enemy, who were  already engaged in skirmishing, which lasted a long while before they  were at the great game.  The king had great numbers of lanzknechts, the  which would fain have done a bold deed in crossing a ditch to go after  the Swiss; but these latter let seven or eight ranks cross, and then  thrust you them back in such sort that all that had crossed got hurled  into the ditch.  The said lanzknechts were mighty frightened; and but for  the aid of a troop of men-at-arms, amongst the which was the good knight  Bayard, who bore down right through the Swiss, there had been a sad  disaster there, for it was now night, and night knows no shame.  A band  of Swiss came passing in front of the king, who charged them gallantly.  There was heavy fighting there and much danger to the king's person, for  his great buffe [the top of the visor of his helmet] was pierced, so as  to let in daylight, by the thrust of a pike.  It was now so late that  they could not see one another; and the Swiss were, for this evening,  forced to retire on the one side, and the French on the other.  They  lodged as they could; but well I trow that none did rest at ease.  The  King of France put as good a face on matters as the least of all his  soldiers did, for he remained all night a-horseback like the rest  (according to other accounts he had a little sleep, lying on a  gun-carriage).    [Illustration: All Night a-horseback----19]    On the morrow at daybreak the Swiss were for beginning again, and they  came straight towards the French artillery, from which they had a good  peppering.  Howbeit, never did men fight better, and the affair lasted  three or four good hours.  At last they were broken and beaten, and there  were left on the field ten or twelve thousand of them.  The remainder, in  pretty good order along a high road, withdrew to Milan, whither they were  pursued sword-in-hand.\"  [_Histoire du bon Chevalier sans Peur et sans  Reproehe,_ t. ii.  pp. 99-102.]    The very day after the battle Francis I. wrote to his mother the regent a  long account, alternately ingenuous and eloquent, in which the details  are set forth with all the complacency of a brave young man who is  speaking of the first great affair in which he has been engaged and in  which he did himself honor.  The victory of Melegnano was the most  brilliant day in the annals of this reign.  Old Marshal Trivulzio, who  had taken part in seventeen battles, said that this was a strife of  giants, beside which all the rest were but child's play.  On the very  battle-field, \"before making and creating knights of those who had done  him good service, Francis I. was pleased to have himself made knight by  the hand of Bayard.  'Sir,' said Bayard, 'the king of so noble a realm,  he who has been crowned, consecrated and anointed with oil sent down from  heaven, he who is the eldest son of the church, is knight over all other  knights.'  'Bayard, my friend,' said the king, 'make haste; we must have  no laws or canons quoted here; do my bidding.'  'Assuredly, sir,' said  Bayard, 'I will do it, since it is your pleasure;' and, taking his sword,  'Avail it as much,' said he, 'as if I were Roland or Oliver, Godfrey or  his brother Baldwin; please God, sir, that in war you may never take  flight!' and, holding up his sword in the air, he cried, 'Assuredly, my  good sword, thou shalt be well guarded as a relic and honored above all  others for having this day conferred upon so handsome and puissant a king  the order of chivalry; and never will I wear thee more if it be not  against Turks, Moors, and Saracens!'  Whereupon he gave two bounds and  thrust his sword into the sheath.\"  [_Les testes et la Vie du Chevalier  Bayard, by Champier,_ in the _Archives curieuses de l'Histoire de  France,_ Series I.  t. ii.  p. 160.]    [Illustration: Bayard Knighting Francis I----19]    The effect of the victory of Melegnano was great, in Italy primarily, but  also throughout Europe.  It was, at the commencement of a new reign and  under the impulse communicated by a young king, an event which seemed to  be decisive and likely to remain so for a long while.  Of all the  sovereigns engaged in the Italian league against Francis I., he who was  most anxious to appear temperate and almost neutral, namely, Leo X., was  precisely he who was most surprised and most troubled by it.  When he  knew that a battle was on the eve of being fought between the French and  the Swiss, he could not conceal his anxiety and his desire that the Swiss  might be victorious.  The Venetian ambassador at Rome, Marino Giorgi,  whose feelings were quite the other way, took, in his diplomatic  capacity, a malicious pleasure in disquieting him.  \"Holy father,\" said  he, \"the Most Christian King is there in person with the most warlike and  best appointed of armies; the Swiss are afoot and ill armed, and I am  doubtful of their gaining the day.\"  \"But the Swiss are valiant soldiers,  are they not?\" said the pope.  \"Were it not better, holy father,\"  rejoined the ambassador, \"that they should show their valor against the  infidel?\"  When the news of the battle arrived, the ambassador, in grand  array, repaired to the pope's; and the people who saw him passing by in  such state said, \"The news is certainly true.\"  On reaching the pope's  apartment the ambassador met the chamberlain, who told him that the holy  father was still asleep.  \"Wake him,\" said he; but the other refused.  \"Do as I tell you,\" insisted the ambassador.  The chamberlain went in;  and the pope, only half dressed, soon sallied from his room.  \"Holy  father,\" said the Venetian, \"your Holiness yesterday gave me some bad  news which was false; to-day I have to give you some good news which is  true: the Swiss are beaten.\"  The pope read the letters brought by the  ambassador, and some other letters also.  \"What will come of it for us  and for you?\" asked the pope.  \"For us,\" was the answer, \"nothing but  good, since we are with the Most Christian king; and your Holiness will  not have aught of evil to suffer.\"  \"Sir Ambassador,\" rejoined the pope,  \"we will see what the Most Christian king will do; we will place  ourselves in his hands, demanding mercy of him.\"  \"Holy father, your  Holiness will not come to the least harm, any more than the holy See: is  not the Most Christian king the church's own son?\"  And in the account  given of this interview to the Senate of Venice the ambassador added,  \"The holy father is a good sort of man, a man of great liberality and of  a happy disposition; but he would not like the idea of having to give  himself much trouble.\"    [Illustration: Leo X.----21]    Leo X. made up his mind without much trouble to accept accomplished  facts.  When he had been elected pope, he had said to his brother, Julian  de' Medici, \"Enjoy we the papacy, since God hath given it us\" [_Godiamoci  il papato, poiche Dio ci l' ha dato_].  He appeared to have no further  thought than how to pluck from the event the advantages he could discover  in it.  His allies all set him an example of resignation.  On the 15th of  September, the day after the battle, the Swiss took the road back to  their mountains.  Francis I. entered Milan in triumph.  Maximilian Sforza  took refuge in the castle, and twenty days afterwards, on the 4th of  October, surrendered, consenting to retire to France with a pension of  thirty thousand crowns, and the promise of being recommended for a  cardinal's hat, and almost consoled for his downfall \"by the pleasure of  being delivered from the insolence of the Swiss, the exactions of the  Emperor Maximilian, and the rascalities of the Spaniards.\"  Fifteen years  afterwards, in June, 1530, he died in oblivion at Paris.  Francis I.  regained possession of all Milaness, adding thereto, with the pope's  consent, the duchies of Parma and Piacenza, which had been"]]]
