The nation, on  the contrary, is greatly my debtor.\" Here a clock struck, and seemed  to remind the Duke that he had an appointment; he rose, and Mr. Creevey  left him.    Who could keep such a communication secret? Certainly not Mr. Creevey.  He hurried off to tell the Duke of Wellington, who was very much amused,  and he wrote a long account of it to Lord Sefton, who received the  letter \"very apropos,\" while a surgeon was sounding his bladder to  ascertain whether he had a stone. \"I never saw a fellow more astonished  than he was,\" wrote Lord Sefton in his reply, \"at seeing me laugh as  soon as the operation was over. Nothing could be more first-rate than  the royal Edward's ingenuousness. One does not know which to admire  most--the delicacy of his attachment to Madame St. Laurent, the  refinement of his sentiments towards the Duke of Clarence, or his own  perfect disinterestedness in pecuniary matters.\"    As it turned out, both the brothers decided to marry. The Duke of Kent,  selecting the Princess of Saxe-Coburg in preference to the Princess  of Baden, was united to her on May 29, 1818. On June 11, the Duke of  Clarence followed suit with a daughter of the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen.  But they were disappointed in their financial expectations; for though  the Government brought forward proposals to increase their allowances,  together with that of the Duke of Cumberland, the motions were defeated  in the House of Commons. At this the Duke of Wellington was not  surprised. \"By God!\" he said, \"there is a great deal to be said  about that. They are the damnedest millstones about the necks of  any Government that can be imagined. They have insulted--PERSONALLY  insulted--two-thirds of the gentlemen of England, and how can it be  wondered at that they take their revenge upon them in the House of  Commons? It is their only opportunity, and I think, by God! they are  quite right to use it.\" Eventually, however, Parliament increased the  Duke of Kent's annuity by L6000. The subsequent history of Madame St.  Laurent has not transpired.    IV    The new Duchess of Kent, Victoria Mary Louisa, was a daughter of  Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and a sister of Prince Leopold.  The family was an ancient one, being a branch of the great House of  Wettin, which since the eleventh century had ruled over the March of  Meissen on the Elbe. In the fifteenth century the whole possessions of  the House had been divided between the Albertine and Ernestine branches:  from the former descended the electors and kings of Saxony; the latter,  ruling over Thuringia, became further subdivided into five branches,  of which the duchy of Saxe-Coburg was one. This principality was very  small, containing about 60,000 inhabitants, but it enjoyed independent  and sovereign rights. During the disturbed years which followed the  French Revolution, its affairs became terribly involved. The Duke was  extravagant, and kept open house for the swarms of refugees, who fled  eastward over Germany as the French power advanced. Among these was the  Prince of Leiningen, an elderly beau, whose domains on the Moselle  had been seized by the French, but who was granted in compensation  the territory of Amorbach in Lower Franconia. In 1803 he married the  Princess Victoria, at that time seventeen years of age. Three years  later Duke Francis died a ruined man. The Napoleonic harrow passed over  Saxe-Coburg. The duchy was seized by the French, and the ducal family  were reduced to beggary, almost to starvation. At the same time the  little principality of Amorbach was devastated by the French, Russian,  and Austrian armies, marching and counter-marching across it. For years  there was hardly a cow in the country, nor enough grass to feed a  flock of geese. Such was the desperate plight of the family which, a  generation later, was to have gained a foothold in half the reigning  Houses of Europe. The Napoleonic harrow had indeed done its work, the  seed was planted; and the crop would have surprised Napoleon. Prince  Leopold, thrown upon his own resources at fifteen, made a career for  himself and married the heiress of England. The Princess of Leiningen,  struggling at Amorbach with poverty, military requisitions, and a  futile husband, developed an independence of character and a tenacity of  purpose which were to prove useful in very different circumstances. In  1814, her husband died, leaving her with two children and the regency  of the principality. After her brother's marriage with the Princess  Charlotte, it was proposed that she should marry the Duke of Kent; but  she declined, on the ground that the guardianship of her children and  the management of her domains made other ties undesirable. The Princess  Charlotte's death, however, altered the case; and when the Duke of Kent  renewed his offer, she accepted it. She was thirty-two years old--short,  stout, with brown eyes and hair, and rosy cheeks, cheerful and voluble,  and gorgeously attired in rustling silks and bright velvets.    She was certainly fortunate in her contented disposition; for she was  fated, all through her life, to have much to put up with. Her second  marriage, with its dubious prospects, seemed at first to be chiefly a  source of difficulties and discomforts. The Duke, declaring that he was  still too poor to live in England, moved about with uneasy precision  through Belgium and Germany, attending parades and inspecting barracks  in a neat military cap, while the English notabilities looked askance,  and the Duke of Wellington dubbed him the Corporal. \"God damme!\" he  exclaimed to Mr. Creevey, \"d'ye know what his sisters call him? By God!  they call him Joseph Surface!\" At Valenciennes, where there was a  review and a great dinner, the Duchess arrived with an old and  ugly lady-in-waiting, and the Duke of Wellington found himself in a  difficulty. \"Who the devil is to take out the maid of honour?\" he kept  asking; but at last he thought of a solution. \"Damme, Freemantle, find  out the mayor and let him do it.\" So the Mayor of Valenciennes was  brought up for the purpose, and--so we learn from Mr. Creevey--\"a  capital figure he was.\" A few days later, at Brussels, Mr. Creevey  himself had an unfortunate experience. A military school was to be  inspected--before breakfast. The company assembled; everything was  highly satisfactory; but the Duke of Kent continued for so long  examining every detail and asking meticulous question after meticulous  question, that Mr. Creevey at last could bear it no longer, and  whispered to his neighbour that he was damned hungry. The Duke of  Wellington heard him, and was delighted. \"I recommend you,\" he said,  \"whenever you start with the royal family in a morning, and particularly  with THE CORPORAL, always to breakfast first.\" He and his staff, it  turned out, had taken that precaution, and the great man amused himself,  while the stream of royal inquiries poured on, by pointing at Mr.  Creevey from time to time with the remark, \"Voila le monsieur qui n'a  pas dejeune!\"    Settled down at last at Amorbach, the time hung heavily on the Duke's  hands. The establishment was small, the country was impoverished; even  clock-making grew tedious at last. He brooded--for in spite of his piety  the Duke was not without a vein of superstition--over the prophecy of  a gipsy at Gibraltar who told him that he was to have many losses and  crosses, that he was to die in happiness, and that his only child was  to be a great queen. Before long it became clear that a child was to be  expected: the Duke decided that it should be born in England. Funds were  lacking for the journey, but his determination was not to be set aside.  Come what might, he declared, his child must be English-born. A carriage  was hired, and the Duke himself mounted the box. Inside were the  Duchess, her daughter Feodora, a girl of fourteen, with maids, nurses,  lap-dogs, and canaries. Off they drove--through Germany, through  France: bad roads, cheap inns, were nothing to the rigorous Duke and the  equable, abundant Duchess. The Channel was crossed, London was reached  in safety. The authorities provided a set of rooms in Kensington Palace;  and there, on May 24, 1819, a female infant was born.        CHAPTER II. CHILDHOOD    I    The child who, in these not very impressive circumstances, appeared  in the world, received but scant attention. There was small reason to  foresee her destiny. The Duchess of Clarence, two months before,  had given birth to a daughter, this infant, indeed, had died almost  immediately; but it seemed highly probable that the Duchess would  again become a mother; and so it actually fell out. More than this,  the Duchess of Kent was young, and the Duke was strong; there was every  likelihood that before long a brother would follow, to snatch her faint  chance of the succession from the little princess.    Nevertheless, the Duke had other views: there were prophecies... At any  rate, he would christen the child Elizabeth, a name of happy augury. In  this, however, he reckoned without the Regent, who, seeing a chance  of annoying his brother, suddenly announced that he himself would be  present at the baptism, and signified at the same time that one of the  godfathers was to be the Emperor Alexander of Russia. And so when the  ceremony took place, and the Archbishop of Canterbury asked by what name  he was to baptise the child, the Regent replied \"Alexandria.\" At  this the Duke ventured to suggest that another name might be added.  \"Certainly,\" said the Regent; \"Georgina?\" \"Or Elizabeth?\" said the Duke.  There was a pause, during which the Archbishop, with the baby in his  lawn sleeves, looked with some uneasiness from one Prince to the other.  \"Very well, then,\" said the Regent at last, \"call her after her mother.  But Alexandrina must come first.\" Thus, to the disgust of her father,  the child was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12655"],[0,"The Boy Mechanic, Volume 1: 700 Things for Boys to Do (#3)"],[1,"to get out and unlock the padlocks with a  duplicate key.

When the sieve is shaken,  the can top will round up the flour and press it through quickly.  --Contributed by L. Alberta Norrell, Augusta, Ga.        ** A Funnel [7]    An automobile horn with the bulb and reed detached makes a good  funnel. It must be thoroughly cleaned and dried after using as a  funnel.        ** How to Make Comer Pieces for a Blotter Pad [8]    To protect the corners of blotting pads such as will be found on  almost every writing desk, proceed as follows:    First, make a design of a size proportionate to the size of the  pad and make a right-angled triangle, as shown in Fig. 1, on  drawing paper. Leave a small margin all around the edge and then  place some decorative form therein. Make allowance for flaps on  two sides, as shown, which may later be turned back and folded  under when the metal is worked. It should be noted that the  corners of the design are to be clipped slightly. Also note the  slight overrun at the top with the resulting V-shaped indentation.    To make a design similar to the one shown, draw one-half of it,  then fold along the center line and rub the back of the paper with  a knife handle or some other hard, smooth surface, and the other  half of the design will be traced on the second side. With the  metal shears, cut out four pieces of copper or brass of No. 22  gauge and with carbon paper trace the shape and decorative design  on the metal. Then cut out the outline and file the edges smooth.    Cover the metal over with two coats of black asphaltum varnish,  allowing each coat time to dry. Cover the back and all the face  except the white background. Immerse in a solution of 3 parts  water, 1 part nitric acid and 1 part sulphuric acid. When the  metal has been etched to the desired depth, about 1-32 of an inch,  remove it and clean off the asphaltum with turpentine. Use a stick  with a rag tied on the end for this purpose so as to keep the  solution off the hands and clothes. The four pieces should be  worked at the same time, one for each corner.    It remains to bend the flaps. Place the piece in a vise, as shown  in Fig. 2, and bend the flap sharply to a right angle. Next place  a piece of metal of a thickness equal to that of the blotter pad  at the bend and with the mallet bring the flap down parallel to  the face of the corner piece, Fig. 3. If the measuring has been  done properly, the flaps    [Illustration: Manner of Forming the Plates]    ought to meet snugly at the corner. If they do not, it may be  necessary to bend them back and either remove some metal with the  shears or to work the metal over farther. All the edges should be  left smooth, a metal file and emery paper being used for this  purpose.    If a touch of color is desired, it may be had by filling the  etched parts with enamel tinted by the addition of oil colors,  such as are used for enameling bathtubs. After this has dried,  smooth it off with pumice stone and water. To keep the metal from  tarnishing, cover it with banana-oil lacquer.        ** Boring Holes in Cork [8]    The following hints will be found useful when boring holes in  cork. In boring through rubber corks, a little household ammonia  applied to the bit enables one to make a much smoother hole and  one that is nearly the same size at both openings. The common  cork, if rolled under the shoe sole, can be punctured easily and a  hole can be bored straighter. The boring is made easier by boiling  the cork, and this operation insures a hole that will he the  desired size and remain the size of the punch or bit used.        ** Self-Lighting Arc Searchlight [9]    A practical and easily constructed self-lighting arc searchlight  can be made in the following manner: Procure a large can, about 6  in. in diameter, and cut three holes in its side about 2 in. from  the back end, and in the positions shown in the sketch. Two of the  holes are cut large enough to hold a short section of a garden  hose tightly, as shown at AA. A piece of porcelain tube, B, used  for insulation, is fitted tightly in the third hole. The hose  insulation A should hold the carbon F rigidly, while the carbon E  should rest loosely in its insulation.    The inner end of the carbon E is supported by a piece of No. 25  German-silver wire, C, which is about 6 in. long. This wire runs  through the    [Illustration: Arc in a Large Can]    porcelain tube to the binding post D. The binding post is fastened  to a wood plug in the end of the tube. The tube B is adjusted so  that the end of the carbon E is pressing against the carbon F. The  electric wires are connected to the carbon F and the binding post  D. A resistance, R, should be in the line.    The current, in passing through the lamp, heats the strip of  German-silver wire, causing it to expand. This expansion lowers  the end of the carbon E, separating the points of the two carbons  and thus providing a space between them for the formation of an  arc. When the current is turned off, the German-silver wire  contracts and draws the two carbon ends together ready for  lighting again. The feed can be adjusted by sliding the carbon F  through its insulation.    A resistance for the arc may be made by running the current  through a water rheostat or through 15 ft. of No. 25 gauge  German-silver wire.  --Contributed by R. H.

This will provide a shaving mug  always ready for the traveler and one that will occupy very little  space in the grip.        ** Homemade Snowshoes [9]    Secure four light barrel staves and sandpaper the outside smooth.  Take two old shoes that are extra large and cut off the tops and  heels so as to leave only the toe covering fastened to the sole.  Purchase two long book straps, cut them in two in the middle and  fasten the ends on the toe covering, as shown in Fig. 1. The  straps are used to attach the snowshoe to the regular shoe. When  buckling up the straps be sure to leave them loose enough for the  foot to work freely, Fig. 2. Fasten the barrel staves in pairs,  leaving a space of 4 in. between them as shown in Fig. 3, with  thin strips of wood. Nail the old shoe soles to crosspieces    [Illustration: Made from Barrel Staves]    placed one-third of the way from one end as shown. --Contributed  by David Brown, Kansas City, Mo.        ** Fish Signal for Fishing through Ice [10]    Watching a fish line set in a hole cut in the ice on a cold day is  very disagreeable, and the usual method is to    [Illustration: Bell and Battery in a Box]    have some kind of a device to signal the fisherman when a fish is  hooked. The \"tip ups\" and the \"jumping jacks\" serve their purpose  nicely, but a more elaborate device is the electric signal. A  complete electric outfit can be installed in a box and carried as  conveniently as tackle.    An ordinary electric bell, A, Fig. 1, having a gong 2-1/2 in. in  diameter, and a pocket battery, B are mounted on the bottom of the  box. The electric connection to the bell is plainly shown. Two  strips of brass, C, are mounted on the outside of the box. The  brass strips are shaped in such a way as to form a circuit when  the ends are pulled together. The box is opened and set on the ice  near the fishing hole. The fish line is hung over a round stick  placed across the hole and then tied to the inside strip of brass.  When the fish is hooked the line will pull the brass points into  contact and close the electric circuit.        ** Homemade Floor Polisher [10]    A floor polisher is something that one does not use but two or  three times a year. Manufactured polishers come in two sizes, one  weighing 15 lb., which is the right weight for family use, and one  weighing 25 lb.    A polisher can be made at home that will do the work just as well.  Procure a wooden box such as cocoa tins or starch packages are  shipped in and stretch several thicknesses of flannel or carpet  over the bottom, allowing the edges to extend well up the sides,  and tack smoothly. Make a handle of two stout strips of wood, 36  in. long, by joining their upper ends to a shorter crosspiece and  nail it to the box. Place three paving bricks inside of the box,  and the polisher will weigh about 16 lb., just the right weight  for a woman to use. The polisher is used by rubbing with the grain  of the wood.  --Contributed by Katharine D. Morse, Syracuse, N.

The bag  must be long enough for the end to fold over as shown in Fig. 1.  The folds are made over the string, as in    [Illustration: Stages in Tying a Bag]    Fig. 2. The string is then tied, Fig. 3, to form a handle, Fig. 4.  --Contributed by James M.
