At a short distance from the town, on the  road known to the army by the name of the Forty-first Lines, is a small  open space, which formerly was railed in: and here all criminals used to  be executed. On this occasion several gibbets, about the height of a  man, were erected, and a large crowd of Burmans assembled to feast their  eyes on the sanguinary scene that was to follow.    When the criminals arrived, they were tied within wooden frames, with  extended arms and legs, and the head-executioner going round to each,  marked with a piece of chalk, on the side of the men, in what direction  his assistant (who stood behind him with a sharpened knife,) was to make  the incision. On one man he described a circle on the side; another had  a straight line marked down the centre of his stomach; a third was  doomed to some other mode of death; and some were favoured by being  decapitated. These preparations being completed, the assistant  approached the man marked with a circle, and seizing a knife, plunged it  up to the hilt in his side, then slowly and deliberately turning it  round, he finished the circle! The poor wretch rolled his eyes in  inexpressible agony, groaned, and soon after expired; thus depriving  these human fiends of the satisfaction his prolonged torments would have  afforded them. The rest suffered in the same manner; and, from the  specimens I have seen of mangled corpses, I do not think this account  overdrawn. Hanging is a punishment that seldom, if ever, takes place.    The manner in which slighter punishments are made is peculiar to the  Burmans, and, as nearly as I can make it out, according to our  pronunciation, is called \"toung.\" The delinquent is obliged to kneel  down, and a man stands over him with a bent elbow and clenched fist. He  first rapidly strikes him on the head with his elbow, and then slides it  down until his knuckles repeat the blow, the elbow at the same time  giving a violent smack on the shoulders. This is repeated until it  becomes a very severe punishment, which may be carried to great  excess.--_Two Years in Ava_.           *       *       *       *       *        RETROSPECTIVE GLEANINGS.             *       *       *       *       *      BILL OF FARE AT AN ANCIENT INSTALMENT.

A drama, named as above, has been played with eminent success during the  present season at the English Opera House. The plot is founded on the  following horrible occurrence, which actually took place in Ireland in  the year 1813, and which we extract from the columns of an Irish paper  of the same date. The narrative is powerfully worked up in _The  Nowlans_, in the second series of the _O'Hara Tales_, and Mr. Banim is  the author both of the novel and the drama:--    \"The speech of George Smith, William Smith, and James Smith, who were  lately executed at Longford for the murder of James Reilly, a pedlar,  near Lanes-borough, has been published. It gives the following  description of the inhuman crime for which they suffered:    \"The discovery of this murder, as decreed by the Almighty, was made by  Margaret Armstrong, the wife of Sergeant Armstrong, of the 27th regiment  of foot, on the recruiting service in Athlone. She was going to her  husband, when she was overtaken by this dealing man. He asked her how  far she was going--she answered to Athlone, to her husband, and said as  it was getting late, and being scarce of money, she would make good her  way that night. He then replied, 'my poor woman, let not that hurry you,  I am going to Athlone myself, and there is a lodging at the next cross  at which I mean to stop, be advised, and go no farther to-night, and I  will pay your expenses.' When they came to the house, he asked for a bed  for himself and another for the woman, and called for supper; when that  was over, he paid the bill, and taking out his pocket-book, he counted  150_l._ which he gave in charge to George Smith, and retired to bed; the  woman likewise went to her's, the family sat up till twelve; after  which, when the man was fast asleep and all was silent, we, (the three  Smiths) went into the room where the man lay; we dragged him out of bed,  and cut his throat from ear to ear; we saved his blood in a pewter dish,  and put the body into a flaxseed barrel, among feathers, in which we  covered it up. Take care, and do the same with the woman, _said our  mother_. We accordingly went to her bedside, and saw her hands extended  out of the bed; we held a candle to her eyes, but she did not stir  during the whole time, as God was on her side; for had we supposed that  she had seen the murder committed by us, she would have shared the same  fate with the deceased man. Next morning when she arose, she asked was  the man up? We made answer, that he was gone two hours before, left  sixpence for her, and took her bundle with him. 'No matter,' said she,  'for I will see him in Athlone.' When she went away, I (George Smith)  dressed myself in my sister's clothes, and having crossed the fields,  met her, I asked her how far she was going? She said to Athlone: I then  asked her where she lodged? She told me at one Smith's, a very decent  house, where she met very good entertainment. 'That house bears a bad  name,' said I. 'I have not that to say of them,' said she, 'for they  gave me good usage.' It was not long until we saw a sergeant and two  recruits coming up the road; upon which she cried out, 'here is my  husband coming to meet me; he knew I was coming to him.' I immediately  turned off the road, and made back to the house. When she met her  husband, she fainted; and on recovering, she told him of the murder, and  how she escaped with her life. The husband went immediately and got  guards, and had us taken prisoners; the house was searched, and the  mangled body found in the barrel.\" The three monsters were, it is  mentioned, ordered for execution from the dock.           *       *       *       *       *      ANECDOTES AND RECOLLECTIONS.

(_To the Editor of the Mirror._)      Your article on the \"Patrons of Astronomy,\" in the Mirror, No. 328,  brought to my recollection the following anecdote, for the truth of  which I can answer, having received it from Mr. Watson, well known as  the most celebrated private optical instrument maker in Europe, and at  the time living on intimate terms with the late Mr. Arnold, the most  eminent watchmaker of the day. When the late Sir William Herschel's  great telescope was first exhibited at Slough, among other scientific  men who went to see it was Mr. Arnold, who took Mr. W. with him. Neither  of them thought much of it, though it was praised by the multitude; as  it was, with its constructor, patronized by the late king and his  consort, for Herschel was a German, as you well know. A few astronomical  amateurs, who thought as Mr. Arnold did, proposed to Mr. Adams, of  Fleet-street, then astronomical instrument maker to the king, (by whom  Mr. Watson was employed,) to get Watson to make an instrument in  opposition to Herschel's. The order being given by Adams, Watson set  about the work, and had made some progress in the construction of the  instrument, when the circumstance found its way to the ears of royalty.  Orders were immediately sent to Mr. Adams to put a stop to the work, or  he should no longer be optician to the king. Watson did not proceed, but  could never learn the cause of the counter-order, till after a lapse of  several years, when a stranger called on him, in Valentine-place,  Blackfriars-road, and after putting several questions to him about his  instruments, related to him the cause of the counter-order; upon which  Mr. Watson showed him the progress he had made, and which I have also  seen. This story I heard related by Mr. Watson at a dinner party at Mr.  Arnold's, at Well Hall, near Eltham, where were also Mr. Dollonds, and  Mr. J. R. Arnold, the son.    A Constant Reader.    August, 24, 1828.    Our Correspondent will perceive that we have qualified some phrases of  his letter, but that all the facts appear.    The _Quarterly Review_, No. 75, from which our notice was taken, is  tolerably plain upon the lack of patronage towards astronomy in this  country, and seems disposed, in enumerating the state of astronomical  knowledge in civilized Europe, to place Great Britain beside Spain or  Turkey![4] We chance to know that one of the most able and enterprising  astronomers of the present day relinquished a lucrative profession, that  he might be more at leisure to indulge his philosophical pursuits; so  that, if patrons be wanting, this apathy does not appear to have  entirely destroyed the taste for the divine study. This gentleman, in  concert with another, ascertained, in the course of three years, the  position and apparent distances of 380 double and triple stars, the  result of about 10,000 individual measurements, and for their Memoir,  they received the astronomical prize of the French Academy of Sciences.  In the following year, the former individual communicated to the Royal  Society the apparent distances and positions of 458 double stars, of  which 160 had never before been observed.        [4] We feel as if it were a species of treason to record the      fact, that, within the wide range of the British islands, _there      is only one observatory, and scarcely one, supported by the      government_! We say scarcely one, because we believe that some      of the instruments in the observatory of Greenwich were      purchased out of the private funds of the Royal Society of      London. The observatories of Oxford, Cambridge, Dublin,      Edinburgh (except a grant of 2,000_l_.), Armagh, and Glasgow,      are all private establishments, to the support of which      government contributes nothing. The consequence of this is, that      many of them are in a state of comparative inactivity; and none      of them, but that of Dublin, have acquired any celebrity in the      astronomical world. Such, indeed, was the state of practical      astronomy in Scotland, that within these few years, a Danish      vessel, which arrived at Leith, could not obtain, even in      Edinburgh, the time of the day for the purpose of setting its      chronometers.--_Q. Rev._    Of course, our correspondent does not impeach the talent of HERSCHEL;  but it is lamentable to reflect that no attempt has been made to repeat  or extend the labours of that indefatigable astronomer.--ED.           *       *       *       *       *        THE KELPIE.    A SCOTTISH LEGEND.    (_For the Mirror_.)        \"Kelpie's a river demon or a god,\"      Thus say the lexicons; I'll not belie 'em,    For though I mind not in the least the nod      Of these same critics, still I'll not defy 'em;    But that you may know more of this same god,      (Though I can't sing as Homer sung of Priam,)    I'll write a very pretty little poem,    Of which this present stanza's but the proem.      But to begin, for though 'tis rather long,      My poem I'll comprise into twelve stanzas,    Or fourteen at the furthest, if my song      Don't run to twenty--I'll offend no man, sirs,    If I can help it. So now I'm along      The road, and beg you'll notice these two lancers,    Who, on the backs of horses full of mettle    Hold a dispute, which we'll leave them to settle,      While you go with me, reader, kind and good,      To a small tributary stream from Tweed,    Which, if you don't know, as I'm in the mood,      I'll do my best to teach you, if you'll read;    I'll introduce you to the stream Glenrude--      This name will do--'twas in a glen--indeed,    'Twas not its proper name--'twill do quite well,    Why I choose so to call it I shan't tell,      But still it was a very pretty river,      Or rather stream, as ever could be seen--    If not so wide as the great Guadalquiver,      Its banks were nearly always clothed in green,    (Save when in winter the winds made you shiver,)      While the waves, bickering so bright and sheen,    Put you in mind of Avon, Rhine, or Hellespont,    Or any other stream to admire you're wont.      And round about the stream there were huge hillocks,      And firs and mountains, houses too and farms;    A maid lay on the grass--her light and fair locks      Were gently wound around her folded arms,    While softly grazing near there stood a huge ox,      And o'er her head an old oak threw its arms.    She was asleep, when, lo! the sound of horses'    Feet woke her, and, behold, she saw two corses.      At least she thought so--but at last thought better      'Twould be for her to get up and go home;    She got up quickly, and would soon have made her      Way home, but that the men who had just come    Spurr'd past her, and alighted when they met her,      While she with her surprise was almost dumb;    But soon spoke she, and bade them both disclose    Their names--to which one said, \"I'm Richard Groze.\"      The next spoke not at first, but soon replied,      \"Pray wherefore are you so surprised, my dear?    And wherefore, likewise, have you not complied      With my request, which I have sent in near    Some good score letters? which you did deride,      When they were forwarded by this man here.\"    He pointed then to Groze, and then he sighed,    \"My dear, dear Jeannie, will you be my bride?\"      The which words when our Jeannie heard, she stared,      And said, \"What do you mean, John Fitzadree?    You talk of letters, but of them the laird      Has never brought a single one to me;    But when I've seen him I have never cared      How soon he went, for he told me that ye    Were either dead or faithless--so he said    I'd better wed the live, than mourn the dead.      \"And then he promis'd I should have six horses,      Besides a coach, if I would be his bride;    But I refus'd--and he swore all his crosses      Should soon be o'er, and something else beside    And that's the reason why I thought ye corses,      When o'er the green this way I saw ye ride.    But now I see you've both served in the Lancers,    Though on my word you look much more like dancers.\"      To which John answer'd, \"Oh, the filthy fellow,      I gave him letters to you, which he said    He would deliver, were you ill or well. Oh!      How I should like to knock him on the head,    And would, but that would show I was quite mellow--      Besides, I see the coward has just fled,    Has ta'en to horse, and got across the ford--    Hang him, that I should with him be so bored!\"      But Jeannie said, \"John, thou shall do no murder.\"      To which he answer'd, \"I will not do so;\"    Then bounded off as though he had not heard her,      And reached a fording-place, but not so low    As where Groze cross'"]]]
