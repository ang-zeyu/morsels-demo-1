I was sure that they would, and, to  tell you the truth, I came here in order that you might look at them  well, and never forget them.\"    His smile, and his words, even more than his smile, seemed to be those  of a madman. He spoke very softly, with that childish, lisping voice,  which is peculiar to negroes, and his mysterious, almost menacing  words, consequently, sounded all the more as if they were uttered at  random by a man bereft of his reason. But his looks, the looks of those  pale, cold, clear, blue eyes, were certainly not those of a madman.  They clearly expressed menace, yes, menace, as well as irony, and,  above all, implacable ferocity, and their glance was like a flash of  lightning, which one could never forget.    \"I have seen,\" Monsieur de Vargnes used to say, when speaking about it,  \"the looks of many murderers, but in none of them have I ever observed  such a depth of crime, and of impudent security in crime.\"    And this impression was so strong, that Monsieur de Vargnes thought  that he was the sport of some hallucination, especially as when he  spoke about his eyes, the doctor continued with a smile, and in his  most childish accents: \"Of course, Monsieur, you cannot understand what  I am saying to you, and I must beg your pardon for it. To-morrow you  will receive a letter which will explain it all to you, but, first of  all, it was necessary that I should let you have a good, a careful look  at my eyes, my eyes, which are myself, my only and true self, as you  will see.\"    With these words, and with a polite bow, the doctor went out, leaving  Monsieur de Vargnes extremely surprised, and a prey to this doubt, as  he said to himself:    \"Is he merely a madman? The fierce expression, and the criminal depths  of his looks are perhaps caused merely by the extraordinary contrast  between his fierce looks and his pale eyes.\"    And absorbed in these thoughts, Monsieur de Vargnes unfortunately  allowed several minutes to elapse, and then he thought to himself  suddenly:    \"No, I am not the sport of any hallucination, and this is no case of an  optical phenomenon. This man is evidently some terrible criminal, and I  have altogether failed in my duty in not arresting him myself at once,  illegally, even at the risk of my life.\"    The judge ran downstairs in pursuit of the doctor, but it was too late;  he had disappeared. In the afternoon, he called on Madame Frogere, to  ask her whether she could tell him anything about the matter. She,  however, did not know the negro doctor in the least, and was even able  to assure him that he was a fictitious personage, for, as she was well  acquainted with the upper classes in Hayti, she knew that the Academy  of Medicine at Port-au-Prince had no doctor of that name among its  members. As Monsieur de Vargnes persisted, and gave descriptions of the  doctor, especially mentioning his extraordinary eyes, Madame Frogere  began to laugh, and said:    \"You have certainly had to do with a hoaxer, my dear monsieur. The eyes  which you have described are certainly those of a white man, and the  individual must have been painted.\"    On thinking it over, Monsieur de Vargnes remembered that the doctor had  nothing of the negro about him, but his black skin, his woolly hair and  beard, and his way of speaking, which was easily imitated, but nothing  of the negro, not even the characteristic, undulating walk. Perhaps,  after all, he was only a practical joker, and during the whole day,  Monsieur de Vargnes took refuge in that view, which rather wounded his  dignity as a man of consequence, but which appeased his scruples as a  magistrate.    The next day, he received the promised letter, which was written, as  well as addressed, in letters cut out of the newspapers. It was as  follows:    \"MONSIEUR: Doctor James Ferdinand does not exist, but the man whose  eyes you saw does, and you will certainly recognize his eyes. This man  has committed two crimes, for which he does not feel any remorse, but,  as he is a psychologist, he is afraid of some day yielding to the  irresistible temptation of confessing his crimes. You know better than  anyone (and that is your most powerful aid), with what imperious force  criminals, especially intellectual ones, feel this temptation. That  great Poet, Edgar Poe, has written masterpieces on this subject, which  express the truth exactly, but he has omitted to mention the last  phenomenon, which I will tell you. Yes, I, a criminal, feel a terrible  wish for somebody to know of my crimes, and when this requirement is  satisfied, my secret has been revealed to a confidant, I shall be  tranquil for the future, and be freed from this demon of perversity,  which only tempts us once. Well! Now that is accomplished. You shall  have my secret; from the day that you recognize me by my eyes, you will  try and find out what I am guilty of, and how I was guilty, and you  will discover it, being a master of your profession, which, by the by,  has procured you the honor of having been chosen by me to bear the  weight of this secret, which now is shared by us, and by us two alone.  I say, advisedly, _by us two alone_. You could not, as a matter of  fact, prove the reality of this secret to anyone, unless I were to  confess it, and I defy you to obtain my public confession, as I have  confessed it to you, _and without danger to myself_.\"    Three months later, Monsieur de Vargnes met Monsieur X---- at an  evening party, and at first sight, and without the slightest  hesitation, he recognized in him those very pale, very cold, and very  clear blue eyes, eyes which it was impossible to forget.    The man himself remained perfectly impassive, so that Monsieur de  Vargnes was forced to say to himself:    \"Probably I am the sport of an hallucination at this moment, or else  there are two pairs of eyes that are perfectly similar in the world.  And what eyes! Can it be possible?\"    The magistrate instituted inquiries into his life, and he discovered  this, which removed all his doubts.    Five years previously, Monsieur X---- had been a very poor, but very  brilliant medical student, who, although he never took his doctor's  degree, had already made himself remarkable by his microbiological  researches.    A young and very rich widow had fallen in love with him and married  him. She had one child by her first marriage, and in the space of six  months, first the child and then the mother died of typhoid fever, and  thus Monsieur X---- had inherited a large fortune, in due form, and  without any possible dispute. Everybody said that he had attended to  the two patients with the utmost devotion. Now, were these two deaths  the two crimes mentioned in his letter?    But then, Monsieur X---- must have poisoned his two victims with the  microbes of typhoid fever, which he had skillfully cultivated in them,  so as to make the disease incurable, even by the most devoted care and  attention. Why not?    \"Do you believe it?\" I asked Monsieur de Vargnes.    \"Absolutely,\" he replied. \"And the most terrible thing about it is,  that the villain is right when he defies me to force him to confess his  crime publicly, for I see no means of obtaining a confession, none  whatever. For a moment, I thought of magnetism, but who could magnetize  that man with those pale, cold, bright eyes? With such eyes, he would  force the magnetizer to denounce himself as the culprit.\"    And then he said, with a deep sigh:    \"Ah! Formerly there was something good about justice!\"    And when he saw my inquiring looks, he added in a firm and perfectly  convinced voice:    \"Formerly, justice had torture at its command.\"    \"Upon my word,\" I replied, with all an author's unconscious and simple  egotism, \"it is quite certain that without the torture, this strange  tale will have no conclusion, and that is very unfortunate, as far as  regards the story I intended to make out of it.\"        _An Uncomfortable Bed_      One autumn I went to stay for the hunting season with some friends in a  chateau in Picardy.    My friends were fond of practical joking, as all my friends are. I do  not care to know any other sort of people.    When I arrived, they gave me a princely reception, which at once  aroused distrust in my breast. We had some capital shooting. They  embraced me, they cajoled me, as if they expected to have great fun at  my expense.    I said to myself:    \"Look out, old ferret! They have something in preparation for you.\"    During the dinner, the mirth was excessive, far too great, in fact. I  thought: \"Here are people who take a double share of amusement, and  apparently without reason. They must be looking out in their own minds  for some good bit of fun. Assuredly I am to be the victim of the joke.  Attention!\"    During the entire evening, everyone laughed in an exaggerated fashion.  I smelled a practical joke in the air, as a dog smells game. But what  was it? I was watchful, restless. I did not let a word or a meaning or  a gesture escape me. Everyone seemed to me an object of suspicion, and  I even looked distrustfully at the faces of the servants.    The hour rang for going to bed, and the whole household came to escort  me to my room. Why? They called to me: \"Good night.\" I entered the  apartment, shut the door, and remained standing, without moving a  single step, holding the wax candle in my hand.    I heard laughter and whispering in the corridor. Without doubt they  were spying on me. I cast a glance around the walls, the furniture, the  ceiling, the hangings, the floor. I saw nothing to justify suspicion. I  heard persons moving about outside my door. I had no doubt they were  looking through the keyhole.    An idea came into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12774"],[0,"Dave Darrin's First Year at Annapolis (#3)"],[1,"appearance suits.\"    \"You're lucky, then,\" replied Grigsby.  \"Our crowd all have to  take the academic exams.\"    \"Cheer up,\" begged Dan.  \"Any baby can go past the academic exams.  Arithmetic is the hardest part.  One funny chap on the Civil  Service Commission nearly got me by asking me how much two and  two are, but Darrin saved me, just in the nick of time, by holding  up five fingers; so I knew the answer right off.\"    Some of the candidates were already surveying Dan with a good  deal of amusement.  They had heard much of the severe way upper  classmen at the Naval Academy have of taking all the freshness  out of a new man, and, like Dave, these other candidates scented  plenty of trouble ahead for cheerful, grinning Dan Dalzell.    \"Gentlemen,\" broke in Dave quietly, \"do you see the time on the  clock over on the academic building?  It's nine-fourteen.  What  do you say if we step promptly over to the administration building  and plunge into what's ahead of us?\"    \"Good enough,\" nodded one of the new acquaintances.  \"Suppose  you lead the way?\"    So, with Dan by his side, Dave piloted the others over to the  administration building, just beyond the chapel.    As they stepped inside, and found themselves in a hallway, a marine  orderly confronted them.    \"Candidates, gentlemen?  Walk right upstairs.  An orderly there will  direct you to the office of the superintendent's aide.\"    \"Thank you,\" replied Dave, with a bow, and led the way upstairs.    Near the head of the stairs another marine, in spick-and-span  uniform, wearing white gloves and with a bayonet at his belt,  called out quietly:    \"Candidates?  First two, step this way please.\"    He swung open a door.  Dave and Dan stepped into an office where  they found a young-looking though slightly bald gentleman in uniform,  seated behind a flat-top desk.    \"We have come to report, sir, according to our instructions,\"  announced Dave Darrin, happily.    \"You are candidates, then?\" asked Lieutenant-Commander Graham,  reaching for a pile of bound sheets.    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Names?    \"David Darrin and Daniel Dalzell, sir.\"    \"Have you your papers, Mr. Darrin?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    Dave drew an official-looking envelope from an inner pocket and  handed it to Lieutenant-Commander Graham.    These the Naval aide scanned closely, after which he looked up.    \"You have your papers, Mr. Dalzell?\"    \"Yes,\" nodded Dan.    A more than perceptible frown flashed across the face of the officer.    \"Mr. Dalzell, whenever you answer an officer you will say 'yes,  sir,' or 'very good, sir.'\"    Rather red in the face Dan handed over his envelope.    Mr. Graham examined these papers, too.  Then, pulling a pile of  blanks before him, he filled out two, bearing the names of the  young men, and signed them, after which he handed one of the signed  blanks to each.    \"Mr. Darrin, you will inquire of the orderly downstairs your way  to the office of the commandant of midshipmen.  You will then  at once present yourself before the commandant, handing him this  paper.\"    \"Yes, sir; thank you, sir,\" replied Dave, with a slight bow.    \"Mr. Dalzell, stick close to your friend and you will find out  what to do.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" murmured Dan, again reddening.    The orderly below directed the two young men how to proceed to the  main entrance of Bancroft Hall, there to turn to their left and  inquire again their way to the commandant's office.    \"You see,\" lectured Dave pleasantly, as the chums plodded along  one of the walks, \"you have already received your first lesson.  You answered the superintendent's aide without saying 'sir.'  You'll  have to work out of this freshness.\"    \"That wasn't freshness; it was ignorance,\" protested Dalzell.  \"Don't you worry, Dave; I shall soon get the Naval trotting gait  to such an extent that I shall be saying 'sir' at every other word.\"    This declaration was more prophetic than Dalzell could guess at  that moment.    Each lad had a queer feeling at heart as he began to climb the  long series of white steps that lead to the main entrance to Bancroft  Hall.  What would be the outcome?  Were they hence-forth to find  this huge pile \"home\" for four years to come?  Would they, through  all after life, look back upon this great government training  school as their alma mater?  It all seemed to depend, now, on  the verdict of the examining Naval surgeons!    But there was little time for thought.  Once inside, they were  ushered, by a white-gloved midshipman, into the office of Commander  Jephson, commandant of midshipmen.    That gentleman, also in uniform, as were all Navy officers on  duty at the Academy, looked briefly as the two young men stood  before him.    \"Candidates, gentlemen?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" replied Dave.    \"Your orders?\"    Each young man handed over the slip given him by the aide.  Commander  Jephson scanned each sheet closely, then made some entries on  a set of papers of his own.    Next the commandant touched a button on his desk.  Almost immediately  footsteps were heard outside.  Another white-gloved midshipman  entered, raising his hand smartly to his cap in salute.  This  salute the commandant acknowledged in kind.    \"Mr. Salisbury, conduct Candidates Darrin and Dalzell outside.  Ascertain how soon the surgeons will be ready to examine them,  and conduct the candidates to the Board Room at the time assigned  for their examination.\"    \"Very good, sir,\" replied Midshipman Salisbury, in measured tones.  Again the inter-change of salutes, after which Midshipman Salisbury  led Dave and Dan to an outer office.    \"Wait here,\" directed the midshipman briefly, \"I'll let you know when  it's time to go to the Board Room.\"    Five minutes later the midshipman again approached them.    By this time there were seven more candidates in the room.  The  aide to the superintendent and the commandant were passing the  young men quickly through the mill.    \"Mr. Darrin, Mr. Dalzell!\" called the midshipman master of ceremonies.  As Dave and Dan started to their feet their conductor added:    \"Follow me to the Board Room.\"    Down the corridor and into the Board Room the two chums were led.  There, awaiting them, they found three Naval medical officers,  all in their proper uniform and one of them seated at a desk.    \"Strip, with the least delay possible,\" ordered the senior surgeon.    In a very short space of time Dave and Dan stood forth, minus  clothes and, it must be confessed, both very nervous as to what  these medical men might or might not find.    Thorough, indeed, was the examination, which began with the heart.  But it went much further, including the hair, scalp, eyes, teeth,  the condition of the tonsils, the appearance of the tongue, and  so on, by regular stages, down to the soles of their feet.    \"If there's a square quarter of an inch these fellows have missed,  I didn't notice it,\" muttered Dan to himself.    \"You may dress, Mr. Darrin,\" announced the senior surgeon, and  Dave went to the chair on which his clothing lay.    \"Mr. Dalzell, come here a moment\"    Dan began to feel queer.  What had they missed?  On what point  was his physical condition doubtful?    \"Open your mouth,\" directed one of the surgeons.    Then followed some more exploration of his teeth.    \"Oh,\" murmured Dan, when the medical men gave him a rest for a  moment.  \"It's only my teeth, eh?  That's not a vitally important  point, is it, sir?\"    \"We reject candidates for what might seem very slight defects  of the teeth,\" replied the senior surgeon, with emphasis.  \"Open  your mouth again.\"    The cold ooze stood out on Dan's brow this time.  Joke as he might,  he did not want to be dropped out of the Navy.  Were these medical  officers going to find, in his mouth, the clue his disqualification?    \"Hm!\" said the senior surgeon, watching while another medical  officer did the probing and the holding of the dental mirrors.    That \"hm!\" sent a cold chill of dread coursing down young Daniel's  spine.    \"Your teeth just about pass,\" remarked the senior officer.  \"You  may dress, Mr. Dalzell.\"    It was not long before Dave and Dan both had their clothing on.  As Dan was finishing, Dave turned to the senior surgeon.    \"Is it improper, sir, for me to ask whether we have passed?\" asked  Darrin quietly.    \"You have both passed,\" nodded the surgeon.  \"Mr. Dalzell, however,  will do well to take the most wholesome care of his teeth hereafter.\"    Just then the door opened and two more candidates were shown in.    \"Come with me,\" directed the same midshipman master of ceremonies.    Dan was indiscreet enough to range up alongside their conductor,  just missing a vigorous nudge that Dave tried to give him.    \"Well, we slipped by the drug-store sign all right,\" Dan confided  to the white-gloved midshipman.  \"Now, how soon do we get our  messenger-boy uniforms?    \"Never, I hope,\" replied their conductor frigidly, \"unless you  can learn to speak of the uniform of the service with more respect.\"    Dan fell back abashed.  His style of humor, he was fast discovering,  did not seem to make a hit at Annapolis.    Back in the same waiting room the two young men lingered until  nearly eleven o'clock.  More than two score of candidates had  passed the medical examiners by this time, and some others had  failed to pass.  Yet many of these successful candidates had yet  to take their scholastic examinations over in Academic Hall, and  so did not wait with Dave and Dan, who had now passed in everything.    By eleven there were fully a dozen young men who, like Dave and  Dan, were ready to be sworn in.  These were now led to the commandant's  office.  Here each signed a paper agreeing to serve in the United  States Navy for a term of eight years, unless sooner legally discharged.  Each also signed a statement to the effect that he took this step  with the full permission of parents or guardian.    Then the commandant of cadets ordered them to form in a line"]]]
