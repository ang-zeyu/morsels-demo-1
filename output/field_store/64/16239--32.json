Ill qualities are catching as well as diseases;  and the mind is at least as much, if not a great deal more, liable to  infection, than the body. Go with mean people, and you think life is  mean.    3. GOOD EXAMPLE.--How natural is it for a child to look up to those  around him for an example of imitation, and how readily does he copy  all that he sees done, good or bad. The importance of a good example  on which the young may exercise this powerful and active element of  their nature, is a matter of the utmost moment.    4. A TRUE MAXIM.--It is a trite, but true maxim, that \"a man is known  by the company he keeps.\" He naturally assimilates by the force  of imitation, to the habits and manners of those by whom he is  surrounded. We know persons who walk much with the lame, who have  learned to walk with a hitch or limp like their lame friends. Vice  stalks in the streets unabashed, and children copy it.    5. LIVE WITH THE CULPABLE.--Live with the culpable, and you will  be very likely to die with the criminal. Bad company is like a nail  driven into a post, which after the first or second blow, may be drawn  out with little difficulty; but being once driven in up to the head,  the pinchers cannot take hold to draw it out, which can only be done  by the destruction of the wood. You may be ever so pure, you cannot  associate with bad companions without falling into bad odor.    6. SOCIETY OF THE VULGAR.--Do you love the society of the vulgar? Then  you are already debased in your sentiments. Do you seek to be with  the profane? In your heart you are like them. Are jesters and buffoons  your choice friends? He who loves to laugh at folly is himself a fool.  Do you love and seek the society of the wise and good? Is this your  habit? Had you rather take the lowest seat among these than the  highest seat among others? Then you have already learned to be good.  You may not make very much progress, but even a good beginning is not  to be despised.    7. SINKS OF POLLUTION.--Strive for mental excellence, and strict  integrity, and you never will be found in the sinks of pollution, and  on the benches of retailers and gamblers. Once habituate yourself to a  virtuous course, once secure a love of good society, and no punishment  would be greater than by accident to be obliged for half a day to  associate with the low and vulgar. Try to frequent the company of your  betters.    8. PROCURE NO FRIEND IN HASTE.--Nor, if once secured, in haste abandon  them. Be slow in choosing an associate, and slower to change him;  slight no man for poverty, nor esteem any one for his wealth. Good  friends should not be easily forgotten, nor used as suits of apparel,  which, when we have worn them threadbare, we cast them off, and call  for new. When once you profess yourself a friend, endeaver to be  always such. He can never have any true friends that will be often  changing them.    9. HAVE THE COURAGE TO CUT THE MOST AGREEABLE ACQUAINTANCE.--Do this  when you are convinced that he lacks principle; a friend should bear  with a friend's infirmities, but not with his vices. He that does a  base thing in zeal for his friend, burns the golden thread that ties  their hearts together.             *       *       *       *       *    SELF-CONTROL.      \"Honor and profit do not always lie in the same sack.\"--GEORGE  HERBERT.    \"The government of one's self is the only true freedom for the  individual.\"--FREDERICK PERTHES.    \"It is length of patience, and endurance, and forbearance that so much  of what is called good in mankind and womankind is shown.\"--ARTHUR  HELPS.      1. ESSENCE OF CHARACTER.--Self-control is only courage under another  form. It may also be regarded as the primary essence of character. It  is in virtue of this quality that Shakespeare defines man as a being  \"looking before and after.\" It forms the chief distinction between man  and the mere animal; and, indeed, there can be no true manhood  without it.    [Illustration: RESULT OF BAD COMPANY.]    2. ROOT OF ALL THE VIRTUES.--Self-control is at the root of all the  virtues. Let a man give the reins to his impulses and passions, and  from that moment he yields up his moral freedom. He is carried along  the current of life, and becomes the slave of his strongest desire for  the time being.    3. RESIST INSTINCTIVE IMPULSE.--To be morally free--to be more than an  animal--man must be able to resist instinctive impulse, and this can  only be done by exercise of self-control. Thus it is this power which  constitutes the real distinction between a physical and a moral life,  and that forms the primary basis of individual character.    4. A STRONG MAN RULETH HIS OWN SPIRIT.--In the Bible praise is given,  not to a strong man who \"taketh a city,\" but to the stronger man who  \"ruleth his own spirit.\" This stronger man is he who, by discipline,  exercises a constant control over his thoughts, his speech, and his  acts. Nine-tenths of the vicious desires that degrade society, and  which, when indulged, swell into the crimes that disgrace it,  would shrink into insignificance before the advance of valiant  self-discipline, self-respect, and self-control. By the watchful  exercise of these virtues, purity of heart and mind become habitual,  and the character is built up in chastity, virtue, and temperance.    5. THE BEST SUPPORT.--The best support of character will always be  found in habit, which, according as the will is directed rightly or  wrongly, as the case may be, will prove either a benignant ruler, or  a cruel despot. We may be its willing subject on the one hand, or its  servile slave on the other. It may help us on the road to good, or it  may hurry us on the road to ruin.    6. THE IDEAL MAN.--\"In the supremacy of self-control,\" says Herbert  Spencer, \"consists one of the perfections of the ideal man. Not to be  impulsive, not to be spurred hither and thither by each desire that  in turn comes upper-most, but to be self-restrained, self-balanced,  governed by the joint decision of the feelings in council assembled,  before whom every action shall have been fully debated, and calmly  determined--that it is which education, moral education at least,  strives to produce.\"    7. THE BEST REGULATED HOME.--The best regulated home is always that  in which the discipline is the most perfect, and yet where it is the  least felt. Moral discipline acts with the force of a law of nature.  Those subject to it yield themselves to it unconsciously; and though  it shapes and forms the whole character, until the life becomes  crystallized in habit, the influence thus exercised is for the most  part unseen and almost unfelt.    8. PRACTICE SELF-DENIAL.--If a man would get through life honorably  and peaceably, he must necessarily learn to practice self-denial  in small things as well as in great. Men have to bear as well as to  forbear. The temper has to be held in subjection to the judgment;  and the little demons of ill-humor, petulance, and sarcasm, kept  resolutely at a distance. If once they find an entrance to the mind,  they are apt to return, and to establish for themselves a permanent  occupation there.    9. POWER OF WORDS.--It is necessary to one's personal happiness, to  exercise control over one's words as well as acts: for there are  words that strike even harder than blows; and men may \"speak daggers,\"  though they use none. The stinging repartee that rises to the lips,  and which, if uttered, might cover an adversary with confusion, how  difficult it is to resist saying it! \"Heaven, keep us,\" says Miss  Bremer, in her 'Home', \"from the destroying power of words! There are  words that sever hearts more than sharp swords do; there are words the  point of which sting the heart through the course of a whole life.\"    10. CHARACTER EXHIBITS ITSELF.--Character exhibits itself in  self-control of speech as much as in anything else. The wise and  forbearant man will restrain his desire to say a smart or severe thing  at the expense of another's feeling; while the fool blurts out what he  thinks, and will sacrifice his friend rather than his joke. \"The mouth  of a wise man,\" said Solomon, \"is in his heart; the heart of a fool is  in his mouth.\"    11. BURNS.--No one knew the value of self-control better than the poet  Burns, and no one could teach it more eloquently to others, but when  it came to practice, Burns was as weak as the weakest. He could not  deny himself the pleasure of uttering a harsh and clever sarcasm at  another's expense. One of his biographers observed of him, that it  was no extravagant arithmetic to say that for every ten jokes he made  himself a hundred enemies. But this was not all. Poor Burns exercised  no control over his appetites, but freely gave them the rein:      \"Thus thoughtless follies laid him low,    And stained his name.\"    12. SOW POLLUTION.--Nor had he the self-denial to resist giving  publicity to compositions originally intended for the delight of the  tap-room, but which continued secretly to sow pollution broadcast in  the minds of youth. Indeed, notwithstanding the many exquisite poems  of this writer, it is not saying too much that his immoral writings  have done far more harm than his purer writings have done good; and  it would be better that all his writings should be destroyed and  forgotten, provided his indecent songs could be destroyed with them.    13. MORAL PRINCIPLE.--Many of our young men lack moral principle. They  cannot look upon a beautiful girl with a pure heart and pure thoughts.  They have not manifested or practiced that self-control which develops  true manhood and brings into subordination evil thoughts, evil  passions, and evil practices. Men who have no self-control will find  life a failure, both in a social and in a business sense. The world  despises an insignificant person who lacks backbone and character.

All it  really proves either way is a love of washing on a large scale;  which might merely indicate that Caracalla, like other Emperors,  was a lunatic.  But indeed what such things do indicate,  if only indirectly, is something which is here much more important.  They indicate not only a sincerity in the public spirit,  but a certain smoothness in the public services.  In a word,  while there were many revolutions, there were no strikes.  The citizens were often rebels; but there were men who were not rebels,  because they were not citizens.  The ancient world forced a number  of people to do the work of the world first, before it allowed  more privileged people to fight about the government of the world.  The truth is trite enough, of course; it is in the single word Slavery,  which is not the name of a crime like Simony, but rather of a scheme  like Socialism.  Sometimes very like Socialism.    Only standing idly on one of those grassy mounds under one of  those broken arches, I suddenly saw the Labour problem of London,  as I could not see it in London.  I do not mean that I saw which side  was right, or what solution was reliable, or any partisan points  or repartees, or any practical details about practical difficulties.  I mean that I saw what it was; the thing itself and the whole thing.  The Labour problem of to-day stood up quite simply, like a  peak at which a man looks back and sees single and solid,  though when he was walking over it it was a wilderness of rocks.  The Labour problem is the attempt to have the democracy of Paris  without the slavery of Rome.  Between the Roman Republic and the  French Republic something had happened.  Whatever else it was, it was  the abandonment of the ancient and fundamental human habit of slavery;  the numbering of men for necessary labour as the normal foundation  of society, even a society in which citizens were free and equal.  When the idea of equal citizenship returned to the world, it found  that world changed by a much more mysterious version of equality.  So that London, handing on the lamp from Paris as well as Rome,  is faced with a new problem touching the old practice of getting  the work of the world done somehow.  We have now to assume not  only that all citizens are equal, but that all men are citizens.  Capitalism attempted it by combining political equality with  economic inequality; it assumed the rich could always hire the poor.  But Capitalism seems to me to have collapsed; to be not only  a discredited ethic but a bankrupt business.  Whether we shall  return to pagan slavery, or to small property, or by guilds  or otherwise get to work in a new way, is not the question here.  The question here was the one I asked myself standing on that green  mound beside the yellow river; and the answer to it lay ahead of me,  along the road that ran towards the rising sun.    What made the difference?  What was it that had happened  between the rise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the  French Republic?  Why did the equal citizens of the first take it  for granted that there would be slaves?  Why did the equal citizens  of the second take it for granted that there would not be slaves?  How had this immemorial institution disappeared in the interval,  so that nobody even dreamed of it or suggested it?  How was it that  when equality returned, it was no longer the equality of citizens,  and had to be the equality of men?  The answer is that this equality  of men is in more senses than one a mystery.  It is a mystery which I  pondered as I stood in the corridor of the train going south from Rome.  It was at daybreak, and (as it happened) before any one else  had risen, that I looked out of the long row of windows across  a great landscape grey with olives and still dark against the dawn.  The dawn itself looked rather like a row of wonderful windows;  a line of low casements unshuttered and shining under the eaves  of cloud.  There was a curious clarity about the sunrise;  as if its sun might be made of glass rather than gold.  It was the first time I had seen so closely and covering such  a landscape the grey convolutions and hoary foliage of the olive;  and all those twisted trees went by like a dance of dragons in a dream.  The rocking railway-train and the vanishing railway-line seemed to be  going due east, as if disappearing into the sun; and save for the noise  of the train there was no sound in all that grey and silver solitude;  not even the sound of a bird.  Yet the plantations were mostly marked  out in private plots and bore every trace of the care of private owners.  It is seldom, I confess, that I so catch the world asleep,  nor do I know why my answer should have come to me thus when I was  myself only half-awake. It is common in such a case to see some new  signal or landmark; but in my experience it is rather the things  already grown familiar that suddenly grow strange and significant.  A million olives must have flashed by before I saw the first olive;  the first, so to speak, which really waved the olive branch.  For I remembered at last to what land I was going; and I knew the name  of the magic which had made all those peasants out of pagan slaves,  and has presented to the modern world a new problem of labour  and liberty.  It was as if I already saw against the clouds  of daybreak that mountain which takes its title from the olive:  and standing half visible upon it, a figure at which I did not look.  _Ex oriente lux_; and I knew what dawn had broken over the ruins of Rome.    I have taken but this one text or label, out of a hundred such,  the matter of labour and liberty; and thought it worth  while to trace it from one blatant and bewildering yellow  poster in the London streets to its high places in history.  But it is only one example of the way in which a thousand things  grouped themselves and fell into perspective as I passed farther and  farther from them, and drew near the central origins of civilisation.  I do not say that I saw the solution; but I saw the problem.  In the litter of journalism and the chatter of politics, it is too  much of a puzzle even to be a problem.  For instance, a friend  of mine described his book, _The Path to Rome_, as a journey through  all Europe that the Faith had saved; and I might very well describe  my own journey as one through all Europe that the War has saved.  The trail of the actual fighting, of course, was awfully  apparent everywhere; the plantations of pale crosses seemed to crop  up on every side like growing things; and the first French villages  through which I passed had heard in the distance, day and night,  the guns of the long battle-line, like the breaking of an endless  exterior sea of night upon the very borderland of the world.  I felt it most as we passed the noble towers of Amiens, so near  the high-water mark of the high tide of barbarism, in that night  of terror just before the turning of the tide.  For the truth which  thus grew clearer with travel is rightly represented by the metaphor  of the artillery, as the thunder and surf of a sea beyond the world.  Whatever else the war was, it was like the resistance of something  as solid as land, and sometimes as patient and inert as land,  against something as unstable as water, as weak as water; but also as  _strong_ as water, as strong as water is in a cataract or a flood.  It was the resistance of form to formlessness; that version or  vision of it seemed to clarify itself more and more as I went on.  It was the defence of that same ancient enclosure in which stood  the broken columns of the Roman forum and the column in the  Paris square, and of all other such enclosures down to the domestic  enclosures of my own dog and donkey.  All had the same design,  the marking out of a square for the experiment of liberty;  of the old civic liberty or the later universal liberty.  I knew, to take the domestic metaphor, that the watchdog of the West  had again proved too strong for the wild dogs of the Orient.  For the foes of such creative limits are chaos and old night, whether they  are the Northern barbarism that pitted tribal pride and brutal drill  against the civic ideal of Paris, or the Eastern barbarism that brought  brigands out of the wilds of Asia to sit on the throne of Byzantium.  And as in the other case, what I saw was something simpler and  larger than all the disputed details about the war and the peace.  A man may think it extraordinary, as I do, that the natural dissolution  of the artificial German Empire into smaller states should have  actually been prevented by its enemies, when it was already accepted  in despair by its friends.  For we are now trying hard to hold  the Prussian system together, having hammered hard for four mortal  years to burst it asunder.  Or he may think exactly the opposite;  it makes no difference to the larger fact I have in mind.  A man may think it simply topsy-turvy, as I do, that we should  clear the Turks out of Turkey, but leave them in Constantinople.  For that is driving the barbarians from their own rude tillage  and pasturage, and giving up to them our own European and Christian city;  it is as if the Romans annexed Parthia but surrendered Rome.  But he may think exactly the opposite; and the larger and simpler  truth will still be there.  It was that the weeds and wild  things had been everywhere breaking into our boundaries,  climbing over the northern wall or crawling through the eastern gate,  so that the city would soon have been swallowed in the jungle.  And whether the lines had been redrawn logically or loosely,  or particular things cleared with consistency or caprice, a line  has been drawn somewhere and a clearance has been made somehow.  The ancient plan of our city has been saved; a city at least  capable of containing citizens.  I felt this in the chance relics  of the war itself; I felt it twenty times more in those"]]]
