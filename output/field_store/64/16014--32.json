As her eyes rested upon them  an expression of misery and horror overspread her countenance.    \"What is the matter?\" he asked.  \"You ban sick?\"    \"Where is my baby?\" she cried, ignoring his questions.    Anderssen held out the chubby infant, but she shook her head.    \"It is not mine,\" she said.  \"You knew that it was not mine.   You are  a devil like the Russian.\"    Anderssen's blue eyes stretched in surprise.    \"Not yours!\" he exclaimed.  \"You tole me the kid aboard the Kincaid ban  your kid.\"    \"Not this one,\" replied Jane dully.  \"The other.  Where is the other?  There must have been two.  I did not know about this one.\"    \"There vasn't no other kid.  Ay tank this ban yours.  Ay am very sorry.\"    Anderssen fidgeted about, standing first on one foot and then upon the  other.  It was perfectly evident to Jane that he was honest in his  protestations of ignorance of the true identity of the child.    Presently the baby commenced to crow, and bounce up and down in the  Swede's arms, at the same time leaning forward with little hands  out-reaching toward the young woman.    She could not withstand the appeal, and with a low cry she sprang to  her feet and gathered the baby to her breast.    For a few minutes she wept silently, her face buried in the baby's  soiled little dress.  The first shock of disappointment that the tiny  thing had not been her beloved Jack was giving way to a great hope that  after all some miracle had occurred to snatch her baby from Rokoff's  hands at the last instant before the Kincaid sailed from England.    Then, too, there was the mute appeal of this wee waif alone and unloved  in the midst of the horrors of the savage jungle.   It was this thought  more than any other that had sent her mother's heart out to the  innocent babe, while still she suffered from disappointment that she  had been deceived in its identity.    \"Have you no idea whose child this is?\" she asked Anderssen.    The man shook his head.    \"Not now,\" he said.  \"If he ain't ban your kid, Ay don' know whose kid  he do ban.  Rokoff said it was yours.  Ay tank he tank so, too.    \"What do we do with it now?  Ay can't go back to the Kincaid.   Rokoff  would have me shot; but you can go back.  Ay take you to the sea, and  then some of these black men they take you to the ship--eh?\"    \"No! no!\" cried Jane.  \"Not for the world.  I would rather die than  fall into the hands of that man again.  No, let us go on and take this  poor little creature with us.  If God is willing we shall be saved in  one way or another.\"    So they again took up their flight through the wilderness, taking with  them a half-dozen of the Mosulas to carry provisions and the tents that  Anderssen had smuggled aboard the small boat in preparation for the  attempted escape.    The days and nights of torture that the young woman suffered were so  merged into one long, unbroken nightmare of hideousness that she soon  lost all track of time.  Whether they had been wandering for days or  years she could not tell.   The one bright spot in that eternity of  fear and suffering was the little child whose tiny hands had long since  fastened their softly groping fingers firmly about her heart.    In a way the little thing took the place and filled the aching void  that the theft of her own baby had left.  It could never be the same,  of course, but yet, day by day, she found her mother-love, enveloping  the waif more closely until she sometimes sat with closed eyes lost in  the sweet imagining that the little bundle of humanity at her breast  was truly her own.    For some time their progress inland was extremely slow.   Word came to  them from time to time through natives passing from the coast on  hunting excursions that Rokoff had not yet guessed the direction of  their flight.  This, and the desire to make the journey as light as  possible for the gently bred woman, kept Anderssen to a slow advance of  short and easy marches with many rests.    The Swede insisted upon carrying the child while they travelled, and in  countless other ways did what he could to help Jane Clayton conserve  her strength.  He had been terribly chagrined on discovering the  mistake he had made in the identity of the baby, but once the young  woman became convinced that his motives were truly chivalrous she would  not permit him longer to upbraid himself for the error that he could  not by any means have avoided.    At the close of each day's march Anderssen saw to the erection of a  comfortable shelter for Jane and the child.   Her tent was always  pitched in the most favourable location.   The thorn boma round it was  the strongest and most impregnable that the Mosula could construct.    Her food was the best that their limited stores and the rifle of the  Swede could provide, but the thing that touched her heart the closest  was the gentle consideration and courtesy which the man always accorded  her.    That such nobility of character could lie beneath so repulsive an  exterior never ceased to be a source of wonder and amazement to her,  until at last the innate chivalry of the man, and his unfailing  kindliness and sympathy transformed his appearance in so far as Jane  was concerned until she saw only the sweetness of his character  mirrored in his countenance.    They had commenced to make a little better progress when word reached  them that Rokoff was but a few marches behind them, and that he had at  last discovered the direction of their flight.  It was then that  Anderssen took to the river, purchasing a canoe from a chief whose  village lay a short distance from the Ugambi upon the bank of a  tributary.    Thereafter the little party of fugitives fled up the broad Ugambi, and  so rapid had their flight become that they no longer received word of  their pursuers.  At the end of canoe navigation upon the river, they  abandoned their canoe and took to the jungle.  Here progress became at  once arduous, slow, and dangerous.    The second day after leaving the Ugambi the baby fell ill with fever.  Anderssen knew what the outcome must be, but he had not the heart to  tell Jane Clayton the truth, for he had seen that the young woman had  come to love the child almost as passionately as though it had been her  own flesh and blood.    As the baby's condition precluded farther advance, Anderssen withdrew a  little from the main trail he had been following and built a camp in a  natural clearing on the bank of a little river.    Here Jane devoted her every moment to caring for the tiny sufferer, and  as though her sorrow and anxiety were not all that she could bear, a  further blow came with the sudden announcement of one of the Mosula  porters who had been foraging in the jungle adjacent that Rokoff and  his party were camped quite close to them, and were evidently upon  their trail to this little nook which all had thought so excellent a  hiding-place.    This information could mean but one thing, and that they must break  camp and fly onward regardless of the baby's condition.   Jane Clayton  knew the traits of the Russian well enough to be positive that he would  separate her from the child the moment that he recaptured them, and she  knew that separation would mean the immediate death of the baby.    As they stumbled forward through the tangled vegetation along an old  and almost overgrown game trail the Mosula porters deserted them one by  one.    The men had been staunch enough in their devotion and loyalty as long  as they were in no danger of being overtaken by the Russian and his  party.  They had heard, however, so much of the atrocious disposition  of Rokoff that they had grown to hold him in mortal terror, and now  that they knew he was close upon them their timid hearts would fortify  them no longer, and as quickly as possible they deserted the three  whites.    Yet on and on went Anderssen and the girl.  The Swede went ahead, to  hew a way through the brush where the path was entirely overgrown, so  that on this march it was necessary that the young woman carry the  child.    All day they marched.  Late in the afternoon they realized that they  had failed.  Close behind them they heard the noise of a large safari  advancing along the trail which they had cleared for their pursuers.    When it became quite evident that they must be overtaken in a short  time Anderssen hid Jane behind a large tree, covering her and the child  with brush.    \"There is a village about a mile farther on,\" he said to her.   \"The  Mosula told me its location before they deserted us.   Ay try to lead  the Russian off your trail, then you go on to the village.  Ay tank the  chief ban friendly to white men--the Mosula tal me he ban.  Anyhow,  that was all we can do.    \"After while you get chief to tak you down by the Mosula village at the  sea again, an' after a while a ship is sure to put into the mouth of  the Ugambi.  Then you be all right.  Gude-by an' gude luck to you,  lady!\"    \"But where are you going, Sven?\" asked Jane.  \"Why can't you hide here  and go back to the sea with me?\"    \"Ay gotta tal the Russian you ban dead, so that he don't luke for you  no more,\" and Anderssen grinned.    \"Why can't you join me then after you have told him that?\" insisted the  girl.    Anderssen shook his head.    \"Ay don't tank Ay join anybody any more after Ay tal the Russian you  ban dead,\" he said.    \"You don't mean that you think he will kill you?\" asked Jane, and yet  in her heart she knew that that was exactly what the great scoundrel  would do in revenge for his having been thwarted by the Swede.  Anderssen did not reply, other than to warn her to silence and point  toward the path along which they had just come.    \"I don't care,\" whispered Jane Clayton.  \"I shall not let you die to  save me if I can prevent it in any way.

The attack comes on suddenly and usually occurs in  connection with rest, and in horses that are of slow, quiet temperament.  The _exciting cause_ is an infection of the part with bacteria, the  infection probably occurring through some abrasion or small wound in the  skin.    _The local symptoms_ are swelling, tenderness and lameness in the affected  limb. The animal may refuse to support its weight on the affected limb. The  lymphatic glands in the region are swollen, and the swelling of the limb  pits on pressure. In the chronic form of the disease, the regions of the  cannon and foot remain permanently enlarged, and the swelling is more firm  than it is in the acute form (Fig. 24).    _The general symptoms_ are high body temperature, rapid pulse and the  partial or complete loss of appetite.    _The following treatment_ is recommended: Exercise is indicated in cases  that are not sufficiently advanced to cause severe lameness, or inability  to use the limb; rest and the application of woollen bandages wrung out of  a hot water solution of liquor cresolis compound are recommended; Epsom  salts in one-half pound doses may be given and repeated in two or three  days; a very light diet of soft feed should be given; liniments should  _not_ be applied until the soreness in the limb has subsided; iodide of  potassium may be given twice daily with the feed.

CHAPTER X    DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM      GENERAL DISCUSSION.--The nervous system may be divided into central and  peripheral portions. The _central portion_ comprises the brain or  encephalon and the spinal cord. These organs are lodged in the cranial  cavity and spinal canal. The nerves and ganglia comprise the _peripheral  portion_. The nerves form white cords that are made up of nerve fibres. The  ganglia are grayish enlargements formed by nerve cells and supporting  tissue, situated at the origin of the nerve trunk or along its course.    _The brain_ is an oval mass of nerve tissue elongated from before to  behind, and slightly depressed from above to below. It terminates  posteriorly in the spinal cord. It is divided into three portions:  _cerebrum, isthmus_ and _cerebellum_ (Fig. 25).    _The cerebrum_ forms the anterior portion. It is divided into two lateral  lobes or hemispheres by a deep longitudinal fissure. The surface of the  cerebral hemispheres is gray and roughened by pleats or folds separated by  grooves or fissures. The gray or cortical layer is distinct from the white  or connecting structure. The cortical layer is made up of nerve cells or  areas which control the voluntary muscles of the body. It is connected with  the special senses of touch, temperature and muscle-sense. The gray layer  is connected with the posterior portion of the brain, the isthmus or  medulla oblongata, by the white nerve tissue.    _The isthmus_ or _medulla oblongata_ is elongated from before to behind and  connects the cerebral hemispheres with the spinal cord, anteriorly and  posteriorly. It is divided into several different portions, and is made up  largely of white connecting fibres with nuclei of gray matter scattered  through them. The isthmus is hollowed out by a system of small ventricles  that extend from the cerebral hemispheres to the spinal cord, where they  terminate in a small, central canal. The isthmus is the highway between the  spinal cord and the higher nerve centres. It has in it certain cell centres  that give origin to six of the cranial nerves.    [Illustration: FIG. 25.--Photograph of model of horse's brain: longitudinal  section; lateral view; cerebrum; cerebellum; and isthmus.]    The third division of the brain is the _cerebellum_. This is a single mass  supported by the isthmus. It is situated posterior to the cerebrum, from  which it is separated by a transverse fold of the membranes covering the  brain. This mass of nerve tissue is much smaller than the cerebrum. The  white nerve tissue forms central nuclei which send out branches that ramify  in every direction. The centre of the muscular sense is said to be located  in this division of the brain. A second function is the maintenance of body  equilibrium through its connection with the nerve of the middle ear.    _The spinal cord_ commences at the posterior opening (occipital foramen) of  the cranial cavity, and terminates posteriorly in the lumbar region at the  upper third of that portion of the spinal canal belonging to the sacrum. It  is thick, white in color, irregularly cylindrical in shape, slightly  flattened above and below and reaches its largest diameter in the lower  cervical and lumbar regions. The spinal canal is lined by the outer  membrane that envelops the cord, which aids in fixing this organ to the  wall of the canal. The spinal cord is formed by white and gray nerve  tissue. The gray tissue is situated within the white, and it is arranged in  the form of two lateral comma-shaped columns connected by a narrow  commissure of gray matter. The extremities of the lateral gray columns mark  the origin of the superior and inferior roots of the spinal nerves. The  white tissue of the cord is also divided into lateral portions by superior  and median fissures. The inferior fissure does not extend as far as the  gray commissure, leaving the lateral inferior columns connected by a white  commissure. There are certain centres in the spinal cord that are capable  of carrying on certain reflex actions independent of the chief centre in  the brain. The white matter of the cord is made up of paths over which  impulses to and from the brain are transmitted.    _There are twelve pairs of cranial nerves_. Two pairs belong exclusively to  the special senses, smell and sight. Altogether there are ten pairs that  are devoted to functions connected with the head, either as nerves of the  special senses or in a motor or sensory capacity (Figs. 26 and 27). There  are two pairs distributed to other regions. These are the tenth and  eleventh pairs. The tenth pair or pneumogastric is distributed to the vital  organs lodged within the body cavities.    There are forty-two or forty-three pairs of spinal nerves given off from  the spinal cord. The spinal nerves have two roots, superior and inferior.  The superior is the sensory root and the inferior is the motor root, both  uniting to form a mixed nerve trunk. The sensory root possesses a ganglion  from which it originates.    Generally speaking, the cerebrospinal system deals with the special senses,  movement of skeletal or voluntary muscles and cutaneous and muscular  sensations. In addition to the above there is a distinct system termed the  sympathetic. The _sympathetic system_ consists of a long cord, studded with  ganglia, extending from the base of the neck to the sacrum. The ganglia are  connected with the inferior roots of the spinal nerves. This cord is  connected with groups of ganglia and nerve fibres in the abdominal region,  and this in turn is connected with terminal ganglia in distant tissues.  This system of nerves is distributed to the vital organs of the body.

This colt was affected  with facial paralysis when born.]    CONGESTION AND ANAEMIA OF THE BRAIN.--In congestion of the brain, the  blood-vessels distributed to the nerve tissue become engorged with blood.  It may be either active or passive.    _The cause of anaemia_ of the brain is an insufficient blood supply. This  may be due to an abundant haemorrhage and cardiac weakness caused by shock  or organic heart disease.    _The causes of congestion_ of the brain are faulty methods of care and  feeding. It sometimes occurs when horses are shipped in poorly ventilated  cars, or kept in close stables. Climatic changes, or changing the stable  and feed, may cause it. Extremely fat animals and animals that are rapidly  putting on fat are predisposed to this disorder. Improper methods of  feeding, lack of exercise, constipation and excitement are the most common  causes. Passive congestion may result from pressure on the jugular vein by  obstructing the flow of blood from the brain, and raising blood pressure in  the blood-vessels of the brain. It is sometimes caused by organic heart  trouble.    _The symptoms_ come on very suddenly in congestion of the brain. The  disease may manifest itself as soon as the animal is moved out of the stall  or bed, or it may come on while it is feeding. In slight cases, the animal  appears excited and restless, the eyes are bright, the pupils are dilated,  and the pulse beats and respirations quickened. If the animal is moving  about, it may stop suddenly and show marked symptoms of a nervous disorder,  such as turning around, running straight ahead and falling down. The period  of excitement is usually brief and may be followed by marked depression.  The mucous membranes of the head are a deep, red color.    _The symptoms_ in anaemic conditions of the brain are loss of  consciousness, stumbling, falling to the ground and sometimes convulsions.  The pig and dog may vomit. Favorable cases return to the normal within a  few hours. Acute inflammatory diseases of the brain and its coverings are  associated with cerebral hyperaemia or congestion.    _The treatment_ of mild cases is to give the animal quiet, well-ventilated"]]]
