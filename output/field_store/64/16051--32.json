His imagination was also fired by Marco Polo's description of the    marvelous riches of China, Japan, and the Spice Islands. But the idea of    going directly west into the midst of the unknown and seemingly    boundless waste of water, and on and on to Asia, appeared to most men of    the fifteenth century to be madness.      [Illustration: CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS The oldest known picture of    Columbus, in the National Library, Madrid]    HIS NOTION OF THE DISTANCE TO ASIA. Columbus made two fortunate    errors in reckoning the distance to the Indies. He imagined that Asia    extended much farther eastward than it actually does, making it nearer    Europe, and estimated the earth to be smaller than it is. His figures    placed Japan less than 3,000 miles west of the Canary Islands, instead    of the 12,000 miles which is the real distance. He accordingly thought    Japan would be found about where Mexico or Florida is situated.    HOW HE SECURED HELP. Even so, many years passed before Columbus was    able to undertake a voyage. He was too poor himself, and needed the help    of some government to fit out such an expedition. He may have tried to    get his native city, Genoa, to help him. There is such a story. If he    did, it was without success. He tried to obtain the help of Portugal,    where he lived a long time, and whose princes were greatly interested in    the discovery of new trade routes. His brother visited England in the    same cause. Neither of these countries, however, was willing to    undertake this expensive and doubtful enterprise.      The King and Queen of Spain, to whom Columbus turned, kept him waiting    many years for an answer. They thought that they had more important work    in hand. There was another king in Spain at the time, the king of the    Moors. Ferdinand and Isabella, the Christian king and queen, were trying    to conquer the Moors, and thus to end the struggle between Christians    and Mohammedans for the possession of Spain, which had lasted nearly    eight centuries. This war required all the strength and revenue    of Spain.      Fortunately, just as Columbus was becoming thoroughly discouraged, the    war with the Moors came to an end. Granada, the seat of their former    power, was finally taken in January, 1492. Now was a good time to ask    favors of the sovereigns of Spain, and to plan large enterprises for the    future. Powerful friends aided Columbus to renew his petition, and Queen    Isabella was persuaded to promise him all the help that he needed.    THE SHIPS OF COLUMBUS. Three ships, or caravels as they were    called, were fitted out. The _Santa Maria_ was the largest of the three,    but it was not much larger than the small sailing yachts which we see    to-day. It was about ninety feet long by twenty feet broad, and had a    single deck. This was Columbus's principal ship or flagship. The second    caravel, the _Pinta_, was much swifter, built high at the prow and    stern, and furnished with a forecastle for the crew and a cabin for the    officers, but without a deck in the center. The third and smallest    caravel, called the _Nina_, the Spanish word for baby, was built much    like the _Pinta_. Ninety persons made up the three crews.      [Illustration: COLUMBUS'S IDEAS OF THE ATLANTIC The shaded portions    represent the land as Columbus expected to find it. The light outline    of the Americas shows the actual position of the land as he found it.]      The ships were the usual size of those which coasted along the shores    of Europe in the fifteenth century. Expeditions had never gone far out    into the ocean. Columbus preferred the smaller vessels in a voyage of    discovery, because they would be able to run close to the shores and    into the smaller harbors and up the rivers.    BEGINNING OF THE VOYAGE. The expedition set sail from Palos in    Spain, August 3, 1492. It went directly to the Canary Islands. These    were owned by Spain, and were selected by Columbus as the most    convenient starting-point. The little fleet was delayed three weeks at    the islands making repairs. On September 6 Columbus was off again. He    struck due west from the Canaries.    THE TERRORS OF THE VOYAGE. While the little fleet was still in    sight of the Canary Islands a volcanic eruption nearly frightened the    sailors out of their wits. They deemed such an event an omen of evil.    But the expedition had fine weather day after day. Steady, gentle,    easterly winds, the trade winds of the tropics, wafted them slowly    westward. But the timid sailors began to wonder how they would ever be    able to return against winds which seemed never to change from the east.      Then they came to an immense field of seaweed, larger in area than the    whole of Spain. This terrified the sailors, who feared they might be    driven on hidden rocks or be engulfed in quicksands. They imagined, too,    that great sea-monsters were lurking beyond the seaweed waiting to    devour them.      [Illustration: A CARAVEL OF COLUMBUS After the reconstructed    model exhibited at the Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1893]    THE FIRST SIGNS OF A NEW LAND. In spite of fears and complaints,    and threats of resistance, Columbus kept a westward course for more than    four weeks. Then as he began to see so many birds flying to the    southwest, he concluded that land must be nearer in that direction. He    had heard that most of the islands held by the Portuguese were    discovered by following the flight of birds. So on October 7 the    westward course was changed to one slightly southwest.      From this time on the signs of land grew frequent. Floating branches,    occasionally covered with berries, pieces of wood, bits of cane, were    encouraging signs. Birds like ducks and sandpipers became common sights.    The Queen had promised a small pension to the one who should first see    land. Columbus had offered to give a silken doublet in addition. With    what eagerness the sailors must have kept on the lookout!    THE GREAT DISCOVERY. At last as the fleet was sailing onward in the    bright moonlight Columbus saw a light moving as if carried by hand along    a shore. A few hours later, about two o'clock on the morning of October    12, a sailor on the _Pinta_ saw land distinctly, and soon all beheld, a    few miles away, a long, low beach. The vessels hove to and waited for    daylight. Early the same day, Friday, October 12, 1492, they approached    the land, which proved to be a small island. Columbus named it San    Salvador, which means Holy Saviour. We do not know which one of the    Bahama islands he first saw, but we believe it was the one now called    Watling Island. Columbus went ashore with the royal standard and banners    flying to take possession of the land in the name of King Ferdinand and    Queen Isabella.    WHERE COLUMBUS THOUGHT HE WAS. The astonished inhabitants of the    island soon gathered to see the strange sight--the landing of white men    in the West Indies. They looked upon the ships as sea-monsters, and the    white men as gods. Nor was Columbus less puzzled by what he saw. The    people were a strange race--cinnamon colored, naked, greased, and    painted to suit each one's fancy. They had only the rudest means of    self-defense, and were almost as poor as the parrots that chattered in    the trees above them. Such savages bore little resemblance to the people    whom Marco Polo said inhabited the Spice Islands.      Columbus thought that he had reached some outlying island not far from    Japan. A cruise of a few days among the Bahamas satisfied him that he    was in the ocean near the coast of Asia, for had not Marco Polo    described it as studded with thousands of spice-bearing islands? He had    not found any spices, but the air was full of fragrance and the trees    and herbs were strange in appearance. Of course if the islands were the    Indies, the people must be Indians. Columbus called them Indians, and    this name clung to the red men, although their islands were not the    true Indies.      [Illustration: WATLING ISLAND, WHERE COLUMBUS FIRST LANDED]    THE SEARCH FOR THE GOLDEN EAST. Columbus thought that the natives    meant to tell him in their sign language of a great land to the south    where gold abounded. He set off in search of this, and came upon a land    the natives called Cuba. Its large size convinced him that he had at    last found the Asiatic mainland, and he sent two messengers, one a Jew    knowing many languages, in search of the Emperor of China. They found    neither cities nor kingdoms, neither gold nor spices. This was a great    disappointment to Columbus, but he patiently kept up his search for the    riches which he expected to find.    THE MISFORTUNES OF COLUMBUS. While on the coast of Cuba, Pinzon,    the commander of the _Pinta_, deserted him. Pinzon, whose ship was    swifter than the others, probably wished to be the first to get home, in    order to tell a story which would gain him the credit of the discovery    of the Indies. A few days later Columbus discovered a large island which    the natives called Hayti, and which he called Espanola or \"Spanish    Land.\" At every island he searched for the spices and gold which Marco    Polo had given him reason to expect. In a storm off Espanola Columbus's    own ship, the _Santa Maria_, was totally wrecked. Such disasters    convinced him that it was high time to return to Spain with the news of    his discovery.    PREPARATIONS FOR RETURN TO SPAIN. As there was not room for both    crews on the tiny _Nina_, his one remaining ship, it became necessary to    leave about forty sailors in Espanola. A fort was built, and supplies    were left for a year. Columbus with the rest set off on the return to    Spain. Ten Indians were captured and taken with them to show to his    friends in Europe. Besides, Columbus hoped that they would learn the    language "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9903"],[0,"Way of the Lawless (#20)"],[1,"he cut the rooster's breast deeply, shuddering as he  felt the knife take hold.    Something trickled warmly over his hands. Dropping his knife in his  pocket, Jud started, walked with steps as long as he could make them. He  went, with the spurs chinking to keep time for each stride, straight  toward a cliff some hundreds of yards from the house. The blood ran  freely. The old rooster, feeling himself sicken, sank weakly against the  breast of the boy, and Jud thought that his heart would break. He  reached the sharp edge of the cliff and heard the rush of the little  river far below him. At the same time his captive gave one final flutter  of the wings, one feeble crow, and was dead.    Jud waited until the tears had cleared from his eyes. Then he took off  the boots, and, in bare feet that would leave no trace on the rocks, he  skirted swiftly back to the house, put the dead body back in the chicken  yard, and returned to his grandfather.    There was one great satisfaction for him that evening, one reward for  the great sacrifice, and it came immediately. While the old man stood  trembling before him, Jud told his story.    It was a rich feast indeed to see the relief, the astonishment, the  pride come in swift turns upon that grim old face.    And yet in the end Pop was able to muster a fairly good imitation of a  frown.    \"And here you come back with a shirt and a pair of trousers plumb  spoiled by all your gallivantin',\" he said, \"not speakin' of a perfectly  good chicken killed. Ain't you never goin' to get grown up, Jud?\"    \"He was mine, the chicken I killed,\" said Jud, choking.    It brought a pause upon the talk. The other was forced to wink both eyes  at once and sigh.    \"The big speckled feller?\" he asked more gently.    \"The Plymouth Rock,\" said Jud fiercely. \"He wasn't no speckled feller!  He was the finest rooster and the gamest--\"    \"Have it your own way,\" said the old man. \"You got your grandma's tongue  when it comes to arguin' fine points. Now go and skin out of them  clothes and come back and see that you've got all that--that stuff of'n  your face and hands.\"    Jud obeyed, and presently reappeared in a ragged outfit, his face and  hands red from scrubbing.    \"I guess maybe it's all right,\" declared the old man. \"Only, they's  risks in it. Know what's apt to happen if they was to find that you'd  helped to get a outlaw off free?\"    \"What would it be?\" asked the boy.    \"Oh, nothin' much. Maybe they'd try you and maybe they wouldn't.  Anyways, they'd sure wind up by hangin' you by the neck till you was as  dead as the speckled rooster.\"    \"The Plymouth Rock,\" insisted Jud hotly.    \"All right, I don't argue none. But you just done a dangerous thing,  Jud. And there'll be a consid'able pile of men here in the mornin', most  like, to ask you how and why.\"    He was astonished to hear Jud break into laughter.    \"Hush up,\" said Pop. \"You'll be wakin' him up with all that noise.  Besides, what d'you mean by laughin' at the law?\" \"Why, granddad,\" said  Jud, \"don't I know you wouldn't never let no posse take me from you?  Don't I know maybe you'd clean 'em all up?\"    \"Pshaw!\" said Pop, and flushed with delight. \"You was always a fool kid,  Jud. Now you run along to bed.\"          CHAPTER 25      In Hal Dozier there was a belief that the end justified the means. When  Hank Rainer sent word to Tomo that the outlaw was in his cabin, and, if  the posse would gather, he, Hank, would come out of his cabin that night  and let the posse rush the sleeping man who remained, Hal Dozier was  willing and eager to take advantage of the opportunity. A man of action  by nature and inclination, Dozier had built a great repute as a hunter  of criminals, and he had been known to take single-handed chances  against the most desperate; but when it was possible Hal Dozier played a  safe game. Though the people of the mountain desert considered him  invincible, because he had run down some dozen notorious fighters, Hal  himself felt that this simply increased the chances that the thirteenth  man, by luck or by cunning, would strike him down.    Therefore he played safe always. On this occasion he made surety doubly  sure. He could have taken two or three known men, and they would have  been ample to do the work. Instead, he picked out half a dozen. For just  as Henry Allister had recognized that indescribable element of danger in  the new outlaw, so the manhunter himself had felt it. Hal Dozier  determined that he would not tempt Providence. He had his commission as  a deputy marshal, and as such he swore in his men and started for the  cabin of Hank Rainer.    When the news had spread, others came to join him, and he could not  refuse. Before the cavalcade entered the mouth of the canyon he had some  thirty men about him. They were all good men, but in a fight,  particularly a fight at night, Hal Dozier knew that numbers to excess  are apt to simply clog the working parts of the machine. All that he  feared came to pass. There was one breathless moment of joy when the  horse of Andrew was shot down and the fugitive himself staggered under  the fire of the posse. At that moment Hal had poised his rifle for a  shot that would end this long trail, but at that moment a yelling member  of his own group had come between him and his target, and the chance was  gone. When he leaped to one side to make the shot, Andrew was already  among the trees.    Afterward he had sent his men in a circle to close in on the spot from  which the outlaw made his stand, but they had closed on empty  shadows--the fugitive had escaped, leaving a trail of blood. However, it  was hardly safe to take that trail in the night, and practically  impossible until the sunlight came to follow the sign. So Hal Dozier had  the three wounded men taken back to the cabin of Hank Rainer.    The stove was piled with wood until the top was white hot, and then the  posse sat about on the floor, crowding the room and waiting for the  dawn. The three wounded men were made as comfortable as possible. One  had been shot through the hip, a terrible wound that would probably  stiffen his leg for life; another had gone down with a wound along the  shin bone which kept him in a constant torture. The third man was hit  cleanly through the thigh, and, though he had bled profusely for some  time, he was now only weak, and in a few weeks he would be perfectly  sound again. The hard breathing of the three was the only sound in that  dim room during the rest of the night. The story of Hank Rainer had been  told in half a dozen words. Lanning had suspected him, stuck him up at  the point of a gun, and then-refused to kill him, in spite of the fact  that he knew he was betrayed. After his explanation Hank withdrew to the  darkest corner of the room and was silent. From time to time looks went  toward that corner, and one thought was in every mind. This fellow, who  had offered to take money for a guest, was damned for life and branded.  Thereafter no one would trust him, no one would change words with him;  he was an outcast, a social leper. And Hank Rainer knew it as well  as any man.    A cloud of tobacco smoke became dense in the room, and a halo surrounded  the lantern on the wall. Then one by one men got up and muttered  something about being done with the party, or having to be at work in  the morning, and stamped out of the room and went down the ravine to the  place where the horses had been tethered. The first thrill of excitement  was gone. Moreover, it was no particular pleasure to close in on a  wounded man who lay somewhere among the rocks, without a horse to carry  him far, and too badly wounded to shift his position. Yet he could lie  in his shelter, whatever clump of boulders he chose, and would make it  hot for the men who tried to rout him out. The heavy breathing of the  three wounded men gave point to these thoughts, and the men of family  and the men of little heart got up and left the posse.    The sheriff made no attempt to keep them. He retained his first  hand-picked group. In the gray of the morning he rallied these men  again. They went first to the dead, stiff body of the chestnut gelding  and stripped it of the saddle and the pack of Lanning. This, by silent  consent, was to be the reward of the trapper. This was his in lieu of  the money which he would have earned if they had killed Lanning on the  spot. Hal Dozier stiffly invited Hank to join them in the manhunt; he  was met by a solemn silence, and the request was not repeated. Dozier  had done a disagreeable duty, and the whole posse was glad to be free of  the traitor. In the meantime the morning was brightening rapidly, and  Dozier led out his men.    They went to their horses, and, coming back to the place where Andrew  had made his halt and fired his three shots, they took up the trail.    It was as easy to read as a book. The sign was never wanting for more  than three steps at a time, and Hal Dozier, reading skillfully, watched  the decreasing distance between heel indentations, a sure sign that the  fugitive was growing weak from the loss of the blood that spotted the  trail. Straight on to the doorstep of Pop's cabin went the trail. Dozier  rapped at the door, and the old man himself appeared. The bony fingers  of one hand were wrapped around the corncob, which was his inseparable  companion, and in the other he held the cloth with which he had been  drying dishes. Jud turned from his pan of dishwater to cast a frightened  glance over his shoulder. Pop did not wait for explanations.    \"Come in, Dozier,\" he invited. \"Come in, boys. Glad to see you. Ain't  particular comfortable for an oldster like me when they's a full-grown,  man-eatin' outlaw layin' about the grounds. This Lanning come to my door  last night. Me and Jud was sittin' by the stove. He wanted to get us to  bandage him up, but I yanked my gun off'n the wall and ordered  him away.\"    \"You got your gun"]]]
