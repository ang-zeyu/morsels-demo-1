He was  the son of William Burnes, or Burness, at the time of the poet's birth a  nurseryman on the banks of the Doon in Ayrshire. His father, though  always extremely poor, attempted to give his children a fair education,  and Robert, who was the eldest, went to school for three years in a  neighboring village, and later, for shorter periods, to three other  schools in the vicinity. But it was to his father and to his own reading  that he owed the more important part of his education; and by the time  that he had reached manhood he had a good knowledge of English, a  reading knowledge of French, and a fairly wide acquaintance with the  masterpieces of English literature from the time of Shakespeare to his  own day. In 1766 William Burness rented on borrowed money the farm of  Mount Oliphant, and in taking his share in the effort to make this  undertaking succeed, the future poet seems to have seriously  overstrained his physique. In 1771 the family move to Lochlea, and Burns  went to the neighboring town of Irvine to learn flax-dressing. The only  result of this experiment, however, was the formation of an acquaintance  with a dissipated sailor, whom he afterward blamed as the prompter of  his first licentious adventures. His father died in 1784, and with his  brother Gilbert the poet rented the farm of Mossgiel; but this venture  was as unsuccessful as the others. He had meantime formed an irregular  intimacy with Jean Armour, for which he was censured by the  Kirk-session. As a result of his farming misfortunes, and the attempts  of his father-in-law to overthrow his irregular marriage with Jean, he  resolved to emigrate; and in order to raise money for the passage he  published (Kilmarnock, 1786) a volume of the poems which he had been  composing from time to time for some years. This volume was unexpectedly  successful, so that, instead of sailing for the West Indies, he went up  to Edinburgh, and during that winter he was the chief literary celebrity  of the season. An enlarged edition of his poems was published there in  1787, and the money derived from this enabled him to aid his brother in  Mossgiel, and to take and stock for himself the farm of Ellisland in  Dumfriesshire. His fame as poet had reconciled the Armours to the  connection, and having now regularly married Jean, he brought her to  Ellisland, and once more tried farming for three years. Continued  ill-success, however, led him, in 1791, to abandon Ellisland, and he moved  to Dumfries, where he had obtained a position in the Excise. But he was  now thoroughly discouraged; his work was mere drudgery; his tendency to  take his relaxation in debauchery increased the weakness of a  constitution early undermined; and he died at Dumfries in his  thirty-eighth year.    [See Burns' Birthplace: The living room in the Burns birthplace  cottage.]    It is not necessary here to attempt to disentangle or explain away the  numerous amours in which he was engaged through the greater part of his  life. It is evident that Burns was a man of extremely passionate nature  and fond of conviviality; and the misfortunes of his lot combined with  his natural tendencies to drive him to frequent excesses of  self-indulgence. He was often remorseful, and he strove painfully, if  intermittently, after better things. But the story of his life must be  admitted to be in its externals a painful and somewhat sordid chronicle.  That it contained, however, many moments of joy and exaltation is proved  by the poems here printed.    Burns' poetry falls into two main groups: English and Scottish. His  English poems are, for the most part, inferior specimens of conventional  eighteenth-century verse. But in Scottish poetry he achieved triumphs of  a quite extraordinary kind. Since the time of the Reformation and the  union of the crowns of England and Scotland, the Scots dialect had  largely fallen into disuse as a medium for dignified writing. Shortly  before Burns' time, however, Allan Ramsay and Robert Fergusson had been  the leading figures in a revival of the vernacular, and Burns received  from them a national tradition which he succeeded in carrying to its  highest pitch, becoming thereby, to an almost unique degree, the poet of  his people.    He first showed complete mastery of verse in the field of satire. In  \"The Twa Herds,\" \"Holy Willie's Prayer,\" \"Address to the Unco Guid,\"  \"The Holy Fair,\" and others, he manifested sympathy with the protest of  the so-called \"New Light\" party, which had sprung up in opposition to  the extreme Calvinism and intolerance of the dominant \"Auld Lichts.\" The  fact that Burns had personally suffered from the discipline of the Kirk  probably added fire to his attacks, but the satires show more than  personal animus. The force of the invective, the keenness of the wit,  and the fervor of the imagination which they displayed, rendered them an  important force in the theological liberation of Scotland.    The Kilmarnock volume contained, besides satire, a number of poems like  \"The Twa Dogs\" and \"The Cotter's Saturday Night,\" which are vividly  descriptive of the Scots peasant life with which he was most familiar;  and a group like \"Puir Mailie\" and \"To a Mouse,\" which, in the  tenderness of their treatment of animals, revealed one of the most  attractive sides of Burns' personality. Many of his poems were never  printed during his lifetime, the most remarkable of these being \"The  Jolly Beggars,\" a piece in which, by the intensity of his imaginative  sympathy and the brilliance of his technique, he renders a picture of  the lowest dregs of society in such a way as to raise it into the realm  of great poetry.    But the real national importance of Burns is due chiefly to his songs.  The Puritan austerity of the centuries following the Reformation had  discouraged secular music, like other forms of art, in Scotland; and as  a result Scottish song had become hopelessly degraded in point both of  decency and literary quality. From youth Burns had been interested in  collecting the fragments he had heard sung or found printed, and he came  to regard the rescuing of this almost lost national inheritance in the  light of a vocation. About his song-making, two points are especially  noteworthy: first, that the greater number of his lyrics sprang from  actual emotional experiences; second, that almost all were composed to  old melodies. While in Edinburgh he undertook to supply material for  Johnson's \"Musical Museum,\" and as few of the traditional songs could  appear in a respectable collection, Burns found it necessary to make  them over. Sometimes he kept a stanza or two; sometimes only a line or  chorus; sometimes merely the name of the air; the rest was his own. His  method, as he has told us himself, was to become familiar with the  traditional melody, to catch a suggestion from some fragment of the old  song, to fix upon an idea or situation for the new poem; then, humming  or whistling the tune as he went about his work, he wrought out the new  verses, going into the house to write them down when the inspiration  began to flag. In this process is to be found the explanation of much of  the peculiar quality of the songs of Burns. Scarcely any known author  has succeeded so brilliantly in combining his work with folk material,  or in carrying on with such continuity of spirit the tradition of  popular song. For George Thomson's collection of Scottish airs he  performed a function similar to that which he had had in the \"Museum\";  and his poetical activity during the last eight or nine years of his  life was chiefly devoted to these two publications. In spite of the fact  that he was constantly in severe financial straits, he refused to accept  any recompense for this work, preferring to regard it as a patriotic  service. And it was, indeed, a patriotic service of no small magnitude.  By birth and temperament he was singularly fitted for the task, and this  fitness is proved by the unique extent to which his productions were  accepted by his countrymen, and have passed into the life and feeling of  his race.            1771 - 1779          Song--Handsome Nell^1         Tune--\"I am a man unmarried.\"           [Footnote 1: The first of my performances.--R.

Our bridles were in keeping with the saddles, the reins as long as  plough lines, while the bit was frequently ornamental and costly. The  indispensable slicker, a greatcoat of oiled canvas, was ever at hand,  securely tied to our cantle strings. Spurs were a matter of taste. If  a rider carried a quirt, he usually dispensed with spurs, though, when  used, those with large, dull rowels were the make commonly chosen. In  the matter of leggings, not over half our outfit had any, as a trail  herd always kept in the open, and except for night herding they were  too warm in summer. Our craft never used a cattle whip, but if  emergency required, the loose end of a rope served instead, and was  more humane.    Either Flood or Lovell went into town every afternoon with some of the  boys, expecting to hear from the cattle. On one trip they took along  the wagon, laying in a month's supplies. The rest of us amused  ourselves in various ways. One afternoon when the tide was in, we  tried our swimming horses in the river, stripping to our  underclothing, and, with nothing but a bridle on our horses, plunged  into tidewater. My Nigger Boy swam from bank to bank like a duck. On  the return I slid off behind, and taking his tail, let him tow me to  our own side, where he arrived snorting like a tugboat.    One evening, on their return from Brownsville, Flood brought word that  the herd would camp that night within fifteen miles of the river. At  daybreak Lovell and the foreman, with \"Fox\" Quarternight and myself,  started to meet the herd. The nearest ferry was at Brownsville, and it  was eleven o'clock when we reached the cattle. Flood had dispensed  with an interpreter and had taken Quarternight and me along to do the  interpreting. The cattle were well shed and in good flesh for such an  early season of the year, and in receiving, our foreman had been  careful and had accepted only such as had strength for a long voyage.  They were the long-legged, long-horned Southern cattle, pale-colored  as a rule, possessed the running powers of a deer, and in an ordinary  walk could travel with a horse. They had about thirty vaqueros under a  corporal driving the herd, and the cattle were strung out in regular  trailing manner. We rode with them until the noon hour, when, with the  understanding that they were to bring the herd to Paso Ganado by ten  o'clock the following day, we rode for Matamoros. Lovell had other  herds to start on the trail that year, and was very anxious to cross  the cattle the following day, so as to get the weekly steamer--the  only mode of travel--which left Point Isabel for Galveston on the  first of April.    The next morning was bright and clear, with an east wind, which  insured a flood tide in the river. On first sighting the herd that  morning, we made ready to cross them as soon as they reached the  river. The wagon was moved up within a hundred yards of the ford, and  a substantial corral of ropes was stretched. Then the entire saddle  stock was driven in, so as to be at hand in case a hasty change of  mounts was required. By this time Honeyman knew the horses of each  man's mount, so all we had to do was to sing out our horse, and Billy  would have a rope on one and have him at hand before you could  unsaddle a tired one. On account of our linguistic accomplishments,  Quarternight and I were to be sent across the river to put the cattle  in and otherwise assume control. On the Mexican side there was a  single string of high brush fence on the lower side of the ford,  commencing well out in the water and running back about two hundred  yards, thus giving us a half chute in forcing the cattle to take  swimming water. This ford had been in use for years in crossing  cattle, but I believe this was the first herd ever crossed that was  intended for the trail, or for beyond the bounds of Texas.    When the herd was within a mile of the river, Fox and I shed our  saddles, boots, and surplus clothing and started to meet it. The water  was chilly, but we struck it with a shout, and with the cheers of our  outfit behind us, swam like smugglers. A swimming horse needs freedom,  and we scarcely touched the reins, but with one hand buried in a mane  hold, and giving gentle slaps on the neck with the other, we guided  our horses for the other shore. I was proving out my black, Fox had a  gray of equal barrel displacement,--both good swimmers; and on  reaching the Mexican shore, we dismounted and allowed them to roll in  the warm sand.    Flood had given us general instructions, and we halted the herd about  half a mile from the river. The Mexican corporal was only too glad to  have us assume charge, and assured us that he and his outfit were ours  to command. I at once proclaimed Fox Quarternight, whose years and  experience outranked mine, the _gringo_ corporal for the day, at which  the vaqueros smiled, but I noticed they never used the word. On Fox's  suggestion the Mexican corporal brought up his wagon and corralled his  horses as we had done, when his cook, to our delight, invited all to  have coffee before starting. That cook won our everlasting regards,  for his coffee was delicious. We praised it highly, whereupon the  corporal ordered the cook to have it at hand for the men in the  intervals between crossing the different bunches of cattle. A March  day on the Rio Grande with wet clothing is not summer, and the  vaqueros hesitated a bit before following the example of Quarternight  and myself and dispensing with saddles and boots. Five men were then  detailed to hold the herd as compact as possible, and the remainder,  twenty-seven all told, cut off about three hundred head and started  for the river. I took the lead, for though cattle are less gregarious  by nature than other animals, under pressure of excitement they will  follow a leader. It was about noon and the herd were thirsty, so when  we reached the brush chute, all hands started them on a run for the  water. When the cattle were once inside the wing we went rapidly, four  vaqueros riding outside the fence to keep the cattle from turning the  chute on reaching swimming water. The leaders were crowding me close  when Nigger breasted the water, and closely followed by several lead  cattle, I struck straight for the American shore. The vaqueros forced  every hoof into the river, following and shouting as far as the  midstream, when they were swimming so nicely, Quarternight called off  the men and all turned their horses back to the Mexican side. On  landing opposite the exit from the ford, our men held the cattle as  they came out, in order to bait the next bunch.    I rested my horse only a few minutes before taking the water again,  but Lovell urged me to take an extra horse across, so as to have a  change in case my black became fagged in swimming. Quarternight was a  harsh _segundo_, for no sooner had I reached the other bank than he  cut off the second bunch of about four hundred and started them.  Turning Nigger Boy loose behind the brush fence, so as to be out of  the way, I galloped out on my second horse, and meeting the cattle,  turned and again took the lead for the river. My substitute did not  swim with the freedom and ease of the black, and several times cattle  swam so near me that I could lay my hand on their backs. When about  halfway over, I heard shoutings behind me in English, and on looking  back saw Nigger Boy swimming after us. A number of vaqueros attempted  to catch him, but he outswam them and came out with the cattle; the  excitement was too much for him to miss.    Each trip was a repetition of the former, with varying incident. Every  hoof was over in less than two hours. On the last trip, in which there  were about seven hundred head, the horse of one of the Mexican  vaqueros took cramps, it was supposed, at about the middle of the  river, and sank without a moment's warning. A number of us heard the  man's terrified cry, only in time to see horse and rider sink. Every  man within reach turned to the rescue, and a moment later the man rose  to the surface. Fox caught him by the shirt, and, shaking the water  out of him, turned him over to one of the other vaqueros, who towed  him back to their own side. Strange as it may appear, the horse never  came to the surface again, which supported the supposition of cramps.    After a change of clothes for Quarternight and myself, and rather late  dinner for all hands, there yet remained the counting of the herd. The  Mexican corporal and two of his men had come over for the purpose, and  though Lovell and several wealthy rancheros, the sellers of the  cattle, were present, it remained for Flood and the corporal to make  the final count, as between buyer and seller. There was also present a  river guard,--sent out by the United States Custom House, as a matter  of form in the entry papers,--who also insisted on counting. In order  to have a second count on the herd, Lovell ordered The Rebel to count  opposite the government's man. We strung the cattle out, now logy with  water, and after making quite a circle, brought the herd around where  there was quite a bluff bank of the river. The herd handled well, and  for a quarter of an hour we lined them between our four mounted  counters. The only difference in the manner of counting between Flood  and the Mexican corporal was that the American used a tally string  tied to the pommel of his saddle, on which were ten knots, keeping  count by slipping a knot on each even hundred, while the Mexican used  ten small pebbles, shifting a pebble from one hand to the other on  hundreds. \"Just a mere difference in nationality,\" Lovell had me  interpret to the selling dons.    When the count ended only two of the men agreed on"]]]
