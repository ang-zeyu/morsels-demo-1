The sun had set and rain was beginning to fall. Owl  Bear looked around for some place where he could sleep dry. Close by he saw  a hole in the rocks. He got down on his hands and knees and crept in. Here  it was very dark. He could see nothing, so he crept very slowly, feeling as  he went. All at once his hand touched something strange. He felt of it. It  was a person's foot, and there was a moccasin on it. He stopped, and sat  still. Then he felt a little further. Yes, it was a person's leg. He could  feel the cowskin legging. Now he did not know what to do. He thought  perhaps it was a dead person; and again, he thought it might be one of his  relations, who had become ashamed and turned back after him.    Pretty soon he put his hand on the leg again and felt along up. He touched  the person's belly. It was warm. He felt of the breast, and could feel it  rise and fall as the breath came and went; and the heart was beating  fast. Still the person did not move. Maybe he was afraid. Perhaps he  thought that was a ghost feeling of him.    Owl Bear now knew this person was not dead. He thought he would try if he  could learn who the man was, for he was not afraid. His heart was sad. His  people and his relations had left him, and he had made up his mind to give  his body to the Snakes. So he began and felt all over the man,--of his  face, hair, robe, leggings, belt, weapons; and by and by he stopped feeling  of him. He could not tell whether it was one of his people or not.    Pretty soon the strange person sat up and felt all over Owl Bear; and when  he had finished, he took the Piegan's hand and opened it and held it up,  waving it from side to side, saying by signs, \"Who are you?\"    Owl Bear put his closed hand against the person's cheek and rubbed it; he  said in signs, \"Piegan!\" and then he asked the person who he was. A finger  was placed against his breast and moved across it _zigzag_. It was the sign  for \"Snake.\"    \"_Hai yah_!\" thought Owl Bear, \"a Snake, my enemy.\" For a long time he sat  still, thinking. By and by he drew his knife from his belt and placed it in  the Snake's hand, and signed, \"Kill me!\" He waited. He thought soon his  heart would be cut. He wanted to die. Why live? His people had left him.    Then the Snake took Owl Bear's hand and put a knife in it and motioned that  Owl Bear should cut his heart, but the Piegan would not do it. He lay down,  and the Snake lay down beside him. Maybe they slept. Likely not.    So the night went and morning came. It was light, and they crawled out of  the cave, and talked a long time together by signs. Owl Bear told the Snake  where he had come from, how his party had dreamed bad and left him, and  that he was going alone to give his body to the Snakes.    Then the Snake said: \"_I_ was going to war, too. I was going against the  Piegans. Now I am done. Are you a chief?\"    \"I am the head chief,\" replied Owl Bear. \"I lead. All the others follow.\"    \"I am the same as you,\" said the Snake. \"I am the chief. I like you. You  are brave. You gave me your knife to kill you with. How is your heart?  Shall the Snakes and the Piegans make peace?\"    \"Your words are good,\" replied Owl Bear. \"I am glad.\"    \"How many nights will it take you to go home and come back here with your  people?\" asked the Snake.    Owl Bear thought and counted. \"In twenty-five nights,\" he replied, \"the  Piegans will camp down by that creek.\"    \"My trail,\" said the Snake, \"goes across the mountains. I will try to be  here in twenty-five nights, but I will camp with my people just behind that  first mountain. When you get here with the Piegans, come with one of your  wives and stay all night with me. In the morning the Snakes will move and  put up their lodges beside the Piegans.\"    \"As you say,\" replied the chief, \"so it shall be done.\" Then they built a  fire and cooked some meat and ate together.    \"I am ashamed to go home,\" said Owl Bear. \"I have taken no horses, no  scalps. Let me cut off your side locks?\"    \"Take them,\" said the Snake.    Owl Bear cut off the chiefs braids close to his head, and then the Snake  cut off the Piegan's braids. Then they exchanged clothes and weapons and  started out, the Piegan north, the Snake south.      III    \"Owl Bear has come! Owl Bear has come!\" the people were shouting.    The warriors rushed to his lodge. _Whish_! how quickly it was filled!  Hundreds stood outside, waiting to hear the news.    For a long time the chief did not speak. He was still angry with his  people. An old man was talking, telling the news of the camp. Owl Bear did  not look at him. He ate some food and rested. Many were in the lodge who  had started to war with him. They were now ashamed. They did not speak,  either, but kept looking at the fire. After a long time the chief said: \"I  travelled on alone. I met a Snake. I took his scalp and clothes, and his  weapons. See, here is his scalp!\" And he held up the two braids of hair.    No one spoke, but the chief saw them nudge each other and smile a little;  and soon they went out and said to one another: \"What a lie! That is not an  enemy's scalp; there is no flesh on it He has robbed some dead person.\"    Some one told the chief what they said, but he only laughed and replied:--    \"_I_ do not care. They were too much afraid even to go on and rob a dead  person. They should wear women's dresses.\"    Near sunset, Owl Bear called for a horse, and rode all through camp so  every one could hear, shouting out: \"Listen! listen! To-morrow we move  camp. We travel south. The Piegans and Snakes are going to make peace. If  any one refuses to go, I will kill him. All must go.\"    Then an old medicine man came up to him and said: \"_Kyi_, Owl Bear! listen  to me. Why talk like this? You know we are not afraid of the Snakes. Have  we not fought them and driven them out of this country? Do you think we are  afraid to go and meet them? No. We will go and make peace with them as you  say, and if they want to fight, we will fight. Now you are angry with those  who started to war with you. Don't be angry. Dreams belong to the Sun. He  gave them to us, so that we can see ahead and know what will happen. The  Piegans are not cowards. Their dreams told them to turn back. So do not be  angry with them any more.\"    \"There is truth in what you say, old man,\" replied Owl Bear; \"I will take  your words.\"      IV    In those days the Piegans were a great tribe. When they travelled, if you  were with the head ones, you could not see the last ones, they were so far  back. They had more horses than they could count, so they used fresh horses  every day and travelled very fast. On the twenty-fourth day they reached  the place where Owl Bear had told the Snake they would camp, and put up  their lodges along the creek. Soon some young men came in, and said they  had seen some fresh horse trails up toward the mountain.    \"It must be the Snakes,\" said the chief; \"they have already arrived,  although there is yet one night.\" So he called one of his wives, and  getting on their horses they set out to find the Snake camp. They took the  trail up over the mountain, and soon came in sight of the lodges. It was a  big camp. Every open place in the valley was covered with lodges, and the  hills were dotted with horses; for the Snakes had a great many more horses  than the Piegans.    Some of the Snakes saw the Piegans coming, and they ran to the chief,  saying: \"Two strangers are in sight, coming this way. What shall be done?\"    \"Do not harm them,\" replied the chief. \"They are friends of mine. I have  been expecting them.\" Then the Snakes wondered, for the chief had told them  nothing about his war trip.    Now when Owl Bear had come to the camp, he asked in signs for the chiefs  lodge, and they pointed him to one in the middle. It was small and old. The  Piegan got off his horse, and the Snake chief came out and hugged him and  kissed him, and said: \"I am glad you have come to-day to my lodge. So are  my people. You are tired. Enter my lodge and we will eat.\" So they went  inside and many of the Snakes came in, and they had a great feast.    Then the Snake chief told his people how he had met the Piegan, and how  brave he was, and that now they were going to make a great peace; and he  sent some men to tell the people, so that they would be ready to move camp  in the morning. Evening came. Everywhere people were shouting out for  feasts, and the chief took Owl Bear to them. It was very late when they  returned. Then the Snake had one of his wives make a bed at the back of the  lodge; and when it was ready he said: \"Now, my friend, there is your  bed. This is now your lodge; also the woman who made the bed, she is now  your wife; also everything in this lodge is yours. The parfleches, saddles,  food, robes, bowls, everything is yours. I give them to you because you are  my friend and a brave man.\"    \"You give me too much,\" replied Owl Bear. \"I am ashamed, but I take your  words. I have nothing with me but one wife. She is yours.\"    Next morning camp was broken early. The horses were driven in, and the  Snake chief gave Owl Bear his whole band,--two hundred head, all large,  powerful horses.    All were now ready, and the chiefs started ahead. Close behind them were  all the warriors, hundreds and hundreds, and last came the women and  children, and the young men driving the loose horses. As they came in sight  of the Piegan camp, all the warriors started out to meet them, dressed in  their war costumes and singing the great war song. There was no wind, and  the sound came across the valley and up the hill like the noise of  thunder. Then the Snakes began to sing, and thus the two parties advanced.  At last they met. The Piegans turned and rode beside them, and so they came  to the camp. Then they got off their horses and kissed each other. Every  Piegan asked a Snake into his lodge to eat and rest, and the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11553"],[0,"The Wonders of Prayer (#3)"],[1,"made by our Lord to Satan, \"Thou shalt not  tempt the Lord, thy God,\" is surely applicable in all such cases. The  spirit of a \"sound mind\" (see 2 Tim. i., 7) will surely recognize this.    So in _all_ things, that which God has given me intelligence and power  to do, in avoiding evil or securing good, I am under direct command from  him to do, always depending upon His blessing to secure the needed  result. A _true faith_ in God will be made manifest by careful obedience  to known commands. An _intelligent_ faith can never allow dependence  upon means used to take the place of dependence upon the living God, who  alone makes them efficacious.    It must result in _presumptions_ faith, if obedience is neglected, and  the results only promised to obedience are expected. That God _can_ give  blessing, without the use of the ordinary means, on man's part, there is  no question. That he _has_ done so is a matter of record. Yet we should  remember that there were but _two_ miraculous draughts of fishes, and  _only twice_ did our Lord make bread without the use of seed-time,  harvest, grinding and baking. The _rule_ of Christ in his earthly  ministry was, most certainly, to receive the supply of his physical  wants from His Heavenly Father, in the use of means to secure the  results offered in the ordinary operation of the laws of God. He went  into the corn-field at autumn and visited the olive tree for sustenance  as did other men. And the question for his disciples is not what God  _can_ do, and not what he _has_ done (that he may be known as God over  all creation, blessed for evermore) in the suspension of natural laws,  but what has he revealed to us as his will during the time of the  present dispensation of the church on this earth, as to his children  using means for the avoidance of evil and securing of good, or depending  entirely upon miraculous interference in answer to the prayer of faith  for all need without reference to use of means.    Does the prayer, \"Give us this day our daily bread,\" mean that we are to  do nothing to secure our bread, lest we show no faith in God, and simply  wait in idleness for God to repeat the miracle of sending it by a  raven? or, does it mean that with thankful hearts to God for the ability  he has given us to work, that we go forth diligently fulfilling our task  in the use of all appropriate means to secure that which his loving  bounty has made possible for us in the fruitful seasons of the earth,  and return with devout recognition that He is the Creator, Upholder and  Giver of all, bringing our sheaves with us. When seed-time and harvest  fail and death is on the land, when corn fails in Egypt and there is no  bread, when _we have obeyed him_ and sought to toil with our hands and  no man has given unto us, then we will expect his interposition and will  have faith that he who has fed us by use of means, will supply us  without means, and that He alone is the living God.    It is noticeable that the prophet Elisha, whose prayers God heard in the  multiplication of the twenty loaves during the dearth at Gilgal, was  made Elijah's successor when following his twelve yoke of oxen at the  plough in the field, diligently using means to obtain bread, and  undoubtedly communing with God all the while and recognizing the  evidences of his love and power in every upturned daisy as he ploughed  the sod, and in every seed that he dropped into the fertile earth, and  thought it grand to be a fellow worker with God in the husbandry of the  earth and not one to be fed in idleness, neglecting the toil appointed  to man, and losing the blessing that is promised in the word of God, in  the discipline and the knowledge of God in the operations of His laws,  that comes in a greater or less degree to all of earth's honest toilers.    It is the opinion of many of God's children that as the present  dispensation draws to its close, there will be among the spiritually  minded and consecrated ones of the church, a reproduction of the gifts  of Pentecost for a last testimony to the world before Christ comes in  glory. There is much Scripture that might be quoted to sustain this  opinion. God grant in His grace and mercy that it may be so. But neither  the church or the world have any _claim_ upon God for it. The church has  abused grace and the world has despised mercy. All the promises as to  miracles wrought for a testimony as to the truth of Christ's  resurrection, have been fulfilled. If Christ were to come to-day, the  world would be without excuse in having rejected him, and could not  plead that signs and wonders had been abundantly wrought in His name in  the establishing of His church upon the earth.    The question of our Lord in Luke xviii., 8, \"When the son of man cometh  shall he find faith on the earth?\" suggests to many minds that there may  not be vouchsafed during the time immediately preceding his  manifestations, any marked interference by God in the way of miracles or  signs among his children, but that their faith in Him as the unseen God,  and their trust in the truth and verify of His word, will be brought  forth to the praise and glory of God and their joy, by their being left  to the _word alone_ and the operations of the Holy Ghost by and through  the word for their comfort and stability in the faith.    Coupled with this thought let it ever be borne in mind by the believer  that the testimony of God's word as to miracles, signs and wonders  wrought by _Satanic agency_ in the church, during the last day, is clear  and unmistakable, and warnings abound as to our danger from them.    \"The Spirit saith expressly that in later times some shall fall away  from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of  devils.\" 1 Tim. iv., 1.    \"But know this, that in the last days grievous times shall come.\" \"Evil  men and impostors shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being  deceived.\" 2 Tim. iii., 1 and 13.    \"Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no  great thing if his ministers be transformed as the ministers of  righteousness. 2 Cor. xi., 14.    \"And then shall that wicked be revealed. Even him whose coming is after  the working of Satan, _with all power, and signs_, and _lying wonders_;  and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish,  because they received not the love of the truth that they might be  saved.\" 2 Thess. ii., 8 to 10.    By these passages it is plain that a sign or a wonder does not establish  a doctrine or endorse a man as certainly being _from God_. The doctrine  and the man must be judged by the written word of God.    If there is ought in the doctrine that denies that Jesus is the Son of  God, that derogates in the slightest degree from the merit of His  atonement on the cross for our sins, or that takes the eye off from Him  as the risen and coming Lord, the alone object of our faith and hope, or  that dishonors in any way God's holy word, taking from or adding to it,  _then_ the more signs and wonders and manifestations of mysterious power  that there may be connected with it, then the more certainly we may know  that it is of Satan and not of God.    And if, in the man who exhibits signs and wonders, there is a spirit  contrary to the spirit of Christ, in his seeking honor from man, and  using his power to establish a claim to such honor, \"speaking of himself  as some great one,\" and not walking in humility as a sinner saved from  hell and kept day by day by the power of God through faith in Christ,  And if the purpose of his signs be to establish revelations he is  receiving in any form apart from the written word, then, though his  signs be as marvelous as those of the magicians in Egypt, or Simon  Magnus in Samaria, he is, like them, a minister of Satan and not a  minister of Jesus Christ.    The age abounds in doctrines and men of this kind. The life of faith  lays the soul open to assaults of the Devil by their agency.    \"Beloved try the spirits whether they be of God.\"    Let us not waver in our faith in God's overruling providence, and in the  reality of His interposition in answer to prayer for the deliverance and  help of his people under any and all circumstances. \"In _everything_, by  prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let our requests be made  known unto God,\" but let our first request be that we be kept in a sound  mind obedient to the word, and let _all of_ our requests close with the  utterance, from a sincere heart, of the words, \"Thy will be done.\" If  this be the attitude of our hearts our prayers shall be abundantly and  graciously answered, and God shall guide us from the wiles of the Evil  One for the sake of His dear Son Jesus Christ our Lord, through whose  precious blood we have all grace and all blessing.
