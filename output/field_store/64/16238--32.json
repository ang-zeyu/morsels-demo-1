[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13407"],[0,"A Series of Lessons in Gnani Yoga: The Yoga of Wisdom (#3)"],[1,"think of the Absolute as  Infinite in Space--present everywhere--Omnipresent. It cannot be  limited, for there is nothing outside of itself to limit it. There is  no such place as Nowhere. Every place is in the Everywhere. And  Everywhere is filled with the All--the Infinite Reality--the Absolute.    And, just as was the case with the idea of Time, we find it most  difficult--if not indeed impossible--to form an idea of an  Omnipresent--of That which occupies Infinite Space. This because  everything that our minds have experienced has had dimensions and  limits. The secret lies in the fact that Space, like Time, has no real  existence outside of our perception of consciousness of the relative  position of Things--material objects. We see this thing here, and that  thing there. Between them is Nothingness. We take another object, say a  yard-stick, and measure off this Nothingness between the two objects,  and we call this measure of Nothingness by the term Distance. And yet  we cannot have measured Nothingness--that is impossible. What have we  really done? Simply this, determined how many lengths of yard-stick  could be laid between the other two objects.    We call this process measuring Space, but Space is Nothing, and we have  merely determined the relative position of objects. To \"measure Space\"  we must have three Things or objects, _i.e._, (l) The object from which  we start the measure; (2) The object with which we measure; and (3) The  object with which we end our measurement. We are unable to conceive of  Infinite Space, because we lack the third object in the measuring  process--the ending object. We may use ourselves as a starting point,  and the mental yard-stick is always at hand, but where is the object at  the other side of Infinity of Space by which the measurement may be  ended? It is not there, and we cannot think of the end without it.    Let us start with ourselves, and try to imagine a million million  miles, and then multiply them by another million million miles, a  million million times. What have we done? Simply extended our mental  yard-stick a certain number of times to an imaginary point in the  Nothingness that we call Space. So far so good, but the mind  intuitively recognizes that beyond that imaginary point at the end of  the last yard-stick, there is a capacity for an infinite extension of  yard-sticks--an infinite capacity for such extension. Extension of  what? Space? No! Yard-sticks! Objects! Things! Without material objects  Space is unthinkable. It has no existence outside of our consciousness  of Things. There is no such thing as Real Space. Space is merely an  infinite capacity for extending objects. Space itself is merely a name  for Nothingness. If you can form an idea of an object swept out of  existence, and nothing to take its place, that Nothing would be called  Space, the term implying the possibility of placing something there  without displacing anything else.    Size, of course, is but another form of speaking of Distance. And in  this connection let us not forget that just as one may think of Space  being infinite in the direction of largeness, so may we think of it as  being infinite in the sense of smallness. No matter how small may be an  object thought of, we are still able to think of it as being capable of  subdivision, and so on infinitely. There is no limit in this direction  either. As Jakob has said: \"The conception of the infinitely minute is  as little capable of being grasped by us, as is that of the infinitely  great. Despite this, the admission of the reality of the infinitude,  both in the direction of greatness and of minuteness, is inevitable.\"    And, as Radenhausen has said: \"The idea of Space is only an unavoidable  illusion of our Consciousness, or of our finite nature, and does not  exist outside of ourselves; the universe is infinitely small and  infinitely great.\"    The telescope has opened to us ideas of magnificent vastness and  greatness, and the perfected microscope has opened to us a world of  magnificent smallness and minuteness. The latter has shown us that a  drop of water is a world of minute living forms who live, eat, fight,  reproduce, and die. The mind is capable of imagining a universe  occupying no more space than one million-millionth of the tiniest speck  visible under the strongest microscope--and then imagining such a  universe containing millions of suns and worlds similar to our own, and  inhabited by living forms akin to ours--living, thinking men and women,  identical in every respect to ourselves. Indeed, as some philosophers  have said, if our Universe were suddenly reduced to such a size--the  relative proportions of everything being preserved, of course--then we  would not be conscious of any change, and life would go on the same,  and we would be of the same importance to ourselves and to the Absolute  as we are this moment. And the same would be true were the Universe  suddenly enlarged a million-million times. These changes would make no  difference in reality. Compared with each other, the tiniest speck and  the largest sun are practically the same size when viewed from the  Absolute.    We have dwelt upon these things so that you would be able to better  realize the relativity of Space and Time, and perceive that they are  merely symbols of Things used by the mind in dealing with finite  objects, and have no place in reality. When this is realized, then the  idea of Infinity in Time and Space is more readily grasped.    As Radenhausen says: \"Beyond the range of human reason there is neither  Space nor Time; they are arbitrary conceptions of man, at which he has  arrived by the comparison and arrangement of different impressions  which he has received from the outside world. The conception of Space  arises from the sequence of the various forms which fill Space, by  which the external world appears to the individual man. The conception  of Time arises from the sequence of the various forms which change in  space (motion), by which the external world acts on the individual man,  and so on. But externally to ourselves, the distinction between  repletion of Space and mutation of Space does not exist, for each is in  constant transmutation, whatever is is filling and changing at the same  time--nothing is at a standstill,\" and to quote Ruckert: \"The world has  neither beginning nor end, in space nor in time. Everywhere is center  and turning-point, and in a moment is eternity.\"    Next, the Intellect informs us that we must think of the Absolute as  containing within Itself all the Power there is, because there can be  no other source or reservoir of Power, and there can be no Power  outside of the All-Power. There can be no Power outside of the Absolute  to limit, confine, or conflict with It. Any laws of the Universe must  have been imposed by It, for there is no other law-giver, and every  manifestation of Energy, Force, or Power, perceived or evident in  Nature must be a part of the Power of the Absolute working along lines  laid down by it. In the Third Lesson, which will be entitled The  Will-to-Live, we shall see this Power manifesting along the lines of  Life as we know it.    Next, the Intellect informs us that it is compelled to think of the  Absolute as containing within Itself all possible Knowledge or Wisdom,  because there can be no Knowledge or Wisdom outside of It, and  therefore all the Wisdom and Knowledge possible must be within It. We  see Mind, Wisdom, and Knowledge manifested by relative forms of Life,  and such must emanate from the Absolute in accordance with certain laws  laid down by It, for otherwise there would be no such wisdom, etc., for  there is nowhere outside of the All from whence it could come. The  effect cannot be greater than the cause. If there is anything unknown  to the Absolute, then it will never be known to finite minds. So,  therefore, ALL KNOWLEDGE that Is, Has Been, or Can Be, must be NOW  vested in the One--the Absolute.    This does not mean that the Absolute _thinks_, in any such sense as  does Man. The Absolute must Know, without Thinking. It does not have to  gather Knowledge by the process of Thinking, as does Man--such an Idea  would be ridiculous, for from whence could the Knowledge come outside  of itself. When man thinks he draws to himself Knowledge from the  Universal source by the action of the Mind, but the Absolute has only  itself to draw on. So we cannot imagine the Absolute compelled to Think  as we do.    But, lest we be misunderstood regarding this phase of the subject, we  may say here that the highest occult teachings inform us that the  Absolute _does_ manifest a quality somewhat akin to what we would call  constructive thought, and that such \"thoughts\" manifest into  objectivity and manifestation, and become Creation. Created Things,  according to the Occult teachings are \"Thoughts of God.\" Do not let  this idea disturb you, and cause you to feel that you are nothing,  because you have been called into being by a Thought of the Infinite  One. Even a Thought of that One would be intensely real in the relative  world--actually Real to all except the Absolute itself--and even the  Absolute knows that the _Real_ part of its Creations must be a part of  itself manifested through its thought, for the Thought of the Infinite  must be Real, and a part of Itself, for it cannot be anything else, and  to call it Nothing is merely to juggle with words. The faintest Thought  of the Infinite One would be far more real than anything man could  create--as solid as the mountain--as hard as steel--as durable as the  diamond--for, verily, even these are emanations of the Mind of the  Infinite, and are things of but a day, while the higher Thoughts--the  soul of Man--contains within itself a spark from the Divine Flame  itself--the Spirit of the Infinite. But these things will appear in  their own place, as we proceed with this series.

Song 14.  _Examples of early piety_.    1 What blest examples do I find  Writ in the Word of Truth,  Of children that began to mind  Religion in their youth.    2 Jesus, who reigns above the skie,  And keeps the world in awe;  Was once a child as young as I,  And kept his Father's law.    3 At twelve years old he talk'd with men,  (The Jews all wondering stand;)  Yet he obey'd his Mother then,  And came at her command.    4 Children a sweet hosanna sung,  And blest their Saviour's name;  They gave him honour with their tongue  While scribes and priests blaspheme.    5 Samuel the child was wean'd, and brought  To wait upon the Lord;  Young Timothy betimes was taught  To know his holy Word.    6 Then why should I so long delay  What others learn so soon?  I would not pass another day  Without this work begun.      Song 15.  _Against Lying_.    1 O `tis a lovely thing for youth  To walk betimes in wisdom's way;  To fear a lye, to speak the truth,  That we may trust to all they say.    2 But lyars we can never trust,  Though they should speak the thing that's true,  And he that does one fault at first,  And lyes to hide it, makes it two.    3 Have we not known, nor heard, nor read,  How God abhors deceit and wrong?  How Ananias was struck dead  Catch'd with a lye upon his tongue?    4 So did his wife Sapphira die  When she came in, and grew so bold  As to confirm that wicked lye  That just before her husband told.    5 The Lord delights in them that speak  The words of truth; but every lyar  Must have his portion in the lake  That burns with brimstone and with fire.    6 Then let me always watch my lips,  Lest I be struck to death and hell,  Since God a book of reckoning keeps  For every lye that children tell.      Song 16.  _Against Quarrelling and Fighting_.    1 Let dogs delight to bark and bite,  For God has made them so;  Let bears and lyons growl and fight,  For `tis their nature too.    2 But, children, you should never let  Such angry passions rise;  Your little hands were never made  To tear each other's eyes.    3 Let love thro' all your actions run,  And all your words be mild;  Live like the blessed Virgin's Son,  That sweet and lovely child.    4 His soul was gentle as a lamb;  And as his stature grew,  He grew in favour both with man  And God his Father too.    5 Now, Lord of all, he reigns above,  And from his heavenly throne,  He sees what children dwell in love,  And marks them for his own.      Song 17.  _Love between Brothers and Sisters_.    1 What ever brawls are in the street  There should be peace at home;  Where sisters dwell and brothers meet  Quarrels shou'd never come.    2 Birds in their little nests agree;  And `tis a shameful sight,  When children of one family  Fall out, and chide, and fight.    3 Hard names at first, and threatening words,  That are but noisy breath,  May grow to clubs and naked swords,  To murder and to death.    4 The devil tempts one mother's son  To rage against another:  So wicked Cain was hurried on,  Till he had kill'd his brother.    5 The wise will make their anger cool  At least before `tis night;  But in the bosom of a fool  It burns till morning light.    5 Pardon, O Lord, our childish rage;  Our little brawls remove;  That as we grow to riper age,  Our hearts may all be love.      Song 18.  _Against Scoffing and calling Names_.    1 Our tongues were made to bless the Lord,  And not speak ill of men:  When others give a railing word,  We must not rail again.    2 Cross words and angry names require  To be chastiz'd at school;  And he's in danger of hell-fire,  That calls his brother, fool.    3 But lips that dare be so prophane  To mock and jeer and scoff  At holy things, or holy men,  The Lord shall cut them off.    4 When children, in their wanton play  Served old Elisha so,  And bade the prophet go his way,  \"Go up, thou bald head, go.\"    5 God quickly stopt their wicked breath,  And sent two raging bears,  That tore them limb from limb to death,  With blood and groans and tears.    6 Great God, how terrible art thou  To sinners ne'er so young!  Grant me thy grace and teach me how  To tame and rule my tongue.      Song 19.  _Against Swearing and Cursing, and taking God's Name in vain_.    1 Angels that high in glory dwell  Adore thy Name, Almighty God!  And devils tremble down in hell  Beneath the terrors of thy rod.    2 And yet how wicked children dare  Abuse thy dreadful glorious Name!  And when they're angry, how they swear,  And curse their fellows, and blaspheme!    3 How will they stand before thy face,  Who treated thee with such disdain,  While thou shalt doom them to the place  Of everlasting fire and pain?    4 Then never shall one cooling drop  To quench their burning tongues be giv'n.  But I will praise thee here, and hope  Thus to employ my tongue in heav'n.    5 My heart shall be in pain to hear  Wretches affront the Lord above;  'Tis that great God whose power I fear,  That heavenly Father whom I love.    6 If my companions grow profane,  I'll leave their friendship when I hear  Young sinners take thy name in vain,  And learn to curse, and learn to swear.      Song 20.  _Against Idleness and Mischief_.    1 How doth the little busy bee  Improve each shining hour,  And gather honey all the day  From every opening flower!    2 How skilfully she builds her cell!  How neat she spreads the wax!  And labours hard to store it well  With the sweet food she makes.    3 In works of labour or of skill  I would be busy too:  For Satan finds some mischief still  For idle hands to do.    4 In books, or work, or healthful play  Let my first years be past,  That I may give for every day  Some good account at last.      Song 21.  _Against evil Company_.    1 Why should I join with those in play  In whom I've no delight;  Who curse and swear, but never play;  Who call ill names, and fight?    2 I hate to hear a wanton song:  Their words offend my ears:  I should not dare defile my tongue  With language such as theirs.    3 Away from fools I'll turn my eyes,  Nor with the scoffers go:  I would be walking with the wise,  That wiser I may grow.    4 From one rude boy, that's used to mock,  They learn the wicked jest:  One sickly sheep infects the flock,  And poisons all the rest.    5 My God, I hate to walk or dwell  With sinful children here:  Then let me not be sent to hell,  Where none but sinners are.      Song 22.  _Against Pride in Clothes_.    1 Why should our garments, made to hide  Our parents' shame, provoke our pride?  The art of dress did ne'er begin  Till Eve our mother learnt to sin.    2 When first she put the covering on,  Her robe of innocence was gone;  And yet her children vainly boast  In the sad marks of glory lost.    3 How proud we are! how fond to shew  Our clothes, and call them rich and new,  When the poor sheep and silkworms wore  That very clothing long before!    4 The tulip and the butterfly  Appear in gayer coats than I:  Let me be dress'd fine as I will,  Flies, worms, and flowers exceed me still.    5 Then will I set my heart to find  Inward adornings of the mind:  Knowledge and virtue, truth and grace,  These are the robes of richest dress.    6 No more shall worms with me compare,  This is the raiment angels wear:  The Son of God, when here below,  Put on this blest apparel too.    6 It never fades, it ne'er grows old,  Nor fears the rain, nor moth, nor mould:  It takes no spot, but still refines;  The more `tis worn, the more it shines.    7 In this on earth would I appear,  Then go to heaven, and wear it there:  God will approve it in his sight;  'Tis his own work, and his delight.      Song 23.  _Obedience to Parents_.    1 Let children that would fear the Lord  Hear what their teachers say;  With reverence meet their parents' word,  And with delight obey.    2 Have you not heard what dreadful plagues  Are threaten'd by the Lord,  To him that breaks his father's law,  Or mocks his mother's word?    3 What heavy guilt upon him lies!  How cursed is his name!  The ravens shall pick out his eyes,  And eagles eat the same.    4 But those who worship God, and give  Their parents honour due,  Here on this earth they long shall live,  And live hereafter, too.      Song 24.  _The Child's Complaint_.    1 Why should I love my sports so well,  So constant at my play,  And lose the thoughts of heaven and hell,  And then forget to pray?    2 What do I read my Bible for,  But, Lord, to learn thy will?  And shall I daily know thee more,  And less obey thee still?    3 How senseless is my heart, and wild!  How vain are all my thoughts!  Pity the weakness of a child,  And pardon all my faults.    4 Make me thy heavenly voice to hear,  And let me love to pray;  Since God will lend a gracious ear  To what a child can say.      Song 25.  _A Morning Song_.    1 My God, who makes the sun to know  His proper hour to rise;  And, to give light to all below,  Doth send him round the skies:    2 When from the chambers of the east  His morning race begins,  He never tires, nor stops to rest,  But round the world he shines.    3 So, like the sun, would I fulfil  The business of the day;  Begin my work betimes, and still  March on my heavenly way.    4 Give me, O Lord, thy early grace,  Nor let my soul complain  That the young morning of my day  Has all been spent in vain!      Song 26.  _An Evening Song_.    1 And now another day is gone,  I'll sing my Maker's praise!  My comforts every hour make known  His providence and grace.    2 But how my childhood runs to waste  My sins how great their sum!  Lord, give me pardon for the past,  And strength for days to come.    3 I lay my body down to sleep,  Let angels guard my head;  And, through the hours of darkness, keep  Their"]]]
