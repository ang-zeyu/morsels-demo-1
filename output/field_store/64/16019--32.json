Moreover, he  had never asked anything like it of the fairy Pari Banou, but was  satisfied with her continual kindness; therefore he was in the  greatest embarrassment what answer to make. At last he replied,  'If, sir, I have concealed from your majesty what happened to me  and what course I took after finding my arrow, the reason was that  I thought it was of no great importance to you to be informed of  them; and though I know not how this mystery has been revealed to  you, I cannot deny that your information is correct. I have married  the fairy you speak of. I love her, and am persuaded she loves me.  But I can say nothing as to the influence your majesty believes I  have over her. It is what I have not yet made any experiment of or  thought of, and should be very glad if you would dispense with my  undertaking it, and let me enjoy the happiness of loving and being  beloved with all the disinterestedness I proposed to myself. But  the demand of a father is a command upon every child who, like me,  thinks it his duty to obey him in everything. And though it is with  the greatest reluctance imaginable, I will not fail to ask my wife  the favour your majesty desires, but will not promise to obtain it;  and if I should not have the honour to come again to pay you my  respects, that shall be the sign that I have not had success: but I  desire you to forgive me beforehand, and consider that you yourself  have reduced me to this extremity.'    'Son,' replied the Sultan of the Indies, 'I should be very sorry  that what I ask of you should prevent my ever seeing you again. Go,  only ask her. Think with yourself, that as you love her, you could  refuse her nothing; therefore, if she loves you, she will not deny  your request.'    All this discourse of the Sultan of the Indies could not persuade  Prince Ahmed, who would rather he had asked anything than the risk  of displeasing his dear Pari Banou; and so great was his vexation,  that he left the court two days sooner than usual.    When he returned, the fairy, to whom he had always before appeared  with a cheerful countenance, asked him the reason of the  alteration; and finding that instead of answering her, he inquired  after her health to avoid satisfying her, she said to him, 'I will  answer your question when you have answered mine.' The prince  declined it a long time, protesting that nothing was the matter  with him; but the more he denied it, the more she pressed him, and  said, 'I cannot bear to see you in this condition: tell me what  makes you so uneasy, that I may remove the cause of it, whatever it  may be; for it must be very extraordinary if it is out of my  power.'    Prince Ahmed could not long withstand the fairy. 'Madam,' said he,  'God prolong the sultan my father's life, and bless him to the end  of his days. I left him alive, and in perfect health: therefore  that is not the cause of the melancholy you perceive in me. The  sultan has imposed upon me the disagreeable task of worrying you.  You know the care I have taken, with your approbation, to conceal  from him my happiness at home with you. How he has been informed of  it I cannot tell.'    Here the fairy Pari Banou interrupted Prince Ahmed, and said, 'But  I know. Remember what I told you of the woman who made you believe  she was ill, on whom you took so much compassion. It is she who has  acquainted the sultan your father with what you took so much care  to hide from him. I told you that she was no more sick than you or  I, for, after the two women whom I charged to take care of her had  given her the water sovereign against all fevers, which, however,  she had no occasion for, she pretended that the water had cured  her, and was brought to take leave of me, that she might go sooner  to give an account of the success of her undertaking. She was in so  much haste that she would have gone away without seeing my palace,  if I had not, by bidding my two women show it her, given her to  understand that it was worth her seeing. But go on and tell me what  is the necessity your father has imposed on you which has made you  feel troublesome to me, which I desire you will be persuaded you  can never be.'    'Madam,' pursued Prince Ahmed, 'you may have observed that hitherto  I have never asked you any favour, for what, after the possession  of so kind a wife, can I desire more? I know how great your power  is, but I have taken care not to make trial of it. Consider then, I  beg you, that it is not me, but the sultan my father, who,  indiscreetly, as I think, asks of you a pavilion large enough to  shelter him, his court, and his army, from the violence of the  weather, when he takes the field, and yet small enough for a man to  carry in his hand. Once more remember it is not I, but the sultan  my father who asks this favour.'    'Prince,' replied the fairy, smiling, 'I am sorry that so small a  matter should disturb you, and make you so uneasy. I see plainly  two things have contributed towards it: one is, the law you have  imposed upon yourself, to be content with loving me and being  beloved by me, and to deny yourself the liberty of asking me the  least favour that might try my power. The other, I do not doubt,  whatever you may say, was that you thought what your father asked  of me was out of my power. As to the first, I commend you for it,  and shall love you the better, if possible; and for the second, I  must tell you that what the sultan your father asks of me is a  trifle; and upon occasion, I can do much more difficult things.  Therefore be easy, and persuaded that, far from feeling worried, I  shall always take great pleasure in whatever you can desire me to  do for your sake.' Then the fairy sent for her treasurer, to whom  she said 'Nourgihan' (which was her name), 'bring me the largest  pavilion in my treasury.' Nourgihan returned presently with a  pavilion, which could not only be held but concealed in the palm of  the hand when it was closed, and presented it to her mistress, who  gave it to Prince Ahmed to look at.    When Prince Ahmed saw the pavilion, which the fairy called the  largest in her treasury, he fancied she was joking, and his  surprise appeared in his face. Pari Banou burst out laughing.  'What! Prince,' cried she, 'do you think I jest with you? You will  see presently that I am in earnest. Nourgihan' said she to her  treasurer, taking the tent out of Prince Ahmed's hands, 'go and set  it up, that the prince may judge whether the sultan his father will  think it large enough.'    The treasurer immediately went out from the palace, and carried it  to such a distance that when she had set it up one end reached to  the palace. The prince, so far from thinking it small, found it  large enough to shelter two armies as numerous as that of the  sultan his father; and then said to Pari Banou, 'I ask my princess  a thousand pardons for my incredulity: after what I have seen, I  believe there is nothing impossible to you.'    'You see,' said the fairy, 'that the pavilion is larger than your  father may have occasion for; but you are to observe that it  becomes larger or smaller, according to the army it is to cover,  without being touched.'    The treasurer took down the tent again, reduced it to its first  size, and brought it and put it into the prince's hands. He took  it, and next day mounted his horse and went with the usual  attendants to the sultan his father.    The sultan, who was persuaded that such a tent as he asked for was  beyond all possibility, was in great surprise at the prince's  diligence. He took the tent and admired its smallness. But when he  had set it up in the great plain, and found it large enough to  shelter an army twice as large as he could bring into the field,  his amazement was so great that he could not recover himself. As he  thought this might be troublesome in use, Prince Ahmed told him  that its size would always be proportionate to his army.    To outward appearance the sultan expressed great obligation to the  prince his son for so noble a present, desiring him to return his  thanks to the fairy Pari Banou; and to show what a value he set on  it, he ordered it to be carefully laid up in his treasury. But  within himself he became more jealous than ever; considering that  by the fairy's assistance the prince his son might perform things  that were infinitely above his own power, notwithstanding his  greatness and riches; and, therefore, more intent upon his ruin, he  went to consult the magician again, who advised him to request the  prince to bring him some of the water of the fountain of lions.    In the evening, when the sultan was surrounded as usual by all his  court, and the prince came to pay his respects among the rest, he  said to him: 'Son, I have already expressed how much I am obliged  to you for the present of the tent you have procured me, which I  look upon as the most valuable thing in my treasury; but you must  do one thing more for me. I am informed that the fairy your wife  makes use of a certain water, called the water of the fountain of  lions, which cures all sorts of fevers, even the most dangerous;  and as I am perfectly sure that my health is dear to you, I do not  doubt that you will ask her for a bottle of that water for me, and  bring it me as a sovereign remedy, which I may make use of when I  have occasion. Do me this service, and complete the duty of a good  son towards a tender father.'    Prince Ahmed, who had believed that the sultan his father would  have been satisfied with so singular and useful a tent as that  which he had brought, and that he would not have imposed any new  task upon him which might hazard the fairy's displeasure; was  thunderstruck at this new request, notwithstanding the assurance  she had given him of granting him whatever lay in her power. After  a long silence, he said, 'I beg"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8642"],[0,"Woman in the Nineteenth Century (#20)"],[1,"department of instruction for the new era, and the harmony in  action, and freedom for individual growth, he hopes, shall exist; and,  if the methods he proposes should not prove the true ones, yet his  fair propositions shall give many hints, and make room for the  inspiration needed for such.    He, too, places Woman on an entire equality with Man, and wishes to  give to one as to the other that independence which must result from  intellectual and practical development.    Those who will consult him for no other reason, might do so to see how  the energies of Woman may be made available in the pecuniary way. The  object of Fourier was to give her the needed means of self-help, that  she might dignify and unfold her life for her own happiness, and that  of society. The many, now, who see their daughters liable to  destitution, or vice to escape from it, may be interested to examine  the means, if they have not yet soul enough to appreciate the ends he  proposes.    On the opposite side of the advancing army leads the great apostle of  individual culture, Goethe. Swedenborg makes organization and union  the necessary results of solitary thought. Fourier, whose nature was,  above all, constructive, looked to them too exclusively. Better  institutions, he thought, will make better men. Goethe expressed, in  every way, the other side. If one man could present better forms, the  rest could not use them till ripe for them.    Fourier says, As the institutions, so the men! All follies are  excusable and natural under bad institutions.    Goethe thinks, As the man, so the institutions! There is no excuse for  ignorance and folly. A man can grow in any place, if he will.    Ay! but, Goethe, bad institutions are prison-walls and impure air,  that make him stupid, so that he does not will.    And thou, Fourier, do not expect to change mankind at once, or even  \"in three generations,\" by arrangement of groups and series, or  flourish of trumpets for attractive industry. If these attempts are  made by unready men, they will fail.    Yet we prize the theory of Fourier no less than the profound  suggestion of Goethe. Both are educating the age to a clearer  consciousness of what Man needs, what Man can be; and better life must  ensue.    Goethe, proceeding on his own track, elevating the human being, in the  most imperfect states of society, by continual efforts at  self-culture, takes as good care of women as of men. His mother, the  bold, gay Frau Aja, with such playful freedom of nature; the wise and  gentle maiden, known in his youth, over whose sickly solitude \"the  Holy Ghost brooded as a dove;\" his sister, the intellectual woman  _par excellence_; the Duchess Amelia; Lili, who combined the  character of the woman of the world with the lyrical sweetness of the  shepherdess, on whose chaste and noble breast flowers and gems were  equally at home; all these had supplied abundant suggestions to his  mind, as to the wants and the possible excellences of Woman. And from  his poetic soul grew up forms new and more admirable than life has yet  produced, for whom his clear eye marked out paths in the future.    In Faust Margaret represents the redeeming power, which, at present,  upholds Woman, while waiting for a better day. The lovely little girl,  pure in instinct, ignorant in mind, is misled and profaned by man  abusing her confidence.[Footnote: As Faust says, her only fault was a  \"kindly delusion,\"--\"ein guter wahn.\"] To the Mater _Dolorosa_  she appeals for aid. It is given to the soul, if not against outward  sorrow; and the maiden, enlightened by her sufferings, refusing to  receive temporal salvation by the aid of an evil power, obtains the  eternal in its stead.    In the second part, the intellectual man, after all his manifold  strivings, owes to the interposition of her whom he had betrayed  _his_ salvation. She intercedes, this time, herself a glorified  spirit, with the Mater _Gloriosa_.    Leonora, too, is Woman, as we see her now, pure, thoughtful, refined  by much acquaintance with grief.    Iphigenia he speaks of in his journals as his \"daughter,\" and she is  the daughter [Footnote: Goethe was as false to his ideas, in practice,  as Lord Herbert. And his punishment was the just and usual one of  connections formed beneath the standard of right, from the impulses of  the baser self. Iphigenia was the worthy daughter of his mind; but the  son, child of his degrading connection in actual life, corresponded  with that connection. This son, on whom Goethe vainly lavished so much  thought and care, was like his mother, and like Goethe's attachment  for his mother. \"This young man,\" says a late well-informed writer (M.  Henri Blaze), \"Wieland, with good reason, called the son of the  servant, _der Sohn der Magd_. He inherited from his father only  his name and his _physique_.\"] whom a man will wish, even if he  has chosen his wife from very mean motives. She is the virgin,  steadfast, soul, to whom falsehood is more dreadful than any other  death.    But it is to Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship and Wandering Years that  I would especially refer, as these volumes contain the sum of the  Sage's observations during a long life, as to what Man should do,  under present circumstances, to obtain mastery over outward, through  an initiation into inward life, and severe discipline of faculty.    As Wilhelm advances into the upward path, he becomes acquainted with  better forms of Woman, by knowing how to seek, and how to prize them  when found. For the weak and immature man will, often, admire a  superior woman, but he will not be able to abide by a feeling which is  too severe a tax on his habitual existence. But, with Wilhelm, the  gradation is natural, and expresses ascent in the scale of being. At  first, he finds charm in Mariana and Philina, very common forms of  feminine character, not without redeeming traits, no less than charms,  but without wisdom or purity. Soon he is attended by Mignon, the  finest expression ever yet given to what I have called the lyrical  element in Woman. She is a child, but too full-grown for this man; he  loves, but cannot follow her; yet is the association not without an  enduring influence. Poesy has been domesticated in his life; and,  though he strives to bind down her heavenward impulse, as art or  apothegm, these are only the tents, beneath which he may sojourn for a  while, but which may be easily struck, and carried on limitless  wanderings.    Advancing into the region of thought, he encounters a wise  philanthropy in Natalia (instructed, let us observe, by an  _uncle_); practical judgment and the outward economy of life in  Theresa; pure devotion in the Fair Saint.    Further, and last, he comes to the house of Macaria, the soul of a  star; that is, a pure and perfected intelligence embodied in feminine  form, and the centre of a world whose members revolve harmoniously  around her. She instructs him in the archives of a rich human history,  and introduces him to the contemplation of the heavens.    From the hours passed by the side of Mariana to these with Macaria, is  a wide distance for human feet to traverse. Nor has Wilhelm travelled  so far, seen and suffered so much, in vain, He now begins to study how  he may aid the next generation; he sees objects in harmonious  arrangement, and from his observations deduces precepts by which to  guide his course as a teacher and a master, \"help-full, comfort-full.\"    In all these expressions of Woman, the aim of Goethe is satisfactory  to me. He aims at a pure self-subsistence, and a free development of  any powers with which they may be gifted by nature as much for them as  for men. They are units, addressed as souls. Accordingly, the meeting  between Man and Woman, as represented by him, is equal and noble; and,  if he does not depict marriage, he makes it possible.    In the Macaria, bound with the heavenly bodies in fixed revolutions,  the centre of all relations, herself unrelated, he expresses the  Minerva side of feminine nature. It was not by chance that Goethe gave  her this name. Macaria, the daughter of Hercules, who offered herself  as a victim for the good of her country, was canonized by the Greeks,  and worshipped as the Goddess of true Felicity. Goethe has embodied  this Felicity as the Serenity that arises from Wisdom, a Wisdom such  as the Jewish wise man venerated, alike instructed in the designs of  heaven, and the methods necessary to carry them into effect upon  earth.    Mignon is the electrical, inspired, lyrical nature.  And wherever it  appears we echo in our aspirations that of the child,      \"So let me seem until I be:--     Take not the _white robe_ away.\"           *       *       *       *       *      \"Though I lived without care and toil,     Yet felt I sharp pain enough to     Make me again forever young.\"      All these women, though we see them in relations, we can think of as  unrelated. They all are very individual, yet seem nowhere restrained.  They satisfy for the present, yet arouse an infinite expectation.    The economist Theresa, the benevolent Natalia, the fair Saint, have  chosen a path, but their thoughts are not narrowed to it. The  functions of life to them are not ends, but suggestions.    Thus, to them, all things are important, because none is necessary.  Their different characters have fair play, and each is beautiful in  its minute indications, for nothing is enforced or conventional; but  everything, however slight, grows from the essential life of the  being.    Mignon and Theresa wear male attire when they like, and it is graceful  for them to do so, while Macaria is confined to her arm-chair behind  the green curtain, and the Fair Saint could not bear a speck of dust  on her robe.    All things are in their places in this little world, because all is  natural and free, just as \"there is room for everything out of doors.\"  Yet all is rounded in by natural harmony,"]]]
