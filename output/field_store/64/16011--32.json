Arrived in the harbour,  we saluted them with our small-arms, and went on board to pay respects  and exchange congratulations. King then gave us a hospitable  entertainment, and we all repaired on shore.    The same evening a thundering salute from the Mahi was fired, to  assure the Somali we were travelling under the auspices of the British  Government, and King departed with his vessel.    Lieutenant Burton now took occupation of the centre tent with Herne,  and the party was complete.    We were then severally appointed to our respective duties, Lieutenant  Burton commanding; Stroyan chief surveyor; Herne, photographer,  geologist, and assistant-surveyor; whilst I was to be a  Jack-of-all-trades, assisting everybody, looking after the interests  of the men, portioning out their rations, setting the guards, and  collecting specimens of natural history in all its branches. The  central tent was fixed as a place of rendezvous for all to flock to in  case of any sudden alarm. Here I appended my guns and sword, whilst my  revolver-pistol and dirk were placed within my belt by day, or under  my pillow by night. I made the whole guard sleep with their arms in  rear of the camp, where it was most likely any attack might be  expected. As so many men were necessarily brought on duty by watching  the cattle grazing in the day-time, I only posted two sentries by  night to watch the camp--one with the guard in the rear, the other  over the cattle in front; whilst we Englishmen and the Balyuz  occasionally patrolled the camp to see that the sentries were on the  alert.    9th.--On this day the Gugi, or south-west Somali monsoon, in  opposition to the Dairti, or north-east monsoon, commenced in the  hills behind our camp, and warned us that we should soon have to start  southwards. The fair had already begun to break. Caravan after caravan  streamed out of the town, wending their way across the plain like  strings of ants emerging from a hole, and, like the busy habits of  those little insects, kept the whole maritime plain alive in motion.  At this time we were daily expecting a vessel from Aden, which would  bring us some letters and instruments that were on their way out from  England, and saw the great Ugahden caravan preparing to leave, but  were undecided what to do--whether to go with them without our things  from England, or wait and rely upon our strength in travelling alone.  The latter alternative was unfortunately decided upon, and we saw our  wonted protector depart upon its journey.    15th.--Saw the shore and harbour, alike both destitute of any living  thing, save a few diseased and dying cattle, and one poor forlorn  girl, in whom the smallpox had begun to show its symptoms, and who was  now mercilessly left by her parents, with only two or three days'  provisions, to die like a dog on the inhospitable plain. Having  suffered from that disease myself, and not fearing contagion, I went  to her and administered some medicine, which she took without any  hesitation; and I hoped to cure her, for she was really, barring the  blackness, a very pretty creature, but the disease was beyond my skill  to relieve. I then took her to a room in the tomb of an Arab sheikh,  gave her some rice-water, and bade her keep out of the sun, but it was  no use. She took fright at the idea of living with the dead, and  wandered into the desert no one knows whither, and was seen no more.  So completely was Berbera cleared out now, that even the matting and  sticks which formed the booths, with two or three exceptions, were  packed on the camels and carried away. We were now alone, and nobody  came near us; our two Abbans had begged and obtained permission to go  with their families to their homes in the hills close by, in company  with the retiring caravans, leaving their sons for the time being, as  substitutes, until we marched past their abodes.    In this isolated position we felt no alarm for our safety, as long at  least as we remained upon the sea-shore, deeming the Somali would  never be so imprudent as to attack us in such a vital place to them as  Berbera, where their whole interests of life were centred, and where,  by the simple process of blockading, we could so easily take  retribution in any way we liked.    So confident were we in this assumption, that we did not take the  precaution of standing sentry ourselves at night, thinking it more  prudent to nurse our strength whilst here, to be better able to hold  out when it would become necessary after our leaving the sea-shore.    Though Somali are cunning as foxes, they are not wise.    On the 18th April, by a providential coincidence, a small Arab vessel  came into the deserted harbour to see if anything still remained of  the fair. In her there were several men and four women, Somali,  desirous of going to their homes. Finding we were the only people  left, and not daring to travel in that country alone, they petitioned  us to take them with us. It was hard to refuse these poor creatures;  but fearing our supply of dates and rice would not hold out with so  many additional mouths to eat it, we reluctantly refused the men. The  four women, however, on their engaging to do the minor offices of the  camp, to bring water, and lead the camels, were permitted to remain  with us. That evening we invited the captain and his crew to dine in  the camp; and it was fortunate that we did so, as the sequel will  show. Shortly after sundown, as we were all sitting in our usual way,  on an extempore divan in front of the tents, drinking coffee, telling  stories, and enjoying the cool sea evening breezes, a challenge was  heard by the sentinel placed on the rear right of the camp, followed  by a sudden and rapid discharge of musketry, which took us by  surprise. I had previously given strict orders that no ammunition was  to be wasted in firing to frighten, or giving false alarms; therefore,  hearing this, I instantly ran to the spot to see what was the matter,  and found three men walking quietly into camp, leading ponies by their  reins, whilst the guard, to intimidate them, were firing bullets in  the air immediately over their heads. My anger knew no bounds. All  hopes of security seemed annihilated by such direct disobedience to  all order, and persistence in such a false principle as trying to  frighten, which all black men, by a sort of natural instinct,  invariably endeavour to do. I then assembled the men, and in presence  of the intruders again proclaimed through the Balyuz my intention to  punish with severity any person who might create a false alarm or fire  a bullet vacantly in the air; directing that, in case of any  opposition to a challenge, they should fire into, and not over, their  object.    I then sent the Balyuz and the three newly-arrived men round to the  front of the camp, where Lieutenant Burton and the other two officers  were sitting, to be interrogated as to the purpose of their visit. We  all at first naturally suspected them of being spies sent to inspect  our dispositions and resources; but after a long palaver with  Lieutenant Burton, he concluded that their coming there was  accidental, and not designed. True to their nature as Easterns, who  from constant practice can forge lies with far greater facility to  themselves than they can speak simple truths, bringing in with the  readiest aptitude the application of immediate circumstances to  harmonise appropriately in the development of their tale, these men at  once made use of the circumstance of the arrival of the vessel that  evening, saying they merely came down to ascertain if the ship was not  full of building material, as it was currently reported amongst their  clan, the Habr Owel, that their old enemy, Shermarkey, the chief of  Zeylah, was lying with other vessels in the port of Siyareh, waiting  an opportunity to land at Berbera and take occupation of the place by  building forts, as he had done on previous occasions. This story  seemed the more probable from the fact that everybody knew Shermarkey  wished to have the place, and that he would at any time have taken it,  had it lain within his power to do so.    The more to impose on our credulity, they further asked, with an air  of indignation, \"How could you suspect us of any treacherous  intentions towards you, when you know us to be men of the same tribe  as your Abbans?\" The palaver over, these wolves in sheep's clothing  were allowed to sup on dates with our men, and depart at their  pleasure.    At the usual hour we all turned in to sleep, and silence reigned  throughout the camp. A little after midnight, probably at one or two  A.M., there suddenly arose a furious noise, as though the world were  coming to end: there was a terrible rush and hurry, then came sticks  and stones, flying as thick as hail, followed by a rapid discharge of  firearms, and my tent shook as if it would come down. I bounced out of  bed, with pistol and dirk in hand, and ran across to the central tent  to know what was the matter, and if we were to have any shooting.  Lieutenant Burton, who was occupied in trying to load his revolver,  replied there was:[29] \"Be sharp, and arm to defend the camp.\" This I  immediately did, stepping out in front of his tent; but though I saw  many dusky forms before me, it was too dark to discern whether they  were friend or foe.    Whilst standing, in hesitation how to act, stones kept whizzing over  and around me, and I received a blow with one in the inside of my  knee, which nearly knocked my leg from under me; it came from the  left, where I had not been looking. I then ran under lee of the fly of  the tent to take a better survey, and, by stooping low, could perceive  the heads of some men peeping like monkeys over the boxes. Lieutenant  Burton now said, \"Don't step back, or they will think we are  retiring.\" Chagrined by this rebuke at my management"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8419"],[0,"The Journals of Lewis and Clark, 1804-1806 (#20)"],[1,"time of observation and are of course the double  altitudes of the objects observed.    2ed--A common Octant of 14 Inches radius, graduated to 20', which by  means of the nonius was devisbile to 1', half of this sum, or 30\" was  perceptible by means of a micrometer. this instrument was prepared for  both the fore and back observation; her error in the fore observation  is 2 deg.+, & and in the back observtion 2 deg. r 1' 40.3\" + at the time of our  departure from the River Dubois untill the present moment, the sun's  altitude at noon has been too great to be reached with my sextant, for  this purpose I have therefore employed the Octant by the back  observation. the degrees ' & \", recorded for the sun's altitude by the  back observation express only the angle given by the graduated limb of  the instrument at the time of observation, and are the complyment of  the double Altitude of the sun's observed limb; if therefore the angle  recorded be taken from 180 deg. the remainder will be the double altitude of  the observed object, or that which would be given by the fore  observation with a reflecting surface.    3rd--An Artificial Horizon on the construction recommended and  practiced by Mr. Andrw. Ellicott of Lancaster, Pensyla., in which water  is used as the reflecting surface; believing this artificial Horizon  liable to less error than any other in my possession, I have uniformly  used it when the object observed was sufficiently bright to reflect a  distinct immage; but as much light is lost by reflection from water I  found it inconvenient in most cases to take the altitude of the moon  with this horizon, and that of a star impracticable with any degree of  accuracy.    4th--An Artificial Horizon constructed in the manner recommended by Mr.  Patterson of Philadelphia; glass is here used as the reflecting  surface. this horizon consists of a glass plane with a single  reflecting surface, cemented to the flat side of the larger segment of  a wooden ball; adjusted by means of a sperit-level and a triangular  stand with a triangular mortice cut through it's center sufficiently  large to admit of the wooden ball partially; the stand rests on three  screws inserted near it's angles, which serve as feet for it to rest on  while they assist also in the adjustment. this horizon I have employed  in taking the altitude of the sun when his image he has been reather  too dull for a perfect reflection from water; I have used it generally  in taking the altitude of the moon, and in some cases of the stars  also; it gives the moon's image very perfectly, and when carefully  adjusted I consider it as liable to but little error.    5th--An Artificial Horizon formed of the index specula of a Sextant  cemented to a flat board; adjusted by means of a sperit level and the  triangular stand before discribed. as this glass reflects from both  surfaces it gives the images of all objects much more bright than  either of the other horizons; I have therefore most generally employed  it in observing the altitudes of stars    6th--A Chronometer; her ballance-wheel and escapement were on the most  improved construction. she rested on her back, in a small case prepared  for her, suspended by an universal joint. she was carefully wound up  every day at twelve oclock. Her rate of going as asscertained by a  series of observations made by myself for that purpose was found to be  15 Seconds and a 5 tenths of a second too slow in twenty four howers on  Mean Solar time. This is nearly the same result as that found by Mr.  Andrew Ellicott who was so obliging as to examine her rate of going for  the space of fourteen days, in the summer 1803. her rate of going as  ascertained by that gentleman was 15.6 s too slow M. T. in 24 h. and  that she went from 3 to 4 s. slower the last 12 h, than she did the  first 12 h. after being wound up.    at 12 OCk. on the 14th day of may 1804 (being the day on which the  detachment left the mouth of the River Dubois) the Chronometer was too  fast M. T. 6 m. 32 s. & 2/10.--This time-piece was regulated on  meantime, and the time entered in the following observations is that  shewn by her at the place of observation. the day is recconed on Civil  time, (i e) commencing at midnight.    7th--A Circumferentor, circle 6 Inches diameter, on the common  construction; by means of this instrument adjusted with the sperit  level, I have taken the magnetic azimuth of the sun and pole Star. It  has also been employed in taking the traverse of the river:--from the  courses thus obtained, together with the distances estimated from point  to point, the chart of the Missouri has been formed which now  accompanys these observations. the several points of observation are  marked with a cross of red ink, and numbered in such manner as to  correspond with the celestial observations made at those points  respectively.
