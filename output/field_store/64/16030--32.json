Alleyne followed close at her heels, with his mind in a whirl at this  black welcome and sudden shifting of all his plans and hopes. Yet, grave  as were his thoughts, they would still turn to wonder as he looked at  the twinkling feet of his guide and saw her lithe figure bend this way  and that, dipping under boughs, springing over stones, with a lightness  and ease which made it no small task for him to keep up with her. At  last, when he was almost out of breath, she suddenly threw herself down  upon a mossy bank, between two holly-bushes, and looked ruefully at her  own dripping feet and bedraggled skirt.    \"Holy Mary!\" said she, \"what shall I do? Mother will keep me to my  chamber for a month, and make me work at the tapestry of the nine bold  knights. She promised as much last week, when I fell into Wilverley bog,  and yet she knows that I cannot abide needle-work.\"    Alleyne, still standing in the stream, glanced down at the graceful  pink-and-white figure, the curve of raven-black hair, and the proud,  sensitive face which looked up frankly and confidingly at his own.    \"We had best on,\" he said. \"He may yet overtake us.\"    \"Not so. We are well off his land now, nor can he tell in this great  wood which way we have taken. But you--you had him at your mercy. Why  did you not kill him?\"    \"Kill him! My brother!\"    \"And why not?\"--with a quick gleam of her white teeth. \"He would have  killed you. I know him, and I read it in his eyes. Had I had your staff  I would have tried--aye, and done it, too.\" She shook her clenched white  hand as she spoke, and her lips tightened ominously.    \"I am already sad in heart for what I have done,\" said he, sitting down  on the bank, and sinking his face into his hands. \"God help me!--all  that is worst in me seemed to come uppermost. Another instant, and I  had smitten him: the son of my own mother, the man whom I have longed to  take to my heart. Alas! that I should still be so weak.\"    \"Weak!\" she exclaimed, raising her black eyebrows. \"I do not think that  even my father himself, who is a hard judge of manhood, would call you  that. But it is, as you may think, sir, a very pleasant thing for me to  hear that you are grieved at what you have done, and I can but rede  that we should go back together, and you should make your peace with the  Socman by handing back your prisoner. It is a sad thing that so small a  thing as a woman should come between two who are of one blood.\"    Simple Alleyne opened his eyes at this little spurt of feminine  bitterness. \"Nay, lady,\" said he, \"that were worst of all. What man  would be so caitiff and thrall as to fail you at your need? I have  turned my brother against me, and now, alas! I appear to have given you  offence also with my clumsy tongue. But, indeed, lady, I am torn both  ways, and can scarce grasp in my mind what it is that has befallen.\"    \"Nor can I marvel at that,\" said she, with a little tinkling laugh. \"You  came in as the knight does in the jongleur's romances, between dragon  and damsel, with small time for the asking of questions. Come,\" she went  on, springing to her feet, and smoothing down her rumpled frock, \"let us  walk through the shaw together, and we may come upon Bertrand with the  horses. If poor Troubadour had not cast a shoe, we should not have had  this trouble. Nay, I must have your arm: for, though I speak lightly,  now that all is happily over I am as frightened as my brave Roland. See  how his chest heaves, and his dear feathers all awry--the little knight  who would not have his lady mishandled.\" So she prattled on to her hawk,  while Alleyne walked by her side, stealing a glance from time to time at  this queenly and wayward woman. In silence they wandered together over  the velvet turf and on through the broad Minstead woods, where the  old lichen-draped beeches threw their circles of black shadow upon the  sunlit sward.    \"You have no wish, then, to hear my story?\" said she, at last.    \"If it pleases you to tell it me,\" he answered.    \"Oh!\" she cried tossing her head, \"if it is of so little interest to  you, we had best let it bide.\"    \"Nay,\" said he eagerly, \"I would fain hear it.\"    \"You have a right to know it, if you have lost a brother's favor through  it. And yet----Ah well, you are, as I understand, a clerk, so I  must think of you as one step further in orders, and make you my  father-confessor. Know then that this man has been a suitor for my hand,  less as I think for my own sweet sake than because he hath ambition and  had it on his mind that he might improve his fortunes by dipping into  my father's strong box--though the Virgin knows that he would have found  little enough therein. My father, however, is a proud man, a gallant  knight and tried soldier of the oldest blood, to whom this man's  churlish birth and low descent----Oh, lackaday! I had forgot that he was  of the same strain as yourself.\"    \"Nay, trouble not for that,\" said Alleyne, \"we are all from good mother  Eve.\"    \"Streams may spring from one source, and yet some be clear and some be  foul,\" quoth she quickly. \"But, to be brief over the matter, my father  would have none of his wooing, nor in sooth would I. On that he swore  a vow against us, and as he is known to be a perilous man, with many  outlaws and others at his back, my father forbade that I should hawk or  hunt in any part of the wood to the north of the Christchurch road. As  it chanced, however, this morning my little Roland here was loosed at a  strong-winged heron, and page Bertrand and I rode on, with no thoughts  but for the sport, until we found ourselves in Minstead woods. Small  harm then, but that my horse Troubadour trod with a tender foot upon a  sharp stick, rearing and throwing me to the ground. See to my gown, the  third that I have befouled within the week. Woe worth me when Agatha the  tire-woman sets eyes upon it!\"    \"And what then, lady?\" asked Alleyne.    \"Why, then away ran Troubadour, for belike I spurred him in falling,  and Bertrand rode after him as hard as hoofs could bear him. When I rose  there was the Socman himself by my side, with the news that I was on  his land, but with so many courteous words besides, and such gallant  bearing, that he prevailed upon me to come to his house for shelter,  there to wait until the page return. By the grace of the Virgin and the  help of my patron St. Magdalen, I stopped short ere I reached his  door, though, as you saw, he strove to hale me up to it. And  then--ah-h-h-h!\"--she shivered and chattered like one in an ague-fit.    \"What is it?\" cried Alleyne, looking about in alarm.    \"Nothing, friend, nothing! I was but thinking how I bit into his hand.  Sooner would I bite living toad or poisoned snake. Oh, I shall loathe my  lips forever! But you--how brave you were, and how quick! How meek for  yourself, and how bold for a stranger! If I were a man, I should wish to  do what you have done.\"    \"It was a small thing,\" he answered, with a tingle of pleasure at these  sweet words of praise. \"But you--what will you do?\"    \"There is a great oak near here, and I think that Bertrand will bring  the horses there, for it is an old hunting-tryst of ours. Then hey for  home, and no more hawking to-day! A twelve-mile gallop will dry feet and  skirt.\"    \"But your father?\"    \"Not one word shall I tell him. You do not know him; but I can tell you  he is not a man to disobey as I have disobeyed him. He would avenge me,  it is true, but it is not to him that I shall look for vengeance. Some  day, perchance, in joust or in tourney, knight may wish to wear my  colors, and then I shall tell him that if he does indeed crave my favor  there is wrong unredressed, and the wronger the Socman of Minstead. So  my knight shall find a venture such as bold knights love, and my debt  shall be paid, and my father none the wiser, and one rogue the less in  the world. Say, is not that a brave plan?\"    \"Nay, lady, it is a thought which is unworthy of you. How can such as  you speak of violence and of vengeance. Are none to be gentle and kind,  none to be piteous and forgiving? Alas! it is a hard, cruel world, and I  would that I had never left my abbey cell. To hear such words from your  lips is as though I heard an angel of grace preaching the devil's own  creed.\"    She started from him as a young colt who first feels the bit. \"Gramercy  for your rede, young sir!\" she said, with a little curtsey. \"As I  understand your words, you are grieved that you ever met me, and look  upon me as a preaching devil. Why, my father is a bitter man when he is  wroth, but hath never called me such a name as that. It may be his right  and duty, but certes it is none of thine. So it would be best, since you  think so lowly of me, that you should take this path to the left while  I keep on upon this one; for it is clear that I can be no fit companion  for you.\" So saying, with downcast lids and a dignity which was somewhat  marred by her bedraggled skirt, she swept off down the muddy track,  leaving Alleyne standing staring ruefully after her. He waited in vain  for some backward glance or sign of relenting, but she walked on with  a rigid neck until her dress was only a white flutter among the leaves.  Then, with a sunken head and a heavy heart, he plodded wearily down the  other path, wroth with himself for the rude and uncouth tongue which had  given offence where so little was intended.    He had gone some way, lost in doubt and in self-reproach, his mind all  tremulous with a thousand new-found thoughts and fears and wonderments,  when of a sudden there was a light rustle of the leaves behind him, and,  glancing round, there was this graceful, swift-footed creature, treading  in his very shadow, with her proud head bowed, even as his was--the  picture of humility and repentance.    \"I shall not vex you, nor even speak,\" she said; \"but I would fain keep  with you while we are in the wood.\"    \"Nay, you cannot vex "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9069"],[0,"Saint Augustin (#20)"],[1,"last more than ten years? The  mystery in which Augustin intended that the woman he had loved the most  should remain enveloped for all time, is nearly impenetrable to us. No  doubt she was of a very humble, not to say low class, since Monnica judged  it impossible to bring about a marriage between the ill-assorted pair.  There must have been an extreme inequality between the birth and education  of the lovers. This did not prevent Augustin from loving his mistress  passionately, for her beauty perhaps, or perhaps for her goodness of heart,  or both. Nevertheless, it is surprising, that in view of his changing  humour, and his prompt and impressionable soul, he remained faithful to  her so long. What was to prevent his taking his son and going off? Ancient  custom authorized such an act. But Augustin was tender-hearted. He was  afraid to cause pain; he dreaded for others the wounds that caused him so  much suffering himself. So he stayed on from kindness, from pity, habit  too, and also because, in spite of everything, he loved the mother of his  child. Up to the time of his conversion, they lived like husband and wife.    So now, to keep his family, he really turns \"a dealer in words.\" In spite  of his youth (he was barely twenty) the terms he had kept at Thagaste as  a teacher of grammar allowed him to take his place among the rhetoricians  at Carthage. Thanks to Romanianus, he got pupils at once. His protector at  Thagaste sent his son, that young Licentius whose education Augustin had  already begun, with one of his brothers, doubtless younger. It seems likely  that the two youths lived in Augustin's house. A small fact which their  master has preserved, looks like a proof of this. A spoon having been lost  in the house, Augustin, to find out where it was, told Licentius to go  and consult a wizard, one Albicerius, who had, just then, a great name in  Carthage. This message is scarcely to be explained unless we suppose the  lad was lodging in his professor's house. Another of the pupils is known to  us. This is Eulogius, who was later on a rhetorician at Carthage, and of  whom Augustin relates an extraordinary dream. Finally, there was Alypius,  a little younger than himself, his friend--\"the brother of his heart,\" as  he calls him. Alypius had been attending his lessons at Thagaste. When the  schoolmaster abruptly threw up his employment, the father of the pupil  was angry, and in sending his son to Carthage, he forbade him to go near  Augustin's class. But it was difficult to keep such eager friends apart.  Little by little, Alypius overcame his father's objections, and became a  pupil of his friend.    Augustin's knowledge, when he began to lecture, could not have been very  deep, for he had only lately quitted the student's bench himself. His  duties forced him to learn what he did not know. In teaching he taught  himself. It was at this time that he did most of the reading which  afterwards added substance to his polemics and treatises. He tells us  himself that he read in those days all that he could lay hands on. He is  very proud of having read by himself and understood without any assistance  from a master, the _Ten Categories_ of Aristotle, which was considered one  of the most abstruse works of the Stagirite. In an age when instruction was  principally by word of mouth, and books comparatively rare, it is obvious  that Augustin was not what we call an \"all-devouring reader.\" We do not  know if Carthage had many libraries, or what the libraries were worth. It  is no less true that the author of _The City of God_ is the last of the  Latin writers who had a really all-round knowledge. It is he who is the  link between modern times and pagan antiquity. The Middle Age hardly knew  classical literature, save by the allusions and quotations of Augustin.    So in spite of family and professional cares, he did not lose his  intellectual proclivities. The conquest of truth remained always his great  ambition. He still hoped to find it in Manicheeism, but he began to think  that it was a long time coming. The leaders of the sect could not have  trusted him thoroughly. They feared his acute and subtle mind, so quick  to detect the flaw in a thesis or argument. That is why they postponed  his initiation into their secret doctrines. Augustin remained a simple  _auditor_ in their Church. By way of appeasing the enormous activity of  his intelligence, they turned him on to controversy, and the critical  discussion of the Scriptures. Giving themselves out for Christians, they  adopted a part of them, and flung aside as interpolated or forged all that  was not in tune with their theology. Augustin, as we know, triumphed in  disputes of this kind, and was vain because he excelled in them.    And when he grew tired of this negative criticism and asked his evangelists  to give him more substantial food, they put him on some exoteric doctrine  calculated to appeal to a young imagination by its poetic or philosophical  colouring. The catechumen was not satisfied, but he put up with it for  lack of anything better. Very prettily he compares these enemies of the  Scriptures to the snarers of birds, who defile or fill with earth all the  water-places where the birds use to drink, save one mere; and about this  they set their snares. The birds all fly there, not because the water  is better, but because there is no other water, and they know not where  else to go and drink. So Augustin, not knowing where to quench his thirst  for truth, was fain to make the best of the confused pantheism of the  Manichees.    What remains noteworthy is, that however unstable his own convictions were,  he yet converted everybody about him. It was through him that his friends  became Manichees: Alypius one of the first; then Nebridius, the son of a  great landowner near Carthage; Honoratius, Marcianus; perhaps, too, the  youngest of his pupils, Licentius and his brother--all victims of his  persuasive tongue, which he exerted later on to draw them back from their  errors. So great was his charm--so deep, especially, was public credulity!    This fourth century was no longer a century of strong Christian faith. On  the other hand, the last agony of paganism was marked by a new attack of  the lowest credulity and superstition. As the Church energetically combated  both one and the other, it is not surprising that it was chiefly the  pagans who were contaminated. The old religion was to end by foundering in  magic. The greatest minds of the period, the neo-Platonists, the Emperor  Julian himself, were miracle-workers, or at any rate, adepts in the occult  sciences. Augustin, who was then separated from Christianity, followed the  general impulse, together with the young men he knew. Just now we saw him  sending to consult the soothsayer, Albicerius, about the loss of a spoon.  And this man of intellect believed also in astrologers and nigromancers.    Strips of lead have been found at Carthage upon which are written magic  spells against horses entered for races in the circus. Just like the  Carthaginian jockeys, Augustin had recourse to these hidden and fraudulent  practices, to make sure of success. On the eve of a verse competition in  the theatre, he fell in with a wizard who offered, if they could agree  about the price, to sacrifice a certain number of animals to buy the  victory. Upon this, Augustin, very much annoyed, declared that if the prize  were a crown of immortal gold, not a fly should be sacrificed to help him  win it. Really, magic was repellent to the honesty of his mind, as well  as to his nerves, by reason of the suspicious and brutal part of its  operations. As a rule, it was involved with haruspicy, and had a side of  sacred anatomy and the kitchen which revolted the sensitive--dissection  of flesh, inspection of entrails, not to mention the slaughtering and  strangling of victims. Fanatics, such as Julian, gave themselves up with  delight to these disgusting manipulations. What we know of Augustin's soul  makes it quite clear why he recoiled with horror.    Astrology, on the contrary, attracted him by its apparent science. Its  adepts called themselves \"mathematicians,\" and thus seemed to borrow from  the exact sciences something of their solidity. Augustin often discussed  astrology with a Carthage physician, Vindicianus, a man of great sense  and wide learning, who even reached Proconsular honours. In vain did he  point out to the young rhetorician that the pretended prophecies of the  mathematicians were the effect of chance; in vain did Nebridius, less  credulous than his friend, join his arguments to those of the crafty  physician; Augustin clung obstinately to his chimera. His dialectical mind  discovered ingenious justifications for what the astrologers claimed.    Thus, dazzled by all the intellectual phantasms, he strayed from one  science to another, repeating meanwhile in his heart the motto of his  Manichean masters: \"The Truth, the Truth!\". But whatever might be the  attractions of the speculative life, he had first to face the needs of  actual life. The sight of his child called him back to a sense of his  position. To get money, and for that purpose to push himself forward, put  himself in evidence, increase his reputation--Augustin worked at that as  hard as he could. It led him to enter for the prize of dramatic poetry.  He was declared the winner. His old friend, the physician Vindicianus, who  was then Proconsul, placed the crown, as he says, upon his \"disordered  head.\" The future Father of the Church writing for the theatre--and what a  theatre it was then!--is not the least extraordinary thing in this life so  disturbed and, at first sight, so contradictory.    It was also from literary ambition that about the same time he wrote a book  on aesthetics called _Upon the Beautiful and the Fit_, which he dedicated to  a famous colleague, the Syrian Hierius, \"orator to the City of Rome,\" one  of"]]]
