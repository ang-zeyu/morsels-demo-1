I was prizing off the strips that held the sash,  very carefully, and my heart suddenly commenced to gallop, without any  reference to me. I'd never felt like that before, except once or  twice. It was just as if I'd swallowed some clockwork arrangement,  unconsciously, and it had started to go, without warning. I reckon it  was all on account of that blarsted Jack working me up. He had a  quiet way of working you up to a thing, that made you want to hit him  sometimes--after you'd made an ass of yourself.    I didn't hear Mary at first. I hoped Jack would come round and help me  out of the fix, but he didn't.    'Mr--Mr Wilson!' said Mary. She had a sweet voice.    I turned round.    'I thought you and Mr Barnes might like a cup of tea.'    'Oh, thank you!' I said, and I made a dive for the window, as if hurry  would help it. I trod on an old cask-hoop; it sprang up and dinted my  shin and I stumbled--and that didn't help matters much.    'Oh! did you hurt yourself, Mr Wilson?' cried Mary.    'Hurt myself! Oh no, not at all, thank you,' I blurted out. 'It takes  more than that to hurt me.'    I was about the reddest shy lanky fool of a Bushman that was ever taken  at a disadvantage on foot, and when I took the tray my hands shook so  that a lot of the tea was spilt into the saucers. I embarrassed her too,  like the damned fool I was, till she must have been as red as I was, and  it's a wonder we didn't spill the whole lot between us. I got away  from the window in as much of a hurry as if Jack had cut his leg with a  chisel and fainted, and I was running with whisky for him. I blundered  round to where he was, feeling like a man feels when he's just made an  ass of himself in public. The memory of that sort of thing hurts you  worse and makes you jerk your head more impatiently than the thought of  a past crime would, I think.    I pulled myself together when I got to where Jack was.    'Here, Jack!' I said. 'I've struck something all right; here's some tea  and brownie--we'll hang out here all right.'    Jack took a cup of tea and a piece of cake and sat down to enjoy it,  just as if he'd paid for it and ordered it to be sent out about that  time.    He was silent for a while, with the sort of silence that always made me  wild at him. Presently he said, as if he'd just thought of it--    'That's a very pretty little girl, 'Possum, isn't she, Joe? Do you  notice how she dresses?--always fresh and trim. But she's got on her  best bib-and-tucker to-day, and a pinafore with frills to it. And it's  ironing-day, too. It can't be on your account. If it was Saturday or  Sunday afternoon, or some holiday, I could understand it. But perhaps  one of her admirers is going to take her to the church bazaar in Solong  to-night. That's what it is.'    He gave me time to think over that.    'But yet she seems interested in you, Joe,' he said. 'Why didn't you  offer to take her to the bazaar instead of letting another chap get in  ahead of you? You miss all your chances, Joe.'    Then a thought struck me. I ought to have known Jack well enough to have  thought of it before.    'Look here, Jack,' I said. 'What have you been saying to that girl about  me?'    'Oh, not much,' said Jack. 'There isn't much to say about you.'    'What did you tell her?'    'Oh, nothing in particular. She'd heard all about you before.'    'She hadn't heard much good, I suppose,' I said.    'Well, that's true, as far as I could make out. But you've only got  yourself to blame. I didn't have the breeding and rearing of you. I  smoothed over matters with her as much as I could.'    'What did you tell her?' I said. 'That's what I want to know.'    'Well, to tell the truth, I didn't tell her anything much. I only  answered questions.'    'And what questions did she ask?'    'Well, in the first place, she asked if your name wasn't Joe Wilson; and  I said it was, as far as I knew. Then she said she heard that you wrote  poetry, and I had to admit that that was true.'    'Look here, Jack,' I said, 'I've two minds to punch your head.'    'And she asked me if it was true that you were wild,' said Jack, 'and I  said you was, a bit. She said it seemed a pity. She asked me if it was  true that you drank, and I drew a long face and said that I was sorry  to say it was true. She asked me if you had any friends, and I said none  that I knew of, except me. I said that you'd lost all your friends; they  stuck to you as long as they could, but they had to give you best, one  after the other.'    'What next?'    'She asked me if you were delicate, and I said no, you were as tough as  fencing-wire. She said you looked rather pale and thin, and asked me if  you'd had an illness lately. And I said no--it was all on account of  the wild, dissipated life you'd led. She said it was a pity you hadn't  a mother or a sister to look after you--it was a pity that something  couldn't be done for you, and I said it was, but I was afraid that  nothing could be done. I told her that I was doing all I could to keep  you straight.'    I knew enough of Jack to know that most of this was true. And so she  only pitied me after all. I felt as if I'd been courting her for six  months and she'd thrown me over--but I didn't know anything about women  yet.    'Did you tell her I was in jail?' I growled.    'No, by Gum! I forgot that. But never mind I'll fix that up all right.  I'll tell her that you got two years' hard for horse-stealing. That  ought to make her interested in you, if she isn't already.'    We smoked a while.    'And was that all she said?' I asked.    'Who?--Oh! 'Possum,' said Jack rousing himself. 'Well--no; let me  think---- We got chatting of other things--you know a married man's  privileged, and can say a lot more to a girl than a single man can. I  got talking nonsense about sweethearts, and one thing led to another  till at last she said, \"I suppose Mr Wilson's got a sweetheart, Mr  Barnes?\"'    'And what did you say?' I growled.    'Oh, I told her that you were a holy terror amongst the girls,' said  Jack. 'You'd better take back that tray, Joe, and let us get to work.'    I wouldn't take back the tray--but that didn't mend matters, for Jack  took it back himself.    I didn't see Mary's reflection in the window again, so I took the window  out. I reckoned that she was just a big-hearted, impulsive little thing,  as many Australian girls are, and I reckoned that I was a fool for  thinking for a moment that she might give me a second thought, except  by way of kindness. Why! young Black and half a dozen better men than me  were sweet on her, and young Black was to get his father's station and  the money--or rather his mother's money, for she held the stuff (she  kept it close too, by all accounts). Young Black was away at the time,  and his mother was dead against him about Mary, but that didn't make  any difference, as far as I could see. I reckoned that it was only  just going to be a hopeless, heart-breaking, stand-far-off-and-worship  affair, as far as I was concerned--like my first love affair, that I  haven't told you about yet. I was tired of being pitied by good girls.  You see, I didn't know women then. If I had known, I think I might have  made more than one mess of my life.    Jack rode home to Solong every night. I was staying at a pub some  distance out of town, between Solong and Haviland. There were three or  four wet days, and we didn't get on with the work. I fought shy of Mary  till one day she was hanging out clothes and the line broke. It was the  old-style sixpenny clothes-line. The clothes were all down, but it was  clean grass, so it didn't matter much. I looked at Jack.    'Go and help her, you capital Idiot!' he said, and I made the plunge.    'Oh, thank you, Mr Wilson!' said Mary, when I came to help. She had the  broken end of the line and was trying to hold some of the clothes off  the ground, as if she could pull it an inch with the heavy wet sheets  and table-cloths and things on it, or as if it would do any good if she  did. But that's the way with women--especially little women--some of 'em  would try to pull a store bullock if they got the end of the rope on  the right side of the fence. I took the line from Mary, and accidentally  touched her soft, plump little hand as I did so: it sent a thrill right  through me. She seemed a lot cooler than I was.    Now, in cases like this, especially if you lose your head a bit, you get  hold of the loose end of the rope that's hanging from the post with one  hand, and the end of the line with the clothes on with the other, and  try to pull 'em far enough together to make a knot. And that's about  all you do for the present, except look like a fool. Then I took off  the post end, spliced the line, took it over the fork, and pulled, while  Mary helped me with the prop. I thought Jack might have come and taken  the prop from her, but he didn't; he just went on with his work as if  nothing was happening inside the horizon.    She'd got the line about two-thirds full of clothes, it was a bit short  now, so she had to jump and catch it with one hand and hold it down  while she pegged a sheet she'd thrown over. I'd made the plunge now,  so I volunteered to help her. I held down the line while she threw  the things over and pegged out. As we got near the post and higher I  straightened out some ends and pegged myself. Bushmen are handy at most  things. We laughed, and now and again Mary would say, 'No, that's not  the way, Mr Wilson; that's not right; the sheet isn't far enough over;  wait till I fix it,' &c. I'd a reckless idea once of holding her up  while she pegged, and I was glad afterwards that I hadn't made such a  fool of myself.    'There's only a few more things in the basket, Miss Brand,' I said. 'You  can't reach--I'll fix 'em up.'    She seemed to give a little gasp.    'Oh, those"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10366"],[0,"Freedom's Battle (#3)"],[1,"will allow their connection with  India to cease rather than remedy the wrongs for which we seek justice.  If this assumption be correct, no doubt it must lead to separation and  possibly also anarchy for a time. If the operatives in a factory have  grievances, negotiations having failed, a strike would on a similar  argument be never admissible. Unyielding obstinacy being presumed, it  must end in the closing down of the factory and break up of the men. But  if in ninety-nine out of a hundred cases it is not the case that strikes  end in this manner, it is more unlikely that, instead of righting the  manifest wrongs that India complains about, the British people will  value their Indian Dominion so low as to prefer to allow us to  non-co-operate up to the point of separation. It would be a totally  false reading of British character and British history. But if such  wicked obstinacy be ultimately shown by a government, far be it from us  to prefer peace at the price of abject surrender to wrong. There is no  anarchy greater than the moral anarchy of surrender to unrepentant  wrong. We may, however, be certain that if we show the strength and  unity necessary for non-co-operation, long before we progress with it  far, we shall have developed true order and true self-government wherein  there is no place for anarchy.    Another fear sometimes expressed that, if non-co-operation were to  succeed, the British would have to go, leaving us unable to defend  ourselves against foreign aggression. If we have the self-respect, the  patriotism, the tenacious purpose, and the power of organisation that are  necessary to drive the British out from their entrenched position, no  lesser foreign power will dare after that, undertake the futile task of  conquering or enslaving us.    It is sometimes said that non-co-operation is negative and destructive  of the advantages which a stable government has conferred on us. That  non-co-operation is negative is merely a half-truth. Non-co-operation  with the government means greater co-operation among ourselves, greater  mutual dependence among the many different castes and classes of our  country. Non-co-operation is not mere negation. It will lead to the  recovery of the lost art of co-operation among ourselves. Long  dependence on an outside government which by its interference  suppressed or prevented the consequences of our differences has made us  forget the duty of mutual trust and the art of friendly adjustment.  Having allowed Government to do everything for us, we have gradually  become incapable of doing anything for ourselves. Even if we had no  grievance against this Government, non-co-operation with it for a time  would be desirable so far as it would perforce lead us to trusting and  working with one another and thereby strengthen the bonds of  national unity.    The most tragic consequence of dependence on the complex machinery of a  foreign government is the atrophy of the communal sense. The direct  touch with administrative cause and effect is lost. An outside protector  performs all the necessary functions of the community in a mysterious  manner, and communal duties are not realised by the people. The one  reason addressed by those who deny to us the capacity for self-rule is  the insufficient appreciation by the people of communal duties and  discipline. It is only by actually refraining for a time from dependence  on Government that we can regain self-reliance, learn first-hand the  value of communal duties and build up true national co-operation.  Non-co-operation is a practical and positive training in Swadharma, and  Swadharma alone can lead up to Swaraj.    The negative is the best and most impressive method of enforcing the  value of the positive. Few outside government circles realise in the  present police anything but tyranny and corruption. But if the units of  the present police were withdrawn we would soon perforce set about  organising a substitute, and most people would realise the true social  value of a police force. Few realise in the present taxes anything but  coercion and waste, but most people would soon see that a share of every  man's income is due for common purposes and that there are many  limitations to the economical management of public institutions; we  would begin once again to contribute directly, build up and maintain  national institutions in the place of those that now mysteriously spring  up and live under Government orders.      EMANCIPATION    Freedom is a priceless thing. But it is a stable possession only when it  is acquired by a nation's strenuous effort. What is not by chance or  outward circumstance, or given by the generous impulse of a tyrant  prince or people is not a reality. A nation will truly enjoy freedom  only when in the process of winning or defending its freedom, it has  been purified and consolidated through and through, until liberty has  become a part of its very soul. Otherwise it would be but a change of  the form of government, which might please the fancy of politicians, or  satisfy the classes in power, but could never emancipate a people. An  Act of Parliament can never create citizens in Hindustan. The strength,  spirit, and happiness of a people who have fought and won their liberty  cannot be got by Reform Acts. Effort and sacrifice are the necessary  conditions of real stable emancipation. Liberty unacquired, merely found,  will on the test fail like the Dead-Sea-apple or the magician's plenty.    The war that the people of India have declared and which will purify and  consolidate India, and forge for her a true and stable liberty is a war  with the latest and most effective weapon. In this war, what has  hitherto been in the world an undesirable but necessary incident in  freedom's battles, the killing of innocent men, has been eliminated; and  that which is the true essential for forging liberty, the  self-purification and self-strengthening of men and women has been kept  pure and unalloyed. It is for men, women and youth, every one of them  that lives in and loves India, to do his bit in this battle, not waiting  for others, not calculating the chances of his surviving the battle to  enjoy the fruits of his sacrifice. Soldiers in the old-world wars did  not insure their lives before going to the front. The privilege of youth  in special is for country's sake to exercise their comparative freedom  and give up the yearning for lives and careers built on the slavery of  the people.    That on which a foreign government truly rests whatever may be the  illusions on their or our part is not the strength of its armed forces,  but our own co-operation. Actual service on the part of one generation,  and educational preparation for future service on the part of the next  generation are the two main branches of this co-operation of slaves in  the perpetuation of slavery. The boycott of government service and the  law-courts is aimed at the first, the boycott of government controlled  schools is to stop the second. If either the one or the other of these  two branches of co-operation is withdrawn in sufficient measure, there  will be an automatic and perfectly peaceful change from slavery  to liberty.    The beat preparation for any one who desires to take part in the great  battle now going on is a silent study of the writings and speeches  collected herein, and proposed to be completed in a supplementary volume  to be soon issued.    C. RAJAGOPALACHAR          II. THE KHILAFAT      WHY I HAVE JOINED THE KHILAFAT MOVEMENT    An esteemed South African friend who is at present living in England has  written to me a letter from which I make the following excerpts:--       \"You will doubtless remember having met me in South Africa at the     time when the Rev. J.J. Doke was assisting you in your campaign there     and I subsequently returned to England deeply impressed with the     rightness of your attitude in that country. During the months before     war I wrote and lectured and spoke on your behalf in several places     which I do not regret. Since returning from military service,     however, I have noticed from the papers that you appear to be     adopting a more militant attitude... I notice a report in \"The Times\"     that you are assisting and countenancing a union between the Hindus     and Moslems with a view of embarrassing England and the Allied Powers     in the matter of the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire or the     ejection of the Turkish Government from Constantinople. Knowing as I     do your sense of justice and your humane instincts I feel that I am     entitled, in view of the humble part that I have taken to promote     your interests on this side, to ask you whether this latter report is     correct. I cannot believe that you have wrongly countenanced a     movement to place the cruel and unjust despotism of the Stamboul     Government above the interests of humanity, for if any country has     crippled these interests in the East it has surely been Turkey. I am     personally familiar with the conditions in Syria and Armenia and I     can only suppose that if the report, which \"The Times\" has published     is correct, you have thrown to one side, your moral responsibilities     and allied yourself with one of the prevailing anarchies. However,     until I hear that this is not your attitude I cannot prejudice my     mind. Perhaps you will do me the favour of sending me a reply.\"    I have sent a reply to the writer. But as the views expressed in the  quotation are likely to be shared by many of my English friends and as I  do not wish, if I can possibly help it, to forfeit their friendship or  their esteem I shall endeavour to state my position as clearly as I can  on the Khilafat question. The letter shows what risk public men run  through irresponsible journalism. I have not seen _The Times_ report,  referred to by my friend. But it is evident that the report has"]]]
