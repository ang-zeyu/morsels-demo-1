Hudgens, and I then went to live with  her and cared for her children. When her daughter Miss Helen married  Professor Wiggins, I took care of her little daughter, and this made  five generations that I have cared for.    \"During the Civil War, Mr. Parks took all his slaves and all of his fine  stock, horses and cattle and went South to Louisiana following the  Southern army for protection. Many slave owners left the county taking  with them their slaves and followed the army.    \"When the war was over, Mr. Parks was still in the South and gave to  each one of his slaves who did not want to come back to Arkansas so much  money. My uncle George came back with Mr. Parks and was given a good  mountain farm of forty acres, which he put in cultivation and one of my  uncle's descendants still lives on the place. My mother did not return  to Arkansas but went on to Joplin, Missouri, and for more than fifty  years, neither one of us knew where the other one was until one day a  man from Fayetteville went into a restaurant in Joplin and ordered his  breakfast, and my mother who was in there heard him say he lived in  Fayetteville, Arkansas. He lived just below the Hudgens home and when my  mother enquired about the family he told her I was still alive and was  with the family. While neither of us could read nor write we  corresponded through different people. But I never saw her after I was  eleven years old. Later Mr. Hudgens went to Joplin to see if she was  well taken care of. She owned her own little place and when she died  there was enough money for her to be buried.    \"Civil War days are vivid to me. The Courthouse which was then in the  middle of the Square was burned one night by a crazy Confederate  soldier. The old men in the town saved him and then put him in the  county jail to keep him from burning other houses. Each family was to  take food to him and they furnished bedding. The morning I was to take  his breakfast, he had ripped open his feather bed and crawled inside to  get warm. The room was so full of feathers when I got there that his  food nearly choked him. I had carried him ham, hot biscuits and a pot of  coffee.    \"After the War many soldiers came to my mistress, Mrs. Blakely, trying  to make her free me. I told them I was free but I did not want to go  anywhere, that I wanted to stay in the only home that I had ever known.  In a way that placed me in a wrong attitude. I was pointed out as  different. Sometimes I was threatened for not leaving but I stayed on.    \"I had always been well treated by my master's folks. While we lived at  the old Kidd place, there was a church a few miles from our home. My  uncle George was coachman and drove my master's family in great splendor  in a fine barouche to church. After the war, when he went to his own  place, Mr. Parks gave him the old carriage and bought a new one for the  family.    \"I can remember the days of slavery as happy ones. We always had an  abundance of food. Old Aunt Martha cooked and there was always plenty  prepared for all the white folks as well as the colored folks. There was  a long table at the end of the big kitchen for the colored folks. The  vegetables were all prepared of an evening by Aunt Martha with someone  to help her.    \"My mother seemed to have a gift of telling fortunes. She had a brass  ring about the size of a dollar with a handwoven knotted string that she  used. I remember that she told many of the young people in the  neighborhood many strange things. They would come to her with their  premonitions.    \"Yes, we were afraid of the patyroles. All colored folks were. They said  that any Negroes that were caught away from their master's premises  without a permit would be whipped by the patyroles. They used to sing a  song:      'Run nigger run,     The patyroles     Will get you.'    \"Yes'm, the War separated lots of families. Mr. Parks' son, John C.  Parks, enlisted in Colonel W.H. Brooks' regiment at Fayetteville as  third lieutenant. Mr. Jim Parks was killed at the Battle of Getysburg.    \"I do remember it was my mistress, Mrs. Blakely, who kept the Masonic  Building from being burned. The soldiers came to set it on fire. Mrs.  Blakely knew that if it burned, our home would burn as it was just  across the street. Mrs. Blakely had two small children who were very ill  in upstairs rooms. She told the soldiers if they burned the Masonic  Building that her house would burn and she would be unable to save her  little children. They went away.\"    While Aunt Adeline is nearing ninety, she is still active, goes shopping  and also tends to the many crepe myrtle bushes as well as many other  flowers at the Hudgens place.    She attends to the renting of the apartment house, as caretaker, and is  taken care of by members of the Blakely-Hudgens families.    Aunt Adeline talks \"white folks language,\" as they say, and seldom  associates with the colored people of the town.      [Footnote 1: This statement can be verified by the will made by John  P.A.

Her  mother come from Virginia. She was sold with her mother and two little  brothers. Her mother had been sold and come in a wagon to southwest  Georgia. They was all field hands. They cleaned out new ground. They was  afraid of hoop-snakes. She said they look like a hoop rolling and  whatever they stuck a horn or their tail in it died. They killed trees.    \"Mama said she druther plough than chop. She was a big woman and they  let her plough right along by her two little brothers, Henry and Will  Keller. Will et so many sweet potatoes they called him 'Tater Keller.'  After he got grown we come out here. Folks called him 'Tate Keller.'  Henry died. I recollect Uncle Tate.    \"I was born close to Mobile, Alabama. Mama was named Sarah Keller.  Grandma was called Mariah. Banks Tillman sold her the first time. Bill  Keller bought them all the last time. His wife was named Ada Keller.  They had a great big family but I forgot what they said about them.

Maspero, _Pyramides da Saqqarah_, p. 111.] in  the same text we read, \"Behold, Teta hath arrived in the height of  heaven, and the _henmemet_ beings have seen him; the Semketet [Footnote:  The morning boat of the sun.] boat knoweth him, and it is Teta who  saileth it, and the M[=a]ntchet [Footnote: The evening boat of the sun.]  boat calleth unto him, and it is Teta who bringeth it to a standstill.  Teta hath seen his body in the Semketet boat, he knoweth the uraeus  which is in the M[=a]ntchet boat, and God hath called him in his  name...and hath taken him in to R[=a].\" And again [Footnote: _Ibid_., p.  150.] we have: \"Thou hast received the form (_or_ attribute) of God, and  thou hast become great therewith before the gods\"; and of Pepi I., who  reigned about B.C. 3000, it is said, \"This Pepi is God, the son of God.\"  [Footnote: _Ibid_., p. 222.] Now in these passages the allusion is to  the supreme Being in the next world, the Being who has the power to  invoke and to obtain a favourable reception for the deceased king by  R[=a], the Sun-god, the type and symbol of God. It may, of course, be  urged that the word _neter_ here refers to Osiris, but it is not  customary to speak of this god in such a way in the texts; and even if  we admit that it does, it only shows that the powers of God have been  attributed to Osiris, and that he was believed to occupy the position in  respect of R[=a] and the deceased which the supreme Being himself  occupied. In the last two extracts given above we might read \"a god\"  instead of \"God,\" but there is no object in the king receiving the form  or attribute of a nameless god; and unless Pepi becomes the son of God;  the honour which the writer of that text intends to ascribe to the king  becomes little and even ridiculous.    Passing from religious texts to works containing moral precepts, we find  much light thrown upon the idea of God by the writings of the early  sages of Egypt. First and foremost among these are the \"Precepts of  Kaqemna\" and the \"Precepts of Ptah-hetep,\" works which were composed as  far back as B.C. 3000. The oldest copy of them which we possess is,  unfortunately, not older than B.C. 2500, but this fact in no way affects  our argument. These \"precepts\" are intended to form a work of direction  and guidance for a young man in the performance of his duty towards the  society in which he lived and towards his God. It is only fair to say  that the reader will look in vain in them for the advice which is found  in writings of a similar character composed at a later period; but as a  work intended to demonstrate the \"whole duty of man\" to the youth of the  time when the Great Pyramid was still a new building, these \"precepts\"  are very remarkable. The idea of God held by Ptah-hetep is illustrated  by the following passages:--      1. \"Thou shalt make neither man nor woman to be afraid, for God is    opposed thereto; and if any man shall say that he will live thereby,    He will make him to want bread.\"      2. \"As for the nobleman who possesseth abundance of goods, he may act    according to his own dictates; and he may do with himself that which    he pleaseth; if he will do nothing at all, that also is as he    pleaseth. The nobleman by merely stretching out his hand doeth that    which mankind (_or_ a person) cannot attain to; but inasmuch as the    eating of bread is according to the plan of God, this cannot be    gainsaid.\"      3. \"If thou hast ground to till, labour in the field which God hath    given thee; rather than fill thy mouth with that which belongeth to    thy neighbours it is better to terrify him that hath possessions [to    give them unto thee].\"      4. \"If thou abasest thyself in the service of a perfect man, thy    conduct shall be fair before God.\"      5. \"If thou wouldst be a wise man, make thou thy son to be pleasing    unto God.\"      6. \"Satisfy those who depend upon thee as far as thou art able so to    do; this should be done by those whom God hath favoured.\"      7. \"If, having been of no account, thou hast become great; and if,    having been poor, thou hast become rich; and if thou hast become    governor of the city, be not hard-hearted on account of thy    advancement, because thou hast become merely the guardian of the    things which God hath provided.\"      8. \"What is loved of God is obedience; God hateth disobedience.\"      9. \"Verily a good son is of the gifts of God.\" [Footnote: The text was    published by Prisse d'Avennes, entitled _Facsimile d'un papyrus    egyptien en caracteres hieratiques_, Paris, 1847. For a translation of    the whole work, see Virey, _etudes sur le Papyrus Prisse_, Paris,    1887.]    The same idea of God, but considerably amplified in some respects, may  be found in the _Maxims of Khensu-Hetep_, a work which was probably  composed during the XVIIIth dynasty. This work has been studied in  detail by a number of eminent Egyptologists, and though considerable  difference of opinion has existed among them in respect of details and  grammatical niceties, the general sense of the maxims has been clearly  established. To illustrate the use of the word _neter_, the following  passages have been chosen from it:[Footnote: They are given with  interlinear transliteration and translation in my _Papyrus of Ani_, p.  lxxxv. ff., where references to the older literature on the subject will  be found.]--      1. \"God magnifieth his name.\"      2. \"What the house of God hateth is much speaking. Pray thou with a    loving heart all the petitions which are in secret. He will perform    thy business, he will hear that which thou sayest and will accept    thine offerings.\"      3. \"God decreeth the right.\"      4. \"When thou makest an offering unto thy God, guard thou against the    things which are an abomination unto him. Behold thou his plans with    thine eye, and devote thyself to the adoration of his name. He giveth    souls unto millions of forms, and him that magnifieth him doth he    magnify.\"      5. \"If thy mother raise her hands to God he will hear her prayers [and    rebuke thee].\"      7. \"Give thyself to God, and keep thou thyself daily for God.\"    Now, although the above passages prove the exalted idea which the  Egyptians held of the supreme Being, they do not supply us with any of  the titles and epithets which they applied to him; for these we must  have recourse to the fine hymns and religious meditations which form so  important a part of the \"Book of the Dead.\" But before we quote from  them, mention must be made of the _neteru_, _i.e._, the beings or  existences which in some way partake of the nature or character of God,  and are usually called \"gods.\" The early nations that came in contact  with the Egyptians usually misunderstood the nature of these beings, and  several modern Western writers have done the same. When we examine these  \"gods\" closely, they are found to be nothing more nor less than forms,  or manifestations, or phases, or attributes, of one god, that god being  R[=a] the Sun-god, who, it must be remembered, was the type and symbol  of God. Nevertheless, the worship of the _neteru_ by the Egyptians has  been made the base of the charge of \"gross idolatry\" which has been  brought against them, and they have been represented by some as being on  the low intellectual level of savage tribes. It is certain that from the  earliest times one of the greatest tendencies of the Egyptian religion  was towards monotheism, and this tendency may be observed in all  important texts down to the latest period; it is also certain that a  kind of polytheism existed in Egypt side by side with monotheism from  very early times. Whether monotheism or polytheism be the older, it is  useless in our present state of knowledge to attempt to enquire.  According to Tiele, the religion of Egypt was at the beginning  polytheistic, but developed in two opposite directions: in the one  direction gods were multiplied by the addition of local gods, and in the  other the Egyptians drew nearer and nearer to monotheism. [Footnote:  _Geschiedenis van den Godedienst in de Oudheid_, Amsterdam, 1893, p. 25.  A number of valuable remarks on this subject are given by Lieblein in  _Egyptian Religion_, p. 10.] Dr. Wiedemann takes the view that three  main elements may be recognized in the Egyptian religion: (1) A solar  monotheism, that is to say one god, the creator of the universe, who  manifests his power especially in the sun and its operations; (2) A cult  of the regenerating power of nature, which expresses itself in the  adoration of ithyphallic gods, of fertile goddesses, and of a series of  animals and of various deities of vegetation; (3) A perception of an  anthropomorphic divinity, the life of whom in this world and in the  world beyond this was typical of the ideal life of man [Footnote: _Le  Livre dei Moris_ (Review in _Museon_, Tom. xiii. 1893).]--this last  divinity being, of course, Osiris. But here again, as Dr. Wiedemann  says, it is an unfortunate fact that all the texts which we possess are,  in respect of the period of the origin of the Egyptian religion,  comparatively late, and therefore in them we find these three elements  mixed together, along with a number of foreign matters, in such a way as  to make it impossible to discover which of them is the oldest. No better  example can be given of the loose way in which different ideas about a  god and God are mingled in the same text than the \"Negative Confession\"  in the hundred and twenty-fifth chapter of the Book of the Dead. Here,  in the oldest copies of the passages known, the deceased says, \"I have  not cursed God\" (1. 38), and a few lines after (1. 42) he adds, \"I have  not thought scorn of the god living in my city.\" It seems that here we  have "]]]
