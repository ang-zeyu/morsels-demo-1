Tourism alone provides    about 50% of GDP and directly or indirectly employs about 50,000 people or    40% of the local work force. The economy has slackened in recent years, as    the annual increase in the number of tourists slowed. Nonetheless, per    capita GDP is one of the highest in the region.

Whether, then, she still maintained that she knew nothing of the  devil?    _R_. She maintained it now, and would maintain it until her life's end.    _Q_. And nevertheless, as had been seen by witnesses, she had been  re-baptized by him in the sea in broad daylight.--Here again she blushed,  and for a moment was silent.    _Q_. Why did she blush again? She should for God his sake think on her  salvation, and confess the truth.    _R_. She had bathed herself in the sea, seeing that the day was very hot;  that was the whole truth.    _Q_. What chaste maiden would ever bathe in the sea? Thou liest; or wilt  thou even yet deny that thou didst bewitch old Paasch his little girl with  a white roll?    _R_. Alas! alas! she loved the child as though it were her own little  sister; not only had she taught her as well as all the other children  without reward, but during the heavy famine she had often taken the bit  from her own mouth to put it into the little child's. How, then, could she  have wished to do her such grievous harm?    _Q_. Wilt thou even yet deny?--Reverend Abraham, how stubborn is your  child! See here, is this no witches' salve, which the constable fetched  out of thy coffer last night? Is this no witches' salve, eh?    _R_. It was a salve for the skin, which would make it soft and white, as  the apothecary at Wolgast had told her, of whom she bought it.    _Q_. Hereupon he shook his head, and went on: How! wilt thou then lastly  deny that on this last Saturday the both July, at twelve o'clock at night,  thou didst on the Streckelberg call upon thy paramour the devil in  dreadful words, whereupon he appeared to thee in the shape of a great  hairy giant, and clipped thee and toyed with thee?    At these words she grew more pale than a corpse, and tottered so that she  was forced to hold by a chair: and I, wretched man, who would readily have  sworn away my life for her, when I saw and heard this, my senses forsook  me, so that I fell down from the bench, and _Dom. Consul_ had to call in  the constable to help me up.    When I had come to myself a little, and the impudent varlet saw our common  consternation, he cried out, grinning at the court the while, 'Is it all  out? is it all out? has she confessed?' Whereupon _Dom. Consul_ again  showed him the door with a sharp rebuke, as might have been expected; and  it is said that this knave played the pimp for the Sheriff, and indeed I  think he would not otherwise have been so bold.    _Summa_: I should well-nigh have perished in my distress, but for the  little rose, which by the help of God's mercy kept me up bravely; and now  the whole court rose and exhorted my poor fainting child, by the living  God, and as she would save her soul, to deny no longer, but in pity to  herself and her father to confess the truth.    [Illustration: The Apparition on the Streckelberg]    Hereupon she heaved a deep sigh, and grew as red as she had been pale  before, insomuch that even her hand upon the chair was like scarlet, and  she did not raise her eyes from the ground.    _R_. She would now then confess the simple truth, as she saw right well  that wicked people had stolen after and watched her at nights. That she  had been to seek for amber on the mountain, and that to drive away fear  she had, as she was wont to do at her work, recited the Latin _carmen_  which her father had made on the illustrious King Gustavus Adolphus: when  young Ruediger of Nienkerken, who had ofttimes been at her father's house  and talked of love to her, came out of the coppice, and when she cried out  for fear, spoke to her in Latin, and clasped her in his arms. That he wore  a great wolf's-skin coat, so that folks should not know him if they met  him, and tell the lord his father that he had been on the mountain by  night.    At this her confession I fell into sheer despair, and cried in great  wrath, \"O thou ungodly and undutiful child, after all, then, thou hast a  paramour! Did not I forbid thee to go up the mountain by night? What didst  thou want on the mountain by night?\" and I began to moan and weep and  wring my hands, so that _Dom. Consul_ even had pity on me, and drew near  to comfort me. Meanwhile she herself came towards me, and began to defend  herself, saying, with many tears, that she had gone up the mountain by  night, against my commands, to get so much amber that she might secretly  buy for me, against my birthday, the _Opera Sancti Augustim_, which the  Cantor at Wolgast wanted to sell. That it was not her fault that the young  lord lay in wait for her one night; and that she would swear to me, by the  living God, that nought that was unseemly had happened between them there,  and that she was still a maid.    And herewith the first hearing was at end, for after _Dom. Consul_ had  whispered somewhat into the ear of the Sheriff, he called in the constable  again, and bade him keep good watch over _Rea_; _item_, not to leave her  at large in her dungeon any longer, but to put her in chains. These words  pierced my very heart, and I besought his worship to consider my sacred  office, and my ancient noble birth, and not to do me such dishonour as to  put my daughter in chains. That I would answer for her to the worshipful  court with my own head that she would not escape. Whereupon _Dom. Consul_,  after he had gone to look at the dungeon himself, granted me my request,  and commanded the constable to leave her as she had been hitherto.          _The Nineteenth Chapter_      HOW SATAN, BY THE PERMISSION OF THE MOST RIGHTEOUS GOD, SOUGHT ALTOGETHER  TO RUIN US, AND HOW WE LOST ALL HOPE    The same day, at about three in the afternoon, when I was gone to Conrad  Seep his alehouse to eat something, seeing that it was now nearly two days  since I had tasted aught save my tears, and he had placed before me some  bread and sausage, together with a mug of beer, the constable came into  the room and greeted me from the Sheriff, without, however, so much as  touching his cap, asking whether I would not dine with his lordship; that  his lordship had not remembered till now that I belike was still fasting,  seeing the trial had lasted so long. Hereupon I made answer to the  constable that I already had my dinner before me, as he saw himself, and  desired that his lordship would hold me excused. Hereat the fellow  wondered greatly, and answered; did I not see that his lordship wished me  well, albeit I had preached at him as though he were a Jew? I should think  on my daughter, and be somewhat more ready to do his lordship's will,  whereby peradventure all would yet end well. For his lordship was not such  a rough ass as _Dom. Consul_, and meant well by my child and me, as  beseemed a righteous magistrate.    After I had with some trouble rid myself of this impudent fox, I tried to  eat a bit, but nothing would go down save the beer. I therefore soon sat  and thought again whether I would not lodge with Conrad Seep, so as to be  always near my child; _item_, whether I should not hand over my poor  misguided flock to M. Vigelius, the pastor of Benz, for such time as the  Lord still should prove me. In about an hour I saw through the window how  that an empty coach drove to the castle, and the Sheriff and _Dom. Consul_  straightway stepped thereinto with my child; _item_, the constable climbed  up behind. Hereupon I left everything on the table and ran to the coach,  asking humbly whither they were about to take my poor child; and when I  heard they were going to the Streckelberg to look after the amber, I  begged them to take me also, and to suffer me to sit by my child, for who  could tell how much longer I might yet sit by her! This was granted to me,  and on the way the Sheriff ordered me to take up my abode in the castle  and to dine at his table as often as I pleased, and that he would,  moreover, send my child her meat from his own table. For that he had a  Christian heart, and well knew that we were to forgive our enemies. But I  refused his kindness with humble thanks, as my child did also, seeing we  were not yet so poor that we could not maintain ourselves. As we passed by  the watermill the ungodly varlet there again thrust his head out of a hole  and pulled wry faces at my child; but, dear reader, he got something to  remember it by; for the Sheriff beckoned to the constable to fetch the  fellow out, and after he had reproached him with the tricks he had twice  played my child, the constable had to take the coachman his new whip and  to give him fifty lashes, which, God knows, were not laid on with a  feather. He bellowed like a bull, which, however, no one heard for the  noise of the mill-wheels, and when at last he did as though he could not  stir, we left him lying on the ground and went on our way.    As we drove through Uekeritze a number of people flocked together, but  were quiet enough, save one fellow who, _salva venia_, mocked at us with  unseemly gestures in the midst of the road when he saw us coming. The  constable had to jump down again, but could not catch him, and the others  would not give him up, but pretended that they had only looked at our  coach and had not marked him. May be this was true! And I am therefore  inclined to think that it was Satan himself who did it to mock at us; for  mark, for God's sake, what happened to us on the Streckelberg! Alas!  through the delusions of the foul fiend, we could not find the spot where  we had dug for the amber. For when we came to where we thought it must be,  a huge hill of sand had been heaped up as by a whirlwind, and the  fir-twigs which my child had covered over it were gone. She was near  falling in a swound when she saw this, and wrung her hands and cried out  with her Saviour, \"My God, my God! why hast thou forsaken me!\"    Howbeit, the constable and the coachman were ordered to dig, but not one  bit of amber was to be found,"]]]
