Amid all the  confusion and multiplied dangers that arose from the fire, it does not  appear that more than _six_ persons lost their lives. Calamitous as were  the immediate consequences of this dreadful fire, its _remote effects_  have proved an incalculable blessing to subsequent generations. To  this conflagration may be attributed the complete destruction of the  _plague_, which, the year before only, swept off 68,590 persons!! To  this tremendous fire we owe most of our grand public structures--the  regularity and beauty of our streets--and, finally, the great salubrity  and extreme cleanliness of a large part of the city of London.    In relation to this awful calamity we add the following remarks:--Heaven  be praised (says Mr. Malcolm[6]) old London _was burnt_. Good reader,  turn to the ancient prints, in order to see what it has been; observe  those hovels convulsed; imagine the chambers within them, and wonder why  the plague, the leprosy, and the sweating-sickness raged. Turn then to  the prints illustrative of our present dwellings, and be happy. The  misery of 1665 must have operated on the minds of the legislature and  the citizens, when they rebuilt and inhabited their houses. The former  enacted many salutary clauses for the preservation of health, and would  have done more, had not the public rejected that which was for their  benefit; those who preferred high habitations and narrow dark streets  had them. It is only to be lamented that we are compelled to suffer for  their folly. These errors are now frequently partially removed by the  exertion of the Corporation of London; but a complete reformation is  impossible. It is to the improved dwellings composed of brick, the  wainscot or papered walls, the high ceilings, the boarded floors, and  large windows, and cleanliness, that we are indebted for the general  preservation of health since 1666. From that auspicious year the very  existence of the natives of London improved; their bodies moved in a  large space of pure air; and, finding every thing clean and new around  them, they determined to keep them so. Previously-unknown luxuries and  improvements in furniture were suggested; and a man of moderate fortune  saw his house vie with, nay, superior to, the old palaces of his  governors. When he paced his streets, he felt the genial western breeze  pass him, rich with the perfumes of the country, instead of the stench  described by Erasmus; and looking upward, he beheld the beautiful blue  of the air, variegated with fleecy clouds, in place of projecting black  beams and plaster, obscured by vapour and smoke.    The streets of London must have been dangerously dark during the winter  nights before it was burnt; lanterns with candles were very sparingly  scattered, nor was light much better distributed even in the new streets  previously to the 18th century. Globular lamps were introduced by  Michael Cole, who obtained a patent in July, 1708.    We conclude the illustrations of this day with a singular opinion of the  author just quoted. Speaking of the burning of London, he says, \"This  subject may be allowed to be familiar to me, and I have perhaps had more  than common means of judging; and I now declare it to be my full and  decided opinion, that London _was burnt by government, to annihilate the  plague_, which was grafted in every crevice of the hateful old houses  composing it.\"        [5] The progress of the fire might have been stopped, but for the          foolish conduct of the Lord Mayor, who refused to give orders          for pulling down some houses, _without the consent of the          owners_. Buckets and engines were of no use, from the confined          state of the streets.

The sheriffs moved on, the ordinary, the  culprits, and the officers did the same; and that class of attendants to  which I belonged followed. I shall not easily forget the circumstances  of this brief, but melancholy progress. The faltering step--the  deep-drawn sigh--the mingling exclamations of anguish and devotion which  marked the advance of the victims--the deep tones of the reverend  gentleman who now commenced reading a portion of the burial service, and  the tolling of the prison bell, which, as we proceeded through some of  the most dreary passages of the gaol, burst on the ear, rendered the  whole spectacle impressive beyond description. Few steps sufficed to  conduct us to the small room, or entrance-hall, into which the debtor's  door opens, and from this we saw the ladder which the criminals were to  ascend, and the scaffold on which they were to die. I was on the alert  to detect any sudden emotion which this spectacle might cause, but could  not perceive that it had the slightest effect. The minds of the  sufferers had been so prepared, that a partial view of the machine to  which they were being conducted, seemed to give no additional shock. No  further pause was deemed necessary. The clock was striking eight, and  the ordinary and the youth first brought to the press-room, immediately  passed up the ladder. To the two culprits that remained, the gentleman  whom I have already mentioned offered his services, and filled up with  a prayer the little interval which elapsed, before the second was  conducted to the platform.    I heard from without the murmur of awe, of expectation, and pity, which  ran through the crowd in front of the prison, and stepping on a small  erection to the left of the door, gained a momentary glimpse of a  portion of the immense multitude, who, uncovered, and in breathless  silence, gazed on the operations of the executioners. I retreated just  as the third halter had been adjusted. The finisher of the law was in  the act of descending, when the under-sheriff addressed him--    Is everything quite ready?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Then take care and draw the bolt out smartly.--Now, don't bungle it.\"    \"No, sir--you may depend upon it,\" was the answer. And the obsequious  anxiety of the hangman to seem polite and obliging, his apparent zeal  to give satisfaction, though very natural seemed to me not a little  curious.    Prayers, which had been interrupted for a moment, while the last awful  ceremony was in progress, were resumed. As he read them, I saw the  clergyman fix his eye on the executioner with a peculiar expression. He  drew his handkerchief from his pocket, and passed it slightly over his  upper lip. This was the fatal signal. A lumbering noise, occasioned by  the falling of part of the apparatus, announced that it had been obeyed.    In that moment, a rush from the scaffold forced me from the door.  The sheriffs, the under-sheriff, the ordinary, the gentleman who had  assisted him in preparing the sufferers for eternity, and several other  persons quitted the platform as expeditiously as possible, that they  might not behold the final agonies of the unhappy men. Sir Thomas took  me by the arm as he passed, and signified that he wished me to accompany  him. I did so. Again I marched through the passages which I had recently  traversed. Two minutes brought me to the door of the room to which I had  first been conducted. Here my friend accosted me with his natural  firmness of tone, which before had been considerably subdued by humane  emotions, and said--    \"You must breakfast with us.\"    I started at the unsentimental idea of eating the moment after quitting  so awful a spectacle, as that which I have attempted to describe. But  I had not sufficient energy to resist the good will which rather  unceremoniously handed me in. Here I found the other sheriff, the  ordinary, the under-sheriff, the city-marshal, and one or two of the  individuals I had previously met, already seated.    \"Well, it is all over,\" said Sir Thomas, as he took his seat at the  table.    \"Yes, it is,\" said the ordinary, in the same tone which I had heard a  few moments before, and admired as appropriately solemn. \"It is all  over, and--\" putting his cup and saucer to the under-sheriff, who  prepared to pour out the tea--\"I am very glad of it.\"    \"I hope you do not mean the breakfast is all over,\" remarked the  sheriff, whose wit I had previously admired, \"for I have had none yet.\"    The moment had not arrived at which humour like this could be duly  appreciated, and I did not observe that any of the company gave even  that sort of _note of face_ for a laugh which we had all used half an  hour before.    Our conversation turned naturally on the manner in which the sufferers  had conducted themselves; on the wishes they had expressed, and the  confessions they had made.    But while I looked on the hospitably spread table, I could not help  connecting operations rather different in their character, which must  have been going on at the same moment. \"In my mind's eye,\" I saw the  attendants carrying the fowl and eggs to the breakfast table, while the  sheriffs and their guests were conducting the sufferers to the scaffold.    From what I have already said, it must be inferred that the first  speeches which accomplished the circuit of the table, were of a very  serious character. But, mingled with them, some common breakfast-table  requests and civilities caught my attention, as singular from their  association. The performance of duties the most important cannot relieve  man from the necessity of claiming his \"daily bread,\" and I do not know  that it is any reproach to a clergyman that he is not distinguished by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11405"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 12, No. 342, (#3)"],[1,"of Luton gravely assured  me, that he had succeeded in discovering the Philosopher's Stone, and  also the Universal Solvent. The reports about him would have rendered it  culpable not to have hazarded anything for a personal interview. I learnt  that he had been a man of fashion, and at one time largely concerned in  adventures on the turf, but that for many years he had devoted himself to  his present pursuits; while for some time past, he had been inaccessible  and invisible to the world, the house being shut and barricadoed, and the  walls of his grounds protected by hurdles, with spring-guns so planted as  to resist intrusion in every direction. Under these circumstances, I had  no encouragement to go to Lilley, but I thought that even the external  inspection of such premises would repay me for the trouble. At Lilley,  I inquired for his house of various people, and they looked ominous; some  smiled, others shook their heads, and all appeared surprised at the  approach of an apparent visiter to Mr. Kellerman.    The appearance of the premises did not belie vulgar report. I could not  help shuddering at seeing the high walls of respectable premises, lined  at the top with double tiers of hurdles, and on driving my chaise to the  front of the house, I perceived the whole in a state of horrid  dilapidation. Contrary, however, to my expectation, I found a young man  who appeared to belong to the out-buildings, and he took charge of my  card for his master, and went to the back part of the house to deliver it.  The front windows on the ground-floor and upper stories were entirely  closed by inside shutters, much of the glass was broken, and the premises  appeared altogether as if deserted.  I was pleased at the words, \"My  master will be happy to see you,\" and in a minute the front door was  opened, and Mr. Kellerman presented himself.--I lament that I have not  the pencil of Hogarth, for a more original figure never was seen. He was  about six feet high, and of athletic make; on his head was a white  night-cap, and his dress consisted of a long great-coat once green, and  he had a sort of jockey waistcoat with three tiers of pockets. His manner  was extremely polite and graceful, but my attention was chiefly absorbed  by his singular physiognomy. His complexion was deeply sallow, and his  eyes large, black, and rolling. He conducted me into a very large parlour,  with a window looking backward, and having locked the door, and put the  key in his pocket, he desired me to be seated in one of two large arm  chairs covered with sheepskins. The room was a realization of the  well-known picture of Teniers' Alchemist. The floor was covered with  retorts, crucibles, alembics, jars, bottles in various shapes,  intermingled with old books piled upon each other, with a sufficient  quantity of dust and cobwebs. Different shelves were filled in the same  manner, and on one side stood his bed. In a corner somewhat shaded from  the light, I beheld two heads, white, with dark wigs on them; I  entertained no doubt therefore, that among other fancies he was engaged  in re-making the brazen speaking head of Roger Bacon and Albertus. Many  persons might have felt alarmed at the peculiarity of my situation, but  being accustomed to mingle with eccentric characters, and having no fear  from any pretensions of the black art, I was infinitely gratified by all  I saw.    Having stated the reports which I had heard, relative to his wonderful  discoveries, I told him frankly that mine was a visit of curiosity, and  stated that if what I had heard was matter of fact, the researches of the  ancient chemists had been unjustly derided. He then gave me a history of  his studies, mentioned some men whom I had happened to know in London,  who he alleged had assured him that they had made gold. That having in  consequence examined the works of the ancient alchemists, and discovered  the key which they had studiously concealed from the multitude, he had  pursued their system under the influence of new lights; and after  suffering numerous disappointments, owing to the ambiguity with which  they described their processes, he had, at length, happily succeeded; had  made gold, and could make as much more as he pleased, even to the extent  of paying off the national debt in the coin of the realm.    I yielded to the declaration, expressed my satisfaction at so  extraordinary a discovery, and asked him, to oblige me so far, as to show  me some of the precious metal which he had made.    \"Not so,\" said he; \"I will show it to no one. I made Lord Liverpool the  offer, that if he would introduce me to the king, I would show it to his  majesty; but Lord Liverpool insolently declined, on the ground that there  was no precedent; and I am therefore determined, that the secret shall  die with me. It is true that, in order to avenge myself of such contempt,  I made a communication to the French ambassador, Prince Polignac, and  offered to go to France, and transfer to the French government, the  entire advantages of the discovery; but after deluding me, and shuffling  for some time, I found it necessary to treat him with the same contempt  as the others.\"    I expressed my convictions in regard to the double dealing of men in  office.    \"O,\" said he, \"as to that, every court in Europe well knows that I have  made the discovery, and they are all in confederacy against me; lest by  giving it to any one, I should make that country master of all the  rest--the world, Sir,\" he exclaimed with great emotion, \"is in my hands  and my power.\"    Satisfied with this announcement of the discovery of the philosopher's  stone, I now inquired about the sublime alkahest or universal solvent,  and whether he had succeeded in deciphering the enigmatical descriptions  of the ancient writers on that most curious topic.    \"Certainly,\" he replied, \"I succeeded in that several years ago.\"    \"Then,\" I proceeded, \"have you effected the other great desideratum, the  fixing of mercury?\"    \"Than that process,\" said he, \"there is nothing more easy; at the same  time it is proper I should inform you, that there are a class of  impostors, who mistaking the ancient writers, pretend it can be done by  heat; but I can assure you, it can only be effected by water.\"    I then besought him to do me the favour, to show me some of his fixed  mercury, having once seen some which had been fixed by cold.    This proposition, however, he declined, because he said he had refused  others. \"That you may, however, be satisfied that I have made great  discoveries, here is a bottle of oil, which I have purified, and rendered  as transparent as spring water. I was offered L10,000. for this discovery;  but I am so neglected, and so conspired against, that I am determined it  and all my other discoveries shall die with me.\"    I now inquired, whether he had been alarmed by the ignorance of the  people in the country, so as to shut himself up in so unusual a manner.    \"No,\" he replied, \"not on their account wholly. They are ignorant and  insolent enough; but it was to protect myself against the governments of  Europe, who are determined to get possession of my secret by force. I  have been,\" he exclaimed, \"twice fired at in one day through that window,  and three times attempted to be poisoned. They believed I had written a  book containing my secrets, and to get possession of this book has been  their object. To baffle them, I burnt all that I had ever written, and I  have so guarded the windows with spring-guns, and have such a collection  of combustibles in the range of bottles which stand at your elbow, that I  could destroy a whole regiment of soldiers if sent against me.\" He then  related, that as a further protection he lived entirely in that room, and  permitted no one to come into the house; while he had locked up every  room except that with patent padlocks, and sealed the key-holes.    It would be tedious and impossible to follow Mr. Kellerman through a  conversation of two or three hours, in which he enlarged upon the merits  of the ancient alchemists, and on the blunders and impertinent  assumptions of the modern chemists, with whose writings and names it is  fair to acknowledge he seemed well acquainted. He quoted the authorities  of Roger and Lord Bacon, Paracelsus, Boyle, Boerhaave, Woolfe, and others,  to justify his pursuits. As to the term philosopher's stone, he alleged  that it was a mere figure, to deceive the vulgar. He appeared also to  give full credit to the silly story about Dee's assistant, Kelly, finding  some of the powder of projection in the tomb of Roger Bacon at  Glastonbury, by means of which, as was said, Kelly for a length of time  supported himself in princely splendour.    I inquired whether he had discovered the blacker than black of Apollonius  Tyaneus; and this, he assured me, he had effected; it was itself the  powder of projection for producing gold.    Amidst all this delusion and illusion on these subjects, Mr. Kellerman  behaved in other respects with great propriety and politeness; and having  unlocked the door, he took me to the doors of some of the other rooms, to  show me how safely they were padlocked; and on taking leave, directed me  in my course towards Bedford.    In a few minutes, I overtook a man, and on inquiring what the people  thought of Mr. Kellerman, he told me that he had lived with him for seven  years; that he was one of eight assistants whom he kept for the purpose  of superintending his crucibles, two at a time relieving each other every  six hours; that he had exposed some preparations to intense heat for many  months at a time, but that all except one crucible had burst, and that he  called on him to observe, that it contained the true \"blacker than black.\"  The man protested, however, that no gold had ever been made, and that no  mercury had ever been fixed; for he was quite sure, that if he had made  any discovery, he"]]]
