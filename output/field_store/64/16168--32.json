Obviously, from her viewpoint that was the only  thing to do. A cowpuncher who has ridden the range since he was  sixteen should not shirk a night ride in a blizzard, or fear losing  the trail. It was not storming so hard a man might not ride ten  miles--that is, a man like Charming Billy Boyle.    After that he was in great haste to be gone, and would scarcely wait  until Miss Bridger, proudly occupying the position of cook, told him  that the chicken stew was ready. Indeed, he would have gone without  eating it if she had not protested in a way that made Billy foolishly  glad to submit; as it was, he saddled his horse while he waited, and  reached for his sheepskin-lined, \"sour-dough\" coat before the last  mouthful was fairly swallowed. At the last minute he unbuckled his gun  belt and held it out to her.    \"I'll leave you this,\" he remarked, with an awkward attempt to appear  careless. \"You'll feel safer if you have a gun, and--and if you're  scared at anything, shoot it.\" He finished with another smile that  lighted wonderfully his face and his eyes.    She shook her head. \"I've often stayed alone. There's nothing in the  world to be afraid of--and anyway, I'll have the dog. Thank you, all  the same.\"    Charming Billy looked at her, opened his mouth and closed it without  speaking. He laid the gun down on the table and turned to go. \"If  anything scares yuh,\" he repeated stubbornly, \"shoot it. Yuh don't  want to count too much on that dawg.\"    He discovered then that Flora Bridger was an exceedingly willful young  woman. She picked up the gun, overtook him, and fairly forced it into  his hands. \"Don't be silly; I don't want it. I'm not such a coward as  all that. You must have a very poor opinion of women. I--I'm deadly  afraid of a gun!\"    Billy was not particularly impressed by the last statement, but he  felt himself at the end of his resources and buckled the belt around  him without more argument. After all, he told himself, it was not  likely that she would have cause for alarm in the few hours that  he would be gone, and those hours he meant to trim down as much as  possible.    Out of the coulee where the high wall broke the force of the storm, he  faced the snow and wind and pushed on doggedly. It was bitter riding,  that night, but he had seen worse and the discomfort of it troubled  him little; it was not the first time he had bent head to snow and  driving wind and had kept on so for hours. What harassed him most were  the icy hills where the chinook had melted the snow, and the north  wind, sweeping over, had frozen it all solid again. He could not ride  as fast as he had counted upon riding, and he realized that it would  be long hours before he could get back to the cabin with a horse from  Bridger's.    Billy could not tell when first came the impulse to turn back. It  might have been while he was working his way cautiously up a slippery  coulee side, or it might have come suddenly just when he stopped; for  stop he did (just when he should logically have ridden faster because  the way was smoother) and turned his horse's head downhill.    \"If she'd kept the gun--\" he muttered, apologizing to himself for  the impulse, and flayed his horse with his _romal_ because he did not  quite understand himself and so was ill at ease. Afterward, when he  was loping steadily down the coulee bottom with his fresh-made tracks  pointing the way before him, he broke out irrelevantly and viciously:  \"A real, old range rider yuh can bank on, one way or the other--but  damn a pilgrim!\"    The wind and the snow troubled him not so much now that his face was  not turned to meet them, but it seemed to him that the way was rougher  and that the icy spots were more dangerous to the bones of himself and  his horse than when he had come that way before. He did not know why  he need rage at the pace he must at times keep, and it did strike him  as being a foolish thing to do--this turning back when he was almost  halfway to his destination; but for every time he thought that, he  urged his horse more.    The light from the cabin window, twinkling through the storm, cheered  him a little, which was quite as unreasonable as his uneasiness. It  did not, however, cause him to linger at turning his horse into the  stable and shutting the door upon him. When he passed the cabin window  he glanced anxiously in and saw dimly through the half-frosted  glass that Miss Bridger was sitting against the wall by the table,  tight-lipped and watchful. He hurried to the door and pushed it open.    \"Why, hello,\" greeted the Pilgrim uncertainly, The Pilgrim was  standing in the centre of the room, and he did not look particularly  pleased. Charming Billy, every nerve on edge, took in the situation at  a glance, kicked the Pilgrim's dog and shook the snow from his hat.    \"I lost the trail,\" he lied briefly and went over to the stove. He did  not look at Miss Bridger directly, but he heard the deep breath which  she took.    \"Well, so did I,\" the Pilgrim began eagerly, with just the least  slurring of his syllables. \"I'd have been here before dark, only one  of the horses slipped and lamed himself. It was much as ever I got  home at all. He come in on three legs, and toward the last them three  like to went back on him.\"    \"Which hoss?\" asked Billy, though he felt pessimistically that he knew  without being told. The Pilgrim's answer confirmed his pessimism. Of  course, it was the only gentle horse they had.    \"Say, Billy, I forgot your tobacco,\" drawled the Pilgrim, after a very  short silence which Billy used for much rapid thinking.    Ordinarily, Billy would have considered the over sight as something of  a catastrophe, but he passed it up as an unpleasant detail and turned  to the girl. \"It's storming something fierce,\" he told her in an  exceedingly matter-of-fact way, \"but I think it'll let up by daylight  so we can tackle it. Right now it's out of the question; so we'll have  another supper--a regular blowout this time, with coffee and biscuits  and all those luxuries. How are yuh on making biscuits?\"    So he got her out of the corner, where she had looked too much at bay  to please him, and in making the biscuits she lost the watchful look  from her eyes. But she was not the Flora Bridger who had laughed at  their makeshifts and helped cook the chicken, and Charming Billy,  raving inwardly at the change, in his heart damned fervently the  Pilgrim.    In the hours that followed, Billy showed the stuff he was made of. He  insisted upon cooking the things that would take the longest time to  prepare; boasted volubly of the prune pies he could make, and then  set about demonstrating his skill and did not hurry the prunes in the  stewing. He fished out a package of dried lima beans and cooked some  of them, changing the water three times and always adding cold water.  For all that, supper was eventually ready and eaten and the dishes  washed--with Miss Bridger wiping them and with the Pilgrim eying them  both in a way that set on edge the teeth of Charming Billy.    When there was absolutely nothing more to keep them busy, Billy got  the cards and asked Miss Bridger if she could play coon-can--which was  the only game he knew that was rigidly \"two-handed.\" She did not  know the game and he insisted upon teaching her, though the Pilgrim  glowered and hinted strongly at seven-up or something else which they  could all play.    \"I don't care for seven-up,\" Miss Bridger quelled, speaking to him  for the first time since Billy returned. \"I want to learn this game  that--er--Billy knows.\" There was a slight hesitation on the name,  which was the only one she knew to call him by.    The Pilgrim grunted and retired to the stove, rattled the lids  ill-naturedly and smoked a vile cigar which he had brought from town.  After that he sat and glowered at the two.    Billy did the best he could to make the time pass quickly. He had  managed to seat Miss Bridger so that her back was toward the stove and  the Pilgrim, and he did it so unobtrusively that neither guessed his  reason. He taught her coon-can, two-handed whist and Chinese solitaire  before a gray lightening outside proclaimed that the night was over.  Miss Bridger, heavy-eyed and languid, turned her face to the window;  Billy swept the cards together and stacked them with an air of  finality.    \"I guess we can hit the trail now without losing ourselves,\" he  remarked briskly. \"Pilgrim, come on out and help me saddle up; we'll  see if that old skate of yours is able to travel.\"    The Pilgrim got up sullenly and went out, and Billy followed him  silently. His own horse had stood with the saddle on all night, and  the Pilgrim snorted when he saw it. But Billy only waited till the  Pilgrim had put his saddle on the gentlest mount they had, then took  the reins from him and led both horses to the door.    \"All right,\" he called to the girl; helped her into the saddle and  started off, with not a word of farewell from Miss Bridger to the  Pilgrim.    The storm had passed and the air was still and biting cold. The  eastern sky was stained red and purple with the rising sun, and  beneath the feet of their horses the snow creaked frostily. So they  rode down the coulee and then up a long slope to the top, struck the  trail and headed straight north with a low line of hills for their  goal. And in the hour and a half of riding, neither spoke a dozen  words.    At the door of her own home Billy left her, and gathered up the reins  of the Pilgrim's horse. \"Well, good-by. Oh, that's all right--it  wasn't any trouble at all,\" he said huskily when she tried to thank  him, and galloped away.          CHAPTER III.    _Charming Billy Has a Fight._      If Billy Boyle had any ideals he did not recognize them as such, and  he would not have known just how to answer you if you had asked him  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12225"],[0,"Tales of lonely trails (#3)"],[1,".    My experiences in the desert did not count much in the trip down this  strange, beautiful lost canyon. All canyons are not alike. This one  did not widen, though the walls grew higher. They began to lean and  bulge, and the narrow strip of sky above resembled a flowing blue  river. Huge caverns had been hollowed out by water or wind. And when  the brook ran close under one of these overhanging places the running  water made a singular indescribable sound. A crack from a hoof on a  stone rang like a hollow bell and echoed from wall to wall. And the  croak of a frog--the only living creature I noted in the canyon--was a  weird and melancholy thing.    \"We're sure gettin' deep down,\" said Joe Lee.    \"How do you know?\" I asked.    \"Here are the pink and yellow sego lilies. Only the white ones are  found above.\"    I dismounted to gather some of these lilies. They were larger than  the white ones of higher altitudes, of a most exquisite beauty and  fragility, and of such rare pink and yellow hues as I had never seen.    \"They bloom only where it's always summer,\" explained Joe.    That expressed their nature. They were the orchids of the summer  canyons. They stood up everywhere star-like out of the green. It was  impossible to prevent the mustangs treading them under foot. And as  the canyon deepened, and many little springs added their tiny volume  to the brook, every grassy bench was dotted with lilies, like a green  sky star-spangled. And this increasing luxuriance manifested itself  in the banks of purple moss and clumps of lavender daisies and  great mounds of yellow violets. The brook was lined by blossoming  buck-brush; the rocky corners showed the crimson and magenta of  cactus; and there were ledges of green with shining moss that sparkled  with little white flowers. The hum of bees filled the fragrant, dreamy  air.    But by and bye, this green and colorful and verdant beauty, the almost  level floor of the canyon, the banks of soft earth, the thickets and  clumps of cottonwood, the shelving caverns and bulging walls--these  features were gradually lost, and Nonnezoshe began to deepen in bare  red and white stone steps. The walls sheered away from one another,  breaking into sections and ledges, and rising higher and higher, and  there began to be manifested a dark and solemn concordance with the  nature that had created this old rent in the earth.    There was a stretch of miles where steep steps in hard red rock  alternated with long levels of round boulders. Here, one by one, the  mustangs went lame and we had to walk. And we slipped and stumbled  along over these loose, treacherous stones. The hours passed; the toil  increased; the progress diminished; one of the mustangs failed and was  left. And all the while the dimensions of Nonnezoshe Boco magnified  and its character changed. It became a thousand-foot walled canyon,  leaning, broken, threatening, with great yellow slides blocking  passage, with huge sections split off from the main wall, with immense  dark and gloomy caverns. Strangely it had no intersecting canyons. It  jealously guarded its secret. Its unusual formations of cavern and  pillar and half-arch led me to expect any monstrous stone-shape left  by avalanche or cataclysm.    Down and down we toiled. And now the stream-bed was bare of boulders  and the banks of earth. The floods that had rolled down that canyon  had here borne away every loose thing. All the floor, in places, was  bare red and white stone, polished, glistening, slippery, affording  treacherous foothold. And the time came when Wetherill abandoned the  stream-bed to take to the rock-strewn and cactus-covered ledges above.    The canyon widened ahead into a great ragged iron-lined amphitheater,  and then apparently turned abruptly at right angles. Sunset rimmed the  walls.    I had been tired for a long time and now I began to limp and lag. I  wondered what on earth would make Wetherill and the Indians tired. It  was with great pleasure that I observed the giant Joe Lee plodding  slowly along. And when I glanced behind at my straggling party it was  with both admiration for their gameness and glee for their disheveled  and weary appearance. Finally I got so that all I could do was to drag  myself onward with eyes down on the rough ground. In this way I kept  on until I heard Wetherill call me. He had stopped--was waiting for  me. The dark and silent Indian stood beside him, looking down the  canyon.    I saw past the vast jutting wall that had obstructed my view. A mile  beyond, all was bright with the colors of sunset, and spanning the  canyon in the graceful shape and beautiful hues of the rainbow was a  magnificent natural bridge.    \"Nonnezoshe,\" said Wetherill, simply.    This rainbow bridge was the one great natural phenomenon, the one  grand spectacle which I had ever seen that did not at first give vague  disappointment, a confounding of reality, a disenchantment of contrast  with what the mind had conceived.    But this thing was glorious. It absolutely silenced me. My body and  brain, weary and dull from the toil of travel, received a singular and  revivifying freshness. I had a strange, mystic perception that this  rosy-hued, tremendous arch of stone was a goal I had failed to reach in  some former life, but had now found. Here was a rainbow magnified even  beyond dreams, a thing not transparent and ethereal, but solidified, a  work of ages, sweeping up majestically from the red walls, its iris-hued  arch against the blue sky.    [Illustration: FIRST SIGHT OF THE GREAT NATURAL BRIDGE]    [Illustration: NONNEZOSHE]    Then we plodded on again. Wetherill worked around to circle the huge  amphitheater. The way was a steep slant, rough and loose and dragging.  The rocks were as hard and jagged as lava, and cactus hindered  progress. Soon the rosy and golden lights had faded. All the walls  turned pale and steely and the bridge loomed dark.    We were to camp all night under the bridge. Just before we reached it  Nas ta Bega halted with one of his singular motions. He was saying his  prayer to this great stone god. Then he began to climb straight up the  steep slope. Wetherill told me the Indian would not pass under the  arch.    When we got to the bridge and unsaddled and unpacked the lame mustangs  twilight had fallen. The horses were turned loose to fare for what  scant grass grew on bench and slope. Firewood was even harder to  find than grass. When our simple meal had been eaten there was gloom  gathering in the canyon and stars had begun to blink in the pale strip  of blue above the lofty walls. The place was oppressive and we were  mostly silent.    Presently I moved away into the strange dark shadow cast by the  bridge. It was a weird black belt, where I imagined I was invisible,  but out of which I could see. There was a slab of rock upon which I  composed myself, to watch, to feel.    A stiffening of my neck made me aware that I had been continually  looking up at the looming arch. I found that it never seemed the same  any two moments. Near at hand it was too vast a thing for immediate  comprehension. I wanted to ponder on what had formed it--to reflect  upon its meaning as to age and force of nature. Yet it seemed that all  I could do was to see. White stars hung along the dark curved  line. The rim of the arch appeared to shine. The moon was up there  somewhere. The far side of the canyon was now a blank black wall. Over  its towering rim showed a pale glow. It brightened. The shades in the  canyon lightened, then a white disk of moon peeped over the dark line.  The bridge turned to silver.    It was then that I became aware of the presence of Nas ta Bega. Dark,  silent, statuesque, with inscrutable face uplifted, with all that was  spiritual of the Indian suggested by a somber and tranquil knowledge  of his place there, he represented to me that which a solitary figure  of human life represents in a great painting. Nonnezoshe needed life,  wild life, life of its millions of years--and here stood the dark and  silent Indian.    Long afterward I walked there alone, to and fro, under the bridge. The  moon had long since crossed the streak of star-fired blue above, and  the canyon was black in shadow. At times a current of wind, with all  the strangeness of that strange country in its moan, rushed through  the great stone arch. At other times there was silence such as I  imagined might have dwelt deep in the center of the earth. And again  an owl hooted, and the sound was nameless. It had a mocking echo. An  echo of night, silence, gloom, melancholy, death, age, eternity!    The Indian lay asleep with his dark face upturned, and the other  sleepers lay calm and white in the starlight. I seemed to see in them  the meaning of life and the past--the illimitable train of faces  that had shone under the stars. There was something nameless in that  canyon, and whether or not it was what the Indian embodied in the  great Nonnezoshe, or the life of the present, or the death of the  ages, or the nature so magnificently manifested in those silent,  dreaming, waiting walls--the truth was that there was a spirit.    I did sleep a few hours under Nonnezoshe, and when I awoke the tip of  the arch was losing its cold darkness and beginning to shine. The sun  had just risen high enough over some low break in the wall to reach  the bridge. I watched. Slowly, in wondrous transformation, the gold  and blue and rose and pink and purple blended their hues, softly,  mistily, cloudily, until once more the arch was a rainbow.    I realized that long before life had evolved upon the earth this  bridge had spread its grand arch from wall to wall, black and mystic  at night, transparent and rosy in the sunrise, at sunset a flaming  curve limned against the heavens. When the race of man had passed it  would, perhaps, stand there still. It was not for many eyes to see.  The tourist, the leisurely traveler, the comfort-loving"]]]
