[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8952"],[0,"Scientific American, Volume 22, No. 1, January 1, 1870 (#20)"],[1,"by acids or salt  waters.\"    The above from a late number of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN states not only  the writer's ideas but also one of the greatest wants of the age. Iron  is daily being put to more and more varied uses. On land the great  question is what will prevent rust; on water, what will prevent rust and  fouling of bottoms of iron vessels. We will briefly summarize the many  patents granted for this purpose.    Eight are for sheathing of various kinds put on in varied modes. The  most practicable of these is a system prepared by Daft. Most iron  vessels are now constructed by every other plate lapping the edges of  the one between. He proposes, instead of having the plates all the same  width, to have one wide and one very narrow plate. This would leave a  trough between the two wide plates of the depth of the thickness of the  plates. He proposes to force into this trough very tightly pieces of  teak, and to the teak, thus embedded, he nails a sheathing of zinc. The  zinc is kept clean by slowly wearing away of its surface from action by  contact with the iron and salt water.    There are four patents, in which various, so-called, non-conducting  coats are put on the iron, and copper pigment in some form put on over  them. These have been specially condemned in England, as no matter how  good the non-conducting substance--and many are so only in name--it will  become rubbed off at some points, and there the bottom will be eaten  both by salt water and action of copper.    Coal tar and asphaltum are the subjects of patents in various forms.    One patent claims rubber or gutta-percha dissolved in linseed oil as a  vehicle in which to grind the pigment; another the same dissolved in  naphtha or bisulphide of carbon as a pigment; another hard rubber,  ground.    Enameling with different materials is proposed by some, while one  proposes to glaze the bottoms so that barnacles and grass would find a  slippery foothold.    Combinations of tallow, resin, and tar--mineral and pine--are patented  mostly to use over other paints.    Coal tar, sulphur, lime, and tallow, are the subject of one patent;  guano, red lead, and oil of another; while sulphur and silica are  claimed by a third.    Paints containing mercury, arsenic, and even strychnine, are the  subjects of several patents. A mixture of coal tar and mercurial  ointment of one.    Galvanism is proposed to be used in various ways--strips of copper and  zinc, or by galvanizing the plates before use. Black lead finds a place  in many compositions.    One patent, by a complicated process, effects a union of metallic zinc  and iron; this, granulated and ground fine, then mixed with red lead  and oil, makes the paint. It is said to be the best of all the patented  stuffs.    It is astonishing how many use oils derived from coal, peat, or resin,  and tars of the same.    There are about fifty patents for this object and with all of them  before their eyes, the British Society for the Advancement of Art still  hold the $5,000 reward for a pigment or covering which will perfectly  protect from rust and fouling. However they may puff their products for  selling, no one has the temerity to claim that they deserve the reward.    We think it would be difficult to find so many expedients ever before  adopted for the accomplishment of any one object. These are all English  patents, England having necessarily been obliged to use iron for vessels  from its cheapness as well as its consequent first introduction there.  In the United States no patents worth mentioning have been granted.    The first requisites for a pigment or coating for iron are, that it  should not contain any copper--the corrosive action of that metal on  iron being intense. Then if for work exposed to air it should form  such a coating as to be impervious to that gaseous fluid, and be  so constituted chemically as not to be oxidizable by it; if under  water--especially sea water--to be impermeable to moisture, so elastic  as not to crack, so insoluble as not to chloridize; to form a perfect,  apparently hard, coating: and yet wear just enough to keep off  incrustation, barnacles, or growth of grass. In fact, this slow wearing  away is the only preventive of fouling in iron vessels. Wooden bottoms  may be poisoned by solutions of copper--and that metal has no superior  for such uses, especially when it is combined in mixture with mineral  or resinous tars and spirits--these compounds, however, are not only  useless on iron bottoms, but also injurious. What then is _the_  substance: 1st. One of the oxides of lead (red lead). 2d. The purest  oxide of iron to be found. If properly made these articles can be  carried to no higher state of oxidation, and respectively, as to order  named, they have no superiors for body and durability. By preference,  1st, red lead, either out of or under water; 2d, Prince's oxide of iron  only, out of water. The color of these paints--the first red, the latter  brown, may be hidden by a coat of white or tinted color. If there were  to be had in combination as a white paint, an oxide of lead and an oxide  of zinc, it would be immensely superior to either, but that such has not  been produced is rather the fault of carelessness than of possibility.  Zinc protects iron with great effect, but it is too rapidly worn in the  effort to be of lasting value. Hence the great desideratum, the yet to  be, the coming pigment is a white oxide of lead or a combined white  oxide of lead and white oxide of zinc, without sulphates or chlorides.    Those materials answer very well for work exposed to atmospheric air,  and perhaps nothing will ever be found better; but a different need is  that for salt water. No mere protector of the iron from rust can be  found superior to pure red lead and linseed oil. We have seen a natural  combination of zinc, lead, and iron, which, in our experience, ranks  next; but the zinc is acted on by the chloride of sodium, and wears away  too much of the material. Red lead, however, while covering the iron  perfectly and effectually preventing rust, and also having but little  disposition to chloridize, when it does, will foul both with grass and  barnacles. Hence, the first desideratum being obtained, how shall we  accomplish the other. The prevention of fouling may be accomplished in  two ways: First, cover the vessel's bottom with two or even three coats  of red lead, and give each time to dry hard. Then melt in an iron pot a  mixture of two parts beeswax, two parts tallow, and one part pine resin;  mix thoroughly, and apply hot one or two coats. This mixture may be  tinted with vermilion or chrome green. It is not necessary to use any  poisonous substance, as it is only by its softness and gradual wear  that it is kept clean. Second, mix red lead and granular metallic zinc,  ground fine, or such a mineral as we have mentioned--crystalline and  granular in its character. Put on two or three coats, and allow each to  set--they will never dry hard. The zinc will slowly wear off, keeping  the whole surface clean, while there will be left enough coating of the  lead to preserve the iron from rust. The oil I would urge for these  pigments is linseed--as little boiled as possible, to be thinned with  spirits of turpentine. There seems to have been a mania for mixtures of  tar and resins, their spirits and oils; my experience fails to show me  any advantage for them on an iron bottom. They have neither elasticity  nor durability, while linseed oil has both in a pre-eminent degree, and  is no more likely to foul than they, when in a combination that does  not dry hard. Besides they are difficult to grind, inconvenient to  transport, and offensive to use.    Perhaps we have not, in the opinion of some, answered the want expressed  in the first paragraph. No pigment with the requisites of durability and  cheapness will resist the attacks of strong acids on iron. The first we  have mentioned will--all such as may float in our air from factories or  chemical works. Chemically it is converted by nitric acid and chlorine  into an insoluble substance--plumbic acid or the cyanide of lead. An  experience of more than three years, with almost unlimited means at our  command for experiment, demonstrates to us that we have indicated  the means of filling the other requisites asked for. It may be that  something new will be discovered, but we doubt it. Let any one tread the  road we have trod, investigate and experiment where and as much as we  have, and, if that place is, where we have not, and their experience  will be the same as ours.           *       *       *       *       *          THE BANANAS AND PLANTAINS OF THE TROPICS.    [For the Scientific American.]      Poets have celebrated the banana plant for its beauty, its luxuriance,  the majesty of its leaves, and the delicacy of its fruit; but never have  they sufficiently praised the utility of this tropical product.  Those who have never lived in southern countries are unable to fully  appreciate its value. Some look even with indifference upon the gigantic  clusters of this fruit, as they are unloaded from the steamers and  sailing vessels; and yet they deserve special attention and admiration,  for they are to the inhabitants of the torrid zone, what bread and  potatoes are to those of the north temperate zone.    The banana tree is one of the most striking illustrations of tropical  fertility and exuberance. A plant, which in a northern climate, would  require many years to gain strength and size, is there the production of  ten or twelve months. The native of the South plants a few grains, taken  from an old tree, in a moist and sandy soil, along some river or lake;  they develop with the greatest rapidity, and at the end of ten months  the first crop may be gathered, though the cluster and bananas are yet  small; but the following year one cluster alone will weigh some sixty or  more pounds.
