Thei eate as I haue said in the  wilde field together abrode, reioicing with a semblaunte of merinesse, and  a maner of singyng full vntuned. That done they falle vppon their women,  euen as they come to hande withoute any choyse: vtterly voide of care, by  reason they are alwaye sure of meate in good plentye.    Thus foure daies euer continual, busied with this bealy bownsing chiere,  the v. daie thei flocke together to go drincke, al on a droue, not vnlike  to a heard of kiene to the waters, shouting as they go with an Yrishe  whobub. And when they haue dronke till their bealies stonde a strutte, so  that they are skant able to retourne: euerye bodie layes him downe  dronckardelike to reste his water bolne bealy, and that daye eateth  nothing. The next daye agayne they fall to their fyshing: And so passe they  their lyfe continually.    Thei seldome falle into any diseases, for that they are alway of so  vniforme diete. Neuerthelesse they are shorter lyued then we are. Theyr  nature not corrupted by any perswasion taken of other, compteth the  satisfieng of hongre, the greatest pleasure in the world. As for other  extraordenary pleasures, they seke them not. This is the maner of liuing  propre vnto them that lye within the bosome of the sayde Arabique sea. But  the maner of them that dwell without the bosome, is moche more merueilous.  For thei neuer drinke ne neuer are moued with any passion of the mynde.  These beynge as it ware by fortune throwen oute into the desertes, farre  from the partes miete to be enhabited, giue them selues altogether to  fyshing, which they eate haulfe rawe. Not for to auoyde thirste (for they  desire no moyste thynges) but rather of a nature sauluage and wilde,  contented with such victualle as commeth to hande. They compte it a  principall blessednes to be withoute those thinges what so euer they be,  that bringe sorowe or griefe to their hauers. Thei are reported to be of  such patience, that though a manne strike them with a naked sweard, thei  will not shonne him, or flye from him. Beate them, or do theim wronge, and  they onely wil looke vppon you, neither shewinge token of wrathe, nor  countenaunce of pitie. Thei haue no maner of speache emong them: But onely  shewe by signes of the hande, and nodding with the heade, what they lacke,  and what they would haue. These people with a whole consent, are  mayntayners of peace towarde all men, straunger and other. The whiche maner  althoughe it be wondrefull, they haue kept time oute of mynde. Whether  throughe longe continuance of custome, or driuen by necessitie, or elles of  nature: I cannot saye. They dwell not as the other Icthiophagi doe, all in  one maner of cabanes, but sondry in diuers. Some haue their dennes, and  their cabanes in them opening to the North: to the ende they might by that  meanes be the bettre shadowed fro the sonne, and haue the colder ayre. For  those that are open toward the Southe, by the reason of the greate heate of  the sonne, caste forthe such a breathe, fornais like, that a manne can not  come niere them. They that open towarde the Northe, builde them preaty  Cabanes of the ribbes of whales (whiche in those seas they plentuously  find) compassing them aboute by the sides, accordynge to their naturall  bendinge, and fasteninge them together at bothe endes with some maner of  tyenge. Those do they couer with the woose and the wiedes of the sea  tempered together. And in these they shroude them selues fro the sonne:  nature by necessitie diuising a way how to helpe and defende her selfe.    Thus haue ye hearde the lyfe of the Icthiophagi, and now remaineth there  for Aphrique onely the Amazones to be spoken of, which menne saye in the  olde tyme dwelte in Libye. A kinde of warlike women, of greate force, and  hardinesse, nothing lyke in lyfe vnto our women. The maner amonge them was  to appointe to their maidens a certein space of yeres to be trayned, and  exercysed in the feictes of warre. Those beynge expired, they ware ioyned  to menne for yssues sake. The women bare all the rule of the commune  wealthe. The women ware princes, lordes, and officiers, capiteines, and  chiefteines of the warres. The menne had noughte to doe, but the drudgery  at home, and as the women woulde appoincte them. The children assone as  thei ware borne, were deliuered to the men to nouryshe vp with milke, and  suche other thinges as their tendrenes required. If it ware a boye, they  eyther brake the right arme assone as it was borne, that it mighte neuer be  fytte for the warres, or slue it, or sente it oute of the country. If a  wenche, they streighte ceared the pappes, that thei might not growe to  hindre them in the warres. Therefore the Grecians called theim Amazones, as  ye woulde saie, pappelesse. The opinion is, that thei dwelt in the Ilonde  named Hespera, which lieth in the marsshe, named (of a riuer that runneth  into it) Tritonis, ioyning vpon Ethiope, and the mounte Atlas, the greatest  of all that lande. This Ilonde is very large and greate, hauyng plentie of  diuers sortes of fruictes, whereby the enhabitauntes liue. Thei haue many  flockes of shiepe, and goates, and other small catteile, whose milke and  flesshe they eate. They haue no maner of graine, ne knowe what to doe  therwith.      OF ASIE.

This may be  the just view of the result of their communism and hospitality, but  it is a higher one than I have been able to take.    The household of the Mandans consisting of from twenty to forty  persons, the households of the Columbian tribes of about the same  number, the Shoshone household of seven families, the households of  the Sauks, of the Iroquois, and of the Creeks each composed of  several families, are fair types of the households of the Northern  Indians at the epoch of their discovery. The fact is also  established that these tribes constructed as a rule large joint  tenement houses, each of which was occupied by a large household  composed of several families, among whom provisions were in common,  and who practiced communism in living in the household.    Among the Village Indians of New Mexico a more advanced form of  house architecture appears, and their joint tenement character is  even more pronounced. They live in large houses, two, three, and  four stories high, constructed of adobe brick, and of stone imbedded  in adobe mortar, and containing fifty, a hundred, two hundred, and  in some cases five hundred apartments in a house. They are built in  the terraced form, with fireplaces and chimneys added since their  discovery, the first story closed up solid, and is entered by ladders,  which ascend to the platform-roof of the first story. These houses  are fortresses, and were erected as strongholds to resist the  attacks of the more barbarous tribes by whom they were perpetually  assailed. Each house was probably occupied by a number of household  groups, whose apartments were doubtless separated from each other by  partition walls. In a subsequent chapter the character of these  houses will be more fully shown.    Our knowledge of the plan of life in these houses in the aboriginal  period is still very imperfect. They still practice the old  hospitality, own their lands in common, but with allotments to  individuals and to families, and are governed by a cacique or sachem  and certain other officers annually elected. An American missionary  to the Laguna Village Indians, Rev. Samuel Gorman, in an address  before the Historical Society of New Mexico in 1869, remarks as  follows: \"They generally marry very young, and the son-in-law  becomes the servant of the father-in-law, and very often they all  live together in one family for years, even if there be several  sons-in-law; and this clannish mode of living is often, if not  generally, a fruitful source of evil among this people. Their women  generally have control over the granary, and they are more provident  than their Spanish neighbors about the future. Ordinarily they try  to have one year's provisions on hand. It is only when they have two  years of scarcity succeeding each other that pueblos as a community  suffer hunger.\" [Footnote: Address, p. 14.]    The usages of these Indians have doubtless modified in the last two  hundred years under Spanish influence; they have decreased in numbers,  and the family group is probably smaller than formerly. But it is  not too late to recover the aboriginal plan of life among them if  the subject were intelligently investigated. It is to be hoped that  some one will undertake this work.    The Spanish writers do not mention the practice of communism in  living as existing among the Village Indians of Mexico or Central  America. They are barren of practical information concerning their  mode of life; but we have the same picture of large households  composed of several families, whose communism in the household may  reasonably be inferred.    We have also the striking illustration of \"Montezuma's Dinner,\"  hereafter to be noticed, which was plainly a dinner in common by a  communal household. Beside these facts we have the ownership of  lands in common by communities of persons. Moreover, the ruins of  ancient houses in Central and South America, and in parts of Mexico,  show very plainly their joint tenement character. From the plans of  these houses the communism of the people by households may be  deduced theoretically with reasonable certainty.    Yucatan, when discovered, was occupied by a number of tribes of Maya  Indians. The Maya language spread beyond the limits of Yucatan. This  region, with Chiapas, Guatemala, and a part of Honduras, contained  and still contains evidence, in the ruins of ancient structures, of  a higher advancement in the arts of life than any other part of  North America. The present Maya Indians of Yucatan are the  descendants of the people who occupied the country at the period of  the Spanish conquest, and who occupied the massive stone houses now  in ruins, from which they were forced by Spanish oppression.    We have a notable illustration of communism in living among the  present Maya Indians, as late as the year 1840, through the work of  John L Stephens. At Nohcacab, a few miles east of the ruins of Uxmal,  Mr. Stephens, having occasion to employ laborers, went to a  settlement of Maya Indians, of whom he gives the following account:  \"Their community consists of a hundred labradores, or working men;  their lands are held and wrought in common, and the products are  shared by all. Their food is prepared at one hut, and every family  sends for its portion, which explains a singular spectacle we had  seen on our arrival, a procession of women and children, each  carrying an earthen bowl containing a quantity of smoking hot broth,  all coming down the same road, and disappearing among the different  huts. Every member belonging to the community, down to the smallest  pappoose, contributing in turn a hog. From our ignorance of the  language, and the number of other and more pressing matters claiming  our attention, we could not learn all the details of their internal  economy, but it seemed to approximate that improved state of  association which is sometimes heard of among us; and as theirs has  existed for an unknown length of time, and can no longer be  considered merely experimental, Owen on Fourier might perhaps take  lessons from them with advantage.\" [Footnote: Incidents of Travel in  Yucatan, ii, 14.]    A hundred working men indicate a total of five hundred persons, who  were then depending for their daily food upon a single fire, the  provisions being supplied from common stores, and divided from the  caldron. It is, not unlikely, a truthful picture of the mode of life  of their forefathers in the \"House of the Nuns,\" and in the  \"Governor's House\" at Uxmal, at the epoch of the Spanish conquest.    It is well known that Spanish adventurers captured these pueblos,  one after the other, and attempted to enforce the labor of the  Indians for personal ends, and that the Indians abandoned their  pueblos and retreated into the inaccessible forests to escape  enslavement, after which their houses of stone fell into decay, the  ruins of which, and all there ever was of them, still remain in all  parts of these countries.    It is hardly supposable that the communism here described by Mr.  Stephens was a new thing to the Mayas; but far more probable that it  was a part of their ancient mode of life, to which these ruined  houses were eminently adapted. The subject of the adaptation of the  old pueblo houses in Yucatan and Central America to communism in  living will be elsewhere considered.    When Columbus first landed on the island of Cuba, he sent two men  into the interior, who reported that \"they traveled twenty-two  leagues, and found a village of fifty houses, built like those  before spoken of, and they contained about one thousand persons,  because a whole generation lived in a house; and the prime men came  out to meet them, led them by the arms, and lodged them in one of  these new houses, causing them to sit down on seats ... and they  gave them boiled roots to eat, which tasted like chestnuts.\"  [Footnote: Herrera, i, 55.]    One of the first expeditions which touched the main land on the  coast of Venezuela in South America found much larger houses than  these last described. \"The houses they dwelt in were common to all,  and so spacious that they contained one hundred and sixty persons,  strongly built, though covered with palm-tree leaves, and shaped  like a bell.\" [Footnote: ib., 216.]    Herrera further remarks of the same tribe, that \"they observed no  law or rule in matrimony, but took as many wives as they would, and  they as many husbands, quitting one another at pleasure, without  reckoning any wrong done on either part. There was no such thing as  jealousy among them, all living as best pleased them, without taking  offense at one another.\" [Footnote: ib., i, 216.]    This shows communism in husbands as well as wives, and rendered  communism in food a necessity of their condition. Elsewhere the same  author speaks of the habitations of the tribes on the coast of  Carthagena. \"Their houses were like long arbors, with several  apartments, and they had no beds but hammocks.\" [Footnote: ib., 348.]  Many similar statements are scattered through his work.    Among the more advanced tribes of Peru the lands were divided, and  allotted to different uses; one part was for the support of the  government, another for the support of religion, and another for  the support of individuals. The first two parts were cultivated by  the people under established regulations, and the crops were placed  in public storehouses. This is the statement of Garcilasso.  [Footnote: Royal Com. l. c., pp. 154, 157.]    Herrera, however, says generally that the people lived from common  stores. \"The Spaniards drawing near to Caxamalca begun to have a  view of the Inca army lying near the bottom of a mountain.... They  were pleased to see the beauty of the fields, most regularly  cultivated, for it was an ancient law among these people that all  should be fed from common stores, and none should touch the standing  corn.\" [Footnote:"]]]
