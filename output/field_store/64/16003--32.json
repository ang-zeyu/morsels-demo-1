It appears to be a square of Stone Work  without a Ditch, with Bastions and furnished with Cannon. A little within  this fort are 2 battrys of 5 or 6 Guns each. They are designed to play  upon Shipping, but neither these battrys or the Fort are out of reach of  a Ship's Cannon. Hard by these batterys stands Fort Logie. It is an  irregular hexagon, built of Stone upon a Small Rock standing at the west  Entrance of the Bay, and is surrounded on all Sides by the Sea. It is  mounted with 14 or 15 guns, which are placed so as to play upon Shipping  going in and out of the Harbour. There is only one way to go into it,  which is by Steps Leading up to a Sally Port on the North-West side.  Opposite this is the Fort of Santa Cruze, built upon a low rocky point  that forms the East Entrance of the Bay. It hath the Appearance of a  Regular Fortification of Stone Work built upon the Slope of the Rock, on  which account there are in some places 2 Tier of Guns. It hath no Ditch  but on the Land side, where it is cut out of the Rock; in every other  part the Sea washes up to its Walls. It seems everywhere to be well  Mounted with Cannon Except on the land side, where none are wanting,  because they could be of no use, the land being so very high above it.  Yet, after all, neither this Fort nor those on the opposite shore do not  appear to be of any great Strength, even against Shipping, for which they  are wholly design'd, being the key of the Bay. They lay low, and Ships  may come so near as to have them entirely within the reach of their Guns;  but it would require 5 or 6 Sail of the line to insure Success. Between 2  and 3 Miles within the Entrance of the Bay, on the West Side, is the Isle  Borghleone, upon the east point of which is Erected a Battry of Stone,  and Mounted with 17 pieces of Cannon. Besides this, on the highest part  of the Island, is a Battry of 6 Guns mounted on an Open Platform. These  battrys are designed to play upon Shipping in the Bay, and seems not ill  designed for that purpose; yet they would be Obliged to Submit to the  Attack of Shipping or that of a Land force, there being nothing to hinder  the latter from Landing on the Island behind the Battrys. Opposite to  this Island, on the low point on the east side of the Bay, is the Battry  of St. Dominica of 7 Guns. A little without this Battry, on the East side  of the Bay, is a small but high Island, close to the Shore, on the Top of  which is the Church of Bonn Voyage, about half-way down the Cliff. Below  the Church is a Battry of 3 Guns. Neither the one nor the other of these  battry's are of much Consequence. They serve, indeed, to force Shipping  coming into the Bay between 2 Fires, and hinder them from Anchoring on  that side until they are silenced. The next fortification is that on the  Ilha dos Cobras, the east point and North side of which consists of a  Rampart Bastion and a Parrapet faced with Stones and mounted with Cannon,  but no Ditch, which is not much wanting, as the works are built on the  Edge of the rising Ground. The other side next the Town hath no other  inclosure but a plain wall without any Guns. It is said that the works on  this Island are in bad repair, on account of being so Extensive that they  would take more men to Defend them than they could spare, and, placing no  Dependancy on their Strength, let them go to decay. The ground on which  the Monastry of Benedictines Stands Commands the Works on the Island.  Over the South end of the City stands the Castle of St. Sebastian; it is  Seated upon a Hill, and Commands the whole Town; and this is all I know  of it, only that it is not counted a place of any great Strength. For the  Defence of these Forts and the Town the King of Portugal Maintains 7  Regiments of Regular Troops. Those I saw were well cloathed and in good  Condition; but this, as I was told, was not the Case with the whole.  Besides these Troops are 3 Regiments of Militia, 2 of Horse and one of  foot. These consist of the principal inhabitants of the place, who serve  without pay, Muster and Exercise in turns nine Months in the year, on  which account they rank with the Regular Troops.    The City of Rio de Janeiro is in the Latitude of 22 degrees 50 minutes  South and Longitude 42 degrees 15 minutes West from Greenwich.* (* Modern  determination, 22 degrees 54 minutes South, 43 degrees 10 minutes West.)  According to Observations made at Sea it is Seated on a plain close to  the Shore on the West side of the Bay, at the foot of Several high  Mountains. It is neither ill designed nor ill built. The Houses are  mostly stone, generally one and two Storys high, with Balconys to most of  them. The Streets are of a Convenient breadth, and Cross each other at  right Angles, and the whole City may be about 3 miles in Compass. It is  Govern'd by a Governor appointed by the King. The present Governor is Don  Anto Mendoyaz Fastada, who is no Friend to the English. It likewise is  the Residence of the Vice-Roy and Captain General of the States of  Brazil, who is as absolute as any Monarch on Earth, and the people to all  appearance as much Slaves. This City and Adjacent parts about the Bay are  said to contain 100,000 Souls; but not above a twentieth part are Whites.  The rest are blacks, many of whom are free, and seem to live in tolerable  Circumstances.    The city of Rio de Janeiro is supplied with Water from 2 Different parts  of the Adjacent Mountains. That which comes from the Southward is  Convey'd a Cross a Deep Valley by an Acquiduct, which Consists of a great  Number of Arches placed in 2 Rows, one upon the other; from thence in  pipes to a fountain which stands in the Middle of the Square before the  Vice-Roy's Palace. At another part of the City is a Reservoir, to which  the water is conveyed much in the same manner. From these 2 places, but  mostly from the former, the inhabitants fetch all they want, where there  is always a Centinel to keep order: and it is likewise here that the  Ships Water. They land their Casks upon a Smooth sandy beach about 100  yards from the Fountain, and upon application to the Vice-Roy you have a  Centinel to look after them and to clear the way for to come to the  fountain to fill water. Upon the whole, Rio de Janeiro is not a bad place  for Ships to put in at that want refreshments, not only because the  Harbour is safe and Commodious, but that Provision and all manner of  Refreshments may be had in tolerable plenty. Bread and Flour are,  however, Scarce and Dear, being brought hither from Europe, and are never  the better for that Passage. In lieu of these are to be had Yams and  Casada. All sorts of Grain--though it may be the produce of this  Country--is Dear. Fresh Beef (tho' bad) is to be had in plenty at about 2  1/4 pence per pound, and Jurked Beef about the same price. This is cured  with Salt, and dryd in the shade, the bones being taken out, and the Meat  cut into large but very thin slices. It eats very well, and if kept in a  dry place will remain good a long time at Sea. Rum, Sugar, and Molasses  are all good and Cheap. Tobacco is Cheap, but not good. Mutton they have  very little. Hogs and all sorts of Poultry are to be got, tho' in no  great plenty, and of Course rather dear. Garden Stuff and Fruit in  plenty, but none that will keep long at Sea except Pumpkins.    They have a Yard for building Shipping and a small Hulk for heaving down  by, there being no other method to come at a Ship's bottom, as the Tides  doth not rise above 6 or 7 feet. At the New and full Moon it is high  Water at that time about 8 o'clock, when the Land and Sea breezes are  regular, but when they are not the Course of Tides are alter'd. The Sea  breeze begins to blow about 10 or 12 o'clock, and continues until sunset,  when it dies away and is succeeded by the land breeze, which continues  most part of the night. From a little after sunrise until the Sea breeze  sets in it is generally Calm, and is then the Hotest and most  Disagreeable part of the whole day.      CHAPTER 2. RIO JANEIRO TO TAHITI.
