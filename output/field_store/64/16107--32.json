We expressed ourselves much pleased at this invitation, promised to  be sure to come, and then extended our walk to Ritzebuttel, where we  admired a small castle and a miniature park.    5th July.  Nothing is so changeable as the weather:  yesterday we  were revelling in sunshine, and today we were surrounded by a thick,  dark fog; and yet this, bad as it was, we found more agreeable than  the fine weather of the day before, for a slight breeze sprang up,  and at nine o'clock in the morning, we heard the rattling of the  capstan, as the anchor was being weighed.  In consequence of this,  the young people were obliged to give up the idea of an excursion to  the Bush, and defer all dancing with pretty girls until their  arrival in another hemisphere, for it was fated that they should not  set foot in Europe again.    The transition from the Elbe to the North Sea is scarcely  perceptible, as the Elbe is not divided into different channels, but  is eight or ten miles broad at its mouth.  It almost forms a small  sea of itself, and has even the green hue of one.  We were,  consequently, very much surprised, on hearing the captain exclaim,  in a joyful tone, \"We are out of the river at last.\"  We imagined  that we had long since been sailing upon the wide ocean.    In the afternoon, we bore in sight of the island of Heligoland,  which belongs to the English, and presented really a magical  appearance, as it rose out from the sea.  It is a barren, colossal  rock; and had I not learned, from one of the newest works on  geography, that it was peopled by about 2,500 souls, I should have  supposed the whole island to have been uninhabited.  On three sides,  the cliffs rise so precipitously from the waves, that all access is  impossible.    We sailed by the place at a considerable distance, and saw only the  towers of the church and lighthouse, in addition to the so-called  \"Monk,\" a solitary, perpendicular rock, that is separated from the  main body, between which and it there sparkles a small strip of sea.    The inhabitants are very poor.  The only sources of their livelihood  are fishing and bathing visitors.  A great number of the latter come  every year, as the bathing, on account of the extraordinary swell,  is reckoned extremely efficacious.  Unfortunately, great fears are  entertained that this watering-place cannot exist much longer, as  every year the island decreases in size, from the continual falling  away of large masses of rock, so that some day the whole place may  disappear into the sea.    From the 5th to the 10th of July, we had continued stormy and cold  weather, with a heavy sea, and great rolling of the ship.  All we  poor \"land-lubbers\" were suffering from sea sickness.  We first  entered the British Channel, also called \"La Manche\" (420 miles from  Cuxhaven) in the night of the 10-11th.    We awaited with impatience the rising of the sun, which would  display to our gaze two of the mightiest powers in Europe.  Luckily,  the day was fine and clear, and the two kingdoms lay before us, in  such magnificence and proximity, that the beholder was almost  inclined to believe that a sister people inhabited both countries.    On the coast of England, we saw the North Foreland, the Castle of  Sandown, and the town of Deal, stretching out at the foot of the  cliffs, which extend for many miles, and are about 150 feet high.  Further on, we came in sight of the South Foreland; and lastly, the  ancient castle of Dover, that sits right bravely enthroned upon an  eminence, and overlooks the surrounding country, far and wide.  The  town itself lies upon the sea-shore.    Opposite Dover, at the narrowest part of the channel, we  distinguished, on the French coast, Cape Grisnez, where Napoleon  erected a small building, in order, it is said, to be at least able  to see England; and, further on, the obelisk raised in memory of the  camp at Boulogne, by Napoleon, but completed under Louis Philippe.    The wind being unfavourable, we were obliged, during the night, to  tack in the neighbourhood of Dover.  The great darkness which  covered both land and sea rendered this maneuvre a very dangerous  one; firstly, on account of the proximity of the coast; and,  secondly, on account of the number of vessels passing up and down  the channel.  To avoid a collision, we hung out a lantern on the  foremast, while, from time to time, a torch was lighted, and held  over the side, and the bell frequently kept sounding:  all very  alarming occurrences to a person unused to the sea.    For fourteen days were we prisoners in the 360 miles of the Channel,  remaining very often two or three days, as if spell-bound, in the  same place, while we were frequently obliged to cruise for whole  days to make merely a few miles; and near Start we were overtaken by  a tolerably violent storm.  During the night I was suddenly called  upon deck.  I imagined that some misfortune had happened, and  hastily throwing a few clothes on, hurried up--to enjoy the  astonishing spectacle of a \"sea-fire.\"  In the wake of the vessel I  behold a streak of fire so strong that it would have been easy to  read by its light; the water round the ship looked like a glowing  stream of lava, and every wave, as it rose up, threw out sparks of  fire.  The track of the fish was surrounded by dazzling inimitable  brilliancy, and far and wide everything was one dazzling  coruscation.    This extraordinary illumination of the sea is of very unfrequent  occurrence, and rarely happens after long-continued, violent storms.  The captain told me that he had never yet beheld the sea so lighted  up.  For my part, I shall never forget the sight.    A second, and hardly less beautiful, spectacle came under our  observation at another time, when, after a storm, the clouds, gilt  by the rays of the sun, were reflected as in a mirror on the bosom  of the sea.  They glittered and shone with an intensity of colour  which surpassed even those of the rainbow.    We had full leisure to contemplate Eddystone Lighthouse, which is  the most celebrated building of the kind in Europe, as we were  cruising about for two days in sight of it.  Its height, and the  boldness and strength with which it is built, are truly wonderful;  but still more wonderful is its position upon a dangerous reef,  situated ten miles from the coast; at a distance, it seems to be  founded in the sea itself.    We often sailed so near the coast of Cornwall, that not only could  we plainly perceive every village, but even the people in the  streets and in the open country.  The land is hilly and luxuriant,  and appears carefully cultivated.    During the whole time of our cruising in the Channel, the  temperature was cold and raw, the thermometer seldom being higher  than 65 to 75 degrees Fah.    At last, on the 24th of July, we came to the end of the Channel, and  attained the open sea; the wind was tolerably favourable, and on the  2nd of August we were off Gibraltar, where we were becalmed for  twenty-four hours.  The captain threw several pieces of white  crockeryware, as well as a number of large bones overboard, to show  how beautifully green such objects appeared as they slowly sank down  beneath the sea; of course this can only be seen in a perfect calm.    In the evening we were greatly delighted by numbers of moluscae  shining through the water; they looked exactly like so many floating  stars, about the size of a man's hand; even by day we could perceive  them beneath the waves.  They are of a brownish red, and in form  resemble a toadstool; many had a thick pedicle, somewhat fimbriated  on the under part; others, instead of the pedicle, had a number of  threads hanging down from them.    4th August.  This was the first day that it was announced by the  heat that we were in a southern latitude; but, as was also the case  the following day, the clear dark blue sky that generally overarches  the Mediterranean in such exceeding loveliness, was still wanting.  We found, however, some slight compensation for this in the rising  and setting of the sun, as these were often accompanied by unusual  forms and colours of the clouds.    We were now off Morocco, and were fortunate enough today to perceive  a great number of bonitos.  Every one on board bestirred himself,  and on every side fish hooks were cast overboard; unluckily only one  bonito allowed himself to be entrapped by our friendly invitations;  he made a dart at the bait, and his good-natured confidence procured  us a fresh meal, of which we had long been deprived.    On the 5th of August we saw land for the first time for twelve days.  The sun was rising as the little island of Porto Santo greeted our  sight.  It is formed of peaked mountains, which, by their shape,  betray their volcanic origin.  A few miles in advance of the island  stands the beautiful Falcon Rock, like a sentinel upon the look-out.  We sailed past Madeira (23 miles from Porto Santo) the same day, but  unluckily at such a distance that we could only perceive the long  mountain chains by which the island is intersected.  Near Madeira  lie the rocky Deserta Islands, which are reckoned as forming part of  Africa.    Near these islands we passed a vessel running under reefed sails  before the wind, whence the captain concluded that she was a cruiser  looking after slavers.    On the 6th of August we beheld, for the first time, flying fish, but  at such a distance that we could scarcely distinguish them.    On the 7th of August we neared the Canary Isles, but unfortunately,  on account of the thick fog, we could not see them.  We now caught  the trade wind, that blows from the east, and is anxiously desired  by all sailors.    In the night of the 9-10th we entered the tropics.  We were now in  daily expectation of greater heat and a clearer sky, but met with  neither.  The atmosphere was dull and hazy, and even in our own"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11074"],[0,"The Damned (#3)"],[1," italicized words increasing recklessly  towards the end, with a repetition that Mabel would love to have me \"for  myself,\" as also to have a \"man in the house,\" and that I only had to  telegraph the day and the train.... This letter, coming by the second  post, interrupted me in a moment of absorbing work, and, having read it  through to make sure there was nothing requiring instant attention, I  threw it aside and went on with my notes and reading. Within five  minutes, however, it was back at me again. That restless thing called  \"between the lines\" fluttered about my mind. My interest in the Balkan  States--political article that had been \"ordered\"--faded. Somewhere,  somehow I felt disquieted, disturbed. At first I persisted in my work,  forcing myself to concentrate, but soon found that a layer of new  impressions floated between the article and my attention. It was like a  shadow, though a shadow that dissolved upon inspection. Once or twice I  glanced up, expecting to find some one in the room, that the door had  opened unobserved and Annie was waiting for instructions. I heard the  buses thundering across the bridge. I was aware of Oakley Street.    Montenegro and the blue Adriatic melted into the October haze along that  depressing Embankment that aped a riverbank, and sentences from the  letter flashed before my eyes and stung me. Picking it up and reading it  through more carefully, I rang the bell and told Annie to find the  blouses and pack them for the post, showing her finally the written  description, and resenting the superior smile with which she at once  interrupted. \"I know them, sir,\" and disappeared.    But it was not the blouses: it was that exasperating thing \"between the  lines\" that put an end to my work with its elusive teasing nuisance. The  first sharp impression is alone of value in such a case, for once  analysis begins the imagination constructs all kinds of false  interpretation. The more I thought, the more I grew fuddled. The letter,  it seemed to me, wanted to say another thing; instead the eight sheets  conveyed it merely. It came to the edge of disclosure, then halted.    There was something on the writer's mind, and I felt uneasy. Studying  the sentences brought, however, no revelation, but increased confusion  only; for while the uneasiness remained, the first clear hint had  vanished. In the end I closed my books and went out to look up another  matter at the British Museum library. Perhaps I should discover it that  way--by turning the mind in a totally new direction. I lunched at the  Express Dairy in Oxford Street close by, and telephoned to Annie that I  would be home to tea at five.    And at tea, tired physically and mentally after breathing the exhausted  air of the Rotunda for five hours, my mind suddenly delivered up its  original impression, vivid and clear-cut; no proof accompanied the  revelation; it was mere presentiment, but convincing. Frances was  disturbed in her mind, her orderly, sensible, housekeeping mind; she was  uneasy, even perhaps afraid; something in the house distressed her, and  she had need of me. Unless I went down, her time of rest and change, her  quite necessary holiday, in fact, would be spoilt. She was too unselfish  to say this, but it ran everywhere between the lines. I saw it clearly  now. Mrs. Franklyn, moreover--and that meant Frances too--would like a  \"man in the house.\" It was a disagreeable phrase, a suggestive way of  hinting something she dared not state definitely. The two women in that  great, lonely barrack of a house were afraid.    My sense of duty, affection, unselfishness, whatever the composite  emotion may be termed, was stirred; also my vanity. I acted quickly,  lest reflection should warp clear, decent judgment.    \"Annie,\" I said, when she answered the bell, \"you need not send those  blouses by the post. I'll take them down tomorrow when I go. I shall be  away a week or two, possibly longer.\" And, having looked up a train, I  hastened out to telegraph before I could change my fickle mind.    But no desire came that night to change my mind. I was doing the right,  the necessary thing. I was even in something of a hurry to get down to  The Towers as soon as possible. I chose an early afternoon train.          Chapter III      A telegram had told me to come to a town ten miles from the house, so I  was saved the crawling train to the local station, and traveled down by  an express. As soon as we left London the fog cleared off, and an autumn  sun, though without heat in it, painted the landscape with golden browns  and yellows. My spirits rose as I lay back in the luxurious motor and  sped between the woods and hedges. Oddly enough, my anxiety of overnight  had disappeared. It was due, no doubt, to that exaggeration of detail  which reflection in loneliness brings. Frances and I had not been  separated for over a year, and her letters from The Towers told so  little. It had seemed unnatural to be deprived of those intimate  particulars of mood and feeling I was accustomed to. We had such  confidence in one another, and our affection was so deep. Though she was  but five years younger than myself, I regarded her as a child. My  attitude was fatherly.    In return, she certainly mothered me with a solicitude that never  cloyed. I felt no desire to marry while she was still alive. She painted  in watercolors with a reasonable success, and kept house for me; I  wrote, reviewed books and lectured on aesthetics; we were a humdrum  couple of quasi-artists, well satisfied with life, and all I feared for  her was that she might become a suffragette or be taken captive by one  of these wild theories that caught her imagination sometimes, and that  Mabel, for one, had fostered. As for myself, no doubt she deemed me a  trifle solid or stolid--I forget which word she preferred--but on the  whole there was just sufficient difference of opinion to make  intercourse suggestive without monotony, and certainly without  quarrelling.    Drawing in deep draughts of the stinging autumn air, I felt happy and  exhilarated. It was like going for a holiday, with comfort at the end of  the journey instead of bargaining for centimes.    But my heart sank noticeably the moment the house came into view. The  long drive, lined with hostile monkey trees and formal wellingtonias  that were solemn and sedate, was mere extension of the miniature  approach to a thousand semidetached suburban \"residences\"; and the  appearance of The Towers, as we turned the corner with a rush, suggested  a commonplace climax to a story that had begun interestingly, almost  thrillingly. A villa had escaped from the shadow of the Crystal Palace,  thumped its way down by night, grown suddenly monstrous in a shower of  rich rain, and settled itself insolently to stay. Ivy climbed about the  opulent red-brick walls, but climbed neatly and with disfiguring effect,  sham as on a prison or--the simile made me smile--an orphan asylum.  There was no hint of the comely roughness of untidy ivy on a ruin.  Clipped, trained, and precise it was, as on a brand-new protestant  church. I swear there was not a bird's nest nor a single earwig in it  anywhere. About the porch it was particularly thick, smothering a  seventeenth-century lamp with a contrast that was quite horrible.  Extensive glass-houses spread away on the farther side of the house; the  numerous towers to which the building owed its name seemed made to hold  school bells; and the windowsills, thick with potted flowers, made me  think of the desolate suburbs of Brighton or Bexhill. In a commanding  position upon the crest of a hill, it overlooked miles of undulating,  wooded country southwards to the Downs, but behind it, to the north,  thick banks of ilex, holly, and privet protected it from the cleaner and  more stimulating winds. Hence, though highly placed, it was shut in.  Three years had passed since I last set eyes upon, it, but the unsightly  memory I had retained was justified by the reality. The place was  deplorable.    It is my habit to express my opinions audibly sometimes, when  impressions are strong enough to warrant it; but now I only sighed \"Oh,  dear,\" as I extricated my legs from many rugs and went into the house. A  tall parlor-maid, with the bearing of a grenadier, received me, and  standing behind her was Mrs. Marsh, the housekeeper, whom I remembered  because her untidy back hair had suggested to me that it had been burnt.  I went at once to my room, my hostess already dressing for dinner, but  Frances came in to see me just as I was struggling with my black tie  that had got tangled like a bootlace. She fastened it for me in a neat,  effective bow, and while I held my chin up for the operation, staring  blankly at the ceiling, the impression came--I wondered, was it her  touch that caused it?--that something in her trembled. Shrinking perhaps  is the truer word. Nothing in her face or manner betrayed it, nor in her  pleasant, easy talk while she tidied my things and scolded my slovenly  packing, as her habit was, questioning me about the servants at the  flat. The blouses, though right, were crumpled, and my scolding was  deserved. There was no impatience even. Yet somehow or other the  suggestion of a shrinking reserve and holding back reached my mind. She  had been lonely, of course, but it was more than that; she was glad that  I had come, yet for some reason unstated she could have wished that I  had stayed away. We discussed the news that had accumulated during our  brief separation, and in doing so the impression, at best exceedingly  slight, was forgotten. My chamber was large and beautifully furnished;  the hall and dining room of our flat would have gone into it with a good  remainder; yet it was not a place I could settle down in for work. It  conveyed the idea of impermanence, making me feel transient as in a  hotel bedroom. This, of course, was the fact. But some rooms convey a"]]]
