God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:    01:044:008 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we  brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we  steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?    01:044:009 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him  die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.    01:044:010 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he  with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.    01:044:011 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the  ground, and opened every man his sack.    01:044:012 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the  youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.    01:044:013 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass,  and returned to the city.    01:044:014 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was  yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.    01:044:015 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have  done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?    01:044:016 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we  speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity  of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also  with whom the cup is found.    01:044:017 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in  whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get  you up in peace unto your father.    01:044:018 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy  servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine  anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.    01:044:019 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a  brother?    01:044:020 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a  child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he  alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.    01:044:021 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me,  that I may set mine eyes upon him.    01:044:022 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father:  for if he should leave his father, his father would die.    01:044:023 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest  brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.    01:044:024 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my  father, we told him the words of my lord.    01:044:025 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.    01:044:026 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be  with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except  our youngest brother be with us.    01:044:027 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife  bare me two sons:    01:044:028 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn  in pieces; and I saw him not since:    01:044:029 And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye  shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.    01:044:030 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the  lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;    01:044:031 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with  us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs  of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.    01:044:032 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,  saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my  father for ever.    01:044:033 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of  the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.    01:044:034 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with  me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.    01:045:001 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that  stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there  stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his  brethren.    01:045:002 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh  heard.    01:045:003 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my  father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were  troubled at his presence.    01:045:004 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray  you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye  sold into Egypt.    01:045:005 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that  ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.    01:045:006 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet  there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor  harvest.    01:045:007 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the  earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.    01:045:008 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he  hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler  throughout all the land of Egypt.    01:045:009 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus  saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto  me, tarry not:    01:045:010 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be  near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and  thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:    01:045:011 And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years  of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to  poverty.    01:045:012 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother  Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.    01:045:013 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of  all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father  hither.    01:045:014 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and  Benjamin wept upon his neck.    01:045:015 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and  after that his brethren talked with him.    01:045:016 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,  Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his  servants.    01:045:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do  ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;    01:045:018 And take your father and your households, and come unto me:  and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the  fat of the land.    01:045:019 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of  the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring  your father, and come.    01:045:020 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of  Egypt is your's.    01:045:021 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them  wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision  for the way.    01:045:022 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to  Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of  raiment.    01:045:023 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden  with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and  bread and meat for his father by the way.    01:045:024 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said  unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.    01:045:025 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of  Canaan unto Jacob their father,    01:045:026 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor  over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed  them not.    01:045:027 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said  unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry  him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:    01:045:028 And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I  will go and see him before I die.    01:046:001 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to  Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.    01:046:002 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and  said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.    01:046:003 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go  down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:    01:046:004 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely  bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.    01:046:005 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel  carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in  the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.    01:046:006 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had  gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his  seed with him:    01:046:007 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his  sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.    01:046:008 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came  into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.    01:046:009 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and  Carmi.    01:046:010 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and  Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.    01:046:011 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.    01:046:012 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez,  and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of  Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.    01:046:013 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and  Shimron.    01:046:014 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8001"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 1: Genesis (#20)"],[1,"thereof: The three baskets are three days:    01:040:019 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off             thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat             thy flesh from off thee.    01:040:020 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's             birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he             lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker             among his servants.    01:040:021 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again;             and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:    01:040:022 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to             them.    01:040:023 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.    01:041:001 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh             dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.    01:041:002 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well             favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.    01:041:003 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the             river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other             kine upon the brink of the river.    01:041:004 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven             well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.    01:041:005 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven             ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.    01:041:006 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind             sprung up after them.    01:041:007 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.             And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.    01:041:008 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was             troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of             Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his             dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto             Pharaoh.    01:041:009 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do             remember my faults this day:    01:041:010 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the             captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:    01:041:011 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each             man according to the interpretation of his dream.    01:041:012 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to             the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted             to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did             interpret.    01:041:013 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he             restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.    01:041:014 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him             hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed             his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.    01:041:015 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and             there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of             thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.    01:041:016 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God             shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.    01:041:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood             upon the bank of the river:    01:041:018 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine,             fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:    01:041:019 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and             very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all             the land of Egypt for badness:    01:041:020 And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first             seven fat kine:    01:041:021 And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that             they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at             the beginning. So I awoke.    01:041:022 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one             stalk, full and good:    01:041:023 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the             east wind, sprung up after them:    01:041:024 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told             this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare             it to me.    01:041:025 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God             hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.    01:041:026 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears             are seven years: the dream is one.    01:041:027 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after             them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with             the east wind shall be seven years of famine.    01:041:028 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God             is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.    01:041:029 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all             the land of Egypt:    01:041:030 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and             all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and             the famine shall consume the land;    01:041:031 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of             that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.    01:041:032 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is             because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly             bring it to pass.    01:041:033 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise,             and set him over the land of Egypt.    01:041:034 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the             land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the             seven plenteous years.    01:041:035 And let them gather all the food of those good years that             come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them             keep food in the cities.    01:041:036 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven             years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the             land perish not through the famine.    01:041:037 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes             of all his servants.    01:041:038 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as             this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?    01:041:039 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed             thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:    01:041:040 Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall             all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater             than thou.    01:041:041 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all             the land of Egypt.    01:041:042 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon             Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and             put a gold chain about his neck;    01:041:043 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had;             and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler             over all the land of Egypt.    01:041:044 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee             shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of             Egypt.    01:041:045 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave             him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On.             And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.    01:041:046 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh             king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of             Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.    01:041:047 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by             handfuls.    01:041:048 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were             in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the             food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he             up in the same.    01:041:049 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,             until he left numbering; for it was without number.    01:041:050 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine             came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On             bare unto him.    01:041:051 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,             said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's             house.    01:041:052 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath             caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.    01:041:053 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of             Egypt, were ended.    01:041:054 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as             Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all             the land of Egypt there was bread.    01:041:055 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried             to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians,             Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.    01:041:056 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph             opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and             the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.    01:041:057 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;             because that the famine was so sore in all lands.    01:042:001 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said             unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?    01:04"]]]
