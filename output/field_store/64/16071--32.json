Now my mother and sisters, and  brother Jim, all the family except dad, make fun of my bread.\"    \"You have a brother? How old is he?\"    \"One brother--Jim, we call him. He--he is just past twenty-one.\" She  faltered the last few words.    Kurt felt on common ground with her then. The sudden break in her voice,  the change in her face, the shadowing of the blue eyes--these were  eloquent.    \"Oh, it's horrible--this need of war!\" she exclaimed.    \"Yes,\" he replied, simply. \"But maybe your brother will not be called.\"    \"Called! Why, he refused to wait for the draft! He went and enlisted.  Dad patted him on the back.... If anything happens to him it'll kill my  mother. Jim is her idol. It'd break my heart.... Oh, I hate the very  name of Germans!\"    \"My father is German,\" said Kurt. \"He's been fifty years in  America--eighteen years here on this farm. He always hated England. Now  he's bitter against America.... I can see a side you can't see. But I  don't blame you--for what you said.\"    \"Forgive me. I can't conceive of meaning that against any one who's  lived here so long.... Oh, it must be hard for you.\"    \"I'll let my father think I'm forced to join the army. But I'm going to  fight against his people. We are a house divided against itself.\"    \"Oh, what a pity!\" The girl sighed and her eyes were dark with brooding  sorrow.    A step sounded behind them. Mr. Anderson appeared, sombrero off, mopping  a very red face. His eyes gleamed, with angry glints; his mouth and chin  were working. He flopped down with a great, explosive breath.    \"Kurt, your old man is a--a--son of a gun!\" he exclaimed, vociferously;  manifestly, liberation of speech was a relief.    The young man nodded seriously and knowingly. \"I hope, sir--he--he--\"    \"He did--you just bet your life! He called me a lot in German, but I  know cuss words when I hear them. I tried to reason with him--told him I  wanted my money--was here to help him get that money off the farm, some  way or other. An' he swore I was a capitalist--an enemy to labor an' the  Northwest--that I an' my kind had caused the war.\"    Kurt gazed gravely into the disturbed face of the rancher. Miss Anderson  had wide-open eyes of wonder.    \"Sure I could have stood all that,\" went on Anderson, fuming. \"But he  ordered me out of the house. I got mad an' wouldn't go. Then--by George!  he pulled my nose an' called me a bloody Englishman!\"    Kurt groaned in the disgrace of the moment. But, amazingly, Miss  Anderson burst into a silvery peal of laughter.    \"Oh, dad!... that's--just too--good for--anything! You met your--match  at last.... You know you always--boasted of your drop of English  blood.... And you're sensitive--about your big nose!\"    \"He must be over seventy,\" growled Anderson, as if seeking for some  excuse to palliate his restraint. \"I'm mad--but it was funny.\" The  working of his face finally set in the huge wrinkles of a laugh.    Young Dorn struggled to repress his own mirth, but unguardedly he  happened to meet the dancing blue eyes of the girl, merry, provocative,  full of youth and fun, and that was too much for him. He laughed with  them.    \"The joke's on me,\" said Anderson. \"An' I can take one.... Now, young  man, I think I gathered from your amiable dad that if the crop of wheat  was full I'd get my money. Otherwise I could take over the land. For my  part, I'd never do that, but the others interested might do it, even for  the little money involved. I tried to buy them out so I'd have the whole  mortgage. They would not sell.\"    \"Mr. Anderson, you're a square man, and I'll do--\" declared Kurt.    \"Come out an' show me the wheat,\" interrupted Anderson. \"Lenore, do you  want to go with us?\"    \"I do,\" replied the daughter, and she took up her hat to put it on.    Kurt led them through the yard, out past the old barn, to the edge of  the open slope where the wheat stretched away, down and up, as far as  the eye could see.          CHAPTER II    \"We've got over sixteen hundred acres in fallow ground, a half-section  in rye, another half in wheat--Turkey Red--and this section you see, six  hundred and forty acres, in Bluestem,\" said Kurt.    Anderson's keen eyes swept from near at hand to far away, down the  gentle, billowy slope and up the far hillside. The wheat was two feet  high, beginning to be thick and heavy at the heads, as if struggling to  burst. A fragrant, dry, wheaty smell, mingled with dust, came on the  soft summer breeze, and a faint silken rustle. The greenish, almost blue  color near at hand gradually in the distance grew lighter, and then  yellow, and finally took on a tinge of gold. There was a living spirit  in that vast wheat-field.    \"Dorn, it's the finest wheat I've seen!\" exclaimed Anderson, with the  admiration of the farmer who aspired high. \"In fact, it's the only fine  field of wheat I've seen since we left the foot-hills. How is that?\"    \"Late spring and dry weather,\" replied Dorn. \"Most of the farmers'  reports are poor. If we get rain over the Bend country we'll have only  an average yield this year. If we don't get rain--then flat failure.\"    Miss Anderson evinced an interest in the subject and she wanted to know  why this particular field, identical with all the others for miles  around, should have a promise of a magnificent crop when the others had  no promise at all.    \"This section lay fallow a long time,\" replied Dorn. \"Snow lasted here  on this north slope quite a while. My father used a method of soil  cultivation intended to conserve moisture. The seed wheat was especially  selected. And if we have rain during the next ten days this section of  Bluestem will yield fifty bushels to the acre.\"    \"Fifty bushels!\" ejaculated Anderson.    \"Bluestem? Why do you call it that when it's green and yellow?\" queried  the girl.    \"It's a name. There are many varieties of wheat. Bluestem is best here  in this desert country because it resists drought, it produces large  yield, it does not break, and the flour-mills rate it very high.  Bluestem is not good in wet soils.\"    Anderson tramped along the edge of the field, peering down, here and  there pulling a shaft of wheat and examining it. The girl gazed with  dreamy eyes across the undulating sea. And Dorn watched her.    \"We have a ranch--thousands of acres--but not like this,\" she said.    \"What's the difference?\" asked Dorn.    She appeared pensive and in doubt.    \"I hardly know. What would you call this--this scene?\"    \"Why, I call it the desert of wheat! But no one else does,\" he replied.    \"I named father's ranch 'Many Waters.' I think those names tell the  difference.\"    \"Isn't my desert beautiful?\"    \"No. It has a sameness--a monotony that would drive me mad. It looks as  if the whole world had gone to wheat. It makes me think--oppresses me.  All this means that we live by wheat alone. These bare hills! They're  too open to wind and sun and snow. They look like the toil of ages.\"    \"Miss Anderson, there is such a thing as love for the earth--the bare  brown earth. You know we came from dust, and to dust we return! These  fields are human to my father. And they have come to speak to me--a  language I don't understand yet. But I mean--what you see--the growing  wheat here, the field of clods over there, the wind and dust and glare  and heat, the eternal sameness of the open space--these are the things  around which my life has centered, and when I go away from them I am not  content.\"    Anderson came back to the young couple, carrying some heads of wheat in  his hand.    \"Smut!\" he exclaimed, showing both diseased and healthy specimens of  wheat. \"Had to hunt hard to find that. Smut is the bane of all  wheat-growers. I never saw so little of it as there is here. In fact, we  know scarcely nothin' about smut an' its cure, if there is any. You  farmers who raise only grain have got the work down to a science. This  Bluestem is not bearded wheat, like Turkey Red. Has that beard anythin'  to do with smut?\"    \"I think not. The parasite, or fungus, lives inside the wheat.\"    \"Never heard that before. No wonder smut is the worst trouble for  wheat-raisers in the Northwest. I've fields literally full of smut. An'  we never are rid of it. One farmer has one idea, an' some one else  another. What could be of greater importance to a farmer? We're at war.  The men who claim to know say that wheat will win the war. An' we lose  millions of bushels from this smut. That's to say it's a terrible fact  to face. I'd like to get your ideas.\"    Dorn, happening to glance again at Miss Anderson, an act that seemed to  be growing habitual, read curiosity and interest, and something more, in  her direct blue eyes. The circumstance embarrassed him, though it tugged  at the flood-gates of his knowledge. He could talk about wheat, and he  did like to. Yet here was a girl who might be supposed to be bored.  Still, she did not appear to be. That warm glance was not politeness.    \"Yes, I'd like to hear every word you can say about wheat,\" she said,  with an encouraging little nod.    \"Sure she would,\" added Anderson, with an affectionate hand on her  shoulder. \"She's a farmer's daughter. She'll be a farmer's wife.\"    He laughed at this last sally. The girl blushed. Dorn smiled and shook  his head doubtfully.    \"I imagine that good fortune will never befall a farmer,\" he said.    \"Well, if it should,\" she replied, archly, \"just consider how I might  surprise him with my knowledge of wheat.... Indeed, Mr. Dorn, I am  interested. I've never been in the Bend before--in your desert of wheat.  I never before felt the greatness of loving the soil--or caring for  it--of growing things from seed. Yet the Bible teaches that, and I read  my Bible. Please tell us. The more you say the more I'll like it.\"    Dorn was not proof against this eloquence. And he quoted two of his  authorities, Heald and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10251"],[0,"Town Geology (#3)"],[1,"you?  That you do not take up your   opinions at second hand, from some book or some newspaper, which   after all only reflects your own feelings, your own opinions?  You   should ask yourselves that question, seriously and often:  \"Are my   thoughts really free?\"  No one values more highly than I do the   advantage of a free press.  But you must remember always that a   newspaper editor, however honest or able, is no more infallible than   the Pope; that he may, just as you may, only see one side of a   question, while any question is sure to have two sides, or perhaps   three or four; and if you only see the side which suits you, day   after day, month after month, you must needs become bigoted to it.    Your thoughts must needs run in one groove.  They cannot (as Mr.   Matthew Arnold would say) \"play freely round\" a question; and look it   all over, boldly, patiently, rationally, charitably.    And I tell you that if you, or I, or any man, want to let our   thoughts play freely round questions, and so escape from the tendency   to become bigoted and narrow-minded which there is in every human   being, then we must acquire something of that inductive habit of mind   which the study of Natural Science gives.  It is, after all, as   Professor Huxley says, only common sense well regulated.  But then it   is well regulated; and how precious it is, if you can but get it.    The art of seeing, the art of knowing what you see; the art of   comparing, of perceiving true likenesses and true differences, and so   of classifying and arranging what you see:  the art of connecting   facts together in your own mind in chains of cause and effect, and   that accurately, patiently, calmly, without prejudice, vanity, or   temper--this is what is wanted for true freedom of mind.  But   accuracy, patience, freedom from prejudice, carelessness for all   except the truth, whatever the truth may be--are not these the   virtues of a truly free spirit?  Then, as I said just now, I know no   study so able to give that free habit of mind as the Study of Natural   Science.    Equality, too:  whatever equality may or may not be just, or   possible; this at least, is just, and I hope possible; that every   man, every child, of every rank, should have an equal chance of   education; an equal chance of developing all that is in him by   nature; an equal chance of acquiring a fair knowledge of those facts   of the universe which specially concern him; and of having his reason   trained to judge of them.  I say, whatever equal rights men may or   may not have, they have this right.  Let every boy, every girl, have   an equal and sound education.  If I had my way, I would give the same   education to the child of the collier and to the child of a peer.  I   would see that they were taught the same things, and by the same   method.  Let them all begin alike, say I.  They will be handicapped   heavily enough as they go on in life, without our handicapping them   in their first race.  Whatever stable they come out of, whatever   promise they show, let them all train alike, and start fair, and let   the best colt win.    Well:  but there is a branch of education in which, even now, the   poor man can compete fairly against the rich; and that is, Natural   Science.  In the first place, the rich, blind to their own interest,   have neglected it hitherto in their schools; so that they have not   the start of the poor man on that subject which they have on many.    In the next place, Natural Science is a subject which a man cannot   learn by paying for teachers.  He must teach it himself, by patient   observation, by patient common sense.  And if the poor man is not the   rich man's equal in those qualities, it must be his own fault, not   his purse's.  Many shops have I seen about the world, in which fools   could buy articles more or less helpful to them; but never saw I yet   an observation-shop, nor a common-sense shop either.  And if any man   says, \"We must buy books:\" I answer, a poor man now can obtain better   scientific books than a duke or a prince could sixty years ago,   simply because then the books did not exist.  When I was a boy I   would have given much, or rather my father would have given much, if   I could have got hold of such scientific books as are to be found now   in any first-class elementary school.  And if more expensive books   are needed; if a microscope or apparatus is needed; can you not get   them by the co-operative method, which has worked so well in other   matters?  Can you not form yourselves into a Natural Science club,   for buying such things and lending them round among your members; and   for discussion also, the reading of scientific papers of your own   writing, the comparing of your observations, general mutual help and   mutual instructions?  Such societies are becoming numerous now, and   gladly should I see one in every town.  For in science, as in most   matters, \"As iron sharpeneth iron, so a man sharpeneth the   countenance of his friend.\"    And Brotherhood:  well, if you want that; if you want to mix with   men, and men, too, eminently worth mixing with, on the simple ground   that \"a man's a man for a' that;\" if you want to become the   acquaintances, and--if you prove worthy--the friends, of men who will   be glad to teach you all they know, and equally glad to learn from   you anything you can teach them, asking no questions about you, save,   first--Is he an honest student of Nature for her own sake?  And next-  -Is he a man who will not quarrel, or otherwise behave in an   unbrotherly fashion to his fellow-students?--If you want a ground of   brotherhood with men, not merely in these islands, but in America, on   the Continent--in a word, all over the world--such as rank, wealth,   fashion, or other artificial arrangements of the world cannot give   and cannot take away; if you want to feel yourself as good as any man   in theory, because you are as good as any man in practice, except   those who are better than you in the same line, which is open to any   and every man; if you wish to have the inspiring and ennobling   feeling of being a brother in a great freemasonry which owns no   difference of rank, of creed, or of nationality--the only   freemasonry, the only International League which is likely to make   mankind (as we all hope they will be some day) one--then become men   of science.  Join the freemasonry in which Hugh Miller, the poor   Cromarty stonemason, in which Michael Faraday, the poor bookbinder's   boy, became the companions and friends of the noblest and most   learned on earth, looked up to by them not as equals merely but as   teachers and guides, because philosophers and discoverers.    Do you wish to be great?  Then be great with true greatness; which   is,--knowing the facts of nature, and being able to use them.  Do you   wish to be strong?  Then be strong with true strength; which is,   knowing the facts of nature, and being able to use them.  Do you wish   to be wise?  Then be wise with true wisdom; which is, knowing the   facts of nature, and being able to use them.  Do you wish to be free?    Then be free with true freedom; which is again, knowing the facts of   nature, and being able to use them.    I dare say some of my readers, especially the younger ones, will   demur to that last speech of mine.  Well, I hope they will not be   angry with me for saying it.  I, at least, shall certainly not he   angry with them.  For when I was young I was very much of what I   suspect is their opinion.  I used to think one could get perfect   freedom, and social reform, and all that I wanted, by altering the   arrangements of society and legislation; by constitutions, and Acts   of Parliament; by putting society into some sort of freedom-mill, and   grinding it all down, and regenerating it so.  And that something can   be done by improved arrangements, something can be done by Acts of   Parliament, I hold still, as every rational man must hold.    But as I grew older, I began to see that if things were to be got   right, the freedom-mill would do very little towards grinding them   right, however well and amazingly it was made.  I began to see that   what sort of flour came out at one end of the mill, depended mainly   on what sort of grain you had put in at the other; and I began to see   that the problem was to get good grain, and then good flour would be   turned out, even by a very clumsy old-fashioned sort of mill.  And   what do I mean by good grain?  Good men, honest men, accurate men,   righteous men, patient men, self-restraining men, fair men, modest   men.  Men who are aware of their own vast ignorance compared with the   vast amount that there is to be learned in such a universe as this.    Men who are accustomed to look at both sides of a question; who,   instead of making up their minds in haste like bigots and fanatics,   wait like wise men, for more facts, and more thought about the facts.    In one word, men who had acquired just the habit of mind which the   study of Natural Science can give, and must give; for without it   there is no use studying Natural Science; and the man who has not got   that habit of mind, if he meddles with science, will merely become a   quack and a charlatan, only fit to get his bread as a spirit-rapper,   or an inventor of infallible pills.    And when I saw that, I said to myself--I will train myself, by   Natural Science, to the truly rational, and therefore truly able and   useful, habit of mind; and more, I will, for it is my duty as an   Englishman, train every Englishman over whom I can get influence in   the same scientific habit of mind, that I may, if possible, make him,   too, a rational and an able man.    And, therefore, knowing that most of you, my readers--probably all of   you, as you ought and must if you are Britons, think much of social   and political questions---therefore, I say, I entreat you to"]]]
