This is a  curious and uncommon shrub that one rarely sees outside the walls of a  botanic garden. The flowers are dark purple or chocolate brown, fully  2 inches across, and succeeded by a yellow, oblong, pulpy fruit, that  is relished by the natives, and from which the name of North American  Custard Apple has been derived. In this country it is quite at home,  growing around London to quite 12 feet in height, but it wants a warm,  dry soil, and sunny sheltered situation. As a wall plant it does well.      AZARA.    AZARA MICROPHYLLA.--Chili, 1873. This is the only recognised hardy  species, and probably the best from an ornamental point of view. In  mild seaside districts it may succeed as a standard in the open  ground, but generally it is cultivated as a wall plant, and for which  it is peculiarly suitable. The small dark green, glossy leaves are  thickly arranged on the nearly horizontal branches, while the flowers,  if they lack in point of showiness, are deliciously fragrant and  plentifully produced. For wall-covering, especially in an eastern  aspect, it is one of the neatest of shrubs.    Other species in cultivation are A. serrata, A. lanceolata, and A.  integrifolia, but for general planting, and unless under the most  favoured conditions, they are not to be recommended. The Azaras are by  no means particular about the quality of soil in which they are  planted, and succeed well even in stiffish loam, bordering on clay.      BACCHARIS.    BACCHARIS HALIMIFOLIA.--Groundsel Tree or Sea Purslane. North America.  For seaside planting this is an invaluable shrub, as it succeeds well  down even to high water mark, and where it is almost lashed by the  salt spray. The flowers are not very ornamental, resembling somewhat  those of the Groundsel, but white with a tint of purple. Leaves  obovate in shape, notched, and thickly covered with a whitish powder,  which imparts to them a pleasing glaucous hue. Any light soil that is  tolerably dry suits well the wants of this shrub, but it is always  seen in best condition by the seaside. Under favourable conditions it  attains to a height of 12 feet, with a branch spread nearly as much in  diameter. A native of the North American coast from Maryland to  Florida.    B. PATAGONICA.--Megallan. This is a very distinct and quite hardy  species, with small deep green leaves and white flowers. It succeeds  under the same conditions as the latter.      BERBERIDOPSIS.    BERBERIDOPSIS CORALLINA.--Coral Barberry. Chili, 1862. This handsome  evergreen, half-climbing shrub is certainly not so well known as its  merits entitle it to be. Unfortunately it is not hardy in every part  of the country, though in the southern and western English counties,  but especially within the influence of the sea, it succeeds well as  a wall plant, and charms us with its globular, waxy, crimson or  coral-red flowers. The spiny-toothed leaves approach very near those  of some of the Barberries, and with which the plant is nearly allied.  It seems to do best in a partially shady situation, and in rich light  loam.      BERBERIS.    BERBERIS AQUIFOLIUM (_syn Mahonia Aquifolium_).--Holly-leaved  Barberry. North America, 1823. This justly ranks as one of the  handsomest, most useful, and easily-cultivated of all hardy shrubs.  It will grow almost any where, and in any class of soil, though  preferring a fairly rich loam. Growing under favourable conditions to  a height of 6 feet, this North American shrub forms a dense mass of  almost impenetrable foliage. The leaves are large, dark shining green,  thickly beset with spines, while the deliciously-scented yellow  flowers, which are produced at each branch tip, render the plant  particularly attractive in spring. It is still further valuable both  on account of the rich autumnal tint of the foliage, and pretty plum  colour of the plentifully produced fruit.    B. AQUIFOLIUM REPENS (_syn Mahonia repens_).--Creeping Barberry. This  is of altogether smaller growth than the preceding, but otherwise they  seem nearly allied. From its dense, dwarf growth, rising as it rarely  does more than a foot from the ground, and neat foliage, this Barberry  is particularly suitable for edging beds, or forming a low evergreen  covering for rocky ground or mounds.    B. ARISTATA, a native of Nepaul, is a vigorous-growing species,  resembling somewhat our native plant, with deeply serrated leaves,  brightly tinted bark, and yellow flowers. It is of erect habit,  branchy, and in winter is rendered very conspicuous by reason of the  bright reddish colour of the leafless branches.    B. BEALEI (_syn Mahonia Bealli_).--Japan. This species is one of the  first to appear in bloom, often by the end of January the plant being  thickly studded with flowers. It is a handsome shrub, of erect habit,  the leaves of a yellowish-green tint, and furnished with long, spiny  teeth. The clusters of racemes of deliciously fragrant yellow flowers  are of particular value, being produced so early in the season.    B. BUXIFOLIA (_syn B. dulcis_ and _B. microphylla_).--Straits of  Magellan, 1827. A neat and erect-growing shrub of somewhat stiff and  upright habit, and bearing tiny yellow flowers. This is a good  rockwork plant, and being of neat habit, with small purplish leaves,  is well worthy of cultivation.    B. CONGESTIFLORA, from Chili, is not yet well-known, but promises to  become a general favourite with lovers of hardy shrubs. It is of  unusual appearance for a Barberry, with long, decumbent branches,  which are thickly covered with masses of orange-yellow flowers. The  branch-tips, being almost leafless and smothered with flowers, impart  to the plant a striking, but distinctly ornamental appearance.    B. DARWINII.--Chili, 1849. This is, perhaps, the best known and most  ornamental of the family. It forms a dense bush, sometimes 10 feet  high, with dark glossy leaves, and dense racemes of orange-yellow  flowers, produced in April and May, and often again in the autumn.    B. EMPETRIFOLIA.--Straits of Magellan, 1827. This is a neat-habited  and dwarf evergreen species, that even under the best cultivation  rarely exceeds 2 feet in height. It is one of the hardiest species,  and bears, though rather sparsely, terminal golden-yellow flowers,  which are frequently produced both in spring and autumn. For its  compact growth and neat foliage it is alone worthy of culture.    B. FORTUNEI (_syn Mahonia Fortunei_).--China, 1846. This is rather a  rare species in cultivation, with finely toothed leaves, composed of  about seven leaflets, and bearing in abundance clustered racemes of  individually small yellow flowers. A native of China, and requiring a  warm, sunny spot to do it justice.    B. GRACILIS (_syn Mahonia gracilis_).--Mexico. A pretty, half-hardy  species, growing about 6 feet high, with slender branches, and  shining-green leaves with bright red stalks. Flowers small, in 3-inch  long racemes, deep yellow with bright red pedicels. Fruit globular,  deep purple.    B. ILICIFOLIA (_syn B. Neumanii_).--South America, 1791. This is  another handsome evergreen species from South America, and requires  protection in this country. The thick, glossy-green leaves, beset with  spines, and large orange-red flowers, combine to make this species one  of great interest and beauty.    B. JAPONICA (_syn Mahonia japonica_).--Japan. This is not a very  satisfactory shrub in these isles, although in warm seaside districts,  and when planted in rich loam, on a gravelly subsoil, it forms a  handsome plant with noble foliage, and deliciously fragrant yellow  flowers.    B. NEPALENSIS (_syn Mahonia nepalensis_).--Nepaul Barberry. This is a  noble Himalayan species that one rarely sees in good condition in this  country, unless when protected by glass. The long, chalky-white stems,  often rising to 8 feet in height, are surmounted by dense clusters of  lemon-yellow flowers. Planted outdoors, this handsome and partly  evergreen Barberry must have the protection of a wall.    B. NERVOSA (_syn Mahonia glumacea_).--North America, 1804. This, with  its terminal clusters of reddish-yellow flowers produced in spring, is  a highly attractive North-west American species. It is of neat and  compact growth, perfectly hardy, but as yet it is rare in cultivation.  The autumnal leafage-tint is very attractive.    B. PINNATA (_syn Mahonia facicularis_).--A native of Mexico, this  species is of stout growth, with long leaves, that are thickly  furnished with sharp spines. The yellow flowers are produced  abundantly, and being in large bunches render the plant very  conspicuous. It is, unfortunately, not very hardy, and requires wall  protection to do it justice.    B. SINENSIS.--China, 1815. This is a really handsome and distinct  species, with twiggy, deciduous branches, from the undersides of the  arching shoots of which the flowers hang in great profusion. They are  greenish-yellow inside, but of a dark brownish-crimson without, while  the leaves are small and round, and die off crimson in autumn.    B. STENOPHYLLA, a hybrid between B. Darwinii and B. empetrifolia, is  one of the handsomest forms in cultivation, the wealth of  golden-yellow flowers being remarkable, as is also the dark purple  berries. It is very hardy, and of the freest growth.    B. TRIFOLIOLATA (_syn Mahonia trifoliolata_).--Mexico, 1839. This is a  very distinct and beautiful Mexican species that will only succeed  around London as a wall plant. It grows about a yard high, with leaves  fully 3 inches long, having three terminal sessile leaflets, and  slender leaf stalks often 2 inches long. The ternate leaflets are of a  glaucous blue colour, marbled with dull green, and very delicately  veined. Flowers small, bright yellow, and produced in few-flowered  axillary racemes on short peduncles. The berries are small, globular,  and light red.    B. TRIFURCA (_syn"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10885"],[0,"Stories from the Italian Poets: with Lives of the Writers, Volume 1 (#3)"],[1,"it as a patronymic in preference to their own. It would appear, from the  same poem, not only that the Alighieri were the more important house,  but that some blot had darkened the scutcheon of the Elisei; perhaps  their having been poor, and transplanted (as he seems to imply) from  some disreputable district. Perhaps they were known to have been of  ignoble origin; for, in the course of one of his most philosophical  treatises, he bursts into an extraordinary ebullition of ferocity  against such as adduce a knowledge of that kind as an argument against a  family's acquired nobility; affirming that such brutal stuff should be  answered not with words, but with the dagger.[3]    The Elisei, however, must have been of some standing; for Macchiavelli,  in his History of Florence, mentions them in his list of the early  Guelph and Ghibelline parties, where the side which they take is  different from that of the poet's immediate progenitors.[4] The arms of  the Alighieri (probably occasioned by the change in that name, for it  was previously written Aldighieri) are interesting on account of their  poetical and aspiring character. They are a golden wing on a field  azure.[5]    It is generally supposed that the name Dante is an abbreviation of  Durante; but this is not certain, though the poet had a nephew so  called. Dante is the name he goes by in the gravest records, in  law-proceedings, in his epitaph, in the mention of him put by himself  into the mouth of a blessed spirit. Boccaccio intimates that he was  christened Dante, and derives the name from the ablative case of _dans_  (giving)--a probable etymology, especially for a Christian appellation.  As an abbreviation of Durante, it would correspond in familiarity with  the Ben of Ben Jonson--a diminutive that would assuredly not have been  used by grave people on occasions like those mentioned, though a wit of  the day gave the masons a shilling to carve \"O rare Ben Jonson!\" on his  grave stone. On the other hand, if given at the font, the name of Ben  would have acquired all the legal gravity of Benjamin. In the English  Navy List, not long ago, one of our gallant admirals used to figure as  \"Billy Douglas.\"    Of the mother of Dante nothing is known except that she was his father's  second wife, and that her Christian name was Bella, or perhaps surname  Bello. It might, however, be conjectured, from the remarkable and only  opportunity which our author has taken of alluding to her, that he  derived his disdainful character rather from his mother than father.[6]  The father appears to have died during the boyhood of his illustrious  son.    The future poet, before he had completed his ninth year, conceived a  romantic attachment to a little lady who had just entered hers, and who  has attained a celebrity of which she was destined to know nothing. This  was the famous Beatrice Portinari, daughter of a rich Florentine who  founded more than one charitable institution. She married another man,  and died in her youth; but retained the Platonical homage of her young  admirer, living and dead, and became the heroine of his great poem.    It is unpleasant to reduce any portion of a romance to the events of  ordinary life; but with the exception of those who merely copy from  one another, there has been such a conspiracy on the part of Dante's  biographers to overlook at least one disenchanting conclusion to be  drawn to that effect from the poet's own writings, that the probable  truth of the matter must here for the first time be stated. The case,  indeed, is clear enough from his account of it. The natural tendencies  of a poetical temperament (oftener evinced in a like manner than the  world in general suppose) not only made the boy-poet fall in love, but,  in the truly Elysian state of the heart at that innocent and adoring  time of life, made him fancy he had discovered a goddess in the object  of his love; and strength of purpose as well as imagination made him  grow up in the fancy. He disclosed himself, as time advanced, only by  his manner--received complacent recognitions in company from the young  lady--offended her by seeming to devote himself to another (see the poem  in the _Vita Nuova_, beginning \"Ballata io vo\")--rendered himself the  sport of her and her young friends by his adoring timidity (see the 5th  and 6th sonnets in the same work)--in short, constituted her a paragon  of perfection, and enabled her, by so doing, to shew that she was none.  He says, that finding himself unexpectedly near her one day in company,  he trembled so, and underwent such change of countenance, that many of  the ladies present began to laugh with her about him--\"_si gabbavano di  me_.\" And he adds, in verse,      \"Con l'altre donne mia vista gabbate,    E non pensate, donna, onde si mova    Ch'io vi rassembri si figura nova,    Quando riguardo la vostra beltate,\" &c.          Son. 5.    \"You laugh with the other ladies to see how I look (literally, you mock  my appearance); and do not think, lady, what it is that renders me so  strange a figure at sight of your beauty.\"    And in the sonnet that follows, he accuses her of preventing pity of him  in others, by such \"killing mockery\" as makes him wish for death (\"_la  pieta, che 'l vostro gabbo recinde_,\" &c.)[7]    Now, it is to be admitted, that a young lady, if she is not very wise,  may laugh at her lover with her companions, and yet return his love,  after her fashion; but the fair Portinari laughs and marries another.  Some less melancholy face, some more intelligible courtship, triumphed  over the questionable flattery of the poet's gratuitous worship; and the  idol of Dante Alighieri became the wife of Messer Simone de' Bardi. Not  a word does he say on that mortifying point. It transpired from a clause  in her father's will. And yet so bent are the poet's biographers on  leaving a romantic doubt in one's mind, whether Beatrice may not have  returned his passion, that not only do all of them (as far as I have  observed) agree in taking no notice of these sonnets, but the author  of the treatise entitled _Dante and the Catholic Philosophy of the  Thirteenth Century_, \"in spite\" (as a critic says) \"of the _Beatrice,  his daughter, wife of Messer Simone de' Bardi_, of the paternal will,\"  describes her as dying in \"all the lustre of virginity.\" [8] The  assumption appears to be thus gloriously stated, as a counterpart to the  notoriety of its untruth. It must be acknowledged, that Dante himself  gave the cue to it by more than silence; for he not only vaunts her  acquaintance in the next world, but assumes that she returns his love in  that region, as if no such person as her husband could have existed, or  as if he himself had not been married also. This life-long pertinacity  of will is illustrative of his whole career.    Meantime, though the young poet's father had died, nothing was wanting  on the part of his guardians, or perhaps his mother, to furnish him with  an excellent education. It was so complete, as to enable him to become  master of all the knowledge of his time; and he added to this learning  more than a taste for drawing and music. He speaks of himself as drawing  an angel in his tablets on the first anniversary of Beatrice's death.[9]  One of his instructors was Brunetto Latini, the most famous scholar then  living; and he studied both at the universities of Padua and Bologna. At  eighteen, perhaps sooner, he had shown such a genius for poetry as  to attract the friendship of Guido Cavalcante, a young noble of a  philosophical as well as poetical turn of mind, who has retained a  reputation with posterity: and it was probably at the same time he  became acquainted with Giotto, who drew his likeness, and with Casella,  the musician, whom he greets with so much tenderness in the other world.    Nor were his duties as a citizen forgotten. The year before Beatrice's  death, he was at the battle of Campaldino, which his countrymen gained  against the people of Arezzo; and the year after it he was present at  the taking of Caprona from the Pisans. It has been supposed that he once  studied medicine with a view to it as a profession; but the conjecture  probably originated in nothing more than his having entered himself of  one of the city-companies (which happened to be the medical) for the  purpose of qualifying himself to accept office; a condition exacted of  the gentry by the then democratic tendencies of the republic. It is  asserted also, by an early commentator, that he entered the Franciscan  order of friars, but quitted it before he was professed; and, indeed,  the circumstance is not unlikely, considering his agitated and impatient  turn of mind. Perhaps he fancied that he had done with the world when it  lost the wife of Simone de' Bardi.    Weddings that might have taken place but do not, are like the reigns  of deceased heirs-apparent; every thing is assumable in their favour,  checked only by the histories of husbands and kings. Would the great  but splenetic poet have made an angel and a saint of Beatrice, had he  married her? He never utters the name of the woman whom he did marry.    Gemma Donati was a kinswoman of the powerful family of that name. It  seems not improbable, from some passages in his works, that she was the  young lady whom he speaks of as taking pity on him on account of his  passion for Beatrice;[10] and in common justice to his feelings as a man  and a gentleman, it is surely to be concluded, that he felt some sort  of passion for his bride, if not of a very spiritual sort; though he  afterwards did not scruple to intimate that he was ashamed of it, and  Beatrice is made to rebuke him in the other world for thinking of  any body after herself.[11] At any rate, he probably roused what was  excitable in his wife's temper, with provocations from his own; for the  nature of the latter is not to be doubted, whereas there is nothing but  tradition to shew for the "]]]
