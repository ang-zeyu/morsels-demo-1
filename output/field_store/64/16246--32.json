The power of regulating  the time of exposure is convenient for shortening long exposures in  dark interiors, or for lengthening inconveniently short exposures in  a bright light.    In practice it will be best to become familiar with the use of about  three stops, say the full aperture (perhaps F/5.6 or F/8), F/16, and  F/32.    For judging long exposures, the use of an actinometer (issued in many  inexpensive forms) is helpful.    A telephoto attachment increases the photographer's power of  rendering distant details on a large scale. The results are greatly  superior to enlargements of a small plate. It is, however, useless in  a wind, unless the camera is specially supported, and is otherwise  rather tricky to use. The traveller is strongly advised to master its  management at home. It should be adjusted by the maker to the camera  for which it is intended.    Unless a photographer's dark room can be had the developing of the  bulk is best left until the return home, but tests should be made to  see that the exposures are correct. A piece of ruby fabric or ruby  paper tied over an electric light will give a safe light after dark,  and 'Scalol' or some such one-solution developer which requires  merely the addition of water, will give all that is needed for  developing. For fixing use 4 oz. hypo to a pint of water.    In warm climates, use cold water. If it is not cool enough, the  gelatine of the negatives may give trouble. In that case, get colder  water, and use an alum bath. If water is precious, plates can be  sufficiently washed by moving them forward in succession, through  half-dozen soup plates filled with water.    If habitual use is not made of tabloid developers, &c., it is  advisable to have some in reserve, for use in the case of broken  bottles and spilt solutions.     Useful notes and maxims.    An over-exposed plate gives no dark shadows in the print.    An under-exposed plate gives no high lights. When in doubt, choose  the risk of over-exposure.    To test the safety of your camera--Half draw the shutter, and expose  part of the plate in the camera, in the sunshine, without uncapping  the lens, and develop.    To test the safety of your red light--Expose a plate, divide it into  two, develop half in the dark, and half for the same time, with the  same solution by the light you are testing, and compare the results.  This test is worth making, as photographers are apt to give  themselves much discomfort from exaggerated caution.     2. Itinerary.    Where there are efficient maps the only need is to mark in the  position of any antiquities, by cross-bearings to clear points, with  the compass, drawn in with a sharp pencil. Where the maps are too  small, or deficient, a continuous register of time should be made,  noting the minute of starting and of stopping; this over known  distances will serve to give the value over the unknown. Note whether  mounted or walking, and the compass bearing of the track; also the  bearings of known points around, whenever stopping. Without any known  bearings pacing and compass used carefully may go over the roughest  ground without five per cent. error in the day.    It is better when on unknown ground to plot a map as you go, so that  no misunderstanding of notes can arise after. If a squared block  cannot be used, at least draw the bearings and distances roughly,  writing in the amounts. This should be plotted up accurately in the  evening. A photograph may be unintelligible later in its detail. It  is best where known features, a temple, tombs, &c., are in a view, to  sketch the outline when photographing, and write in the details, so  as to give a key to the photograph. Inquire about antiquities  whenever stopping. When camping, villagers usually come up to see who  it is; then tell them the directions of the places around. They will  ask how you know; show them the map, and they are puzzled; talk over  all the names a few miles round, and then anything notable in the  district may be remarked, and inquiries made. Several men together  help each other to remember, and bring out more remarks. Sometimes an  intelligent man will describe all the antiquities he knows in the  district: this should be followed closely on the map, and  difficulties resolved at once, so as to get a clear record noted.    Of course, enormous exaggerations are met with, and not one report in  ten will prove to be anything. Tracking up the source of bought  antiquities is one of the best methods, and the one by which  Naukratis was found.    If travelling by camel, it is practicable to diverge widely on foot,  if objects are looked for well ahead. A foot track diverging 4.5  degrees, and then converging likewise, will easily keep in touch with  a baggage camel. Fix on the camping-place in the morning, and let  every one know of it, so that if accidentally parted all can rejoin  by night.     3. Recording.    Buildings or ruins.  Fix position by bearings to mapped points; also note bearings of any  prominent feature near by, which may serve for finding the position  again. Sketch a plan, always north up in the book, note bearing of  main wall, and then measure with bamboo rod all original dimensions,  with some diagonals to fix angles; do not forget the thickness of the  walls. It is best for a long length to stretch a tape, pegged down by  the ring, and pulled tight by hand: read off all positions of doors,  windows, cross-walls, &c., on one long length, and not as separate  short lengths. If possible plot the measures on squared paper as you  go, and then any errors or omissions will be checked at once. 'E. and  O.E.' has no place in a plan.    Town mounds.  Estimate height over bare land outside; eye height is a trifle over  five feet. At the foot of the mound see where the horizon cuts the  shoulder of it to find eye height; walk up to that point, and sight  another five feet; so on, till you see over the top. If there is any  section, by a stream side, or digging, or land-slip, look for strata,  stone or brick walls and floor levels, and for any distinctive  potsherds; observing levels as before. Look all over the top for  potsherds, to find the latest period of the town. Look around the  mound for any early potsherds. Sherds on the slopes are worth less;  as they have probably slipped down. Red burnt brick in Egypt is all  Roman or Arab; in Greece and Asia Minor, red brick and mortar is  Roman, Byzantine, or later.    Walk to the middle of the site or mound, and see its extent. Then  walk round the wall line, or circuit of it, pacing and compass  noting, to sketch the shape and size of the site: especially look for  any straight lines of wall showing. Sometimes a mud-brick wall may be  entirely denuded away, yet the position is shown by the sharp edge of  the strew of potsherds on the surface.    Look for any slag-heaps; these are the remains of lime burning, and  show where stone buildings existed; sometimes foundations still  remain. Look for any recent pits or trenches; these show where stone  or burnt brick has been dug out in modern times, and may give the  position and plan of a temple or church.    See if any rubbish mounds can be traced outside of the town site;  usually marked by a gentle walk-up slope, and a steep thrown-down  slope, and mainly consisting of pottery, e.g. Monte Testaccio at  Rome, and mounds east of Cairo.    Town sites rise in Egypt about forty inches a century, by the dust,  rubbish, and decay of mud-brick buildings. In Palestine the rise is  five feet a century, owing to the rains.    Cemeteries.  These have generally been more or less plundered; if recently, the  pits show; if anciently, there are scraps of pottery lying about. If  there are pebbles or marl thrown up from deep levels, there is  evidence of tombs, and they may be unplundered. Blown sand or grass  may hide all trace of tombs. Sometimes the whole masonry of a tomb  may have been removed, and the gravel filling-in have spread so  uniformly that there is no sign of building, although a course or two  of stone may yet remain under the surface. The surface of ground  should be closely looked over at sunrise or sunset to show up the  slight hollows or ridges by the shadows. After rain differences will  often appear in the drying of the ground. Ask any one near a site if  he knows of any one getting stones, or bronze, or plunder from tombs.  Anything found will probably be greatly exaggerated, and no clear  idea of the time of finding can be reached; yet any such detail may  be useful.    Any large town site must have a cemetery, which is near it in most  cases. In Egypt the towns being in the inundated land, the cemeteries  are at some miles distant on the desert. The prehistoric cemeteries  may be anywhere; the historic cemeteries are usually round the ends  of the dyke roads, which were thrown up in the early dynasties as  irrigation dams, and still serve as the roads of the country. In  Greek lands cemeteries are always outside a town, usually by the side  of the roads.    Caves should always be carefully explored; the roof and sides  searched for inscriptions or carvings; rock pockets in the sides  examined; and the floor dug over for potsherds and any small objects.  If there are different strata these should be each removed  separately, and the depth and positions of objects noted.     4. Methods of Planning.    Though we cannot here give full technical details of all the methods  for plans and surveys, it will be useful to state the scope of each  method, so that they may be kept in mind, and whichever is best  suited to the individual and his work may be provided for.     1. Plain pacing.  After pacing lengths of a few hundred feet, up and down hill and  flat, tape the distances, and learn true value of pace. Careful  pacing can be done to one or two per cent. of the whole; and properly  used, in triangles, may "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13579"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#3)"],[1,"the age to be of value as a  slave. Her memory is confined to that short childhood there and her  experiences of those days and immediately after the Civil War must be  taken from stories related to her by her parents in after years, and  these are dimly retained.    Her maiden name was Rosa Fox Ellison, taken as was the custom, from the  slave-holder who held her as a chattel. Her parents took her away from  the plantation when they were freed and lived in different localities,  supported by the father who was now paid American wages. Her parents  died while she was quite young and she married Fox Ellison, an ex-slave  of the Fox Ellison plantation. His name was taken from the same master  as was hers. She and her husband lived together forty-three years, until  his death. Nine children were born to them of which only one survives.  After this ex-slave husband died Rosa Ellison married a second time, but  this second husband died some years ago and she now remains a widow at  the age of seventy-six years. She recalls that the master of the Fox  Ellison plantation was spoken of as practicing no extreme discipline on  his slaves. Slaves, as a prevailing business policy of the holder, were  not allowed to look into a book, or any printed matter, and Rosa had no  pictures or printed charts given her. She had to play with her rag  dolls, or a ball of yarn, if there happened to be enough of old string  to make one. Any toy or plaything was allowed that did not point toward  book-knowledge. Nursery rhymes and folk-lore stories were censured  severely and had to be confined to events that conveyed no uplift,  culture or propaganda, or that conveyed no knowledge, directly or  indirectly. Especially did they bar the mental polishing of the three  R's. They could not prevent the vocalizing of music in the fields and  the slaves found consolation there in pouring out their souls in unison  with the songs of the birds.

MITTIE BLAKELEY--EX-SLAVE  2055 Columbia Avenue, Indianapolis, Indiana      Mrs. Blakeley was born, in Oxford, Missouri, in 1858.    Her mother died when Mittie was a baby, and she was taken into the \"big  house\" and brought up with the white children. She was always treated  very kindly.    Her duties were the light chores, which had to be well done, or she was  chided, the same as the white children would have been.    Every evening the children had to collect the eggs. The child, who  brought in the most eggs, would get a ginger cake. Mittie most always  got the cake.    Her older brothers and sisters were treated very rough, whipped often  and hard. She said she hated to think, much less talk about their awful  treatment.    When she was old enough, she would have to spin the wool for her  mistress, who wove the cloth to make the family clothes.    She also learned to knit, and after supper would knit until bedtime.    She remembers once an old woman slave had displeased her master about  something. He had a pit dug, and boards placed over the hole. The woman  was made to lie on the boards, face down, and she was beaten until the  blood gushed from her body; she was left there and bled to death.    She also remembers how the slaves would go to some cabin at night for  their dances; if one went without a pass, which often they did, they  would be beaten severely.    The slaves could hear the overseers, riding toward the cabin. Those, who  had come without a pass, would take the boards up from the floor, get  under the cabin floor, and stay there until the overseers had gone.      Interviewer's Comment    Mrs. Blakeley is very serious and said she felt so sorry for those, who  were treated so such worse than any human would treat a beast.

Irvin  District No. 2  Noblesville, Ind.    SLAVES IN MADISON COUNTY  CARL BOONE  Anderson, Indiana      This is a story of slavery, told by Carl Boone about his father, his  mother and himself. Carl is the last of eighteen children born to Mrs.  Stephen Boone, in Marion County, Kentucky, Sept. 15, 1850. He now  resides with his children at 801 West 13th Street, Anderson, Madison  County, Indiana. At the ripe old age of eighty-seven, he still has a  keen memory and is able to do a hard day's work.    Carl Boone was born a free man, fifteen years before the close of the  Civil War, his father having gained his freedom from slavery in 1829. He  is a religious man, having missed church service only twice in twenty  years. He was treated well during the time of slavery in the southland,  but remembers well, the wrongs done to slaves on neighboring  plantations, and in this story he relates some of the horrors which  happened at that time.    Like his father, he is also the father of eighteen children, sixteen of  whom are still living. He is grandfather of thirty-seven and great  grandfather of one child. His father was born in the slave state of  Maryland, in 1800, and died in 1897. His mother was born in Marion  County, Kentucky, in 1802, and died in 1917, at the age of one hundred  and fifteen years.    This story, word by word, is related by Carl Boone as follows: \"My name  is Carl Boone, son of Stephen and Rachel Boone, born in Marion County,  Kentucky, in 1850. I am father of eighteen children sixteen are still  living and I am grandfather of thirty-seven and great grandfather of one  child. I came with my wife, now deceased, to Indiana, in 1891, and now  reside at 801 West 13th street in Anderson, Indiana. I was born a free  man, fifteen years before the close of the Civil War. All the colored  folk on plantations and farms around our plantation were slaves and most  of them were terribly mistreated by their masters.    After coming to Indiana, I farmed for a few years, then moved to  Anderson. I became connected with the Colored Catholic Church and have  tried to live a Christian life. I have only missed church service twice  in twenty years. I lost my dear wife thirteen years ago and I now live  with my son.    My father, Stephen Boone, was born in Maryland, in 1800. He was bought  by a nigger buyer while a boy and was sold to Miley Boone in Marion  County, Kentucky. Father was what they used to call \"a picked slave,\"  was a good worker and was never mistreated by his master. He married my  mother in 1825, and they had eighteen children. Master Miley Boone gave  father and mother their freedom in 1829, and gave them forty acres of  land to tend as their own. He paid father for all the work he did for  him after that, and was always very kind to them.    My mother was born in slavery, in Marion County, Kentucky, in 1802. She  was treated very mean until she married my father in 1825. With him she  gained her freedom in 1829. I was the last born of her eighteen  children. She was a good woman and joined church after coming to Indiana  and died in 1917, living to be one hundred and fifteen years old.    I have heard my mother tell of a girl slave who worked in the kitchen of  my mother's master. The girl was told to cook twelve eggs for breakfast.  When the eggs were served, it was discovered there were eleven eggs on  the table and after being questioned, she admitted that she had eaten  one. For this, she was beaten mercilessly, which was a common sight on  that plantation.    The most terrible treatment of any slave, is told by my father in a  story of a slave on a neighboring plantation, owned by Daniel Thompson.  \"After committing a small wrong, Master Thompson became angry, tied his  slave to a whipping post and beat him terribly. Mrs. Thompson begged him  to quit whipping, saying, 'you might kill him,' and the master replied  that he aimed to kill him. He then tied the slave behind a horse and  dragged him over a fifty acre field until the slave was dead. As a  punishment for this terrible deed, master Thompson was compelled to  witness the execution of his own son, one year later. The story is as  follows:    A neighbor to Mr. Thompson, a slave owner by name of Kay Van Cleve, had  been having some trouble with one of his young male slaves, and had  promised the slave a whipping. The slave was a powerful man and Mr. Van  Cleve was afraid to undertake the job of whipping him alone. He called  for help from his neighbors, Daniel Thompson and his son Donald. The  slave, while the Thompsons were coming, concealed himself in a  horse-stall in the barn and hid a large knife in the manger.    After the arrival of the Thompsons, they and Mr. Van Cleve entered the  stall in the barn. Together, the three white men made a grab for the  slave, when the slave suddenly made a lunge at the elder Mr. Thompson  with the knife, but missed him and stabbed Donald Thompson.    The slave was overpowered and tied, but too late, young Donald was dead.    The slave was tried for murder and sentenced to be hanged. At the time  of the hanging, the first and second ropes used broke when the trap was  sprung. For a while the executioner considered freeing the slave because  of his second failure to hang him, but the law said, \"He shall hang by  the neck until dead,\" and the third attempt was successful.\"          Federal Writers' Project  of the W.P.A.
