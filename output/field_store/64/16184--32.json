[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12434"],[0,"Twelve Studies on the Making of a Nation: The Beginnings of Israel's History (#3)"],[1," in the world indications of a vital impulse toward  a higher manifestation of life--man.    Michael Angelo, with wonderful dramatic power, in his painting in  the Sistine Chapel at Rome has portrayed how lifeless clay in form  of man, when touched by the finger of God, by sheer vitalizing  power is transformed into a living soul.    Very different yet equally impressive is the modern scientific  view.  The origin of matter and of life is so absolutely unknown  that scientists have not as yet formulated definite theories  concerning it.  Even the theories regarding the origin of the solar  system are still conflicting and none is generally accepted.  The  old nebular hypothesis is discredited and the theory of the spiral  movement of the solar matter seems to be confirmed by phenomena  observable in the heavens.  The one principle generally held by  scientists is that, given matter and life and some creating force,  our present marvelous complex universe has come into being  according to laws usually called natural.  These laws are so  invariable that they may be considered unchanging.    Even more definitely established is the so-called theory of  evolution which is based on the careful observation and comparison  of countless thousands of natural phenomena.  According to the  Encyclopedia Britannica it is the history of the physical process  by which all living beings have acquired the characteristics,  physical, mental, moral, and spiritual, which now distinguish them.  It recognizes the gradual development from the simplest to the most  complex forms.  It is merely an attempt to describe in the light of  careful observation and investigation the process of growth by  which the world and the beings which inhabit it have grown into  what they are.    A comparison of the Hebrew account of creation with those of other  races and times is extremely suggestive.      II.    THE PRIESTLY STORY OF CREATION.    Note that the first and second chapters of Genesis contain two  distinct accounts of creation.    Read Genesis 1:1--2:3 (see _Hist. Bib_., I, pp. 231-3 for modern  translation), noting its picture of conditions in the universe  before the actual work of creation began.  The creative power is  the spirit or breath of God.  The Hebrew word for spirit (_ruah_)  represents the sound of the breath as it emerges from the mouth or  the sound of the wind as it sighs through the trees.  It is the  effective symbol of a real and mighty force that cannot be seen or  touched yet produces terrific effects, as when the cyclone rends  the forest or transforms the sea into a mountain of billows and  twists like straws the masts of wood and steel.  In the Old  Testament the \"spirit of God\" or the \"spirit of the Holy One\" is  God working (1) in the material universe, as in the work of  creation, (2) in human history, as when he directs the life of  nations, or (3) in the lives of men.    Note the method of creation and the distinctive work of each day.  The process is that of separation.  It is orderly and progressive.  The first three days of preparation in which (1) light and  darkness, (2) air and water (separated by the firmament) and (3)  land and vegetation are created, correspond to the work of the  second three days in which are created (1) the heavenly bodies, (2)  the birds and fishes (which live in the air and water) and (3) land  animals and man.  The underlying conception of the universe is that  held by most early peoples.  Compare the diagram in _Hastings'  Dictionary of the Bible_ I, 503 or Kent's _Student's Old  Testament_, Vol. I, p.  52 which illustrates it.    God's benign plan is revealed by the recurring words: \"God saw that  it was good.\"  What was the culminating act of creation?  \"Created  man in his image\" can not mean with a body like that of God (for in  this story God is thought of as a spirit), but rather with a  God-like spirit, mind, will, and power to rule.      III    THE EARLY PROPHETIC STORY OF CREATION.    The opening words of the second account of creation, which begins  in the fourth verse of the second chapter of Genesis, imply that  the earth and the heavens have already been created.    \"In the day that Jehovah made earth and heaven, no plant of the  field was yet on the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung  up, for Jehovah had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there  was no man to till the ground; but a mist used to rise from the  earth and water the whole face of the ground.\"    It is possible that here only a part of the original story is  preserved.  What is the order in the story of creation found in  this second chapter?  The method of man's creation?    According to this account, the tree of life was planted in the  garden that man, while he lived there, might enjoy immortality.  Was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil placed in the garden  to develop man's moral nature by temptation or merely to inculcate  obedience?    The love between the sexes is apparently implanted in all living  beings primarily for the conservation of the species, but the early  prophet also recognized clearly the broader intellectual and moral  aspects of the relation.  \"It is not good for man to be alone\" were  the significant words of Jehovah.  Hence animals, birds, and, last  of all, woman, were created to meet man's innate social needs.  Man's words on seeing woman were:      \"This, now, is bone of my bone      And flesh of my flesh.    This one shall be called woman,      For from man was she taken.\"    What fundamental explanation is here given of the institution of  marriage?  Compare Jesus' confirmation of this teaching in Matthew  19:4-5:    \"And he answered and said, Have ye not read, that he who made them  from the beginning made them male and female, and said, For this  cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to  his wife: and the two shall become one flesh?\"      IV.    A COMPARISON OF THE TWO ACCOUNTS OF CREATION.    The account of creation found in the second chapter suggests the  simple, direct ideas of a primitive people; while the account in  Genesis 1 has the exact, repetitious, majestic literary style of a  legal writer.  Are the differences between these two accounts of  creation greater than those between the parallel narratives in the  Gospels?  We recognize that the differences in detail between the  Gospel accounts of the same event are due to the fact that no two  narrators tell the same story in the same way.  Are the variations  between the two Biblical accounts of creation to be similarly  explained?  A growing body of Biblical scholars hold, though many  differ in judgment, that the account in the first chapter of  Genesis was written by a priestly writer who lived about four  hundred B.C., and the second account four hundred years earlier by  a patriotic, prophetic historian.    Observe that the two accounts agree in the following fundamental  teachings: (1) One supreme God is the Creator; (2) man is closely  akin to God; (3) all else is created for man's best and noblest  development.    Is the primary aim of these accounts to present scientific facts or  to teach religious truths?  Paul says in Timothy that \"Every  scripture inspired of God is also profitable for teaching, for  reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in  righteousness.\"  Is their religious value, even as in the parables  of the New Testament, entirely independent of their historical or  scientific accuracy?  Is there any contradiction between the  distinctive teachings of the Bible and modern science?  Do not the  Bible and science deal with two different but supplemental fields  of life: the one with religion and morals, the other with the  physical world?      V.    MAN'S CONQUEST AND RULERSHIP OF THE WORLD.    In the story of Genesis 1 man is commanded to subdue the earth and  to have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the  heavens and over every living thing that creeps upon the earth.  How far has man already subdued the animals and made them serve  him? How far has he conquered the so-called natural forces and  learned to utilize them?  Is the latter day conquest of the air but  a step in this progress?  Are all inventions and developments of  science in keeping with the purpose expressed in Genesis 1?  Does  the command imply the immediate or the gradual conquest of nature?  Why?  Do science and the Bible differ or agree in their answers to  these questions?      VI.    MAN'S RESPONSIBILITY AS THE RULER OF THE WORLD.    Consider the different ways in which the Biblical accounts of  creation state that man is akin to God.  In the one account man was  created in the image of God; in the other Jehovah formed man of the  dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils his own  life-giving breath.  In what sense is man God-like?  Are all men  \"made in the image of God\"?  Does this story imply that every man  has the right and capacity to become God-like?    A high official of China, whose power of authority extends to  questions of life and death, is called \"the father and mother of  his people.\"  If he fails in the responsibility which his authority  imposes upon him, and the people in consequence create a  disturbance, he is severely punished, sometimes by death.  Does  authority always imply responsibility?  Of what value to man is the  conquest of the forces of nature?  President Roosevelt said that he  considered the conservation of the natural resources of the United  States the most important question before the American people.  Is  this political question also a religious question?    Why did God give man authority over the animal world?  Does the  responsibility that comes from this authority rest upon every man?  One of the laws of the Boy Scouts reads:    \"A scout is kind.  He is a friend to animals.  He will not kill nor  hurt any living creature needlessly, but will strive to save and  protect all harmless "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12436"],[0,"The Night Horseman (#3)"],[1,"Friend, if  he ain't real, then I'm a ghost. And they's them in Elkhead that's got  the scars of his comin' and goin'.\"    \"Ah, an outlaw? A gunfighter?\" queried the doctor.    \"Listen to me, son,\" observed the host, and to make his point he tapped  the hollow chest of Byrne with a rigid forefinger, \"around these parts  you know jest as much as you see, and lots of times you don't even know  that much. What you see is sometimes your business, but mostly it  ain't.\" He concluded impressively: \"Words is worse'n bullets!\"    \"Well,\" mused Byrne, \"I can ask the girl these questions. It will be  medically necessary.\"    \"Ask the girl? Ask her?\" echoed the host with a sort of horror. But he  ended with a forced restraint: \"That's _your_ business.\"          CHAPTER III    THE DOCTOR RIDES      Hank Dwight disappeared from the doorway and the doctor was called from  his pondering by the voice of the girl. There was something about that  voice which worried Byrne, for it was low and controlled and musical and  it did not fit with the nasal harshness of the cattlemen. When she began  to speak it was like the beginning of a song. He turned now and found  her sitting a tall bay horse, and she led a red-roan mare beside her.  When he went out she tossed her reins over the head of her horse and  strapped his valise behind her saddle.    \"You won't have any trouble with that mare,\" she assured him, when the  time came for mounting. Yet when he approached gingerly he was received  with flattened ears and a snort of anger. \"Wait,\" she cried, \"the left  side, not the right!\"    He felt the laughter in her voice, but when he looked he could see no  trace of it in her face. He approached from the left side, setting his  teeth.    \"You observe,\" he said, \"that I take your word at its full value,\" and  placing his foot in the stirrup, he dragged himself gingerly up to the  saddle. The mare stood like a rock. Adjusting himself, he wiped a sudden  perspiration from his forehead.    \"I quite believe,\" he remarked, \"that the animal is of unusual  intelligence. All may yet be well!\"    \"I'm sure of it.\" said the girl gravely. \"Now we're off.\"    And the horses broke into a dog trot. Now the gait of the red roan mare  was a dream of softness, and her flexible ankles gave a play of whole  inches to break the jar of every step, the sure sign of the good  saddle-horse; but the horse has never been saddled whose trot is really  a smooth pace. The hat of Doctor Byrne began to incline towards his  right eye and his spectacles towards his left ear. He felt a peculiar  lightness in the stomach and heaviness in the heart.    \"The t-t-t-trot,\" he ventured to his companion, \"is a d-d-d-dam--\"    \"Dr. Byrne!\" she cried.    \"Whoa!\" called Doctor Byrne, and drew mightily in upon the reins. The  red mare stopped as a ball stops when it meets a stout wall; the doctor  sprawled along her neck, clinging with arms and legs. He managed to  clamber back into the saddle.    \"There are vicious elements in the nature of this brute,\" he observed to  the girl.    \"I'm very sorry,\" she murmured. He cast a sidelong glance but found not  the trace of a smile.    \"The word upon which I--\"    \"Stopped?\" she suggested.    \"Stopped,\" he agreed, \"was not, as you evidently assumed, an oath. On  the contrary, I was merely remarking that the trot is a damaging gait,  but through an interrupted--er--articulation--\"    His eye dared her, but she was utterly grave. He perceived that there  was, after all, a certain kinship between this woman of the  mountain-desert and the man thereof. Their silences were filled with  eloquence.    \"We'll try a canter,\" she suggested, \"and I think you'll find that  easier.\"    So she gave the word, and her bay sprang into a lope from a standing  start. The red mare did likewise, nearly flinging the doctor over the  back of the saddle, but by the grace of God he clutched the pommel in  time and was saved. The air caught at his face, they swept out of the  town and onto a limitless level stretch.    \"Sp-p-p-peed,\" gasped the doctor, \"has never been a p-p-passion with  me!\"    He noted that she was not moving in the saddle. The horse was like the  bottom of a wave swinging violently back and forth. She was the calm  crest, swaying slightly and graciously with a motion as smooth as the  flowing of water. And she spoke as evenly as if she were sitting in a  rocking chair.    \"You'll be used to it in a moment,\" she assured him.    He learned, indeed, that if one pressed the stirrups as the shoulders of  the horse swung down and leaned a trifle forward when the shoulders rose  again, the motion ceased to be jarring; for she was truly a matchless  creature and gaited like one of those fabulous horses of old, sired by  the swift western wind. In a little time a certain pride went beating  through the veins of the doctor, the air blew more deeply into his  lungs, there was a different tang to the wind and a different feel to  the sun--a peculiar richness of yellow warmth. And the small head of the  horse and the short, sharp, pricking ears tossed continually; and now  and then the mare threw her head a bit to one side and glanced back at  him with what he felt to be a reassuring air. Life and strength and  speed were gripped between his knees--he flashed a glance at the girl.    But she rode with face straightforward and there was that about her  which made him turn his eyes suddenly away and look far off. It was a  jagged country, for in the brief rainy season there came sudden and  terrific downpours which lashed away the soil and scoured the face of  the underlying rock, and in a single day might cut a deep arroyo where  before had been smooth plain. This was the season of grass, but not the  dark, rank green of rich soil and mild air--it was a yellowish green, a  colour at once tender and glowing. It spread everywhere across the  plains about Elkhead, broken here and there by the projecting boulders  which flashed in the sun. So a great battlefield might appear,  pockmarked with shell-holes, and all the scars of war freshly cut upon  its face. And in truth the mountain desert was like an arena ready to  stage a conflict--a titanic arena with space for earth-giants to  struggle--and there in the distance were the spectator mountains. High,  lean-flanked mountains they were, not clad in forests, but rather  bristling with a stubby growth of the few trees which might endure in  precarious soil and bitter weather, but now they gathered the dignity of  distance about them. The grass of the foothills was a faint green mist  about their feet, cloaks of exquisite blue hung around the upper masses,  but their heads were naked to the pale skies. And all day long, with  deliberate alteration, the garb of the mountains changed. When the  sudden morning came they leaped naked upon the eye, and then withdrew,  muffling themselves in browns and blues until at nightfall they covered  themselves to the eyes in thickly sheeted purple--Tyrian purple--and  prepared for sleep with their heads among the stars.    Something of all this came to Doctor Randall Byrne as he rode, for it  seemed to him that there was a similarity between these mountains and  the girl beside him. She held that keen purity of the upper slopes under  the sun, and though she had no artifice or careful wiles to make her  strange, there was about her a natural dignity like the mystery of  distance. There was a rhythm, too, about that line of peaks against the  sky, and the girl had caught it; he watched her sway with the gallop of  her horse and felt that though she was so close at hand she was a  thousand miles from him. She concealed nothing, and yet he could no more  see her naked soul than he could tear the veils of shadow from the  mountains. Not that the doctor phrased his emotions in words. He was  only conscious of a sense of awe and the necessity of silence.    A strange feeling for the doctor! He came from the region of the mind  where that which is not spoken does not exist, and now this girl was  carrying him swiftly away from hypotheses, doubts, and polysyllabic  speech into the world--of what? The spirit? The doctor did not know. He  only felt that he was about to step into the unknown, and it held for  him the fascination of the suspended action of a statue. Let it not be  thought that he calmly accepted the sheer necessity for silence. He  fought against it, but no words came.    It was evening: the rolling hills about them were already dark; only the  heads of the mountains took the day; and now they paused at the top of a  rise and the girl pointed across the hollow. \"There we are,\" she said.  It was a tall clump of trees through which broke the outlines of a  two-storied house larger than any the doctor had seen in the  mountain-desert; and outside the trees lay long sheds, a great barn, and  a wide-spread wilderness of corrals. It struck the doctor with its  apparently limitless capacity for housing man and beast. Coming in  contrast with the rock-strewn desolation of the plains, this was a great  establishment; the doctor had ridden out with a waif of the desert and  she had turned into a princess at a stroke. Then, for the first time  since they left Elkhead, he remembered with a start that he was to care  for a sick man in that house.    \"You were to tell me,\" he said, \"something about the sickness of your  father--the background behind his condition. But we've both forgotten  about it.\"    \"I have been thinking how I could describe it, every moment of the  ride,\" she answered. Then, as the gloom fell more thickly around them  every moment, she swerved her horse over to the mare, as if it were  necessary that she read the face of the doctor while she spoke.    \"Six months ago,\" she said, \"my father was robust and active in spite of  his age. He was cheerful, busy, and optimistic. But he fell into a  decline. It has not been a sudden sapping of his strength. If it were  that"]]]
