The men were honest, good-natured, respectable, common bushmen farmers.  Too friendly to pay a short call, they came and sat for hours yarning  about nothing in particular. This bored my gentle mother excessively.  She attempted to entertain them with conversation of current literature  and subjects of the day, but her efforts fell flat. She might as well  have spoken in French.    They conversed for hours and hours about dairying, interspersed with  pointless anecdotes of the man who had lived there before us. I found  them very tame.    After graphic descriptions of life on big stations outback, and the  dashing snake yarns told by our kitchen-folk at Bruggabrong, and the  anecdotes of African hunting, travel, and society life which had often  formed our guests' subject of conversation, this endless fiddle-faddle  of the price of farm produce and the state of crops was very fatuous.    Those men, like everyone else, only talked shop. I say nothing in  condemnation of it, but merely point out that it did not then interest  us, as we were not living in that shop just then.    Mrs Melvyn must have found favour in the eyes of the specimens of the  lords of creation resident at Possum Gully, as all the matrons of the  community hastened to call on her, and vied with each other in a display  of friendliness and good-nature. They brought presents of poultry, jam,  butter, and suchlike. They came at two o'clock and stayed till dark.  They inventoried the furniture, gave mother cookery recipes, described  minutely the unsurpassable talents of each of their children, and  descanted volubly upon the best way of setting turkey hens. On taking  their departure they cordially invited us all to return their visits,  and begged mother to allow her children to spend a day with theirs.    We had been resident in our new quarters nearly a month when my parents  received an intimation from the teacher of the public school, two miles  distant, to the effect that the law demanded that they should send their  children to school. It upset my mother greatly. What was she to do?    \"Do! Bundle the nippers off to school as quickly as possible, of  course,\" said my father.    My mother objected. She proposed a governess now and a good  boarding-school later on. She had heard such dreadful stories of public  schools! It was terrible to be compelled to send her darlings to one;  they would be ruined in a week!    \"Not they,\" said father. \"Run them off for a week or two, or a month at  the outside. They can't come to any harm in that time. After that we  will get a governess. You are in no state of health to worry about one  just now, and it is utterly impossible that I can see about the matter  at present. I have several specs. on foot that I must attend to. Send  the youngsters to school down here for the present.\"    We went to school, and in our dainty befrilled pinafores and light shoes  were regarded as great swells by the other scholars. They for the most  part were the children of very poor farmers, whose farm earnings were  augmented by road-work, wood-carting, or any such labour which came  within their grasp. All the boys went barefooted, also a moiety of the  girls. The school was situated on a wild scrubby hill, and the teacher  boarded with a resident a mile from it. He was a man addicted to drink,  and the parents of his scholars lived in daily expectation of seeing his  dismissal from the service.    It is nearly ten years since the twins (who came next to me) and I were  enrolled as pupils of the Tiger Swamp public school. My education was  completed there; so was that of the twins, who are eleven months younger  than I. Also my other brothers and sisters are quickly getting  finishedwards; but that is the only school any of us have seen or known.  There was even a time when father spoke of filling in the free forms for  our attendance there. But mother--a woman's pride bears more wear than a  man's--would never allow us to come to that.    All our neighbours were very friendly; but one in particular, a James  Blackshaw, proved himself most desirous of being comradely with us. He  was a sort of self-constituted sheik of the community. It was usual for  him to take all new-comers under his wing, and with officious  good-nature endeavour to make them feel at home. He called on us daily,  tied his horse to the paling fence beneath the shade of a sallie-tree in  the backyard, and when mother was unable to see him he was content to  yarn for an hour or two with Jane Haizelip, our servant-girl.    Jane disliked Possum Gully as much as I did. Her feeling being much more  defined, it was amusing to hear the flat-out opinions she expressed to  Mr Blackshaw, whom, by the way, she termed \"a mooching hen of a chap\".    \"I suppose, Jane, you like being here near Goulburn, better than that  out-of-the-way place you came from,\" he said one morning as he  comfortably settled himself on an old sofa in the kitchen.    \"No jolly fear. Out-of-the-way place! There was more life at Bruggabrong  in a day than you crawlers 'ud see here all yer lives,\" she retorted  with vigour, energetically pommelling a batch of bread which she was  mixing.    \"Why, at Brugga it was as good as a show every week. On Saturday evening  all the coves used to come in for their mail. They'd stay till Sunday  evenin'. Splitters, boundary-riders, dogtrappers--every manjack of 'em.  Some of us wuz always good fer a toon on the concertina, and the rest  would dance. We had fun to no end. A girl could have a fly round and a  lark or two there I tell you; but here,\" and she emitted a snort of  contempt, \"there ain't one bloomin' feller to do a mash with. I'm full  of the place. Only I promised to stick to the missus a while, I'd scoot  tomorrer. It's the dead-and-alivest hole I ever seen.\"    \"You'll git used to it by and by,\" said Blackshaw.    \"Used to it! A person 'ud hev to be brought up onder a hen to git used  to the dullness of this hole.\"    \"You wasn't brought up under a hen, or it must have been a big Bramer  Pooter, if you were,\" replied he, noting the liberal proportions of her  figure as she hauled a couple of heavy pots off the fire. He did not  offer to help her. Etiquette of that sort was beyond his ken.    \"You oughter go out more and then you wouldn't find it so dull,\" he  said, after she had placed the pots on the floor.    \"Go out! Where 'ud I go to, pray?\"    \"Drop in an' see my missus again when you git time. You're always  welcome.\"    \"Thanks, but I had plenty of goin' to see your missus last time.\"    \"How's that?\"    \"Why, I wasn't there harf an hour wen she had to strip off her clean  duds an' go an' milk. I don't think much of any of the men around here.  They let the women work too hard. I never see such a tired wore-out set  of women. It puts me in mind ev the time wen the black fellers made the  gins do all the work. Why, on Bruggabrong the women never had to do no  outside work, only on a great pinch wen all the men were away at a fire  or a muster. Down here they do everything. They do all the milkin', and  pig-feedin', and poddy-rarin'. It makes me feel fit to retch. I don't  know whether it's because the men is crawlers or whether it's dairyin'.  I don't think much of dairyin'. It's slavin', an' delvin', an' scrapin'  yer eyeballs out from mornin' to night, and nothink to show for your  pains; and now you'll oblige me, Mr Blackshaw, if youll lollop somewhere  else for a minute or two. I want to sweep under that sofer.\"    This had the effect of making him depart. He said good morning and went  off, not sure whether he was most amused or insulted.          CHAPTER FOUR    A Career Which Soon Careered To An End      While mother, Jane Haizelip, and I found the days long and life slow,  father was enjoying himself immensely.    He had embarked upon a lively career--that gambling trade known as  dealing in stock.    When he was not away in Riverina inspecting a flock of sheep, he was  attending the Homebush Fat Stock Sales, rushing away out to Bourke, or  tearing off down the Shoalhaven to buy some dairy heifers.    He was a familiar figure at the Goulburn sale-yards every Wednesday,  always going into town the day before and not returning till a day, and  often two days, afterwards.    He was in great demand among drovers and auctioneers; and in the stock  news his name was always mentioned in connection with all the principal  sales in the colony.    It takes an astute, clear-headed man to keep himself off shore in stock  dealing. I never yet heard of a dealer who occasionally did not  temporarily, if not totally, go to the wall.    He need not necessarily be downright unscrupulous, but if he wishes to  profit he must not be overburdened with niceties in the point of honour.  That is where Richard Melvyn fell through. He was crippled with too many  Utopian ideas of honesty, and was too soft ever to come off anything but  second-best in a deal. He might as well have attempted to make his  fortune by scraping a fiddle up and down Auburn Street, Goulburn. His  dealing career was short and merry. His vanity to be considered a  socialistic fellow, who was as ready to take a glass with a swaggie as a  swell, and the lavish shouting which this principle incurred, made great  inroads on his means. Losing money every time he sold a beast, wasting  stamps galore on letters to endless auctioneers, frequently remaining in  town half a week at a stretch, and being hail-fellow to all the spongers  to be found on the trail of such as he, quickly left him on the verge of  bankruptcy. Some of his contemporaries say it was grog that did it all.    Had he kept clear-headed he was a smart fellow, and gave promise of  doing well, but his head would not stand alcohol, and by it he was  undermined in no time.

But you  who contend that you are born with an inclination to such food, why  object to kill what you would eat? do it, however, with your own hands,  and without the aid of a knife; tear your victim to pieces with your  fingers, as lions do with their claws, and after worrying a hare or a  lamb, fall on and eat alive as they do; drink up the flowing blood, and  devour the flesh while it is yet warm! Is not the very idea horrible? we  know we could not do it; as it is, the sight of uncooked flesh with all  its raw horror excites loathing and disgust, and it is only by culinary  preparation, it can be softened and rendered somewhat more susceptible  of mastication and digestion; it must be completely transformed by  roasting, boiling, &c., and afterwards so disguised by salts, spices,  and various sauces, that the natural taste is gone, the palate is  deceived into the admission of such uncouth fare, and finds a flavour in  the taste of these cadaverous morsels.    May we be allowed to take for granted, that health may be preserved  through the same means by which it is recovered? If so, animal food is  clearly an impediment to a healthy state of body, for health is restored  by a simple and fleshless diet, and therefore may be preserved by the  same regimen. That animal food is highly stimulant there can be no  doubt; but like all other stimulants, it produces weakness eventually,  for when excitement has been brought to its acme, debility must of  necessity succeed.    The grand objection to an animal diet, is its detrimental effect upon  the mind: it is well known that flesh-eating makes the body strong and  lusty, (and it is for that reason recommended to pugilists who are in a  course of training,) but the mind becomes weak and inactive; for it must  needs happen, where a muddy and clogged body is shackled down by heavy  and unnatural nourishment, that all the vigour and brilliancy of the  understanding must be confused and made dull, and that, wanting  clearness for nobler things, it must ramble after little and unworthy  objects. The passions cannot fail to be excited, and thus the whole of  the irrational nature becoming fattened as it were, the soul is drawn  downward and abandons its proper love of true being. The truth of this  we must all more or less have experienced: we are never so lively when  we have dined, and the studious man knows well that the morning is the  more proper time for his employment.    Why then should we not liberate ourselves from such inconvenience, by  abandoning as far as we can a fleshy diet? and let us remember, that  even on the score of comfort, the pain of indigence is much milder than  that which is produced by repletion. We should thus free ourselves at  once from a heavy and somnolent condition of body, from many and  vehement diseases, from the want of medical assistance, from \"the  crassitude of the corporeal bond,\" and above all, from that savage and  unnatural strength which incites to base actions, so as to escape an  Iliad of evils!    F.           *       *       *       *       *      MY FATHERLAND.    FROM THE GERMAN OF KORNER.        Where is the minstrel's Fatherland?      'Tis where the spirit warmest glows,      Where laurels bloom for noblest brows,      Where warlike hearts the truest vows        Swear, lit by friendship's holy brand;        There was once my Fatherland.      What calls the minstrel, Fatherland?      That land, which weeps beneath the yoke      Its slaughter'd sons, and foeman's stroke:      Land of the stern, unbending oak.        Land of the free, the German land,        That once I call'd my Fatherland.      Why weeps the minstrel's Fatherland?      It weeps before a tyrant's dread,      The valour of its monarch's fled;      At Deutchland's voice a people dead,        Despised, unheeded its command.        This, this weeps, my Fatherland.      Whom calls the minstrel's Fatherland?      It calls on spirits pale with wonder,      In desperation's words of thunder,      To rise and burst its chain asunder.        On retribution's vengeful hand,        On this calls my Fatherland.      What would the minstrel's Fatherland?      To blot out slav'ry's foul disgrace,      The bloodhound from its realms to chase,      And free to bear a freeborn race:        Or bid them free beneath its sand,        This, this would my Fatherland.      And hopes the minstrel's Fatherland?      Yes, that for God and Deutchland's sake,      Its own true people will awake,      And outrag'd heaven, vengeance take;        That he,[3] whose prowess has been scann'd,        Will save the minstrel's Fatherland.

(_From Chit-chat, in the Magazine of Natural History, by Dovaston and  Von Osdat._)      _Dov._ Ray tells a humourous story, that, after the patiently exploring  commissioners, at the end of their long examinations, deliberately  confessed their utter ignorance to account for the Goodwin Sands, an old  man gravely asserted Tenterden steeple to be the cause.    _Von Os._ Tenterden steeple!    _Dov._ Ay; Tenterden steeple: for that those sands first appeared the  year it was erected.    _Von Os._ And the slightest interview with the mass of mankind, any  hour, will prove the race of Tenterden philosophers to be far from  extinct.    _Dov._ Particularly with regard to facts relative to natural history:  and this is the more lamentable, and perhaps the more surprising, when  we consider its unlimited adaptability to all capacities, ages, sexes,  and ranks; and, moreover, the absolute necessity of many parts of it to  their intellectual existence.    _Von Os._ There is in our village, a slater, very fond of keeping bees.  These useful insects, he says, at breeding-time sweat prodigiously; and  each lays four eggs at the bottom of each cell: soon after which, he has  observed the combs to become full of maggots, which must be carefully  destroyed by smoke! When any one of his numerous family is buried, as  the corpse passes out of the house, he carefully loosens every hive, and  lifts it up; otherwise, he says, the bees would all die!    _Dov._ The superstitions about bees are numberless.    _Von Os._ And yet this poor fellow believes himself inspired with \"grace  abounding;\" and readily undertakes to \"_spound_,\" as he calls it, any  verse read to him, however remotely insulated from the context.    _Dov._ But what would you think of a gentleman I have the pleasure of  visiting in the higher ranks, and whose conversation is really a  happiness to me, who talks of little young bees?--and really believes  that they grow! He smiled at me compassionately when I told him that  insects never grew when in the perfect state; but, like Minerva from the  brain of Jove, issue full-armed with sharpest weapons, and corslets of  burnished green, purple, and gold, in panoply complete: yet is this  gentleman a man of genius, wit, and very extensive knowledge.    _Von Os._ Not in bees.    _Dov._ He was not aware of the numerous species of British bees; and  that several, of a small intrepid sort, will enter the hives, and prey  on the treasures of their more industrious congeners.    _Von Os._ Reasoning from analogy does not do in natural history.    _Dov._ No; for who, without observation, or the information of others,  ever by analogical reasoning could reconcile the enormous difference of  size and colour, in the sexes of some of the humble bees?--or ever  discover that in some species there are even females of two sizes?    _Von Os._ But these never grow.    _Dov._ Certainly not. Bees, however, hatched in very old cells, will be  somewhat smaller: as each maggot leaves a skin behind which, though  thinner than the finest silk, layer after layer, contracts the cells,  and somewhat compresses the future bee.    _Von Os._ No ignorance is so contemptible as that of what is hourly  before our eyes. I do not so much wonder at the fellow who inquired if  America was a very large town, as at him who, finding the froth of the  Cicada spumaria L. on almost every blade in his garden, wondered where  were all the cuckoos that produced it.    _Dov._ They call it cuckoo-spit, from its plentiful appearance about the  arrival of that bird.    _Von Os._ That is reasoning from analogy.    _Dov._ And yet I see not why the bird should be given to spitting;  unless, indeed, he came from America.    _Von Os._ The vulgar, too, not only delight in wonders inexplicable, but  have a rabid propensity to pry into futurity.    _Dov._ I believe that propensity is far from being confined to the  vulgar.    _Von Os._ True; but not in so ridiculous a way: as they prophesy the  future price of wheat from the number of lenticular knobs (containing  the sporules) in the bottom of a cup of the fungus Nidularia.    _Dov._ The weather may be foretold with considerable certainty, for a  short time, from many hygrometric plants, and the atmospheric influence  on animals.    _Von Os._ And from _Cloudology_, by the changing of primary clouds into  compound; and these resolving themselves into nimbi, for rain; or  gathering into cumuli, for fair weather. This is like to become a very  useful and pleasing science.    _Dov._ It is wonders of this kind, and forewarnings of this nature, that  natural history offers to the contemplative mind: in the place of  superstitious follies, and unavailing predictions, such as the  foretelling of luck from the number or chattering of magpies; and the  wonder how red clover changes itself into grass, as many a farmer at  this moment believes.    _Von Os._ Linnaeus himself was a bit of a prophet; as, indeed, thus well  he might; for experience and observation amount almost to the power of  vatacination. In his _Academic Aménities_ he says, \"Deus, O.M. et Natura  nihil frustra"]]]
