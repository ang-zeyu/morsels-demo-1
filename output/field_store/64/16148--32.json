Towards the end of the fifth century Huns of various kinds  returned to the lower Danube and devastated the peninsula several times,  penetrating as far as Epirus and Thessaly.        3    _The Arrival of the Slavs in the Balkan Peninsula_, A.D. 500-650      The Balkan peninsula, which had been raised to a high level of security  and prosperity during the Roman dominion, gradually relapsed into  barbarism as a result of these endless invasions; the walled towns, such  as Salonika and Constantinople, were the only safe places, and the country  became waste and desolate. The process continued unabated throughout the  three following centuries, and one is driven to one of two conclusions,  either that these lands must have possessed very extraordinary powers of  recuperation to make it worth while for invaders to pillage them so  frequently, or, what is more probable, there can have been after some time  little left to plunder, and consequently the Byzantine historians'  accounts of enormous drives of prisoners and booty are much exaggerated.  It is impossible to count the number of times the tide of invasion and  devastation swept southwards over the unfortunate peninsula. The emperors  and their generals did what they could by means of defensive works on the  frontiers, of punitive expeditions, and of trying to set the various  hordes of barbarians at loggerheads with each other, but, as they had at  the same time to defend an empire which stretched from Armenia to Spain,  it is not surprising that they were not more successful. The growing  riches of Constantinople and Salonika had an irresistible attraction for  the wild men from the east and north, and unfortunately the Greek citizens  were more inclined to spend their energy in theological disputes and their  leisure in the circus than to devote either the one or the other to the  defence of their country. It was only by dint of paying them huge sums of  money that the invaders were kept away from the coast. The departure of  the Huns and the Goths had made the way for fresh series of unwelcome  visitors. In the sixth century the Slavs appear for the first time. From  their original homes which were immediately north of the Carpathians, in  Galicia and Poland, but may also have included parts of the modern  Hungary, they moved southwards and south-eastwards. They were presumably  in Dacia, north of the Danube, in the previous century, but they are first  mentioned as having crossed that river during the reign of the Emperor  Justin I (518-27). They were a loosely-knit congeries of tribes without  any single leader or central authority; some say they merely possessed the  instinct of anarchy, others that they were permeated with the ideals of  democracy. What is certain is that amongst them neither leadership nor  initiative was developed, and that they lacked both cohesion and  organisation. The Eastern Slavs, the ancestors of the Russians, were only  welded into anything approaching unity by the comparatively much smaller  number of Scandinavian (Varangian) adventurers who came and took charge of  their affairs at Kiev. Similarly the Southern Slavs were never of  themselves able to form a united community, conscious of its aim and  capable of persevering in its attainment.    The Slavs did not invade the Balkan peninsula alone but in the company of  the Avars, a terrible and justly dreaded nation, who, like the Huns, were  of Asiatic (Turkish or Mongol) origin. These invasions became more  frequent during the reign of the Emperor Justinian I (527-65), and  culminated in 559 in a great combined attack of all the invaders on  Constantinople under a certain Zabergan, which was brilliantly defeated by  the veteran Byzantine general Belisarius. The Avars were a nomad tribe,  and the horse was their natural means of locomotion. The Slavs, on the  other hand, moved about on foot, and seem to have been used as infantry by  the more masterful Asiatics in their warlike expeditions. Generally  speaking, the Avars, who must have been infinitely less numerous than the  Slavs, were settled in Hungary, where Attila and the Huns had been settled  a little more than a century previously; that is to say, they were north  of the Danube, though they were always overrunning into Upper Moesia, the  modern Serbia. The Slavs, whose numbers were without doubt very large,  gradually settled all over the country south of the Danube, the rural  parts of which, as a result of incessant invasion and retreat, had become  waste and empty. During the second half of the sixth century all the  military energies of Constantinople were diverted to Persia, so that the  invaders of the Balkan peninsula had the field very much to themselves. It  was during this time that the power of the Avars reached its height. They  were masters of all the country up to the walls of Adrianople and  Salonika, though they did not settle there. The peninsula seems to have  been colonized by Slavs, who penetrated right down into Greece; but the  Avars were throughout this time, both in politics and in war, the  directing and dominating force. During another Persian war, which broke  out in 622 and entailed the prolonged absence of the emperor from  Constantinople, the Avars, not satisfied with the tribute extorted from  the Greeks, made an alliance against them with the Persians, and in 626  collected a large army of Slavs and Asiatics and attacked Constantinople  both by land and sea from the European side, while the Persians threatened  it from Asia. But the walls of the city and the ships of the Greeks proved  invincible, and, quarrels breaking out between the Slavs and the Avars,  both had to save themselves in ignominious and precipitate retreat.    After this nothing more was heard of the Avars in the Balkan peninsula,  though their power was only finally crushed by Charlemagne in 799. In  Russia their downfall became proverbial, being crystallized in the saying,  'they perished like Avars'. The Slavs, on the other hand, remained.  Throughout these stormy times their penetration of the Balkan peninsula  had been peacefully if unostentatiously proceeding; by the middle of the  seventh century it was complete. The main streams of Slavonic immigration  moved southwards and westwards. The first covered the whole of the country  between the Danube and the Balkan range, overflowed into Macedonia, and  filtered down into Greece. Southern Thrace in the east and Albania in the  west were comparatively little affected, and in these districts the  indigenous population maintained itself. The coasts of the Aegean and the  great cities on or near them were too strongly held by the Greeks to be  affected, and those Slavs who penetrated into Greece itself were soon  absorbed by the local populations. The still stronger Slavonic stream,  which moved westwards and turned up north-westwards, overran the whole  country down to the shores of the Adriatic and as far as the sources of  the Save and Drave in the Alps. From that point in the west to the shores  of the Black Sea in the east became one solid mass of Slavs,  and has remained so ever since. The few Slavs who were left north of the  Danube in Dacia were gradually assimilated by the inhabitants of that  province, who were the descendants of the Roman soldiers and colonists,  and the ancestors of the modern Rumanians, but the fact that Slavonic  influence there was strong is shown by the large number of words of  Slavonic origin contained in the Rumanian language.    [Illustration: THE BALKAN PENINSULA ETHNOLOGICAL]    Place-names are a good index of the extent and strength of the tide of  Slav immigration. All along the coast, from the mouth of the Danube to the  head of the Adriatic, the Greek and Roman names have been retained though  places have often been given alternative names by the Slavonic settlers.  Thrace, especially the south-eastern part, and Albania have the fewest  Slavonic place-names. In Macedonia and Lower Moesia (Bulgaria) very few  classical names have survived, while in Upper Moesia (Serbia) and the  interior of Dalmatia (Bosnia, Hercegovina, and Montenegro) they have  entirely disappeared. The Slavs themselves, though their tribal names were  known, were until the ninth century usually called collectively S(k)lavini  ([Greek: Sklabaenoi]) by the Greeks, and all the inland parts of the  peninsula were for long termed by them 'the S(k)lavonias' ([Greek:  Sklabiniai]).    During the seventh century, dating from the defeat of the Slavs and Avars  before the walls of Constantinople in 626 and the final triumph of the  emperor over the Persians in 628, the influence and power of the Greeks  began to reassert itself throughout the peninsula as far north as the  Danube; this process was coincident with the decline of the might of the  Avars. It was the custom of the astute Byzantine diplomacy to look on and  speak of lands which had been occupied by the various barbarian invaders  as grants made to them through the generosity of the emperor; by this  means, by dint also of lavishing titles and substantial incomes to the  invaders' chiefs, by making the most of their mutual jealousies, and also  by enlisting regiments of Slavonic mercenaries in the imperial armies, the  supremacy of Constantinople was regained far more effectively than it  could have been by the continual and exhausting use of force.

From her earliest childhood Hinpoha had dreaded the very name of Aunt  Phoebe. When she came to visit a restraint fell over the whole house.  The usual lively chatter at the dinner table was hushed, and Aunt Phoebe  held forth in solemn tones, generally berating some unfortunate person  who nearly always happened to be a good friend of Mrs. Bradford's.  Hinpoha would be called up for a minute examination of her clothes and  manners and would invariably do something which was not right in her  great aunt's eyes.    She had a vivid recollection of going tobogganing down the long front  walk one winter day, her jolly mother on the sled with her, steering it  adroitly around the corner and up the sidewalk for a distance after  leaving the slope. Such fun they were having that they did not look to  see if the road was clear, and went bumping into a female figure that  was coming majestically along the street, knocking her off her feet and  into a snowdrift. It was Aunt Phoebe, coming to make a formal afternoon  call. She sat bolt upright in the snow and adjusted her lorgnette to see  if by any chance her grandniece could be one of those rowdy children.  When she discovered that it was not only Hinpoha, but her mother as  well, frolicking so indecorously, she was speechless. Mrs. Bradford  started to make an abject apology, but the sight of Aunt Phoebe sitting  in the snowdrift with her lorgnette was too much for her and she went  off into a peal of laughter, in which Hinpoha joined gleefully. It was  weeks before Aunt Phoebe could be coaxed to make another visit. And this  was the woman who was coming to take the place of Hinpoha's beloved  mother!    Aunt Grace left the day she came. There was not enough room in one house  for her and Aunt Phoebe. With Aunt Phoebe came \"Silky,\" a wiggling,  snapping Skye terrier. He gave one glance at genial Mr. Bob, who was  rolling on his back before the fireplace, and with a growl fastened his  teeth into his neck. Hinpoha rescued her pet and bore him away to her  room, where she shed tears of despair while he licked her hand  sympathetically. Aunt Phoebe's first act was to put Hinpoha into deep  mourning. Hinpoha objected strenuously, but there was no help, and she  went to school swathed from head to foot in black. Nyoda was wrathful at  the sight, for if there was one point she felt strongly about it was  putting children into mourning. Among the gaily dressed girls Hinpoha  stood out like some dark spirit from the underworld, casting a gloom  wherever she went.    \"Where is that beautiful vase I brought your mother from the World's  Fair?\" asked Aunt Phoebe one day, suddenly missing it.    \"It was accidently broken at our last Camp Fire meeting,\" answered  Hinpoha, with a tightening around her heart when she thought of that  last happy gathering.    \"Camp Fire!\" said Aunt Phoebe with a snort. \"You don't mean to tell me  that you are mixed up in any such foolishness as that?\"    \"I certainly am,\" said Hinpoha energetically, \"and it isn't foolishness,  either. I've learned more since I have been a Camp Fire Girl than I did  in all the years before.\"    \"Well, you may consider yourself graduated, then,\" said Aunt Phoebe,  drily, \"for I'll have no such nonsense about me. I can teach you all you  need to know outside of what you learn in school.\"    \"Camp Fire always had mother's fullest approval,\" said Hinpoha darkly.    \"I dare say,\" returned her aunt. \"But I want you to understand once for  all that I won't have any girls holding 'meetings' here, to upset the  house and break valuable ornaments.\"    \"But you don't care if I go to them at other girls' houses, do you?\"  asked Hinpoha, the fear gripping her that she was to be denied the  consolation of these weekly gatherings with the Winnebagos.    \"I don't want you to have anything to do with that Camp Fire business,\"  said Aunt Phoebe in a tone of finality, and Hinpoha left the room, her  heart swelling with bitterness. She was too wise to argue the point with  Aunt Phoebe, and resolved to depend on Nyoda to show her the way. She  dried her tears and went down to the living room and began to play  softly on the piano. It had been her mother's piano, the wedding gift of  her father, and it seemed that her mother's spirit hovered over it. It  was the first time she had touched the keys since that awful Wednesday  when the world had been turned into chaos; she had had no heart to play,  but to-day the sound of the music comforted her and her bitter resentment  against her aunt lost some of its sting. She played on, lost in  memories, when suddenly the sharp voice of her aunt brought her back to  earth. \"What does this mean?\" cried Aunt Phoebe, \"playing on the piano  when your father and mother have just died! I never heard of such a  thing! Come away immediately and don't open that piano again until our  period of mourning is over.\" She closed the piano and locked it, putting  the key into her bag.    Under Aunt Phoebe's management the house soon lost its look of inviting  friendliness. The blinds were always kept drawn, so that even on the  brightest days the rooms had a gloomy appearance. No more cheerful wood  fires crackled and glowed in the grate. They made ashes on the rugs and  were extravagant, as the house was heated by steam. The bookcases were  locked and Hinpoha was forbidden to read fiction, as this was not proper  when one was in mourning. \"You will become acquainted with much pleasant  literature reading to me while I crochet,\" she said when Hinpoha rose in  revolt at this edict. The \"pleasant literature\" which Aunt Phoebe was  just then perusing was a History of the Presbyterian Church in eleven  volumes, which bored Hinpoha so it nearly gagged her.    Besides, Aunt Phoebe constantly found fault with Hinpoha's manner of  reading. It was either too loud or not loud enough; either too fast or  too slow, but it was never right. That reading aloud was the last straw  to Hinpoha. After sitting still a whole afternoon getting her school  lessons, she longed to move about after supper, but then Aunt Phoebe  expected her to sit still the entire evening and entertain her with the  activities of the Early Presbytery. After nearly a week of this deadly  dullness Hinpoha was ready to fly. And yet Aunt Phoebe was not conscious  that there was anything wrong in the way she was treating Hinpoha. She  cared for her in her frozen way. She was merely trying to bring her up  in the way she herself had been brought up by a maiden aunt, not taking  into account that this was another day and age. In her time it was  considered the proper thing to shut down on all lightheartedness after a  death in the family, and she was adhering steadfastly to the old  principles. She was yet to learn that she could not force obsolete  customs upon a girl who had lived for sixteen years in the sunlight of  modern ideas.    All Hinpoha's troubles were confided to Nyoda, who sympathized with her  entirely, but bade her be of good cheer and hope for the time when Aunt  Phoebe would see for herself that the new way was best; and above all to  win the respect and liking of her aunt the first thing, as more could be  accomplished in this way than by being antagonistic. \"I don't suppose  you could go for a long walk with me Sunday afternoon?\" said Nyoda.    Hinpoha shook her head sadly. \"We don't do anything like that on  Sunday,\" she answered, with resentment flaming in her eye. \"We go to  church morning and evening and in the afternoon I am supposed to read  the Bible or a book by a man named Thomas a Kempis.\" Nyoda turned her  eyes inward with such a comical expression that Hinpoha forgot her  troubles for a moment and laughed.    \"The Bible and Thomas a Kempis,\" said Nyoda musingly; \"where did I hear  those two mentioned before? Oh, I have it! Did you ever read this  anywhere, 'Commit to memory one hundred verses of the Bible or an equal  amount of sacred literature, such as Thomas a Kempis'?\"    Hinpoha hung her head, still smiling. \"Why, Nyoda,\" she said, \"there's a  chance to earn an honor bead that I probably wouldn't have thought of  otherwise!\"    \"Right-o,\" said Nyoda. \"'It's an ill wind,' you know. And while you are  doing so much Bible reading you will undoubtedly come across something  about 'in the wilderness a cedar,' and will learn that most waste places  can be turned into blooming gardens if we only know how.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Hinpoha, \"I always feel less forlorn after a talk with  you.\" Her face brightened, but immediately fell again. \"But what good  will it do me to work for honors?\" she said sadly. \"Aunt Phoebe won't  let me come to the meetings.\"    \"Won't she really?\" asked Nyoda in surprise. Hinpoha nodded, near to  tears. \"I must see about that,\" said Nyoda resolutely. \"I think if I  explain the mission and activities of Camp Fire she will not object to  your belonging. She probably has a wrong idea of what it means.\"    Accordingly Nyoda came a-calling on Aunt Phoebe that very night. In  addition to being very pretty Nyoda had a great deal of dignity, and  when she put on her formal manner she looked very impressive indeed. She  did not act as if she had come to see Hinpoha at all, but asked for  \"Miss Bradford,\" and said she had come to pay her respects to her new  neighbor. She listened politely to Aunt Phoebe's account of her last  siege of rheumatism, admired her crochet work, and hoped she liked this  street as well as her former neighborhood. She said she had often seen  Miss Bradford's name in the papers in connection with various charitable  organizations and was very glad to have the honor of meeting the sister  of the prominent Judge. Aunt Phoebe was pleased and flattered at the  deference paid her. But when Nyoda announced herself as the leader of  the club to which Hinpoha belonged and asked permission for her to  attend the meetings, she refused. She was perfectly polite about it, and  did not mention her"]]]
