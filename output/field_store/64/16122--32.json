Let  us imagine that each point has noted upon it the three numbers that  give its position, then we have something comparable with a measure  with numbered subdivisions; only we now have to do, one might say,  with a good many imaginary measures in three common perpendicular  directions. In this \"system of co-ordinates\" the numbers that fix  the position of one or the other of the bodies may now be read off  at any moment.    This is the means which the astronomers and their mathematical  assistants have always used in dealing with the movement of the  heavenly bodies. At a determined moment the position of each body  is fixed by its three co-ordinates. If these are given, then one  knows also the common distances, as well as the angles formed by the  connecting lines, and the movement of a planet is to be known as soon  as one knows how its co-ordinates are changing from one moment to  the other. Thus the picture that one forms of the phenomena stands  there as if it were sketched on the canvas of the motionless ether.        EINSTEIN'S DEPARTURE    Since Einstein has cut loose from the ether, he lacks this canvas, and  therewith, at the first glance, also loses the possibility of fixing  the positions of the heavenly bodies and mathematically describing  their movement--i.e., by giving comparisons that define the positions  at every moment. How Einstein has overcome this difficulty may be  somewhat elucidated through a simple illustration.    On the surface of the earth the attraction of gravitation causes  all bodies to fall along vertical lines, and, indeed, when one omits  the resistance of the air, with an equally accelerated movement; the  velocity increases in equal degrees in equal consecutive divisions of  time at a rate that in this country gives the velocity attained at  the end of a second as 981 centimeters (32.2 feet) per second. The  number 981 defines the \"acceleration in the field of gravitation,\"  and this field is fully characterized by that single number; with its  help we can also calculate the movement of an object hurled out in an  arbitrary direction. In order to measure the acceleration we let the  body drop alongside of a vertical measure set solidly on the ground;  on this scale we read at every moment the figure that indicates the  height, the only co-ordinate that is of importance in this rectilinear  movement. Now we ask what would we be able to see if the measure were  not bound solidly to the earth, if it, let us suppose, moved down or  up with the place where it is located and where we are ourselves. If  in this case the speed were constant, then, and this is in accord with  the special theory of relativity, there would be no motion observed at  all; we should again find an acceleration of 981 for a falling body. It  would be different if the measure moved with changeable velocity.    If it went down with a constant acceleration of 981 itself, then an  object could remain permanently at the same point on the measure,  or could move up or down itself alongside of it, with constant  speed. The relative movement of the body with regard to the measure  should be without acceleration, and if we had to judge only by what  we observed in the spot where we were and which was falling itself,  then we should get the impression that there was no gravitation at  all. If the measure goes down with an acceleration equal to a half  or a third of what it just was, then the relative motion of the body  will, of course, be accelerated, but we should find the increase  in velocity per second one-half or two-thirds of 981. If, finally,  we let the measure rise with a uniformly accelerated movement, then  we shall find a greater acceleration than 981 for the body itself.    Thus we see that we, also when the measure is not attached to the  earth, disregarding its displacement, may describe the motion of the  body in respect to the measure always in the same way--i.e., as one  uniformly accelerated, as we ascribe now and again a fixed value to  the acceleration of the sphere of gravitation, in a particular case  the value of zero.    Of course, in the case here under consideration the use of a measure  fixed immovably upon the earth should merit all recommendation. But  in the spaces of the solar system we have, now that we have abandoned  the ether, no such support. We can no longer establish a system of  co-ordinates, like the one just mentioned, in a universal intermediate  matter, and if we were to arrive in one way or another at a definite  system of lines crossing each other in three directions, then we should  be able to use just as well another similar system that in respect to  the first moves this or that way. We should also be able to remodel the  system of co-ordinates in all kinds of ways, for example by extension  or compression. That in all these cases for fixed bodies that do not  participate in the movement or the remodelling of the system other  co-ordinates will be read off again and again is clear.        NEW SYSTEM OR CO-ORDINATES    What way Einstein had to follow is now apparent. He must--this  hardly needs to be said--in calculating definite, particular cases  make use of a chosen system of co-ordinates, but as he had no means  of limiting his choice beforehand and in general, he had to reserve  full liberty of action in this respect. Therefore he made it his aim  so to arrange the theory that, no matter how the choice was made, the  phenomena of gravitation, so far as its effects and its stimulation  by the attracting bodies are concerned, may always be described in  the same way--i.e., through comparisons of the same general form,  as we again and again give certain values to the numbers that mark  the sphere of gravitation. (For the sake of simplification I here  disregard the fact that Einstein desires that also the way in which  time is measured and represented by figures shall have no influence  upon the central value of the comparisons.)    Whether this aim could be attained was a question of mathematical  inquiry. It really was attained, remarkably enough, and, we may say, to  the surprise of Einstein himself, although at the cost of considerable  simplicity in the mathematical form; it appeared necessary for the  fixation of the field of gravitation in one or the other point in  space to introduce no fewer than ten quantities in the place of the  one that occurred in the example mentioned above.    In this connection it is of importance to note that when we exclude  certain possibilities that would give rise to still greater intricacy,  the form of comparison used by Einstein to present the theory is  the only possible one; the principle of the freedom of choice in  co-ordinates was the only one by which he needed to allow himself to  be guided. Although thus there was no special effort made to reach a  connection with the theory of Newton, it was evident, fortunately,  at the end of the experiment that the connection existed. If we  avail ourselves of the simplifying circumstance that the velocities  of the heavenly bodies are slight in comparison with that of light,  then we can deduce the theory of Newton from the new theory, the  \"universal\" relativity theory, as it is called by Einstein. Thus  all the conclusions based upon the Newtonian theory hold good, as  must naturally be required. But now we have got further along. The  Newtonian theory can no longer be regarded as absolutely correct in all  cases; there are slight deviations from it, which, although as a rule  unnoticeable, once in a while fall within the range of observation.    Now, there was a difficulty in the movement of the planet Mercury  which could not be solved. Even after all the disturbances caused by  the attraction of other planets had been taken into account, there  remained an inexplicable phenomenon--i.e., an extremely slow turning  of the ellipsis described by Mercury on its own plane; Leverrier had  found that it amounted to forty-three seconds a century. Einstein  found that, according to his formulas, this movement must really  amount to just that much. Thus with a single blow he solved one of  the greatest puzzles of astronomy.    Still more remarkable, because it has a bearing upon a phenomenon which  formerly could not be imagined, is the confirmation of Einstein's  prediction regarding the influence of gravitation upon the course  of the rays of light. That such an influence must exist is taught  by a simple examination; we have only to turn back for a moment to  the following comparison in which we were just imagining ourselves  to make our observations. It was noted that when the compartment is  falling with the acceleration of 981 the phenomena therein will occur  just as if there were no attraction of gravitation. We can then see  an object, A, stand still somewhere in open space. A projectile,  B, can travel with constant speed along a horizontal line, without  varying from it in the slightest.    A ray of light can do the same; everybody will admit that in each case,  if there is no gravitation, light will certainly extend itself in a  rectilinear way. If we limit the light to a flicker of the slightest  duration, so that only a little bit, C, of a ray of light arises,  or if we fix our attention upon a single vibration of light, C, while  we on the other hand give to the projectile, B, a speed equal to that  of light, then we can conclude that B and C in their continued motion  can always remain next to each other. Now if we watch all this, not  from the movable compartment, but from a place on the earth, then we  shall note the usual falling movement of object A, which shows us that  we have to deal with a sphere of gravitation. The projectile B will,  in a bent path, vary more and more from a horizontal straight line,  and the light will do the same, because if we observe the movements  from another standpoint this can have no effect upon the remaining  next"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11340"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

Here they assemble to dance and regale  in the best manner their circumstances and the place will afford; each  man treats his sweetheart with a ribbon or favour. The lord and lady  attended by the steward, sword, purse, and mace-bearer, with their  several badges of office, honour the hall with their presence; they  have likewise, in their suit, a page, or train-bearer, and a jester,  dressed in a parti-coloured jacket. The lord's music, consisting of a  tabor and pipe, is employed to conduct the dance. Companies of  morrice-dancers, attended by the jester and tabor and pipe, go about  the country on Monday and Tuesday in Whitsun week, and collect sums  towards defraying the expenses of the Yule. All the figures of the  lord, &c. of the Yule, handsomely represented in basso-relievo, stand  in the north wall of the nave of Cirencester Church, which vouches for  the antiquity of the custom; and, on many of these occasions, they  erect a may-pole, which denotes its rise in Druidism. The mace is made  of silk, finely plaited with ribbons on the top, and filled with  spices and perfumes for such of the company to smell to as desire it.    Halbert H.           *       *       *       *       *      ANCIENT FUNERAL RITES AMONG THE GREEKS.    (_For the Mirror_.)      The dead were ever held sacred and inviolable even amongst the most  barbarous nations; to defraud them of any due respect was a greater  and more unpardonable sacrilege than to spoil the temples of the gods;  their memories were preserved with a religious care and reverence, and  all their remains honoured with worship and adoration; hatred and envy  themselves were put to silence, for it was thought a sign of a cruel  and inhuman disposition to speak evil of the dead, and prosecute  revenge beyond the grave. The ancient Greeks were strongly persuaded  that their souls could not be admitted into the Elysian fields till  their bodies were committed to the earth; therefore the honours (says  Potter) paid to the dead were the greatest and most necessary; for  these were looked upon as a debt so sacred, that such as neglected to  discharge it were thought accursed. Those who died in foreign  countries had usually their ashes brought home and interred in the  sepulchres of their ancestors, or at least in some part of their  native country; it being thought that the same mother which gave them  life and birth, was only fit to receive their remains, and afford them  a peaceful habitation after death. Whence ancient authors afford as  innumerable instances of bodies conveyed, sometimes by the command of  oracles, sometimes by the good-will of their friends, from foreign  countries to the sepulchres of their fathers, and with great solemnity  deposited there. Thus, Theseus was removed from Scyros to Athens,  Orestes from Tegea, &c. Nor was this pious care limited to persons of  free condition, but slaves also had some share therein; for we find  (says Potter) the Athenian lawgiver commanding the magistrates, called  _Demarchi_, under a severe penalty, to solemnize the funerals, not so  much of citizens, whose friends seldom failed of paying the last  honours, as of slaves, who frequently were destitute of decent burial.    Those who wasted their patrimony, forfeited their right of being  buried in the sepulchres of their fathers. As soon as any person had  expired, they closed his eyes. Augustus Caesar, upon the approach of  his death, called for a looking-glass, and caused his hair to be  combed, and his fallen cheeks decently composed. All the offices about  the dead were performed by their nearest relations; nor could a  greater misfortune befal any person than to want these respects. When  dying, their friends and relations came close to the bed where they  lay, to bid them farewell, and catch their dying words, which they  never repeated without reverence. The want of opportunity to pay this  compliment to Hector, furnishes Andromache with matter of lamentation,  which is related in the Iliad. They kissed and embraced the dying  person, so taking their last farewell; and endeavoured likewise to  receive in their mouth his last breath, as fancying his soul to expire  with it, and enter into their bodies. When any person died in debt at  Athens, the laws of that city gave leave to creditors to seize the  dead body, and deprive it of burial till payment was made; whence the  corpse of Miltiades, who died in prison, being like to want the honour  of burial, his son Cimon had no other means to release it, but by  taking upon himself his father's debts and fetters. Sometime before  interment, a piece of money was put into the corpse's mouth, which was  thought to be Charon's fare for wafting the departed soul over the  infernal river.

The Manor of Broughton Lindsay, in Lincolnshire, is held under that of  Caistor, by this strange service: viz. that annually, upon Palm  Sunday, the deputy of the Lord of the Manor of Broughton, attends the  church at Caistor, with a new cart whip in his hand, which he cracks  thrice in the church porch; and passes with it on his shoulder up the  nave into the chancel, and seats himself in the pew of the lord of the  manor, where he remains until the officiating minister is about to  read the second lesson; he then proceeds with his whip, to the lash of  which he has in the meantime affixed a purse, which ought to contain  thirty silver pennies (instead of which a single half crown is  substituted,) and kneeling down before the reading desk, he holds the  purse, suspended over the minister's head, all the time he is reading  the lesson. After this he returns to his seat. When divine service is  over, he leaves the whip and purse at the manor house.

The name of New Spain was at first given only to Yucatan by Grijalva  and his followers; but Cortez extended it to the whole empire of  Montezuma, which is described by the earliest writers to have reached  from Panama to New California. This, however, appears, from more  recent researches, on the accuracy of which Humboldt relies with  reason, to have been larger than the reality justified; and the whole  of Tenochtitlan may be said to have been contained in the present  states of Vera Cruz, Oaxaca, Puebla, Mexico, and Valadolid. In  addition to the name given by Cortez, that of the capital was extended  to the whole kingdom of New Spain; and since the revolution and the  establishment of independence, the several provinces form separate and  independent states, confederating together and constituting the  nineteen United States of Mexico; viz. Chiapa, Chihuahua, Cohahuila  and Texas, Durango, Guanaxuato, Mexico, Michoachan, New Leon, Oaxaca,  Puebla, Queretaro, San Luis Potosi, Sonora and Cinaloa, Tabasco,  Tamaulipas, Vera Cruz, Xalisco, Yucatan and Zacatecas. Old and New  California, Colima, New Mexico, and Tlascala, though forming members  of the federation, declined having state governments, on account of  the expense, and are designated territories. The whole republic,  according to Humboldt, occupies a space of 75,830 square leagues, of  twenty to an equinoxial degree; on which there are to be found every  inequality of surface, and every variety of soil and climate, the two  last of which are dependent in most cases on the former.    The republic of Mexico, taken on the grand scale, may be considered as  a succession of small mountain-plains at different heights, separated  by mountains, and increasing in magnitude as the coast recedes on both  the eastern and western sides, until the great centre plain be  reached, which, though much broken by mountain ridges, tends to the  north, maintaining nearly an equal elevation. The snow-capped  mountains of Orizava, and the volcanos of Puebla and Toluca, are among  the most splendid objects in the world. The Mexicans divide the  regions of their country into _Tierras calientes, Tierras templadas_,  and _Tierras frias_, according to the climate. Throughout the whole  country there is a lamentable want of water, and of navigable rivers.  The lakes, too, appear to be yearly decreasing in extent, the  immediate consequence of which is, that the elevated portions of the  interior are nearly stripped of vegetation, and the soil covered with  an efflorescence of carbonate of soda, there called _Tequisquita_,  resembling very closely the plains of the two Castiles, and recalling  to the Eastern traveller the desolate wastes of some parts of Persia.    The effect of elevation on the temperature is most marked, and it is  no uncommon thing to be shivering on one side of the street in the  city of Mexico, and to be literally scorched by the rays of the sun on  the other. Changes are upon record of 55 deg. of Fahrenheit within three  hours, on one of the mountain-plains at the same height with the  valley of Mexico.    Notwithstanding the volcanic character of Mexico, earthquakes are by  no means so frequent there as in some of the neighbouring countries.  One of the most memorable on record occurred on the 14th of September,  1759, when the volcano of Jorullo, with several smaller cones, forced  the surface of the soil, destroying all before it.    The infinite variety of climate and soil fits this country for the  production of the fruits of all regions, from those of the hottest  within the tropics to those of the severest cold, where cultivation  can be carried on. But the want of ports, and of navigable rivers on  the Atlantic, opposes the advantages that might result from this  variety of production, though on the Pacific there are a few admirable  ports, such as Acapulco.
