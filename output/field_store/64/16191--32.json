They walked very leisurely  along the road, followed by a large pack of dogs, and were received by the  inhabitants on their entry into town with the most lively curiosity and  delight. Soon after their arrival they walked up to the Government House,  and were introduced to his Excellency, and the interview that took place  was truly interesting. They are delighted at the idea of proceeding to  Great Island, where they will enjoy peace and plenty uninterrupted. The  great susceptibility which they one and all evinced of the influence of  music when the band struck up, which Colonel Logan had purposely ordered  down, clearly showed the numerous spectators the power of this agent of  communication, even in the savage breast. After, in the greatest good  humour, and with an evident desire to make themselves agreeable, going  through various feats of their wonderful dexterity, they proceeded on  board the Swan River packet, until the Tamar is ready to proceed with them  to Great Island. The women were frightfully ornamented with human bones  hung round them in various fantastic forms, even to the rows of teeth and  skulls. Some of these were the remains of enemies, and white persons whom  they had killed, but more as the mementos of the affection which they bore  to the husband or children whom they had lost. They each carried a handful  of spears. They wore the usual kangaroo skin cloak thrown over the back or  shoulder, and thickly smeared with red ochre and grease. Their hair as  well as skin was also thickly coated with the same, the hair being  carefully dressed or formed by its help into neat little knots or globules  all round the head. One of the men has lost his arm, being the same who  about two years ago was caught in the rat trap that happened to be set in  the flour cask in Mr. Adey's stock-keeper's hut. They surrendered to Mr.  Robinson (who, however, very prudently did not take possession of them)  six stand of arms, which they had taken from the whites they had murdered,  or stolen from the huts. Three of them were ready loaded, and the muzzles  carefully stuffed with pieces of blanket, and one is the same which was so  recently borne by the late unfortunate Mr. Parker. The inside of several  of their bark huts, which Mr. Robinson entered, was very ingeniously  ornamented with rude delineations of kangaroos, emus, and other animals.  The removal of these blacks will be of essential benefit both to  themselves and the colony. The large tracts of pasture that have so long  been deserted, owing to their murderous attacks on the shepherds and the  stockhuts, will now be available, and a very sensible relief will be  afforded to the flocks of sheep that had been withdrawn from them, and  pent up on inadequate ranges of pasture--a circumstance which indeed has  tended materially to impoverish the flocks and keep up the price of  butcher's meat.    The dogs which these poor people have nursed and bred up in order to  assist them in hunting the kangaroo, have latterly become so numerous and  wild as to be a very serious and alarming nuisance to the settlers,  committing on many farms nightly ravages on their flocks. In the  neighbourhood of Benlomond they are particularly troublesome, and  are so wild and savage as to set even men at defiance. Notwithstanding  this, however, the numbers of the kangaroo seem daily and rapidly to  increase. Whether this arises from the latterly diminished slaughter among  them, owing to the decrease of the blacks who formerly fed upon them, or  from the effects of the Dog Act, which induced many to destroy their dogs  and to desist from the chase, or from the relish which the animal itself  has acquired for the corn and other artificial food it finds upon the  cultivated farms, we cannot say, but certain it is, that not only patches,  but whole acres of corn in many situations are this year destroyed by  their nightly inroads, coming as they do in droves of fifties and hundreds.  As an instance we may mention that on Mr. Gunn's farm at the Coal River  alone, a fine field of five acres of wheat has lately been completely  eaten down by them. Many persons are in consequence falling on the  expedient of catching them in wires and pitfalls in order to diminish them.    The ravages committed by the opossums, in like manner, are almost equally  ruinous to the hopes of the farmer, in addition to the attacks of  bandicoots, kangaroo rats, and the other almost innumerable (and certainly  as yet unknown to naturalists) species of small quadrupeds that every  where inhabit the wild bush and underwood of this island. Mr. Nicholas, of  the Clyde, accompanied by his servant, lately, in the course of half a  dozen evenings, and within the range of a moderate-sized field, killed no  less than 340 of these opussums in the immediate vicinity of his own house.    [The beneficial result of this surrender need not be explained. The lives  and properties of the settlers will now be secure, and the wild natives  become useful members of society. The passing of man from the opposite  states of barbarism and civilization is one of the most pathetic episodes  in the drama of human life. In the _Morning Herald_, where we find the  above extract from a recent _Hobart Town Courier_, it is pertinently  observed, \"When we find one of those natives of Van Diemen's Land had lost  an arm which had been torn off in a trap, and that the wound was healed,  the question naturally suggests itself, after all that we have heard of  late about 'anatomical science,' what is the science of the wilderness  that performed such a cure?\" We fear it will puzzle the heads of all the  colleges in Europe to solve this problem.]           *       *       *       *       *        THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.      LORD BYRON.      [The _New Monthly Magazine_ promises an abundance of light, summer reading  in Lady Blessington's Conversations with Lord Byron. They are of that gay,  jaunty character which editors, booksellers, and readers think so  peculiarly adapted for the season. Here are a few specimens:]      JOURNAL OF CONVERSATIONS WITH LORD BYRON.    _By the Countess of Blessington._    *** Our readers will recollect those letters in the second volume of  Moore's Byron, addressed to Lady B----, which confer such additional value  on that work. The whole of the journal, in which those letters, given by  Lady B---- to Mr. Moore, were entered, (and which journal was never shown  to Mr. Moore, nor indeed till now confided to any one,) is in our hands,  and will appear, from time to time, in the _New Monthly_, till concluded.  It is full of the most varied interest, and we believe that it will be  found to convey at least as natural and unexaggerated an account of Lord  Byron's character as has yet been presented to the public.    _Genoa, April 1st_, 1823.--Saw Lord Byron for the first time. The  impression for the first few minutes disappointed me, as I had, both from  the portraits and descriptions given, conceived a different idea of him. I  had fancied him taller, with a more dignified and commanding air; and I  looked in vain for the hero-looking sort of person with whom I had so long  identified him in imagination. His appearance is, however, highly  prepossessing; his head is finely shaped, and the forehead open, high, and  noble; his eyes are grey and full of expression, but one is visibly larger  than the other; the nose is large and well shaped, but from being a little  _too thick_, it looks better in profile than in front-face: his mouth is  the most remarkable feature in his face, the upper lip of Grecian  shortness, and the corners descending; the lips full, and finely cut. In  speaking, he shows his teeth very much, and they are white and even; but I  observed that even in his smile--and he smiles frequently--there is  something of a scornful expression in his mouth that is evidently natural,  and not, as many suppose, affected. This particularly struck me. His chin  is large and well shaped, and finishes well the oval of his face. He is  extremely thin, indeed so much so that his figure has almost a boyish air;  his face is peculiarly pale, but not the paleness of ill-health, as its  character is that of fairness, the fairness of a dark-haired person--and  his hair (which is getting rapidly grey) is of a very dark brown, and  curls naturally: he uses a good deal of oil in it, which makes it look  still darker. His countenance is full of expression, and changes with the  subject of conversation; it gains on the beholder the more it is seen, and  leaves an agreeable impression. I should say that melancholy was its  prevailing character, as I observed that when any observation elicited a  smile--and they were many, as the conversation was gay and playful--it  appeared to linger but for a moment on his lip, which instantly resumed  its former expression of seriousness. His whole appearance is remarkably  gentlemanlike, and he owes nothing of this to his toilette, as his coat  appears to have been many years made, is much too large--and all his  garments convey the idea of having been purchased ready made, so ill do  they fit him. There is a _gaucherie_ in his movements, which evidently  proceeds from the perpetual consciousness of his lameness, that appears to  haunt him; for he tries to conceal his foot when seated, and when walking,  has a nervous rapidity in his manner. He is very slightly lame, and the  deformity of his foot is so little remarkable that I am not now aware  which foot it is. His voice and accent are peculiarly agreeable, but  effeminate--clear, harmonious, and so distinct, that though his general  tone in speaking is rather low than high, not a word is lost. His manners  are as unlike my preconceived notions of them as is his appearance. I had  expected to find him a dignified, cold,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1259"],[0,"Twenty Years After (#3)"],[1," as before; one might have fancied him an apparition.    When he was left alone the cardinal looked at himself in the glass with  a feeling of self-satisfaction. Still young--for he was scarcely  forty-six years of age--he possessed great elegance of form and was  above the middle height; his complexion was brilliant and beautiful; his  glance full of expression; his nose, though large, was well  proportioned; his forehead broad and majestic; his hair, of a chestnut  color, was curled slightly; his beard, which was darker than his hair,  was turned carefully with a curling iron, a practice that greatly  improved it. After a short time the cardinal arranged his shoulder belt,  then looked with great complacency at his hands, which were most elegant  and of which he took the greatest care; and throwing on one side the  large kid gloves tried on at first, as belonging to the uniform, he put  on others of silk only. At this instant the door opened.    \"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said the valet-de-chambre.    An officer, as he spoke, entered the apartment. He was a man between  thirty-nine and forty years of age, of medium height but a very well  proportioned figure; with an intellectual and animated physiognomy; his  beard black, and his hair turning gray, as often happens when people  have found life either too gay or too sad, more especially when they  happen to be of swart complexion.    D'Artagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment.    How perfectly he remembered his former entrance into that very room!  Seeing, however, no one there except a musketeer of his own troop, he  fixed his eyes upon the supposed soldier, in whose dress, nevertheless,  he recognized at the first glance the cardinal.    The lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but respectful posture,  such as became a man of good birth, who had in the course of his life  been frequently in the society of the highest nobles.    The cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather than serious glance,  yet he examined his countenance with attention and after a momentary  silence said:    \"You are Monsieur d'Artagnan?\"    \"I am that individual,\" replied the officer.    Mazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence, the play  of which had been, nevertheless, subdued by age and experience; and  D'Artagnan received the penetrating glance like one who had formerly  sustained many a searching look, very different, indeed, from those  which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant.    \"Sir,\" resumed the cardinal, \"you are to come with me, or rather, I am  to go with you.\"    \"I am at your command, my lord,\" returned D'Artagnan.    \"I wish to visit in person the outposts which surround the Palais Royal;  do you suppose that there is any danger in so doing?\"    \"Danger, my lord!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan with a look of astonishment,  \"what danger?\"    \"I am told that there is a general insurrection.\"    \"The uniform of the king's musketeers carries a certain respect with it,  and even if that were not the case I would engage with four of my men to  put to flight a hundred of these clowns.\"    \"Did you witness the injury sustained by Comminges?\"    \"Monsieur de Comminges is in the guards and not in the musketeers----\"    \"Which means, I suppose, that the musketeers are better soldiers than  the guards.\" The cardinal smiled as he spoke.    \"Every one likes his own uniform best, my lord.\"    \"Myself excepted,\" and again Mazarin smiled; \"for you perceive that I  have left off mine and put on yours.\"    \"Lord bless us! this is modesty indeed!\" cried D'Artagnan. \"Had I such a  uniform as your eminence possesses, I protest I should be mightily  content, and I would take an oath never to wear any other costume----\"    \"Yes, but for to-night's adventure I don't suppose my dress would have  been a very safe one. Give me my felt hat, Bernouin.\"    The valet instantly brought to his master a regimental hat with a wide  brim. The cardinal put it on in military style.    \"Your horses are ready saddled in their stables, are they not?\" he said,  turning to D'Artagnan.    \"Yes, my lord.\"    \"Well, let us set out.\"    \"How many men does your eminence wish to escort you?\"    \"You say that with four men you will undertake to disperse a hundred low  fellows; as it may happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred,  take eight----\"    \"As many as my lord wishes.\"    \"I will follow you. This way--light us downstairs Bernouin.\"    The valet held a wax-light; the cardinal took a key from his bureau and  opening the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the  Palais Royal.          2. A Nightly Patrol.      In ten minutes Mazarin and his party were traversing the street \"Les  Bons Enfants\" behind the theatre built by Richelieu expressly for the  play of \"Mirame,\" and in which Mazarin, who was an amateur of music, but  not of literature, had introduced into France the first opera that was  ever acted in that country.    The appearance of the town denoted the greatest agitation. Numberless  groups paraded the streets and, whatever D'Artagnan might think of it,  it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their  usual forbearance, in order to assume a warlike aspect. From time to  time noises came in the direction of the public markets. The report of  firearms was heard near the Rue Saint Denis and occasionally church  bells began to ring indiscriminately and at the caprice of the populace.  D'Artagnan, meantime, pursued his way with the indifference of a man  upon whom such acts of folly made no impression. When he approached a  group in the middle of the street he urged his horse upon it without a  word of warning; and the members of the group, whether rebels or not, as  if they knew with what sort of a man they had to deal, at once gave  place to the patrol. The cardinal envied that composure, which he  attributed to the habit of meeting danger; but none the less he  conceived for the officer under whose orders he had for the moment  placed himself, that consideration which even prudence pays to careless  courage. On approaching an outpost near the Barriere des Sergens, the  sentinel cried out, \"Who's there?\" and D'Artagnan answered--having first  asked the word of the cardinal--\"Louis and Rocroy.\" After which he  inquired if Lieutenant Comminges were not the commanding officer at the  outpost. The soldier replied by pointing out to him an officer who was  conversing, on foot, his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the  individual to whom he was talking sat. Here was the officer D'Artagnan  was seeking.    \"Here is Monsieur Comminges,\" said D'Artagnan, returning to the  cardinal. He instantly retired, from a feeling of respectful delicacy;  it was, however, evident that the cardinal was recognized by both  Comminges and the other officers on horseback.    \"Well done, Guitant,\" cried the cardinal to the equestrian; \"I see  plainly that, notwithstanding the sixty-four years that have passed over  your head, you are still the same man, active and zealous. What were you  saying to this youngster?\"    \"My lord,\" replied Guitant, \"I was observing that we live in troublous  times and that to-day's events are very like those in the days of the  Ligue, of which I heard so much in my youth. Are you aware that the mob  have even suggested throwing up barricades in the Rue Saint Denis and  the Rue Saint Antoine?\"    \"And what was Comminges saying to you in reply, my good Guitant?\"    \"My lord,\" said Comminges, \"I answered that to compose a Ligue only one  ingredient was wanting--in my opinion an essential one--a Duc de Guise;  moreover, no generation ever does the same thing twice.\"    \"No, but they mean to make a Fronde, as they call it,\" said Guitant.    \"And what is a Fronde?\" inquired Mazarin.    \"My lord, Fronde is the name the discontented give to their party.\"    \"And what is the origin of this name?\"    \"It seems that some days since Councillor Bachaumont remarked at the  palace that rebels and agitators reminded him of schoolboys  slinging--qui frondent--stones from the moats round Paris, young urchins  who run off the moment the constable appears, only to return to their  diversion the instant his back is turned. So they have picked up the  word and the insurrectionists are called 'Frondeurs,' and yesterday  every article sold was 'a la Fronde;' bread 'a la Fronde,' hats 'a la  Fronde,' to say nothing of gloves, pocket-handkerchiefs, and fans; but  listen----\"    At that moment a window opened and a man began to sing:        | \"A tempest from the Fronde      | Did blow to-day:      | I think 'twill blow      | Sieur Mazarin away.\"    \"Insolent wretch!\" cried Guitant.    \"My lord,\" said Comminges, who, irritated by his wounds, wished for  revenge and longed to give back blow for blow, \"shall I fire off a ball  to punish that jester, and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune  in the future?\"    And as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncle's  saddle-bow.    \"Certainly not! certainly not,\" exclaimed Mazarin. \"Diavolo! my dear  friend, you are going to spoil everything--everything is going on  famously. I know the French as well as if I had made them myself. They  sing--let them pay the piper. During the Ligue, about which Guitant was  speaking just now, the people chanted nothing except the mass, so  everything went to destruction. Come, Guitant, come along, and let's see  if they keep watch at the Quinze-Vingts as at the Barriere des Sergens.\"    And waving his hand to Comminges he rejoined D'Artagnan, who instantly  put himself at the head of his troop, followed by the cardinal, Guitant  and the rest of the escort.    \"Just so,\" muttered Comminges, looking after Mazarin. \"True, I forgot;  provided he can get money out of the people, that is all he wants.\"    The street of Saint Honore, when the cardinal and his party passed  through it, was crowded by an assemblage who, standing in groups,  discussed the"]]]
