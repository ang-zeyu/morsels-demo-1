Nature has denied it  a song, but given a costly garment in lieu of it. The smallest species  of jacamar is very common in the dry savannas. The second size, all  golden-green on the back, must be looked for in the wallaba-forest. The  third is found throughout the whole extent of these wilds, and the  fourth, which is the largest, frequents the interior, where you begin  to perceive stones in the ground.    When you have penetrated far into Macoushia, you hear the pretty  songster called troupiale pour forth a variety of sweet and plaintive  notes. This is the bird which the Portuguese call the nightingale of  Guiana. Its predominant colours are rich orange and shining black,  arrayed to great advantage. His delicate and well-shaped frame seems  unable to bear captivity. The Indians sometimes bring down troupiales  to Stabroek, but in a few months they languish and die in a cage. They  soon become very familiar, and if you allow them the liberty of the  house, they live longer than in a cage and appear in better spirits,  but when you least expect it they drop down and die in epilepsy.    Smaller in size, and of colour not so rich and somewhat differently  arranged, another species of troupiale sings melodiously in Demerara.  The woodcutter is particularly favoured by him, for while the hen is  sitting on her nest, built in the roof of the woodcutter's house, he  sings for hours together close by. He prefers the forests to the  cultivated parts.    You would not grudge to stop for a few minutes, as you are walking in  the plantations, to observe a third species of troupiale: his wings,  tail and throat are black; all the rest of the body is a bright yellow.  There is something very sweet and plaintive in his song, though much  shorter than that of the troupiale in the interior.    A fourth species goes in flocks from place to place, in the cultivated  parts, at the time the indian-corn is ripe; he is all black, except the  head and throat, which are yellow. His attempt at song is not worth  attending to.    Wherever there is a wild fig-tree ripe, a numerous species of birds  called tangara is sure to be on it. There are eighteen beautiful  species here. Their plumage is very rich and diversified. Some of them  boast six separate colours; others have the blue, purple, green and  black so kindly blended into each other that it would be impossible to  mark their boundaries; while others again exhibit them strong, distinct  and abrupt. Many of these tangaras have a fine song. They seem to  partake much of the nature of our linnets, sparrows and finches. Some  of them are fond of the plantations; others are never seen there,  preferring the wild seeds of the forest to the choicest fruits planted  by the hand of man.    On the same fig-trees to which they repair, and often accidentally up  and down the forest, you fall in with four species of manikin. The  largest is white and black, with the feathers on the throat remarkably  long; the next in size is half red and half black; the third black,  with a white crown; the fourth black, with a golden crown, and red  feathers at the knee. The half-red and half-black species is the  scarcest. There is a creek in the Demerara called Camouni. About ten  minutes from the mouth you see a common-sized fig-tree on your right  hand, as you ascend, hanging over the water; it bears a very small fig  twice a year. When its fruit is ripe this manikin is on the tree from  morn till eve.    On all the ripe fig-trees in the forest you see the bird called the  small tiger-bird. Like some of our belles and dandies, it has a gaudy  vest to veil an ill-shaped body. The throat, and part of the head, are  a bright red; the breast and belly have black spots on a yellow ground;  the wings are a dark green, black, and white; and the rump and tail  black and green. Like the manikin, it has no song: it depends solely  upon a showy garment for admiration.    Devoid, too, of song, and in a still superber garb, the yawaraciri  comes to feed on the same tree. It has a bar like black velvet from the  eyes to the beak; its legs are yellow; its throat, wings and tail  black; all the rest of the body a charming blue. Chiefly in the dry  savannas, and here and there accidentally in the forest, you see a  songless yawaraciri still lovelier than the last: his crown is whitish  blue, arrayed like a coat of mail; his tail is black, his wings black  and yellow; legs red; and the whole body a glossy blue. Whilst roving  through the forest, ever and anon you see individuals of the wren  species busy amongst the fallen leaves, or seeking insects at the roots  of the trees.    Here, too, you find six or seven species of small birds whose backs  appear to be overloaded with silky plumage. One of these, with a  chestnut breast, smoke-coloured back, tail red, white feathers like  horns on his head, and white narrow-pointed feathers under the jaw,  feeds entirely upon ants. When a nest of large light-brown ants  emigrates, one following the other in meandering lines above a mile  long, you see this bird watching them and every now and then picking  them up. When they disappear he is seen no more: perhaps this is the  only kind of ant he is fond of. When these ants are stirring, you are  sure to find him near them. You cannot well mistake the ant after you  have once been in its company, for its sting is very severe, and you  can hardly shoot the bird and pick it up without having five or six  upon you.    Parrots and paroquets are very numerous here, and of many different  kinds. You will know when they are near you in the forest not only by  the noise they make, but also by the fruits and seeds which they let  fall while they are feeding.    The hia-hia parrot, called in England the parrot of the sun, is very  remarkable: he can erect at pleasure a fine radiated circle of tartan  feathers quite round the back of his head from jaw to jaw. The  fore-part of his head is white; his back, tail and wings green; and his  breast and belly tartan.    Superior in size and beauty to every parrot of South America, the ara  will force you to take your eyes from the rest of animated nature and  gaze at him: his commanding strength, the flaming scarlet of his body,  the lovely variety of red, yellow, blue and green in his wings, the  extraordinary length of his scarlet and blue tail, seem all to join and  demand for him the title of emperor of all the parrots. He is scarce in  Demerara till you reach the confines of the Macoushi country: there he  is in vast abundance. He mostly feeds on trees of the palm species.  When the coucourite-trees have ripe fruit on them they are covered with  this magnificent parrot. He is not shy or wary: you may take your  blow-pipe and quiver of poisoned arrows and kill more than you are able  to carry back to your hut. They are very vociferous, and, like the  common parrots, rise up in bodies towards sunset and fly two and two to  their place of rest. It is a grand sight in ornithology to see  thousands of aras flying over your head, low enough to let you have a  full view of their flaming mantle. The Indians find their flesh very  good, and the feathers serve for ornaments in their head-dresses. They  breed in the holes of trees, are easily reared and tamed, and learn to  speak pretty distinctly.    Another species frequents the low-lands of Demerara. He is nearly the  size of the scarlet ara, but much inferior in plumage. Blue and yellow  are his predominant colours.    Along the creeks and river-sides, and in the wet savannas, six species  of the bittern will engage your attention. They are all handsome, the  smallest not so large as the English water-hen.    In the savannas, too, you will sometimes surprise the snow-white egret,  whose back is adorned with the plumes from which it takes its name.  Here, too, the spur-winged water-hen, the blue and green water-hen and  two other species of ordinary plumage are found. While in quest of  these, the blue heron, the large and small brown heron, the boatbill  and muscovy duck now and then rise up before you.    When the sun has sunk in the western woods, no longer agitated by the  breeze; when you can only see a straggler or two of the feathered tribe  hastening to join its mate, already at its roosting-place, then it is  that the goat-sucker comes out of the forest, where it has sat all day  long in slumbering ease, unmindful of the gay and busy scenes around  it. Its eyes are too delicately formed to bear the light, and thus it  is forced to shun the flaming face of day and wait in patience till  night invites him to partake of the pleasures her dusky presence brings.    The harmless, unoffending goat-sucker, from the time of Aristotle down  to the present day, has been in disgrace with man. Father has handed  down to son, and author to author, that this nocturnal thief subsists  by milking the flocks. Poor injured little bird of night, how sadly  hast thou suffered, and how foul a stain has inattention to facts put  upon thy character! Thou hast never robbed man of any part of his  property nor deprived the kid of a drop of milk.    When the moon shines bright you may have a fair opportunity of  examining the goat-sucker. You will see it close by the cows, goats and  sheep, jumping up every now and then under their bellies. Approach a  little nearer--he is not shy: \"he fears no danger, for he knows no  sin.\" See how the nocturnal flies are tormenting the herd, and with  what dexterity he springs up and catches them as fast as they alight on  the belly, legs and udder of the animals. Observe how quiet they stand,  and how sensible they seem of his good offices, for they neither strike  at him nor hit him with their tail, nor tread on him, nor try to drive  him away as an uncivil intruder. Were you to dissect him, and inspect  his stomach, you would find no milk there.

During the opposition of  1881-2 the same observer re-observed the canals, and in twenty of them  he found the canals duplicated,[4] the second canal being always 200  to 400 miles distant from its fellow.    The existence of these canals has been doubted.  Mr. Lowell has now  devoted years to the subject, has drawn them over and over again, and  has photographed them; and accepts the explanation that they are  artificial, and that vegetation grows on their banks.  Thus is revived  the old controversy between Whewell and Brewster as to the  habitability of the planets. The new arguments are not yet generally  accepted. Lowell believes he has, with the spectroscope, proved the  existence of water on Mars.    One of the most unexpected and interesting of all telescopic  discoveries took place in the opposition of 1877, when Mars was  unusually near to the earth. The Washington Observatory had acquired  the fine 26-inch refractor, and Asaph Hall searched for satellites,  concealing the planet's disc to avoid the glare. On August 11th he had  a suspicion of a satellite. This was confirmed on the 16th, and on the  following night a second one was added. They are exceedingly faint,  and can be seen only by the most powerful telescopes, and only at the  times of opposition. Their diameters are estimated at six or seven  miles. It was soon found that the first, Deimos, completes its orbit  in 30h. 18m.  But the other, Phobos, at first was a puzzle, owing to  its incredible velocity being unsuspected. Later it was found that the  period of revolution was only 7h. 39m. 22s. Since the Martian day is  twenty-four and a half hours, this leads to remarkable results.  Obviously the easterly motion of the satellite overwhelms the diurnal  rotation of the planet, and Phobos must appear to the inhabitants, if  they exist, to rise in the west and set in the east, showing two or  even three full moons in a day, so that, sufficiently well for the  ordinary purposes of life, the hour of the day can be told by its  phases.    The discovery of these two satellites is, perhaps, the most  interesting telescopic visual discovery made with the large telescopes  of the last half century; photography having been the means of  discovering all the other new satellites except Jupiter's fifth (in  order of discovery).    [Illustration: JUPITER.  From a drawing by E. M. Antoniadi, showing  transit of a satellite's shadow, the belts, and the \"great red spot\"  (_Monthly Notices_, R. A. S., vol. lix., pl. x.).]    _Jupiter._--Galileo's discovery of Jupiter's satellites was followed  by the discovery of his belts. Zucchi and Torricelli seem to have seen  them. Fontana, in 1633, reported three belts. In 1648 Grimaldi saw but  two, and noticed that they lay parallel to the ecliptic. Dusky spots  were also noticed as transient. Hooke[5] measured the motion of one in  1664. In 1665 Cassini, with a fine telescope, 35-feet focal length,  observed many spots moving from east to west, whence he concluded that  Jupiter rotates on an axis like the earth. He watched an unusually  permanent spot during twenty-nine rotations, and fixed the period at  9h. 56m. Later he inferred that spots near the equator rotate quicker  than those in higher latitudes (the same as Carrington found for the  sun); and W. Herschel confirmed this in 1778-9.    Jupiter's rapid rotation ought, according to Newton's theory, to be  accompanied by a great flattening at the poles. Cassini had noted an  oval form in 1691. This was confirmed by La Hire, Roemer, and  Picard. Pound measured the ellipticity = 1/(13.25).    W. Herschel supposed the spots to be masses of cloud in the  atmosphere--an opinion still accepted.  Many of them were very  permanent. Cassini's great spot vanished and reappeared nine times  between 1665 and 1713. It was close to the northern margin of the  southern belt. Herschel supposed the belts to be the body of the  planet, and the lighter parts to be clouds confined to certain  latitudes.    In 1665 Cassini observed transits of the four satellites, and also saw  their shadows on the planet, and worked out a lunar theory for  Jupiter. Mathematical astronomers have taken great interest in the  perturbations of the satellites, because their relative periods  introduce peculiar effects. Airy, in his delightful book,  _Gravitation_, has reduced these investigations to simple  geometrical explanations.    In 1707 and 1713 Miraldi noticed that the fourth satellite varies much  in brightness. W. Herschel found this variation to depend upon its  position in its orbit, and concluded that in the positions of  feebleness it is always presenting to us a portion of its surface,  which does not well reflect the sun's light; proving that it always  turns the same face to Jupiter, as is the case with our moon. This  fact had also been established for Saturn's fifth satellite, and may  be true for all satellites.    In 1826 Struve measured the diameters of the four satellites, and  found them to be 2,429, 2,180, 3,561, and 3,046 miles.    In modern times much interest has been taken in watching a rival to  Cassini's famous spot. The \"great red spot\" was first observed by  Niesten, Pritchett, and Tempel, in 1878, as a rosy cloud attached to a  whitish zone beneath the dark southern equatorial band, shaped like  the new war balloons, 30,000 miles long and 7,000 miles across. The  next year it was brick-red. A white spot beside it completed a  rotation in less time by 51/2 minutes than the red spot--a difference  of 260 miles an hour. Thus they came together again every six weeks,  but the motions did not continue uniform.  The spot was feeble in  1882-4, brightened in 1886, and, after many changes, is still visible.    Galileo's great discovery of Jupiter's four moons was the last word in  this connection until September 9th, 1892, when Barnard, using the  36-inch refractor of the Lick Observatory, detected a tiny spot of  light closely following the planet. This proved to be a new satellite  (fifth), nearer to the planet than any other, and revolving round it  in 11h. 57m. 23s. Between its rising and setting there must be an  interval of 21/2 Jovian days, and two or three full moons. The sixth  and seventh satellites were found by the examination of photographic  plates at the Lick Observatory in 1905, since which time they have  been continuously photographed, and their orbits traced, at Greenwich.  On examining these plates in 1908 Mr. Melotte detected the eighth  satellite, which seems to be revolving in a retrograde orbit three  times as far from its planet as the next one (seventh), in these two  points agreeing with the outermost of Saturn's satellites (Phoebe).    _Saturn._--This planet, with its marvellous ring, was perhaps the most  wonderful object of those first examined by Galileo's telescope. He  was followed by Dominique Cassini, who detected bands like Jupiter's  belts. Herschel established the rotation of the planet in 1775-94.  From observations during one hundred rotations he found the period to  be 10h. 16m. 0s., 44. Herschel also measured the ratio of the polar to  the equatoreal diameter as 10:11.    The ring was a complete puzzle to Galileo, most of all when the planet  reached a position where the plane of the ring was in line with the  earth, and the ring disappeared (December 4th, 1612). It was not until  1656 that Huyghens, in his small pamphlet _De Saturni Luna Observatio  Nova_, was able to suggest in a cypher the ring form; and in 1659, in  his Systema Saturnium, he gave his reasons and translated the cypher:  \"The planet is surrounded by a slender flat ring, everywhere distinct  from its surface, and inclined to the ecliptic.\" This theory explained  all the phases of the ring which had puzzled others. This ring was  then, and has remained ever since, a unique structure.  We in this age  have got accustomed to it. But Huyghens's discovery was received with  amazement.    In 1675 Cassini found the ring to be double, the concentric rings  being separated by a black band--a fact which was placed beyond  dispute by Herschel, who also found that the thickness of the ring  subtends an angle less than 0\".3. Shroeter estimated its thickness at  500 miles.    Many speculations have been advanced to explain the origin and  constitution of the ring. De Sejour said [6] that it was thrown off  from Saturn's equator as a liquid ring, and afterwards solidified. He  noticed that the outside would have a greater velocity, and be less  attracted to the planet, than the inner parts, and that equilibrium  would be impossible; so he supposed it to have solidified into a  number of concentric rings, the exterior ones having the least  velocity.    Clerk Maxwell, in the Adams prize essay, gave a physico-mathematical  demonstration that the rings must be composed of meteoritic matter  like gravel. Even so, there must be collisions absorbing the energy of  rotation, and tending to make the rings eventually fall into the  planet. The slower motion of the external parts has been proved by the  spectroscope in Keeler's hands, 1895.    Saturn has perhaps received more than its share of attention owing to  these rings. This led to other discoveries. Huyghens in 1655, and  J. D. Cassini in 1671, discovered the sixth and eighth satellites  (Titan and Japetus). Cassini lost his satellite, and in searching for  it found Rhea (the fifth) in 1672, besides his old friend, whom he  lost again. He added the third and fourth in 1684 (Tethys and  Dione). The first and second (Mimas and Encelades) were added by  Herschel in 1789, and the seventh (Hyperion) simultaneously by Lassel  and Bond in 1848. The ninth (Phoebe) was found on photographs, by  Pickering in 1898, with retrograde motion; and he has lately added a  tenth.    The occasional disappearance of Cassini's Japetus was found on  investigation to"]]]
