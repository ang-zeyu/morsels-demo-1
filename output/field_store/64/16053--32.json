Volume 1: Essentials of Cookery; Cereals; (#20)"],[1,"other food substances,  rice, which is fully three-fourths starch, containing the most, and  oats, which are less than one-half starch, the least. Starch is  distributed throughout the grain in tiny granules visible only under the  microscope, each being surrounded by a covering of material that is  almost indigestible. In the various grains, these tiny granules differ  from one another in appearance, but not to any great extent in general  structure, nutritive value, or digestibility, provided they are cooked  thoroughly. The large amount of carbohydrate, or starch, in cereals  explains why they are not hard to digest, for, as is well known, starch  is more easily digested than either protein or fat. This and the fact  that some grains contain also a large amount of fat account for the high  energy-producing quality of cereals. While it is safe to say that  cereals are chiefly valuable for their starch, the tissue-building  material in some grains, although in small proportion, is in sufficient  quantity to place them with the protein foods.    10. MINERAL MATTER IN CEREALS.--Cereals contain seven or eight of the  minerals required in the diet. Such a variety of minerals is sure to be  valuable to the human body, as it is about one-half of the whole number  required by the body for its maintenance. Since, as has already been  explained, much of the mineral matter lies directly under the coarse  outside covering, some of it is lost when this covering is removed. For  this reason, the grains that remain whole and the cereal products that  contain the entire grain are much more valuable from the standpoint of  minerals than those in which the bran covering is not retained. If a  sufficient percentage of minerals is secured in the diet from  vegetables, fruits, and milk, it is perhaps unnecessary to include whole  cereals; but if the diet is at all limited, it is advisable to select  those cereals which retain the original composition of the grain.    11. WATER IN CEREALS.--Cereals contain very little water in their  composition. This absence of water is a distinct advantage, for it makes  their nutritive value proportionately high and improves their keeping  quality. Just as the strength of a beverage is lowered by the addition  of water, so the nutritive value of foods decreases when they contain a  large amount of water. On the other hand, the keeping quality of cereals  could scarcely be improved, since the germs that cause foods to spoil  grow only in the presence of water. This low proportion of water also  permits them to be stored compactly, whereas if water occurred in large  amounts it would add materially to their bulk.    12. CELLULOSE IN CEREALS.--In addition to the five food substances that  are found in all cereals, there is always present another material known  as cellulose, which, as is pointed out elsewhere, is an indigestible  material that occurs on the outside of all grains, as the bran covering,  and covers the starch granules throughout the inside of the grain. In  fact, it forms a sort of skeleton upon which the grains are built. As  long as the cellulose remains unbroken, it prevents the grain from being  digested to any extent. However, it forms a valuable protective covering  for the grain and it has a certain value, as bulk, in the diet, a fact  that is ignored by some persons and overrated by others. It is well to  include at least some cellulose in cereal foods when they are taken in  the diet, because its presence tends to make food less concentrated.    13. TABLE SHOWING COMPOSITION OF CEREALS.--Not all grains, or cereals,  contain the same amount of food substances and cellulose; that is, while  one may be high in protein it may be lacking in some other food  substance. The relation that the various grains bear to one another with  regard to the food substances and cellulose is clearly set forth in  Table I. In this table, under the various food substances and cellulose,  the grains, with the exception of millet, are mentioned in the order of  their value, ranging from the highest down to the lowest in each of the  food substances and cellulose. Thus, as will be seen, wheat is highest  in protein and rice is lowest, oats are highest in fat and rye is  lowest, and so on. Also, as will be observed, while wheat is highest in  protein, it is, as compared with the other cereals, sixth in fat, fourth  in carbohydrate, fourth in cellulose, and fifth in mineral matter. In  this way may be compared all the other cereals to see in just what way  they are of value as a food.

Cereals and cereal products play a very important part in the food  problem, for the prosperity of a country depends on its grain crops and  the people of all classes are dependent on them for food. This is  evident when it is known that they form a greater proportion of the food  consumed than any other single food material. In their widespread  consumption, they have many and varied uses. In truth, a meal is seldom  served without some cereal food, for if no other is used, bread of some  description is almost always included. Besides bread, a cooked or a dry  cereal is usually served for breakfast, and for some persons this  constitutes the main breakfast dish, providing a nourishing and easily  digested food when served with milk or cream. This food is especially  desirable for children, and for this reason is always among the first  solid foods fed to them.    15. While to most persons the word cereal suggests the idea of a  breakfast food, because cereals are used most often for that purpose,  they find their place in other meals than breakfast. Although they are  used less often on the dinner table than elsewhere, they frequently have  an important place there, for a number of them are commonly used as  dinner dishes and others might be used more frequently, and to  advantage, too. In this connection, they are used in soups, and in  certain forms, usually the whole or slightly crushed grain, they take  the place of a vegetable. Some of them, particularly rice, are often  used with meat or cheese in making an entree or in combination with  eggs, milk, fruit, or various flavorings as a dessert to be served with  a heavy or a light meal. Cold cooked cereal is often sliced and sauted  and then served with meat or some other heavy protein dish. Cereals are  also used for lunch or supper, perhaps more often than for dinner, and  because of their easy digestion they are to be recommended for the  evening meal for all members of the family, but especially for children.  When used in this way, they may be served with cream, as for breakfast,  or prepared in any other suitable way. Whenever cereals are served,  whether alone or in combination with other foods, the result is an  economical dish and usually an easily digested one, unless, of course,  the food with which they are combined is expensive or indigestible. But,  to whatever use cereals are put, unless they are thoroughly cooked they  are not easily digested and they lose much of their value. In fact, the  ready-to-eat cereals, which have been thoroughly cooked, are preferable  to those which are poorly cooked in the home.      SELECTION AND CARE OF CEREALS    16. Preparation of Grains for the Market.--So that the housewife may go  about the selection of cereals in an intelligent manner, it may be well  for her to know how they are prepared for market. After the grains are  harvested, the first step in their preparation consists in thrashing,  which removes the husks from the outside. In some countries, thrashing  is done entirely by hand, but usually it is accomplished by machinery of  a simple or a more elaborate kind. Occasionally no further treatment is  applied, the whole grains being used as food, but generally they receive  further preparation. Sometimes they are crushed coarsely with or without  the bran covering, and in this form they are known as _grits._ At other  times they are ground finer and called _meal,_ and still finer and  called _flour,_ being used mostly in these two forms for the making of  various kinds of breads. Then, again, grains are rolled and crushed, as,  for example, _cracked wheat_ and _rolled oats._    Various elaborate means have been devised by which cereals are prepared  in unusual ways for the purpose of varying the diet. Sometimes they are  used alone, but often certain other materials are used in their  preparation for the market. For example, the popular flake cereals, such  as corn flakes, are cooked with salt and sometimes with sugar and then  rolled thin. Some of the cereals are thoroughly cooked, while others are  malted and toasted, but the treatment to which they are subjected is  generally given to them to improve their flavor and to aid in the work  of digestion.    17. FACTORS THAT GOVERN CEREAL SELECTION.--Besides knowing about the  ways in which cereals are prepared for market, the housewife should be  familiar with the factors that govern their selection for use as food.  In the first place, cereals should be chosen to suit the needs and  tastes of the members of the family, and then attention should be given  to the forms in which they can be purchased. Some cereals are sold in  sealed packages, while others can be bought in bulk. Each, however, has  its advantages.

Also, the texture of the finished  product is not, as a rule, equal to that of the dessert made in a  freezer turned with a dasher. In addition, it is necessary to crack the  ice somewhat finer for a vacuum freezer and to mix it thoroughly with  the correct proportion of salt required for the particular kind of  mixture frozen.    [Illustration: FIG. 16]    [Illustration: FIG. 17]    [Illustration: FIG. 18]    69. When a vacuum freezer is to be used, turn it upside down and insert  the ice-and-salt mixture through the opening in the bottom. Then close  it tight, turn it right side up, and with the top open, pour in the  mixture as shown in Fig, 16. Screw the top on tightly in the manner  shown in Fig. 17, just as the bottom is screwed on, and set the freezer  aside. After the mixture has stood for about 15 minutes, open the  freezer from the top and stir the contents down from the sides with a  knife or a spoon, as in Fig. 18. Then replace the cover and allow the  freezing to continue for 10 minutes more. At the end of this time, open  the freezer again, repeat the stirring, refasten the cover, and continue  the freezing for another 5 minutes. The mixture should then be ready  to serve.           *       *       *       *       *      RECIPES FOR FROZEN DESSERTS    ICE CREAMS    70. PHILADELPHIA ICE CREAM.--Perhaps the simplest of frozen desserts to  make is Philadelphia ice cream, but it requires cream in order that its  texture be good. For this reason, it is not so economical as some of  those which are a trifle more complicated to prepare. It consists of  cream sweetened, flavored, and then frozen. This is a particularly  attractive way in which to make ice cream when strawberries, red  raspberries, or peaches are in season, as these fresh fruits may be  crushed and added to the cream, instead of plain flavoring.    The recipe here given for the preparation of Philadelphia ice cream  contains vanilla as the flavoring, but fresh fruit of any desirable kind  may be added, this recipe being used merely as a basis. Usually 1 1/2  cupfuls of crushed fruit is required for a quart of cream. It is  necessary, however, to vary the quantity of sugar with the nature of the  fruit used. For instance, if fresh strawberries are used, more sugar  will be required than if canned ones are used, because sugar has already  been added to these. The best plan is to test the mixture before  freezing it, remembering always that more sugar is required for a frozen  dessert than would be necessary if the mixture were not to be frozen.    PHILADELPHIA ICE CREAM  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 qt. cream  1 Tb. vanilla  1 c. sugar    Scald the cream in a double boiler, add the sugar and the vanilla, and  cool. If desired, add 1 1/2 cupfuls of crushed fruit. If pineapple is  used, it may be grated or shredded instead of being crushed. Place in a  freezer and freeze according to the directions previously given.    71. VANILLA ICE CREAM.--Plain ice cream is usually made from  ingredients that are somewhat cheaper than those used to make  Philadelphia ice cream. It consists usually of a custard foundation, to  which are added flavoring, sometimes fruit, and usually thin cream. The  custard foundation is often made with corn starch and a small amount of  raw egg. The same rules must be observed in the preparation of this  foundation for ice cream as have been learned in the making of custards.  Frequently some starchy material, such as flour or corn starch, is used  for thickening in the preparation of this dessert. Some persons prefer  flour, as they believe that the presence of flour cannot be detected so  easily as that of corn starch; however, a recipe using each is given.  The mixtures used for this ice cream should not be boiled, but cooked in  a double boiler. If desired, fruits, either cooked or raw, or nuts may  be added to the ice cream for variety.    VANILLA ICE CREAM No. 1  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    4 Tb. flour  1 c. sugar  1/4 tsp. salt  4 c. milk  2 c. thin cream  2 eggs  2 Tb. vanilla    Mix the flour, sugar, and salt with sufficient cold liquid to moisten  well. Add this to the remainder of the milk and the cream heated in a  double boiler. Stir until thickened, and cook for about 20 minutes. Beat  the eggs and add slowly to the mixture, stirring rapidly to prevent  curding. Cook until the egg has thickened, strain, add the vanilla,  cool, and freeze.    VANILLA ICE CREAM No. 2  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 qt. milk  3 Tb. corn starch  1-1/2 c. sugar  2 eggs  1 pt. cream  1 Tb. vanilla    Scald the milk and stir into it the corn starch mixed with half the  sugar. Stir constantly until thickened, and cook for 15 to 20 minutes.  Beat the eggs, add the remaining sugar, mix with a little of the hot  mixture, and stir into the double boiler. Remove from the heat, add the  cream, strain, cool, add the flavoring, and freeze.    72. CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM.--Next to vanilla ice cream, chocolate seems to  be the most desired. Some persons think this variety is difficult to  make, but if the accompanying directions are carefully followed, no  difficulty will be experienced and a delicious dessert will be  the result.    CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    2 c. sugar  1/2 tsp. salt  1/2 c. water  4 Tb. flour  3 sq. melted chocolate  2 eggs  5 c. milk  4 tsp. vanilla  2 c. thin cream    Mix the sugar and water and cook until a sirup forms. Add this to the  melted chocolate and cook together until the two are well blended. Add  this mixture to the heated milk and cream, which have been seasoned with  the salt and thickened with the flour. Beat the eggs and add to the hot  mixture, stirring rapidly to prevent curding. Remove from the heat,  cool, add the vanilla, strain, and freeze.    73. MOCHA ICE CREAM.--As the flavor of coffee is usually well liked,  Mocha ice cream, which has coffee for its flavoring, is a dessert that  often finds a place in the meal. It is especially nice to serve in the  hot weather when hot coffee is omitted from the meal.    MOCHA ICE CREAM  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 c. water  1-1/4 c. sugar  1/3 3 c. ground coffee  1/4 tsp. salt  1-1/2 c. milk  1 qt. cream  2 eggs  1 tsp. vanilla    Heat the water and add it to the coffee. Allow this to stand on the back  of the stove for about 1/2 hour, and then strain through cheesecloth.  Heat the milk in a double boiler, and to it add the strained coffee.  Beat the eggs and add the sugar and salt to them. Stir into this a  spoonful of the hot milk and coffee and then add to the mixture in the  double boiler. Cook until the eggs have thickened, stirring constantly  to prevent curding. Remove from the heat, cool, add the cream and  vanilla, strain through a fine sieve, and freeze.    74. CARAMEL ICE CREAM.--No more delicious ice cream can be made than  that flavored with caramel. It is usually very fine in texture and rich  in flavor.    CARAMEL ICE CREAM  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1-1/2 c. sugar  1 egg  1/2 c. water  1/4 tsp. salt  2 c. milk  1 qt. thin cream  2 Tb. flour  1 Tb. vanilla    Caramelize 1/2 of the sugar and add the water. Cook to a sirup. Prepare  a custard with the milk, remaining sugar, flour, egg, and salt. Remove  from the heat, add the caramel and the cream, strain, add the vanilla,  cool, and freeze.    75. JUNKET ICE CREAM WITH PEACHES.--An attractive frozen dessert can be  made by freezing junket and serving it with canned peaches and peach  sirup. This may be made into a mold and the mold garnished with the  peaches, or it may be served on individual plates and a half of a peach  put on each plate.    JUNKET ICE CREAM WITH PEACHES  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 c. cream  1 Tb. cold water  1-1/2 qt. milk  1 Tb. vanilla  1-1/2 c. sugar  1 tsp. almond extract  1/4 tsp. salt  Green coloring  2 junket tablets  Canned peaches    Mix the cream and milk, add the sugar and salt, and heat in a double  boiler until lukewarm. Dissolve the junket tablets in the cold water and  add to the lukewarm milk. Add the flavoring and the green coloring,  making the junket a pale green, and stand in a warm place until set.  Turn into a freezer and freeze. If desired, mold and garnish the mold  with the peaches. Add sugar to the peach juice and cook until a thick  sirup is formed. Pour this over the whole and serve. If it is desired  not to mold the ice cream, serve it with a peach on individual serving  plates and pour a spoonful of peach sirup over each portion.    76. FRENCH ICE CREAM.--No more delicious ice cream can be made than that  given in the accompanying recipe and known as French ice cream. It is  especially nice for serving when something very attractive is desired,  as at a dainty luncheon or an afternoon or evening party.    FRENCH ICE CREAM  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 pt. milk  1 qt. cream  1 c. sugar  1 Tb. vanilla  Yolks of 8 eggs  1 tsp. lemon    Heat the milk and add the sugar and beaten yolks of the eggs. Cook until  the mixture thickens, remove from the fire, add the cream, vanilla, and  lemon. Cool and freeze.    FROZEN CUSTARDS    77. Frozen custard makes a very desirable kind of frozen dessert. If  properly made, the result is a delightfully rich dessert of smooth  texture. It may be frozen without turning or in the usual way. A similar  mixture is used in some of the recipes of the more complicated frozen  desserts given later. Fruits and nuts may be used in the preparation of  frozen custard to procure variety. During the season when eggs are  expensive, this dessert is a rather extravagant one, so that from the  standpoint of economy it should be made in the spring and summer.    78. PLAIN FROZEN CUSTARD.--If a frozen dessert that is easily made is  desired, plain frozen custard should be tried. The accompanying recipe  gives directions for custard"]]]
