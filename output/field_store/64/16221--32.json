Once upon a time, then, as we have read in the ancient histories of the  Cypriotes, there was in the island of Cyprus a very great noble named  Aristippus, a man rich in all worldly goods beyond all other of his  countrymen, and who might have deemed himself incomparably blessed, but  for a single sore affliction that Fortune had allotted him. Which was  that among his sons he had one, the best grown and handsomest of them  all, that was well-nigh a hopeless imbecile. His true name was Galesus;  but, as neither his tutor's pains, nor his father's coaxing or  chastisement, nor any other method had availed to imbue him with any  tincture of letters or manners, but he still remained gruff and savage of  voice, and in his bearing liker to a beast than to a man, all, as in  derision, were wont to call him Cimon, which in their language signifies  the same as \"bestione\" (brute)(1) in ours. The father, grieved beyond  measure to see his son's life thus blighted, and having abandoned all  hope of his recovery, nor caring to have the cause of his mortification  ever before his eyes, bade him betake him to the farm, and there keep  with his husbandmen. To Cimon the change was very welcome, because the  manners and habits of the uncouth hinds were more to his taste than those  of the citizens. So to the farm Cimon hied him, and addressed himself to  the work thereof; and being thus employed, he chanced one afternoon as he  passed, staff on shoulder, from one domain to another, to enter a  plantation, the like of which for beauty there was not in those parts,  and which was then--for 'twas the month of May--a mass of greenery; and,  as he traversed it, he came, as Fortune was pleased to guide him, to a  meadow girt in with trees exceeding tall, and having in one of its  corners a fountain most fair and cool, beside which he espied a most  beautiful girl lying asleep on the green grass, clad only in a vest of  such fine stuff that it scarce in any measure veiled the whiteness of her  flesh, and below the waist nought but an apron most white and fine of  texture; and likewise at her feet there slept two women and a man, her  slaves. No sooner did Cimon catch sight of her, than, as if he had never  before seen form of woman, he stopped short, and leaning on his cudgel,  regarded her intently, saying never a word, and lost in admiration. And  in his rude soul, which, despite a thousand lessons, had hitherto  remained impervious to every delight that belongs to urbane life, he felt  the awakening of an idea, that bade his gross and coarse mind  acknowledge, that this girl was the fairest creature that had ever been  seen by mortal eye. And thereupon he began to distinguish her several  parts, praising her hair, which shewed to him as gold, her brow, her nose  and mouth, her throat and arms, and above all her bosom, which was as yet  but in bud, and as he gazed, he changed of a sudden from a husbandman  into a judge of beauty, and desired of all things to see her eyes, which  the weight of her deep slumber kept close shut, and many a time he would  fain have awakened her, that he might see them. But so much fairer seemed  she to him than any other woman that he had seen, that he doubted she  must be a goddess; and as he was not so devoid of sense but that he  deemed things divine more worthy of reverence than things mundane, he  forbore, and waited until she should awake of her own accord; and though  he found the delay overlong, yet, enthralled by so unwonted a delight, he  knew not how to be going. However, after he had tarried a long while, it  so befell that Iphigenia--such was the girl's name--her slaves still  sleeping, awoke, and raised her head, and opened her eyes, and seeing  Cimon standing before her, leaning on his staff, was not a little  surprised, and said:--\"Cimon, what seekest thou in this wood at this  hour?\" For Cimon she knew well, as indeed did almost all the  country-side, by reason alike of his uncouth appearance as of the rank  and wealth of his father. To Iphigenia's question he answered never a  word; but as soon as her eyes were open, nought could he do but intently  regard them, for it seemed to him that a soft influence emanated from  them, which filled his soul with a delight that he had never before  known. Which the girl marking began to misdoubt that by so fixed a  scrutiny his boorish temper might be prompted to some act that should  cause her dishonour: wherefore she roused her women, and got up,  saying:--\"Keep thy distance, Cimon, in God's name.\" Whereto Cimon made  answer:--\"I will come with thee.\" And, albeit the girl refused his  escort, being still in fear of him, she could not get quit of him; but he  attended her home; after which he hied him straight to his father's  house, and announced that he was minded on no account to go back to the  farm: which intelligence was far from welcome to his father and kinsmen;  but nevertheless they suffered him to stay, and waited to see what might  be the reason of his change of mind. So Cimon, whose heart, closed to all  teaching, love's shaft, sped by the beauty of Iphigenia, had penetrated,  did now graduate in wisdom with such celerity as to astonish his father  and kinsmen, and all that knew him. He began by requesting his father to  let him go clad in the like apparel, and with, in all respects, the like  personal equipment as his brothers: which his father very gladly did.  Mixing thus with the gallants, and becoming familiar with the manners  proper to gentlemen, and especially to lovers, he very soon, to the  exceeding great wonder of all, not only acquired the rudiments of  letters, but waxed most eminent among the philosophic wits. After which  (for no other cause than the love he bore to Iphigenia) he not only  modulated his gruff and boorish voice to a degree of smoothness suitable  to urbane life, but made himself accomplished in singing and music; in  riding also and in all matters belonging to war, as well by sea as by  land, he waxed most expert and hardy. And in sum (that I go not about to  enumerate each of his virtues in detail) he had not completed the fourth  year from the day of his first becoming enamoured before he was grown the  most gallant, and courteous, ay, and the most perfect in particular  accomplishments, of the young cavaliers that were in the island of  Cyprus. What then, gracious ladies, are we to say of Cimon? Verily nought  else but that the high faculties, with which Heaven had endowed his noble  soul, invidious Fortune had bound with the strongest of cords, and  circumscribed within a very narrow region of his heart; all which cords  Love, more potent than Fortune, burst and brake in pieces; and then with  the might, wherewith he awakens dormant powers, he brought them forth of  the cruel obfuscation, in which they lay, into clear light, plainly  shewing thereby, whence he may draw, and whither he may guide, by his  beams the souls that are subject to his sway.    Now, albeit by his love for Iphigenia Cimon was betrayed, as young lovers  very frequently are, into some peccadillos, yet Aristippus, reflecting  that it had turned him from a booby into a man, not only bore patiently  with him, but exhorted him with all his heart to continue steadfast in  his love. And Cimon, who still refused to be called Galesus, because  'twas as Cimon that Iphigenia had first addressed him, being desirous to  accomplish his desire by honourable means, did many a time urge his suit  upon her father, Cipseus, that he would give her him to wife: whereto  Cipseus always made the same answer, to wit, that he had promised her to  Pasimondas, a young Rhodian noble, and was not minded to break faith with  him. However, the time appointed for Iphigenia's wedding being come, and  the bridegroom having sent for her, Cimon said to himself:--'Tis now for  me to shew thee, O Iphigenia, how great is my love for thee: 'tis by thee  that I am grown a man, nor doubt I, if I shall have thee, that I shall  wax more glorious than a god, and verily thee will I have, or die. Having  so said, he privily enlisted in his cause certain young nobles that were  his friends, and secretly fitted out a ship with all equipment meet for  combat, and put to sea on the look-out for the ship that was to bear  Iphigenia to Rhodes and her husband. And at length, when her father had  done lavishing honours upon her husband's friends, Iphigenia embarked,  and, the mariners shaping their course for Rhodes, put to sea. Cimon was  on the alert, and overhauled them the very next day, and standing on his  ship's prow shouted amain to those that were aboard Iphigenia's  ship:--\"Bring to; strike sails, or look to be conquered and sunk in the  sea.\" Then, seeing that the enemy had gotten their arms above deck, and  were making ready to make a fight of it, he followed up his words by  casting a grapnel upon the poop of the Rhodians, who were making great  way; and having thus made their poop fast to his prow, he sprang, fierce  as a lion, reckless whether he were followed or no, on to the Rhodians'  ship, making, as it were, no account of them, and animated by love,  hurled himself, sword in hand, with prodigious force among the enemy, and  cutting and thrusting right and left, slaughtered them like sheep;  insomuch that the Rhodians, marking the fury of his onset, threw down  their arms, and as with one voice did all acknowledge themselves his  prisoners. To whom Cimon:--\"Gallants,\" quoth he, \"'twas neither lust of  booty nor enmity to you that caused me to put out from Cyprus to attack  you here with force of arms on the high seas. Moved was I thereto by that  which to gain is to me a matter great indeed, which peaceably to yield me  is to you but a slight matter; for 'tis even Iphigenia, whom more than  aught else I love; whom, as I might not have her of her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13111"],[0,"The Brain and the Voice in Speech and Song (#3)"],[1,"the oboe are examples of  reed instruments, in which the reed does not alter but by means of stops  the length of the column of air in the resonating pipe varies and  determines the pitch of the fundamental note. The organ-pipe with the  vibrating tongue of metal serving as the reed is perhaps the nearest  approach to the vocal organ; but here again it is the length of the pipe  which determines the pitch of the note.    The vocal instrument may be said to consist of three parts: (1) the  bellows; (2) the membranous reed contained in the larynx, which by the  actions of groups of muscles can be altered in tension and thus variation  in pitch determined; (3) the resonator, which consists of the mouth, the  throat, the larynx, the nose, and air sinuses contained in the bones of the  skull, also the windpipe, the bronchial tubes, and the lungs. The main and  important part of the resonator, however, is situated above the glottis  (the opening between the vocal cords, _vide_ fig. 6), and it is capable of  only slight variations in length and of many and important variations in  form. In the production of musical sounds its chief influence is upon the  quality of the overtones and therefore upon the timbre of the voice;  moreover, the movable structures of the resonator, the lower jaw, the lips,  the tongue, the soft palate, can, by changing the form of the resonator,  not only impress upon the sound waves particular overtones as they issue  from the mouth, but simultaneously can effect the combination of vowels and  consonants with the formation of syllables, the combination of syllables  with the formation of words, and the combination of words with the  formation of articulate language. The reed portion of the instrument acting  alone can only express emotional feeling; the resonator, the effector of  articulate speech, is the instrument of intelligence, will, and feeling. It  must not, however, be thought that the vocal instrument consists of two  separately usable parts, for phonation (except in the whispered voice)  always accompanies articulation.    In speech, and more especially in singing, there is an art of breathing.  Ordinary inspiration and expiration necessary for the oxygenation of the  blood is performed automatically and unconsciously. But in singing the  respiratory apparatus is used like the bellows of a musical instrument, and  it is controlled and directed by the will; the art of breathing properly is  fundamental for the proper production of the singing voice and the speaking  voice of the orator. It is necessary always to maintain in the lungs, which  act as the bellows, a sufficient reserve of air to finish a phrase;  therefore when the opportunity arises it is desirable to take in as much  air as possible through the nostrils, and without any apparent effort; the  expenditure of the air in the lungs must be controlled and regulated by the  power of the will in such a manner as to produce efficiency in loudness  with economy of expenditure. It must be remembered, moreover, that mere  loudness of sound does not necessarily imply carrying power of the voice,  either when speaking or singing. Carrying power, as we shall see later,  depends as much upon the proper use of the resonator as upon the force of  expulsion of the air by the bellows. Again, a soft note, especially an  aspirate, owing to the vocal chink being widely opened, may be the cause of  an expenditure of a larger amount of air than a loud-sounding note.  Observations upon anencephalous monsters (infants born without the great  brain) show that breathing and crying can occur without the cerebral  hemispheres; moreover, Goltz's dog, in which all the brain had been removed  except the stem and base, was able to bark, growl, and snarl, indicating  that the primitive function of the vocal instrument can be performed by the  lower centres of the brain situated in the medulla oblongata. But the  animal growled and barked when the attendant, who fed it daily, approached  to give it food, which was a clear indication that the bark and growl had  lost both its affective and cognitive significance; it was, indeed, a  purely automatic reflex action. It was dependent upon a stimulus arousing  an excitation in an instinctive automatic nervous mechanism in the medulla  oblongata and spinal cord presiding over synergic groups of muscles  habitually brought into action for this simplest form of vocalisation,  connected with the primitive emotion of anger.    I will now consider at greater length each part of the vocal instrument.          I. THE BELLOWS      [Illustration: Fig 1]    [Description: FIG. 1.--Front view of the thorax showing the breastbone, to  which on either side are attached the (shaded) rib cartilages. The  remainder of the thoracic cage is formed by the ribs attached behind to the  spine, which is only seen below. The lungs are represented filling the  chest cavity, except a little to the left of the breastbone, below where  the pericardium is shown (black). It can be seen that the ribs slope  forwards and downwards, and that they increase in length from above  downwards, so that if elevated by the muscles attached to them, they will  tend to push forward the elastic cartilages and breastbone and so increase  the antero-posterior diameter of the chest; moreover, the ribs being  elastic will tend to give a little at the angle, and so the lateral  diameter of the chest will be increased.]    The bellows consists of the lungs enclosed in the movable thorax. The  latter may be likened to a cage; it is formed by the spine behind and the  ribs, which are attached by cartilages to the breastbone (sternum) in front  (_vide_ fig. 1). The ribs and cartilages, as the diagram shows, form a  series of hoops which increase in length from above downwards; moreover,  they slope obliquely downwards and inwards (_vide_ fig. 2). The ribs are  jointed behind to the vertebrae in such a way that muscles attached to them  can, by shortening, elevate them; the effect is that the longer ribs are  raised, and pushing forward the breastbone and cartilages, the thoracic  cage enlarges from before back; but being elastic, the hoops will give a  little and cause some expansion from side to side; moreover, when the ribs  are raised, each one is rotated on its axis in such a way that the lower  border tends towards eversion; the total effect of this rotation is a  lateral expansion of the whole thorax. Between the ribs and the cartilages  the space is filled by the intercostal muscles (_vide_ fig. 2), the action  of which, in conjunction with other muscles, is to elevate the ribs. It is,  however, unnecessary to enter into anatomical details, and describe all  those muscles which elevate and rotate the ribs, and thereby cause  enlargement of the thorax in its antero-posterior and lateral diameters.  There is, however, one muscle which forms the floor of the thoracic cage  called the diaphragm that requires more than a passing notice (_vide_ fig.  2), inasmuch as it is the most effective agent in the expansion of the  chest. It consists of a central tendinous portion, above which lies the  heart, contained in its bag or pericardium; on either side attached to the  central tendon on the one hand and to the spine behind, to the last rib  laterally, and to the cartilages of the lowest six ribs anteriorly, is a  sheet of muscle fibres which form on either side of the chest a dome-like  partition between the lungs and the abdominal cavity (_vide_ fig. 2). The  phrenic nerve arises from the spinal cord in the upper cervical region and  descends through the neck and chest to the diaphragm; it is therefore a  special nerve of respiration. There are two--one on each side supplying the  two sheets of muscle fibres. When innervation currents flow down these  nerves the two muscular halves of the diaphragm contract, and the floor of  the chest on either side descends; thus the vertical diameter increases.  Now the elastic lungs are covered with a smooth pleura which is reflected  from them on to the inner side of the wall of the thorax, leaving no space  between; consequently when the chest expands in all three directions the  elastic lungs expand correspondingly. But when either voluntarily or  automatically the nerve currents that cause contraction of the muscles of  expansion cease, the elastic structures of the lungs and thorax, including  the muscles, recoil, the diaphragm ascends, and the ribs by the force of  gravity tend to fall into the position of rest. During expansion of the  chest a negative pressure is established in the air passages and air flows  into them from without. In contraction of the chest there is a positive  pressure in the air passages, and air is expelled; in normal quiet  breathing an ebb and flow of air takes place rhythmically and  subconsciously; thus in the ordinary speaking of conversation we do not  require to exercise any voluntary effort in controlling the breathing, but  the orator and more especially the singer uses his knowledge and experience  in the voluntary control of his breath, and he is thus enabled to use his  vocal instrument in the most effective manner.

The  dome-like shape of the diaphragm is seen, and it can be easily understood  that if the central tendon is fixed and the sheet of muscle fibres on  either side contracts, the floor of the chest on either side will flatten,  allowing the lungs to expand vertically.
