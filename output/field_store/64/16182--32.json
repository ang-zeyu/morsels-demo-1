[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12422"],[0,"Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation: 1838-1839 (#3)"],[1,"of Mr. ----'s people. The  latter subject is, I know, one sufficiently interesting in itself to you,  and I shall not scruple to impart all the reflections which may occur to  me relative to their state during my stay here, where enquiry into their  mode of existence will form my chief occupation, and, necessarily also,  the staple commodity of my letters. I purpose, while I reside here,  keeping a sort of journal, such as Monk Lewis wrote during his visit to  his West India plantations. I wish I had any prospect of rendering my  diary as interesting and amusing to you as his was to me.    In taking my first walk on the island, I directed my steps towards the  rice mill, a large building on the banks of the river, within a few yards  of the house we occupy. Is it not rather curious that Miss Martineau  should have mentioned the erection of a steam mill for threshing rice  somewhere in the vicinity of Charleston as a singular novelty, likely to  form an era in Southern agriculture, and to produce the most desirable  changes in the system of labour by which it is carried on? Now, on this  estate alone, there are three threshing mills--one worked by steam, one by  the tide, and one by horses; there are two private steam mills on  plantations adjacent to ours, and a public one at Savannah, where the  planters who have none on their own estates are in the habit of sending  their rice to be threshed at a certain percentage; these have all been in  operation for some years, and I therefore am at a loss to understand what  made her hail the erection of the one at Charleston as likely to produce  such immediate and happy results. By the bye--of the misstatements, or  rather mistakes, for they are such, in her books, with regard to certain  facts--her only disadvantage in acquiring information was not by any means  that natural infirmity on which the periodical press, both here and in  England, has commented with so much brutality. She had the misfortune to  possess, too, that unsuspecting reliance upon the truth of others which  they are apt to feel who themselves hold truth most sacred: and this was  a sore disadvantage to her in a country where I have heard it myself  repeatedly asserted--and, what is more, much gloried in--that she was  purposely misled by the persons to whom she addressed her enquiries, who  did not scruple to disgrace themselves by imposing in the grossest manner  upon her credulity and anxiety to obtain information. It is a knowledge of  this very shameful proceeding, which has made me most especially anxious  to avoid _fact hunting_. I might fill my letters to you with accounts  received from others, but as I am aware of the risk which I run in so  doing, I shall furnish you with no details but those which come under my  own immediate observation. To return to the rice mill: it is worked by a  steam-engine of thirty horse power, and besides threshing great part of  our own rice, is kept constantly employed by the neighbouring planters,  who send their grain to it in preference to the more distant mill at  Savannah, paying, of course, the same percentage, which makes it a very  profitable addition to the estate. Immediately opposite to this building  is a small shed, which they call the cook's shop, and where the daily  allowance of rice and corn grits of the people is boiled and distributed  to them by an old woman, whose special business this is. There are four  settlements or villages (or, as the negroes call them, camps) on the  island, consisting of from ten to twenty houses, and to each settlement is  annexed a cook's shop with capacious cauldrons, and the oldest wife of  the settlement for officiating priestess. Pursuing my walk along the  river's bank, upon an artificial dyke, sufficiently high and broad to  protect the fields from inundation by the ordinary rising of the tide--for  the whole island is below high water mark--I passed the blacksmith's and  cooper's shops. At the first all the common iron implements of husbandry  or household use for the estate are made, and at the latter all the rice  barrels necessary for the crop, besides tubs and buckets large and small  for the use of the people, and cedar tubs of noble dimensions and  exceedingly neat workmanship, for our own household purposes. The  fragrance of these when they are first made, as well as their ample size,  renders them preferable as dressing-room furniture, in my opinion, to all  the china foot-tubs that ever came out of Staffordshire. After this I got  out of the vicinity of the settlement, and pursued my way along a narrow  dyke--the river on one hand, and on the other a slimy, poisonous-looking  swamp, all rattling with sedges of enormous height, in which one might  lose one's way as effectually as in a forest of oaks. Beyond this, the low  rice-fields, all clothed in their rugged stubble, divided by dykes into  monotonous squares, a species of prospect by no means beautiful to the  mere lover of the picturesque. The only thing that I met with to attract  my attention was a most beautiful species of ivy, the leaf longer and more  graceful than that of the common English creeper, glittering with the  highest varnish, delicately veined, and of a rich brown green, growing in  profuse garlands from branch to branch of some stunted evergreen bushes  which border the dyke, and which the people call salt-water bush. My walks  are rather circumscribed, inasmuch as the dykes are the only promenades.  On all sides of these lie either the marshy rice-fields, the brimming  river, or the swampy patches of yet unreclaimed forest, where the huge  cypress trees and exquisite evergreen undergrowth spring up from a  stagnant sweltering pool, that effectually forbids the foot of the  explorer.    As I skirted one of these thickets to-day, I stood still to admire the  beauty of the shrubbery. Every shade of green, every variety of form,  every degree of varnish, and all in full leaf and beauty in the very depth  of winter. The stunted dark-coloured oak; the magnolia bay (like our own  culinary and fragrant bay), which grows to a very great size; the wild  myrtle, a beautiful and profuse shrub, rising to a height of six, eight,  and ten feet, and branching on all sides in luxuriant tufted fullness;  most beautiful of all, that pride of the South, the magnolia grandiflora,  whose lustrous dark green perfect foliage would alone render it an object  of admiration, without the queenly blossom whose colour, size, and perfume  are unrivalled in the whole vegetable kingdom. This last magnificent  creature grows to the size of a forest tree in these swamps, but seldom  adorns a high or dry soil, or suffers itself to be successfully  transplanted. Under all these the spiked palmetto forms an impenetrable  covert, and from glittering graceful branch to branch hang garlands of  evergreen creepers, on which the mocking-birds are swinging and singing  even now; while I, bethinking me of the pinching cold that is at this hour  tyrannising over your region, look round on this strange scene--on these  green woods, this unfettered river, and sunny sky--and feel very much like  one in another planet from yourself.    The profusion of birds here is one thing that strikes me as curious,  coming from the vicinity of Philadelphia, where even the robin redbreast,  held sacred by the humanity of all other Christian people, is not safe  from the _gunning_ prowess of the unlicensed sportsmen of your free  country. The negroes (of course) are not allowed the use of firearms, and  their very simply constructed traps do not do much havoc among the  feathered hordes that haunt their rice-fields. Their case is rather a hard  one, as partridges, snipes, and the most delicious wild ducks abound here,  and their allowance of rice and Indian meal would not be the worse for  such additions. No day passes that I do not, in the course of my walk, put  up a number of the land birds, and startle from among the gigantic sedges  the long-necked water-fowl by dozens. It arouses the killing propensity in  me most dreadfully, and I really entertain serious thoughts of learning to  use a gun, for the mere pleasure of destroying these pretty birds as they  whirr from their secret coverts close beside my path. How strong an  instinct of animal _humanity_ this is, and how strange if one be more  strange than another. Reflection rebukes it almost instantaneously, and  yet for the life of me I cannot help wishing I had a fowling-piece  whenever I put up a covey of these creatures; though I suppose, if one  were brought bleeding and maimed to me, I should begin to cry, and be very  pathetic, after the fashion of Jacques. However, one must live, you know;  and here our living consists very mainly of wild ducks, wild geese, wild  turkeys, and venison. Nor, perhaps, can one imagine the universal doom  overtaking a creature with less misery than in the case of the bird who,  in the very moment of his triumphant soaring, is brought dead to the  ground. I should like to bargain for such a finis myself, amazingly, I  know; and have always thought that the death I should prefer would be to  break my neck off the back of my horse at a full gallop on a fine day. Of  course a bad shot should be hung--a man who shatters his birds' wings and  legs; if I undertook the trade, I would learn of some Southern duellist,  and always shoot my bird through the head or heart--as an expert murderer  knows how. Besides these birds of which we make our prey, there are others  that prey upon their own fraternity. Hawks of every sort and size wheel  their steady rounds above the rice-fields; and the great turkey  buzzards--those most unsightly carrion birds--spread their broad black  wings, and soar over the river like so many mock eagles. I do not know  that I ever saw any winged creature of so forbidding an aspect as these  same turkey buzzards; their heavy flight, their awkward gait, their  bald-looki"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12423"],[0,"A Short History of the United States for School Use (#3)"],[1," northern and western shores of  the Gulf of Mexico. One of them discovered the mouth of the Mississippi.  Others of them stole Indians and carried them to the islands to work as  slaves. The most famous of them all was Cortez. In 1519 he conquered  Mexico after a thrilling campaign and found there great store of gold  and silver. This discovery led to more expeditions and to the  exploration of the southern half of the United States.    [Sidenote: Coronado sets out from Mexico, 1540.]    [Sidenote: The pueblo Indians. _Source Book_, 6.]    13. Coronado in the Southwest, 1540-42.--In 1540 Coronado set out  from the Spanish towns on the Gulf of California to seek for more gold  and silver. For seventy-three days he journeyed northward until he came  to the pueblos (pweb'-lo) of the Southwest. These pueblos were huge  buildings of stone and sun-dried clay. Some of them were large enough  to shelter three hundred Indian families. Pueblos are still to be seen  in Arizona and New Mexico, and the Indians living in them even to this  day tell stories of Coronado's coming and of his cruelty. There was  hardly any gold and silver in these \"cities,\" so a great grief fell upon  Coronado and his comrades.    [Illustration: _By permission of the Bureau of Ethnology._ THE PUEBLO OF  ZUNI (FROM A PHOTOGRAPH).]    [Sidenote: Coronado finds the Great Plains.]    14. The Great Plains.--Soon, however, a new hope came to the Spaniards,  for an Indian told them that far away in the north there really was a  golden land. Onward rode Coronado and a body of picked men. They crossed  vast plains where there were no mountains to guide them. For more than a  thousand miles they rode on until they reached eastern Kansas.  Everywhere they found great herds of buffaloes, or wild cows, as they  called them. They also met the Indians of the Plains. Unlike the Indians  of the pueblos, these Indians lived in tents made of buffalo hides  stretched upon poles. Everywhere there were plains, buffaloes, and  Indians. Nowhere was there gold or silver. Broken hearted, Coronado and  his men rode southward to their old homes in Mexico.    [Sidenote: De Soto in Florida, 1539. _Explorers_, 119-138.]    [Sidenote: De Soto crosses the Mississippi.]    15. De Soto in the Southeast, 1539-43.--In 1539 a Spanish army  landed at Tampa Bay, on the western coast of Florida. The leader of this  army was De Soto, one of the conquerors of Peru. He \"was very fond of  the sport of killing Indians\" and was also greedy for gold and silver.  From Tampa he marched northward to South Carolina and then marched  southwestward to Mobile Bay. There he had a dreadful time; for the  Indians burned his camp and stores and killed many of his men. From  Mobile he wandered northwestward until he came to a great river. It was  the Mississippi, and was so wide that a man standing on one bank could  not see a man standing on the opposite bank. Some of De Soto's men  penetrated westward nearly to the line of Coronado's march. But the two  bands did not meet. De Soto died and was buried in the Mississippi.  Those of his men who still lived built a few boats and managed to reach  the Spanish settlements in Mexico.    [Sidenote: Other Spanish explorers.]    [Sidenote: Attempts at settlement.]    16. Other Spanish Expeditions.--Many other Spanish explorers  visited the shores of the United States before 1550. Some sailed along  the Pacific coast; others sailed along the Atlantic coast. The Spaniards  also made several attempts to found settlements both on the northern  shore of the Gulf of Mexico and on Chesapeake Bay. But all these early  attempts ended in failure. In 1550 there were no Spaniards on the  continent within the present limits of the United States, except  possibly a few traders and missionaries in the Southwest.

Early French Voyages, 1524-36.--The first French expedition to  America was led by an Italian named Verrazano (Ver-rae-tsae'-no), but he  sailed in the service of Francis I, King of France. He made his voyage  in 1524 and sailed along the coast from the Cape Fear River to Nova  Scotia. He entered New York harbor and spent two weeks in Newport  harbor. He reported that the country was \"as pleasant as it is possible  to conceive.\" The next French expedition was led by a Frenchman named  Cartier (Kar'-tya'). In 1534 he visited the Gulf of St. Lawrence. In  1535 he sailed up the St. Lawrence River to Montreal. But before he  could get out of the river again the ice formed about his ships. He and  his crew had to pass the winter there. They suffered terribly, and  twenty-four of them perished of cold and sickness. In the spring of 1536  the survivors returned to France.    [Sidenote: Ribault explores the Carolina coasts, 1562.]    [Sidenote: French colonists in Carolina. _Explorers_, 149-156.]    18. The French in Carolina, 1562.--The French next explored the  shores of the Carolinas. Ribault (Re'-bo') was the name of their  commander. Sailing southward from Carolina, he discovered a beautiful  river and called it the River of May. But we know it by its Spanish name  of St. Johns. He left a few men on the Carolina coast and returned to  France. A year or more these men remained. Then wearying of their life  in the wilderness, they built a crazy boat with sails of shirts and  sheets and steered for France. Soon their water gave out and then their  food. Finally, almost dead, they were rescued by an English ship.    [Sidenote: French colonists in Florida.]    19. The French in Florida, 1564-65.--While these Frenchmen were  slowly drifting across the Atlantic, a great French expedition was  sailing to Carolina. Finding Ribault's men gone, the new colony was  planted on the banks of the River of May. Soon the settlers ate up all  the food they had brought with them. Then they bought food from the  Indians, giving them toys and old clothes in exchange. Some of the  colonists rebelled. They seized a vessel and sailed away to plunder the  Spaniards in the West Indies. They told the Spaniards of the colony on  the River of May, and the Spaniards resolved to destroy it.    [Sidenote: Spaniards and Frenchmen.]    [Sidenote: End of the French settlement, 1565. _Explorers_, 159-166.]    20. The Spaniards in Florida, 1565.--For this purpose the Spaniards  sent out an expedition under Menendez (Ma-nen'-deth). He sailed to the  River of May and found Ribault there with a French fleet. So he turned  southward, and going ashore founded St. Augustine. Ribault followed, but  a terrible storm drove his whole fleet ashore south of St. Augustine.  Menendez then marched over land to the French colony. He surprised the  colonists and killed nearly all of them. Then going back to St.  Augustine, he found Ribault and his shipwrecked sailors and killed  nearly all of them. In this way ended the French attempts to found a  colony in Carolina and Florida. But St. Augustine remained, and is  to-day the oldest town on the mainland of the United States.          CHAPTER 3      PIONEERS OF ENGLAND    [Sidenote: Hawkins's voyages, 1562-67.]    21. Sir John Hawkins.--For many years after Cabot's voyage  Englishmen were too busy at home to pay much attention to distant  expeditions. But in Queen Elizabeth's time English seamen began to sail  to America. The first of them to win a place in history was John  Hawkins. He carried cargoes of negro slaves from Africa to the West  Indies and sold them to the Spanish planters. On his third voyage he was  basely attacked by the Spaniards and lost four of his five ships.  Returning home, he became one of the leading men of Elizabeth's little  navy and fought most gallantly for his country.    [Illustration: SIR FRANCIS DRAKE.]    [Sidenote: Drake on the California coast, 1577-78. _Source-Book_, 9.]    22. Sir Francis Drake.--A greater and a more famous man was  Hawkins's cousin, Francis Drake. He had been with Hawkins on his third  voyage and had come to hate Spaniards most vigorously. In 1577 he made a  famous voyage round the world. Steering through the Straits of Magellan,  he plundered the Spanish towns on the western coasts of South America.  At one place his sailors went on shore and found a man sound asleep.  Near him were four bars of silver. \"We took the silver and left the  man,\" wrote the old historian of the voyage. Drake also captured vessels  loaded with gold and silver and pearls. Sailing northward, he repaired  his ship, the _Pelican_, on the coast of California, and returned home  by the way of the Cape of Good Hope.    [Sidenote: Ralegh and his colonies. _Eggleston_, 13-17; _Explorers_,  177-189.]    23. Sir Walter Ralegh.--Still another famous Englishman of  Elizabeth's time was Walter Ralegh. He never saw the coasts of the  United States, but his name is rightly connected with our history,  because he tried again and again to found colonies on our shores. In  1584 he sent Amadas and Barlowe to explore the Atlantic seashore of  North America. Their reports were so favorable that he sent a strong  colony to settle on Roanoke Island in Virginia, as he named that region.  But the settlers soon became unhappy because they found no gold. Then,  too, their food began to fail, and Drake, happening along, took them  back to England.    [Sidenote: Ralegh's last attempt, 1587. _Explorers_, 189-200.]    24. The \"Lost Colony,\" 1587.--Ralegh made still one more attempt to  found a colony in Virginia. But the fate of this colony was most  dreadful. For the settlers entirely disappeared,--men, women, and  children. Among the lost was little Virginia Dare, the first English  child born in America. No one really knows what became of these people.  But the Indians told the later settlers of Jamestown that they had been  killed by the savages.    [Sidenote: Ruin of Spain's sea-power. _English History for"]]]
