The first is the taste,        Which is meagre and hollow, but crisp:    Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,        With a flavour of Will-o-the-wisp.\"      \"Its habit of getting up late you'll agree        That it carries too far, when I say    That it frequently breakfasts at five-o'clock tea,        And dines on the following day.\"      \"The third is its slowness in taking a jest.        Should you happen to venture on one,    It will sigh like a thing that is greatly distressed;        And it always looks grave at a pun.\"      \"The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,        Which it constantly carries about,    And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes--        A sentiment open to doubt.\"      \"The fifth is ambition. It next will be right        To describe each particular batch;    Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,        From those that have whiskers, and scratch.\"      \"For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm,        Yet I feel it my duty to say    Some are Boojums--\" The Bellman broke off in alarm,        For the Baker had fainted away.      They roused him with muffins--they roused him with ice--        They roused him with mustard and cress--    They roused him with jam and judicious advice--        They set him conundrums to guess.      When at length he sat up and was able to speak,        His sad story he offered to tell;    And the Bellman cried, \"Silence! Not even a shriek!\"        And excitedly tingled his bell.      \"My father and mother were honest, though poor--\"        \"Skip all that!\" cried the Bellman in haste,    \"If it once becomes dark, there's no chance of a Snark,        We have hardly a minute to waste!\"      \"I skip forty years,\" said the Baker, in tears,        \"And proceed without further remark    To the day when you took me aboard of your ship        To help you in hunting the Snark.\"      \"You may seek it with thimbles--and seek it with care;        You may hunt it with forks and hope;    You may threaten its life with a railway-share;        You may charm it with smiles and soap--\"      \"I said it in Hebrew--I said it in Dutch--        I said it in German and Greek;    But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much)        That English is what you speak!\"      \"The thing can be done,\" said the Butcher, \"I think        The thing must be done, I am sure.    The thing shall be done! Bring me paper and ink,        The best there is time to procure.\"      So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not,        As he wrote with a pen in each hand,    And explained all the while in a popular style        Which the Beaver could well understand.      \"Taking Three as the subject to reason about--        A convenient number to state--    We add Seven and Ten and then multiply out        By One Thousand diminished by Eight.\"      \"The result we proceed to divide, as you see,        By Nine Hundred and Ninety and Two;    Then subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be        Exactly and perfectly true.\"      \"As to temper, the Jubjub's a desperate bird,        Since it lives in perpetual passion:    Its taste in costume is entirely absurd--        It is ages ahead of the fashion.\"      \"Its flavor when cooked is more exquisite far        Than mutton or oysters or eggs:    (Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar,        And some, in mahogany kegs.)\"      \"You boil it in sawdust; you salt it in glue:        You condense it with locusts and tape;    Still keeping one principal object in view--        To preserve its symmetrical shape.\"      The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day,        But he felt that the Lesson must end,    And he wept with delight in attempting to say        He considered the Beaver his friend.                              _Lewis Carroll_.          _SYLVIE AND BRUNO_      He thought he saw a Banker's clerk        Descending from the 'bus;    He looked again, and found it was        A Hippopotamus.    \"If this should stay to dine,\" he said,        \"There won't be much for us!\"      He thought he saw an Albatross        That fluttered round the lamp:    He looked again, and found it was        A Penny-Postage-Stamp.    \"You'd best be getting home,\" he said;        \"The nights are very damp!\"      He thought he saw a Coach-and-Four        That stood beside his bed:    He looked again, and found it was        A Bear without a Head.    \"Poor thing,\" he said, \"poor silly thing!        It's waiting to be fed!\"      He thought he saw a Kangaroo        That worked a coffee-mill:    He looked again, and found it was        A Vegetable-Pill.    \"Were I to swallow this,\" he said,        \"I should be very ill!\"      He thought he saw a Rattlesnake        That questioned him in Greek:    He looked again, and found it was        The Middle of Next Week.    \"The one thing I regret,\" he said,        \"Is that it cannot speak!\"                              _Lewis Carroll_.          GENTLE ALICE BROWN      It was a robber's daughter, and her name was Alice Brown.    Her father was the terror of a small Italian town;    Her mother was a foolish, weak, but amiable old thing;    But it isn't of her parents that I'm going for to sing.      As Alice was a-sitting at her window-sill one day,    A beautiful young gentleman he chanced to pass that way;    She cast her eyes upon him, and he looked so good and true,    That she thought, \"I could be happy with a gentleman like you!\"      And every morning passed her house that cream of gentlemen,    She knew she might expect him at a quarter unto ten,    A sorter in the Custom-house, it was his daily road    (The Custom-house was fifteen minutes' walk from her abode.)      But Alice was a pious girl, who knew it wasn't wise    To look at strange young sorters with expressive purple eyes;    So she sought the village priest to whom her family confessed,    The priest by whom their little sins were carefully assessed.      \"Oh, holy father,\"  Alice said, \"'twould grieve you, would it not?    To discover that I was a most disreputable lot!    Of all unhappy sinners I'm the most unhappy one!\"    The padre said, \"Whatever have you been and gone and done?\"      \"I have helped mamma to steal a little kiddy from its dad,    I've assisted dear papa in cutting up a little lad.    I've planned a little burglary and forged a little check,    And slain a little baby for the coral on its neck!\"      The worthy pastor heaved a sigh, and dropped a silent tear--    And said, \"You mustn't judge yourself too heavily, my dear--    It's wrong to murder babies, little corals for to fleece;    But sins like these one expiates at half-a-crown apiece.\"      \"Girls will be girls--you're very young, and flighty in your mind;    Old heads upon young shoulders we must not expect to find:    We mustn't be too hard upon these little girlish tricks--    Let's see--five crimes at half-a-crown--exactly twelve-and-six.\"      \"Oh, father,\" little Alice cried, \"your kindness makes me weep,    You do these little things for me so singularly cheap--    Your thoughtful liberality I never can forget;    But O there is another crime I haven't mentioned yet!\"      \"A pleasant-looking gentleman, with pretty purple eyes,    I've noticed at my window, as I've sat a-catching flies;    He passes by it every day as certain as can be--    I blush to say I've winked at him and he has winked at me!\"      \"For shame,\" said Father Paul, \"my erring daughter! On my word    This is the most distressing news that I have ever heard.    Why, naughty girl, your excellent papa has pledged your hand    To a promising young robber, the lieutenant of his band!\"      \"This dreadful piece of news will pain your worthy parents so!    They are the most remunerative customers I know;    For many many years they've kept starvation from my doors,    I never knew so criminal a family as yours!\"      \"The common country folk in this insipid neighborhood    Have nothing to confess, they're so ridiculously good;    And if you marry any one respectable at all,    Why, you'll reform, and what will then become of Father Paul?\"      The worthy priest, he up and drew his cowl upon his crown,    And started off in haste to tell the news to Robber Brown;    To tell him how his daughter, who now was for marriage fit,    Had winked upon a sorter, who reciprocated it.      Good Robber Brown, he muffled up his anger pretty well,    He said, \"I have a notion, and that notion I will tell;    I will nab this gay young sorter, terrify him into fits,    And get my gentle wife to chop him into little bits.\"      \"I've studied human nature, and I know a thing or two,    Though a girl may fondly love a living gent, as many do--    A feeling of disgust upon her senses there will fall    When she looks upon his body chopped particularly small.\"      He traced that gallant sorter to a still suburban square;    He watched his opportunity and seized him unaware;    He took a life-preserver and he hit him on the head,    And Mrs. Brown dissected him before she went to bed.      And pretty little Alice grew more settled in her mind,    She nevermore was guilty of a weakness of the kind,    Until at length good Robber Brown bestowed her pretty hand    On the promising young robber, the lieutenant of his band.                              _W.S.

Since there did not exist accommodations for a safe anchorage for yachts  along the piers of the White City, we were obliged to sail back to the  Chicago Harbor. The ride on the billows of Lake Michigan, however, was  very enjoyable after the heat of the day. Fanned by the cooling  sea-breezes, which we inhaled in the fullness of delight, our eyes rested  in perfect rapture on the glorious panorama of the grounds extending  toward the lake shore. The superb structures rising vaguely and obscurely  in a shadowy expanse under the gloom of the growing twilight, were later  beautifully illuminated by uncountable electric lights; from the powerful  arc-light of 8,000 candles to the delicate incandescent lamp of  one-sixteenth candle power gleaming like tiny fire-flies in the distance.  It filled us with amazement to cogitate, that human mind and manual skill  could create a spot on earth looking so much like a conception of  paradise.    The next morning when corroborating our nerves by a hearty breakfast, Mr.  James announced to us the programme of the day which set forth that we  should witness in detail the attractions of the Midway Plaisance--a  proposal that pleased us very much.    Having again disembarked at the pier of the Exposition Grounds, the  Intramural Railway conveyed us rapidly--running with a velocity of twelve  miles an hour--to the entrance of the International Highway.    We commenced with the attractions at the right hand side--and having  passed the displays of the _Diamond Match Company_ and the _Workingmen's  Home_--the international Dress and Costume Exhibit, known as the _Congress  of Beauty,_ attracted our attention. Between forty and fifty pretty living  representatives pertaining to the fair sex of different nationalities,  races, and types were dressed in distinctive national or racial costumes.    The _California Nursery_ and _Citrus Tree Exhibit_ separated this Beauty  Show from the _Electric Scenic Theater_, which may be regarded as a  triumph of the modern progress in the electrical science. It depicted the  changes of a beautiful Swiss Alpine scenery as such are gradually  occurring from dawn till night--representing the magical and most  wonderfully realistic effects ever produced by electric lamps.    Visiting the _Libbey Glass Works_, we obtained a very clear idea of the  art of manufacturing glass--by following up the different processes of  melting, blowing, cutting, spinning, weaving etc. all of which were in  full operation in this exhibit.    In fact, the endeavor of this company to instruct the spectator in every  detail of the work--was a complete success and exceedingly satisfactory.  The ingenious construction of their magnificent building was especially  adapted to enable the daily throngs--resorting to it--to have every  opportunity for observation; and judging from what we saw, and the various  comments we heard, we should be inclined to feel that the management had  every reason to be satisfied with their splendid effort.    The artistic products manufactured solely by this company, and shown in  the diverse departments--as well as those, decorating the Crystal Art  Display Rooms--equal anything in the past and present, not excepting the  celebrated Bohemian and Venetian manufactures of world-wide fame; and  certainly the exhibition of cut glass made by the Libbey Company at this  Exposition, has established the fact, that foreign manufactures can no  longer claim to turn out the best artistic work; for truly, in that rich  and unrivaled display, the summit of clear glass making and magical  effects in cutting and polishing have been achieved.    Especially attractive were the tapestries and fabrics woven from spun  glass. This was decidedly notable in the marvelous dress woven from one  loom for the Spanish Princess Eulalia at a cost of $2,500. That these  goods also serve as a canvas does for artistic work--was evidently proved  by the sundry beautiful effects of this kind in the Crystal Art Room.--It  would be impossible to enumerate the various articles produced in this  wonderful and interesting display; but it is safe to say--the working  exhibit of the Libbey Glass Company--in their palatial and costly  structure was one of the chief features of the Midway Plaisance and the  ever memorable Columbian Exposition.    A gateway--reminding us of mediaeval times--ushered the visitor into the  _Irish Village_ and _Donegal Castle_, a representative exhibit of Irish  industry, art, and antiquity. The scenes there--were picturesque and  uniquely Hibernian. In one of the cottages Irish lace-making could be  noted; in another was shown by Hibernians the whole process of dyeing,  carding, spinning and weaving home-spuns as well as various other branches  of industrial developments in Ireland.    A few steps sufficed to transfer us from here--a representation of the  extreme western portion of Europe to the most eastern country on the  Eastern Hemisphere--Japan; which fact demonstrated the verity: _Les  extrêmes se touchent_. Entering the Japanese bazaar, we observed Japanese  ladies and gentlemen selling articles manufactured in--and imported from  Nipon.    A highly interesting study of the natives of West Java (Dutch East  Indies)--their occupations--and their bamboo huts--could be had in the  _Javanese Village_ exhibiting more than a hundred little men with bright  and cheerful Malay faces, and thirty-six short women whose graceful  movements were a source of attraction to thousands of visitors.    This scene of the tropical regions stood in striking contrast with a  feature in immediate nearness--pertaining to a temperate clime--the  _German Village_. Here, in the spacious concert-garden shaded by the dense  foliage of numerous oak-trees, two German military bands, one of the  infantry and one of the cavalry--seventy-four men in all--gave grand _echt  deutsche Militaerconcerte_. The group of typical German peasant homes, the  Black Forest House, the Westphalian Inn, the Upper Bavarian Home, and the  Spreewald House, together with the Hessian Rural Town-hall, and the Castle  were exact reproductions of mediaeval times. A portion of this stronghold  from a remote date, was given up to the ethnographic museum; a collection  chiefly of implements of war and of chase, illustrative of all periods  beginning with the pre-historic and ending with the renaissance. An  attractive group in wax constituted the figure of Germania, surrounded by  German heroes from Arminius down to William I.    The _Pompeii Panorama_--near by--showed a very realistic representation of  this city destroyed by the eruption of the Vesuvius in 79. This display  was succeeded by the _Persian Theater_ and the _Model of the Eiffel  Tower_.    We left the crowded roadway, and entered the narrow _Street in Cairo_  which made an imposing impression with its strange, oriental facades--the  picturesque shops--and the quaint overhanging upper stories of the ancient  Egyptian city. Natives of this African country--which is fertilized by the  waters of the Nile--manufactured and had for sale Egyptian, Arabian, and  Soudanese articles. Donkeys and camels were engaged in carrying visitors  who chose to admire the busy thoroughfare seated on the backs of these  animals. The native camel-drivers in their national costumes moved around  and mingled with the strangers--which gave the populated street a peculiar  charm to the eye, whereas the \"Bum-Bum Candy\" sold by Egyptian  confectioners, afforded a strange sensation to the palate of the visitor.    Here, where the architecture, the surroundings, and the people were as far  removed from anything American as could well be imagined, we really--for  some minutes--were lost to all consciousness of being in that extremely  modern city, called Chicago.    After having viewed the side attractions to which belonged the Egyptian  temple--resembling the temple of Luxor--the tombs of the ancient kings,  and fac-similes of mummies, we entered the _Algerian and Tunisian  Village_. Besides a theater, it contained a great number of booths or  bazaars in which a choice selection of goods of all kinds--peculiar to  Algiers--was for sale.    Proceeding southward through the frequented avenue, we saw--in  succession--the _Kilauea Panorama_, a vivid picture of the great volcano  of _Hawaii_, with all the surrounding scenery--an _American Indian  Village_, showing the remnants of some of the greatest North American  Indian tribes, and their manner of living--and a _Chinese Village_  including a theater, a joss house, and a bazaar.    The most southwestern portion of the Midway Plaisance was occupied by the  \"Wild East Show\" where performances were given by Bedouin Arabs. With  their short Turkish swords--the cimeters--they accomplished feats of such  intrepidity and daring as to cause the spectators' blood to coagulate in  their veins.    Bending our steps westward again, our attention was fixed upon the  attractions on the north; _id est_ on our right hand side.    Very striking to our eyes were two exhibits the comparison of which  established the fact that they were as unlike each other as could be  fancied. Not only that the two villages contrasted greatly by their  external appearance; but the scenes and inhabitants that they encompassed,  were in direct opposition. Reader, can you realize that here from the  North Pole to the Equator there was but one step? _Laplanders_, from the  Arctic region in Europe, the next-door neighbors of barbarians from the  Torrid Zone in Africa? Although both low in the scale of humanity, the  fierce and savage _Natives of Dahomey_ with their repulsive habits  exhibited the characteristics of the very undermost order of mankind.    But the mind was at once relieved from this sad picture of human  debasement by the refined and attractive scenes in the _Austrian Village_,  inclosing realistic reproductions of thirty-six"]]]
