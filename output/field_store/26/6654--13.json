[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1302"],[0,"The Enemies of Books (#14)"],[1,"charming book, my purchases did  not amount to L13, and I had pretty well a cart-load of books for my  money--more than I wanted much! Having brought them home, I 'weeded them  out,' and the 'weeding' realised four times what I gave for the whole,  leaving me with some real book treasures.    \"Some weeks afterwards I heard that the remainder of the books were  literally treated as waste lumber, and carted off to the neighbouring  town, and were to be had, any one of them, for sixpence, from a cobbler  who had allowed his shop to be used as a store house for them. The news  of their being there reached the ears of an old bookseller in one of  the large towns, and he, I think, cleared out the lot. So curious an  instance of the most total ignorance on the part of the sellers, and  I may add on the part of the possible buyers also, I think is worth  noting.\"    How would the reader in this Year of Grace, 1887, like such an  experience as that?        CONCLUSION.    IT is a great pity that there should be so many distinct enemies at  work for the destruction of literature, and that they should so often be  allowed to work out their sad end. Looked at rightly, the possession of  any old book is a sacred trust, which a conscientious owner or guardian  would as soon think of ignoring as a parent would of neglecting his  child. An old book, whatever its subject or internal merits, is truly  a portion of the national history; we may imitate it and print it in  fac-simile, but we can never exactly reproduce it; and as an historical  document it should be carefully preserved.    I do not envy any man that absence of sentiment which makes some people  careless of the memorials of their ancestors, and whose blood can  be warmed up only by talking of horses or the price of hops. To them  solitude means _ennui_, and anybody's company is preferable to their  own. What an immense amount of calm enjoyment and mental renovation  do such men miss. Even a millionaire will ease his toils, lengthen his  life, and add a hundred per cent. to his daily pleasures if he becomes  a bibliophile; while to the man of business with a taste for books,  who through the day has struggled in the battle of life with all its  irritating rebuffs and anxieties, what a blessed season of pleasurable  repose opens upon him as he enters his sanctum, where every article  wafts to him a welcome, and every book is a personal friend!

The Intimate Motion Picture is an equivalent of the lyric. In  the seventeenth chapter it is shown that one type of the Intimate might  be classed as imagist. And obviously the Splendor Pictures are the  equivalent of the epic.    But perhaps the most adequate way of showing the meaning of this outline  is to say that the Action Film is sculpture-in-motion, the Intimate  Photoplay is painting-in-motion, and the Fairy Pageant, along with the  rest of the Splendor Pictures, may be described as architecture-in-motion.  This chapter will discuss the bearing of the phrase sculpture-in-motion.  It will relate directly to chapter two.    First, gentle and kindly reader, let us discuss sculpture in its most  literal sense: after that, less realistically, but perhaps more  adequately. Let us begin with Annette Kellerman in Neptune's Daughter.  This film has a crude plot constructed to show off Annette's various  athletic resources. It is good photography, and a big idea so far as the  swimming episodes are concerned. An artist haunted by picture-conceptions  equivalent to the musical thoughts back of Wagner's Rhine-maidens could  have made of Annette, in her mermaid's dress, a notable figure. Or a  story akin to the mermaid tale of Hans Christian Andersen, or Matthew  Arnold's poem of the forsaken merman, could have made this picturesque  witch of the salt water truly significant, and still retained the most  beautiful parts of the photoplay as it was exhibited. It is an  exceedingly irrelevant imagination that shows her in other scenes as a  duellist, for instance, because forsooth she can fence. As a child of the  ocean, half fish, half woman, she is indeed convincing. Such mermaids as  this have haunted sailors, and lured them on the rocks to their doom,  from the day the siren sang till the hour the Lorelei sang no more. The  scene with the baby mermaid, when she swims with the pretty creature on  her back, is irresistible. Why are our managers so mechanical? Why do  they flatten out at the moment the fancy of the tiniest reader of  fairy-tales begins to be alive? Most of Annette's support were stage  dummies. Neptune was a lame Santa Claus with cotton whiskers.    But as for the bearing of the film on this chapter: the human figure is  within its rights whenever it is as free from self-consciousness as was  the life-radiating Annette in the heavenly clear waters of Bermuda. On  the other hand, Neptune and his pasteboard diadem and wooden-pointed  pitchfork, should have put on his dressing-gown and retired. As a toe  dancer in an alleged court scene, on land, Annette was a mere simperer.  Possibly Pavlowa as a swimmer in Bermuda waters would have been as much  of a mistake. Each queen to her kingdom.    For living, moving sculpture, the human eye requires a costume and a part  in unity with the meaning of that particular figure. There is the Greek  dress of Mordkin in the arrow dance. There is Annette's breast covering  of shells, and wonderful flowing mermaid hair, clothing her as the  midnight does the moon. The new costume freedom of the photoplay allows  such limitation of clothing as would be probable when one is honestly in  touch with wild nature and preoccupied with vigorous exercise. Thus the  cave-man and desert island narratives, though seldom well done, when  produced with verisimilitude, give an opportunity for the native human  frame in the logical wrappings of reeds and skins. But those who in a  silly hurry seek excuses, are generally merely ridiculous, like the  barefoot man who is terribly tender about walking on the pebbles, or the  wild man who is white as celery or grass under a board. There is no short  cut to vitality.    A successful literal use of sculpture is in the film Oil and Water.  Blanche Sweet is the leader of the play within a play which occupies the  first reel. Here the Olympians and the Muses, with a grace that we fancy  was Greek, lead a dance that traces the story of the spring, summer, and  autumn of life. Finally the supple dancers turn gray and old and die, but  not before they have given us a vision from the Ionian islands. The play  might have been inspired from reading Keats' Lamia, but is probably  derived from the work of Isadora Duncan. This chapter has hereafter only  a passing word or two on literal sculptural effects. It has more in mind  the carver's attitude toward all that passes before the eye.    The sculptor George Gray Barnard is responsible for none of the views in  this discourse, but he has talked to me at length about his sense of  discovery in watching the most ordinary motion pictures, and his delight  in following them with their endless combinations of masses and flowing  surfaces.    The little far-away people on the old-fashioned speaking stage do not  appeal to the plastic sense in this way. They are, by comparison, mere  bits of pasteboard with sweet voices, while, on the other hand, the  photoplay foreground is full of dumb giants. The bodies of these giants  are in high sculptural relief. Where the lights are quite glaring and the  photography is bad, many of the figures are as hard in their impact on  the eye as lime-white plaster-casts, no matter what the clothing. There  are several passages of this sort in the otherwise beautiful Enoch Arden,  where the shipwrecked sailor is depicted on his desert island in the  glaring sun.    What materials should the photoplay figures suggest? There are as many  possible materials as there are subjects for pictures and tone schemes  to be considered. But we will take for illustration wood, bronze, and  marble, since they have been used in the old sculptural art.    There is found in most art shows a type of carved wood gargoyle where the  work and the subject are at one, not only in the color of the wood, but  in the way the material masses itself, in bulk betrays its qualities. We  will suppose a moving picture humorist who is in the same mood as the  carver. He chooses a story of quaint old ladies, street gamins, and fat  aldermen. Imagine the figures with the same massing and interplay  suddenly invested with life, yet giving to the eye a pleasure kindred to  that which is found in carved wood, and bringing to the fancy a similar  humor.    Or there is a type of Action Story where the mood of the figures is that  of bronze, with the aesthetic resources of that metal: its elasticity; its  emphasis on the tendon, ligament, and bone, rather than on the muscle;  and an attribute that we will call the panther-like quality. Hermon A.  MacNeil has a memorable piece of work in the yard of the architect Shaw,  at Lake Forest, Illinois. It is called \"The Sun Vow.\" A little Indian is  shooting toward the sun, while the old warrior, crouching immediately  behind him, follows with his eye the direction of the arrow. Few pieces  of sculpture come readily to mind that show more happily the qualities of  bronze as distinguished from other materials. To imagine such a group  done in marble, carved wood, or Della Robbia ware is to destroy the very  image in the fancy.    The photoplay of the American Indian should in most instances be planned  as bronze in action. The tribes should not move so rapidly that the  panther-like elasticity is lost in the riding, running, and scalping. On  the other hand, the aborigines should be far from the temperateness of  marble.    Mr. Edward S. Curtis, the super-photographer, has made an Ethnological  collection of photographs of our American Indians. This work of a  life-time, a supreme art achievement, shows the native as a figure in  bronze. Mr. Curtis' photoplay, The Land of the Head Hunters (World Film  Corporation), a romance of the Indians of the North-West, abounds in  noble bronzes.    I have gone through my old territories as an art student, in the Chicago  Art Institute and the Metropolitan Museum, of late, in special  excursions, looking for sculpture, painting, and architecture that might  be the basis for the photoplays of the future.    The Bacchante of Frederick MacMonnies is in bronze in the Metropolitan  Museum and in bronze replica in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. There is  probably no work that more rejoices the hearts of the young art students  in either city. The youthful creature illustrates a most joyous leap into  the air. She is high on one foot with the other knee lifted. She holds a  bunch of grapes full-arm's length. Her baby, clutched in the other hand,  is reaching up with greedy mouth toward the fruit. The bacchante body is  glistening in the light. This is joy-in-bronze as the Sun Vow is  power-in-bronze. This special story could not be told in another medium.  I have seen in Paris a marble copy of this Bacchante. It is as though it  were done in soap. On the other hand, many of the renaissance Italian  sculptors have given us children in marble in low relief, dancing like  lilies in the wind. They could not be put into bronze.    The plot of the Action Photoplay is literally or metaphorically a chase  down the road or a hurdle-race. It might be well to consider how typical  figures for such have been put into carved material. There are two bronze  statues that have their replicas in all museums. They are generally one  on either side of the main hall, towering above the second-story  balustrade. First, the statue of Gattamelata, a Venetian general, by  Donatello. The original is in Padua. Then there is the figure of  Bartolommeo Colleoni. The original is in Venice. It is by Verrocchio and  Leopardi. These equestrians radiate authority. There is more action in  them than in any cowboy hordes I have ever beheld zipping across the  screen. Look upon them and ponder long, prospective author-producer. Even  in a simple chase-picture, the speed must not destroy the chance to enjoy  the modelling. If you would give us mounted legions, destined to conquer,  let any one section of the film, if"]]]
