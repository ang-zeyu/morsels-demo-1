Doesn't it say  something of that sort in the Book?\" \"Yes,\" he replied, \"it does. But I  think he is chained now.\" And I could not resist the answer that came  blurting its way out, \"Well, if he is chained, he must have a fairly long  chain: it seems to permit much freedom of action.\" From all that can be  gathered regarding this mighty prince he is not chained yet. We would do  well to learn more about him. The old military maxim, \"Study the enemy,\"  should be followed more closely here.    It is striking that the oldest of the Bible books, and the latest, Job and  Revelation, the first word and the last, give such definite information  concerning him. These coupled with the gospel records supply most of the  information available though not all. Those three and a half years of  Jesus' public work is the period of greatest Satanic and demoniac  activity of which any record has been made. Jesus' own allusions to him  are frequent and in unmistakable language. There are four particular  passages to which I want to turn your attention now. Let it not be  supposed, however, that this phase of prayer rests upon a few isolated  passages. Such a serious truth does not hinge upon selected proof texts.  It is woven into the very texture of this Book throughout.    There are two facts that run through the Bible from one end to the other.  They are like two threads ever crossing in the warp and woof of a finely  woven fabric. Anywhere you run your shears into the web of this Book you  will find these two threads. They run crosswise and are woven inextricably  in. One is a black thread, inky black, pot-black. The other is a bright  thread, like a bit of glory light streaming across. These two threads  everywhere. The one is this--the black thread--there is an enemy. Turn  where you will from Genesis to Revelation--always an enemy. He is keen. He  is subtle. He is malicious. He is cruel. He is obstinate. He is a master.  The second thread is this: the leaders for God have always been men of  prayer above everything else. They are men of power in other ways,  preachers, men of action, with power to sway others but above all else men  of prayer. They give prayer first place. There is one striking exception  to this, namely, King Saul. And most significantly a study of this  exception throws a brilliant lime light upon the career of Satan. King  Sauls seems to furnish the one great human illustration in scripture of  heaven's renegade fallen prince. These special paragraphs to be quoted are  like the pattern in the cloth where the colours of the yarn come into more  definite shape. The gospels form the central pattern of the whole where  the colours pile up into sharpest contrast.        <u>Praying is Fighting.</u>      But let us turn to the Book at once. For we _know_ only what it tells. The  rest is surmise. The only authoritative statements about Satan seem to be  these here. Turn first to the New Testament.    The Old Testament is the book of illustrations; the New of explanations,  of teaching. In the Old, teaching is largely by kindergarten methods. The  best methods, for the world was in its child stage. In the New the  teaching is by precept. There is precept teaching in the Old; very much.  There is picture teaching in the New; the gospels full of it. But picture  teaching, acted teaching, is the characteristic of the Old, and precept  teaching of the New. There is a wonderfully vivid picture in the Old  Testament, of this thing we are discussing. But first let us get the  teaching counterpart in the new, and then look at the picture.    Turn to Ephesians. Ephesians is a prayer epistle. That is a very  significant fact to mark. Of Paul's thirteen letters Ephesians is  peculiarly the prayer letter. Paul is clearly in a prayer mood. He is on  his knees here. He has much to say to these people whom he has won to  Christ, but it comes in the parenthesis of his prayer. The connecting  phrase running through is--\"for this cause I pray.... I bow my knees.\"  Halfway through this rare old man's mind runs out to the condition of  these churches, and he puts in the always needed practical injunctions  about their daily lives. Then the prayer mood reasserts itself, and the  epistle finds its climax in a remarkable paragraph on prayer. From praying  the man goes urging them to pray.    We must keep the book open here as we talk: chapter six, verses ten to  twenty inclusive. The main drive of all their living and warfare seems  very clear to this scarred veteran:--\"that ye may be able to withstand the  wiles of the devil.\" This man seems to have had no difficulty in believing  in a personal devil. Probably he had had too many close encounters for  that. To Paul Satan is a cunning strategist requiring every bit of  available resource to combat.    This paragraph states two things:--who the real foe is, against whom the  fight is directed; and, then with climactic intensity it pitches on the  main thing that routs him. Who is the real foe? Listen:--\"For our  wrestling is not against flesh and blood\"--not against men; never that;  something far, subtler--\"but against the principalities\"--a word for a  compact organization of individuals,--\"against powers\"--not only organized  but highly endowed intellectually, \"against the world-rulers of this  darkness,\"--they are of princely kin; not common folk--\"against the hosts  of wicked spirits in the heavenlies\"--spirit beings, in vast numbers,  having their headquarters somewhere above the earth. _That_ is the foe.  Large numbers of highly endowed spirit beings, compactly organized, who  are the sovereigns of the present realm or age of moral darkness, having  their _headquarters_ of activity somewhere above the earth, and below the  throne of God, but concerned with human beings upon the earth. In chapter  two of the epistle the head or ruler of this organization is referred to,  \"the prince of the powers of the air.\"[25] That is the real foe.    Then in one of his strong piled up climactic sentences Paul tells how the  fight is to be won. This sentence runs unbroken through verses fourteen to  twenty inclusive. There are six preliminary clauses in it leading up to  its main statement. These clauses name the pieces of armour used by a  Roman soldier in the action of battle. The loins girt, the breastplate on,  the feet shod, the shield, the helmet the sword, and so on. A Roman  soldier reading this or, hearing Paul preach it, would expect him to  finish the sentence by saying \"_with all your fighting strength  fighting_.\"    That would be the proper conclusion rhetorically of this sentence. But  when Paul reaches the climax with his usual intensity he drops the  rhetorical figure, and puts in the thing with which in our case the  fighting is done--\"with all prayer _praying_.\" In place of the  expected word fighting is the word praying. The thing with which the  fighting is done is put in place of the word itself. Our fighting is  praying. Praying is fighting, spirit-fighting. That is to say, this old  evangelist-missionary-bishop says, we are in the thick of a fight. There  is a war on. How shall we best fight? First get into good shape to pray,  and then with all your praying strength and skill _pray_. That word  _praying_ is the climax of this long sentence, and of this whole epistle.  This is the sort of action that turns the enemy's flank, and reveals his  heels. He simply _cannot_ stand before persistent knee-work.    Now mark the keenness of Paul's description of the man who does most  effective work in praying. There are six qualifications under the figure  of the six pieces of armour. A clear understanding of truth, a clean  obedient life, earnest service, a strongly simple trust in God, clear  assurance of one's own salvation and relation to God, and a good grip of  the truth for others--these things prepare a man for the real conflict of  prayer. _Such a man_--_praying_--_drives back these hosts of the traitor  prince_. Such a man praying is invincible in his Chief, Jesus. The  equipment is simple, and in its beginnings comes quickly to the willing,  earnest heart.    Look a bit at how the strong climax of this long sentence runs. It is  fairly bristling with points. Soldier-points all of them; like bayonet  points. Just such as a general engaged in a siege-fight would give to his  men. \"With all prayer and supplication\"--there is _intensity_;  \"praying\"--that is _the main drive_; \"at all seasons\"--_ceaselessness_,  night and day; hot and cold; wet and dry; \"in the Spirit\"--as _guided by  the Chief;_ \"and watching thereunto\"--_sleepless vigilance;_ watching is  ever a fighting word; watch the enemy; watch your own forces; \"with all  perseverance\"--_persistence_; cheery, jaw-locked, dogged persistence,  bulldog tenacity; \"and supplication\"--_intensity again_; \"for all the  saints\"--_the sweep of the action_, keep in touch with the whole army;  \"and on my behalf\"--the human leader, rally around _the immediate leader._  This is the foe to be fought. And this the sort of fighting that defeats  this foe.        <u>A double Wrestling Match.</u>      Now turn back to the illustration section of our Book for a remarkably  graphic illustration of these words. It is in the old prophecy of Daniel,  tenth chapter. The story is this: Daniel is an old man now. He is an  exile. He has not seen the green hills of his fatherland since boyhood. In  this level Babylon, he is homesick for the dear old Palestinian hills, and  he is heartsick over the plight of his people. He has been studying  Jeremiah's prophecies, and finds there the promise plainly made that after  seventy years these exiled Hebrews are to be allowed to return. Go back  again! The thought of it quickens his pulse-beats. He does some quick  counting. The time will soon be up. So Daniel plans a bit of time for  special prayer, a sort of siege"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13202"],[0,"\"Co. Aytch,\" Maury Grays, First Tennessee Regiment (#14)"],[1," the army, happened  at this place.  A big strapping fellow by the name of Tennessee Thompson,  always carried bigger burdens than any other five men in the army.  For example, he carried two quilts, three blankets, one gum oil cloth,  one overcoat, one axe, one hatchet, one camp-kettle, one oven and lid,  one coffee pot, besides his knapsack, haversack, canteen, gun, cartridge-  box, and three days' rations.  He was a rare bird, anyhow.  Tennessee  usually had his hair cut short on one side and left long on the other,  so that he could give his head a bow and a toss and throw the long hairs  over on the other side, and it would naturally part itself without a  comb.  Tennessee was the wit and good nature of the company; always in  a good humor, and ever ready to do any duty when called upon.  In fact,  I would sometimes get out of heart and low spirited, and would hunt up  Tennessee to have a little fun.  His bye-word was \"Bully for Bragg;  he's hell on retreat, and will whip the Yankees yet.\"  He was a good and  brave soldier, and followed the fortunes of Company H from the beginning  to the end.    Well, one day he and Billy Webster bet twenty-five dollars, put up in  Bill Martin's hands, as to which could run the faster.  John Tucker,  Joe Lee, Alf. Horsley and myself were appointed judges.  The distance  was two hundred yards.  The ground was measured off, and the judges  stationed.  Tennessee undressed himself, even down to his stocking feet,  tied a red handkerchief around his head, and another one around his waist,  and walked deliberately down the track, eyeing every little rock and  stick and removing them off the track.  Comes back to the starting point  and then goes down the track in half canter; returns again, his eyes  flashing, his nostrils dilated, looking the impersonation of the champion  courser of the world; makes two or three apparently false starts; turns  a somersault by placing his head on the ground and flopping over on his  back; gets up and whickers like a horse; goes half-hammered, hop, step,  and jump--he says, to loosen up his joints--scratches up the ground with  his hands and feet, flops his arms and crows like a rooster, and says,  \"Bully for Bragg; he's hell on a retreat,\" and announces his readiness.  The drum is tapped, and off they start.  Well, Billy Webster beat him one  hundred yards in the two hundred, and Tennessee came back and said, \"Well,  boys, I'm beat; Billy Martin, hand over the stakes to Billy Webster.  I'm beat, but hang me if I didn't outrun the whole Yankee army coming out  of Kentucky; got away from Lieutenant Lansdown and the whole detail at  Chattanooga with half a hog, a fifty pound sack of flour, a jug of  Meneesee commissary whisky, and a camp-kettle full of brown sugar.  I'm beat.  Billy Martin, hand over the stakes.  Bully for Bragg; he's  hell on a retreat.\"  Tennessee was trying bluff.  He couldn't run worth a  cent; but there was no braver or truer man ever drew a ramrod or tore a  cartridge than Tennessee.      EATING MUSSELS    Reader, did you ever eat a mussel?  Well, we did, at Shelbyville.  We were camped right upon the bank of Duck river, and one day Fred Dornin,  Ed Voss, Andy Wilson and I went in the river mussel hunting.  Every one  of us had a meal sack.  We would feel down with our feet until we felt a  mussel and then dive for it.  We soon filled our sacks with mussels in  their shells.  When we got to camp we cracked the shells and took out the  mussels.  We tried frying them, but the longer they fried the tougher  they got.  They were a little too large to swallow whole.  Then we stewed  them, and after a while we boiled them, and then we baked them, but every  flank movement we would make on those mussels the more invulnerable they  would get.  We tried cutting them up with a hatchet, but they were so  slick and tough the hatchet would not cut them.  Well, we cooked them,  and buttered them, and salted them, and peppered them, and battered them.  They looked good, and smelt good, and tasted good; at least the fixings  we put on them did, and we ate the mussels.  I went to sleep that night.  I dreamed that my stomach was four grindstones, and that they turned in  four directions, according to the four corners of the earth.  I awoke  to hear four men yell out, \"O, save, O, save me from eating any more  mussels!\"      \"POOR\" BERRY MORGAN    One of those sad, unexpected affairs, that remind the living that even in  life we are in the midst of death, happened at Shelbyville.  Our regiment  had been out to the front, on duty, and was returning to camp.  It was  nearly dark, and we saw a black wind cloud rising.  The lightning's flash  and the deep muttering thunders warned us to seek shelter as speedily as  possible.  Some of us ran in under the old depot shed, and soon the storm  struck us.  It was a tornado that made a track through the woods beyond  Shelbyville, and right through the town, and we could follow its course  for miles where it had blown down the timber, twisting and piling it in  every shape.  Berry Morgan and I had ever been close friends, and we  threw down our blankets and were lying side by side, when I saw roofs of  houses, sign boards, and brickbats flying in every direction.  Nearly  half of the town was blown away in the storm.  While looking at the storm  without, I felt the old shed suddenly jar and tremble, and suddenly  become unroofed, and it seemed to me that ten thousand brickbats had  fallen in around us.  I could hear nothing for the roaring of the storm,  and could see nothing for the blinding rain and flying dirt and bricks  and other rubbish.  The storm lasted but a few minutes, but those minutes  seemed ages.  When it had passed, I turned to look at \"poor Berry.\"  Poor fellow! his head was crushed in by a brickbat, his breast crushed  in by another, and I think his arm was broken, and he was otherwise  mutilated.  It was a sad sight.  Many others of our regiment were wounded.    Berry was a very handsome boy.  He was what everybody would call a  \"pretty man.\"  He had fair skin, blue eyes, and fine curly hair, which  made him look like an innocent child.  I loved Berry.  He was my friend--  as true as the needle to the pole.  But God, who doeth all things well,  took his spirit in the midst of the storm to that beautiful home beyond  the skies.  I thank God I am no infidel.  We will meet again.      WRIGHT SHOT TO DEATH WITH MUSKETRY    I saw a young boy about seventeen or eighteen years old, by the name of  Wright, and belonging to General Marcus J. Wright's brigade, shot to  death with musketry at this place.  The whole of Cheatham's division had  to march out and witness the horrid scene.  Now, I have no doubt that  many, if not all, would have gone without being forced to do so, but then  you know that was Bragg's style.  He wanted always to display his tyranny,  and to intimidate his privates as much as possible.  The young man was  hauled in a wagon, sitting on his coffin, to the place where the grave  was to be dug, and a post was planted in the ground.  He had to sit there  for more than two hours, looking on at the preparations for his death.  I went up to the wagon, like many others, to have a look at the doomed  man.  He had his hat pulled down over his eyes, and was busily picking at  the ends of his fingers.  The guard who then had him in charge told me  that one of the culprit's own brothers was one of the detail to shoot  him.  I went up to the wagon and called him, \"Wright!\"  He made no reply,  and did not even look up.  Then I said, \"Wright, why don't you jump out  of that wagon and run?\"  He was callous to everything.  I was sorry for  him.  When the division was all assembled, and the grave dug, and the  post set, he was taken out of the wagon, and tied to the post.  He was  first tied facing the post, and consequently would have been shot in the  back, but was afterwards tied with his back to the post.  The chaplain of  the regiment read a chapter in the Bible, sang a hymn, and then all knelt  down and prayed.  General Wright went up to the pinioned man, shook  hands with him, and told him good-bye, as did many others, and then the  shooting detail came up, and the officer in charge gave the command,  \"Ready, aim, fire!\"  The crash of musketry broke upon the morning air.  I was looking at Wright.  I heard him almost shriek, \"O, O, God!\"  His head dropped forward, the rope with which he was pinioned keeping him  from falling.  I turned away and thought how long, how long will I have  to witness these things?      DAVE SUBLETT PROMOTED    While at Shelbyville, a vacancy occurring in Captain Ledbetter's company,  the Rutherford Rifles, for fourth corporal, Dave Sublett became a  candidate for the position.  Now, Dave was a genius.  He was a noble and  brave fellow, and at one time had been a railroad director.  He had a  distinguished air always about him, but Dave had one fault, and that was,  he was ever prone to get tight.  He had been a Union man, and even now  he always had a good word for the Union.  He was sincere, but eccentric.  The election for fourth corporal was drawing nigh.  Dave sent off and got  two jugs of _spirits vini frumenti_, and treated the boys.  Of course,  his vote would be solid.  Every man in that company was going to cast his  vote for him.  Dave got happy and wanted to make a speech.  He went to  the butcher's block which was used to cut up meat on--he called it  Butchers' Hall--got upon it amid loud cheering and hurrahs of the boys.  He spoke substantially as follows:    \"Fellow Citizens--I confess that it is with feelings of diffidence and  great embarrassment on my part that I appear before you on this occasion.  But, gentlemen and fellow-citizens, I desire to serve you in an humble  capacity, as fourth corporal of Company I.  Should you see cause to elect  me, no heart will beat with more gratitude than my own.  Gentlemen,  you well know that I was"]]]
