For this blood is the heart's    blood of your parents, and though it may seem to be of two kinds,    yet, in reality, it is only one. Mix the two kinds of blood, and    keep the mixture tightly enclosed in the globe of the seven wise    Masters. Then that which is generated will be nourished with its    own flesh and blood, and will complete its course of development    when the Moon has changed for the eighth time. If thou repeat this    process again and again, thou shalt see children's children, and    the offspring of thy body shall fill the world.' When Phoebus    had thus spoken, he winged his flight heavenward. In the morning    the knight arose and did the bidding of the celestial messenger,    and God gave to him and to his wife many children, who inherited    their father's glory, wealth, and knightly honours from generation    to generation.\"    In the \"Dedicatory Epistle\" to his _Triumphal Chariot of Antimony_,  Basil Valentine addresses his brother alchemists as follows:--      \"Mercury appeared to me in a dream, and brought me back from my    devious courses to the one way. 'Behold me clad not in the garb of    the vulgar, but in the philosopher's mantle.' So he said, and    straightway began to leap along the road in headlong bounds. Then,    when he was tired, he sat down, and, turning to me, who had    followed him in the spirit, bade me mark that he no longer    possessed that youthful vigour with which he would at the first    have overcome every obstacle, if he had not been allowed a free    course. Encouraged by his friendly salutation, I addressed him in    the following terms: 'Mercury, eloquent scion of Atlas, and father    of all Alchemists, since thou hast guided me hitherto, shew me, I    pray thee, the way to those Blessed Isles, which thou hast    promised to reveal to all thine elect children. 'Dost thou    remember,' he replied, that when I quitted thy laboratory, I left    behind me a garment so thoroughly saturated with my own blood,    that neither the wind could efface it, nor all-devouring time    destroy its indelible essence? Fetch it hither to me, that I may    not catch a chill from the state of perspiration in which I now    am; but let me clothe myself warmly in it, and be closely incited    thereto, so that I may safely reach my bride, who is sick with    love. She has meekly borne many wrongs, being driven through water    and fire, and compelled to ascend and descend times without    number--yet has she been carried through it all by the hope of    entering with me the bridal chamber, wherein we expect to beget a    son adorned from his birth with the royal crown which he may not    share with others. Yet may he bring his friends to the palace,    where sits enthroned the King of Kings, who communicates his    dignity readily and liberally to all that approach him.'      \"I brought him the garment, and it fitted him so closely, that it    looked like an iron skin securing him against all the assaults of    Vulcan. 'Let us proceed,' he then said, and straightway sped    across the open field, while I boldly strove to keep up with my    guide.      \"Thus we reached his bride, whose virtue and constancy were equal    to his own. There I beheld their marvellous conjugal union and    nuptial consummation, whence was born the son crowned with the    royal diadem. When I was about to salute him as King of Kings and    Lord of Lords, my Genius stood by me and warned me not to be    deceived, since this was only the King's forerunner, but not the    King himself whom I sought.      \"When I heard the admonition, I did not know whether to be sad or    joyful. 'Depart,' then said Mercury, 'with this bridal gift, and    when you come to those disciples who have seen the Lord himself,    show them this sign.' And therewith he gave me a gold ring from    his son's finger. 'They know the golden branch which must be    consecrated to Proserpina before you can enter the palace of    Pluto. When he sees this ring, perhaps one will open to you with a    word the door of that chamber, where sits enthroned in his    magnificence the Desire of all Nations, who is known only to the    Sages.'      \"When he had thus spoken, the vision vanished, but the bridal gift    which I still held in my hand shewed me that it had not been a    mere dream. It was of gold, but to me more precious than the most    prized of all metals. Unto you I will shew it when I am permitted    to see your faces, and to converse with you freely. Till that    earnestly wished-for time, I bid you farewell.\"    One result of the alchemical modes of expression was, that he who  tried to follow the directions given in alchemical books got into  dire confusion. He did not know what substances to use in his  operations; for when he was told to employ \"the homogeneous water of  gold,\" for example, the expression might mean anything, and in despair  he distilled, and calcined, and cohobated, and tried to decompose  everything he could lay hands on. Those who pretended to know abused  and vilified those who differed from them.    In _A Demonstration of Nature_, by John A. Mehung (17th century),  Nature addresses the alchemical worker in the following words:--      \"You break vials, and consume coals, only to soften your brains    still more with the vapours. You also digest alum, salt, orpiment,    and altrament; you melt metals, build small and large furnaces,    and use many vessels; nevertheless I am sick of your folly, and    you suffocate me with your sulphurous smoke.... You would do    better to mind your own business, than to dissolve and distil so    many absurd substances, and then to pass them through alembics,    cucurbits, stills, and pelicans.\"    Henry Madathanas, writing in 1622, says:--      \"Then I understood that their purgations, sublimations,    cementations, distillations, rectifications, circulations,    putrefactions, conjunctions, calcinations, incinerations,    mortifications, revivifications, as also their tripods, athanors,    reverberatory alembics, excrements of horses, ashes, sand, stills,    pelican-viols, retorts, fixations, etc., are mere plausible    impostures and frauds.\"    The author of _The Only Way_ (1677) says:      \"Surely every true Artist must look on this elaborate tissue of    baseless operations as the merest folly, and can only wonder that    the eyes of those silly dupes are not at last opened, that they    may see something besides such absurd sophisms, and read something    besides those stupid and deceitful books.... I can speak from    bitter experience, for I, too, toiled for many years ... and    endeavoured to reach the coveted goal by sublimation,    distillation, calcination, circulation, and so forth, and to    fashion the Stone out of substances such as urine, salt, atrament,    alum, etc. I have tried hard to evolve it out of hairs, wine,    eggs, bones, and all manner of herbs; out of arsenic, mercury, and    sulphur, and all the minerals and metals.... I have spent nights    and days in dissolving, coagulating, amalgamating, and    precipitating. Yet from all these things I derived neither profit    nor joy.\"    Another writer speaks of many would-be alchemists as \"floundering  about in a sea of specious book-learning.\"    If alchemists could speak of their own processes and materials as  those authors spoke whom I have quoted, we must expect that the  alchemical language would appear mere jargon to the uninitiated. In  Ben Jonson's play _The Alchemist_, _Surley_, who is the sceptic of the  piece, says to Subtle, who is the alchemist--          ... Alchemy is a pretty kind of game,        Somewhat like tricks o' the cards, to cheat a man        With charming ...        What else are all your terms,        Whereon no one of your writers 'grees with other?        Of your elixir, your _lac virginis_,        Your stone, your med'cine, and your chrysosperme,        Your sal, your sulphur, and your mercury,        Your oil of height, your tree of life, your blood,        Your marchesite, your tutie, your magnesia,        Your toad, your crow, your dragon, and your panther;        Your sun, your moon, your firmament, your adrop,        Your lato, azoch, zernich, chibrit, heutarit,        And then your red man, and your white woman,        With all your broths, your menstrues, and materials,        Of lye and egg-shells, women's terms, man's blood,        Hair o' the head, burnt clout, chalk, merds, and clay,        Powder of bones, scalings of iron, glass,        And moulds of other strange ingredients,        Would burst a man to name?    To which _Subtle_ answers,                    And all these named        Intending but one thing; which art our writers        Used to obscure their art.        Was not all the knowledge        Of the Egyptians writ in mystic symbols?        Speak not the Scriptures oft in parables?        Are not the choicest fables of the poets,        That were the fountains and first springs of wisdom,        Wrapp'd in perplexed allegories?    The alchemists were very fond of using the names of animals as symbols  of certain mineral substances, and of representing operations in the  laboratory by what may be called animal allegories. The _yellow lion_  was the alchemical symbol of yellow sulphides, the _red lion_ was  synonymous with cinnabar, and the _green lion_ meant salts of iron and  of copper. Black sulphides were called _eagles_, and sometimes  _crows_.

And this was their game now. The fox to get back home must cross the  river, where he was exposed to the full brunt of the crow mob. He made a  dash for it, and would doubtless have gotten across with his booty had I  not joined in the attack, whereupon he dropped the hen, scarce dead, and  disappeared in the woods.    This large and regular levy of provisions wholly carried off could mean  but one thing, a family of little foxes at home; and to find them I now  was bound.    That evening I went with Ranger, my hound, across the river into the  Erindale woods. As soon as the hound began to circle, we heard the  short, sharp bark of a fox from a thickly wooded ravine close by. Ranger  dashed in at once, struck a hot scent and went off on a lively  straight-away till his voice was lost in the distance away over the  upland.    After nearly an hour he came back, panting and warm, for it was baking  August weather, and lay down at my feet.    But almost immediately the same foxy '_Yap yurrr_' was heard close at  hand and off dashed the dog on another chase.    Away he went in the darkness, baying like a foghorn, straight away to  the north. And the loud '_Boo, boo_,' became a low '_oo, oo_,' and that  a feeble 'o-o' and then was lost. They must have gone some miles away,  for even with ear to the ground I heard nothing of them, though a mile  was easy distance for Ranger's brazen voice. As I waited in the black  woods I heard a sweet sound of dripping water: '_Tink tank tenk tink, Ta  tink tank tenk tonk_.'    I did not know of any spring so near, and in the hot night it was a glad  find. But the sound led me to the bough of an oak-tree, where I found  its source. Such a soft, sweet song; full of delightful suggestion on  such a night:         Tonk tank tenk tink       Ta tink a tonk a tank a tink a       Ta ta tink tank ta ta tonk tink       Drink a tank a drink a drunk.    It was the 'water-dripping' song of the saw-whet owl.    But suddenly a deep raucous breathing and a rustle of leaves showed that  Ranger was back.    He was completely fagged out. His tongue hung almost to the ground and  was dripping with foam, his flanks were heaving and spume-flecks  dribbled from his breast and sides. He stopped panting a moment to give  my hand a dutiful lick, then flung himself flop on the leaves to drown  all other sounds with his noisy panting. But again that tantalizing  '_Yap yurrr_' was heard a few feet away, and the meaning of it all  dawned on me.    We were close to the den where the little foxes were, and the old ones  were taking turns in trying to lead us away.    It was late night now, so we went home feeling sure that the problem was  nearly solved.          II      It was well known that there was an old fox with his family living in  the neighborhood, but no one supposed them so near.    This fox had been called 'Scarface,' because of a scar reaching from his  eye through and back of his ear; this was supposed to have been given  him by a barbed-wire fence during a rabbit hunt, and as the hair came in  white after it healed, it was always a strong mark.    The winter before I had met with him and had had a sample of his  craftiness. I was out shooting, after a fall of snow, and had crossed  the open fields to the edge of the brushy hollow back of the old mill.  As my head rose to a view of the hollow I caught sight of a fox trotting  at long range down the other side, in line to cross my course. Instantly  I held motionless, and did not even lower or turn my head lest I should  catch his eye by moving, until he went on out of sight in the thick  cover at the bottom. As soon as he was hidden I bobbed down and ran to  head him off where he should leave the cover on the other side, and was  there in good time awaiting, but no fox came forth. A careful took  showed the fresh track of a fox that had bounded from the cover, and  following it with my eye I saw old Scarface himself far out of range  behind me, sitting on his haunches and grinning as though much amused.    A study of the trail made all clear. He had seen me at the moment I saw  him, but he, also like a true hunter, had concealed the fact, putting on  an air of unconcern till out of sight, when he had run for his life  around behind me and amused himself by watching my stillborn trick.    In the springtime I had yet another instance of Scarface's cunning. I  was walking with a friend along the road over the high pasture. We  passed within thirty feet of a ridge on which were several gray and  brown bowlders. When at the nearest point my friend said:    \"Stone number three looks to me very much like a fox curled up.\"    But I could not see it, and we passed. We had not gone many yards  farther when the wind blew on this bowlder as on fur.    My friend said, \"I am sure that is a fox, lying asleep.\"    \"We'll soon settle that,\" I replied, and turned back, but as soon as I  had taken one step from the road, up jumped Scarface, for it was he, and  ran. A fire had swept the middle of the pasture, leaving a broad belt of  black; over this he skurried till he came to the unburnt yellow grass  again, where he squatted down and was lost to view. He had been watching  us all the time, and would not have moved had we kept to the road. The  wonderful part of this is, not that he resembled the round stones and  dry grass, but that he _knew he did_, and was ready to profit by it.    We soon found that it was Scarface and his wife Vixen that had made our  woods their home and our barnyard their base of supplies.    Next morning a search in the pines showed a great bank of earth that had  been scratched up within a few months. It must have come from a hole,  and yet there was none to be seen. It is well known that a really cute  fox, on digging a new den, brings all the earth out at the first hole  made, but carries on a tunnel into some distant thicket. Then closing up  for good the first made and too well-marked door, uses only the entrance  hidden in the thicket.    So after a little search at the other side of a knoll, I found the real  entry and good proof that there was a nest of little foxes inside.    Rising above the brush on the hillside was a great hollow basswood. It  leaned a good deal and had a large hole at the bottom, and a smaller one  at top.    We boys had often used this tree in playing Swiss Family Robinson, and  by cutting steps in its soft punky walls had made it easy to go up and  down in the hollow. Now it came in handy, for next day when the sun was  warm I went there to watch, and from this perch on the roof, I soon saw  the interesting family that lived in the cellar near by. There were four  little foxes; they looked curiously like little lambs, with their  woolly coats, their long, thick legs and innocent expressions, and yet a  second glance at their broad, sharp-nosed, sharp-eyed visages showed  that each of these innocents was the makings of a crafty old fox.    They played about, basking in the sun, or wrestling with each other till  a slight sound made them skurry under ground. But their alarm was  needless, for the cause of it was their mother; she stepped from the  bushes bringing another hen--number seventeen as I remember. A low call  from her and the little fellows came tumbling out. Then began a scene  that I thought charming, but which my uncle would not have enjoyed at  all.    They rushed on the hen, and tussled and fought with it, and each other,  while the mother, keeping a sharp eye for enemies, looked on with fond  delight. The expression on her face was remarkable. It was first a  grinning of delight, but her usual look of wildness and cunning was  there, nor were cruelty and nervousness lacking, but over all was the  unmistakable look of the mother's pride and love.    The base of my tree was hidden in bushes and much lower than the knoll  where the den was. So I could come and go at will without scaring the  foxes.    [Illustration: They tussled and fought while their mother looked on with  fond delight.]    For many days I went there and saw much of the training of the young  ones. They early learned to turn to statuettes at any strange sound, and  then on hearing it again or finding other cause for fear, to run for  shelter.    Some animals have so much mother-love that it overflows and benefits  outsiders. Not so old Vixen it would seem. Her pleasure in the cubs led  to most refined cruelty. For she often brought home to them mice and  birds alive, and with diabolical gentleness would avoid doing them  serious hurt so that the cubs might have larger scope to torment them.    There was a woodchuck that lived over in the hill orchard. He was  neither handsome nor interesting, but he knew how to take care of  himself. He had digged a den between the roots of an old pine-stump, so  that the foxes could not follow him by digging. But hard work was not  their way of life; wits they believed worth more than elbow-grease. This  woodchuck usually sunned himself on the stump each morning. If he saw a  fox near he went down in the door of his den, or if the enemy was very  near he went inside and stayed long enough for the danger to pass.    One morning Vixen and her mate seemed to decide that it was time the  children knew something about the broad subject of Woodchucks, and  further that this orchard woodchuck would serve nicely for an  object-lesson. So they went together to the orchard-fence unseen by old  Chuckie on his stump. Scarface then showed himself in the orchard and  quietly walked in a line so as to, pass by the stump at a distance, but  never once turned his head or allowed the ever-watchful woodchuck to  think himself seen. When the fox entered the field the woodchuck quietly  dropped down to the mouth of his den; here he waited as the fox passed,  but concluding that after all wisdom is the better part, went into his  hole.
