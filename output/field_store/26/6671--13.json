What, indeed, could the  officer have done, being no surgeon and having no water?    At the head of a shallow ravine, a mere depression of the ground, lay a  small group of bodies. He saw, and swerving suddenly from his course  walked rapidly toward them. Scanning each one sharply as he passed, he  stopped at last above one which lay at a slight remove from the others,  near a clump of small trees. He looked at it narrowly. It seemed to  stir. He stooped and laid his hand upon its face. It screamed.           *       *       *       *       *    The officer was Captain Downing Madwell, of a Massachusetts regiment of  infantry, a daring and intelligent soldier, an honorable man.    In the regiment were two brothers named Halcrow--Caffal and Creede  Halcrow. Caffal Halcrow was a sergeant in Captain Madwell's company, and  these two men, the sergeant and the captain, were devoted friends. In so  far as disparity of rank, difference in duties and considerations of  military discipline would permit they were commonly together. They had,  indeed, grown up together from childhood. A habit of the heart is not  easily broken off. Caffal Halcrow had nothing military in his taste nor  disposition, but the thought of separation from his friend was  disagreeable; he enlisted in the company in which Madwell was  second-lieutenant. Each had taken two steps upward in rank, but between  the highest non-commissioned and the lowest commissioned officer the  gulf is deep and wide and the old relation was maintained with  difficulty and a difference.    Creede Halcrow, the brother of Caffal, was the major of the regiment--a  cynical, saturnine man, between whom and Captain Madwell there was a  natural antipathy which circumstances had nourished and strengthened to  an active animosity. But for the restraining influence of their mutual  relation to Caffal these two patriots would doubtless have endeavored to  deprive their country of each other's services.    At the opening of the battle that morning the regiment was performing  outpost duty a mile away from the main army. It was attacked and nearly  surrounded in the forest, but stubbornly held its ground. During a lull  in the fighting, Major Halcrow came to Captain Madwell. The two  exchanged formal salutes, and the major said: \"Captain, the colonel  directs that you push your company to the head of this ravine and hold  your place there until recalled. I need hardly apprise you of the  dangerous character of the movement, but if you wish, you can, I  suppose, turn over the command to your first-lieutenant. I was not,  however, directed to authorize the substitution; it is merely a  suggestion of my own, unofficially made.\"    To this deadly insult Captain Madwell coolly replied:    \"Sir, I invite you to accompany the movement. A mounted officer would be  a conspicuous mark, and I have long held the opinion that it would be  better if you were dead.\"    The art of repartee was cultivated in military circles as early as 1862.    A half-hour later Captain Madwell's company was driven from its position  at the head of the ravine, with a loss of one-third its number. Among  the fallen was Sergeant Halcrow. The regiment was soon afterward forced  back to the main line, and at the close of the battle was miles away.  The captain was now standing at the side of his subordinate and friend.    Sergeant Halcrow was mortally hurt. His clothing was deranged; it seemed  to have been violently torn apart, exposing the abdomen. Some of the  buttons of his jacket had been pulled off and lay on the ground beside  him and fragments of his other garments were strewn about. His leather  belt was parted and had apparently been dragged from beneath him as he  lay. There had been no great effusion of blood. The only visible wound  was a wide, ragged opening in the abdomen.    It was defiled with earth and dead leaves. Protruding from it was a loop  of small intestine. In all his experience Captain Madwell had not seen a  wound like this. He could neither conjecture how it was made nor explain  the attendant circumstances--the strangely torn clothing, the parted  belt, the besmirching of the white skin. He knelt and made a closer  examination. When he rose to his feet, he turned his eyes in different  directions as if looking for an enemy. Fifty yards away, on the crest of  a low, thinly wooded hill, he saw several dark objects moving about  among the fallen men--a herd of swine. One stood with its back to him,  its shoulders sharply elevated. Its forefeet were upon a human body, its  head was depressed and invisible. The bristly ridge of its chine showed  black against the red west. Captain Madwell drew away his eyes and fixed  them again upon the thing which had been his friend.    The man who had suffered these monstrous mutilations was alive. At  intervals he moved his limbs; he moaned at every breath. He stared  blankly into the face of his friend and if touched screamed. In his  giant agony he had torn up the ground on which he lay; his clenched  hands were full of leaves and twigs and earth. Articulate speech was  beyond his power; it was impossible to know if he were sensible to  anything but pain. The expression of his face was an appeal; his eyes  were full of prayer. For what?    There was no misreading that look; the captain had too frequently seen  it in eyes of those whose lips had still the power to formulate it by an  entreaty for death. Consciously or unconsciously, this writhing fragment  of humanity, this type and example of acute sensation, this handiwork of  man and beast, this humble, unheroic Prometheus, was imploring  everything, all, the whole non-ego, for the boon of oblivion. To the  earth and the sky alike, to the trees, to the man, to whatever took form  in sense or consciousness, this incarnate suffering addressed that  silent plea.    For what, indeed? For that which we accord to even the meanest creature  without sense to demand it, denying it only to the wretched of our own  race: for the blessed release, the rite of uttermost compassion, the  _coup de grace_.    Captain Madwell spoke the name of his friend. He repeated it over and  over without effect until emotion choked his utterance.    His tears plashed upon the livid face beneath his own and blinded  himself. He saw nothing but a blurred and moving object, but the moans  were more distinct than ever, interrupted at briefer intervals by  sharper shrieks. He turned away, struck his hand upon his forehead, and  strode from the spot. The swine, catching sight of him, threw up their  crimson muzzles, regarding him suspiciously a second, and then with a  gruff, concerted grunt, raced away out of sight. A horse, its foreleg  splintered by a cannon-shot, lifted its head sidewise from the ground  and neighed piteously. Madwell stepped forward, drew his revolver and  shot the poor beast between the eyes, narrowly observing its  death-struggle, which, contrary to his expectation, was violent and  long; but at last it lay still. The tense muscles of its lips, which had  uncovered the teeth in a horrible grin, relaxed; the sharp, clean-cut  profile took on a look of profound peace and rest.    Along the distant, thinly wooded crest to westward the fringe of sunset  fire had now nearly burned itself out. The light upon the trunks of the  trees had faded to a tender gray; shadows were in their tops, like great  dark birds aperch. Night was coming and there were miles of haunted  forest between Captain Madwell and camp. Yet he stood there at the side  of the dead animal, apparently lost to all sense of his surroundings.  His eyes were bent upon the earth at his feet; his left hand hung  loosely at his side, his right still held the pistol. Presently he  lifted his face, turned it toward his dying friend and walked rapidly  back to his side. He knelt upon one knee, cocked the weapon, placed the  muzzle against the man's forehead, and turning away his eyes pulled the  trigger. There was no report. He had used his last cartridge for the  horse.    The sufferer moaned and his lips moved convulsively. The froth that ran  from them had a tinge of blood.    Captain Madwell rose to his feet and drew his sword from the scabbard.  He passed the fingers of his left hand along the edge from hilt to  point. He held it out straight before him, as if to test his nerves.  There was no visible tremor of the blade; the ray of bleak skylight that  it reflected was steady and true. He stooped and with his left hand tore  away the dying man's shirt, rose and placed the point of the sword just  over the heart. This time he did not withdraw his eyes. Grasping the  hilt with both hands, he thrust downward with all his strength and  weight. The blade sank into the man's body--through his body into the  earth; Captain Madwell came near falling forward upon his work. The  dying man drew up his knees and at the same time threw his right arm  across his breast and grasped the steel so tightly that the knuckles of  the hand visibly whitened. By a violent but vain effort to withdraw the  blade the wound was enlarged; a rill of blood escaped, running sinuously  down into the deranged clothing. At that moment three men stepped  silently forward from behind the clump of young trees which had  concealed their approach. Two were hospital attendants and carried a  stretcher.    The third was Major Creede Halcrow.

A song of praise to God from Great Britain.    1 Nature with all her powers shall sing  God the Creator and the King;  Nor air, nor earth, nor skies, nor seas  Deny the tribute of their praise.    2 [Begin to make his glories known,  Ye seraphs that sit near his throne;  Tune your harps high, and spread the sound  To the creation's utmost bound.    3 All mortal things of meaner frame,  Exert your force and own his Name;  Whilst with our souls and with our voice  We sing his honours and our joys.]    4 [To him be sacred all we have  From the young cradle to the grave:  Our lips shall his loud wonders tell,  And every word a miracle.]    5 [This northern isle, our native land,  Lies safe in God th' Almighty's hand:  Our foes of victory dream in vain,  And wear the captivating chain.    6 He builds and guards the British throne,  And makes it gracious like his own,  Makes our successive princes kind,  And gives our dangers to the wind.]    7 Raise monumental praises high  To him that thunders thro' the sky,  And with an awful nod or frown  Shakes an aspiring tyrant down.    8 [Pillars of lasting brass proclaim  The triumphs of th' eternal Name;  While trembling nations read from far  The honours of the God of war.]    9 Thus let our flaming zeal employ  Our loftiest thoughts and loudest songs  Britain pronounce with warmest joy  Hosanna from ten thousand tongues.    10 Yet, mighty God, our feeble frame  Attempts in vain to reach thy Name;  The strongest notes that angels raise  Faint in the worship and the praise.      Hymn 2:2.  The death of a sinner.    1 My thoughts on awful subjects roll,  Damnation and the dead;  What horrors seize the guilty soul  Upon a dying bed!    2 Lingering about these mortal shores,  She makes a long delay,  Till like a flood with rapid force  Death sweeps the wretch away.    3 Then swift and dreadful she descends  Down to the fiery coast,  Amongst abominable fiends,  Herself a frightful ghost.    4 There endless crowds of sinners lie,  And darkness makes their chains;  Tortur'd with keen despair they cry,  Yet wait for fiercer pains.    5 Not all their anguish and their blood  For their old guilt atones,  Nor the compassions of a God  Shall hearken to their groans.    6 Amazing grace, that kept my breath,  Nor bid my soul remove,  Till I had learn'd my Saviour's death,  And well insur'd his love!      Hymn 2:3.  The death and burial of a saint.    1 Why do we mourn departing friends  Or shake at death's alarms?  'Tis but the voice that Jesus sends  To call them to his arms.    2 Are we not tending upward too  As fast as time can move?  Nor would we wish the hours more slow  To keep us from our love.    3 Why should we tremble to convey  Their bodies to the tomb?  There the dear flesh of Jesus lay,  And left a long perfume.    4 The graves of all his saints he bless'd,  And soften'd every bed;  Where should the dying members rest,  But with the dying head?    5 Thence he arose, ascending high,  And shew'd our feet the way;  Up to the Lord our flesh shall fly  At the great rising day.    6 Then let the last loud trumpet sound,  And bid our kindred rise,  Awake, ye nations under ground,  Ye saints, ascend the skies.      Hymn 2:4.  Salvation in the cross.    1 Here at thy cross, my dying God,  I lay my soul beneath thy love,  Beneath the droppings of thy blood,  Jesus, nor shall it e'er remove.    2 Not all that tyrants think or say,  With rage and lightning in their eyes,  Nor hell shall fright my heart away,  Should hell with all its legions rise.    3 Should worlds conspire to drive me thence,  Moveless and firm this heart should lie;  Resolv'd (for that's my last defence)  If I must perish, there to die.    4 But speak, my Lord, and calm my fear,  Am I not safe beneath thy, shade?  Thy vengeance will not strike me here,  Nor Satan dares my soul invade.    5 Yes, I'm secure beneath thy blood,  And all my foes shall lose their aim,  Hosanna to my dying God,  And my best honours to his Name.      Hymn 2:5.  Longing to praise Christ better.    1 Lord, when my thoughts with wonder roll  O'er the sharp sorrows of thy soul,  And read my Maker's broken laws  Repair'd and honour'd by thy cross;    2 When I behold death, hell and sin,  Vanquish'd by that dear blood of thine,  And see the man that groan'd and dy'd  Sit glorious by his Father's side;    3 My passions rise and soar above,  I'm wing'd with faith and fir'd with love;  Fain would I reach eternal things,  And learn the notes that Gabriel sings.    4 But my heart fails, my tongue complains,  For want of their immortal strains;  And in such humble notes as these  Must fall below thy victories.    5 Well, the kind minute must appear  When we shall leave these bodies here,  These clogs of clay, and mount on high,  To join the songs above the sky.      Hymn 2:6.  A morning song.    1 Once more, my soul, the rising day  Salutes thy waking eyes.  Once more, my voice, thy tribute pay  To him that rolls the skies.    2 Night unto night his name repeats,  The day renews the sound,  Wide as the heaven on which he sits  To turn the seasons round.    3 'Tis he supports my mortal frame,  My tongue shall speak his praise;  My sins would rouse his wrath to flame,  And yet his wrath delays.    4 On a poor worm thy power might tread,  And I could ne'er withstand;  Thy justice might have crush'd me"]]]
