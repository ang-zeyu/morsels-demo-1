The following method is preferred by some because  it leaves more of the natural color in the preserves:    To two pounds of washed, capped and stemmed strawberries add  twenty-six ounces sugar; let stand over-night. In the morning pour  juice thus obtained into a preserving kettle, add berries and cook to  222 degrees Fahrenheit, or until the sirup is very heavy. Pack and  sterilize, as in Recipe Number 1. These recipes can be used for all  other berries.    When wet weather makes strawberries too soft or sandy for the table,  they are still useful for making \"strawberry acid,\" a thick sirup  which, mixed with water, ice and perhaps spearmint, makes a cooling  summer drink.    Strawberries--Sun Preserves. Select firm ripe berries; hull and  rinse. Place them in a shallow platter in a single layer; sprinkle  sugar over them. Pour over them a thick sirup made of one quart of  water and eleven pounds of sugar, boiled until very thick.    Cover them with a glass dish or a plain window glass. Allow them to  stand in the hot sun eight to twelve hours. Pack them in jelly glasses  and cover with paraffin or put in regular glass jars or tin cans. Put  the rubber and cap in position, not tight. Cap and tip or seal if  using enameled tin cans. Sterilize for the length of time given below  for the particular type of outfit used:                                                   MINUTES    Hot-water bath, homemade or commercial          20    Water seal, 214 degrees                         15    Steam pressure                                  10    Remove the jars, tighten the covers, invert the jars to cool, and test  the joint. Wrap the jars in paper to prevent bleaching.    When using steam-pressure or pressure-cooking outfit on preserves,  remember to keep the valve open during the sterilizing.      SPECIAL DIRECTIONS FOR JELLY AND JAM MAKING    Apples vary in the percentage of sugar and acid they contain; a fine  flavored acid apple should be used when possible. Winter apples are  best for jelly making. If necessary to make apple jelly in the spring,  add juice of 1 lemon to every pint of apple juice.    Apricots are delicious combined with pineapple.    Blackberries, elderberries and loganberries make delicious juices and  shrubs for summer beverages.    The total time of making blueberry jelly need not exceed 10 minutes.    Cranberries are not always put through a jelly bag, but are rubbed  through a sieve.    Cherries are most delicious if preserved in the sun. A good  combination for preserves is equal parts of cherries and strawberries.    Crab apples can be combined with some juices, such as peach, pear and  pineapple, to furnish necessary pectin.    One-half currants and one-half raspberries make a delicious jelly;  currants are in best condition for jelly making from June 28 to July  3.    Black currant jam is considered quite a delicacy these days.    Acid grapes are best for jelly; sweet, ripe grapes contain too much  sugar. Equal portions ripe and green grapes are satisfactory.    If gooseberries are fully ripe they make finer-flavored jam than do  green-as-grass gooseberries.    Some women are successful in making peach jelly, but be sure to test  for pectin before completing the process, to save time and effort.    Pineapple is best canned alone or used as foundation for conserves.    An underripe, acid plum is best.    Plums and apples combined make an excellent tasting jelly.    Quince parings are often used for jelly, the better part of the fruit  being used for preserving.    Raspberries and other berries should not be gathered after a rain, for  they will have absorbed so much water as to make it difficult, without  excessive boiling, to get the juice to \"jell.\"    Rhubarb is an excellent foundation for the more expensive fruit. It  will take the flavor of other fruits and thus we can make an otherwise  expensive jam \"go a long way.\"    Strawberries combine well with other fruits and can be utilized in  many ways.    Select sour, smooth-skinned oranges.    Lemon Marmalade. After the 9 oranges and 6 lemons are sliced, put in  kettle; add 4 quarts water, cover and let stand 36 hours; then boil 2  hours. Add 8 pounds sugar and boil one hour longer.    Grapefruit used alone is bitter. Oranges or lemons or both are  usually combined with grapefruit.    All wild fruits or berries used for jelly making must be fresh and not  overripe. Barberry jelly is firmer and of better color if made from  fruit picked before the frost comes, while some of the berries are  still green.

that the calling it an       enforcement of the Revenue Laws appeared to me to increase       the gravity of the measure, for it placed Foreign Powers in       the dilemma of recognizing the Southern Confederation or of       submitting to the interruption of their commerce[99].\"    Lyons' advice to Russell was that no rebuff should be given the Southern  Commissioners when they arrived in London, but that they be treated  well. This, he thought, might open Seward's eyes to his folly. Still  Lyons did not yet fully believe that Seward would be so vigorous as his  language seemed to imply, and on March 29 he wrote that \"prudent  counsels\" were in the ascendant, that there would be no interference  with trade \"_at present_,\" and that a quieter tone was everywhere  perceptible in Washington[100].    From the point of view of the British Minister at Washington, the  danger spot in relations between the United States and Great Britain lay  in this matter of interference with trade to Southern ports. Naturally,  and as in duty bound, he sought to preserve that trade. At first,  indeed, he seems to have thought that even though a civil war really  ensued the trade might continue uninterrupted. Certainly he bore hard  and constantly on this one point, seeking to influence not only  officials at Washington but the public press. Thus, in a letter to Bunch  dated April 12, 1861, at a time when he knew that W.H. Russell, the  _Times_ correspondent, would shortly appear in Charleston, he instructed  Bunch to remember that in talking to Russell he must especially impress  him with the idea that any interruption of trade might and probably  would result in a British recognition of the South. Lyons wrote, \"...  the _only_ chance, if chance there still be of preventing an  interruption of the English commerce with the S. is the fear entertained  here, that it would lead to our recognizing the S.C.[101]\" In these  words is revealed, however, as in other communications from Lyons, the  fact that he was striving to prevent an interruption of trade rather  than that he was convinced such interruption ought to result in a  British recognition of the South. Indeed, as will be seen, when the  blockade was at last declared, Lyons thought it no cause for recognition  and was most tolerant of its early ineffectiveness.    While Lyons was thus keeping in close touch with Seward, the relations  between England and America at London were exceedingly meagre. All that  the American Minister Dallas knew of Russell's intentions is summed up  in his despatches to Seward of March 22 and April 9, 1861[102]. On the  former date, he gave an account of an interview with Russell in which  the latter simply refused to pledge himself against a recognition of  the Confederacy; in the latter, presenting a long memorial written by  Seward to all of the larger European Governments arguing in friendly  spirit the cause of the North, Dallas reported that he drew from Russell  merely a general expression of England's kindly feeling towards the  United States and her hope that there might still be a peaceful  solution. Russell again refused to make any pledge in regard to English  policy. In this interview it was tacitly agreed that it would be better  for Great Britain to await Adams' arrival before taking any definite  action, or so at least Dallas understood Russell--though the latter  later denied that any pledge of delay was given. There is no doubt,  however, that in Russell's mind, whatever he might say to Dallas, the  separation in America was an accomplished fact and the hope of Great  Britain was centred upon the idea of a peaceful separation.    Up to and including April 1, indeed, Lyons had been reporting that no  definite stand was yet being taken by the American Government. At the  same time Russell was continuing his instructions to Lyons to recommend  conciliation \"but never to obtrude advice unasked[103].\" Yet Russell was  not wholly undisturbed by the reports of Seward's quarrelsome attitude,  for in a private letter of the same date as the preceding, he wrote to  Lyons, \"I rely upon your wisdom, patience, and prudence, to steer us  through the dangers of this crisis. If it can possibly be helped Mr.  Seward must not be allowed to get us into a quarrel. I shall see the  Southerners when they come, but not officially, and keep them at a  proper distance[104].\" It is an interesting query, whether this fear  thus expressed of Seward's temper was not of distinct benefit to the  United States at the moment when the Southern Commissioners arrived in  England. The inference would seem to be clear, that in spite of Lyons'  advice to treat them well, the effect upon Russell of Seward's attitude  was to treat them coolly. Russell was indeed distinctly worried by  Seward's unfriendly attitude.    In the meantime the British press and public, while still uncertain and  divided as to the merits of the conflict were now substantially a unit  in accepting separation as final. The _Times_, with judicial ponderosity  declared: \"The new nationality has been brought forth after a very short  period of gestation.... and the Seceding States have now constituted  themselves a nation[105] ...\" At the other end of the scale in newspaper  \"tone,\" the _London Press_ jeered at the Northern American eagle as  having \"had his tail pulled out and his wings clipped--yet the meek bird  now holds out his claws to be pared, with a resignation that would be  degrading in the most henpecked of domestic fowls[106].\" Having now  veered about to expressions of confidence in the permanency of the  Southern Confederacy the _Times_ was also compelled to alter its opinion  of Southern Statesmen. An editorial gave high praise to the Confederate  Congress sitting at Montgomery, stated its personnel to be far superior  to that of the Congress at Washington, yet was unable to resist making  the customary reference to manners traditionally American;         \"With regard to the Congress itself, we cannot refrain from       quoting the _naive_ testimony of a visitor in its favour.       'Gentlemen here [Montgomery] who have spent much time in       Washington city declare that they have never witnessed such       industry, care, propriety, courtesy, and pleasant       Congressional action. _Not one member has appeared in his       seat under the influence of liquors or wines_, not a harsh       word has been uttered in debate, and all exhibit the most       unflagging energy and determination[107].'\"    The most of the British press quickly followed the lead of the _Times_,  forgot its previous dictum that the South was in the control of  \"ignorant ruffians,\" and dilated upon the statemanlike directness and  sagacity of Southern leaders as contrasted with the stupidity of the  North, displayed in its tariff policy[108]. A few journals thought that  the North might eventually win in a prolonged struggle but that such a  victory would be disastrous to the principles of federalism[109], and,  in any case, that this civil war was one without \"a noble cause to  sustain either side[110].\" By May nearly all the older journals were  aligned on the right of the South to secede, and on the fact of a  successful secession, though still differing as to the basic causes and  essential justice involved. In this same month, however, there emerged a  few vigorous champions of the Northern cause and prospects. In April the  _Spectator_ agreed that the Great Republic was at an end[111]; in May it  urged the North to fight it out with hope, asserting a chance of  ultimate victory because of superior resources and the sympathy of all  European nations[112]. A small newspaper of limited circulation, the  _Morning Star_, organ of John Bright, had from the first championed the  Northern cause. Now, as the armed conflict broke in America, it was  joined by a more important paper, the _Daily News_, which set itself the  task of controverting the _Times_. Moreover the _Daily News_ was all the  more influential in that it was not uncritical of the North, yet  consistently, throughout the war, expressed sympathy for the cause and  principles behind the efforts of the Northern Government. Selling for a  low price, twopence-halfpenny, the _Daily News_, like the _Westminster_  among the Reviews, appealed to a broader and more popular constituency  than the older publications, especially to a constituency not yet vocal,  since still unrepresented, in Parliament[113].    The _Daily News_ was fortunate in having, after 1862, the best-informed  New York correspondent writing to the London press. This was an  Irishman, E.L. Godkin, who, both at home and in America, was the  intimate friend of literary men, and himself, later, a great moulder of  public opinion[114]. Harriet Martineau further aided the _Daily News_ by  contributing pro-Northern articles, and was a power in Radical  circles[115]. But literary England in general, was slow to express  itself with conviction, though Robert Browning, by April, 1861, was  firmly determined in his pro-Northern sentiment. In August he was  writing in letters of the \"good cause[116].\" But Browning was a rare  exception and it was not until the Civil War had been under way for many  months that men of talent in the non-political world were drawn to make  comment or to take sides. Their influence at the outset was  negligible[117].    In spite of press utterances, or literary silence, alike indicative of  a widespread conviction that Southern independence was assured, there  still remained both in those circles where anti-slavery sentiment was  strong, and in others more neutral in sympathy, a distaste for the  newly-born State as the embodiment of a degrading institution.
