I gave credit to his statement. He asked  the loan of a black-metal pot to cook with, as theirs of pottery are  brittle. I gave it and a handful of salt, and desired him to send back  two tit-bits, the proboscis and fore-foot of the elephant. He set off,  and I heard nothing more until we saw the Bakwains carrying home their  wounded, and heard some of the women uttering the loud wail of sorrow  for the dead, and others pealing forth the clear scream of victory. It  was then clear that Sechele had attacked and driven away the rebel.    Mentioning this to the commandant in proof of the impossibility of  granting his request, I had soon an example how quickly a story can grow  among idle people. The five guns were, within one month, multiplied into  a tale of five hundred, and the cooking-pot, now in a museum at Cape  Town, was magnified into a cannon; \"I had myself confessed to the loan.\"  Where the five hundred guns came from, it was easy to divine; for,  knowing that I used a sextant, my connection with government was a  thing of course; and, as I must know all her majesty's counsels, I was  questioned on the subject of the indistinct rumors which had reached  them of Lord Rosse's telescope. \"What right has your government to  set up that large glass at the Cape to look after us behind the Cashan  Mountains?\"    Many of the Boers visited us afterward at Kolobeng, some for medical  advice, and others to trade in those very articles which their own laws  and policy forbid. When I happened to stumble upon any of them in the  town, with his muskets and powder displayed, he would begin an apology,  on the ground that he was a poor man, etc., which I always cut short by  frankly saying that I had nothing to do with either the Boers or their  laws. Many attempts were made during these visits to elicit the truth  about the guns and cannon; and ignorant of the system of espionage which  prevails, eager inquiries were made by them among those who could jabber  a little Dutch. It is noticeable that the system of espionage is as well  developed among the savage tribes as in Austria or Russia. It is a proof  of barbarism. Every man in a tribe feels himself bound to tell the  chief every thing that comes to his knowledge, and, when questioned by  a stranger, either gives answers which exhibit the utmost stupidity, or  such as he knows will be agreeable to his chief. I believe that in this  way have arisen tales of their inability to count more than ten, as  was asserted of the Bechuanas about the very time when Sechele's father  counted out one thousand head of cattle as a beginning of the stock of  his young son.    In the present case, Sechele, knowing every question put to his people,  asked me how they ought to answer. My reply was, \"Tell the truth.\" Every  one then declared that no cannon existed there; and our friends, judging  the answer by what they themselves would in the circumstances have  said, were confirmed in the opinion that the Bakwains actually possessed  artillery. This was in some degree beneficial to us, inasmuch as fear  prevented any foray in our direction for eight years. During that time  no winter passed without one or two tribes in the East country being  plundered of both cattle and children by the Boers. The plan pursued  is the following: one or two friendly tribes are forced to accompany a  party of mounted Boers, and these expeditions can be got up only in the  winter, when horses may be used without danger of being lost by disease.  When they reach the tribe to be attacked, the friendly natives are  ranged in front, to form, as they say, \"a shield\"; the Boers then coolly  fire over their heads till the devoted people flee and leave cattle,  wives, and children to the captors. This was done in nine cases during  my residence in the interior, and on no occasion was a drop of Boer's  blood shed. News of these deeds spread quickly among the Bakwains, and  letters were repeatedly sent by the Boers to Sechele, ordering him to  come and surrender himself as their vassal, and stop English traders  from proceeding into the country with fire-arms for sale. But the  discovery of Lake Ngami, hereafter to be described, made the traders  come in five-fold greater numbers, and Sechele replied, \"I was made an  independent chief and placed here by God, and not by you. I was never  conquered by Mosilikatze, as those tribes whom you rule over; and the  English are my friends. I get every thing I wish from them. I can not  hinder them from going where they like.\" Those who are old enough to  remember the threatened invasion of our own island may understand the  effect which the constant danger of a Boerish invasion had on the  minds of the Bakwains; but no others can conceive how worrying were the  messages and threats from the endless self-constituted authorities of  the Magaliesberg Boers; and when to all this harassing annoyance was  added the scarcity produced by the drought, we could not wonder at,  though we felt sorry for, their indisposition to receive instruction.    The myth of the black pot assumed serious proportions. I attempted to  benefit the tribes among the Boers of Magaliesberg by placing native  teachers at different points. \"You must teach the blacks,\" said Mr.  Hendrick Potgeiter, the commandant in chief, \"that they are not equal  to us.\" Other Boers told me, \"I might as well teach the baboons on the  rocks as the Africans,\" but declined the test which I proposed, namely,  to examine whether they or my native attendants could read best. Two of  their clergymen came to baptize the children of the Boers; so, supposing  these good men would assist me in overcoming the repugnance of their  flock to the education of the blacks, I called on them; but my visit  ended in a 'ruse' practiced by the Boerish commandant, whereby I was  led, by professions of the greatest friendship, to retire to Kolobeng,  while a letter passed me by another way to the other missionaries in  the south, demanding my instant recall \"for lending a cannon to their  enemies.\" The colonial government was also gravely informed that the  story was true, and I came to be looked upon as a most suspicious  character in consequence.    These notices of the Boers are not intended to produce a sneer at their  ignorance, but to excite the compassion of their friends. They are  perpetually talking about their laws; but practically theirs is only the  law of the strongest. The Bechuanas could never understand the changes  which took place in their commandants. \"Why, one can never know who is  the chief among these Boers. Like the Bushmen, they have no king--they  must be the Bushmen of the English.\" The idea that any tribe of men  could be so senseless as not to have an hereditary chief was so absurd  to these people, that, in order not to appear equally stupid, I was  obliged to tell them that we English were so anxious to preserve the  royal blood, that we had made a young lady our chief. This seemed to  them a most convincing proof of our sound sense. We shall see farther on  the confidence my account of our queen inspired.    The Boers, encouraged by the accession of Mr. Pretorius, determined at  last to put a stop to English traders going past Kolobeng, by dispersing  the tribe of Bakwains, and expelling all the missionaries. Sir George  Cathcart proclaimed the independence of the Boers, the best thing that  could have been done had they been between us and the Caffres. A treaty  was entered into with these Boers; an article for the free passage of  Englishmen to the country beyond, and also another, that no slavery  should be allowed in the independent territory, were duly inserted, as  expressive of the views of her majesty's government at home. \"But what  about the missionaries?\" inquired the Boers. \"YOU MAY DO AS YOU PLEASE  WITH THEM,\" is said to have been the answer of the \"Commissioner\". This  remark, if uttered at all, was probably made in joke: designing men,  however, circulated it, and caused the general belief in its accuracy  which now prevails all over the country, and doubtless led to the  destruction of three mission stations immediately after. The Boers, four  hundred in number, were sent by the late Mr. Pretorius to attack the  Bakwains in 1852. Boasting that the English had given up all the blacks  into their power, and had agreed to aid them in their subjugation by  preventing all supplies of ammunition from coming into the Bechuana  country, they assaulted the Bakwains, and, besides killing a  considerable number of adults, carried off two hundred of our school  children into slavery. The natives under Sechele defended themselves  till the approach of night enabled them to flee to the mountains; and  having in that defense killed a number of the enemy, the very first  ever slain in this country by Bechuanas, I received the credit of having  taught the tribe to kill Boers! My house, which had stood perfectly  secure for years under the protection of the natives, was plundered in  revenge. English gentlemen, who had come in the footsteps of Mr. Cumming  to hunt in the country beyond, and had deposited large quantities of  stores in the same keeping, and upward of eighty head of cattle as  relays for the return journeys, were robbed of all, and, when they came  back to Kolobeng, found the skeletons of the guardians strewed all over  the place. The books of a good library--my solace in our solitude--were  not taken away, but handfuls of the leaves were torn out and scattered  over the place. My stock of medicines was smashed; and all our furniture  and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10430"],[0,"Trips to the Moon (#14)"],[1,"rivers, and at the mouth of them stood, as porter, Timon of  Athens.  By the assistance, however, of our guide, Nauplius, we  proceeded, and saw several punished, {135a} as well kings as private  persons, and amongst these some of our old acquaintance; we saw  Cinyrus, {135b} hung up and roasting there.  Our guides gave us the  history of several of them, and told us what they were punished for;  those, we observed, suffered most severely who in their lifetimes  had told lies, or written what was not true, amongst whom were  Ctesias the Cnidian, Herodotus, and many others.  When I saw these I  began to conceive good hopes of hereafter, as I am not conscious of  ever having told a story.    Not able to bear any longer such melancholy spectacles, we took our  leave of Nauplius, and returned to our ship.  In a short time after  we had a view, but confused and indistinct, of the Island of Dreams,  which itself was not unlike a dream, for as we approached towards  it, it seemed as it were to retire and fly from us.  At last,  however, we got up to it, and entered the harbour, which is called  Hypnus, {136a} near the ivory gates, where there is a harbour  dedicated to the cock. {136b}  We landed late in the evening, and  saw several dreams of various kinds.  I propose, however, at  present, to give you an account of the place itself, which nobody  has ever written about, except Homer, whose description is very  imperfect.    Round the island is a very thick wood; the trees are all tall  poppies, or mandragorae, {136c} in which are a great number of bats;  for these are the only birds they have here; there is likewise a  river which they call Nyctiporus, {136d} and round the gates two  fountains:  the name of one is Negretos, {137a} and of the other  Pannychia. {137b}  The city has a high wall, of all the colours of  the rainbow.  It has not two gates, as Homer {137c} tells us, but  four; two of which look upon the plain of Indolence, one made of  iron, the other of brick; through these are said to pass all the  dreams that are frightful, bloody, and melancholy; the other two,  fronting the sea and harbour, one of horn, the other, which we came  through, of ivory; on the right hand, as you enter the city, is the  temple of Night, who, together with the cock, is the principal  object of worship amongst them.  This is near the harbour; on the  left is the palace of Somnus, for he is their sovereign, and under  him are two viceroys, Taraxion, {138a} the son of Mataeogenes, and  Plutocles, {138b} the son of Phantasion.  In the middle of the  market-place stands a fountain, which they call Careotis, {138c} and  two temples of Truth and Falsehood; there is an oracle here, at  which Antiphon presides as high-priest; he is inventor of the  dreams, an honourable employment, which Somnus bestowed upon him.    The dreams themselves are of different kinds, some long, beautiful,  and pleasant, others little and ugly; there are likewise some golden  ones, others poor and mean; some winged and of an immense size,  others tricked out as it were for pomps and ceremonies, for gods and  kings; some we met with that we had seen at home; these came up to  and saluted us as their old acquaintance, whilst others putting us  first to sleep, treated us most magnificently, and promised that  they would make us kings and noblemen:  some carried us into our own  country, showed us our friends and relations, and brought us back  again the same day.  Thirty days and nights we remained in this  place, being most luxuriously feasted, and fast asleep all the time,  when we were suddenly awaked by a violent clap of thunder, and  immediately ran to our ship, put in our stores, and set sail.  In  three days we reached the island of Ogygia.  Before we landed, I  broke open the letter, and read the contents, which were as follows:    ULYSSES TO CALYPSO.    \"This comes to inform you, that after my departure from your coasts  in the vessel which you were so kind as to provide me with, I was  shipwrecked, and saved with the greatest difficulty by Leucothea,  who conveyed me to the country of the Phaeacians, and from thence I  got home; where I found a number of suitors about my wife, revelling  there at my expense.  I destroyed every one of them, and was  afterwards slain myself by Telegonus, a son whom I had by Circe.  I  still lament the pleasures which I left behind at Ogygia, and the  immortality which you promised me; if I can ever find an  opportunity, I will certainly make my escape from hence, and come to  you.\"    This was the whole of the epistle except, that at the end of it he  recommended us to her protection.    On our landing, at a little distance from the sea, I found the cave,  as described by Homer, and in it Calypso, spinning; she took the  letter, put it in her bosom, and wept; then invited us to sit down,  and treated us magnificently.  She then asked us several questions  about Ulysses, and inquired whether Penelope was handsome and as  chaste as Ulysses had reported her to be.  We answered her in such a  manner as we thought would please her best; and then returning to  our ship, slept on board close to the shore.    In the morning, a brisk gale springing up, we set sail.  For two  days we were tossed about in a storm; the third drove us on the  pirates of Colocynthos.  These are a kind of savages from the  neighbouring islands, who commit depredations on all that sail that  way.  They have large ships made out of gourds, six cubits long;  when the fruit is dry, they hollow and work it into this shape,  using reeds for masts, and making their sails out of the leaves of  the plant.  They joined the crews of two ships and attacked us,  wounding many of us with cucumber seeds, which they threw instead of  stones.  After fighting some time without any material advantage on  either side, about noon we saw just behind them some of the  Caryonautae, {141a} whom we found to be avowed enemies to the  Colocynthites, {141b} who, on their coming up, immediately quitted  us, and fell upon them.  We hoisted our sail, and got off, leaving  them to fight it out by themselves; the Caryonautae were most  probably the conquerors, as they were more in number, for they had  five ships, which besides were stronger and better built than those  of the enemy, being made of the shells of nuts cut in two, and  hollowed, every half-nut being fifty paces long.  As soon as we got  out of their sight, we took care of our wounded men, and from that  time were obliged to be always armed and prepared in case of sudden  attack.  We had too much reason to fear, for scarce was the sun set  when we saw about twenty men from a desert island advancing towards  us, each on the back of a large dolphin.  These were pirates also:  the dolphins carried them very safely, and seemed pleased with their  burden, neighing like horses.  When they came up, they stood at a  little distance, and threw dried cuttle-fish and crabs'-eyes at us;  but we, in return, attacking them with our darts and arrows, many of  them were wounded; and, unable to stand it any longer, they  retreated to the island.    In the middle of the night, the sea being quite calm, we  unfortunately struck upon a halcyon's nest, of an immense size,  being about sixty stadia in circumference; the halcyon was sitting  upon it, and was herself not much less; as she flew off, she was  very near oversetting our ship with the wind of her wings, and, as  she went, made a most hideous groaning.  As soon as it was day we  took a view of the nest, which was like a great ship, and built of  trees; in it were five hundred eggs, each of them longer than a  hogshead of Chios.  We could hear the young ones croaking within;  so, with a hatchet we broke one of the eggs, and took the chicken  out unfledged; it was bigger than twenty vultures put together.    When we were got about two hundred stadia from the nest, we met with  some surprising prodigies.  A cheniscus came, and sitting on the  prow of our ship, clapped his wings and made a noise.  Our pilot  Scintharus had been bald for many years, when on a sudden his hair  came again.  But what was still more wonderful, the mast of our ship  sprouted out, sent forth several branches, and bore fruit at the top  of it, large figs, and grapes not quite ripe.  We were greatly  astonished, as you may suppose, and prayed most devoutly to the gods  to avert the evil which was portended.    We had not gone above five hundred stadia farther before we saw an  immensely large and thick wood of pines and cypresses; we took it  for a tract of land, but it was all a deep sea, planted with trees  that had no root, which stood, however, unmoved, upright, and, as it  were, swimming in it.  Approaching near to it, we began to consider  what we could do best.  There was no sailing between the trees,  which were close together, nor did we know how to get back.  I got  upon one of the highest of them, to see how far they reached, and  perceived that they continued for about fifty stadia or more, and  beyond that it was all sea again; we resolved therefore to drag the  ship up to the top boughs, which were very thick, and so convey it  along, which, by fixing a great rope to it, with no little toil and  difficulty, we performed; got it up, spread our sails, and were  driven on by the wind.  It put me in mind of that verse of  Antimachus the poet, where he says--         \"The ship sailed smoothly through the sylvan sea.\"    We at length got over the wood, and, letting our ship down in the  same manner, fell into smooth clear water, till we came to a horrid  precipice, hollow and deep, resembling the cavity made by an  earthquake.  We furled our sails, or should soon have been swallowed  up in it.  Stooping forward, and looking down, we beheld a gulf of  at least a thousand stadia deep, a most dreadful and amazing sight,  for the sea as it were was split in two.  Looking towards our right  hand, however,"]]]
