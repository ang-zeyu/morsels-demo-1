And this would have been to cause the monsters to search the youths out  to their destruction, and maybe even to awaken the Forces to work them  some dread Spiritual harm, which was the chief Fear.    Now, presently, through all the cities of the Great Redoubt, the news  had gone how that five hundred foolish Youths had adventured out into  the despair of the Night Land; and the whole Pyramid waked to life, and  the Peoples of the South came to the Northern sides, for the Great Gate  lay in the North-West side; and the Youths had made from there, not  straightly outwards, but towards the North; and so were to be seen from  the North-East embrasures, and from those within the North-West wall.    And thus, in a while were they watched by all the mighty multitudes of  the Great Pyramid, through millions of spy-glasses; for each human had a  spying-glass, as may be thought; and some were an hundred years old, and  some, maybe ten thousand, and handed down through many generations; and  some but newly made, and very strange. But all those people had some  instrument by which they might spy out upon the wonder of the Night  Land; for so had it been ever through all the eternity of darkness, and  a great diversion and wonder of life was it to behold the monsters about  their work; and to know that they plotted always to our destruction; yet  were ever foiled.    And never did all that great and terrible Land grow stale upon the soul  of any, from birth until death; and by this you shall know the constant  wonder of it, and that _sense of enemies in the night about us,_ which  ever filled the heart and spirit of all Beholders; so that never were  the embrasures utterly empty.    Yet, many beheld not the Land from the embrasures; but sat about the  View-Tables, which were set properly in certain places throughout the  cities, and so beheld the Night Land, without undue cranings, or poising  of spy-glasses, though less plain-seen. And these same tables were some  form of that which we of this age name Camera Obscura; but made very  great, and with inventions, and low to the floor, so that ten thousand  people might sit about them in the raised galleries, and have  comfortable sight. Yet this attracted not the young people, save they  were lovers; and then, in truth, were they comfortable seats for  quietness and gentle whisperings.    Yet now, as may be supposed, with all the Peoples of the Mighty Pyramid  grown eager to look towards one part of the Night Land, the embrasures  were hid in the crowds; and such as could gain no view therethrough,  thronged about the View-Tables. And so was it in all the hours of  leisure; so that women had scarce patience to attend their children; but  must hasten to watch again, that lonesome band of foolish youths making  so blind and unshaped a trial to come upon that unknown Lesser Redoubt,  somewhere out in all the night of the world.    And in this wise passed three days and nights; yet both in the  sleep-time and the time of waking did great multitudes cease not to  watch; so that many went hungry for sleep, as in truth did I. And  sometimes we saw those Youths with plainness; but other times they were  lost to our sight in the utter shadows of the Night Land. Yet, by the  telling of our instruments, and the sense of my hearing, there was no  awaredness among the Monsters, and the Forces of Evil, that any were  abroad from the Pyramid; so that a little hope came into our hearts that  yet there might be no tragedy.    And times, would they cease from their way, and sit about in circles  among the shadows and the grey moss-bushes, which grew hardly here or  there about. And we knew that they had food with them to eat; for this  could we see with plainness, as some odd, grim flare of light from the  infernal fires struck upon one or another strangely, and passed, and  left them in the darkness.    And who of you shall conceive what was in the hearts of the fathers, and  the mothers that bore the youths, and who never ceased away from the  Northward embrasures; but spied out in terror and in tears, and maybe  oft with so good glasses as did show them the very features and look  upon the face of son and son.    And the kin of the watchers brought to them food, and tended them, so  that they had no need to cease from their watching; and beds were made  in the embrasures, rough and resourceful, that they might sleep quickly  a little; yet be ever ready, if those cruel Monsters without made  discovery of those their children.    Thrice in those three days of journeying to the Northward, did the  Youths sleep, and we perceived that some kept a watch, and so knew that  there was a kind of order and leadership among them; also, they had each  his weapon upon his hip, and this gave to us a further plea to hope.    And concerning this same carrying of weapons, I can but set out here  that no healthful male or female in all the Mighty Pyramid but possessed  such a weapon, and was trained to it from childhood; so that a ripe and  extraordinary skill in the use thereof was common to most. Yet some  breaking of Rule had there been, that the Youths had each achieved to be  armed; for the weapons were stored in every tenth house of the cities,  in the care of the charging-masters.    And here I must make known that these weapons did not shoot; but had a  disk of grey metal, sharp and wonderful, that spun in the end of a rod  of grey metal, and were someways charged by the Earth-Current, so that  were any but stricken thereby, they were cut in twain so easy as aught.  And the weapons were contrived to the repelling of any Army of Monsters  that might make to win entrance to the Redoubt. And to the eye they had  somewhat the look of strange battle-axes, and might be lengthened by the  pulling out of the handles.    Now, the Youths made, as I have told, to the Northward; but had first to  keep a long way to the North-East, that they might come clear of the  Vale of Red Fire. And this wise they journeyed, and kept the Vale about  seven miles to the North-West of them, and so were presently beyond the  Watcher of the North-East, and going with a greater freedom, and having  less care to hide.    And this way, it may be, certain of the giants, wandering, perceived  them, and went swiftly to make attack and destroy them. But some order  went about among the youths, and they made a long line, with a certain  space between each, because of the terror of their weapon, and  immediately, it seemed, the Giants were upon them, a score and seven  they were, and seeming to be haired like to mighty crabs, as I saw with  the Great Spy-Glass, when the great flares of far and mighty fires threw  their fierce light across the Dark Lands.    And there was a very great and horrid fight; for the Youths broke into  circles about each of the Giants, and many of those young men were torn  in pieces; but they smote the Monsters from behind and upon every side,  and we of the Mighty Pyramid could behold at times the grey, strange  gleam of their weapons; and the jether was stirred about me by the  passing of those that died; yet, by reason of the great miles, their  screams came not to us, neither heard we the roars of the Monsters; but  into our hearts, even from that great distance and safety, there stole  the terror of those awesome Brutes; and in the Great Spy-Glass I could  behold the great joints and limbs and e'en, I thought, the foul sweat of  them; and their size and brutishness was like to that of odd and  monstrous animals of the olden world; yet part human. And it must be  borne to mind that the Fathers and the Mothers of those Youths beheld  all this dread fight from the embrasures, and their other kin likewise  watched, and a very drear sight was it to their hearts and their human,  natural feelings, and like to breed old age, ere its due.    Then, in a time, the fight ceased; for of those seven and twenty Giant  Brutes there remained none; only that there cumbered the ground seven  and twenty lumbering hillocks, dreadful and grim. For the lesser dead we  could not see proper.    And we that were within the Pyramid saw the Youths sorted together by  their leaders, all in the dim twilight of that place; and with the Great  Spy-Glass I made a rough count, and found that there lived of them,  three hundred; and by this shall you know the power of those few  monstrous things, which had slain full two hundred, though each youth  was armed with so wondrous a weapon. And I set the word through the  Pyramid, that all might have some knowledge of the number that had  died; for it was better to know, than to be in doubt. And no spy-glass  had the power of The Great Spy-Glass.    After this fight, the youths spent a time having a care to their bodies  and wounds; and some were made separate from the others, and of these I  counted upon fifty; and whilst the others made to continue their march  towards the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, these were constrained by  one who was the Leader, to return to the Pyramid. And in a little, I saw  that they came towards us, wearily and with many a halt, as that they  suffered great wounds and harm of the fight.    But those others (maybe two hundred and fifty Youths) went onwards into  the Night Land; and though we sorrowed at this thing; yet was there come  a huge pride into our hearts that those raw ones, who yesterday were but  children, had so held themselves in the battle, and done a great deed  that day. And I wot that whilst their mothers wept, easeless, their  fathers' hearts swelled within them, and held somewhat of their Pain  away from them for a time.    And all this while, those wounded Youths came slowly, and rested, and  came on again, the better helping the worse; and a great excitement"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10671"],[0,"The Botanic Garden.

Many males, one female. The petals of this  beautiful and fragrant shrub, as well as of the Oenothera, tree primrose,  and others, continue expanded but a few hours, falling off about noon, or  soon after, in hot weather. The  most beautiful flowers of the Cactus  grandiflorus (see Cerea) are of equally short duration, but have their  existence in the night. And the flowers of the Hibiscus trionum are said  to continue but a single hour. The courtship between the males and females  in these flowers might be easily watched; the males are said to approach  and recede from the females alternately. The flowers of the Hibiscus  sinensis, mutable rose, live in the West Indies, their native climate,  but one day; but have this remarkable property, they are white at the  first expansion, then change to deep red, and become purple as they  decay.    The gum or resin of this fragrant vegetable is collected from extensive  underwoods of it in the East by a singular contrivance. Long leathern  thongs are tied to poles and cords, and drawn over the tops of these  shrubs about noon; which thus collect the dust of the anthers, which  adheres to the leather, and is occasionally scraped off.
