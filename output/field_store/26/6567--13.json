But it is a hard task  to vanquish Tharagavverug, for no sword can pierce his hide; his  back cannot be broken, and he can neither burn nor drown.  In one way  only can Tharagavverug die, and that is by starving.'    Then sorrow fell upon Leothric, but the magician spoke on:    'If a man drive Tharagavverug away from his food with a stick for  three days, he will starve on the third day at sunset.  And though he  is not vulnerable, yet in one spot he may take hurt, for his nose is  only of lead.  A sword would merely lay bare the uncleavable bronze  beneath, but if his nose be smitten constantly with a stick he will  always recoil from the pain, and thus may Tharagavverug, to left and  right, be driven away from his food.'    Then Leothric said: 'What is Tharagavverug's food?'    And the magician of Allathurion said: 'His food is men.'    But Leothric went straightway thence, and cut a great staff from a  hazel tree, and slept early that evening.  But the next morning,  awaking from troubled dreams, he arose before the dawn, and, taking  with him provisions for five days, set out through the forest  northwards towards the marshes.  For some hours he moved through the  gloom of the forest, and when he emerged from it the sun was above  the horizon shining on pools of water in the waste land.  Presently  he saw the claw-marks of Tharagavverug deep in the soil, and the  track of his tail between them like a furrow in a field.  Then  Leothric followed the tracks till he heard the bronze heart of  Tharagavverug before him, booming like a bell.    And Tharagavverug, it being the hour when he took the first meal of  the day, was moving towards a village with his heart tolling.  And  all the people of the village were come out to meet him, as it was  their wont to do; for they abode not the suspense of awaiting  Tharagavverug and of hearing him sniffing brazenly as he went from  door to door, pondering slowly in his metal mind what habitant he  should choose.  And none dared to flee, for in the days when the  villagers fled from Tharagavverug, he, having chosen his victim,  would track him tirelessly, like a doom.  Nothing availed them  against Tharagavverug.  Once they climbed the trees when he came, but  Tharagavverug went up to one, arching his back and leaning over  slightly, and rasped against the trunk until it fell.  And when  Leothric came near, Tharagavverug saw him out of one of his small  steel eyes and came towards him leisurely, and the echoes of his  heart swirled up through his open mouth.  And Leothric stepped  sideways from his onset, and came between him and the village and  smote him on the nose, and the blow of the stick made a dint in the  soft lead.  And Tharagavverug swung clumsily away, uttering one  fearful cry like the sound of a great church bell that had become  possessed of a soul that fluttered upward from the tombs at night--an  evil soul, giving the bell a voice.  Then he attacked Leothric,  snarling, and again Leothric leapt aside, and smote him on the nose  with his stick.  Tharagavverug uttered like a bell howling.  And  whenever the dragon-crocodile attacked him, or turned towards the  village, Leothric smote him again.    So all day long Leothric drove the monster with a stick, and he drove  him farther and farther from his prey, with his heart tolling  angrily and his voice crying out for pain.    Towards evening Tharagavverug ceased to snap at Leothric, but ran  before him to avoid the stick, for his nose was sore and shining;  and in the gloaming the villagers came out and danced to cymbal and  psaltery.  When Tharagavverug heard the cymbal and psaltery, hunger  and anger came upon him, and he felt as some lord might feel who was  held by force from the banquet in his own castle and heard the  creaking spit go round and round and the good meat crackling on it.  And all that night he attacked Leothric fiercely, and oft-times  nearly caught him in the darkness; for his gleaming eyes of steel  could see as well by night as by day.  And Leothric gave ground  slowly till the dawn, and when the light came they were near the  village again; yet not so near to it as they had been when they  encountered, for Leothric drove Tharagavverug farther in the day  than Tharagavverug had forced him back in the night.  Then Leothric  drove him again with his stick till the hour came when it was the  custom of the dragon-crocodile to find his man.  One third of his man  he would eat at the time he found him, and the rest at noon and  evening.  But when the hour came for finding his man a great  fierceness came on Tharagavverug, and he grabbed rapidly at  Leothric, but could not seize him, and for a long while neither of  them would retire.  But at last the pain of the stick on his leaden  nose overcame the hunger of the dragon-crocodile, and he turned from  it howling.  From that moment Tharagavverug weakened.  All that day  Leothric drove him with his stick, and at night both held their  ground; and when the dawn of the third day was come the heart of  Tharagavverug beat slower and fainter.  It was as though a tired man  was ringing a bell.  Once Tharagavverug nearly seized a frog, but  Leothric snatched it away just in time.  Towards noon the  dragon-crocodile lay still for a long while, and Leothric stood near  him and leaned on his trusty stick.  He was very tired and sleepless,  but had more leisure now for eating his provisions.  With  Tharagavverug the end was coming fast, and in the afternoon his  breath came hoarsely, rasping in his throat.  It was as the sound of  many huntsmen blowing blasts on horns, and towards evening his breath  came faster but fainter, like the sound of a hunt going furious to  the distance and dying away, and he made desperate rushes towards  the village; but Leothric still leapt about him, battering his  leaden nose.  Scarce audible now at all was the sound of his heart:  it was like a church bell tolling beyond hills for the death of some  one unknown and far away.  Then the sun set and flamed in the village  windows, and a chill went over the world, and in some small garden a  woman sang; and Tharagavverug lifted up his head and starved, and  his life went from his invulnerable body, and Leothric lay down  beside him and slept.  And later in the starlight the villagers came  out and carried Leothric, sleeping, to the village, all praising him  in whispers as they went.  They laid him down upon a couch in a  house, and danced outside in silence, without psaltery or cymbal.  And the next day, rejoicing, to Allathurion they hauled the  dragon-crocodile.  And Leothric went with them, holding his battered  staff; and a tall, broad man, who was smith of Allathurion, made a  great furnace, and melted Tharagavverug away till only Sacnoth was  left, gleaming among the ashes.  Then he took one of the small eyes  that had been chiselled out, and filed an edge on Sacnoth, and  gradually the steel eye wore away facet by facet, but ere it was  quite gone it had sharpened redoubtably Sacnoth.  But the other eye  they set in the butt of the hilt, and it gleamed there bluely.    And that night Leothric arose in the dark and took the sword, and  went westwards to find Gaznak; and he went through the dark forest  till the dawn, and all the morning and till the afternoon.  But in  the afternoon he came into the open and saw in the midst of The  Land Where No Man Goeth the fortress of Gaznak, mountainous before  him, little more than a mile away.    And Leothric saw that the land was marsh and desolate.  And the  fortress went up all white out of it, with many buttresses, and was  broad below but narrowed higher up, and was full of gleaming  windows with the light upon them.  And near the top of it a few white  clouds were floating, but above them some of its pinnacles  reappeared.  Then Leothric advanced into the marshes, and the eye of  Tharagavverug looked out warily from the hilt of Sacnoth; for  Tharagavverug had known the marshes well, and the sword nudged  Leothric to the right or pulled him to the left away from the  dangerous places, and so brought him safely to the fortress walls.    And in the wall stood doors like precipices of steel, all studded  with boulders of iron, and above every window were terrible  gargoyles of stone; and the name of the fortress shone on the wall,  writ large in letters of brass: 'The Fortress Unvanquishable, Save  For Sacnoth.'    Then Leothric drew and revealed Sacnoth, and all the gargoyles  grinned, and the grin went flickering from face to face right up  into the cloud-abiding gables.    And when Sacnoth was revealed and all the gargoyles grinned, it was  like the moonlight emerging from a cloud to look for the first time  upon a field of blood, and passing swiftly over the wet faces of the  slain that lie together in the horrible night.  Then Leothric  advanced towards a door, and it was mightier than the marble quarry,  Sacremona, from which of old men cut enormous slabs to build the  Abbey of the Holy Tears.  Day after day they wrenched out the very  ribs of the hill until the Abbey was builded, and it was more  beautiful than anything in stone.  Then the priests blessed  Sacremona, and it had rest, and no more stone was ever taken from it  to build the houses of men.  And the hill stood looking southwards  lonely in the sunlight, defaced by that mighty scar.  So vast was  the door of steel.  And the name of the door was The Porte Resonant,  the Way of Egress for War.    Then Leothric smote upon the Porte Resonant with Sacnoth, and the  echo of Sacnoth went ringing through the halls, and all the dragons  in the fortress barked.

In 532 he withdrew from the world into a cave at the    foot of a mountain bathed by the river Duero, near where now stands    the town of Soria. There he lived about thirty-six years, or until    568, when he died and was buried by his faithful disciple St.    Prudentius, later bishop of Tarazona, who had been a companion of    the hermit during the last seven years of his life. His cave is    still an object of pilgrimage, and a church has been built on the    spot to the memory of the saint.

A mediaeval-looking town of 7296 inhabitants    situated on a bleak plateau on the right bank of the Duero. It is    the capital of a province of the same name. The old town of Numantia    (captured by the Romans under P. Cornelius Scipio AEmilianus, 133    B.C.) lay about three miles to the north of the present site of    Soria.]      [Footnote 3: Alamos. The choice of a grove of poplars as setting to    the enchanted fount is peculiarly appropriate, as this tree belongs    to the large list of those believed to have magical properties. In    the south of Europe the poplar seems to have held sometimes the    mythological place reserved in the north for the birch, and the    people of Andalusia believe that the poplar is the most ancient of    trees. (See de Gubernatis, Za _Mythologie des plantes_, Paris,    Reinwald, 1882, p. 285.) In classical superstition the black poplar    was consecrated to the goddess Proserpine, and the white poplar to    Hercules. \"The White Poplar was also dedicated to Time, because its    leaves were constantly in motion, and, being dark on one side and    light on the other, they were emblematic of night and day.... There    is a tradition that the Cross of Christ was made of the wood of the    White Poplar, and throughout Christendom there is a belief that the    tree trembles and shivers mystically in sympathy with the ancestral    tree which became accursed.... Mrs. Hemans, in her 'Wood Walk,' thus    alludes to one of these old traditions:        FATHER.--Hast thou heard, my boy,        The peasant's legend of that quivering tree?        CHILD.--No, father; doth he say the fairies dance        Amidst its branches?        FATHER.--Oh! a cause more deep,        More solemn far, the rustic doth assign        To the strange restlessness of those wan leaves.        The Cross he deems--the blessed Cross, whereon        The meek Redeemer bow'd His head to death--        Was formed of Aspen wood; and since that hour        Through all its race the pale tree hath sent down        A thrilling consciousness, a secret awe        Making them tremulous, when not a breeze        Disturbs the airy Thistle-down, or shakes        The light lines from the shining gossamer.\"      Richard Folkard, _Plant Lore_, London, 1892, p. 503.]    Las cuencas del Moncayo[1] repitieron de eco en eco el bramido de las  trompas, el latir de la jauria desencadenada y las voces de los pajes  resonaron con nueva furia, y el confuso tropel de hombres, caballos y  perros se dirigio al punto que Inigo, el montero mayor de los  marqueses de Almenar,[2] senalara,[3] como el mas a proposito para  cortarle el paso a la res.      [Footnote 1: El Moncayo. See p. 8, note 1.]      [Footnote 2: Marqueses de Almenar. A title taken doubtless from the    little town of Almenar (650 inhabitants) situated in the province of    Soria near the right bank of the Rituerto river, southwest of the    Moncayo, and not far from that mountain.]      [Footnote 3: senalara. A relic of the Latin pluperfect (in _-aram_,    _-eram_), popularly confounded with the imperfect subjunctive. Its    use is now somewhat archaic, and is restricted to relative clauses.

Cuando el mas agil de los lebreles llego a las  carrascas jadeante y cubiertas las fauces de espuma, ya el ciervo,  rapido como una saeta, las habia salvado de un solo brinco,  perdiendose entre los matorrales de una trocha, que conducia a la  fuente.    --iAlto!... iAlto todo el mundo! grito Inigo entonces; estaba de Dios  que habia de marcharse.    Y la cabalgata se detuvo, y enmudecieron las trompas, y los lebreles  dejaron refunfunando la pista a la voz de los cazadores.    En aquel momento se reunia a la comitiva el heroe de la fiesta,  Fernando de Argensola,[1] el primogenito de Almenar.      [Footnote 1: Argensola. A name familiar to students of Spanish    literature from the writings of the illustrious brothers Bartolome    and Lupercio Leonardo de Argensola (sixteenth century). It is also    the name of a small town of some 560 inhabitants in the province of    Barcelona.]    --?Que haces? exclamo dirigiendose a su montero, y en tanto, ya se  pintaba el asombro en sus facciones, ya ardia la colera en sus ojos.  ?Que haces, imbecil? iVes que la pieza esta herida, que es la primera  que cae por mi mano, y abandonas el rastro y la dejas perder para que  vaya a morir en el fondo del bosque! ?Crees acaso que he venido a  matar ciervos para festines de lobos?    --Senor, murmuro, Inigo entre dientes, es imposible pasar de este  punto.    --iImposible! ?y por que?    --Porque esa trocha, prosiguio el montero, conduce a la fuente de los  Alamos; la fuente de los Alamos, en cuyas aguas habita un espiritu del  mal. El que osa enturbiar su corriente, paga caro su atrevimiento. Ya  la res habra salvado sus margenes; ?como la salvareis vos sin atraer  sobre vuestra cabeza alguna calamidad horrible? Los cazadores somos  reyes del Moncayo, pero reyes que pagan un tributo. Pieza que se  refugia en esa fuente misteriosa, pieza perdida.    --iPieza perdida!

Aun se  distingue a intervalos desde aqui ... las piernas le faltan, su  carrera se acorta; dejame... dejame... suelta esa brida, o te revuelco  en el polvo.... ?Quien sabe si no le dare lugar para que llegue a la  fuente? y si llegase, al diablo ella, su limpidez y sus habitadores.  iSus! i_Relampago_! sus, caballo mio! si lo alcanzas, mando engarzar  los diamantes de mi joyel en tu serreta de oro.    Caballo y jinete partieron como un huracan.    Inigo los siguio con la vista hasta que se perdieron en la maleza;  despues volvio los ojos en derredor suyo; todos, como el, permanecian  inmoviles y consternados.    El montero exclamo al fin:    --Senores, vosotros lo habeis visto; me he expuesto a morir entre los  pies de su caballo por detenerle. Yo he cumplido con mi deber. Con el  diablo no sirven valentias.

A brash or metallic instrument    for the sprinkling of holy water. As to the efficacy of holy water    against evil spirits St. Teresa of Avila (1515-1582) speaks as    follows:      I have learned from frequent experience that there is nothing better    (than holy water) to drive them away and to prevent them from    returning: they flee at the sight of the Cross, but return. The    virtue of holy water must be great indeed.      See _Escritos de Santa Teresa_, \"Libro de su vida,\" capitulo 31, in    the _Biblioteca de Autores Espanoles_, Madrid, Rivadeneyra, 1861, p.    94.      L'Abbe Jean Joseph Gaume has written a work, entitled _l'Eau lenite    au XIXe siecle_ (Paris, 1866), in which he also advocates the use of    holy water to-day for similar purposes.]      II    --Teneis la color quebrada; andais mustio, y sombrio; ?que os sucede?

Solo con esas cavilaciones que  os persiguen, todas las mananas tomais la ballesta para enderezaros a  la espesura y permanecer en ella hasta que el sol se esconde. Y cuando  la noche obscurece y voiveis palido y fatigado al castillo, en balde  busco en la bandolera los despojos de la caza. ?Que os ocupa tan  largas horas lejos de los que mas os quieren?    Mientras Inigo hablaba, Fernando, absorto en sus ideas, sacaba  maquinalmente astillas de su escano de ebano con el cuchillo de monte.    Despues de un largo silencio, que solo interrumpia el chirrido de la  hoja al resbalarse sobre la pulimentada madera, el joven exclamo  dirigiendose a su servidor, como si no hubiera escuchado una sola de  sus palabras:    --Inigo, tu que eres viejo, tu que conoces todas las guaridas del  Moncayo, que has vivido en sus faldas persiguiendo a las fieras, y en  tus errantes excursiones de cazador subiste mas de una vez a su  cumbre, dime, ?has encontrado por acaso una mujer que vive entre sus  rocas?    --iUna mujer! exclamo el montero con asombro y mirandole de hito en  hito.    --Si, dijo el joven; es una cosa extrana lo que me sucede, muy  extrana....

Tu me ayudaras a desvanecer el misterio que envuelve a  esa criatura, que al parecer solo para mi existe, pues nadie la  conoce, ni la ha visto, ni puede darme razon de ella.    El montero, sin despegar los labios, arrastro su banquillo hasta  colocarlo junto al escano de su senor, del que no apartaba un punto  los espantados ojos.
