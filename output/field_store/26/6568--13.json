Sturt writes that had there been  the slightest encouragement afforded by any change in the country, he  would even then have pushed forward, \"but we had left all traces of the  natives behind us, and this seemed a desert they never entered -- that  not even a bird inhabited.\"    Back to Mount Harris once more, where they arrived on the 7th of April,  1829. On their way they had stopped to follow a depression first noticed  by Hume, and decided that it was the channel of the overflow of the  Macquarie Marshes.    6.3. THE PASSAGE OF THE MURRAY.    The mystery of the Macquarie was now, to a certain extent, cleared away,  but the course and final outlet of the Darling now presented another  riddle, which Sturt too was destined to solve.    The discovery of such a large river as the Darling, augmented by the  Macquarie and Castlereagh, and (so people then thought) in all  probability the Lachlan, naturally inflamed public curiosity as to the  position of the outlet on the Australian coast. All the rivers that had  been tried as guides to the hidden interior having failed to answer the  purpose, the Murrumbidgee -- the beautiful river of the aboriginals --  was selected as the scene of the next attempt. There were good reasons  for the choice: it derived its volume from the highest known mountains,  snow-capped peaks in fact, that reminded the spectator of far northern  latitudes, and thus it was to a great extent independent of the variable  local rainfall.    Captain Sturt was naturally selected to be the leader of the Murrumbidgee  expedition, and with him as second went George MacLeay, the son of the  then Colonial Secretary. Harris, who had been Sturt's soldier-servant for  nearly eighteen years, and two other men of the 39th, who had been with  their Captain on the Macquarie expedition, also accompanied him, with a  very complete and well-furnished party, including the usual boat rigged  up on a carriage. This time, however, unlike the craft that had  accompanied previous exploring parties, the whaleboat was destined to be  immortalised in Australian history.    Settlement had by this time extended well up to and down the banks of the  Murrumbidgee, and Sturt took his departure from the borders of  civilisation about where the town of Gundagai now stands, almost at the  junction of the Tumut River, at Whaby's station. The course for some time  lay along the rich river-flats of the Murrumbidgee. The blacks, who of  course from their position were familiar with the presence of white men,  maintained a friendly demeanour. One slight excursion to the north was  made to connect with Oxley's furthest south, made when on his Lachlan  expedition; but though they did not actually verify the spot, Sturt  reckoned that he went within twenty miles of it, showing how narrowly  that explorer had missed the discovery of the Murrumbidgee.    As they got lower down the river they found themselves travelling through  the flat desolate country that reminded them only too forcibly of late  experiences on the Macquarie. Owing to some information gleaned from the  natives, Sturt and MacLeay rode north to try and again come upon the  Lachlan. They struck a dry channel, which Sturt believed was the drainage  from the Lachlan into the Murrumbidgee. This proved to be correct, as  natives afterwards testified that they had seen the two white men  actually on the Lachlan.    On the 25th, which was an intensely hot day, MacLeay, who was on ahead,  found himself suddenly confronted with a boundless sea of reeds, and the  river itself had suddenly vanished. He sent a mounted messenger back to  Sturt with these disastrous tidings. Sturt thereupon turned the drays,  which were already in difficulties in the loose soil, sharp round to the  right, and finally came to the river again, where they camped to discuss  the untoward circumstance.    At daylight the next morning, Sturt and MacLeay rode along its bank,  whilst Clayton, the carpenter, was set to work felling a tree and digging  a sawpit. Progress along the bank with the whole party was evidently  impossible. Sturt, however, had faith in the continuity of the river, and  announced to MacLeay his intention to send back most of the expedition,  and with a picked crew to embark in the whaleboat, committing their  desperate fortunes to the stream, and trusting to make the coast  somewhere, and leaving their return in the hands of Providence.    The more one regards this heroic venture, the more sublime does it  appear. The whole of the interior was then a sealed book, and the river,  for aught Sturt knew, might flow throughout the length of the continent.  But the voyage was commenced with cool and calm confidence.    In a week the whaleboat was put together, and a small skiff also built.  Six hands were selected for the crew, and the remainder, after waiting  one week in case of accident, were to return to Goulburn Plains and there  await events. It would be as well to embody here the names of this band.  John Harris, Hopkinson, and Fraser were the soldiers chosen, and Clayton,  Mulholland, and Macmanee the prisoners. The start was made at seven on  the morning of January 7th, the whale-boat towing the small skiff. Within  about fifteen miles of the point of embarkation they passed the junction  of the Lachlan, and that night camped amongst a thicket of reeds. The  next day the skiff fouled a log and sank, and though it was raised to the  surface and most of the contents recovered, the bulk of them was much  damaged. Fallen and sunken logs greatly endangered their progress, but on  the 14th they \"were hurried into a broad and noble river.\" Such was the  force with which they were shot out of the Murrumbidgee that they were  carried nearly to the opposite bank of the new and ample stream. Sturt's  feelings at that moment were to be envied, and for once in a life  chequered with much disappointment he must have felt that a great reward  was granted to him in this crowning discovery. He named the new river the  Murray, after Sir George Murray, the head of the Colonial Department. As  some controversy has of late arisen as to the question of Sturt's right  to confer the name, we here quote his own words, written after surveying  the Hume in 1838.    \"When I named the Murray I was in a great measure ignorant of the other  rivers with which it is connected...I want not to usurp an inch of ground  or of water over which I have not passed.\"    On the bosom of the Murray they could now make use of their sail, which  the contracted space in the bed of the Murrumbidgee had before prevented  them from doing. The aborigines were seen nearly every day, and once when  the voyagers had to negotiate a very ticklish rapid, some of them  approached quite close, and seemed to take great interest in the  proceedings.    Sturt's thoughts now turned towards the junction of the Darling, and at  last he sighted a deserted camp on which the huts resembled those he had  seen on that river. On the 23rd of January they came upon the junction at  a very critical moment. A line of magnificently-foliaged trees came into  view, among which was perceived a large gathering of blacks, who  apparently were inclined to be hostile. Sturt, who was at the helm, was  steering straight for them and made the customary signs of peace. Just  before it was too late to avoid a collision, Sturt marked hostility in  their quivering limbs and battle-lusting eyes. He instantly put the helm  a-starboard, and the boat sheered down the reach, the baffled natives  running and yelling defiantly along the bank. The river, however, was  shoaling rapidly, and from the opposite side there projected a sand-spit;  on each side of this narrow passage infuriated blacks had gathered, and  there was no mistaking their intentions. Sturt gave orders to his men as  to their behaviour, and held himself ready to give the battle-signal by  shooting the most active and forward of their adversaries.    Mention has been made of a small party of blacks who had been interested  in the shooting of a rapid by the boat's crew. Four of these savages had  camped with the explorers the preceding night, leaving at daylight in the  morning. Sturt imagined that they had gone ahead as peace delegates, and  he was thus most anxious to avoid a fight. But the life of the whole  party depended on prompt action being taken, and Sturt's eye was on the  leader and his finger on the trigger when \"my purpose,\" he says \"was  checked by MacLeay, who called to me that another party of blacks had  made their appearance on the left bank of the river. Turning round, I  observed four men at the top of their speed.\" These were the dusky  delegates, and the description given by Sturt of the conduct of the man  who saved the situation is very graphic:--    [Illustration. Junction of the Darling and Murray Rivers.]    \"The foremost of them, as soon as he got ahead of the boat, threw himself  from a considerable height into the water. He struggled across the  channel to the sand-bank, and in an incredibly short space of time stood  in front of the savage against whom my aim had been directed. Seizing him  by the throat, he pushed him backwards, and forcing all who were in the  water on the bank, he trod its margin with a vehemence and an agitation  that was exceedingly striking. At one moment pointing to the boat, at  another shaking his clenched hand in the faces of the most forward, and  stamping with passion on the sand, his voice, that was at first distinct,  was lost in hoarse murmurs.\"    This episode, unequalled in the traditions of the Australian aborigines,  removed the imminent danger; and Sturt's tact, in a few moments changed  the hundreds of demented demons into a pack of laughing, curious  children, an easy and common transition with the savage nature. But for  the intervention of this noble chief, Sturt and his followers, penned  within the boat"]]]
