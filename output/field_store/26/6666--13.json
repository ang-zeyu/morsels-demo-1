BLIND HARRY or HENRY THE MINSTREL (_fl._ 1470-1492).--Is spoken of by  John Major in his _History of Scotland_ as a wandering minstrel, skilled  in the composition of rhymes in the Scottish tongue, who \"fabricated\" a  book about William Wallace, and gained his living by reciting it to his  own accompaniment on the harp at the houses of the nobles. Harry claims  that it was founded on a Latin _Life of Wallace_ written by Wallace's  chaplain, John Blair, but the chief sources seem to have been  traditionary. Harry is often considered inferior to Barbour as a poet,  and has little of his moral elevation, but he surpasses him in graphic  power, vividness of description, and variety of incident. He occasionally  shows the influence of Chaucer, and is said to have known Latin and  French.      BLIND, MATHILDE (1841-1896).--Poetess, _b._ at Mannheim, but settled in  London about 1849, and _pub._ several books of poetry, _The Prophecy of  St. Oran_ (1881), _The Heather on Fire_ (1886), _Songs and Sonnets_  (1893), _Birds of Passage_ (1895), etc. She also translated Strauss's  _Old Faith and New_, and other works, and wrote Lives of George Eliot and  Madame Roland. Her own name was Cohen, but she adopted that of her  stepfather, Karl Blind.      BLOOMFIELD, ROBERT (1766-1823).--Poet, _b._ at Honington in Suffolk, lost  his _f._ when he was a year old, and received the rudiments of education  from his mother, who kept the village school. While still a boy he went  to London, and worked as a shoemaker under an elder brother, enduring  extreme poverty. His first and chief poem, _The Farmer's Boy_, was  composed in a room where half a dozen other men were at work, and the  finished lines he carried in his head until there was time to write them  down. The manuscript, after passing through various hands, fell into  those of Capel Lofft, a Suffolk squire of literary tastes, by whose  exertions it was _pub._ with illustrations by Bewick in 1800. It had a  signal success, 26,000 copies having been sold in three years. The Duke  of Grafton obtained for him an appointment in the Seal Office, and when,  through ill-health, he was obliged to resign this, allowed him a pension  of 1s. a day. Other works were _Rural Tales_ (1804), _Wild Flowers_  (1806), _The Banks of the Wye_ (1811), and _May Day with the Muses_  (1817). An attempt to carry on business as a bookseller failed, his  health gave way, his reason was threatened, and he _d._ in great poverty  at Shefford in 1823. B.'s poetry is smooth, correct, and characterised by  taste and good feeling, but lacks fire and energy. Of amiable and simple  character, he was lacking in self-reliance.      BODENHAM, JOHN (_fl._ 1600).--Anthologist, is stated to have been the ed.  of some of the Elizabethan anthologies, viz., _Politeuphuia_ (_Wits'  Commonwealth_) (1597), _Wits' Theater_ (1598), _Belvidere, or the Garden  of the Muses_ (1600), and _England's Helicon_ (1600). Mr. Bullen says  that B. did not himself ed. any of the Elizabethan miscellanies  attributed to him by bibliographers: but that he projected their  publication, and he befriended the editors.      BOECE, or BOETHIUS, HECTOR (1465?-1536).--Historian, probably _b._ at  Dundee, and _ed._ there and at Paris, where he was a regent or professor,  1492 to 1498. While there he made the acquaintance of Erasmus. Returning  to Scotland he co-operated with Elphinstone, Bishop of Aberdeen, in  founding the univ. there of which he was the first Principal. His  literary fame rests on two works, his _Lives of the Bishops of Mortlach  and Aberdeen_, in which his friend Elphinstone figures prominently, and  his _History of Scotland_ to the accession of James III. These works  were, of course, composed in Latin, but the _History_ was translated into  Scottish prose by John Bellenden, 1530 to 1533, and into English for  Hollinshed's _Chronicle_. The only predecessor of the work was the  compendium of Major, and as it was written in a flowing and pleasing  style it became very popular, and led to ecclesiastical preferment and  Royal favour. B. shared in the credulity of his age, but the charge of  inventing his authorities formerly brought against him has been shown to  be, to some extent at any rate, unfounded.      BOKER, GEORGE HENRY (1823-90).--Poet, was in the American Diplomatic  Service. Among his dramas, generally tragedies, are _Anne Boleyn_, _The  Betrothed_, and _Francesca da Rimini_, and among his books of poetry,  _Street Lyrics_, _Koenigsmark_, and _The Book of the Dead_. His dramas  combine poetic merit with adaptability for acting.      BOLINGBROKE, HENRY ST. JOHN, 1ST VISCOUNT (1678-1751).--Statesman and  philosopher, _s._ of Sir Henry St. J., _b._ at Battersea, and _ed._ at  Eton and perhaps Oxf., was during his youth noted chiefly for  dissipation, but entering Parliament in 1701 as a supporter of Harley,  soon made himself a name by his eloquence and talent. He held office as  War and Foreign Sec. successively, became a peer in 1712, intrigued  successfully against Harley, and formed an administration during the last  days of Queen Anne, with the intention of bringing back the Stuarts,  which was frustrated by the Queen's death. On the arrival of George I.  and the accession to power of the Whigs, B. was impeached, and his name  erased from the Roll of Peers. He went to France, and became Sec. of  State to the Pretender James, who, however, dismissed him in 1716, after  which he devoted himself to philosophy and literature. In 1723 he was  pardoned and returned to England, and an act was passed in 1725 restoring  his forfeited estates, but still excluding him from the House of Lords.  He thereupon retired to his house, Dawley, near Uxbridge, where he  enjoyed the society of Swift and Pope, on the latter of whom he exerted a  strong influence. After some ineffectual efforts to regain a position in  political life, he returned to France in 1735, where he remained for 7  years, and wrote most of his chief works.    B. was a man of brilliant and versatile talents, but selfish, insincere,  and intriguing, defects of character which led to his political ruin. His  writings, once so much admired, reflect his character in their glittering  artificiality, and his pretensions to the reputation of a philosopher  have long been exploded; the chief of them are _Reflections upon Exile_,  _Letters on the Study of History_ (in which he attacked Christianity),  _Letters on the Spirit of Patriotism_, and _Idea of a Patriot King_. He  left his MSS. to David Mallet (_q.v._), who _pub._ a complete ed. of his  works in 5 vols. (1753-54).      BONAR, HORATIUS (1808-1889).--Divine and poet, _s._ of James B.,  Solicitor of Exise for Scotland, _b._ and _ed._ in Edin., entered the  Ministry of the Church of Scotland, and was settled at Kelso. He joined  the Free Church at the Disruption in 1843, and in 1867 was translated to  Edin. In 1853 he was made D.D. of Aberdeen. He was a voluminous and  highly popular author, and in addition to many books and tracts wrote a  number of hymns, many of which, _e.g._, \"I heard the voice of Jesus say,\"  are known all over the English-speaking world. A selection of these was  _pub._ as _Hymns of Faith and Hope_ (3 series). His last vol. of poetry  was _My Old Letters_.      BOORDE, or BORDE, ANDREW (1490?-1549).--Traveller, _b._ near Cuckfield,  Sussex, was brought up as a Carthusian, and held ecclesiastical  appointments, then practised medicine at various places, including  Glasgow, and was employed in various capacities by T. Cromwell. He  travelled widely, going as far as Jerusalem, and wrote descriptions of  the countries he had visited. His _Dyetary_ is the first English book of  domestic medicine. The _Boke of the Introduction of Knowledge_ describes  his journeys on the Continent. Other works are _The Boke of Berdes_  (Beards), _Handbook of Europe_, and _Itinerary of England_.      BORROW, GEORGE (1803-1881).--Philologist and miscellaneous author, and  traveller, _b._ at East Dereham, Norfolk, _s._ of a recruiting officer,  had a somewhat wandering childhood. He received most of his education in  Edin., and showed a peculiar talent for acquiring languages. After being  for a short time in the office of a solicitor in Norwich, he travelled  widely on the Continent and in the East, acquainting himself with the  people and languages of the various countries he visited. He specially  attached himself to the Gipsies, with whose language he became so  familiar as to _pub._ a dictionary of it. His learning was shown by his  publishing at St. Petersburg _Targum_, a work containing translations  from 30 languages. B. became a travelling agent of the Bible Society, and  his book, _The Bible in Spain_ (1843), giving an account of his  remarkable adventures in that country, made his literary reputation. It  was followed by _Lavengro_ (1851), and its sequel, _Romany Rye_ (1857),  and _Wild Wales_ (1862), which, though works of originality and extreme  interest, and now perhaps his most popular books, were received with less  public favour. The two first give a highly coloured picture of his own  story. He translated the New Testament into Manchu. In his latter years  he settled at Oulton Broad, Norfolk, where he _d._ B. was a man of  striking appearance and great vigour and originality of character and  mind. His writings hold a unique place in English literature.      BOSTON, THOMAS (1677-1732).--Scottish divine, was successively  schoolmaster at Glencairn, and minister of Simprin in Berwickshire, and  Ettrick in Selkirkshire. In addition to his best-known work, _The  Fourfold State_, one of the religious classics of Scotland, he wrote an  original little book, _The Crook in the Lot_, and a learned treatise on  the Hebrew points. He also took a leading part in the Courts of the  Church in what was known as the \"Marrow Controversy,\" regarding the  merits of an English work, _The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13241"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#14)"],[1,"Selby Sly, see  Kitty decently sodded. Your mother, Constance, and myself will rumble  after you to town by easy stages. I wonder how aunt Catherine will  cut up. If she has left as much cash behind as she has lavished good  advice in her parting epistle, by--\" and my father did ejaculate  a regular rasper--\"I'll re-purchase the harriers, as I have got  a whisper that poor Dick was cleaned out the last meeting at the  Curragh, and the pack is in the market.\"             *       *       *       *       *    CHAPTER III.      \"I have _tremor cordis_ on me.\"--_Winter's Tale_.    It is a queer world after all; manifold are its ups and downs,  and life is but a medley of fair promise, excited hope, and bitter  disappointment.    Never did a family party start for the metropolis with gayer hearts,  or on a more agreeable mission. Our honored relative (_authoritate_  the Methodist Magazine) had \"shuffled off\" in the best marching order  imaginable. Before the rout had arrived, her house had been perfectly  arranged, but her will, \"wo [**Unreadable] day,\" was afterward found  to be too informal. It was hinted that the mission to Timbuctoo,  although not legally binding on the next of kin, should be considered  a sacred injunction and first lien on the estates. In a religious  light, according to the Reverend Mr. Sharpington, formalities were  unnecessary; but my father observed, _sotto voce_, in reply, and in  the plain vernacular of the day, what in modern times would have been  more figuratively expressed, namely, \"Did not the gospel-trumpeters  wish they might get it!\" The kennel, whose door for two years had not  been opened, was again unlocked; whitewashing and reparations were  extensively ordered; a prudent envoy was dispatched to re-purchase the  pack, which, _rebut egenis_, had been laid down, and the colonel, in  his \"mind's eye,\" and oblivious of cloth shoes, once more was up to  his knees in leather,[2] and taking everything in the shape of fence  and brook, just as the Lord pleased to dispose them.    A cellar census was next decided on, and by a stout exertion, and at  the same time with a heavy heart, my father hobbled down the stone  steps and entered an underground repertorium, which once he took  much pride in visiting. Alas! its glory had departed; the empty bins  were richly fringed with cobwebbed tapestries, and silently admitted  a non-occupancy by bottles for past years. The colonel sighed. He  remembered his grandfather's parting benediction. Almost in infancy,  malignant fever within one brief week had deprived him of both  parents, and a chasm in direct succession was thus created. A summons  from school was unexpectedly received, and although the young heir and  the courier borrowed liberally from the night, it was past cock-crow  when they reached their destination.    The old gentleman was \"in articulo,\" or as sailors would say, he was  already \"hove short,\" and ready to trip his anchor.    \"Up stairs, master Frank,\" exclaimed the old butler to my father, \"the  general will be in heaven in half an hour, glory to the Virgin!\"    I shall never forget my fathers description of the parting scene.  Propped by half a dozen pillows, the old man gasped hard for breath,  but the appearance of his grandson appeared to rouse the dormant  functions of both mind and body; and although there were considerable  breaks between each sentence, he thus delivered his valedictory  advice. Often has the departure of Commodore Trunnion been recalled to  memory by the demise of my honored relative.    \"Frank,\" said the old fox-hunter to my father, \"the summons is come,  as we used to say when I was a dragoon, to 'boot and saddle.' I told  the doctor a month ago that my wind was touched, but he would have it  that I was only a whistler.\"    He paused for breath.    \"The best horse that ever bore pig-skin on his back, won't stand too  many calls--ugh! ugh! ugh!\"    Another pause.    \"I bless God that my conscience is tolerably clean. Widow or orphan I  never wronged intentionally, and the heaviest item booked against me  overhead is Dick Sommer's death. Well, he threw a decanter, as was  proved upon the trial to the satisfaction of judge and jury; and you  know, after that, nothing but the daisy[3] would do. I leave you four  honest weight carriers, and as sweet a pack as ever ran into a red  rascal without a check. Don't be extravagant in my wake.\"    Another interruption in the parting address.    \"A fat heifer, half a dozen sheep, and the puncheon of Rasserea that's  in the cellar untouched, should do the thing genteelly. It's only  a couple of nights you know, as you'll sod me the third morning.  Considering that I stood two contests for the county, an action for  false imprisonment by a gauger, never had a lock on the hall door,  kept ten horses at rack and manger, and lived like a gentleman. To the  L5,000 for which my poor father dipped the estate I have only after  all added L10,000 more, which, as Attorney Rowland said, showed that I  was a capital manager. Well, you can pay both off easily.\"    Another fit of coughing distressed my grandfather sorely.    \"Go to the waters--any place in England will answer. If you will stand  tallow or tobacco, you can in a month or two wipe old scores off the  slate. Sir Roderick O'Boyl, when he was so hard pushed as to be driven  over the bridge of Athlone in a coffin to avoid the coroner,[4] didn't  he, and in less than a twelvemonth too, bring over a sugar-baker's  daughter, pay off encumbrances, and live and die like a gentleman as  he was every inch? I have not much to leave you but some advice, Frank  dear, and after I slip my girths remember what I say. When you're  likely to get into trouble, always take the bull by the horns, and  when you're in for a stoup, never mix liquors or sit with your back  to the fire. If you're obliged to go out, be sure to fight across the  ridges, and if you can manage it, with the sun at your back. Ugh! ugh!  ugh!\"    \"In crossing a country, choose the--\"    Another coughing fit, and a long hiatus in valedictory instructions  succeeded, but the old man, as they say in hunting, got second wind,  and thus proceeded--    \"Never fence a ditch when a gate is open--avoid late hours and  attorneys--and the less you have to say to doctors, all the  better--ugh! ugh! ugh! When it's your misfortune to be in company  with an old maid--I mean a reputed one--ugh! ugh! always be on the  muzzle--for in her next issue of scandal she'll be sure to quote  you as her authority. If a saint comes in your way, button your  breeches-pocket, and look now and then at your watch-chain. I'm  brought nearly to a fix, for bad bellows won't stand long speeches.\"    Here the ripple in his speech, which disturbed Commodore Trunnion so  much, sorely afflicted my worthy grandfather. He muttered something  that a snaffle was the safest bit a sinner could place faith  in--assumed the mantle of prophecy--foretold, as it would appear,  troublous times to be in rapid advent--and inculcated that faith  should be placed in heaven, and powder kept very dry.    He strove to rally and reiterate his counsels for my father's  guidance, but strength was wanting. The story of a life was told--he  swayed on one side from the supporting pillows--and in a minute more  the struggle was over. Well, peace to his ashes! We'll leave him in  the family vault, and start with a party for the metropolis, who, in  the demise of our honored kinswoman, had sustained a heavy loss, but  notwithstanding, endured the visitation with Christian fortitude and  marvelous resignation.    _Place au dames_. My lady-mother had been a beauty in her day, and  for a dozen years after her marriage, had seen her name proudly and  periodically recorded by George Faukiner, in the thing he called  a journal, which, in size, paper, and typography, might emulate a  necrologic affair cried loudly through the streets of London, \"i' the  afternoon\" of a hanging Monday, containing much important information,  whether the defunct felon had made his last breakfast simply from tea  and toast, or whether Mr. Sheriff ---- had kindly added mutton-chops  to the _dejeuner_, while his amiable lady furnished new-laid eggs from  the family corn-chandler. But to return to my mother.    Ten years had passed, and her name had not been hallooed from groom  to groom on a birth-day night, while the pearl neck-lace, a bridal  present, and emeralds, an heir-loom from her mother, remained in  strict abeyance. Now and again their cases were unclosed, and a  sigh accompanied the inspection--for sad were their reminiscences.  _Olim_--her name was chronicled on Patrick's night, by every Castle  reporter. They made, it is to be lamented, as Irish reporters will  make, sad mistakes at times. The once poor injured lady had been  attired in canary-colored lute-string, and an ostrich plume remarkable  for its enormity while she, the libeled one, had been becomingly  arrayed in blue bombazine, and of any plumage imported from Araby the  blest, was altogether innocent.    A general family movement was decided on. My aunt's demise required,  my father's presence in the metropolis. My mother's wardrobe demanded  an extensive addition,--for, sooth to say, her costume had become, as  far as fashion went, rather antediluvian. Constance announced that a  back-tooth called for professional interference. May heaven forgive  her if she fibbed!--for a dental display of purer ivory never slily  solicited a lover's kiss, than what her joyous laugh exhibited. My  poor mother entered a protest against the \"_spes ultima gregis_,\"  meaning myself, being left at home in times so perilous, and when  all who could effect it were hurrying into garrisoned towns, and  abandoning, for crowded lodgings, homes whose superior comforts were  abated by their insecurity. The order for a general movement was  consequently issued, and on the 22d of June we commenced our "]]]
