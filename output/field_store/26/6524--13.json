When  those lime-stones have been in such a situation that they could form  perfect crystals they are called spars, some of which possess a double  refraction, as observed by Sir Isaac Newton. When these crystals are  jumbled together or mixed with some colouring impurities it is termed  marble, if its texture be equable and firm; if its texture be coarse and  porous yet hard, it is called lime-stone; if its texture be very loose  and porous it is termed chalk. In some rocks the shells remain almost  unchanged and only covered, or bedded with lime-stone, which seems to  have been dissolved and sunk down amongst them. In others the softer  shells and bones are dissolved, and only sharks teeth or harder echini  have preserved their form inveloped in the chalk or lime-stone; in some  marbles the solution has been compleat and no vestiges of shell appear,  as in the white kind called statuary by the workmen.

Many of the designs by Roubiliac in  Westminster Abbey are uncommonly poetical; the allegory of Time and Fame  contending for the trophy of General Wade, which is here alluded to, is  beautifully told; the wings of Fame are still expanded, and her hair  still floating in the air; which not only shews that she has that moment  arrived, but also that her force is not yet expended; at the same time,  that the old figure of Time with his disordered wings is rather leaning  backwards and yielding to her impulse, and must apparently in another  instant be driven from his attack upon the trophy.]    [_Foster's fine form_. l. 113.

[_Root-inwove morass_. l. 116. The great mass of matter which rests upon  the lime-stone strata of the earth, or upon the granite where the lime-  stone stratum has been removed by earthquakes or covered by lava, has  had its origin from the recrements of vegetables and of air-breathing  animals, as the lime-stone had its origin from sea animals. The whole  habitable world was originally covered with woods, till mankind formed  themselves into societies, and subdued them by fire and by steel. Hence  woods in uncultivated countries have grown and fallen through many ages,  whence morasses of immense extent; and from these as the more soluble  parts were washed away first, were produced sea-salt, nitre, iron, and  variety of acids, which combining with calcareous matter were productive  of many fossil bodies, as flint, sea-sand, selenite, with the precious  stones, and perhaps the diamond.

[_Hence with diffusive salt_. l. 119. Salts of various kinds are  produced from the recrements of animal and vegetable bodies, such as  phosphoric, ammoniacal, marine salt, and others; these are washed from  the earth by rains, and carried down our rivers into the sea; they seem  all here to decompose each other except the marine salt, which has  therefore from the beginning of the habitable world been perpetually  accumulating.    There is a town in the immense salt-mines of Cracow in Poland, with a  market-place, a river, a church, and a famous statue, (here supposed to  be of Lot's wife) by the moist or dry appearance of which the  subterranean inhabitants are said to know when the weather is fair above  ground. The galleries in these mines are so numerous and so intricate,  that workmen have frequently lost their way, their lights having been  burnt out, and have perished before they could be found. Essais, &c. par  M. Macquart. And though the arches of these different stories of  galleries are boldly executed, yet they are not dangerous; as they are  held together or supported by large masses of timber of a foot square;  and these vast timbers remain perfectly sound for many centuries, while  all other pillars whether of brick, cement, or salt soon dissolve or  moulder away. Ibid. Could the timbers over water-mill wheels or cellars,  be thus preserved by occasionally soaking them with brine? These immense  masses of rock-salt seem to have been produced by the evaporation of  sea-water in the early periods of the world by subterranean fires. Dr.  Hutton's Theory of the Earth. See also Theorie des Sources Salees, par  Mr. Struve. Histoire de Sciences de Lausanne. Tom. II. This idea of Dr.  Hutton's is confirmed by a fact mentioned in M. Macquart's Essais sur  Minerologie, who found a great quantity of fossil shells, principally  bi-valves and madre-pores, in the salt-mines of Wialiczka near Cracow.  During the evaporation of the lakes of salt-water, as in artificial  salt-works, the salt begins to crystallize near the edges where the  water is shallowest, forming hollow inverted pyramids; which, when they  become of a certain size, subside by their gravity; if urged by a  stronger fire the salt fuses or forms large cubes; whence the salt  shaped in hollow pyramids, called flake-salt, is better tasted and  preserves flesh better, than the basket or powder salt; because it is  made by less heat and thence contains more of the marine acid. The sea-  water about our island contains from about one twenty-eighth to one  thirtieth part of sea-salt, and about one eightieth of magnesian salt.  See Brownrigg on Salt.

[_Hence orient Nitre_. l. 143. Nitre is found in Bengal naturally  crystallized, and is swept by brooms from earths and stones, and thence  called sweepings of nitre. It has lately been found in large quantities  in a natural bason of calcareous earth at Molfetta in Italy, both in  thin strata between the calcareous beds, and in efflorescences of  various beautiful leafy and hairy forms. An account of this nitre-bed is  given by Mr. Zimmerman and abridged in Rozier's Journal de Physique  Fevrier. 1790. This acid appears to be produced in all situations where  animal and vegetable matters are compleatly decomposed, and which are  exposed to the action of the air as on the walls of stables, and  slaughter-houses; the crystals are prisms furrowed by longitudinal  groves.    Dr. Priestley discovered that nitrous air or gas which he obtained by  dissolving metals in nitrous acid, would combine rapidly with vital air,  and produce with it a true nitrous acid; forming red clouds during the  combination; the two airs occupy only the space before occupied by one  of them, and at the same time heat is given out from the new  combination. This dimunition of the bulk of a mixture of nitrous gas and  vital air, Dr. Priestley ingeniously used as a test of the purity of the  latter; a discovery of the greatest importance in the analysis of airs.    Mr. Cavendish has since demonstrated that two parts of vital air or  oxygene, and one part of phlogistic air or azote, being long exposed to  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9624"],[0,"Directions for Cookery, in its Various Branches (#13)"],[1,"before you send it to table. Eat it  with pepper, vinegar, and mustard.      TRIPE AND OYSTERS.    Having boiled the tripe in milk and water, for four or five hours  till it is quite tender, gut it up into small pieces. Put it into  a stew-pan with just milk enough to cover it, and a few blades of  mace. Let it stew about five minutes, and then put in the oysters,  adding a large piece of butter rolled-in flour, and salt and  cayenne pepper to your taste. Let it stew five minutes longer, and  then send it to table in a tureen; first skimming off whatever fat  may float on the surface.      TO FRY TRIPE.    Boil the tripe the day before, till it is quite tender, which it  will not be in less than four or five hours. Then cover it and set  it away. Next day cut it into long slips, and dip each piece into  beaten yolk of egg, and afterwards roll them in grated bread  crumbs. Have ready in a frying-pan over the fire, some good beef-dripping.  When it is boiling hot put in the tripe, and fry it  about ten minutes, till of a light brown.    You may serve it up with onion sauce.    Boiled tripe that has been left from the dinner of the preceding  day may be fried in this manner.      PEPPER POT.    Take four pounds of tripe, and four ox feet. Put them into a large  pot with as much water as will cover them, some whole pepper, and  a little salt. Hang them over the fire early in the morning. Let  them boil slowly, keeping the pot closely covered. When the tripe  is quite tender, and the ox feet boiled to pieces, take them out,  and skim the liquid and strain it. Then cut the tripe into small  pieces; put it back into the pot, and pour the soup or liquor over  it. Have ready some sweet herbs chopped fine, some sliced onions,  and some sliced potatoes. Make some small dumplings with flour and  batter. Season the vegetables well with pepper and salt, and put  them into the pot. Have ready a kettle of boiling water, and pour  on as much as will keep the ingredients covered while boiling, but  take care not to weaken the taste by putting too much water. Add a  large piece of butter rolled in flour, and lastly put in the  dumplings. Let it boil till all the things are thoroughly done,  and then serve it up in the tureen.      TO BOIL A SMOKED TONGUE.    In buying dried tongues, choose those that are thick and plump,  and that have the smoothest skins. They are the most likely to be  young and tender.    A smoked tongue should soak in cold water at least all night. One  that is very hard and dry will require twenty-four hours' soaking.  When you boil it put it into a pot full of cold water. Set it over  a slow fire that it may heat gradually for an hour before it comes  to a boil. Then keep it simmering from three and a half to four  hours, according to its size and age. Probe it with a fork, and do  not take it up till it is tender throughout. Send it to table with  mashed potato laid round it, and garnish with parsley. Do not  split it in half when you dish it, as is the practice with some  cooks. Cutting it lengthways spoils the flavour, and renders it  comparatively insipid.    If you wish to serve up the tongue very handsomely, rub it with  yolk of egg after you take it from the pot, and strew over it  grated bread crumbs; baste it with butter, and set it before the  fire till it becomes of a light brown. Cover the root (which is  always an unsightly object) with thick sprigs of double parsley;  and (instead of mashed potato) lay slices of currant jelly all  round the tongue.      TO BOIL A SALTED OR PICKLED TONGUE.    Put it into boiling water, and let it boil three hours or more,  according to its size. When you take it out peel and trim it, and  send it to table surrounded with mashed potato, and garnished with  sliced carrot.      TO CORN BEEF.    Wash the beef well, after it has lain awhile in cold water. Then  drain and examine it, take out all the kernels, and rub it  plentifully with salt. It will imbibe the salt more readily after  being washed. In cold weather warm the salt by placing it before  the fire. This will cause it to penetrate the meat more  thoroughly.    In summer do not attempt to corn any beef that has not been fresh  killed, and even then it will not keep more than a day and a half  or two days. Wash and dry it, and rub a great deal of salt well  into it. Cover it carefully, and keep it in a cold dry cellar.    Pork is corned in the same manner.      TO PICKLE BEEF OR TONGUES.    The beef must be fresh killed, and of the best kind. You must wipe  every piece well, to dry it from the blood and moisture. To fifty  pounds of meat allow two pounds and a quarter of coarse salt, two  pounds and a quarter of fine salt, one ounce and a half of  saltpetre, one pound and a half of brown sugar, and one quart of  molasses. Mix all these ingredients well together, boil and skim  it for about twenty minutes, and when no more scum rises, take it  from the fire. Have ready the beef in a large tub, or in a barrel;  pour the brine gradually upon it with a ladle, and as it cools rub  it well into every part of the meat. A molasses hogshead sawed in  two is a good receptacle for pickled meat. Cover it well with a  thick cloth, and look at it frequently, skimming off whatever may  float on the top, and basting the meat with the brine. In about a  fortnight the beef will be fit for use.    Tongues may be put into the same cask with the beef, one or two at  a time, as you procure them from the butcher. None of them will be  ready for smoking in less than six weeks; but they had best remain  in pickle two or three months. They should not be sent to the  smoke-house later than March. If you do them at home, they will  require three weeks' smoking over a wood fire. Hang them with the  root or large end upwards. When done, sew up each tongue tightly  in coarse linen, and hang them up in a dark dry cellar.    Pickled tongues without smoking are seldom liked.    The last of October is a good time for putting meat into pickle.  If the weather is too warm or too cold, it will not take the salt  well.    In the course of the winter the pickle may probably require a  second boiling with additional ingredients.    Half an ounce of pearl-ash added to the other articles will make  the meat more tender, but many persons thinks it injures the  taste.    The meat must always be kept completely immersed in the brine. To  effect this a heavy board should be laid upon it.      DRIED OR SMOKED BEEF.    The best part for this purpose is the round, which you must desire  the butcher to cut into four pieces. Wash the meat and dry it well  in a cloth. Grind or beat to powder an equal quantity of cloves  and allspice, and having mixed them together, rub them well into  the beef with your hand. The spice will be found a great  improvement both to the taste and smell of the meat. Have ready a  pickle made precisely as that in the preceding article. Boil and  skim it, and (the meat having been thoroughly rubbed all over with  the spice) pour on the pickle, as before directed. Keep the beef  in the pickle at least six weeks, and then smoke it about three  weeks.    Smoked beef is brought on the tea-table either shaved into thin  chips without cooking, or chipped and fried with a little butter  in a skillet, and served up hot.    This receipt for dried or smoked beef will answer equally well for  venison ham, which is also used as a relish at the tea-table.    Mutton hams may be prepared in the same way.      POTTED BEEF.    Take a good piece of a round of beef, and cut off all the fat. Rub  the lean well with salt, and let it lie two days. Then put it into  a jar, and add to it a little water in the proportion of half a  pint to three pounds of meat. Cover the jar as closely as  possible, (the best cover will be a coarse paste or dough) and set  it in a slow oven, or in a vessel of boiling water for about four  hours. Then drain off all the gravy and set the meat before the  fire that all the moisture may be drawn out. Pull or cut it to  pieces and pound it for a long time in a mortar with pepper,  allspice, cloves, mace, nutmeg, and oiled fresh butter, adding  these ingredients gradually, and moistening it with a little of  the gravy. You must pound it to a fine paste, or till it becomes  of the consistence of cream, cheese.    Put it into potting cans, and cover it an inch thick with fresh  butter that has been melted, skimmed, and strained. Tie a leather  over each pot, and keep them closely covered. Set them in a dry  place.    Game and poultry may be potted in this manner          VEAL.      GENERAL REMARKS.    The fore-quarter of a calf comprises the neck, breast, and  shoulder: the hind-quarter consists of the loin, fillet, and  knuckle. Separate dishes are made of the head, heart, liver, and  sweet-bread. The flesh of good veal is firm and dry, and the joints  stiff. The lean is of a very light delicate red, and the fat quite  white. In buying the head see that the eyes look full, plump, and  lively; if they are dull and sunk the calf has been killed too  long. In buying calves' feet for jelly or soup, endeavour to get  those that have been singed only and not skinned; as a great deal  of gelatinous substance is contained in the skin. Veal should  always be thoroughly cooked, and never brought to table rare or  under-done, like beef or mutton. The least redness in the meat or  gravy is disgusting.    Veal suet may be used as a substitute for that of beef; also veal-dripping.      TO ROAST A LOIN OF VEAL.    The loin is the best part of the calf. It is always roasted. See  that your fire is clear and hot, and broad enough to brown both  ends. Cover the fat of the kidney and the back with paper to  prevent it from scorching. A large loin of veal will require _at  least_ four hours and a half to roast it sufficiently. At first  set the roaster at a tolerable distance from the fire that the  meat may heat gradually in the beginning;"]]]
