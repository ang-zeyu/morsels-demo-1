This night presents to the public all the outward and showy parade which  marks the Mayndhie procession of a real wedding ceremony, of which I  propose speaking further in another place. This display at Mahurrum is  attended with considerable expense; consequently, the very rich only  observe the out-door formalities to be exhibited on this occasion; yet all  classes, according to their means, remember the event, and celebrate it at  home.    The Mayndhie procession of one great personage, in Native cities, is  directed--by previous arrangement--to the Emaum-baarah of a superior. I  was present, on one occasion, when the Mayndhie of the Prime Minister of  Oude was sent to the King's Emaum-baarah, called Shaah Nudghiff,[2]--from  the mausoleum of Ali, of which it is an exact representation, on a small  scale.    It is situated near the banks of the river Goomtie,[3] some distance from  the palace at Lucknow; the entrance to the outer court, or quadrangle, is  by a handsome gateway of brickwork plastered and polished, resembling  marble. On each side of the gateway, and carried up the two sides, in a  line with the building, are distinct apartments, designed for the abode of  the distressed and houseless poor; the back of these apartments forms a  substantial wall or enclosure. The Shaah Nudghiff faces the gateway, and  appears to be a square building, on a broad base of flights of steps, with  a cupola roof; the interior is paved with black and white marble  tesselated, the walls and dome neatly ornamented with plaster and gold in  relief, the beading, cornices, &c. of gold, to correspond on a  stone-colour ground. The cupola and cornices on the outside are richly  ornamented with plaster designs, relieved with gold; on the summit of the  dome is placed a crown, of pure silver, gilt, of an immense size.    The decorations of the interior, for the season of Mahurrum, were on a  scale of grandeur not easily to be conveyed by description. The walls were  well covered with handsome glasses and mirrors; the splendid  chandeliers,--one containing a hundred wax lights,--in every variety, and  relieved with coloured lamps--amber, blue, and green,--mellowing the light,  and giving a fairy-like effect to the brilliant scene. In the centre of  the building stood the green glass Tazia, surrounded by wax lights; on  the right of which was placed an immense lion, and on the left, a fish,[4]  both formed of the same bright emerald-green glass as the Tazia. The  richness and elegance of the banners,--which were numerous and well  arranged,--could be equalled only by the costliness of their several  mountings.    In Asiatic buildings niches and recesses prevail in all convenient  situations, and here they are appropriated for the reception of the relics  of antiquity and curiosities; such as models of Mecca, the tent of Hosein,  the gate of Kraabaallah, &c.; these three are made of pure silver, and  rest on tables of the same metal. Many curious sabres, of all ages,  shields, chain armour of the ancients, lances, &c., arranged with much  taste, adorn the interior.    The pulpit (mhembur) is of silver, and of very handsome workmanship; the  whole of the fitting up and arrangements had been made under the eye of  his Majesty, and to his good taste may be ascribed all the merit of the  well-ordered display for these occasions. He delighted in visiting this  place, which he not only designed as a tribute of his respect to the  Emaums, but as the future repository for his own remains, when this world  should cease to be his place of joy, or anxious care. His intention has  been fulfilled--he died in 1827, aged fifty years, much and justly beloved  and regretted by all who knew him; his funeral obsequies were impressively  grand, according to Mussulmaun custom. This good and amiable King was  succeeded by his only son Nusseer ood deen Hyder,[5] who had just  completed his twenty-second year when he began to reign.    On the evening of Mayndhie, the crowds of admiring people were admitted to  view their Paidshah's (King's) exhibition; until the distant sounds of  musketry announced the approach of the spectacle, when the multitude were  desired to quit the Emaum-baarah. Hundreds still lingering, could not be  prevailed on to depart, except by the stripes dealt out unsparingly from  the whips of the hurkaarahs[6] and peons, appointed to keep order on the  occasion. The place cleared, and quiet restored, I had leisure to view the  fairy-like palace of splendour, before the bustle of the procession  reached the building. I could hardly persuade myself the picture before me  was not a dream, instead of a reality.    I stood at the entrance to watch the approach of the minister's train,  through the gateway into the illuminated quadrangle. Spacious as this  court-yard is, it was nearly filled with the many people forming the  Mayndhie parade. I should imagine there could not be less than three  thousand souls engaged in this service, including the match-lock soldiery.  Several trays of Mayndhie are brought, with the other requisites for the  usual forms of marriage gifts, such as sweetmeats, dried fruits, garlands  of sweet jasmine, imitative beds of flowers, composed of uberuck: in some  of the flowers, fireworks were concealed, to be let off in the quadrangle.  An imitative tomb on a bier is also paraded, together with the palkie and  chundole of silver, which are the covered conveyances for females of the  royal family, or such of the nobility as are privileged by grants from the  crown; all other females use the covered palkie, mahanah, dhollee, and the  rutt.[7] Several bands of music follow, and torches out of number. The  elephants, camels, cavalry, &c., are left in the open space, outside the  gateway--the gentlemen, dismounting, enter with Dhull Dhull and the trays  of Mayndhie.    I trembled for the probable destruction of the brilliant ornaments in the  Emaum-baarah, when I heard the noble animal was to make the circuit round  the Tazia. Dhull Dhull, being led in, went up the steps with little  difficulty; and to my astonishment, the gentle creature paced the  tesselated floor, in very slow time, without once slipping, or seeming  concerned at the novelty of his situation; indeed, this docile animal  seemed to me the only living thing present that felt no interest in the  scene--rendered more attractive and conspicuous by the gentle manners of  the pretty Dhull Dhull himself. The circuit being made, he was conducted  back into the court-yard, without the slightest accident or confusion  occurring during his visit to the Emaum-baarah.    The model of the tomb of Cossum, the chundole and palkie, the trays of  Mayndhie, sweetmeats, &c. were deposited here until the tenth day, when  they accompany the King's temporary Tazia cavalcade to Kraabaallah for  interment.    The ceremonies performed on this night of Mayndhie resemble, in every  particular, those of the same rank of persons on the actual solemnization  of a wedding, even to the distribution of money amongst the populace who  crowd in multitudes on such occasions, though apparently more eager for  the prize than the sight.    The most imposing spectacle in the celebration of Mahurrum, is reserved  for the last day;[8] and, judging from the activity of all classes, the  zealous exertions of the multitude, the deep interest marked on every face,  male and female, a mere spectator might well imagine this morning to be of  more importance than any other in the Mussulmaun's catalogue of days.    At the earliest hour of the dawning day, the preparations for the march  being complete,--which had occupied the hours usually devoted to  sleep,--the streets and roads present a very animated picture. From the  bustle and outpouring of the multitude, on this one absorbing engagement,  a stranger might be led back in imagination to the flight from Egypt; the  object, however, is very different from that of the children of Israel.  The order of the day being to commemorate the death of Hosein, a grand  military funeral is pourtrayed in each person's cavalcade, all pressing  forward to their chosen Kraabaallah,--the poor man, with his humble Tazia  and flags, falling in the rear of the more affluent person's display, as  well for protection as for speed. There is so much of similarity in these  processions, that the description of one will be sufficient to convey the  idea of the whole, as they pass on in succession to the chosen place of  burial.[9]    The consecrated banners take the precedence, in the order of march,  carried by men on elephants; then a band of music. Next comes the  jillewdhar[10] (sword-bearer), supporting, on a black staff, the bow  reversed, with brilliant swords suspended; on each side of him are men  bearing black poles, on which are fixed immense long streamers of black  unspun silk,--designed to symbolize grief, despair, &c.    Then follows the horse, caparisoned as on the day of consecrating the  banners; it is attended by servants, in the same order as when a prince  rides out,--viz. a man with the afthaadah[11] (or sun),--the well-dressed  grooms, holding the bridle rein on either side,--a man with the chowrie of  peacock's feathers in a silver handle,--chobdhaahs[12] with long silver  and gold staffs,--sota badhaahs,[13] with short staffs resembling fish, of  the same materials,--hurkaarahs (running-footmen, or messengers), bearing  small triangular banners with silver handles,--shoe-bearers, &c.    The royal chattah[14] (umbrella), of embroidered velvet, is supported over  the head of Dhull Dhull. This article in its plain garb, so generally used  in Europe, is, in Hindoostaun, an original distinguishing mark of royalty,  gracing the King's throne in lieu of a canopy. In Oude, the chattah cannot  be used by the subject when in view of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13166"],[0,"The Psalms of David (#14)"],[1," and true,  \"But deal in theft and lies.    4 \"Could you expect to 'scape my sight,  \"And sin without control?  \"But I shall bring your crimes to light,  \"With anguish in your soul.\"    5 Consider, ye that slight the Lord,  Before his wrath appear;  If once you fall beneath his sword,  There's no deliverer there.      Psalm 50:4. L. M.  Hypocrisy exposed.    1 The Lord, the Judge, his churches warns,  Let hypocrites attend and fear,  Who place their hope in rites and forms,  But make not faith nor love their care.    2 Vile wretches dare rehearse his name  With lips of falsehood and deceit;  A friend or brother they defame,  And soothe and flatter those they hate.    3 They watch to do their neighbours wrong;  Yet dare to seek their Maker's face;  They take his covenant on their tongue,  But break his laws, abuse his grace.    4 To heaven they lift their hands unclean,  Defil'd with lust, defil'd with blood;  By night they practise every sin,  By day their mouths draw near to God.    5 And while his judgments long delay,  They grow secure and sin the more;  They think he sleeps as well as they,  And put far off the dreadful hour.    6 O dreadful hour! when God draws near,  And sets their crimes before their eyes!  His wrath their guilty souls shall tear,  And no deliverer dare to rise.      Psalm 50:5. To a new Tune.  The last judgment.    1 The Lord the Sovereign sends his summons forth,  Calls the south nations, and awakes the north;  From east to west the sounding orders spread  Thro' distant worlds and regions of the dead:  No more shall atheists mock his long delay;  His vengeance sleeps no more: behold the day!    2 Behold the Judge descends; his guards are nigh;  Tempest and fire attend him down the sky:  Heaven, earth and hell draw near; let all things come  To hear his justice and the sinners doom:  But gather first my saints (the Judge commands)  Bring them, ye angels, from their distant lands.    3 Behold! my covenant stands for ever good,  Seal'd by the eternal sacrifice in blood,  And sign'd with all their names; the Greek, the Jew,  That paid the ancient worship or the new.  There's no distinction here: come spread their thrones,  And near me seat my favorites and my sons.    4 I their almighty Saviour and their God,  I am their Judge: ye heavens, proclaim abroad  My just eternal sentence, and declare  Those awful truths that sinners dread to hear:  Sinners in Zion, tremble and retire;  I doom the painted hypocrite to fire.    5 Not for the want of goats or bullocks slain  Do I condemn thee; bulls and goats are vain  Without the flames of love: in vain the store  Of brutal offerings that were mine before;  Mine are the tamer beasts and savage breed,  Flocks, herds, and fields, and forests where they feed.    6 If I were hungry would I ask thee food?  When did I thirst, or drink thy bullocks blood?  Can I be flatter'd with thy cringing bows,  Thy solemn chatterings and fantastic vows?  Are my eyes charm'd thy vestments to behold,  Glaring in gems, and gay in woven gold?    7 Unthinking wretch! how couldst thou hope to please  A God, a spirit, with such toys as these?  While with my grace and statutes on thy tongue,  Thou lov'st deceit, and dost thy brother wrong;  In vain to pious forms thy zeal pretends,  Thieves and adulterers are thy chosen friends.    8 Silent I waited with lone-suffering love,  But didst thou hope that I should ne'er reprove?  And cherish such an impious thought within,  That God the righteous would indulge thy sin?  Behold my terrors now: my thunders roll,  And thy own crimes affright thy guilty soul.    9 Sinners, awake betimes; ye fools, be wise;  Awake, before this dreadful morning rise;  Change your vain thoughts, your crooked works amend,  Fly to the Saviour, make the Judge your friend;  Lest like a lion his last vengeance tear  Your trembling souls, and no deliverer near.      Psalm 50:6. To the old proper Tune.  The last judgment.    1 The God of glory sends his summons forth,  Calls the south nations, and awakes the north;  From east to west the sov'reign orders spread,  Thro' distant worlds, and regions of the dead:  The trumpet sounds; hell trembles; heaven rejoices;  Lift up your heads, ye saints, with cheerful voices.    2 No more shall atheists mock his long delay;  His vengeance sleeps no more; behold the day;  Behold the Judge descends; his guards are nigh;  Tempests and fire attend him down the sky.  When God appears, all nature shall adore him;  While sinners tremble, saints rejoice before him,    3 \"Heaven, earth, and hell, draw near; let all things come  \"To hear my justice and the sinner's doom;  \"But gather first my saints,\" the Judge commands,  \"Bring them, ye angels from their distant lands:\"  When Christ returns, wake every cheerful passion,  And shout, ye saints; he comes for your salvation.    4 \"Behold my covenant stands for ever good,  \"Seal'd by th' eternal sacrifice in blood,  \"And sign'd with all their names, the Greek, the Jew,  \"That paid the ancient worship or the new.\"  There's no distinction here: join all your voices,  And raise your heads, ye saints, for heaven rejoices.    5 \"Here (saith the Lord) ye angels, spread their thrones:  \"And near me seat my favorites and my sons:  \"Come, my redeem'd, possess the joys prepar'd  \"Ere time began! 'tis your divine reward:\"  When Christ returns, wake every cheerful passion,  And shout, ye saints; he comes for your salvation.    PAUSE THE FIRST.    6 \"I am the Saviour, I th' almighty God,  \"I am the Judge: ye heavens, proclaim abroad  \"My just eternal sentence, and declare  \"Those awful truths that sinners dread to hear,\"  When God appears all nature shall adore him;  While sinners tremble, saints rejoice before him.    7 \"Stand forth, thou bold blasphemer and profane,  \"Now feel my wrath, nor call my threatenings vain,  \"Thou hypocrite, once drest in saint's attire,  \"I doom the painted hypocrite to fire.\"  Judgment proceeds; hell trembles; heaven rejoices;  Lift up your heads, ye saints, with cheerful voices.    8 \"Not for the want of goats or bullocks slain  \"Do I condemn thee; bulls and goats are vain  \"Without the flames of love; in vain the store  \"Of brutal offerings that were mine before:\"  Earth is the Lord's; all nature shall adore him;  While sinners tremble, saints rejoice before him.    9 \"If I were hungry, would I ask thee food?  \"When did I thirst, or drink thy bullocks blood?  \"Mine are the tamer beasts and savage breed,  \"Flocks, herds, and fields, and forests where they feed:\"  All is the Lord's; he rules the wide creation:  Gives sinners vengeance, and the saints salvation.    10 \"Can I be flatter'd with thy cringing bows,  \"Thy solemn chatterings and fantastic vows?  \"Are my eyes charm'd thy vestments to behold,  \"Glaring in gems, and gay in woven gold?\"  God is the judge of hearts; no fair disguises  Can screen the guilty when his vengeance rises.    PAUSE THE SECOND.    11 \"Unthinking wretch! how couldst thou hope to please  \"A God, a spirit with such toys as these!  \"While with my grace and statutes on thy tongue,  \"Thou lov'st deceit, and dost thy brother wrong!\"  Judgment proceeds; hell trembles; heaven rejoices:  Lift up your heads, ye saints, with cheerful voices.    12 \"In vain to pious forms thy zeal pretends,  \"Thieves and adulterers are thy chosen friends;  \"While the false flatterer at my altar waits,  \"His harden'd soul divine instruction hates.\"  God is the judge of hearts; no fair disguises  Can screen the guilty when his vengeance rises.    13 \"Silent I waited with long suffering love;  \"But didst thou hope that I should ne'er reprove?  \"And cherish such an impious thought within,  \"That the All-Holy would indulge thy sin?\"  See, God appears; all nature joins t' adore him;  Judgment proceeds, and sinners fall before him.    14 \"Behold my terrors now; my thunders roll,  \"And thy own crimes affright thy guilty soul;  \"Now like a lion shall my vengeance tear  \"Thy bleeding heart, and no deliverer near:\"  Judgment concludes; hell trembles; heaven rejoices;  Lift up your heads, ye saints, with cheerful voices..    EPIPHONEMA.    15 Sinners, awake betimes; ye fools, be wise;  Awake before this dreadful morning rise:  Change your vain thoughts, your crooked works amend,  Fly to the Saviour, make the Judge your friend:  Then join the saints: wake every cheerful passion;  When Christ returns, he comes for your salvation.      Psalm 51:1. First Part. L. M.  A penitent pleading for pardon.    1 Shew pity, Lord, O Lord, forgive,  Let a repenting rebel live:  Are not thy mercies large and free?  May not a sinner trust in thee?    2 My crimes are great, but not surpass  The power and glory of thy grace;  Great God, thy nature hath no bound,  So let thy pardoning love be found.    3 O wash my Soul from every sin,  And make my guilty conscience clean;  Here on my heart the burden lies,  And past offences pain my eyes.    4 My lips with shame my sins confess  Against thy law, against thy grace:  Lord, should thy judgment grow severe,  I am condemn'd, but thou art clear.    5 Should sudden vengeance seize my breath,  I must pronounce thee just in death;  And if my soul were sent to hell,  Thy righteous law approves it well.    6 Yet save a trembling sinner, Lord,  Whose hope, still hovering round thy word,  Would light on some sweet promise there,  Some sure support against despair.      Psalms 51:2. Second Part. L. M.  Original and actual sin confessed.    1 Lord, I am vile, conceiv'd in sin;  And born unholy and unclean;  Sprung from the man whose guilty fall  Corrupts the race, and taints us all.    2 Soon as we draw our infant-breath,  The seeds of sin grow up for death;  Thy law demands a perfect heart,  But we're defil'd in every part.    3 [Great God, create my heart anew,  And form my spirit pure and true:  O make me wise betimes to spy  My danger, and my remedy.]    4 Behold I fall before thy face;  My only refuge is thy grace:  No outward forms can make me clean;  The"]]]
