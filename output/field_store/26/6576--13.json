Here dwelt the Shadow I had \"imagined\" weeks  ago, and in it struggled armies of lost souls as in the depths of some  bottomless pit whence there is no escape. The layers mingled, fighting  against themselves in endless torture. It was in this great Shadow I had  clairvoyantly seen Mabel, but about its fearful mouth, I now was  certain, hovered another figure of darkness, a figure who sought to keep  it in existence, since to her thought were due those lampless depths of  woe without escape.... Towards me the multitudes now surged.    It was a sound and a movement that brought me back into myself. The  great dock at the farther end of the room just then struck the hour of  three. That was the sound. And the movement--? I was aware that a figure  was passing across the distant center of the floor. Instantly I dropped  back into the arena of my little human terror. My hand again clutched  stupidly at the pistol butt. I drew back into the folds of the heavy  curtain. And the figure advanced.    I remember every detail. At first it seemed to me enormous--this  advancing shadow--far beyond human scale; but as it came nearer, I  measured it, though not consciously, by the organ pipes that gleamed in  faint colors, just above its gradual soft approach. It passed them,  already halfway across the great room. I saw then that its stature was  that of ordinary men. The prolonged booming of the clock died away. I  heard the footfall, shuffling upon the polished boards. I heard another  sound--a voice, low and monotonous, droning as in prayer. The figure was  speaking. It was a woman. And she carried in both hands before her a  small object that faintly shimmered--a glass of water. And then I  recognized her.    There was still an instant's time before she reached me, and I made use  of it. I shrank back, flattening myself against the wall. Her voice  ceased a moment, as she turned and carefully drew the curtains together  behind her, dosing them with one hand. Oblivious of my presence, though  she actually touched my dressing gown with the hand that pulled the  cords, she resumed her dreadful, solemn march, disappearing at length  down the long vista of the corridor like a shadow.    But as she passed me, her voice began again, so that I heard each word  distinctly as she uttered it, her head aloft, her figure upright, as  though she moved at the head of a procession:    \"A drop of cold water, given in His name, shall moisten their burning  tongues.\"    It was repeated monotonously over and over again, droning down into the  distance as she went, until at length both voice and figure faded into  the shadows at the farther end.    For a time, I have no means of measuring precisely, I stood in that dark  corner, pressing my back against the wall, and would have drawn the  curtains down to hide me had I dared to stretch an arm out. The dread  that presently the woman would return passed gradually away. I realized  that the air had emptied, the crowd her presence had stirred into  activity had retreated; I was alone in the gloomy under-space of the  odious building.... Then I remembered suddenly again the terrified women  waiting for me on that upper landing; and realized that my skin was wet  and freezing cold after a profuse perspiration. I prepared to retrace my  steps. I remember the effort it cost me to leave the support of the wall  and covering darkness of my corner, and step out into the grey light of  the corridor. At first I sidled, then, finding this mode of walking  impossible, turned my face boldly and walked quickly, regardless that my  dressing gown set the precious objects shaking as I passed. A wind that  sighed mournfully against the high, small windows seemed to have got  inside the corridor as well; it felt so cold; and every moment I dreaded  to see the outline of the woman's figure as she waited in recess or  angle against the wall for me to pass.    Was there another thing I dreaded even more? I cannot say. I only know  that the first baize doors had swung to behind me, and the second ones  were close at hand, when the great dim thunder caught me, pouring up  with prodigious volume so that it, seemed to roll out from another  world. It shook the very bowels of the building. I was closer to it than  that other time, when it had followed me from the goblin garden. There  was strength and hardness in it, as of metal reverberation. Some touch  of numbness, almost of paralysis, must surely have been upon me that I  felt no actual terror, for I remember even turning and standing still to  hear it better. \"That is the Noise,\" my thought ran stupidly, and I  think I whispered it aloud; \"the Doors are closing.\" The wind outside  against the windows was audible, so it cannot have been really loud, yet  to me it was the biggest, deepest sound I have ever heard, but so far  away, with such awful remoteness in it, that I had to doubt my own ears  at the same time. It seemed underground--the rumbling of earthquake  gates that shut remorselessly within the rocky Earth--stupendous  ultimate thunder. They were shut off from help again. The doors had  closed.    I felt a storm of pity, an agony of bitter, futile hate sweep through  me. My memory of the figure changed then. The Woman with the glass of  cooling water had stepped down from Heaven; but the Man--or was it Men?  --who smeared this terrible layer of belief and Thought upon the  world!...    I crossed the dining room--it was fancy, of course, that held my eyes  from glancing at the portrait for fear I should see it smiling approval  --and so finally reached the hall, where the light from the floor above  seemed now quite bright in comparison. All the doors I closed carefully  behind me; but first I had to open them. The woman had closed every one.  Up the stairs, then, I actually ran, two steps at a time. My sister was  standing outside Mabel's door. By her face I knew that she had also  heard. There was no need to ask. I quickly made my mind up.    \"There's nothing,\" I said, and detailed briefly my tour of search. \"All  is quiet and undisturbed downstairs.\" May God forgive me!    She beckoned to me, closing the door softly behind her. My heart beat  violently a moment, then stood still.    \"Mabel,\" she said aloud.    It was like the sentence of a judge, that one short word.    I tried to push past her and go in, but she stopped me with her arm. She  was wholly mistress of herself, I saw.    \"Hush!\" she said in a lower voice. \"I've got her round again with  brandy. She's sleeping quietly now. We won't disturb her.\"    She drew me farther out into the landing, and as she did so, the clock  in the hall below struck half-past three. I had stood, then, thirty  minutes in the corridor below. \"You've been such a long time.\" she said  simply. \"I feared for you,\" and she took my hand in her own that was  cold and clammy.          Chapter VIII      And then, while that dreadful house stood listening about us in the  early hours of this chill morning upon the edge of winter, she told me,  with laconic brevity, things about Mabel that I heard as from a  distance. There was nothing so unusual or tremendous in the short  recital, nothing indeed I might not have already guessed for myself. It  was the time and scene, the inference, too, that made it so afflicting:  the idea that Mabel believed herself so utterly and hopelessly lost--  beyond recovery damned.    That she had loved him with so passionate a devotion that she had given  her soul into his keeping, this certainly I had not divined--probably  because I had never thought about it one way or the other. He had  \"converted\" her, I knew, but that she had subscribed whole-heartedly to  that most cruel and ugly of his dogmas--this was new to me, and came  with a certain shock as I heard it. In love, of course, the weaker  nature is receptive to all manner of suggestion. This man had  \"suggested\" his pet brimstone lake so vividly that she had listened and  believed. He had frightened her into heaven; and his heaven, a definite  locality in the skies, had its foretaste here on earth in miniature--The  Towers, house, and garden. Into his dolorous scheme of a handful saved  and millions damned, his enclosure, as it were, of sheep and goats, he  had swept her before she was aware of it. Her mind no longer was her  own. And it was Mrs. Marsh who kept the thought-stream open, though  tempered, as she deemed, with that touch of craven, superstitious mercy.    But what I found it difficult to understand, and still more difficult to  accept, was that, during her year abroad, she had been so haunted with a  secret dread of that hideous after-death that she had finally revolted  and tried to recover that clearer state of mind she had enjoyed before  the religious bully had stunned her--yet had tried in vain. She had  returned to The Towers to find her soul again, only to realize that it  was lost eternally. The cleaner state of mind lay then beyond recovery.  In the reaction that followed the removal of his terrible \"suggestion,\"  she felt the crumbling of all that he had taught her, but searched in  vain for the peace and beauty his teachings had destroyed. Nothing came  to replace these. She was empty, desolate, hopeless; craving her former  joy and carelessness, she found only hate and diabolical calculation.  This man, whom she had loved to the point of losing her soul for him,  had bequeathed to her one black and fiery thing--the terror of the  damned. His thinking wrapped her in this iron garment that held her  fast.    All this Frances told me, far more briefly than I have here repeated it.  In her eyes and gestures and laconic sentences lay the conviction of  great beating issues and of menacing drama my own description fails to  recapture. It was all so incongruous and remote from the world I lived  in that more than once a smile,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11093"],[0,"Trailin'! (#14)"],[1,"in front of the little building with its rickety  walls guiltless of paint save for the one great sign inscribed with  uncertain letters.    He swung from the saddle, tossed the reins over the head of the mustang,  made a stride forward--and then checked himself with a soft curse and  reached for his gun.    For the door of the bar dashed open and down the steps rushed a tall man  with light yellow moustache, so long that it literally blew on either  side over his shoulders as he ran; in either hand he carried a  revolver---a two-gun man, fleeing, perhaps, from another murder.    For Nash recognized in him a character notorious through a thousand  miles of the range, Sandy Ferguson, nicknamed by the colour of that  famous moustache, which was envied and dreaded so far and so wide. It  was not fear that made Nash halt, for otherwise he would have finished  the motion and whipped out his gun; but at least it was something  closely akin to fear.    For that matter, there were unmistakable signs in Sandy himself of what  would have been called arrant terror in any other man. His face was so  bloodless that the pallor showed even through the leathery tan; one eye  stared wildly, the other being sheltered under a clumsy patch which  could not quite conceal the ugly bruise beneath. Under his great  moustache his lips were as puffed and swollen as the lips of a negro.    Staggering in his haste, he whirled a few paces from the house and  turned, his guns levelled. At the same moment the door opened and the  perspiring figure of little fat Flanders appeared. Scorn and anger  rather than hate or any bloodlust appeared in his face. His right arm,  hanging loosely at his side, held a revolver, and he seemed to have the  greatest unconcern for the levelled weapons of the gunman.    He made a gesture with that armed hand, and Sandy winced as though a  whiplash had flicked him.    \"Steady up, damn your eyes!\" bellowed Flanders, \"and put them guns away.  Put 'em up; hear me?\"    To the mortal astonishment of Nash, Sandy obeyed, keeping the while a  fascinated eye upon the little Dutchman.    \"Now climb your hoss and beat it, and if I ever find you in reach again,  I'll send my kid out to rope you and give you a hoss-whippin'.\"    The gun fighter lost no time. A single leap carried him into his saddle  and he was off over the sand with a sharp rattle of the beating hoofs.    \"Well,\" breathed Nash, \"I'll be hanged.\"    \"Sure you will,\" suggested Flanders, at once changing his frown for a  smile of somewhat professional good nature, as one who greeted an old  customer, \"sure you will unless you come in an' have a drink on the  house. I want something myself to forget what I been doin'. I feel like  the dog-catcher.\"    Steve, deeply meditative, strode into the room.    \"Partner,\" he said gravely to Flanders, \"I've always prided myself on  having eyes a little better than the next one, but just now I guess I  must of been seein' double. Seemed to me that that was Sandy Ferguson  that you hot-footed out of that door--or has Sandy got a double?\"    \"Nope,\" said the bartender, wiping the last of the perspiration from his  forehead, \"that's Sandy, all right.\"    \"Then gimme a big drink. I need it.\"    The bottle spun expertly across the bar, and the glasses tinkled after.    \"Funny about him, all right,\" nodded Flanders, \"but then it's happened  the same way with others I could tell about. As long as he was winnin'  Sandy was the king of any roost. The minute he lost a fight he wasn't  worth so many pounds of salt pork. Take a hoss; a fine hoss is often  jest the same. Long as it wins nothin' can touch some of them blooded  boys. But let 'em go under the wire second, maybe jest because they's  packing twenty pounds too much weight, and they're never any good any  more. Any second-rater can lick 'em. I lost five hundred iron boys on a  hoss that laid down like that.\"    \"All of which means,\" suggested Nash, \"that Sandy has been licked?\"    \"Licked? No, he ain't been licked, but he's been plumb annihilated,  washed off the map, cleaned out, faded, rubbed into the dirt; if there  was some stronger way of puttin' it, I would. Only last night, at that,  but now look at him. A girl that never seen a man before could tell that  he wasn't any more dangerous now than if he was made of putty; but if  the fool keeps packin' them guns he's sure to get into trouble.\"    He raised his glass.    \"So here's to the man that Sandy was and ain't no more.\"    They drank solemnly.    \"Maybe you took the fall out of him yourself, Flanders?\"    \"Nope. I ain't no fighter, Steve. You know that. The feller that downed  Sandy was--a tenderfoot. Yep, a greenhorn.\"    \"Ah-h-h,\" drawled Nash softly, \"I thought so.\"    \"You did?\"    \"Anyway, let's hear the story. Another drink--on me, Flanders.\"    \"It was like this. Along about evening of yesterday Sandy was in here  with a couple of other boys. He was pretty well lighted--the glow was  circulatin' promiscuous, in fact--when in comes a feller about your  height, Steve, but lighter. Goodlookin', thin face, big dark eyes like a  girl. He carried the signs of a long ride on him. Well, sir, he walks up  to the bar and says: 'Can you make me a very sour lemonade, Mr.  Bartender?'    \"I grabbed the edge of the bar and hung tight.    \"'A which?' says I.    \"'Lemonade, if you please.'    \"I rolled an eye at Sandy, who was standin' there with his jaw falling,  and then I got busy with lemons and the squeezer, but pretty soon  Ferguson walks up to the stranger.    \"'Are you English?' he asks.    \"I knew by his tone what was comin', so I slid the gun I keep behind the  bar closer and got prepared for a lot of damaged crockery.    \"'I?' says the tenderfoot. 'Why, no. What makes you ask?'    \"'Your damned funny way of talkin',' says Sandy.    \"'Oh,' says the greenhorn, nodding as if he was thinkin' this over and  discovering a little truth in it. 'I suppose the way I talk is a little  unusual.'    \"'A little rotten,' says Sandy. 'Did I hear you askin' for a lemonade?'    \"'You did.'    \"'Would I seem to be askin' too many questions,' says Sandy, terrible  polite, 'if I inquires if bar whisky ain't good enough for you?'    \"The tenderfoot, he stands there jest as easy as you an' me stand here  now, and he laughed.    \"He says: 'The bar whisky I've tasted around this country is not very  good for any one, unless, perhaps, after a snake has bitten you. Then it  works on the principle of poison fight poison, eh?'    \"Sandy says after a minute: 'I'm the most quietest, gentle, innercent  cowpuncher that ever rode the range, but I'd tell a man that it riles me  to hear good bar whisky insulted like this. Look at me! Do I look as if  whisky ain't good for a man?'    \"'Why,' says the tenderfoot, 'you look sort of funny to me.'    \"He said it as easy as if he was passin' the morning with Ferguson, but  I seen that it was the last straw with Sandy. He hefted out both guns  and trained 'em on the greenhorn.    \"I yelled: 'Sandy, for God's sake, don't be killin' a tenderfoot!'    \"'If whisky will kill him he's goin' to die,' says Sandy. 'Flanders,  pour out a drink of rye for this gent.'    \"I did it, though my hand was shaking a lot, and the chap takes the  glass and raises it polite, and looks at the colour of it. I thought he  was goin' to drink, and starts wipin' the sweat off'n my forehead.    \"But this chap, he sets down the glass and smiles over to Sandy.    \"'Listen,' he says, still grinnin', 'in the old days I suppose this  would have been a pretty bluff, but it won't work with me now. You want  me to drink this glass of very bad whisky, but I'm sure that you don't  want it badly enough to shoot me.    \"'There are many reasons. In the old days a man shot down another and  then rode off on his horse and was forgotten, but in these days the  telegraph is faster than any horse that was ever foaled. They'd be sure  to get you, sir, though you might dodge them for a while. And I believe  that for a crime such as you threaten, they have recently installed a  little electric chair which is a perfectly good inducer of sleep--in  fact, it is better than a cradle. Taking these things all into  consideration, I take it for granted that you are bluffing, my friend,  and one of my favourite occupations is calling a bluff. You look  dangerous, but I've an idea that you are as yellow as your moustache.'    \"Sandy, he sort of swelled up all over like a poisoned dog.    \"He says: 'I begin to see your style. You want a clean man-handlin',  which suits me uncommon well.'    \"With that, he lays down his guns, soft and careful, and puts up his  fists, and goes for the other gent.    \"He makes his pass, which should have sent the other gent into kingdom  come. But it didn't. No, sir, the tenderfoot, he seemed to evaporate. He  wasn't there when the fist of Ferguson come along. Ferguson, he checked  up short and wheeled around and charged again like a bull. And he missed  again. And so they kept on playin' a sort of a game of tag over the  place, the stranger jest side-steppin' like a prize-fighter, the  prettiest you ever seen, and not developin' when Sandy started on one of  his swings.    \"At last one of Sandy's fists grazed him on the shoulder and sort of  peeved him, it looked like. He ducks under Sandy's next punch, steps in,  and wallops Sandy over the eye--that punch didn't travel more'n six  inches. But it slammed Sandy down in a corner like he's been shot.    \"He was too surprised to be much hurt, though, and drags himself up to  his feet, makin' a pass at his pocket at the same time. Then he came  again, silent and thinkin' of blood, I s'pose, with a knife in his hand.    \"This time the tenderfoot didn't wait. He went in with a sort of hitch  step, like a dancer. Ferguson's knife carved the air beside the  tenderfoot's head, and then the skinny boy jerked up his right and his  left--one, two--into Sandy's mouth. Down he goes again--slumps"]]]
