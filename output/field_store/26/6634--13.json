Wetzel always left death behind him, and he was gone  before his demoniac yell ceased to echo throughout the woods.  Although often pursued, he invariably eluded the Indians, for he was  the fleetest runner on the border.    For many years he was considered the right hand of the defense of  the fort. The Indians held him in superstitious dread, and the fact  that he was known to be in the settlement had averted more than one  attack by the Indians.    Many regarded Wetzel as a savage, a man who was mad for the blood of  the red men, and without one redeeming quality. But this was an  unjust opinion. When that restless fever for revenge left him--it  was not always with him--he was quiet and peaceable. To those few  who knew him well he was even amiable. But Wetzel, although known to  everyone, cared for few. He spent little time in the settlements and  rarely spoke except when addressed.    Nature had singularly fitted him for his pre-eminent position among  scouts and hunters. He was tall and broad across the shoulders; his  strength, agility and endurance were marvelous; he had an eagle eye,  the sagacity of the bloodhound, and that intuitive knowledge which  plays such an important part in a hunter's life. He knew not fear.  He was daring where daring was the wiser part. Crafty, tireless and  implacable, Wetzel was incomparable in his vocation.    His long raven-black hair, of which he was vain, when combed out  reached to within a foot of the ground. He had a rare scalp, one for  which the Indians would have bartered anything.    A favorite Indian decoy, and the most fatal one, was the imitation  of the call of the wild turkey. It had often happened that men from  the settlements who had gone out for a turkey which had been  gobbling, had not returned.    For several mornings Wetzel had heard a turkey call, and becoming  suspicious of it, had determined to satisfy himself. On the east  side of the creek hill there was a cavern some fifty or sixty yards  above the water. The entrance to this cavern was concealed by vines  and foliage. Wetzel knew of it, and, crossing the stream some  distance above, he made a wide circuit and came up back of the cave.  Here he concealed himself in a clump of bushes and waited. He had  not been there long when directly below him sounded the cry,  \"Chug-a-lug, Chug-a-lug, Chug-a-lug.\" At the same time the polished  head and brawny shoulders of an Indian warrior rose out of the  cavern. Peering cautiously around, the savage again gave the  peculiar cry, and then sank back out of sight. Wetzel screened  himself safely in his position and watched the savage repeat the  action at least ten times before he made up his mind that the Indian  was alone in the cave. When he had satisfied himself of this he took  a quick aim at the twisted tuft of hair and fired. Without waiting  to see the result of his shot--so well did he trust his unerring  aim--he climbed down the steep bank and brushing aside the vines  entered the cave. A stalwart Indian lay in the entrance with his  face pressed down on the vines. He still clutched in his sinewy  fingers the buckhorn mouthpiece with which he had made the calls  that had resulted in his death.    \"Huron,\" muttered the hunter to himself as he ran the keen edge of  his knife around the twisted tuft of hair and tore off the  scalp-lock.    The cave showed evidence of having been inhabited for some time.  There was a cunningly contrived fireplace made of stones, against  which pieces of birch bark were placed in such a position that not a  ray of light could get out of the cavern. The bed of black coals  between the stones still smoked; a quantity of parched corn lay on a  little rocky shelf which jutted out from the wall; a piece of jerked  meat and a buckskin pouch hung from a peg.    Suddenly Wetzel dropped on his knees and began examining the  footprints in the sandy floor of the cavern. He measured the length  and width of the dead warrior's foot. He closely scrutinized every  moccasin print. He crawled to the opening of the cavern and  carefully surveyed the moss.    Then he rose to his feet. A remarkable transformation had come over  him during the last few moments. His face had changed; the calm  expression was replaced by one sullen and fierce: his lips were set  in a thin, cruel line, and a strange light glittered in his eyes.    He slowly pursued a course lending gradually down to the creek. At  intervals he would stop and listen. The strange voices of the woods  were not mysteries to him. They were more familiar to him than the  voices of men.    He recalled that, while on his circuit over the ridge to get behind  the cavern, he had heard the report of a rifle far off in the  direction of the chestnut grove, but, as that was a favorite place  of the settlers for shooting squirrels, he had not thought anything  of it at the time. Now it had a peculiar significance. He turned  abruptly from the trail he had been following and plunged down the  steep hill. Crossing the creek he took to the cover of the willows,  which grew profusely along the banks, and striking a sort of bridle  path he started on a run. He ran easily, as though accustomed to  that mode of travel, and his long strides covered a couple of miles  in short order. Coming to the rugged bluff, which marked the end of  the ridge, he stopped and walked slowly along the edge of the water.  He struck the trail of the Indians where it crossed the creek, just  where he expected. There were several moccasin tracks in the wet  sand and, in some of the depressions made by the heels the rounded  edges of the imprints were still smooth and intact. The little pools  of muddy water, which still lay in these hollows, were other  indications to his keen eyes that the Indians had passed this point  early that morning.    The trail led up the hill and far into the woods. Never in doubt the  hunter kept on his course; like a shadow he passed from tree to tree  and from bush to bush; silently, cautiously, but rapidly he followed  the tracks of the Indians. When he had penetrated the dark backwoods  of the Black Forest tangled underbrush, windfalls and gullies  crossed his path and rendered fast trailing impossible. Before these  almost impassible barriers he stopped and peered on all sides,  studying the lay of the land, the deadfalls, the gorges, and all the  time keeping in mind the probable route of the redskins. Then he  turned aside to avoid the roughest travelling. Sometimes these  detours were only a few hundred feet long; often they were miles;  but nearly always he struck the trail again. This almost superhuman  knowledge of the Indian's ways of traversing the forest, which  probably no man could have possessed without giving his life to the  hunting of Indians, was the one feature of Wetzel's woodcraft which  placed him so far above other hunters, and made him so dreaded by  the savages.    Descending a knoll he entered a glade where the trees grew farther  apart and the underbrush was only knee high. The black soil showed  that the tract of land had been burned over. On the banks of a  babbling brook which wound its way through this open space, the  hunter found tracks which brought an exclamation from him. Clearly  defined in the soft earth was the impress of a white man's moccasin.  The footprints of an Indian toe inward. Those of a white man are  just the opposite. A little farther on Wetzel came to a slight  crushing of the moss, where he concluded some heavy body had fallen.  As he had seen the tracks of a buck and doe all the way down the  brook he thought it probable one of them had been shot by the white  hunter. He found a pool of blood surrounded by moccasin prints; and  from that spot the trail led straight toward the west, showing that  for some reason the Indians had changed their direction.    This new move puzzled the hunter, and he leaned against the trunk of  a tree, while he revolved in his mind the reasons for this abrupt  departure--for such he believed it. The trail he had followed for  miles was the devious trail of hunting Indians, stealing slowly and  stealthily along watching for their prey, whether it be man or  beast. The trail toward the west was straight as the crow flies; the  moccasin prints that indented the soil were wide apart, and to an  inexperienced eye looked like the track of one Indian. To Wetzel  this indicated that the Indians had all stepped in the tracks of a  leader.    As was usually his way, Wetzel decided quickly. He had calculated  that there were eight Indians in all, not counting the chief whom he  had shot. This party of Indians had either killed or captured the  white man who had been hunting. Wetzel believed that a part of the  Indians would push on with all possible speed, leaving some of their  number to ambush the trail or double back on it to see if they were  pursued.    An hour of patient waiting, in which he never moved from his  position, proved the wisdom of his judgment. Suddenly, away at the  other end of the grove, he caught a flash of brown, of a living,  moving something, like the flitting of a bird behind a tree. Was it  a bird or a squirrel? Then again he saw it, almost lost in the shade  of the forest. Several minutes passed, in which Wetzel never moved  and hardly breathed. The shadow had disappeared behind a tree. He  fixed his keen eyes on that tree and presently a dark object glided  from it and darted stealthily forward to another tree. One, two,  three dark forms followed the first one. They were Indian warriors,  and they moved so quickly that only the eyes of a woodsman like  Wetzel could have discerned their movements at that distance.    Probably most hunters would have taken to their heels while there  was yet time. The thought did not occur to Wetzel. He slowly raised  the hammer of his rifle. As the Indians came into plain view he saw  they did not suspect his presence, but were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1262"],[0,"The Heritage of the Desert: A Novel (#14)"],[1,"with a muffled roar of rage. Up he  sprang, dangling a useless leg, yet leaping swiftly forward. One blow  sent the attacking dog aside. Jack fired again. The bear became a  wrestling, fiery demon, death-stricken, but full of savage fury. Jack  aimed low and shot again.    Slowly now the grizzly reared, his frosted coat blood-flecked, his great  head swaying. Another shot. There was one wide sweep of the huge paw,  and then the bear sank forward, drooping slowly, and stretched all his  length as if to rest.    Mescal, recalled to life, staggered backward. Between her and the  outstretched paw was the distance of one short stride.    Jack, bounding up, made sure the bear was dead before he looked at  Mescal. She was faint. Wolf whined about her. Piute came running from  the cedars. Her eyes were still fixed in a look of fear.    \"I couldn't run--I couldn't move,\" she said, shuddering. A blush drove  the white from her cheeks as she raised her face to Jack. \"He'd soon  have reached me.\"    Piute added his encomium: \"Damn--heap big bear-- Jack kill um--big  chief!\"    Hare laughed away his own fear and turned their attention to the  stampeded sheep. It was dark before they got the flock together again,  and they never knew whether they had found them all. Supper-time was  unusually quiet that night. Piute was jovial, but no one appeared  willing to talk save the peon, and he could only grimace. The reaction  of feeling following Mescal's escape had robbed Jack of strength of  voice; he could scarcely whisper. Mescal spoke no word; her black lashes  hid her eyes; she was silent, but there was that in her silence which  was eloquent. Wolf, always indifferent save to Mescal, reacted to the  subtle change, and as if to make amends laid his head on Jack's knees.  The quiet hour round the camp-fire passed, and sleep claimed them.  Another day dawned, awakening them fresh, faithful to their duties,  regardless of what had gone before.    So the days slipped by. June came, with more leisure for the shepherds,  better grazing for the sheep, heavier dews, lighter frosts, snow-squalls  half rain, and bursting blossoms on the prickly thorns, wild-primrose  patches in every shady spot, and bluebells lifting wan azure faces to  the sun.    The last snow-storm of June threatened all one morning; hung menacing  over the yellow crags, in dull lead clouds waiting for the wind. Then  like ships heaving anchor to a single command they sailed down off the  heights; and the cedar forest became the centre of a blinding, eddying  storm. The flakes were as large as feathers, moist, almost warm. The low  cedars changed to mounds of white; the sheep became drooping curves of  snow; the little lambs were lost in the color of their own pure fleece.  Though the storm had been long in coming it was brief in passing. Wind-  driven toward the desert, it moaned its last in the cedars, and swept  away, a sheeted pall. Out over the Canyon it floated, trailing long  veils of white that thinned out, darkened, and failed far above the  golden desert. The winding columns of snow merged into straight lines of  leaden rain; the rain flowed into vapory mist, and the mist cleared in  the gold-red glare of endless level and slope. No moisture reached the  parched desert.    Jack marched into camp with a snowy burden over his shoulder. He flung  it down, disclosing a small deer; then he shook the white mantle from  his coat, and whistling, kicked the fire-logs, and looked abroad at the  silver cedars, now dripping under the sun, at the rainbows in the  settling mists, at the rapidly melting snow on the ground.    \"Got lost in that squall. Fine! Fine!\" he exclaimed, and threw wide his  arms.    \"Jack!\" said Mescal. \"Jack!\" Memory had revived some forgotten thing.  The dark olive of her skin crimsoned; her eyes dilated and shadowed with  a rare change of emotion.    \"Jack,\" she repeated.    \"Well?\" he replied, in surprise.    \"To look at you!--I never dreamed--I'd forgotten--\"    \"What's the matter with me?\" demanded Jack.    Wonderingly, her mind on the past, she replied: \"You were dying when we  found you at White Sage.\"    He drew himself up with a sharp catch in his breath, and stared at her  as if he saw a ghost.    \"Oh--Jack! You're going to get well!\"    Her lips curved in a smile.    For an instant Jack Hare spent his soul in searching her face for truth.  While waiting for death he had utterly forgotten it; he remembered now,  when life gleamed in the girl's dark eyes. Passionate joy flooded his  heart.    \"Mescal--Mescal!\" he cried, brokenly. The eyes were true that shed this  sudden light on him; glad and sweet were the lips that bade him hope and  live again. Blindly, instinctively he kissed them--a kiss unutterably  grateful; then he fled into the forest, running without aim.    That flight ended in sheer exhaustion on the far rim of the plateau. The  spreading cedars seemed to have eyes; and he shunned eyes in this hour.  \"God! to think I cared so much,\" he whispered. \"What has happened?\" With  time relief came to limbs, to labored breast and lungs, but not to mind.  In doubt that would not die, he looked at himself. The leanness of arms,  the flat chest, the hollows were gone. He did not recognize his own  body. He breathed to the depths of his lungs. No pain--only  exhilaration! He pounded his chest--no pain! He dug his trembling  fingers into the firm flesh over the apex of his right lung--the place  of his torture--no pain!    \"I wanted to live!\" he cried. He buried his face in the fragrant  juniper; he rolled on the soft brown mat of earth and hugged it close;  he cooled his hot cheeks in the primrose clusters. He opened his eyes to  new bright green of cedar, to sky of a richer blue, to a desert,  strange, beckoning, enthralling as life itself. He counted backward a  month, two months, and marvelled at the swiftness of time. He counted  time forward, he looked into the future, and all was beautiful--long  days, long hunts, long rides, service to his friend, freedom on the wild  steppes, blue-white dawns upon the eastern crags, red-gold sunsets over  the lilac mountains of the desert. He saw himself in triumphant health  and strength, earning day by day the spirit of this wilderness, coming  to fight for it, to live for it, and in far-off time, when he had won  his victory, to die for it.    Suddenly his mind was illumined. The lofty plateau with its healing  breath of sage and juniper had given back strength to him; the silence  and solitude and strife of his surroundings had called to something deep  within him; but it was Mescal who made this wild life sweet and  significant. It was Mescal, the embodiment of the desert spirit. Like a  man facing a great light Hare divined his love. Through all the days on  the plateau, living with her the natural free life of Indians, close to  the earth, his unconscious love had ripened. He understood now her charm  for him; he knew now the lure of her wonderful eyes, flashing fire,  desert-trained, like the falcon eyes of her Indian grandfather. The  knowledge of what she had become to him dawned with a mounting desire  that thrilled all his blood.    Twilight had enfolded the plateau when Hare traced his way back to camp.  Mescal was not there. His supper awaited him; Piute hummed a song; the  peon sat grimacing at the fire. Hare told them to eat, and moved away  toward the rim.    Mescal was at her favorite seat, with the white dog beside her; and she  watched the desert where the last glow of sunset gilded the mesas. How  cold and calm was her face! How strange to him in this new character!    \"Mescal, I didn't know I loved you--then--but I know it now.\"    Her face dropped quickly from its level poise, hiding the brooding eyes;  her hand trembled on Wolf's head.    \"You spoke the truth. I'll get well. I'd rather have had it from your  lips than from any in the world. I mean to live my life here where these  wonderful things have come to me. The friendship of the good man who  saved me, this wild, free desert, the glory of new hope, strength, life-  -and love.\"    He took her hand in his and whispered, \"For I love you. Do you care for  me? Mescal! It must be complete. Do you care--a little?\"    The wind blew her dusky hair; he could not see her face; he tried gently  to turn her to him. The hand he had taken lay warm and trembling in his,  but it was not withdrawn. As he waited, in fear, in hope, it became  still. Her slender form, rigid within his arm, gradually relaxed, and  yielded to him; her face sank on his breast, and her dark hair loosened  from its band, covered her, and blew across his lips. That was his  answer.    The wind sang in the cedars. No longer a sigh, sad as thoughts of a past  forever flown, but a song of what had come to him, of hope, of life, of  Mescal's love, of the things to be!              VII. SILVERMANE    LITTLE dew fell on the night of July first; the dawn brightened without  mists; a hot sun rose; the short summer of the plateau had begun.    As Hare rose, refreshed and happy from his breakfast, his whistle was  cut short by the Indian.    \"Ugh!\" exclaimed Piute, lifting a dark finger. Black Bolly had thrown  her nose-bag and slipped her halter, and she moved toward the opening in  the cedars, her head high, her black ears straight up.    \"Bolly!\" called Mescal. The mare did not stop.    \"What the deuce?\" Hare ran forward to catch her.    \"I never knew Bolly to act that way,\" said Mescal. \"See--she didn't eat  half the oats. Well, Bolly--Jack! look at Wolf!\"    The white dog had risen and stood warily shifting his nose. He sniffed  the wind, turned round and round, and slowly stiffened with his head  pointed toward the eastern rise of the plateau.    \"Hold, Wolf, hold!\" called Mescal, as the dog appeared to be about to  dash away.    \"Ugh!\" grunted Piute.    \"Listen, Jack; did you hear?\" whispered the girl.    \"Hear what?\"    \"Listen.\"    The warm breeze came"]]]
