The fact that emotion is more injurious to the body than is  muscular action is well known, the difference being probably caused  by the fact that when there is action the above-mentioned products  of stimulation are consumed, while in stimulation without action  they are not consumed and must be eliminated as waste products.  Now these activating substances and the fuel glycogen may be consumed  by any muscular action as well as by the particular muscular action  for which the integration and consequent stimulation were made;  that is, if one were provoked to such anger that he felt impelled  to attack the object of his anger, one of three things might happen:  First, he might perform no physical act but give expression to  the emotion of anger; second, he might engage in a physical struggle  and completely satisfy his anger; third, he might immediately engage  in violent gymnastic exercises and thus consume all the motor-producing  elements mobilized by the anger and thus clarify his body.    In these premises we find our explanation of the origin and purpose  of laughter and crying, for since they consist almost wholly  of muscular exertion, they serve precisely such clarifying purposes  as would be served by the gymnastic exercises of an angry man.  As it seems to me, the muscular action of laughter clears the system  of the energizing substances which have been mobilized in various  parts of the body for the performance of other actions (Figs. 27  to 29). If this be true, the first question that presents itself is,  Why is the respiratory system utilized for such a clarifying purpose?  Why do we not laugh with our feet and hands as well?  Were laughter expressed with the hands, the monkey might fall  from the tree and, if by the feet, man might fall to the ground.  He would at least be ataxic.  In fact, laughter has the great  advantage of utilizing a group of powerful muscles which can be  readily spared without seriously interfering with the maintenance  of posture.  Laughter, however, is only one form of muscular action  which may consume the fuel thrown into the blood by excitation.  That these products of excitation are often consumed by other motor  acts than laughter is frequently seen in public meetings when  the stamping of feet and the clapping of hands in applause gives  relief to the excitation (Fig. 30). Why the noise of laughter?  In order that the products of excitation may be quickly and  completely consumed, the powerful group of expiratory muscles must  have some resistance against which they can exert themselves strongly  and at the same time provide for adequate respiratory exchange.  The intermittent closure of the epiglottis serves this purpose admirably,  just as the horizontal bars afford the resistance against which muscles  may be exercised.  The facial muscles are not in use for other purposes,  hence their contractions will consume a little of the fuel.  An audience excited by the words of an impassioned speaker undergoes  a body-wide stimulation for action, all of which may be eliminated  by laughter or by applause (Fig. 31).    Let us test this hypothesis by some practical examples.  The first is an incident that accidentally occurred in our laboratory  during experiments on fear which were performed as follows:  A keen, snappy fox terrier was completely muzzled by winding a broad strip  of adhesive plaster around his jaw so as to include all but the nostrils.  When this aggressive little terrier and the rabbit found themselves  in close quarters each animal became completely governed by instinct;  the rabbit crouched in fear, while the terrier, with all the ancestral  assurance of seizing his prey, rushed, upon the rabbit, his muzzle  always glancing off and his attack ending in awkward failure.    This experiment was repeated many times and each time provoked  the serious-minded scientific visitors who witnessed it  to laughter.  Why?  Because the spectacle of a savage little terrier  rushing upon an innocent rabbit as if to mangle it integrated  the body of the onlooker with a strong desire to exert muscular  action to prevent the cruelty.  This integration caused a conversion  of the potential energy in the brain-cells into kinetic energy,  and there resulted a discharge into the blood-stream of activating  internal secretions for the purpose of producing muscular action.  Instantly and unexpectedly the danger passed and the preparation  for muscular action intended for use in the protection of the rabbit  was not needed.  This fuel was consumed by the neutral muscular  action of laughter, which thus afforded relief.    A common example of the same nature is that encountered on the street  when a pedestrian slips on a banana peel and, just as he is  about to tumble, recovers his equilibrium.  The onlookers secure  relief from the integration to run to his rescue by laughing.  On the other hand, should the same pedestrian fall and fracture  his skull the motor integration of the onlookers would be consumed  by rendering physical assistance--hence there would be no laughter.  In children almost any unexpected phenomenon, such as a sudden \"booing\"  from behind a door, is attended by laughter, and in like manner  the kinetic reaction produced by the innumerable threats of danger  which are suddenly averted, a breach of the conventions, a sudden  relief from acute nervous tension; a surprise--indeed, any excitant  to which there is no predetermined method of giving a physical response--  may be neutralized by the excitation of the mechanism of laughter.    In the same way the laughter excited by jokes may be explained.  An analysis of a joke shows that it is composed of two parts--  the first, in which is presented a subject that acts as a stimulus  to action, and the second, in which the story turns suddenly  so that the stimulus to action is unexpectedly withdrawn.  The subject matter of the joke affects each hearer according  to the type of stimuli that commonly excites that individual.  Hence it is that a joke may convulse one person while it bores another,  and so there are jokes of the classes, bankers' jokes, politicians' jokes,  the jokes of professional men, of the plebeian, of the artist, etc.  If the joke fails, the integration products of the excitation may  be used in physical resentment (Fig. 32).    Another type of laughter is that associated with the ticklish points  of certain parts of the body, the soles of the feet and certain  parts of the trunk and of the abdomen.  The excitation of the  ticklish receptors, like pain, compels self-defensive motor acts.  This response is of phylogenetic origin, and may be awakened only  by stimuli which are too light to be painful.  In this connection  it is of interest to note that a superficial, insect-like contact  with the skin rarely provokes laughter, and that the tickling  of the nasal, oral, and pulmonary tracts does not produce laughter.  The ticklish points that cause laughter are rather deeply placed,  and a certain type of physical contact is required to constitute  an adequate stimulus.  That is, the contact must arouse a phylogenetic  association with a physical struggle or with physical exertion.  In the foot, the adequate stimuli for laughter are such contacts  as resemble or suggest piercing by stones or rough objects.. The  intention of the one who tickles must be known; if his intention  be playful, laughter results, whereas if injury be intended,  then an effort toward escape or defense is excited, but no laughter.  If deep tickling of the ribs is known to be malicious, it will excite  physical resentment and not laughter.  Self-tickling rarely causes  laughter for the reason that auto-tickling can cause only a known  degree of stimulation, so that there results no excessive integration  which requires relief by the neutral muscular activity of laughter.  In fact, one never sees purposeful acts and laughter associated.  According to its severity, an isolated stimulus causes either  an action or laughter.  The ticklish points in our bodies were  probably developed as a means of defense against serious attacks  and of escape from injurious contacts.    Anger, fear, and grief are also strong excitants and, therefore,  are stimuli to motor activity.  It is obvious that whatever the excitant  the physico-chemical action of the brain and the ductless glands  cannot be reversed--the effect of the stimulus cannot be recalled,  therefore either a purposeful muscular act or a neutralizing act  must be performed or else the liberated energy must smoulder  in the various parts of the body.    It is on this hypothesis that the origin and the purpose of laughter  and crying may be understood.  Even a superficial analysis of the  phenomena of both laughter and crying show them to be without any  external motor purpose; the respiratory mechanism is intermittently  stimulated and inhibited; and the shoulder and arm muscles, indeed,  many muscles of the trunk and the extremities are, as far as any  external design is concerned, purposelessly contracted and released  until the kinetic energy mobilized by excitation is utilized.  During this time the facial expression gives the index to  the mental state.    Crying, like laughter, is always preceded by a stimulation  to some motor action which may or may not be performed  (Figs. 33 and 34). If a mother is anxiously watching the course  of a serious illness of her child and if, in caring for it, she is  stimulated to the utmost to perform motor acts, she will continue  in a state of motor tenseness until the child recovers or dies.  If relief is sudden, as in the crisis of pneumonia, and the mother  is not exhausted, she will easily laugh if tired, she may cry.  If death occurs, the stimulus to motor acts is suddenly  withdrawn and she then cries aloud, and performs many motor  acts as a result of the intense stimulation to motor activity  which is no longer"]]]
