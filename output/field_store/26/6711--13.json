A modern novelist has boasted that her books are read 'from Tobolsk to  Tangiers.'  This is a wide circulation, but the widest circulation in the  world has probably been achieved by a story whose author, unlike Ouida,  will never be known to fame.  The tale which we are about to examine is,  perhaps, of all myths the most widely diffused, yet there is no ready way  of accounting for its extraordinary popularity.  Any true 'nature-myth,'  any myth which accounts for the processes of nature or the aspects of  natural phenomena, may conceivably have been invented separately,  wherever men in an early state of thought observed the same facts, and  attempted to explain them by telling a story.  Thus we have seen that the  earlier part of the Myth of Cronus is a nature-myth, setting forth the  cause of the separation of Heaven and Earth.  Star-myths again, are  everywhere similar, because men who believed all nature to be animated  and personal, accounted for the grouping of constellations in accordance  with these crude beliefs. {87}  Once more, if a story like that of 'Cupid  and Psyche' be found among the most diverse races, the distribution  becomes intelligible if the myth was invented to illustrate or enforce a  widely prevalent custom.  But in the following story no such explanation  is even provisionally acceptable.    The gist of the tale (which has many different 'openings,' and  conclusions in different places) may be stated thus: A young man is  brought to the home of a hostile animal, a giant, cannibal, wizard, or a  malevolent king.  He is put by his unfriendly host to various severe  trials, in which it is hoped that he will perish.  In each trial he is  assisted by the daughter of his host.  After achieving the adventures, he  elopes with the girl, and is pursued by her father.  The runaway pair  throw various common objects behind them, which are changed into magical  obstacles and check the pursuit of the father.  The myth has various  endings, usually happy, in various places.  Another form of the narrative  is known, in which the visitors to the home of the hostile being are, not  wooers of his daughter, but brothers of his wife. {88}  The incidents of  the flight, in this variant, are still of the same character.  Finally,  when the flight is that of a brother from his sister's malevolent ghost,  in Hades (Japan), or of two sisters from a cannibal mother or step-mother  (Zulu and Samoyed), the events of the flight and the magical aids to  escape remain little altered.  We shall afterwards see that attempts have  been made to interpret one of these narratives as a nature-myth; but the  attempts seem unsuccessful.  We are therefore at a loss to account for  the wide diffusion of this tale, unless it has been transmitted slowly  from people to people, in the immense unknown prehistoric past of the  human race.    * * * * *    Before comparing the various forms of the myth in its first shape--that  which tells of the mortal lover and the giant's or wizard's daughter--let  us give the Scottish version of the story.  This version was written down  for me, many years ago, by an aged lady in Morayshire.  I published it in  the 'Revue Celtique'; but it is probably new to story-comparers, in its  broad Scotch variant.        NICHT NOUGHT NOTHING.         There once lived a king and a queen.  They were long married and had     no bairns; but at last the queen had a bairn, when the king was away     in far countries.  The queen would not christen the bairn till the     king came back, and she said, 'We will just call him Nicht Nought     Nothing until his father comes home.'  But it was long before he came     home, and the boy had grown a nice little laddie.  At length the king     was on his way back; but he had a big river to cross, and there was a     spate, and he could not get over the water.  But a giant came up to     him, and said, 'If you will give me Nicht Nought Nothing, I will carry     you over the water on my back.'  The king had never heard that his son     was called Nicht Nought Nothing, and so he promised him.  When the     king got home again, he was very happy to see his wife again, and his     young son.  She told him that she had not given the child any name but     Nicht Nought Nothing, until he should come home again himself.  The     poor king was in a terrible case.  He said, 'What have I done?  I     promised to give the giant who carried me over the river on his back,     Nicht Nought Nothing.'  The king and the queen were sad and sorry, but     they said, 'When the giant comes we will give him the hen-wife's     bairn; he will never know the difference.'  The next day the giant     came to claim the king's promise, and he sent for the hen-wife's     bairn; and the giant went away with the bairn on his back.  He     travelled till he came to a big stone, and there he sat down to rest.     He said,       'Hidge, Hodge, on my back, what time of day is it?'  The poor little     bairn said, 'It is the time that my mother, the hen-wife, takes up the     eggs for the queen's breakfast.'       The giant was very angry, and dashed the bairn on the stone and killed     it.       . . . . .       The same adventure is repeated with the gardener's son.       . . . . .       Then the giant went back to the king's house, and said he would     destroy them all if they did not give him Nicht Nought Nothing this     time.  They had to do it; and when he came to the big stone, the giant     said, 'What time of day is it?'  Nicht Nought Nothing said, 'It is the     time that my father the king will be sitting down to supper.'  The     giant said, 'I've got the richt ane noo;' and took Nicht Nought     Nothing to his own house and brought him up till he was a man.       The giant had a bonny dochter, and she and the lad grew very fond of     each other.  The giant said one day to Nicht Nought Nothing, 'I've     work for you to-morrow.  There is a stable seven miles long and seven     miles broad, and it has not been cleaned for seven years, and you must     clean it to-morrow, or I will have you for my supper.'       The giant's dochter went out next morning with the lad's breakfast,     and found him in a terrible state, for aye as he cleaned out a bit, it     aye fell in again.  The giant's dochter said she would help him, and     she cried a' the beasts of the field, and a' the fowls o' the air, and     in a minute they a' came, and carried awa' everything that was in the     stable and made a' clean before the giant came home.  He said, 'Shame     for the wit that helped you; but I have a worse job for you     to-morrow.'  Then he told Nicht Nought Nothing that there was a loch     seven miles long, and seven miles deep, and seven miles broad, and he     must drain it the next day, or else he would have him for his supper.     Nicht Nought Nothing began early next morning and tried to lave the     water with his pail, but the loch was never getting any less, and he     did no ken what to do; but the giant's dochter called on all the fish     in the sea to come and drink the water, and very soon they drank it     dry.  When the giant saw the work done he was in a rage, and said,     'I've a worse job for you to-morrow; there is a tree seven miles high,     and no branch on it, till you get to the top, and there is a nest, and     you must bring down the eggs without breaking one, or else I will have     you for my supper.'  At first the giant's dochter did not know how to     help Nicht Nought Nothing; but she cut off first her fingers and then     her toes, and made steps of them, and he clomb the tree, and got all     the eggs safe till he came to the bottom, and then one was broken.  The     giant's dochter advised him to run away, and she would follow him.  So     he travelled till he came to a king's palace, and the king and queen     took him in and were very kind to him.  The giant's dochter left her     father's house, and he pursued her and was drowned.  Then she came to     the king's palace where Nicht Nought Nothing was.  And she went up     into a tree to watch for him.  The gardener's dochter, going to draw     water in the well, saw the shadow of the lady in the water, and     thought it was herself, and said, 'If I'm so bonny, if I'm so brave,     do you send me to draw water?'  The gardener's wife went out, and she     said the same thing.  Then the gardener went himself, and brought the     lady from the tree, and led her in.  And he told her that a stranger     was to marry the king's dochter, and showed her the man: and it was     Nicht Nought Nothing asleep in a chair.  And she saw him, and cried to     him, 'Waken, waken, and speak to me!'  But he would not waken, and     syne she cried,       'I cleaned the stable, I laved the loch, and I clamb the tree,           And all for the love of thee,           And thou wilt not waken and speak to me.'       The king and the queen heard this, and came to the bonny young lady,     and she said,       'I canna get Nicht Nought Nothing to speak to me for all that I can     do.'       Then were they greatly astonished when she spoke of Nicht Nought     Nothing, and asked where he was, and she said, 'He that sits there in     the chair.'  Then they ran to him and kissed him and called him their     own dear son, and he wakened, and told them all that the giant's     dochter had done for him, and of all her kindness.  Then they took her     in their arms and kissed her, and said she should now be their     dochter, for their son should marry her.       And they lived happy all their days.    In this variant of the story, which we may use as our text, it is to be  noticed that a lacuna exists.  The narrative of the flight omits to  mention that the runaways threw things behind them which became obstacles  in the giant's way.  One of these"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14091"],[0,"Barkham Burroughs' Encyclopaedia of Astounding Facts and Useful Information, (#14)"],[1,"is, real ladies--now wear flat-soled shoes and  boots, _a la_ Cinderella. For morning walking, boots or high Moliere  shoes are worn.    If you wear boots you may wear any stockings you like, for no one  sees them. But if you wear shoes you must adapt your stockings to your  dress. Floss silk, Scotch thread, and even cotton stockings are worn  for walking, silk stockings have returned into exclusively evening  wear. Day stockings should be of the same color as the dress, but  they may be shaded, or stripped, or dotted, just as you please. White  stockings are absolutely forbidden for day wear--no one wears them--no  one dares wear them under fashion's interdiction.      HOW TO APPEAR GRACEFUL IN WALKING.    The whole secret of standing and walking erect consists in keeping  the chin well away from the breast. This throws the head upward and  backward, and the shoulders will naturally settle backward and  in their true position. Those who stoop in walking generally look  downward. The proper way is to look straight ahead, upon the same  level with your eyes, or if you are inclined to stoop, until that  tendency is overcome, look rather above than below the level.  Mountaineers are said to be as \"straight as an arrow,\" and the reason  is because they are obliged to look upward so much. It is simply  impossible to stoop in walking if you will heed and practice this  rule. You will notice that all round-shouldered persons carry the chin  near the breast and pointed downward. Take warning in time, and heed  grandmother's advice, for a bad habit is more easily prevented than  cured. The habit of stooping when one walks or stands is a bad habit  and especially hard to cure.             *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: MULTUM IN PARVO.]    MULTUM IN PARVO      HISTORY OF THE BIBLES OF THE WORLD.    The Bibles of the world are the koran of the Mohammedans, the  tripitaka of the Buddhists, the five kings of the Chinese, the three  vedas of the Hindoos, the zendavesta of the Parsees and the scriptures  of the Christians. The koran, says the Chicago Times, is the most  recent, dating from the seventh century after Christ. It is a compound  of quotations from both the Old and the New Testaments and from the  talmud. The tripitaka contain sublime morals and pure aspirations.  Their author lived and died in the sixth century before Christ.    The sacred writings of the Chinese are called the five kings, the word  \"king\" meaning web of cloth. From this it is presumed that they were  originally written on five rolls of cloth. They contain wise sayings  from the sages on the duties of life, but they can not be traced  further back than the eleventh century before our era. The vedas are  the most ancient books in the language of the Hindoos, but they do  not, according to late commentators, antedate the twelfth before the  Christian era. The zendaveata of the Parsees, next to our Bible, is  reckoned among scholars as being the greatest and most learned of  the sacred writings. Zoroaster, whose sayings it contains, lived and  worked in the twelfth century before Christ. Moses lived and wrote  the pentateuch 1,500 years before the birth of Jesus, therefore that  portion of our Bible is at least 300 years older than the most  ancient of other sacred writings. The eddas, a semi-sacred work of the  Scandinavians, was first given to the world in the fourteen century  A.D.      PRECIOUS STONES.

HOW TO MEASURE CORN IN THE CRIB.    Rule: 1st. Measure the length, breadth and height of the crib inside  the rail; multiply them together and divide by two, the result is the  number of bushels of shelled corn.    2d. Level the corn so that it is of equal depth throughout, multiply  the length, breath and depth together, and this product by four,  and cut off one figure to the right of the product; the other will  represent the number of bushels of shelled corn.    3d. Multiply length by height, and then by width, add two ciphers to  the result and divide by 124; this gives the number of bushels of ear  corn.      HOME DRESSMAKING.    The art of dressmaking in America has been of late years so simplified  that almost anyone with a reasonable degree of executive ability can  manufacture a fashionable costume by using an approved pattern and  following the directions printed upon it, selecting a new pattern for  each distinct style; while in Europe many ladies adhere to the old  plan of cutting one model and using it for everything, trusting to  personal skill or luck to gain the desired formation. However, some  useful hints are given which are well worth offering after the paper  pattern has been chosen.    The best dressmakers here and abroad use silk for lining, but nothing  is so durable or preserves the material as well as a firm slate twill.  This is sold double width and should be laid out thus folded: place  the pattern upon it with the upper part towards the cut end, the  selvedge for the fronts. The side pieces for the back will most  probably be got out of the width, while the top of the back will fit  in the intersect of the front. A yard of good stuff may be often saved  by laying the pattern out and well considering how one part cuts into  another. Prick the outline on to the lining; these marks serve as a  guide for the tacking.    In forming the front side plaits be careful and do not allow a fold  or crease to be apparent on the bodice beyond where the stitching  commences. To avoid this, before beginning stick a pin through what  is to be the top of the plait. The head will be on the right side, and  holding the point, one can begin pinning the seam without touching the  upper part of the bodice. To ascertain the size of the buttonholes put  a piece of card beneath the button to be used and cut it an eighth of  an inch on either side beyond. Having turned down the piece in front  on the buttonhole side run a thread a sixteenth of an inch from the  extreme edge, and again another the width of the card. Begin to cut  the first buttonhole at the bottom of the bodice; and continue at  equal distances. The other side of the bodice is left wide enough to  come well under the buttonholes. The buttonholes must be laid upon it  and a pin put through the center of each to mark where the button  is to be placed. In sewing on the buttons put the stiches in  horizontally; if perpendicularly they are likely to pucker that side  of the bodice so much that it will be quite drawn up, and the buttons  will not match the buttonholes.      A WOMAN'S SKIRTS.    Observe the extra fatigue which is insured to every woman in merely  carrying a tray upstairs, from the skirts of the dress. Ask any young  women who are studying to pass examinations whether they do not find  loose clothes a _sine qua non_ while poring over their books, and then  realize the harm we are doing ourselves and the race by habitually  lowering our powers of life and energy in such a manner. As a matter  of fact it is doubtful whether any persons have ever been found  who would say that their stays were at all tight; and, indeed, by a  muscular contraction they can apparently prove that they are not so by  moving them about on themselves, and thus probably believe what  they say. That they are in error all the same they can easily assure  themselves by first measuring round the waist outside the stays; then  take them off, let them measure while they take a deep breath, with  the tape merely laid on the body as if measuring for the quantity of  braid to go round a dress, and mark the result. The injury done by  stays is so entirely internal that it is not strange that the maladies  caused by wearing them should be attributed to every reason under  the sun except the true one, which is, briefly, that all the internal  organs, being by them displaced, are doing their work imperfectly and  under the least advantageous conditions: and are, therefore, exactly  in the state most favorable to the development of disease, whether  hereditary or otherwise.--_Macmillan's Magazine._      TO MAKE THE SLEEVES.    As to sleeves. Measure from the shoulder to the elbow and again from  elbow to the wrist. Lay these measurements on any sleeve patterns you  may have, and lengthen and shorten accordingly. The sleeve is cut in  two pieces, the top of the arm and the under part, which is about an  inch narrower than the outside. In joining the two together, if the  sleeve is at all tight, the upper part is slightly fulled to the lower  at the elbow. The sleeve is sewn to the armhole with no cordings now,  and the front seam should be about two inches in front of the bodice.    Bodices are now worn very tight-fitting, and the French stretch the  material well on the cross before beginning to cut out, and in cutting  allow the lining to be slightly pulled, so that when on, the outside  stretches to it and insures a better fit. An experienced eye can tell  a French-cut bodice at once, the front side pieces being always on the  cross. In dress cutting and fitting, as in everything else, there  are failures and discouragements, but practice overrules these little  matters, and \"trying again\" brings a sure reward in success.    A sensible suggestion is made in regard to the finish in necks of  dresses for morning wear. Plain colors have rather a stiff appearance,  tulle or crepe lisse frilling are expensive and frail, so it is a"]]]
