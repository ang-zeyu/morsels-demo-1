The better to ingratiate himself with the sovereign  pontiff, he engaged to pay him a yearly donation for the support of an  English college at Rome [g]; and, in order to raise the sum, he  imposed the tax of a penny on each house possessed of thirty pence a  year.  This imposition being afterwards levied on all England, was  commonly denominated Peter's Pence [h]: and though conferred at first  as a gift, was afterwards claimed as a tribute by the Roman pontiff.  Carrying his hypocrisy still farther, Offa, feigning to be directed by  a vision from heaven, discovered at Verulam the relics of St. Alban,  the martyr, and endowed a magnificent monastery in that place [i].  Moved by all these acts of piety, Malmesbury, one of the best of the  old English historians, declares himself at a loss to determine [k]  whether the merits or crimes of this prince preponderated.  Offa died  after a reign of thirty-nine years, in 794 [l].  [FN [d] Chron. Sax. p. 59.  [e] Brompton, p. 750, 751, 752.  [f] Spell.  Conc. p. 308.  Brompton, p. 776.  [g] Spell.

[k] Lib. 1. cap. 4.]    This prince was become so considerable in the Heptarchy, that the  Emperor Charlemagne entered into an alliance and friendship with him;  a circumstance which did honour to Offa, as distant princes at that  time had usually little communication with each other.  That emperor  being a great lover of learning and learned men, in an age very barren  of that ornament, Offa, at his desire, sent him over Alcuin, a  clergyman, much celebrated for his knowledge, who received great  honours from Charlemagne, and even became his preceptor in the  sciences.  The chief reason why he had at first desired the company of  Alcuin, was, that he might oppose his learning to the heresy of Felix,  Bishop of Urgel, in Catalonia, who maintained that Jesus Christ,  considered in his human nature, could more properly be denominated the  adoptive, than the natural son of God [m].  This heresy was condemned  in the council of Francfort, held in 794, and consisting of 300  bishops.  Such were the questions which were agitated in that age, and  which employed the attention not only of cloistered scholars, but of  the wisest and greatest princes [n].  [FN [l] Chron. Sax. p. 65  [m] Dupin, cent. 8. chap. 4.

See SPEED'S DESCRIPTION OF WALES.]    Egfrith succeeded to his father Offa, but survived him only five  months [o], when he made way for Kenulph, a descendant of the royal  family.  This prince waged war against Kent, and taking Egbert the  king prisoner, he cut off his hands, and put out his eyes, leaving  Cuthred, his own brother, in possession of the crown of that kingdom.  Kenulph was killed in an insurrection of the East Anglians, whose  crown his predecessor, Offa, had usurped.  He left his son, Kenelm, a  minor, who was murdered the same year by his sister, Quendrade, who  had entertained the ambitious views of assuming the government [p].  But she was supplanted by her uncle Ceolulf; who, two years after, was  dethroned by Beornulf.  The reign of this usurper, who was not of the  royal family, was short and unfortunate: he was defeated by the West  Saxons, and killed by his own subjects, the East Angles [q].  Ludican,  his successor, underwent the same fate [r]; and Wiglaff, who mounted  this unstable throne, and found every thing in the utmost confusion,  could not withstand the fortune of Egbert, who united all the Saxon  kingdoms into one great monarchy.

Beverl. p. 87.]    [MN The kingdom of Essex.]  This kingdom made no great figure in the Heptarchy, and the history of  it is very imperfect.  Sleda succeeded to his father, Erkinwin, the  founder of' the monarchy, and made way for his son, Sebert, who, being  nephew to Ethelbert, King of Kent, was persuaded by that prince to  embrace the Christian faith [s].  His sons and conjunct successors,  Sexted and Seward, relapsed into idolatry, and were soon after slain  in a battle against the West Saxons.  To show the rude manner of  living in that age, Bede tells us [t], that these two kings expressed  great desire to eat the white bread, distributed by Mellitus, the  bishop, at the [u] communion.  But on his refusing them, unless they  would submit to be baptized, they expelled him their dominions.  The  names of the other princes who reigned successively in Essex, are  Sigebert the Little, Sigebert the Good who restored Christianity,  Swithelm, Sigheri, Offa.  This last prince, having made a vow of  chastity, notwithstanding his marriage with Keneswitha, a Mercian  princess, daughter to Penda, went in pilgrimage to Rome, and shut  himself up during the rest of his life in a cloister.  Selred, his  successor, reigned thirty-eight years, and was the last of the royal  line; the failure of which threw the kingdom into great confusion, and  reduced it to dependence under Mercia [w].  Switherd first acquired  the crown, by the concession of the Mercian princes, and his death  made way for Sigeric, who ended his life in a pilgrimage to Rome.  His  successor, Sigered, unable to defend his kingdom, submitted to the  victorious arms of Egbert.  [FN [s] Chron. Sax. p. 24.  [t] Lib. 2. cap. 5.  [u] H. Hunting. lib.  3.  Brompton, p. 738, 743.  Bede.  [w] Malmes lib. 1. cap. 6.]    [MN The kingdom of Sussex.]  The history of this kingdom, the smallest in the Heptarchy, is still  more imperfect than that of Essex.  Aella, the founder of the  monarchy, left the crown to his son Cissa, who is chiefly remarkable  for his long reign of seventy-six years.  During his time, the South  Saxons fell almost into a total dependence on the kingdom of Wessex,  and we scarcely know the names of the princes who were possessed of  this titular sovereignty.  Adelwalch, the last of them, was subdued in  battle by Ceodwalla, King of Wessex, and was slain in the action,  leaving two infant sons, who, falling into the hand of the conqueror,  were murdered by him.  The Abbot of Retford opposed the order for this  execution, but could only prevail on Ceodwalla to suspend it till they  should be baptized.  Bercthun and Audhun, two noblemen of character,  resisted some time the violence of the West Saxons, but their  opposition served only to prolong the miseries of their country, and  the subduing of this kingdom was the first step which the West Saxons  made towards acquiring the sole monarchy of England [x].  [FN [x] Brompton, p. 800.]    [MN The Kingdom of Wessex.]  The kingdom of Wessex, which finally swallowed up all the other Saxon  states, met with great resistance on its first establishment: and the  Britons, who were now inured to arms, yielded not tamely their  possessions to those invaders.  Cerdic, the founder of the monarchy,  and his son, Kenric, fought many successful, and some unsuccessful,  battles against the natives; and the martial spirit, common to all the  Saxons, was, by means of these hostilities, carried to the greatest  height, among this tribe.  Ceaulin, who was the son and successor of  Kenric, and who began his reign in 560, was still more ambitious and  enterprising than his predecessors, and by waging continual war  against the Britons, he added a great part of the counties of Devon  and Somerset to his other dominions.  Carried along by the tide of  success, he invaded the other Saxon states in his neighbourhood, and  becoming terrible to all, he provoked a general confederacy against  him.  This alliance proved successful under the conduct of Ethelbert,  King of Kent; and Ceaulin, who had lost the affections of his own  subjects by his violent disposition, and had now fallen into contempt  from his misfortunes, was expelled the throne [y], and died in exile  and misery.  Cuichelme and Cuthwin, his sons, governed jointly the  kingdom, till the expulsion of the latter in 591, and the death of the  former in 593, made way for Cealric, to whom succeeded Ceobald in 593,  by whose death, which happened in 611, Kynegils inherited the crown.  This prince embraced Christianity [z], through the persuasion of  Oswald, King of Northumberland, who had married his daughter, and who  had attained a great ascendant in the Heptarchy.  Kenwalch next  succeeded to the monarchy, and dying in 672, left the succession so  much disputed, that Sexburga, his widow, a woman of spirit [a], kept  possession of the government till her death, which happened two years  after.  Escwin then peaceably acquired the crown, and after a short  reign of two years made way for Kentwin, who governed nine years.  Ceodwalla, his successor, mounted not the throne without opposition,  but proved a great prince according to the ideas of those times; that  is, he was enterprising, warlike, and successful.  He entirely subdued  the kingdom of Sussex, and annexed it to his own dominions.  He made  inroads into Kent, but met with resistance from Widred, the king, who  proved successful against Mollo, brother to Ceodwalla, and slew him in  a skirmish.  Ceodwalla, at last, tired with wars and bloodshed, was  seized with a fit of devotion; bestowed several endowments on the  church; and made a pilgrimage to Rome, where he received baptism, and  died in 689.  Ina, his successor, inherited the military virtues of  Ceodwalla, and added to them the more valuable ones of justice,  policy, and prudence.  He made war upon the Britons in Somerset, and  having finally subdued that province, he treated the vanquished with a  humanity hitherto unknown to the Saxon conquerors.

And this will be so all the more that the physicians of our time  have not sufficient training in psychology to enable them to do justice  to the psychology of the criminal.    You must, therefore, give a scientific management to these institutions,  and you will then render humane even the treatment of those grave and  dangerous criminals, whose condition cannot be met by a simple  compensation of the injury they have done to others.    This is the function of repression as we look upon it, an inevitable  result of the positive data regarding the natural origin of crime.    We believe, in other words, that repression will play but an unimportant  role in the future. We believe that every branch of legislation will  come to prefer the remedies of social hygiene to those symptomatic  remedies and apply them from day to day. And thus we come to the theory  of the prevention of crime. Some say: \"it is better to repress than to  prevent.\" Others say: \"It is better to prevent than to repress.\" In  order to solve this conflict we must remember that there are two widely  different kinds of repression. There is the immediate, direct empirical  repression, which does not investigate the cause of criminality, but  waits until the crime is about to be committed. That is police  prevention. There is on the other hand a social prevention which has an  indirect and more remote function, which does not wait until crime is  about to be committed, but locates the causes of crime in poverty,  abandoned children, trampdom, etc, and seeks to prevent these  conditions by remote and indirect means. In Italy, prevention is  anonymous with arrest. That is to say, by repression is understood only  police repression. Under these circumstances, it is well to take it for  granted that some of the expected crimes will be carried out, for crimes  are not committed at fixed periods after first informing the police. The  damage done by criminality, and especially by political and social  criminality, against which police repression is particularly directed,  will be smaller than that done by the abuse inseparably connected with  police power. In the case of atavistic criminality, prevention does not  mean handcuffing of the man who is about to commit a crime, but devising  such economic and educational measures in the family and administration  as will eliminate the causes of crime or attenuate them, precisely  because punishment is less effective than prevention.    In other words, in order to prevent crime, we must have recourse to  measures which I have called \"substitutes for punishment,\" and which  prevent, the development of crime, because they go to the source in  order to do away with effects.    Bentham narrates that the postal service in England, in the 18th  century, was in the hands of stage drivers, but this service was not  connected with the carrying of passengers, as became the custom later.  And then it was impossible to get the drivers to arrive on time,  because they stopped too often at the inns. Fines were imposed,  imprisonment was resorted to, yet the drivers arrived late. The  penalties did not accomplish any results so long as the causes remained.  Then the idea was conceived to carry passengers on the postal stages,  and that stopped the drivers from being late, because whenever they made  a halt, the passengers, who had an interest in arriving on time, called  the drivers and did not give them much time to linger. This is an  illustration of a substitute for punishment.    Another illustration. In the Middle Ages, up to the eve of our modern  civilization, piracy was in vogue. Is there anything that was not tried  to suppress piracy? The pirates were persecuted like wild beasts.  Whenever they were caught they were condemned to the most terrible forms  of death. Yet piracy continued. Then came the application of steam  navigation, and piracy disappeared as by magic. And robbery and  brigandage? They withstood the death penalty and extraordinary raids by  soldiers. And we witness today the spectacle of a not very serious  contest between the police who wants to catch a brigand, Musolino; and  a brigand who does not wish to be caught.    Wherever the woods are not traversed by railroads or tramways,  brigandage carries on its criminal trade. But wherever railroads and  tramways exist, brigandage is a form of crime which disappears. You may  insist on death penalties and imprisonment, but assault and robbery will  continue, because it is connected with geographical conditions. Use on  the other hand the instrument of civilization, without sentencing any  one, and brigandage and robbery will disappear before its light. And if  human beings in large industrial centers are herded together in  tenements and slum hotels, how can a humane judge aggravate the  penalties against sexual crimes? How can the sense of shame develop  among people, when young and old of both sexes are crowded together in  the same bed, in the same corrupted and corrupting environment, which  robs the human soul of every noble spark?    I might stray pretty far, if I were to continue these illustrations of  social hygiene which will be the true solution of the problem and the  supreme systematic, daily humane, and bloodless remedy against the  disease of criminality. However, we have not the simple faith that in  the near or far future of humanity crimes can ever be wholly eradicated.  Even Socialism, which looks forward to a fundamental transformation of  future society on the basis of brotherhood and social justice, cannot  elevate itself to the absolute and naive faith that criminality,  insanity, and suicide can ever fully disappear from the earth. But it is  our firm conviction that the endemic form of criminality, insanity, and  suicide will disappear, and that nothing will remain of them but rare  sporadic forms caused by lesion or telluric and other influences.    Since we have made the great discovery that malaria, which weighs upon  so many parts in Italy, is dependent for its transmission on a certain  mosquito, we have acquired the control of malarial therapeutics and are  enabled to protect individuals and families effectively against malaria.  But aside from this function of protecting people, there must be a  social prevention, and since those malarial insects can live only in  swampy districts, it is necessary to bring to those unreclaimed lands  the blessing of the hoe and plow, in order to remove the cause and do  away with the effects. The same problem confronts us in criminology. In  the society of the future we shall undertake this work of social  hygiene, and thereby we shall remove the epidemic forms of criminality.  And nine-tenths of the crimes will then disappear, so that nothing will  remain of them but exceptional cases. There will remain, for instance,  such cases as that of the bricklayer which I mentioned, because there  may always be accidents, no matter what may be the form of social  organization, and nervous disorders may thus appear in certain  individuals. But you can see that these would be exceptional cases of  criminality, which will be easily cured under the direction of science,  that will be the supreme and beneficent manager of institutes for the  segregation of those who will be unfit for social intercourse. The  problem of criminality will thus be solved as far as possible, because  the gradual transformation of society will eliminate the swamps in which  the miasma of crime may form and breed.    If we wish to apply these standards to an example which today attracts  the attention of all Italy to this noble city, if we desire to carry our  theories into the practice of contemporaneous life, if science is to  respond to the call of life, let us throw a glance at that form of  endemic criminality known as the Camorra in this city, which has taken  root here just as stabbing affrays have in certain centers of Turin, and  the Mafia in certain centers of Sicily. In the first place, we must not  be wilfully blind to facts and refuse to see that the citizens will  protect themselves, if social justice does not do so. And from that to  crime there is but a shot step. But which is the swampy soil in which  this social disease can spread and persist like leprosy in tin  collective organism? It is the economic poverty of the masses, which  lends to intellectual and moral poverty.    You have lately had in Naples a very fortunate struggle, which seems to  have overcome one of the representatives of the high Camorra. But can we  believe that the courageous work of a few public writers has touched the  roots of the Camorra in this city? It would be self-deception to think  so. For we see that plants blossom out again, even after the most  destructive hurricane has passed over them.    The healing of society is not so easy, that a collective plague may be  cured by the courageous acts of one or more individuals. The process is  much slower and more complicated. Nevertheless these episodes are  milestones of victory in the onward march of civilization, which will  paralyze the historical manifestations of social criminality. Here,  then, we have a city in which some hundred thousand people rise every  morning and do not know how to get a living, who have no fixed  occupation, because there is not enough industrial development to reach  that methodical application of labor which lifted humanity out of the  prehistoric forests. Truly, the human race progresses by two uplifting  energies: War and labor.    In primitive and savage society, when the human personality did not know  the check of social discipline, a military discipline held the members  of the tribe together. But war, while useful in primitive society, loses  its usefulness more and more, because it carries within itself the  cancer that paralyzes it.    While war compels collective groups to submit to the co-ordi"]]]
