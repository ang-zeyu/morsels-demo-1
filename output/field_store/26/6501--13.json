You look at the policeman upon the corner of the  road, and you say to yourself 'I am safe.' Believe me, not at all so is  it, but much the opposite. We have ways by which it is of no account the  policeman on the corner of the road. That is all, Senor Bleke. We wish  you a good night.\"    The deputation withdrew.    Maraquita, informed of the incident, snapped her fingers, and said  \"Poof!\" It sometimes struck Roland that she would be more real help in a  difficult situation if she could get out of the habit of saying \"Poof!\"    \"It is nothing,\" she said.    \"No?\" said Roland.    \"We easily out-trick them, isn't it? You make a will leaving your money  to the Cause, and then where are they, _hein_?\"    It was one way of looking at it, but it brought little balm to Roland.  He said so. Maraquita scanned his face keenly.    \"You are not weakening, Roland?\" she said. \"You would not betray us  now?\"    \"Well, of course, I don't know about betraying, you know, but still----.  What I mean is----\"    Maraquita's eyes seemed to shoot forth two flames.    \"Take care,\" she cried. \"With me it is nothing, for I know that your  heart is with Paranoya. But, if the others once had cause to suspect  that your resolve was failing--ah! If Bombito----\"    Roland took her point. He had forgotten Bombito for the moment.    \"For goodness' sake,\" he said hastily, \"don't go saying anything to  Bombito to give him the idea that I'm trying to back out. Of course you  can rely on me, and all that. That's all right.\"    Maraquita's gaze softened. She raised her glass--they were lunching at  the time--and put it to her lips.    \"To the Savior of Paranoya!\" she said.    \"Beware!\" whispered a voice in Roland's ear.    He turned with a start. A waiter was standing behind him, a small, dark,  hairy man. He was looking into the middle distance with the abstracted  air which waiters cultivate.    Roland stared at him, but he did not move.    That evening, returning to his flat, Roland was paralyzed by the sight  of the word \"Beware\" scrawled across the mirror in his bedroom. It had  apparently been done with a diamond. He rang the bell.    \"Sir?\" said the competent valet. (\"Competent valets are in attendance at  each of these flats.\"--_Advt._)    \"Has any one been here since I left?\"    \"Yes, sir. A foreign-looking gentleman called. He said he knew you, sir.  I showed him into your room.\"    The same night, well on in the small hours, the telephone rang. Roland  dragged himself out of bed.    \"Hullo?\"    \"Is that Senor Bleke?\"    \"Yes. What is it?\"    \"Beware!\"    Things were becoming intolerable. Roland had a certain amount of  nerve, but not enough to enable him to bear up against this sinister  persecution. Yet what could he do? Suppose he did beware to the extent  of withdrawing his support from the royalist movement, what then?  Bombito. If ever there was a toad under the harrow, he was that toad.  And all because a perfectly respectful admiration for the caoutchouc  had led him to occupy a stage-box several nights in succession at the  theater where the peerless Maraquita tied herself into knots.           *       *       *       *       *    There was an air of unusual excitement in Maraquita's manner at their  next meeting.    \"We have been in communication with Him,\" she whispered. \"He will  receive you. He will give an audience to the Savior of Paranoya.\"    \"Eh? Who will?\"    \"Our beloved Alejandro. He wishes to see his faithful servant. We are to  go to him at once.\"    \"Where?\"    \"At his own house. He will receive you in person.\"    Such was the quality of the emotions through which he had been passing  of late, that Roland felt but a faint interest at the prospect of  meeting face to face a genuine--if exiled--monarch. The thought did flit  through his mind that they would sit up a bit in old Fineberg's office  if they could hear of it, but it brought him little consolation.    The cab drew up at a gloomy-looking house in a fashionable square.  Roland rang the door-bell. There seemed a certain element of the prosaic  in the action. He wondered what he should say to the butler.    There was, however, no need for words. The door opened, and they were  ushered in without parley. A butler and two footmen showed them into a  luxuriously furnished anteroom. Roland entered with two thoughts  running in his mind. The first was that the beloved Alejandro had got an  uncommonly snug crib; the second that this was exactly like going to see  the dentist.    Presently the squad of retainers returned, the butler leading.    \"His Majesty will receive Mr. Bleke.\"    Roland followed him with tottering knees.    His Majesty, King Alejandro the Thirteenth, on the retired list, was a  genial-looking man of middle age, comfortably stout about the middle  and a little bald as to the forehead. He might have been a prosperous  stock-broker. Roland felt more at his ease at the very sight of him.    \"Sit down, Mr. Bleke,\" said His Majesty, as the door closed. \"I have  been wanting to see you for some time.\"    Roland had nothing to say. He was regaining his composure, but he had a  long way to go yet before he could feel thoroughly at home.    King Alejandro produced a cigaret-case, and offered it to Roland,  who shook his head speechlessly. The King lit a cigaret and smoked  thoughtfully for a while.    \"You know, Mr. Bleke,\" he said at last, \"this must stop. It really must.  I mean your devoted efforts on my behalf.\"    Roland gaped at him.    \"You are a very young man. I had expected to see some one much older.  Your youth gives me the impression that you have gone into this affair  from a spirit of adventure. I can assure you that you have nothing to  gain commercially by interfering with my late kingdom. I hope, before  we part, that I can persuade you to abandon your idea of financing this  movement to restore me to the throne.    \"I don't understand--er--your majesty.\"    \"I will explain. Please treat what I shall say as strictly confidential.  You must know, Mr. Bleke, that these attempts to re-establish me as a  reigning monarch in Paranoya are, frankly, the curse of an otherwise  very pleasant existence. You look surprized? My dear sir, do you know  Paranoya? Have you ever been there? Have you the remotest idea what sort  of life a King of Paranoya leads? I have tried it, and I can assure  you that a coal-heaver is happy by comparison. In the first place, the  climate of the country is abominable. I always had a cold in the head.  Secondly, there is a small but energetic section of the populace whose  sole recreation it seems to be to use their monarch as a target for  bombs. They are not very good bombs, it is true, but one in, say, ten  explodes, and even an occasional bomb is unpleasant if you are the  target.    \"Finally, I am much too fond of your delightful country to wish to leave  it. I was educated in England--I am a Magdalene College man--and I have  the greatest horror of ever being compelled to leave it. My present life  suits me exactly. That is all I wished to say, Mr. Bleke. For both our  sakes, for the sake of my comfort and your purse, abandon this scheme of  yours.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Roland walked home thoughtfully. Maraquita had left the royal residence  long before he had finished the whisky-and-soda which the genial monarch  had pressed upon him. As he walked, the futility of his situation came  home to him more and more. Whatever he did, he was bound to displease  somebody; and these Paranoyans were so confoundedly impulsive when they  were vexed.    For two days he avoided Maraquita. On the third, with something of the  instinct which draws the murderer to the spot where he has buried the  body, he called at her house.    She was not present, but otherwise there was a full gathering. There  were the marquises; there were the counts; there was Bombito.    He looked unhappily round the crowd.    Somebody gave him a glass of champagne. He raised it.    \"To the revolution,\" he said mechanically.    There was a silence--it seemed to Roland an awkward silence. As if he  had said something improper, the marquises and counts began to drift  from the room, till only Bombito was left. Roland regarded him with some  apprehension. He was looking larger and more unusual than ever.    But to-night, apparently, Bombito was in genial mood. He came forward  and slapped Roland on the shoulder. And then the remarkable fact came to  light that Bombito spoke English, or a sort of English.    \"My old chap,\" he said. \"I would have a speech with you.\"    He slapped Roland again on the shoulder.    \"The others they say, 'Break it with Senor Bleke gently.' Maraquita say  'Break it with Senor Bleke gently.' So I break it with you gently.\"    He dealt Roland a third stupendous punch. Whatever was to be broken  gently, it was plain to Roland that it was not himself. And suddenly  there came to him a sort of intuition that told him that Bombito was  nervous.    \"After all you have done for us, Senor Bleke, we shall seem to you  ungrateful bounders, but what is it? Yes? No? I shouldn't wonder,  perhaps. The whole fact is that there has been political crisis in  Paranoya. Upset. Apple-cart. Yes? You follow? No? The Ministry have  been--what do you say?--put through it. Expelled. Broken up. No more  ministry. New ministry wanted. To conciliate royalist party, that is  the cry. So deputation of leading persons, mighty good chaps, prominent  merchants and that sort of bounder, call upon us. They offer me to be  President. See? No? Yes? That's right. I am ambitious blighter, Senor  Bleke. What about it, no? I accept. I am new President of Paranoya. So  no need for your kind assistance. Royalist revolution up the spout. No  more royalist revolution.\"    The wave of relief which swept over Roland ebbed sufficiently after an  interval to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8743"],[0,"Mary Schweidler, the amber witch (#13)"],[1,"the _Opp. St.  Augustini_ on my birthday, which falls on the 28th _mensis Augusti_. She  had always covered over the earth she cast up with twigs of fir, whereof  there were plenty in the forest, so that no one should perceive anything  of it.    Meanwhile, however, it befell that the young _nobilis_ Ruediger of  Nienkerken came riding one day to gather news of the terrible witchcraft  that went on in the village. When I had told him all about it he shook his  head doubtingly, and said he believed that all witchcraft was nothing but  lies and deceit; whereat I was struck with great horror, inasmuch as I had  hitherto held the young lord to be a wiser man, and now could not but see  that he was an Atheist. He guessed what my thoughts were, and with a smile  he answered me by asking whether I had ever read Johannes Wierus, who  would hear nothing of witchcraft, and who argued that all witches were  melancholy persons who only imagined to themselves that they had a  _pactum_ with the devil; and that to him they seemed more worthy of pity  than of punishment? Hereupon I answered that I had not indeed read any  such book (for say, who can read all that fools write?), but that the  appearances here and in all other places proved that it was a monstrous  error to deny the reality of witchcraft, inasmuch as people might then  likewise deny that there were such things as murder, adultery, and theft.    But he called my _argumentum_ a _dilemma_, and after he had discoursed a  great deal of the devil, all of which I have forgotten, seeing it savoured  strangely of heresy, he said he would relate to me a piece of witchcraft  which he himself had seen at Wittenberg.    It seems that one morning, as an Imperial captain mounted his good charger  at the Elstergate in order to review his company, the horse presently  began to rage furiously, reared, tossed his head, snorted, kicked, and  roared, not as horses used to neigh, but with a sound as though the voice  came from a human throat, so that all the folks were amazed, and thought  the horse bewitched. It presently threw the captain, and crushed his head  with its hoof, so that he lay writhing on the ground, and straightway set  off at full speed. Hereupon a trooper fired his carabine at the bewitched  horse, which fell in the midst of the road, and presently died. That he,  Ruediger, had then drawn near, together with many others, seeing that the  colonel had forthwith given orders to the surgeon of the regiment to cut  open the horse and see in what state it was inwardly. However, that  everything was quite right, and both the surgeon and army physician  testified that the horse was thoroughly sound; whereupon all the people  cried out more than ever about witchcraft. Meanwhile he himself (I mean  the young _nobilis_) saw a thin smoke coming out from the horse's  nostrils, and on stooping down to look what it might be, he drew out a  match as long as my finger, which still smouldered, and which some wicked  fellow had privately thrust into its nose with a pin. Hereupon all  thoughts of witchcraft were at an end, and search was made for the  culprit, who was presently found to be no other than the captain's own  groom. For one day that his master had dusted his jacket for him he swore  an oath that he would have his revenge, which indeed the provost-marshal  himself had heard as he chanced to be standing in the stable. _Item_,  another soldier bore witness that he had seen the fellow cut a piece off  the fuse not long before he led out his master's horse. And thus thought  the young lord, would it be with all witchcraft if it were sifted to the  bottom; like as I myself had seen at Guetzkow, where the devil's apparition  turned out to be a cordwainer, and that one day I should own that it was  the same sort of thing here in our village. By reason of this speech I  liked not the young nobleman from that hour forward, believing him to be  an Atheist. Though, indeed, afterwards, I have had cause to see that he  was in the right, more's the pity; for had it not been for him what would  have become of my daughter?    But I will say nothing beforehand.--_Summa_: I walked about the room in  great displeasure at his words, while the young lord began to argue with  my daughter upon witchcraft, now in Latin, and now in the vulgar tongue,  as the words came into his mouth, and wanted to hear her mind about it.  But she answered that she was a foolish thing, and could have no opinion  on the matter; but that, nevertheless, she believed that what happened in  the village could not be by natural means. Hereupon the maid called me out  of the room (I forget what she wanted of me); but when I came back again  my daughter was as red as scarlet, and the nobleman stood close before  her. I therefore asked her, as soon as he had ridden off, whether anything  had happened, which she at first denied, but afterwards owned that he had  said to her while I was gone that he knew but one person who could  bewitch; and when she asked him who that person was, he caught hold of her  hand and said, \"It is yourself, sweet maid; for you have thrown a spell  upon my heart, as I feel right well!\" But that he said nothing further,  but only gazed on her face with eager eyes, and this it was that made her  so red.    But this is the way with maidens; they ever have their secrets if one's  back is turned but for a minute; and the proverb      To drive a goose and watch a maid    Needs the devil himself to aid    is but too true, as will be shown hereafter, more's the pity!          _The Fourteenth Chapter_      HOW OLD SEDEN DISAPPEARED ALL ON A SUDDEN:  _ITEM_, HOW THE GREAT GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS CAME TO POMERANIA, AND TOOK THE  FORT AT PEENEMUeNDE    We were now left for some time in peace from witchcraft; unless, indeed, I  reckon the caterpillars, which miserably destroyed my orchard, and which  truly were a strange thing; for the trees blossomed so fair and sweetly  that one day as we were walking under them, and praising the almighty  power of the most merciful God, my child said, \"If the Lord goes on to  bless us so abundantly, it will be Christmas Eve with us every night of  next winter!\" But things soon fell out far otherwise; for all in a moment  the trees were covered with such swarms of caterpillars (great and small,  and of every shape and colour) that one might have measured them by the  bushel, and before long my poor trees looked like brooms, and the blessed  fruit--which was so well set--all fell off, and was scarce good enough for  the pigs. I do not choose to lay this to any one, though I had my own  private thoughts upon the matter, and have them yet. However, my barley,  whereof I had sown about three bushels out on the common, shot up bravely.  On my field I had sown nothing, seeing that I dreaded the malice of Satan.  Neither was corn at all plentiful throughout the parish--in part because  they had sown no winter crops, and in part because the summer crops did  not prosper. However, in all the villages a great supply of fish was  caught by the mercy of God, especially herring; but they were very low in  price. Moreover, they killed many seals; and at Whitsuntide I myself  killed one as I walked by the sea with my daughter. The creature lay on a  rock close to the water, snoring like a Christian. Thereupon I pulled off  my shoes and drew near him softly, so that he heard me not, and then  struck him over his nose with my staff (for a seal cannot bear much on his  nose), so that he tumbled over into the water; but he was quite stunned,  and I could easily kill him outright. It was a fat beast, though not very  large; and we melted forty pots of train-oil out of his fat, which we put  by for a winter store.    Meanwhile, however, something seized old Seden all at once, so that he  wished to receive the holy sacrament. When I went to him he could give no  reason for it; or perhaps he would give none for fear of his old Lizzie,  who was always watching him with her squinting eyes, and would not leave  the room. However, Zuter his little girl, a child near twelve years old,  said that a few days before, while she was plucking grass for the cattle  under the garden-hedge by the road, she heard the husband and wife  quarrelling violently again, and that the goodman threw in her teeth that  he now knew of a certainty that she had a familiar spirit, and that he  would straightway go and tell it to the priest. Albeit this is only a  child's tale, it may be true for all that, seeing that children and fools,  they say, speak the truth.    But be that as it may. _Summa_, my old warden grew worse and worse; and  though I visited him every morning and evening--as I use to do to my  sick--in order to pray with him, and often observed that he had somewhat  on his mind, nevertheless he could not disburthen himself of it, seeing  that old Lizzie never left her post.    This went on for a while, when at last one day, about noon, he sent to beg  me to scrape a little silver off the new sacramental cup, because he had  been told that he should get better if he took it mixed with the dung of  fowls. For some time I would not consent, seeing that I straightway  suspected that there was some devilish mischief behind it; but he begged  and prayed, till I did as he would have me.    And lo and behold, he mended from that very hour; so that when I went to  pray with him at evening, I found him already sitting on the bench with a  bowl between his knees, out of which he was supping broth. However, he  would not pray (which was strange, seeing that he used to pray so gladly,  and often could not wait patiently for my coming, insomuch that he sent  after me two or three times if I was not at hand, or elsewhere employed);  but he told me he had prayed already, and that he would give me the cock  whose dung he had taken for my trouble, as it was a fine large cock, and  he had nothing better to offer for my Sunday's"]]]
