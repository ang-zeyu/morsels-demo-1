Each great band of clay signifies a   long period, during which fine mud was brought down from some wasting   land in the neighbourhood.  And that land was not far distant is   proved by the bones of the Pterodactyle, of Crocodiles, and of   Marsupials; by the fact that the shells are of shallow-water or shore   species; by the presence, mixed with them, of fragments of wood,   impressions of plants, and even wing-shells of beetles; and lastly,   if further proof was needed, by the fact that in the \"dirt-bed\" of   the Isle of Portland and the neighbouring shores, stumps of trees   allied to the modern sago-palms are found as they grew in the soil,   which, with them, has been covered up in layers of freshwater shale   and limestone.  A tropic forest has plainly sunk beneath a lagoon;   and that lagoon, again, beneath the sea.    And how long did this period of slow sinking go on?  Who can tell?    The thickness of the Lias and Oolites together cannot be less than a   thousand feet.  Considering, then, the length of time required to lay   down a thousand feet of strata, and considering the vast difference   between the animals found in them, and the few found in the New Red   sandstone, we have a right to call them another world, and that one   which must have lasted for ages.    After we pass Oxford, or the Vale of Aylesbury, we enter yet another   world.  We come to a bed of sand, under which the freestones and   their adjoining clays dip to the south-east.  This is called commonly   the lower Greensand, though it is not green, but rich iron-red.  Then   succeeds a band of stiff blue clay, called the Gault, and then   another bed of sand, the upper Greensand, which is more worthy of the   name, for it does carry, in most places, a band of green or   \"glauconite\" sand.  But it and the upper layers of the lower   Greensand also, are worth our attention; for we are all probably   eating them from time to time in the form of bran.    It had been long remarked that certain parts of these beds carried   admirable wheatland; it had been remarked, too, that the finest hop-  lands--those of Farnham, for instance, and Tunbridge--lay upon them:    but that the fertile band was very narrow; that, as in the Surrey   Moors, vast sheets of the lower Greensand were not worth cultivation.    What caused the striking difference?    My beloved friend and teacher, the late Dr. Henslow, when Professor   of Botany at Cambridge, had brought to him by a farmer (so the story   ran) a few fossils.  He saw, being somewhat of a geologist and   chemist, that they were not, as fossils usually are, carbonate of   lime, but phosphate of lime--bone-earth.  He said at once, as by an   inspiration, \"You have found a treasure--not a gold-mine, indeed, but   a food-mine.  This is bone-earth, which we are at our wits' end to   get for our grain and pulse; which we are importing, as expensive   bones, all the way from Buenos Ayres.  Only find enough of them, and   you will increase immensely the food supply of England, and perhaps   make her independent of foreign phosphates in case of war.\"    His advice was acted on; for the British farmer is by no means the   stupid personage which townsfolk are too apt to fancy him.  This bed   of phosphates was found everywhere in the Greensand, underlying the   Chalk.  It may be traced from Dorsetshire through England to   Cambridge, and thence, I believe, into Yorkshire.  It may be traced   again, I believe, all round the Weald of Kent and Sussex, from Hythe   to Farnham--where it is peculiarly rich--and so to Eastbourne and   Beachey Head; and it furnishes, in Cambridgeshire, the greater part   of those so-called \"coprolites,\" which are used perpetually now for   manure, being ground up, and then treated with sulphuric acid, till   they become a \"soluble super-phosphate of lime.\"    So much for the useless \"hobby,\" as some fancy it, of poking over old   bones and stones, and learning a little of the composition of this   earth on which God has placed us.    How to explain the presence of this vast mass of animal matter, in   one or two thin bands right across England, I know not.  That the   fossils have been rolled on a sea-beach is plain to those who look at   them.  But what caused so vast a destruction of animal life along   that beach, must remain one of the buried secrets of the past.    And now we are fast nearing another world, which is far younger than   that coprolite bed, and has been formed under circumstances the most   opposite to it.  We are nearing, by whatever rail we approach London,   the escarpment of the chalk downs.    All readers, surely, know the white chalk, the special feature and   the special pride of the south of England.  All know its softly-  rounded downs, its vast beech woods, its short and sweet turf, its   snowy cliffs, which have given--so some say--to the whole island the   name of Albion--the white land.  But all do not, perhaps, know that   till we get to the chalk no single plant or animal has been found   which is exactly like any plant or animal now known to be living.    The plants and animals grow, on the whole, more and more like our   living forms as we rise in the series of beds.  But only above the   chalk (as far as we yet know) do we begin to find species identical   with those living now.    This in itself would prove a vast lapse of time.  We shall have a   further proof of that vast lapse when we examine the chalk itself.    It is composed--of this there is now no doubt--almost entirely of the   shells of minute animalcules; and animalcules (I use an unscientific   word for the sake of unscientific readers) like these, and in some   cases identical with them, are now forming a similar deposit of mud,   at vast depths, over the greater part of the Atlantic sea-floor.    This fact has been put out of doubt by recent deep-sea dredgings.  A   whole literature has been written on it of late.  Any reader who   wishes to know it, need only ask the first geologist he meets; and if   he has the wholesome instinct of wonder in him, fill his imagination   with true wonders, more grand and strange than he is like to find in   any fairy tale.  All I have to do with the matter here is, to say   that, arguing from the known to the unknown, from the Atlantic deep-  sea ooze which we do know about, to the chalk which we do not know   about, the whole of the chalk must have been laid down at the bottom   of a deep and still ocean, far out of the reach of winds, tides, and   even currents, as a great part of the Atlantic sea-floor is at this   day.    Prodigious! says the reader.  And so it is.  Prodigious to think that   that shallow Greensand shore, strewed with dead animals, should sink   to the bottom of an ocean, perhaps a mile, perhaps some four miles   deep.  Prodigious the time during which it must have lain as a still   ocean-floor.  For so minute are the living atomies which form the   ooze, that an inch, I should say, is as much as we can allow for   their yearly deposit; and the chalk is at least a thousand feet   thick.  It may have taken, therefore, twelve thousand years to form   the chalk alone.  A rough guess, of course, but one as likely to be   two or three times too little as two or three times too big.  Such,   or somewhat such, is the fact.  It had long been suspected, and more   than suspected; and the late discoveries of Dr. Carpenter and Mr.   Wyville Thompson have surely placed it beyond doubt.    Thus, surely, if we call the Oolitic beds one new world above the New   Red sandstone, we must call the chalk a second new world in like   wise.    I will not trouble the reader here with the reasons why geologists   connect the chalk with the greensands below it, by regular   gradations, in spite of the enormous downward leap, from sea-shore to   deep ocean, which the beds seem (but only seem) to have taken.  The   change--like all changes in geology--was probably gradual.  Not by   spasmodic leaps and starts, but slowly and stately, as befits a God   of order, of patience, and of strength, have these great deeds been   done.    But we have not yet done with new worlds or new prodigies on our way   to London, as any Londoner may ascertain for himself, if he will run   out a few miles by rail, and look in any cutting or pit, where the   surface of the chalk, and the beds which lie on it, are exposed.    On the chalk lie--especially in the Blackheath and Woolwich district-  -sands and clays.  And what do they tell us?    Of another new world, in which the chalk has been lifted up again, to   form gradually, doubtless, and at different points in succession, the   shore of a sea.    But what proof is there of this?    The surface of the chalk is not flat and smooth, as it must have been   when at the bottom of the sea.  It is eaten out into holes and   furrows, plainly by the gnawing of the waves; and on it lie, in many   places, large rolled flints out of chalk which has been destroyed,   beds of shore-shingle, beds of oysters lying as they grew, fresh or   brackish water-shells standing as they lived, bits of lignite (fossil   wood half turned to coal), and (as in Katesgrove pits at Reading)   leaves of trees.  Proof enough, one would say, that the chalk had   been raised till part of it at least became dry land, and carried   vegetation.    And yet we have not done.  There is another world to tell of yet.    For these beds (known as the Woolwich and Reading beds) dip under   that vast bed of London clay, four hundred and more feet thick, which   (as I said in my last chapter) was certainly laid down by the estuary   of some great tropic river, among palm-trees and Anonas, crocodiles   and turtles.

CHAPTER VIII    What a contrast, Duane thought, the evening of that day presented to the  state of his soul!    The sunset lingered in golden glory over the distant Mexican mountains;  twilight came slowly; a faint breeze blew from the river cool and sweet;  the late cooing of a dove and the tinkle of a cowbell were the only  sounds; a serene and tranquil peace lay over the valley.    Inside Duane's body there was strife. This third facing of a desperate  man had thrown him off his balance. It had not been fatal, but it  threatened so much. The better side of his nature seemed to urge him  to die rather than to go on fighting or opposing ignorant, unfortunate,  savage men. But the perversity of him was so great that it dwarfed  reason, conscience. He could not resist it. He felt something dying in  him. He suffered. Hope seemed far away. Despair had seized upon him and  was driving him into a reckless mood when he thought of Jennie.    He had forgotten her. He had forgotten that he had promised to save her.  He had forgotten that he meant to snuff out as many lives as might stand  between her and freedom. The very remembrance sheered off his morbid  introspection. She made a difference. How strange for him to realize  that! He felt grateful to her. He had been forced into outlawry; she had  been stolen from her people and carried into captivity. They had met in  the river fastness, he to instil hope into her despairing life, she to  be the means, perhaps, of keeping him from sinking to the level of her  captors. He became conscious of a strong and beating desire to see her,  talk with her.    These thoughts had run through his mind while on his way to Mrs. Bland's  house. He had let Euchre go on ahead because he wanted more time  to compose himself. Darkness had about set in when he reached his  destination. There was no light in the house. Mrs. Bland was waiting for  him on the porch.    She embraced him, and the sudden, violent, unfamiliar contact sent such  a shock through him that he all but forgot the deep game he was playing.  She, however, in her agitation did not notice his shrinking. From her  embrace and the tender, incoherent words that flowed with it he gathered  that Euchre had acquainted her of his action with Black.    \"He might have killed you,\" she whispered, more clearly; and if Duane  had ever heard love in a voice he heard it then. It softened him. After  all, she was a woman, weak, fated through her nature, unfortunate in  her experience of life, doomed to unhappiness and tragedy. He met her  advance so far that he returned the embrace and kissed her. Emotion such  as she showed would have made any woman sweet, and she had a certain  charm. It was easy, even pleasant, to kiss her; but Duane resolved that,  whatever her abandonment might become, he would not go further than the  lie she made him act.    \"Buck, you love me?\" she whispered.    \"Yes--yes,\" he burst out, eager to get it over, and even as he spoke  he caught the pale gleam of Jennie's face through the window. He felt  a shame he was glad she could not see. Did she remember that she had  promised not to misunderstand any action of his? What did she think of  him, seeing him out there in the dusk with this bold woman in his  arms? Somehow that dim sight of Jennie's pale face, the big dark eyes,  thrilled him, inspired him to his hard task of the present.    \"Listen, dear,\" he said to the woman, and he meant his words for the  girl. \"I'm going to take you away from this outlaw den if I have to kill  Bland, Alloway, Rugg--anybody who stands in my path. You were dragged  here. You are good--I know it. There's happiness for you somewhere--a  home among good people who will care for you. Just wait till--\"    His voice trailed off and failed from excess of emotion. Kate Bland  closed her eyes and leaned her head on his breast. Duane felt her heart  beat against his, and conscience smote him a keen blow. If she loved  him so much! But memory and understanding of her character hardened him  again, and he gave her such commiseration as was due her sex, and no  more.    \"Boy, that's good of you,\" she whispered, \"but it's too late. I'm done  for. I can't leave Bland. All I ask is that you love me a little and  stop your gun-throwing.\"    The moon had risen over the eastern bulge of dark mountain, and now the  valley was flooded with mellow light, and shadows of cottonwoods wavered  against the silver.    Suddenly the clip-clop, clip-clop of hoofs caused Duane to raise his  head and listen. Horses were coming down the road from the head of  the valley. The hour was unusual for riders to come in. Presently the  narrow, moonlit lane was crossed at its far end by black moving objects.  Two horses Duane discerned.    \"It's Bland!\" whispered the woman, grasping Duane with shaking hands.  \"You must run! No, he'd see you. That 'd be worse. It's Bland! I know  his horse's trot.\"    \"But you said he wouldn't mind my calling here,\" protested Duane.  \"Euchre's with me. It'll be all right.\"    \"Maybe so,\" she replied, with visible effort at self-control. Manifestly  she had a great fear of Bland. \"If I could only think!\"    Then she dragged Duane to the door, pushed him in.    \"Euchre, come out with me! Duane, you stay with the girl! I'll tell  Bland you're in love with her. Jen, if you give us away I'll wring your  neck.\"    The swift action and fierce whisper told Duane that Mrs. Bland was  herself again. Duane stepped close to Jennie, who stood near the window.  Neither spoke, but her hands were outstretched to meet his own. They  were small, trembling hands, cold as ice. He held them close, trying to  convey what he felt--that he would protect her. She leaned against him,  and they looked out of the window. Duane felt calm and sure of himself.  His most pronounced feeling besides that for the frightened girl was a  curiosity as to how Mrs. Bland would rise to the occasion. He saw the  riders dismount down the lane and wearily come forward. A boy led away  the horses. Euchre, the old fox, was talking loud and with remarkable  ease, considering what he claimed was his natural cowardice.    \"--that was way back in the sixties, about the time of the war,\" he  was saying. \"Rustlin' cattle wasn't nuthin' then to what it is now. An'  times is rougher these days. This gun-throwin' has come to be a disease.  Men have an itch for the draw same as they used to have fer poker. The  only real gambler outside of greasers we ever had here was Bill, an' I  presume Bill is burnin' now.\"    The approaching outlaws, hearing voices, halted a rod or so from the  porch. Then Mrs. Bland uttered an exclamation, ostensibly meant to  express surprise, and hurried out to meet them. She greeted her husband  warmly and gave welcome to the other man. Duane could not see well  enough in the shadow to recognize Bland's companion, but he believed it  was Alloway.    \"Dog-tired we are and starved,\" said Bland, heavily. \"Who's here with  you?\"    \"That's Euchre on the porch. Duane is inside at the window with Jen,\"  replied Mrs. Bland.    \"Duane!\" he exclaimed. Then he whispered low--something Duane could not  catch.    \"Why, I asked him to come,\" said the chief's wife. She spoke easily and  naturally and made no change in tone. \"Jen has been ailing. She gets  thinner and whiter every day. Duane came here one day with Euchre, saw  Jen, and went loony over her pretty face, same as all you men. So I let  him come.\"    Bland cursed low and deep under his breath. The other man made a violent  action of some kind and apparently was quieted by a restraining hand.    \"Kate, you let Duane make love to Jennie?\" queried Bland, incredulously.    \"Yes, I did,\" replied the wife, stubbornly. \"Why not? Jen's in love with  him. If he takes her away and marries her she can be a decent woman.\"    Bland kept silent a moment, then his laugh pealed out loud and harsh.    \"Chess, did you get that? Well, by God! what do you think of my wife?\"    \"She's lyin' or she's crazy,\" replied Alloway, and his voice carried an  unpleasant ring.    Mrs. Bland promptly and indignantly told her husband's lieutenant to  keep his mouth shut.    \"Ho, ho, ho!\" rolled out Bland's laugh.    Then he led the way to the porch, his spurs clinking, the weapons he was  carrying rattling, and he flopped down on a bench.    \"How are you, boss?\" asked Euchre.    \"Hello, old man. I'm well, but all in.\"    Alloway slowly walked on to the porch and leaned against the rail.  He answered Euchre's greeting with a nod. Then he stood there a dark,  silent figure.    Mrs. Bland's full voice in eager questioning had a tendency to ease  the situation. Bland replied briefly to her, reporting a remarkably  successful trip.    Duane thought it time to show himself. He had a feeling that Bland and  Alloway would let him go for the moment. They were plainly non-plussed,  and Alloway seemed sullen, brooding. \"Jennie,\" whispered Duane, \"that  was clever of Mrs. Bland. We'll keep up the deception. Any day now be  ready!\"    She pressed close to him, and a barely audible \"Hurry!\" came breathing  into his ear.    \"Good night, Jennie,\" he said, aloud. \"Hope you feel better to-morrow.\"    Then he stepped out into the moonlight and spoke. Bland returned the  greeting, and, though he was not amiable, he did not show resentment.    \"Met Jasper as I rode in,\" said Bland, presently. \"He told me you made  Bill Black mad, and there's liable to be a fight. What did you go off  the handle about?\"    Duane explained the incident. \"I'm sorry I happened to be there,\" he  went on. \"It wasn't my business.\"    \"Scurvy trick that 'd been,\" muttered Bland. \"You did right. All the  same, Duane, I want you to stop quarreling with my men. If you were one  of us--that'd be different. I can't keep my men from fighting. But  I'm not called on to let an outsider hang around my camp and plug my  rustlers.\"    \"I guess I'll have to be"]]]
