S.,\" page 195.]]    The chairman should not only be familiar with parliamentary usage, and  set the example of strict conformity to it, but he should be a    === Page 85 ============================================================    man of executive ability, capable of controlling men; and it should  never be forgotten, that, to control others, it is necessary to control  one's self.  An excited chairman can scarcely fail to cause trouble in a  meeting.    A chairman will often find himself perplexed with the difficulties  attending his position, and in such cases he will do well to heed the  advice of a distinguished writer on parliamentary law, and recollect  that--\"The great purpose of all rules and forms, is to subserve the  will of the assembly, rather than to restrain it; to facilitate, and not  to obstruct, the expression of their deliberate sense.\"    41. Clerk or Secretary [and the Minutes].  The recording officer is  usually called    === Page 86 ============================================================    the \"Clerk\" or \"Secretary,\"* [When there are two secretaries, he is  termed the \"recording secretary,\" and the other one, the \"corresponding  secretary.\"  In many societies the secretary, besides acting as  recording officer, collects the dues of members, and thus becomes to a  certain extent a financial officer.  In most cases the treasurer acts as  banker, only paying on the order of the society, signed by the secretary  alone, or by the president and secretary.  In such cases the secretary  becomes in reality the financial officer of the society, and should make  reports to the society, of funds received and from what sources, and of  the funds expended and for what purposes.  See Sec. 52 for his duties as  financial officer.] and the record of proceedings the \"Minutes.\"  His  desk should be near that of the chairman, and in the absence of the  chairman, (if there is no vice president present) when the hour for  opening the session arrives, it is his duty to call the meeting to  order, and to preside until the election of a chairman pro tem., which  should be done immediately.  He should keep a record of the proceedings,  commencing in a form similar to the following :** [See Clerk and Minutes  in Part II, Sec. 51.]    \"At a regular quarterly meeting of [state the name of the society] held  on the 31st day of March, 1875, at [state the place of meeting], the  President in the chair, the minutes were read by the clerk and  approved.\"  If the regular clerk is absent, insert after the words \"in  the chair,\" the following:  \"The clerk being absent, Robert Smith was  appointed clerk pro tem.    === Page 87 ============================================================    The minutes were then read and approved.\"  If the minutes were not read,  say \"the reading of the minutes was dispensed with.\"  The above form  will show the essentials, which are as follows:  (a) The kind of  meeting, \"regular\" [or stated] or \"special,\" or \"adjourned regular,\"  or \"adjourned special;\" (6) name of the assembly; (c) date and place of  meeting (excepting when the place is always the same); (d) the fact of  the presence of the regular chairman and clerk, or in their absence the  names of their substitutes; (e) whether the minutes of the previous  meeting were approved.    The minutes should be signed by the person who acted as clerk for that  meeting:  in some societies the chairman must also sign them.  When  published, they should be signed by both officers.    In keeping the minutes much depends upon the kind of meeting, and  whether the minutes are to be published.  If they are to be published,  it is often of far more interest to know what was said by the leading  speakers, than to know what routine business was done, and what  resolutions adopted.    === Page 88 ============================================================    In such case the duties of the secretary are arduous, and he should have  at least one assistant.  In ordinary society meetings and meetings of  Boards of Managers and Trustees, on the contrary, there is no object in  reporting the debates; the duty of the clerk, in such cases, is mainly  to record what is \"done\" by the assembly, not what is said by the  members.  Without there is a rule to the contrary, he should enter every  Principal motion [Sec. 6] that is before the assembly, whether it is  adopted or rejected; and where there is a division [see Voting, Sec. 38],  or where the vote is by ballot, he should enter the number of votes on  each side; and when the voting is by yeas and nays [Sec. 38], he should  enter a list of the names of those voting on each side.  He should  endorse on the reports of committees, the date of their reception, and  what further action was taken upon them, and preserve them among the  records, for which he is responsible.  He should in the minutes make a  brief summary of a report that has been agreed to, except where it  contains resolutions, in which case the resolutions will be entered in  full as adopted by the assembly, and not as    === Page 89 ============================================================    if it was the report accepted.  The proceedings of the committee of the  whole [Sec. 32], or while acting informally [Sec. 33], should not be entered  on the minutes.  Before an adjournment without day, it is customary to  read over the minutes for approval, if the next meeting of the board or  society will not occur for a long period.  Where the regular meetings  are not separated by too great a time, the minutes are read at the next  meeting.    The clerk should, previous to each meeting, for the use of the chairman,  make out an order of business [Sec. 44], showing in their exact order what  is necessarily to come before the assembly.  He should also have at each  meeting a list of all standing committees, and such select committees as  are in existence at the time.  When a committee is appointed, he should  hand the names of the committee and all papers referred to it to the  chairman, or some other of its members.    === Page 90 ============================================================    Art. VIII.  Miscellaneous.  [Sec.Sec. 42-45.]    42. A Session of an assembly is a meeting* [See definitions in  Introduction for the distinction between \"meeting\" and \"session.\"]  which, though it may last for days, is virtually one meeting, as a  session of a Convention; or even months, as a session of Congress; it  terminates by an \"adjournment without day.\"  The intermediate  adjournments from day to day, or the recesses taken during the day, do  not destroy the continuity of the meeting--they in reality constitute  one session.  In the case of a permanent society, having regular  meetings every week, month, or year, for example, each meeting  constitutes a separate session of the society, which session however can  be prolonged by adjourning to another day.    If a principal motion [Sec. 6] is indefinitely postponed or rejected at one  session, while it cannot be introduced again at the same session [see  Renewal of a Motion, Sec. 26], it can be at    === Page 91 ============================================================    the next, without it is prohibited by a rule of the assembly.    No one session of the assembly can interfere with the rights of the  assembly at any future session,* [Any one session can adopt a rule or  resolution of a permanent nature, and it continues in force until at  some future session it is rescinded.  But these Standing Rules, as they  are termed, do not interfere with future sessions, because at any moment  a majority can suspend or rescind them, or adopt new ones.] without it  is expressly so provided in their Constitution, Bylaws, or Rules of  Order, all of which are so guarded (by requiring notice of amendments,  and at least a two-thirds vote for their adoption) that they are not  subject to sudden changes, but may be considered as expressing the  deliberate views of the whole society, rather than the opinions or  wishes of any particular meeting.  Thus, if the presiding officer were  ill, it would not be competent for one session of the assembly to elect  a chairman to hold office longer than that session, as it cannot control  or dictate to the next session of the assembly.  By going through the  prescribed routine of an election to fill the vacancy, giving whatever  notice is required, it could then legally elect a chairman to hold  office while the vacancy lasted.  So it    === Page 92 ============================================================    is improper for an assembly to postpone anything to a day beyond the  next succeeding session, and thus attempt to prevent the next session  from considering the question.  On the other hand, it is not permitted  to move a reconsideration [Sec. 27] of a vote taken at a previous session  [though the motion to reconsider can be called up, provided it was made  at the last meeting of the previous session.] Committees can be  appointed to report at a future session.

On the average, nine tenths of each of our crews were  American seamen, and about one twentieth British, the remainder  being a mixture of various nationalities.    On the other hand, it is to be said that the British frigate  _Guerrière_ had ten Americans among her crew, who were permitted  to go below during action, and the _Macedonian_ eight, who were  not allowed that privilege, three of them being killed. Three of  the British sloop _Peacock's_ men were Americans, who were forced  to fight against the _Hornet_: one of them was killed. Two of the  _Epervier's_ men were Americans, who were also forced to fight.  When the crew of the _Nautilus_ was exchanged, a number of other  American prisoners were sent with them; among these were a number  of American seamen who had been serving in the _Shannon_, _Acasta_,  _Africa_, and various other vessels. So there was also a certain  proportion of Americans among the British crews, although forming  a smaller percentage of them than the British did on board the  American ships. In neither case was the number sufficient to at all  affect the result.    The crews of our ships being thus mainly native Americans, it may  be interesting to try to find out the proportions that were  furnished by the different sections of the country. There is not  much difficulty about the officers. The captains, masters commandant,  lieutenants, marine officers, whose birthplaces are given in the  Navy List of 1816,--240 in all,--came from the various States as  follows:                  .- N.H..   5-.                |  Mass.. 20 |  New England  -|  R.I.   11 |- 42                '- Conn..  6-'                  .- N.Y..  17-.                |  N.J..  22 |  Middle States-|  Penn.. 35 |- 78                '- Del..   4-'    District of Columbia -[D.C..  4]- 4                      .- Md..   46-.                  |  Va..   42 |                  |  N.C..   4 |  Southern States-|  S.C..  16 |-116                  |  Ga..    2 |                  |  La..    4 |                  '- Ky..    2-'                                 ---------  Total of given birthplaces      240      Thus, Maryland furnished, both absolutely and proportionately, the  greatest number of officers, Virginia, then the most populous of  all the States, coming next; four fifths of the remainder came  from the Northern States.    It is more difficult to get at the birthplaces of the sailors.  Something can be inferred from the number of privateers and letters  of marque fitted out. Here Baltimore again headed the list; following  closely came New York, Philadelphia, and the New England coast  towns, with, alone among the Southern ports, Charleston, S.C. A  more accurate idea of the quotas of sailors furnished by the  different sections can be arrived at by comparing the total amount  of tonnage the country possessed at the outbreak of the war.  Speaking roughly, 44 per cent, of it belonged to New England, 32  per cent, to the Middle States, and 11 per cent, to Maryland. This  makes it _probable_ (but of course not certain) that three fourths  of the common sailors hailed from the Northern States, half the  remainder from Maryland, and the rest chiefly from Virginia and  South Carolina.    Having thus discussed somewhat at length the character of our  officers and crews, it will now be necessary to present some  statistical tables to give a more accurate idea of the composition  of the navy; the tonnage, complements, and armaments of the ships, etc.    At the beginning of the war the Government possessed six navy-yards  (all but the last established in 1801) as follows: [Footnote: Report  of Naval Secretary Jones, Nov. 30. 1814.]           Place               Original Cost.

Gosport,                      12,000                    16    In 1812 the following was the number of officers in the navy:  [Footnote: \"List of Vessels\" etc., by Gen. H Preble U.S.N (1874)]     12 captains   10 masters commandant   73 lieutenants   53 masters  310 midshipmen   42 marine officers  -----  500    At the opening of the year, the number of seamen, ordinary seamen,  and boys in service was 4,010, and enough more were recruited to  increase it to 5,230, of whom only 2,346 were destined for the  cruising war vessels, the remainder being detailed for forts,  gun-boats, navy yards, the lakes, etc. [Footnote: Report of Secretary  Paul Hamilton, Feb. 21, 1812.] The marine corps was already ample,  consisting of 1,523 men. [Footnote: _Ibid_.]    No regular navy lists were published till 1816, and I have been  able to get very little information respecting the increase in  officers and men during 1813 and 1814; but we have full returns  for 1815, which may be summarized as follows: [Footnote: Seybert's  \"Statistical Annals,\" p. 676 (Philadelphia, 1818)]         30 captains,       25 masters commandant,      141 lieutenants,       24 commanders,      510 midshipmen,      230 sailing-masters,       50 surgeons,       12 chaplains,       50 pursers,       10 coast pilots,       45 captain's clerks,       80 surgeon's mates,      530 boatswains, gunners, carpenters, and sailmakers,      268 boatswain's mates, gunner's mates, etc.,    1,106 quarter gunners, etc.,    5,000 able seamen,    6,849 ordinary seamen and boys.          Making a total of 14,960, with 2,715 marines.  [Footnote: Report of Secretary B. W. Crowninshield, April 18, 1816.]    Comparing this list with the figures given before, it can be seen  that during the course of the war our navy grew enormously,  increasing to between three and four times its original size.    At the beginning of the year 1812, the navy of the United States  on the ocean consisted of the following vessels, which either  were, or could have been, made available during the war.

The two former were condemned hulks; the latter  was entirely rebuilt after the war. The _Hornet_ was originally a  brig of 440 tons, and 18 guns; having been transformed into a ship,  she was pierced for 20 guns, and in size was of an intermediate  grade between the _Wasp_ and the heavy sloops, built somewhat later,  of 509 tons. Her armament consisted of 32-pound carronades, with  the exception of the two bow-guns, which were long 12's. The whole  broadside was in nominal weight just 300 pounds; in actual weight  about 277 pounds. Her complement of men was 140, but during the war  she generally left port with 150. [Footnote: In the _Hornet's_ log  of Oct. 25, 1812, while in port, it is mentioned that she had 158  men; four men who were sick were left behind before she started.  (See, in the Navy Archives, the Log-book, _Hornet_, _Wasp_, and  _Argus_, July 20, 1809, to Oct. 6, 1813.)] The _Wasp_ had been a  ship from the beginning, mounted the number of guns she rated (of  the same calibres as the _Hornet's_) and carried some ten men less.  She was about the same length as the British 18-gun brig-sloop, but,  being narrower, measured nearly 30 tons less. The _Argus_ and _Syren_  were similar and very fine brigs, the former being the longer. Each  carried two more guns than she rated; and the _Argus_, in addition,  had a couple thrust through the bridle-ports. The guns were 24-pound  carronades, with two long 12's for bow-chasers. The proper complement  of men was 100, but each sailed usually with about 125. The four  smaller craft were originally schooners, armed with the same number  of light long guns as they rated, and carrying some 70 men apiece;  but they had been very effectually ruined by being changed into  brigs, with crews increased to a hundred men. Each was armed with  18-pound carronades, carrying two more than she rated. The  _Enterprise_, in fact, mounted 16 guns, having two long nines thrust  through the bridle-ports. These little brigs were slow, not very  seaworthy, and overcrowded with men and guns; they all fell into  the enemy's hands without doing any good whatever, with the single  exception of"]]]
