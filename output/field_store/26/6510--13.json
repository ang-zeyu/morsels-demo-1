He  could differentiate the innumerable species of the herbivora by scent,  and he could tell, too, whether an animal was approaching or departing  merely by the waxing or waning strength of its effluvium.  Nor did he  need the evidence of his eyes to tell him whether there were two lions  or four up wind,--a hundred yards away or half a mile.    Much of this had Akut taught him, but far more was instinctive  knowledge--a species of strange intuition inherited from his father.  He had come to love the jungle life.  The constant battle of wits and  senses against the many deadly foes that lurked by day and by night  along the pathway of the wary and the unwary appealed to the spirit of  adventure which breathes strong in the heart of every red-blooded son  of primordial Adam.  Yet, though he loved it, he had not let his  selfish desires outweigh the sense of duty that had brought him to a  realization of the moral wrong which lay beneath the adventurous  escapade that had brought him to Africa.  His love of father and mother  was strong within him, too strong to permit unalloyed happiness which  was undoubtedly causing them days of sorrow.  And so he held tight to  his determination to find a port upon the coast where he might  communicate with them and receive funds for his return to London.  There he felt sure that he could now persuade his parents to let him  spend at least a portion of his time upon those African estates which  from little careless remarks dropped at home he knew his father  possessed.  That would be something, better at least than a lifetime of  the cramped and cloying restrictions of civilization.    And so he was rather contented than otherwise as he made his way in the  direction of the coast, for while he enjoyed the liberty and the savage  pleasures of the wild his conscience was at the same time clear, for he  knew that he was doing all that lay in his power to return to his  parents.  He rather looked forward, too, to meeting white men  again--creatures of his own kind--for there had been many occasions  upon which he had longed for other companionship than that of the old  ape.  The affair with the blacks still rankled in his heart.  He had  approached them in such innocent good fellowship and with such  childlike assurance of a hospitable welcome that the reception which  had been accorded him had proved a shock to his boyish ideals.  He no  longer looked upon the black man as his brother; but rather as only  another of the innumerable foes of the bloodthirsty jungle--a beast of  prey which walked upon two feet instead of four.    But if the blacks were his enemies there were those in the world who  were not.  There were those who always would welcome him with open  arms; who would accept him as a friend and brother, and with whom he  might find sanctuary from every enemy.  Yes, there were always white  men.  Somewhere along the coast or even in the depths of the jungle  itself there were white men.  To them he would be a welcome visitor.  They would befriend him.  And there were also the great apes--the  friends of his father and of Akut.  How glad they would be to receive  the son of Tarzan of the Apes!  He hoped that he could come upon them  before he found a trading post upon the coast.  He wanted to be able to  tell his father that he had known his old friends of the jungle, that  he had hunted with them, that he had joined with them in their savage  life, and their fierce, primeval ceremonies--the strange ceremonies of  which Akut had tried to tell him.  It cheered him immensely to dwell  upon these happy meetings.  Often he rehearsed the long speech which he  would make to the apes, in which he would tell them of the life of  their former king since he had left them.    At other times he would play at meeting with white men.  Then he would  enjoy their consternation at sight of a naked white boy trapped in the  war togs of a black warrior and roaming the jungle with only a great  ape as his companion.    And so the days passed, and with the traveling and the hunting and the  climbing the boy's muscles developed and his agility increased until  even phlegmatic Akut marvelled at the prowess of his pupil.  And the  boy, realizing his great strength and revelling in it, became careless.  He strode through the jungle, his proud head erect, defying danger.  Where Akut took to the trees at the first scent of Numa, the lad  laughed in the face of the king of beasts and walked boldly past him.  Good fortune was with him for a long time.  The lions he met were  well-fed, perhaps, or the very boldness of the strange creature which  invaded their domain so filled them with surprise that thoughts of  attack were banished from their minds as they stood, round-eyed,  watching his approach and his departure.  Whatever the cause, however,  the fact remains that on many occasions the boy passed within a few  paces of some great lion without arousing more than a warning growl.    But no two lions are necessarily alike in character or temper.  They  differ as greatly as do individuals of the human family.  Because ten  lions act similarly under similar conditions one cannot say that the  eleventh lion will do likewise--the chances are that he will not.  The  lion is a creature of high nervous development.  He thinks, therefore  he reasons.  Having a nervous system and brains he is the possessor of  temperament, which is affected variously by extraneous causes.  One day  the boy met the eleventh lion.  The former was walking across a small  plain upon which grew little clumps of bushes.  Akut was a few yards to  the left of the lad who was the first to discover the presence of Numa.    \"Run, Akut,\" called the boy, laughing.  \"Numa lies hid in the bushes to  my right.  Take to the trees.  Akut!  I, the son of Tarzan, will  protect you,\" and the boy, laughing, kept straight along his way which  led close beside the brush in which Numa lay concealed.    The ape shouted to him to come away, but the lad only flourished his  spear and executed an improvised war dance to show his contempt for the  king of beasts.  Closer and closer to the dread destroyer he came,  until, with a sudden, angry growl, the lion rose from his bed not ten  paces from the youth.  A huge fellow he was, this lord of the jungle  and the desert.  A shaggy mane clothed his shoulders.  Cruel fangs  armed his great jaws.  His yellow-green eyes blazed with hatred and  challenge.    The boy, with his pitifully inadequate spear ready in his hand,  realized quickly that this lion was different from the others he had  met; but he had gone too far now to retreat.  The nearest tree lay  several yards to his left--the lion could be upon him before he had  covered half the distance, and that the beast intended to charge none  could doubt who looked upon him now.  Beyond the lion was a thorn  tree--only a few feet beyond him.  It was the nearest sanctuary but  Numa stood between it and his prey.    The feel of the long spear shaft in his hand and the sight of the tree  beyond the lion gave the lad an idea--a preposterous idea--a  ridiculous, forlorn hope of an idea; but there was no time now to weigh  chances--there was but a single chance, and that was the thorn tree.  If the lion charged it would be too late--the lad must charge first,  and to the astonishment of Akut and none the less of Numa, the boy  leaped swiftly toward the beast.  Just for a second was the lion  motionless with surprise and in that second Jack Clayton put to the  crucial test an accomplishment which he had practiced at school.    Straight for the savage brute he ran, his spear held butt foremost  across his body.  Akut shrieked in terror and amazement.  The lion  stood with wide, round eyes awaiting the attack, ready to rear upon his  hind feet and receive this rash creature with blows that could crush  the skull of a buffalo.    Just in front of the lion the boy placed the butt of his spear upon the  ground, gave a mighty spring, and, before the bewildered beast could  guess the trick that had been played upon him, sailed over the lion's  head into the rending embrace of the thorn tree--safe but lacerated.    Akut had never before seen a pole-vault.  Now he leaped up and down  within the safety of his own tree, screaming taunts and boasts at the  discomfited Numa, while the boy, torn and bleeding, sought some  position in his thorny retreat in which he might find the least agony.  He had saved his life; but at considerable cost in suffering.  It  seemed to him that the lion would never leave, and it was a full hour  before the angry brute gave up his vigil and strode majestically away  across the plain.  When he was at a safe distance the boy extricated  himself from the thorn tree; but not without inflicting new wounds upon  his already tortured flesh.    It was many days before the outward evidence of the lesson he had  learned had left him; while the impression upon his mind was one that  was to remain with him for life.  Never again did he uselessly tempt  fate.    He took long chances often in his after life; but only when the taking  of chances might further the attainment of some cherished end--and,  always thereafter, he practiced pole-vaulting.    For several days the boy and the ape lay up while the former recovered  from the painful wounds inflicted by the sharp thorns.  The great  anthropoid licked the wounds of his human friend, nor, aside from this,  did they receive other treatment, but they soon healed, for healthy  flesh quickly replaces itself.    When the lad felt fit again the two continued their journey toward the  coast, and once more the boy's mind was filled with pleasurable  anticipation.    And at last the much dreamed of moment came.  They were passing through  a tangled forest when the boy's sharp eyes discovered"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/903"],[0,"The White Company (#13)"],[1,"staring about with a vacant gaze, which showed that he knew neither  where he was nor what had occurred to him. Suddenly, however, a flash  of intelligence had come over his sodden features, and he rose and  staggered for the door. \"'Ware the ale!\" he said in a hoarse whisper,  shaking a warning finger at the company. \"Oh, holy Virgin, 'ware the  ale!\" and slapping his hands to his injury, he flitted off into the  darkness, amid a shout of laughter, in which the vanquished joined as  merrily as the victor. The remaining forester and the two laborers  were also ready for the road, and the rest of the company turned to the  blankets which Dame Eliza and the maid had laid out for them upon the  floor. Alleyne, weary with the unwonted excitements of the day, was soon  in a deep slumber broken only by fleeting visions of twittering legs,  cursing beggars, black robbers, and the many strange folk whom he had  met at the \"Pied Merlin.\"        CHAPTER VII. HOW THE THREE COMRADES JOURNEYED THROUGH THE WOODLANDS.      At early dawn the country inn was all alive, for it was rare indeed  that an hour of daylight would be wasted at a time when lighting was so  scarce and dear. Indeed, early as it was when Dame Eliza began to stir,  it seemed that others could be earlier still, for the door was ajar,  and the learned student of Cambridge had taken himself off, with a  mind which was too intent upon the high things of antiquity to stoop  to consider the four-pence which he owed for bed and board. It was the  shrill out-cry of the landlady when she found her loss, and the clucking  of the hens, which had streamed in through the open door, that first  broke in upon the slumbers of the tired wayfarers.    Once afoot, it was not long before the company began to disperse. A  sleek mule with red trappings was brought round from some neighboring  shed for the physician, and he ambled away with much dignity upon his  road to Southampton. The tooth-drawer and the gleeman called for a cup  of small ale apiece, and started off together for Ringwood fair, the old  jongleur looking very yellow in the eye and swollen in the face after  his overnight potations. The archer, however, who had drunk more than  any man in the room, was as merry as a grig, and having kissed the  matron and chased the maid up the ladder once more, he went out to the  brook, and came back with the water dripping from his face and hair.    \"Hola! my man of peace,\" he cried to Alleyne, \"whither are you bent this  morning?\"    \"To Minstead,\" quoth he. \"My brother Simon Edricson is socman there, and  I go to bide with him for a while. I prythee, let me have my score, good  dame.\"    \"Score, indeed!\" cried she, standing with upraised hands in front of the  panel on which Alleyne had worked the night before. \"Say, rather what  it is that I owe to thee, good youth. Aye, this is indeed a pied merlin,  and with a leveret under its claws, as I am a living woman. By the rood  of Waltham! but thy touch is deft and dainty.\"    \"And see the red eye of it!\" cried the maid.    \"Aye, and the open beak.\"    \"And the ruffled wing,\" added Hordle John.    \"By my hilt!\" cried the archer, \"it is the very bird itself.\"    The young clerk flushed with pleasure at this chorus of praise, rude and  indiscriminate indeed, and yet so much heartier and less grudging than  any which he had ever heard from the critical brother Jerome, or the  short-spoken Abbot. There was, it would seem, great kindness as well as  great wickedness in this world, of which he had heard so little that was  good. His hostess would hear nothing of his paying either for bed or  for board, while the archer and Hordle John placed a hand upon either  shoulder and led him off to the board, where some smoking fish, a dish  of spinach, and a jug of milk were laid out for their breakfast.    \"I should not be surprised to learn, mon camarade,\" said the soldier, as  he heaped a slice of fish upon Alleyne's tranchoir of bread, \"that you  could read written things, since you are so ready with your brushes and  pigments.\"    \"It would be shame to the good brothers of Beaulieu if I could not,\" he  answered, \"seeing that I have been their clerk this ten years back.\"    The bowman looked at him with great respect. \"Think of that!\" said he.  \"And you with not a hair to your face, and a skin like a girl. I can  shoot three hundred and fifty paces with my little popper there, and  four hundred and twenty with the great war-bow; yet I can make nothing  of this, nor read my own name if you were to set 'Sam Aylward' up  against me. In the whole Company there was only one man who could read,  and he fell down a well at the taking of Ventadour, which proves that  the thing is not suited to a soldier, though most needful to a clerk.\"    \"I can make some show at it,\" said big John; \"though I was scarce long  enough among the monks to catch the whole trick of it.    \"Here, then, is something to try upon,\" quoth the archer, pulling a  square of parchment from the inside of his tunic. It was tied securely  with a broad band of purple silk, and firmly sealed at either end with a  large red seal. John pored long and earnestly over the inscription upon  the back, with his brows bent as one who bears up against great mental  strain.    \"Not having read much of late,\" he said, \"I am loth to say too much  about what this may be. Some might say one thing and some another, just  as one bowman loves the yew, and a second will not shoot save with the  ash. To me, by the length and the look of it, I should judge this to be  a verse from one of the Psalms.\"    The bowman shook his head. \"It is scarce likely,\" he said, \"that Sir  Claude Latour should send me all the way across seas with nought more  weighty than a psalm-verse. You have clean overshot the butts this time,  mon camarade. Give it to the little one. I will wager my feather-bed  that he makes more sense of it.\"    \"Why, it is written in the French tongue,\" said Alleyne, \"and in a  right clerkly hand. This is how it runs: 'A le moult puissant et moult  honorable chevalier, Sir Nigel Loring de Christchurch, de son tres  fidele ami Sir Claude Latour, capitaine de la Compagnie blanche,  chatelain de Biscar, grand seigneur de Montchateau, vavaseur de le  renomme Gaston, Comte de Foix, tenant les droits de la haute justice, de  la milieu, et de la basse.' Which signifies in our speech: 'To the very  powerful and very honorable knight, Sir Nigel Loring of Christchurch,  from his very faithful friend Sir Claude Latour, captain of the White  Company, chatelain of Biscar, grand lord of Montchateau and vassal to  the renowned Gaston, Count of Foix, who holds the rights of the high  justice, the middle and the low.'\"    \"Look at that now!\" cried the bowman in triumph. \"That is just what he  would have said.\"    \"I can see now that it is even so,\" said John, examining the parchment  again. \"Though I scarce understand this high, middle and low.\"    \"By my hilt! you would understand it if you were Jacques Bonhomme. The  low justice means that you may fleece him, and the middle that you may  torture him, and the high that you may slay him. That is about the truth  of it. But this is the letter which I am to take; and since the platter  is clean it is time that we trussed up and were afoot. You come with  me, mon gros Jean; and as to you, little one, where did you say that you  journeyed?\"    \"To Minstead.\"    \"Ah, yes. I know this forest country well, though I was born myself  in the Hundred of Easebourne, in the Rape of Chichester, hard by the  village of Midhurst. Yet I have not a word to say against the Hampton  men, for there are no better comrades or truer archers in the whole  Company than some who learned to loose the string in these very parts.  We shall travel round with you to Minstead lad, seeing that it is little  out of our way.\"    \"I am ready,\" said Alleyne, right pleased at the thought of such company  upon the road.    \"So am not I. I must store my plunder at this inn, since the hostess is  an honest woman. Hola! ma cherie, I wish to leave with you my gold-work,  my velvet, my silk, my feather bed, my incense-boat, my ewer, my naping  linen, and all the rest of it. I take only the money in a linen bag,  and the box of rose colored sugar which is a gift from my captain to the  Lady Loring. Wilt guard my treasure for me?\"    \"It shall be put in the safest loft, good archer. Come when you may, you  shall find it ready for you.\"    \"Now, there is a true friend!\" cried the bowman, taking her hand. \"There  is a bonne amie! English land and English women, say I, and French wine  and French plunder. I shall be back anon, mon ange. I am a lonely man,  my sweeting, and I must settle some day when the wars are over and done.  Mayhap you and I----Ah, mechante, mechante! There is la petite peeping  from behind the door. Now, John, the sun is over the trees; you must be  brisker than this when the bugleman blows 'Bows and Bills.'\"    \"I have been waiting this time back,\" said Hordle John gruffly.    \"Then we must be off. Adieu, ma vie! The two livres shall settle the  score and buy some ribbons against the next kermesse. Do not forget Sam  Aylward, for his heart shall ever be thine alone--and thine, ma petite!  So, marchons, and may St. Julian grant us as good quarters elsewhere!\"    The sun had risen over Ashurst and Denny woods, and was shining  brightly, though the eastern wind had a sharp flavor to it, and the  leaves were flickering thickly from the trees. In the High Street of  Lyndhurst the wayfarers had to pick their way, for the little town  was crowded with the guardsmen, grooms, and yeomen prickers who were  attached to the King's hunt. The King himself was staying at Castle  Malwood, but several of his suite had been compelled to seek such  quarters as they might find in the wooden or wattle-and-daub cottages of  the village. Here and there a small escutcheon, peeping from a  glassless window, "]]]
