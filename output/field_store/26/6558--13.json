[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10586"],[0,"Mike and Psmith (#14)"],[1,"listened to a  great deal of incoherent conversation from Jellicoe, and a painfully  vivid recollection of handing over the bulk of his worldly wealth to  him. The thought depressed him, though it seemed to please Jellicoe, for  the latter caroled in a gay undertone as he dressed, till Psmith, who  had a sensitive ear, asked as a favor that these farmyard imitations  might cease until he was out of the room.    There were other things to make Mike low-spirited that morning. To begin  with, he was in detention, which in itself is enough to spoil a day. It  was a particularly fine day, which made the matter worse. In addition to  this, he had never felt stiffer in his life. It seemed to him that the  creaking of his joints as he walked must be audible to everyone within a  radius of several yards. Finally, there was the interview with Mr.  Downing to come. That would probably be unpleasant. As Psmith had said,  Mr. Downing was the sort of master who would be likely to make trouble.  The great match had not been an ordinary match. Mr. Downing was a  curious man in many ways, but he did not make a fuss on ordinary  occasions when his bowling proved expensive. Yesterday's performance,  however, stood in a class by itself. It stood forth without disguise as  a deliberate rag. One side does not keep another in the field the whole  day in a one-day match except as a grisly kind of practical joke. And  Mr. Downing and his house realized this. The house's way of signifying  its comprehension of the fact was to be cold and distant as far as the  seniors were concerned, and abusive and pugnacious as regards the  juniors. Young blood had been shed overnight, and more flowed during the  eleven-o'-clock interval that morning to avenge the insult.    Mr. Downing's methods of retaliation would have to be, of necessity,  more elusive; but Mike did not doubt that in some way or other his form  master would endeavor to get a bit of his own back.    As events turned out, he was perfectly right. When a master has got his  knife into a boy, especially a master who allows himself to be  influenced by his likes and dislikes, he is inclined to single him out  in times of stress, and savage him as if he were the official  representative of the evildoers. Just as, at sea, the skipper when he  has trouble with the crew, works it off on the boy.    Mr. Downing was in a sarcastic mood when he met Mike. That is to say, he  began in a sarcastic strain. But this sort of thing is difficult to keep  up. By the time he had reached his peroration, the rapier had given  place to the bludgeon. For sarcasm to be effective, the user of it must  be met halfway. His hearer must appear to be conscious of the sarcasm  and moved by it. Mike, when masters waxed sarcastic toward him, always  assumed an air of stolid stupidity, which was as a suit of mail  against satire.    So Mr. Downing came down from the heights with a run, and began to  express himself with a simple strength which it did his form good to  listen to. Veterans who had been in the form for terms said afterward  that there had been nothing to touch it, in their experience of the  orator, since the glorious day when Dunster, that prince of raggers, who  had left at Christmas to go to a crammer's, had introduced three lively  grass snakes into the room during a Latin lesson.    \"You are surrounded,\" concluded Mr. Downing, snapping his pencil in two  in his emotion, \"by an impenetrable mass of conceit and vanity and  selfishness. It does not occur to you to admit your capabilities as a  cricketer in an open, straightforward way and place them at the disposal  of the school. No, that would not be dramatic enough for you. It would  be too commonplace altogether. Far too commonplace!\" Mr. Downing laughed  bitterly. \"No, you must conceal your capabilities. You must act a lie.  You must--who is that shuffling his feet? I will not have it, I _will_  have silence--you must hang back in order to make a more effective  entrance, like some wretched actor who--I will _not_ have this  shuffling. I have spoken of this before. Macpherson, are you shuffling  your feet?\"    \"Sir, no, sir.\"    \"Please, sir.\"    \"Well, Parsons?\"    \"I think it's the noise of the draft under the door, sir.\"    Instant departure of Parsons for the outer regions. And, in the  excitement of this side issue, the speaker lost his inspiration, and  abruptly concluded his remarks by putting Mike on to translate in  Cicero. Which Mike, who happened to have prepared the first half-page,  did with much success.    The Old Boys' match was timed to begin shortly after eleven o'clock.  During the interval most of the school walked across the field to look  at the pitch. One or two of the Old Boys had already changed and were  practicing in front of the pavilion.    It was through one of these batsmen that an accident occurred which had  a good deal of influence on Mike's affairs.    Mike had strolled out by himself. Halfway across the field Jellicoe  joined him. Jellicoe was cheerful, and rather embarrassingly grateful.  He was just in the middle of his harangue when the accident happened.    To their left, as they crossed the field, a long youth, with the faint  beginnings of a moustache and a blazer that lit up the surrounding  landscape like a glowing beacon, was lashing out recklessly at a  friend's bowling. Already he had gone within an ace of slaying a small  boy. As Mike and Jellicoe proceeded on their way, there was a shout  of \"Heads!\"    The almost universal habit of batsmen of shouting \"Heads!\" at whatever  height from the ground the ball may be, is not a little confusing. The  average person, on hearing the shout, puts his hands over his skull,  crouches down and trusts to luck. This is an excellent plan if the ball  is falling, but is not much protection against a skimming drive along  the ground.    When \"Heads!\" was called on the present occasion, Mike and Jellicoe  instantly assumed the crouching attitude.    Jellicoe was the first to abandon it. He uttered a yell and sprang into  the air. After which he sat down and began to nurse his ankle.    The bright-blazered youth walked up.    \"Awfully sorry, you know. Hurt?\"    Jellicoe was pressing the injured spot tenderly with his fingertips,  uttering sharp howls whenever, zeal outrunning discretion, he prodded  himself too energetically.    \"Silly ass, Dunster,\" he groaned, \"slamming about like that.\"    \"Awfully sorry. But I did yell.\"    \"It's swelling up rather,\" said Mike. \"You'd better get over to the  house and have it looked at. Can you walk?\"    Jellicoe tried, but sat down again with a loud \"Ow!\" At that moment the  bell rang.    \"I shall have to be going in,\" said Mike, \"or I'd have helped you over.\"    \"I'll give you a hand,\" said Dunster.    He helped the sufferer to his feet and they staggered off together,  Jellicoe hopping, Dunster advancing with a sort of polka step. Mike  watched them start and then turned to go in.        14    MIKE RECEIVES A COMMISSION      There is only one thing to be said in favor of detention on a fine  summer's afternoon, and that is that it is very pleasant to come out of.  The sun never seems so bright or the turf so green as during the first  five minutes after one has come out of the detention room. One feels as  if one were entering a new and very delightful world. There is also a  touch of the Rip van Winkle feeling. Everything seems to have gone on  and left one behind. Mike, as he walked to the cricket field, felt very  much behind the times.    Arriving on the field he found the Old Boys batting. He stopped and  watched an over of Adair's. The fifth ball bowled a man. Mike made his  way toward the pavilion.    Before he got there he heard his name called, and turning, found Psmith  seated under a tree with the bright-blazered Dunster.    \"Return of the exile,\" said Psmith. \"A joyful occasion tinged with  melancholy. Have a cherry?--take one or two. These little acts of  unremembered kindness are what one needs after a couple of hours in  extra pupil room. Restore your tissues, Comrade Jackson, and when you  have finished those, apply again.\"    \"Is your name Jackson?\" inquired Dunster, \"because Jellicoe wants to see  you.\"    \"Alas, poor Jellicoe!\" said Psmith. \"He is now prone on his bed in the  dormitory--there a sheer hulk lies poor Tom Jellicoe, the darling of the  crew, faithful below he did his duty, but Comrade Dunster has broached  him to. I have just been hearing the melancholy details.\"    \"Old Smith and I,\" said Dunster, \"were at prep school together. I'd no  idea I should find him here.\"    \"It was a wonderfully stirring sight when we met,\" said Psmith; \"not  unlike the meeting of Ulysses and the hound Argos, of whom you have  doubtless read in the course of your dabblings in the classics. I was  Ulysses; Dunster gave a lifelike representation of the faithful dawg.\"    \"You still jaw as much as ever, I notice,\" said the animal delineator,  fondling the beginnings of his moustache.    \"More,\" sighed Psmith, \"more. Is anything irritating you?\" he added,  eyeing the other's maneuvers with interest.    \"You needn't be a funny ass, man,\" said Dunster, pained; \"heaps of  people tell me I ought to have it waxed.\"    \"What it really wants is top-dressing with guano. Hello! another man  out. Adair's bowling better today than he did yesterday.\"    \"I heard about yesterday,\" said Dunster. \"It must have been a rag!  Couldn't we work off some other rag on somebody before I go? I shall be  stopping here till Monday in the village. Well hit, sir--Adair's bowling  is perfectly simple if you go out to it.\"    \"Comrade Dunster went out to it first ball,\" said Psmith to Mike.    \"Oh! chuck it, man; the sun was in my eyes. I hear Adair's got a match  on with the M.C.C. at last.\"    \"Has he?\" said Psmith; \"I hadn't heard. Archaeology claims so much of my  time that I have little leisure for listening to cricket chitchat.\"    \"What"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10598"],[0,"The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland (1753) Volume I.

But to return to Ferrars.    In our author's history of the reign of Queen Mary, tho' he shews  himself a great admirer of the personal virtues of that Princess, and  a very discerning and able historian, yet it is every where evident  that he was attached to the protestant interest; but more especially  in the learned account he gives of Archbishop Cranmer's death, and  Sir Thomas Wyat's insurrection[8]. The works of this author which are  printed in the Mirror of Magistrates, are as follow;      The Fall of Robert Tresilian, Chief Justice of    England, for misconstruing the laws, and expounding    them to serve the prince's affections.      The Tragedy, or unlawful murther of Thomas    of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester.      The Tragedy of Richard II.      The Story of Dame Eleanor Cobham, Duchess    of Gloucester.      The Story of Humphry Plantagenet, Duke of    Gloucester, Protector of England.      The Tragedy of Edmund Duke of Somerset.      Among these the Complaints of Eleanor Cobham, Duchess of Gloucester,  who was banished for consulting Conjurers and Fortune-tellers about  the Life of King Henry VI. and whose exile quickly made way for the  murder of her husband, has of all his compositions been most admired;  and from this I shall quote a few lines which that Lady speaks.      The Isle of Man was the appointed place,    To penance me for ever in exile;      Thither in haste, they posted me apace,    And doubting 'scape, they pined me in a pyle,    Close by myself; in care alas the while.    There felt I first poor prisoner's hungry fare,    Much want, things skant, and stone walls, hard and bare.      The chaunge was straunge from silke and cloth of gold    To rugged fryze, my carcass for to cloath;    From prince's fare, and dainties hot and cold,    To rotten fish, and meats that one would loath:    The diet and dressing were much alike boath:    Bedding and lodging were all alike fine,    Such down it was as served well for swyne.

This great ornament to human nature, to literature, and to Britain,  was the son of Sir Henry Sidney, knight of the Garter, and three times  Lord Deputy of Ireland, and of lady Mary Dudley, daughter to the duke  of Northumberland, and nephew to that great favourite, Robert, earl of  Leicester.    Oxford had the honour of his education, under the tuition of Dr.  Thomas Thornton, canon of Christ Church. At the university he remained  till he was 17 years of age, and in June 1572 set out on his travels.  On the 24th of August following, when the massacre fell out at Paris,  he was then there, [1] and with other Englishmen took shelter in Sir  Francis Walsingham's house, her Majesty's ambassador at that court.  When this storm subsided, he departed from Paris, went through  Lorrain, and by Strasburgh and Heydelburgh, to Francfort, in September  or October following; where he settled for some time, and was  entertained, agent for the duke of Saxony. At his return, her Majesty  was one of the first who distinguished his great abilities, and, as  proud of so rich a treasure, she sent him ambassador to Rodolph the  emperor, to condole him on the death of Maximilian, and also to other  princes of Germany. The next year, 1577, he went to the court of that  gallant prince Don John de Austria, Viceroy in the low countries for  the king of Spain. Don John was the proudest man in his time;  haughty and imperious in his behaviour, and always used the foreign  ambassadors, who came to his court, with unsufferable insolence and  superiority: At first he paid but little respect to Sidney on account  of his youth, and seeming inexperience; but having had occasion to  hear him talk, and give some account of the manners of every court  where he had been, he was so struck with his vivacity, the propriety  of his observations, and the lustre of his parts, that he ever  afterwards used him with familiarity, and paid him more respect in his  private character, than he did to any ambassador from whatever court.  Some years after this, Wood observes, that in a book called Cabala, he  set forth his reasons why the marriage of the queen with the duke of  Anjou was disadvantageous to the nation. This address was written at  the desire of the earl of Leicester, his uncle; upon which, a quarrel  happened between him and the earl of Oxford, which perhaps occasioned  his retirement from court for two years, when he wrote that renowned  romance called Arcadia. We find him again in high favour, when the  treaty of marriage was renewed; he was engaged with Sir Fulk Greville  in tilting, for the diversion of the court; and at the departure of  the duke of Anjou from England, he attended him to Antwerp [2].    On the 8th of January, 1582, he received the honour of knighthood  from the queen; and in the beginning of the year 1585, he designed an  expedition with Sir Francis Drake into America; but being hindered by  the Queen, who thought the court would be deficient without him, he  was made Governor of Flushing, (about that time delivered to the Queen  for one of the cautionary-towns) and General of the Horse. In both  these places of important trust, his behaviour in point of prudence  and valour was irreproachable, and gained additional honour to his  country, especially when in July 1586 he surprized Axil, and preserved  the lives and reputation of the English army, at the enterprise of  Gravelin. About that time he was in election for the crown of Poland,  but the queen refused to promote this his glorious advancement, not  from jealousy, but from the fear of losing the jewel of her times. He  united the statesman, the scholar and the soldier; and as by the one,  he purchased fame and honour in his life, so by the other, he has  acquired immortality after death.    In the year 1586, when that unfortunate stand was made against the  Spaniards before Zutphen, the 22d of September, when he was getting  upon the third horse, having had two slain under him before, he was  wounded with a musket-shot out of the trenches, which broke the bone  of his thigh. The horse he rode upon was rather furiously choleric,  than bravely proud, so forced him to forsake the field, but not his  back, as the noblest and fittest bier (says lord Brook) to carry a  martial commander to his grave. In this progress, passing along by the  rest of the army where his uncle the [3] General was, and being faint  with excess of bleeding, he called for drink, which was presently  brought him; but as he was putting the bottle to his mouth, he saw a  poor soldier carried along, who had been wounded at the same time,  wishfully cast up his eyes at the bottle; whereupon Sir Philip took it  from his own mouth before he drank, and delivered it to the poor man,  with these words, \"thy necessity is yet greater than mine;\" and when  he had assisted this poor soldier and fellow sufferer, as he called  him, he was presently carried to Arnheim, where the principal surgeons  of the camp attended him.    This generous behaviour of our gallant knight, ought not to pass  without a panegyric. All his deeds of bravery, his politeness, his  learning, and courtly accomplishments, do not reflect so much  honour upon him, as this one disinterested, truly heroic action: It  discovered so tender and benevolent a nature; a mind so fortified  against pain; a heart so overflowing with generous sentiments, to  relieve, in opposition to the violent call of his own necessities, a  poor man languishing in the same distress, before himself, that as  none can read it without the highest admiration of the wounded hero,  so none I hope will think me extravagant in thus endeavouring to extol  it. Bravery is often constitutional; fame may be the motive to feats  of arms, a statesman and a courtier may act from interest; but a  sacrifice so generous as this, can be made by none but those who  are good as well as great, who are noble-minded, and gloriously  compassionate, like Sidney.    When the surgeons began to dress his wound, he told them, that while  his strength was yet entire, his body free from a fever, and his mind  able to endure, they might freely use their art; cut and search to the  bottom; but if they should neglect their art, and renew torments in  the declination of nature, their ignorance, or over-tenderness would  prove a kind of tyranny to their friend, and reflect no honour upon  themselves.    For some time they had great hopes of his recovery; and so zealous  were they to promote it, and overjoyed at its seeming approach, that  they spread the report of it, which soon reached London, and diffused  the most general joy at Court that ever was known.    At the same time count Hollock was under the care of a most excellent  surgeon, for a wound in his throat by a musket shot; yet he neglected  his own extremity to save his friend, and for that purpose sent him to  Sir Philip. This surgeon notwithstanding, out of love to his master,  returning one day to dress his wound, the count cheerfully asked him  how Sir Philip did? he answered with a dejected look, that he was not  well: At these words the count, as having more sense of his friend's  wound than his own, cried out, \"Away villain, never see my face again  till you bring better news of that"]]]
