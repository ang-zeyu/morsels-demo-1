The railroad from Montlucon to Eygurande, which is being constructed by  the state engineers, crosses the valley of the Tardes in the environs of  Evaux (Creuse).    At the spot selected for the establishment of the viaduct the gauge is  deep and steep. The line passes at 300 feet above the river, and the total  length of the metallic superstructure had to be 822 feet. To support this  there was built upon the right bank a pier 158 feet in height, and, upon  the left, another one of 196 feet. The superstructure had been completed,  and a portion of it had already been swung into position, when a violent,  gale occurred and blew it to the bottom of the gorge. At the time of the  accident the superstructure projected 174 feet beyond the pier on the  right bank, and had to advance but 121 feet to reach the 33 foot  scaffolding that had been established upon the other pier.    It blows often and violently in this region. For example, a gale on the  20th of February, 1879, caused great damage, and, among other things, blew  the rear cars of a hay train from the top of the Louvoux viaduct to the  Bouble.    The superstructure of the Tardes viaduct had already withstood the tempest  of the 23d and the 24th of January, 1884, and neither any alteration in  its direction nor any change in the parts that held it upon the pile could  be perceived. But on the night of January 26-27 the storm doubled in  violence, and the work was precipitated into the ravine. No one was  witness of the fall, and the noise was perceived only by the occupants of  the mill located below the viaduct.    The workmen of the enterprise, who lived about 325 feet above this mill  and about 650 feet from the south abutment, heard nothing of it, the wind  having carried the noise in an opposite direction. It was not until  morning that they learned of the destruction of their work and the extent  of the disaster.    One hundred and sixty-nine feet of the superstructure, weighing 450 tons,  had been precipitated from a height of nearly 200 feet and been broken up  on the rock at 45 feet from the axis of the pier. The breakage had  occurred upon the abutment, and the part 195 feet in length that remained  in position in the cutting was strongly wedged between walls of rock,  which had kept this portion in place and prevented its following the other  into the ravine.    Upon the pier there remained a few broken pieces and a portion of the  apparatus used in swinging the superstructure into place.    Below, in the debris of the superstructure, the up-stream girder lay upon  the down-stream one. The annexed engraving shows the state of things after  the disaster.    Several opinions have been expressed in regard to the cause of the fall.  According to one of these, the superstructure was suddenly wrenched from  its bearings upon the pier, and was horizontally displaced by an impulse  such that, when it touched the masonry, its up-stream girder struck the  center of the pier, upon which it divided, while the down-stream one was  already in space. The fall would have afterward continued without the  superstructure meeting the face of the pier.    [Illustration: DESTRUCTION OF THE TARDES VIADUCT.]    Upon taking as a basis the horizontal displacement of the superstructure,  which was 45 meters to the right of the pier, and upon combining the  horizontal stress that produced it with that of the loads, the stress  exerted upon the body may he deduced. But this hypothesis seems to us  scarcely tenable, especially by reason of the great stress that it would  have taken to lift the superstructure. On another hand, it was possible  for the latter to slide over one edge of the pier, and this explains the  horizontal distance of 45 feet by which its center of gravity was  displaced. It is probable, moreover, that the superstructure, before  going over, moved laterally upon its temporary supports.    The girders were, in fact, resting upon rollers, and the roller apparatus  themselves were renting upon wedges, and there was no anchorage to prevent  a transverse sliding.    Under the prolonged thrust of a very high wind, the superstructure, by  reason of its considerable projection, must have begun to swing like a  pendulum. These oscillations acquired sufficient amplitude to cause the  superstructure to gradually move upon its rollers until the latter no  longer bore beneath the webs. The flanges therefore finally bent upward  where they rested upon the rollers, through the action of the weight which  they had to support, and the entire superstructure slid off into space.    An examination of the bent pieces seems to give great value to this  hypothesis.--_Le Genie Civil_.           *       *       *       *       *          JOY'S REVERSING AND EXPANSION VALVE GEAR.    [Footnote: A paper read before the Mechanical Section of the British  Association, at Montreal, August, 1884.]      Four years ago, in August, 1880, a paper was read on this subject before  the Annual Summer Meeting of the Mechanical Engineers' Society of Great  Britain, then held in Barrow-in-Furness, describing this valve motion and  its functions, which was then comparatively new. It was, however,  illustrated by its application to a large express goods (freight) engine,  built by the London and North-Western Railway Company (England) specially  to test the advantages and the endurance of the gear. This engine had  cylinders of 18 inches in diameter and 24 inch stroke, and six wheels  coupled 5 feet 1 inch diameter, and was designed by Mr. Webb, the  Company's chief engineer, for their heavy fast goods traffic on the main  line. The engine has been running this class of traffic ever since. In  January, 1884, it was passed through the repair shops for a general  overhauling, when it was found that the valve motion was in such good  condition as to be put back on the engine without any repairs.    The main object of this present paper is to deal with the advantages of  the valve gear and its application to various classes of engines both on  land and at sea, and with the results of such applications, rather than  treating it as a novelty, to give an exhaustive description of its  construction and functions, which was done in the paper above referred to.  A very short description of its action and main features will, however,  be necessary to the completeness of the paper, and as a basis from which  the improved results to be recorded should necessarily be shown to spring.    The essential feature of this valve gear is that movement for the valve is  produced by a combination of two motions at right angles to each other;  and by the various proportions in which these are combined, and by the  positions in which the moving parts are set with regard to each other, it  gives both the reversal of motion and the various degrees of expansion  required. Eccentrics are entirely dispensed with and the time-honored link  gear abandoned, the motion is taken direct from the connecting rod, and by  utilizing independently the backward and forward action of the rod, due to  the reciprocation of the piston, and combining this with the vibrating  action of the rod, a movement results which is suitable to work the valves  of engines, allowing the use of any proportions of lap and lead desired,  and giving an almost mathematically correct \"cut-off\" for both sides of  the piston and for all points of expansion intermediately, as well as a  much quicker action at the points of \"cut-off\" and \"release\" than is given  by a link gear.    The machinery for accomplishing this is both less costly and less  complicated than the ordinary link motion, and is shown in elevation on  cut, which is a view of the complete motion as on the first London and  North-Western locomotive. Here E is the main valve lever, pinned at D to a  link, B, one end of which is fastened to the connecting rod at A, and the  other end maintained in about the vertical by the radius rod, C, which is  fixed at the point, C. The center or fulcrum, F, of the lever, E,  partaking of the vibrating movement of the connecting rod at the point, A,  is carried in a curved slide, J, the radius of which is equal to the  length of the link, G, and the center of which is fixed to be concentric  with the fulcrum, F, of the lever when the piston is at either extreme end  of its stroke. From the upper end of the lever, E, the motion is carried  direct to the valve by the rod, G. It will be evident thus that by one  revolution of the crank the lower end of the lever, E, will have imparted  to it two different movements, one along the longer axis of the ellipse,  traveled by the point, A, and one through its minor axis up and down,  these movements differing as to time, and corresponding with the part of  the movement of the valve required for lap and lead, and that part  constituting the port opening for admission of steam.    [Illustration: JOY'S REVERSING AND EXPANDING VALVE GEAR.]    The former of these is constant and unalterable, the latter is  controllable by the angle at which the curved slide, J, may be set with  the vertical.    It will further be evident that if the lever, E, were pinned direct to  the connecting rod at the point, A, which passes through a practically  true ellipse, it would vibrate its fulcrum, F, unequally on either side of  the center of the curved slide, J, by the amount of the versed sine of the  arc of the lever, E, from F D; it is to correct this error that the lever,  E, is pinned at the point, D, to a parallel motion formed by the parts, B  and C.

The roof surfaces being one  succession of over-arching curves become receptive of innumerable waves  of light and broad unities of soft shadows, giving the whole an  incomparable quality of tone and low juicy color.    Never use your gold but on curved or undulating surfaces. Flat planes of  gold only give the effect of a monotonous metallic yellow, and can never  be beautiful, owing to the absence of the variations that come with  waves of shadow. By letting out the reins of imagination we might feel  that in this a tenth century Giorgione has given off the mental  impressions of all the golden autumn of his life. His material gave him  an advantage over his great followers of the fifteenth and sixteenth  centuries, insomuch that glass has a living and glowing quality of light  not existing in the somewhat clouded purity of oil or fresco.    In St. Mark's we have an example of the superb treatment in deepest and  most Titianesque scales applied to curved forms, but to find a similarly  complete example of the use of lighter tones and on flat surfaces, we  must turn to Ravenna. I can give you no adequate description of the wall  mosaics of Ravenna. In the sense of delicate color they remind me of  some of the subtile harmonies of many of the finest works of the modern  French school--of the Impressionists and others who combine that quality  with a true instinct for design. In standing before them you feel that  the Dagnan Bouverets, the Mersons, the Cazins, the Puvis de Chavannes,  etc., of the fifth century have had a hand in the conception and  realization of the beautiful compositions to be found on the nave walls  of the two churches of St. Appollinare Nuovo and St. Appollinare in  Classe. Here all the scales are of delicate degrees of light tones,  supreme in their beauty, completeness, and, most important to us, their  true decorative instinct. In the Baptistery we find what I may term a  third essay in color, by weaving in rich, dark, and glowing colors on  figures and bold sinuous forms of ornament in such a skillful and  judicious manner that the whole dome seems to be alive with harmonies,  although they are mostly primaries.    As you know, rules for the disposition of color are futile, yet some  details that struck me as eminently satisfactory may interest you. In  all cases the tesserae are of small dimensions, about a quarter of an  inch square. The stucco joints are large and open, surfaces far from  level, but undulating considerably. The tesserae stick up in parts,  brilliant edges showing. Absence of flatness gives play to the light.  The gray of the stucco joints brings the whole composition together,  serving as cool grays in a picture to give tender unity. Gold, apart  from backgrounds and large surfaces, is used very cleverly in small  pieces in borders of garments, and more especially in thin outlines to  make out the drawing and certain flowing forms of ornament. Brilliant  pieces of glass actually moulded at the kiln into forms of jewels add  brilliancy to crowns, borders, etc. These stick boldly out from the  surface. I noticed in the Baptistery below the springing of the dome a  frieze about 2 ft. 6 in. deep, having the ground entirely in black,  through which was woven in thin gold lines a delicate foliated design.  This, in conjunction with the upper surfaces in dark, rich color, had a  most delightful effect.    We, as students, can learn most from the Ravenna examples, for great are  the needs of light and silvery color in this country, where gray and  gloomy days far outnumber those in which the sun gives liberally of his  light. I may say, in passing, as our subject is really a matter of  decoration, that our nineteenth century efforts in this direction are  all of a somewhat gloomy tendency. We fill our rooms with imitations of  somber Spanish leather, stain and paint our woodwork in leathery and  muddy tones, to arrive at what is now a sort of decorator's god.  Quaintness is the name of that god. Many are the sins for which he has  to answer. Had we not better worship a deity called beauty, whose place  is a little higher up Parnassus? Why should we not in our endeavors  attempt in some measure to transfix the brilliant harmonies that follow  the sun in his liberal and gracious course? This muddy quaintness is  certainly pleasant for brief periods, when lamps are low and fire light  gilds and deepens its parts. Turn the sunlight on these so-called  triumphs of the modern decorator's art, and then you feel the lack of  many a phase of color that might have been borrowed from the thousand  and one examples that in nature he vivifies and makes brilliant.    Referring again to the Ravenna mosaics, I can only add that at the  present day an extended palette of colored glass is available. The  technical difficulties are not great, and there is no question as to the  fine qualities of design and color that are to be obtained in this  material. The great point in this, as in all other schemes of  decoration, is the art, the mental quality of conception, and the sense  of color and fitness. If we hold the precious heritage of an artist's  mind--that divine and rare something which gives form, color, and  completeness to a story, a dream or a vision--then very little  difficulty follows in making vitreous mosaic a valued servant in the  realization of a fine creation.    It is the function of architects to design suitable spaces for color  decoration, so bound in by dignified mouldings and other details of his  constructive art, in such a manner that the addition of decorative color  shall in no way mar the scheme of his complete work, but shall (under  these well ordered distributions) have set on them the seal and crown of  color which is inseparable from a perfect piece of architecture. In such  spaces he may dream his dreams, tell his stories, and stamp on them for  centuries his subtilest and divinest thoughts. May I not urge that to  such spaces must be given the best that is in you? for once placed so  shall they remain unchanged through generations, time being powerless to  add any mellow garment of tone or softening quality whatever.    I mistook the title of the subject in thinking that it was mosaic only,  and at the last moment found it was marble and mosaic. However, the same  dominant principles shall underlie the treatment of marble. It is a  question of the finer instincts for form and color.    In recent years the demand for choice decorative materials has been the  means of opening out many marble quarries all over the world. Transit  being easy, a large scale of varieties is available. One fine addition  is the Mexican onyx. My feeling is that the most beautiful marbles are  those where the soft and sinuous veins melt and die into the general  body, comparatively sharp markings dying right away at the edges into  innumerable gradations. Marbles having strong and hardly marked veins  present great difficulties in distribution. If they are near, they  offend you with their coarseness; and, placed at a distance, the hard  vein lines have very little decorative value. I should say use these in  narrow slips, with very little moulded profile or as parts of intazzio.    Mouldings should be specially designed for different marbles. I should  say mainly on the principle of sudden contrasts; that is, large members  with very little curve bound with members very small in detail, thus  obtaining sharp lines, having little surface to be influenced or  distorted by the veined markings, and serving to sharpen up and give  form to the broader members (which show the color qualities of the  marble), much as you sharpen up an ink drawing by underlining. These  small members serve the architect's purpose for the expression of  vertical and horizontal lines, and where decisive and cutting shadows  are required in the composition of his work.    If delicate carving forms part of your design, I should say statuary is  the best, as you have no veins to distort your detail. I need hardly add  that economy should be studied in using precious marbles, without  injuring the durability of the work. Contours may be built up in thin  sections.    Intazzio is a beautiful form of treating marble on an inexpensive  ground. Gem-like effects may be obtained by inlaying with smaller  pieces, following such ornamental forms as your inventive brains shall  dictate. Perhaps the pockets of your clients will be the chief dictator.    Heraldic emblazonings, inlaid in marble, are highly effective. The  conditions of the heraldry necessitate the use of many varieties, but in  such small quantities that on a large simple field they are rarely out  of harmony. In addition they map out a large and interesting variety  that will save the worry of creation of designs coming entirely from  your own brain, and you know the worry of an architect's life makes him  hail with pleasure at times a rest from the strain of creation. This  heraldic work may be seen to perfection in the chapel of the tombs of  the Medici at Florence.    At the Pitti Palace are some tables which you may know where marble  intazzio can no further go. Alabaster does not appeal to me, it is  somewhat sugary in results. If you are fortunate enough to have a  sculptor who is a sort of nineteenth century Donatello, let him work his  will on statuary or such restful marble.    The celebrated monument in the church of S. Giovanni Paulo, at Venice,  which Ruskin says is the finest monument in the world, if my  recollection serves me correctly, is in white marble, and its beauty  comes entirely"]]]
