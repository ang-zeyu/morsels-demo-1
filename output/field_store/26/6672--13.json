The  penalty is the bot for disobedience. No lord was to dismiss any of  his men who had been accused, until he had made compensation and  done right.    \"No woman or maiden shall be forced to marry a man she dislikes or  given for money.\"    \"Violence to a widow or maiden is punishable by payment of one's  wergeld.\"    No man may have more wives than one.    No man may marry among his own kin within six degrees of  relationship or with the widow of a man as nearly related to him  as that, or with a near relative of his first wife's, or his god-  mother, or a divorced woman. Incest is punishable by payment of  one's wergeld or a fine or forfeiture of all his possessions.    Grounds for divorce were mutual consent or adultery or desertion.  Adultery was prohibited for men as well as for women. The penalty  was payment of a bot or denial of burial in consecrated ground. A  law of Canute provided that if a wife was guilty of adultery, she  forfeited all her property to her husband and her nose and ears,  but this law did not survive him.    Laymen may marry a second time, and a young widow may again take a  husband, but they will not receive a blessing and must do penance  for their incontinence.    Prostitutes were to be driven out of the land or destroyed in the  land, unless they cease from their wickedness and make amends to  the utmost of their ability.    Neither husband nor wife could sell family property without the  other's consent.    If there was a marriage agreement, it determined the wife's  \"dower\", which would be hers upon his death. Otherwise, if a man  who held his land in socage [owned it freely and not subject to a  larger landholder] died before his wife, she got half this  property. If there were minor children, she received all this  property.    Inheritance of land to adult children was by the custom of the  land held. In some places, the custom was for the oldest son to  take it and in other places, the custom was for the youngest son  to take it. Usually, the sons each took an equal portion by  partition, but the eldest son had the right to buy out the others  as to the chief messuage [manor; dwelling and supporting land and  buildings] as long as he compensated them with property of equal  value. If there were no legitimate sons, then each daughter took  an equal share when she married.    In London, one-third of the personal property of a decedent went  to his wife, one-third went to his children in equal shares, and  one-third he could bequeath as he wished.    \"If a man dies intestate [without a will], his lord shall have  heriot [horses, weapons, shields, and helmets] of his property  according to the deceased's rank and [the rest of] the property  shall be divided among his wife, children, and near kinsmen.\"    A man could justifiably kill an adulterer in the act with the  man's wife, daughter, sister, or mother. In Kent, a lord could  fine any bondswoman of his who had become pregnant without his  permission [childwyte].    A man could kill in defense of his own life, the life of his  kinsmen, his lord, or a man whose lord he was. The offender was  \"caught red-handed\" if the blood of his victim was still on him.  Self-help was available for hamsocne [breaking into a man's house  to assault him].    Murder is punished by death as follows: \"If any man break the  King's peace given by hand or seal, so that he slay the man to  whom the peace was given, both his life and lands shall be in the  King's power if he be taken, and if he cannot be taken he shall be  held an outlaw by all, and if anyone shall be able to slay him he  shall have his spoils by law.\" The king's peace usually extended  to important designated individuals, churches, assemblies, those  traveling to courts or assemblies, and particular times and  places. Often a king would extend his peace to fugitives from  violent feuds if they asked the king, earls, and bishops for time  to pay compensation for their misdeeds. From this came the  practice of giving a portion of the \"profits of justice\" to such  men who tried the fugitive. The king's peace came to be extended  to those most vulnerable to violence: foreigners, strangers, and  kinless persons.    \"If anyone by force break or enter any man's court or house to  slay or wound or assault a man, he shall pay 100s. to the King as  fine.\"    \"If anyone slay a man within his court or his house, himself and  all his substance are at the King's will, save the dower of his  wife if he have endowed her.\"    If a person fights and wounds anyone, he is liable for his wer. If  he fells a man to death, he is then an outlaw and is to be seized  by raising the hue and cry. And if anyone kills him for resisting  God's law or the king's, there will be no compensation for his  death.    A man could kill a thief over twelve years in the act of carrying  off his property over 8d., e.g. the thief hand-habbende [a thief  found with the stolen goods in his hand] or the thief back-berend  [a thief found carrying stolen goods on his back].    Cattle theft could be dealt with only by speedy pursuit. A person  who had involuntarily lost possession of cattle is to at once  raise the hue and cry. He was to inform the hundredman, who then  called the tithingmen. All these neighbors had to then follow the  trail of the cow to its taker, or pay 30d. to the hundred for the  first offense, and 60d. for the second offense, half to the  hundred and half to the lord, and half a pound [10s.] for the  third offense, and forfeiture of all his property and declared  outlaw for the fourth offense. If the hundred pursued a track into  another hundred, notice was to be given to that hundredman. If he  did not go with them, he had to pay 30s. to the king.    If a thief was brought into prison, he was to be released after 40  days if he paid his fine of 120s. His kindred could become his  sureties, to pay according to his wer if he stole again. If a  thief forfeited his freedom and gave himself up, but his kindred  forsook him, and he does not know of anyone who will make bot for  him; let him then do theow-work, and let the wer abate for the  kindred.    Measures and weights of goods for sale shall be correct.    Every man shall have a warrantor to his market transactions and no  one shall buy and sell except in a market town; but he shall have  the witness of the portreeve or of other men of credit, who can be  trusted.    Moneyers accused of minting money outside a designated market  were to go to the ordeal of the hot iron with the hand that was  accused of doing the fraud. If he was found guilty, his hand that  did the offense was to be struck off and be set up on the money-  smithy.    No marketing, business, or hunting may be done on Sundays.    No one may bind a freeman, shave his head in derision, or shave  off his beard. Shaving was a sign of enslavement, which could be  incurred by not paying one's fines for offenses committed.    No clergy may gamble or participate in games of chance.    The Laws for London were:    \"1. The gates called Aldersgate and Cripplegate were in charge of      guards.    2.  If a small ship came to Billingsgate, one halfpenny was paid      as toll; if a larger ship with sails, one penny was paid.        1) If a hulk or merchantman arrives and lies there, four pence         is paid as toll.        2) From a ship with a cargo of planks, one plank is given as         toll.        3) On three days of the week toll for cloth [is paid] on Sunday         and Tuesday and Thursday.        4) A merchant who came to the bridge with a boat containing fish         paid one halfpenny as toll, and for a larger ship one penny.\"        5 - 8) Foreigners with wine or blubber fish or other goods and         their tolls.    Foreigners were allowed to buy wool, melted sheep fat [tallow],  and three live pigs for their ships.    \"3. If the town reeve or the village reeve or any other official      accuses anyone of having withheld toll, and the man replies that      he has kept back no toll which it was his legal duty to pay, he      shall swear to this with six others and shall be quit of the      charge.        1) If he declares that he has paid toll, he shall produce the         man to whom he paid it, and shall be quit of the charge.        2) If, however, he cannot produce the man to whom he paid it, he         shall pay the actual toll and as much again and five pounds to         the King.        3) If he vouches the taxgatherer to warranty [asserting] that         he paid toll to him, and the latter denies it, he shall clear         himself by the ordeal and by no other means of proof.    4.  And we [the king and his counselors] have decreed that a man      who, within the town, makes forcible entry into another man's      house without permission and commits a breach of the peace of the      worst kind ... and he who assaults an innocent person on the      King's highway, if he is slain, shall lie in an unhonored grave.        1) If, before demanding justice, he has recourse to violence,         but does not lose his life thereby, he shall pay five pounds         for breach of the King's peace.        2) If he values the goodwill of the town itself, he shall pay         us thirty shillings as compensation, if the King will grant us         this concession.\"    5. No base coin or coin defective in quality or weight, foreign or  English, may be used by a foreigner or an Englishman. (In 956, a  person found guilty of illicit coining was punished by loss of a  hand.)                                 - Judicial Procedure -    There were courts for different geographical communities.

Let the  Universal Power circulate through you.    (b) Place your mind in a reverential state, and meditate upon the  grandeur of the Universal Mind, and open yourself to the inflow of the  Divine Wisdom, which will fill you with illuminating wisdom, and then  let the same flow out from you to your brothers and sisters whom you  love and would help.    This exercise leaves with those who have practiced it a new-found  sense of strength, power and wisdom, and a feeling of spiritual  exaltation and bliss. It must be practiced only in a serious,  reverential mood, and must not be approached triflingly or lightly.      GENERAL DIRECTIONS.    The exercises given in this chapter require the proper mental attitude  and conditions, and the trifler and person of a non-serious nature, or  one without a sense of spirituality and reverence, had better pass  them by, as no results will be obtained by such persons, and besides  it is a wilful trifling with things of a high order, which course  never benefits those who pursue it. These exercises are for the few  who can understand them, and the others will feel no attraction to try  them.    During meditation let the mind dwell upon the ideas given in the  exercise, until it becomes clear to the mind, and gradually manifests  in real consciousness within you. The mind will gradually become  passive and at rest, and the mental image will manifest clearly. Do  not indulge in these exercises too often, and do not allow the  blissful state produced to render you dissatisfied with the affairs of  everyday life, as the latter are useful and necessary for you, and you  must never shirk a lesson, however disagreeable to you it may be. Let  the joy arising from the unfolding consciousness buoy you up and nerve  you for the trials of life, and not make you dissatisfied and  disgusted. All is good, and everything has its place. Many of the  students who practice these exercises will in time wish to know more.  Rest assured that when the time comes we will see that you do not seek  in vain. Go on in courage and confidence, keeping your face toward the  East, from whence comes the rising Sun.    Peace be unto you, and unto all men.    AUM."]]]
