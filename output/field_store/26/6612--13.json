And now,      While the round Moon withdraws his looming disc    Beneath the western sky, the full-blown flower    Of the night-loving lotus[60] sheds her leave    In sorrow for his loss, bequeathing nought    But the sweet memory of her loveliness    To my bereaved sight; e'en as the bride    Disconsolately mourns her absent lord,    And yields her heart a prey to anxious grief.    ANASUYA.                                    [_Entering abruptly_.    Little as I know of the ways of the world, I cannot help thinking  that King Dushyanta is treating [S']akoontala very improperly.    PUPIL.    Well, I must let my revered preceptor know that it is time to  offer the burnt oblation.                                                             [_Exit_.    ANASUYA.    I am broad awake, but what shall I do? I have no energy to go  about my usual occupations. My hands and feet seem to have lost  their power. Well, Love has gained his object; and Love only is  to blame for having induced our dear friend, in the innocence of  her heart, to confide in such a perfidious man. Possibly,  however, the imprecation of Durvasas may he already taking  effect. Indeed, I cannot otherwise account for the King's strange  conduct, in allowing so long a time to elapse without even a  letter; and that, too, after so many promises and protestations.  I cannot think what to do unless we send him the ring which was  to be the token of recognition. But which of these austere  hermits could we ask to be the bearer of it? Then, again, Father  Kanwa has just returned from his pilgrimage; and how am I to  inform him of [S']akoontala's marriage to King Dushyanta, and her  expectation of becoming soon a mother? I never could bring myself  to tell him, even if I felt that [S']akoontala had been in fault,  which she certainly has not. What is to be done?    PRIYAMVADA.                                [_Entering;  joyfully_.    Quick! quick! Anasuya! come and assist in the joyful preparations  for [S']akoontala's departure to her husband's palace.    ANASUYA.    My dear girl, what can you mean?    PRIYAMVADA.    Listen, now, and I will tell you all about it. I went just now to  [S']akoontala, to inquire whether she had slept comfortably--    ANASUYA.    Well, well; go on.    PRIYAMVADA.    She was sitting with her face bowed down to the very ground with  shame, when Father Kanwa entered, and, embracing her, of his own  accord offered her his congratulations. 'I give thee joy, my  child,' he said, 'we have had an auspicious omen. The priest who  offered the oblation dropped it into the very centre of the  sacred fire [81], though thick smoke obstructed his vision.  Henceforth thou wilt cease to be an object of compassion. This  very day I purpose sending thee, under the charge of certain  trusty hermits, to the King's palace; and shall deliver thee into  the hands of thy husband, as I would commit knowledge to the  keeping of a wise and faithful student.'    ANASUYA.    Who, then, informed the holy father of what passed in his  absence?    PRIYAMVADA.    As he was entering the sanctuary of the consecrated fire, an  invisible being chanted a verse in celestial strains.    ANASUYA.                                    [_With astonishment_.    Indeed! pray repeat it.    PRIYAMVADA.                               [_Repeating the verse_.      Glows in thy daughter King Dushyanta's glory,    As in the sacred tree the mystic fire [62];    Let worlds rejoice to hear the welcome story,    And may the son immortalize the sire.    ANASUYA.                                 [_Embracing_ PRIYAMVADA.    Oh, my dear Priyamvada, what delightful news! I am pleased  beyond measure; yet when I think that we are to lose our dear  [S']akoontala this very day, a feeling of melancholy mingles with  my joy.    PRIYAMVADA.    We shall find means of consoling ourselves after her departure.  Let the dear creature only be made happy at any cost.    ANASUYA.    Yes, yes, Priyamvada, it shall be so; and now to prepare the  bridal array. I have always looked forward to this occasion, and  some time since, I deposited a beautiful garland of Ke[S']ara  flowers in a cocoa-nut box, and suspended it on a bough of  yonder mango-tree. Be good enough to stretch out your hand and  take it down, while I compound unguents and perfumes with this  consecrated paste and these blades of sacred grass.    PRIYAMVADA.    Very well.               [_Exit_ ANASUYA. PRIYAMVADA  _takes down the flowers_.    A VOICE BEHIND THE SCENES.    Gautami, bid [S']arngarava and the others hold themselves in  readiness to escort [S']akoontala.    PRIYAMVADA.                                         [_Listening_.    Quick, quick, Anasuya! They are calling the  hermits who are to go with [S']akoontala to Hastinapur[83].    ANASUYA. [_Re-entering with the perfumed unguents in her  hand_.    Come along then, Priyamvada; I am ready to go with you.                                                   [_They walk away_.    PRIYAMVADA.                                           [_Looking_.    See! there sits [S']akoontala, her locks arranged even at this  early hour of the morning. The holy women of the hermitage are  congratulating her, and invoking blessings on her head, while  they present her with wedding-gifts and offerings of consecrated  wild-rice. Let us join them.                                                   [_They approach_.    [S']AKOONTALA _is seen seated, with women surrounding her, occupied  in the manner described_.    FIRST WOMAN.                                  [_To_ [S']AKOONTALA.    My child, may'st thou receive the title of 'Chief-queen,' and may  thy husband delight to honour thee above all others!    SECOND WOMAN.    My child, may'st thou be the mother of a hero!    THIRD WOMAN.    My child, may'st thou be highly honoured by thy lord!    [_Exeunt all the women, excepting_ GAUTAMI, after blessing_  [S']AKOONTALA.    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.                           [_Approaching_.    Dear [S']akoontala, we are come to assist you at your toilet, and  may a blessing attend it!    [S']AKOONTALA.    Welcome, dear friends, welcome. Sit down here.    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.          [_Taking the baskets containing the bridal decorations, and                                                     sitting down_.    Now, then, dearest, prepare to let us dress you. We must first  rub your limbs with these perfumed unguents.    [S']AKOONTALA.    I ought indeed to be grateful for your kind offices, now that I  am so soon to be deprived of them. Dear, dear friends, perhaps I  shall never be dressed by you again.                                                [_Bursts into tears_.    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.    Weep not, dearest; tears are out of season on such a happy  occasion.                  [_They wipe away her tears and begin to dress her_.    PRIYAMVADA.    Alas! these simple flowers and rude ornaments, which our  hermitage offers in abundance, do not set off your beauty as it  deserves.    _Enter TWO YOUNG HERMITS, bearing costly presents_.    BOTH HERMITS.    Here are ornaments suitable for a queen.    [_The women look at them in astonishment_.    GAUTAMI    Why, Narada, my son, whence came these?    FIRST HERMIT.    You owe them to the devotion of Father Kanwa.    GAUTAMI.    Did he create them by the power of his own mind?    SECOND HERMIT.    Certainly not; but you shall hear. The venerable sage ordered us  to collect flowers for [S']akoontala from the forest-trees; and we  went to the wood for that purpose, when      Straightway depending from a neighbouring tree    Appeared a robe of linen tissue, pure    And spotless as a moonbeam--mystic pledge    Of bridal happiness; another tree    Distilled a roseate dye wherewith to stain    The lady's feet [135]; and other branches near    Glistened with rare and costly ornaments.    While, 'mid the leaves, the hands of forest-nymphs,    Vying in beauty with the opening buds,    Presented us with sylvan offerings.    PRIYAMVADA.                            [_Looking at_ [S']AKOONTALA.    The wood-nymphs have done you honour, indeed. This favour  doubtless signifies that you are soon to be received as a happy  wife into your husband's house, and are from this time forward to  become the partner of his royal fortunes.    [[S']AKOONTALA _appears abashed_.    FIRST HERMIT.    Come, Gautama; Father Kanwa has finished his ablutions. Let us go  and inform him of the favour we have received from the deities  who preside over our trees.    SECOND HERMIT.    By all means.                                                           [_Exeunt_.    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA    Alas! what are we to do? We are unused to such splendid  decorations, and are at a loss how to arrange them. Our  knowledge of painting must be our guide. We will dispose the  ornaments as we have seen them in pictures.    [S']AKOONTALA    Whatever pleases you, dear girls, will please me. I have perfect  confidence In your taste.                                       [_They commence dressing her_.    _Enter_ KANWA, _having just finished his ablutions_.    KANWA.      This day my loved one leaves me, and my heart    Is heavy with its grief; the streams of sorrow,    Choked at the source, repress my faltering voice,    I have no words to speak; mine eyes are dimmed    By the dark shadows of the thoughts that rise    Within my soul. If such the force of grief    In an old hermit parted from his nursling,    What anguish must the stricken parent feel--    Bereft for ever of an only daughter.    [_Advances towards_ [S']AKOONTALA    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.    Now, dearest [S']akoontala, we have finished decorating you. You  have only to put on the two linen mantles.                                [[S']AKOONTALA _rises and puts them on_.    GAUTAMI.    Daughter, see, here comes thy foster-father; he is eager to fold  thee in his arms; his eyes swim with tears of joy."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12187"],[0,"The Mystery of 31 New Inn (#14)"],[1,"is the testator in this case.    \"Some two years ago, Jeffrey Blackmore executed a will by which he made  his nephew Stephen his executor and sole legatee; and a few months later  he added a codicil giving two hundred and fifty pounds to his brother  John.\"    \"What was the value of the estate?\" Thorndyke asked.    \"About three thousand five hundred pounds, all invested in Consols. The  testator had a pension from the Foreign Office, on which he lived,  leaving his capital untouched. Soon after having made his will, he left  the rooms in Jermyn Street, where he had lived for some years, stored  his furniture and went to Florence. From thence he moved on to Rome and  then to Venice and other places in Italy, and so continued to travel  about until the end of last September, when it appears that he returned  to England, for at the beginning of October he took a set of chambers in  New Inn, which he furnished with some of the things from his old rooms.  As far as we can make out, he never communicated with any of his  friends, excepting his brother, and the fact of his being in residence  at New Inn or of his being in England at all became known to them only  when he died.\"    \"Was this quite in accordance with his ordinary habits?\" Thorndyke  asked.    \"I should say not quite,\" Blackmore answered. \"My uncle was a studious,  solitary man, but he was not formerly a recluse. He was not much of a  correspondent but he kept up some sort of communication with his  friends. He used, for instance, to write to me sometimes, and, when I  came down from Cambridge for the vacations, he had me to stay with him  at his rooms.\"    \"Is there anything known that accounts for the change in his habits?\"    \"Yes, there is,\" replied Marchmont. \"We shall come to that presently. To  proceed with the narrative: On the fifteenth of last March he was found  dead in his chambers, and a more recent will was then discovered, dated  the twelfth of November of last year. Now no change had taken place in  the circumstances of the testator to account for the new will, nor was  there any appreciable alteration in the disposition of the property. As  far as we can make out, the new will was drawn with the idea of stating  the intentions of the testator with greater exactness and for the sake  of doing away with the codicil. The entire property, with the exception  of two hundred and fifty pounds, was, as before, bequeathed to Stephen,  but the separate items were specified, and the testator's brother, John  Blackmore, was named as the executor and residuary legatee.\"    \"I see,\" said Thorndyke. \"So that your client's interest in the will  would appear to be practically unaffected by the change.\"    \"Yes. There it is,\" exclaimed the lawyer, slapping the table to add  emphasis to his words. \"That is the pity of it! If people who have no  knowledge of law would only refrain from tinkering at their wills, what  a world of trouble would be saved!\"    \"Oh, come!\" said Thorndyke. \"It is not for a lawyer to say that.\"    \"No, I suppose not,\" Marchmont agreed. \"Only, you see, we like the  muddle to be made by the other side. But, in this case, the muddle is on  our side. The change, as you say, seems to leave our friend Stephen's  interests unaffected. That is, of course, what poor Jeffrey Blackmore  thought. But he was mistaken. The effect of the change is absolutely  disastrous.\"    \"Indeed!\"    \"Yes. As I have said, no alteration in the testator's circumstances had  taken place at the time the new will was executed. <i>But</i> only two days  before his death, his sister, Mrs. Edmund Wilson, died; and on her will  being proved it appeared that she had bequeathed to him her entire  personalty, estimated at about thirty thousand pounds.\"    \"Heigho!\" exclaimed Thorndyke. \"What an unfortunate affair!\"    \"You are right,\" said Mr. Marchmont; \"it was a disaster. By the original  will this great sum would have accrued to our friend Mr. Stephen,  whereas now, of course, it goes to the residuary legatee, Mr. John  Blackmore. And what makes it even more exasperating is the fact that  this is obviously not in accordance with the wishes and intentions of  Mr. Jeffrey, who clearly desired his nephew to inherit his property.\"    \"Yes,\" said Thorndyke; \"I think you are justified in assuming that. But  do you know whether Mr. Jeffrey was aware of his sister's intentions?\"    \"We think not. Her will was executed as recently as the third of  September last, and it seems that there had been no communication  between her and Mr. Jeffrey since that date. Besides, if you consider  Mr. Jeffrey's actions, you will see that they suggest no knowledge or  expectation of this very important bequest. A man does not make  elaborate dispositions in regard to three thousand pounds and then leave  a sum of thirty thousand to be disposed of casually as the residue of  the estate.\"    \"No,\" Thorndyke agreed. \"And, as you have said, the manifest intention  of the testator was to leave the bulk of his property to Mr. Stephen. So  we may take it as virtually certain that Mr. Jeffrey had no knowledge of  the fact that he was a beneficiary under his sister's will.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mr. Marchmont, \"I think we may take that as nearly certain.\"    \"With reference to the second will,\" said Thorndyke, \"I suppose there is  no need to ask whether the document itself has been examined; I mean as  to its being a genuine document and perfectly regular?\"    Mr. Marchmont shook his head sadly.    \"No,\" he said, \"I am sorry to say that there can be no possible doubt as  to the authenticity and regularity of the document. The circumstances  under which it was executed establish its genuineness beyond any  question.\"    \"What were those circumstances?\" Thorndyke asked.    \"They were these: On the morning of the twelfth of November last, Mr.  Jeffrey came to the porter's lodge with a document in his hand. 'This,'  he said, 'is my will. I want you to witness my signature. Would you mind  doing so, and can you find another respectable person to act as the  second witness?' Now it happened that a nephew of the porter's, a  painter by trade, was at work in the Inn. The porter went out and  fetched him into the lodge and the two men agreed to witness the  signature. 'You had better read the will,' said Mr. Jeffrey. 'It is not  actually necessary, but it is an additional safeguard and there is  nothing of a private nature in the document.' The two men accordingly  read the document, and, when Mr. Jeffrey had signed it in their  presence, they affixed their signatures; and I may add that the painter  left the recognizable impressions of three greasy fingers.\"    \"And these witnesses have been examined?\"    \"Yes. They have both sworn to the document and to their own signatures,  and the painter recognized his finger-marks.\"    \"That,\" said Thorndyke, \"seems to dispose pretty effectually of any  question as to the genuineness of the will; and if, as I gather, Mr.  Jeffrey came to the lodge alone, the question of undue influence is  disposed of too.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mr. Marchmont. \"I think we must pass the will as absolutely  flawless.\"    \"It strikes me as rather odd,\" said Thorndyke, \"that Jeffrey should have  known so little about his sister's intentions. Can you explain it, Mr.  Blackmore?\"    \"I don't think that it is very remarkable,\" Stephen replied. \"I knew  very little of my aunt's affairs and I don't think my uncle Jeffrey knew  much more, for he was under the impression that she had only a life  interest in her husband's property. And he may have been right. It is  not clear what money this was that she left to my uncle. She was a very  taciturn woman and made few confidences to anyone.\"    \"So that it is possible,\" said Thorndyke, \"that she, herself, may have  acquired this money recently by some bequest?\"    \"It is quite possible,\" Stephen answered.    \"She died, I understand,\" said Thorndyke, glancing at the notes that he  had jotted down, \"two days before Mr. Jeffrey. What date would that be?\"    \"Jeffrey died on the fourteenth of March,\" said Marchmont.    \"So that Mrs. Wilson died on the twelfth of March?\"    \"That is so,\" Marchmont replied; and Thorndyke then asked:    \"Did she die suddenly?\"    \"No,\" replied Stephen; \"she died of cancer. I understand that it was  cancer of the stomach.\"    \"Do you happen to know,\" Thorndyke asked, \"what sort of relations  existed between Jeffrey and his brother John?\"    \"At one time,\" said Stephen, \"I know they were not very cordial; but the  breach may have been made up later, though I don't know that it actually  was.\"    \"I ask the question,\" said Thorndyke, \"because, as I dare say you have  noticed, there is, in the first will, some hint of improved relations.  As it was originally drawn that will makes Mr. Stephen the sole legatee.  Then, a little later, a codicil is added in favour of John, showing that  Jeffrey had felt the necessity of making some recognition of his  brother. This seems to point to some change in the relations, and the  question arises: if such a change did actually occur, was it the  beginning of a new and further improving state of feeling between the  two brothers? Have you any facts bearing on that question?\"    Marchmont pursed up his lips with the air of a man considering an  unwelcome suggestion, and, after a few moments of reflection, answered:    \"I think we must say 'yes' to that. There is the undeniable fact that,  of all Jeffrey's friends, John Blackmore was the only one who knew that  he was living in New Inn.\"    \"Oh, John knew that, did he?\"    \"Yes, he certainly did; for it came out in the evidence that he had  called on Jeffrey at his chambers more than once. There is no denying  that. But, mark you!\" Mr. Marchmont added emphatically, \"that does not  cover the inconsistency of the will. There is nothing in the second will  to suggest that Jeffrey intended materially to increase the bequest to  his brother.\"    \"I"]]]
