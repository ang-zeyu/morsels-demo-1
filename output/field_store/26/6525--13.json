Creon was led  home wearing Zeus' wreath upon his head, and Charmides with Apollo's  crown in his heart. [Illustration: _A Coin of Alexander the Great_. It  shows Zeus sitting on his throne.]          HOW A CITY WAS LOST    Such was Olympia long ago. Every four years such games took place. Then  the plain was crowded and busy and gay. Year after year new statues were  set up, new gifts were brought, new buildings were made. Olympia was  one of the richest places in the world. Its fame flew to every land. At  every festival new people came to see its beauties. It was the meeting  place of the world.    But meantime the bad fortune of Greece began. Her cities quarreled and  fought among themselves. A king came down from the north and conquered  her. After that the Romans sailed over from Italy and conquered her  again. Often Roman emperors carried off some of her statues to make Rome  beautiful. Shipload after shipload they took. The new country was filled  with Greek statues. The old one was left almost empty. Later, after  Christ was born, and the Romans and the Greeks had become Christian, the  emperor said,    \"It is not fitting for Christians to hold a festival in honor of a  heathen god.\" And he stopped the games. He took away the gold and silver  gifts from the treasure houses. He carried away the gold and ivory  statues. Where Phidias' wonderful Zeus went nobody knows. Perhaps the  gold was melted to make money. Olympia sat lonely and deserted by her  river banks. Summer winds whirled dust under her porches. Rabbits made  burrows in Zeus' altar. Doors rusted off their hinges. Foxes made their  dens in Hera's temple. Men came now and then to melt up a bronze statue  for swords or to haul away the stones of her temples for building.  The Alpheios kept eating away its banks and cutting under statues and  monuments. Many a beautiful thing crumbled and fell into the river and  was rolled on down to the sea. Men sometimes found a bronze helmet or a  marble head in the bed of the stream.    After a long time people came and lived among the ruins. On an old  temple floor they built a little church. Men lived in the temple of  Zeus, and women spun and gossiped where the golden statue had sat. In  the temple of Hera people set up a wine press. Did they know that the  little marble baby in the statue near them was the god of the vineyard  and had taught men to make wine? Out of broken statues and columns and  temple stones they built a wall around the little town to keep out their  enemies. Sometimes when they found a bronze warrior or a marble god they  must have made strange stories about it, for they had half forgotten  those wonderful old Greeks. But the marble statues they put into a kiln  to make lime to plaster their houses. The bronze ones they melted up for  tools. Sometimes they found a piece of gold. They thought themselves  lucky then and melted it over into money.    But an earthquake shook down the buildings and toppled over the statues.  The columns and walls of the grand old temple of Zeus fell in a heap.  The marble statues in its pediments dropped to the ground and broke.  Victory fell from her high pillar and shattered into a hundred pieces.  The roof of Hera's temple fell in, and Hermes stood uncovered to the  sky. Old Kronion rocked and sent a landslide down over the treasure  houses. Kladeos rushed out of his course and poured sand over the sacred  place.    That earthquake frightened the people away, and they left Olympia alone  again. Hermes was still there, but he looked out upon ruins. Victory lay  in a heap of fragments. Apollo was there, but broken and buried in earth  with the other people of the pediments. Zeus and all the hundreds of  heroes and athletes were gone. So it was for a while. Then a new race of  people came and built another little town upon the earth-covered ruins.  They little guessed what lay below their poor houses. But for some  reason this town, also, died and left the ruins alone. Then dusty winds  and flooding rivers began to cover up what was left. Kladeos piled up  sand fifteen feet deep. Alpheios swung out of its banks and washed away  the race-course for chariots. Under the rains and floods the sun-dried  bricks of Hera's walls melted again into clay and covered the floor.  Again the earth quaked, and Hermes fell forward on his face, and little  was left of the beautiful old Olympia. Grass and flowers crept in from  the sides. Seeds blew in and shrubs and trees took the place of columns.  Soon the flowers and the animals had Olympia to themselves. A few gray  stones thrust up through the soil. So it was for hundreds of years.  Greece was conquered by the men of Venice and then by the Turks. But  Olympia, in its far corner, was forgotten and untouched except when a  Turkish officer or farmer went there to dig a few stones out of the  ground. And they knew nothing of the ancient gods and the ancient  festival and the old story of the place, for they were foreigners and  new people.    But about a hundred years ago Englishmen and Germans and Frenchmen began  to visit Greece. They went to see, not her new Turkish houses or her  Venetian castles or the strange dress of her new people, but her old  ruins and the signs of her old glory. These men had read of Olympia in  ancient Greek books and they knew what statues and buildings had once  stood there. They wrote back to their friends things like this:    \"I saw a piece of a huge column lying on top of the ground. It was seven  feet across. It must have belonged to the temple of Zeus.\"    \"To-day I saw a long, low place in the ground where I think must have  been the stadion in ancient days.\"    At last, about thirty years ago, Ernst Curtius and several other Germans  went there. They were men who had studied Greek history and Greek art  and they planned to excavate Olympia.    \"We will uncover the sacred enclosure again. Men shall see again the  ancient temples and altars, the stadion, the statues.\"    Germany had given them money for the work, and at last Greece allowed  them to begin. In October they started their digging. Workmen up-rooted  shrubs and dug away dirt. Excavators watched every spadeful. They were  always measuring, making maps, taking notes. They found a few vases,  terra cotta figures, pieces of bronze statues, swords and armor. They  cleared off temple floors and were able to make out the plans of the old  buildings. They found the empty pedestals of many statues. Yet they were  disappointed. Olympia had been a beautiful place, a rich place. They  were finding only the hints of these things. The beauty was gone. Of the  three thousand statues that had been there should they not find one?    Then they uncovered the fallen statues of the pediments of Zeus' temple.  Thirty or more there were--Apollo, Zeus, heroes, women, centaurs,  horses. Arms were gone, heads were broken, legs were lost. The  excavators fitted together all the pieces and set the mended statues up  side by side as they had been in the gable. They found, too, the carved  marble slabs that showed the labors of Herakles. But even these were not  the lovely things that people had hoped to see from Olympia. They were  rather stiff and ungraceful. They had not been made by the greatest  artists. In the temple of Hera one day men were digging in clay. Over  all the rest of Olympia was only sand. The excavators wondered for a  long time why this one spot should have clay. Where could it have come  from? They read their old books over and over. They thought and studied.  At last they said:    \"The walls of the temple must have been made of sun-dried brick. In the  old days they must have been covered with plaster. This and the roof  kept them dry. But the plaster cracked off, and the roof fell in, and  the rain and the floods turned the bricks back to clay again.\"    Then one May morning, when the men were digging in the clay, a workman  lifted off his spadeful of dirt, and white marble gleamed out. After  that there was careful work, with all the excavators standing about to  watch. What would it be? They thought over all the statues that the  ancient books said had stood in Hera's temple. Then were slowly  uncovered, a smooth back, a carved shoulder, a curly head. A white  statue of a young man lay face down in the gray clay. The legs were  gone. The right arm was missing. From his left hung carved drapery. On  his left shoulder lay a tiny marble hand.    \"It is the Hermes of Praxiteles,\" the excavators whispered among  themselves.    In his day Praxiteles had been almost as famous as Phidias. The old  Greek world had rung with his praises. Modern men had dreamed of what  his statues must have been and had longed to see them. How did he shape  the head? How did his bodies curve? What expression was on his faces?  All these things they had wished to know. But not one of his statues  had ever been found. Now here lay one before the very eyes of these  excavators. They put out their hands and lovingly touched the polished  marble skin. But what would they find when they lifted it?--Perhaps the  nose would be gone, the face flattened by the fall, the ears broken, the  beautiful marble chipped. They almost feared to lift it. But at last  they did so.    When they saw the face, they were struck dumb by its beauty, and I think  tears sprang into the eyes of some of them. No such perfect piece of  marble had ever been found before. There was not a scratch. The skin  still glowed with the polishing that Praxiteles' own hands had given it.  There was even a hint of color on the lips. The soft clay bed had saved  the falling statue. Here was a statue that the whole world would love.  It would make the name of Olympia famous again. The excavators were  proud and happy. That old ruined temple seemed indeed a sacred place to  them as they gazed upon perhaps the most beautiful statue in the world.    \"Surely we shall find nothing else so "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9629"],[0,"Ghost Stories of an Antiquary Part 2: More Ghost Stories (#13)"],[1,"to look upon as  the end of his earthly activities, came a telegram: 'Leaves Victoria by  boat train Thursday night. Do not miss. I come to you to-night.  Harrington.'    He arrived accordingly, and they concocted plans. The train left Victoria  at nine and its last stop before Dover was Croydon West. Harrington would  mark down Karswell at Victoria, and look out for Dunning at Croydon,  calling to him if need were by a name agreed upon. Dunning, disguised as  far as might be, was to have no label or initials on any hand luggage,  and must at all costs have the paper with him.    Dunning's suspense as he waited on the Croydon platform I need not  attempt to describe. His sense of danger during the last days had only  been sharpened by the fact that the cloud about him had perceptibly been  lighter; but relief was an ominous symptom, and, if Karswell eluded him  now, hope was gone: and there were so many chances of that. The rumour of  the journey might be itself a device. The twenty minutes in which he  paced the platform and persecuted every porter with inquiries as to the  boat train were as bitter as any he had spent. Still, the train came, and  Harrington was at the window. It was important, of course, that there  should be no recognition: so Dunning got in at the farther end of the  corridor carriage, and only gradually made his way to the compartment  where Harrington and Karswell were. He was pleased, on the whole, to see  that the train was far from full.    Karswell was on the alert, but gave no sign of recognition. Dunning took  the seat not immediately facing him, and attempted, vainly at first,  then with increasing command of his faculties, to reckon the  possibilities of making the desired transfer. Opposite to Karswell, and  next to Dunning, was a heap of Karswell's coats on the seat. It would be  of no use to slip the paper into these--he would not be safe, or would  not feel so, unless in some way it could be proffered by him and  accepted by the other. There was a handbag, open, and with papers in it.  Could he manage to conceal this (so that perhaps Karswell might leave  the carriage without it), and then find and give it to him? This was the  plan that suggested itself. If he could only have counselled with  Harrington! but that could not be. The minutes went on. More than once  Karswell rose and went out into the corridor. The second time Dunning  was on the point of attempting to make the bag fall off the seat, but he  caught Harrington's eye, and read in it a warning. Karswell, from the  corridor, was watching: probably to see if the two men recognized each  other. He returned, but was evidently restless: and, when he rose the  third time, hope dawned, for something did slip off his seat and fall  with hardly a sound to the floor. Karswell went out once more, and  passed out of range of the corridor window. Dunning picked up what had  fallen, and saw that the key was in his hands in the form of one of  Cook's ticket-cases, with tickets in it. These cases have a pocket in  the cover, and within very few seconds the paper of which we have heard  was in the pocket of this one. To make the operation more secure,  Harrington stood in the doorway of the compartment and fiddled with the  blind. It was done, and done at the right time, for the train was now  slowing down towards Dover.    In a moment more Karswell re-entered the compartment. As he did so,  Dunning, managing, he knew not how, to suppress the tremble in his voice,  handed him the ticket-case, saying, 'May I give you this, sir? I believe  it is yours.' After a brief glance at the ticket inside, Karswell uttered  the hoped-for response, 'Yes, it is; much obliged to you, sir,' and he  placed it in his breast pocket.    Even in the few moments that remained--moments of tense anxiety, for they  knew not to what a premature finding of the paper might lead--both men  noticed that the carriage seemed to darken about them and to grow warmer;  that Karswell was fidgety and oppressed; that he drew the heap of loose  coats near to him and cast it back as if it repelled him; and that he  then sat upright and glanced anxiously at both. They, with sickening  anxiety, busied themselves in collecting their belongings; but they both  thought that Karswell was on the point of speaking when the train stopped  at Dover Town. It was natural that in the short space between town and  pier they should both go into the corridor.    At the pier they got out, but so empty was the train that they were  forced to linger on the platform until Karswell should have passed ahead  of them with his porter on the way to the boat, and only then was it safe  for them to exchange a pressure of the hand and a word of concentrated  congratulation. The effect upon Dunning was to make him almost faint.  Harrington made him lean up against the wall, while he himself went  forward a few yards within sight of the gangway to the boat, at which  Karswell had now arrived. The man at the head of it examined his ticket,  and, laden with coats, he passed down into the boat. Suddenly the official  called after him, 'You, sir, beg pardon, did the other gentleman show his  ticket?' 'What the devil do you mean by the other gentleman?' Karswell's  snarling voice called back from the deck. The man bent over and looked at  him. 'The devil? Well, I don't know, I'm sure,' Harrington heard him say  to himself, and then aloud, 'My mistake, sir; must have been your rugs!  ask your pardon.' And then, to a subordinate near him, ''Ad he got a dog  with him, or what? Funny thing: I could 'a' swore 'e wasn't alone. Well,  whatever it was, they'll 'ave to see to it aboard. She's off now. Another  week and we shall be gettin' the 'oliday customers.' In five minutes more  there was nothing but the lessening lights of the boat, the long line of  the Dover lamps, the night breeze, and the moon.    Long and long the two sat in their room at the 'Lord Warden'. In spite of  the removal of their greatest anxiety, they were oppressed with a doubt,  not of the lightest. Had they been justified in sending a man to his  death, as they believed they had? Ought they not to warn him, at least?  'No,' said Harrington; 'if he is the murderer I think him, we have done  no more than is just. Still, if you think it better--but how and where  can you warn him?' 'He was booked to Abbeville only,' said Dunning. 'I  saw that. If I wired to the hotels there in Joanne's Guide, \"Examine your  ticket-case, Dunning,\" I should feel happier. This is the 21st: he will  have a day. But I am afraid he has gone into the dark.' So telegrams were  left at the hotel office.    It is not clear whether these reached their destination, or whether, if  they did, they were understood. All that is known is that, on the  afternoon of the 23rd, an English traveller, examining the front of St  Wulfram's Church at Abbeville, then under extensive repair, was struck on  the head and instantly killed by a stone falling from the scaffold  erected round the north-western tower, there being, as was clearly  proved, no workman on the scaffold at that moment: and the traveller's  papers identified him as Mr Karswell.    Only one detail shall be added. At Karswell's sale a set of Bewick, sold  with all faults, was acquired by Harrington. The page with the woodcut of  the traveller and the demon was, as he had expected, mutilated. Also,  after a judicious interval, Harrington repeated to Dunning something of  what he had heard his brother say in his sleep: but it was not long  before Dunning stopped him.          THE STALLS OF BARCHESTER CATHEDRAL    This matter began, as far as I am concerned, with the reading of a notice  in the obituary section of the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for an early year  in the nineteenth century:        On February 26th, at his residence in the Cathedral Close of      Barchester, the Venerable John Benwell Haynes, D.D., aged 57,      Archdeacon of Sowerbridge and Rector of Pickhill and Candley. He was      of ---- College, Cambridge, and where, by talent and assiduity, he      commanded the esteem of his seniors; when, at the usual time, he took      his first degree, his name stood high in the list of _wranglers_.      These academical honours procured for him within a short time a      Fellowship of his College. In the year 1783 he received Holy Orders,      and was shortly afterwards presented to the perpetual Curacy of      Ranxton-sub-Ashe by his friend and patron the late truly venerable      Bishop of Lichfield.... His speedy preferments, first to a Prebend,      and subsequently to the dignity of Precentor in the Cathedral of      Barchester, form an eloquent testimony to the respect in which he was      held and to his eminent qualifications. He succeeded to the      Archdeaconry upon the sudden decease of Archdeacon Pulteney in 1810.      His sermons, ever conformable to the principles of the religion and      Church which he adorned, displayed in no ordinary degree, without the      least trace of enthusiasm, the refinement of the scholar united with      the graces of the Christian. Free from sectarian violence, and      informed by the spirit of the truest charity, they will long dwell in      the memories of his hearers. [Here a further omission.] The      productions of his pen include an able defence of Episcopacy, which,      though often perused by the author of this tribute to his memory,      afford but one additional instance of the want of liberality and      enterprise which is a too common characteristic of the publishers of      our generation. His published works are, indeed, confined to a      spirited and elegant version of the _Argonautica_ of Valerius Flaccus,      a volume of _Discourses upon the Several Events in the Life of      Joshua_, delivered in his Cathedral, and a number of the charges      which he pronounced at various visitations to the clergy of his      Archdeaconry.
