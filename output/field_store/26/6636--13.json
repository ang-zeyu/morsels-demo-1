The interval of the sub-minor seventh (4:7), used in this way, in  connection with the simpler intervals of the octave (1:2), and the  fifth (2:3), is particularly pleasing because it is neither too  obvious nor too subtle. This ratio of 4:7 is important for the reason  that it expresses the angle of sixty degrees, that is, the numbers 4  and 7 represent (very nearly) the ratio between one-half the base and  the altitude of an equilateral triangle: also because they form part  of the numerical series 1, 4, 7, 10, etc. Both are \"mystic\" numbers,  and in Gothic architecture particularly, proportions were frequently  determined by numbers to which a mystic meaning was attached.  According to Gwilt, the Gothic chapels of Windsor and Oxford are  divided longitudinally by four, and transversely by seven equal parts.  The arcade above the roses in the facade of the cathedral of Tours  shows seven principal units across the front of the nave, and four in  each of the towers.    A distinguishing characteristic of the series of ratios which  represent the consonant intervals within the compass of an octave is  that it advances by the addition of 1 to both terms: 1:2, 2:3,  3:4, 4:5, and 5:6. Such a series always approaches unity, just as,  represented graphically by means of parallelograms, it tends toward a  square. Alberti in his book presents a design for a tower showing his  idea for its general proportions. It consists of six stories, in a  sequence of orders. The lowest story is a perfect cube and each of the  other stories is 11-12ths of the story below, diminishing practically  in the proportion of 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, allowing in each case for the  amount hidden by the projection of the cornice below; each order being  accurate as regards column, entablature, etc. It is of interest to  compare this with Ruskin's idea in his _Seven Lamps_, where he takes  the case of a plant called Alisma Plantago, in which the various  branches diminish in the proportion of 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, respectively,  and so carry out the same idea; on which Ruskin observes that  diminution in a building should be after the manner of Nature.    [Illustration 90: ARCADE OF THE CANCELLERIA]    It would be a profitless task to formulate exact rules of  architectural proportion based upon the laws of musical harmony. The  two arts are too different from each other for that, and moreover  the last appeal must always be to the eye, and not to a mathematical  formula, just as in music the last appeal is to the ear. Laws there  are, but they discover themselves to the artist as he proceeds, and  are for the most part incommunicable. Rules and formulae are useful and  valuable not as a substitute for inspiration, but as a guide: not as  wings, but as a tail. In this connection perhaps all that is necessary  for the architectural designer to bear in mind is that important  ratios of length and breadth, height and width, to be \"musical\" should  be expressed by quantitively small numbers, and that if possible they  should obey some simple law of numerical progression. From this basic  simplicity complexity will follow, but it will be an ordered and  harmonious complexity, like that of a tree, or of a symphony.    [Illustration 91: THE PALAZZO VERZI AT VERONA (LOWER PORTION ONLY).  A COMPOSITION FOUNDED ON THE EQUAL AND REGULAR DIVISION OF SPACE, AS  MUSIC IS FOUNDED ON THE EQUAL AND REGULAR DIVISION OF TIME.]    [Illustration 92: ARCHITECTURE AS RHYTHM. A DIVISION OF SPACE  CORRESPONDING TO 3/4 AND 4/4 TIME.]    In the same way that a musical composition implies the division of  time into equal and regular beats, so a work of architecture should  have for its basis some unit of space. This unit should be nowhere too  obvious and may be varied within certain limits, just as musical time  is retarded or accelerated. The underlying rhythm and symmetry will  thus give value and distinction to such variation. Vasari tells how  Brunelleschi. Bramante and Leonardo da Vinci used to work on paper  ruled in squares, describing it as a \"truly ingenious thing, and of  great utility in the work of design.\" By this means they developed  proportions according to a definite scheme. They set to work with a  division of space analogous to the musician's division of time.  The examples given herewith indicate how close a parallel may exist  between music and architecture in this matter of rhythm (Illustrations  91-93).    [Illustration 93]    It is a demonstrable fact that musical sounds weave invisible patterns  in the air. Architecture, correspondingly, in one of its aspects,  is geometric pattern made fixed and enduring. What could be more  essentially musical for example than the sea arcade of the Venetian  Ducal Palace? The sand forms traced by sound-waves on a musically  vibrating steel plate might easily suggest architectural ornament did  not the differences of scale and of material tend to confuse the mind.  The architect should occupy himself with identities, not differences.  If he will but bear in mind that architecture is pattern in space,  just as music is pattern in time, he will come to perceive the  essential identity between, say, a Greek rosette and a Gothic  rose-window; an arcade and an egg and dart moulding (Illustration 94).  All architectural forms and arrangements which give enduring pleasure  are in their essence musical. Every well composed facade makes harmony  in three dimensions; every good roof-line sings a melody against the  sky.    [Illustration 94: ARCHITECTURE AS PATTERN]          CONCLUSION      In taking leave of the reader at the end of this excursion together  among the by-ways of a beautiful art, the author must needs add a  final word or two touching upon the purpose and scope of these essays.  Architecture (like everything else) has two aspects: it may be viewed  from the standpoint of utility, that is, as construction; or from the  standpoint of expressiveness, that is, as decoration. No attempt has  been made here to deal with its first aspect, and of the second  (which is again twofold), only the universal, not the particular  expressiveness has been sought. The literature of architecture is rich  in works dealing with the utilitarian and constructive side of the  art: indeed, it may be said that to this side that literature is  almost exclusively devoted. This being so, it has seemed worth while  to attempt to show the reverse of the medal, even though it be \"tails\"  instead of \"heads.\"    It will be noted that the inductive method has not, in these pages,  been honored by a due observance. It would have been easy to  have treated the subject inductively, amassing facts and drawing  conclusions, but to have done so the author would have been false  to the very principle about which the work came into being. With the  acceptance of the Ancient Wisdom, the inductive method becomes  no longer necessary. Facts are not useful in order to establish a  hypothesis, they are used rather to elucidate a known and accepted  truth. When theosophical ideas shall have permeated the thought of  mankind, this work, if it survives at all, will be chiefly--perhaps  solely--remarkable by reason of the fact that it was among the  first in which the attempt was made again to unify science, art and  religion, as they were unified in those ancient times and among those  ancient peoples when the Wisdom swayed the hearts and minds of men."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1265"],[0,"Queen Victoria (#14)"],[1," to Lord Melbourne, who replied with a carefully thought-out form  of words, signifying nothing whatever, which, he suggested, she should  send to her uncle. She did so, copying out the elaborate formula, with a  liberal scattering of \"dear Uncles\" interspersed; and she concluded  her letter with a message of \"affectionate love to Aunt Louise and the  children.\" Then at last King Leopold was obliged to recognise the facts.  His next letter contained no reference at all to politics. \"I am glad,\"  he wrote, \"to find that you like Brighton better than last year. I think  Brighton very agreeable at this time of the year, till the east winds  set in. The pavilion, besides, is comfortable; that cannot be denied.  Before my marriage, it was there that I met the Regent. Charlotte  afterwards came with old Queen Charlotte. How distant all this already,  but still how present to one's memory.\" Like poor Madame de Lieven, His  Majesty felt that he had made a mistake.    Nevertheless, he could not quite give up all hope. Another opportunity  offered, and he made another effort--but there was not very much  conviction in it, and it was immediately crushed. \"My dear Uncle,\" the  Queen wrote, \"I have to thank you for your last letter which I received  on Sunday. Though you seem not to dislike my political sparks, I think  it is better not to increase them, as they might finally take fire,  particularly as I see with regret that upon this one subject we cannot  agree. I shall, therefore, limit myself to my expressions of very  sincere wishes for the welfare and prosperity of Belgium.\" After that,  it was clear that there was no more to be said. Henceforward there is  audible in the King's letters a curiously elegiac note. \"My dearest  Victoria, your DELIGHTFUL little letter has just arrived and went  like AN ARROW TO MY HEART. Yes, my beloved Victoria! I DO LOVE YOU  TENDERLY... I love you FOR YOURSELF, and I love in you the dear child  whose welfare I tenderly watched.\" He had gone through much; yet, if  life had its disappointments, it had its satisfactions too. \"I have  all the honours that can be given, and I am, politically speaking, very  solidly established.\" But there were other things besides politics,  there were romantic yearnings in his heart. \"The only longing I still  have is for the Orient, where I perhaps shall once end my life, rising  in the west and setting in the east.\" As for his devotion to his  niece, that could never end. \"I never press my services on you, nor my  councils, though I may say with some truth that from the extraordinary  fate which the higher powers had ordained for me, my experience, both  political and of private life, is great. I am ALWAYS READY to be useful  to you when and where and it may be, and I repeat it, ALL I WANT IN  RETURN IS SOME LITTLE SINCERE AFFECTION FROM YOU.\"    VI    The correspondence with King Leopold was significant of much that still  lay partly hidden in the character of Victoria. Her attitude towards  her uncle had never wavered for a moment. To all his advances she had  presented an absolutely unyielding front. The foreign policy of England  was not his province; it was hers and her Ministers'; his insinuations,  his entreaties, his struggles--all were quite useless; and he must  understand that this was so. The rigidity of her position was the more  striking owing to the respectfulness and the affection with which it was  accompanied. From start to finish the unmoved Queen remained the devoted  niece. Leopold himself must have envied such perfect correctitude; but  what may be admirable in an elderly statesman is alarming in a maiden  of nineteen. And privileged observers were not without their fears. The  strange mixture of ingenuous light-heartedness and fixed determination,  of frankness and reticence, of childishness and pride, seemed to augur  a future that was perplexed and full of dangers. As time passed the less  pleasant qualities in this curious composition revealed themselves more  often and more seriously. There were signs of an imperious, a peremptory  temper, an egotism that was strong and hard. It was noticed that the  palace etiquette, far from relaxing, grew ever more and more inflexible.  By some, this was attributed to Lehzen's influence; but, if that was  so, Lehzen had a willing pupil; for the slightest infringements of  the freezing rules of regularity and deference were invariably and  immediately visited by the sharp and haughty glances of the Queen. Yet  Her Majesty's eyes, crushing as they could be, were less crushing than  her mouth. The self-will depicted in those small projecting teeth and  that small receding chin was of a more dismaying kind than that which a  powerful jaw betokens; it was a self--will imperturbable, impenetrable,  unintelligent; a self-will dangerously akin to obstinacy. And the  obstinacy of monarchs is not as that of other men.    Within two years of her accession, the storm-clouds which, from the  first, had been dimly visible on the horizon, gathered and burst.  Victoria's relations with her mother had not improved. The Duchess  of Kent, still surrounded by all the galling appearances of filial  consideration, remained in Buckingham Palace a discarded figure,  powerless and inconsolable. Sir John Conroy, banished from the presence  of the Queen, still presided over the Duchess's household, and the  hostilities of Kensington continued unabated in the new surroundings.  Lady Flora Hastings still cracked her malicious jokes; the animosity of  the Baroness was still unappeased. One day, Lady Flora found the joke  was turned against her. Early in 1839, travelling in the suite of the  Duchess, she had returned from Scotland in the same carriage with Sir  John. A change in her figure became the subject of an unseemly jest;  tongues wagged; and the jest grew serious. It was whispered that Lady  Flora was with child. The state of her health seemed to confirm the  suspicion; she consulted Sir James Clark, the royal physician, and,  after the consultation, Sir James let his tongue wag, too. On this, the  scandal flared up sky-high. Everyone was talking; the Baroness was not  surprised; the Duchess rallied tumultuously to the support of her lady;  the Queen was informed. At last the extraordinary expedient of a medical  examination was resorted to, during which Sir James, according to Lady  Flora, behaved with brutal rudeness, while a second doctor was  extremely polite. Finally, both physicians signed a certificate entirely  exculpating the lady. But this was by no means the end of the business.  The Hastings family, socially a very powerful one, threw itself into  the fray with all the fury of outraged pride and injured innocence; Lord  Hastings insisted upon an audience of the Queen, wrote to the papers,  and demanded the dismissal of Sir James Clark. The Queen expressed her  regret to Lady Flora, but Sir James Clark was not dismissed. The tide  of opinion turned violently against the Queen and her advisers; high  society was disgusted by all this washing of dirty linen in Buckingham  Palace; the public at large was indignant at the ill-treatment of Lady  Flora. By the end of March, the popularity, so radiant and so abundant,  with which the young Sovereign had begun her reign, had entirely  disappeared.    There can be no doubt that a great lack of discretion had been shown by  the Court. Ill-natured tittle-tattle, which should have been instantly  nipped in the bud, had been allowed to assume disgraceful proportions;  and the Throne itself had become involved in the personal malignities  of the palace. A particularly awkward question had been raised by the  position of Sir James Clark. The Duke of Wellington, upon whom it was  customary to fall back, in cases of great difficulty in high places, had  been consulted upon this question, and he had given it as his opinion  that, as it would be impossible to remove Sir James without a public  enquiry, Sir James must certainly stay where he was. Probably the Duke  was right; but the fact that the peccant doctor continued in the  Queen's service made the Hastings family irreconcilable and produced an  unpleasant impression of unrepentant error upon the public mind. As for  Victoria, she was very young and quite inexperienced; and she can hardly  be blamed for having failed to control an extremely difficult situation.  That was clearly Lord Melbourne's task; he was a man of the world, and,  with vigilance and circumspection, he might have quietly put out the  ugly flames while they were still smouldering. He did not do so; he  was lazy and easy-going; the Baroness was persistent, and he let things  slide. But doubtless his position was not an easy one; passions ran  high in the palace; and Victoria was not only very young, she was very  headstrong, too. Did he possess the magic bridle which would curb  that fiery steed? He could not be certain. And then, suddenly, another  violent crisis revealed more unmistakably than ever the nature of the  mind with which he had to deal.    VII    The Queen had for long been haunted by a terror that the day might come  when she would be obliged to part with her Minister. Ever since the  passage of the Reform Bill, the power of the Whig Government had  steadily declined. The General Election of 1837 had left them with a  very small majority in the House of Commons; since then, they had been  in constant difflculties--abroad, at home, in Ireland; the Radical group  had grown hostile; it became highly doubtful how much longer they could  survive. The Queen watched the development of events in great anxiety.  She was a Whig by birth, by upbringing, by every association, public and  private; and, even if those ties had never existed, the mere fact that  Lord M. was the head of the Whigs would have amply sufficed to determine  her politics. The fall of the Whigs would mean a sad upset for Lord M.  But it would have a still more terrible"]]]
