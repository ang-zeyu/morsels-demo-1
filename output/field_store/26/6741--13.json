They received financial aid out of a vote for charitable institutions  administered by the Colonial Secretary.    The _Private Industrial Schools Act_ of 1900 was introduced as a result  of public resentment against the treatment of boys in a private school.  For the protection of inmates a right of inspection of these private  schools was given to Judges, Members of Parliament, and other named  persons.    The _Industrial Schools Act_ of 1908 was mainly a consolidation of the  law up to that time but the age of children subject to the Act was  increased to 16 years.    The _Child Welfare Act_ of 1925 and the amending Act of 1927 made  substantial changes in the attitude of the State towards children who  had erred. They gave legislative expression to a new world-wide desire  for a more scientific approach to the social problem of dealing with  children who had manifested anti-social tendencies.    The new features provided for in these Acts were:      (_a_) A special branch (later renamed a Division) of the    Department of Education to be known as the \"Child Welfare Branch\"    was established. The Branch or Division consisted of the    Superintendent of Child Welfare, who, under the control of the    Minister and the Director of Education, was charged with the    administration of the Act; a Deputy Superintendent; and such    Welfare Officers, managers, etc., as might be required.      (_b_) Power was taken for the creation of Children's Courts.      =(2) The Children's Court=    The idea of treating children who misbehaved as \"delinquents\" rather  than as offenders against the law arose in Illinois in 1899. This  experiment in social welfare was followed in other States of America,  and the principle was introduced into New Zealand in 1925.    There has been, and still is, much misunderstanding concerning the  procedure in these Children's Courts and the duties of Welfare Officers.  As some recommendations about to be made by this Committee could not be  properly appreciated without a knowledge of the procedure of that Court,  and the way in which Welfare Officers perform their duties, it is  desirable to make the following brief explanation:    Under the Act of 1925 it is the parent and _not_ the child, who is  summoned to appear before the Children's Court. Section 13 (1) of the  Act reads:        On the complaint of any constable or of any Child Welfare      Officer that any child is a neglected, indigent, or delinquent      child, or is not under proper control, or is living in an      environment detrimental to its physical or moral well-being, any      Justice may issue his summons addressed to any person having the      custody of the child requiring him to appear before a Children's      Court at a time to be named in the summons, _either with or      without the child_, in order that the child may be dealt with in      accordance with the provisions of this Act.    This new feature in our law did not displace the jurisdiction of  Magistrates to deal with offences charged against young persons. Any  doubt regarding the continuance of their powers was removed by the  passing of the Child Welfare Amendment Act of 1927. All offences by  children (except murder and manslaughter) are therefore still dealt with  by a Magistrate, but in the Children's Court. In other words, it is not  at present mandatory upon a parent to attend the Children's Court when a  child is charged.    In practice it is frequently found that the parent comes to Court with a  child who is charged with a breach of the law. This may be due to a  family interest; it may be due to a direction by a Magistrate in some  district that he will not deal with a child in the absence of the  parent; it may be due to a misunderstanding of the law that, because a  parent is summoned for having a delinquent child and may be required to  bring the child with him, therefore when the child is summoned the  parent must also attend.    This distinction between summoning the parent of a delinquent child to  the Children's Court and bringing an offending child up on an offence  can best be illustrated by what happened in the cases of carnal  knowledge and indecent assault which were brought prominently to the  notice of the public recently.    The offending boys were charged under those sections of the Crimes Act  which prescribed maximum penalties of five or seven years imprisonment.  In most cases convictions were recorded and the boys were admonished and  discharged; in a few cases the charges were dismissed; in other cases  the boys were committed to the care of the Superintendent or placed  under the supervision of a Child Welfare Officer.    The girls, not having committed a breach of the Crimes Act or any other  statute, could not be charged. Their parents were, in appropriate cases,  summoned to Court upon the complaint that they had the custody of a  \"delinquent\", or a child not under proper control.    That the above distinction is not merely a formal one is shown by the  fact that an offending boy's name, and the decision of the Court  regarding him, is always recorded in the _Police Gazette_. As the girl  is not charged as an offender her name is not so recorded, even although  (as shown in Section V (2) of this report) it may have been the  misbehaviour of the girl which led the boy into the commission of the  offence charged against him.    When a sophisticated girl entices a boy into the commission of an  offence it is anomalous[7] that his name should be recorded in the  _Police Gazette_ while the girl, who may be the real offender, is not  charged and, even when the girl is committed to the care of the State,  her offending is not recorded in the _Police Gazette_.      =(3) Corporal Punishment Abolished=    By the Statutes Amendment Act 1936 the power which formerly existed for  the Court to order a whipping was abolished in so far as children are  concerned. (The penalty of whipping was later abolished in all other  cases by section 30 of the Crimes Amendment Act 1941.)    Representations have been made to this Committee that the abolition of  corporal punishment as a deterrent may have led to an increase in sexual  misbehaviour. It was pointed out that parents and school teachers may  resort to physical chastisement where thought desirable, and it was  suggested that a Magistrate should have power to order a whipping in  suitable cases.    There is, however, a big difference between a parent or teacher himself  punishing by the cane or strap soon after the offence, and a Magistrate  ordering a beating to be inflicted by a complete stranger at a later  date.    The Committee, therefore, does not recommend the restoration of corporal  punishment. It merely notes the matter here as part of the history of  the law relating to child welfare and to show that the representations  on this point have been considered.      =(4) Defects in the Act and its Application=    Several matters have come to the notice of the Committee during its  investigations which prompt it respectfully to point out to the  Government that the present statutory provisions are out-moded and that  the time has arrived for a complete redrafting of the statute to remove  anomalies and to suit the needs of the times.    The terms of the order of reference scarcely require the Committee to  make detailed recommendations. It should suffice to point out certain  respects in which the Act itself might be improved and a new meaning  given to \"child welfare\" which might go a long way towards reducing the  amount of juvenile delinquency.      _(a) \"Child Welfare\" a Misnomer_    The preamble to the Act of 1925 describes the limited nature of its  intention. It is:        An Act to make Better Provision with respect to the Maintenance,      Care, and Control of Children who are specially under the      Protection of the State; and to provide generally for the      Protection and Training of Indigent, Neglected, or Delinquent      Children.    In other words, the Act aimed at dealing with children _after they have  become delinquents_. The new provisions for the welfare of children were  grafted on to statutes which were designed for \"neglected\" and  \"criminal\" children and for the establishment of \"industrial schools\".  The Act did not purport to have regard for the welfare of children who  _might_ become delinquent. It did not contain any provisions for the  doing of preventive work. That being so, it is not surprising to find  that it operates in different ways in different districts. The Committee  was impressed by the preventive work done in some districts, although  the officers doing this work were unable to point to any provisions in  the Act which required them to do it. In these circumstances it is not  possible to blame any Child Welfare Officer for failing to do preventive  work which, under the statute, he is not obliged, and, indeed, has no  authority to perform.      _(b) \"Child Welfare\" Merely a \"Division\"_    The Superintendent of Child Welfare is under the control of the Minister  of Education and the Director of Education. But his duties do not appear  to be integrated with those of the Education Department. The work of the  Division appears to be more associated with the police and the Courts  than the Education Department. In former times \"industrial schools\"  conveniently came under the Education Department. But nowadays, when  very many of the children committed to the care of the State are boarded  out among foster-parents, the work of the Child Welfare Division is more  closely associated with that of \"Justice\" than \"Education\".    The establishment, a few years ago, of a Ministry of Social Welfare, and  the urgent need for more preventive work to be done, suggest the  possibility of better administration if \"Child Welfare\" were given an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14766"],[0,"McGuffey's Third Eclectic Reader (#14)"],[1,"all the  time I have been here.\"  21. Susan now ran home, and as soon as she got there she  said, with a beating heart, \"O grandmother! I deserve to be  punished, for I altered the mark you put in the stocking. Do  forgive me; I am very sorry and unhappy.\"  22. \"Susan,\" said her grandmother, \"I knew it all the time;  but I let you go out, hoping     184  ECLECTIC SERIES.  that your own conscience would tell you of your sin.

LESSON LXX.    YOUNG SOLDIERS.    1. Oh, were you ne'er a schoolboy,  And did you never train,  And feel that swelling of the heart  You ne'er can feel again?    2. Did you never meet, far down the street,  With plumes and banners gay,  While the kettle, for the kettledrum,  Played your march, march away?     THIRD READER.  185        3. It seems to me but yesterday,  Nor scarce so long ago,  Since all our school their muskets took,  To charge the fearful foe.    4. Our muskets were of cedar wood,  With ramrods bright and new;  With bayonets forever set,  And painted barrels, too.    5. We charged upon a flock of geese,  And put them all to flight--  Except one sturdy gander  That thought to show us fight.     186  ECLECTIC SERIES.    6. But, ah! we knew a thing or two;  Our captain wheeled the van;  We routed him, we scouted him,  Nor lost a single man!    7. Our captain was as brave a lad  As e'er commission bore;  And brightly shone his new tin sword;  A paper cap he wore.    8. He led us up the steep hillside,  Against the western wind,  While the cockerel plume that decked his head  Streamed bravely out behind.    9. We shouldered arms, we carried arms,  We charged the bayonet;  And woe unto the mullein stalk  That in our course we met!         THIRD READER.  187    10. At two o'clock the roll we called,  And till the close of day,  With fearless hearts, though tired limbs,  We fought the mimic fray,--  Till the supper bell, from out the dell,  Bade us march, march away.        LESSON LXXI.    HOW WILLIE GOT OUT OF THE SHAFT.  1. Willie's aunt sent him for a birthday present a little  writing book. There was a place in the book for a pencil.  Willie thought a great deal of this little book, and always  kept it in his pocket.  2. One day, his mother was very busy, and he called his  dog, and said, \"Come, Caper, let us have a play.\"     188  ECLECTIC SERIES.  3. When Willie's mother missed him, she went to the door  and looked out, and could not see him anywhere; but she  knew that Caper was with him, and thought they would  come back before long.  4. She waited an, hour, and still they did not come. When  she came to the gate by the road, she met Mr. Lee, and told  him how long Willie had been gone. Mr. Lee thought he  must have gone to sleep under the trees. So they went to all  the trees under which Willie was in the habit of playing, but  he was nowhere to be found.  5. By this time the sun had gone down. The news that  Willie was lost soon spread over the neighborhood, and all  the men and women turned out to hunt. They hunted all  night.  6. The next morning the neighbors were gathered round,  and all were trying to think what to do next, when Caper  came bounding into the room. There was a string tied round  his neck, and a bit of paper tied to it.  7. Willie's father, Mr. Lee, took the paper, and saw that it  was a letter from Willie. He read it aloud. It said, \"O father!  come to me. I am in the big hole in the pasture.\"     THIRD READER.  189  8. Everybody ran at once to the far corner of the pasture;  and there was Willie, alive and well, in the shaft. Oh, how  glad he was when his father caught him in his arms, and  lifted him out!    9. Now I will tell you how Willie came to be in the shaft.  He and Caper went to the pasture field, and came to the edge  of the shaft and sat down. In bending over     190  ECLECTIC SERIES.  to see how deep it was, he lost his balance, and fell in. He  tried very hard to get out, but could not.  10. When the good little dog saw that his master was in  the shaft, he would not leave him, but ran round and round,  reaching down and trying to pull him out. But while Caper  was pulling Willie by the coat sleeves, a piece of sod gave  way under his feet, and he fell in too.  11. Willie called for his father and mother as loud as he  could call; but he was so far away from the house that no one  could hear him.  12. He cried and called till it was dark, and then he lay  down on the ground, and Caper lay down close beside him.  It was not long before Willie cried himself to sleep.  13. When he awoke it was morning, and he began to think  of a way to get out. The little writing book that his aunt had  given him, was in his pocket. He took it out, and, after a  good deal of trouble, wrote the letter to his father.  14. Then he tore the leaf out, and took a string out of his  pocket, and tied it round Caper's neck, and tied the letter to  the     THIRD READER.  191  string. Then he lifted the dog up, and helped him out, and  said to him, \"Go home, Caper, go home!\" The little dog  scampered away, and was soon at home.        LESSON LXXII.  THE PERT CHICKEN.    1. There was once a pretty chicken;  But his friends were very few,  For he thought that there was nothing  In the world but what he knew:  So he always, in the farmyard,  Had a very forward way,  Telling all the hens and turkeys  What they ought to do and say.  \"Mrs. Goose,\" he said, \"I wonder  That your goslings you should let  Go out paddling in the water;  It will kill them to get wet.\"     192  ECLECTIC SERIES,        2. \"I wish, my old Aunt Dorking,\"  He began to her, one day,  \"That you would n't sit all summer  In your nest upon the hay.  Won't you come out to the meadow,  Where the grass with seeds is filled?\"  \"If I should,\" said Mrs. Dorking,  \"Then my eggs would all get chilled.\"  \"No, they wo n't,\" replied the chicken,  \"And no matter if they do;  Eggs are really good for nothing;  What's an egg to me or you?\"    3. \"What's an egg!\" said Mrs. Dorking,  \"Can it be you do not know     THIRD READER.  193    You yourself were in an eggshell  Just one little month ago?  And, if kind wings had not warmed you,  You would not be out to-day,  Telling hens, and geese, and turkeys,  What they ought to do and say!    4. \"To be very wise, and show it,  Is a pleasant thing, no doubt;  But, when young folks talk to old folks,  They should know what they're about.\"  Marian Douglas.        LESSON LXXIII.    INDIAN CORN.    1. Few plants are more useful to man than Indian corn, or  maize. No grain, except rice, is used to so great an extent as  an article of food. In some countries corn is almost the only  food eaten by the people.    3, 13     194  ECLECTIC SERIES.  2. Do you know why it is called Indian corn? It is because  the American Indians were the first corn growers. Columbus  found this grain widely cultivated by them when he  discovered the New World. They pounded it in rude, stone  bowls, and thus made a coarse flour, which they mixed with  water and baked.  3. Indian corn is now the leading crop in the United  States. In whatever part of this land we live, we see corn  growing every year in its proper season. Yet how few can  tell the most simple and important facts about its planting  and its growth!  4. Corn, to do well, must have a rich soil and a warm  climate. It is a tender plant, and is easily injured by cold  weather. The seed corn does not sprout, but rots, if the  ground is cold and wet.  5. To prepare land properly for planting corn, the soil is  made fine by plowing, and furrows are run across the field  four feet apart each way. At every point where these furrows  cross, the farmer drops from four to seven grains of seed  corn. These are then covered with about two inches of earth,  and thus form \"hills\" of corn.     THIRD READER.  195  6. In favorable weather, the tender blades push through  the ground in ten days or two weeks; then the stalks mount  up rapidly, and the long, streamer-like leaves unfold  gracefully from day to day. Corn must be carefully cultivated  while the plants are small. After they begin to shade the  ground, they need but little hoeing or plowing.  7. The moisture and earthy matter, drawn through the  roots, become sap. This passes through the stalk, and enters  the leaves. There a great change takes place which results in  the starting of the ears and the growth of the grain.  8. The maize plant bears two kinds of flowers,--male and  female. The two are widely separated. The male flowers are  on the tassel; the fine silk threads which surround the ear,  and peep out from the end of the husks, are the female  flowers.  9. Each grain on the cob is the starting point for a thread  of silk; and, unless the thread receives some particle of the  dust which falls from the tassel flowers, the kernel with  which it is connected will not grow.  10. The many uses of Indian corn and its products are  worthy of note. The green     196  ECLECTIC SERIES.  stalks and leaves make excellent fodder for cattle. The ripe  grain is used all over the earth as food for horses, pigs, and  poultry. Nothing is better for fattening stock.  11. Green corn, or \"roasting ears,\" hulled corn and  hominy, New England hasty pudding, and succotash are  favorite dishes with many persons. Then there are parched  corn and pop corn--the delight of long winter evenings.  12. Cornstarch is an important article of commerce. Sirup  and sugar are made from the juice of the stalk, and oil and  alcohol from the ripened grain. Corn husks are largely used  for filling       THIRD READER.  197  mattresses, and are braided into mats, baskets, and other  useful articles.  13. Thus it will be seen how varied are the uses of Indian  corn. And besides being so useful, the plant is very beautiful.  The"]]]
