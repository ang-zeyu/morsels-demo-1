And the sails soon in the breeze are swelling,    And the sun with fiery love invites us;    Fill'd the sails are, clouds on high are floating,    On the shore each friend exulting raises    Songs of hope, in giddy joy expecting    Joy the voyage through, as on the morn of sailing,    And the earliest starry nights so radiant.      But by God-sent changing winds ere long he's driven    Sideways from the course he had intended,    And he feigns as though he would surrender,    While he gently striveth to outwit them,    To his goal, e'en when thus press'd, still faithful.      But from out the damp gray distance rising,    Softly now the storm proclaims its advent,    Presseth down each bird upon the waters,    Presseth down the throbbing hearts of mortals.    And it cometh. At its stubborn fury,    Wisely ev'ry sail the seaman striketh;    With the anguish-laden ball are sporting    Wind and water.      And on yonder shore are gather'd standing,    Friends and lovers, trembling for the bold one:    \"Why, alas, remain'd he here not with us!    Ah, the tempest I Cast away by fortune!    Must the good one perish in this fashion?    Might not he perchance * * *. Ye great immortals!\"      Yet he, like a man, stands by his rudder;    With the bark are sporting wind and water,    Wind and water sport not with his bosom:    On the fierce deep looks he, as a master,--    In his gods, or shipwreck'd, or safe landed,    Trusting ever.       TO THE MOON[10] (1778)      Bush and vale thou fill'st again      With thy misty ray,    And my spirit's heavy chain      Casteth far away.      Thou dost o'er my fields extend      Thy sweet soothing eye,    Watching like a gentle friend,      O'er my destiny.      Vanish'd days of bliss and woe      Haunt me with their tone,    Joy and grief in turns I know,      As I stray alone.      Stream beloved, flow on! Flow on!      Ne'er can I be gay!    Thus have sport and kisses gone,      Truth thus pass'd away.      Once I seem'd the lord to be      Of that prize so fair!    Now, to our deep sorrow, we      Can forget it ne'er.      Murmur, stream, the vale along,      Never cease thy sighs;    Murmur, whisper to my song      Answering melodies!      When thou in the winter's night      Overflow'st in wrath,    Or in spring-time sparklest bright,      As the buds shoot forth.      He who from the world retires,      Void of hate, is blest;    Who a friend's true love inspires,      Leaning on his breast!      That which heedless man ne'er knew,      Or ne'er thought aright,    Roams the bosom's labyrinth through,      Boldly into night.      THE FISHERMAN[11] (1778)      The waters rush'd, the waters rose,      A fisherman sat by,    While on his line in calm repose      He cast his patient eye.    And as he sat, and hearken'd there,      The flood was cleft in twain,    And, lo! a dripping mermaid fair      Sprang from the troubled main.      She sang to him, and spake the while      \"Why lurest thou my brood,    With human wit and human guile      From out their native flood?    Oh, couldst thou know how gladly dart      The fish across the sea,    Thou wouldst descend, e'en as thou art,      And truly happy be!      Do not the sun and moon with grace      Their forms in ocean lave?    Shines not with twofold charms their face,      When rising from the wave?    The deep, deep heavens, then lure thee not,--      The moist yet radiant blue,--    Not thine own form,--to tempt thy lot      'Midst this eternal dew?\"      The waters rush'd, the waters rose,      Wetting his naked feet;    As if his true love's words were those,      His heart with longing beat.    She sang to him, to him spake she,      His doom was fix'd, I ween;    Half drew she him, and half sank he,      And ne'er again was seen.    [Illustration: THE FISHERMAN AND THE MERMAID Georg Papperitz]      THE WANDERER'S NIGHT-SONG[12] (1780)    [Written at night on the Kickelhahn, a hill in the forest of Ilmenau,  on the walls of a little hermitage where Goethe composed the last act  of his _Iphigenie_.]      Hush'd on the hill    Is the breeze;    Scarce by the zephyr    The trees    Softly are press'd;    The woodbird's asleep on the bough.    Wait, then, and thou    Soon wilt find rest.      THE ERL-KING[13] (1782)      Who rides there so late through the night dark and drear?    The father it is, with his infant so dear;    He holdeth the boy tightly clasp'd in his arm,    He holdeth him safely, he keepeth him warm.      \"My son, wherefore seek's thou thy face thus to hide?\"    \"Look, father, the Erl-King is close by our side!    Dost see not the Erl-King, with crown and with train?\"    \"My son, 'tis the mist rising over the plain.\"      \"Oh come, thou dear infant! oh come thou with me!    Full many a game I will play there with thee;    On my strand, lovely flowers their blossoms unfold,    My mother shall grace thee with garments of gold.\"      \"My father, my father, and dost thou not hear    The words that the Erl-King now breathes in mine ear?\"    \"Be calm, dearest child, 'tis thy fancy deceives;    'Tis the sad wind that sighs through the withering leaves.\"      \"Wilt go, then, dear infant, wilt go with me there?    My daughters shall tend thee with sisterly care;    My daughters by night their glad festival keep,    They'll dance thee, and rock thee, and sing thee to sleep.\"      \"My father, my father, and dost thou not see,    How the Erl-King his daughters has brought here for me?\"    \"My darling, my darling, I see it aright,    'Tis the aged gray willows deceiving thy sight.\"      \"I love thee, I'm charm'd by thy beauty, dear boy!    And if thou'rt unwilling, then force I'll employ.\"    \"My father, my father, he seizes me fast,    Full sorely the Erl-King has hurt me at last.\"      The father now gallops, with terror half wild,    He grasps in his arms the poor shuddering child;    He reaches his court-yard with toil and with dread,--    The child in his arms finds he motionless, dead.      THE GODLIKE[14] (1783)      Noble be man,    Helpful and good!    For that alone    Distinguisheth him    From all the beings    Unto us known.      Hail to the beings,    Unknown and glorious,    Whom we forebode!    From _his_ example    Learn we to know them!      For unfeeling    Nature is ever    On bad and on good    The sun alike shineth;    And on the wicked,    As on the best,    The moon and stars gleam.      Tempest and torrent,    Thunder and hail,    Roar on their path,    Seizing the while,    As they haste onward,    One after another.      Even so, fortune    Gropes 'mid the throng--    Innocent boyhood's    Curly head seizing,--    Seizing the hoary    Head of the sinner.      After laws mighty,    Brazen, eternal,    Must all we mortals    Finish the circuit    Of our existence.      Man, and man only    Can do the impossible    He 'tis distinguisheth,    Chooseth and judgeth;    He to the moment    Endurance can lend.      He and he only    The good can reward,    The bad can he punish,    Can heal and can save;    All that wanders and strays    Can usefully blend.      And we pay homage    To the immortals    As though they were men,    And did in the great,    What the best, in the small,    Does or might do.      Be the man that is noble,    Both helpful and good,    Unweariedly forming    The right and the useful,    A type of those beings    Our mind hath foreshadow'd!      MIGNON[15] (1785)    [This universally known poem is also to be found in _Wilhelm  Meister_.]      Know'st thou the land where the fair citron blows,    Where the bright orange midst the foliage glows,    Where soft winds greet us from the azure skies,    Where silent myrtles, stately laurels rise,    Know'st thou it well?                             'Tis there, 'tis there,    That I with thee, beloved one, would repair.      Know'st thou the house? On columns rests its pile,    Its halls are gleaming, and its chambers smile,    And marble statues stand and gaze on me:    \"Poor child! what sorrow hath befallen thee?\"    Know'st thou it well?                             'Tis there, 'tis there,    That I with thee, protector, would repair!      Know'st thou the mountain, and its cloudy bridge?    The mule can scarcely find the misty ridge;    In caverns dwells the dragon's olden brood,    The frowning crag obstructs the raging flood.    Know'st thou it well?                             'Tis there, 'tis there,    Our path lies--Father--thither, oh repair!      PROXIMITY OF THE BELOVED ONE[16] (1795)      I think of thee, whene'er the sun his beams        O'er ocean flings;    I think of thee, whene'er the moonlight gleams        In silv'ry springs.      I see thee, when upon the distant ridge        The dust awakes;    At midnight's hour, when on the fragile bridge        The wanderer quakes.      I hear thee, when yon billows rise on high,        With murmur deep.    To tread the silent grove oft wander I,        When all's asleep.      I'm near thee, though thou far away mayst be--        Thou, too, art near!    The sun then sets, the stars soon lighten me,        Would thou wert here!      THE SHEPHERD'S LAMENT[17] (1802)      Up yonder on the mountain,      I dwelt for days together;    Looked down into the valley,      This pleasant summer weather.      My sheep go feeding onward,      My dog sits watching by;    I've wandered to the valley,      And yet I know not why.      The meadow, it is pretty,      With flowers so fair to see;    I gather them, but no one      Will take the flowers from me.      The good tree gives me shadow,      And shelter from the rain;    But yonder door is silent,      It will not ope again!

Instead of this I said with conscious feebleness: \"I am more than  thankful to have been able to give you any encouragement--which you must  remember comes from me second-hand, after all. It is to Dr. Thorndyke  that we all look for ultimate deliverance.\"    \"I know. But it is you who came to comfort me in my trouble, so, you  see, the honours are divided--and not divided quite equally, I fear, for  women are unreasoning creatures, as, no doubt, your experience has  informed you. I think I hear my aunt's voice, so you had better escape  before your retreat is cut off. But before you go, you must tell me how  and when I can see Reuben. I want to see him at the earliest possible  moment. Poor fellow! He must not be allowed to feel that his friends  have forgotten him even for a single instant.\"    \"You can see him to-morrow, if you like,\" I said; and, casting my good  resolutions to the winds, I added: \"I shall be going to see him myself,  and perhaps Dr. Thorndyke will go.\"    \"Would you let me call at the Temple and go with you? Should I be much  in the way? It is rather an alarming thing to go to a prison alone.\"    \"It is not to be thought of,\" I answered. \"If you will call at the  Temple--it is on the way--we can drive to Holloway together. I suppose  you are resolved to go? It will be rather unpleasant, as you are  probably aware.\"    \"I am quite resolved. What time shall I come to the Temple?\"    \"About two o'clock, if that will suit you.\"    \"Very well. I will be punctual; and now you must go or you will be  caught.\"    She pushed me gently towards the door and, holding out her hand, said--   \"I haven't thanked you half enough and I never can. Good-bye!\"    She was gone, and I stood alone in the street, up which yellowish  wreaths of fog were beginning to roll. It had been quite clear and  bright when I entered the house, but now the sky was settling down into  a colourless grey, the light was failing and the houses dwindling into  dim, unreal shapes that vanished at half their height. Nevertheless I  stepped out briskly and strode along at a good pace, as a young man is  apt to do when his mind is in somewhat of a ferment. In truth, I had a  good deal to occupy my thoughts and, as will often happen both to young  men and old, those matters that bore most directly upon my own life and  prospects were the first to receive attention.    What sort of relations were growing up between Juliet Gibson and me? And  what was my position? As to hers, it seemed plain enough; she was  wrapped up in Reuben Hornby and I was her very good friend because I was  his. But for myself, there was no disguising the fact that I was  beginning to take an interest in her that boded ill for my peace of  mind.    Never had I met a woman who so entirely realised my conception of what a  woman should be, nor one who exercised so great a charm over me. Her  strength and dignity, her softness and dependency, to say nothing of her  beauty, fitted her with the necessary weapons for my complete and utter  subjugation. And utterly subjugated I was--there was no use in denying  the fact, even though I realised already that the time would presently  come when she would want me no more and there would remain no remedy for  me but to go away and try to forget her.    But was I acting as a man of honour? To this I felt I could fairly  answer \"yes,\" for I was but doing my duty, and could hardly act  differently if I wished to. Besides, I was jeopardising no one's  happiness but my own, and a man may do as he pleases with his own  happiness. No; even Thorndyke could not accuse me of dishonourable  conduct.    Presently my thoughts took a fresh turn and I began to reflect upon what  I had heard concerning Mr. Hornby. Here was a startling development,  indeed, and I wondered what difference it would make in Thorndyke's  hypothesis of the crime. What his theory was I had never been able to  guess, but as I walked along through the thickening fog I tried to fit  this new fact into our collection of data and determine its bearings and  significance.    In this, for a time, I failed utterly. The red thumb-mark filled my  field of vision to the exclusion of all else. To me, as to everyone else  but Thorndyke, this fact was final and pointed to a conclusion that was  unanswerable. But as I turned the story of the crime over and over,  there came to me presently an idea that set in motion a new and very  startling train of thought.    Could Mr. Hornby himself be the thief? His failure appeared sudden to  the outside world, but he must have seen difficulties coming. There,  indeed, was the thumb-mark on the leaf which he had torn from his  pocket-block. Yes! but who had seen him tear it off? No one. The fact  rested on his bare statement.    But the thumb-mark? Well, it was possible (though unlikely)--still  possible--that the mark might have been made accidentally on some  previous occasion and forgotten by Reuben, or even unnoticed. Mr. Hornby  had seen the \"Thumbograph,\" in fact his own mark was in it, and so would  have had his attention directed to the importance of finger-prints in  identification. He might have kept the marked paper for future use, and,  on the occasion of the robbery, pencilled a dated inscription on it, and  slipped it into the safe as a sure means of diverting suspicion. All  this was improbable in the highest degree, but then so was every other  explanation of the crime; and as to the unspeakable baseness of the  deed, what action is too base for a gambler in difficulties?    I was so much excited and elated by my own ingenuity in having formed an  intelligible and practicable theory of the crime, that I was now  impatient to reach home that I might impart my news to Thorndyke and see  how they affected him. But as I approached the centre of the town the  fog grew so dense that all my attention was needed to enable me to  thread my way safely through the traffic; while the strange, deceptive  aspect that it lent to familiar objects and the obliteration of  landmarks made my progress so slow that it was already past six o'clock  when I felt my way down Middle Temple Lane and crept through Crown  Office Row towards my colleague's chambers.    On the doorstep I found Polton peering with anxious face into the blank  expanse of yellow vapour.    \"The Doctor's late, sir,\" said he. \"Detained by the fog, I expect. It  must be pretty thick in the Borough.\"    (I may mention that, to Polton, Thorndyke was The Doctor. Other inferior  creatures there were, indeed, to whom the title of \"doctor\" in a way,  appertained; but they were of no account in Polton's eyes. Surnames were  good enough for them.)    \"Yes, it must be,\" I replied, \"judging by the condition of the Strand.\"    I entered and ascended the stairs, glad enough of the prospect of a warm  and well-lighted room after my comfortless groping in the murky streets,  and Polton, with a final glance up and down the walk reluctantly  followed.    \"You would like some tea, sir, I expect?\" said he, as he let me in  (though I had a key of my own now).    I thought I should, and he accordingly set about the preparations in his  deft methodical way, but with an air of abstraction that was unusual  with him.    \"The Doctor said he should be home by five,\" he remarked, as he laid the  tea-pot on the tray.    \"Then he is a defaulter,\" I answered. \"We shall have to water his tea.\"    \"A wonderful punctual man, sir, is the Doctor,\" pursued Polton. \"Keeps  his time to the minute, as a rule, he does.\"    \"You can't keep your time to a minute in a 'London Particular,'\" I said  a little impatiently, for I wished to be alone that I might think over  matters, and Polton's nervous flutterings irritated me somewhat. He was  almost as bad as a female housekeeper.    The little man evidently perceived my state of mind, for he stole away  silently, leaving me rather penitent and ashamed, and, as I presently  discovered on looking out of the window, resumed his vigil on the  doorstep. From this coign of vantage he returned after a time to take  away the tea-things; and thereafter, though it was now dark as well as  foggy, I could hear him softly flitting up and down the stairs with a  gloomy stealthiness that at length reduced me to a condition as  nervously apprehensive as his own.          CHAPTER VIII    A SUSPICIOUS ACCIDENT      The Temple clock had announced in soft and confidential tones that it  was a quarter to seven, in which statement it was stoutly supported by  its colleague on our mantelpiece, and still there was no sign of  Thorndyke. It was really a little strange, for he was the soul of  punctuality, and moreover, his engagements were of such a kind as  rendered punctuality possible. I was burning with impatience to impart  my news to him, and this fact, together with the ghostly proceedings of  Polton, worked me up to a state of nervous tension that rendered either  rest or thought equally impossible. I looked out of the window at the  lamp below, glaring redly through the fog, and then, opening the door,  went out on to the landing to listen.    At this moment Polton made a silent appearance on the stairs leading  from the laboratory, giving me quite a start; and I was about to retire  into the room when my ear caught the tinkle of a hansom approaching from  Paper Buildings.    The vehicle drew nearer, and at length stopped opposite the house, on  which Polton slid down the stairs with the agility of a harlequin. A few  moments later I heard his voice ascending from the hall--    \"I do hope, sir, you're not much hurt?\"    I ran down the stairs and met Thorndyke coming up slowly with his right  hand on Polton's shoulder. His clothes were muddy, his left arm was in a  sling, and a black handkerchief under"]]]
