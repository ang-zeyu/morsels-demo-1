Arthur was a  good deal changed since his recall from college; and in nothing more than  in his manner to Elsie; he was now always polite; often cordial even when  alone with her. He was not thoroughly reformed, but had ceased to gamble  and seldom drank to intoxication.    \"Thank you; but indeed I must go at once and dress for tea,\" Elsie said,  consulting her watch. \"You are not going yet?\"    \"No, he will stay to tea,\" said Rose.    \"But must go soon after, as I have an engagement,\" added Arthur.    Elsie met her father in the hall. \"Ah, you are at home again,\" he remarked  with a pleased look; \"that is well; I was beginning to think you were  making it very late.\"    \"But you are not uneasy when I am in such good hands, papa?\"    \"No, not exactly; but like better to take care of you myself.\"    The clock was just striking eight as Arthur mounted and rode away from his  brother's door. It was not a dark night, or yet very light; for though the  moon had risen, dark clouds were scudding across the sky, allowing but an  occasional glimpse of her face, and casting deep shadows over the  landscape.    In the partial obscurity of one of these, and only a few rods ahead of  him, when about half-way between the Oaks and Roselands, Arthur thought he  discovered the figure of a man standing by the roadside, apparently  waiting to halt him as he passed.    \"Ha! you'll not take me by surprise, my fine fellow, whoever you may be,\"  muttered Arthur between his set teeth, drawing out a revolver and cocking  it, \"Halloo there! Who are you; and what d'ye want?\" he called, as his  horse brought him nearly opposite the suspicious looking object.    \"Your money or your life, Dinsmore,\" returned the other with a coarse  laugh. \"Don't pretend not to know me, old chap.\"    \"You!\" exclaimed Arthur, with an oath, but half under his breath. \"I  thought you were safe in----\"    \"State prison, eh? Well, so I was, but they've pardoned me out. I was a  reformed character, you see; and then my vote was wanted at the last  election, ha! ha! And so I've come down to see how my old friends are  getting along.\"    \"Friends! don't count me among them!\" returned Arthur, hastily;  \"jail-birds are no mates for me.\"    \"No, I understand that, the disgrace is in being caught. But you'd as well  keep a civil tongue in your head; for if you're covering me with a  revolver, I'm doing the same by you.\"    \"I'm not afraid of you, Tom,\" answered Arthur, with a scornful laugh, \"but  I'm in a hurry; so be good enough to move out of the way and let me pass.\"  For the other had now planted himself in the middle of the road, and laid  a heavy hand upon the horse's bridle-rein.    \"When I've said my say; no sooner. So that pretty niece of yours, my  former fiancee, is engaged to Travilla? the man whom, of all others, I  hate with a hatred bitterer than death. I would set my heel upon his head  and grind it into the earth as I would the head of a venomous reptile.\"    \"Who told you?\"    \"I overheard some o' their sweet talk as they rode by here not two hours  ago. He robbed me of her that he might snatch the prize himself; I saw his  game at the time. But he shall never get her,\" he concluded, grinding his  teeth with rage.    \"Pray, how do you propose to prevent it?\"    \"I'll call him out.\"    Arthur's laugh rang out mockingly upon the still night air. \"Southern  gentlemen accept a challenge only from gentlemen; and as for Travilla,  besides being a dead shot, he's too pious to fight a duel, even with his  own class.\"    \"He'll meet me in fair fight, or I'll shoot him down, like a dog, in his  tracks.\" The words, spoken in low tone, of concentrated fury, were  accompanied with a volley of horrible oaths.    \"You'd better not try it!\" said Arthur; \"you'd be lynched and hung on the  nearest tree within an hour.\"    \"They'd have to catch me first.\"    \"And they would, they'd set their bloodhounds on your track, and there'd  be no escape. As to the lady having been your fiancee--she never was; she  would not engage herself without my brother's consent, which you were not  able to obtain. And now you'd better take yourself off out of this  neighborhood, after such threats as you've made!\"    \"That means you intend to turn informer, eh?\"    \"It means nothing of the kind, unless I'm called up as a witness in court;  but you can't prowl about here long without being seen and arrested as a  suspicious character, an abolitionist, or some other sort of  scoundrel--which last you know you are,\" Arthur could not help adding in a  parenthesis. \"So take my advice, and retreat while you can. Now out o' the  way, if you please, and let me pass.\"    Jackson sullenly stood aside, letting go the rein, and Arthur galloped  off.    In the meantime, the older members of the family at the Oaks were quietly  enjoying themselves in the library, where bright lights, and a cheerful  wood-fire snapping and crackling on the hearth, added to the sense of  comfort imparted by handsome furniture, books, painting, statuary, rich  carpet, soft couches, and easy chairs.    The children had been sent to bed. Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore sat by the centre  table, the one busy with the evening paper, the other sewing, but now and  then casting a furtive glance at a distant sofa, where Mr. Travilla and  Elsie were seated side by side, conversing in an undertone.    \"This is comfort, having you to myself again,\" he was saying, as he  watched admiringly the delicate fingers busied with a crochet needle,  forming bright meshes of scarlet zephyr. \"How I missed you when you were  gone! and yet, do you know, I cannot altogether regret the short  separation, since otherwise I should have missed my precious budget of  letters.\"    \"Ah,\" she said, lifting her merry brown eyes to his face for an instant,  then dropping them again, with a charming smile and blush, \"do you think  that an original idea, or rather that it is original only with yourself?\"    \"And you are glad to have mine? though not nearly so sweet and fresh as  yours.\" How glad he looked as he spoke.    \"Ah!\" she answered archly, \"I'll not tell you what I have done with them,  lest you grow conceited. But I have a confession to make,\" and she laughed  lightly. \"Will you absolve me beforehand?\"    \"Yes, if you are penitent, and promise to offend no more. What is it?\"    \"I see I have aroused your curiosity, I shall not keep you in suspense. I  am corresponding with a young gentleman. Here is a letter from him,  received to-day;\" drawing it from her pocket as she spoke, she put it into  his hand.    \"I have no wish to examine it,\" he said gravely, laying it on her lap. \"I  can trust you fully, Elsie.\"    \"But I should like you to read it; 'tis from Mr. Mason, my chaplain at  Viamede, and gives a lengthy, and very interesting account of the  Christmas doings there.\"    \"Which I should much prefer to hear from your lips, my little friend.\"    \"Ah, read it, please; read it aloud to me; I shall then enjoy it as much  as I did the first time; and you will learn how truly good and pious Mr.  Mason is, far better than from my telling. Not that he talks of himself,  but you perceive it from what he says of others.\"    He complied with her request, reading in the undertone in which they had  been talking.    \"A very well written and interesting letter,\" he remarked, as he refolded  and returned it. \"Yes, I should judge from it that he is the right man in  the right place. I presume the selection of gifts so satisfactory to all  parties must have been yours?\"    \"Yes, sir; being with them, I was able to ascertain their wants and  wishes, by questioning one in regard to another. Then I made out the list,  and left Mr. Mason to do the purchasing for me. I think I can trust him  again, and it is a great relief to my mind to have some one there to  attend to the welfare of their souls and bodies.\"    \"Have you gotten over your fright of this evening?\" he inquired tenderly,  bending towards her, and speaking lower than before.    \"Almost if--if you have not to return to Ion to-night. Must you, really?\"    \"Yes; mother would be alarmed by my absence; and she seldom retires till I  am there to bid her good-night.\"    \"Then promise me to avoid that thicket,\" she pleaded anxiously.    \"I cannot think there is any real danger,\" he said, with a reassuring  smile, \"but I shall take the other road; 'tis but a mile further round,  and it would pay me to travel fifty to spare you a moment's anxiety,  dearest.\"    She looked her thanks.    He left at ten, his usual hour, bidding her have no fear for him, since no  real evil can befall those who put their trust in Him whose watchful,  protecting care is ever about His chosen ones.    \"Yes,\" she whispered, as for a moment his arm encircled her waist, \"'What  time I am afraid, I will trust in Thee.' It is comparatively easy to trust  for myself, and God will help me to do it for you also.\"    She stood at the window watching his departure, her heart going up in  silent prayer for his safety. Then, saying to herself, \"Papa must not be  disturbed with my idle fancies,\" she turned to receive his good-night with  a face so serene and unclouded, a manner so calm and peaceful, that he had  no suspicion of anything amiss.    Nor was it an assumed peace and calmness; for she had not now to learn to  cast her care on the Lord, whom she had loved and served from her very  infancy; and her head had not rested many moments upon her pillow ere she  fell into a deep, sweet sleep, that lasted until morning.    While Elsie slept, and Mr. Travilla galloped homeward by the longer route,  the moon, peering through the cloud curtains, looked down upon a dark  figure, standing behind a tree not many yards distant from the thicket  Elsie had besought her friend to shun. The man held a revolver in his  hand, ready cocked for instant use. His attitude was that of one  listening intently for some expected sound.    He had stood"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14875"],[0,"Elsie's children (#14)"],[1," if you, sir, can  conveniently advance the few hundred dollars we shall need to carry us  there and give us a fair start, I shall gladly and thankfully accept it as  a loan; hoping to be able to return it in a year or two.\"    This was the arrangement made and preparations to carry it out were  immediately set on foot. In a few days the brother and sister bade  good-bye to their kind entertainers, their mother, now nearly recovered,  joined them in Philadelphia, and the three together turned their faces  westward.    In bidding adieu to Elsie, Sally whispered with tears of joy the good news  that Tom was trusting in a strength mightier than his own, and so, as  years rolled on, these friends were not surprised to hear of his steadfast  adherence to the practice of total abstinence from all intoxicating  drinks, and his growing prosperity.          CHAPTER TWELFTH.                \"You may as well      Forbid the seas to obey the moon,      As, or by oath, remove, or counsel, shake      The fabric of her folly.\"                                 --SHAKESPEARE.      Scarcely had the Gibsons departed when their places were more than filled  by the unexpected arrival of a large party from Roselands, comprising old  Mr. Dinsmore, with his daughter Mrs. Conly and her entire family, with the  exception of Calhoun, who would follow shortly.    They were welcomed by their relatives with true southern hospitality and  assured that the two cottages could readily be made to accommodate them  all comfortably.    \"What news of Molly?\" was the first question after the greetings had been  exchanged.    Mrs. Conly shook her head and sighed, \"Hasn't been able to set her foot on  the floor for weeks, and I don't believe she ever will. That's Dr.  Pancoast's opinion, and he's good authority. 'Twas her condition that  brought us North. We've left her and her mother at the Continental in  Philadelphia.    \"There's to be a consultation to-morrow of all the best surgeons in the  city. Enna wanted me to stay with her till that was over, but I couldn't  think of it with all these children fretting and worrying to get down here  out of the heat. So I told her I'd leave Cal to take care of her and  Molly.    \"Dick's with them too. He's old enough to be useful now, and Molly clings  to him far more than to her mother.\"    \"Isn't it dreadful,\" said Virginia, \"to think that that fall down-stairs  has made her a cripple for life? though nobody thought she was much hurt  at first.\"    \"Poor child! how does she bear it?\" asked her uncle.    \"She doesn't know how to bear it at all,\" said Mrs. Conly; \"she nearly  cries her eyes out.\"    \"No wonder,\" remarked the grandfather; \"it's a terrible prospect she has  before her, to say nothing of the present suffering. And her mother has no  patience with her; pities herself instead of the child.\"    \"No,\" said Mrs. Conly, \"Enna was never known to have much patience with  anybody or anything.\"    \"But Dick's good to her,\" remarked Isadore.    \"Yes,\" said Arthur, \"it's really beautiful to see his devotion to her and  how she clings to him. And it's doing the lad good;--making a man of  him.\"    \"Surely Enna must feel for her child!\" Elsie said, thinking of her own  darlings and how her very heart would be torn with anguish at the sight of  one of them in so distressing a condition.    \"Yes, of course, she cried bitterly over her when first the truth dawned  upon her that Molly was really so dreadfully injured; but of course that  couldn't last and she soon took to bewailing her own hard fate in having  such a burden on her hands, a daughter who must always live single and  could never be anything but a helpless invalid.\"    Elsie understood how it was; for had she not known Enna from a child? Her  heart ached for Molly, and as she told her own little ones of their poor  cousin's hopeless, helpless state, she mingled her tears with theirs.    \"Mamma, won't you 'vite her to come here?\" pleaded Harold.    \"Yes, dear mamma, do,\" urged the others, \"and let us all try to amuse and  comfort her.\"    \"If I do, my dears, you may be called upon at times to give up your  pleasures for her. Do you think you will be willing to do so?\"    At that the young faces grew very grave, and for a moment no one spoke.  Quick, impulsive Violet was the first to answer.    \"Yes, mamma, I'm willing; I do feel so sorry for her I'd do anything to  help her bear her pain.\"    \"Mamma,\" said Elsie, softly, \"I'll ask Jesus to help me, and I'm sure he  will.\"    \"So am I, daughter; and I think Vi means to ask his help too?\"    \"Oh, yes, mamma, I do!\"    \"And I,\" \"and I,\" \"and I,\" responded the others.    So the invitation was sent, for Molly and her mother and brother to come  and pay as long a visit as they would.    A letter came in a few days, accepting it and giving the sorrowful news  that all the surgeons agreed in the opinion that the poor girl's spine had  been so injured that she would never again have any use of her lower  limbs.    It was Mrs Conly who brought the letter to her niece, it having come in  one addressed to herself. She expressed strong sympathy for Molly, but was  much taken up with the contents of another letter received by the same  mail.    \"I've just had a most generous offer from Mr. Conly's sister, Mrs.  Delaford,\" she said to her niece. \"She has no children of her own, is a  widow and very wealthy, and she's very fond of my Isadore, who is her  godchild and namesake. She offers now to clothe and educate her, with the  view of making the child her heir; and also to pay for Virgy's tuition, if  I will send them both to the convent where she was herself educated.\"    \"Aunt Louise, you will not think of it surely?\" cried Elsie, looking much  disturbed.    \"And why not, pray?\" asked Mrs. Conly, drawing herself up, and speaking  in a tone of mingled hauteur, pique and annoyance.    \"You would not wish them to become Romanists?\"    \"No, of course not; but that need not follow.\"    \"It is very apt to follow.\"    \"Nonsense! I should exact a promise that their faith would not be  interfered with.\"    \"But would that avail, since, 'No faith with heretics,' has been for  centuries the motto of the 'infallible, unchangeable,' Church of Rome?\"    \"I think you are inclined to see danger where there is none,\" returned the  aunt. \"I would not for the world be as anxious and fussy about my children  as you are about yours. Besides, I think it quite right to let their  father's relatives do for them when they are both able and willing.\"    \"But Aunt Louise----\"    \"There! don't let us talk any more about the matter to-day, if you  please,\" interrupted Mrs. Conly, rising, \"I must go now and prepare for my  bath. I'll be in again this evening to see Enna and the others. They'll be  down by the afternoon train. Good-morning.\"    And she sailed away, leaving Elsie sad and anxious for the future of her  young cousins.    \"What is it, daughter?\" Mr. Dinsmore asked, coming in a moment later. \"I  have seldom seen you look so disturbed.\"    Her face brightened, as was its wont under her father's greeting, but,  this time, only momentarily.    \"I am troubled, papa,\" she said, making room for him on the sofa by her  side. \"Here is a note from Enna. The doctors give Molly no hope that she  will ever walk again. One cannot help feeling very sad for her, poor  child! and besides something Aunt Louise has been telling me, makes me  anxious for Isadore and Virginia.\"    He was scarcely less concerned than she, when he heard what that was. \"I  shall talk to Louise,\" he said, \"it would be the height of folly to expose  her girls to such influences. It is true I once had some thoughts of  sending you to a convent school, under the false impression that the  accomplishments were more thoroughly taught there than in the Protestant  seminaries; but with the light I have since gained upon the subject, I  know that it would have been a fearful mistake.\"    \"Dear papa,\" she said, putting her hand into his and looking at him with  loving eyes, \"I am so thankful to you that you did not; so thankful that  you taught me yourself. The remembrance of the hours we spent together as  teacher and pupil, has always been very sweet to me.\"    \"To me also,\" he answered with a smile.    The expected guests arrived at the appointed time, Enna looking worn,  faded and fretful, Dick sad and anxious, poor Molly, weary, exhausted,  despairing; as if life had lost all brightness to her.    Her proud spirit rebelled against her helplessness, against the curious,  even the pitying looks it attracted to her from strangers in the streets  and public conveyances.    The transit from one vehicle to another was made in the strong arms of a  stalwart negro whom they had brought with them from Roselands, Dick  following closely to guard his sister from accident, and shield her as  much as possible from observation, while Enna and Cal brought up the rear.    A room on the ground floor had been appropriated to Molly's use, and  thither she was carried at once, and gently laid upon a couch. Instantly  her cousin Elsie's arms were about her, her head pillowed upon the gentle  breast, while tears of loving sympathy fell fast upon her poor pale face,  mingled with tender caresses and whispered words of endearment.    It did the child good; the tears and sobs that came in response, relieved  her aching heart of half its load. But it vexed Enna.    \"What folly, Elsie!\" she said, \"don't you see how you're making the child  cry? And I've been doing my best to get her to stop it; for of course it  does no good, and only injures her eyes.\"    \"Forgive me, dear child, if I have hurt you,\" Elsie said low and tenderly,  as she laid Molly's head gently back against the pillows.    \"You haven't! you've done me good!\" cried the girl, flashing an indignant  glance at Enna. \"Oh, mother, if you treated me so, it wouldn't be half so  hard to bear!\"    \"I've learned not to expect anything but"]]]
