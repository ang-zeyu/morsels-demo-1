[196] Whatever the signification of the battle of Mag-tured may be, the  place which it was localised is crowded with Neolithic megaliths,  dolmens, etc. To later fancy these were the graves of warriors slain in  a great battle fought there, and that battle became the fight between  Fomorians and Tuatha De Dananns. Mag-tured may have been the scene of a  battle between their respective worshippers.    [197] O'Grady, ii. 203.    [198] It should be observed that, as in the Vedas, the Odyssey, the  Japanese _Ko-ji-ki_, as well as in barbaric and savage mythologies,  _Maerchen_ formulae abound in the Irish mythological cycle.          CHAPTER V.    THE TUATHA DE DANANN      The meaning formerly given to _Tuatha De Danann_ was \"the men of science  who were gods,\" _danann_ being here connected with _dan_, \"knowledge.\"  But the true meaning is \"the tribes _or_ folk of the goddess Danu,\"[199]  which agrees with the cognates _Tuatha_ or _Fir Dea_, \"tribes _or_ men  of the goddess.\" The name was given to the group, though Danu had only  three sons, Brian, Iuchar, and Iucharbar. Hence the group is also called  _fir tri ndea_, \"men of the three gods.\"[200] The equivalents in Welsh  story of Danu and her folk are Don and her children. We have seen that  though they are described as kings and warriors by the annalists, traces  of their divinity appear. In the Cuchulainn cycle they are supernatural  beings and sometimes demons, helping or harming men, and in the Fionn  cycle all these characteristics are ascribed to them. But the theory  which prevailed most is that which connected them with the hills or  mounds, the last resting-places of the mighty dead. Some of these bore  their names, while other beings were also associated with the mounds  (_sid_)--Fomorians and Milesian chiefs, heroes of the sagas, or those  who had actually been buried in them.[201] Legend told how, after the  defeat of the gods, the mounds were divided among them, the method of  division varying in different versions. In an early version the Tuatha  De Danann are immortal and the Dagda divides the _sid_.[202] But in a  poem of Flann Manistrech (_ob._ 1056) they are mortals and die.[203] Now  follows a regular chronology giving the dates of their reigns and their  deaths, as in the poem of Gilla Coemain (eleventh century).[204] Hence  another legend told how, Dagda being dead, Bodb Dearg divided the _sid_,  yet even here Manannan is said to have conferred immortality upon the  Tuatha De Danann.[205] The old pagan myths had shown that gods might  die, while in ritual their representatives were slain, and this may have  been the starting-point of the euhemerising process. But the divinity of  the Tuatha De Danann is still recalled. Eochaid O'Flynn (tenth century),  doubtful whether they are men or demons, concludes, \"though I have  treated of these deities in order, yet have I not adored them.\"[206]  Even in later times they were still thought of as gods in exile, a view  which appears in the romantic tales and sagas existing side by side with  the notices of the annalists. They were also regarded as fairy kings and  queens, and yet fairies of a different order from those of ordinary  tradition. They are \"fairies or sprites with corporeal forms, endowed  with immortality,\" and yet also _dei terreni_ or _side_ worshipped by  the folk before the coming of S. Patrick. Even the saint and several  bishops were called by the fair pagan daughters of King Loegaire, _fir  side_, \"men of the _sid_,\" that is, gods.[207] The _sid_ were named  after the names of the Tuatha De Danann who reigned in them, but the  tradition being localised in different places, several mounds were  sometimes connected with one god. The _sid_ were marvellous underground  palaces, full of strange things, and thither favoured mortals might go  for a time or for ever. In this they correspond exactly to the oversea  Elysium, the divine land.    But why were the Tuatha De Danann associated with the mounds? If fairies  or an analogous race of beings were already in pagan times connected  with hills or mounds, gods now regarded as fairies would be connected  with them. Dr. Joyce and O'Curry think that an older race of aboriginal  gods or _sid-folk_ preceded the Tuatha Dea in the mounds.[208] These may  have been the Fomorians, the \"champions of the _sid_,\" while in _Mesca  Ulad_ the Tuatha Dea go to the underground dwellings and speak with the  _side_ already there. We do not know that the fairy creed as such  existed in pagan times, but if the _side_ and the Tuatha De Danann were  once distinct, they were gradually assimilated. Thus the Dagda is called  \"king of the _side_\"; Aed Abrat and his daughters, Fand and Liban, and  Labraid, Liban's husband, are called _side_, and Manannan is Fand's  consort.[209] Labraid's island, like the _sid_ of Mider and the land to  which women of the _side_ invite Connla, differs but little from the  usual divine Elysium, while Mider, one of the _side_, is associated with  the Tuatha De Danann.[210] The _side_ are once said to be female, and  are frequently supernatural women who run away or marry mortals.[211]  Thus they may be a reminiscence of old Earth goddesses. But they are not  exclusively female, since there are kings of the _side_, and as the name  _Fir side_, \"men of the _side_,\" shows, while S. Patrick and his friends  were taken for _sid_-folk.    The formation of the legend was also aided by the old cult of the gods  on heights, some of them sepulchral mounds, and now occasionally sites  of Christian churches.[212] The Irish god Cenn Cruaich and his Welsh  equivalent Penn Cruc, whose name survives in _Pennocrucium_, have names  meaning \"chief _or_ head of the mound.\"[213] Other mounds or hills had  also a sacred character. Hence gods worshipped at mounds, dwelling or  revealing themselves there, still lingered in the haunted spots; they  became fairies, or were associated with the dead buried in the mounds,  as fairies also have been, or were themselves thought to have died and  been buried there. The haunting of the mounds by the old gods is seen in  a prayer of S. Columba's, who begs God to dispel \"this host (i.e. the  old gods) around the cairns that reigneth.\"[214] An early MS also tells  how the Milesians allotted the underground part of Erin to the Tuatha  Dea who now retired within the hills; in other words, they were gods of  the hills worshipped by the Milesians on hills.[215] But, as we shall  see, the gods dwelt elsewhere than in hills.[216]    Tumuli may already in pagan times have been pointed out as tombs of gods  who died in myth or ritual, like the tombs of Zeus in Crete and of  Osiris in Egypt. Again, fairies, in some aspects, are ghosts of the  dead, and haunt tumuli; hence, when gods became fairies they would do  the same. And once they were thought of as dead kings, any notable  tumuli would be pointed out as theirs, since it is a law in folk-belief  to associate tumuli or other structures not with the dead or with their  builders, but with supernatural or mythical or even historical  personages. If _side_ ever meant \"ghosts,\" it would be easy to call the  dead gods by this name, and to connect them with the places of the  dead.[217]    Many strands went to the weaving of the later conception of the gods,  but there still hung around them an air of mystery, and the belief that  they were a race of men was never consistent with itself.    Danu gave her name to the whole group of gods, and is called their  mother, like the Egyptian Neith or the Semitic Ishtar.[218] In the  annalists she is daughter of Dagda, and has three sons. She may be akin  to the goddess Anu, whom Cormac describes as \"_mater deorum  hibernensium_. It was well she nursed the gods.\" From her name he  derives _ana_, \"plenty,\" and two hills in Kerry are called \"the Paps of  Anu.\"[219] Thus as a goddess of plenty Danu or Anu may have been an  early"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14674"],[0,"Ten Great Religions: An Essay in Comparative Theology (#14)"],[1,"Du Halde, \"more laborious and  temperate than this. They are inured to hardships from their infancy,  which greatly contributes to preserve the innocence of their manners....  They are of a mild, tractable, and humane disposition.\" He thinks them  exceedingly modest, and regards the love of gain as their chief vice.  \"Interest,\" says he, \"is the spring of all their actions; for, when the  least profit offers, they despise all difficulties and undertake the most  painful journeys to procure it\" This may be true; but if a Chinese  traveller in America should give the same account of us, would it not be  quite as true? One of the latest writers--the author of \"The Middle  Kingdom\"--accuses the Chinese of gross sensuality, mendacity, and  dishonesty. No doubt these are besetting sins with them, as with all  nations who are educated under a system which makes submission to  authority the chief virtue. But then this writer lived only at Canton and  Macao, and saw personally only the refuse of the people. He admits that  \"they have attained, by the observance of peace and good order, to a high  security of life and property; that the various classes are linked  together in a remarkably homogeneous manner by the diffusion of education;  and that property and industry receive their just reward of food, raiment,  and shelter.\" He also reminds us that the religion of China differs from  all Pagan religions in this, that it encourages neither cruelty nor  sensuality. No human victims have ever been offered on its altars, and  those licentious rites which have appeared in so many religions have never  disgraced its pure worship.    The Chinese citizen enjoys a degree of order, peace, and comfort unknown  elsewhere in Asia. \"He can hold and sell landed property with a facility,  certainty, and security which is absolute perfection compared with the  nature of English dealings of the same kind.\"[22] He can traverse the  country for two thousand miles unquestioned by any official. He can  follow what occupation he pleases. He can quit his country and re-enter it  without a passport. The law of primogeniture does not exist. The emperor  appoints his heir, but a younger son quite as often as an elder one. The  principle that no man is entitled by birth to rule over them is better  known to the three hundred and sixty millions of China than to the  twenty-seven millions of Great Britain that they have a right to a trial  by their peers.[23] The principle of Chinese government is to persuade  rather than to compel, to use moral means rather than physical. This rests  on the fundamental belief in human goodness. For, as Mr. Meadows justly  observes: \"The theory that man's nature is radically vicious is the true  psychical basis of despotic or physical-force government; while the theory  that man's nature is radically good is the basis of free or moral-force  government.\" The Chinese government endeavors to be paternal. It has  refused to lay a tax on opium, because that would countenance the sale of  it, though it might derive a large income from such a tax. The sacred  literature of the Chinese is perfectly free from everything impure or  offensive. There is not a line but might be read aloud in any family  circle in England. All immoral ceremonies in idol worship are forbidden.  M. Hue says that the birth of a daughter is counted a disaster in China;  but well-informed travellers tell us that fathers go about with little  daughters on their arms, as proud and pleased as a European father could  be. Slavery and concubinage exist in China, and the husband has absolute  power over his wife, even of life and death. These customs tend to  demoralize the Chinese, and are a source of great evil. Woman is the slave  of man. The exception to this is in the case of a mother. She is absolute  in her household, and mothers, in China, command universal reverence. If  an officer asks leave of absence to visit his mother it must be granted  him. A mother may order an official to take her son to prison, and she  must be obeyed. As a wife without children woman is a slave, but as a  mother with grownup sons she is a monarch.        Sec. 8. The Tae-ping Insurrection.      Two extraordinary events have occurred in our day in China, the results of  which may be of the utmost importance to the nation and to mankind. The  one is the Tae-ping insurrection, the other the diplomatic mission of Mr.  Burlingame to the Western world. Whatever may be the immediate issue of  the great insurrection of our day against the Tartar dynasty, it will  remain a phenomenon of the utmost significance. There is no doubt,  notwithstanding the general opinion to the contrary, that it has been a  religious movement, proceeding from a single mind deeply moved by the  reading of the Bible. The hostility of the Chinese to the present Mantchoo  Tartar monarchs no doubt aided it; but there has been in it an element of  power from the beginning, derived, like that of the Puritans, from its  religious enthusiasm. Its leader, the Heavenly Prince, Hung-sew-tseuen,  son of a poor peasant living thirty miles northeast of Canton, received a  tract, containing extracts from the Chinese Bible of Dr. Morison, from a  Chinese tract distributor in the streets of Canton. This was in 1833, when  he was about twenty years of age. He took the book home, looked over it  carelessly, and threw it aside. Disappointed of his degree at two  competitive examinations, he fell sick, and saw a vision of an old man,  saying: \"I am the Creator of all things. Go and do my work.\" After this  vision six years passed by, when the English war broke out, and the  English fleet took the Chinese forts in the river of Canton. Such a great  national calamity indicated, according to Chinese ideas, something rotten  in the government; and such success on the part of the English showed  that, in some way, they were fulfilling the will of Heaven. This led  Hung-sew-tseuen to peruse again his Christian books; and alone, with no  guide, he became a sincere believer in Christ, after a fashion of his own.  God was the Creator of all things, and the Supreme Father. Jesus was the  Elder Brother and heavenly Teacher of mankind. Idolatry was to be  overthrown, virtue to be practised. Hung-sew-tseuen believed that the  Bible confirmed his former visions. He accepted his mission and began to  make converts All his converts renounced idolatry, and gave up the worship  of Confucius. They travelled to and fro teaching, and formed a society of  \"God-worshippers.\" The first convert, Fung-yun-san, became its most ardent  missionary and its disinterested preacher. Hung-sew-tseuen returned home,  went to Canton, and there met Mr. Roberts, an American missionary, who was  induced by false charges to refuse him Christian baptism. But he, without  being offended with Mr. Roberts, went home and taught his converts how to  baptize themselves. The society of \"God-worshippers\" increased in number.  Some of them were arrested for destroying idols, and among them  Fung-yun-san, who, however, on his way to prison, converted the policemen  by his side. These new converts set him at liberty and went away with him  as his disciples. Various striking phenomena occurred in this society. Men  fell into a state of ecstasy and delivered exhortations. Sick persons were  cured by the power of prayer. The teachings of these ecstatics were tested  by Scripture; if found to agree therewith, they were accepted; if not,  rejected.    It was in October, 1850, that this religious movement assumed a political  form. A large body of persons, in a state of chronic rebellion against the  Chinese authorities, had fled into the district, and joined the  \"God-worshippers.\" Pursued by the imperial soldiers, they were protected  against them. Hence war began. The leaders of the religious movement found  themselves compelled to choose between submission and resistance. They  resisted, and the great insurrection began. But in China an insurrection  against the dynasty is in the natural order of things. Indeed, it may be  said to be a part of the constitution. By the Sacred Books, taught in all  the schools and made a part of the examination papers, it is the duty of  the people to overthrow any bad government. The Chinese have no power to  legislate, do not tax themselves, and the government is a pure autocracy.  But it is not a despotism; for old usages make a constitution, which the  government must respect or be overthrown. \"The right to rebel,\" says Mr.  Meadows, \"is in China a chief element of national stability.\" The  Tae-ping (or Universal-Peace) Insurrection has shown its religious  character throughout. It has not been cruel, except in retaliation. At the  taking of Nan-king orders were given to put all the women together and  protect them, and any one doing them an injury was punished with death.  Before the attack on Nan-king a large body of the insurgents knelt down  and prayed, and then rose and fought, like the soldiers of Cromwell. The  aid of a large body of rebels was refused, because they did not renounce  idolatry, and continued to allow the use of opium. Hymns of praise to the  Heavenly Father and Elder Brother were chanted in the camp. And the head  of the insurrection distinctly announced that, in case it succeeded, the  Bible would be substituted in all public examinations for office in the  place of Confucius. This would cause the Bible to be at once studied by  all candidates for office among three hundred and sixty millions of  people. It would constitute the greatest event in the history of  Christianity since the days of Constantino, or at least since the  conversion of the Teutonic races. The rebellion has probably failed; but  great results must follow this immense interest in Christianity in the  heart of China,--an interest awakened by no Christian mission, whether  Catholic or Protestant, but coming down into this great nation like"]]]
