Few girls, if any, take to the streets until they have been  seduced; and the antecedents of seduction are the morbid exaggeration  of the sexual appetite, the lack of self-control, and the selfish  hedonism which youthful impurity engenders.    The selfishness, and consequent blindness to cruelty, of which I  write, manifests itself quite early. A boy of chivalrous feeling,  whose blood would boil at any other form of outrage on a girl, will  read a newspaper account of rape or indecent assault with a pleasure  so intense that indignation and disgust are quite crowded out of his  mind.    If, repelled by the coarseness of the streets, the young man allows  lust or passion to lead him into seduction, he commits a crime the  consequences of which are usually cruel in the extreme; for in most  cases the seduced girl sinks of necessity into prostitution. So blind,  so callous does impurity make even the refined and generous, that many  a young man who can be a good son, a good brother, a noble friend, a  patriotic citizen, will doom a girl whose only fault is that she is  physically attractive--and possibly too affectionate and trusting--to  torturing anxiety, to illness, to the horrible suffering of undesired  travail, to disgrace, and in nineteen cases out of twenty to ostracism  and the infamy of the streets. Murder is a small thing compared with  this. Who would not rather that his daughter were killed in her  innocence than that she should be doomed to such a fate?    Many young men are ignorant of the fact that sexual relations with  prostitutes frequently result in the foulest and most terrible of  diseases. Venereal diseases, as these are called, commence in the  private parts themselves, but the poison which they engender soon  attacks other parts of the body and often wrecks the general health.  It gives rise to loathsome skin disease, to degeneration of the  nervous system and paralysis, to local disease in the heart, lungs,  and digestive organs, and to such lowering of vitality as renders the  body an easy prey to disease generally. No one is justified in looking  upon this risk as a matter of merely private concern. Health is of  supreme importance not merely to the personal happiness and success of  the man himself, but also to the services he can render to his  friends, to his nation, and to humanity. Even if a young man is  foolish enough to risk his happiness and success for the sake of  animal enjoyment, he cannot without base selfishness and disloyalty  disregard the duties he owes to others. Further, the man who suffers  from venereal disease is certain to pass its poison on to his wife and  children--cursing thus with unspeakable misery those whom of all  others it is his duty to protect and bless.    One cannot help feeling at times that the blessings of home--and of  the monogamy which makes home possible--are terribly discounted by a  condition of things which offer a young man no other alternatives to  chastity than these terrible evils. Now that year by year the rising  standard of living and the increased exactions which the State makes  on the industrious and provident cause marriage to be a luxury too  expensive for many, and delayed unduly for most, the problem of social  purity becomes ever greater and more urgent. The instruction of the  young in relation to sex provides the only solution, and is, I venture  to think, incomparably the most important social reform now needed.    I am confident that a boy who receives wise training and sex guidance  from his early days will never find lust the foul and uncontrollable  element which it is to-day in the lives of most men; that in a few  generations our nation could be freed from the seething corruption  which poisons its life; and that, while freer scope could be given to  the ineffable joys of pure sexual love, very much could be done to  diminish the awful misery and degradation engendered by lust.    If children had from their infancy an instinctive and growing desire  for alcohol, with secret and unrestrained means of gratifying it; if  by its indulgence this desire grew into an overmastering craving; if  throughout childhood they received no word of warning or guidance from  the good, but were tempted and corrupted by the evil, we should have a  nation in which most men and women were drunkards, ready to break all  laws--human and divine--which stood in the way of an imperious need; a  nation in which, among those who declined to yield to iniquity, the  craving for drink caused unceasing and life-long struggle.    On the young man of to-day we lay a burden which no ordinary man was  ever yet able to bear. His boyhood and youth become, through  ignorance, the prey of lust; his passions become tyrannous; his will  is enslaved. Even if he contracts marriage, his troubles are not at an  end, for man, _as an animal_, is neither monogamous nor wholly  constant. His neglected sex-education makes him far more susceptible  to physical attractions than to those qualities which make a wife a  good companion, a good housekeeper, and a good mother; and but too  often, as a result, the beneficent influence of marriage is transient;  the domestic atmosphere ceases to be congenial; both husband and wife  become susceptible to other attachments, and the old struggle begins  all over again.          CHAPTER V.    SEX KNOWLEDGE IS COMPATIBLE WITH PERFECT REFINEMENT AND INNOCENCE.      The reader who has followed me through the preceding chapters will, I  hope, feel that, whatever objections there may be to giving explicit  instruction on sex matters to the young, such instruction is immensely  to be preferred to the almost inevitable perversion which follows  ignorance. If we had to choose between a state of \"innocence\" and a  state of reverent knowledge, many people would doubtless incline to  the former. No such option exists. Our choice lies between leaving a  lad to pick up information from vulgar and unclean minds, and giving  it ourselves in such a manner as to invest it from the first with  sacredness and dignity.    Even if the reader is still inclined to think that sex-knowledge is,  at best, an unholy secret, he will hardly doubt that it can be  divulged with less injury by an adult who is earnestly anxious for the  child's welfare than by coarse and irreverent lips.    I am not content to leave the reader in this dilemma. I am confident  that the following words of Canon Lyttelton spring from the truest  spiritual insight: \"To a lover of nature, no less than to a convinced  Christian, the subject ought to wear an aspect not only negatively  innocent, but positively beautiful. It is a recurrent miracle, and yet  the very type and embodiment of law; and it may be confidently  affirmed that, in spite of the blundering of many generations, there  is nothing in a normally-constituted child's mind which refuses to  take in the subject from this point of view, provided that the right  presentation of it is the first.\"    Nothing more forcibly convicts the present system of the evil which  lies at its door than the current beliefs on this subject. At present,  sexual knowledge is picked up from the gutter and the cesspool; and no  purification can free it entirely in many minds from its original  uncleanness.        \"Love's a virtue for heroes!--as white as the snow on high hills,      And immortal as every great soul is that struggles, endures,              and fulfils.\"    This is the prophet's belief, and yet, putting on one side those who  actually delight in uncleanness, there appear to be many people who  look upon the marriage certificate as a licence to impurity, and upon  sexual union as a form of animal indulgence to which we are so  strongly impelled that even the most refined are tempted by it into an  act of conscious indelicacy and sin. Such people read literally the  psalmist's words: \"Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my  mother conceive me.\" It is surely some such feeling as this which  makes parents shrink from referring to the subject, which underlies  the constant use of the word \"innocence\" as the aptest description of  a state of mind which precedes the acquisition of sexual knowledge.    That individuals, at least, have risen to a loftier conception than  this is certain; and the only possible explanations of the prevalence  of the current idea are that sex-knowledge has almost always been  obtained from a tainted source; and that, while the coarse have not  merely whispered their views in the ear in the closet, but have, in  all ages, proclaimed them from the house-tops, the refined have hardly  whispered their ideas, much less discussed them publicly. Children  growing up with perverted views have listened to the loud assertions  of disputants on the one side, have witnessed the demoralisation which  so often attends the sexual passion, but have received no hint of what  may be said on the other side of the question.    An instructed public opinion would be horrified at our sovereign's  taking shares in a slave-trading expedition as Queen Elizabeth did. We  are aghast at the days when crowds went forth to enjoy the torture at  the stake of those from whom they differed merely on some metaphysical  point. We have even begun to be restless under man's cruel domination  over the animal creation. But we have made far less advance in our  conceptions on sexual matters; and we are content here with ideas  which were current in Elizabethan days. But for this, no passion for  conservatism, no reverence for a liturgy endeared by centuries of use,  could induce us to tell every bride as she stands before God's altar  that it is one of her functions to provide an outlet for her  husband's passion and a safeguard against fornication. Lust is at  least as degrading in married life as it is outside it.

Banish from thy innermost heart each profane and  carnal thought, for to harbour such while in this place were a deadly  impiety.\"    The knight laid aside his shoes as he was commanded, and the hermit  stood in the meanwhile as if communing with his soul in secret prayer,  and when he again moved, commanded the knight to knock at the wicket  three times. He did so. The door opened spontaneously--at least Sir  Kenneth beheld no one--and his senses were at once assailed by a stream  of the purest light, and by a strong and almost oppressive sense of the  richest perfumes. He stepped two or three paces back, and it was the  space of a minute ere he recovered the dazzling and overpowering effects  of the sudden change from darkness to light.    When he entered the apartment in which this brilliant lustre was  displayed, he perceived that the light proceeded from a combination of  silver lamps, fed with purest oil, and sending forth the richest odours,  hanging by silver chains from the roof of a small Gothic chapel, hewn,  like most part of the hermit's singular mansion, out of the sound and  solid rock. But whereas, in every other place which Sir Kenneth had  seen, the labour employed upon the rock had been of the simplest and  coarsest description, it had in this chapel employed the invention and  the chisels of the most able architects. The groined roofs rose from six  columns on each side, carved with the rarest skill; and the manner in  which the crossings of the concave arches were bound together, as it  were, with appropriate ornaments, were all in the finest tone of the  architecture of the age. Corresponding to the line of pillars, there  were on each side six richly-wrought niches, each of which contained the  image of one of the twelve apostles.    At the upper and eastern end of the chapel stood the altar, behind  which a very rich curtain of Persian silk, embroidered deeply with gold,  covered a recess, containing, unquestionably, some image or relic of no  ordinary sanctity, in honour of which this singular place of worship  had been erected, Under the persuasion that this must be the case, the  knight advanced to the shrine, and kneeling down before it, repeated his  devotions with fervency, during which his attention was disturbed by the  curtain being suddenly raised, or rather pulled aside, how or by whom he  saw not; but in the niche which was thus disclosed he beheld a cabinet  of silver and ebony, with a double folding-door, the whole formed into  the miniature resemblance of a Gothic church.    As he gazed with anxious curiosity on the shrine, the two folding-doors  also flew open, discovering a large piece of wood, on which were  blazoned the words, VERA CRUX; at the same time a choir of female voices  sung GLORIA PATRI. The instant the strain had ceased, the shrine was  closed, and the curtain again drawn, and the knight who knelt at the  altar might now continue his devotions undisturbed, in honour of the  holy relic which had been just disclosed to his view. He did this under  the profound impression of one who had witnessed, with his own eyes, an  awful evidence of the truth of his religion; and it was some time ere,  concluding his orisons, he arose, and ventured to look around him for  the hermit, who had guided him to this sacred and mysterious spot. He  beheld him, his head still muffled in the veil which he had himself  wrapped around it, crouching, like a rated hound, upon the threshold of  the chapel; but, apparently, without venturing to cross it--the holiest  reverence, the most penitential remorse, was expressed by his posture,  which seemed that of a man borne down and crushed to the earth by the  burden of his inward feelings. It seemed to the Scot that only the  sense of the deepest penitence, remorse, and humiliation could have thus  prostrated a frame so strong and a spirit so fiery.    He approached him as if to speak; but the recluse anticipated his  purpose, murmuring in stifled tones, from beneath the fold in which his  head was muffled, and which sounded like a voice proceeding from the  cerements of a corpse,--\"Abide, abide--happy thou that mayest--the  vision is not yet ended.\" So saying, he reared himself from the ground,  drew back from the threshold on which he had hitherto lain prostrate,  and closed the door of the chapel, which, secured by a spring bolt  within, the snap of which resounded through the place, appeared so much  like a part of the living rock from which the cavern was hewn, that  Kenneth could hardly discern where the aperture had been. He was now  alone in the lighted chapel which contained the relic to which he had  lately rendered his homage, without other arms than his dagger, or other  companion than his pious thoughts and dauntless courage.    Uncertain what was next to happen, but resolved to abide the course of  events, Sir Kenneth paced the solitary chapel till about the time of the  earliest cock-crowing. At this dead season, when night and morning met  together, he heard, but from what quarter he could not discover, the  sound of such a small silver bell as is rung at the elevation of the  host in the ceremony, or sacrifice, as it has been called, of the mass.  The hour and the place rendered the sound fearfully solemn, and, bold as  he was, the knight withdrew himself into the farther nook of the  chapel, at the end opposite to the altar, in order to observe, without  interruption, the consequences of this unexpected signal.    He did not wait long ere the silken curtain was again withdrawn, and the  relic again presented to his view. As he sunk reverentially on his knee,  he heard the sound of the lauds, or earliest office of the Catholic  Church, sung by female voices, which united together in the performance  as they had done in the former service. The knight was soon aware that  the voices were no longer stationary in the distance, but approached the  chapel and became louder, when a door, imperceptible when closed, like  that by which he had himself entered, opened on the other side of the  vault, and gave the tones of the choir more room to swell along the  ribbed arches of the roof.    The knight fixed his eyes on the opening with breathless anxiety, and,  continuing to kneel in the attitude of devotion which the place and  scene required, expected the consequence of these preparations. A  procession appeared about to issue from the door. First, four beautiful  boys, whose arms, necks, and legs were bare, showing the bronze  complexion of the East, and contrasting with the snow-white tunics  which they wore, entered the chapel by two and two. The first pair bore  censers, which they swung from side to side, adding double fragrance  to the odours with which the chapel already was impregnated. The second  pair scattered flowers.    After these followed, in due and majestic order, the females who  composed the choir--six, who from their black scapularies, and black  veils over their white garments, appeared to be professed nuns of the  order of Mount Carmel; and as many whose veils, being white, argued them  to be novices, or occasional inhabitants in the cloister, who were  not as yet bound to it by vows. The former held in their hands large  rosaries, while the younger and lighter figures who followed carried  each a chaplet of red and white roses. They moved in procession around  the chapel, without appearing to take the slightest notice of Kenneth,  although passing so near him that their robes almost touched him, while  they continued to sing. The knight doubted not that he was in one of  those cloisters where the noble Christian maidens had formerly openly  devoted themselves to the services of the church. Most of them had been  suppressed since the Mohammedans had reconquered Palestine, but many,  purchasing connivance by presents, or receiving it from the clemency  or contempt of the victors, still continued to observe in private the  ritual to which their vows had consecrated them. Yet, though Kenneth  knew this to be the case, the solemnity of the place and hour, the  surprise at the sudden appearance of these votaresses, and the  visionary manner in which they moved past him, had such influence on his  imagination that he could scarce conceive that the fair procession  which he beheld was formed of creatures of this world, so much did  they resemble a choir of supernatural beings, rendering homage to the  universal object of adoration.    Such was the knight's first idea, as the procession passed him, scarce  moving, save just sufficiently to continue their progress; so that,  seen by the shadowy and religious light which the lamps shed through the  clouds of incense which darkened the apartment, they appeared rather to  glide than to walk.    But as a second time, in surrounding the chapel, they passed the spot on  which he kneeled, one of the white-stoled maidens, as she glided by him,  detached from the chaplet which she carried a rosebud, which dropped  from her fingers, perhaps unconsciously, on the foot of Sir Kenneth. The  knight started as if a dart had suddenly struck his person; for, when  the mind is wound up to a high pitch of feeling and expectation,  the slightest incident, if unexpected, gives fire to the train  which imagination has already laid. But he suppressed his emotion,  recollecting how easily an incident so indifferent might have happened,  and that it was only the uniform monotony of the movement of the  choristers which made the incident in the slightest degree remarkable.    Still, while the procession, for the third time, surrounded the chapel,  the thoughts and the eyes of Kenneth followed exclusively the one among  the novices who had dropped the rosebud. Her step, her face, her form  were so completely assimilated to the rest of the choristers that it  was impossible to perceive the"]]]
