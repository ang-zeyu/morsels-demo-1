Most  artistic in point of manufacture. Beautifully bound from special  artistic cover designs. Beautifully printed at the celebrated  UNIVERSITY PRESS of JOHN WILSON & SONS, Cambridge, Mass.    A SPELLING AND PRONOUNCING DICTIONARY, RATHER THAN A DEFINING ONE.    It has over eleven thousand words, with the pronunciation indicated in  a simple manner by a new system of diacritical marks, specially cast  for this book.    The New Imperial, Webster, Stormonth, Worcester and all other standard  Dictionaries have been constantly consulted and critically compared in  its preparation.    ITS OBJECT.    While not underrating the primary importance of definition and  philology in a work of reference, it is believed--nay, more than  that--it is known that there is a positive demand for a book showing  the correct pronunciation and spelling of every prominent word in the  language, which book should be in a convenient portable form for the  pocket, the writing-case, or the reading-table. This is the first time  that any serious attempt has been made to satisfy this call.    ITS TRUSTWORTHINESS.    In this respect, recognizing that what was wished for was not  originality, but confidence in the accuracy of the book; the  labor, while almost endless, has been strictly confined to critical  comparisons of authorities and the proper adjustment of differences of  opinion.    HOW WE OFFER IT FOR SALE.    On receipt of price, FIFTY CENTS, (and as compared with the prices of  most other books it would be well worth $1.00,) we will forward it to  any address in the United States for examination. If not satisfactory  it may be returned, when the money will be refunded; provided, of  course, it is received in good order and within reasonable time.    PUBLISHING DAY.    It will be published about August 1st, 1888. The great amount of labor  involved in its preparation, as compared with its small size, requires  this delay.

And how could it deal hardly with him--the loving, simple, childlike old  man?    So it smoothed out the wrinkles that were in the old forehead, and fixed  the passing smile, and sealed the eyes that they might not weep again;  and then the short sleep of time was melted into the long, long sleep of  eternity.    \"How has he grown so young in this one night?\" they said when they found  him in the morning.    Yes, dear old man; to such as you time brings no age. You die with the  purity and innocence of your childhood upon you, though you die in your  grey hairs.        Chapter 1.IX. He Sees A Ghost.    Bonaparte stood on the ash-heap. He espied across the plain a moving  speck and he chucked his coat-tails up and down in expectancy of a  scene.    The wagon came on slowly. Waldo laid curled among the sacks at the  back of the wagon, the hand in his breast resting on the sheep-shearing  machine. It was finished now. The right thought had struck him the  day before as he sat, half asleep, watching the water go over the  mill-wheel. He muttered to himself with half-closed eyes:    \"Tomorrow smooth the cogs--tighten the screws a little--show it to  them.\" Then after a pause--\"Over the whole world--the whole world--mine,  that I have made!\" He pressed the little wheels and pulleys in his  pocket till they cracked. Presently his muttering became louder--\"And  fifty pounds--a black hat for my dadda--for Lyndall a blue silk,  very light; and one purple like the earth-bells, and white shoes.\" He  muttered on--\"A box full, full of books. They shall tell me all, all,  all,\" he added, moving his fingers desiringly: \"why the crystals grow in  such beautiful shapes; why lightning runs to the iron; why black people  are black; why the sunlight makes things warm. I shall read, read,  read,\" he muttered slowly. Then came over him suddenly what he called  \"The presence of God\"; a sense of a good, strong something folding him  round. He smiled through his half-shut eyes. \"Ah, Father, my own Father,  it is so sweet to feel you, like the warm sunshine. The Bibles and books  cannot tell of you and all I feel you. They are mixed with men's words;  but you--\"    His muttering sank into inaudible confusion, till, opening his eyes  wide, it struck him that the brown plain he looked at was the old home  farm. For half an hour they had been riding in it, and he had not known  it. He roused the leader, who sat nodding on the front of the wagon  in the early morning sunlight. They were within half a mile of the  homestead. It seemed to him that he had been gone from them all a year.  He fancied he could see Lyndall standing on the brick wall to watch for  him; his father, passing from one house to the other, stopping to look.    He called aloud to the oxen. For each one at home he had brought  something. For his father a piece of tobacco, bought at the shop by the  mill; for Em a thimble; for Lyndall a beautiful flower dug out by  the roots, at a place where they had outspanned; for Tant Sannie a  handkerchief. When they drew near the house he threw the whip to  the Kaffer leader, and sprung from the side of the wagon to run on.  Bonaparte stopped him as he ran past the ash-heap.    \"Good morning, my dear boy. Where are you running to so fast with your  rosy cheeks?\"    The boy looked up at him, glad even to see Bonaparte.    \"I am going to the cabin,\" he said, out of breath.    \"You won't find them in just now--not your good old father,\" said  Bonaparte.    \"Where is he?\" asked the lad.    \"There, beyond the camps,\" said Bonaparte, waving his hand oratorically  toward the stone-walled ostrich-camps.    \"What is he doing there?\" asked the boy.    Bonaparte patted him on the cheek kindly.    \"We could not keep him any more, it was too hot. We've buried him,  my boy,\" said Bonaparte, touching with his finger the boy's cheek. \"We  couldn't keep him any more. He, he, he!\" laughed Bonaparte, as the boy  fled away along the low stone wall, almost furtively, as one in fear.    *****    At five o'clock Bonaparte knelt before a box in the German's room. He  was busily unpacking it.    It had been agreed upon between Tant Sannie and himself, that now the  German was gone he, Bonaparte, was to be no longer schoolmaster, but  overseer of the farm. In return for his past scholastic labours he had  expressed himself willing to take possession of the dead man's goods  and room. Tant Sannie hardly liked the arrangement. She had a great  deal more respect for the German dead than the German living, and would  rather his goods had been allowed to descend peacefully to his son. For  she was a firm believer in the chinks in the world above, where not only  ears, but eyes might be applied to see how things went on in this world  below. She never felt sure how far the spirit-world might overlap this  world of sense, and, as a rule, prudently abstained from doing anything  which might offend unseen auditors. For this reason she abstained from  ill-using the dead Englishman's daughter and niece, and for this reason  she would rather the boy had had his father's goods. But it was hard to  refuse Bonaparte anything when she and he sat so happily together in the  evening drinking coffee, Bonaparte telling her in the broken Dutch he  was fast learning how he adored fat women, and what a splendid farmer he  was.    So at five o'clock on this afternoon Bonaparte knelt in the German's  room.    \"Somewhere, here it is,\" he said, as he packed the old clothes carefully  out of the box, and, finding nothing, packed them in again. \"Somewhere  in this room it is; and if it's here Bonaparte finds it,\" he repeated.  \"You didn't stay here all these years without making a little pile  somewhere, my lamb. You weren't such a fool as you looked. Oh, no!\" said  Bonaparte.    He now walked about the room, diving his fingers in everywhere: sticking  them into the great crevices in the wall and frightening out the  spiders; rapping them against the old plaster till it cracked and fell  in pieces; peering up the chimney, till the soot dropped on his bald  head and blackened it. He felt in little blue bags; he tried to raise  the hearth-stone; he shook each book, till the old leaves fell down in  showers on the floor.    It was getting dark, and Bonaparte stood with his finger on his nose  reflecting. Finally he walked to the door, behind which hung the  trousers and waistcoat the dead man had last worn. He had felt in them,  but hurriedly, just after the funeral the day before; he would examine  them again. Sticking his fingers into the waistcoat pockets, he found in  one corner a hole. Pressing his hand through it, between the lining and  the cloth, he presently came into contact with something. Bonaparte drew  it forth--a small, square parcel, sewed up in sail-cloth. He gazed at  it, squeezed it; it cracked, as though full of bank-notes. He put it  quickly into his own waistcoat pocket, and peeped over the half-door to  see if there was any one coming. There was nothing to be seen but the  last rays of yellow sunset light, painting the karoo bushes in the  plain, and shining on the ash-heap, where the fowls were pecking. He  turned and sat down on the nearest chair, and, taking out his pen-knife,  ripped the parcel open. The first thing that fell was a shower of yellow  faded papers. Bonaparte opened them carefully one by one, and smoothed  them out on his knee. There was something very valuable to be hidden so  carefully, though the German characters he could not decipher. When he  came to the last one, he felt there was something hard in it.    \"You've got it, Bon, my boy! you've got it!\" he cried, slapping his leg  hard. Edging nearer to the door, for the light was fading, he opened the  paper carefully. There was nothing inside but a plain gold wedding-ring.    \"Better than nothing!\" said Bonaparte, trying to put it on his little  finger, which, however, proved too fat.    He took it off and set it down on the table before him, and looked at it  with his crosswise eyes.    \"When that auspicious hour, Sannie,\" he said, \"shall have arrived, when,  panting, I shall lead thee, lighted by Hymen's torch, to the connubial  altar, then upon thy fair amaranthine finger, my joyous bride, shall  this ring repose.         \"Thy fair body, oh, my girl,        Shall Bonaparte possess;        His fingers in thy money-bags,        He therein, too, shall mess.\"    Having given utterance to this flood of poesy, he sat lost in joyous  reflection.    \"He therein, too, shall mess,\" he repeated meditatively.    At this instant, as Bonaparte swore, and swore truly to the end of his  life, a slow and distinct rap was given on the crown of his bald head.    Bonaparte started and looked up. No riem or strap, hung down from  the rafters above, and not a human creature was near the door. It  was growing dark; he did not like it. He began to fold up the papers  expeditiously. He stretched out his hand for the ring. The ring was  gone! Gone, although no human creature had entered the room; gone,  although no form had crossed the doorway. Gone!    He would not sleep there, that was certain.    He stuffed the papers into his pocket. As he did so, three slow and  distinct taps were given on the crown of his head. Bonaparte's jaw fell:  each separate joint lost its power: he could not move; he dared not  rise; his tongue lay loose in his mouth.    \"Take all, take all!\" he gurgled in his throat. \"I--I do not want them.  Take\"--    Here a resolute tug at the grey curls at the back of his head caused him  to leap up, yelling wildly. Was he to sit still paralyzed, to be dragged  away bodily to the devil? With terrific shrieks he fled, casting no  glance behind.    *****    When the dew was falling, and the evening was dark, a small figure moved  toward the gate of the furthest ostrich-camp, driving a bird before it.  When the "]]]
