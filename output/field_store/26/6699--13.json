[Sidenote: Neutral Territory protected.]    The Rights of War can be exercised only within the territory of the  belligerent powers, upon the high seas, or in a territory belonging to  no one. To make use of neutral territory for the _proximate_ purposes  of war cannot be allowed, although it is to be understood that the  prohibition does not extend to remote objects and uses, such as  procuring provisions, and other innocent articles.[143]    The sanctity of a claim of territory is very high. When the fact is  established, it overrules every other consideration; the property  taken must be restored, notwithstanding that it belongs to the enemy;  and if the captors should have erred wilfully, and not merely through  ignorance, he would be subject to further punishment. It is however, a  point on which foreign states are very likely to be misinformed and  abused, by the interested representations of those who are anxious to  catch at their protection. The claim of territory is, therefore, to be  taken according to the letter of the law, and to be made out by clear  and unimpeached evidence. The right of seizing the property of the  enemy is a right which extends, generally speaking, _universally_,  wherever that property is found. The protection of neutral territory  is an exception only to the rule; it is not therefore to be considered  disrespectful to any government that the fact, on which such claims  are founded, should be accurately examined.[144]    The neutral territory is supposed to extend three English miles from  the shore.[145]    [Sidenote: Property of Belligerents in Neutral Territory.]    But the general inviolability of neutral character goes further than  merely the protection of neutral property. It protects the property of  belligerents within the neutral territory. Thus, if the enemy be  attacked, or any capture made under neutral protection, the neutral is  bound to redress the injury, and effect restitution. As for example,  in 1793, the English ship Grange was captured in Delaware Bay, by a  French frigate, and upon due complaint, the American Government caused  the British ship to be promptly restored. Similarly, in the case of  the Anna, restoration was made of property captured by a British  cruizer near the mouth of the Mississippi, and within the jurisdiction  of the United States.[146]    An armed ship has no right to lie in a neutral harbour, in order to  make it an habitual _station_ for her captures, as that would be a  continuous direct infringement on neutral trade with the enemy; but if  she is accidentally in a neutral port, and sees an enemy coming, she  may go out and fight, or take her, beyond the range of neutral  ground.[147] Nor ought captors to station themselves at the mouth of a  neutral river for exercising the rights of war from that river, much  less in the very river itself.[148]    The doctrine is carried to the extent that no use of a neutral  territory for the purposes of war is to be permitted; this does not  include _remote_ uses, such as procuring provisions and refreshments,  and acts of that nature, which the law of nations universally  tolerates; but that no _proximate_ acts of war, in any manner, are to  be allowed to originate on neutral grounds;--thus a ship has no right  to station herself in neutral waters, and then to send out her boats  on hostile enterprises beyond the boundary. This is a _direct hostile  use_ of the neutral territory, and many instances have occurred in  which such an irregular use of neutral territory has been warmly  resented. Nor can the neutral, in true consistency with his  neutrality, permit such a course of war.[149]    [Sidenote: Vessels chased into a Neutral Port.]    Bynkershoek has maintained the anomalous principle, that vessels may  be chased into a Neutral Territory, and there captured; but there is  in reality no exception to the rule, that every voluntary entrance  into a neutral territory, with hostile purposes, is absolutely  unlawful.    But this restoration takes place only on the application of the  neutral government whose territory has been thus violated, the  neutrality alone being the ground of the invalidity of the  capture.[150]    [Sidenote: Consent of Neutral State necessary.]    Though a belligerent vessel may not enter within neutral jurisdiction  for hostile purposes, she may, consistently with a state of neutrality  (unless prohibited by the neutral power), bring her prize into the  neutral port and sell it there.    [Sidenote: Freedom of Neutral Commerce.]    A neutral has a right to pursue his accustomed commerce, and he may  become the carrier of the enemy's goods, without being subject to  confiscation of the ship, or of the neutral articles on board; though  not without the risk of having the voyage interrupted by the seizure  of the hostile property. If we find an enemy's effects on board a  neutral ship, we seize them by right of war; but we are naturally  bound to pay the freight to the master of the vessel, who is not to  suffer by such seizure.[151]    The effects of neutrals found in an enemy's ship, are to be restored  to the owners, against whom there is no right of confiscation,--but  without allowance for detainder, decay, &c. Neutrals voluntarily  expose themselves to these accidents by embarking their goods in a  hostile ship.[152]    We have before mentioned that neutral ships do not afford protection  to an enemy's property. It may be seized if found on board of a  neutral vessel, _beyond the limits of the neutral jurisdiction_. This  is a clear and well-settled principle of the Law of Nations.    When an enemy's ship, containing free goods, is taken, if the captor  carries the goods to the port of destination, he is entitled to the  freight. He stands in the place of the _owner of the ship_, and  performs (by completing) the specific contract between the owner and  charterer. But he _is not_ entitled, if he does _not_ proceed and  perform the original voyage.[153] The specific contract is performed  in the one case, and not in the other. But freight will be allowed to  the captor, even though he does not carry the goods to the port of  destination, if he carries them to his own country, and to the ports  to which they would have been consigned, if not prevented by the  regulations of the country of embarkation.[154]    Under certain circumstances the _Captor_ is considered entitled to  Freight, even though the goods are carried to his own country, and  restored.    If the captor does anything to injure the property, or is guilty of  misconduct, he may remain answerable for the effect of such misconduct  or injury, in the way of set-off against him.[155]    No right of _visitation_ and search, of capture, nor any other kind of  belligerent right, can be exercised on board a _public neutral_ vessel  on the high seas. But _private_ vessels form no part of neutral  territory, and when within the limits of another state, are not exempt  from local jurisdiction.[156]    The right to take enemy's property on board a neutral ship has been  much contested by particular nations, whose interests it strongly  opposed. This rule has been steadily maintained in Great Britain,  though in France and other countries it has been fluctuating. For the  first time, England has voluntarily abandoned this right in the  present war.    If a neutral vessel, having enemy's goods on board, is taken, and  there is nothing unfair in the conduct of the neutral master, he will  even be entitled to his reasonable demurrage. The captor pays the  whole freight, because he represents the enemy, by possessing himself  of the enemy's goods by right of war; and although the whole freight  has not been earned by the completion of the voyage, yet as the  captor, by his act of seizure, has prevented its completion, his  seizure operates to the same effect as an actual delivery of the goods  to the consignee, and subjects him to the payment of the full  freight.[157] In such case, however, the neutral master must have  acted _bona fide_, and with strictly neutral conduct.    [Sidenote: This Rule Changed by Convention.]    This Rule is often Changed by Convention; and it is generally  stipulated that \"_free ships shall make free goods_.\" The converse,  though also sometimes the subject of treaty, does not of necessity  hold, _enemy's ships do not make enemy's goods_. Goods of neutrals,  found on enemy's ships, are bound to be restored.[158]    A neutral subject is at liberty to put his goods on board a merchant  vessel, though belonging to a belligerent, subject nevertheless to the  rights of the enemy who may capture the vessel; who has no right,  according to modern practice, to condemn the neutral property. Neither  will the goods of the neutral be subject to condemnation, although a  rescue should be attempted by the crew of the captured vessel, for  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13882"],[0,"John Thorndyke's Cases (#14)"],[1,"happens. He left almost the whole of his property--about  eighty thousand pounds--to his son, the widow to have a life-interest in  it. He also left to his late brother's daughter, Lucy, fifty pounds a  year, and to his surviving brother Percy, who seems to have been a  good-for-nothing, a hundred a year for life. But--and here is the utter  folly of the thing--if the son should die, the property was to be  equally divided between the brother and the niece, with the exception of  five hundred a year for life to the widow. It was an insane  arrangement.\"    \"Quite,\" I agreed, \"and a very dangerous one for Lucy Haldean, as things  are at present.\"    \"Very; especially if anything should have happened to the child.\"    \"What are you going to do now?\" I inquired, seeing that Thorndyke rode  on as if with a definite purpose.    \"There is a footpath through the wood,\" he replied. \"I want to examine  that. And there is a house behind the wood which I should like to see.\"    \"The house of the mysterious stranger,\" I suggested.    \"Precisely. Mysterious and solitary strangers invite inquiry.\"    We drew up at the entrance to the footpath, leaving Willett the coachman  in charge of the three machines, and proceeded up the narrow track. As  we went, Thorndyke looked back at the prints of our feet, and nodded  approvingly.    \"This soft loam,\" he remarked, \"yields beautifully clear impressions,  and yesterday's rain has made it perfect.\"    We had not gone far when we perceived a set of footprints which I  recognized, as did Thorndyke also, for he remarked: \"Miss  Haldean--running, and alone.\" Presently we met them again, crossing in  the opposite direction, together with the prints of small shoes with  very high heels. \"Mrs. Haldean on the track of her niece,\" was  Thorndyke's comment; and a minute later we encountered them both again,  accompanied by my own footprints.    \"The boy does not seem to have crossed the path at all,\" I remarked as  we walked on, keeping off the track itself to avoid confusing the  footprints.    \"We shall know when we have examined the whole length,\" replied  Thorndyke, plodding on with his eyes on the ground. \"Ha! here is  something new,\" he added, stopping short and stooping down eagerly--\"a  man with a thick stick--a smallish man, rather lame. Notice the  difference between the two feet, and the peculiar way in which he uses  his stick. Yes, Jervis, there is a great deal to interest us in these  footprints. Do you notice anything very suggestive about them?\"    \"Nothing but what you have mentioned,\" I replied. \"What do you mean?\"    \"Well, first there is the very singular character of the prints  themselves, which we will consider presently. You observe that this man  came down the path, and at this point turned off into the wood; then he  returned from the wood and went up the path again. The imposition of the  prints makes that clear. But now look at the two sets of prints, and  compare them. Do you notice any difference?\"    \"The returning footprints seem more distinct--better impressions.\"    \"Yes; they are noticeably deeper. But there is something else.\" He  produced a spring tape from his pocket, and took half a dozen  measurements. \"You see,\" he said, \"the first set of footprints have a  stride of twenty-one inches from heel to heel--a short stride; but he is  a smallish man, and lame; the returning ones have a stride of only  nineteen and a half inches; hence the returning footprints are deeper  than the others, and the steps are shorter. What do you make of that?\"    \"It would suggest that he was carrying a burden when he returned,\" I  replied.    \"Yes; and a heavy one, to make that difference in the depth. I think I  will get you to go and fetch Willett and the bicycles.\"    I strode off down the path to the entrance, and, taking possession of  Thorndyke's machine, with its precious case of instruments, bade Willett  follow with the other two.    When I returned, my colleague was standing with his hands behind him,  gazing with intense preoccupation at the footprints. He looked up  sharply as we approached, and called out to us to keep off the path if  possible.    \"Stay here with the machines, Willett,\" said he. \"You and I, Jervis,  must go and see where our friend went to when he left the path, and what  was the burden that he picked up.\"    We struck off into the wood, where last year's dead leaves made the  footprints almost indistinguishable, and followed the faint double track  for a long distance between the dense clumps of bushes. Suddenly my eye  caught, beside the double trail, a third row of tracks, smaller in size  and closer together. Thorndyke had seen them, too, and already his  measuring-tape was in his hand.    \"Eleven and a half inches to the stride,\" said he. \"That will be the  boy, Jervis. But the light is getting weak. We must press on quickly, or  we shall lose it.\"    Some fifty yards farther on, the man's tracks ceased abruptly, but the  small ones continued alone; and we followed them as rapidly as we could  in the fading light.    \"There can be no reasonable doubt that these are the child's tracks,\"  said Thorndyke; \"but I should like to find a definite footprint to make  the identification absolutely certain.\"    A few seconds later he halted with an exclamation, and stooped on one  knee. A little heap of fresh earth from the surface-burrow of a mole had  been thrown up over the dead leaves; and fairly planted on it was the  clean and sharp impression of a diminutive foot, with a rubber heel  showing a central star. Thorndyke drew from his pocket a tiny shoe, and  pressed it on the soft earth beside the footprint; and when he raised it  the second impression was identical with the first.    \"The boy had two pairs of shoes exactly alike,\" he said, \"so I borrowed  one of the duplicate pair.\"    He turned, and began to retrace his steps rapidly, following our own  fresh tracks, and stopping only once to point out the place where the  unknown man had picked the child up. When we regained the path we  proceeded without delay until we emerged from the wood within a hundred  yards of the cottage.    \"I see Mrs. Haldean has been here with Giles,\" remarked Thorndyke, as he  pushed open the garden-gate. \"I wonder if they saw anybody.\"    He advanced to the door, and having first rapped with his knuckles and  then kicked at it vigorously, tried the handle.    \"Locked,\" he observed, \"but I see the key is in the lock, so we can get  in if we want to. Let us try the back.\"    The back door was locked, too, but the key had been removed.    \"He came out this way, evidently,\" said Thorndyke, \"though he went in at  the front, as I suppose you noticed. Let us see where he went.\"    The back garden was a small, fenced patch of ground, with an earth path  leading down to the back gate. A little way beyond the gate was a small  barn or outhouse.    \"We are in luck,\" Thorndyke remarked, with a glance at the path.  \"Yesterday's rain has cleared away all old footprints, and prepared the  surface for new ones. You see there are three sets of excellent  impressions--two leading away from the house, and one set towards it.  Now, you notice that both of the sets leading _from_ the house are  characterized by deep impressions and short steps, while the set leading  _to_ the house has lighter impressions and longer steps. The obvious  inference is that he went down the path with a heavy burden, came back  empty-handed, and went down again--and finally--with another heavy  burden. You observe, too, that he walked with his stick on each  occasion.\"    By this time we had reached the bottom of the garden. Opening the gate,  we followed the tracks towards the outhouse, which stood beside a  cart-track; but as we came round the corner we both stopped short and  looked at one another. On the soft earth were the very distinct  impressions of the tyres of a motor-car leading from the wide door of  the outhouse. Finding that the door was unfastened, Thorndyke opened it,  and looked in, to satisfy himself that the place was empty. Then he fell  to studying the tracks.    \"The course of events is pretty plain,\" he observed. \"First the fellow  brought down his luggage, started the engine, and got the car out--you  can see where it stood, both by the little pool of oil, and by the  widening and blurring of the wheel-tracks from the vibration of the free  engine; then he went back and fetched the boy--carried him pick-a-back,  I should say, judging by the depth of the toe-marks in the last set of  footprints. That was a tactical mistake. He should have taken the boy  straight into the shed.\"    He pointed as he spoke to one of the footprints beside the wheel-tracks,  from the toe of which projected a small segment of the print of a little  rubber heel.    We now made our way back to the house, where we found Willett pensively  rapping at the front door with a cycle-spanner. Thorndyke took a last  glance, with his hand in his pocket, at an open window above, and then,  to the coachman's intense delight, brought forth what looked uncommonly  like a small bunch of skeleton keys. One of these he inserted into the  keyhole, and as he gave it a turn, the lock clicked, and the door stood  open.    The little sitting-room, which we now entered, was furnished with the  barest necessaries. Its centre was occupied by an oilcloth-covered  table, on which I observed with surprise a dismembered \"Bee\" clock (the  works of which had been taken apart with a tin-opener that lay beside  them) and a box-wood bird-call. At these objects Thorndyke glanced and  nodded, as though they fitted into some theory that he had formed;  examined carefully the oilcloth around the litter of wheels and pinions,  and then proceeded on a tour of inspection round the room, peering  inquisitively into the kitchen and store-cupboard.    \"Nothing very distinctive or personal here,\" he remarked. \"Let us go  upstairs.\"    There were"]]]
