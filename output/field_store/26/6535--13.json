Volume 1: Essentials of Cookery; Cereals; (#13)"],[1,"creamed, for such a cake will not have the same texture as one  in which the creaming has been done properly. It is also shown in angel  food or sunshine cake, for the success of such a cake depends largely on  the skill employed in folding in the whites of eggs or in beating the  yolks. On the other hand, the lightness of pastry and the tenderness of  cookies depend on how each is rolled out, and the kneading of bread is a  process that demonstrates that many things can be learned by actually  doing them.    As progress is made with these cookery lessons, therefore, the  application of the mixing processes should not be overlooked. Beginners  in cookery, owing possibly to the fact that at first they cannot handle  soft material skilfully, are liable to make the mistake of getting the  ingredients too stiff. Yet no beginner need feel the least bit  discouraged, for ability in this direction comes with experience;  indeed, just as skill in sewing, embroidering, and other processes comes  about by practice and persistent effort, so will come skill in cooking.      MEASURING    24. Uniform results in cookery depend on accurate measurement. Of  course, there are some cooks--and good ones, too--who claim that they do  not measure, but as a matter of fact they have, through long experience,  developed a judgment, or \"sense,\" of measurement, which amounts to the  same thing as if they actually did measure. Still, even these cooks  cannot be absolutely sure of securing as satisfactory results time after  time as are likely to follow the employment of a more accurate method.  Therefore, to secure the best results, every kitchen should be supplied  with the proper measuring utensils, which are scales, a measuring cup,  and a set of measuring spoons, or a standard tablespoon and a  standard teaspoon.    [Illustration: Fig. 7]    25. SCALES.--In Fig. 7 is shown the type of scales generally included in  the kitchen equipment. The material to be weighed is placed on the  platform at the top, and the weight of it is indicated on the dial by a  pointer, or hand. Sometimes these scales are provided with a scoop in  which loose materials may be placed in weighing. Such scales furnish a  correct means not only of measuring materials, but of verifying the  weights of foods from the market, the butcher shop, or the grocery. To  use them properly, the housewife should learn to balance them exactly,  and when she is weighing articles she should always allow for the weight  of the container or receptacle, even if it is only the paper that  holds the food.    [Illustration: Fig. 8]    26. MEASURING CUPS.--Weighing the articles called for in a recipe is  often a less convenient method than measuring; therefore, in the  preparation of foods, measuring is more often resorted to than weighing.  As accuracy in measurement is productive of the best results, it is  necessary that all measures be as accurate and definite as possible. For  measuring the ingredients called for in recipes, use is generally made  of a measuring cup like that shown in Fig. 8. Such a cup is designed to  hold 2 gills, or 1/2 pint, and it is marked to indicate thirds and  quarters, so that it may be used for recipes of all kinds. If a liquid  is to be measured with such a cup, it should be filled to the brim, but  if dry material is to be measured with it, the material should be heaped  up in the cup with a spoon and then scraped level with a knife, in the  manner shown in Fig. 9. In case fractions or parts of a cup are to be  measured, the cup should be placed level and stationary and then filled  evenly to the mark indicated on the cup itself.    27. Many times it will be found more convenient to measure dry materials  with a spoon. This can be done with accuracy if it is remembered that 16  tablespoonfuls make 1 cup, or 1/2 pint; 12 tablespoonfuls, 3/4 cup; 8  tablespoonfuls, 1/2 cup; and 4 tablespoonfuls, 1/4 cup. If no measuring  cup like the one just described is at hand, one that will hold 16 level  tablespoonfuls of dry material may be selected from the kitchen supply  of dishes. Such a cup, however, cannot be used successfully in measuring  a half, thirds, or fourths; for such measurements it will be better to  use a spoon.    [Illustration: Fig. 9]    As a rule, it will be found very convenient to have two measuring cups  of standard size, one for measuring dry ingredients and the other for  measuring moist or wet ones. If it is impossible to have more than one,  the dry materials should be measured first in working out a recipe, and  the fats and liquids afterwards. Whatever plan of measuring is followed,  however, it should always be remembered that recipes are written for the  definite quantities indicated and mean _standard_, not approximate,  cupfuls, tablespoonfuls, and teaspoonfuls.    28. MEASURING SPOONS.--In addition to a measuring cup or two, a set of  measuring spoons will be found extremely convenient in a kitchen.  However, if it is impossible to obtain such a set, a teaspoon and a  tablespoon of standard size will answer for measuring purposes. Three  level teaspoonfuls are equal to 1 tablespoonful. When a spoon is used,  it is heaped with the dry material and then leveled with a knife, in the  manner shown in Fig. 10 (_a_). If 1/2 spoonful is desired, it is leveled  first, as indicated in (_a_), and then marked through the center with a  knife and half of its contents pushed off, as shown in (_b_). Fourths  and eighths are measured in the same way, as is indicated in Fig. 11  (_a_), but thirds are measured across the bowl of the spoon, as  in (_b_).    [Illustration: Fig. 10]    29. Precautions to Observe in Measuring.--In measuring some of the  materials used in the preparation of foods, certain points concerning  them should receive attention. For instance, all powdered materials,  such as flour, must first be sifted, as the amount increases upon  sifting, it being definitely known that a cupful of unsifted flour will  measure about 1-1/4 cupfuls after it is sifted. Lumps, such as those  which form in salt and sugar, should be thoroughly crushed before  measuring; if this is not done, accurate measurements cannot be secured,  because lumps of such ingredients are more compact than the loose  material. Butter and other fats should be tightly packed into the  measure, and if the fat is to be melted in order to carry out a recipe,  it should be melted before it is measured. Anything measured in a cup  should be poured into the cup; that is, the cup should not be filled by  dipping it into the material nor by drawing it through the material.    [Illustration: Fig. 11]    30. TABLES OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.--As foods are sold by weight and by  measure, and as recipes always call for certain weights and measures, it  is absolutely necessary that every person engaged in the purchase and  preparation of foods should be familiar with the tables of weights and  measures in common use for such purposes in the United States and  practically all other English-speaking countries. In addition, it will  be well to have a knowledge of relative weights and measures, so as to  be in a position to use these tables to the best advantage.    31. The table used ordinarily for weighing foods is the table of  AVOIRDUPOIS WEIGHT. Another table of weights, called the table of _Troy  weight_, is used by goldsmiths and jewelers for weighing precious  metals. It should not be confused with avoirdupois weight, however,  because its pound contains only 12 ounces, whereas the avoirdupois pound  contains 16 ounces. The table of avoirdupois weight, together with the  abbreviations of the terms used in it, is as follows:    AVOIRDUPOIS WEIGHT  437-1/2 grains (gr.)..... = 1 ounce............. oz.  16 ounces................ = 1 pound............. lb.  100 pounds............... = 1 hundredweight..... cwt.  20 hundredweight \\                   }....... = 1 ton............... T.  2,000 pounds     /    Although 2,000 pounds make 1 ton, it is well to note that 2,240 pounds  make 1 _long ton_ (L.T.). The long ton is used by coal dealers in some  localities, but the ton, sometimes called the _short ton_, is in more  general use and is the one meant unless long ton is specified.    32. The table of LIQUID MEASURE is used for measuring all liquids, and  is extremely useful to the housewife. This table, together with the  abbreviations of its terms, is as follows:    LIQUID MEASURE  4 gills (gi.)........... = 1 pint................. pt.  2 pints................. = 1 quart................ qt.  4 quarts................ = 1 gallon............... gal.  31-1/2 gallons.......... = 1 barrel............... bbl.  2 barrels \\            }............ = 1 hogshead............. hhd.  63 gallons/    33. The table of DRY MEASURE is used for measuring dry foods, such as  potatoes, dried peas and beans, etc. The table of dry measure, with its  abbreviations, follows:    DRY MEASURE  2 pints (pt.)........... = 1 quart................ qt.  8 quarts................ = 1 peck................. pk.  4 pecks................. = 1 bushel............... bu.    34. Tables of RELATIVE WEIGHTS AND MEASURES are of value to the  housewife in that they will assist her greatly in coming to an  understanding of the relation that some of the different weights and  measures bear to one another. For example, as dry foods are sold by the  pound in some localities, it will be well for her to know the  approximate equivalent in pounds of a definite quantity of another  measure, say a quart or a bushel of a certain food. Likewise, she ought  to know that when a recipe calls for a cupful it means 1/2 pint, as has  been explained. Every one is familiar with the old saying, \"A pint's a  pound the world around,\" which, like many old sayings, is not strictly  true, for while 1 pint is equal to 1 pound of some things, it is not of  others. The following tables give approximately the relative weights and  measures of most of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9938"],[0,"Woman's Institute Library of Cookery. Volume 4: Salads and Sandwiches; Cold and (#13)"],[1,"almost every person. At any rate, a  dinner in which a dessert is not included generally leaves one  unsatisfied and gives the feeling that the meal has not been properly  completed. Some housewives, however, make the mistake of serving a heavy  dessert after a large meal, with the result that those served leave the  table feeling they have had too much to eat. If this occurs, the same  combination of food should be avoided another time and a simple dessert  used to follow a dinner that is already sufficiently heavy.    2. There is nothing fixed about the dessert course of a meal. It may be  very simple or it may be as complicated and elaborate as desired. To  make an elaborate dessert usually requires a good deal of time, and  unless time and care can be devoted to such a dessert it should not be  attempted. However, whether a dessert is simple or elaborate, it should  always be made sufficiently attractive to appeal to an appetite that is  already almost satisfied. Besides providing a chance to end a meal in an  attractive and appetizing way, it offers a splendid opportunity to carry  out a color scheme that may be adopted for a meal. Of course, this is  seldom done, except for a party or a company meal, for a color scheme  has no particular value other than to appeal to the esthetic sense.    3. The cost of desserts is also a matter that may be varied. For  instance, it may be low, as in plain rice pudding, which contains merely  rice and milk, or it may be high, as in such concoctions as mousse or  parfait, which may contain cream, eggs, gelatine, and fruit. It is  possible then, with correct planning, to make the price of the dessert  equalize the cost of the meal. For example, if the previous courses have  contained expensive foods, the dessert should be an economical one,  whereas an expensive one is permissible either when an elaborate meal is  desired or when the cheapness of the food served before the dessert  warrants greater expense in the final dish.    4. The fact that desserts are often a means of economically utilizing  left-over foods should not be overlooked. A famous cooking expert is  responsible for the statement that any edible left-over may be utilized  in the making of soup, salad, or dessert. This is an important truth to  keep in mind, for, with the exception of a knowledge of the correct  purchase and cooking of foods, nothing makes so much for economy in  cookery as the economical use of leftovers.    5. Desserts are really of two kinds: those which are heavy, such as hot  puddings and pastry, and those which are light or of a less substantial  nature, such as gelatine, custards, ices, etc. In general, light  desserts are either frozen or allowed to cool before they are used and  consequently may be made some time before the serving of the meal. It is  with desserts of this kind that this Section deals, the heavier desserts  being discussed elsewhere.      COMPOSITION AND FOOD VALUE OF DESSERTS    6. Attention should be paid to the composition and food value of  desserts in order that the meals in which they are served may be  properly balanced. For instance, when a housewife understands the value  of the ingredients used in the preparation of a dessert, she will be  able to determine the kind of dessert necessary to supply what is  lacking in the meal. Of course, if she first decides on a particular  dessert that she wants to serve, it will be necessary for her to plan  the other dishes accordingly. This, however, is not the logical way in  which to plan meals. It is much more reasonable to have the dessert  supply anything that the meal may lack in the way of food constituents.    In considering the food value of desserts, it should be remembered that  they are just as valuable as the ingredients they contain. The  ingredients in which this class of foods is highest are carbohydrate in  the form of starch or sugar or both, protein, especially when eggs in  any quantity are used, and fat.    7. CARBOHYDRATE IN DESSERTS.--As a rule, the carbohydrate in desserts is  obtained from two sources. It is furnished by the sugar, honey, or other  sweetening that is added to the mixture, or it is in the form of starch  added to thicken, as in the case of corn starch, or material actually  used as the basis of the dessert itself, such as rice, tapioca, bread,  etc. These ingredients are, of course, easily digested if they are  properly cooked. On the whole, desserts can therefore be regarded as  high-carbohydrate foods.    8. PROTEIN IN DESSERTS.--Protein is usually supplied in desserts by  means of eggs and milk. Custard made almost exclusively of these two  foods is sufficiently high in protein to be taken into account in the  planning of the main dish for the meal. Because of the presence of this  food substance in many desserts, proper cooking is a matter to which  attention must be given, for it makes for digestibility as well as  consistency. Cream added to desserts also supplies a little protein. If  wheat flour is used, it adds a small amount of protein in the form of  gluten. Most of the starchy preparations, such as tapioca, rice, corn  starch, etc., however, are almost entirely devoid of protein material.  Gelatine desserts are sometimes thought to be high-protein foods, but,  as is explained elsewhere, gelatine is not regarded as true protein. If  such desserts are to contain protein, it must come from some  other source.    9. FAT IN DESSERTS.--Fat is usually added to desserts in the form of  cream. Sometimes, a little butter is used in the making of a dessert,  but for the most part the chief source of fat in desserts is the plain  or whipped cream that is added to them or served with them.      PRINCIPLES OF DESSERT MAKING    10. ATTRACTIVENESS OF DESSERTS.--Attractiveness, as has been mentioned,  is essential in a dessert if it is to appeal to an appetite that may be  nearly satisfied by the time the dessert course is reached. To render  dessert attractive, it should be carefully made and artistically  garnished and served. It may be made to appeal through a sense of  beautiful proportion, an attractive color combination, or an attractive  or artistic preparation. Because sweets are liked by most persons, it is  seldom difficult to prepare attractive desserts. Indeed, the housewife  who fails in this respect may be said to be unsuccessful in the easiest  part of cookery.    11. ECONOMICAL USE OF INGREDIENTS.--The ingredients required for dessert  making are usually expensive ones, although there are some marked  exceptions to this rule. In view of this fact, the housewife should  strive to use economically the various ingredients she purchases. For  instance, the first strawberries, which, because of their scarcity, are  much more expensive than the later ones, may be made to go much further  if they are used in shortcake than if they are served as plain fruit. In  making a fruit gelatine, apples and bananas, while they may not be so  attractive as canned pineapple and maraschino cherries, are much cheaper  and may be used for a considerable portion of the fruit that is put into  the gelatine. Then, too, it is well to remember that cream goes much  further with desserts when it is whipped than when it is served plain.    12. APPLYING COOKERY RULES TO DESSERTS.--If the best results in dessert  making are to be obtained, the rules that govern the cooking of various  ingredients in other dishes should be observed. For instance, eggs  should not be cooked at a higher temperature in making desserts than  when they are being poached. Then, again, starchy materials that are  used to thicken desserts or that form a basis for these dishes must be  thoroughly cooked in order to be agreeable and digestible. Therefore, to  put both starchy materials and eggs into a dessert at the same time and  give them the same amount of cooking at the same temperature, is, as the  woman who understands cookery knows, not only a very poor plan, but a  possible means of ruining good material. Another waste of good material  results when a custard is so prepared that it is half water or when a  rice or a bread pudding floats in liquid that was never intended to be  served with it. Again, nothing is less tasty than a corn-starch pudding  or a blanc mange in which the starch has not been thoroughly cooked or a  tapioca pudding in which the centers of the tapioca are hard and  uncooked. Such mistakes as these, however, can be avoided if the  housewife will apply to desserts the principles she has learned in other  parts of cookery, for knowledge coupled with care in preparation is the  keynote of successful dessert making.    The cookery methods usually applied in the preparation of desserts are  boiling, steaming, dry steaming, and baking. As these methods are  explained in _Essentials of Cookery_, Part 1, and are used constantly in  the preparation of the majority of dishes served in a meal, they should  by this time be so well understood that practically no difficulty will  be experienced in applying them to desserts.           *       *       *       *       *      COLD DESSERTS AND THEIR PREPARATION    SAUCES AND WHIPPED CREAM    13. SAUCES.--Many cold desserts may be served without any  accompaniments, but very often they are much improved by the addition of  a sauce of some kind. For instance, when a custard or a blanc mange is  very thick and heavy, it can be made more agreeable to the taste if it  is served with a sauce of some description. Several recipes for sauces  that may be used with any cold dessert in need of an accompaniment are  here given, so that the housewife will not be at a loss when she desires  to serve a sauce with a dessert she has made.    14. The sauce to use depends on the dessert that it is to accompany. The  custard sauce here given could be used, for example, with plain  corn-starch mixtures that do not contain eggs or with other desserts of  this nature. It is also"]]]
