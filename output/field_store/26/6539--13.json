I knew that the strange sounds were not  made by any lurking Swine-creature; but were simply the echo of my own  respirations.    Yet, I had received such a fright, that I was glad to scramble up the  rift, and haul up the rope. I was far too shaken and nervous to think of  entering that dark hole then, and so returned to the house. I felt more  myself next morning; but even then, I could not summon up sufficient  courage to explore the place.    All this time, the water in the Pit had been creeping slowly up, and  now stood but a little below the opening. At the rate at which it was  rising, it would be level with the floor in less than another week; and  I realized that, unless I carried out my investigations soon, I should  probably never do so at all; as the water would rise and rise, until the  opening, itself, was submerged.    It may have been that this thought stirred me to act; but, whatever it  was, a couple of days later, saw me standing at the top of the cleft,  fully equipped for the task.    This time, I was resolved to conquer my shirking, and go right through  with the matter. With this intention, I had brought, in addition to the  rope, a bundle of candles, meaning to use them as a torch; also my  double-barreled shotgun. In my belt, I had a heavy horse-pistol, loaded  with buckshot.    As before, I fastened the rope to the tree. Then, having tied my gun  across my shoulders, with a piece of stout cord, I lowered myself over  the edge of the Pit. At this movement, Pepper, who had been eyeing my  actions, watchfully, rose to his feet, and ran to me, with a half bark,  half wail, it seemed to me, of warning. But I was resolved on my  enterprise, and bade him lie down. I would much have liked to take him  with me; but this was next to impossible, in the existing circumstances.  As my face dropped level with the Pit edge, he licked me, right across  the mouth; and then, seizing my sleeve between his teeth, began to pull  back, strongly. It was very evident that he did not want me to go. Yet,  having made up my mind, I had no intention of giving up the attempt;  and, with a sharp word to Pepper, to release me, I continued my descent,  leaving the poor old fellow at the top, barking and crying like a  forsaken pup.    Carefully, I lowered myself from projection to projection. I knew that  a slip might mean a wetting.    Reaching the entrance, I let go the rope, and untied the gun from my  shoulders. Then, with a last look at the sky--which I noticed was  clouding over, rapidly--I went forward a couple of paces, so as to be  shielded from the wind, and lit one of the candles. Holding it above my  head, and grasping my gun, firmly, I began to move on, slowly, throwing  my glances in all directions.    For the first minute, I could hear the melancholy sound of Pepper's  howling, coming down to me. Gradually, as I penetrated further into the  darkness, it grew fainter; until, in a little while, I could hear  nothing. The path tended downward somewhat, and to the left. Thence it  kept on, still running to the left, until I found that it was leading me  right in the direction of the house.    Very cautiously, I moved onward, stopping, every few steps, to listen.  I had gone, perhaps, a hundred yards, when, suddenly, it seemed to me  that I caught a faint sound, somewhere along the passage behind. With my  heart thudding heavily, I listened. The noise grew plainer, and appeared  to be approaching, rapidly. I could hear it distinctly, now. It was the  soft padding of running feet. In the first moments of fright, I stood,  irresolute; not knowing whether to go forward or backward. Then, with a  sudden realization of the best thing to do, I backed up to the rocky  wall on my right, and, holding the candle above my head, waited--gun in  hand--cursing my foolhardy curiosity, for bringing me into such  a strait.    I had not long to wait, but a few seconds, before two eyes reflected  back from the gloom, the rays of my candle. I raised my gun, using my  right hand only, and aimed quickly. Even as I did so, something leapt  out of the darkness, with a blustering bark of joy that woke the echoes,  like thunder. It was Pepper. How he had contrived to scramble down the  cleft, I could not conceive. As I brushed my hand, nervously, over his  coat, I noticed that he was dripping; and concluded that he must have  tried to follow me, and fallen into the water; from which he would not  find it very difficult to climb.    Having waited a minute, or so, to steady myself, I proceeded along the  way, Pepper following, quietly. I was curiously glad to have the old  fellow with me. He was company, and, somehow, with him at my heels, I  was less afraid. Also, I knew how quickly his keen ears would detect the  presence of any unwelcome creature, should there be such, amid the  darkness that wrapped us.    For some minutes we went slowly along; the path still leading straight  toward the house. Soon, I concluded, we should be standing right beneath  it, did the path but carry far enough. I led the way, cautiously, for  another fifty yards, or so. Then, I stopped, and held the light high;  and reason enough I had to be thankful that I did so; for there, not  three paces forward, the path vanished, and, in place, showed a hollow  blackness, that sent sudden fear through me.    Very cautiously, I crept forward, and peered down; but could see  nothing. Then, I crossed to the left of the passage, to see whether  there might be any continuation of the path. Here, right against the  wall, I found that a narrow track, some three feet wide, led onward.  Carefully, I stepped on to it; but had not gone far, before I regretted  venturing thereon. For, after a few paces, the already narrow way,  resolved itself into a mere ledge, with, on the one side the solid,  unyielding rock, towering up, in a great wall, to the unseen roof, and,  on the other, that yawning chasm. I could not help reflecting how  helpless I was, should I be attacked there, with no room to turn, and  where even the recoil of my weapon might be sufficient to drive me  headlong into the depths below.    To my great relief, a little further on, the track suddenly broadened  out again to its original breadth. Gradually, as I went onward, I  noticed that the path trended steadily to the right, and so, after some  minutes, I discovered that I was not going forward; but simply circling  the huge abyss. I had, evidently, come to the end of the great passage.    Five minutes later, I stood on the spot from which I had started;  having been completely 'round, what I guessed now to be a vast pit, the  mouth of which must be at least a hundred yards across.    For some little time, I stood there, lost in perplexing thought. 'What  does it all mean?' was the cry that had begun to reiterate through  my brain.    A sudden idea struck me, and I searched 'round for a piece of stone.  Presently, I found a bit of rock, about the size of a small loaf.  Sticking the candle upright in a crevice of the floor, I went back from  the edge, somewhat, and, taking a short run, launched the stone forward  into the chasm--my idea being to throw it far enough to keep it clear of  the sides. Then, I stooped forward, and listened; but, though I kept  perfectly quiet, for at least a full minute, no sound came back to me  from out of the dark.    I knew, then, that the depth of the hole must be immense; for the  stone, had it struck anything, was large enough to have set the echoes  of that weird place, whispering for an indefinite period. Even as it  was, the cavern had given back the sounds of my footfalls,  multitudinously. The place was awesome, and I would willingly have  retraced my steps, and left the mysteries of its solitudes unsolved;  only, to do so, meant admitting defeat.    Then, a thought came, to try to get a view of the abyss. It occurred to  me that, if I placed my candles 'round the edge of the hole, I should be  able to get, at least, some dim sight of the place.    I found, on counting, that I had brought fifteen candles, in the  bundle--my first intention having been, as I have already said, to make  a torch of the lot. These, I proceeded to place 'round the Pit mouth,  with an interval of about twenty yards between each.    Having completed the circle, I stood in the passage, and endeavored to  get an idea of how the place looked. But I discovered, immediately, that  they were totally insufficient for my purpose. They did little more than  make the gloom visible. One thing they did, however, and that was, they  confirmed my opinion of the size of the opening; and, although they  showed me nothing that I wanted to see; yet the contrast they afforded  to the heavy darkness, pleased me, curiously. It was as though fifteen  tiny stars shone through the subterranean night.    Then, even as I stood, Pepper gave a sudden howl, that was taken up by  the echoes, and repeated with ghastly variations, dying away, slowly.  With a quick movement, I held aloft the one candle that I had kept, and  glanced down at the dog; at the same moment, I seemed to hear a noise,  like a diabolical chuckle, rise up from the hitherto, silent depths of  the Pit. I started; then, I recollected that it was, probably, the echo  of Pepper's howl.    Pepper had moved away from me, up the passage, a few steps; he was  nosing along the rocky floor; and I thought I heard him lapping. I went  toward him, holding the candle low. As I moved, I heard my boot go sop,  sop; and the light was reflected from something that glistened, and  crept past my feet, swiftly toward the Pit. I bent lower, and looked;  then gave vent to an expression of surprise. From somewhere, higher up  the path, a stream of water was running quickly in the direction of the  great opening, and growing in size every second.    Again, Pepper gave vent to that deep-drawn howl, and, running at me,  seized my coat, and attempted to drag me up"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10011"],[0,"365 Foreign Dishes (#14)"],[1,"or cold,  garnished with parsley.      21.--English Stuffed Duck.
