Volume 5: Fruit and Fruit Desserts; (#13)"],[1," time may be canned and kept if the process is  carried out properly. These include the perishable vegetables and fruits  of the summer season, as well as any winter vegetables that are not  likely to keep in the usual way or that are gathered while they  are immature.    Many ready-to-serve dishes may be made up when the ingredients are the  most plentiful and canned to keep them for the time when they are  difficult or impossible to obtain otherwise. Such foods are very  convenient in any emergency. Often, too, when something is being cooked  for the table, an extra supply may be made with no greater use of fuel  and very little extra labor, and if the excess is canned it will save  labor and fuel for another day. In the same way, left-over foods from  the table may be preserved by reheating and canning them. Many foods and  combinations of foods may be made ready for pies and desserts and then  canned, it being often possible to use fruits that are inferior in  appearance for such purposes.    Soup may be canned. It may be made especially for canning, or it may be  made in larger quantity than is required for a meal and the surplus  canned. For canning, it is an excellent plan to make soup more  concentrated than that which would be served immediately, as such soup  will require fewer jars and will keep better. Water or milk or the  liquid from cooked vegetables or cereals may be added to dilute it when  it is to be served.    Meat and fish also may be canned, and many times it is advisable to do  this, especially in the case of varieties that cannot be preserved to  advantage by such methods as salting, pickling, or curing.    7. The preservation of foods by canning and drying should not be looked  at as an old-fashioned idea; rather, it is a matter in which the  housewife should be vitally interested. In fact, it is the duty of every  housewife to learn all she can about the best methods to employ. Canning  methods have been greatly improved within the last few years, and it is  a wise plan to adopt the newer methods and follow directions closely.  Especially should this be done if foods canned by the older methods have  spoiled or if mold has formed on top of the food in the jars.    In order to preserve foods successfully and with ease, the housewife  should realize the importance of carrying out details with precision and  care. The exactness with which the ingredients are measured, the choice  and care of utensils, the selection and preparation of the food to be  canned--all have a direct bearing on whether her results will be  successful or not.    By observing such points and exercising a little ingenuity, the  economical housewife may provide both a supply and a convenient variety  of practical foods for winter use. For example, one single fruit or  vegetable may be preserved in a number of ways. Thus, if there is a very  large supply of apples that will not keep, some may be canned in large  pieces, some may be put through a sieve, seasoned differently, and  canned as apple sauce, and some may be cut into small pieces and canned  for use in making pies. Apple butter and various kinds of jams and  marmalades may be made of all or part apples, or the apples may be  spiced and used as a relish. Combining fruits of different flavor in  canning also adds variety. In fact, neither quinces nor apples canned  alone are so delicious as the two properly combined and canned together.    In the same way, if the housewife will watch the markets closely and  make good use of materials at hand, she may provide canned foods at  comparatively little cost. Of course, the woman who has a garden of her  own has a decided advantage over the one who must depend on the market  for foods to can. The woman with access to a garden may can foods as  soon as they have been gathered, and for this reason she runs less risk  of losing them after they have been canned. Nevertheless, as has been  pointed out, it is really the duty of every housewife to preserve food  in the home for the use of her family.           *       *       *       *       *    CANNING    PRINCIPLES OF CANNING    8. CANNING consists in sealing foods in receptacles, such as cans or  jars, in such a way that they will remain sterile for an indefinite  period of time. Several methods of canning are in use, and the one to  adopt will depend considerably on personal preference and the money that  can be expended for the equipment. In any case, successful results in  canning depend on the care that is given to every detail that enters  into the work. This means, then, that from the selection of the food to  be canned to the final operation in canning not one thing that has to do  with good results should be overlooked.    9. SELECTION OF FOOD FOR CANNING.--A careful selection of the food that  is to be canned is of great importance. If it is in good condition at  the time of canning, it is much more likely to remain good when canned  than food that is not. The flavor of the finished product also depends a  great deal on the condition of the food. Fruits have the best flavor  when they are ripe, but they are in the best condition for canning just  before they have completely ripened. Immediately following perfect  ripeness comes the spoiling stage, and if fruits, as well as vegetables,  are canned before they are completely ripe, they are, of course, farther  from the conditions that tend to spoil them. This, however, does not  mean that green fruits or vegetables should be canned.    Whenever possible, any food that is to be canned should be perfectly  fresh. The sooner it is canned after it has been gathered, the more  satisfactory will be the results. For instance, it is better to can it  12 hours after gathering than 24 hours, but to can it 2 hours after is  much better. Fruits, such as berries, that are especially perishable  should not be allowed to stand overnight if this can be prevented; and  it is absolutely necessary to can some vegetables, such as peas, beans,  and corn, within a very few hours after gathering. Unless this is done,  they will develop a bad flavor because of _flat sour_, a condition that  results from the action of certain bacteria. Imperfect fruits should  not be canned, but should be used for making jam, marmalade, or jelly.    10. WHY CANNED FOODS SPOIL.--Canned foods spoil because of the action of  micro-organisms that cause fermentation, putrefaction, and molding. The  reasons for the spoiling of food are thoroughly discussed in _Essentials  of Cookery_, Part 2, and in that discussion canning is mentioned as one  of the means of preserving food or preventing it from spoiling. However,  when canning does not prove effective, it is because undesirable  bacteria are present in the food. Either they have not been destroyed by  the canning process or they have been allowed to enter before the jar  was closed, and have then developed to such an extent as to cause the  food to spoil. Odors, flavors, and gases result from the putrefaction,  fermentation, or molding caused by these bacteria, and these make the  foods offensive or harmful, or perhaps both.    11. PREVENTING CANNED FOODS FROM SPOILING.--From what has just been  said, it will be seen that the success of canning depends entirely on  destroying harmful micro-organisms that are present in the food and  preventing those present in the air from entering the jars in which the  food is placed.    Some foods are more difficult to keep than others, because bacteria act  on them more readily and the foods themselves contain nothing that  prevents their growth. Among such foods are meat, fish, peas, corn,  beans, and meat soups. On the other hand, some foods contain acids that  prevent the growth of bacteria, and these keep easily. Among these are  rhubarb, cranberries, and green gooseberries. However, foods that keep  easily are few, and in most cases extreme care in the process of canning  must be exercised.    12. While warmth is necessary for bacterial growth, very high  temperatures will destroy or retard it. In canning, a temperature as  high as 212 degrees Fahrenheit, or boiling point, retards the growth of  active bacteria, but retarding their growth is not sufficient. They must  be rendered inactive. To do this requires either a higher temperature  than boiling point or long continued cooking at 212 degrees. _Spores_  are a protective form that many kinds of bacteria assume under  unfavorable conditions. They are very difficult to kill, and unless they  are completely destroyed in the canning process, they will develop into  active bacteria when conditions again become favorable. The result of  the spore development is the spoiling of the food.    13. Other things besides the application of heat assist in the keeping  of canned food, as, for example, the acids of the fruits and vegetables  themselves, as has been mentioned. The use of sugar also assists; the  greater the quantity of sugar in solution the easier it will be to keep  the food. This is proved in the case of jams and jellies, which will  keep without being sealed tight or put into jars immediately after  cooking. Salt helps to keep vegetables that are canned, and, in making  butters, conserves, and pickles, the spices and vinegars used help to  protect the foods from bacterial action. However, none of these things  are essential to the keeping of any _sterile food_, by which is meant  food in which all bacteria or sources of bacteria have been rendered  inactive by the application of sufficient heat.    14. CANNING PRESERVATIVES.--Numerous compounds, usually in the form of  powders, are advertised as being useful for keeping canned foods from  spoiling. None of them should be used, however, because they are  unnecessary. If the work of canning is carefully and effectively done,  good foods will keep perfectly without the addition of a preservative.

He prevailed on a  native whom he met with there to come with him to me, and to guide me to  water until I reached the Barwan. This native at first seemed rather  afraid of our numerous party, but our own native, Yuranigh, endeavoured  by every means to make him at ease, and to induce him to remain with us.  He guided us this day by fine open ground westward of the marshes, to a  part of the Macquarie where the banks were solid enough to admit of the  cattle drinking. The name was Bilgawangara; I reached the spot early, but  at sunset no drays had come up. At length I was informed that such was  the softness of the soil, that the drays had sank frequently, that two  were fast in one place, four in another, and that two of the bullocks  were astray. The marshes were said to be just then occupied by some angry  tribes, of whom Mr. Kinghorne had warned me to be on my guard. The  patience necessary to any traveller depending on bullocks and bullock  drivers, I then thought ought to exceed that of Job. Our native guide was  very shy, and Yuranigh feared he meant to \"bolt.\" We depended on him for  finding water--on our own native for finding bullocks; but it would not  have done then to have sent him away. The weather might change, and these  marshes become impassable; indeed, we were as much at the mercy of  Providence in this respect as the Israelites were in the bed of the Red  Sea. It depended on the weather whether we should deserve to be  considered Jews or Egyptians. The teams came in about midnight, after the  moon had risen, by which the drivers were enabled to see my track. Lat.  30 deg. 45' 55\" S. Thermometer at sunrise, 48 deg.; at noon, 85 deg.; at 4 P.M., 88 deg.;  at 9, 60 deg.;--with wet bulb, 54 deg..    18TH FEBRUARY.--Two bullocks were still astray some miles behind, and the  iron axle of one of the drays having got bent, required repair. The  cattle, I was told, were so jaded, as to be unable to make a day's  journey without more rest, and I was again obliged to halt. One only of  the two lost bullocks was found, and for this one we were indebted to  little Dicky, a native only ten years of age, whom the big fool who had  lost them was at some trouble to coax to go and assist him in the search,  as Yuranigh could not be spared from the more important duty of  entertaining our less civilised guide, and preventing him from making his  escape. It must, indeed, appear strange to these people of the soil, that  the white man who brought such large animals as oxen with them into the  country, should be unable to find them without the assistance of a mere  child of their own race. Dicky had soon found both, but one of them being  young and wild, escaped again amongst the tall reeds.    In the rich soil near the river bed, we saw the yellowish flowers of the  native tobacco, NICOTIANA SUAVEOLEUS, the MINURIA HETEROPHYLLA (D.C.),  found by Allan Cunningham near the Lachlan, and a FUGOSIA near F.  DIGITATA of Senegambia. In the scrub we found a fine new silvery ATRIPLEX  with broad rounded leaves and strings of circular toothed fruits.[*]  Thermometer at sunrise, 53 deg.; at noon, 93 deg.; at 4 P.M., 96 deg.; at 9, 67 deg.;--  with wet bulb 59 deg..

He was a  very perfect specimen of the GENUS HOMO, and such as never is to be seen,  except in the precincts of savage life, undegraded by any scale of  graduated classes, and the countless bars these present to the free  enjoyment of existence. His motions in walking were more graceful than  can be imagined by any who have only seen those of the draped and shod  animal. The deeply set yet flexible spine; the taper form of the limbs;  the fulness yet perfect elasticity of the GLUTEI muscles. The hollowness  of the back, and symmetrical balance of the upper part of the torso,  ornamented as it was, like a piece of fine carving, with raised  scarifications most tastefully placed; such were some of the  characteristics of this perfect \"piece of work.\" Compared with it, the  civilised animal, when considered merely in the light of a specimen in  natural history, how inferior! In vain might we look amongst thousands of  that class, for such teeth; such digestive powers; for such organs of  sight, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling; for such powers of running,  climbing, or walking; for such full enjoyment of the limpid water, and of  all that nature provides for her children of the woods. Such health and  exemption from disease; such intensity of existence, in short, must be  far beyond the enjoyments of civilised men, with all that art can do for  them; and the proof of this is to be found in the failure of all attempts  to persuade these free denizens of uncultivated earth to forsake it for  the tilled ground. They prefer the land unbroken and free from the  earliest curse pronounced against the first banished and first created  man. The only kindness we could do for them, would be to let them and  their wide range of territory alone; to act otherwise and profess good-  will is but hypocrisy. We cannot occupy the land without producing a  change, fully as great to the aborigines, as that which took place on  man's fall and expulsion from Eden. They have hitherto lived utterly  ignorant of the necessity for wearing fig leaves, or the utility of  ploughs; and in this blissful state of ignorance they would, no doubt,  prefer to remain. We bring upon them the punishments due to original sin,  even before they know the shame of nakedness. Such were the reflections  suggested to my mind by the young savage as he tripped on lightly before  me by the side of his two half-civilised brethren of our party, who,  muffled up in clothes, presented a contrast by no means in favour of our  pretensions to improve and benefit their race. Yet our faithful Yuranigh  was all that could be wished. He was assiduously making to the stranger  such explanations of our wants and purposes, as induced him to conduct us  in the direction these required. He led us, thus admonished, over those  parts of the country most favourable for the passage of wheels. The  rosewood acacia was abundant, but many parts were covered with most  luxuriant grass. We encamped on the edge of a salt-bush plain, where  there was a small pond of water left by the last rains on a clay surface.  There was certainly enough for ourselves and horses, but it appeared that  our guide had greatly underrated the capacity for water, of our hundred  bullocks. For these, however, there was superb grass to the westward, and  a little dew fell on it during the night. Thermometer at sunrise, 59 deg.; at  noon, 102 deg.; at 4 P. M., 104 deg.; at 9, 77 deg.;--with wet bulb, 65 deg..    20TH FEBRUARY.--From the necessity for obtaining water as soon as  possible for the bullocks, we travelled over ground which was rather  soft, otherwise our guide would have pursued a course more to the  westward, and over a firmer surface. We, at length, crossed two narrow  belts of reeds not more than twenty feet across, and had the great  satisfaction to learn from him that these were the last of the reeds. A  shallow creek appeared soon thereafter on our right, in which our guide  had expected to find water, but was disappointed; cattle having recently  drank up there, what had been a large pond when he was there formerly. He  showed us the recent prints of numerous cloven feet, and thus we were  made to feel, in common with the aborigines, those privations to which  they are exposed by the white man's access to their country. On  proceeding some miles further, our guide following down the channel, he  at length appeared at a distance making the motions of stooping to bathe,  on which Yuranigh immediately said \"He has found plenty of water;\" and  there, in fact, our guide had found two large ponds. They were still in  the attenuated channel of the Macquarie, here called by them Wammerawa,  the course of which river is continuous throughout the marshes; and  marked by some high reeds greener than the rest, even when the reeds may  have been generally burnt. These reeds are distinctly different from the  \"balyan,\" growing on the marshy parts of the rivers Lachlan,  Murrumbidgee, and Millewa; the former being a cane or bamboo, the latter  a bulrush, affording, in its root, much nutritious gluten.
