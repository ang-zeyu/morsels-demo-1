Don't start no worryin'. You're goin' to live's long as you  don't lose no more blood. Keep your thoughts quiet. They ain't no cause  for you to do nothin' but jest keep your eyes closed, and breathe, and  think of yaller sunshine, and green grass in the spring, and the wind  lazyin' the clouds along across the sky. That's all you got to think  about. Jest keep quiet, partner.\"    \"It's easy to do it now you're with me. Seems like they's a pile of  strength runnin' into me from the tips of your fingers, my frien'.  And--I was _some_ fool to start that fight with you, Barry.\"    \"Jest forget all that,\" murmured the other. \"And keep your voice down.  I've forgot it; you forget it. It ain't never happened.\"    \"What's it mean?\" frowned Mac Strann, whispering to Haw-Haw.    The eyes of the latter glittered like beads.    \"That's him that shot Jerry,\" said Haw-Haw. \"Him!\"    \"Hell!\" snarled Mac Strann, and went through the door.    At the first sound of his heavy footfall, the head of Barry raised and  turned in a light, swift movement. The next instant he was on his feet.  A moment before his face had been as gentle as that of a mother leaning  over a sick child; but one glimpse of the threat in the contorted brows  of Mac Strann set a gleam in his own eyes, an answer as distinct as the  click of metal against metal. Not a word had been said, but Jerry, who  had lain with his eyes closed, seemed to sense a change in the  atmosphere of peace which had enwrapped him the moment before. His eyes  flashed open; and he saw his burly brother.    But Mac Strann had no eye for any saving Dan Barry.    \"Are you the creepin', sneakin' snake that done--this?\"    \"You got me figured right,\" answered Dan coldly.    \"Then, by God------\" began the roaring voice of Mac, but Jerry Strann  stirred wildly on the bed.    \"Mac!\" he called, \"Mac!\" His voice went suddenly horribly thick, a  bubbling, liquid sound. \"For God's sake, Mac!\"    He had reared himself up on one elbow, his arm stretched out to his  brother. And a foam of crimson stood on his lips.    \"Mac, don't pull no gun! It was me that was in wrong!\"    And then he fell back in the bed, and into the arms of Mac, who was  beside him, moaning: \"Buck up, Jerry. Talk to me, boy!\"    \"Mac, you've finished the job,\" came the husky whisper.    Mac Strann raised his head, and his terrible eyes fixed upon Dan Barry.  And there was no pity in the face of the other. The first threat had  wiped every vestige of human tenderness out of his eyes, and now, with  something like a sneer on his lips, and with a glimmer of yellow light  in his eyes, he was backing towards the door, and noiselessly as a  shadow he slipped out and was gone.          CHAPTER XII    FINESSE      \"A man talks because he's drunk or lonesome; a girl talks because that's  her way of takin' exercise.\"    This was a maxim of Buck Daniels, and Buck Daniels knew a great deal  about women, as many a school marm and many a rancher's daughter of the  mountain-desert could testify.    Also Buck Daniels said of women: \"It ain't what you say to 'em so much  as the tune you put it to.\"    Now he sat this day in O'Brien's hotel dining-room. It was the lazy and  idle hour between three and four in the afternoon, and since the men of  the mountain-desert eat promptly at six, twelve, and six, there was not  a soul in the room when he entered. Nor was there a hint of eating  utensils on the tables. Nevertheless Buck Daniels was not dismayed. He  selected a corner-table by instinct and smote upon the surface with the  flat of his hand. It made a report like the spat of a forty-five; heavy  footsteps approached, a door flung open, and a cross-eyed slattern stood  in the opening. At the sight of Buck Daniels sitting with his hands on  his hips and his sombrero pushed back to a good-natured distance on his  head the lady puffed with rage.    \"What in hell d'you think this is?\" bellowed this gentle creature, and  the tone echoed heavily back from all four walls. \"You're three hours  late and you get no chuck here. On your way, stranger!\"    Buck Daniels elevated himself slowly from the chair and stood at his  full height. With a motion fully as deliberate he removed his sombrero  and bowed to such a depth that the brim of the hat brushed the floor.    \"Lady,\" he said humbly, \"I was thinkin' that some gent run this here  eatin' place. Which if you'll excuse me half a minute I'll ramble  outside and sluice off some of the dust. If I'd known you was here I  wouldn't of thought of comin' in here like this.\"    The lady with the defective eyes glared fiercely at him. Her judgment  wavered two ways. Her first inclination was to hold that the fellow was  jibing at her covertly, and she followed her original impulse far enough  to clasp a neighboring sugar-bowl in a large, capable hand. A second and  more merciful thought entered her brain and stole slowly through it,  like a faint echo in a great cave.    \"You don't have to make yourself pretty to talk to me,\" she said  thoughtfully. \"But if you're here for chow you're too late.\"    \"Ma'am,\" said Buck Daniels instantly, \"when I come in here I was hungry  enough to eat nails; but I'll forget about chuck if you'll sit down an'  chin with me a while.\"    The large hand of the cross-eyed lady stole out once more and rested  upon the sugar-bowl.    \"D'you mind sayin' that over agin?\" she queried.    \"Lonesomeness is worse'n hunger,\" said Buck Daniels, and he met her gaze  steadily with his black eyes.    The hand released the sugar-bowl once more; something resembling colour  stole into the brown cheeks of the maiden.    She said, relentingly: \"Maybe you been off by yourse'f mining,  stranger?\"    Buck Daniels drew a long breath.    \"Mines?\" he said, and then laughed bitterly. \"If that was all I been  doin'--\" he began darkly--and then stopped.    The waitress started.    \"Maybe this here is my last chance to get chuck for days an' days. Well,  let it go. If I stayed here with you I'd be talkin' too much!\"    He turned slowly towards the door. His step was very slow indeed.    \"Wait a minute,\" called the maiden. \"There ain't any call for that play.  If you're in wrong somewhere--well, stranger, just take that chair and  I'll have some ham-and in front of you inside of a minute.\"    She had slammed through the door before Buck turned, and he sat down,  smiling pleasantly to himself. Half of a mirror decorated the wall  beside his table, and into this Buck peered. His black locks were sadly  disarrayed, and he combed them into some semblance of order with his  fingers. He had hardly finished this task when the door was kicked open  with such force that it whacked against the wall, and the waitress  appeared with an armful of steaming food. Before Buck's widening eyes  she swiftly set forth an array of bread, butter in chunks, crisp  French-fried potatoes, a large slab of ham on one plate and several  fried eggs on another, and above all there was a mighty pewter cup of  coffee blacker than the heart of night. Yearning seized upon Buck  Daniels, but policy was stronger than hunger in his subtle mind. He rose  again; he drew forth the chair opposite his own.    \"Ma'am,\" said Buck Daniels, \"ain't you going to favor me by sittin'  down?\"    The lady blinked her unfocused eyes.    \"Ain't I what?\" she was finally able to ask.    \"I know,\" said Buck Daniels swiftly, \"that you're terrible busy; which  you ain't got time to waste on a stranger like me.\"    She turned upon Buck those uncertain and wistful eyes. It was a generous  face. Mouth, cheekbones, and jaw were of vast proportions, while the  forehead, eyes, and nose were as remarkably diminutive. Her glance  lowered to the floor; she shrugged her wide shoulders and began to wipe  the vestiges of dishwater from her freckled hands.    \"You men are terrible foolish,\" she said. \"There ain't no tellin' what  you mean by what you say.\"    And she sank slowly into the chair. It gave voice in sharp protest at  her weight. Buck Daniels retreated to the opposite side of the table  and took his place.    \"Ma'am,\" he began, \"don't I look honest?\" So saying, he slid half a  dozen eggs and a section of bacon from the platter to his plate.    \"I dunno,\" said the maiden, with one eye upon him and the other plunging  into the future. \"There ain't no trusting men. Take 'em by the lot and  they're awful forgetful.\"    \"If you knowed me better,\" said Buck sadly, disposing of a slab of bread  spread thick with the pale butter and following this with a pile of  fried potatoes astutely balanced on his knife. \"If you knowed me better,  ma'am, you wouldn't have no suspicions.\"    \"What might it be that you been doin'?\" asked the girl.    Buck Daniels paused in his attack on the food and stared at her.    He quoted deftly from a magazine which had once fallen in his way: \"Some  day maybe I can tell you. There's something about your eyes that tells  me you'd understand.\"    At the mention of her eyes the waitress blinked and stiffened in her  chair, while a huge, red fist balled itself in readiness for action. But  the expression of Buck Daniels was as blandly open as the smile of  infancy. The lady relaxed and an unmistakable blush tinged even her nose  with colour.    \"It ain't after my nature to be askin' questions,\" she announced. \"You  don't have to tell me no more'n you want to.\"    \"Thanks,\" said Buck instantly. \"I knew you was that kind. It ain't  hard,\" he went on smoothly, \"to tell a lady when you see one. I can tell  you this much to start with. I'm lookin' for a quiet town where I can  settle down permanent. And as far as I can see, Brownsville looks sort  of quiet to me.\"    So saying, he disposed of the rest of his food by an act akin to  legerdemain, and then fastened a keen eye upon the lady. She was in the  midst of a struggle of some sort.

[Illustration: FIG. 36 LOOMS DRIVEN WITH INDIVIDUAL MOTORS _By  permission of The English Electric Co., Ltd._]    The order of lifting and depressing the threads of the warp is, as  already stated, demonstrated on the design paper in Fig. 33, and the  selected order determines, in the simplest cases, the pattern on the  surface of the cloth when the warp and weft yarns are of the same  colour. A great diversity of pattern can be obtained by the method  of interlacing the two sets of yarn, and a still greater variety of  pattern is possible when differently-coloured threads are added to  the mode of interlacing.    To illustrate the contrast in the general appearance of a weaving  shed in which all the looms are driven by belts from overhead  shafting as in Fig. 35, and in a similar shed in which all the looms  are individually driven by small motors made by the English Electric  Co., Ltd. we introduce Fig. 36. This particular illustration shows  cotton weaving shed, but precisely the same principle of driving is  being adopted in many jute factories.    A great variety of carpet patterns of a similar nature to that  illustrated at C, Fig. 32, can be woven in looms such as those  illustrated in Fig. 35; indeed, far more elaborate patterns than  that mentioned and illustrated are capable of being produced in  these comparatively simple looms. When, however, more than 4 leaves  are required for the weaving of a pattern, a dobby loom, of the  nature of that shown in Fig. 37, is employed; this machine is made  by Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons & Co., Ltd., Dundee. The dobby itself,  or the apparatus which lifts the leaves according to the  requirements of the design, is fixed on the upper part of the  frame-work, and is designed to control 12 leaves, that is, it  operates 12 leaves, each of which lifts differently from the others.    [Illustration: _By permission of Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons & Co_.  FIG. 37 DOBBY LOOM]    A considerable quantity of Wilton and Brussels carpets is made from  jute yarns, and Fig. 38 illustrates a loom at work on this  particular branch of the trade. The different colours of warp for  forming the pattern me from small bobbins in the five frames at the  back of the loom (hence the term 5-frame Brussels or Wilton carpet)  and the ends passed through \"mail eyes\" and then through the reed.  The design is cut on the three sets of cards suspended in the  cradles in the front of the loom, and these cards operate on the  needles of the jacquard machine to raise those colours of yarn which  e necessary to produce the colour effect in the cloth t correspond  with the colour effect on the design paper made by the designer.  This machine weaves the actual Brussels and Wilton fabrics, and  these cloths are quite different from that illustrated at _P_, Fig.  32. In both fabrics, however, ground or foundation warps are  required. It need hardly be said that there is a considerable  difference between the two types of cloth, as well as between the  designs and the looms in which they are woven.[2]    [Footnote 2: For structure of carpets, _see_ pp. 394-114, _Textile  Design: Pure and Applied_, by T. Woodhouse and T. Milne.]    [Illustration: FIG. 38 BRUSSELS CARPET JACQUARD LOOM]    In the weaving department there are heavy warp beams to be placed in  the looms, and in the finishing department there are often heavy  rolls of cloth to be conveyed from the machines to the despatch room.  Accidents often happen when these heavy packages, especially the  warp beams, are being placed in position. In order to minimize the  danger to workpeople and to execute the work more quickly and with  fewer hands, some firms have installed Overhead Runway Systems, with  suitable Lifting Gear, by means of which the warp beams are run from  the dressing and drawing-in departments direct to the looms, and  then lowered quickly and safely into the bearings. Such means of  transport are exceedingly valuable where the looms are set close to  each other and where wide beams are employed; indeed, they are  valuable for all conditions, and are used for conveying cloth direct  from the looms as well as warp beams to the looms. Fig. 39 shows the  old wasteful and slow method of transferring warp beams from place  to place, while Fig. 40 illustrates the modern and efficient method.  The latter figure illustrates one kind of apparatus, supplied by  Messrs. Herbert Morris, Ltd., Loughborough, for this important  branch of the industry.    [Illustration: FIG. 39. THE OLD WAY]    [Illustration: FIG. 40. THE NEW WAY _By permission of Messrs.  Herbert Morris, Ltd_.]          CHAPTER XV.  FINISHING    The finishing touches are added to the cloth after the latter leaves  the loom. The first operation is that of inspecting the cloth,  removing the lumps and other undesirables, as well as repairing any  damaged or imperfect parts. After this, the cloth is passed through  a cropping machine the function of which is to remove all projecting  fibres from the surface of the cloth, and so impart a clean, smart  appearance. It is usual to crop both sides of the cloth, although  there are some cloths which require only one side to be treated,  while others again miss this operation entirely.    A cropping machine is shown in the foreground of Fig. 41, and in  this particular case there are two fabrics being cropped or cut at  the same time; these happen to be figured fabrics which have been  woven in a jacquard loom similar to that illustrated in Fig. 38. The  fabrics are, indeed, typical examples of jute Wilton carpets. The  illustration shows one of the spiral croppers in the upper part of  the machine in Fig. 41. Machines are made usually with either two or  four of such spirals with their corresponding fixed blades.    [Illustration: FIG. 41 CROPPING MACHINE AT WORK]    The cloth is tensioned either by threading it over and under a  series of stout rails, or else between two in a specially adjustable  arrangement by means of which the tension may be varied by rotating  slightly the two rails so as to alter the angle formed by the cloth  in contact with them. This is, of course, at the feed side; the  cloth is pulled through the machine by three rollers shown  distinctly on the right in Fig. 42. This view illustrates a double  cropper in which both the spirals are controlled by one belt. As the  cloth is pulled through, both sides of it are cropped by the two  spirals.[3] When four spirals are required, the frame is much wider,  and the second set of spirals is identical with those in the  machines illustrated.    [Illustration: FIG 42 DOUBLE CROPPING MACHINE _By permission of  Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons & Co., Ltd_.]    [Footnote 3: For a full description of all finishing processes,  see _The Finishing of Jute and Linen Fabrics_, by T. Woodhouse.  (Published by Messrs. Emmott & Co., Ltd., Manchester.)]    The cropped cloth is now taken to the clamping machine, and placed  on the floor on the left of the machine illustrated in Fig. 43,  which represents the type made by Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons &, Co.,  Dundee. The cloth is passed below a roller near to the floor, then  upwards and over the middle roller, backwards to be passed under and  over the roller on the left, and then forwards to the nip of the  pulling rollers, the bottom one of which is driven positively by  means of a belt on the pulleys shown. While the cloth is pulled  rapidly through this machine, two lines of fine jets spray water on  to the two sides of the fabric to prepare it for subsequent processes  in which heat is generated by the nature of the finishing process.  At other times, or rather in other machines, the water is  distributed on the two sides of the cloth by means of two rapidly  rotating brushes which flick the water from two rollers rotating in  a tank of water at a fixed level. In both cases, both sides of the  fabric are \"damped,\" as it is termed, simultaneously. The damped  fabric is then allowed to lie for several hours to condition, that is,  to enable the moisture to spread, and then it is taken to the  calender.    [Illustration: _By permission of Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons & Co.,  Ltd_. FIG. 43 DAMPING MACHINE]    The calenders for jute almost invariably contain five different  rollers, or \"bowls,\" as they are usually termed; one of these bowls,  the smallest diameter one, is often heated with steam. A five-bowl  calender is shown on the extreme right in Fig. 41, and in the  background, while a complete illustration of a modern 5-bowl calender,  with full equipment, and made by Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay & Co., Ltd.,  Dundee, appears in Fig. 44.    [Illustration: _By permission of Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay & Co., Ltd_.  FIG. 44 CALENDAR]    The cloth is placed on the floor between the two distinct parts of  the calender, threaded amongst the tension rails near the bottom  roller or bowl, and then passed over two or more of the bowls  according to the type of finish desired. For calender finish, the  bowls flatten the cloth by pressing out the threads and picks, so  that all the interstices which appear in most cloths as they leave  the loom, and which are exaggerated in the plan view in Fig. 34, are  eliminated by this calendering action. The cloth is then delivered  at the far side of the machine in Fig. 44. If necessary, the surface  speed of the middle or steam-heated roller may differ from the  others so that a glazed effect--somewhat resembling that obtained by  ordinary ironing--is imparted to the surface of the fabric. The  faster moving roller is the steam-heated one. For ordinary calender  finish, the surface speed of all the rollers is the same.    Another \"finish\" obtained on the calender is known as \"chest finish\"  or \"round-thread finish.\" In this case, the whole length of cloth is "]]]
