He was in ecstacies  at the prize. Even the white catskins paled before it. In all  probability some of the men would have taken it from him, \"to try  and find the owner,\" but for the presence and interference of his  friends Peg Dotting and old Doubleyear, whose great age, even among  the present company, gave them a certain position of respect and  consideration. So all the rest now went their way, leaving the three  to examine and speculate on the prize.    These Dust-heaps are a wonderful compound of things. A banker's cheque  for a considerable sum was found in one of them. It was on Merries &  Farquhar, in 1847. But bankers' cheques, or gold and silver articles,  are the least valuable of their ingredients. Among other things, a  variety of useful chemicals are extracted. Their chief value, however,  is for the making of bricks. The fine cinder-dust and ashes are used  in the clay of the bricks, both for the red and gray stacks. Ashes  are also used as fuel between the layers of the clump of bricks, which  could not be burned in that position without them. The ashes burn  away, and keep the bricks open. Enormous quantities are used. In  the brickfields at Uxbridge, near the Drayton Station, one of the  brickmakers alone will frequently contract for fifteen or sixteen  thousand chaldrons of this cinder-dust, in one order. Fine coke, or  coke-dust, affects the market at times as a rival; but fine coal, or  coal-dust, never, because it would spoil the bricks.    As one of the heroes of our tale had been originally--before his  promotion--a chimney-sweeper, it may be only appropriate to offer a  passing word on the genial subject of soot. Without speculating on  its origin and parentage, whether derived from the cooking of a  Christmas-dinner, or the production of the beautiful colors and odors  of exotic plants in a conservatory, it can briefly be shown to possess  many qualities both useful and ornamental.    When soot is first collected, it is called \"rough soot\", which,  being sifted, is then called \"fine soot\", and is sold to farmers for  manuring and preserving wheat and turnips. This is more especially  used in Herefordshire, Bedfordshire, Essex, &c. It is rather a costly  article, being fivepence per bushel. One contractor sells annually as  much as three thousand bushels; and he gives it as his opinion, that  there must be at least one hundred and fifty times this quantity (four  hundred and fifty thousand bushels per annum) sold in London. Farmer  Smutwise, of Bradford, distinctly asserts that the price of the soot  he uses on his land is returned to him in the straw, with improvement  also to the grain. And we believe him. Lime is used to dilute soot  when employed as a manure. Using it pure will keep off snails, slugs,  and caterpillars from peas and various other vegetables, as also from  dahlias just shooting up, and other flowers; but we regret to add that  we have sometimes known it kill or burn up the things it was intended  to preserve from unlawful eating. In short, it is by no means so  safe to use for any purpose of garden manure, as fine cinders and  wood-ashes, which are good for almost any kind of produce, whether  turnips or roses. Indeed, we should like to have one fourth or fifth  part of our garden-beds composed of excellent stuff of this kind.  From all that has been said, it will have become very intelligible  why these Dust-heaps are so valuable. Their worth, however, varies  not only with their magnitude, (the quality of all of them is much  the same,) but with the demand. About the year 1820, the Marylebone  Dust-heap produced between four thousand and five thousand pounds. In  1832, St. George's paid Mr. Stapleton five hundred pounds a year, not  to leave the Heap standing, but to carry it away. Of course he was  only too glad to be paid highly for selling his Dust.    But to return. The three friends having settled to their satisfaction  the amount of money they should probably obtain by the sale of the  golden miniature-frame, and finished the castles which they had built  with it in the air, the frame was again infolded in the sound part of  the parchment, the rags and rottenness of the law were cast away, and  up they rose to bend their steps homeward to the little hovel where  Peggy lived, she having invited the others to tea, that they might  talk yet more fully over the wonderful good luck that had befallen  them.    \"Why, if there isn't a man's head in the canal!\" suddenly cried little  Jem. \"Looky there!--isn't that a man's head?--Yes; it's a drownded  man!\"    \"A drownded man, as I live!\" ejaculated old Doubleyear.    \"Let's get him out, and see!\" cried Peggy. \"Perhaps the poor soul's  not quite gone.\"    Little Jem scuttled off to the edge of the canal, followed by the two  old people. As soon as the body had floated nearer, Jem got down into  the water, and stood breast-high, vainly measuring his distance, with  one arm out, to see if he could reach some part of the body as it was  passing. As the attempt was evidently without a chance, old Doubleyear  Managed to get down into the water behind aim, and holding him by one  hand, the boy was thus enabled to make a plunge forward as the body  was floating by. He succeeded in reaching it, but the jerk was too  much for his aged companion, who was pulled forward into the canal. A  loud cry burst from both of them, which was yet more loudly echoed by  Peggy on the bank. Doubleyear and the boy were now struggling almost  in the middle of the canal, with the body of the man twirling about  between them. They would inevitably have been drowned, had not old  Peggy caught up a long dust-rake that was close at hand--scrambled  down up to her knees in the canal--clawed hold of the struggling group  with the teeth of the rake, and fairly brought the whole to land. Jem  was first up the bank, and helped up his two heroic companions; after  which, with no small difficulty, they contrived to haul the body  of the stranger out of the water. Jem at once recognized in him the  forlorn figure of the man who had passed by in the morning, looking so  sadly into the canal as he walked along.    It is a fact well known to those who work in the vicinity of these  great Dust-heaps, that when the ashes have been warmed by the sun,  cats and kittens that have been taken out of the canal and buried a  few inches beneath the surface, have usually revived; and the same has  often occurred in the case of men. Accordingly, the three, without a  moment's hesitation, dragged the body along to the Dust-heap, where  they made a deep trench, in which they placed it, covering it all over  up to the neck.    \"There now,\" ejaculated Peggy, sitting down with a long puff to  recover her breath, \"he'll lie very comfortable, whether or no.\"    \"Couldn't lie better,\" said old Doubleyear, \"even if he knew it.\"    The three now seated themselves close by, to await the result.    \"I thought I'd a lost him,\" said Jem, \"and myself too; and when I  pulled Daddy in arter me, I guv us all three up for this world.\"    \"Yes,\" said Doubleyear, \"it must have gone queer with us if Peggy had  not come in with the rake. How d'yee feel, old girl? for you've had  a narrow escape too. I wonder we were not too heavy for you, and so  pulled you in to go with us.\"    \"The Lord be praised!\" fervently ejaculated Peggy, pointing toward  the pallid face that lay surrounded with ashes. A convulsive twitching  passed over the features, the lips trembled, the ashes over the breast  heaved, and a low moaning sound, which might have come from the bottom  of the canal, was heard. Again the moaning sound, and then the eyes  opened, but closed almost immediately.    \"Poor dear soul,\" whispered Peggy, \"how he suffers in surviving. Lift  him up a little. Softly. Don't be afeard. We're only your good angels,  like--only poor cinder-sifters--don'tee be afeard.\"    By various kindly attentions and maneuvers such as these poor people  had been accustomed to practice on those who were taken out of the  canal, the unfortunate gentleman was gradually brought to his senses.  He gazed about him, as well he might--now looking in the anxious,  though begrimed, faces of the three strange objects, all in their  \"weeds\" and dust--and then up at the huge Dust-heap, over which the  moon was now slowly rising.    \"Land of quiet Death!\" murmured he, faintly, \"or land of Life, as dark  and still--I have passed from one into the other; but which of ye I am  now in, seems doubtful to my senses.\"    \"Here we are, poor gentleman,\" cried Peggy, \"here we are, all friends  about you. How did'ee tumble into the canal?\"    \"The Earth, then, once more!\" said the stranger, with a deep sigh. \"I  know where I am, now. I remember this great dark hill of ashes--like  Death's kingdom, full of all sorts of strange things, and put to many  uses.\"    \"Where do you live?\" asked old Doubleyear. \"Shall we try and take you  home, sir?\"    The stranger shook his head mournfully. All this time, little Jem had  been assiduously employed in rubbing his feet and then big hands; in  doing which, the piece of dirty parchment, with the miniature-frame,  dropped out of his breast-pocket. A good thought instantly struck  Peggy.    \"Run, Jemmy dear--run with that golden thing to Mr. Spikechin, the  pawnbroker's--get something upon it directly, and buy some nice  brandy--and some Godfrey's cordial--and a blanket, Jemmy--and call a  coach, and get up outside on it, and make the coachee drive back here  as fast as you can.\"    But before Jemmy could attend to this, Mr. Waterhouse, the stranger  whose life they had preserved, raised himself on one elbow, and  extended his hand to the miniature-frame. Directly he looked at it he  raised himself higher up--turned it about once or twice--then caught"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13797"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#14)"],[1,"every wish. She has the most brilliant house in the  neighborhood, and lives like a princess.\"    \"And trembles,\" insisted the lieutenant, \"when she hears her husband's  footstep. What good can riches be to her? She would have been happier  with Hallberg.\"    \"I do not know,\" rejoined the captain, \"why you always looked upon  that attachment as something so decided. It never appeared so to  me; and you yourself say that D'Effernay is very jealous, which I  believe him to be, for he is a man of strong passions; and this very  circumstance causes me to doubt the rest of your story. Jealousy has  sharp eyes, and D'Effernay would have discovered a rival in Hallberg,  and not proved himself the friend he always was to our poor comrade.\"    \"That does not follow at all,\" replied the lieutenant, \"it only proves  that the lovers were very cautious. So far, however, I agree with you.  I believe that if D'Effernay had suspected anything of the kind he  would have murdered Hallberg.\"    A shudder passed through Edward's veins.    \"Murdered!\" he repeated, in a hollow voice; \"do you not judge too  harshly of this man when you hint the possibility of such a thing?\"    \"That does he, indeed,\" said the old man; \"these gentlemen are all  angry with D'Effernay, because he has carried off the prettiest girl  in the country. But I am told he does not intend remaining where he  now lives. He wishes to sell his estates.\"    \"Really,\" inquired the captain, \"and where is he going?\"    \"I have no idea,\" replied the other; \"but he is selling everything  off. One manor is already disposed of, and there have been people  already in negotiation for the place where he resides.\"    The conversation now turned on the value of D'Effernay's property, and  of land in general, &c.    Edward had gained materials enough for reflection; he rose soon, took  leave of the company, and gave himself up, in the solitude of his  own room, to the torrent of thought and feeling which that night's  conversation had let loose. So, then, it was true; Emily Varnier was  no fabulous being! Hallberg had loved her, his love had been returned,  but a cruel destiny had separated them. How wonderfully did all he  had heard explain the dream at the Castle, and how completely did  that supply what had remained doubtful, or had been omitted in the  officers' narrative. Emily Varnier, doubtless, possessed that ring, to  gain possession of which now seemed his bounden duty. He resolved not  to delay its fulfillment a moment, however difficult it might prove,  and he only reflected on the best manner in which he should perform  the task allotted to him. The sale of the property appeared to him a  favorable opening. The fame of his father's wealth made it probable  that the son might wish to be purchaser of a fine estate, like the one  in question. He spoke openly of such a project, made inquiries of the  old gentleman, and the captain, who seemed to him to know most about  the matter; and as his duties permitted a trip for a week or so, he  started immediately, and arrived on the second day at the place of his  destination. He stopped in the public house in the village to inquire  if the estate lay near, and whether visitors were allowed to see the  house and grounds. Mine host, who doubtless had had his directions,  sent a messenger immediately to the Castle, who returned before long,  accompanied by a chasseur, in a splendid livery, who invited the  stranger to the Castle in the name of M. D'Effernay.    This was exactly what Edward wished, and expected. Escorted by  the chasseur he soon arrived at the Castle, and was shown up  a spacious staircase into a modern, almost, one might say, a  magnificently-furnished room, where the master of the house received  him. It was evening, toward the end of winter, the shades of twilight  had already fallen, and Edward found himself suddenly in a room quite  illuminated with wax candles. D'Effernay stood in the middle of the  saloon, a tall, thin young man. A proud bearing seemed to bespeak  a consciousness of his own merit, or at least of his position. His  features were finely formed, but the traces of strong passion, or of  internal discontent, had lined them prematurely.    In figure he was very slender, and the deep-sunken eye, the gloomy  frown which was fixed between his brows, and the thin lips, had no  very prepossessing expression, and yet there was something imposing in  the whole appearance of the man.    Edward thanked him civilly for his invitation, spoke of his idea of  being a purchaser as a motive for his visit, and gave his own, and  his father's name. D'Effernay seemed pleased with all he said. He had  known Edward's family in the metropolis; he regretted that the late  hour would render it impossible for them to visit the property to-day,  and concluded by pressing the lieutenant to pass the night at the  Castle. On the morrow they would proceed to business, and now he would  have the pleasure of presenting his wife to the visitor. Edward's  heart beat violently--at length then he would see her! Had he loved  her himself he could not have gone to meet her with more agitation.  D'Effernay led his guest through many rooms, which were all as well  furnished, and as brilliantly lighted as the first he had entered.  At length he opened the door of a small boudoir, where there was no  light, save that which the faint, gray twilight imparted through the  windows.    The simple arrangement of this little room, with dark green walls,  only relieved by some engravings and coats of arms, formed a pleasing  contrast to Edward's eyes, after the glaring splendor of the other  apartments. From behind a piano-forte, at which she had been seated  in a recess, rose a tall, slender female form, in a white dress of  extreme simplicity.    \"My love,\" said D'Effernay, \"I bring you a welcome guest, Lieutenant  Wensleben, who is willing to purchase the estate.\"    Emily courtesied; the friendly twilight concealed the shudder that  passed over her whole frame, as she heard the familiar name which  aroused so many recollections.    She bade the stranger welcome, in a low, sweet voice, whose tremulous  accents were not unobserved by Edward; and while the husband made some  further observation, he had leisure to remark, as well as the fading  light would allow, the fair outline of her oval face, the modest  grace of her movements, her pretty, nymph-like figure--in fact, all  those charms which seemed familiar to him through the impassioned  descriptions of his friend.    \"But what can this fancy be, to sit in the dark?\" asked D'Effernay, in  no mild tone; \"you know that is a thing I cannot bear.\" and with these  words, and without waiting his wife's answer, he rang the bell over  her sofa, and ordered lights.    While these were placed on the table the company sat down by the fire,  and conversation commenced. By the full light Edward could perceive  all Emily's real beauty--her pale, but lovely face, the sad expression  of her large blue eyes, so often concealed by their dark lashes, and  then raised, with a look full of feeling, a sad, pensive, intellectual  expression; and he admired the simplicity of her dress, and of every  object that surrounded her: all appeared to him to bespeak a superior  mind.    They had not sat long, before D'Effernay was called away. One of  his people had something important, something urgent to communicate  to him, which admitted of no delay. A look of fierce anger almost  distorted his features; in an instant his thin lips moved rapidly, and  Edward thought he muttered some curses between his teeth. He left the  room, but in so doing, he cast a glance of mistrust and ill-temper  on the handsome stranger with whom he was compelled to leave his wife  alone. Edward observed it all. All that he had seen to-day, all that  he had heard from his comrades of the man's passionate and suspicious  disposition, convinced him that his stay here would not be long, and  that perhaps a second opportunity of speaking alone with Emily might  not offer itself.    He determined, therefore, to profit by the present moment; and no  sooner had D'Effernay left the room, than he began to tell Emily she  was not so complete a stranger to him as it might seem; that long  before he had had the pleasure of seeing her--even before he had heard  her name--she was known to him, so to speak, in spirit.    Madame D'Effernay was moved. She was silent for a time, and gazed  fixedly on the ground; then she looked up; the mist of unshed tears  dimmed her blue eyes, and her bosom heaved with the sigh she could not  suppress.    \"To me also the name of Wensleben is familiar. There is a link between  our souls. Your friend has often spoken of you to me.\"    But she could say no more; tears checked her speech.    Edward's eyes were glistening also, and the two companions were  silent; at length he began once more:    \"My dear lady,\" he said, \"my time is short, and I have a solemn  message to deliver to you. Will you allow me to do so now?\"    \"To me?\" she asked, in a tone of astonishment.    \"From my departed friend,\" answered Edward, emphatically.    \"From Ferdinand?--and that now--after--\" she shrunk back, as if in  terror.    \"Now that he is no longer with us, do you mean? I found the message  in his papers, which have been intrusted to me only lately, since I  have been in the neighborhood. Among them was a token which I was to  restore to you.\" He produced the ring. Emily seized it wildly, and  trembled as she looked upon it.    \"It is indeed my ring,\" she said at length, \"the same which I gave  him when we plighted our troth in secret. You are acquainted with  everything, I perceive; I shall therefore risk nothing if I speak  openly.\"    She wept, and pressed the ring to her lips.    \"I see that my friend's memory is dear to you,\" continued Edward. You  will forgive the prayer I am about to make to you: my visit to you  concerns his ring."]]]
