There was a regiment of cuirassiers which stood whole to the last,  and fought like lions; they went ranging over the field when all  their army was broken, and nobody cared for charging them; they were  commanded by Baron Kronenburg, and at last went off from the battle  whole. These were armed in black armour from head to foot, and they  carried off their general. About six o'clock the field was cleared of  the enemy, except at one place on the king's side, where some of them  rallied, and though they knew all was lost would take no quarter, but  fought it out to the last man, being found dead the next day in rank  and file as they were drawn up.    I had the good fortune to receive no hurt in this battle, excepting  a small scratch on the side of my neck by the push of a pike; but my  friend received a very dangerous wound when the battle was as good as  over. He had engaged with a German colonel, whose name we could never  learn, and having killed his man, and pressed very close upon him,  so that he had shot his horse, the horse in the fall kept the colonel  down, lying on one of his legs; upon which he demanded quarter, which  Captain Fielding granting, helped him to quit his horse, and having  disarmed him, was bringing him into the line, when the regiment of  cuirassiers, which I mentioned, commanded by Baron Kronenburg, came  roving over the field, and with a flying charge saluted our front with  a salvo of carabine shot, which wounded us a great many men, and among  the rest the captain received a shot in his thigh, which laid him on  the ground, and being separated from the line, his prisoner got away  with them.    This was the first service I was in, and indeed I never saw any fight  since maintained with such gallantry, such desperate valour, together  with such dexterity of management, both sides being composed of  soldiers fully tried, bred to the wars, expert in everything, exact in  their order, and incapable of fear, which made the battle be much more  bloody than usual. Sir John Hepburn, at my request, took particular  care of my comrade, and sent his own surgeon to look after him;  and afterwards, when the city of Leipsic was retaken, provided him  lodgings there, and came very often to see him; and indeed I was in  great care for him too, the surgeons being very doubtful of him a  great while; for having lain in the field all night among the dead,  his wound, for want of dressing, and with the extremity of cold, was  in a very ill condition, and the pain of it had thrown him into a  fever. 'Twas quite dusk before the fight ended, especially where the  last rallied troops fought so long, and therefore we durst not break  our order to seek out our friends, so that 'twas near seven o'clock  the next morning before we found the captain, who, though very weak by  the loss of blood, had raised himself up, and placed his back against  the buttock of a dead horse. I was the first that knew him, and  running to him, embraced him with a great deal of joy; he was not able  to speak, but made signs to let me see he knew me, so we brought him  into the camp, and Sir John Hepburn, as I noted before, sent his own  surgeons to look after him.    The darkness of the night prevented any pursuit, and was the only  refuge the enemy had left: for had there been three hours more  daylight ten thousand more lives had been lost, for the Swedes (and  Saxons especially) enraged by the obstinacy of the enemy, were so  thoroughly heated that they would have given quarter but to few. The  retreat was not sounded till seven o'clock, when the king drew up the  whole army upon the field of battle, and gave strict command that none  should stir from their order; so the army lay under their arms all  night, which was another reason why the wounded soldiers suffered very  much by the cold; for the king, who had a bold enemy to deal with, was  not ignorant what a small body of desperate men rallied together might  have done in the darkness of the night, and therefore he lay in his  coach all night at the head of the line, though it froze very hard.    As soon as the day began to peep the trumpets sounded to horse, and  all the dragoons and light-horse in the army were commanded to the  pursuit. The cuirassiers and some commanded musketeers advanced some  miles, if need were, to make good their retreat, and all the foot  stood to their arms for a reverse; but in half-an-hour word was  brought to the king that the enemy were quite dispersed, upon which  detachments were made out of every regiment to search among the dead  for any of our friends that were wounded; and the king himself gave a  strict order, that if any were found wounded and alive among the enemy  none should kill them, but take care to bring them into the camp--a  piece of humanity which saved the lives of near a thousand of the  enemies.    This piece of service being over, the enemy's camp was seized upon,  and the soldiers were permitted to plunder it; all the cannon, arms,  and ammunition was secured for the king's use, the rest was given up  to the soldiers, who found so much plunder that they had no reason to  quarrel for shares.    For my share, I was so busy with my wounded captain that I got nothing  but a sword, which I found just by him when I first saw him; but my  man brought me a very good horse with a furniture on him, and one  pistol of extraordinary workmanship.    I bade him get upon his back and make the best of the day for himself,  which he did, and I saw him no more till three days after, when he  found me out at Leipsic, so richly dressed that I hardly knew him; and  after making his excuse for his long absence, gave me a very pleasant  account where he had been. He told me that, according to my order,  being mounted on the horse he had brought me, he first rid into the  field among the dead to get some clothes suitable to the equipage of  his horse, and having seized on a laced coat, a helmet, a sword, and  an extraordinary good cane, was resolved to see what was become of the  enemy; and following the track of the dragoons, which he could  easily do by the bodies on the road, he fell in with a small party  of twenty-five dragoons, under no command but a corporal, making to  a village where some of the enemies' horse had been quartered. The  dragoons, taking him for an officer by his horse, desired him to  command them, told him the enemy was very rich, and they doubted not  a good booty. He was a bold, brisk fellow, and told them, with all  his heart, but said he had but one pistol, the other being broken with  firing; so they lent him a pair of pistols, and a small piece they had  taken, and he led them on. There had been a regiment of horse and  some troops of Crabats in the village, but they were fled on the first  notice of the pursuit, excepting three troops, and these, on sight  of this small party, supposing them to be only the first of a greater  number, fled in the greatest confusion imaginable. They took the  village, and about fifty horses, with all the plunder of the enemy,  and with the heat of the service he had spoiled my horse, he said, for  which he had brought me two more; for he, passing for the commander of  the party, had all the advantage the custom of war gives an officer in  like cases.    I was very well pleased with the relation the fellow gave me, and,  laughing at him, \"Well, captain,\" said I, \"and what plunder have ye  got?\" \"Enough to make me a captain, sir,\" says he, \"if you please, and  a troop ready raised too; for the party of dragoons are posted in the  village by my command, till they have farther orders.\" In short,  he pulled out sixty or seventy pieces of gold, five or six watches,  thirteen or fourteen rings, whereof two were diamond rings, one of  which was worth fifty dollars, silver as much as his pockets would  hold; besides that he had brought three horses, two of which were  laden with baggage, and a boor he had hired to stay with them at  Leipsic till he had found me out. \"But I am afraid, captain,\" says I,  \"you have plundered the village instead of plundering the enemy.\" \"No  indeed, not we,\" says he, \"but the Crabats had done it for us and we  light of them just as they were carrying it off.\" \"Well,\" said I, \"but  what will you do with your men, for when you come to give them orders  they will know you well enough?\" \"No, no,\" says he, \"I took care of  that, for just now I gave a soldier five dollars to carry them news  that the army was marched to Merseburg, and that they should follow  thither to the regiment.\"    Having secured his money in my lodgings, he asked me if I pleased to  see his horses, and to have one for myself? I told him I would go and  see them in the afternoon; but the fellow being impatient goes and  fetches them. There were three horses, one whereof was a very good  one, and by the furniture was an officer's horse of the Crabats, and  that my man would have me accept, for the other he had spoiled, as  he said. I was but indifferently horsed before, so I accepted of the  horse, and went down with him to see the rest of his plunder there.  He had got three or four pair of pistols, two or three bundles of  officers' linen, and lace, a field-bed, and a tent, and several other  things of value; but at last, coming to a small fardel, \"And this,\"  says he, \"I took whole from a Crabat running away with it under his  arm,\" so he brought it up into my chamber. He had not looked into it,  he said, but he understood 'twas some plunder the soldiers had made,  and finding it heavy took it by consent. We opened it and found it was  a bundle of some linen, thirteen or fourteen pieces of plate, and in a  small cup, three rings, a fine necklace of pearl and the value of 100  rix-dollars in money.    The fellow was amazed at his own good fortune, and hardly knew what  to do"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1226"],[0,"The Journal of Abnormal Psychology, Volume 10 (#14)"],[1,"discontinues; the superconsciousness no longer works.    The scenes described are usually recalled by the patients, just as they were  experienced by them, even when taken from the earliest youth.  The reality  of the events which happened in childhood, lived over again in hypnose, are  substantiated as much as possible by the patient's parents or associates. He  succeeds best in inducing this semi-sleep by exhorting the patient as he  closes his eyes not to bother about whether he sleeps or not, but to fasten  his attention upon the scenes which are about to present themselves; that  is, to think himself, so to speak, into the state of someone at a moving  picture show.    As an example I give a fragment of a Frankian analysis of a case of    FEAR NEUROSIS (ANGST-NEUROSE)    Y. B., born 1883, a law clerk.  Patient comes on the third of December,  1908, to Frank's consultation hour; he complains of periods of short breath;  during these he feels as if his heart were ceasing to beat, especially when  he is just going to bed. He feels then as if something heavy were striking  him on the chest, great restlessness, and a feeling of faintness comes over  him. After taking a glass of wine the condition is aggravated and becomes  insupportable.  These attacks come once or twice a day, mostly in the  evenings.  At times they keep off for eight or ten days. He lives  continually in an excited state, he suffers from palpitations of the heart,  from pain in the left thigh, pain in the left side, and at night cannot get  to sleep.    Patient attributes this condition to an automobile accident which happened  to him on June 2, 1908.  Even before this accident he had been a trifle  nervous on account of overwork.  In the automobile accident he had been  thrown out, and had been thrown a distance of ten or fifteen yards. The  automobile, which was at high speed, had also plunged down the decline, but  luckily the patient was not caught directly under the machine.  He did not  lose consciousness, and escaped with some scratches and a bad fright; it was  a marvel that he and the chauffeur escaped with their lives. He plainly  recalls thinking, during the fall, that his last hour had come, and even yet  is amazed how extremely untroubled he had been by that thought. The days  following the accident he felt as if his face were burning, and he was  inwardly agitated whenever he thought of an automobile. On June 30, 1908, he  was obliged to take a business journey. While seated in the station  restaurant it suddenly grew dark before his eyes. He could breathe only with  difficulty, his heartbeats were irregular and he had a strange sensation of  fear.  This condition lasted the whole day. On the return journey his train  ran into an automobile truck. The patient was thrown to the floor of the  coupe by the shock. This incident made a great impression upon him;  nevertheless, for eight days he was free from the uneasiness already  described.  After that an attack of fear again set in, continuing at  intervals, with periods of greater or lesser violence, until the present.    December 7, 1908.  A first attempt to induce hypnosis was successful.    December 8, 1908.  Patient goes to sleep immediately, becomes frightened and  gives frequent signs of terror. When awakened, he mentioned that he had had  a feeling as if he were falling into a hole, that had given him a very  strange sensation.  The patient speaks while he sleeps; his  super-consciousness therefore remains awake and is able to take notice  directly of the scene taking place. After some minutes he sees in the  hypnosis a locomotive approaching. He cries out, \"There it comes out of the  tunnel.\" He is afraid of being run over, and is terrified. Two years  previously he had been through this scene. He was standing on the track when  a train approached, and he was afraid of being run over.  In his sleep, the  patient communicates the details and sees everything clearly. After a short  interval of complete rest, he begins to breathe heavily, his pulse quickens,  then he cries out in fright and excitement and dread, \"Now it's coming, now  the auto's coming, it's turning over, we're under it, there it's riding over  us!\" Gradually he quiets down again, and after a quarter of an hour, awakes.  He says he now feels something lifted from his chest, that he has slept  well, and feels better. He recalls everything.  The train came out of the  tunnel with gleaming lights; this scene took place in the evening. The  automobile scene was reproduced precisely as he had taken part in it, no  detail escaped him; his breathing is unobstructed now, and he has no more  heart palpitations.    On the day appointed for the seance I was unexpectedly obliged to go away.  When I wished to resume the treatment, January 9, the patient wrote me that  his condition was strikingly improved, the heart palpitations and feelings  of anxiety had not reappeared. His pleasure in life and work had returned  once more, his night's rest left nothing to be desired, his appetite was  excellent, therefore he thought that further treatment was not necessary for  the present. To a later inquiry, February 12, 1910, a year afterwards, I  obtained this answer:  \"Without exaggeration I am able to write you that in  my whole life I have never felt so well as now. There has been no question  of any nervous attacks or feelings of dread. My weight, which had gone down  to fifty-eight kilos during my nervous sickness, has gone up to seventy  kilos.\"    When Frank shuts himself up with his patients in a room, from which all  outer noises are excluded as much as possible, by means of double windows  and doors, although he--by means of electric light signals visible to him  alone--keeps in touch with the servant outside, he has the patient recline  as comfortably as possible upon a low sofa. He kneels on a cushion at the  head, bends down over the patient and has the latter look upwards directly  into his eyes. Meanwhile he lets his left hand rest upon the patient's  forehead and gently presses the latter's eyelids with his thumb and  forefinger. As soon as the patient shows signs of weariness, he carefully  gets up, takes a seat next to the patient and continues carefully observant  of the latter's behavior and expression of countenance. He makes note of  everything that shows itself and rouses the patient after about a quarter of  an hour, unless the latter awakes spontaneously. Now he talks over with him  the material which has been procured and then has the patient go into a  renewed hypnosis, until the end of an hour. Sometimes the seances are  protracted when important scenes come up, and in the interest of the  treatment it might be lengthened to two or even three hours.    Bezzola makes use of a small, light, black silk mask, which he puts on the  eyes of the patient.  He induces hypnosis, and for the rest follows Frank's  technique already described.    While analysts who avail themselves of hypnosis as a means of help have all  their patients take a reclining position, those who have given up hypnotism  in their treatment, have also given up this reclining position. Freud  continues to prefer having the patient assume a reclining position, and  takes his position with his back to the patient, behind the head of the  sofa. He considers that this manner of treatment induces the greatest  calmness in the patient and makes it easier for him to express himself and  to confess. He keeps as quiet as possible, listens with undivided attention,  does not take any notes during the seance, not wishing to give rise to the  suspicion that all the confession will be written down and perhaps seen by  other eyes.    Jung receives the patient in his study just as he would receive any ordinary  visitor.  He thinks that in this way the patient is put most at his ease and  that it makes him feel he is not considered as a patient, but rather as some  one who, being in difficulties, comes to ask advice and needs to tell his  troubles to a trusted friend. Even less than Freud does he take notes in the  presence of the patient.    Stekel does as Jung, the only difference being that he remains seated at his  writing-table and makes notes of the most important points.    The most satisfactory way for the uninitiated to make himself familiar with  the technique of psychoanalysis is to submit himself to psychoanalysis. For  that purpose one turns to an experienced analyst, and takes to him one's  ideas and dreams.  Consequently I submitted myself for two months to  analysis from Dr. Jung, who in that way initiated me into the practice of  psychological investigation.  The interpretation of one's own dreams,  reading and studying of the principal literature about analytical psychology  or deep psychology, as Bleuler calls it; and the application of what is thus  learned, at the start to simple, later to more difficult cases, must do the  rest in making an independent investigator in this branch of psycho-therapy.    As has already been said, psychoanalysis aims at bringing into consciousness  all the forgotten things.  When all the gaps in the memory are filled in,  when all the puzzling operations of the psychological life are explained,  then the continuance and the return of the suffering has become impossible.  The attainment of this ideal state is truly the attainment of Utopia.  Most  certainly a treatment does not need to be carried so far. One may be  satisfied with the practical cure of the patient, with the restoration of  his power for work, and with the abolition of the most difficult functional  disturbances.    It is applicable in cases of chronic psychoneurosis which exhibit no  difficult or dangerous phenomena. Among these are counted all sorts of  compulsive neuroses, compulsive thoughts, compulsive behavior and cases of  hysteria, where phobias and obsessions play a chief role, also somatic  phenomena of hysteria which do "]]]
