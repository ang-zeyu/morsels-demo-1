The gymnasia were universally frequented; and the  great prizes of the games, bestowed for feats of strength and agility,  were regarded as the highest honors which men could receive,--the  subject of the poet's ode and the people's admiration. Statues of the  victors perpetuated their fame and improved the sculptor's art. From the  study of these statues were produced those great creations which all  subsequent ages have admired; and from the application of the principles  seen in these forms we owe the perpetuation of the ideas of grace and  beauty such as no other people besides the Greeks had ever discovered,  or indeed scarcely appreciated. The sculpture of the human figure became  a noble object of ambition in Greece, and was most munificently  rewarded. Great artists arose, whose works adorned the temples of Greece  so long as she preserved her independence, and when that was lost, her  priceless productions were scattered over Asia and Europe. The Romans  especially seized what was most prized, whether or not they could tell  what was most perfect. Greece lived in her marble statues more than in  her government or laws; and when we remember the estimation in which  sculpture was held among the Greeks, the great prices paid for  masterpieces, the care and attention with which they were guarded and  preserved, and the innumerable works which were produced, filling all  the public buildings, especially consecrated places, and even open  spaces and the houses of the rich and great, calling from all classes  admiration and praise,--we cannot think it likely that so great  perfection will ever be reached again in those figures which are  designed to represent beauty of form. Even the comparatively few statues  which have survived the wars and violence of two thousand years,  convince us that the moderns can only imitate; they can produce no  creations equal to those by Athenian artists. \"No mechanical copying of  Greek statues, however skilful the copyist, can ever secure for modern  sculpture the same noble and effective character it possessed among the  Greeks, for the simple reason that the imitation, close as may be the  resemblance, is but the result of the eye and hand, while the original  is the expression of a true and deeply felt sentiment. Art was not  sustained by the patronage of a few who affect to have what is called  _taste_; in Greece the artist, having a common feeling for the beautiful  with his countrymen, produced his works for the public, which were  erected in places of honor and dedicated in temples of the gods.\"    It was not until the Persian wars awakened among the Greeks the  slumbering consciousness of national power, and Athens became the  central point of Grecian civilization, that sculpture, like architecture  and painting, reached its culminating point of excellence under Phidias  and his contemporaries. Great artists had previously made themselves  famous, like Miron, Polycletus, and Ageladas; but the great riches which  flowed into Athens at this time gave a peculiar stimulus to art,  especially under the encouragement of such a ruler as Pericles, whose  age was the golden era of Grecian history.    Pheidias, or Phidias, was to sculpture what Aeschylus was to tragic  poetry,--the representative of the sublime and grand. He was born four  hundred and eighty-four years before Christ, and was the pupil of  Ageladas. He stands at the head of the ancient sculptors, not from what  _we_ know of him, for his masterpieces have perished, but from the  estimation in which he was held by the greatest critics of antiquity. It  was to him that Pericles intrusted the adornment of the Parthenon, and  the numerous and beautiful sculptures of the frieze and the pediment  were the work of artists whom he directed. His great work in that  wonderful edifice was the statue of the goddess Minerva herself, made of  gold and ivory, forty feet in height, standing victorious, with a spear  in her left hand and an image of victory in her right, with helmet on  her head, and her shield resting by her side. The cost of this statue  may be estimated when we consider that the gold alone used upon it was  valued at forty-four talents, equal to five hundred thousand dollars of  our money,--an immense sum in that age. Some critics suppose that this  statue was overloaded with ornament, but all antiquity was unanimous in  its admiration. The exactness and finish of detail were as remarkable as  the grandeur of the proportions. Another of the famous works of Phidias  was a colossal bronze statue of Athene Promachos, sixty feet in height,  on the Acropolis between the Propylaea and the Parthenon. But both of  these yielded to the colossal statue of Zeus in his great temple at  Olympia, represented in a sitting posture, forty feet high, on a  pedestal of twenty feet. The god was seated on a throne. Ebony, gold,  ivory, and precious stones formed, with a multitude of sculptured and  painted figures, the wonderful composition of this throne. In this his  greatest work the artist sought to embody the idea of majesty and  repose,--of a supreme deity no longer engaged in war with Titans and  Giants, but enthroned as a conqueror, ruling with a nod the subject  world, and giving his blessing to those victories which gave glory to  the Greeks. So famous was this statue, which was regarded as the  masterpiece of Grecian art, that it was considered a calamity to die  without having seen it; and this served for a model for all subsequent  representations of majesty and power in repose among the ancients. It  was removed to Constantinople by Theodosius I., and was destroyed by  fire in the year 475 A.D. Phidias executed various other famous works,  which have perished; but even those that were executed under his  superintendence which have come down to our times,--like the statues  which ornamented the pediment of the Parthenon,--are among the finest  specimens of art that exist, and exhibit the most graceful and  appropriate forms which could have been selected, uniting grandeur with  simplicity, and beauty with accuracy of anatomical structure. His  distinguishing excellence was ideal beauty, and that of the  sublimest order.    Of all the wonders and mysteries of ancient art the colossal statues of  ivory and gold were perhaps the most remarkable, and the difficulty of  executing them has been set forth by the ablest of modern critics, like  Winckelmann, Heyne, and De Quincey. \"The grandeur of their dimensions,  the perfection of their workmanship, the richness of their materials,  their majesty, beauty, and ideal truth, the splendor of the architecture  and pictorial decoration with which they were associated,--all conspired  to impress the beholder with wonder and awe, and induce a belief of the  actual presence of the god.\"    After the Peloponnesian War a new school of art arose in Athens, which  appealed more to the passions. Of this school was Praxiteles, who aimed  to please without seeking to elevate or instruct. No one has probably  ever surpassed him in execution. He wrought in bronze and marble, and  was one of the artists who adorned the Mausoleum of Artemisia. Without  attempting the sublime impersonation of the deity, in which Phidias  excelled, he was unsurpassed in the softer graces and beauties of the  human form, especially in female figures. His most famous work was an  undraped statue of Venus, for his native town of Cnidus, which was so  remarkable that people flocked from all parts of Greece to see it. He  did not aim at ideal majesty so much as at ideal gracefulness; his works  were formed from the most beautiful living models, and hence expressed  only the ideal of sensuous charms. It is probable that the Venus de  Medici of Cleomenes was a mere copy of the Aphrodite of Praxiteles,  which was so highly extolled by, the ancient authors; it was of Parian  marble, and modelled from the celebrated Phryne. His statues of Dionysus  also expressed the most consummate physical beauty, representing the god  as a beautiful youth crowned with ivy, and expressing tender and dreamy  emotions. Praxiteles sculptured several figures of Eros, or the god of  love, of which that at Thespiae attracted visitors to the city in the  time of Cicero. It was subsequently carried to Rome, and perished by a  conflagration in the time of Titus. One of the most celebrated statues  of this artist was an Apollo, many copies of which still exist. His  works were very numerous, but chiefly from the circle of Dionysus,  Aphrodite, and Eros, in which adoration for corporeal attractions is the  most marked peculiarity, and for which the artist was fitted by his  dissolute life.    Scopas was the contemporary of Praxiteles, and was the author of the  celebrated group of Niobe, which is one of the chief ornaments of the  gallery of sculpture at Florence. He flourished about three hundred and  fifty years before Christ, and wrought chiefly in marble. He was  employed in decorating the Mausoleum which Artemisia erected to her  husband,--one of the wonders of the world. His masterpiece is said to  have been a group representing Achilles conducted to the island of Leuce  by the divinities of the sea, which ornamented the shrine of Domitius in  the Flaminian Circus. In this, tender grace, heroic grandeur, daring  power, and luxurious fulness of life were combined with wonderful  harmony. Like the other great artists of this school, Scopas exhibited  the grandeur and sublimity for which Phidias was celebrated, but a  greater refinement and luxury, as well as skill in the use of drapery.    Sculpture in Greece culminated, as an art, in Lysippus, who worked  chiefly in bronze. He is said to have executed fifteen hundred statues,  and was much esteemed by Alexander the Great, by whom he was extensively  patronized. He represented men not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10542"],[0,"The Boats of the \"Glen Carrig\" (#14)"],[1,", and had a very formidable appearance; yet it  proved to be a most tasty matter for our supper, when it had been placed  for a while in boiling water.    Now so soon as this man was returned, we made at once for the camp,  carrying with us the piece of timber which we had hewn from the topmast.  By this time it was quite dusk, and very strange amid the great fungi as  we struck across the upper edge of the valley to the opposite beach.  Particularly, I noticed that the hateful, mouldy odor of these monstrous  vegetables was more offensive than I had found it to be in the daytime;  though this may be because I used my nose the more, in that I could not  use my eyes to any great extent.    We had gotten halfway across the top of the valley, and the gloom was  deepening steadily, when there stole to me upon the calmness of the  evening air, a faint smell; something quite different from that of the  surrounding fungi. A moment later I got a great whiff of it, and was near  sickened with the abomination of it; but the memory of that foul thing  which had come to the side of the boat in the dawn-gloom, before we  discovered the island, roused me to a terror beyond that of the sickness  of my stomach; for, suddenly, I knew what manner of thing it was that had  beslimed my face and throat upon the previous night, and left its hideous  stench lingering in my nostrils. And with the knowledge, I cried out to  the bo'sun to make haste, for there were demons with us in the valley.  And at that, some of the men made to run; but he bade them, in a very  grim voice, stay where they were, and keep well together, else would they  be attacked and overcome, straggled all among the fungi in the dark. And  this, being, I doubt not, as much in fear of the rounding dark as of the  bo'sun, they did, and so we came safely out of the valley; though there  seemed to follow us a little lower down the slope an uncanny slithering.    Now so soon as we reached the camp, the bo'sun ordered four fires to be  lit--one on each side of the tent, and this we did, lighting them at the  embers of our old fire, which we had most foolishly allowed to die down.  When the fires had been got going, we put on the boiler, and treated the  great crab as I have already mentioned, and so fell-to upon a very hearty  supper; but, as we ate, each man had his weapon stuck in the sand beside  him; for we had knowledge that the valley held some devilish thing, or  maybe many; though the knowing did not spoil our appetites.    And so, presently, we came to an end of eating, whereat each man pulled  out his pipe, intending to smoke; but the bo'sun told one of the men to  get him upon his feet and keep watch, else might we be in danger of  surprise, with every man lolling upon the sand; and this seemed to me  very good sense; for it was easy to see that the men, too readily, deemed  themselves secure, by reason of the brightness of the fires about them.    Now, whilst the men were taking their ease within the circle of the  fires, the bo'sun lit one of the dips which we had out of the ship in the  creek, and went in to see how Job was, after the day's rest. At that, I  rose up, reproaching myself for having forgotten the poor lad, and  followed the bo'sun into the tent. Yet, I had but reached the opening,  when he gave out a loud cry, and held the candle low down to the sand. At  that, I saw the reason for his agitation, for, in the place where we had  left Job, there was nothing. I stepped into the tent, and, in the same  instant, there came to my nostrils the faint odor of the horrible stench  which had come to me in the valley, and before then from the thing that  came to the side of the boat. And, suddenly, I knew that Job had fallen  prey of those foul things, and, knowing this, I called out to the bo'sun  that _they_ had taken the boy, and then my eyes caught the smear of slime  upon the sand, and I had proof that I was not mistaken.    Now, so soon as the bo'sun knew all that was in my mind; though indeed it  did but corroborate that which had come to his own, he came swiftly out  from the tent, bidding the men to stand back; for they had come all about  the entrance, being very much discomposed at that which the bo'sun had  discovered. Then the bo'sun took from a bundle of the reeds, which they  had cut at the time when he had bidden them gather fuel, several of the  thickest, and to one of these he bound a great mass of the dry weed;  whereupon the men, divining his intention, did likewise with the others,  and so we had each of us the wherewithal for a mighty torch.    So soon as we had completed our preparations, we took each man his weapon  and, plunging our torches into the fires, set off along the track which  had been made by the devil-things and the body of poor Job; for now that  we had suspicion that harm had come to him, the marks in the sand, and  the slime, were very plain to be seen, so that it was a wonder that we  had not discovered them earlier.    Now the bo'sun led the way, and, finding the marks led direct to the  valley, he broke into a run, holding his torch well above his head. At  that, each of us did likewise; for we had a great desire to be together,  and further than this, I think with truth I may say, we were all fierce  to avenge Job, so that we had less of fear in our hearts than otherwise  had been the case.    In less than the half of a minute we had reached the end of the valley;  but here, the ground being of a nature not happy in the revealing of  tracks, we were at fault to know in which direction to continue. At that,  the bo'sun set up a loud shout to Job, perchance he might be yet alive;  but there came no answer to us, save a low and uncomfortable echo. Then  the bo'sun, desiring to waste no more time, ran straight down towards the  center of the valley, and we followed, and kept our eyes very open about  us. We had gotten perhaps halfway, when one of the men shouted that he  saw something ahead; but the bo'sun had seen it earlier; for he was  running straight down upon it, holding his torch high and swinging his  great cutlass. Then, instead of smiting, he fell upon his knees beside  it, and the following instant we were up with him, and in that same  moment it seemed to me that I saw a number of white shapes melt swiftly  into the shadows further ahead: but I had no thought for these when I  perceived that by which the bo'sun knelt; for it was the stark body of  Job, and no inch of it but was covered with the little ringed marks that  I had discovered upon my throat, and from every place there ran a trickle  of blood, so that he was a most horrid and fearsome sight.    At the sight of Job so mangled and be-bled, there came over us the sudden  quiet of a mortal terror, and in that space of silence, the bo'sun placed  his hand over the poor lad's heart; but there was no movement, though the  body was still warm. Immediately upon that, he rose to his feet, a look  of vast wrath upon his great face. He plucked his torch from the ground,  into which he had plunged the haft, and stared round into the silence of  the valley; but there was no living thing in sight, nothing save the  giant fungi and the strange shadows cast by our great torches, and the  loneliness.    At this moment, one of the men's torches, having burnt near out, fell all  to pieces, so that he held nothing but the charred support, and  immediately two more came to a like end. Upon this, we became afraid that  they would not last us back to the camp, and we looked to the bo'sun to  know his wish; but the man was very silent, and peering everywhere into  the shadows. Then a fourth torch fell to the ground in a shower of  embers, and I turned to look. In the same instant there came a great  flare of light behind me, accompanied by the dull thud of a dry matter  set suddenly alight. I glanced swiftly back to the bo'sun, and he was  staring up at one of the giant toadstools which was in flames all along  its nearer edge, and burning with an incredible fury, sending out spirits  of flame, and anon giving out sharp reports, and at each report, a fine  powder was belched in thin streams; which, getting into our throats and  nostrils, set us sneezing and coughing most lamentably; so that I am  convinced, had any enemy come upon us at that moment, we had been undone  by reason of our uncouth helplessness.    Now whether it had come to the bo'sun to set alight this first of the  fungi, I know not; for it may be that his torch coming by chance against  it, set it afire. However it chanced, the bo'sun took it as a veritable  hint from Providence, and was already setting his torch to one a little  further off, whilst the rest of us were near to choking with our  coughings and sneezings. Yet, that we were so suddenly overcome by the  potency of the powder, I doubt if a full minute passed before we were  each one busied after the manner of the bo'sun; and those whose torches  had burned out, knocked flaming pieces from the burning fungus, and with  these impaled upon their torch-sticks, did so much execution as any.    And thus it happened that within five minutes of this discovery of Job's  body, the whole of that hideous valley sent up to heaven the reek of its  burning; whilst we, filled with murderous desires, ran hither and thither  with our weapons, seeking to destroy the vile creatures that had brought  the poor lad to so unholy a death. Yet nowhere could we discover any  brute or creature upon which to ease our vengeance, and so, presently,  the valley becoming impassable by reason of the heat, the flying sparks  and the abundance of the acrid dust, we made back to the body of the boy,  and bore him thence to the shore.    And during all that night no man of us slept, and the burning of the  fungi sent up a mighty pillar of flame out of the valley, as out of the  mouth of a monstrous pit and when the morning came it still burned. Then  when it was daylight, some "]]]
