And you have no good sense to be asking  this thing of me when here are the servants of Arthur, that is now  King of the Britons, come to ask for my daughter as his wife. That  you are Duke of Logreus you tell me, and I concede a duke is all  very well: but I expect you in return to concede a king takes  precedence, with any man whose daughter is marriageable. But  to-morrow or the next day it may be, you and I will talk over  your reward more privately. Meanwhile it is very queer and very  frightened you are looking, to be the champion who conquered  Thragnar.\"    For Jurgen was staring at the great mirror behind the King's throne.  In this mirror Jurgen saw the back of Gogyrvan's crowned head, and  beyond this, Jurgen saw a queer and frightened looking young fellow,  with sleek black hair, and an impudent nose, and wide-open bright  brown eyes which were staring hard at Jurgen: and the lad's very red  and very heavy lips were parted, so that you saw what fine strong  teeth he had: and he wore a glittering shirt with curious figures on  it    \"I was thinking,\" says Jurgen, and he saw the lad in the mirror was  speaking too, \"I was thinking that is a remarkable mirror you have  there.\"    \"It is like any other mirror,\" replies the King, \"in that it shows  things as they are. But if you fancy it as your reward, why, take it  and welcome.\"    \"And are you still talking of rewards!\" cries Jurgen. \"Why, if that  mirror shows things as they are, I have come out of my borrowed  Wednesday still twenty-one. Oh, but it was the clever fellow I was,  to flatter Mother Sereda so cunningly, and to fool her into such  generosity! And I wonder that you who are only a king, with bleared  eyes under your crown, and with a drooping belly under all your  royal robes, should be talking of rewarding a fine young fellow of  twenty-one, for there is nothing you have which I need be wanting  now.\"    \"Then you will not be plaguing me any more with your nonsense about  my daughter: and that is excellent news.\"    \"But I have no requirement to be asking your good graces now,\" said  Jurgen, \"nor the good will of any man alive that has a handsome  daughter or a handsome wife. For now I have the aid of a lad that  was very recently made Duke of Logreus: and with his countenance I  can look out for myself, and I can get justice done me everywhere,  in all the bedchambers of the world.\"    And Jurgen snapped his fingers, and was about to turn away from the  King. There was much sunlight in the hall, so that Jurgen in this  half-turn confronted his shadow as it lay plain upon the flagstones.  And Jurgen looked at it very intently.    \"Of course,\" said Jurgen presently, \"I only meant in a manner of  speaking, sir: and was paraphrasing the splendid if hackneyed  passage from Sornatius, with which you are doubtless familiar, in  which he goes on to say, so much more beautifully than I could  possibly express without quoting him word for word, that all this  was spoken jestingly, and without the least intention of offending  anybody, oh, anybody whatever, I can assure you, sir.\"    \"Very well,\" said Gogyrvan Gawr: and he smiled, for no reason that  was apparent to Jurgen, who was still watching his shadow sidewise.  \"To-morrow, I repeat, I must talk with you more privately. To-day I  am giving a banquet such as was never known in these parts, because  my daughter is restored to me, and because my daughter is going to  be queen over all the Britons.\"    So said Gogyrvan, that was King of Glathion and Lord of Enisgarth  and Camwy and Sargyll: and this was done. And everywhere at the  banquet Jurgen heard talk of this King Arthur who was to marry Dame  Guenevere, and of the prophecy which Merlin Ambrosius had made as to  the young monarch. For Merlin had predicted:    \"He shall afford succor, and shall tread upon the necks of his  enemies: the isles of the ocean shall be subdued by him, and he  shall possess the forests of Gaul: the house of Romulus shall fear  his rage, and his acts shall be food for the narrators.\"    \"Why, then,\" says Jurgen, to himself, \"this monarch reminds me in  all things of David of Israel, who was so splendid and famous, and  so greedy, in the ancient ages. For to these forests and islands and  necks and other possessions, this Arthur Pendragon must be adding my  one ewe lamb; and I lack a Nathan to convert him to repentance. Now,  but this, to be sure, is a very unfair thing.\"    Then Jurgen looked again into a mirror: and presently the eyes of  the lad he found therein began to twinkle.    \"Have at you, David!\" said Jurgen, valorously; \"since after all, I  see no reason to despair.\"          12.    Excursus of Yolande's Undoing      Now Jurgen, self-appointed Duke of Logreus, abode at the court of  King Gogyrvan. The month of May passed quickly and pleasantly: but  the monstrous shadow which followed Jurgen did not pass. Still, no  one noticed it: that was the main thing. For himself, he was not  afraid of shadows, and the queerness of this one was not enough to  distract his thoughts from Guenevere, nor from his love-making with  Guenevere.    For these were quiet times in Glathion, now that the war with Rience  of Northgalis was satisfactorily ended: and love-making was now  everywhere in vogue. By way of diversion, gentlemen hunted and  fished and rode a-hawking and amicably slashed and battered one  another in tournaments: but their really serious pursuit was  lovemaking, after the manner of chivalrous persons, who knew that  the King's trumpets would presently be summoning them into less  softly furnished fields of action, from one or another of which they  would return feet foremost on a bier. So Jurgen sighed and warbled  and made eyes with many excellent fighting-men: and the Princess  listened with many other ladies whose hearts were not of flint. And  Gogyrvan meditated.    Now it was the kingly custom of Gogyrvan when his dinner was spread  at noontide, not to go to meat until all such as demanded justice  from him had been furnished with a champion to redress the wrong.  One day as the gaunt old King sat thus in his main hall, upon a seat  of green rushes covered with yellow satin, and with a cushion of  yellow satin under his elbow, and with his barons ranged about him  according to their degrees, a damsel came with a very heart-rending  tale of the oppression that was on her.    Gogyrvan blinked at her, and nodded. \"You are the handsomest woman I  have seen in a long while,\" says he, irrelevantly. \"You are a woman  I have waited for. Duke Jurgen of Logreus will undertake this  adventure.\"    There being no help for it, Jurgen rode off with this Dame Yolande,  not very well pleased: but as they rode he jested with her. And so,  with much laughter by the way, Yolande conducted him to the Green  Castle, of which she had been dispossessed by Graemagog, a most  formidable giant.    \"Now prepare to meet your death, sir knight!\" cried Graemagog,  laughing horribly, and brandishing his club; \"for all knights who  come hither I have sworn to slay.\"    \"Well, if truth-telling were a sin you would be a very virtuous  giant,\" says Jurgen, and he flourished Thragnar's sword, resistless  Caliburn.    Then they fought, and Jurgen killed Graemagog. Thus was the Green  Castle restored to Dame Yolande, and the maidens who attended her  aforetime were duly released from the cellarage. They were now  maidens by courtesy only, but so tender is the heart of women that  they all wept over Graemagog.    Yolande was very grateful, and proffered every manner of reward.    \"But, no, I will take none of these fine jewels, nor money, nor  lands either,\" says Jurgen. \"For Logreus, I must tell you, is a  fairly well-to-do duchy, and the killing of giants is by way of  being my favorite pastime. He is well paid that is well satisfied.  Yet if you must reward me for such a little service, do you swear to  do what you can to get me the love of my lady, and that will  suffice.\"    Yolande, without any particular enthusiasm, consented to attempt  this: and indeed Yolande, at Jurgen's request, made oath upon the  Four Evangelists that she would do everything within her power to  aid him.    \"Very well,\" said Jurgen, \"you have sworn, and it is you whom I  love.\"    Surprise now made her lovely. Yolande was frankly delighted at the  thought of marrying the young Duke of Logreus, and offered to send  for a priest at once.    \"My dear,\" says Jurgen, \"there is no need to bother a priest about  our private affairs.\"    She took his meaning, and sighed. \"Now I regret,\" said she, \"that I  made so solemn an oath. Your trick was unfair.\"    \"Oh, not at all,\" said Jurgen: \"and presently you will not regret  it. For indeed the game is well worth the candle.\"    \"How is that shown, Messire de Logreus?\"    \"Why, by candle-light,\" says Jurgen,--\"naturally.\"    \"In that event, we will talk no further of it until this evening.\"    So that evening Yolande sent for him. She was, as Gogyrvan had said,  a remarkably handsome woman, sleek and sumptuous and crowned with a  wealth of copper-colored hair. To-night she was at her best in a  tunic of shimmering blue, with a surcote of gold embroidery, and  with gold embroidered pendent sleeves that touched the floor. Thus  she was when Jurgen came to her.    \"Now,\" says Yolande, frowning, \"you may as well come out  straightforwardly with what you were hinting at this morning.\"    But first Jurgen looked about the apartment, and it was lighted by a  tall gilt stand whereon burned candles.    He counted these, and he whistled. \"Seven candles! upon my word,  sweetheart, you do me great honor, for this is a veritable  illumination. To think of it, now, that you should honor me, as  people do saints, with seven candles! Well, I am only mortal, but  none the less I am Jurgen, and I shall endeavor to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8789"],[0,"The vision of hell.

Thou mayst remember well:  For she good service did thee in the gloom  Of the deep wood.\"  This said, both onward mov'd.          CANTO XXI    THUS we from bridge to bridge, with other talk,  The which my drama cares not to rehearse,  Pass'd on; and to the summit reaching, stood  To view another gap, within the round  Of Malebolge, other bootless pangs.    Marvelous darkness shadow'd o'er the place.    In the Venetians' arsenal as boils  Through wintry months tenacious pitch, to smear  Their unsound vessels; for th' inclement time  Sea-faring men restrains, and in that while  His bark one builds anew, another stops  The ribs of his, that hath made many a voyage;  One hammers at the prow, one at the poop;  This shapeth oars, that other cables twirls,  The mizen one repairs and main-sail rent  So not by force of fire but art divine  Boil'd here a glutinous thick mass, that round  Lim'd all the shore beneath.  I that beheld,  But therein nought distinguish'd, save the surge,  Rais'd by the boiling, in one mighty swell  Heave, and by turns subsiding and fall.  While there  I fix'd my ken below, \"Mark! mark!\" my guide  Exclaiming, drew me towards him from the place,  Wherein I stood.  I turn'd myself as one,  Impatient to behold that which beheld  He needs must shun, whom sudden fear unmans,  That he his flight delays not for the view.  Behind me I discern'd a devil black,  That running, up advanc'd along the rock.  Ah! what fierce cruelty his look bespake!  In act how bitter did he seem, with wings  Buoyant outstretch'd and feet of nimblest tread!  His shoulder proudly eminent and sharp  Was with a sinner charg'd; by either haunch  He held him, the foot's sinew griping fast.    \"Ye of our bridge!\" he cried, \"keen-talon'd fiends!  Lo! one of Santa Zita's elders!  Him  Whelm ye beneath, while I return for more.  That land hath store of such.  All men are there,  Except Bonturo, barterers: of 'no'  For lucre there an 'aye' is quickly made.\"    Him dashing down, o'er the rough rock he turn'd,  Nor ever after thief a mastiff loos'd  Sped with like eager haste.  That other sank  And forthwith writhing to the surface rose.  But those dark demons, shrouded by the bridge,  Cried \"Here the hallow'd visage saves not: here  Is other swimming than in Serchio's wave.  Wherefore if thou desire we rend thee not,  Take heed thou mount not o'er the pitch.\"  This said,  They grappled him with more than hundred hooks,  And shouted: \"Cover'd thou must sport thee here;  So, if thou canst, in secret mayst thou filch.\"    E'en thus the cook bestirs him, with his grooms,  To thrust the flesh into the caldron down  With flesh-hooks, that it float not on the top.    Me then my guide bespake: \"Lest they descry,  That thou art here, behind a craggy rock  Bend low and screen thee; and whate'er of force  Be offer'd me, or insult, fear thou not:  For I am well advis'd, who have been erst  In the like fray.\"  Beyond the bridge's head  Therewith he pass'd, and reaching the sixth pier,  Behov'd him then a forehead terror-proof.    With storm and fury, as when dogs rush forth  Upon the poor man's back, who suddenly  From whence he standeth makes his suit; so rush'd  Those from beneath the arch, and against him  Their weapons all they pointed.  He aloud:  \"Be none of you outrageous: ere your time  Dare seize me, come forth from amongst you one,    \"Who having heard my words, decide he then  If he shall tear these limbs.\"  They shouted loud,  \"Go, Malacoda!\"  Whereat one advanc'd,  The others standing firm, and as he came,  \"What may this turn avail him?\" he exclaim'd.    \"Believ'st thou, Malacoda!  I had come  Thus far from all your skirmishing secure,\"  My teacher answered, \"without will divine  And destiny propitious?  Pass we then  For so Heaven's pleasure is, that I should lead  Another through this savage wilderness.\"    Forthwith so fell his pride, that he let drop  The instrument of torture at his feet,  And to the rest exclaim'd: \"We have no power  To strike him.\"  Then to me my guide: \"O thou!  Who on the bridge among the crags dost sit  Low crouching, safely now to me return.\"    I rose, and towards him moved with speed: the fiends  Meantime all forward drew: me terror seiz'd  Lest they should break the compact they had made.  Thus issuing from Caprona, once I saw  Th' infantry dreading, lest his covenant  The foe should break; so close he hemm'd them round.    I to my leader's side adher'd, mine eyes  With fixt and motionless observance bent  On their unkindly visage.  They their hooks  Protruding, one the other thus bespake:  \"Wilt thou I touch him on the hip?\"  To whom  Was answer'd: \"Even so; nor miss thy aim.\"    But he, who was in conf'rence with my guide,  Turn'd rapid round, and thus the demon spake:  \"Stay, stay thee, Scarmiglione!\"  Then to us  He added: \"Further footing to your step  This rock affords not, shiver'd to the base  Of the sixth arch.  But would you still proceed,  Up by this cavern go: not distant far,  Another rock will yield you passage safe.  Yesterday, later by five hours than now,  Twelve hundred threescore years and six had fill'd  The circuit of their course, since here the way  Was broken.  Thitherward I straight dispatch  Certain of these my scouts, who shall espy  If any on the surface bask.  With them  Go ye: for ye shall find them nothing fell.  Come Alichino forth,\" with that he cried,  \"And Calcabrina, and Cagnazzo thou!  The troop of ten let Barbariccia lead.  With Libicocco Draghinazzo haste,  Fang'd Ciriatto, Grafflacane fierce,  And Farfarello, and mad Rubicant.  Search ye around the bubbling tar.  For these,  In safety lead them, where the other crag  Uninterrupted traverses the dens.\"    I then: \"O master! what a sight is there!  Ah! without escort, journey we alone,  Which, if thou know the way, I covet not.  Unless thy prudence fail thee, dost not mark  How they do gnarl upon us, and their scowl  Threatens us present tortures?\"  He replied:  \"I charge thee fear not: let them, as they will,  Gnarl on: 't is but in token of their spite  Against the souls, who mourn in torment steep'd.\"    To leftward o'er the pier they turn'd; but each  Had first between his teeth prest close the tongue,  Toward their leader for a signal looking,  Which he with sound obscene triumphant gave.          CANTO XXII    IT hath been heretofore my chance to see  Horsemen with martial order shifting camp,  To onset sallying, or in muster rang'd,  Or in retreat sometimes outstretch'd for flight;  Light-armed squadrons and fleet foragers  Scouring thy plains, Arezzo! have I seen,  And clashing tournaments, and tilting jousts,  Now with the sound of trumpets, now of bells,  Tabors, or signals made from castled heights,  And with inventions multiform, our own,  Or introduc'd from foreign land; but ne'er  To such a strange recorder I beheld,  In evolution moving, horse nor foot,  Nor ship, that tack'd by sign from land or star.    With the ten demons on our way we went;  Ah fearful company! but in the church  With saints, with gluttons at the tavern's mess.    Still earnest on the pitch I gaz'd, to mark  All things whate'er the chasm contain'd, and those  Who burn'd within.  As dolphins, that, in sign  To mariners, heave high their arched backs,  That thence forewarn'd they may advise to save  Their threaten'd vessels; so, at intervals,  To ease the pain his back some sinner show'd,  Then hid more nimbly than the lightning glance.    E'en as the frogs, that of a wat'ry moat  Stand at the brink, with the jaws only out,  Their feet and of the trunk all else concealed,  Thus on each part the sinners stood, but soon  As Barbariccia was at hand, so they  Drew back under the wave.  I saw, and yet  My heart doth stagger, one, that waited thus,  As it befalls that oft one frog remains,  While the next springs away: and Graffiacan,  Who of the fiends was nearest, grappling seiz'd  His clotted locks, and dragg'd him sprawling up,  That he appear'd to me an otter.  Each  Already by their names I knew, so well  When they were chosen, I observ'd, and mark'd  How one the other call'd. \"O Rubicant!  See that his hide thou with thy talons flay,\"  Shouted together all the cursed crew.    Then I: \"Inform thee, master! if thou may,  What wretched soul is this, on whom their hand  His foes have laid.\"  My leader to his side  Approach'd, and whence he came inquir'd, to whom  Was answer'd thus: \"Born in Navarre's domain  My mother plac'd me in a lord's retinue,  For she had borne me to a losel vile,  A spendthrift of his substance and himself.  The good king Thibault after that I serv'd,  To peculating here my thoughts were turn'd,  Whereof I give account in this dire heat.\"    Straight Ciriatto, from whose mouth a tusk  Issued on either side, as from a boar,  Ript him with one of these.  'Twixt evil claws  The mouse had fall'n: but Barbariccia cried,  Seizing him with both arms: \"Stand thou apart,  While I do fix him on my prong transpierc'd.\"  Then added, turning to my guide his face,  \"Inquire of him, if more thou wish to learn,  Ere he again be rent.\"  My leader thus:  \"Then tell us of the partners in thy guilt;  Knowest thou any sprung of Latian land  Under the tar?\"--\"I parted,\" he replied,  \"But now from one, who sojourn'd not far thence;  So were I under shelter now with him!  Nor hook nor talon then should scare me more.\"--.    \"Too long we suffer,\" Libicocco cried,  Then, darting forth a prong, seiz'd on his arm,  And mangled bore away the sinewy part.  Him Draghinazzo by his thighs beneath  Would next have caught, whence angrily their chief,  Turning on all sides round, with threat'ning brow  Restrain'd them.  When their strife a little ceas'd,  Of him, who yet was gazing on his wound,  My teacher thus without delay inquir'd:  \"Who was the spirit, from whom by evil hap  Parting, as thou has"]]]
