This separation, the first that had occurred, did  not take place until the 25th, on which day Captain Phillip went on board  the _Supply_, taking with him, from the _Sirius_, Lieutenants King and  Dawes, with the time-keeper. On the same day Major Ross, with the  adjutant and quarter-master of the detachment, went into the  _Scarborough_, in order to co-operate with Captain Phillip in his  intention of preparing, as far as time might allow, for the reception of  the rest of the convoy.    The _Supply_ and the three transports having taken their departure,  Captain Hunter drew his little convoy into the order of sailing  prescribed for them; and the boats, which had been employed passing and  repassing between the _Sirius_ and the transports, being hoisted in,  about noon the fleet made sail to the south-east, having a fresh breeze  at west-north-west.    December.] On Sunday the 16th of December, by computation, we were  abreast of the Island of St. Paul, passing it at the distance of about  sixty leagues.    The following day, on the return of a boat from the _Fishbourn_  store-ship which had been sent to inquire into the state of the stock, we  heard that several of the sheep were dead, as well as eight of the hogs  belonging to the public stock.    Christmas day found us in the latitude of 42 degrees 10 minutes south,  and steering, as we had done for a considerable time, an east-south-east  course. We complied, as far as was in our power, with the good old  English custom, and partook of a better dinner this day than usual; but  the weather was too rough to admit of much social enjoyment.    With the wind at south-west, west-south-west, and south and by west, the  weather was clear and cold, while to the northward of east or west it  generally blew in strong gales.    We now often noticed pieces of sea-weed floating by the ships; and on the  28th the sun just appeared in time to show us we were in the latitude of  42 degrees 58 minutes south.    On the 29th, being in latitude 43 degrees 35 minutes south, the course  was altered to east and by south half south, in order to run down our  easting without going any further to the southward. The run at noon on  this day was found to be the greatest we had made in any twenty-four  hours since our departure from England, having 182 miles on the log-board  since twelve o'clock the preceding day.    By lunar observations taken on the 30th the longitude was found to be 118  degrees 19 minutes east.    1788.]  January.] The new year opened with a gale of wind from the northward,  which continued with much violence all the day, moderating towards  evening.    The evening of the third proved fine and moderate, and the sun setting  clear gave a good observation for the amplitude, when the variation was  found to be 1 degree 00 minutes east. At noon the fleet was in the  latitude of 44 degrees 00 minutes south, and longitude by lunar  observation 135 degrees 32 minutes east, of which the convoy was  informed.    At noon on the 4th preparations were made on board the _Sirius_ for  falling in with the land; her cables were bent, signal-guns prepared, and  every possible precautions taken to ensure the safety of the fleet.    About ten at night on the 5th, a very beautiful aurora australis was  observed bearing about south-west of the fleet; and for some nights a  luminous phenomenon had been seen resembling lights floating on the  surface of the water.    By a lunar observation taken at ten o'clock of the forenoon of Monday the  7th, the fleet was then distant seventeen leagues from the South Cape of  New Holland; and at five minutes past two in the afternoon the signal was  made for seeing the land. The rocks named the Mewstone and Swilly were  soon visible, and the fleet stood along shore with fair moderate weather  and smooth water, the land of New Holland distant from three to five  miles.    Nothing could more strongly prove the excellence and utility of lunar  observations, than the accuracy with which we made the land in this long  voyage from the Cape of Good Hope, there not being a league difference  between our expectation of seeing it, and the real appearance of it.    A thick haze hanging over the land, few observations could be made of it.  What we first saw was the South-west Cape of New Holland, between which  and the South Cape the land appeared high and rocky, rising gradually  from the shore, and wearing in many places a very barren aspect. In small  cavities, on the summit of some of the high land, was the appearance of  snow. Over the South Cape the land seemed covered with wood; the trees  stood thick, and the bark of them appeared in general to have a whitish  cast. The coast seemed very irregular, projecting into low points forming  creeks and bays, some of which seemed to be deep; very little verdure was  any where discernible; in many spots the ground looked arid and sterile.  At night we perceived several fires lighted on the coast, at many of  which, no doubt, were some of the native inhabitants, to whom it was  probable our novel appearance must have afforded matter of curiosity and  wonder.    In all the preceding passage we had been scarcely a day without seeing  birds of different kinds; and we also met with many whales. The weather  was in general very rough, and the sea high, but the wind favourable,  blowing mostly from north-west to south-west.    The convoy behaved well, paying more attention and obedience to signals  than ships in the merchant service are commonly known to do. The ships,  however, began to grow foul, not one of them being coppered, and we now  anxiously wished for a termination of the voyage, particularly as the hay  provided for the horses was on the point of being wholly expended.    The fair wind which had accompanied us to New Holland suddenly left us,  shifting round to north-east and by east; we were obliged to lay our  heads off-shore, in order to weather Swilly and the Eddystone (a  perpendicular rock about a league to the eastward of Swilly) and the next  day we had the mortification of a foul wind, a thing to which we had been  long unaccustomed.    In the night of the 9th the _Golden Grove_ shipped a sea, which stove in  all her cabin windows: it was nearly calm at the time, with a confused  heavy swell*.    [* This circumstance has since occurred to other ships nearly in the same  situation.]    At two o'clock in the afternoon of the following day a very heavy and  sudden squall took the _Sirius_ and laid her considerably down on her  starboard side: it blew very fresh, and was felt more or less by all the  transports, some of which suffered in their sails.    Our progress along the coast to the northward was very slow, and it was  not until the 19th that we fell in with the land, when we were nearly  abreast of the Point named by Captain Cook Red Point. Before evening,  however, we were gratified with the sight of the entrance into Botany  Bay, but too late to attempt standing into it with the transports that  night. The convoy therefore was informed by Captain Hunter how the  entrance of the bay bore, and directed to be very attentive in the  morning when the _Sirius _made sail or bore up.    When the morning came we found the fleet had been carried by a current to  the southward as far as a clump of trees which had the preceding day  obtained, from some resemblance in the appearance, the name of Post-down  Clump; but with the assistance of a fine breeze we soon regained what we  had lost in the night; and at ten minutes before eight in the morning the  _Sirius_ came to an anchor in Botany Bay. The transports were all safe in  by nine o'clock.

Thus, under the blessing of God, was happily completed, in eight months  and one week, a voyage which, before it was undertaken, the mind hardly  dared venture to contemplate, and on which it was impossible to reflect  without some apprehensions as to its termination. This fortunate  completion of it, however, afforded even to ourselves as much matter of  surprise as of general satisfaction; for in the above space of time we  had sailed five thousand and twenty-one leagues; had touched at the  American and African Continents; and had at last rested within a few days  sail of the antipodes of our native country, without meeting any accident  in a fleet of eleven sail, nine of which were merchantmen that had never  before sailed in that distant and imperfectly explored ocean: and when it  is considered, that there was on board a large body of convicts, many of  whom were embarked in a very sickly state, we might be deemed peculiarly  fortunate, that of the whole number of all descriptions of persons coming  to form the new settlement, only thirty-two had died since their leaving  England, among whom were to be included one or two deaths by accidents;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12573"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 08 (#14)"],[1,"was true of her, what  Marianne had observed when she went to sleep for the first time in the  old woman's house; she was waking and sleeping, laughing and weeping,  almost all at the same time. Every occurrence and every emotion affected  her very strongly, but she soon got over it and recovered her balance.    She continued to weep.    \"You make one's heart so heavy,\" said Damie complainingly.    [Illustration: TEARS FELL UPON THE PATERNAL COAT]    \"It's hard enough to have to go away from one's home and live among  strangers. You ought rather to cheer me up, than to be so--so--.\"    \"Right thinking is the best cheer,\" replied Amrei. \"It does not weigh  upon the heart at all. But you are right--you have enough to bear; a  single pound added to the load might crush you. I am foolish after all.  But come--let us see now what the sun has to say, when father walks out  in its light once more. No, I didn't mean to say that. Come, you  yourself surely know where we must go, and what you must take leave of;  for even if you are going only a couple of miles away, still you are  going away from the village, and you must bid it good-by. It's hard  enough for me that I am not to have you with me any longer--no, I mean  that I am not to be with you any longer, for I don't want to rule over  you, as people say I do. Yes, yes,--old Marianne was right; _alone_ is a  great word; one can't possibly learn all that it means. As long as you  were living on the other side of the street, even if I did not see you  for a week at a time, it did not matter; for I could have you at any  moment, and that was as good as living together. But now--well, it's not  out of the world, after all. But remember, don't try to lift too much,  or hurt yourself in your work. And when any of your things are torn,  send them to me--I'll mend them for you, and continue to knit for you.  And now, come, let us go to the churchyard.\"    Damie objected to this plan, making the plea that he felt the parting  heavy enough, and did not want to make it any heavier. His sister gave  in. He took off his father's clothes again, and Barefoot packed them in  the sack she had once worn as a cloak in the days when she kept the  geese. This sack still bore her father's name upon it, and she charged  Damie specially to send her back the sack at the first opportunity.    The brother and sister went out together. A cart belonging to Hirlingen  was passing through the village; Damie hailed it, and quickly loaded his  possessions on it. Then he walked with his sister, hand in hand, out of  the village, and Barefoot sought to cheer him up by saying:    \"Do you remember the riddle I asked you there by the oven?\"    \"No.\"    \"Think: What is best about the oven?\"    \"No.\"      \"Of the oven this is best, 'tis said,    That it never itself doth eat the bread.\"    \"Yes, you can be cheerful--you're going to stay home.\"    \"But it was your own wish to go away. And you can be cheerful, too, if  you only try hard enough.\"    In silence she walked on with her brother to the Holderwasen. There,  under the wild pear-tree, she said:    \"Here we will say good-by. God bless you, and don't be afraid of  anything!\"    They shook hands warmly, and then Damie walked on toward Hirlingen, and  Barefoot turned back toward the village. Not until she got to the foot  of the hill, where Damie could not see her, did she venture to lift up  her apron and wipe away the tears that were running down her cheeks.    [Amrei and Damie were separated for three years. During this time the  girl made herself more and more liked and respected by everybody, not  only on account of her pleasant ways and general helpfulness, but also  on account of her self-sacrificing devotion to her unappreciative  brother. While her going barefoot and having been a goose-girl caused  her to be the victim of more or less raillery, still nobody meant it at  all seriously unless it was Rose, Farmer Rodel's youngest daughter, who  was jealous of Amrei's popularity. One day when Amrei was standing by  her window, she heard the fire-bell ringing.]    \"There's a fire at Scheckennarre's, at Hirlingen!\" was the cry outside.  The engine was brought out, and Barefoot climbed upon it and rode away  with the firemen.    \"My Damie! My Damie!\" she kept repeating to herself in great alarm. But  it was day-time, and in the day-time people could not be burned to  death in a fire. And sure enough, when they arrived at Hirlingen, the  house was already in ashes. Beside the road, in an orchard, stood Damie  in the act of tying two piebalds,--fine, handsome horses,--to a tree;  and oxen, bulls, and cows were all running about in confusion.    They stopped the engine to let Barefoot get off, and with a cry of \"God  be praised that nothing has happened to you!\" she hurried toward her  brother. Damie, however, made no reply, and stood with both hands  resting on the neck of one of the horses.    \"What is it? Why don't you speak? Have you hurt yourself?\"    \"I have not hurt myself, but the fire has hurt me.\"    \"What's the matter?\"    \"All I have is lost--all my clothes and my little bit of money! I've  nothing now but what's on my back.\"    \"And are father's clothes burnt too?\"    \"Are they fireproof?\" replied Damie, angrily. \"Don't ask such stupid  questions!\"    Barefoot was ready to cry at this ungracious reception by her brother;  but she quickly remembered, as if by intuition, that misfortune in its  first shock often makes people harsh, unkind, and quarrelsome. So she  merely said:    \"Thank God that you have escaped with your life! Father's clothes--to be  sure, in those there's something lost that cannot be replaced--but  sooner or later they would have been worn out anyway.\"    \"All your chattering will do no good,\" said Damie, still stroking the  horse. \"Here I stand like a miserable outcast. If the horses here could  talk, they'd tell a different story. But I am born to misfortune--whatever  I do that's good, is of no use. And yet--\" He could say no more; his voice  faltered.    \"What has happened?\"    \"There are the horses, and the cows, and the oxen--not one of them was  burned. Look, that horse over there tore my shirt when I was dragging  him out of the stable. This nigh horse here did me no harm--he knows me.  Eh, Humple, you know me, don't you? We know each other, don't we?\" The  horse laid his head across the neck of the other and stared at Damie,  who went on:    \"And when I joyfully went to tell the farmer that I had saved all his  cattle, he said: 'You needn't have done it--they were all well insured,  and I would have been paid good money for them.' 'Yes,' thinks I to  myself, 'but to have let the poor beasts die, is that nothing? If a  thing's paid for, is that all?' The farmer must have read in my face  what I was thinking of, for he says to me: 'Of course, you saved your  clothes and your property?' And then I says: 'No, not a stitch. I ran  out to the stable directly.' And then he says: 'You're a noodle!'  'What?' says I, 'You're insured?--Well then, if the cattle would have  been paid for, my clothes shall be paid for--and some of my dead  father's clothes were among them, and fourteen guilders, and my watch,  and my pipe.' And says he: 'Go smoke it! My property is insured, but not  my servant's property.' And I says: 'We'll see about that--I'll take it  to court!' Whereupon he says: 'Now you may go at once. Threatening a  lawsuit is the same as giving notice. I would have given you a few  guilders, but now you shan't have a farthing. And now, hurry up--away  with you!' And so here I am. And I think I ought to take my nigh horse  with me, for I saved his life, and he would be glad to go with me,  wouldn't you? But I have never learned to steal, and I shouldn't know  what to do now. The best thing for me to do is to jump into the water.  For I shall never amount to anything as long as I live, and I have  nothing now.\"    \"But I still have something, and I will help you out.\"    \"No, I won't do that any longer--always depending upon you. You have a  hard enough time earning what you have.\"    Barefoot tried to comfort her brother, and succeeded so far that he  consented to go home with her. But they had scarcely gone a hundred  paces, when they heard something trotting along behind them. It was the  horse; he had broken loose and had followed Damie, who was obliged to  drive back the creature he was so fond of by flinging stones at it.    Damie was ashamed of his misfortune, and would hardly show his face to  any one; for it is a peculiarity of weak natures that they feel their  strength, not in their own self-respect, but always wish to show how  much they can really do by some visible achievement. Misfortune they  regard as evidence of their own weakness, and if they cannot hide it,  they hide themselves.    Damie would go no farther than the first houses in the village. Black  Marianne gave him a coat that had belonged to her slain husband; Damie  felt a terrible repugnance at putting it on, and Amrei, who had before  spoken of her father's coat as something sacred, now found just as many  arguments to prove that there was nothing in a coat after all, and that  it did not matter in the least who had once worn it.    Coaly Mathew, who lived not far from Black Marianne, took Damie as his  assistant at tree-felling and charcoal-burning. This solitary life  pleased Damie best; for he only wanted to wait until the time came when  he could be a soldier, and then he would enter the army as a substitute  and remain a soldier all his life. For in a soldier's life there is  justice and order, and no one has brothers and sisters, and no one has  his own house, and a man is provided with clothing and meat and drink;  and if there should be a war, why a brave soldier's death is after all  the best.    Such were the sentiments that Damie expressed one Sunday in Mossbrook  Wood, when Barefoot came out to the charcoal-burner's to bring "]]]
