By the minute, which was made  on this occasion, I apprehend that no one, belonging to the Society, could  furnish even materials for such voyages. \"We renew our exhortation, that  Friends every where be especially careful to keep their hands clear of  giving encouragement in any shape to the Slave-trade, it being evidently  destructive of the natural rights of mankind, who are all ransomed by one  Saviour, and visited by one divine light, in order to salvation; a traffic  calculated to enrich and aggrandize some upon the misery of others, in its  nature abhorrent to every just and tender sentiment, and contrary to the  whole tenour of the Gospel.\"    Some pleasing intelligence having been sent on this subject by the Society  in America to the Society in England, the yearly meeting of 1772 thought it  their duty to notice it, and to keep their former resolutions alive by the  following minute:--\"It appears that the practice of holding Negros in  oppressive and unnatural bondage hath been so successfully discouraged by  Friends in some of the colonies as to be considerably lessened. We cannot  but approve of these salutary endeavours, and earnestly entreat they may be  continued, that, through the favour of divine Providence, a traffic so  unmerciful and unjust in its nature to a part of our own species, made,  equally with ourselves, for immortality, may come to be considered by all  in its proper light, and be utterly abolished as a reproach to the  Christian name.\"    I must beg leave to stop here for a moment, just to pay the Quakers a due  tribute of respect for the proper estimation, in which they have uniformly  held the miserable outcasts of society, who have been the subject of these  minutes. What a contrast does it afford to the sentiments of many others  concerning them! How have we been compelled to prove by a long chain of  evidence, that they had the same feelings and capacities as ourselves! How  many, professing themselves enlightened, even now view them as of a  different species! But in the minutes, which have been cited, we have seen  them uniformly represented as persons \"ransomed by one and the same  Saviour\"--\"as visited by one and the same light for salvation\"--and \"as  made equally for immortality as others.\" These practical views of mankind,  as they are highly honourable to the members of this society, so they  afford a proof both of the reality and of the consistency of their  religion.    But to return:--From this time there appears to have been a growing desire  in this benevolent society to step out of its ordinary course in behalf of  this injured people. It had hitherto confined itself to the keeping of its  own members unpolluted by any gain from their oppression. But it was now  ready to make an appeal to others, and to bear a more public testimony in  their favour. Accordingly, in the month of June 1783, when a bill had been  brought into the House of Commons for certain regulations to be made with  respect to the African trade, the Society sent the following petition to  that branch of the legislature:--    \"Your petitioners, met in this their annual assembly, having solemnly  considered the state of the enslaved Negros, conceive themselves engaged,  in religious duty, to lay the suffering situation of that unhappy people  before you, as a subject loudly calling for the humane interposition of the  legislature.    \"Your petitioners regret that a nation, professing the Christian faith,  should so far counteract the principles of humanity and justice, as by the  cruel treatment of this oppressed race to fill their minds with prejudices  against the mild and beneficent doctrines of the Gospel.    \"Under the countenance of the laws of this country many thousands of these  our fellow-creatures, entitled to the natural rights of mankind, are held  as personal property in cruel bondage; and your petitioners being informed  that a Bill for the Regulation of the African Trade is now before the  House, containing a clause which restrains the officers of the African  Company from exporting Negros, your petitioners, deeply affected with a  consideration of the rapine, oppression, and bloodshed, attending this  traffic, humbly request that this restriction may be extended to all  persons whomsoever, or that the House would grant such other relief in the  premises as in its wisdom may seem meet.\"    This petition was presented by Sir Cecil Wray, who, on introducing it,  spoke very respectfully of the Society. He declared his hearty approbation  of their application, and said he hoped he should see the day when not a  slave would remain within the dominions of this realm. Lord North seconded  the motion, saying he could have no objection to the petition, and that its  object ought to recommend it to every humane breast; that it did credit to  the most benevolent society in the world; but that, the session being so  far advanced, the subject could not then be taken into consideration; and  he regretted that the Slave-trade, against which the petition was so justly  directed, was in a commercial view become necessary to almost every nation  of Europe. The petition was then brought up and read, after which it was  ordered to lie on the table. This was the first petition (being two years  earlier than that from the inhabitants of Bridgewater), which was ever  presented to parliament for the abolition of the Slave-trade.    But the Society did not stop here; for having at the yearly meeting of 1783  particularly recommended the cause to a standing commitee appointed to act  at intervals, called the Meeting for Sufferings, the latter in this same  year resolved upon an address to the public, entitled, The Case of our  Fellow-creatures, the oppressed Africans, respectfully recommended to the  serious Consideration of the Legislature of Great Britain, by the People  called Quakers: in which they endeavoured in the most pathetic manner to  make the reader acquainted with the cruel nature of this trade; and they  ordered two thousand copies of it to be printed.    In the year 1784 they began the distribution of this case. The first copy  was sent to the King through Lord Carmarthen, and the second and the third,  through proper officers, to the Queen and the Prince of Wales. Others were  sent by a deputation of two members of the society to Mr. Pitt, as  prime-minister; to the Lord Chancellor Thurlow; to Lord Gower, as president  of the council; to Lords Carmarthen and Sidney, as secretaries of state; to  Lord Chief Justice Mansfield; to Lord Howe, as first lord of the Admiralty;  and to C.F. Cornwall, Esq. as speaker of the House of Commons. Copies were  sent also to every member of both Houses of Parliament.    The Society, in the same year, anxious, that the conduct of its members  should be consistent with its public profession on this great subject,  recommended it to the quarterly and monthly meetings to inquire through  their respective districts, whether any, bearing its name, were in any way  concerned in the traffic, and to deal with such, and to report the success  of their labours in the ensuing year. Orders were also given for the  reprinting and circulation of ten thousand other copies of 'The Case.'    In the year 1785, the Society interested itself again in a similar manner.  For the meeting for sufferings, as representing it, recommended to the  quarterly meetings to distribute a work, written by Anthony Benezet, in  America, called, A Caution to Great Britain and her Colonies, in a short  Representation of the calamitous State of the enslaved Negros in the  British Dominions. This book was accordingly forwarded to them for this  purpose. On receiving it, they sent it among several public bodies, the  regular and dissenting clergy, justices of the peace, and particularly  among the great schools of the kingdom, that the rising youth might acquire  a knowledge, and at the same time a detestation, of this cruel traffic. In  this latter case, a deputation of the Society waited upon the masters, to  know if they would allow their scholars to receive it. The schools of  Westminster, the Charter-house, St. Paul, Merchant-Taylors, Eton,  Winchester, and Harrow were among those visited. Several academies also  were visited for this purpose.    But I must now take my leave of the Quakers as a public body[A], and go  back to the year 1783, to record an event, which will be found of great  importance in the present history, and in which only individuals belonging  to the Society were concerned. This event seems to have arisen naturally  out of existing or past circumstances. For the Society, as I have before  stated, had sent a petition to Parliament in this year, praying for the  abolition of the Slave-trade. It had also laid the foundation for a public  distribution of the books as just mentioned, with a view of enlightening  others on this great subject. The case of the ship Zong, which I have  before had occasion to explain, had occurred this same year. A letter also  had been presented, much about the same time, by Benjamin West, from  Anthony Benezet before mentioned, to our Queen, in behalf of the injured  Africans, which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12434"],[0,"Twelve Studies on the Making of a Nation: The Beginnings of Israel's History (#14)"],[1,"as portrayed by the prophetic account practically  perfect?  Of the three characters, Abraham, Jacob and Joseph, which  offers more practical suggestions to the man of to-day?  Which has  exerted the most powerful influence upon the ideals and conduct of  the human race?      V.    THE STANDARDS OF REAL SUCCESS.    It is natural and inevitable that the various social classes of  each succeeding generation should define their standards of success  concretely, that is, by the lives and achievements of those who  have done great things.  In certain social groups the world's  champion prize fighter is the beau ideal of success.  Among the  Camorrists of Italy that ideal is the successful blackmailer.  In  many sections of our great cities the powerful ward boss, whatever  be his methods, is regarded as the embodiment of success.  Too  often in America to-day, both in the public press and in the public  mind, the multi-millionaire is regarded as the pre-eminently  successful man.  Although the power to amass wealth is evidence of  marked ability, the homage paid to it is one of the most sinister  tendencies in American life.  Ordinarily it means that the  ambitions and achievements of a Jacob, rather than those of a  Joseph, are set before the youth as the supreme goal for which to  strive.  A most hopeful element in the present situation is that  many of the world's wealthiest men are proclaiming their sense of  responsibility to society in ways both practical and impressive.  Far more significant than their actual gifts is this public  declaration that each man is indeed his brother's keeper, and that  no man has a right to use his wealth simply for his own pleasure.    Leonidas and his fearless patriotic followers at Thermopylae left  an impress upon Greek life and character that did not fade for  centuries.  The spirit of Robert Bruce still lingers among the  crags and heather-clad hills of Scotland.  The patriotic devotion  of Garibaldi has imparted a new character to the Italian race.  Two  hundred million of the world's inhabitants still bear the imprint  of the fiery faith and fanaticism of Mahomet.    America is rich in its memories of the achievements of such as  Washington, Lincoln, Morse, Beecher and Emerson.  What characters  in all history seem to you the best examples of real success?  What  men and women in the present generation?  How can the great  majority of the boys and girls and the men and women of to-day be  led to accept those higher ideals of success which are the  lodestones drawing on the race to higher achievement?      VI.    THE METHODS OF SUCCESS.    The story is told of the late President Garfield that in the heat  of a political campaign one of his lieutenants suggested that he  adopt an exceedingly questionable policy.  When Mr. Garfield  objected, his lieutenant replied, \"No one will know it.\"  \"But I  shall know,\" was the quick reply.      --\"To thine own self be true,    And it must follow, as the night the day,    Thou canst not then be false to any man.\"      --_Hamlet, Act I, Sc. 3_.    Wealth and power are worthy goals for which to strive.  One of the  first duties of a political party is to capture the offices, for  without them in its power it cannot carry out the principles for  which it stands.  The possession of wealth represents vast  possibilities for service.  Thousands of tragic experiments have  demonstrated, however, the fallacy of the seductive doctrine that  the end justifies the means.  The tragedy that overshadows many of  the seemingly most successful men of to-day is the memory of the  iniquitous methods whereby they have acquired wealth or mounted to  power.  Lavish philanthropy and the beneficent use of power can  never wholly blot out from the public mind or from the mind of the  successful man the memory of certain questionable acts that at the  time seemed essential to the realization of a great policy.    A keen, well-informed student of modern economic conditions has  asserted that no man can succeed in business life today and remain  true to the teachings of Jesus.  Is this true?  Is it true in  professional life?  Is it true in politics?  One of our most  prominent statesmen has said that he would have found it impossible  to succeed and maintain his independence if he had been compelled  to earn his living.  He would have been compelled either to yield  to the boss or quit politics.  Who are some of the men in public  life who are gaining success and yet maintaining Christian  principles?  If the ultimate ideal of real success is service, is  there any other way in which men may obtain success?  Is this true  of every department of human effort?  Does this principle make it  possible for every man, however limited his ability and  opportunities, to attain real success?      _Questions for Further Consideration_.    How would you define genius?  Edison called it 2% of inspiration  and 98% of perspiration.  (But see James, _Talks to Teachers_.)    Is the chief difference between the successful and the unsuccessful  man the ability to recognize and seize opportunities?    Would Joseph's policy in dealing with Pharaoh's subjects meet with  public approval to-day?    Could Joseph have succeeded as well in a republic?    Does Joseph's land policy justify the single tax?  Or serfdom such  as Joseph countenanced?    What place does loyalty to humble friends and kinsmen take in the  making of great and noble characters?    Would you say that the ultimate standard of all real success is  service?    Would it be wise for the state to enforce service for the public  good by a heavy, progressive inheritance tax?    What justification is there for such a modification of Joseph's  land policy, as the single tax? (See George, _Progress and  Poverty_; Seligman, _Essays on Taxation_, 64-94.)    Do you think that a man earning his own living can expect to-day to  succeed in politics and maintain his self-respect as an independent  thinker?      _Subjects for Further Study_.

And he went out on the following day and saw two men of the Hebrews  striving together; and he said to the one who was doing the wrong,  Why do you smite your fellow-workman?  But he replied, Who made you  a prince and a judge over us?  Do you intend to kill me as you  killed the Egyptian?  Then Moses was afraid and said, Surely the  thing is known.  When, therefore, Pharaoh heard this thing, he  sought to him Moses.  But Moses fled from the presence of Pharaoh  and took up his abode in the land of Midian.    And Jehovah said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people  that are in Egypt, and have heard their cry of anguish, because of  their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows; and I am come down to  deliver them out of the power of the Egyptians, and to bring them  up out of that land to a land, beautiful and broad, to a land  flowing with milk and honey; Go and gather the elders of Israel  together and say to them, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God  of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, hath appeared to me, saying, I have  surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt,  and I have said I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt  to a land flowing with milk and honey.  And they shall hearken to  thy voice; and thou shalt come, together with the elders of Israel,  to the king of Egypt, and ye shall say to him, \"Jehovah, the God of  the Hebrews, hath appeared to us; and now let us go, we pray thee,  three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to  Jehovah our God.\"--_Hist. Bible_.    Hold on; hold fast: hold out--patience is genius.    Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith let us  dare to do our duty as we understand it.--_Lincoln_.      I.    THE EGYPTIAN BACKGROUND OF THE BONDAGE.    The one contemporary reference to Israel thus far found in the  Egyptian inscriptions comes from the reign of Merneptah the son of  Ramses II.  It implies that at the time at least part of the  Hebrews were in the land of Palestine:      Plundered is Canaan with every evil;    Askalon is carried into captivity,    Gezer is taken;    Yenoam is annihilated,    Israel is desolated, her seed is not,    Palestine has become a widow for Egypt.    All lands are united, they are pacified.    Every one who is turbulent has been found by King Merneptah.    The testimony of the oldest Biblical narratives regarding the  sojourn of the Hebrews in Egypt is, also, in perfect accord with  the picture which the contemporary Egyptian inscriptions give of  the period.  Furthermore, the Egyptian historians never  distinguished the different races in their midst, but rather  designated the foreign serf class by a common name.  The absence of  detailed reference to the Hebrews is therefore perfectly natural.  It seems probable that not all but only part of the tribes which  ultimately coalesced into the Hebrew nation found their way to  Egypt.  The stories regarding Joseph, the traditional father of  Ephraim and Manasseh, imply that these strong central tribes,  possibly together with the southern tribes of Benjamin and Judah,  were the chief actors in this opening scene in Israel's history.    The Biblical narratives apparently disagree regarding the duration  of the sojourn in Egypt.  The reference in Gen. 15:16, which, some  writers think, comes from the northern Israelite group of"]]]
