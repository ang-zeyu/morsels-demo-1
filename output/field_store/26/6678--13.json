[* Probably a _Gaultkeria_.--Ed.]    The ground in many places was covered with a thick carpet of  strawberries of many varieties, which afford a constant dessert during  the season to those who choose to pick them, a privilege of which I am  sure I should gladly avail myself were I near them in the summer. Beside  the plants I have myself observed in blossom, I am told the spring and  summer produce many others;--the orange lily; the phlox, or purple  _lichnidea_; the mocassin flower, or ladies' slipper; lilies of the  valley in abundance; and, towards the banks of the creek and the  Otanabee, the splendid cardinal flower (_lobelia cardinalis_) waves its  scarlet spikes of blossoms.    I am half inclined to be angry when I admire the beauty of the Canadian  flowers, to be constantly reminded that they are scentless, and  therefore scarcely worthy of attention; as if the eye could not be  charmed by beauty of form and harmony of colours, independent of the  sense of smelling being gratified.    To redeem this country from the censure cast on it by a very clever  gentleman I once met in London, who said, \"the flowers were without  perfume, and the birds without song,\" I have already discovered several  highly aromatic plants and flowers. The milkweed must not be omitted  among these; a beautiful shrubby plant with purple flowers, which are  alike remarkable for beauty of colour and richness of scent.    I shall very soon begin to collect a hortus siccus for Eliza, with a  description of the plants, growth, and qualities. Any striking  particulars respecting them I shall make notes of; and tell her she may  depend on my sending my specimens, with seeds of such as I can collect,  at some fitting opportunity.    I consider this country opens a wide and fruitful field to the inquiries  of the botanist. I now deeply regret I did not benefit by the frequent  offers Eliza made me of prosecuting a study which I once thought dry,  but now regard as highly interesting, and the fertile source of mental  enjoyment, especially to those who, living in the bush, must necessarily  be shut out from the pleasures of a large circle of friends, and the  varieties that a town or village offer.    On Sunday I went to church; the first opportunity I had had of attending  public worship since I was in the Highlands of Scotland; and surely I  had reason to bow my knees in thankfulness to that merciful God who had  brought us through the perils of the great deep and the horrors of the  pestilence.    Never did our beautiful Liturgy seem so touching and impressive as it  did that day,--offered up in our lowly log-built church in the  wilderness.    This simple edifice is situated at the foot of a gentle slope on the  plains, surrounded by groups of oak and feathery pines, which, though  inferior in point of size to the huge pines and oaks of the forest, are  far more agreeable to the eye, branching out in a variety of fantastic  forms. The turf here is of an emerald greenness: in short, it is a sweet  spot, retired from the noise and bustle of the town, a fitting place in  which to worship God in spirit and in truth.    There are many beautiful walks towards the Smith town hills, and along  the banks that overlook the river. The summit of this ridge is sterile,  and is thickly set with loose blocks of red and grey granite,  interspersed with large masses of limestone scattered in every  direction; they are mostly smooth and rounded, as if by the action of  water. As they are detached, and merely occupy the surface of the  ground, it seemed strange to me how they came at that elevation. A  geologist would doubtless be able to solve the mystery in a few minutes.  The oaks that grow on this high bank are rather larger and more  flourishing than those in the valleys and more fertile portions of the  soil.    Behind the town, in the direction of the Cavan and Emily roads, is a  wide space which I call the \"squatter's ground,\" it being entirely  covered with shanties, in which the poor emigrants, commuted pensioners,  and the like, have located themselves and families. Some remain here  under the ostensible reason of providing a shelter for their wives and  children till they have prepared a home for their reception on their  respective grants; but not unfrequently it happens that they are too  indolent, or really unable to work on their lots, often situated many  miles in the backwoods, and in distant and unsettled townships,  presenting great obstacles to the poor emigrant, which it requires more  energy and courage to encounter than is possessed by a vast number of  them. Others, of idle and profligate habits, spend the money they  received, and sell the land, for which they gave away their pensions,  after which they remain miserable squatters on the shanty ground.    The shanty is a sort of primitive hut in Canadian architecture, and is  nothing more than a shed built of logs, the chinks between the round  edges of the timbers being filled with mud, moss, and bits of wood; the  roof is frequently composed of logs split and hollowed with the axe, and  placed side by side, so that the edges rest on each other; the concave  and convex surfaces being alternately uppermost, every other log forms a  channel to carry off the rain and melting snow. The eaves of this  building resemble the scolloped edges of a clam shell; but rude as this  covering is, it effectually answers the purpose of keeping the interior  dry; far more so than the roofs formed of bark or boards, through which  the rain will find entrance. Sometimes the shanty has a window,  sometimes only an open doorway, which admits the light and lets out the  smoke*. A rude chimney, which is often nothing better than an opening  cut in one of the top logs above the hearth, a few boards fastened in a  square form, serves as the vent for the smoke; the only precaution  against the fire catching the log walls behind the hearth being a few  large stones placed in a half circular form, or more commonly a bank of  dry earth raised against the wall.    [* I was greatly amused by the remark made by a little Irish boy, that  we hired to be our hewer of wood and drawer of water, who had been an  inhabitant of one of these shanties. \"Ma'am\" said he, \"when the weather  was stinging cold, we did not know how to keep ourselves warm; for while  we roasted our eyes out before the fire our backs were just freezing; so  first we turned one side and then the other, just as you would roast a  _guse_ on a spit. Mother spent half the money father earned at his straw  work (he was a straw chair maker,) in whiskey to keep us warm; but I do  think a larger mess of good hot _praters_ (potatoes,) would have kept us  warmer than the whiskey did.\"]    Nothing can be more comfortless than some of these shanties, reeking  with smoke and dirt, the common receptacle for children, pigs, and  fowls. But I have given you the dark side of the picture; I am happy to  say all the shanties on the squatters' ground were not like these: on  the contrary, by far the larger proportion were inhabited by tidy folks,  and had one, or even two small windows, and a clay chimney regularly  built up through the roof; some were even roughly floored, and possessed  similar comforts with the small log-houses.    [Illustration: Log house]    You will, perhaps, think it strange when I assure you that many  respectable settlers, with their wives and families, persons delicately  nurtured, and accustomed to every comfort before they came hither, have  been contented to inhabit a hut of this kind during the first or second  year of their settlement in the woods.    I have listened with feelings of great interest to the history of the  hardships endured by some of the first settlers in the neighbourhood,  when Peterborough contained but two dwelling houses. Then there were  neither roads cut nor boats built for communicating with the distant and  settled parts of the district; consequently the difficulties of  procuring supplies of provisions was very great, beyond what any one  that has lately come hither can form any notion of.    When I heard of a whole family having had no better supply of flour than  what could be daily ground by a small hand-mill, and for weeks being  destitute of every necessary, not even excepting bread, I could not help  expressing some surprise, never having met with any account in the works  I had read concerning emigration that at all prepared one for such  evils.    \"These particular trials,\" observed my intelligent friend, \"are confined  principally to the first breakers of the soil in the unsettled parts of  the country, as was our case. If you diligently question some of the  families of the lower class that are located far from the towns, and who  had little or no means to support them during the first twelve months,  till they could take a crop off the land, you will hear many sad tales  of distress.\"    Writers on emigration do not take the trouble of searching out these  things, nor does it answer their purpose to state disagreeable facts.  Few have written exclusively on the \"Bush.\" Travellers generally make a  hasty journey through the long settled and prosperous portions of the  country; they see a tract of fertile, well-cultivated land, the result  of many years of labour; they see comfortable dwellings, abounding with  all the substantial necessaries of life; the farmer's wife makes her own  soap, candles, and sugar; the family are clothed in cloth of their own  spinning, and hose of their own knitting. The bread, the beer, butter,  cheese, meat, poultry, &c. are all the produce of the farm. He  concludes, therefore, that Canada is a land of Canaan, and writes a book  setting forth these"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13575"],[0,"How to Observe in Archaeology (#14)"],[1,"Period (circa 1800-1400 B.C.).  During this period imports from Egypt, Crete, the Aegean Sea, and  especially Cyprus were common, and potsherds originating in those  countries are frequently to be picked up: also local imitations of  these foreign wares. The ware of this period is on the whole well-  refined and well-modelled: the most graceful shapes, in jugs and  bowls, belong to it. Elaborate polychrome decoration, including  figures of birds. But little moulded ornament.    Third Semitic Period (circa 1400-1000 B.C.).  The same foreign influences are traceable, but rather as reminiscent  local imitations than as direct imports. Late Minoan [Mycenaean]  sherds are, however, frequent. The shapes of vessels are less  artistic than in the preceding period: the painted ornament is also  degenerated, being traced in wiry lines rather than in the bold wash  of the preceding period.    Fourth Semitic Period (circa 1000-550 B.C.).  Late Cypriote imports. The local ware very poor, coarse, gritty,  inartistic. No painted ornament except mere lines: clumsy moulded  ornament frequent.    Post-Exilic and Hellenistic Period (circa 550-100 B.C.).  Imports from Greece (sometimes fragments of black or red figured  vases, or lekythoi) and from the Aegean Islands (especially wine-jars  from Rhodes: stamped handles of such are frequent). The native ware  is easily recognizable by its smoothness and hardness; when struck  with a stick a sherd emits a musical clink. The vessels are very fair  imitations of classical models, occasionally with painted ornament,  but more frequently moulded.    Roman and Byzantine Period (circa 100 B.C.-A.D. 600).  The unmistakable character of the ware of this period is the ribbed  surface, with which nearly all vessels are decorated. Fragments of  ribbed pottery are strewn almost over all Palestine. Ornament  consisting of repeated impressions of stamps now begins to appear.  Lamps with decoration, inscriptions, Christian or Jewish symbols  common. Glass vessels also frequent.    Arab Period (circa A.D. 600 onwards).  The early Arab ware often bears painted decoration singularly like  that on Second and Third Semitic pottery, but a fatty soapy texture  characterizes the Arab ware, which is absent from the earlier sherds.  There is likewise a complete absence of representation of natural  forms (birds and the like). In or about the Crusader period the use  of ornamental glaze makes its appearance.      [Illustration XII: PALESTINIAN POTTERY TYPES]      VI. Sanctuaries.    The hill-top shrines, now consecrated to saints of Islam, are  doubtless in origin ancient Canaanite high places. There is here a  rich but a very difficult field for investigation. The difficulty  lies in (a) gaining the confidence of those to whom the sanctuaries  are holy, and (b) guarding against wilful or unconscious deception.  Only long residence and frequent intercourse, with the Muslim  population will make it possible for any one to obtain really  trustworthy information as to the traditions or the sites of these  ancient sanctuaries. A knowledge of Arabic is essential for a study  of the sites themselves, as there are frequently inscriptions cut or  painted on the walls which should be studied. The casual traveller  cannot hope to carry out researches of any value on these ancient  sites.    Sometimes the buildings are Crusaders' churches transformed. The one  really certain fact as to masonry dressing in Palestine may here  conveniently be noticed--that Crusader structures are built of well-  squared stones with a plane surface finished off with a dressing  consisting of very fine diagonal lines. Once seen, this masonry  dressing is absolutely unmistakable.    Buildings thus identified as Crusader should be examined for masons'  marks.      VII. Miscellaneous.     The following are some other types of ancient remains with which the  traveller may meet almost anywhere in Palestine:    (1) Prehistoric (Stone Age) sites. Marked by being strewn with flint  implements and chips: see a fine collection in the Museum of the  Assumptionists (Notre-Dame de France) at Jerusalem. Specimens should  be collected and the site mapped.    (2) Dolmens. Frequent east of Jordan; rare, though not unknown, in  Western Palestine. Should be measured, photographed, described, and  mapped.    (3) Rock-cuttings of various kinds, which should be measured,  planned, and mapped. Among these the commonest are:   (a) Cisterns (usually bottle-shaped, a narrow neck expanding below).   (b) Cup-markings, common everywhere. Often associated with cisterns.   (c) Wine and olive presses: there is a great variety in form, but  they generally consist of two essential parts--a shallow _pressing-  vat_ on which the fruit was crushed, and a deeper _receiving-vat_ in  which the expressed juice was collected. The vats are often lined  with cement containing datable potsherds, and are sometimes paved  with mosaic tesserae.   (d) Quarries.    (4) Sacred trees and bushes, recognized by the rags with which they  are festooned. Should be photographed and mapped, and their legends  ascertained, subject to the cautions given above under the head of  Sanctuaries.    (5) Castles and churches, usually of the Crusader period: early  Saracenic buildings. Should be recorded by means of plans,  photographs, measured drawings, and written descriptions.    (6) Mosaic pavements, usually belonging to Byzantine buildings;  should be recorded by means of coloured drawings.
