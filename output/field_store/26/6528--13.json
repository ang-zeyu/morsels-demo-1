It is stated to consist of some soft wood which has  been subject to heavy pressure. It is stated that some English engravers  have given their opinion on this prepared wood as follows:    It has not the power of resistance of boxwood, so that it would be  imposible to make use of it, except in the shape of an electro obtained  from it, as it is too soft to sustain the pressure of a machine, and  would be easily worn out. In reply to these opinions, Mr. Badoureau  wrote: \"My wood resists the wear and tear of the press as well as  boxwood, and I can show engravings of English and French artists which  have been obtained direct from the wood, and are as perfect as they are  possible to be; several of them have been drawn by Mr. Gustave Dore.\"    Mr. Badoureau further says that \"while as an engraver he has so high an  opinion of the qualities of compressed wood as a substitute for boxwood,  as the inventor of the new process he considered that it possesses  numerous advantages both for artistic and industrial purposes.\" In  short, he says, \"My wood is to other wood what steel is to iron.\"    The following woods are those which have, from time to time, been  proposed or experimented upon as substitutes for boxwood, for engraving  purposes. They are arranged according to their scientific classification  in the natural orders to which they belong:      _Natural Order Pittosporeae_.    1. _Pittosporum undulatum_. Vent.--A tree growing in favorable  situations to a height of forty or even sixty feet, and is a native of  New South Wales and Victoria. It furnishes a light, even grained wood,  which attracted some attention at the International Exhibition in 1862;  blocks were prepared from it, and submitted to Prof. De la Motte, of  King's College, who reported as follows:    \"I consider this wood well adapted to certain kinds of wood engraving.  It is not equal to Turkey box, but it is superior to that generally used  for posters, and I have no doubt that it would answer for the rollers  of mangles and wringing machines.\" Mr. W.G. Smith, in a report in the  _Gardeners' Chronicle_ for July 26, 1873, p. 1017, on some foreign woods  which I submitted to him for trial, says that the wood of _Pittosporum  undulatum_ is suitable only for bold outlines; compared with box, it is  soft and tough, and requires more force to cut than box. The toughness  of the wood causes the tools to drag back, so that great care is  required in cutting to prevent the lines clipping. The average diameter  of the wood is from 18 to 30 inches.    2. _Pittosporum bicolor_, Hook.--A closely allied species, sometimes  forty feet high, native of New South Wales and Tasmania. This wood is  stated to be decidedly superior to the last named.    3. _Bursaria spinosa_, Cav.--A tree about forty feet high, native of  North, South, and West Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria,  and Tasmania, in which island it is known as boxwood. It has been  reported upon as being equal to common or inferior box, and with  further trials might be found suitable for common subjects; it has the  disadvantage, however, of blunting the edges and points of the tools.      _Natural Order Meliaceae_.    4. _Swietenia mahagoni_, L. (mahogany).--A large timber tree of  Honduras, Cuba, Central America, and Mexico. It is one of the most  valuable of furniture woods, but for engraving purposes it is but of  little value, nevertheless it has been used for large, coarse subjects.  Spanish mahogany is the kind which has been so used.      _Natural Order Ilicineae_.    _Ilex opaca_, L. (North American holly).--It is a widely diffused tree,  the wood of which is said to closely resemble English holly, being white  in color, and hard, with a fine grain, so that it is used for a  great number of purposes by turners, engineers, cabinet makers, and  philosophical instrument makers. For engraving purposes it is not equal  to the dog-wood of America (_Cornus florida_); it yields, however, more  readily to the graver's tools.      _Natural Order Celastrineae_.    6. _Elaeodendron australe_, Vent.--A tree twenty to twenty-five feet  high, native of Queensland and New South Wales. The wood is used in the  colony for turning and cabinet work, and Mr. W.G. Smith reports that for  engraving purposes it seems suitable only for rough work, as diagrams,  posters, etc.    7. _Euonymus sieboldianus_, Blume.--A Chinese tree, where the wood,  which is known as pai'cha, is used for carving and engraving. Attention  was first drawn to this wood by Mr. Jean von Volxem, in the _Gardeners'  Chronicle_ for April 20, 1878. In the Kew Report for 1878, p. 41, the  following extract of a letter from Mr. W.M. Cooper, Her Majesty's Consul  at Ningpo, is given: \"The wood in universal use for book blocks, wood  engravings, seals, etc., is that of the pear tree, of which large  quantities are grown in Shantung, and Shan-se, especially. Pai'cha is  sometimes used as an indifferent substitute. Pai'cha is a very fine  white wood of fine fiber, without apparent grains, and cuts easily; is  well suited for carved frames, cabinets, caskets, etc., for which large  quantities are manufactured here for export. The tree itself resembles  somewhat the _Stillingia_, but has a rougher bark, larger and thinner  leaves, which are serrated at the edge, more delicate twigs, and is  deciduous.\" In 1879, a block of this wood was received at the Kew  Museum, from Mr. Cooper, a specimen of which was submitted to Mr. Robson  J. Scott, of Whitefriars Street, to whom I am much indebted for reports  on various occasions, and upon this wood Mr. Scott reported as follows:  \"The most striking quality I have observed in this wood is its capacity  for retaining water, and the facility with which it surrenders it. This  section (one prepared and sent to the Kew Museum), which represents  one-tenth of the original piece, weighed 3 lb. 41/2 ounces. At the end of  twenty one days it had lost 1 lb. 63/4 ounces in an unheated chamber. At  the end of another fourteen days, in a much elevated temperature, it  only lost 1/4 ounce. In its present state of reduced bulk its weight is 1  lb. 10 ounces. It is not at all likely to supersede box, but it may be  fit for coarser work than that for which box is necessary.\" Later on,  namely in the Kew Report for 1880, p. 51, Mr. R.D. Keene, an engraver,  to whom Mr. Scott submitted specimens of the wood for trial, writes: \"I  like the wood very much, and prefer it to box in some instances; it is  freer to work, and consequently quicker, and its being uniform in color  and quality is a great advantage; we often have great difficulty in  box in having to work from a hard piece into a soft. I think it a very  useful wood, especially for solid bold work. I question if you could get  so extreme a fine black line as on box, but am sure there would be a  large demand for it at a moderate price.\" Referring to this letter, Mr.  Scott remarks that the writer does not intend it to be understood that  pai'cha is qualified to supersede box, but for inferior subjects for  which coarse brittle box is used. Mr. Scott further says that of the  woods he has tried he prefers pear and hawthorn to pai'cha.      _Natural Order Sapindaceae_.    8. _Acer saccharinum_, L. (sugar or bird's eye maple).--A North American  tree, forming extensive forests in Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova  Scotia. The wood is well known as a cabinet or furniture wood. It has  been tried for engraving, but it does not seem to have attracted much  notice. Mr. Scott says it is sufficiently good, so far as the grain is  concerned. From this it would seem not to promise favorably.      _Natural Order Leguminoseae. Sub-order Papilionaceae_.    9. _Brya ebenus_, [Delta]. DC.--A small tree of Jamaica, where the wood  is known as green ebony, and is used for making various small articles.  It is imported into this country under the name of cocus wood, and  is used with us for making flutes and other wind instruments. Mr.  Worthington Smith considers that the wood equals bad box for engraving  purposes.      _Natural Order Rosaceae_.    10. _Pyrus communis_, L. (common pear).--A tree averaging from 20 to 40  feet high. Found in a wild state, and very extensively cultivated as a  fruit tree. The wood is of a light brown color, and somewhat resembles  limewood in grain. It is, however, harder and tougher. It is considered  a good wood for carving, because it can be cut with or across the grain  with equal facility. It stands well when well seasoned, and is used for  engraved blocks for calico printers, paper stainers, and for various  other purposes. Pear-wood has been tried for engraving purposes, but  with no great success. Mr. Scott's opinion of its relative value is  referred to under pai'cha wood _(Euonymus sieboldianus)_.    11. _Amelanchier canadensis_. L. (shade tree or service tree of  America).--A shrub or small tree found throughout Canada, Newfoundland,  and Virginia. Of this wood, Porcher says, in his \"Resources of the  Southern Fields and Forests\": \"Upon examining with a sharp instrument  the specimens of various southern woods deposited in the museum of the  Elliott Society, ... I was struck with the singular weight, density, and  fineness of this wood. I think I can confidently recommend it as one of  the best to be experimented upon by the wood engraver.\"    12. _Cratoegus oxyacantha_, L. (hawthorn).--A well-known shrub or small  tree in forests and hedges in this country. The wood is very dense and  close grained. Of this wood, Mr. Scott reports that it is by far the  best wood after box that he has had the opportunity of testing.      _Natural Order Myrtaceae_.    13. _Eugenia procera_, Poir.--A tree 20 to 30 feet high, native of  Jamaica, Antigua, Martinique, and Santa Cruz. A badly seasoned sample  of this wood was submitted to Mr. R.H. Keene, who reported that \"it is  suited for bold, solid newspaper work.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/97"],[0,"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (#13)"],[1," fool, I say; three-to-the-third  can have no meaning in Geometry.\" At once there came a distinctly  audible reply, \"The boy is not a fool; and three-to-the-third has an  obvious Geometrical meaning.\"    My Wife as well as myself heard the words, although she did not  understand their meaning, and both of us sprang forward in the  direction of the sound.  What was our horror when we saw before us a  Figure!  At the first glance it appeared to be a Woman, seen sideways;  but a moment's observation shewed me that the extremities passed into  dimness too rapidly to represent one of the Female Sex; and I should  have thought it a Circle, only that it seemed to change its size in a  manner impossible for a Circle or for any regular Figure of which I had  had experience.    But my Wife had not my experience, nor the coolness necessary to note  these characteristics.  With the usual hastiness and unreasoning  jealousy of her Sex, she flew at once to the conclusion that a Woman  had entered the house through some small aperture.  \"How comes this  person here?\" she exclaimed, \"you promised me, my dear, that there  should be no ventilators in our new house.\"  \"Nor are they any,\" said  I; \"but what makes you think that the stranger is a Woman?  I see by my  power of Sight Recognition--\"    \"Oh, I have no patience with your Sight Recognition,\" replied she,  \"'Feeling is believing' and 'A Straight Line to the touch is worth a  Circle to the sight'\"--two Proverbs, very common with the Frailer Sex  in Flatland.    \"Well,\" said I, for I was afraid of irritating her, \"if it must be so,  demand an introduction.\"  Assuming her most gracious manner, my Wife  advanced towards the Stranger, \"Permit me, Madam to feel and be felt  by--\" then, suddenly recoiling, \"Oh! it is not a Woman, and there are  no angles either, not a trace of one.  Can it be that I have so  misbehaved to a perfect Circle?\"    \"I am indeed, in a certain sense a Circle,\" replied the Voice, \"and a  more perfect Circle than any in Flatland; but to speak more accurately,  I am many Circles in one.\"  Then he added more mildly, \"I have a  message, dear Madam, to your husband, which I must not deliver in your  presence; and, if you would suffer us to retire for a few minutes--\"  But my wife would not listen to the proposal that our august Visitor  should so incommode himself, and assuring the Circle that the hour of  her own retirement had long passed, with many reiterated apologies for  her recent indiscretion, she at last retreated to her apartment.    I glanced at the half-hour glass.  The last sands had fallen.  The  third Millennium had begun.      Footnote 3.  When I say \"sitting,\" of course I do not mean any change  of attitude such as you in Spaceland signify by that word; for as we  have no feet, we can no more \"sit\" nor \"stand\" (in your sense of the  word) than one of your soles or flounders.    Nevertheless, we perfectly well recognize the different mental states  of volition implied by \"lying,\" \"sitting,\" and \"standing,\" which are to  some extent indicated to a beholder by a slight increase of lustre  corresponding to the increase of volition.    But on this, and a thousand other kindred subjects, time forbids me to  dwell.          SECTION 16  How the Stranger vainly endeavoured to reveal to me               in words the mysteries of Spaceland      As soon as the sound of the Peace-cry of my departing Wife had died  away, I began to approach the Stranger with the intention of taking a  nearer view and of bidding him be seated:  but his appearance struck me  dumb and motionless with astonishment.  Without the slightest symptoms  of angularity he nevertheless varied every instant with graduations of  size and brightness scarcely possible for any Figure within the scope  of my experience.  The thought flashed across me that I might have  before me a burglar or cut-throat, some monstrous Irregular Isosceles,  who, by feigning the voice of a Circle, had obtained admission somehow  into the house, and was now preparing to stab me with his acute angle.    In a sitting-room, the absence of Fog (and the season happened to be  remarkably dry), made it difficult for me to trust to Sight  Recognition, especially at the short distance at which I was standing.  Desperate with fear, I rushed forward with an unceremonious, \"You must  permit me, Sir--\" and felt him.  My Wife was right.  There was not the  trace of an angle, not the slightest roughness or inequality: never in  my life had I met with a more perfect Circle.  He remained motionless  while I walked around him, beginning from his eye and returning to it  again.  Circular he was throughout, a perfectly satisfactory Circle;  there could not be a doubt of it.  Then followed a dialogue, which I  will endeavour to set down as near as I can recollect it, omitting only  some of my profuse apologies--for I was covered with shame and  humiliation that I, a Square, should have been guilty of the  impertinence of feeling a Circle.  It was commenced by the Stranger  with some impatience at the lengthiness of my introductory process.    Stranger.  Have you felt me enough by this time?  Are you not  introduced to me yet?    I.  Most illustrious Sir, excuse my awkwardness, which arises not from  ignorance of the usages of polite society, but from a little surprise  and nervousness, consequent on this somewhat unexpected visit.  And I  beseech you to reveal my indiscretion to no one, and especially not to  my Wife.  But before your Lordship enters into further communications,  would he deign to satisfy the curiosity of one who would gladly know  whence his visitor came?    Stranger.  From Space, from Space, Sir:  whence else?    I.  Pardon me, my Lord, but is not your Lordship already in Space, your  Lordship and his humble servant, even at this moment?    Stranger.  Pooh! what do you know of Space?  Define Space.    I.  Space, my Lord, is height and breadth indefinitely prolonged.    Stranger.  Exactly:  you see you do not even know what Space is.  You  think it is of Two Dimensions only; but I have come to announce to you  a Third--height, breadth, and length.    I.  Your Lordship is pleased to be merry.  We also speak of length and  height, or breadth and thickness, thus denoting Two Dimensions by four  names.    Stranger.  But I mean not only three names, but Three Dimensions.    I.  Would your Lordship indicate or explain to me in what direction is  the Third Dimension, unknown to me?    Stranger.  I came from it.  It is up above and down below.    I.  My Lord means seemingly that it is Northward and Southward.    Stranger.  I mean nothing of the kind.  I mean a direction in which you  cannot look, because you have no eye in your side.    I.  Pardon me, my Lord, a moment's inspection will convince your  Lordship that I have a perfectly luminary at the juncture of my two  sides.    Stranger:  Yes:  but in order to see into Space you ought to have an  eye, not on your Perimeter, but on your side, that is, on what you  would probably call your inside; but we in Spaceland should call it  your side.    I.  An eye in my inside!  An eye in my stomach!  Your Lordship jests.    Stranger.  I am in no jesting humour.  I tell you that I come from  Space, or, since you will not understand what Space means, from the  Land of Three Dimensions whence I but lately looked down upon your  Plane which you call Space forsooth.  From that position of advantage I  discerned all that you speak of as SOLID (by which you mean \"enclosed  on four sides\"), your houses, your churches, your very chests and  safes, yes even your insides and stomachs, all lying open and exposed  to my view.    I.  Such assertions are easily made, my Lord.    Stranger.  But not easily proved, you mean.  But I mean to prove mine.    When I descended here, I saw your four Sons, the Pentagons, each in his  apartment, and your two Grandsons the Hexagons; I saw your youngest  Hexagon remain a while with you and then retire to his room, leaving  you and your Wife alone.  I saw your Isosceles servants, three in  number, in the kitchen at supper, and the little Page in the scullery.  Then I came here, and how do you think I came?    I.  Through the roof, I suppose.    Strange.  Not so.  Your roof, as you know very well, has been recently  repaired, and has no aperture by which even a Woman could penetrate.  I  tell you I come from Space.  Are you not convinced by what I have told  you of your children and household?    I.  Your Lordship must be aware that such facts touching the belongings  of his humble servant might be easily ascertained by any one of the  neighbourhood possessing your Lordship's ample means of information.    Stranger.  (TO HIMSELF.)  What must I do?  Stay; one more argument  suggests itself to me.  When you see a Straight Line-- your wife, for  example--how many Dimensions do you attribute to her?    I.  Your Lordship would treat me as if I were one of the vulgar who,  being ignorant of Mathematics, suppose that a Woman is really a  Straight Line, and only of One Dimension.  No, no, my Lord; we Squares  are better advised, and are as well aware of your Lordship that a  Woman, though popularly called a Straight Line, is, really and  scientifically, a very thin Parallelogram, possessing Two Dimensions,  like the rest of us, viz., length and breadth (or thickness).    Stranger.  But the very fact that a Line is visible implies that it  possesses yet another Dimension.    I.  My Lord, I have just acknowledged that a Woman is broad as well as  long.  We see her length, we infer her breadth; which, though very  slight, is capable of measurement.    Stranger.  You do not understand me.  I mean that when you see a Woman,  you ought--besides inferring her breadth--to see her length, and to SEE  what we call her HEIGHT; although the last Dimension is infinitesimal  in your country.  If a Line were mere length without \"height,\" it would  cease to occupy Space and"]]]
