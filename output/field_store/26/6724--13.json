They were lionised. Mrs.  Spratt's deep-rooted dislike to the female dress of the present day did  not last much longer than her life-long prejudice against the  aristocracy; she discarded the mediaeval garments she had hitherto worn  with such disdain for the eccentricities of modern fashion, and put  herself into the hands of the best dressmaker in town. And thus  snubbing, and being snubbed, dressing and dancing and feasting and  flirting, did she soar higher and higher in her butterfly career. The  denouement comes when they are cut out by \"Ye rising Minnows\"--an  American sculptor--one Pygmalion F. Minnow--whose wife was twice as  beautiful as Mrs. Spratt.    Another shorter prose skit of du Maurier's which is included in the same  book satirises the splendid sort of hero, who conceals beneath a mask of  indifference the power to do anything on earth better than anybody else.    These prose skits show the neat irony that _Punch_ was willing to  encourage by attaching du Maurier to the literary, as well as to the  artistic, staff. But we think it may be said that du Maurier hadn't the  heart to go on with a class of writing in which his great tendency to  sentimentalise would have been out of place.      Section 7    In 1890 du Maurier contributed two papers to the _Art Journal_ entitled  \"The Illustrating of Books from the Serious Artist's Point of View.\" It  was an attempt to write down the ideas that had controlled him in book  illustration. The artist begins the article by protesting that of all  subjects in the world it is the one upon which he has the least and  fewest ideas, and that such ideas as he has consist principally of his  admiration for illustrations by others. He separates readers into two  classes--those who visualise what they read with the mind's eye so  satisfactorily that they want the help of no pictures, and those--the  greater number, he thinks--who do not possess this gift, to whom to have  the author's conceptions embodied for them in a concrete form is a boon.  The little figures in the picture are a mild substitute for the actors  at the footlights. The arrested gesture, the expression of face, the  character and costume, may be as true to nature and life as the best  actor can make them. His test of a good illustrator is that the  illustrations continue to haunt the memory when the letterpress is  forgotten. He cites Menzel as the highest example of such performance.  He next refers to the illustrated volume of Poems by Tennyson in 1860,  for which Millais and Rossetti and others designed small woodcuts, the  publishing of which, he says, made an epoch in English book  illustration, importing a new element to which he finds it difficult to  give a name. \"I still adore,\" he says, \"the lovely, wild, irresponsible  moon-face of Oriana, with a gigantic mailed archer kneeling at her feet  in the yew-wood, and stringing his fatal bow; the strange beautiful  figure of the Lady of Shalott, when the curse comes over her, and her  splendid hair is floating wide, like the magic web; the warm embrace of  Amy and her cousin (when their spirits rushed together at the touching  of the lips), and the dear little symmetrical wavelets beyond; the queen  sucking the poison out of her husband's arm; the exquisite bride at the  end of the Talking Oak; the sweet little picture of Emma Morland and  Edward Grey, so natural and so modern, with the trousers treated in  quite the proper spirit; the chaste Sir Galahad, slaking his thirst with  holy water, amid all the mystic surroundings; and the delightfully  incomprehensible pictures to the Palace of Art, that gave one a weird  sense of comfort, like the word 'Mesopotamia,' without one's knowing  why.\"    [Illustration: Illustration for \"The Adventures of Harry Richmond\"    _The Cornhill_, 1871.]    In the second paper he makes interesting reflections on Thackeray and  Dickens. \"When the honour devolved upon me of illustrating _Esmond_,\" he  writes, \"what would I not have given to possess sketches, however  slight, of Thackeray's own from which to inspire myself--since he was no  longer alive to consult. For although he does not, any more than  Dickens, very minutely describe the outer aspect of his people, he  visualised them very accurately, as these sketches prove.\"    \"I doubt if Dickens did, especially his women--his pretty women--Mrs.  Dombey, Florence, Dora, Agnes, Ruth Pinch, Kate Nickleby, little  Emily--we know them all through Hablot Browne alone--and none of them  present any very marked physical characteristics. They are sweet and  graceful, neither tall nor short; they have a pretty droop in their  shoulders, and are very ladylike; sometimes they wear ringlets,  sometimes not, and each would do very easily for the other.\"    In 1868 Messrs. Harper published in book form under the title _Social  Pictorial Satire_ a series of articles which du Maurier had written in  _Harper's Magazine_, and which had originally formed the substance of  lectures which he had delivered in the prominent towns of England. He  speaks first of his great admiration of Leech in his youth. \"To be an  apparently hopeless invalid at Christmas-time in some dreary, deserted,  dismal little Flemish town, and to receive _Punch's Almanac_ (for 1858,  let us say) from some good-natured friend in England--that is a thing  not to be forgotten! I little dreamed that I should come to London  again, and meet John Leech and become his friend; that I should be,  alas! the last man to shake hands with him before his death (as I  believe I was), and find myself among the officially invited mourners by  his grave; and, finally, that I should inherit, and fill for so many  years (however indifferently), that half-page in _Punch_ opposite the  political cartoon, and which I had loved so well when he was the  artist!\" Du Maurier draws a pleasant portrait of his friend,  sympathetically, and very picturesquely analyses his art, which has, he  says, the quality of inevitableness. Of \"Words set to Pictures\" his long  description of Leech's pretty woman is as good as anything that can be  read of the kind. Then he sketches the characteristics of Charles  Keene's personality and passes on to his art:--\"From the pencil of this  most lovable man, with his unrivalled power of expressing all he saw and  thought, I cannot recall many lovable characters of either sex or of any  age.\"    But the tribute to the craftsmanship, the skill, the ease and beauty of  Keene's line, to his knowledge of effect, to the very great artist is  unmeasured. In fulfilment of his contract du Maurier speaks of himself  and his \"little bit of paper, a steel pen, and a bottle of ink--and,  alas! fingers and an eye less skilled than they would have been if I had  gone straight to a school of art instead of a laboratory for chemistry!\"  He says very little about himself. He concludes with a review of social  pictorial satire considered as a fine art. It is evident from the  lecture that du Maurier was an illustrator by instinct as well as  training. \"Now conceive,\" says he, speaking of Thackeray, \"that the  marvellous gift of expression that he was to possess in words had been  changed by some fairy at his birth into an equal gift of expression by  means of the pencil, and that he had cultivated the gift as assiduously  as he cultivated the other, and, finally, that he had exercised it as  seriously through life, bestowing on innumerable little pictures in  black and white all the art and wisdom, the wide culture, the deep  knowledge of the world and of the human heart, all the satire, the  tenderness, the drollery, and last, but not least, that incomparable  perfection of style that we find in all or most that he has  written--what a pictorial record that would be!\"    \"The career of the future social pictorial satirist is,\" he continues,  \"full of splendid possibilities undreamed of yet.... The number of  youths who can draw beautifully is quite appalling. All we want for my  little dream to be realised is that, among these precocious wielders of  the pencil, there should arise here a Dickens, there a Thackeray, there  a George Eliot or an Anthony Trollope....\"    Does not this precisely sum the situation up? Du Maurier could not live  to foresee that, for all the expert skill of modern illustration, the  \"youths who can draw beautifully\" lack \"a point of view.\" It was the  possession of this that distinguished Thackeray, George Eliot, Trollope,  Leech, and du Maurier.

IV    LIFE OF THE ARTIST    Section 1      To write of the work of an artist who is not a contemporary without  reference to the circumstances of his life would be an incomplete  performance, and yet criticism and biography are hardly ever happily  fused. The gifts of a biographer are of a kind very dissimilar to those  employed in criticism. The true biographer loves uncritically every  detail that has to do with his subject, as a portrait-painter loves  every detail that has to do with the appearance of his sitter. The best  portraits, whether in biography--which is nothing if it is not  portraiture--or in painting, are those in which the interpreter has been  in a wholly receptive mood.

The staircase which led up to the terraced roof led also to  the top of the hill. The front, which stood completely out, seemed in  nowise extraordinary. It was approached by two pylons, two courts, and a  shallow portico supported on square pillars. The unusual part of the  building only began beyond this point. First, there were two hypostyle  halls instead of one. These are separated by a wall with seven doorways.  There is no nave, and the sanctuary opens direct from the second hall.  This, as usual, consists of an oblong chamber with a door at each end; but  the rooms by which it is usually surrounded are here placed side by side in  a line, two to the right and four to the left; further, they are covered by  \"corbelled\" vaults, and are lighted only from the doors. Behind the  sanctuary are further novelties. Another hypostyle hall (K) abuts on the  end wall, and its dependencies are unequally distributed to right and left.  As if this were not enough, the architect also constructed, to the left of  the main building, a court, five chambers of columns, various passages and  dark chambers--in short, an entire wing branching off at right angles to  the axis of the temple proper, with no counterbalancing structures on the  other side. These irregularities become intelligible when the site is  examined. The cliff is shallow at this part, and the smaller hypostyle hall  is backed by only a thin partition of rock. If the usual plan had been  followed, it would have been necessary to cut the cliff entirely away, and  the structure would have forfeited its special characteristic--that of a  temple backed by a cliff--as desired by the founder. The architect,  therefore, distributed in width those portions of the edifice which he  could not carry out in length; and he even threw out a wing. Some years  later, when Rameses II. constructed a monument to his own memory, about a  hundred yards to the northward of the older building, he was careful not to  follow in his father's footsteps. Built on the top of an elevation, his  temple had sufficient space for development, and the conventional plan was  followed in all its strictness.    [Illustration: Fig. 94.--Crio-sphinx from Wady Es Sabuah.]    [Illustration: Fig. 95.--Couchant ram, with statuette of royal founder,  restored from the Avenue of Sphinxes at Karnak.]    Most temples, even the smallest, should be surrounded by a square  enclosure or temenos.[20] At Medinet Habu, this enclosure wall is of  sandstone--low, and embattled. The innovation is due to a whim of Rameses  III., who, in giving to his monument the outward appearance of a fortress,  sought to commemorate his Syrian victories. Elsewhere, the doorways are of  stone, and the walls are built in irregular courses of crude bricks. The  great enclosure wall was not, as frequently stated, intended to isolate the  temple and screen the priestly ceremonies from eyes profane. It marked the  limits of the divine dwelling, and served, when needful, to resist the  attacks of enemies whose cupidity might be excited by the accumulated  riches of the sanctuary. As at Karnak, avenues of sphinxes and series of  pylons led up to the various gates, and formed triumphal approaches. The  rest of the ground was in part occupied by stables, cellarage, granaries,  and private houses. Just as in Europe during the Middle Ages the population  crowded most densely round about the churches and abbeys, so in Egypt they  swarmed around the temples, profiting by that security which the terror of  his name and the solidity of his ramparts ensured to the local deity. A  clear space was at first reserved round the pylons and the walls; but in  course of time the houses encroached upon this ground, and were even built  up against the boundary wall. Destroyed and rebuilt century after century  upon the self-same spot, the _debris_ of these surrounding dwellings so  raised the level of the soil, that the temples ended for the most part by  being gradually buried in a hollow formed by the artificial elevation of  the surrounding city. Herodotus noticed this at Bubastis, and on  examination it is seen to have been the same in many other localities. At  Ombos, at Edfu, at Denderah, the whole city nestled inside the precincts of  the divine dwelling. At El Kab, where the temple temenos formed a separate  enclosure within the boundary of the city walls, it served as a sort of  donjon, or keep, in which the garrison could seek a last refuge. At Memphis  and at Thebes, there were as many keeps as there were great temples, and  these sacred fortresses, each at first standing alone in the midst of  houses, were, from the time of the Eighteenth Dynasty, connected each with  each by avenues of sphinxes. These were commonly andro-sphinxes, combining  the head of a man and the body of a lion; but we also find crio-sphinxes,  which united a ram's head with a lion's body (fig. 94). Elsewhere, in  places where the local worship admitted of such substitution, a couchant  ram, holding a statuette of the royal founder between his bent forelegs,  takes the place of the conventional sphinx (fig. 95). The avenue leading  from Luxor to Karnak was composed of these diverse elements. It was one  mile and a quarter in length, and there were many bends in it; but this  fact affords no fresh proof of Egyptian \"symmetrophobia.\" The enclosures of  the two temples were not oriented alike, and the avenues which started  squarely from the fronts of each could never have met had they not deviated  from their first course. Finally, it may be said that the inhabitants of  Thebes saw about as much of their temples as we see at the present day. The  sanctuary and its immediate surroundings were closed against them; but they  had access to the facades, the courts, and even the hypostyle halls, and  might admire the masterpieces of their architects as freely as we admire  them now.      [14] _Hor-shesu_, \"followers,\" or \"servants of Horus,\" are mentioned      in the Turin papyrus as the predecessors of Mena, and are referred to      in monumental inscriptions as representing the pre-historic people of      Egypt.

But this is a unique example. The  fragments of architraves and masonry bearing the name of Khafra, which were  used for building material in the northern pyramid of Lisht, show that this  primitive simplicity had already been abandoned by the time of the Fourth  Dynasty. During the Theban period, all smooth surfaces, all pylons, wall-  faces, and shafts of columns, were covered with figure-groups and  inscriptions. Under the Ptolemies and the Caesars, figures and hieroglyphs  became so crowded that the stone on which they are sculptured seems to be  lost under the masses of ornament with which it is charged. We recognise at  a glance that these scenes are not placed at random. They follow in  sequence, are interlinked, and form as it were a great mystic book in which  the official relations between gods and men, as well as between men and  gods, are clearly set forth for such as are skilled to read them. The  temple was built in the likeness of the world, as the world was known to  the Egyptians. The earth, as they believed, was a flat and shallow plane,  longer than its width. The sky, according to some, extended overhead like  an immense iron ceiling, and according to others, like a huge shallow  vault. As it could not remain suspended in space without some support, they  imagined it to be held in place by four immense props or pillars. The floor  of the temple naturally represented the earth. The columns, and if needful  the four corners of the chambers, stood for the pillars. The roof, vaulted  at Abydos, flat elsewhere, corresponded exactly with the Egyptian idea of  the sky. Each of these parts was, therefore, decorated in consonance with  its meaning. Those next to the ground were clothed with vegetation. The  bases of the columns were surrounded by leaves, and the lower parts of the  walls were adorned with long stems of lotus or papyrus (fig. 96), in the  midst of which animals were occasionally depicted.
