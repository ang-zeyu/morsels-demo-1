It was the act of a  hound and a stinker.\"    Now, though, as I have shown, I had devoted most of the time on the  journey down to meditating upon the case of Angela and Tuppy, I had not  neglected to give a thought or two to what I was going to say when I  encountered Gussie. I had foreseen that there might be some little  temporary unpleasantness when we met, and when a difficult interview is  in the offing Bertram Wooster likes to have his story ready.    So now I was able to reply with a manly, disarming frankness. The sudden  introduction of the topic had given me a bit of a jolt, it is true, for  in the stress of recent happenings I had rather let that prize-giving  business slide to the back of my mind; but I had speedily recovered and,  as I say, was able to reply with a manly d.f.    \"But, my dear chap,\" I said, \"I took it for granted that you would  understand that that was all part of my schemes.\"    He said something about my schemes which I did not catch.    \"Absolutely. 'Crawling out' is entirely the wrong way to put it. You  don't suppose I didn't want to distribute those prizes, do you? Left to  myself, there is nothing I would find a greater treat. But I saw that the  square, generous thing to do was to step aside and let you take it on, so  I did so. I felt that your need was greater than mine. You don't mean to  say you aren't looking forward to it?\"    He uttered a coarse expression which I wouldn't have thought he would  have known. It just shows that you can bury yourself in the country and  still somehow acquire a vocabulary. No doubt one picks up things from the  neighbours--the vicar, the local doctor, the man who brings the milk, and  so on.    \"But, dash it,\" I said, \"can't you see what this is going to do for you?  It will send your stock up with a jump. There you will be, up on that  platform, a romantic, impressive figure, the star of the whole  proceedings, the what-d'you-call-it of all eyes. Madeline Bassett will be  all over you. She will see you in a totally new light.\"    \"She will, will she?\"    \"Certainly she will. Augustus Fink-Nottle, the newts' friend, she knows.  She is acquainted with Augustus Fink-Nottle, the dogs' chiropodist. But  Augustus Fink-Nottle, the orator--that'll knock her sideways, or I know  nothing of the female heart. Girls go potty over a public man. If ever  anyone did anyone else a kindness, it was I when I gave this  extraordinary attractive assignment to you.\"    He seemed impressed by my eloquence. Couldn't have helped himself, of  course. The fire faded from behind his horn-rimmed spectacles, and in its  place appeared the old fish-like goggle.    '\"Myes,\" he said meditatively. \"Have you ever made a speech, Bertie?\"    \"Dozens of times. It's pie. Nothing to it. Why, I once addressed a girls'  school.\"    \"You weren't nervous?\"    \"Not a bit.\"    \"How did you go?\"    \"They hung on my lips. I held them in the hollow of my hand.\"    \"They didn't throw eggs, or anything?\"    \"Not a thing.\"    He expelled a deep breath, and for a space stood staring in silence at a  passing slug.    \"Well,\" he said, at length, \"it may be all right. Possibly I am letting  the thing prey on my mind too much. I may be wrong in supposing it the  fate that is worse than death. But I'll tell you this much: the prospect  of that prize-giving on the thirty-first of this month has been turning  my existence into a nightmare. I haven't been able to sleep or think or  eat ... By the way, that reminds me. You never explained that cipher  telegram about the sausages and ham.\"    \"It wasn't a cipher telegram. I wanted you to go light on the food, so  that she would realize you were in love.\"    He laughed hollowly.    \"I see. Well, I've been doing that, all right.\"    \"Yes, I was noticing at dinner. Splendid.\"    \"I don't see what's splendid about it. It's not going to get me anywhere.  I shall never be able to ask her to marry me. I couldn't find nerve to do  that if I lived on wafer biscuits for the rest of my life.\"    \"But, dash it, Gussie. In these romantic surroundings. I should have  thought the whispering trees alone----\"    \"I don't care what you would have thought. I can't do it.\"    \"Oh, come!\"    \"I can't. She seems so aloof, so remote.\"    \"She doesn't.\"    \"Yes, she does. Especially when you see her sideways. Have you seen her  sideways, Bertie? That cold, pure profile. It just takes all the heart  out of one.\"    \"It doesn't.\"    \"I tell you it does. I catch sight of it, and the words freeze on my  lips.\"    He spoke with a sort of dull despair, and so manifest was his lack of  ginger and the spirit that wins to success that for an instant, I  confess, I felt a bit stymied. It seemed hopeless to go on trying to  steam up such a human jellyfish. Then I saw the way. With that  extraordinary quickness of mine, I realized exactly what must be done if  this Fink-Nottle was to be enabled to push his nose past the judges' box.    \"She must be softened up,\" I said.    \"Be what?\"    \"Softened up. Sweetened. Worked on. Preliminary spadework must be put in.  Here, Gussie, is the procedure I propose to adopt: I shall now return to  the house and lug this Bassett out for a stroll. I shall talk to her of  hearts that yearn, intimating that there is one actually on the premises.  I shall pitch it strong, sparing no effort. You, meanwhile, will lurk on  the outskirts, and in about a quarter of an hour you will come along and  carry on from there. By that time, her emotions having been stirred, you  ought to be able to do the rest on your head. It will be like leaping on  to a moving bus.\"    I remember when I was a kid at school having to learn a poem of sorts  about a fellow named Pig-something--a sculptor he would have been, no  doubt--who made a statue of a girl, and what should happen one morning  but that the bally thing suddenly came to life. A pretty nasty shock for  the chap, of course, but the point I'm working round to is that there  were a couple of lines that went, if I remember correctly:    _She starts. She moves. She seems to feel  The stir of life along her keel._    And what I'm driving at is that you couldn't get a better description of  what happened to Gussie as I spoke these heartening words. His brow  cleared, his eyes brightened, he lost that fishy look, and he gazed at  the slug, which was still on the long, long trail with something  approaching bonhomie. A marked improvement.    \"I see what you mean. You will sort of pave the way, as it were.\"    \"That's right. Spadework.\"    \"It's a terrific idea, Bertie. It will make all the difference.\"    \"Quite. But don't forget that after that it will be up to you. You will  have to haul up your slacks and give her the old oil, or my efforts will  have been in vain.\"    Something of his former Gawd-help-us-ness seemed to return to him. He  gasped a bit.    \"That's true. What the dickens shall I say?\"    I restrained my impatience with an effort. The man had been at school  with me.    \"Dash it, there are hundreds of things you can say. Talk about the  sunset.\"    \"The sunset?\"    \"Certainly. Half the married men you meet began by talking about the  sunset.\"    \"But what can I say about the sunset?\"    \"Well, Jeeves got off a good one the other day. I met him airing the dog  in the park one evening, and he said, 'Now fades the glimmering landscape  on the sight, sir, and all the air a solemn stillness holds.' You might  use that.\"    \"What sort of landscape?\"    \"Glimmering. _G_ for 'gastritis,' _l_ for 'lizard'----\"    \"Oh, glimmering? Yes, that's not bad. Glimmering landscape ... solemn  stillness.... Yes, I call that pretty good.\"    \"You could then say that you have often thought that the stars are God's  daisy chain.\"    \"But I haven't.\"    \"I dare say not. But she has. Hand her that one, and I don't see how she  can help feeling that you're a twin soul.\"    \"God's daisy chain?\"    \"God's daisy chain. And then you go on about how twilight always makes  you sad. I know you're going to say it doesn't, but on this occasion it  has jolly well got to.\"    \"Why?\"    \"That's just what she will ask, and you will then have got her going.  Because you will reply that it is because yours is such a lonely life. It  wouldn't be a bad idea to give her a brief description of a typical home  evening at your Lincolnshire residence, showing how you pace the meadows  with a heavy tread.\"    \"I generally sit indoors and listen to the wireless.\"    \"No, you don't. You pace the meadows with a heavy tread, wishing that you  had someone to love you. And then you speak of the day when she came into  your life.\"    \"Like a fairy princess.\"    \"Absolutely,\" I said with approval. I hadn't expected such a hot one from  such a quarter. \"Like a fairy princess. Nice work, Gussie.\"    \"And then?\"    \"Well, after that it's easy. You say you have something you want to say  to her, and then you snap into it. I don't see how it can fail. If I were  you, I should do it in this rose garden. It is well established that  there is no sounder move than to steer the adored object into rose  gardens in the gloaming. And you had better have a couple of quick ones  first.\"    \"Quick ones?\"    \"Snifters.\"    \"Drinks, do you mean? But I don't drink.\"    \"What?\"    \"I've never touched a drop in my life.\"    This made me a bit dubious, I must confess. On these occasions it is  generally conceded that a moderate skinful is of the essence.    However, if the facts were as he had stated, I supposed there was nothing  to be done about it.    \"Well, you'll have to make out as best you can on ginger pop.\"    \"I always drink orange juice.\"    \"Orange juice, then. Tell me, Gussie, to settle a bet, do you really like  that muck?\"    \"Very much.\"    \"Then there is no more to be said.

She went out  at about half-past three, and told me she was going to Spence's, in St.  Paul's Churchyard, to try on her new tailor-made gown. Mrs. Hazeldene  had meant to go there in the morning, but was prevented as Mr. Errington  called.'    \"'Mr. Errington?' asked the coroner casually. 'Who is Mr. Errington?'    \"But this Emma found difficult to explain. Mr. Errington was--Mr.  Errington, that's all.    \"'Mr. Errington was a friend of the family. He lived in a flat in the  Albert Mansions. He very often came to Addison Row, and generally stayed  late.'    \"Pressed still further with questions, Emma at last stated that latterly  Mrs. Hazeldene had been to the theatre several times with Mr. Errington,  and that on those nights the master looked very gloomy, and was very  cross.    \"Recalled, the young widower was strangely reticent. He gave forth his  answers very grudgingly, and the coroner was evidently absolutely  satisfied with himself at the marvellous way in which, after a quarter  of an hour of firm yet very kind questionings, he had elicited from the  witness what information he wanted.    \"Mr. Errington was a friend of his wife. He was a gentleman of means,  and seemed to have a great deal of time at his command. He himself did  not particularly care about Mr. Errington, but he certainly had never  made any observations to his wife on the subject.    \"'But who is Mr. Errington?' repeated the coroner once more. 'What does  he do? What is his business or profession?'    \"'He has no business or profession.    \"'What is his occupation, then?    \"He has no special occupation. He has ample private means. But he has a  great and very absorbing hobby.'    \"'What is that?'    \"'He spends all his time in chemical experiments, and is, I believe, as  an amateur, a very distinguished toxicologist.'\"          CHAPTER XI    MR. ERRINGTON      \"Did you ever see Mr. Errington, the gentleman so closely connected with  the mysterious death on the Underground Railway?\" asked the man in the  corner as he placed one or two of his little snap-shot photos before  Miss Polly Burton.    \"There he is, to the very life. Fairly good-looking, a pleasant face  enough, but ordinary, absolutely ordinary.    \"It was this absence of any peculiarity which very nearly, but not  quite, placed the halter round Mr. Errington's neck.    \"But I am going too fast, and you will lose the thread.    \"The public, of course, never heard how it actually came about that Mr.  Errington, the wealthy bachelor of Albert Mansions, of the Grosvenor,  and other young dandies' clubs, one fine day found himself before the  magistrates at Bow Street, charged with being concerned in the death of  Mary Beatrice Hazeldene, late of No. 19, Addison Row.    \"I can assure you both press and public were literally flabbergasted.  You see, Mr. Errington was a well-known and very popular member of a  certain smart section of London society. He was a constant visitor at  the opera, the racecourse, the Park, and the Carlton, he had a great  many friends, and there was consequently quite a large attendance at the  police court that morning.    \"What had transpired was this:    \"After the very scrappy bits of evidence which came to light at the  inquest, two gentlemen bethought themselves that perhaps they had some  duty to perform towards the State and the public generally. Accordingly  they had come forward, offering to throw what light they could upon the  mysterious affair on the Underground Railway.    \"The police naturally felt that their information, such as it was, came  rather late in the day, but as it proved of paramount importance, and  the two gentlemen, moreover, were of undoubtedly good position in the  world, they were thankful for what they could get, and acted  accordingly; they accordingly brought Mr. Errington up before the  magistrate on a charge of murder.    \"The accused looked pale and worried when I first caught sight of him in  the court that day, which was not to be wondered at, considering the  terrible position in which he found himself.    \"He had been arrested at Marseilles, where he was preparing to start for  Colombo.    \"I don't think he realized how terrible his position really was until  later in the proceedings, when all the evidence relating to the arrest  had been heard, and Emma Funnel had repeated her statement as to Mr.  Errington's call at 19, Addison Row, in the morning, and Mrs. Hazeldene  starting off for St. Paul's Churchyard at 3.30 in the afternoon.    \"Mr. Hazeldene had nothing to add to the statements he had made at the  coroner's inquest. He had last seen his wife alive on the morning of the  fatal day. She had seemed very well and cheerful.    \"I think every one present understood that he was trying to say as  little as possible that could in any way couple his deceased wife's name  with that of the accused.    \"And yet, from the servant's evidence, it undoubtedly leaked out that  Mrs. Hazeldene, who was young, pretty, and evidently fond of admiration,  had once or twice annoyed her husband by her somewhat open, yet  perfectly innocent, flirtation with Mr. Errington.    \"I think every one was most agreeably impressed by the widower's  moderate and dignified attitude. You will see his photo there, among  this bundle. That is just how he appeared in court. In deep black, of  course, but without any sign of ostentation in his mourning. He had  allowed his beard to grow lately, and wore it closely cut in a point.    \"After his evidence, the sensation of the day occurred. A tall,  dark-haired man, with the word 'City' written metaphorically all over  him, had kissed the book, and was waiting to tell the truth, and nothing  but the truth.    \"He gave his name as Andrew Campbell, head of the firm of Campbell &  Co., brokers, of Throgmorton Street.    \"In the afternoon of March 18th Mr. Campbell, travelling on the  Underground Railway, had noticed a very pretty woman in the same  carriage as himself. She had asked him if she was in the right train for  Aldersgate. Mr. Campbell replied in the affirmative, and then buried  himself in the Stock Exchange quotations of his evening paper.    \"At Gower Street, a gentleman in a tweed suit and bowler hat got into  the carriage, and took a seat opposite the lady.    \"She seemed very much astonished at seeing him, but Mr. Andrew Campbell  did not recollect the exact words she said.    \"The two talked to one another a good deal, and certainly the lady  appeared animated and cheerful. Witness took no notice of them; he was  very much engrossed in some calculations, and finally got out at  Farringdon Street. He noticed that the man in the tweed suit also got  out close behind him, having shaken hands with the lady, and said in a  pleasant way: '_Au revoir_! Don't be late to-night.' Mr. Campbell did  not hear the lady's reply, and soon lost sight of the man in the crowd.    \"Every one was on tenter-hooks, and eagerly waiting for the palpitating  moment when witness would describe and identify the man who last had  seen and spoken to the unfortunate woman, within five minutes probably  of her strange and unaccountable death.    \"Personally I knew what was coming before the Scotch stockbroker spoke.    \"I could have jotted down the graphic and lifelike description he would  give of a probable murderer. It would have fitted equally well the man  who sat and had luncheon at this table just now; it would certainly have  described five out of every ten young Englishmen you know.    \"The individual was of medium height, he wore a moustache which was not  very fair nor yet very dark, his hair was between colours. He wore a  bowler hat, and a tweed suit--and--and--that was all--Mr. Campbell might  perhaps know him again, but then again, he might not--he was not paying  much attention--the gentleman was sitting on the same side of the  carriage as himself--and he had his hat on all the time. He himself was  busy with his newspaper--yes--he might know him again--but he really  could not say.    \"Mr. Andrew Campbell's evidence was not worth very much, you will say.  No, it was not in itself, and would not have justified any arrest were  it not for the additional statements made by Mr. James Verner, manager  of Messrs. Rodney & Co., colour printers.    \"Mr. Verner is a personal friend of Mr. Andrew Campbell, and it appears  that at Farringdon Street, where he was waiting for his train, he saw  Mr. Campbell get out of a first-class railway carriage. Mr. Verner spoke  to him for a second, and then, just as the train was moving off, he  stepped into the same compartment which had just been vacated by the  stockbroker and the man in the tweed suit. He vaguely recollects a lady  sitting in the opposite corner to his own, with her face turned away  from him, apparently asleep, but he paid no special attention to her. He  was like nearly all business men when they are travelling--engrossed in  his paper. Presently a special quotation interested him; he wished to  make a note of it, took out a pencil from his waistcoat pocket, and  seeing a clean piece of paste-board on the floor, he picked it up, and  scribbled on it the memorandum, which he wished to keep. He then  slipped the card into his pocket-book.    \"'It was only two or three days later,' added Mr. Verner in the midst of  breathless silence, 'that I had occasion to refer to these same notes  again.    \"'In the meanwhile the papers had been full of the mysterious death on  the Underground Railway, and the names of those connected with it were  pretty familiar to me. It was, therefore, with much astonishment that on  looking at the paste-board which I had casually picked up in the railway  carriage I saw the name on it, \"Frank Errington.\"'    \"There was no doubt that the sensation in court was almost  unprecedented.
