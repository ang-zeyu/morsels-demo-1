It was known to be quite useless to attempt to decoy Merriwell out, so  dependence must be placed on chance. If he came out with no more than  one or two companions his name was \"mud,\" according to the assembled  sophs.    Arrangements were made to bind handkerchiefs over their faces to the  eyes, so they would be partly disguised. Some of them turned their coats  wrong side out, and some resorted to other means of disguising  themselves.    Then they waited patiently.    It was not so very long before Ditson came out in a breathless hurry. He  signaled, and they called him. As he hastened up he panted:    \"Merriwell is coming right out, fellows! Be ready for him!\"    The sophomores knew which way Frank was likely to go after leaving  Billy's, and they lay in wait at a convenient spot.    \"Is he alone?\" eagerly asked Puss Parker.    \"No.\"    \"Who is with him?\"    \"Rattleton.\"    \"Any others?\"    \"Not likely.\"    \"Good! Take a tumble to yourself and skip.\"    Ditson did so.    \"Now, fellows,\" hurriedly said Browning, \"be ready for a struggle.  Remember that Merriwell is a scrapper and he is likely to resist. We  must take him completely by surprise. Get back and lay quiet till I give  the signal.\"    They did as directed, and as they were in a dark corner, there was not  much danger that they would be seen till they were ready to light on  their game.    Footsteps were heard.    \"Here he comes!\"    Browning peered out, and two figures were seen approaching.    \"How many?\" anxiously whispered Tad Horner, quivering with anxiety.    \"Two. They are easy. Ready for the rush.\"    The sophomores crouched like savage warriors in ambush.    Merriwell's peculiar, pleasant laugh was heard as the two unsuspecting  freshmen approached.    Rattleton was talking, and, as usual, he was twisting his expression in  his haste to say the things which flashed through his head.    \"It doesn't make a dit of bifference if we haven't proved anything  against him, I say Ditson can't be trusted. He's got a mooked crug--I  mean a crooked mug.\"    \"Oh, don't be too hard on the fellow till you know something for sure,\"  advised Merriwell. \"I will confess that I do not like him, but--\"    There was a sudden rush of dark figures out of the shadows, and the two  freshmen were clutched. Coats were flung over their heads and they were  crashed to the ground.    Although taken by surprise, both lads struggled.    In the suddenness of the rush Browning had made a mistake and flung  himself on Rattleton, while he had intended to grasp Merriwell. The coat  being cast over the head of the lad prevented him from discovering his  mistake.    Punch Swallows and Andy Emery were devoting themselves to Merriwell, and  it was their first impression that they had tackled Rattleton.    For an instant it seemed that the trick had worked to perfection, and  the freshmen had been made captives easily.    Then came a surprise.    Swallows and Emery were unable to hold their man down. He tore off the  smothering coat and rose with them, despite all they could do. They  cried out for help:    \"Give us a hand, fellows! He's like an eel! Quick!\"    Some of the sophs had been unable to render much assistance, and they  now did their best to aid Swallows and Emery. In their haste to do  something they seemed to get in the way of each other.    \"Well, I don't know--I don't know!\" laughed a familiar voice, and the  freshman gave Swallows a snap that lifted him off his feet and cast him  into the stomach of another fellow, who received such a blow from  Punch's head that the wind was knocked out of him in a moment.    \"We'll have to see about this,\" said the freshman as he cracked Emery on  the jaw and broke his hold.    \"Great smoke! It's Merriwell!\" gurgled Emery as he reeled back.    \"Onto him, fellows!\" urged a soph, and Frank suddenly found six or seven  of the crowd were at him.    Just how he did it no one could tell, but he broke straight through the  crowd and in another moment was rushing back toward Billy's, shouting:    \"Lambda Chi! Lambda Chi!\"    It was useless to try to follow him, as all quickly saw.    In the meantime Rattleton had been cornered, and the disappointed sophs  resolved to escape with him. They lifted him and made a rush for the  cab. He was bundled in, and away went the cab.    Frank rushed into Billy's and gave the alarm. He was out again in a  very few seconds, with a crowd of excited freshmen at his heels; but  when they came to look for the sophomores and Rattleton they found  nothing.    \"Confound it!\" exclaimed Frank in dismay. \"How could they get him away  so quick? I can't understand it.\"    The freshmen searched, but they found nothing to reward them. Rattleton  was in the toils of the enemy, and the would-be rescuers were given no  opportunity to rescue him.    Then Merriwell blamed himself for leaving his roommate at all. But  Billy's had been so near and his chance with his many assailants had  seemed so slim that he had done what seemed the right thing to do on the  spur of the moment. He had not fancied that the sophomores would be able  to get Harry away before he could arouse the freshmen and bring them to  the rescue.    \"Poor Harry! I wonder what they will do with him?\" Frank speculated.    \"Oh, they won't do a thing with him!\" gurgled Bandy Robinson.    \"How did it happen, anyway?\" asked Roland Ditson, who had joined the  freshmen after the affair was over.    He tried to appear innocent and filled with wonder and curiosity, but  his unpopularity was apparent from the fact that nobody paid enough  attention to him to answer his question.    Frank, however, found it necessary to tell his companions all about the  assault, and Ditson pretended to listen with interest, as if he had  known nothing of the affair.    The freshmen went back to Billy's and held a council. It was decided to  divide into squads and make an attempt to find out where Harry had been  taken.    This was done, but it proved without result, and not far from midnight  all the freshmen who had been there at the time of the capture, and many  others, were again gathered at Billy's. They were quite excited over the  affair, and it seemed that the beer they had absorbed had gone to the  heads of some of them.    In the midst of an excited discussion the door burst open, and a most  grotesque-looking figure staggered into the room. It was a person who  was stripped to the waist and painted and adorned like a redskin, his  face striped with red and white and yellow, his hair stuck full of  feathers, and his body decorated with what seemed to be tattooing.    \"Bive me a gear--I mean give me a beer!\" gasped that fantastic  individual. \"I am nearly dead!\"    \"It's Rattleton!\" shouted the freshmen.    They crowded around him.    \"Well, say, you are a bird!\" cried Lucy Little, whose right name was  Lewis Little.    \"A regular bird of paradise,\" chuckled Bandy Robinson.    \"Where are those fellows?\" demanded Frank Merriwell. \"Where did they  leave you? Tell me, old man.\"    \"At the door,\" faintly replied Rattleton as he reached for a mug of beer  which some one held toward him. \"They took me right up to the door and  made me come in here.\"    \"Out!\" shouted Frank--\"out and after them! Capture one of them if  possible! We want to even this thing up.\"    Out they rushed, but once more the crafty sophomores had vanished, and  not one of them was to be found.    The freshmen went back and listened to Harry's story. He told how he had  been blindfolded and taken somewhere, he did not know where. There they  had kept him while his friends were searching. When there was no danger  that the freshmen would discover them, they set out to have fun with  Rattleton.    \"Say, Merry, old man,\" said Harry, \"I know Browning was the leader of  this job, although he was disguised. They seemed to feel pretty bad  because you got away. They got twisted--took me for you at first, and by  the time they discovered their mistake you were knocking them around  like tenpins. One chap insists you broke his jaw.\"    \"Well, I am glad I did that much. I didn't mean to leave you, Harry.  Billy's was so near I thought I could get the boys out and rescue you  before they could carry you off. I couldn't rescue you alone, so I ran  here to stir up the fellows.\"    \"That was right. I was glad you got away. They were laying for you. They  told me so.\"    \"Well, come back, and we'll wash this stuff off you.\"    \"I don't know as you can do it.\"    \"Eh? Why not?\"    \"They said it was put on to stay a while. They told me we were so fond  of playing the noble red man's part that they would fix me so I could  play it for a week or two. Some of them advised me to use sand to scrub  myself with if I hoped to get the paint off.\"    \"Oh, that must be all a bluff. It will come off easy enough if a little  cocoa butter is used on it. Here, somebody run out to a drug store and  get some cocoa butter.\"    After they had worked about fifteen minutes they looked at each other  in dismay, for they had scarcely been able to start the paint, and it  become plain that cocoa butter, soap and water would not take it off.    \"Didn't I tell you?\" murmured Harry, sorrowfully. \"I'm done for! I'll  never be able to get it off! I'll have to go out West and live with the  Sioux! If I do I'll take along the scalps of a few sophomores!\"    They continued to work on him for nearly an hour, but were unable to get  off more than a certain portion of the paint. Harry was still  grotesquely decorated when the boys arrived at the conclusion that  further scrubbing with the materials at hand was useless.    Then Frank went out and rang up a druggist who had gone to bed, for it  was after midnight. He told the man the sort of scrape his friend was in  and offered the druggist inducements"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1112"],[0,"The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet (#14)"],[1,"cians.        Friar. Come, is the bride ready to go to church?      Cap. Ready to go, but never to return.      O son, the night before thy wedding day      Hath Death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies,      Flower as she was, deflowered by him.      Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;      My daughter he hath wedded. I will die      And leave him all.

But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,      But one thing to rejoice and solace in,      And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!      Nurse. O woe? O woful, woful, woful day!      Most lamentable day, most woful day      That ever ever I did yet behold!      O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!      Never was seen so black a day as this.      O woful day! O woful day!      Par.

Dead art thou, dead! alack, my child is dead,      And with my child my joys are buried!      Friar. Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives not      In these confusions. Heaven and yourself      Had part in this fair maid! now heaven hath all,      And all the better is it for the maid.      Your part in her you could not keep from death,      But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.      The most you sought was her promotion,      For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;      And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd      Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?      O, in this love, you love your child so ill      That you run mad, seeing that she is well.      She's not well married that lives married long,      But she's best married that dies married young.      Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary      On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,      In all her best array bear her to church;      For though fond nature bids us all lament,      Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.      Cap.

O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'    1. Mus. Why 'Heart's ease'',      Pet. O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is      full of woe.' O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.    1. Mus. Not a dump we! 'Tis no time to play now.      Pet. You will not then?    1. Mus. No.      Pet. I will then give it you soundly.    1. Mus.

Rom. If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep      My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.      My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,      And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit      Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.      I dreamt my lady came and found me dead      (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!)      And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips      That I reviv'd and was an emperor.      Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,      When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!                    Enter Romeo's Man Balthasar, booted.        News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?      Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?      How doth my lady? Is my father well?      How fares my Juliet? That I ask again,      For nothing can be ill if she be well.      Man. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.      Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,      And her immortal part with angels lives.      I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault      And presently took post to tell it you.      O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,      Since you did leave it for my office, sir.      Rom. Is it e'en so? Then I defy you, stars!      Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper      And hire posthorses. I will hence to-night.      Man. I do beseech you, sir, have patience.      Your looks are pale and wild and do import      Some misadventure.      Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv'd.      Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.      Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?      Man. No, my good lord.      Rom. No matter. Get thee gone      And hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.                                                 Exit [Balthasar].      Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.      Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift      To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!      I do remember an apothecary,      And hereabouts 'a dwells, which late I noted      In tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,      Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks,      Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;      And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,      An alligator stuff'd, and other skins      Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves      A beggarly account of empty boxes,      Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,      Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses      Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.      Noting this penury, to myself I said,      'An if a man did need a poison now      Whose sale is present death in Mantua,      Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'      O, this same thought did but forerun my need,      And this same needy man must sell it me.      As I remember, this should be the house.      Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!                            Enter Apothecary.        Apoth. Who calls so loud?      Rom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.      Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have      A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear      As will disperse itself through all the veins      That the life-weary taker mall fall dead,      And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath      As violently as hasty powder fir'd      Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.      Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law      Is death to any he that utters them.      Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness      And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,      Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,      Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back:      The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;      The world affords no law to make thee rich;      Then be not poor, but break it and take this.      Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents.      Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.      Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will      And drink it off, and if you had the strength      Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.      Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,      Doing more murther in this loathsome world,      Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.      I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.      Farewell. Buy food and get thyself in flesh.      Come, cordial and not poison, go with me      To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.                                                           Exeunt.          Scene II.  Verona.
