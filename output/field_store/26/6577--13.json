No one of his color stirred, but two  Negro convalescents at once went to his assistance. When volunteers  were called for to cook for the sick, only Negroes responded. They  were pleased to be of service to their officers. If the Captain's  child is ill, every man in the company is solicitous; half of them  want to act as nurse. They feel honored to be hired to look after an  officer's horse and clothing. The \"striker\" as he is called, soon gets  to look on himself as a part of his master; it is no \"Captain has been  ordered away,\" but \"We have been ordered away.\" Every concern of his  employer about which he knows interests him, and a slight to his  superior is vastly more of an offence than if offered to himself.  Indeed, if the army knew how well officers of the colored regiments  are looked after by their men, there would be less disinclination to  serve in such commands. After years with a Negro company, officers  find it difficult to get along with white soldiers. They must be much  more careful to avoid hurting sensibilities, and must do without many  little services to which they have been accustomed.           *       *       *       *       *    MRS. PORTER'S RIDE TO THE FRONT.    For many years she has known and admired Miss Barton and against the  advice of her friends had resolved to help Miss Barton in her task of  succoring the sufferers in Cuba.    During the second day's fighting Mrs. Porter, escorted by a general  whom she has known for many years, rode almost to the firing line.  Bullets whistled about her head, but she rode bravely on until her  curiosity was satisfied. Then she rode leisurely back to safety. She  came back filled with admiration of the colored troops. She  described them as being \"brave in battle, obedient under orders and  philosophical under privations.\"    Thanks to Mrs. Porter, the wife of the President's private secretary.  Mrs. Porter is one of heaven's blessings, sent as a messenger of \"The  Ship\" earth, to testify in America what she saw of the Negro troops in  Cuba.           *       *       *       *       *    THE INVESTMENT OF SANTIAGO AND SURRENDER.    (As Presented in the N.Y. World.)    General Shafter put a human rope of 22,400 men around Santiago, with  its 26,000 Spanish soldiers, and then Spain succumbed in despair. In  a semi-circle extending around Santiago, from Daliquiri on the east  clear around to Cobre on the west, our troops were stretched a cordon  of almost impenetrable thickness and strength. First came General  Bates, with the Ninth, Tenth, Third, Thirteenth, Twenty-first and  Twenty-fourth U.S. Infantry. On his right crouched General Sumner,  commanding the Third, Sixth and Ninth U.S. Cavalry. Next along the arc  were the Seventh, Twelfth and Seventeenth U.S. Infantry under General  Chaffee. Then, advantageously posted, there were six batteries of  artillery prepared to sweep the horizon under direction of General  Randolph. General Jacob Kent, with the Seventy-first New York  Volunteers and the Sixth and Sixteenth U.S. Infantry, held the centre.  They were flanked by General Wheeler and the Rough Riders, dismounted;  eight troops of the First U.S. Volunteers, four troops of the Second  U.S. Cavalry, four light batteries, two heavy batteries and then four  more troops of the Second U.S. Cavalry.

Then General Duffield's  command, comprising the volunteers from Michigan (Thirty-third and  Third Regiments), and the Ninth Massachusetts, stretched along until  Gen. Ludlow's men were reached. These comprised the First Illinois,  First District of Columbia, Eighth Ohio, running up to the Eighth and  Twenty-second Regulars and the Bay State men. Down by the shore across  from Morro and a little way inland Generals Henry and Garretson had  posted the Sixth Illinois and the crack Sixth Massachusetts, flanking  the railroad line to Cobre.    SCENES OF THE FINAL SURRENDER.    When reveille sounded Sunday morning half the great semi-lunar  camp was awake and eager for the triumphal entrance into the city.  Speculation ran rife as to which detachment would accompany the  General and his staff into Santiago. The choice fell upon the  Ninth Infantry. Shortly before 9 o'clock General Shafter left his  headquarters, accompanied by Generals Lawton and Wheeler, Colonels  Ludlow, Ames and Kent, and eighty other officers. The party walked  slowly down the hill to the road leading to Santiago, along which they  advanced until they reached the now famous tree outside the walls,  under which all negotiations for the surrender of the city had taken  place. As they reached this spot the cannon on every hillside and in  the city itself boomed forth a salute of twenty-one guns, which was  echoed at Siboney and Aserradero.    The soldiers knew what the salute meant, and cheer upon cheer arose  and ran from end to end of the eight miles of the American lines. A  troop of colored cavalry and the Twenty-fifth colored infantry then  started to join General Shafter and his party.    The Americans waited under the tree as usual, when General Shafter  sent word to General Toral that he was ready to take possession of the  town. General Toral, in full uniform, accompanied by his whole staff,  fully caparisoned, shortly afterward left the city and walked to where  the American officers were waiting their coming. When they reached the  tree General Shafter and General Toral saluted each other gravely and  courteously. Salutes were also exchanged by other American and Spanish  officers. The officers were then introduced to each other. After this  little ceremony the two commanding generals faced each other and  General Toral, speaking in Spanish, said:    \"Through fate I am forced to surrender to General Shafter, of the  American Army, the city and the strongholds of Santiago.\"    General Toral's voice grew husky as he spoke, giving up the town  and the surrounding country to his victorious enemy. As he finished  speaking the Spanish officers presented arms.    General Shafter, in reply, said:    \"I receive the city in the name of the government of the United  States.\"    General Toral addressed an order to his officers in Spanish and they  wheeled about, still presenting arms, and General Shafter and the  other American officers with the cavalry and infantry followed them,  walked by the Spaniards and proceeded into the city proper.    The soldiers on the American line could see quite plainly all the  proceedings. As their commander entered the city they gave voice to  cheer after cheer.    Although no attempt was made to humiliate them the Spanish soldiers  seemed at first to feel downcast and scarcely glanced at their  conquerors as they passed by, but this apparent depth of feeling was  not displayed very long. Without being sullen they appeared to be  utterly indifferent to the reverses of the Spanish arms, but it was  not long ere the prospect of regulation rations and a chance to go to  their homes made them almost cheerful. All about the filthy streets  of the city the starving refugees: could be seen, gaunt, hollow-eyed,  weak and trembling.    The squalor in the streets was dreadful. The bones of dead horses and  other animals were bleaching in the streets and buzzards almost as  tame as sparrows hopped aside as passers-by disturbed them. There  was a fetid smell everywhere and evidences of a pitiless siege and  starvation on every hand.    The palace was reached soon after 10 o'clock. Then, General Toral  introduced General Shafter and the other officials to various local  dignitaries and a scanty luncheon, was brought. Coffee, rice, wine and  toasted cake were the main condiments.    Then came the stirring scene in the balcony which every one felt was  destined to become notably historic in our annals of warfare, and the  ceremony over, General Shafter withdrew to our own lines and left the  city to General McKibbin and his police force of guards and sentries.  The end had come. Spain's haughty ensign trailed in the dust; Old  Glory, typifying liberty and the pursuit of happiness untrammelled  floated over the official buildings from Fort Morro to the Plaza de  Armas--the investment of Santiago de Cuba was accomplished.

I did not say that the petition was  signed by ladies. I referred to the papers in my hand, which I shall  proceed to lay before the Senate.    I hold in my hand an argument against woman suffrage by a lady very  well known in the United States, and well known to the Senators from  Massachusetts, a lady whose philanthropy, whose exertions in behalf  of the oppressed and poor and afflicted have given her a national  reputation. I refer to Mrs. Clara T. Leonard, the wife of a  distinguished lawyer, and whose words of themselves will command the  attention of the public.    The Chief Clerk read as follows:        [Letter from Mrs. Clara T. Leonard.]        The following letter was read by Thornton K. Lothrop, esq., at      the hearing before the Legislative committee on woman suffrage,      January 29, 1884:        The principal reasons assigned for giving suffrage to women are      these:        That the right to vote is a natural and inherent right of which      women are deprived by the tyranny of men.        That the fact that the majority of women do not wish for the right      or privilege to vote is not a reason for depriving the minority of      an inborn right.        That women are taxed but not represented, contrary to the      principles of free government.        That society would gain by the participation of women in      government, because women are purer and more conscientious than      men, and especially that the cause of temperance would be promoted      by women's votes.        Those women who are averse to female suffrage hold differing      opinions on all these points, and are entitled to be heard      fairly and without unjust reproach and contempt on the part of      \"suffragists,\" so called.        The right to vote is not an inherent right, but, like the right to      hold land, is conferred upon individuals by general consent, with      certain limitations, and for the general good of all.        It is as true to say that the earth was made for all its      inhabitants, and that human has a right to appropriate a portion      of its surface, as to say that all persons have a right to      participate in government. Many persons can be found to hold both      these opinions. Experience has proved that the general good is      promoted by ownership of the soil, with the resultant inducement      to its improvement.        Voting is simply a mathematical test of strength. Uncivilized      nations strive for mastery by physical combat, thus wasting life      and resources. Enlightened societies agree to determine the      relative strength of opposing parties by actual count. God has      made women weaker than men, incapable of taking part in battles,      indisposed to make riot and political disturbance.        The vote which, in the hand of a man, is a \"possible bayonet,\"      would not, when thrown by a woman, represent any physical power to      enforce her will. If all the women in the State voted in one way,      and all the men in the opposite one, the women, even if in the      majority, would not carry the day, because the vote would not be      an estimate of material strength and the power to enforce the      will of the majority. When one considers the strong passions and      conflicts excited in elections, it is vain to suppose that the      really stronger would yield to the weaker party.        It is no more unjust to deprive women of the ballot than to      deprive minors, who outnumber those above the age of majority, and      who might well claim, many of them, to be as well able to decide      political questions as their elders.        If the majority of women are either not desirous to vote or are      strongly opposed to voting, the minority should yield in this, as      they are obliged to do in all other public matters. In fact, they      will be obliged to yield, so long as the present state of opinion      exists among women in general, for legislators will naturally      consult the wishes of the women of their own families and      neighborhood, and be governed by them. There can be no doubt that      in this State, where women are highly respected and have great      influence, the ballot would be readily granted to them by men, if      they desired it, or generally approved of woman suffrage. Women      are taxed, it is true; so are minors, without the ballot; it is      untrue, to say that either class is not represented. The thousand      ties of relationship and friendship cause the identity of interest      between the sexes. What is good in a community for men, is good      also for their wives and sisters, daughters and friends. The laws      of Massachusetts discriminate much in favor of women, by exempting      unmarried women of small estate from taxation; by allowing women,      and not men, to acquire a settlement without paying a tax; by      compelling husbands to support their wives, but exempting the      wife, even when rich, from supporting an indigent husband; by      making men liable for debts of wives, and not _vice versa_. In the      days of the American Revolution, the first cause of complaint was,      that a whole people were taxed but not represented.        To-day there is not a single interest of woman which is not      shared and defended by men, not a subject in which she takes an      intelligent interest in which she cannot exert an influence in the      community proportional to her character and ability. It is because      the men who govern live not in a remote country, with separate      interests, but in the closest relations of family and      neighborhood, and bound by the tenderest ties to the other sex,      who are fully and well represented by relations, friends, and      neighbors in every locality. That women are purer and more      conscientious than men, as a sex, is exceedingly doubtful when      applied to politics. The faults of the sexes are different,      according to their constitution and habits of life. Men are more      violent and open in their misdeeds, but any person who knows human      nature well and has examined it in its various phases knows that      each sex is open to its peculiar temptation and sin; that the      human heart is weak and prone to evil without distinction of sex.        It seems certain that, were women admitted to vote and to hold      political office, all the intrigue, corruption, and selfishness      displayed by men in political life would also be found among      women. In the temperance cause we should gain little or nothing by      admitting women to vote, for two reasons: first, that experience      has proved that the strictest laws can not be enforced if a great      number of people determine to drink liquor; secondly, because      among women voters we should find in our cities thousands of      foreign birth who habitually drink beer and spirits daily without      intoxication, and who regard license or prohibitory laws as an      infringement of their liberty. It has been said that municipal      suffrage for women in England has proved a political success. Even      if this is true, it offers no parallel to the condition of things      in our own cities. First, because there is in England a property      qualification required to vote, which excludes the more ignorant      and irresponsible classes, and makes women voters few and      generally intelligent; secondly, because England is an old,      conservative country, with much emigration and but little      immigration.        Here is a constant influx of foreigners: illiterate, without love    "]]]
