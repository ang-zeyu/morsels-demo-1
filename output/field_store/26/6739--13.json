Nor were they ever for a moment free from apprehensions  of some great treason at home. For in that age it had become a point of  conscience and of honour with many men of generous natures to sacrifice  their country to their religion. A succession of dark plots, formed by  Roman Catholics against the life of the Queen and the existence of the  nation, kept society in constant alarm. Whatever might be the faults of  Elizabeth, it was plain that, to speak humanly, the fate of the realm  and of all reformed Churches was staked on the security of her person  and on the success of her administration. To strengthen her hands was,  therefore, the first duty of a patriot and a Protestant; and that duty  was well performed. The Puritans, even in the depths of the prisons to  which she had sent them, prayed, and with no simulated fervour, that she  might be kept from the dagger of the assassin, that rebellion might be  put down under her feet, and that her arms might be victorious by sea  and land. One of the most stubborn of the stubborn sect, immediately  after his hand had been lopped off for an offence into which he had been  hurried by his intemperate zeal, waved his hat with the hand which was  still left him, and shouted \"God save the Queen!\" The sentiment with  which these men regarded her has descended to their posterity. The  Nonconformists, rigorously as she treated them, have, as a body, always  venerated her memory. [5]    During the greater part of her reign, therefore, the Puritans in the  House of Commons, though sometimes mutinous, felt no disposition to  array themselves in systematic opposition to the government. But,  when the defeat of the Armada, the successful resistance of the United  Provinces to the Spanish power, the firm establishment of Henry the  Fourth on the throne of France, and the death of Philip the Second,  had secured the State and the Church against all danger from abroad,  an obstinate struggle, destined to last during several generations,  instantly began at home.    It was in the Parliament of 1601 that the opposition which had, during  forty years, been silently gathering and husbanding strength, fought  its first great battle and won its first victory. The ground was well  chosen. The English Sovereigns had always been entrusted with the  supreme direction of commercial police. It was their undoubted  prerogative to regulate coin, weights, and measures, and to appoint  fairs, markets, and ports. The line which bounded their authority over  trade had, as usual, been but loosely drawn. They therefore, as usual,  encroached on the province which rightfully belonged to the legislature.  The encroachment was, as usual, patiently borne, till it became serious.  But at length the Queen took upon herself to grant patents of monopoly  by scores. There was scarcely a family in the realm which did not  feel itself aggrieved by the oppression and extortion which this abuse  naturally caused. Iron, oil, vinegar, coal, saltpetre, lead, starch,  yarn, skins, leather, glass, could be bought only at exorbitant prices.  The House of Commons met in an angry and determined mood. It was in vain  that a courtly minority blamed the Speaker for suffering the acts of  the Queen's Highness to be called in question. The language of the  discontented party was high and menacing, and was echoed by the voice  of the whole nation. The coach of the chief minister of the crown was  surrounded by an indignant populace, who cursed the monopolies, and  exclaimed that the prerogative should not be suffered to touch the old  liberties of England. There seemed for a moment to be some danger that  the long and glorious reign of Elizabeth would have a shameful and  disastrous end. She, however, with admirable judgment and temper,  declined the contest, put herself at the head of the reforming party,  redressed the grievance, thanked the Commons, in touching and dignified  language, for their tender care of the general weal, brought back to  herself the hearts of the people, and left to her successors a memorable  example of the way in which it behoves a ruler to deal with public  movements which he has not the means of resisting.    In the year 1603 the great Queen died. That year is, on many accounts,  one of the most important epochs in our history. It was then that both  Scotland and Ireland became parts of the same empire with England. Both  Scotland and Ireland, indeed, had been subjugated by the Plantagenets;  but neither country had been patient under the yoke. Scotland had, with  heroic energy, vindicated her independence, had, from the time of Robert  Bruce, been a separate kingdom, and was now joined to the southern  part of the island in a manner which rather gratified than wounded her  national pride. Ireland had never, since the days of Henry the Second,  been able to expel the foreign invaders; but she had struggled against  them long and fiercely. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries  the English power in that island was constantly declining, and in the  days of Henry the Seventh, sank to the lowest point. The Irish dominions  of that prince consisted only of the counties of Dublin and Louth, of  some parts of Meath and Kildare, and of a few seaports scattered along  the coast. A large portion even of Leinster was not yet divided into  counties. Munster, Ulster, and Connaught were ruled by petty sovereigns,  partly Celts, and partly degenerate Normans, who had forgotten their  origin and had adopted the Celtic language and manners. But during the  sixteenth century, the English power had made great progress. The half  savage chieftains who reigned beyond the pale had submitted one after  another to the lieutenants of the Tudors. At length, a few weeks before  the death of Elizabeth, the conquest, which had been begun more than  four hundred years before by Strongbow, was completed by Mountjoy.  Scarcely had James the First mounted the English throne when the last  O'Donnel and O'Neil who have held the rank of independent princes kissed  his hand at Whitehall. Thenceforward his writs ran and his judges held  assizes in every part of Ireland; and the English law superseded the  customs which had prevailed among the aboriginal tribes.    In extent Scotland and Ireland were nearly equal to each other, and were  together nearly equal to England, but were much less thickly  peopled than England, and were very far behind England in wealth and  civilisation. Scotland had been kept back by the sterility of her soil;  and, in the midst of light, the thick darkness of the middle ages still  rested on Ireland.    The population of Scotland, with the exception of the Celtic tribes  which were thinly scattered over the Hebrides and over the mountainous  parts of the northern shires, was of the same blood with the population  of England, and spoke a tongue which did not differ from the purest  English more than the dialects of Somersetshire and Lancashire differed  from each other. In Ireland, on the contrary, the population, with the  exception of the small English colony near the coast, was Celtic, and  still kept the Celtic speech and manners.    In natural courage and intelligence both the nations which now became  connected with England ranked high. In perseverance, in selfcommand, in  forethought, in all the virtues which conduce to success in life, the  Scots have never been surpassed. The Irish, on the other hand, were  distinguished by qualities which tend to make men interesting rather  than prosperous. They were an ardent and impetuous race, easily moved  to tears or to laughter, to fury or to love. Alone among the nations of  northern Europe they had the susceptibility, the vivacity, the natural  turn for acting and rhetoric, which are indigenous on the shores of the  Mediterranean Sea. In mental cultivation Scotland had an indisputable  superiority. Though that kingdom was then the poorest in Christendom,  it already vied in every branch of learning with the most favoured  countries. Scotsmen, whose dwellings and whose food were as wretched as  those of the Icelanders of our time, wrote Latin verse with more than  the delicacy of Vida, and made discoveries in science which would have  added to the renown of Galileo. Ireland could boast of no Buchanan or  Napier. The genius, with which her aboriginal inhabitants were largely  endowed' showed itself as yet only in ballads which wild and rugged as  they were, seemed to the judging eye of Spenser to contain a portion of  the pure gold of poetry.    Scotland, in becoming part of the British monarchy, preserved her  dignity. Having, during many generations, courageously withstood the  English arms, she was now joined to her stronger neighbour on the most  honourable terms. She gave a King instead of receiving one. She retained  her own constitution and laws. Her tribunals and parliaments remained  entirely independent of the tribunals and parliaments which sate at  Westminster. The administration of Scotland was in Scottish hands; for  no Englishman had any motive to emigrate northward, and to contend with  the shrewdest and most pertinacious of all races for what was to be  scraped together in the poorest of all treasuries. Nevertheless Scotland  by no means escaped the fate ordained for every country which is  connected, but not incorporated, with another country of greater  resources. Though in name an independent kingdom, she was, during more  than a century, really treated, in many respects, as a subject province.    Ireland was undisguisedly governed as a dependency won by the sword. Her  rude national institutions had perished. The English colonists submitted  to the dictation of the mother country, without whose support they could  not exist, and indemnified themselves by trampling on the people among  whom they had settled. The parliaments which met at Dublin could pass no  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1470"],[0,"The Fall of the Moghul Empire of Hindustan (#14)"],[1,"treaty confirming the terms  broached after the battle of Buxar was now concluded, and Audh,  together with part of the Doab, made over to the Nawab Vazir  Shujaa-ud-daulah, who, being thus reinstated as a feudatory of  the British Diwans, returned to his own country, leaving Shah  'Alam at Allahabad as a British pensioner.    The terms accorded to the Emperor will be seen from the  counterpart issued by him, part of which is subjoined:    \" + + + Whereas, in consideration of the attachment and services  of the high and mighty, the noblest of nobles, the chief of  illustrious warriors, our faithful servants and loyal  well-wishers, worthy of royal favour the English Company, we have  granted to them the Diwani of the Soobahs of Bengal, Bahar, and  Orissa, from the beginning of the spring harvest of the Bengal  year 1171, as a free gift and fief (Al tumgha), without the  association of any other person, and with an exemption from the  payment of the tribute of the Diwan which used to be paid to this  court; it is therefore requisite that the said Company engage to  be security for the sum of twenty-six lakhs of rupees a year for  our revenue (which sum has been imposed upon the Nawab), and  regularly remit the same.    \"Given on the 8th Safar, in the sixth year of our reign.\"    The Nawab was to continue Subahdar, the Company was to be his  colleague for purposes of civil and fiscal administration, they  were to support the Nawab's (Nizamat) expenses, and to pay the  tribute (Nazarana) in his name.    The Emperor's establishment during the next few years is thus  described by a British officer who enjoyed his intimacy:  \"He  keeps the poor resemblance of a Court at Allahabad, where a few  ruined omrahs, in hopes of better days to their prince, having  expended their fortunes in his service, still exist, the ragged  pensioners of his poverty, and burden his gratitude with their  presence. The districts in the king's possession are valued at  thirty lakhs, which is one-half more than they are able to bear.  Instead of gaining by this bad policy, that prince, unfortunate  in many respects, has the mortification to see his poor subjects  oppressed by those who farm the revenue, while he himself is  obliged to compound with the farmers for half the stipulated sum.  This, with the treaty payment from the revenues of Bengal, is all  Shah Alum possesses to support the dignity of the Imperial house  of Timor. [Dow. ii. 356, A.D. 1767.]    The following further particulars respecting Shah 'Alam's Court  at this period are furnished by Gholam Hossain, and should be  noted here as relating to personages of some of whom we shall  hear more anon.    Mirza Najaf Khan, the Imperial General, was a Persian noble of  high, even of royal, extraction, and destined to play a  conspicuous part in the events related in a large portion of the  remainder of this history. It will suffice, for the present, to  state that, having been a close follower of Mohammad Kuli, he  joined the British after that Chief's murder (Vide Sup. p. 68)  and was by them recommended to the Emperor for employment. He  received a stipend of one lakh a year, and was nominated Governor  of Kora, where he occupied himself in the suppression of  banditti, and in the establishment of the Imperial authority.  Under the modest state of steward of the household,  Manir-ud-daulah was the Emperor's most trusted councillor and  medium of communication with the English. Raja Ram Nath, whom we  saw accompanying the prince in his escape from Dehli, continued  about him; but the chief favourite was an illiterate ruffian  called by the title Hissam-ud-daulah, who stooped to any baseness  whereby he could please the self-indulgent monarch by pandering  to his lowest pursuits. The duties of the office of Vazir were  delegated by Shujaa to his son Saadat Ali, who afterwards  succeeded him as Nawab of Audh.    Fallen as the Emperor truly was, and sincerely as we may  sympathize with his desire to raise the fortunes of his life, it  might have been well for him to have remained content with the  humble but guaranteed position of a protected Titular, rather  than listen to the interested advice of those who ministered, for  their own purposes, to his natural discontent.    In this chapter I have been partly referring to Mill. Not only is  that indefatigable historian on his strongest ground when  describing battles and negotiations of the British from civil and  military despatches recorded at the India House, but in treating  of the movements of the native powers he has had access to a  translation of the very best native work upon the subject  the  Siar-ul-mutakharin  which was written by Ghulam Hossain Khan, a  Musalman gentleman of Patna, himself an eye-witness of many of  the scenes described. His account of the capture of Law, for  example, given at length in a foot-note to Mill's short account  of the action of Gaya after which the affair occurred, is full of  truthfulness and local colour.    Since, however, the events were already amply detailed, and the  best authorities exhausted in a standard work accessible to most  English readers; and since, moreover, they did not occur in  Hindustan, and only indirectly pertained to the history of that  country, I have not thought it necessary to relate them more  minutely than was required to elucidate the circumstances which  led to the Emperor Shah Alam becoming, for the first time, a  pensioner on British bounty, or a dependent on British policy.    Those who require a complete account of the military part of the  affair will find it admirably given in Broome's Bengal Army, a  work of which it is to be regretted that the first volume alone  has hitherto been made public. Of the value of this book it would  be difficult to speak too highly. Coming from the pen of an  accomplished professional man, it sets forth, in a manner no  civilian could hope to rival, the early exploits of that army of  which the author was a member. It may be well to note, in  concluding this chapter, what appears to have been at this time  the legal relation of the British settlers in Bengal towards the  Government of the Empire. In 1678 the Company's Agents had  obtained a patent conferring upon them the power of trading in  Bengal. In 1696 they purchased from the Nawab the land  surrounding their factory, and proceeded to protect it by rude  fortifications. A number of natives soon began to settle here  under the protection of the British; and when the Nawab, on this  account, was desirous of sending a judicial officer to reside  among them, the factors staved off the measure by means of a  donation in money. The grant of land and permission of a formal  kind for the fortifications followed in 1716 on Mr. Hamilton's  cure of the Emperor Farokhsiar. During all this period tribute  continued to be paid (nominally at least) to the Emperor; but in  1759, by espousing, as stated in the beginning of this chapter,  the cause of Mir Jafar, the British committed acts of open  rebellion against the Sovereign. By the treaty of Benares,  however, they returned to their nominal allegiance, and became  once more subjects, tenants and even subordinate officials of the  Great Moghul ( Vide Judgment of Lord Brougham in the case of the  Mayor of Lyons v. East India Company). Elphinstone (Rise of Brit.  Power, 438ÄÄ) finds this \"treaty difficult to explain.\" But the  fact is that all the contemporaneous powers concerned looked upon  the Empire as the legitimate source of authority; and not only  then but for many years after. The British had no legal status  until they received the Emperor's grant; and to think of the  arrangement as \"a treaty\" may be a source of misapprehension.        CHAPTER II.    A.D. 1765-71.        Najib-ud-daulah and Jawan Bakht  The Jats  Bhartpur State   Suraj Mal  Najib attacks Jats  Negotiations  Death of Suraj  Mal  Jats attack Jaipur  Return of the Mahrattas  They attack  Bhartpur  Rohillas yield  Death of Najib  State of Rohilkand   Zabita Khan  Mahrattas invite Emperor to return to Dehli.        AT the conclusion of Part I. we saw that the Abdali ruler of  Kabul had returned to his own land, soon after the battle of  Panipat, in 1761, having recognized the legitimate claims of the  exiled heir to the throne (1764), and placed that prince's eldest  son, Mirza Jawan Bakht, in the nominal charge of affairs, under  the protection of Najib-ud-daulah, the Rohilla (Indian Afghan). A  better choice could not have been made in either case. The young  regent was prudent and virtuous, as was usual with the men of his  august house during their earlier years, and the premier noble  was a man of rare intelligence and integrity. Being on good terms  with his old patrons, Dundi Khan Rohilla, and the Nawab of Audh,  Shujaa-ud-daulah, and maintaining a constant understanding with  Malhar Rao Holkar, whom we have seen deserting the cause of his  countrymen, and thus exempted from their general ruin at Panipat,  Najib-ud-daulah swayed the affairs of the dwindled empire with  deserved credit and success. The Mahratta collectors were  expelled from the districts of the Doab, while Agra admitted a  Jat garrison; nor did the discomfited freebooters of the southern  confederacy make any farther appearance in Hindustan for eight  years, if we except the share borne by Malhar Rao, acting on his  own account in the disastrous campaign against the British in  1765.    The area on which these exertions were made was at first but  small, and the lands directly swayed by Najib-ud-daulah were  bounded, within 100 miles south of the capital, by the  possessions of the Jats, who, however, were at the time friendly.    Of the rise of this singular people few authentic records appear  to exist. It is, however, probable that they represent a later  wave of that race, whether true Sudras, or a later wave of  immigrants from Central Asia, which is found"]]]
