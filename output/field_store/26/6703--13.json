An' Belllounds made it plain I was to take orders  from him an' not from his son.\"    \"Thet'll make your job a million times easier,\" declared Lem, as if to  make up for former hasty pessimism. He led the way past some log cabins,  and sheds with dirt roofs, and low, flat-topped barns, out across  another brook where willow-trees were turning yellow. Then the new cabin  came into view. It was small, with one door and one window, and a porch  across the front. It stood on a small elevation, near the swift brook,  and overlooking the ranch-house perhaps a quarter of a mile below. Above  it, and across the brook, had been built a high fence constructed of  aspen poles laced closely together. The sounds therefrom proclaimed this  stockade to be the dog-pen.    Lem helped Wade unpack and carry his outfit into the cabin. It contained  one room, the corner of which was filled with blocks and slabs of pine,  evidently left there after the construction of the cabin, and meant for  fire-wood. The ample size of the stone fireplace attested to the  severity of the winters.    \"Real sawed boards on the floor!\" exclaimed Lem, meaning to impress the  new-comer. \"I call this a plumb good bunk.\"    \"Much too good for me,\" replied Wade.    \"Wal, I'll look after your hosses,\" said Lem. \"I reckon you'll fix up  your bunk. Take my hunch an' ask Miss Collie to find you some furniture  an' sich like. She's Ole Bill's daughter, an' she makes up  fer--fer--wal, fer a lot we hev to stand. I'll fetch the boys  over later.\"    \"Do you smoke?\" asked Wade. \"I've somethin' fine I fetched up from  Leadville.\"    \"Smoke! Me? I'll give you a hoss right now for a cigar. I git one onct a  year, mebbe.\"    \"Here's a box I've been packin' for long,\" replied Wade, as he handed it  up to Billings. \"They're Spanish, all right. Too rich for my blood!\"    A box of gold could not have made that cowboy's eyes shine any brighter.    \"_Whoop-ee!_\" he yelled. \"Why, man, you're like the fairy in the kid's  story! Won't I make the outfit wild? Aw, I forgot. Thar's only Jim an'  Blud left. Wal, I'll divvy with them. Sure, Wade, you hit me right. I  was dyin' fer a real smoke. An' I reckon what's mine is yours.\"    Then he strode out of the cabin, whistling a merry cowboy tune.    Wade was left sitting in the middle of the room on his roll of bedding,  and for a long time he remained there motionless, with his head bent,  his worn hands idly clasped. A heavy footfall outside aroused him from  his meditation.    \"Hey, Wade!\" called the cheery voice of Belllounds. Then the rancher  appeared at the door. \"How's this bunk suit you?\"    \"Much too fine for an old-timer like me,\" replied Wade.    \"Old-timer! Say, you're young yet. Look at me. Sixty-eight last  birthday! Wal, every dog has his day.... What're you needin' to fix this  bunk comfortable like?\"    \"Reckon I don't need much.\"    \"Wal, you've beddin' an' cook outfit. Go get a table, an' a chair an' a  bench from thet first cabin. The boys thet had it are gone. Somethin'  with a back to it, a rockin'-chair, if there's one. You'll find tools,  an' boxes, an' stuff in the workshop, if you want to make a cupboard or  anythin'.\"    \"How about a lookin'-glass?\" asked Wade. \"I had a piece, but I broke  it.\"    \"Haw! Haw! Mebbe we can rustle thet, too. My girl's good on helpin' the  boys fix up. Woman-like, you know. An' she'll fetch you some decorations  on her own hook. Now let's take a look at the hounds.\"    Belllounds led the way out toward the crude dog-corral, and the way he  leaped the brook bore witness to the fact that he was still vigorous and  spry. The door of the pen was made of boards hung on wire. As Belllounds  opened it there came a pattering rush of many padded feet, and a chorus  of barks and whines. Wade's surprised gaze took in forty or fifty dogs,  mostly hounds, browns and blacks and yellows, all sizes--a motley,  mangy, hungry pack, if he had ever seen one.    \"I swore I'd buy every hound fetched to me, till I'd cleaned up the  varmints around White Slides. An' sure I was imposed on,\" explained  the rancher.    \"Some good-lookin' hounds in the bunch,\" replied Wade. \"An' there's  hardly too many. I'll train two packs, so I can rest one when the  other's huntin'.\"    \"Wal, I'll be dog-goned!\" ejaculated Belllounds, with relief. \"I sure  thought you'd roar. All this rabble to take care of!\"    \"No trouble after I've got acquainted,\" said Wade. \"Have they been  hunted any?\"    \"Some of the boys took out a bunch. But they split on deer tracks an'  elk tracks an' Lord knows what all. Never put up a lion! Then again  Billings took some out after a pack of coyotes, an' gol darn me if the  coyotes didn't lick the hounds. An' wuss! Jack, my son, got it into his  head thet he was a hunter. The other mornin' he found a fresh lion track  back of the corral. An' he ups an' puts the whole pack of hounds on the  trail. I had a good many more hounds in the pack than you see now. Wal,  anyway, it was great to hear the noise thet pack made. Jack lost every  blamed hound of them. Thet night an' next day an' the followin' they  straggled in. But twenty some never did come back.\"    Wade laughed. \"They may come yet. I reckon, though, they've gone home  where they came from. Are any of these hounds recommended?\"    \"Every consarned one of them,\" declared Belllounds.    \"That's funny. But I guess it's natural. Do you know for sure whether  you bought any good dogs?\"    \"Yes, I gave fifty dollars for two hounds. Got them of a friend in  Middle Park whose pack killed off the lions there. They're good dogs,  trained on lion, wolf, an' bear.\"    \"Pick 'em out,\" said Wade.    With a throng of canines crowding and fawning round him, and snapping at  one another, it was difficult for the rancher to draw the two particular  ones apart so they could be looked over. At length he succeeded, and  Wade drove back the rest of the pack.    \"The big fellar's Sampson an' the other's Jim,\" said Belllounds.    Sampson was a huge hound, gray and yellow, with mottled black marks,  very long ears, and big, solemn eyes. Jim, a good-sized dog, but small  in comparison with the other, was black all over, except around the nose  and eyes. Jim had many scars. He was old, yet not past a vigorous age,  and he seemed a quiet, dignified, wise hound, quite out of his element  in that mongrel pack.    \"If they're as good as they look we're lucky,\" said Wade, as he tied the  ends of his rope round their necks. \"Now are there any more you know  are good?\"    \"Denver, come hyar!\" yelled Belllounds. A white, yellow-spotted hound  came wagging his tail. \"I'll swear by Denver. An' there's one  more--Kane. He's half bloodhound, a queer, wicked kind of dog. He keeps  to himself.... Kane! Come hyar!\"    Belllounds tramped around the corral, and finally found the hound in  question, asleep in a dusty hole. Kane was the only beautiful dog in the  lot. If half of him was bloodhound the other half was shepherd, for his  black and brown hair was inclined to curl, and his head had the fine  thoroughbred contour of the shepherd. His ears, long and drooping and  thin, betrayed the hound in him. Kane showed no disposition to be  friendly. His dark eyes, sad and mournful, burned with the fires  of doubt.    Wade haltered Kane, Jim, and Sampson, which act almost precipitated a  fight, and led them out of the corral. Denver, friendly and glad,  followed at the rancher's heels.    \"I'll keep them with me an' make lead dogs out of them,\" said Wade.  \"Belllounds, that bunch hasn't had enough to eat. They're half starved.\"    \"Wal, thet's worried me more'n you'll guess,\" declared Belllounds, with  irritation. \"What do a lot of cow-punchin' fellars know about dogs? Why,  they nearly ate Bludsoe up. He wouldn't feed 'em. An' Wils, who seemed  good with dogs, was taken off bad hurt the other day. Lem's been tryin'  to rustle feed fer them. Now we'll give back the dogs you don't want to  keep, an' thet way thin out the pack.\"    \"Yes, we won't need `em all. An' I reckon I'll take the worry of this  dog-pack off your mind.\"    \"Thet's your job, Wade. My orders are fer you to kill off the varmints.  Lions, wolves, coyotes. An' every fall some ole silvertip gits bad, an'  now an' then other bears. Whatever you need in the way of supplies jest  ask fer. We send regular to Kremmlin'. You can hunt fer two months yet,  barrin' an onusual early winter.... I'm askin' you--if my son tramps on  your toes--I'd take it as a favor fer you to be patient. He's only a boy  yet, an' coltish.\"    Wade divined that was a favor difficult for Belllounds to ask. The old  rancher, dominant and forceful and self-sufficient all his days, had  begun to feel an encroachment of opposition beyond his control. If he  but realized it, the favor he asked of Wade was an appeal.    \"Belllounds, I get along with everybody,\" Wade assured him. \"An' maybe I  can help your son. Before I'd reached here I'd heard he was wild, an' so  I'm prepared.\"    \"If you'd do thet--wal, I'd never forgit it,\" replied the rancher,  slowly. \"Jack's been away fer three years. Only got back a week or so  ago. I calkilated he'd be sobered, steadied, by--thet--thet work I put  him to. But I'm not sure. He's changed. When he gits his own way he's  all I could ask. But thet way he wants ain't always what it ought to be.  An' so thar's been clashes. But Jack's a fine young man. An' he'll  outgrow his temper an' crazy notions. Work'll do it.\"    \"Boys will be boys,\" replied Wade, philosophically. \"I've not forgotten  when I was a boy.\"    \"Neither hev I. Wal, I'll be goin', Wade. I reckon Columbine will be up  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13941"],[0,"The Divine Right of Church Government (#14)"],[1,"  \"Gave commandments to the apostles,\" Acts i. 2. \"There is one Lawgiver,  who is able to save and to destroy,\" James iv. 12. \"The Lord is our  judge, the Lord is our lawgiver,\" (or statute-maker,) \"the Lord is our  king,\" Isa. xxxiii. 22.    2.

Yea, assemblies of the Church  are to be in Christ's name: \"Where two or three are gathered together in  my name,\" Matt, xviii. 20.          CHAPTER VI.    _Of the Special Kind, or Peculiar Nature of this Power and Authority._      Having viewed what is the rule of this authority, viz. the holy  Scriptures, and what is the fountain of this authority, viz. Jesus  Christ our Mediator; now consider the special kind or peculiar nature of  this authority, which the description lays down in two several  expressions, viz: 1. It is a spiritual power or authority. 2. It is a  derived power, &c.    1. The power or authority of church government is a spiritual power.  Spiritual, not so perfectly and completely as Christ's supreme  government is spiritual, who alone hath absolute and immediate power and  authority over the very spirits and consciences of men; ruling them by  the invisible influence of his Spirit and grace as he pleaseth, John  iii. 8; Rom. viii. 14; Gal. ii. 20: but so purely, properly, and merely  spiritual is this power, that it really, essentially, and specifically  differs, and is contradistinct from that power which is properly civil,  worldly, and political, in the hand of the political magistrate. Now,  that this power of church government is in this sense properly, purely,  merely spiritual: and that by divine right may be evidenced many ways  according to Scripture; forasmuch as the rule, fountain, matter, form,  subject, object, end, and the all of this power, is only spiritual.    1. Spiritual in the rule, revealing and regulating it, viz. not any  principles of state policy, parliament rolls, any human statutes, laws,  ordinances, edicts, decrees, traditions, or precepts of men whatsoever,  according to which cities, provinces, kingdoms, empires, may be happily  governed: but the holy Scriptures, that perfect divine canon, wherein  the Lord Christ hath revealed sufficiently how his own house, his  Church, shall be ruled, 1 Tim. iii. 14, 15; and all his ordinances,  word, sacraments, censures, &c., shall therein be dispensed, 2 Tim. iii.  16, 17. (See chap. IV.) Now this Scripture is divinely breathed, or  inspired of God--holy men writing not according to the fallible will of  man, but the infallible acting of the Holy Ghost, 2 Tim. iii. 16, with 2  Pet. i. 20, 21.    2. Spiritual in the fountain or author of this power, whence it  originally flows; it being derived, not from any magistrate, prince, or  potentate in the world, not from any man on earth, or the will of man;  but only from Jesus Christ our Mediator, himself being the sole or first  receptacle of all power from the Father, Matt. xxviii. 18; John v. 22:  and consequently, the very fountain of all power and authority to his  Church, Matt. xxviii. 18-20, with John xx. 21, 23; Matt. xvi. 19, and  xviii. 18-20; 2 Cor. x. 8. See this formerly cleared, chap. III. and V.    3. Spiritual in the matter of it, and the several parts of this power:  therefore called the _keys of the kingdom of heaven_, not the keys of  the kingdoms of earth, Matt. xvi. 19, (as Christ professed his _kingdom  was not of this world_, John xviii. 36; and when one requested of  Christ, that by his authority he would speak to his brother to divide  the inheritance with him, Christ disclaimed utterly all such worldly,  earthly power, saying, \"Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?\"  Luke xii. 13, 14.) Consider these heavenly spiritual keys in the kinds  of them, whether of doctrine or discipline; or in the acts of them,  whether of binding or loosing, in all which they are spiritual: e.g. the  doctrine which is preached is not human but divine, revealed in the  Scriptures by the Spirit of God, and handling most sublime spiritual  mysteries of religion, 2 Pet. i.; 2 Tim. iii. 16,17. The seals  administered are not worldly seals, confirming and ratifying any carnal  privileges, liberties, interests, authority, &c., but spiritual,  _sealing the righteousness of faith_, Rom. iv. 11; the death and blood  of Jesus Christ, with all the spiritual virtue and efficacy thereof unto  his members, Rom. v. 6; Gal. iii.; 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, and xi. 23, 24, &c.  The censures dispensed are not pecuniary, corporal, or capital, by  fines, confiscations, imprisonments, whippings, stocking, stigmatizing,  or taking away of limb or life, (all such things this government meddles  not withal, but leaves them to such as bear the civil sword,) but  spiritual, that only concern the soul and conscience; as _admonishing_  of the unruly and disorderly, Matt, xviii. 18, 19; _casting out the  incorrigible_ and obstinate from the spiritual fellowship of the saints,  Matt. xviii. 18, 19; 2 Cor. v. ult.: _receiving again into spiritual  communion_ of the faithful, such as are penitent, 2 Cor. ii. 6. Thus the  binding and loosing, which are counted the chief acts of the keys, are  spiritually by our Saviour interpreted to be the _remitting and  retaining of sins_; compare Matt, xviii. 18, 19, with John xx. 21, 23.    4. Spiritual in the form and manner, as well as in the matter. For this  power is to be exercised, not in a natural manner, or in any carnal  name, of earthly magistrate, court, parliament, prince, or potentate  whatsoever, as all secular civil power is; no, nor in the name of  saints, ministers, or the churches: but in a spiritual manner, in the  name of the Lord Jesus, from whom alone all his officers receive their  commissions. The word is to be _preached in his name_, Acts xvii. 18:  seals dispensed in his name, Matt. xxviii. 19; Acts xix. 5: censures  inflicted in his name, 1 Cor. v. 4, &c. (See chap. V.)    5. Spiritual in the subject intrusted with this power; which is not any  civil, political, or secular magistrate, (as after will more fully  appear, in chap. IX.) but spiritual officers, which Christ himself hath  instituted and bestowed upon his Church, _apostles_, &c., _pastors,  teachers, elders_, Eph. iv. 7, 8, 10, 11. To these only he hath given  the _keys of the kingdom of heaven_, Matt. xvi. 19, and xviii. 18,19,  and xxviii. 18, 19; John xx. 21-23; 2 Cor. x. 8, _authority which the  Lord hath given us_. These he hath made _governments in his Church_, 1  Cor. xii. 28. To these he will have _obedience and subjection_  performed, Heb. xiii. 17, and _double honor_ allowed, 1 Tim. v. 17.    6. Spiritual in respect of the object about which this power is to be  put forth and exercised, viz. not about things, actions, or persons  civil, as such; but spiritual and ecclesiastical, as such. Thus  injurious actions, not as trespasses against any statute or law  political; but as scandalous to our brethren, or the Church of God,  Matt, xviii. 18, 19; are considered and punished by this power. Thus the  incestuous person was cast out, because a wicked person in himself, and  likely to leaven others by his bad example, 1 Cor. v. 6. Thus the  persons whom the Church may judge are not the men of the world without  the Church, but those that are in some sense spiritual, and within the  Church, 1 Cor. v. 12.    7. Spiritual also is this power in the scope and end of it. This the  Scripture frequently inculcates: e.g. a brother is to be admonished  privately, publicly, &c., not for the gaining of our private interests,  advantages, &c., but for _the gaining of our brother_, that his soul and  conscience may be gained to God and to his duty, and he be reformed,  Matt, xviii. 15. The incestuous person is to be \"delivered to Satan, for  the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of  our Lord Jesus,\" 1 Cor. v. 5; yea, the whole authority given to church  guides from the Lord was given to this end, _for the edification, not  the destruction_ of the Church, 2 Cor. x. 8, and xiii. 10; all which,  and such like, are spiritual ends. Thus the power of church government  here described is wholly and entirely a spiritual power, whether we  respect the rule, root, matter, form, subject, object, or end thereof.  So that in this respect it is really and specifically distinct from all  civil power, and in no respect encroacheth upon, or can be prejudicial  unto the magistrate's authority, which is properly and only political.    2. The power or authority of church government is a derived power. For  clearing this, observe, there is a magisterial primitive supreme power,  which is peculiar to Jesus Christ our Mediator, (as hath been proved,  chap. III. and V:)"]]]
