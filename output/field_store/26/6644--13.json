The crowds were so great, and the days so crowded, that Jesus' very eating  was interfered with. His friends remonstrate, and even think Him unduly  swayed by holy enthusiasm. But it is a man come down from Jerusalem who  spread freely among the crowds the ugly charge that He was in league with  the devil, possessed by an _unclean_ spirit, and that that explained His  strange power. No uglier charge could be made. It reveals keenly the  desperate purpose of the Jerusalem leaders. Clearly it was made to  influence the crowds. They were panic-stricken over these crowds. What  could He not do with such a backing, if He chose! Such a rumor would  Spread like wildfire. Jesus shows His leadership. He at once calls the  crowds about Him, speaks openly of the charge, and refutes it, showing the  evident absurdity of it.    Then a strange occurrence takes place. While He is teaching a great crowd  one day, there is an interruption in the midst of His speaking Oddly, it  comes from His mother and her other sons. They send in a message asking  to see Him at once. This seems very strange. It would seem probable from  the narrative that they had access to Him constantly. Why this sudden  desire by the one closest to Him by natural ties to break into His very  speaking for a special interview? Had these Jerusalem men been working  upon the fears of her mother heart for the safety of her Son? She would  use her influence to save Him from possible danger threatening? There is  much in the incident to give color to such a supposition. Perhaps a man of  such fineness as He could be checked back by consideration for His  mother's feelings. They were quite capable of pulling any wire to shut Him  up, however ignorant they showed themselves of the simple sturdiness of  true character. But the same man who so tenderly provides for His mother  in the awful pain of hanging on a cross reminds her now that a divine  errand is not to be hindered by nature's ties; that clear vision of duty  must ever hold the reins of the heart.    Then comes the most terrible, and most significant event, up to this time,  in the whole gospel narrative--the murder of John. This marks the sharpest  crisis yet reached. For a year or so John had been kept shut up in a  prison dungeon, evidence of his own faithfulness, and of the low moral  tone, or absence of moral tone, of the time. Then one night there is a  prolonged, debased debauchery in a magnificent palace; the cunning, cruel  scheme of the woman whose wrong relation to Herod John had honestly  condemned. The dancing young princess, the drunken oath, the terrible  request, the glowing-coal eyes closed, the tongue that held crowds with  its message of sin, and of the coming One stilled, the King's herald  headless--the whole horrible, nightmare story comes with the swiftness of  aroused passion, the suddenness of a lightning flash, the cold cruelty of  indulged lust.    Instantly on getting the news Jesus \"_withdrew_\"--for the third time  withdrew to a retired desert place. This had tremendous personal meaning  for Him. Nothing has occurred thus far that spells out for Him the coming  tragic close so large, so terribly large, as does this. He stays away from  the Passover Feast occurring at this time, the only one of the four of His  public career He failed to attend.        <u>The Murderous Rejection.</u>      This crisis leads at once into the final stage, _the murderous rejection_.  Jesus is now a fugitive from the province of Judea, because the death plot  has been deliberately settled upon. The southern leaders begin a more  vigorous campaign of harrying Him up in Galilee. A fresh deputation of  Pharisees come up from Jerusalem to press the fighting. They at once bring  a charge against Jesus' disciples of being untrue to the time-honored  traditions of the national religion. Yet it is found to be regarding such  trivial things as washing their hands and arms clear up to the elbows each  time before eating, and of washing of cups and pots and the like. Jesus  sharply calls attention to their hypocrisy and cant, by speaking of their  dishonoring teachings and practices in matters of serious moment. Then He  calls the crowd together and talks on the importance of being clean  _inside_, in the heart and thought. Before all the crowds He calls them  hypocrites. It's a sharp clash and break. Jesus at once \"withdrew.\" It is  the fourth time that significant danger word is used. This time His  withdrawal is clear out of the Jewish territory, far up north to the  vicinity of Tyre and Sidon, on the seacoast, and there He attempts to  remain unknown.    After a bit He returns again, this time by a round-about way, to the Sea  of Galilee. Quickly the crowds find out His presence and come; and again  many a life and many a home are utterly changed by His touch. With the  crowd come the Pharisees, this time in partnership with another group, the  Sadducees, whom they did not love especially. They hypocritically beg a  sign from heaven, as though eager to follow a divinely sent messenger. But  He quickly discerns their purpose to _tempt_ Him into something that can  be used against Him. The sign is refused. Jesus never used His power to  show that He could, but only to help somebody.    The fall of that year found Him boldly returning to the danger zone of  Jerusalem for attendance on the harvest-home festival called by them the  Feast of Tabernacles. It was the most largely attended of the three annual  gatherings, attracting thousands of faithful Jews from all parts of the  world. The one topic of talk among the crowds was Jesus, with varying  opinions expressed; but those favorable to Him were awed by the keen  purpose of the leaders to kill Him. When the festival was in full swing,  one morning, Jesus quietly appears among the temple crowds, and begins  teaching. The leaders tried to arrest Him, but are held back by some  hidden influence, nobody seeming willing to take the lead. Then the clique  of chief priests send officers to arrest Him. But they are so impressed by  His presence and His words, that they come back empty-handed, to the  disgust of their superiors. Great numbers listening believe on Him, but  some of the leaders, mingling in the crowd, stir up discussion so sharp  that with hot passion, and eyes splashing green light, they stoop down and  pick up stones to hurl at Him and end His life at once. It is the first  attempt at personal violence in Jerusalem. But again that strange  restraining power, and Jesus passes out untouched.    As he quietly passes through and out, He stops to give sight to a blind  man. Interestingly enough it occurs on a Sabbath day. Instantly the  leaders seize on this, and have a time of it with the man and his parents  in turn, with this upshot, that the man for his bold confession of faith  in Jesus is shut out from all synagogue privileges, in accordance with a  decision already given out. He becomes an outcast, with all that that  means. It's a fine touch that Jesus hunts up this outcast and gives him a  free entrance into His own circle.    After this feast-visit to Jerusalem, Jesus probably returns to Galilee, as  after previous visits there, and then one day leads His band of disciples  up to the neighborhood of snow-capped Hermon. Here probably occurs the  transfiguration, the purpose of which was to tie up these future leaders  of His, against the events now hurrying on with such swift pace. From this  time begins the preparation of this inner circle for the coming tragedy so  plain to His eyes.    Then begins that memorable last journey from Galilee toward Jerusalem  through the country on the east of the Jordan. With marvellous boldness  and courage He steadfastly set His face toward Jerusalem. The  ever-tightening grip of His purpose is in the set of His face. The fire  burning so intensely within is in His eye as He tramps along the road  alone, with the disciples following, awestruck and filled with wondering  fear. Thirty-five deputations of two each are sent ahead into all the  villages to be visited by Him. What an intense campaigner was Jesus! He  was thoroughly, systematically stumping the whole country for God.    As He approaches nearer to the Jerusalem section the air gets tenser and  hotter. The leaders are constantly harrying His steps, tempting with catch  questions, seeking signs, poisoning the crowds--mosquito warfare! He moves  steadily, calmly on. Some of the keenest things He said flashed out  through the friction of contact with them. A tempting lawyer's question  brings out the beautiful Samaritan parable. The old Sabbath question  provokes a fresh tilt with a synagogue ruler. There is a cunning attempt  by the Pharisees to get Him out of Herod's territory into their own. How  intense the situation grew is graphically told in Luke's words, they  \"began to set themselves vehemently against Him, and to provoke Him to  speak many things; laying wait for Him to catch something out of His  mouth.\"    Though unmoved by the cunning effort of the Pharisees to get Him over from  Herod's jurisdiction into Judea, despite their threatening attitude, the  winter Feast of Dedication finds Him again in Jerusalem walking in one of  the temple areas. Instantly He is surrounded by a group of these Jerusalem  Jews who, with an air of apparent earnest inquiry, keep prodding Him with  the request to be told plainly if He is really the Christ. His patient  reply brings a storm of stones--almost. Held in check for a while by an  invisible power, or by the power of His presence shown under such  circumstances so often, again they attempt to seize His person, and again  He seems invisibly to hold their hands back, as He quietly passes on His  way out of their midst.    Then comes the stupendous raising of Lazarus, which brings faith in Him to  great numbers, and results in the formal official decision of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12814"],[0,"Philippine Folk Tales (#14)"],[1,"the Moro on one side  and the Manobo on the other, have drawn back into scattered homes  in the hills. Here they live in poor dwellings raised high from the  ground. Some even build in trees, their sheltered and secret positions  making them less subject to attack.    They are not a warlike people, and their greatest concern is for the  good will of the numerous spirits who watch over their every act. At  times they gather a little hemp or coffee from the hillside or along  the stream bank and carry it to the coast to exchange for the bright  cloth which they make into gay clothes. But they do not love work,  and the most of their time is spent in resting or attending ceremonies  made to gain the good will of the immortals.    In this country the belief prevails that there are spirits in the  stones, in the baliti trees, in the vines, the cliffs, and even the  caves. And never does a man start on a journey or make a clearing on  the mountain side until he has first besought these spirits not to be  angry with him but to favor him with prosperity and bring good crops.    The greatest of the spirits is Diwata Magbabaya, who is so  awe-inspiring that his name is never mentioned above a whisper. He  lives in the sky in a house made of coins, and there are no windows  in this building, for if men should look upon him they would melt  into water.    About the Gulf of Davao, in the southeastern part of this island,  are a number of small tribes, each differing somewhat from the other  in customs and beliefs. Of these the most influential are the Bagobo  who dwell on the lower slopes of Mt. Apo, the highest peak in the  Philippines. They are very industrious, forging excellent knives,  casting fine articles in brass, and weaving beautiful hemp cloth which  they make into elaborate garments decorated with beads and shell disks.    The men are great warriors, each gaining distinction among his people  according to the number of human lives he has taken. A number of them  dress in dark red suits and peculiar headbands which they are permitted  to wear only after they have taken six lives. Notwithstanding their  bravery in battle, these people fear and have great respect for the  numerous spirits who rule over their lives.    From a great fissure in the side of Mt. Apo, clouds of sulphur fumes  are constantly rising, and it is believed to be in this fissure that  Mandarangan and his wife Darago live--evil beings who look after the  fortunes of the warriors. These spirits are feared and great care  is taken to appease them with offerings, while once a year a human  sacrifice is made to them.    The following tales show something of the beliefs of these and the  neighboring tribes in Mindanao.        How the Moon and the Stars Came to Be    _Bukidnon_ (_Mindanao_)      One day in the times when the sky was close to the ground a spinster  went out to pound rice. [113] Before she began her work, she took  off the beads from around her neck and the comb from her hair, and  hung them on the sky, which at that time looked like coral rock.    Then she began working, and each time that she raised her pestle into  the air it struck the sky. For some time she pounded the rice, and  then she raised the pestle so high that it struck the sky very hard.    Immediately the sky began to rise, [114] and it went up so far that  she lost her ornaments. Never did they come down, for the comb became  the moon and the beads are the stars that are scattered about.        The Flood Story    _Bukidnon_ (_Mindanao_)      A long time ago there was a very big crab [115] which crawled into  the sea. And when he went in he crowded the water out so that it ran  all over the earth and covered all the land.    Now about one moon before this happened, a wise man had told the people  that they must build a large raft. [116] They did as he commanded and  cut many large trees, until they had enough to make three layers. These  they bound tightly together, and when it was done they fastened the  raft with a long rattan cord to a big pole in the earth.    Soon after this the floods came. White water poured out of the hills,  and the sea rose and covered even the highest mountains. The people  and animals on the raft were safe, but all the others drowned.    When the waters went down and the raft was again on the ground,  it was near their old home, for the rattan cord had held.    But these were the only people left on the whole earth.        Magbangal [117]    _Bukidnon_ (_Mindanao_)      Magbangal was a good hunter, and he often went to a certain hill  where he killed wild pigs for food. One night as it was nearing the  planting season, he sat in his house thinking, and after a long time  he called to his wife. She came to him, and he said:    \"Tomorrow I shall go to the hill and clear the land for our planting,  but I wish you to stay here.\"    \"Oh, let me go with you,\" begged his wife, \"for you have no other  companion.\"    \"No,\" said Magbangal, \"I wish to go alone, and you must stay at home.\"    So finally his wife agreed, and in the morning she arose early to  prepare food for him. When the rice was cooked and the fish ready  she called him to come and eat, but he said:    \"No, I do not want to eat now, but I will return this afternoon and  you must have it ready for me.\"    Then he gathered up his ten hatchets and bolos, [118] a sharpening  stone, and a bamboo tube for water, and started for the hill. Upon  reaching his land he cut some small trees to make a bench. When it  was finished, he sat down on it and said to the bolos, \"You bolos must  sharpen yourselves on the stone.\" And the bolos went to the stone and  were sharpened. Then to the hatchets he said, \"You hatchets must be  sharpened,\" and they also sharpened themselves.    When all were ready, he said: \"Now you bolos cut all the small brush  under the trees, and you hatchets must cut the large trees.\" So the  bolos and the hatchets went to work, and from his place on the bench  Magbangal could see the land being cleared.    Magbangal's wife was at work in their house weaving a skirt, but  when she heard the trees continually falling she stopped to listen  and thought to herself, \"My husband must have found many people to  help him clear our land. When he left here, he was alone, but surely  he cannot cut down the trees so fast. I will see who is helping him.\"    She left the house and walked rapidly toward the field, but as she  drew nearer she proceeded more slowly, and finally stopped behind  a tree. From her hiding-place, she could see her husband asleep on  the bench, and she could also see that the bolos and hatchets were  cutting the trees with no hands to guide them.    \"Oh,\" said she, \"Magbangal is very powerful. Never before have I  seen bolos and hatchets working without hands, and he never told me  of his power.\"    Suddenly she saw her husband jump up, and, seizing a bolo, he cut  off one of his own arms. He awoke and sat up and said:    \"Someone must be looking at me, for one of my arms is cut off.\"    When he saw his wife he knew that she was the cause of his losing  his arm, and as they went home together, he exclaimed:    \"Now I am going away. It is better for me to go to the sky where I  can give the sign to the people when it is time to plant; and you  must go to the water and become a fish.\"    Soon after he went to the sky and became the constellation Magbangal;  and ever since, when the people see these stars appear in the sky,  they know that it is time to plant their rice.        How Children Became Monkeys    _Bukidnon_ (_Mindanao_)      One day a mother took her two children with her when she went to  color cloth. Not far from her home was a mud hole [119] where the  carabao liked to wallow, and to this hole she carried her cloth,  some dye pots, and two shell spoons.    After she had put the cloth into the mud to let it take up the dark  color, she built a fire and put over it a pot containing water and  the leaves used for dyeing. Then she sat down to wait for the water  to boil, while the children played near by.    By and by when she went to stir the leaves with a shell spoon, some  of the water splashed up and burned her hand, so that she jumped and  cried out. This amused the children and their laughter changed them  into monkeys, and the spoons became their tails. [120]    The nails of the monkeys are still black, because while they were  children they had helped their mother dye the cloth.        Bulanawan and Aguio    _Bukidnon_ (_Mindanao_)      Langgona and his wife had twin boys named Bulanawan and Aguio. One  day, when they were about two years old, the mother took Bulanawan to  the field with her when she went to pick cotton. She spread the fiber  she had gathered the day before on the ground to dry near the child,  and while she was getting more a great wind suddenly arose which  wound the cotton around the baby and carried him away. Far away to  a distant land the wind took Bulanawan, and in that place he grew  up. When he was a man, he became a great warrior. [121]    One day while Bulanawan and his wife were walking along the seashore,  they sat down to rest on a large, flat rock, and Bulanawan fell  asleep. Now Aguio, the twin brother of Bulanawan, had become a great  warrior also, and he went on a journey to this distant land, not  knowing that his brother was there. It happened that he was walking  along the seashore in his war-dress  [122] on this same day, and when  he saw the woman sitting on the large, flat rock, he thought her very  beautiful, and he determined to steal her.    As he drew near he asked her to give him some of her husband's  betel-nut to chew, and when she refused he went forward to fight her  husband, not knowing they were brothers. As soon as his wife awakened  him Bulanawan sprang up, seized her, put her in the cuff of his sleeve,  [123] and came forth ready to fight. Aguio grew very angry at this, and  they fought until"]]]
