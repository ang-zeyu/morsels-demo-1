And if the ideas of  reason do not appear in its literal meaning, then they must be  searched out in some inner interpretation. Commenting on the verse in  Genesis (xi. 7), \"Let us confound their language, that they may not  understand one another's speech,\" he says: \"Those who follow the  literal and obvious interpretation think that the origin of the Greek  and barbarian languages is here described; [the contrast between  Greek, on the one hand, and barbarian--in which Hebrew, it seems, is  included--on the other, is remarkable]. I would not find fault with  them, because they also, perhaps, employ right reason, but I would  call on them not to remain content with this, but to follow me to the  metaphorical renderings, considering that the actual words of the holy  oracle are, as it were, shadows of the real bodies, and the powers  which they reflect are the true underlying ideas.\"[114]    Elsewhere he tells a story of the condign punishment which befell a  godless and impious man, perchance a Samaritan Jew, who made mock of  the race of allegorical interpreters, jeering at the idea that the  change of names from Abram to Abraham and from Sarai to Sarah  contained some deep meaning. He soon paid a fitting penalty for his  wicked wit, for on some very trivial pretext he went and hanged  himself. Which was just, says Philo; for such a rascal deserved a  rascal's death.[115] It is noteworthy that the Talmud also lays stress  upon the deep meaning of the patriarch's change of name.[116] \"He who  calls Abraham Abram,\" said Bar Kappara, \"transgresses a positive  command\" [Hebrew: mtsva 'sha]. \"Nay,\" said Rabbi Levi, \"he transgresses  both a positive and a negative command (and commits a double sin).\" Clearly  this was a test-question and an article of faith, possibly because the  letter [Hebrew: h], which was added to the name, was a letter of  mystical import in the opinion of the age. Both the rejection of the  literal and the rejection of the allegorical value of the Bible, Philo  regarded as impious, and he had to struggle against opposite factions  that were one-sided. The true son of the law believes in both [Greek:  to hreton] and [Greek: to en hyponoiais].[117] Seeing that the  Bible was the inspired revelation of God, who is the fountain of all  wisdom and knowledge--this is Philo's cardinal dogma--it is not to be  supposed, on the one hand, that it was silent about the profoundest  ideas of the human mind, or, on the other, that it contained ideas  opposed to right reason and truth. Yet at first sight it seemed to  lack any definite philosophy and to offer anthropomorphic views of  God. Hence the true interpreter must use the actual words of the sage  as metaphors, following the maxim, \"Turn it about and about, because  all is in it, and contemplate it and wax grey over it, for thou canst  have no better rule than this.\"[118] The principle upon which Philo,  Saadia, Maimonides, and in fact the whole line of Jewish philosophical  exegetes have worked, is that the \"words of the law are fruitful and  multiply\"; or, as the Bible phrase runs, \"The Torah which Moses  commanded unto us is the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.\" It  is the separate inheritance of each generation, which each must  cultivate so as to gather therefrom its own fruit.    The Halakah is the outcome of this devotion in one aspect, the  philosophical exegesis in another. In the one case Jewish  jurisprudence and the body of legal tradition, in the other,  philosophical ideas inspired by outer civilization, are attached to  the text of the Bible by ingenious devices of association. The device  is partly a pious fiction, partly a genuine belief; in other words,  the teachers honestly thought that there was respectively a hidden  philosophical meaning in the Bible and an oral tradition,  supplementary to the written law and arising out of it; but on the  other hand they would not have urged that their particular  interpretation alone was portended by the Scriptures. This is shown in  the Talmud by the fact that different rabbis deduced the same lessons  from different verses, and contrary laws from the same verse; in Philo  by the fact that he often gives various interpretations of one text in  different parts of his work. All that was claimed was that knowledge  and truth must be primarily referred to the Divine revelation, and all  law and practice to the authority of the Mosaic code. Philo, then, in  the same way as the rabbis, deduces all his teaching from the Bible,  not because he holds that it was explicitly contained there, but  because he desires to give to his philosophical notions Divine  authority. Like the rabbis, again, he suggests definite rules of  interpretation which may always be applied [Greek: kanones tes  allegorias].[119] He declares that every name in the Torah has a deep  symbolical meaning, and symbolizes some power.[120] Thus the names of  the sons of Jacob typify each some moral quality, and these qualities  together make the perfect man and the perfect nation. Reuben is \"the  son of insight\" [Hebrew: ru'bn], Simeon is learning [Hebrew: shm'-on],  Judah [Hebrew: yhuda] stands for the praise of God.[121] It may be noted,  by the way, that all these values show traces of Hebrew etymology. Again,  the synonyms in the Bible are to be carefully studied, while even  particles and parts of words have their special value and importance.  And the skilful exegete may for homiletical purposes make slight  changes in a word, following the rabbinical rule,[122] \"Read not so,  but so.\" Thus he plays upon the name Esau, and takes the Hebrew word  as though it were written, not [Hebrew: 'eshaw] but [Hebrew: 'ashav], a  thing made.[123] Whence he shows that Esau represents the sham  (made-up) greatness, which is boastful and insolent and shameless.  Philo is referring perhaps to Apion, the vainglorious anti-Semite,  whom he often covertly attacks. Again, whenever there is repetition in  the text, a deeper meaning is portended. Dealing with the verse,  \"Sarah the wife of Abraham took Hagar the Egyptian\" (Gen. xvi. 3),  Philo comments, that we already knew that Sarah was Abraham's wife:  why, then, does the Bible mention it again? And following certain  values which he has made, he draws the lesson that the study of  philosophy must always go together with the study of general  culture.[124] These examples are not isolated; yet it is rather a  barren science to search for the canons of Philo's allegory, as  Siegfried has done.    For his allegory is a very flexible instrument, which can be employed  at pleasure to deduce anything from anything. And Philo regards these  \"points of construction\" as the excuse, not as the motive, of his  ethical and philosophical teaching. He does not depend on such  devices, for he wanders into allegory more often than not without any  pretext of the kind.    The modern reader may consider the allegorical method artificial and  unconvincing, even if he does not go so far as Spinoza, and say that  it is \"useless, harmful, and absurd.\"[125] We prefer to-day to show  the inner agreement of philosophical with Biblical teaching, rather  than pretend that all philosophy is contained within the Bible; and we  accept the Bible as it stands, as a book of supreme religious worth,  without requiring more of it. But that is mainly a difference of taste  or of method, and in Philo's day, and in fact down to the time of the  sixteenth-century Renaissance, Jew and Gentile alike preferred the  other way. For thought, ancient and mediaeval, was pervaded with the  craving for authority or a plausible show of it. The Bible was not  only the great book of morality, but the standard of truth, that from  which knowledge in all its branches started, and that by which it was  to be judged. As all knowledge came from God, so all knowledge was in  God's Book; and allegory was the method by which the intellectual  conceptions of succeeding ages were attached to it.    The two main heads of Biblical interpretation which the Jewish  religious genius developed, Peshat and Derash,--these represent two  permanent attitudes of mind. In the first the commentator tries to get  at the exact meaning of the text before him, to make its lesson clear  and discuss the circumstances of the composition, the exact relations  of its parts. He is satisfied to take the writer of the Biblical book  for what he says in his own form of utterance. In the second the  commentator is more anxious to inculcate ideas and lessons which do  not arise obviously from the text, and to widen the significance of  what he finds in the Bible. The interpretation ceases to be a mere  exposition; it becomes creative or conciliating thought, and the  interpreter becomes a religious reformer, a philosopher, a prophet. To  this school Philo belongs, and the framework of his teaching or the  ingenuity by which he develops it from his text is of small account.  It is what he teaches and what he considers to be the vital things in  religion and life to which we must pay attention. Judged on this  ground Philo is a supreme master of Derash, and must take a place  among the most creative of the interpreters of the Bible.           *       *       *       *       *          IV    PHILO AND THE TORAH      Over and over again Philo declares that his function is to expound the  law of Moses. Moses was the interpreter of God's word to Israel; and  Philo aspired to be the interpreter of the revelation of Moses to the  Hellenistic world, \"the living voice of the holy law.\" He believed  that Israel was a chosen people in the sense that it had received the  Divine message on behalf of the whole human race,[126] a Kingdom of  Priests, in that it occupied to other nations the position which the  priest--using the word in the fullest sense--occupied to the common  people.[127] The Torah is God's covenant, not only with one small  nation, but with all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14667"],[0,"A Christmas Garland (#14)"],[1,"mpany. Afterwards, in  Wormwood Scrubbs, his Lordship admitted that his estimate of his young  friend had perhaps been pitched too high. In Dartmoor he has since  revoked it altogether, with that manliness for which the Empire so  loved him when he was at large.    Now the young man's name was Dimby--\"Trot\" Dimby--and his mother had  been a Clupton, so that--but had I not already dismissed him? Indeed I  only mentioned him because it seemed that his going to that Inn might  put me on track of that One Great Ultimate and Final True Thing I am  purposed to say about Christmas. Don't ask me yet what that Thing is.  Truth dwells in no man, but is a shy beast you must hunt as you may in  the forests that are round about the Walls of Heaven. And I do hereby  curse, gibbet, and denounce in _execrationem perpetuam atque aeternam_  the man who hunts in a crafty or calculating way--as, lying low,  nosing for scents, squinting for trails, crawling noiselessly till  he shall come near to his quarry and then taking careful aim. Here's  to him who hunts Truth in the honest fashion of men, which is, going  blindly at it, following his first scent (if such there be) or (if  none) none, scrambling over boulders, fording torrents, winding his  horn, plunging into thickets, skipping, firing off his gun in the air  continually, and then ramming in some more ammunition anyhow, with  a laugh and a curse if the charge explode in his own jolly face. The  chances are he will bring home in his bag nothing but a field-mouse  he trod on by accident. Not the less his is the true sport and the  essential stuff of holiness.    As touching Christmas--but there is nothing like verse to clear the  mind, heat the blood, and make very humble the heart. Rouse thee,  Muse!      One Christmas Night in Pontgibaud        (_Pom-pom, rub-a-dub-dub_)    A man with a drum went to and fro        (_Two merry eyes, two cheeks chub_)    Nor not a citril within, without,    But heard the racket and heard the rout    And marvelled what it was all about        (_And who shall shrive Beelzebub?_)      He whacked so hard the drum was split        (_Pom-pom, rub-a-dub-dum_)    Out lept Saint Gabriel from it        (_Praeclarissimus Omnium_)    Who spread his wings and up he went    Nor ever paused in his ascent    Till he had reached the firmament        (_Benedicamus Dominum_).    That's what I shall sing (please God) at dawn to-morrow, standing on  the high, green barrow at Storrington, where the bones of Athelstan's  men are. Yea,      At dawn to-morrow      On Storrington Barrow    I'll beg or borrow      A bow and arrow    And shoot sleek sorrow      Through the marrow.    The floods are out and the ford is narrow,    The stars hang dead and my limbs are lead,      But ale is gold      And there's good foot-hold    On the Cuckfield side of Storrington Barrow.    This too I shall sing, and other songs that are yet to write. In  Pagham I shall sing them again, and again in Little Dewstead. In  Hornside I shall rewrite them, and at the Scythe and Turtle in Liphook  (if I have patience) annotate them. At Selsey they will be very  damnably in the way, and I don't at all know what I shall do with them  at Selsey.    Such then, as I see it, is the whole pith, mystery, outer form, common  acceptation, purpose, usage usual, meaning and inner meaning, beauty  intrinsic and extrinsic, and right character of Christmas Feast.  _Habent urbs atque orbis revelationem._ Pray for my soul.          A STRAIGHT TALK    _By_    G**RGE B*RN*RD SH*W      (_Preface to \"Snt George. A Christmas Play\"_)      When a public man lays his hand on his heart and declares that his  conduct needs no apology, the audience hastens to put up its umbrellas  against the particularly severe downpour of apologies in store for  it. I wont give the customary warning. My conduct shrieks aloud for  apology, and you are in for a thorough drenching.    Flatly, I stole this play. The one valid excuse for the theft would  be mental starvation. That excuse I shant plead. I could have made  a dozen better plays than this out of my own head. You don't suppose  Shakespeare was so vacant in the upper storey that there was nothing  for it but to rummage through cinquecento romances, Townley Mysteries,  and suchlike insanitary rubbishheaps, in order that he might fish out  enough scraps for his artistic fangs to fasten on. Depend on it, there  were plenty of decent original notions seething behind yon marble  brow. Why didn't our William use them? He was too lazy. And so am I.  It is easier to give a new twist to somebody else's story that you  take readymade than to perform that highly-specialised form of skilled  labor which consists in giving artistic coherence to a story that you  have conceived roughly for yourself. A literary gentleman once hoisted  a theory that there are only thirty-six possible stories in the world.  This--I say it with no deference at all--is bosh. There are as many  possible stories in the world as there are microbes in the well-lined  shelves of a literary gentleman's \"den.\" On the other hand, it is  perfectly true that only a baker's dozen of these have got themselves  told. The reason lies in that bland, unalterable resolve to shirk  honest work, by which you recognise the artist as surely as you  recognise the leopard by his spots. In so far as I am an artist, I  am a loafer. And if you expect me, in that line, to do anything but  loaf, you will get the shock your romantic folly deserves. The only  difference between me and my rivals past and present is that I have  the decency to be ashamed of myself. So that if you are not too  bemused and bedevilled by my \"brilliancy\" to kick me downstairs, you  may rely on me to cheerfully lend a foot in the operation. But, while  I have my share of judicial vindictiveness against crime, Im not going  to talk the common judicial cant about brutality making a Better Man  of the criminal. I havent the slightest doubt that I would thieve  again at the earliest opportunity. Meanwhile be so good as to listen  to the evidence on the present charge.    In the December after I was first cast ashore at Holyhead, I had to go  down to Dorsetshire. In those days the more enterprising farm-laborers  used still to annually dress themselves up in order to tickle the  gentry into disbursing the money needed to supplement a local-minimum  wage. They called themselves the Christmas Mummers, and performed  a play entitled Snt George. As my education had been of the typical  Irish kind, and the ideas on which I had been nourished were precisely  the ideas that once in Tara's Hall were regarded as dangerous  novelties, Snt George staggered me with the sense of being suddenly  bumped up against a thing which lay centuries ahead of the time I  had been born into. (Being, in point of fact, only a matter of five  hundred years old, it would have the same effect to-day on the average  London playgoer if it was produced in a west end theatre.) The plot  was simple. It is set forth in Thomas Hardy's \"Return of the Native\";  but, as the people who read my books have no energy left over to cope  with other authors, I must supply an outline of it myself.    Entered, first of all, the English Knight, announcing his  determination to fight and vanquish the Turkish Knight, a vastly  superior swordsman, who promptly made mincemeat of him. After the  Saracen had celebrated his victory in verse, and proclaimed himself  the world's champion, entered Snt George, who, after some preliminary  patriotic flourishes, promptly made mincemeat of the Saracen--to the  blank amazement of an audience which included several retired army  officers. Snt George, however, saved his face by the usual expedient  of the victorious British general, attributing to Providence a result  which by no polite stretch of casuistry could have been traced to the  operations of his own brain. But here the dramatist was confronted  by another difficulty: there being no curtain to ring down, how were  the two corpses to be got gracefully rid of? Entered therefore the  Physician, and brought them both to life. (Any one objecting to this  scene on the score of romantic improbability is hereby referred to  the Royal College of Physicians, or to the directors of any accredited  medical journal, who will hail with delight this opportunity of  proving once and for all that re-vitalisation is the child's-play of  the Faculty.)    Such then is the play that I have stolen. For all the many pleasing  esthetic qualities you will find in it--dramatic inventiveness, humor  and pathos, eloquence, elfin glamor and the like--you must bless  the original author: of these things I have only the usufruct. To  me the play owes nothing but the stiffening of civistic conscience  that has been crammed in. Modest? Not a bit of it. It is my civistic  conscience that makes a man of me and (incidentally) makes this play  a masterpiece.    Nothing could have been easier for me (if I were some  one else) than to perform my task in that  God-rest-you-merry-gentlemen-may-nothing-you-dismay spirit which  so grossly flatters the sensibilities of the average citizen by its  assumption that he is sharp enough to be dismayed by what stares  him in the face. Charles Dickens had lucid intervals in which he was  vaguely conscious of the abuses around him; but his spasmodic efforts  to expose these brought him into contact with realities so agonising  to his highstrung literary nerves that he invariably sank back into  debauches of unsocial optimism. Even the Swan of Avon had his glimpses  of the havoc of displacement wrought by Elizabethan romanticism in the  social machine which had been working with tolerable smoothness under  the prosaic guidance of Henry 8. The time was out of joint; and the  Swan, recognising that he was the last person to ever set it right,  consoled himself by offering the world a soothing doctrine of despair.  Not for me, thank"]]]
