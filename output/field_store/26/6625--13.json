The  Austrian ambassador had orders to leave Berlin; had he done so, war  could not have been avoided. He disobeyed his orders, remained in  Berlin, asked for an interview with the King, and used all his influence  to persuade him to surrender. The Ministry was divided; Radowitz stood  almost alone; the other Ministers, Bismarck's friends, had always  distrusted his policy. They wished to renew the old alliance with  Austria; the Minister of War said they could not risk the struggle; it  was rumoured that he had deliberately avoided making preparations in  order to prevent the King putting himself at the head of the Liberal  party. During the crisis, Bismarck was summoned to the King at  Letzlingen; there can be no doubt what his advice was; eventually the  party of peace prevailed, and Radowitz resigned. Bismarck on hearing the  news danced three times round the table with delight. Brandenburg died  almost immediately after; Manteuffel became Minister-President; he asked  Schwarzenberg for an interview, travelled to Olmuetz to meet him, and an  agreement was come to by which practically Prussia surrendered every  object of dispute between the two great Powers.    The convention of Olmuetz was the most complete humiliation to which any  European State has ever been subjected. Prussia had undertaken a policy,  and with the strong approval of the great majority of the nation had  consistently maintained it for over a year; Austria had required that  this policy should be surrendered; the two States had armed; the  ultimatum had been sent, everything was prepared for war, and then  Prussia surrendered. The cause for this was a double one. It was partly  that Prussia was really not strong enough to meet the coalition of  Austria and Russia, but it was also that the King was really of two  minds; he was constitutionally unable to maintain against danger a  consistent course of policy.    Bismarck was one of the few men who defended the action of the Ministry.  In the ablest of all his speeches he took up the gauntlet, and exposed  all the weakness and the dangers of Radowitz's policy. This was not a  cause in which Prussia should risk its existence. Why should they go to  war in order to subject Prussia not to the Princes but to the Chambers  of the smaller States? A war for the Union would, he said, remind him of  the Englishman who had a fight with the sentry in order that he might  hang himself in the sentry-box, a right which he claimed for himself and  every free Briton. It was the duty of the councillors of the King to  warn him from a policy which would bring the State to destruction.      \"Still I would not shrink, from the war; I would advise it, were    anyone able to prove to me the necessity for it, or to point out    a worthy end which could be attained by it and in no other way.    Why do great States wage war nowadays? The only sound principle    of action for a great State is political egoism and not    Romanticism, and it is unworthy of a great State to fight for any    matter which does not concern its own interests. Shew us,    gentlemen, an object worthy of war and you have my vote. It is    easy for a statesman in his office or his chamber to blow the    trumpet with the breath of popularity and all the time to sit    warming himself by his fireside, while he leaves it to the    rifleman, who lies bleeding on the snow, whether his system    attains victory and glory. Nothing is easier; but woe to the    statesman who at such a time does not look about for a reason for    the war which will be valid when the war is over. I am convinced    you will see the questions which now occupy us in a different    light a year hence, when you look back upon them through a long    perspective of battle-fields and conflagrations, misery and    wretchedness. Will you then have the courage to go to the peasant    by the ashes of his cottage, to the cripple, to the childless    father, and say: 'You have suffered much, but rejoice with us,    the Union is saved. Rejoice with us, Hassenpflug is no longer    Minister, Bayernhofer rules in Hesse.'\"    Eloquent words; but what a strange comment on them his own acts were to  afford. In 1850 Prussia had a clearer and juster cause of war than in  1866; every word of his speech might have been used with equal effect  sixteen years later; the Constitution of 1850 was little different from  that which Bismarck himself was to give to Germany. The policy of  Radowitz was the only true policy for Prussia; if he failed, it was  because Prussia's army was not strong enough; war would have been  followed by defeat and disaster. There was one man who saw the evils as  they really were; the Prince of Prussia determined that if ever he  became King the army of Prussia should be again made strong and  efficient.    It was probably this speech which determined Bismarck's future career.  He had defended the agreement with Austria and identified himself with  the policy of the Government; what more natural than that they should  use him to help to carry out the policy he had upheld. Prussia consented  to recognise the restoration of the Diet; it would be necessary,  therefore, to send an envoy. Now that she had submitted to Austria the  only wise policy was to cultivate her friendship. Who could do this  better than Bismarck? Who had more boldly supported and praised the new  rulers of Austria? When the Gotha party, as they were called, had wished  to exclude Austria from Germany, he it was who said that Austria was no  more a foreign State than Wuertemberg or Bavaria. The appointment of  Bismarck would be the best proof of the loyal intentions of the Prussian  Government.    A few years later he himself gave to Motley the following account of his  appointment:      \"In the summer of 1851,\" Motley writes, \"he told me that the    Minister, Manteuffel, asked him one day abruptly, if he would    accept the post of Ambassador at Frankfort, to which (although    the proposition was as unexpected a one to him as if I should    hear by the next mail that I had been chosen Governor of    Massachusetts) he answered, after a moment's deliberation, 'yes,'    with out another word. The King, the same day, sent for him, and    asked him if he would accept the place, to which he made the same    brief answer, 'Ja.' His Majesty expressed a little surprise that    he made no inquiries or conditions, when Bismarck replied that    anything which the King felt strong enough to propose to him, he    felt strong enough to accept. I only write these details, that    you may have an idea of the man. Strict integrity and courage of    character, a high sense of honour, a firm religious belief,    united with remarkable talents, make up necessarily a combination    which cannot be found any day in any Court; and I have no doubt    that he is destined to be Prime Minister, unless his obstinate    truthfulness, which is apt to be a stumbling-block for    politicians, stands in his way.\"          CHAPTER V.    FRANKFORT.    1851-1857.      Bismarck when he went to Frankfort was thirty-six years of age; he had  had no experience in diplomacy and had long been unaccustomed to the  routine of official life. He had distinguished himself by qualities  which might seem very undiplomatic; as a Parliamentary debater he had  been outspoken in a degree remarkable even during a revolution; he had a  habit of tearing away the veil from those facts which everyone knows and  which all wish to ignore; a careless good-fellowship which promised  little of that reserve and discretion so necessary in a confidential  agent; a personal and wilful independence which might easily lead him  into disagreement with the Ministers and the King. He had not even the  advantage of learning his work by apprenticeship under a more  experienced official; during the first two months at Frankfort he held  the position of First Secretary, but his chief did not attempt to  introduce him to the more important negotiations and when, at the end of  July, he received his definite appointment as envoy, he knew as little  of the work as when he arrived at Frankfort.    He had, however, occupied his time in becoming acquainted with the  social conditions. His first impressions were very unfavourable.  Frankfort held a peculiar position. Though the centre of the German  political system it was less German than any other town in the country.  The society was very cosmopolitan. There were the envoys of the German  States and the foreign Powers, but the diplomatic circle was not graced  by the dignity of a Court nor by the neighbourhood of any great  administrative Power. Side by side with the diplomatists were the  citizens of Frankfort; but here again we find indeed a great  money-market, the centre of the finance of the Continent, dissociated  from any great productive activity. In the neighbourhood were the  watering-places and gambling-tables; Homburg and Wiesbaden, Soden and  Baden-Baden, were within an easy ride or short railway journey, and  Frankfort was constantly visited by all the idle Princes of Germany. It  was a city in which intrigue took the place of statesmanship, and never  has intrigue played so large a part in the history of Europe as during  the years 1850-1870. Half the small States who were represented at  Frankfort had ambitions beyond their powers; they liked to play their  part in the politics of Europe. Too weak to stand alone, they were also  too weak to be quite honest, and attempted to gain by cunning a position  which they could not maintain by other means. This was the city in which  Bismarck was to serve his diplomatic apprenticeship.    Two extracts from letters to his wife give the best picture of his  personal character at this time:      \"On Saturday I drove with Rochow to Ruedesheim; there I took a    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12422"],[0,"Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation: 1838-1839 (#14)"],[1,"eration; and encourage these devotional exercises and  professions of religion, having actually discovered that a man may become  more faithful and trustworthy even as a slave, who acknowledges the  higher influences of Christianity, no matter in how small a degree.  Slave-holding clergymen, and certain piously inclined planters, undertake,  accordingly, to enlighten these poor creatures upon these matters, with a  safe understanding, however, of what truth is to be given to them, and  what is not; how much they may learn to become better slaves, and how  much they may not learn, lest they cease to be slaves at all. The process  is a very ticklish one, and but for the northern public opinion, which is  now pressing the slaveholders close, I dare say would not be attempted at  all. As it is, they are putting their own throats and their own souls in  jeopardy by this very endeavour to serve God and Mammon. The light that  they are letting in between their fingers will presently strike them  blind, and the mighty flood of truth which they are straining through a  sieve to the thirsty lips of their slaves, sweep them away like straws  from their cautious moorings, and overwhelm them in its great deeps, to  the waters of which man may in nowise say, thus far shall ye come and no  farther. The community I now speak of, the white population of Darien,  should be a religious one, to judge by the number of Churches it  maintains. However, we know the old proverb, and, at that rate, it may  not be so godly after all. Mr. ---- and his brother have been called upon  at various times to subscribe to them all; and I saw this morning a most  fervent appeal, extremely ill-spelled, from a gentleman living in the  neighbourhood of the town, and whose slaves are notoriously ill-treated;  reminding Mr. ---- of the precious souls of his human cattle, and  requesting a further donation for the Baptist Church, of which most of  the people here are members. Now this man is known to be a hard master;  his negro houses are sheds, not fit to stable beasts in, his slaves are  ragged, half-naked and miserable--yet he is urgent for their religious  comforts, and writes to Mr. ---- about 'their souls, their precious  souls.' He was over here a few days ago, and pressed me very much to  attend his church. I told him I would not go to a church where the people  who worked for us were parted off from us, as if they had the pest, and  we should catch it of them. I asked him, for I was curious to know, how  they managed to administer the Sacrament to a mixed congregation? He  replied, Oh! very easily; that the white portion of the assembly received  it first, and the blacks afterwards. 'A new commandment I give unto you,  that ye love one another, even as I have loved you.' Oh, what a shocking  mockery! However, they show their faith at all events, in the declaration  that God is no respecter of persons, since they do not pretend to exclude  from His table those whom they most certainly would not admit to their  own.    I have as usual allowed this letter to lie by, dear E----, not in the hope  of the occurrence of any event--for that is hopeless--but until my daily  avocations allowed me leisure to resume it, and afforded me, at the same  time, matter wherewith to do so. I really never was so busy in all my  life, as I am here. I sit at the receipt of custom (involuntarily enough)  from morning till night--no time, no place, affords me a respite from my  innumerable petitioners, and whether I be asleep or awake, reading,  eating, or walking; in the kitchen, my bed-room, or the parlour, they  flock in with urgent entreaties, and pitiful stories, and my conscience  forbids my ever postponing their business for any other matter; for, with  shame and grief of heart I say it, by their unpaid labour I live--their  nakedness clothes me, and their heavy toil maintains me in luxurious  idleness. Surely the least I can do is to hear these, my most injured  benefactors; and, indeed, so intense in me is the sense of the injury they  receive from me and mine, that I should scarce dare refuse them the very  clothes from my back, or food from my plate, if they asked me for it. In  taking my daily walk round the banks yesterday, I found that I was walking  over violet roots. The season is too little advanced for them to be in  bloom, and I could not find out whether they were the fragrant violet or  not.    Mr. ---- has been much gratified to-day by the arrival of Mr. K----, who,  with his father, for nineteen years was the sole manager of these  estates, and discharged his laborious task with great ability and  fidelity towards his employers. How far he understood his duties to the  slaves, or whether indeed an overseer can, in the nature of things,  acknowledge any duty to them, is another question. He is a remarkable man  and is much respected for his integrity and honourable dealing by  everybody here. His activity and energy are wonderful, and the mere fact  of his having charge of for nineteen years, and personally governing,  without any assistance whatever, seven hundred people scattered over  three large tracts of land, at a considerable distance from each other,  certainly bespeaks efficiency and energy of a very uncommon order. The  character I had heard of him from Mr. ---- had excited a great deal of  interest in me, and I was very glad of this opportunity of seeing a man  who, for so many years, had been sovereign over the poor people here. I  met him walking on the banks with Mr. ----, as I returned from my own  ramble, during which nothing occurred or appeared to interest me--except,  by the by, my unexpectedly coming quite close to one of those magnificent  scarlet birds which abound here, and which dart across your path, like a  winged flame. Nothing can surpass the beauty of their plumage, and their  voice is excellently melodious--they are lovely.    My companions, when I do not request the attendance of my friend Jack, are  a couple of little terriers, who are endowed to perfection with the  ugliness and the intelligence of their race--they are of infinite service  on the plantation, as, owing to the immense quantity of grain, and chaff,  and such matters, rats and mice abound in the mills and storehouses. I  crossed the threshing floor to-day--a very large square, perfectly level,  raised by artificial means, about half a foot from the ground, and covered  equally all over, so as to lie quite smooth, with some preparation of tar.  It lies immediately between the house and the steam mill, and on it much  of the negroes' work is done--the first threshing is given to the rice,  and other labours are carried on. As I walked across it to-day, passing  through the busy groups, chiefly of women, that covered it, I came  opposite to one of the drivers, who held in his hand his whip, the odious  insignia of his office. I took it from him; it was a short stick of  moderate size, with a thick square leather thong attached to it. As I held  it in my hand, I did not utter a word; but I conclude, as is often the  case, my face spoke what my tongue did not, for the driver said, 'Oh!  Missis, me use it for measure--me seldom strike nigger with it.' For one  moment I thought I must carry the hateful implement into the house with  me. An instant's reflection, however, served to show me how useless such a  proceeding would be. The people are not mine, nor their drivers, nor their  whips. I should but have impeded, for a few hours, the man's customary  office, and a new scourge would have been easily provided, and I should  have done nothing, perhaps worse than nothing.    After dinner I had a most interesting conversation with Mr. K----. Among  other subjects, he gave me a lively and curious description of the  Yeomanry of Georgia--more properly termed pine-landers. Have you visions  now of well-to-do farmers with comfortable homesteads, decent habits,  industrious, intelligent, cheerful, and thrifty? Such, however, is not the  Yeomanry of Georgia. Labour being here the especial portion of slaves, it  is thenceforth degraded, and considered unworthy of all but slaves. No  white man, therefore, of any class puts hand to work of any kind soever.  This is an exceedingly dignified way of proving their gentility, for the  lazy planters who prefer an idle life of semi-starvation and barbarism to  the degradation of doing anything themselves; but the effect on the poorer  whites of the country is terrible. I speak now of the scattered white  population, who, too poor to possess land or slaves, and having no means  of living in the towns, squat (most appropriately is it so termed) either  on other men's land or government districts--always here swamp or pine  barren--and claim masterdom over the place they invade, till ejected by  the rightful proprietors. These wretched creatures will not, for they are  whites (and labour belongs to blacks and slaves alone here), labour for  their own subsistence. They are hardly protected from the weather by the  rude shelters they frame for themselves in the midst of these dreary  woods. Their food is chiefly supplied by shooting the wild fowl and  venison, and stealing from the cultivated patches of the plantations  nearest at hand. Their clothes hang about them in filthy tatters, and the  combined squalor and fierceness of their appearance is really frightful.    This population is the direct growth of slavery. The planters are loud in  their execrations of these miserable vagabonds; yet they do not see that,  so long as labour is considered the disgraceful portion of slaves, these  free men will hold it nobler to starve or steal than till the earth with  none but the despised blacks for fellow-labourers. The blacks  themselves--such is the infinite power of custom--acquiesce in this  notion, and, as I have told you, consider it the lowest degradation in a  white to use any exertion. I wonder, considering the burthens they"]]]
