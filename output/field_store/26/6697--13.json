Shard lay a course of South by West and they did ten knots that day,  the next day they did seven or eight and Shard hove to. Here he  intended to stop, they had huge supplies of fodder on board for the  oxen, for his men he had a pig or so, plenty of poultry, several sacks  of biscuits and ninety-eight oxen (for two were already eaten), and  they were only twenty miles from water. Here he said they would stay  till folks forgot their past, someone would invent something or some  new thing would turn up to take folks' minds off them and the ships he  had sunk: he forgot that there are men who are well paid to remember.    Half way between him and the oasis he established a little depot where  he buried his water-barrels. As soon as a barrel was empty he sent  half a dozen men to roll it by turns to the depot. This they would do  at night, keeping hid by day, and next night they would push on to the  oasis, fill the barrel and roll it back. Thus only ten miles away he  soon had a store of water, unknown to the thirstiest native of Africa,  from which he could safely replenish his tanks at will. He allowed his  men to sing and even within reason to light fires. Those were jolly  nights while the rum held out; sometimes they saw gazelles watching  them curiously, sometimes a lion went by over the sand, the sound of  his roar added to their sense of the security of their ship; all round  them level, immense lay the Sahara: \"This is better than an English  prison,\" said Captain Shard.    And still the dead calm lasted, not even the sand whispered at night  to little winds; and when the rum gave out and it looked like trouble,  Shard reminded them what little use it had been to them when it was  all they had and the oxen wouldn't look at it.    And the days wore on with singing, and even dancing at times, and at  nights round a cautious fire in a hollow of sand with only one man on  watch they told tales of the sea. It was all a relief after arduous  watches and sleeping by the guns, a rest to strained nerves and eyes;  and all agreed, for all that they missed their rum, that the best  place for a ship like theirs was the land.    This was in Latitude 23 North, Longitude 4 East, where, as I have  said, a ship's broadside was heard for the first time and the last. It  happened this way.    They had been there several weeks and had eaten perhaps ten or a dozen  oxen and all that while there had been no breath of wind and they had  seen no one: when one morning about two bells when the crew were at  breakfast the lookout man reported cavalry on the port side. Shard who  had already surrounded his ship with sharpened stakes ordered all his  men on board, the young trumpeter who prided himself on having picked  up the ways of the land, sounded \"Prepare to receive cavalry\". Shard  sent a few men below with pikes to the lower port-holes, two more  aloft with muskets, the rest to the guns, he changed the \"grape\" or  \"canister\" with which the guns were loaded in case of surprise, for  shot, cleared the decks, drew in ladders, and before the cavalry came  within range everything was ready for them. The oxen were always yoked  in order that Shard could manoeuvre his ship at a moment's notice.    When first sighted the cavalry were trotting but they were coming on  now at a slow canter. Arabs in white robes on good horses. Shard  estimated that there were two or three hundred of them. At sixty yards  Shard opened with one gun, he had had the distance measured, but had  never practised for fear of being heard at the oasis: the shot went  high. The next one fell short and ricochetted over the Arabs' heads.  Shard had the range then and by the time the ten remaining guns of his  broadside were given the same elevation as that of his second gun the  Arabs had come to the spot where the last shot pitched. The broadside  hit the horses, mostly low, and ricochetted on amongst them; one  cannon-ball striking a rock at the horses' feet shattered it and sent  fragments flying amongst the Arabs with the peculiar scream of things  set free by projectiles from their motionless harmless state, and the  cannon-ball went on with them with a great howl, this shot alone  killed three men.    \"Very satisfactory,\" said Shard rubbing his chin. \"Load with grape,\"  he added sharply.    The broadside did not stop the Arabs nor even reduce their speed but  they crowded in closer together as though for company in their time of  danger, which they should not have done. They were four hundred yards  off now, three hundred and fifty; and then the muskets began, for the  two men in the crow's-nest had thirty loaded muskets besides a few  pistols, the muskets all stood round them leaning against the rail;  they picked them up and fired them one by one. Every shot told, but  still the Arabs came on. They were galloping now. It took some time to  load the guns in those days. Three hundred yards, two hundred and  fifty, men dropping all the way, two hundred yards; Old Frank for all  his one ear had terrible eyes; it was pistols now, they had fired all  their muskets; a hundred and fifty; Shard had marked the fifties with  little white stones. Old Frank and Bad Jack up aloft felt pretty  uneasy when they saw the Arabs had come to that little white stone,  they both missed their shots.    \"All ready?\" said Captain Shard.    \"Aye, aye, sir,\" said Smerdrak.    \"Right,\" said Captain Shard raising a finger.    A hundred and fifty yards is a bad range at which to be caught by  grape (or \"case\" as we call it now), the gunners can hardly miss and  the charge has time to spread. Shard estimated afterwards that he got  thirty Arabs by that broadside alone and as many horses.    There were close on two hundred of them still on their horses, yet the  broadside of grape had unsettled them, they surged round the ship but  seemed doubtful what to do. They carried swords and scimitars in their  hands, though most had strange long muskets slung behind them, a few  unslung them and began firing wildly. They could not reach Shard's  merry men with their swords. Had it not been for that broadside that  took them when it did they might have climbed up from their horses and  carried the bad ship by sheer force of numbers, but they would have  had to have been very steady, and the broadside spoiled all that.  Their best course was to have concentrated all their efforts in  setting fire to the ship but this they did not attempt. Part of them  swarmed all round the ship brandishing their swords and looking vainly  for an easy entrance; perhaps they expected a door, they were not  sea-faring people; but their leaders were evidently set on driving off  the oxen not dreaming that the Desperate Lark had other means of  travelling. And this to some extent they succeeded in doing. Thirty  they drove off, cutting the traces, twenty they killed on the spot  with their scimitars though the bow gun caught them twice as they did  their work, and ten more were unluckily killed by Shard's bow gun.  Before they could fire a third time from the bows they all galloped  away, firing back at the oxen with their muskets and killing three  more, and what troubled Shard more than the loss of his oxen was the  way that they manoeuvred, galloping off just when the bow gun was  ready and riding off by the port bow where the broadside could not get  them, which seemed to him to show more knowledge of guns than they  could have learned on that bright morning. What, thought Shard to  himself, if they should bring big guns against the Desperate Lark! And  the mere thought of it made him rail at Fate. But the merry men all  cheered when they rode away. Shard had only twenty-two oxen left, and  then a score or so of the Arabs dismounted while the rest rode further  on leading their horses. And the dismounted men lay down on the port  bow behind some rocks two hundred yards away and began to shoot at the  oxen. Shard had just enough of them left to manoeuvre his ship with an  effort and he turned his ship a few points to the starboard so as to  get a broadside at the rocks. But grape was of no use here as the only  way he could get an Arab was by hitting one of the rocks with shot  behind which an Arab was lying, and the rocks were not easy to hit  except by chance, and as often as he manoeuvred his ship the Arabs  changed their ground. This went on all day while the mounted Arabs  hovered out of range watching what Shard would do; and all the while  the oxen were growing fewer, so good a mark were they, until only ten  were left, and the ship could manoeuvre no longer. But then they all  rode off.    The merry men were delighted, they calculated that one way and another  they had unhorsed a hundred Arabs and on board there had been no more  than one man wounded: Bad Jack had been hit in the wrist; probably by  a bullet meant for the men at the guns, for the Arabs were firing  high. They had captured a horse and had found quaint weapons on the  bodies of the dead Arabs and an interesting kind of tobacco. It was  evening now and they talked over the fight, made jokes about their  luckier shots, smoked their new tobacco and sang; altogether it was  the jolliest evening they'd had. But Shard alone on the quarter-deck  paced to and fro pondering, brooding and wondering. He had chopped off  Bad Jack's wounded hand and given him a hook out of store, for captain  does doctor upon these occasions and Shard, who was ready for most  things, kept half a dozen or so of neat new limbs, and of course a  chopper. Bad Jack had gone below swearing a little and said he'd lie  down for a bit, the men were smoking and singing on the sand, and  Shard was there alone. The thought that troubled Shard was: what would  the Arabs do? They did not look like men to go away for nothing. And  at back of all his thoughts was one that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13831"],[0,"Evolution Of The Japanese, Social And Psychic (#14)"],[1,"progress was  to be made, it could only be through the development of the  individualistic principle to which we give the more exact name  communo-individualism. This problem as to how the \"cake of custom\" is  successfully broken must now engage our attention.    Mr. Bagehot contends that this process consisted, as a matter of  history, in the establishment of government by discussion. Matters of  principle came to be talked over; the desirability of this or that  measure was submitted to the people for their approval or disapproval.  This method served to stimulate definite and practical thought on a  wide scale; it substituted the thinking of the many for the thinking  of the few; it stimulated independent thinking and consequently  independent action. This is, however, but another way of saying that  it stimulated variation. A government whose action was determined  after wide discussion would be peculiarly fitted to take advantage of  all useful variations of ideas and practice. Experience shows, he  continues, that the difficulty of developing a \"cake of custom\" is far  more easily surmounted than that of developing government by  discussion; _i.e._, that it is far less difficult to develop  communalism than communo-individualism. The family of arrested  civilizations, of which China and India and Japan, until recent times,  are examples, were caught in the net of what had once been the source  of their progress. The tyranny of their laws and customs was such that  all individual variations were nipped in the bud. They failed to  progress because they failed to develop variations. And they failed in  this because they did not have government by discussion.    No one will dispute the importance of Mr. Bagehot's, contribution to  this subject. But it may be doubted whether he has pointed out the  full reason for the difficulty of breaking the \"cake of custom\" or  manifested the real root of progress. To attain progress in the full  sense, not merely of an oligarchy or a caste, but of the whole people,  there must not only be government by discussion, but the  responsibilities of the government must be snared more or less fully  by all the governed.    History, however, shows that this cannot take place until a  conception of intrinsic manhood and womanhood has arisen, a conception  which emphasizes their infinite and inherent worth. This conception is  not produced by government by discussion, while government by  discussion is the necessary consequence of the wide acceptance of this  conception. It is therefore the real root of progress.    As I look over the history of the Orient, I find no tendency to  discover the inherent worth of man or to introduce the principle of  government by discussion. Left to themselves, I see no probability  that any of these nations would ever have been able to break the  thrall of their customs, and to reach that stage of development in  which common individuals could be trusted with a large measure of  individual liberty. Though I can conceive that Japan might have  secured a thorough-going political centralization under the old  _regime_, I cannot see that that centralization would have been  accompanied by growing liberty for the individual or by such  constitutional rights for the common man as he enjoys to-day. Whatever  progress she might have made in the direction of nationality it would  still have been a despotism. The common man would have remained a  helpless and hopeless slave. Art might have prospered; the people  might have remained simple-minded and relatively contented. But they  could not have attained that freedom and richness of life, that  personality, which we saw in our last chapter to be the criterion and  goal of true progress.    If the reader judges the above contention correct and agrees with the  writer that the conception of the inherent value of a human being  could not arise spontaneously in Japan, he will conclude that the  progress of Japan depended on securing this important conception from  without. Exactly this has taken place. By her thorough-going  abandonment of the feudal social order and adoption of the  constitutional and representative government of Christendom, whether  she recognizes it or not, she has accepted the principles of the  inherent worth of manhood and womanhood, as well as government by  discussion. Japan has thus, by imitation rather than by origination,  entered on the path of endless progress.    So important, however, is the step recently taken that further  analysis of this method of progress is desirable for its full  comprehension. We have already noted quite briefly[F] how Japan was  supplied by the West with the ideal of national unity and the material  instruments essential to its attainment. In connection with the high  development of the nation as a whole, these two elements of progress,  the ideal and the material, need further consideration.    We note in the first place that both begin with imitation, but if  progress is to be real and lasting, both must grow to independence.    The first and by far the most important is the psychical, the  introduction of new ideas. So long as the old, familiar ideas hold  sway over the mind of a nation, there is little or no stimulus to  comparison and discussion. Stagnation is well-nigh complete. But let  new ideas be so introduced as to compel attention and comprehension,  and the mind spontaneously awakes to wonderful activity. The old  stagnation is no longer possible. Discussion is started; and in the  end something must take place, even if the new ideas are not accepted  wholly or even in part. But they will not gain attention if presented  simply in the abstract, unconnected with real life. They must bring  evidence that, if accepted and lived, they will be of practical use,  that they will give added power to the nation.    Exactly this took place in 1854 when Admiral Perry demanded entrance  to Japan. The people suddenly awoke from their sleep of two and a half  centuries to find that new nations had arisen since they closed their  eyes, nations among which new sets of ideas had been at work, giving  them a power wholly unknown to the Orient and even mysterious to it.  Those ideas were concerned, not alone with the making of guns, the  building of ships, the invention of machinery, the taming and using of  the forces of nature, but also with methods of government and law,  with strange notions, too, about religion and duty, about the family  and the individual, which the foreigners said were of inestimable  value and importance. It needed but a few years of intercourse with  Western peoples to convince the most conservative that unless the  Japanese themselves could gain the secret of their power, either by  adopting their weapons or their civilization, they themselves must  fade away before the stronger nations. The need of self-preservation  was the first great stimulus that drove new thoughts into unwilling  brains.    There can be no doubt that the Japanese were right in this analysis of  the situation. Had they insisted on maintaining their old methods of  national life and social order and ancient customs, there can be no  doubt as to the result. Africa and India in recent decades and China  and Korea in the most recent years tell the story all too clearly.  Those who know the course of treaty conferences and armed collisions,  as at Shimonoseki and Kagoshima between Japan and the foreign nations,  have no doubt that Japan, divided into clans and persisting in her  love of feudalism, would long since have become the territory of some  European Power. She was saved by the possession of a remarkable  combination of national characteristics,--the powers of observation,  of appreciation, and of imitation. In a word, her sensitiveness to her  environment and her readiness to respond to it proved to be her  salvation.    But the point on which I wish to lay special emphasis is that the  prime element of the form in which the deliverance came was through  the acquisition of numerous new ideas. These were presented by persons  who thoroughly believed in them and who admittedly had a power not  possessed by the Japanese themselves. Though unable to originate these  ideas, the Japanese yet proved themselves capable of understanding and  appreciating them--in a measure at least. They were at first attracted  to that which related chiefly to the externals of civilization, to  that which would contribute immediately to the complete political  centralization of the nation. With great rapidity they adopted Western  ideas about warfare and weapons. They sent their young men abroad to  study the civilization of the foreign nations. At great expense they  also employed many foreigners to teach them in their own land the  things they wished to learn. Thus have the Japanese mastered so  rapidly the details of those ideas which, less than fifty years ago,  were not only strange but odious to them.    Under their influence, the conditions which history shows to be the  most conducive to the continuous growth of civilization have been  definitely accepted and adopted by the people, namely, popular rights,  the liberty of individuals to differ from the past so far as this does  not interfere with national unity, and the direct responsibility and  relation of each individual to the nation without any mediating group.  These rights and liberties are secured to the individual by a  constitution and by laws enacted by representative legislatures.  Government by discussion has been fairly inaugurated.    During these years of change the effort has been to leave the old  social order as undisturbed as possible. For example, it was hoped  that the reorganization of the military and naval forces of the Empire  would be sufficient without disturbing the feudal order and without  abolishing the feudal states. But this was soon found ineffectual. For  a time it was likewise thought"]]]
