Journalists in Goa are facing a situation where space  to write the truth is increasingly shrinking; and  editors, including Rajan, have also played their role  in making this happen. At another level, the State is  working overtime to incorporate journalists, promote  'friendly' publications and thus indulge in other means  to control opinion. While Rajan Narayan has undeniably  been one editor who was willing to say the things  others were simply not willing to say, this was done  not very consistently. Quite a few who worked under  Rajan would probably have their own story to tell. It  would really help if the average Goan was less gullible  and didn't judge issues along emotional lines alone.    The plus side also needs to be taken into the equation.    It was Rajan who pointed out to the importance of the  readership of government employees and pensioneers; to  the fact that international news needed to be focussed  on countries which Goa had long links with, or had  large Goan expat populations. He told his staff  something that seems to be beyond the comprehension of  many Goan editors: \"There is also considerable interest  in Portugal. An election is scheduled in Portugal soon.  Let us keep track of the election and other  developments in Portugal.\"    (But one should not get misled into thinking that those  working under Rajan always had clear policy guidelines  to work under. Most of our time at least, policies were  based on whims and fancies, to gauge the rationale of  which often left one bewildered.)    He was also among those to try and shift out of the  protocol reporting -- an attitude which says 'this  report has to be there, because it has to be there' --  that journalism in a Navhind-defined Goa was notorious  for.    But then, implementing this vision was a problem. For  one, Rajan himself didn't consistently follow up on it.  Secondly, he didn't seem to believe in having competent  persons around him and preferred to work with someone  who was less likely to pose a challege in the years to  come. In addition, a considerable time was spent in  politcking, both within the organisation and beyond.    Working under Rajan meant coping with the unpredictable.    In many cases, Rajan didn't quite give other  journalists the impression that they were welcome to  contribute to the Herald. (As an aside, one of those  asked to contribute a chapter in this book, a senior  Goan journalist who has written for a number of  national and international publications, misunderstood  that the invite was to write for the Herald. The journo  simply wrote back a two-liner to declining saying that  apart from the lack of time, \"Rajan won't accept my  name in his paper.\")    In one of my freelance stints there, a curious case  pertained to a curious firm selling matresses at the  price of Rs 60,000 to a 100,000 and more. They claimed  all kinds of near-miraculous properties went along with  the matresses. Concerned citizens drew one's attention  to this issue, and after researching the issue, one  wrote one's report on the issue. Rajan was furious. He  accused this journalist of \"not checking the other side  of the story\". In reality, the firm refused to let  anyone come to their demos, unless they were duly  introduced by someone already caught in the  costly-matress trap. It later turned out that the  persons running the operations in Goa were linked to  the family of the publisher that brought out a magazine  Rajan had earlier worked for! When this issue was  raised during a recent journalist debate, Rajan  side-stepped it by raising the issue of whether one was  a staffer or freelancer while writing for the paper. He  generally confused the issue in some barely-relevant  detail, ignoring the questions of there was a clash of  interest in his role as editor here, as in many other  issues he has faced questions over.    Perhaps the most curious experience for this writer was  the one related to \"Raul Gonsalves\".    Sometime in the late 'nineties, a number of prominent  editors in Goa decided to impose a private 'ban' on the  writings of that abrasive but persistent letter-writer M.K.Jos  . Jos had the style of targetting editors and  journalists, which was obviously earning him  influential enemies. One may not be a fan of Jos, but  clearly a blanket ban on an individual is something  very unbecoming of a supposedly democratic society.  This writer's feature, focussing Jos with his plusses  and minuses, appeared in the weekend magazine section  of Herald, then looked after by Ethel da Costa.  Retribution was quick to come. A long piece was  published, in the same columns which this writer was a  contributor to, trying to drag this writer into a  fictitious controversy. It also sought to give a veiled  'warning' that anyone mentioning Jos could himself lend  in trouble. It later emerged that the article itself  was pseudonymously written by the editor of a rival  newspaper, claiming to be 'Raul Gonsalves'. Editorial  staff of the section confirmed that the contentious  article had been published at the behest of Rajan himself.    It could be argued that if Rajan has built a  larger-than-life image of himself, that has been  premises on the blocking out of a generation of young  journalists, whom he himself ironically had a hand in  creating. Today, Rajan's indespensibility to the Herald  stems from both a perception, not wholly true, that he  single-handedly built the paper, and the fact that  virtually nobody else in the organisation has been  trained or encouraged to write editorials.    To some measure, everyone who shares the above grouse  with this writer must be thankful to Rajan. Being  pushed out of local opportunity has helped many to get  access to wider fields. Today, Goan journalists are  employed in a number of places -- scattered across the  Gulf, to Singapore, Australia, Canada and beyond! Even  for those of us opting to remain back home, the hard  work involving in 'proving oneself' has helped to open  up new doors. Had it not been for such 'push' factors,  this writer would have probably been doing a boring job  just as a deputy news editor in some local newspaper.    Working in a Rajan-headed establishment also can cure  you of ambition. It was simply not worth the heart-burn  and infighting to rise to the level of a humble  chief-sub. This has helped convince this writer that  it's probably worth staying a humble correspondent --  possibly even freelance -- the rest of one's career,  rather than succumb to an ambition that takes  bitterness, rancour, cutthroat competition and so much  energy just to get a post in which one has to act more  as politician or manager rather than an effective  journalist?    Needless to say, on the other hand the younger  generation of journalists can indeed learn from some of  Rajan's good points. In many cases -- though not all --  he would be quick to highlight criticism of himself, in  the paper he headed. His ability to bestow confidence  on his juniors helped some to grow. (But, this was upto  a point. Also, his criticism and barrage of memos  seemed to be more linked to whether he liked someone or  not, rather than one's qualities and abilities to put  in hard work as a journalist.)    As for the writer of this chapter, one carried on  writing... and enjoying it immensely. But for most of  the past 20 years, that has been for an audience  largely outside the Herald. By some quirk of fate, one  managed to leave the Herald exactly after four years,  as planned. (Thanks to statehood, the Deccan Herald  decided to have it's first full-time staff  correspondent in Goa. Work on the news-desk was fast  ceasing to be a challenge, and the politics on the job  also made life difficult, even if the team that worked  there had a good team spirit and a youthful have-fun  attitude towards life.) Also, as planned, one put in a  two-line resignation letter.    As anticipated, my absence there was not viewed as a  loss; anyone who stayed on too long got the feeling he  or she was becoming a liability -- or that the law of  diminishing returns were applying. Whatever may have  been my failings, some of my colleagues pointed to the  fact that this writer was one of the few who had been  around from Day One, and was known for his attempts to  bring out a good product. Paste-up artists would  comment, \"The day you leave, there will be a lot of  disappointment.\" I suffered from no such delusions. In  part, because nobody is indispensible. In greater part,  because one was aware of the attitude of Rajan Narayan  towards anyone who might one-day be competition.    Right I was. When I told Rajan of my decision, he had  just one question in mind: where are you going? On  being told that it was the Deccan Herald, a visible  sign of relief appeared on his brow. Not only was one  not joining the Gomantak Times, then viewed as the  looming-on-the horizon competition, but also another  journo was getting out of the way. Or at least, that  was how one intrepreted it.    Perhaps one was not wrong. Since then, one was at  Deccan Herald for the first seven years, a period  during which staffers were not officially allowed to  write for other publications. But, since 1995, when one  went into full-time freelancing, never did one feel  welcome to write for the Herald, whenever Rajan Narayan  was around. On the contrary, doing this would make one  feel like an encroacher or illegal alien overstaying  his welcome at a place not wanted.    At one stage, Rajan Narayan went for his lengthy  treatment, leaving behind no editorials for the paper.  Having never apparently encouraged anyone to rise to  the task of writing editorials, he apparently often  used this as his bargaining chip (as has happened  recently). Unlike in other papers, where the  middle-level journalists write the editorial, here the  space was very much Rajan's fiefdom. Being into  freelancing, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11533"],[0,"Theocritus, translated into English Verse (#14)"],[1,"smart:      Proof to all speech, all access, seemed her heart.        So he found naught his furnace to allay;        No quiver of lips, no lighting of kind eyes,      Nor rose-flushed cheek; no talk, no lover's play        Was deigned him: but as forest-beasts are shy      Of hound and hunter, with this wight dealt she;      Fierce was her lip, her eyes gleamed ominously.        Her tyrant's-heart was imaged in her face,        That flushed, then altering put on blank disdain.      Yet, even then, her anger had its grace,        And made her lover fall in love again.      At last, unable to endure his flame,      To the fell threshold all in tears he came:        Kissed it, and lifted up his voice and said:        \"O heart of stone, O curst and cruel maid      Unworthy of all love, by lions bred,        See, my last offering at thy feet is laid,      The halter that shall hang me! So no more      For my sake, lady, need thy heart be sore.        Whither thou doom'st me, thither must I fare.        There is a path, that whoso treads hath ease      (Men say) from love; Forgetfulness is there.        But if I drain that chalice to the lees,      I may not quench the love I have for you;      Now at your gates I cast my long adieu.        Your future I foresee. The rose is gay,        And passing-sweet the violet of the spring:      Yet time despoils them, and they soon decay.        The lily droops and dies, that lustrous thing;      The solid-seeming snowdrift melts full fast;      And maiden's bloom is rare, but may not last.        The time shall come, when you shall feel as I;        And, with seared heart, weep many a bitter tear.      But, maiden, grant one farewell courtesy.        When you come forth, and see me hanging here,      E'en at your door, forget not my hard case;      But pause and weep me for a moment's space.        And drop one tear, and cut me down, and spread        O'er me some garment, for a funeral pall,      That wrapped thy limbs: and kiss me--let the dead        Be privileged thus highly--last of all.      You need not fear me: not if your disdain      Changed into fondness could I live again.        And scoop a grave, to hide my loves and me:        And thrice, at parting, say, 'My friend's no more:'      Add if you list, 'a faithful friend was he;'        And write this epitaph, scratched upon your door:      _Stranger, Love slew him. Pass not by, until      Thou hast paused and said, 'His mistress used him ill_.'\"        This said, he grasped a stone: that ghastly stone        At the mid threshold 'neath the wall he laid,      And o'er the beam the light cord soon was thrown,        And his neck noosed. In air the body swayed,      Its footstool spurned away. Forth came once more      The maid, and saw him hanging at her door.        No struggle of heart it cost her, ne'er a tear        She wept o'er that young life, nor shunned to soil,      By contact with the corpse, her woman's-gear.        But on she went to watch the athletes' toil,      Then made for her loved haunt, the riverside:      And there she met the god she had defied.        For on a marble pedestal Eros stood        Fronting the pool: the statue leaped, and smote      And slew that miscreant. All the stream ran blood;        And to the top a girl's cry seemed to float.      Rejoice, O lovers, since the scorner fell;      And, maids, be kind; for Love deals justice well.          IDYLL XXIV.      The Infant Heracles.          Alcmena once had washed and given the breast      To Heracles, a babe of ten months old,      And Iphicles his junior by a night;      And cradled both within a brazen shield,      A gorgeous trophy, which Amphitryon erst      Had stript from Pterelaeus fall'n in fight.      She stroked their baby brows, and thus she said:          \"Sleep, children mine, a light luxurious sleep,      Brother with brother: sleep, my boys, my life:      Blest in your slumber, in your waking blest!\"          She spake and rocked the shield; and in his arms      Sleep took them. But at midnight, when the Bear      Wheels to his setting, in Orion's front      Whose shoulder then beams broadest; Hera sent,      Mistress of wiles, two huge and hideous things,      Snakes with their scales of azure all on end,      To the broad portal of the chamber-door,      All to devour the infant Heracles.      They, all their length uncoiled upon the floor,      Writhed on to their blood-feast; a baleful light      Gleamed in their eyes, rank venom they spat forth.      But when with lambent tongues they neared the cot,      Alcmena's babes (for Zeus was watching all)      Woke, and throughout the chamber there was light.      Then Iphicles--so soon as he descried      The fell brutes peering o'er the hollow shield,      And saw their merciless fangs--cried lustily,      And kicked away his coverlet of down,      Fain to escape. But Heracles, he clung      Round them with warlike hands, in iron grasp      Prisoning the two: his clutch upon their throat,      The deadly snake's laboratory, where      He brews such poisons as e'en heaven abhors.      They twined and twisted round the babe that, born      After long travail, ne'er had shed a tear      E'en in his nursery; soon to quit their hold,      For powerless seemed their spines. Alcmena heard,      While her lord slept, the crying, and awoke.          \"Amphitryon, up: chill fears take hold on me.      Up: stay not to put sandals on thy feet.      Hear'st thou our child, our younger, how he cries?      Seest thou yon walls illumed at dead of night,      But not by morn's pure beam? I know, I know,      Sweet lord, that some strange thing is happening here.\"          She spake; and he, upleaping at her call,      Made swiftly for the sword of quaint device      That aye hung dangling o'er his cedarn couch:      And he was reaching at his span-new belt,      The scabbard (one huge piece of lotus-wood)      Poised on his arm; when suddenly the night      Spread out her hands, and all was dark again.      Then cried he to his slaves, whose sleep was deep:      \"Quick, slaves of mine; fetch fire from yonder hearth:      And force with all your strength the doorbolts back!      Up, loyal-hearted slaves: the master calls.\"          Forth came at once the slaves with lighted lamps.      The house was all astir with hurrying feet.      But when they saw the suckling Heracles      With the two brutes grasped firm in his soft hands,      They shouted with one voice. But he must show      The reptiles to Amphitryon; held aloft      His hands in childish glee, and laughed and laid      At his sire's feet the monsters still in death.          Then did Alcmena to her bosom take      The terror-blanched and passionate Iphicles:      Cradling the other in a lambswool quilt,      Her lord once more bethought him of his rest.          Now cocks had thrice sung out that night was e'er.      Then went Alcmena forth and told the thing      To Teiresias the seer, whose words were truth,      And bade him rede her what the end should be:--      'And if the gods bode mischief, hide it not,      Pitying, from me: man shall not thus avoid      The doom that Fate upon her distaff spins.      Son of Eueres, thou hast ears to hear.'          Thus spake the queen, and thus he made reply:      \"Mother of monarchs, Perseus' child, take heart;      And look but on the fairer side of things.      For by the precious light that long ago      Left tenantless these eyes, I swear that oft      Achaia's maidens, as when eve is high      They mould the silken yarn upon their lap,      Shall tell Alcmena's story: blest art thou      Of women. Such a man in this thy son      Shall one day scale the star-encumbered heaven:      His amplitude of chest bespeaks him lord      Of all the forest beasts and all mankind.      Twelve tasks accomplished he must dwell with Zeus;      His flesh given over to Trachinian fires;      And son-in-law be hailed of those same gods      Who sent yon skulking brutes to slay thy babe.      Lo! the day cometh when the fawn shall couch      In the wolfs lair, nor fear the spiky teeth      That would not harm him. But, O lady, keep      Yon smouldering fire alive; prepare you piles      Of fuel, bramble-sprays or fern or furze      Or pear-boughs dried with swinging in the wind:      And let the kindled wild-wood burn those snakes      At midnight, when they looked to slay thy babe.      And let at dawn some handmaid gather up      The ashes of the fire, and diligently      Convey and cast each remnant o'er the stream      Faced by clov'n rocks, our boundary: then return      Nor look behind. And purify your home      First with sheer sulphur, rain upon it then,      (Chaplets of olive wound about your heads,)      Innocuous water, and the customed salt.      Lastly, to Zeus almighty slay a boar:      So shall ye vanquish all your enemies.\"          Spake Teiresias, and wheeling (though his years      Weighed on him sorely) gained his ivory car.      And Heracles as some young orchard-tree      Grew up, Amphitryon his reputed sire.      Old Linus taught him letters, Phoebus' child,      A dauntless toiler by the midnight lamp.      Each fall whereby the sons of Argos fell,      The flingers by cross-buttock, each his man      By feats of wrestling: all that boxers e'er,      Grim in their gauntlets, have devised, or they      Who wage mixed warfare and, adepts in art,      Upon the foe fall headlong: all such lore      Phocian Harpalicus gave him, Hermes' son:      Whom no man might behold while yet far off      And wait his armed onset undismayed:      A brow so truculent roofed so stern a face.      To launch, and steer in safety round the goal,      Chariot and steed, and damage ne'er a wheel,      This the lad learned of fond Amphitryon's self.      Many a fair prize from listed warriors he      Had won on Argive racegrounds; yet the car      Whereon he sat came still unshattered"]]]
