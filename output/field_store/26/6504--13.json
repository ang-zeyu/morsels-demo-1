I was root  Of that ill plant, whose shade such poison sheds  O'er all the Christian land, that seldom thence  Good fruit is gather'd.  Vengeance soon should come,  Had Ghent and Douay, Lille and Bruges power;  And vengeance I of heav'n's great Judge implore.  Hugh Capet was I high: from me descend  The Philips and the Louis, of whom France  Newly is govern'd; born of one, who ply'd  The slaughterer's trade at Paris.  When the race  Of ancient kings had vanish'd (all save one  Wrapt up in sable weeds) within my gripe  I found the reins of empire, and such powers  Of new acquirement, with full store of friends,  That soon the widow'd circlet of the crown  Was girt upon the temples of my son,  He, from whose bones th' anointed race begins.  Till the great dower of Provence had remov'd  The stains, that yet obscur'd our lowly blood,  Its sway indeed was narrow, but howe'er  It wrought no evil: there, with force and lies,  Began its rapine; after, for amends,  Poitou it seiz'd, Navarre and Gascony.  To Italy came Charles, and for amends  Young Conradine an innocent victim slew,  And sent th' angelic teacher back to heav'n,  Still for amends.  I see the time at hand,  That forth from France invites another Charles  To make himself and kindred better known.  Unarm'd he issues, saving with that lance,  Which the arch-traitor tilted with; and that  He carries with so home a thrust, as rives  The bowels of poor Florence.  No increase  Of territory hence, but sin and shame  Shall be his guerdon, and so much the more  As he more lightly deems of such foul wrong.  I see the other, who a prisoner late  Had steps on shore, exposing to the mart  His daughter, whom he bargains for, as do  The Corsairs for their slaves.  O avarice!  What canst thou more, who hast subdued our blood  So wholly to thyself, they feel no care  Of their own flesh?  To hide with direr guilt  Past ill and future, lo! the flower-de-luce  Enters Alagna! in his Vicar Christ  Himself a captive, and his mockery  Acted again!  Lo! to his holy lip  The vinegar and gall once more applied!  And he 'twixt living robbers doom'd to bleed!  Lo! the new Pilate, of whose cruelty  Such violence cannot fill the measure up,  With no degree to sanction, pushes on  Into the temple his yet eager sails!    \"O sovran Master! when shall I rejoice  To see the vengeance, which thy wrath well-pleas'd  In secret silence broods?--While daylight lasts,  So long what thou didst hear of her, sole spouse  Of the Great Spirit, and on which thou turn'dst  To me for comment, is the general theme  Of all our prayers: but when it darkens, then  A different strain we utter, then record  Pygmalion, whom his gluttonous thirst of gold  Made traitor, robber, parricide: the woes  Of Midas, which his greedy wish ensued,  Mark'd for derision to all future times:  And the fond Achan, how he stole the prey,  That yet he seems by Joshua's ire pursued.  Sapphira with her husband next, we blame;  And praise the forefeet, that with furious ramp  Spurn'd Heliodorus.  All the mountain round  Rings with the infamy of Thracia's king,  Who slew his Phrygian charge: and last a shout  Ascends: \"Declare, O Crassus! for thou know'st,  The flavour of thy gold.\"  The voice of each  Now high now low, as each his impulse prompts,  Is led through many a pitch, acute or grave.  Therefore, not singly, I erewhile rehears'd  That blessedness we tell of in the day:  But near me none beside his accent rais'd.\"    From him we now had parted, and essay'd  With utmost efforts to surmount the way,  When I did feel, as nodding to its fall,  The mountain tremble; whence an icy chill  Seiz'd on me, as on one to death convey'd.  So shook not Delos, when Latona there  Couch'd to bring forth the twin-born eyes of heaven.    Forthwith from every side a shout arose  So vehement, that suddenly my guide  Drew near, and cried: \"Doubt not, while I conduct thee.\"  \"Glory!\" all shouted (such the sounds mine ear  Gather'd from those, who near me swell'd the sounds)  \"Glory in the highest be to God.\"  We stood  Immovably suspended, like to those,  The shepherds, who first heard in Bethlehem's field  That song: till ceas'd the trembling, and the song  Was ended: then our hallow'd path resum'd,  Eying the prostrate shadows, who renew'd  Their custom'd mourning.  Never in my breast  Did ignorance so struggle with desire  Of knowledge, if my memory do not err,  As in that moment; nor through haste dar'd I  To question, nor myself could aught discern,  So on I far'd in thoughtfulness and dread.          CANTO XXI    The natural thirst, ne'er quench'd but from the well,  Whereof the woman of Samaria crav'd,  Excited: haste along the cumber'd path,  After my guide, impell'd; and pity mov'd  My bosom for the 'vengeful deed, though just.  When lo! even as Luke relates, that Christ  Appear'd unto the two upon their way,  New-risen from his vaulted grave; to us  A shade appear'd, and after us approach'd,  Contemplating the crowd beneath its feet.  We were not ware of it; so first it spake,  Saying, \"God give you peace, my brethren!\" then  Sudden we turn'd: and Virgil such salute,  As fitted that kind greeting, gave, and cried:  \"Peace in the blessed council be thy lot  Awarded by that righteous court, which me  To everlasting banishment exiles!\"    \"How!\" he exclaim'd, nor from his speed meanwhile  Desisting, \"If that ye be spirits, whom God  Vouchsafes not room above, who up the height  Has been thus far your guide?\"  To whom the bard:  \"If thou observe the tokens, which this man  Trac'd by the finger of the angel bears,  'Tis plain that in the kingdom of the just  He needs must share.  But sithence she, whose wheel  Spins day and night, for him not yet had drawn  That yarn, which, on the fatal distaff pil'd,  Clotho apportions to each wight that breathes,  His soul, that sister is to mine and thine,  Not of herself could mount, for not like ours  Her ken: whence I, from forth the ample gulf  Of hell was ta'en, to lead him, and will lead  Far as my lore avails.  But, if thou know,  Instruct us for what cause, the mount erewhile  Thus shook and trembled: wherefore all at once  Seem'd shouting, even from his wave-wash'd foot.\"    That questioning so tallied with my wish,  The thirst did feel abatement of its edge  E'en from expectance.  He forthwith replied,  \"In its devotion nought irregular  This mount can witness, or by punctual rule  Unsanction'd; here from every change exempt.  Other than that, which heaven in itself  Doth of itself receive, no influence  Can reach us.  Tempest none, shower, hail or snow,  Hoar frost or dewy moistness, higher falls  Than that brief scale of threefold steps: thick clouds  Nor scudding rack are ever seen: swift glance  Ne'er lightens, nor Thaumantian Iris gleams,  That yonder often shift on each side heav'n.  Vapour adust doth never mount above  The highest of the trinal stairs, whereon  Peter's vicegerent stands.  Lower perchance,  With various motion rock'd, trembles the soil:  But here, through wind in earth's deep hollow pent,  I know not how, yet never trembled: then  Trembles, when any spirit feels itself  So purified, that it may rise, or move  For rising, and such loud acclaim ensues.  Purification by the will alone  Is prov'd, that free to change society  Seizes the soul rejoicing in her will.  Desire of bliss is present from the first;  But strong propension hinders, to that wish  By the just ordinance of heav'n oppos'd;  Propension now as eager to fulfil  Th' allotted torment, as erewhile to sin.  And I who in this punishment had lain  Five hundred years and more, but now have felt  Free wish for happier clime.  Therefore thou felt'st  The mountain tremble, and the spirits devout  Heard'st, over all his limits, utter praise  To that liege Lord, whom I entreat their joy  To hasten.\"  Thus he spake: and since the draught  Is grateful ever as the thirst is keen,  No words may speak my fullness of content.    \"Now,\" said the instructor sage, \"I see the net  That takes ye here, and how the toils are loos'd,  Why rocks the mountain and why ye rejoice.  Vouchsafe, that from thy lips I next may learn,  Who on the earth thou wast, and wherefore here  So many an age wert prostrate.\"--\"In that time,  When the good Titus, with Heav'n's King to help,  Aveng'd those piteous gashes, whence the blood  By Judas sold did issue, with the name  Most lasting and most honour'd there was I  Abundantly renown'd,\" the shade reply'd,  \"Not yet with faith endued.  So passing sweet  My vocal Spirit, from Tolosa, Rome  To herself drew me, where I merited  A myrtle garland to inwreathe my brow.  Statius they name me still.  Of Thebes I sang,  And next of great Achilles: but i' th' way  Fell with the second burthen.  Of my flame  Those sparkles were the seeds, which I deriv'd  From the bright fountain of celestial fire  That feeds unnumber'd lamps, the song I mean  Which sounds Aeneas' wand'rings: that the breast  I hung at, that the nurse, from whom my veins  Drank inspiration: whose authority  Was ever sacred with me.  To have liv'd  Coeval with the Mantuan, I would bide  The revolution of another sun  Beyond my stated years in banishment.\"    The Mantuan, when he heard him, turn'd to me,  And holding silence: by his countenance  Enjoin'd me silence but the power which wills,  Bears not supreme control: laughter and tears  Follow so closely on the passion prompts them,  They wait not for the motions of the will  In natures most sincere.  I did but smile,  As one who winks; and thereupon the shade  Broke off, and peer'd into mine eyes, where best  Our looks interpret. \"So to good event  Mayst thou conduct such great emprize,\" he cried,  \"Say, why across thy visage beam'd, but now,  The lightning of a smile!\"  On either part  Now am I straiten'd; one conjures me speak,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8800"],[0,"An Index of The Divine Comedy (#13)"],[1,"under bow,  Was William, whom that land bewails, which weeps  For Charles and Frederick living: now he knows  How well is lov'd in heav'n the righteous king,  Which he betokens by his radiant seeming.  Who in the erring world beneath would deem,  That Trojan Ripheus in this round was set  Fifth of the saintly splendours?  now he knows  Enough of that, which the world cannot see,  The grace divine, albeit e'en his sight  Reach not its utmost depth.\"  Like to the lark,  That warbling in the air expatiates long,  Then, trilling out his last sweet melody,  Drops satiate with the sweetness; such appear'd  That image stampt by the' everlasting pleasure,  Which fashions like itself all lovely things.    I, though my doubting were as manifest,  As is through glass the hue that mantles it,  In silence waited not: for to my lips  \"What things are these?\"  involuntary rush'd,  And forc'd a passage out: whereat I mark'd  A sudden lightening and new revelry.  The eye was kindled: and the blessed sign  No more to keep me wond'ring and suspense,  Replied: \"I see that thou believ'st these things,  Because I tell them, but discern'st not how;  So that thy knowledge waits not on thy faith:  As one who knows the name of thing by rote,  But is a stranger to its properties,  Till other's tongue reveal them.  Fervent love  And lively hope with violence assail  The kingdom of the heavens, and overcome  The will of the Most high; not in such sort  As man prevails o'er man; but conquers it,  Because 't is willing to be conquer'd, still,  Though conquer'd, by its mercy conquering.    \"Those, in the eye who live the first and fifth,  Cause thee to marvel, in that thou behold'st  The region of the angels deck'd with them.  They quitted not their bodies, as thou deem'st,  Gentiles but Christians, in firm rooted faith,  This of the feet in future to be pierc'd,  That of feet nail'd already to the cross.  One from the barrier of the dark abyss,  Where never any with good will returns,  Came back unto his bones.  Of lively hope  Such was the meed; of lively hope, that wing'd  The prayers sent up to God for his release,  And put power into them to bend his will.  The glorious Spirit, of whom I speak to thee,  A little while returning to the flesh,  Believ'd in him, who had the means to help,  And, in believing, nourish'd such a flame  Of holy love, that at the second death  He was made sharer in our gamesome mirth.  The other, through the riches of that grace,  Which from so deep a fountain doth distil,  As never eye created saw its rising,  Plac'd all his love below on just and right:  Wherefore of grace God op'd in him the eye  To the redemption of mankind to come;  Wherein believing, he endur'd no more  The filth of paganism, and for their ways  Rebuk'd the stubborn nations.  The three nymphs,  Whom at the right wheel thou beheldst advancing,  Were sponsors for him more than thousand years  Before baptizing.  O how far remov'd,  Predestination! is thy root from such  As see not the First cause entire: and ye,  O mortal men! be wary how ye judge:  For we, who see our Maker, know not yet  The number of the chosen: and esteem  Such scantiness of knowledge our delight:  For all our good is in that primal good  Concentrate, and God's will and ours are one.\"    So, by that form divine, was giv'n to me  Sweet medicine to clear and strengthen sight,  And, as one handling skillfully the harp,  Attendant on some skilful songster's voice  Bids the chords vibrate, and therein the song  Acquires more pleasure; so, the whilst it spake,  It doth remember me, that I beheld  The pair of blessed luminaries move.  Like the accordant twinkling of two eyes,  Their beamy circlets, dancing to the sounds.          CANTO XXI    Again mine eyes were fix'd on Beatrice,  And with mine eyes my soul, that in her looks  Found all contentment.  Yet no smile she wore  And, \"Did I smile,\" quoth she, \"thou wouldst be straight  Like Semele when into ashes turn'd:  For, mounting these eternal palace-stairs,  My beauty, which the loftier it climbs,  As thou hast noted, still doth kindle more,  So shines, that, were no temp'ring interpos'd,  Thy mortal puissance would from its rays  Shrink, as the leaf doth from the thunderbolt.  Into the seventh splendour are we wafted,  That underneath the burning lion's breast  Beams, in this hour, commingled with his might,  Thy mind be with thine eyes: and in them mirror'd  The shape, which in this mirror shall be shown.\"  Whoso can deem, how fondly I had fed  My sight upon her blissful countenance,  May know, when to new thoughts I chang'd, what joy  To do the bidding of my heav'nly guide:  In equal balance poising either weight.    Within the crystal, which records the name,  (As its remoter circle girds the world)  Of that lov'd monarch, in whose happy reign  No ill had power to harm, I saw rear'd up,  In colour like to sun-illumin'd gold.    A ladder, which my ken pursued in vain,  So lofty was the summit; down whose steps  I saw the splendours in such multitude  Descending, ev'ry light in heav'n, methought,  Was shed thence.  As the rooks, at dawn of day  Bestirring them to dry their feathers chill,  Some speed their way a-field, and homeward some,  Returning, cross their flight, while some abide  And wheel around their airy lodge; so seem'd  That glitterance, wafted on alternate wing,  As upon certain stair it met, and clash'd  Its shining. And one ling'ring near us, wax'd  So bright, that in my thought: said: \"The love,  Which this betokens me, admits no doubt.\"    Unwillingly from question I refrain,  To her, by whom my silence and my speech  Are order'd, looking for a sign: whence she,  Who in the sight of Him, that seeth all,  Saw wherefore I was silent, prompted me  T' indulge the fervent wish; and I began:  \"I am not worthy, of my own desert,  That thou shouldst answer me; but for her sake,  Who hath vouchsaf'd my asking, spirit blest!  That in thy joy art shrouded! say the cause,  Which bringeth thee so near: and wherefore, say,  Doth the sweet symphony of Paradise  Keep silence here, pervading with such sounds  Of rapt devotion ev'ry lower sphere?\"  \"Mortal art thou in hearing as in sight;\"  Was the reply: \"and what forbade the smile  Of Beatrice interrupts our song.  Only to yield thee gladness of my voice,  And of the light that vests me, I thus far  Descend these hallow'd steps: not that more love  Invites me; for lo! there aloft, as much  Or more of love is witness'd in those flames:  But such my lot by charity assign'd,  That makes us ready servants, as thou seest,  To execute the counsel of the Highest.\"  \"That in this court,\" said I, \"O sacred lamp!  Love no compulsion needs, but follows free  Th' eternal Providence, I well discern:  This harder find to deem, why of thy peers  Thou only to this office wert foredoom'd.\"  I had not ended, when, like rapid mill,  Upon its centre whirl'd the light; and then  The love, that did inhabit there, replied:  \"Splendour eternal, piercing through these folds,  Its virtue to my vision knits, and thus  Supported, lifts me so above myself,  That on the sov'ran essence, which it wells from,  I have the power to gaze: and hence the joy,  Wherewith I sparkle, equaling with my blaze  The keenness of my sight.  But not the soul,  That is in heav'n most lustrous, nor the seraph  That hath his eyes most fix'd on God, shall solve  What thou hast ask'd: for in th' abyss it lies  Of th' everlasting statute sunk so low,  That no created ken may fathom it.  And, to the mortal world when thou return'st,  Be this reported; that none henceforth dare  Direct his footsteps to so dread a bourn.  The mind, that here is radiant, on the earth  Is wrapt in mist.  Look then if she may do,  Below, what passeth her ability,  When she is ta'en to heav'n.\"  By words like these  Admonish'd, I the question urg'd no more;  And of the spirit humbly sued alone  T' instruct me of its state.  \"'Twixt either shore  Of Italy, nor distant from thy land,  A stony ridge ariseth, in such sort,  The thunder doth not lift his voice so high,  They call it Catria: at whose foot a cell  Is sacred to the lonely Eremite,  For worship set apart and holy rites.\"  A third time thus it spake; then added: \"There  So firmly to God's service I adher'd,  That with no costlier viands than the juice  Of olives, easily I pass'd the heats  Of summer and the winter frosts, content  In heav'n-ward musings.  Rich were the returns  And fertile, which that cloister once was us'd  To render to these heavens: now 't is fall'n  Into a waste so empty, that ere long  Detection must lay bare its vanity  Pietro Damiano there was I yclept:  Pietro the sinner, when before I dwelt  Beside the Adriatic, in the house  Of our blest Lady.  Near upon my close  Of mortal life, through much importuning  I was constrain'd to wear the hat that still  From bad to worse it shifted.--Cephas came;  He came, who was the Holy Spirit's vessel,  Barefoot and lean, eating their bread, as chanc'd,  At the first table.  Modern Shepherd's need  Those who on either hand may prop and lead them,  So burly are they grown: and from behind  Others to hoist them.  Down the palfrey's sides  Spread their broad mantles, so as both the beasts  Are cover'd with one skin.  O patience! thou  That lookst on this and doth endure so long.\"  I at those accents saw the splendours down  From step to step alight, and wheel, and wax,  Each circuiting, more beautiful.  Round this  They came, and stay'd them; uttered them a shout  So loud, it hath no likeness here: nor I  Wist what it spake, so deaf'ning was the thunder.          CANTO XXII    Astounded, to the guardian of my steps  I turn'd me, like the chill, who always runs  Thither for succour, where he trusteth most,  And she was like the mother, who her son  Beholding pale and breathless, with her voice  Soothes him, and he is cheer'd; for thus she spake,  Soothing me: \"Know'st not thou, thou art in heav'n?  And know'st not thou, whatever"]]]
