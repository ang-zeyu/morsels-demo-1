Age: 103.      \"You wants to know how old I is? I'se lived a long time. I'se goin' on  104. My gran'mammy was over 100 years. My mamma was 100. My pappy was  96. They was twelve chilluns. I don't know if any of my sisters or  brothers is livin'. Don't know if one of my friends back in my boy days  is livin'. I'se like a poor old leaf left hangin' to a tree.    \"Yes--I sho do member back befo' the war. I was borned on the Dr. Waters  place about twelve miles out of Pine Bluff on the east side of Noble  Lake. My gran'mammy and gran'pappy and my mamma and my pappy were slaves  on de Walker plantation. I was not bought or sold--just lived on de old  plantation. I wasn't whipped neither but once I mighty near got a  beatin'. Want to hear about it? I likes to tell.    \"Dr. Waters had a good heart. He didn't call us 'slaves'. He call us  'servants'. He didn't want none of his niggers whipped 'ceptin when  there wasn't no other way. I was grown up pretty good size. Dr. Waters  liked me cause I could make wagons and show mules. Once when he was  going away to be gone all day, he tole me what to do while he was gone.  The overseer wasn't no such good man as old master. He wanted to be boss  and told me what to do. I tole him de big boss had tole me what to do  and I was goin' to do it. He got mad and said if I didn't do what he  said I'd take a beating. I was a big nigger and powerful stout. I tole  the overseer fore he whipped me he's show himself a better man than I  was. When he found he was to have a fight he didn't say no more about  the whipping.    \"I worked on de plantation till de war broke. Then I went into the army  with them what called themselves secesh's. I didn't fight none, never  give me a gun nor sword. I was a servant. I cooked and toted things. In  1863 I was captured by the Yankees and marched to Little Rock and sworn  in as a Union Soldier. I was sure enough soldier now. I never did any  fighting but I marched with the soldiers and worked for them whatever  they said.    \"We marched from Pine Bluff on through Ft. Smith and the Indian  Territory of Oklahoma. Then we went to Leavenworth Kansas and back to  Jefferson County, Arkansas. And all that walking I did on these same  foots you see right here now.    \"On this long march we camped thirty miles from Ft. Smith. We had gone  without food three days and was powerful hongry. I started out to get  something to eat. I found a sheep, I was tickled. I laughed. I could  turn the taste of that sheep meat under my tongue. When I got to camp  with the sheep I had to leave for picket duty. Hungrier than ever, I  thought of that sheep all the time. When I got back I wanted my chunk of  meat. It had been killed, cooked, eat up. Never got a grease spot on my  finger from my sheep.    \"When time come for breaking up the army I went back to Jefferson county  and set to farmin'. I was free now. I didn't do so well on the land as I  didn't have mules and money to live on. I went to Dersa County and  opened up a blacksmith shop. I learned how to do this work when I was  with Dr. Waters. He had me taught by a skilled man. I learned to build  wagons too.    \"I made my own tools. Who showed me how? Nobody. When I needed a hack  saw I made it out of a file--that was all I had to make it of. I had to  have it. Once I made a cotton scraper out of a piece of hardwood. I put  a steel edge on it. O yes I made everything. Can I build a wagon--make  all the parts? Every thing but the hubs for the wheels.    \"You say I don't seem to see very well. Ha-ha! I don't see nuthin' at  all. I'se been plum blind for 23 years. I can't see nothin'. But I  patches my own clothes. You don't know how I can thread the needle? Look  here.\" I asked him to let me see his needle threader. He felt around in  a drawer and pulled out a tiny little half arrow which he had made of a  bit of tin with a pair of scissors and fine file. He pushed this through  the eye of the needle, then hooked the thread on it and pulled it back  again threading his needle as fast as if he had good eyesight. \"This is  a needle threader. I made it myself. Watch me thread a needle. Can't I  do it as fast as if I had a head full of keen eyes? My wife been gone  twenty years. She went blind too. I had to do something. My patches may  not look so pretty but they sure holt (hold).    \"You wants to know what I think of the way young folks is doing these  days? They'se goin' to fast. So is their papas and mammas. Dey done  forgot dey's a God and a day of settlin'. Den what dances pays de  fiddler. I got religion long time ago--jined de Baptist church in 1870  and haven't never got away from it. I'se tried to tote fair with God and  he's done fair by me.    \"Does I get a pension? I shure do. It was a lucky day when de Yankees  got me. Ef they hadn't I don't know what'd become of me. After I went  blind I had hard times. Folks, white folks and all, brought me food. But  that wasn't any good way to get along. Sometimes I ate, sometimes I  didn't. So some of my white, friends dug up my record with the Yankees  and got me a pension. Now I'm setting pretty for de rest of my life.  Yes--O yes I'se older dan most folks get. Still I may be still takin' my  grub here when some of these young whiskey drinkin razzin' around young  chaps is under the dirt. It pays to I don know of any bad spots in me  yet. It pays to live honest, work hard, stay sober. God only knows what  some of these lazy, triflin' drinkin' young folks is comin' to.\"          Interviewer: Pernella M. Anderson  Person interviewed: Mose Banks                      Douglas Addition, El Dorado, Arkansas  Age: 69      \"My name is Mose Banks and I am sixty-nine years old. I was born in  1869. I was born four years after freedom but still I was a slave in a  way. My papa stayed with his old miss and master after freedom until he  died and he just died in 1918, so we all stayed with him too. I had one  of the best easiest times in my life. My master was name Bob Stevenson  and he was a jewel. Never meaned us, never dogged, never hit one of us  in his life. He bought us just like he bought my papa. He never made any  of the girls work in the field. He said the work was too hard. He always  said splitting rails, bushing, plowing and work like that was for men.  That work makes no count women.    \"The girls swept yards, cleaned the house, nursed, and washed and  ironed, combed old miss' and the children's hair and cut their finger  and toe nails and mended the clothes. The womens' job was to cook,  attend to the cows, knit all the socks for the men and boys, spin  thread, card bats, weave cloth, quilt, sew, scrub and things like that.    \"The little boys drove up the cows, slopped the hogs, got wood and pine  for light, go to the spring and get water. After a boy was twelve then  he let him work in the fields. My main job was hitching the horse to the  buggy for old Miss Stevenson, and put the saddle on old master's saddle  horse.    \"I was very small but when the first railroad come through old master  took us to see the train. I guess it was about forty or fifty miles  because it took us around four days to make the round trip. The trains  were not like they are now. The engine was smaller and they burned wood  and they had what they called a drum head and they didn't run very fast,  and could not carry many cars. It was a narrow gauge road and the rails  were small and the road was dirt. It was not gravel and rocks like it is  now. It was a great show to me and we all had something to talk about  for a long time. People all around went to see it and we camped out one  night going and coming and camped one night at the railroad so we could  see the train the next day. A man kept putting wood in the furnace in  order to keep a fire. Smoke come out of the drum head. The drum head was  something like a big washpot or a big old hogshead barrel. An ox team  was used for most all traveling. You did not see very many horses or  mules.    \"The white children taught us how to read and I went to school too.    \"I went to church too. We did not have a church house; we used a brush  arbor for service for a long time. In the winter we built a big fire in  the middle and we sat all around the fire on small pine logs. Later they  built a log church, so we had service in there for years.    \"We did not live near a school, so old mistress and the children taught  us how to read and write and count. I never went to school in my life  and I bet you, can't none of these children that rub their heads on  college walls beat me reading and counting. You call one and ask them to  divide ninety-nine cows and one bob-tailed bull by two, and they can't  answer it to save their lives without a pencil and paper and two hours'  figuring when it's nothing to say but fifty.    \"Wasn't no cook stoves and heaters until about 1890 or 1900. If there  was I did not know about them. They cooked on fireplace and fire out in  the yard on what they called oven and we had plenty of plain grub. We  stole eggs from the big house because we never got any eggs.    \"The custom of marrying was just pack up and go on and live with who you  wanted to; that is the Negroes did--I don't know how the white people  married. This lawful marrying came from the law since man made law.    \"When anybody died everybody stopped working and moaned and prayed until  after the burying.    \"I can say there is as much difference between now and sixty years ago  as it is in day and night.\"          Interviewer: S. S. Taylor  Person interviewed: Henry Banner                      County Hospital                      Little Rock, Ark.  Age: ?      [HW: Forty Acres and a Mule]    \"I was sold the third year of the war for fifteen years old. That would  be in 1864. That would make my birthday come in 1849. I must have been  12 year old when the war started"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11277"],[0,"Egyptian Ideas of the Future Life (#14)"],[1,"of R[=a].\" And again: \"I am he who is not  driven back among the gods. But who is this? It is Tem, the dweller in  his disk, or as others say, it is R[=a] in his rising in the eastern  horizon of heaven.\" Thus we learn further that Nu was self-produced, and  that the gods are simply the names of his limbs; but then R[=a] is Nu,  and the gods who are in his train or following are merely  personifications of the names of his own members. He who cannot be  driven back among the gods is either Temu or R[=a], and so we find that  Nu, Temu, and R[=a] are one and the same god. The priests of Heliopolis  in setting Temu at the head of their company of the gods thus gave  R[=a], and Nu also, a place of high honour; they cleverly succeeded in  making their own local god chief of the company, but at the same time  they provided the older gods with positions of importance. In this way  worshippers of R[=a], who had regarded their god as the oldest of the  gods, would have little cause to complain of the introduction of Temu  into the company of the gods, and the local vanity of Heliopolis would  be gratified.    But besides the nine gods who were supposed to form the \"great company\"  of gods of the city of Heliopolis, there was a second group of nine gods  called the \"little company\" of the gods, and yet a third group of nine  gods, which formed the least company. Now although the _paut_ or company  of nine gods might be expected to contain nine always, this was not the  case, and the number nine thus applied is sometimes misleading. There  are several passages extant in texts in which the gods of a _paut_ are  enumerated, but the total number is sometimes ten and sometimes eleven.  This fact is easily explained when we remember that the Egyptians  deified the various forms or aspects of a god, or the various phases in  his life. Thus the setting sun, called Temu or Atmu, and the rising sun,  called Khepera, and the mid-day sun, called R[=a], were three forms of  the same god; and if any one of these three forms was included in a  _paut_ or company of nine gods, the other two forms were also included  by implication, even though the _paut_ then contained eleven, instead of  nine gods. Similarly, the various forms of each god or goddess of the  _paut_ were understood to be included in it, however large the total  number of gods might become. We are not, therefore, to imagine that the  three companies of the gods were limited in number to 9 x 3, or  twenty-seven, even though the symbol for god be given twenty-seven times  in the texts.    We have already alluded to the great number of gods who were known to  the Egyptians, but it will be readily imagined that it was only those  who were thought to deal with man's destiny, here and hereafter, who  obtained the worship and reverence of the people of Egypt. These were,  comparatively, limited in number, and in fact may be said to consist of  the members of the great company of the gods of Heliopolis, that is to  say, of the gods who belonged to the cycle of Osiris. These may be  briefly described as follows:--      1. TEMU or ATMU, _i.e._, the \"closer\" of the day, just as Ptah was the    \"opener\" of the day. In the story of the creation he declares that he    evolved himself under the form of the god Khepera, and in hymns he is    said to be the \"maker of the gods\", \"the creator of men\", etc., and he    usurped the position of R[=a] among the gods of Egypt. His worship    must have been already very ancient at the time of the kings of the    Vth dynasty, for his traditional form is that of a man at that time.      2. SHU was the firstborn son of Temu. According to one legend he    sprang direct from the god, and according to another the goddess    Hathor was his mother; yet a third legend makes him the son of Temu by    the goddess Ius[=a]set. He it was who made his way between the gods    Seb and Nut and raised up the latter to form the sky, and this belief    is commemorated by the figures of this god in which he is represented    as a god raising himself up from the earth with the sun's disk on his    shoulders. As a power of nature he typified the light, and, standing    on the top of a staircase at Hermopolis Magua, [Footnote: See above,    pp. 69 and 89.] he raised up the sky and held it up during each day.    To assist him in this work he placed a pillar at each of the cardinal    points, and the \"supports of Shu\" are thus the props of the sky.      3. TEFNUT was the twin-sister of Shu; as a power of nature she    typified moisture or some aspect of the sun's heat, but as a god of    the dead she seems to have been, in some way, connected with the    supply of drink to the deceased. Her brother Shu was the right eye of    Temu, and she was the left, _i.e._, Shu represented an aspect of the    Sun, and Tefnut of the Moon. The gods Temu, Shu, and Tefnut thus    formed a trinity, and in the story of the creation the god Temu says,    after describing how Shu and Tefnut proceeded from himself, \"thus from    being one god I became three.\"      4. SEB was the son of the god Shu. He is called the \"Erp[=a],\" _i.e._,    the \"hereditary chief\" of the gods, and the \"father of the gods,\"    these being, of course, Osiris, Isis, Set, and Nephthys. He was    originally the god of the earth, but later he became a god of the dead    as representing the earth wherein the deceased was laid. One legend    identifies him with the goose, the bird which, in later times was    sacred to him, and he is often called the \"Great Cackler,\" in allusion    to the idea that he made the primeval egg from which the world came    into being.      5. NUT was the wife of Seb and the mother of Osiris, Isis, Set, and    Nephthys. Originally she was the personification of the sky, and    represented the feminine principle which was active at the creation of    the universe. According to an old view, Seb and Nut existed in the    primeval watery abyss side by side with Shu and Tefnut; and later Seb    became the earth and Nut the sky. These deities were supposed to unite    every evening, and to remain embraced until the morning, when the god    Shu separated them, and set the goddess of the sky upon his four    pillars until the evening. Nut was, naturally, regarded as the mother    of the gods and of all things living, and she and her husband Seb were    considered to be the givers of food, not only to the living but also    to the dead. Though different views were current in Egypt as to the    exact location of the heaven of the beatified dead, yet all schools of    thought in all periods assigned it to some region in the sky, and the    abundant allusions in the texts to the heavenly bodies--that is, the    sun, moon, and stars--which the deceased dwells with, prove that the    final abode of the souls of the righteous was not upon earth. The    goddess Nut is sometimes represented as a female along whose body the    sun travels, and sometimes as a cow; the tree sacred to her was the    sycamore.      6. Osiris was the son of Seb and Nut, the husband of Isis and the    father of Horus. The history of this god is given elsewhere in this    book so fully that it is only necessary to refer briefly to him. He    was held to be a man although of divine origin; he lived and reigned    as a king on this earth; he was treacherously murdered by his brother    Set, and his body was cut up into fourteen pieces, which were    scattered about Egypt; after his death, Isis, by the use of magical    formulae supplied to her by Thoth, succeeded in raising him to life,    and he begot a son called Horus; when Horus was grown up, he engaged    in combat with Set, and overcame him, and thus \"avenged his father\";    by means of magical formulae, supplied to him by Thoth, Osiris    reconstituted and revivified his body, and became the type of the    resurrection and the symbol of immortality; he was also the hope, the    judge, and the god of the dead, probably even in pre-dynastic times.    Osiris was in one aspect a solar deity, and originally he seems to    have represented the sun after it had set; but he is also identified    with the moon. In the XVIIIth dynasty, however, he is already the    equal of R[=a], and later the attributes of God and of all the \"gods\"    were ascribed to him.      7. Isis was the wife of Osiris and mother of Horus; as a nature    goddess she had a place in the boat of the sun at the creation, when    she probably typified the dawn. By reason of her success in    revivifying her husband's body by means of the utterance of magical    formulae, she is called the \"lady of enchantments.\" Her wanderings in    search of her husband's body, and the sorrow which she endured in    bringing forth and rearing her child in the papyrus swamps of the    Delta, and the persecution which she suffered at the hands of her    husband's enemies, form the subject of many allusions in texts of all    periods. She has various aspects, but the one which appealed most to    the imagination of the Egyptians, was that of \"divine mother\"; in this    character thousands of statues represent her seated and suckling her    child Horus whom she holds upon her knees.      8. Set was the son of Seb and Nut, and the husband of Nephthys. At a    very early period he was regarded as the brother and friend of \"Horus    the Elder,\" the Aroueris of the Greeks, and Set represented the night    whilst Horus represented the day. Each of these gods performed many    offices of a friendly nature for the dead, and among others they set    up and held the ladder by which the deceased made his way from this    earth to heaven, and helped him to ascend it. But, at a later period,    the views of the Egyptians concerning Set changed, and soon after the    reign of the kings called \"Seti,\" _i.e._, those whose names were based    upon that of the god, he became the personification of all evil, and    of all that is horrible and terrible"]]]
