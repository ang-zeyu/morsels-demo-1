Nevertheless, following decades of mismanagement and statist policies, the    economy in the late 1980s was plagued with huge external debts and recurring    bouts of hyperinflation. Elected in 1989, in the depths of recession,    President MENEM has implemented a comprehensive economic restructuring    program that shows signs of putting Argentina on a path of stable,    sustainable growth. Argentina's currency has traded at par with the US    dollar since April 1991, and inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 20    years. Argentines have responded to the relative price stability by    repatriating flight capital and investing in domestic industry. Much remains    to be done in the 1990s in dismantling the old statist barriers to growth    and in solidifying the recent economic gains.

Then comes a sudden storm. What matters it to me? my part has been fully  done. The matter is in the hands of another--the Master of the ship.  The ship is foundering. What then have I to do? I do the only thing  that remains to me--to be drowned without fear, without a cry, without  upbraiding God, but knowing that what has been born must likewise  perish. For I am not Eternity, but a human being--a part of the whole,  as an hour is part of the day. I must come like the hour, and like the  hour must pass!          CLXXXVII    And now we are sending you to Rome to spy out the land; but none send  a coward as such a spy, that, if he hear but a noise and see a shadow  moving anywhere, loses his wits and comes flying to say, The enemy are  upon us!    So if you go now, and come and tell us: \"Everything at Rome is terrible:  Death is terrible, Exile is terrible, Slander is terrible, Want is  terrible; fly, comrades! the enemy are upon us!\" we shall reply, Get you  gone, and prophesy to yourself! we have but erred in sending such a spy  as you. Diogenes, who was sent as a spy long before you, brought us back  another report than this. He says that Death is no evil; for it need not  even bring shame with it. He says that Fame is but the empty noise of  madmen. And what report did this spy bring us of Pain, what of Pleasure,  what of Want? That to be clothed in sackcloth is better than any purple  robe; that sleeping on the bare ground is the softest couch; and in  proof of each assertion he points to his own courage, constancy, and  freedom; to his own healthy and muscular frame. \"There is no enemy  near,\" he cries, \"all is perfect peace!\"          CLXXXVIII    If a man has this peace--not the peace proclaimed by Caesar (how indeed  should he have it to proclaim?), nay, but the peace proclaimed by God  through reason, will not that suffice him when alone, when he beholds  and reflects:--Now can no evil happen unto me; for me there is no  robber, for me no earthquake; all things are full of peace, full of  tranquillity; neither highway nor city nor gathering of men, neither  neighbor nor comrade can do me hurt. Another supplies my food, whose  care it is; another my raiment; another hath given me perceptions of  sense and primary conceptions. And when He supplies my necessities no  more, it is that He is sounding the retreat, that He hath opened the  door, and is saying to thee, Come!--Wither? To nought that thou needest  fear, but to the friendly kindred elements whence thou didst spring.  Whatsoever of fire is in thee, unto fire shall return; whatsoever of  earth, unto earth; of spirit, unto spirit; of water, unto water. There  is no Hades, no fabled rivers of Sighs, of Lamentation, or of Fire: but  all things are full of Beings spiritual and divine. With thoughts like  these, beholding the Sun, Moon, and Stars, enjoying earth and sea, a man  is neither helpless nor alone!          CLXXXIX    What wouldst thou be found doing when overtaken by Death? If I might  choose, I would be found doing some deed of true humanity, of wide  import, beneficent and noble. But if I may not be found engaged in aught  so lofty, let me hope at least for this--what none may hinder, what is  surely in my power--that I may be found raising up in myself that which  had fallen; learning to deal more wisely with the things of sense;  working out my own tranquillity, and thus rendering that which is its  due to every relation of life. . . .    If death surprise me thus employed, it is enough if I can stretch forth  my hands to God and say, \"The faculties which I received at Thy hands  for apprehending this thine Administration, I have not neglected. As far  as in me lay, I have done Thee no dishonour. Behold how I have used the  senses, the primary conceptions which Thous gavest me. Have I ever laid  anything to Thy charge? Have I ever murmured at aught that came to pass,  or wished it otherwise? Have I in anything transgressed the relations  of life? For that Thou didst beget me, I thank Thee for that Thou hast  given: for the time during which I have used the things that were Thine,  it suffices me. Take them back and place them wherever Thou wilt! They  were all Thine, and Thou gavest them me.\"--If a man depart thus minded,  is it not enough? What life is fairer and more noble, what end happier  than his?          (APPENDIX A)          Fragments Attributed to Epictetus          I    A life entangled with Fortune is like a torrent. It is turbulent  and muddy; hard to pass and masterful of mood: noisy and of brief  continuance.          II    The soul that companies with Virtue is like an ever-flowing source. It  is a pure, clear, and wholesome draught; sweet, rich, and generous of  its store; that injures not, neither destroys.          III    It is a shame that one who sweetens his drink with the gifts of the bee,  should embitter God's gift Reason with vice.          IV    Crows pick out the eyes of the dead, when the dead have no longer need  of them; but flatterers mar the soul of the living, and her eyes they  blind.          V    Keep neither a blunt knife nor an ill-disciplined looseness of tongue.          VI    Nature hath given men one tongue but two ears, that we may hear from  others twice as much as we speak.          VII    Do not give sentence in another tribunal till you have been yourself  judged in the tribunal of Justice.          VIII    If is shameful for a Judge to be judged by others.          IX    Give me by all means the shorter and nobler life, instead of one that is  longer but of less account!          X    Freedom is the name of virtue: Slavery, of vice. . . . None is a slave  whose acts are free.          XI    Of pleasures, those which occur most rarely give the most delight.          XII    Exceed due measure, and the most delightful things become the least  delightful.          XIII    The anger of an ape--the threat of a flatterer:--these deserve equal  regard.          XIV    Chastise thy passions that they avenge not themselves upon thee.          XV    No man is free who is not master of himself.          XVI    A ship should not ride on a single anchor, nor life on a single hope.          XVII    Fortify thyself with contentment: that is an impregnable stronghold.          XVIII    No man who is a lover of money, of pleasure, of glory, is likewise a  lover of Men; but only he that is a lover of whatsoever things are fair  and good.    XIX    Think of God more often than thou breathest.          XX    Choose the life that is noblest, for custom can make it sweet to thee.          XXI    Let thy speech of God be renewed day by day, aye, rather than thy meat  and drink.          XXII    Even as the Sun doth not wait for prayers and incantations to rise, but  shines forth and is welcomed by all: so thou also wait not for clapping  of hands and shouts and praise to do thy duty; nay, do good of thine own  accord, and thou wilt be loved like the Sun.          XXIII    Let no man think that he is loved by any who loveth none.          XXIV    If thou rememberest that God standeth by to behold and visit all that  thou doest; whether in the body or in the soul, thou surely wilt not err  in any prayer or deed; and thou shalt have God to dwell with thee.      Note.--Schweighueser's great edition collects 181 fragments attributed  to Epictetus, of which but a few are certainly genuine. Some (as xxi.,  xxiv., above) bear the stamp of Pythagorean origin; others, though  changed in form, may well be based upon Epictetean sayings. Most have  been preserved in the Anthology of John of Stobi (Stobaeus), a Byzantine  collector, of whom scarcely anything is known but that he probably wrote  towards the end of the fifth century, and made his vast body of  extracts from more than five hundred authors for his son's use. The  best examination of the authenticity of the Fragments is Quaestiones  Epicteteae, by R. Asmus, 1888. The above selection includes some of  doubtful origin but intrinsic interest.--Crossley.          (APPENDIX B)          The Hymn of Cleanthes         Chiefest glory of deathless Gods, Almighty for ever,       Sovereign of Nature that rulest by law, what Name shall we            give Thee?--       Blessed be Thou! for on Thee should call all things that are            mortal.       For that we are Thine offspring; nay, all that in myriad motion       Lives for its day on the earth bears one impress--Thy            likeness--upon it.       Wherefore my song is of Thee, and I hymn thy power for ever.         Lo, the vast orb of the Worlds, round the Earth evermore as it            rolleth,       Feels Thee its Ruler and Guide, and owns Thy lordship rejoicing.       Aye, for Thy conquering hands have a servant of living fire--       Sharp is the bolt!--where it falls, Nature shrinks at the shock       and doth shudder.       Thus Thou directest the Word universal that pulses through all            things,       Mingling its life with Lights that are great and Lights that            are lesser,       E'en as beseemeth its birth, High King through ages unending.         Nought is done that is done without Thee in the earth or the waters       Or in the heights of heaven, save the deed of the fool and the            sinner.       Thou canst make rough things smooth; at Thy voice, lo, jarring            disorder       Moveth to music, and Love is born where hatred abounded.       Thus hast Thou fitted alike things good and things evil together,       That over all might reign one Reason, supreme and eternal;       Though thereunto the hearts of the wicked be hardened and            heedless--       Woe unto them!--for while ever their hands are grasping at            good things,       Blind are their eyes, yea, stopped are their ears to God's Law            universal,       Calling through wise disobedience to"]]]
