In the little stream were many  pebbles of vesicular trap, probably an amygdaloid with the kernels  decomposed, but containing particles of olivine; also pebbles of a  syenitic compound, consisting of quartz, hornblende, and felspar; and of  compact felspar, mottled green and white, the green colour probably being  due to chlorite or green earth, and they enclosed also decomposed  crystals of mica and hornblende.    VIEW ON ASCENDING THE RANGE OF NUNDEWAR.    After climbing about one mile and a half, we reached a lofty summit,  where I hoped to obtain a view beyond the range, or at least to discover  how it might be crossed, but I was disappointed. Distant summits, more  lofty and difficult of access, obstructed our view towards the east,  north, and even west; while the only link connecting the hill we had  gained with those still higher was a very bold, naked rock, presenting a  perpendicular side, at least 200 feet in height. To proceed further in  that direction was therefore quite out of the question. (See Plate 7.)    NATIVE FEMALE.    As we descended, we came suddenly on an old woman who, as soon as she saw  us, ran off in terror. I ordered the two men who accompanied me to keep  back, until Mr. Brown could overtake and tell her that we intended no  harm; and she was easily persuaded, after a brief conversation with our  guide, to allow us to come near. She presented a most humiliating  specimen of our race: a figure shortened and shrivelled with age,  entirely without clothing, one eye alone saw through the dim decay of  nature, several large fleshy excrescences projected from the side of her  head like so many ears and the jawbone was visible through a gash or scar  on one side of her chin. The withered arms and hands, covered with earth  by digging and scraping for the snakes and worms on which she fed, more  resembled the limbs and claws of a quadruped. She spoke with a low nasal  whine, prolonged at the end of each sentence; and this our guide imitated  in speaking to her. The mosquitoes tormented her much, as appeared from  her incessantly slapping her limbs and body. Mr. Brown's conversation  seemed animated on some subject, but not, as I at last suspected, on that  most important to us; for, when I enquired, after he had spoken a long  time, what she said of The Barber and the way across the mountains, he  was obliged to commence a set of queries, evidently for the first time.  She said horses might pass, pointing at the same time further to the  eastward--but our guide seemed unwilling to put further questions, saying  she had promised to send at sunset to our tents two young boys, who could  inform us better. Even in such a wretched state of existence, ornaments  had their charms with this female, though the decency of covering was  wholly disregarded. Around her brow she had kangaroo teeth fastened to  the few remaining hairs, and a knot of brown feathers decorated her right  temple. The roasting snake, which we had seen in the morning, belonged,  as we now learned, to this witch of the glen.    PROPOSED EXCURSION WITH PACKHORSES.    The boys did not visit us in the evening as Mr. Brown had expected; and  he appeared unusually thoughtful, when I found him sitting alone by the  waterside, at some distance from the camp. I was then making arrangements  for carrying across the range the bulk of our provisions and equipment on  packhorses and bullocks, intending to leave the remainder of our stores  at this spot, in charge of two men armed; but of this measure Mr. Brown  did not approve.    NATIVE GUIDE ABSCONDS.    December 20.    When the packhorses had been loaded and we were about to start, leaving  the remainder of our provisions in charge of two men, we discovered that  our native guide was missing. I had promised him for his services a  tomahawk, a knife, and a blanket, and as I supposed he was already far  beyond his own beat, he might have had the promised rewards, by merely  asking for them. We had always given him plenty of flour, also his choice  of any part of the kangaroos we killed. It had been observed by the men  that the intelligence received from the old woman had made him extremely  uneasy, and he had also expressed to them on the previous evening his  apprehensions about the natives in the country before us. I was very  sorry for the loss of Mr. Brown. He was very comical, as indeed these  half-civilised aborigines generally are; he liked to be close-shaved,  wore a white neckcloth, and declared it to be his intention of becoming,  from that time forward a whitefellow. I concluded that he had returned to  his own tribe; and that he had been unwilling to acknowledge to me his  dread of the myall tribes. We proceeded up the valley, or to the  eastward, with the pack animals, and endeavoured to pass to the  northward, where we found a valley in that direction, but at length it  became impossible to go forward with some of the bullocks, which were not  used to carry packsaddles.    THE RANGE IMPASSABLE.    The passage was almost hopeless, indeed it was so bad that I was at  length convinced it might be easier to pass to the northward in ANY other  direction than this, and that it would not be prudent to struggle with  such difficulties, and separate my party for the purpose of crossing a  range, which, for all I could see, might be easily turned by passing  between its western extremity and the river Namoi.    RETURN TO TANGULDA.    We had now tried the course pointed out by The Bushranger, and, having  found that it was wholly impracticable, I determined upon returning to  Tangulda, and by pursuing the Namoi to endeavour to turn this range and  so enter the region beyond it. With this resolution I moved back to the  depot, which we left in the morning, and having reached it, made  preparations to retrace our course. Mr. White followed Maule's river for  some miles to the westward, so that we could judge of the direction in  which it fell into the Namoi. This evening as Burnett, the carpenter, was  seated beside a pool with his gun, silently engaged in watching some  ducks, two natives approached on the opposite side to fill a small vessel  with water, they looked around very cautiously, as if conscious that we  were near, but Burnett very prudently did not allow them to see him.    December 21.    The whole party having started early, we this day reached the former  encampment near Tangulda, a distance of twenty-one miles, in seven hours.    December 22.    I set out before the party moved off, in order to mark the line of route  for the carts, and to fix on a spot for the camp. I rode over firm and  level ground, on a bearing of 295 degrees, which I knew would bring me to  the little hill observed from Tangulda, where the Namoi passes to the  lower country beyond. The morning was so foggy that I could see none of  the hills. The perfume from the recently burnt bushes of Acacia pendula  was most fragrant, and, to me, quite new. At six miles I came upon the  river which was flowing rapidly northward. Its deeper bed and sparkling  waters looked very different from the stagnant lagoon we had left that  morning. The grass along the banks was excellent, and on the little hill  beside the river hung pines (Callitris pyramidalis) in abundance. Lofty  bluegum-trees grew on the margin of the stream, and the place, upon the  whole, seemed favourable for the formation of a depot, where I might  leave the cattle to refresh while proceeded down the Namoi in the canvas  boats, with the materials for constructing which, we were provided. This  river was the channel of the united waters of the Peel, Muluerindie and  Conadilly. Some of these streams traversed extensive plains, subject to  inundation, but the low rocky hills in this neighbourhood afforded  perfect security. The country smoked around us on all sides; and the  invisible blacks, The Barber's allies, were not well disposed towards us,  but in a position like this our depot would be secure.    PREPARE TO LAUNCH THE BOATS ON THE NAMOI.    I accordingly made preparations for constructing our boats and launching  them on the Namoi as soon as possible. With four adjoining trees cut off  at equal height, we formed a saw-pit, and a small recess which had been  worked in the bank by the floods served as a dock in which to set up and  float the boats. We had fixed upon this spot because it appeared more  favourable for launching than that higher up the river, where the water  was shallower, and drift timber lay across it.    The course of the Namoi, as far as it could be traced from the hill, was  northward, and the evening being clear, I could perceive very plainly in  the same direction, the western extremity of the range, which we had so  needlessly endeavoured to cross.

The real  form of this gulph remained in as great doubt with geographers, as were  the manner how, and time when it acquired its name.* The east side of the  Gulph had been explored to the latitude of 17 deg., and many rivers were  there marked and named; but how far the representation given of it by the  Dutch was faithful--what were the productions, and what its  inhabitants--were, in a great measure, uncertain. Or rather it was  certain, that those early navigators did not possess the means of fixing  the positions and forms of lands, with any thing like the accuracy of  modern science; and that they could have known very little of the  productions, or inhabitants. Of the rest of the Gulph no one could say,  with any confidence, upon what authority its form had been given in the  charts; so that conjecture, being at liberty to appropriate the Gulph of  Carpentaria to itself, had made it the entrance to a vast arm of the sea,  dividing Terra Australis into two, or more, islands.    [* I am aware that the president de Brossed says, \"This same year also  (1628) CARPENTARIA was thus named by P. Carpenter, who discovered it when  general in the service of the Dutch Company. He returned from India to  Europe, in the month of June 1628, with five ships richly laden.\" (_Hist.  des Nav. aux Terres Aust_. Tome I. 433). But the president here seems to  give either his own, or the Abbe' Prevost's conjectures, for matters of  fact. We have seen, that the coast called Carpentaria was discovered long  before 1628; and it is, besides, little probable, that Carpenter should  have been making discoveries with five ships richly laden and homeward  bound. This name of Carpentaria does not once appear in Tasman's  Instructions, dated in 1644; but is found in Thevenot's chart of 1663.]    3rd. _A more exact investigation of the bays, shoals, islands, and coasts  of ARNHEM'S, and the northern VAN DIEMEN'S, LANDS_. The information upon  these was attended with uncertainty; first, because the state of  navigation was very low at the time of their discovery; and second, from  want of the details and authorities upon which they had been laid down.  The old charts contained large islands lying off the coast, under the  names of _T' Hoog Landt_ or _Wessel's Eylandt_, and _Crocodils Eylanden_;  but of which little more was known than that, if they existed, they must  lie to the eastward of 135 deg. from Greenwich. Of the R. Spult, and other  large streams represented to intersect the coast, the existence even was  doubtful. That the coast was dangerous, and shores sandy, seemed to be  confirmed by Mr McCluer's chart; and that they were peopled by \"divers  cruel, poor, and brutal nations,\" was certainly not improbable, but it  rested upon very suspicious authority. The Instructions to Tasman. said,  in 1644, \"Nova Guinea has been found to be inhabited by cruel, wild,  savages; and as _it is uncertain what sort of people the inhabitants of  the South Lands are_, it may be presumed that they are also wild and  barbarous savages, rather than a civilized people.\" This uncertainty,  with respect to the natives of Arnhem's and the northern Van Diemen's  Lands, remained, in a great degree, at the end of the eighteenth century.    Thus, whatever could bear the name of _exact_, whether in natural  history, geography, or navigation, was yet to be learned of a country  possessing five hundred leagues of sea-coast; and placed in a climate and  neighbourhood, where the richest productions of both the vegetable and  mineral kingdoms were known to exist. A voyage which should have had no  other view, than the survey of Torres' Strait and the thorough  investigation of the North Coast of Terra Australis, could not have been  accused of wanting an object worthy of national consideration.    PRIOR DISCOVERIES IN TERRA AUSTRALIS.    SECTION II.    WESTERN COASTS.    Preliminary Observations.  Discoveries of Hartog:  Edel:  of the Ship Leeuwin:  the Vianen:  of Pelsert:  Tasman:  Dampier:  Vlaming:  Dampier.  Conclusive Remarks.    PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS. (ATLAS Pl. I.)    Under the term WESTERN COASTS, is comprehended the space from the western  extremity of the northern _Van Diemen's Land_ to the _North-west Cape_ of  New Holland; and from thence, southward to _Cape Leeuwin_. The first is  usually termed the North-west, and the second the West Coast: Taken  together, they present an extent of shore of between seven and eight  hundred leagues in length; lying in the fine climates comprised between  the 11th and 35th degrees of south latitude.    HARTOG. 1616.    The recital of discoveries in Tasman's instructions speaks of the first  knowledge gained of these coasts in the following terms: \"In the years  1616, 1618, 1619, and 1622, the west coast of this _Great unknown_ SOUTH  LAND, from 35 deg. to 22 deg. south latitude, was discovered by outward-bound  ships; and among them by the ship _Endragt_.\" The recital gives no  further particulars; but from thence, and from a manuscript chart by  _Eessel Gerrits_, 1627,* there seems to be sufficient authority for  attributing the first authenticated discovery of any part of the Western  Coasts to DIRK HARTOG, commander of the ship _Endragt_, outward-bound  from Holland to India. He appears to have first seen the West Coast in  latitude about 261/2 deg. south; and to have sailed northward along it, to  about 23 deg.; giving the name LANDT DE ENDRAGT, to the country so  discovered. An important part of his discovery was _Dirk Hartog's Road_  (at the entrance of a sound afterwards called _Shark's Bay_, by Dampier),  lying a little south Of 25 deg.. Upon one of the islands which form the road  there was found, first in 1697, and afterwards in 1801, a plate of tin,  bearing the following inscription.    [* See Dalrymple's _Collection concerning Papua_, note, page 6.]    \"Anno 1616, the 25th of October arrived here the ship _Endragt_ of  Amsterdam; the first merchant _Gillis Miebais_ of Luik, _Dirk Hartog_ of  Amsterdam, captain. They sailed from hence for Bantam, the 27th Do.\" On  the lower part, as far as could be distinguished in 1697, was cut with a  knife, \"The under merchant _Jan Stins_; chief mate _Pieter Dookus_ of  Bill. Ao. 1616.\"    The _Mauritius_, another outward-bound ship, appears to have made some  further discovery upon the West Coast, in July 1618, particularly Of  WILLEM'S RIVER, near the North-west Cape; but no further particulars are  known.    EDEL. 1619.    In Campbell's edition of _Harris' Voyages_ (p. 325), it is said, \"The  next year the LAND OF EDEL was found, and received its name from the  discoverer.\". The president De Brosses says nearly the same thing (Tome  I. P. 432); whence, combining this with the Dutch recital and the chart  of Eessel Gerritz, it should appear that J. DE EDEL commanded an  outward-bound ship; and, in July 1619, accidentally fell in with that  part of the West Coast to which his name is applied. The extent of Edel's  discovery appears, from Thevenot's chart, to have been from about the  latitude 29 deg., northward to 261/2 deg., where the Land of Endragt commences; but  in a chart of this coast, by _Van Keulen_, the name is extended southward  to 32 deg. 20', past the island Rottenest, which, according to Thevenot,  should rather have been the discovery of the ship Leeuwin.    The great reef lying off the coast of Edel, called _Houtman's Abrolhos_,  was discovered at the same time; probably by Edel, or by some ship in the  same squadron.    THE LEEUWIN. 1622.    I do not find it any where said who commanded the _Leeuwin_, or Lioness;  but it should appear, that this was also one of the outward-bound ships  which fell in with the West Coast. In Thevenot's chart, Leeuwin's Land  comprehends about ninety leagues of the south-west extremity of New  Holland; and, from the latitude of 35 deg., extends northward to about 31 deg.;  but in later publications, it has been much restricted in its northern  limit, apparently, upon the authority of Van Keulen.    THE VIANEN. 1628.    The next discovery upon the Western Coasts was that of the ship _Vianen_,  one of the seven which returned to Europe under the command of the  governor-general Carpenter. The Dutch recital speaks of this discovery in  the following terms. The coast was seen \"again accidentally in the year  1628, on the north side, in the latitude 21 deg. south, by the ship Vianen,  homeward bound from India; when they coasted two-hundred miles, without  gaining any knowledge of this Great Country; only observing a foul and  barren shore, green fields, and very wild, black, barbarous inhabitants.\"    This was the part called DE WITT'S LAND; but whether the name were  applied by the captain of the Vianen does not appear in the recital. De  Brosses says, \"William de Witt gave his own name to the country which he  saw in 1628, to the north of Remessen's River; and which _Viane_, a Dutch  captain, had, to his misfortune, discovered in the month of January in  the same year; when he was driven upon this coast of De Witt, in 21 deg. of  latitude, and lost all his riches.\" The confusion that reigns in the  president's account does not render it improbable, that the country might  have received its _name_ in the way he describes, and in the year 1628;  for, in 1644, _De Witt's Land_ is used as a known term for this part of  the North-west Coast.    PELSERT. 1629.    Thus far, the parts of the Western Coasts have been distinguished by  little else than the dates and limits of their discovery; for, in fact,  this is all that has reached us from these early navigators. The  following account is of a different character: it is extracted from the  twenty-first piece in Thevenot's collection; and, in the table of  contents, is said to be translated from the Dutch.
