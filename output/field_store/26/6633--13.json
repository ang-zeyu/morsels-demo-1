And what brought you  here?\"    \"I came to thank God for my happy deliverance,\" said Rochefort.    \"And nothing more? I suppose that is not all.\"    \"To take my orders from the coadjutor and to see if we cannot wake up  Mazarin a little.\"    \"A bad plan; you'll be shut up again in the Bastile.\"    \"Oh, as to that, I shall take care, I assure you. The air, the fresh,  free air is so good; besides,\" and Rochefort drew a deep breath as he  spoke, \"I am going into the country to make a tour.\"    \"Stop,\" cried D'Artagnan; \"I, too, am going.\"    \"And if I may without impertinence ask--where are you going?\"    \"To seek my friends.\"    \"What friends?\"    \"Those that you asked about yesterday.\"    \"Athos, Porthos and Aramis--you are looking for them?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"On honor?\"    \"What, then, is there surprising in that?\"    \"Nothing. Queer, though. And in whose behalf are you looking for them?\"    \"You are in no doubt on that score.\"    \"That is true.\"    \"Unfortunately, I have no idea where they are.\"    \"And you have no way to get news of them? Wait a week and I myself will  give you some.\"    \"A week is too long. I must find them within three days.\"    \"Three days are a short time and France is large.\"    \"No matter; you know the word must; with that word great things are  done.\"    \"And when do you set out?\"    \"I am now on my road.\"    \"Good luck to you.\"    \"And to you--a good journey.\"    \"Perhaps we shall meet on our road.\"    \"That is not probable.\"    \"Who knows? Chance is so capricious. Adieu, till we meet again! Apropos,  should Mazarin speak to you about me, tell him that I should have  requested you to acquaint him that in a short time he will see whether I  am, as he says, too old for action.\"    And Rochefort went away with one of those diabolical smiles which used  formerly to make D'Artagnan shudder, but D'Artagnan could now see it  without alarm, and smiling in his turn, with an expression of melancholy  which the recollections called up by that smile could, perhaps, alone  give to his countenance, he said:    \"Go, demon, do what thou wilt! It matters little now to me. There's no  second Constance in the world.\"    On his return to the cathedral, D'Artagnan saw Bazin, who was conversing  with the sacristan. Bazin was making, with his spare little short arms,  ridiculous gestures. D'Artagnan perceived that he was enforcing prudence  with respect to himself.    D'Artagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade  at the corner of the Rue des Canettes; it was impossible that Bazin  should go out of the cathedral without his seeing him.    In five minutes Bazin made his appearance, looking in every direction to  see if he were observed, but he saw no one. Calmed by appearances he  ventured to walk on through the Rue Notre Dame. Then D'Artagnan rushed  out of his hiding place and arrived in time to see Bazin turn down the  Rue de la Juiverie and enter, in the Rue de la Calandre, a respectable  looking house; and this D'Artagnan felt no doubt was the habitation of  the worthy beadle. Afraid of making any inquiries at this house,  D'Artagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked  for a cup of hypocras. This beverage required a good half-hour to  prepare. And D'Artagnan had time, therefore, to watch Bazin unsuspected.    He perceived in the tavern a pert boy between twelve and fifteen years  of age whom he fancied he had seen not twenty minutes before under the  guise of a chorister. He questioned him, and as the boy had no interest  in deceiving, D'Artagnan learned that he exercised, from six o'clock in  the morning until nine, the office of chorister, and from nine o'clock  till midnight that of a waiter in the tavern.    Whilst he was talking to this lad a horse was brought to the door of  Bazin's house. It was saddled and bridled. Almost immediately Bazin came  downstairs.    \"Look!\" said the boy, \"there's our beadle, who is going a journey.\"    \"And where is he going?\" asked D'Artagnan.    \"Forsooth, I don't know.\"    \"Half a pistole if you can find out,\" said D'Artagnan.    \"For me?\" cried the boy, his eyes sparkling with joy, \"if I can find out  where Bazin is going? That is not difficult. You are not joking, are  you?\"    \"No, on the honor of an officer; there is the half-pistole;\" and he  showed him the seductive coin, but did not give it him.    \"I shall ask him.\"    \"Just the very way not to know. Wait till he is set out and then, marry,  come up, ask, and find out. The half-pistole is ready,\" and he put it  back again into his pocket.    \"I understand,\" said the child, with that jeering smile which marks  especially the \"gamin de Paris.\" \"Well, we must wait.\"    They had not long to wait. Five minutes afterward Bazin set off on a  full trot, urging on his horse by the blows of a parapluie, which he was  in the habit of using instead of a riding whip.    Scarcely had he turned the corner of the Rue de la Juiverie when the boy  rushed after him like a bloodhound on full scent.    Before ten minutes had elapsed the child returned.    \"Well!\" said D'Artagnan.    \"Well!\" answered the boy, \"the thing is done.\"    \"Where is he gone?\"    \"The half-pistole is for me?\"    \"Doubtless, answer me.\"    \"I want to see it. Give it me, that I may see it is not false.\"    \"There it is.\"    The child put the piece of money into his pocket.    \"And now, where is he gone?\" inquired D'Artagnan.    \"He is gone to Noisy.\"    \"How dost thou know?\"    \"Ah, faith! there was no great cunning necessary. I knew the horse he  rode; it belonged to the butcher, who lets it out now and then to M.  Bazin. Now I thought that the butcher would not let his horse out like  that without knowing where it was going. And he answered 'that Monsieur  Bazin went to Noisy.' 'Tis his custom. He goes two or three times a  week.\"    \"Dost thou know Noisy well?\"    \"I think so, truly; my nurse lives there.\"    \"Is there a convent at Noisy?\"    \"Isn't there a great and grand one--the convent of Jesuits?\"    \"What is thy name?\"    \"Friquet.\"    D'Artagnan wrote the child's name in his tablets.    \"Please, sir,\" said the boy, \"do you think I can gain any more  half-pistoles in any way?\"    \"Perhaps,\" replied D'Artagnan.    And having got out all he wanted, he paid for the hypocras, which he did  not drink, and went quickly back to the Rue Tiquetonne.          8. D'Artagnan, Going to a Distance to discover Aramis.      On entering the hotel D'Artagnan saw a man sitting in a corner by the  fire. It was Planchet, but so completely transformed, thanks to the old  clothes that the departing husband had left behind, that D'Artagnan  himself could hardly recognize him. Madeleine introduced him in presence  of all the servants. Planchet addressed the officer with a fine Flemish  phrase; the officer replied in words that belonged to no language at  all, and the bargain was concluded; Madeleine's brother entered  D'Artagnan's service.    The plan adopted by D'Artagnan was soon perfected. He resolved not to  reach Noisy in the day, for fear of being recognized; he had therefore  plenty of time before him, for Noisy is only three or four leagues from  Paris, on the road to Meaux.    He began his day by breakfasting substantially--a bad beginning when one  wants to employ the head, but an excellent precaution when one wants to  work the body; and about two o'clock he had his two horses saddled, and  followed by Planchet he quitted Paris by the Barriere de la Villete. A  most active search was still prosecuted in the house near the Hotel de  la Chevrette for the discovery of Planchet.    At about a league and a half from the city, D'Artagnan, finding that in  his impatience he had set out too soon, stopped to give the horses  breathing time. The inn was full of disreputable looking people, who  seemed as if they were on the point of commencing some nightly  expedition. A man, wrapped in a cloak, appeared at the door, but seeing  a stranger he beckoned to his companions, and two men who were drinking  in the inn went out to speak to him.    D'Artagnan, on his side, went up to the landlady, praised her  wine--which was a horrible production from the country of Montreuil--and  heard from her that there were only two houses of importance in the  village; one of these belonged to the Archbishop of Paris, and was at  that time the abode of his niece the Duchess of Longueville; the other  was a convent of Jesuits and was the property--a by no means unusual  circumstance--of these worthy fathers.    At four o'clock D'Artagnan recommenced his journey. He proceeded slowly  and in deep reverie. Planchet also was lost in thought, but the subject  of their reflections was not the same.    One word which their landlady had pronounced had given a particular turn  to D'Artagnan's deliberations; this was the name of Madame de  Longueville.    That name was indeed one to inspire imagination and produce thought.  Madame de Longueville was one of the highest ladies in the realm; she  was also one of the greatest beauties at court. She had formerly been  suspected of an intimacy of too tender a nature with Coligny, who, for  her sake, had been killed in a duel, in the Place Royale, by the Duc de  Guise. She was now connected by bonds of a political nature with the  Prince de Marsillac, the eldest son of the old Duc de Rochefoucauld,  whom she was trying to inspire with an enmity toward the Duc de Conde,  her brother-in-law, whom she now hated mortally.    D'Artagnan thought of all these matters. He remembered how at the Louvre  he had often seen, as she passed by him in the full radiance of her  dazzling charms, the beautiful Madame de Longueville. He thought of  Aramis, who, without possessing any greater advantages than himself, had  formerly been the lover of Madame de Chevreuse, who "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12590"],[0,"The Shadow of the Rope (#14)"],[1,"what I wish you to do,\" Steel rejoined quietly, even  gently, his hand lying lightly but kindly upon her quivering shoulder.  How strong his touch, how firm, how reassuring! It was her first contact  with his hand.    \"I wish it so much,\" he went on, \"that I would have your past life  utterly buried, even between ourselves; nay, if it were possible, even  in your own mind also! I, for my part, would undertake never to ask you  one solitary question about that life--on one small and only fair  condition. Supposing we make a compact now?\"    \"Anything to bury my own past,\" owned Rachel; \"yes, I would do  anything--anything!\"    \"Then you must help me to bury mine, too,\" he said. \"I was never  married, but a past I have.\"    \"I would do my best,\" said Rachel, \"if I married you.\"    \"You will do your best,\" added Steel, correcting her; \"and there is my  compact cut and dried. I ask you nothing; you ask me nothing; and there  is to be no question of love between us, first or last. But we help each  other to forget--from this day forth!\"    Rachel could not speak; his eyes were upon her, black, inscrutable,  arrestive of her very faculties, to say nothing of her will. She could  only answer him when he had turned away and was moving towards the door.    \"Where are you going?\" she cried.    \"To send to my solicitor,\" replied Steel, \"as I warned him that I might.  It has all to be drawn up; and there is the question of a settlement;  and other questions, perhaps, which you may like to put to him yourself  without delay.\"          CHAPTER IX    A CHANGE OF SCENE      The Reverend Hugh Woodgate, Vicar of Marley-in-Delverton--a benefice for  generations in the gift of the Dukes of Normanthorpe, but latterly in  that of one John Buchanan Steel--was writing his sermon on a Friday  afternoon just six months after the foregoing events. The month was  therefore May, and, at either end of the long, low room in which Mr.  Woodgate sat at work, the windows were filled with a flutter of summer  curtains against a brilliant background of waving greenery. But a fire  burned in one of the two fireplaces in the old-fashioned funnel of a  room, for a treacherous east wind skimmed the sunlit earth outside, and  whistled and sang through one window as the birds did through the other.    Mr. Woodgate was a tall, broad-shouldered, mild-eyed man, with a blot of  whisker under each ear, and the cleanest of clerical collars  encompassing his throat. It was a kindly face that pored over the  unpretentious periods, as they grew by degrees upon the blue-lined  paper, in the peculiar but not uncommon hand which is the hall-mark of  a certain sort of education upon a certain order of mind. The present  specimen was perhaps more methodical than most; therein it was  characteristic of the man. From May to September, Mr. Woodgate never  failed to finish his sermon on the Friday, that on the Saturday he might  be free to play cricket with his men and lads. He was a poor preacher  and no cricketer at all; but in both branches he did his best, with the  simple zeal and the unconscious sincerity which redeemed not a few of  his deficiencies.    So intent was the vicar upon his task, so engrossed in the expression of  that which had already been expressed many a million times, that he did  not hear wheels in his drive, on the side where the wind sang loudest;  he heard nothing until the door opened, and a girl in her twenties,  trim, slim, and brown with health, came hurriedly in.    \"I'm sorry to disturb you, dear, but who do you think is here?\"    Hugh Woodgate turned round in his chair, and his honest ox-eyes filled  with open admiration of the wife who was so many years younger than  himself, and who had seen in him Heaven knew what! He never could look  at her without that look first; and only now, after some years of  marriage, was he beginning sometimes to do so without this thought  next. But he had not the gift of expression, even in the perpetual  matter of his devotion; and perhaps its perpetuity owed something to  that very want; at least there was none of the verbal evaporation which  comes of too much lovers' talk.    \"Who is it?\" he asked.    \"Mrs. Venables!\"    Woodgate groaned. Was he obliged to appear? His jaw fell, and his wife's  eyes sparkled.    \"Dear, I wouldn't even have let you know she was here--you shouldn't  have been interrupted for a single instant--if Mrs. Venables wasn't  clamoring to see you. And really I begin to clamor too; for she is full  of some mysterious news, which she won't tell me till you are there to  hear it also. Be an angel, for five minutes!\"    Woodgate wiped his pen in his deliberate way.    \"Probably one of the girls is engaged,\" said he; \"if so I hope it's  Sybil.\"    \"No, Sybil is here too; she doesn't look a bit engaged, but rather  bored, as though she had heard the story several times already, whatever  it may be. They have certainly paid several calls. Now you look quite  nice, so in you come.\"    Mrs. Venables, a stout but comely lady, with a bright brown eye, and a  face full of character and ability, opened fire upon the vicar as soon  as they had shaken hands, while her daughter looked wistfully at the  nearest books.    \"He is married!\" cried Mrs. Venables, beginning in the middle like a  modern novelist.    \"Indeed?\" returned the matter-of-fact clergyman, with equal  directness--\"and who is he?\"    \"Your neighbor and your patron--Mr. Steel!\"    \"Married?\" repeated Mrs. Woodgate, with tremendous emphasis. \"Mr.  Steel?\"    \"This is news!\" declared her husband, as though he had expected none  worthy of the name. And they both demanded further particulars, at which  Mrs. Venables shook her expensive bonnet with great relish.    \"Do you know Mr. Steel so well--so much better than we do--and can you  ask for particulars about anything he ever does? His marriage,\"  continued Mrs. Venables, \"like everything else about him, is 'wrop in  mystery,' as one of those vulgar creatures says in Dickens, but I really  forget which. It was never announced in the _Times_; for that I can  vouch myself. Was ever anything more like him, or less like anybody  else? To disappear for six months, and then turn up with a wife!\"    \"But has he turned up?\" cried the vicar's young wife, forgetting for a  moment a certain preoccupation caused by the arrival of the tea-tray,  and by a rapid resignation to the thickness of the bread and butter and  the distressing absence of such hot things as would have been in  readiness if Mrs. Venables had been expected for a single moment. It  showed the youth of Morna Woodgate that she should harbor a wish to  compete with the wealthiest woman in the neighborhood, even in the  matter of afternoon tea, and her breeding that no such thought was  legible in her clear-cut open-air face.    \"I have heard nothing about it,\" said the vicar, in a tone indicative of  much honest doubt in the matter.    \"Nor is it the case, to my knowledge,\" rejoined Mrs. Venables; \"but from  all we hear it may become the case any moment. They were married in  Italy last autumn--so he says--and are on their way home at this  minute.\"    \"If he says so,\" observed the vicar, with mild humor, \"it is probably  true. He ought to know.\"    \"And who was she?\" his young wife asked with immense interest, the cups  having gone round, and the bread and butter been accepted in spite of  its proportions.    \"My dear Mrs. Woodgate,\" said Mrs. Venables, cordially, \"you may well  ask! Who was she, indeed! It was the first question I asked my own  informant, who, by the way, was your friend, Mr. Langholm; but he knew  no more than the man in the moon.\"    \"And who told Mr. Langholm, of all people?\" pursued Morna Woodgate. \"It  is not often that we get news of the real world from him!\"    \"Birds of a feather,\" remarked her caller: \"it was Mr. Steel himself who  wrote to your other eccentric friend, and told him neither more nor less  than I have told you. He was married in Italy last autumn; not even the  town--not even the month--let alone the lady's name--if, indeed--\"    And Mrs. Venables concluded with a sufficiently eloquent hiatus.    \"I imagine she is a lady,\" said the vicar to his tea.    \"You are so charitable, dear Mr. Woodgate!\"    \"I hope I am,\" he said simply. \"In this case I see no reason to be  anything else.\"    \"What--when you know really nothing about Mr. Steel himself?\"    And the bright brown eyes of Mrs. Venables grew smaller and harder as  they pinned Hugh Woodgate to his chair.    \"I beg your pardon,\" said that downright person; \"I know a great deal  about Mr. Steel. He has done an immense amount for the parish; there  are our new schoolrooms to speak for themselves. There are very few who  would do the half of what Mr. Steel has done for us during the short  time he has been at Normanthorpe.\"    \"That may be,\" said the lady, with the ample smile of conscious  condescension; \"for he has certainly not omitted to let his light shine  before men. But that is not telling us who or what he was before he came  here, or how he made his money.\"    Then Hugh Woodgate gave the half boyish, half bashful laugh with which  he was wont to preface his most candid sayings.    \"And I don't think it's any business of ours,\" he said.    Morna went a trifle browner than she naturally was; her husband said so  little that what he did say was often almost painfully to the point; and  now Mrs. Venables had turned from him to her, with a smile which the  young wife disliked, for it called attention to the vicar's discourtesy  while it appealed to herself for prettier manners and better sense. It  was a moment requiring some little tact, but Mrs. Woodgate was just  equal to it.    \"Hugh, how rude of you!\" she exclaimed, with only the suspicion of a  smile. \"You forget that it's your duty to be friendly with everybody;  there's no such obligation on anybody else.\"    \"I should be friendly with Mr. Steel,\" said Hugh, \"duty"]]]
