Outside he was called Jack Hollis, which was his real name.\"    Terence rose from his chair, more colorless than ever, the knuckles of  one hand resting upon the table. He seemed very tall, years older, grim.    \"Terry!\" called Elizabeth Cornish softly.    It was like speaking to a stone.    \"Gentlemen,\" said Terry, though his eyes never left the face of the  sheriff, and it was obvious that he was making his speech to one pair of  ears alone. \"I have been living among you under the name of Colby--  Terence Colby. It seems an appropriate moment to say that this is not my  name. After what the sheriff has just told you it may be of interest to  know that my real name is Hollis. Terence Hollis is my name and my father  was Jack Hollis, commonly known as Black Jack, it seems from the story of  the sheriff. I also wish to say that I am announcing my parentage not  because I wish to apologize for it--in spite of the rather remarkable  narrative of the sheriff--but because I am proud of it.\"    He lifted his head while he spoke. And his eye went boldly, calmly down  the table.    \"This could not have been expected before, because none of you knew my  father's name. I confess that I did not know it myself until a very short  time ago. Otherwise I should not have listened to the sheriff's story  until the end. Hereafter, however, when any of you are tempted to talk  about Black or Jack Hollis, remember that his son is alive--and in good  health!\"    He hung in his place for an instant as though he were ready to hear a  reply. But the table was stunned. Then Terry turned on his heel and left  the room.    It was the signal for a general upstarting from the table, a pushing back  of chairs, a gathering around Elizabeth Cornish. She was as white as  Terry had been while he talked. But there was a gathering excitement in  her eye, and happiness. The sheriff was full of apologies. He would  rather have had his tongue torn out by the roots than to have offended  her or the young man with his story.    She waved the sheriff's apology aside. It was unfortunate, but it could  not have been helped. They all realized that. She guided her guests into  the living room, and on the way she managed to drift close to her  brother.    Her eyes were on fire with her triumph.    \"You heard, Vance? You saw what he did?\"    There was a haunted look about the face of Vance, who had seen his high-  built schemes topple about his head.    \"He did even better than I expected, Elizabeth. Thank heaven for it!\"        CHAPTER 13      Terence Hollis had gone out of the room and up the stairs like a man  stunned or walking in his sleep. Not until he stepped into the familiar  room did the blood begin to return to his face, and with the warmth there  was a growing sensation of uneasiness.    Something was wrong. Something had to be righted. Gradually his mind  cleared. The thing that was wrong was that the man who had killed his  father was now under the same roof with him, had shaken his hand, had sat  in bland complacency and looked in his face and told of the butchery.    Butchery it was, according to Terry's standards. For the sake of the  price on the head of the outlaw, young Minter had shoved his rifle across  a window sill, taken his aim, and with no risk to himself had shot down  the wild rider. His heart stood up in his throat with revulsion at the  thought of it. Murder, horrible, and cold-blooded, the more horrible  because it was legal.    Something had to be done. What was it?    And when he turned, what he saw was the gun cabinet with a shimmer of  light on the barrels. Then he knew. He selected his favorite Colt and  drew it out. It was loaded, and the action in perfect condition. Many and  many an hour he had practiced and blazed away hundreds of rounds of  ammunition with it. It responded to his touch like a muscular part of his  own body.    He shoved it under his coat, and walking down the stairs again the chill  of the steel worked through to his flesh. He went back to the kitchen and  called out Wu Chi. The latter came shuffling in his slippers, nodding,  grinning in anticipation of compliments.    \"Wu,\" came the short demand, \"can you keep your mouth shut and do what  you're told to do?\"    \"Wu try,\" said the Chinaman, grave as a yellow image instantly.    \"Then go to the living room and tell Mr. Gainor and Sheriff Minter that  Mr. Harkness is waiting for them outside and wishes to see them on  business of the most urgent nature. It will only be the matter of a  moment. Now go. Gainor and the sheriff. Don't forget.\"    He received a scared glance, and then went out onto the veranda and sat  down to wait.    That was the right way, he felt. His father would have called the sheriff  to the door, in a similar situation, and after one brief challenge they  would have gone for their guns. But there was another way, and that was  the way of the Colbys. Their way was right. They lived like gentlemen,  and, above all, they fought always like gentlemen.    Presently the screen door opened, squeaked twice, and then closed with a  hum of the screen as it slammed. Steps approached him. He got up from the  chair and faced them, Gainor and the sheriff. The sheriff had  instinctively put on his hat, like a man who does not understand the open  air with an uncovered head. But Gainor was uncovered, and his white hair  glimmered.    He was a tall, courtly old fellow. His ceremonious address had won him  much political influence. Men said that Gainor was courteous to a dog,  not because he respected the dog, but because he wanted to practice for a  man. He had always the correct rejoinder, always did the right thing. He  had a thin, stern face and a hawk nose that gave him a cast of ferocity  in certain aspects.    It was to him that Terry addressed himself.    \"Mr. Gainor,\" he said, \"I'm sorry to have sent in a false message. But my  business is very urgent, and I have a very particular reason for not  wishing to have it known that I have called you out.\"    The moment he rose out of the chair and faced them, Gainor had stopped  short. He was quite capable of fast thinking, and now his glance  flickered from Terry to the sheriff and back again. It was plain that he  had shrewd suspicions as to the purpose behind that call. The sheriff was  merely confused. He flushed as much as his tanned-leather skin permitted.  As for Terry, the moment his glance fell on the sheriff he felt his  muscles jump into hard ridges, and an almost uncontrollable desire to go  at the throat of the other seized him. He quelled that desire and fought  it back with a chill of fear.    \"My father's blood working out!\" he thought to himself.    And he fastened his attention on Mr. Gainor and tried to shut the picture  of the sheriff out of his brain. But the desire to leap at the tall man  was as consuming as the passion for water in the desert. And with a  shudder of horror he found himself without a moral scruple. Just behind  the thin partition of his will power there was a raging fury to get at  Joe Minter. He wanted to kill. He wanted to snuff that life out as the  life of Black Jack Hollis had been snuffed.    He excluded the sheriff deliberately from his attention and turned fully  upon Gainor.    \"Mr. Gainor, will you be kind enough to go over to that grove of spruce  where the three of us can talk without any danger of interruption?\"    Of course, that speech revealed everything. Gainor stiffened a little and  the tuft of beard which ran down to a point on his chin quivered and  jutted out. The sheriff seemed to feel nothing more than a mild surprise  and curiosity. And the three went silently, side by side, under the  spruce. They were glorious trees, strong of trunk and nobly proportioned.  Their tops were silver-bright in the sunshine. Through the lower branches  the light was filtered through layer after layer of shadow, until on the  ground there were only a few patches of light here and there, and these  were no brighter than silver moonshine, and seemed to be without heat.  Indeed, in the mild shadow among the trees lay the chill of the mountain  air which seems to lurk in covert places waiting for the night.    It might have been this chill that made Terry button his coat closer  about him and tremble a little as he entered the shadow. The great trunks  shut out the world in a scattered wall. There was a narrow opening here  among the trees at the very center. The three were in a sort of gorge of  which the solemn spruce trees furnished the sides, the cold blue of the  mountain skies was just above the lofty tree-tips, and the wind kept the  pure fragrance of the evergreens stirring about them. The odor is the  soul of the mountains. A great surety had come to Terry that this was the  last place he would ever see on earth. He was about to die, and he was  glad, in a dim sort of way, that he should die in a place so beautiful.  He looked at the sheriff, who stood calm but puzzled, and at Gainor, who  was very grave, indeed, and returned his look with one of infinite pity,  as though he knew and understood and acquiesced, but was deeply grieved  that it must be so.    \"Gentlemen,\" said Terry, making his voice light and cheerful as he felt  that the voice of a Colby should be at such a time, being about to die,  \"I suppose you understand why I have asked you to come here?\"    \"Yes,\" nodded Gainor.    \"But I'm damned if I do,\" said the sheriff frankly.    Terry looked upon him coldly. He felt that he had not the slightest  chance of killing this professional manslayer, but at least he would do  his best--for the sake of Black Jack's memory. But to think that his  life--his mind--his soul--all that was dear to him and all that he was  dear to, should ever lie at the command of the trigger of this hard,  crafty, vain, and unimportant fellow! He writhed at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9932"],[0,"The Last Trail (#13)"],[1,"to  meet, the outlook was far-reaching and grand.    Below the gray, splintered cliffs sheered down to meet the waving  tree-tops, and then hill after hill, slope after slope, waved and  rolled far, far down to the green river. Open grassy patches, bright  little islands in that ocean of dark green, shone on the hillsides.  The rounded ridges ran straight, curved, or zigzag, but shaped their  graceful lines in the descent to make the valley. Long, purple-hued,  shadowy depressions in the wide expanse of foliage marked deep clefts  between ridges where dark, cool streams bounded on to meet the river.  Lower, where the land was level, in open spaces could be seen a broad  trail, yellow in the sunlight, winding along with the curves of the  water-course. On a swampy meadow, blue in the distance, a herd of  buffalo browsed. Beyond the river, high over the green island, Fort  Henry lay peaceful and solitary, the only token of the works of man in  all that vast panorama.    Jonathan Zane was as much alone as if one thousand miles, instead of  five, intervened between him and the settlement. Loneliness was to him  a passion. Other men loved home, the light of woman's eyes, the rattle  of dice or the lust of hoarding; but to him this wild, remote  promontory, with its limitless view, stretching away to the dim hazy  horizon, was more than all the aching joys of civilization.    Hours here, or in the shady valley, recompensed him for the loss of  home comforts, the soft touch of woman's hands, the kiss of baby lips,  and also for all he suffered in his pitiless pursuits, the hard fare,  the steel and blood of a borderman's life.    Soon the sun shone straight overhead, dwarfing the shadow of the  chestnut on the rock.    During such a time it was rare that any connected thought came into  the borderman's mind. His dark eyes, now strangely luminous, strayed  lingeringly over those purple, undulating slopes. This intense  watchfulness had no object, neither had his listening. He watched  nothing; he hearkened to the silence. Undoubtedly in this state of  rapt absorption his perceptions were acutely alert; but without  thought, as were those of the savage in the valley below, or the eagle  in the sky above.    Yet so perfectly trained were these perceptions that the least  unnatural sound or sight brought him wary and watchful from his  dreamy trance.    The slight snapping of a twig in the thicket caused him to sit erect,  and reach out toward his rifle. His eyes moved among the dark openings  in the thicket. In another moment a tall figure pressed the bushes  apart. Jonathan let fall his rifle, and sank back against the tree  once more. Wetzel stepped over the rocks toward him.    \"Come from Blue Pond?\" asked Jonathan as the newcomer took a seat  beside him.    Wetzel nodded as he carefully laid aside his long, black rifle.    \"Any Injun sign?\" continued Jonathan, pushing toward his companion the  knapsack of eatables he had brought from the settlement.    \"Nary Shawnee track west of this divide,\" answered Wetzel, helping  himself to bread and cheese.    \"Lew, we must go eastward, over Bing Legget's way, to find the trail  of the stolen horses.\"    \"Likely, an' it'll be a long, hard tramp.\"    \"Who's in Legget's gang now beside Old Horse, the Chippewa, an' his  Shawnee pard, Wildfire? I don't know Bing; but I've seen some of his  Injuns an' they remember me.\"    \"Never seen Legget but onct,\" replied Wetzel, \"an' that time I shot  half his face off. I've been told by them as have seen him since, that  he's got a nasty scar on his temple an' cheek. He's a big man an'  knows the woods. I don't know who all's in his gang, nor does anybody.  He works in the dark, an' for cunnin' he's got some on Jim Girty,  Deerin', an' several more renegades we know of lyin' quiet back here  in the woods. We never tackled as bad a gang as his'n; they're all  experienced woodsmen, old fighters, an' desperate, outlawed as they be  by Injuns an' whites. It wouldn't surprise me to find that it's him  an' his gang who are runnin' this hoss-thievin'; but bad or no, we're  goin' after 'em.\"    Jonathan told of his movements since he had last seen his companion.    \"An' the lass Helen is goin' to help us,\" said Wetzel, much  interested. \"It's a good move. Women are keen. Betty put Miller's  schemin' in my eye long 'afore I noticed it. But girls have chances we  men'd never get.\"    \"Yes, an' she's like Betts, quicker'n lightnin'. She'll find out this  hoss-thief in Fort Henry; but Lew, when we do get him we won't be much  better off. Where do them hosses go? Who's disposin' of 'em for  this fellar?\"    \"Where's Brandt from?\" asked Wetzel.    \"Detroit; he's a French-Canadian.\"    Wetzel swung sharply around, his eyes glowing like wakening furnaces.    \"Bing Legget's a French-Canadian, an' from Detroit. Metzar was once  thick with him down Fort Pitt way 'afore he murdered a man an' became  an outlaw. We're on the trail, Jack.\"    \"Brandt an' Metzar, with Legget backin' them, an' the horses go  overland to Detroit?\"    \"I calkilate you've hit the mark.\"    \"What'll we do?\" asked Jonathan.    \"Wait; that's best. We've no call to hurry. We must know the truth  before makin' a move, an' as yet we're only suspicious. This lass'll  find out more in a week than we could in a year. But Jack, have a care  she don't fall into any snare. Brandt ain't any too honest a lookin'  chap, an' them renegades is hell for women. The scars you wear prove  that well enough. She's a rare, sweet, bloomin' lass, too. I never  seen her equal. I remember how her eyes flashed when she said she knew  I'd avenged Mabel. Jack, they're wonderful eyes; an' that girl,  however sweet an' good as she must be, is chain-lightnin' wrapped up  in a beautiful form. Aren't the boys at the fort runnin' arter her?\"    \"Like mad; it'd make you laugh to see 'em,\" replied Jonathan calmly.    \"There'll be some fights before she's settled for, an' mebbe arter  thet. Have a care for her, Jack, an' see that she don't ketch you.\"    \"No more danger than for you.\"    \"I was ketched onct,\" replied Wetzel.    Jonathan Zane looked up at his companion. Wetzel's head was bowed; but  there was no merriment in the serious face exposed to the  borderman's scrutiny.    \"Lew, you're jokin'.\"    \"Not me. Some day, when you're ketched good, an' I have to go back to  the lonely trail, as I did afore you an' me become friends, mebbe  then, when I'm the last borderman, I'll tell you.\"    \"Lew, 'cordin' to the way settlers are comin', in a few more years  there won't be any need for a borderman. When the Injuns are all gone  where'll be our work?\"    \"'Tain't likely either of us'll ever see them times,\" said Wetzel,  \"an' I don't want to. Wal, Jack, I'm off now, an' I'll meet you here  every other day.\"    Wetzel shouldered his long rifle, and soon passed out of sight down  the mountain-side.    Jonathan arose, shook himself as a big dog might have done, and went  down into the valley. Only once did he pause in his descent, and that  was when a crackling twig warned him some heavy body was moving near.  Silently he sank into the bushes bordering the trail. He listened with  his ear close to the ground. Presently he heard a noise as of two hard  substances striking together. He resumed his walk, having recognized  the grating noise of a deer-hoof striking a rock. Farther down he  espied a pair grazing. The buck ran into the thicket; but the doe eyed  him curiously.    Less than an hour's rapid walking brought him to the river. Here he  plunged into a thicket of willows, and emerged on a sandy strip of  shore. He carefully surveyed the river bank, and then pulled a small  birch-bark canoe from among the foliage. He launched the frail craft,  paddled across the river and beached it under a reedy, over-hanging bank.    The distance from this point in a straight line to his destination was  only a mile; but a rocky bluff and a ravine necessitated his making a  wide detour. While lightly leaping over a brook his keen eye fell on  an imprint in the sandy loam. Instantly he was on his knees. The  footprint was small, evidently a woman's, and, what was more unusual,  instead of the flat, round moccasin-track, it was pointed, with a  sharp, square heel. Such shoes were not worn by border girls. True  Betty and Nell had them; but they never went into the woods without  moccasins.    Jonathan's experienced eye saw that this imprint was not an hour old.  He gazed up at the light. The day was growing short. Already shadows  lay in the glens. He would not long have light enough to follow the  trail; but he hurried on hoping to find the person who made it before  darkness came. He had not traveled many paces before learning that the  one who made it was lost. The uncertainty in those hasty steps was as  plain to the borderman's eyes, as if it had been written in words on  the sand. The course led along the brook, avoiding the rough places;  and leading into the open glades and glens; but it drew no nearer to  the settlement. A quarter of an hour of rapid trailing enabled  Jonathan to discern a dark figure moving among the trees. Abandoning  the trail, he cut across a ridge to head off the lost woman. Stepping  out of a sassafras thicket, he came face to face with Helen Sheppard.    \"Oh!\" she cried in alarm, and then the expression of terror gave place  to one of extreme relief and gladness. \"Oh! Thank goodness! You've  found me. I'm lost!\"    \"I reckon,\" answered Jonathan grimly. \"The settlement's only five  hundred yards over that hill.\"    \"I was going the wrong way. Oh! suppose you hadn't come!\" exclaimed  Helen, sinking on a log and looking up at him with warm, glad eyes.    \"How did you lose your way?\" Jonathan asked. He saw neither the warmth  in her eyes nor the gladness.    \"I went up the hillside, only a little way, after flowers, keeping the  fort in sight all the time. Then I saw some lovely violets down a  little"]]]
