Sometimes the floor under her feet was smooth and polished as  a pane of glass, and sometimes it was rough and covered with hummocks  where the water had frozen in the wind. In Migwan's fancy this was not  the lake she was walking on; it was one of the great Swiss glaciers.  Those grey clouds there, standing out against the black ones, they were  the mountains, and she was taking her perilous journey through the  mountain pass. The ice cracked slightly under her feet, but she did not  notice. She was a Swiss guide, taking a party of tourists across the  glacier. Underneath this floor of ice were the bodies of those travelers  who had fallen into the crevices. She was telling the tourists the  stories of the famous disasters and they were shuddering at her tale.  The ice cracked again under her feet, but her mind, soaring in flights  of fancy, took no heed.    Her imagination took another turn. Now she was Mrs. Knollys, in the  famous story, waiting for the body of her husband to be given up by the  glacier. The long years of waiting passed and she stood at the foot of  the glacier watching the miracle unfold before her eyes. The glacier was  making queer cracking noises as it descended, and it sounded as though  there was water underneath it. She could hear it lapping.    C-R-A-C-K! A sound rang out on the still air that startled Migwan like  the report of a pistol, followed immediately by another. She came to her  senses with a rush. With hardly a moment's warning the ice on which she  was standing broke away from the main mass and began to move. Struck  motionless by fright, she had not the presence of mind to jump back to  the larger field. A wave washed in between, separating her by several  feet from the solid ice. The cake she was on began to heave and fall  sickeningly. There was another cracking sound and the edge of the solid  body of ice broke up into dozens of floating cakes, that ground and  pounded each other as the waves set them in motion. Every drop of blood  receded from Migwan's heart as she realized what had happened. She  screamed aloud, once, and then knew the futility of it. Her voice could  not reach to the shore. Lake and sky and horizon line now mocked her  with their silence. The cake of ice, lurching and tipping, began  floating out to sea.    On this wintry afternoon Sahwah left the house in a far different mood  from that which had carried Migwan blindly over the ground. Her eyes  were sparkling with the joy of life and her cheeks were glowing in the  cold. She wore a heavy reefer sweater and a knitted cap. Under her arm  was her latest plaything--a pair of skis. By her side walked Dick  Albright, one of the boys in her class, whom she considered especially  good fun. Dick also had a pair of skis. The two of them were bound for  the park to practice \"making descents\" from the hillsides. Sahwah was  absolutely happy, and chattered like one of the sparrows that were  flocking on the lawns and streets. Her chief interest in life just now  was the school basketball team, of which she was a member. Soon, very  soon, would come the big game with the Carnegie Mechanics, which would  decide the championship of the city. Sahwah was the star forward for the  Washington High team, and it was no secret that the winning of that game  depended upon her to a great extent. Sahwah was the idol of the  athletically inclined portion of the school. Dick thought there never  was such a player--for a girl.    Sahwah was full of basketball talk now, and made shrewd comments on the  good and bad points of both teams, weighing the chances of each with  great care. \"Mechanicals' center is shorter than ours; we have the  advantage there. One of their forwards is good and the other isn't, and  one of our guards is weak. On the whole, we're about evenly matched.\"    \"Fine chance Mechanicals'll have with you in the game,\" said Dick.    \"The only thing I'm afraid of,\" said Sahwah, with a thoughtful pucker,  \"is Marie Lanning; you know, Joe Lanning's cousin. She's to guard me and  she's a head taller.\"    \"Don't worry, you'll manage all right,\" said Dick. Sahwah laughed. It  was pleasant to be looked up to as the hope of the school. \"If you only  don't get sick,\" said Dick.    \"Don't be afraid,\" answered Sahwah. \"I won't get sick. But if I don't  get my Physics notebook finished by the First of February I'll not be  eligible for the game, and that's no joke. Fizzy said nobody would get a  passing grade this month who didn't have that old notebook finished, and  you know what that means.\"    \"There really isn't any danger of your not getting it in, is there?\"  asked Dick breathlessly.    \"Not if I keep at it,\" answered Sahwah, and Dick breathed easy again. To  allow yourself to be declared ineligible for a game on account of  studies when the school was depending on you to win that game would have  been a crime too awful to contemplate.    The snow on the hills in the park had a hard crust, which made it just  right for skiing. Sahwah and Dick made one descent after another,  sometimes tripping over the point of a ski and landing in a sprawling  heap, but more often sailing down in perfect form with a breathless  rush. \"That last leap of yours was a beauty,\" said Sahwah admiringly.    \"I think I'm learning,\" said Dick modestly.    \"I 'stump' you to go down the big hill on the lake front,\" said Sahwah,  her eyes sparkling with mischief.    Dick knew what that particular hill was like, but, boylike, he could not  refuse a dare given by a girl. \"Do you want to see me do it?\" he said  stoutly. \"All right, I will.\"    \"Don't,\" said Sahwah, frightened at what she had driven him to do;  \"you'll break your neck. I didn't really mean to dare you to do it.\" But  Dick had made up his mind to go down that cliff hill just to show Sahwah  that he could, and nothing could turn him aside now.    \"Come along,\" he said; \"I can make it.\" And he started off toward the  lake front at a brisk pace.    But when he had reached the top of the hill in question he stood still  and stared out over the lake. \"Hello,\" he said in surprise, \"there's  somebody having trouble out there on the ice.\" Sahwah came and stood  beside him, shading her eyes with her hand to see what was happening. At  that distance she did not recognize Migwan. \"The ice is breaking!\" cried  Dick, who was far-sighted and saw the girl on the floating ice cake.  Like a whirlwind he sped down the hillside, dropped over the edge of the  cliff like a plummet and shot nearly a hundred feet out over the glassy  surface of the lake. Without pausing an instant Sahwah was after him.  She had a dizzy sensation of falling off the earth when she made the  jump from the hillside, which was a greater distance than she had ever  dropped before, but it was over so quickly that she had no time to lose  her breath before she was on solid ground again and taking the long  slide over the lake. In a short time they reached the edge of the broken  ice.    \"Migwan!\" gasped Sahwah when she saw who the girl on the floating cake  was. They could not get very near her, as the edge of the solid mass was  continually breaking away, and there was a strip of moving pieces  between them and her. \"Fasten the skis together and make a long pole,\"  said Sahwah, \"and then she can take hold of one end of it and we can  pull her toward us,\" said Sahwah.    \"Good idea,\" said Dick, and proceeded to lash the long strips together  with the straps, aided by sundry strings and handkerchiefs.    Then there were several moments of suspense until Migwan came within  reach of the pole. She simply had to wait until she floated near enough  to grasp it, which the perverse ice cake seemed to have no intention of  doing. The right combination of wind and wave came at last, however, and  drove her in toward the shore. She was still beyond the end of the pole.  \"Jump onto the next cake,\" called Sahwah. Migwan obeyed in fear and  trembling. It took still another jump before she could reach the  lifesaver. She was now separated from the broken mass at the edge of the  solid ice by about six feet. With Migwan clinging fast to the pole Dick  began to pull in gently, so as not to pull her off the ice, and the cake  began to move across this open space until it was close beside the  nearer mass of broken pieces. Then, supported by the improvised hand  rail, Migwan leaped from one cake to the next, and so made her way back  to the solid part. It was an exciting process, for the pieces tipped and  heaved when she stepped on them, and bobbed up and down, and some turned  over just as her feet left them.    \"Eliza crossing the ice,\" said Sahwah, giggling nervously.    Migwan sank down exhausted when she felt the solid mass under her feet  and knew that the danger was over. She was chilled through and through,  and more than one wave had splashed over the floating ice while she was  on it and soaked her shoes and stockings. Sahwah took this in at a  glance. \"Get up,\" she said sharply, \"and run. Run all the way home if  you don't want to get pneumonia. It's your only chance.\" Taking hold of  her hands, Dick and Sahwah ran along beside her, making her keep up the  pace when she pleaded fatigue. More dead than alive she reached home,  but warm from head to foot. Sahwah rolled her in hot blankets and  administered hot drinks with a practiced hand. Neither Mrs. Gardiner nor  Betty were at home. Migwan soon dropped off to sleep, and woke feeling  entirely well. Thanks to Sahwah's taking her in hand she emerged from  the experience without even a sign of a cold.    With heroic patience and courage she began again the weary task of  typing and burning all the pages of Professor Green's book and finished  it this time without mishap. The money she received for it all went into  the family purse. Not a cent did she spend on herself.

To explain the elasticity of a gas was the primary object of the kinetic  theory of gases. This object is only attainable by the assumption of an  elasticity more complex in character, and more difficult of explanation,  than the elasticity of gases--the elasticity of a solid. Thus, even if the  fatal fault in the theory, to which I have alluded, did not exist, and if  we could be perfectly satisfied with the kinetic theory of gases founded on  the collisions of elastic solid molecules, there would still be beyond it a  grander theory which need not be considered a chimerical object of  scientific ambition--to explain the elasticity of solids. But we may be  stopped when we commence to look in the direction of such a theory with the  cynical question, What do you mean by explaining a property of matter? As  to being stopped by any such question, all I can say is that if engineering  were to be all and to end all physical science, we should perforce be  content with merely finding properties of matter by observation, and using  them for practical purposes. But I am sure very few, if any, engineers are  practically satisfied with so narrow a view of their noble profession. They  must and do patiently observe, and discover by observation, properties of  matter and results of material combinations. But deeper questions are  always present, and always fraught with interest to the true engineer, and  he will be the last to give weight to any other objection to any attempt to  see below the surface of things than the practical question, Is it likely  to prove wholly futile? But now, instead of imagining the question, What do  you mean by explaining a property of matter? to be put cynically, and  letting ourselves be irritated by it, suppose we give to the questioner  credit for being sympathetic, and condescend to try and answer his  question. We find it not very easy to do so. All the properties of matter  are so connected that we can scarcely imagine one _thoroughly explained_  without our seeing its relation to all the others, without in fact having  the explanation of all; and till we have this we cannot tell what we mean  by \"explaining a property\" or \"explaining the properties\" of matter. But  though this consummation may never be reached by man, the progress of  science may be, I believe will be, step by step toward it, on many  different roads converging toward it from all sides. The kinetic theory of  gases is, as I have said, a true step on one of the roads. On the very  distinct road of chemical science, St. Claire Deville arrived at his grand  theory of dissociation without the slightest aid from the kinetic theory of  gases. The fact that he worked it out solely from chemical observation and  experiment, and expounded it to the world without any hypothesis whatever,  and seemingly even without consciousness of the beautiful explanation it  has in the kinetic theory of gases, secured for it immediately an  independent solidity and importance as a chemical theory when he first  promulgated it, to which it might even by this time scarcely have attained  if it had first been suggested as a probability indicated by the kinetic  theory of gases, and been only afterward confirmed by observation. Now,  however, guided by the views which Clausius and Williamson have given us of  the continuous interchange of partners between the compound molecules  constituting chemical compounds in the gaseous state, we see in Deville's  theory of dissociation a point of contact of the most transcendent interest  between the chemical and physical lines of scientific progress.    To return to elasticity: if we could make out of matter devoid of  elasticity a combined system of relatively moving parts which, in virtue of  motion, has the essential characteristics of an elastic body, this would  surely be, if not positively a step in the kinetic theory of matter, at  least a fingerpost pointing a way which we may hope will lead to a kinetic  theory of matter. Now this, as I have already shown,[1] we can do in  several ways. In the case of the last of the communications referred to, of  which only the title has hitherto been published, I showed that, from the  mathematical investigation of a gyrostatically dominated combination  contained in the passage of Thomson and Tait's \"Natural Philosophy\"  referred to, it follows that any ideal system of material particles, acting  on one another mutually through massless connecting springs, may be  perfectly imitated in a model consisting of rigid links jointed together,  and having rapidly rotating fly wheels pivoted on some or on all of the  links. The imitation is not confined to cases of equilibrium. It holds also  for vibration produced by disturbing the system infinitesimally from a  position of stable equilibrium and leaving it to itself. Thus we may make a  gyrostatic system such that it is in equilibrium under the influence of  certain positive forces applied to different points of this system; all the  forces being precisely the same as, and the points of application similarly  situated to, those of the stable system with springs. Then, provided proper  masses (that is to say, proper amounts and distributions of inertia) be  attributed to the links, we may remove the external forces from each  system, and the consequent vibration of the points of application of the  forces will be identical. Or we may act upon the systems of material points  and springs with any given forces for any given time, and leave it to  itself, and do the same thing for the gyrostatic system; the consequent  motion will be the same in the two cases. If in the one case the springs  are made more and more stiff, and in the other case the angular velocities  of the fly wheels are made greater and greater, the periods of the  vibrational constituents of the motion will become shorter and shorter, and  the amplitudes smaller and smaller, and the motions will approach more and  more nearly those of two perfectly rigid groups of material points moving  through space and rotating according to the well known mode of rotation of  a rigid body having unequal moments of inertia about its three principal  axes. In one case the ideal nearly rigid connection between the particles  is produced by massless, exceedingly stiff springs; in the other case it is  produced by the exceedingly rapid rotation of the fly wheels in a system  which, when the fly wheels are deprived of their rotation, is perfectly  limp.

February. 1867:  abstract of a lecture before the Royal Institution of Great Britain, March  4, 1881, on \"Elasticity Viewed as possibly a Mode of Motion\"; Thomson and  Tait's \"Natural Philosophy,\" second edition, part 1, Sec.Sec. 345 viii. to 345  xxxvii.; \"On Oscillation and Waves in an Adynamic Gyrostatic System\" (title  only), _Proc_. R.S.E. March, 1883.]    The drawings (Figs. 1 and 2) before you illustrate two such material  systems.[1] The directions of rotation of the fly-wheels in the gyrostatic  system (Fig. 2) are indicated by directional ellipses, which show in  perspective the direction of rotation of the fly-wheel of each gyrostat.  The gyrostatic system (Fig. 2) might have been constituted of two  gyrostatic members, but four are shown for symmetry. The inclosing circle  represents in each case in section an inclosing spherical shell to prevent  the interior from being seen. In the inside of one there are fly-wheels, in  the inside of the other a massless spring. The projecting hooked rods seem  as if they are connected by a spring in each case. If we hang any one of  the systems up by the hook on one of its projecting rods, and hang a weight  to the hook of the other projecting rod, the weight, when first put on,  will oscillate up and down, and will go on doing so for ever if the system  be absolutely unfrictional. If we check the vibration by hand, the weight  will hang down at rest, the pin drawn out to a certain degree; and the  distance drawn out will be simply proportional to the weight hung on, as in  an ordinary spring balance.    [Footnote 1: In Fig. 1 the two hooked rods seen projecting from the sphere  are connected by an elastic coach-spring. In Fig. 2 the hooked rods are  connected one to each of two opposite corners of a four-sided jointed  frame, each member of which carries a gyrostat so that the axis of rotation  of the fly-wheel is in the axis of the member of the frame which bears it.  Each of the hooked rods in Fig. 2 is connected to the framework through a  swivel joint, so that the whole gyrostatic framework may be rotated about  the axis of the hooked rods in order to annul the moment of momentum of the  framework about this axis due to rotation of the fly-wheels in the  gyrostat.]    [Illustration: FIG. 1]    [Illustration: FIG. 2]    Here, then, out of matter possessing rigidity, but absolutely devoid of  elasticity, we have made a perfect model of a spring in the form of a  spring balance. Connect millions of millions of particles by pairs of rods  such as these of this spring balance, and we have a group of particles  constituting an elastic solid; exactly fulfilling the mathematical ideal  worked out by Navier, Poisson, and Cauchy, and many other mathematicians,  who, following their example, have endeavored to found a theory of the  elasticity of solids on mutual attraction and repulsion between a group of  material particles. All that can possibly be done by this theory, with its  assumption of forces acting according to any assumed law of relation to  distance, is done by the gyrostatic system. But the gyrostatic system does,  besides, what the system of naturally acting material particles cannot  do--it constitutes an elastic solid which can have the Faraday"]]]
