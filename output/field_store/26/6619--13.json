This cheese is made  between Michaelmas and Alhallontide.    _To make a Slip-coat Cheese_:--Take new milk and runnet, quite cold,  and when 'tis come, break it as little as you can in putting it into  the cheese-fat, and let it stand and whey itself for some time; then  cover it, and set about two pound weight on it, and when it will hold  together, turn it out of that cheese-fat, and keep it turning upon  clean cheese-fats for two or three days, till it has done wetting,  and then lay it on sharp-pointed dock-leaves till 'tis ripe: shift the  leaves often.    _To make a New-market Cheese to cut at two Years old_:--Any morning  in September, take twenty quarts of new milk warm from the cow, and  colour it with marigolds: when this is done, and the milk not cold,  get ready a quart of cream, and a quart of fair water, which must be  kept stirring over the fire till 'tis scalding hot, then stir it well  into the milk and runnet, as you do other cheese; when 'tis come, lay  cheese-cloths over it, and settle it with your hands; the more hands  the better; as the whey rises, take it away, and when 'tis clean gone,  put the curd into your fat, breaking it as little as you can; then put  it in the press, and press it gently an hour; take it out again, and  cut it in thin slices, and lay them singly on a cloth, and wipe them  dry; then put it in a tub, and break it with your hands as small as  you can, and mix with it a good handful of salt, and a quart of cold  cream; put it in the fat, and lay a pound weight on it till next day;  then press and order it as others.      V.--CAKES.    _To make Shrewsbury Cakes_:--Take to one pound of sugar, three pounds  of the finest flour, a nutmeg grated, some beaten cinamon; the sugar  and spice must be sifted into the flour, and wet it with three eggs,  and as much melted butter, as will make it of a good thickness to roll  into a paste; mould it well and roll it, and cut it into what shape  you please. Perfume them, and prick them before they go into the oven.    _To make Whetstone Cakes_:--Take half a pound of fine flour, and half  a pound of loaf sugar searced, a spoonful of carraway-seeds dried,  the yolk of one egg, the whites of three, a little rose-water, with  ambergrease dissolved in it; mix it together, and roll it out as thin  as a wafer; cut them with a glass; lay them on flour'd paper, and bake  them in a slow oven.    _To make Portugal Cakes_:--Take a pound and a quarter of fine flour  well dried, and break a pound of butter into the flour and rub it in,  add a pound of loaf-sugar beaten and sifted, a nutmeg grated, four  perfumed plums, or some ambergrease; mix these well together, and  beat seven eggs, but four whites, with three spoonfuls of  orange-flower-water; mix all these together, and beat them up an hour;  butter your little pans, and just as they are going into the oven,  fill them half full, and searce some fine sugar over them; little more  than a quarter of an hour will bake them. You may put a handful of  currants into some of them; take them out of the pans as soon as they  are drawn, keep them dry, they will keep good three months.    _To make Jumbals_:--Take the whites of three eggs, beat them well, and  take off the froth; then take a little milk, and a little flour, near  a pound, as much sugar sifted, a few carraway-seeds beaten very fine;  work all these in a very stiff paste, and make them into what form you  please bake them on white paper.    _To make March-pane_:--Take a pound of Jordan almonds, blanch and beat  them in a marble mortar very fine; then put to them three-quarters  of a pound of double-refin'd sugar, and beat with them a few drops of  orange-flower-water; beat all together till 'tis a very good paste,  then roll it into what shape you please; dust a little fine sugar  under it as you roll it to keep it from sticking. To ice it, searce  double-refined sugar as fine as flour, wet it with rose-water, and mix  it well together, and with a brush or bunch of feathers spread it  over your march-pane: bake them in an oven that is not too hot: put  wafer-paper at the bottom, and white paper under that, so keep them  for use.    _To make the Marlborough Cake_:--Take eight eggs, yolks and whites,  beat and strain them, and put to them a pound of sugar beaten and  sifted; beat it three-quarters of an hour together; then put in  three-quarters of a pound of flour well dried, and two ounces of  carraway-seeds; beat it all well together, and bake it in a quick oven  in broad tin-pans.    _To make Wormwood Cakes_:--Take one pound of double-refin'd sugar  sifted; mix it with the whites of three or four eggs well beat; into  this drop as much chymical oil of wormwood as you please. So drop them  on paper; you may have some white, and some marble, with specks of  colours, with the point of a pin; keep your colours severally in  little gallipots. For red, take a dram of cochineel, a little cream of  tartar, as much of allum; tye them up severally in little bits of fine  cloth, and put them to steep in one glass of water two or three hours.  When you use the colour, press the bags in the water, and mix some  of it with a little of the white of egg and sugar. Saffron colours  yellow; and must be tyed in a cloth, as the red, and put in water.  Powder-blue, mix'd with the saffron-water, makes a green; for blue,  mix some dry powder-blue with some water.    _A French Cake to eat hot_:--Take a dozen of eggs, and a quart of  cream, and as much flour as will make it into a thick batter; put to  it a pound of melted butter, half a pint of sack, one nutmeg grated,  mix it well, and let it stand three or four hours; then bake it in  a quick oven, and when you take it out, split it in two, and pour a  pound of butter on it melted with rose-water; cover it with the other  half, and serve it up hot.    _To make the thin Dutch Bisket_:--Take five pounds of flour, and two  ounces of carraway-seeds, half a pound of sugar, and something more  than a pint of milk. Warm the milk, and put into it three-quarters of  a pound of butter; then make a hole in the middle of your flour, and  put in a full pint of good ale-yeast; then pour in the butter and  milk, and make these into a paste, and let it stand a quarter of an  hour by the fire to rise; then mould it, and roll it into cakes pretty  thin; prick them all over pretty much or they will blister; so bake  them a quarter of an hour.    _To make Dutch Ginger-bread_:--Take four pounds of flour, and mix with  it two ounces and a half of beaten ginger; then rub in a quarter of  a pound of butter, and add to it two ounces of carraway-seeds,  two ounces of orange-peel dried and rubb'd to powder, a few  coriander-seeds bruised, two eggs: then mix all up in a stiff paste,  with two pounds and a quarter of treacle; beat it very well with  a rolling-pin, and make it up into thirty cakes; put in a candied  citron; prick them with a fork: butter papers three double, one white,  and two brown; wash them over with the white of an egg; put them into  an oven not too hot, for three-quarters of an hour.    _To make Cakes of Flowers_:--Boil double-refin'd sugar candy-high, and  then strew in your flowers, and let them boil once up; then with your  hand lightly strew in a little double-refin'd sugar sifted; and then  as quick as may be, put it into your little pans, made of card, and  pricked full of holes at bottom. You must set the pans on a pillow, or  cushion; when they are cold, take them out.      VI.--CAUDLES AND POSSETS.    _To make a Posset with Ale: King-William's Posset_:--Take a quart of  cream, and mix with it a pint of ale, then beat the yolks of ten eggs,  and the whites of four; when they are well beaten, put them to the  cream and ale, sweeten it to your taste, and slice some nutmeg in it;  set it over the fire, and keep it stirring all the while, and when  'tis thick, and before it boils, take it off, and pour it into the  bason you serve it in to the table.    _To make the Pope's Posset_:--Blanch and beat three-quarters of a  pound of almonds so fine, that they will spread between your fingers  like butter, put in water as you beat them to keep them from oiling;  then take a pint of sack or sherry, and sweeten it very well with  double-refin'd sugar, make it boiling hot, and at the same time put  half a pint of water to your almonds, and make them boil; then take  both off the fire, and mix them very well together with a spoon; serve  it in a china dish.    _To make Flummery Caudle_:--Take a pint of fine oatmeal, and put to it  two quarts of fair water: let it stand all night, in the morning stir  it, and strain it into a skillet, with three or four blades of mace,  and a nutmeg quartered; set it on the fire, and keep it stirring,  and let it boil a quarter of an hour; if it is too thick, put in  more water, and let it boil longer; then add a pint of Rhenish or  white-wine; three spoonfuls of orange-flower-water, the juice of two  lemons and one orange, a bit of butter, and as much fine sugar as will  sweeten it; let all these have a warm, and thicken it with the yolks  of two or three eggs. Drink it hot for a breakfast.    _To make Tea Caudle_:--Make a quart of strong green tea, and pour it  out into a skillet, and set it over the fire; then beat the yolks of  four eggs and mix with them a pint of white-wine, a grated nutmeg,  sugar to your taste, and put all together; stir it over the fire till  'tis very hot, then drink it in china dishes as caudle.      VII.--CONSERVES, DRIED AND CAN-DIED FRUITS, MARMALADES, ETC.    _To dry Apricocks like Prunella's_:--Take a pound of Apricocks; being  cut in halves or quarters, let them boil till they be very tender in  a thin syrup;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12296"],[0,"Camps and Trails in China (#14)"],[1," ceremony the bride and bridegroom proceeded downstairs to the  joyous strain of the wedding march, but with nothing joyous in their  demeanor--in fact they appeared like two wooden images at the reception and  endured for over an hour the stares and loud criticism of the guests. He  assumed during the ordeal a look of bored indifference while the little  bride sat with her head bowed on her breast, apparently terror stricken.  But once she raised her face and I saw a merry twinkle in her shining black  eyes that made me realize that perhaps it wasn't all quite so frightful as  she would have us believe. I often wonder what sort of a life she is  leading in her far away Chinese courtyard.          CHAPTER IX      VOYAGING TO YÜN-NAN    We had a busy week in Hongkong outfitting for our trip to Yün-nan. Hongkong  is one of the best cities in the Orient in which to purchase supplies of  almost any kind, for not only is the selection excellent, but the best  English goods can be had for prices very little in excess of those in  London itself.    The system which we used in our commissary was that of the unit food box  which has been adopted by most large expeditions. The boxes were packed to  weigh seventy pounds each and contained all the necessary staple supplies  for three persons for one week; thus only one box needed to be opened at a  time, and, moreover, if the party separated for a few days a single box  could be taken without the necessity of repacking and with the assurance  that sufficient food would be available.    Our supplies consisted largely of flour, butter, sugar, coffee, milk,  bacon, and marmalade, and but little tinned meat, vegetables, or fruit  because we were certain to be able to obtain a plentiful supply of such  food in the country through which we were expecting to travel.    Our tents were brought from New York and were made of light Egyptian cotton  thoroughly waterproof, but we also purchased in Hongkong a large army tent  for the servants and two canvas flies to protect loads and specimens. We  used sleeping bags and folding cots, tables and chairs, for when an  expedition expects to remain in the field for a long time it is absolutely  necessary to be as comfortable as possible and to live well; otherwise one  cannot work at one's highest efficiency.    For clothing we all wore khaki or \"Dux-back\" suits with flannel shirts and  high leather shoes for mountain climbing, and we had light rubber  automobile shirts and rubber caps for use in rainy weather. The auto shirt  is a long, loose robe which slips over the head and fastens about the neck  and, when one is sitting upon a horse, can be so spread about as to cover  all exposed parts of the body; it is especially useful and necessary, and  hip rubber boots are also very comfortable during the rainy season.    Our traps for catching small mammals were brought from New York. We had two  sizes of wooden \"Out of Sight\" for mice and rats, and four or five sizes of  Oneida steel traps for catching medium sized animals such as civets and  polecats. We also carried a half dozen No. 5 wolf traps. Mr. Heller had  used this size in Africa and found that they were large enough even to hold  lions.    Mr. Heller carried a 250-300 Savage rifle, while I used a 6-1/2 mm.  Mannlicher and a .405 Winchester. All of these guns were eminently  satisfactory, but the choice of a rifle is a very personal matter and every  sportsman has his favorite weapon. We found, however, that a flat  trajectory high-power rifle such as those with which we were armed was  absolutely essential for many of our shots were at long range and we  frequently killed gorals at three hundred yards or over.    The camera equipment consisted of two 3A Kodaks, a Graphic 4 × 5 tripod  camera, and Graflex 4 × 5 for rapid work. We have found after considerable  field experience that the 4 × 5 is the most convenient size to handle, for  the plate is large enough and can be obtained more readily than any other  in different parts of the world. The same applies to the 3A Kodak  \"post-card\" size film, for there are few places where foreign goods are  carried that 3A films cannot be purchased.    All of our plates and films were sealed in air-tight tin boxes before we  left America, and thus the material was in perfect condition when the cans  were opened. We used plates almost altogether in the finer photographic  work, for although they are heavier and more difficult to handle than  films, nevertheless the results obtained are very superior. A collapsible  rubber dark room about seven feet high and four feet in diameter was an  indispensable part of the camera equipment. This tent was made for us by  the Abercrombie & Fitch Company, of New York, and could be hung from the  limb of a tree or the rafters of a building and be ready for use in five  minutes.    The motion pictures were taken with a Universal camera, and like all other  negatives were developed in the field by means of a special apparatus which  had been designed by Mr. Carl Akeley of the American Museum of Natural  History. This work required a much larger space than that of the portable  dark room and we consequently had a tent made of red cloth which could be  tied inside of our ordinary sleeping tent.    Our equipment was packed in fiber army trunks and in wooden boxes with  sliding tops. The latter arrangement is especially desirable in Yün-nan,  for the loads can be opened without being untied from the saddle, thus  saving a considerable amount of time and trouble.    It was by no means an easy matter to get our supplies together, but the  Lane & Crawford Company of Hongkong pushed the making and packing of our  boxes in a remarkably efficient manner; as the manager of one of their  departments expressed it, \"the one way to hurry a Chinaman is to get more  Chinamen,\" and they put a small army at work upon our material, which was  ready for shipment in just a week.    While in Hongkong we were joined by Wu Hung-tao, of Shanghai, who acted as  interpreter and \"head boy\" as well as a general field manager of the  expedition. He formerly had been in the employ of Mr. F. W. Gary, when the  latter was Commissioner of Customs in Teng-yueh, Yün-nan, and he was  educated at the Anglo-Chinese College of Foochow. Wu proved to be the most  efficient and trustworthy servant whom we have ever employed, and the  success of our work was due in no small degree to his efforts.    We left for Tonking on the S.S. _Sung-kiang_, commanded by Harry  Trowbridge, a congenial and well-read gentleman whose delightful  personality contributed much toward making our week's stay on his ship most  pleasant. On our way to Haiphong the vessel stopped at the island of Hainan  and anchored about three miles off the town of Hoi-hau. This island is 90  by 150 miles long, is mountainous in its center, but flat and uninteresting  at the northwest.    A large part of the island is unexplored and in the interior there is a  mountain called \"the Five Fingers\" which has never been ascended, for it is  reported that the hill tribes are unfriendly and that the tropical valleys  are reeking with deadly malaria. The island undoubtedly would prove to be a  rich field for zoölogical work as is shown by the collections which the  American Museum of Natural History has already received from a native  dealer; these include monkeys, squirrels, and other small mammals, and  bears, leopards, and deer are said to be among its fauna.    The next night's steaming brought us to the city of Paik-hoi on the  mainland. In the afternoon we went ashore with Captain Trowbridge to visit  Dr. Bradley of the China Inland Mission who is in charge of a leper  hospital, which is a model of its kind. The doctor was away but we made  ourselves at home and when he returned he found us in his drawing room  comfortably enjoying afternoon tea. He remarked that he knew of a Chinese  cook who was looking for a position, and half an hour later, while we were  watching some remarkably fine tennis, the cook arrived. He was about six  feet two inches high, and so thin that he was immediately christened the  \"Woolworth Building\" and, although not a very prepossessing looking  individual he was forthwith engaged, principally because of his ability to  speak English. This was at six o'clock in the afternoon and we had to be  aboard the ship at eight. The doctor sent a note to the French Consul and  the cook returned anon with his baggage and passport. Obtaining this cook  was the only really rapid thing which I have ever seen done in China!    When the _Sung-kiang_ arrived in Haiphong the next afternoon we were  besieged by a screaming, fighting mob of Annamits who seized upon our  baggage like so many vultures, and it was only by means of a few  well-directed kicks that we could prevent it from being scattered to the  four winds of Heaven. After we had designated a _sampan_ to receive our  equipment the unloading began and several trunks had gone over the side,  when Mr. Heller happened to glance down just in time to see one of the  ammunition boxes drop into the water and sink like lead. The Annamits,  believing that it had not been noticed, went on as blithely as before and  volubly denied that anything had been lost. We stopped the unloading  instantly and sent for divers. The box had sunk in thirty feet of muddy  water and it seemed useless to hope that it could ever be recovered, but  the divers went to work by dropping a heavy stone on the end of a rope and  going down it hand over hand.    After two hours the box was located and brought dripping to the surface.  Fortunately but little of the ammunition was ruined, and most of it was  dried during the night in the engine room. Because of this delay we had to  leave Haiphong on the following day, and with Captain Trowbridge, we went  by train to Hanoi, the capital of the colony.    Hanoi is a city of delightful surprises.
