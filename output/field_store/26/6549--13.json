Do you think the powers that be will say yes?\"    \"Well, I don't know,\" answered Betty thoughtfully. \"I didn't know you  Salsette boys had much to do with girls. Of course the whole school goes  to the big football games, but asking us to see a practice game is  something new. Of course it will be difficult to get an afternoon when  every one is free--\"    \"Every one!\" exploded Bob. \"Who said anything about every one? We don't  want the whole school--just you and Bobby and Louise and Frances and  Libbie and the Guerin girls.\"    \"Sure, the same bunch that came up on the train,\" said Tommy Tucker.  \"Lead me to Mrs. Eustice and I'll ask her.\"    \"Mrs. Eustice is not in this afternoon,\" announced an extremely cold and  disapproving voice. \"Have you permission, young ladies, to see these  er--callers?\"    It was the elderly teacher whom Tommy had tormented on the train!    For once in his life that young man was thoroughly abashed. He threw  Betty an appealing look that asked her to save him.    \"Miss Prettyman, may I present my friends?\" said the girl with the  formality that is subtly flattering to an older woman. \"This is Bob  Henderson, who came from the West with me and who is really like my  brother, since my uncle is his guardian. And this is Tommy Tucker, who  lives in Washington.\"    \"How do you do, Robert and Thomas?\" said Miss Prettyman austerely. \"Did  Mrs. Eustice know you had callers?\" she persisted, turning to the girls.  \"She took the last bus to Edentown.\"    \"Yes, she knew. It is all right. Caroline said so,\" babbled Betty, in  frantic terror lest the boys make the mistake of telling Miss Prettyman  about the proposed visit.    \"What was it you wanted to ask Mrs. Eustice, young man?\" the teacher  demanded next. \"I am her secretary and try to save her work whenever  possible. Perhaps I can answer your question.\"    Behind Miss Prettyman's narrow back Betty signaled wildly.    \"Don't tell--hush!\" she wig-wagged, laying her finger against her lips.    Tommy stared at her idiotically, his mouth gaping.    \"Thank you, but only Mrs. Eustice could really give us an answer,\" said  Bob, coming to the rescue of his stricken chum. \"Betty, will you deliver  our message and perhaps you can telephone the answer?\"    \"No Shadyside girl is allowed to telephone Salsette Academy,\" announced  Miss Prettyman, with grim satisfaction.    Betty had not known of this rule, but she realized it was undoubtedly in  existence.    \"We'll let you know some way,\" she promised.    Still pursued by Miss Prettyman's icy glare, the wretched boys backed out  of the room and the unfortunate Tommy walked into a handsome china  jardiniere with disastrous results. There was a sickening crash, a  ladylike scream from Miss Prettyman, and Betty heard Bob's voice in a  tone of suppressed fury: \"You've done it now, you idiot!\"    Bobby giggled, of course, but Miss Prettyman, who had followed the boys  into the hall (\"I think she thought we'd steal something on the way out,\"  Bob confided later to Betty) maintained her poise.    \"I'm--I'm awfully sorry,\" faltered the culprit. \"I hope it wasn't very  expensive. I'll pay Mrs. Eustice, of course, or buy her another one--\"    \"That jardiniere happened to be imported from Nippon,\" remarked Miss  Prettyman coldly. \"I doubt if it can ever be replaced. It has stood in  that exact spot for seven years. But then, naturally, our callers are  accustomed to leaving a room gracefully. I'm sure I--\"    The agonized Tommy tried to get in a word, failed, and took a step toward  the door. His foot caught in the rug, and for one dreadful moment he  thought he was doomed to create another scene. As he recovered his  balance, Ada Nansen came down the stairs.    \"What was that noise we heard a few minutes ago?\" she asked sweetly,  looking at the boys.    Betty and Bobby, laughing in the doorway of the reception room, the  unyielding Miss Prettyman, and the cool and curious Ada swam before  Tommy's eyes. Bob retained his presence of mind and, opening the door  with one hand and pushing Tommy before him with the other, managed to  effect their exit.    \"Gosh, Bob, wasn't that awful!\" sighed poor Tommy, when they were finally  clear of the school portal. \"Don't I always have bad luck? How could I  know we were going to walk smack into that dame? She remembered us, too.\"    \"She remembered you,\" said Bob significantly. \"And you were within one of  asking her to let the girls come over to the game, too! Didn't you know,  you poor fish, that she would jump for joy if she could have a chance to  turn you down?\"    \"Well, anyway,\" replied Tommy more contentedly, \"Betty will let us know.  She can find a way.\"    Betty lost no time in putting the invitation before Mrs. Eunice when she  returned from her town expedition. The principal knew all about Bob  through Mr. Gordon's letters and those from Mrs. Littell, and she knew  most of the parents of the other lads Betty mentioned.    \"I see no reason, my dear,\" she said graciously when she heard of the  morning's visit, \"why you should not go. Get the consent of your  chaperone and then settle on the afternoon. How many of you are invited?\"    \"Seven,\" answered Betty truthfully. \"But I want Constance Howard to go,  Mrs. Eustice. The boys didn't know about her. She is Louise's roommate  you see, and we eight always do everything together.\"    \"All right, Constance may go, too,\" acquiesced Mrs. Eustice.    Betty thanked her warmly and danced off to find Bobby. Then they flew to  ask Miss Anderson to be their chaperone, a duty that young woman assumed  cordially, and before bedtime Betty had written Bob a note to say that  they would be over Friday afternoon about half-past four.    Watched a little enviously by the others, the eight piled into the school  bus the next Friday afternoon. Miss Anderson tripped down the steps, took  her place among them, and they were off.    \"Did you see that lovely blouse Ada had on?\" Norma Guerin whispered to  Betty. \"I do wish I could have one like that to wear with my suit.\"    \"You look fifty times prettier than she does,\" flared Betty loyally. \"And  you know I've told you to borrow anything of mine whenever you want to.\"    \"I know it,\" admitted Norma. \"But I can't borrow clothes! Silly or not, I  just can't seem to! I don't mean to complain all the time, either, but I  don't believe mother or granny realized how difficult it was going to be.  Alice cried so hard this afternoon when she started to get dressed I  thought she'd never get her eyes right again. They look red yet.\"    Sure enough, Alice's eyes were suspiciously pink about the corners. Betty  knew that the Guerin girls were unhappy, not alone because they could not  have as many or as pretty frocks as the other girls, but because they  were constantly worried about financial affairs at home. They had both  been made the confidantes of their parents to a greater degree than is  customary in many families, and Betty shrewdly suspected that Norma had  kept her father's books for him.    \"I wish I could get hold of that treasure, or a part of it,\" Betty  thought. \"Isn't it maddening to think of a string of pearls at the  bottom of a chasm and the girls to whom it should go struggling along on  next to nothing!\"    They were half-way around the lake when the motor slowed down and the  bus stopped.    \"What's the matter, George?\" Miss Anderson asked.    \"Don't know, Ma'am,\" answered the driver, a rather sleepy-looking  middle-aged man. \"Guess I'll have to investigate her.\"    Scratching his head, he proceeded to \"investigate,\" and at the end of  fifteen minutes hazarded an opinion that they were \"out of luck.\"    \"Looks like I'll have to go back to the school garage and get 'em to  send us a tow,\" he announced pleasantly.    \"We want to go to the Academy!\" chorused the girls. \"We're late now. Oh,  George, can't you fix it?\"    \"Betty, don't you know anything about cars?\" appealed Miss Anderson,  who had discovered that Betty was apt to be invaluable in an emergency  of any kind.    Betty had to confess that her experience had been confined to horses. The  Littell girls had been used to cars all their lives, but like the  majority of such fortunates, knew nothing about them beyond the colors  suitable for upholstery.    \"I've helped my dad with his car,\" ventured Norma diffidently. \"This  isn't the same make, but perhaps I can tell what the matter is.\"    The beautiful, expensive school bus was in fact another type than the  shabby, rattly affair Dr. Guerin made spin over the rough country roads.  However, Betty remembered at least one night, and she knew her experience  had been duplicated by many others, when the noise of the asthmatic  little car had been like sweetest music in her ears.    The doctor's daughter took off her plain jacket, rolled back her white  cuffs, and bent over the engine. George regarded her respectfully, and  Miss Anderson and the girls watched anxiously. If Norma could not send  them on their way it meant the trip must be given up.    Norma put her slim hands down among the oily plugs, selected a tool from  the kit George held out to her, and did something mysterious to the  \"innards.\"    \"Start her,\" she commanded briefly.    Obediently George took the wheel and touched the self-starter. The engine  purred contentedly.    \"By gum!\" cried George inelegantly, \"she's done it!\"    He produced a towel from the box for Norma, who managed to rub off most  of the grease from her hands. She put on her jacket and climbed into her  place between Betty and her sister. George proceeded to make up for lost  time at a speed that left them breathless.    \"Here's the girl who got us here!\" said Betty to Bob, when the group of  cadets "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10324"],[0,"Bull Hunter (#14)"],[1,"ain't bright, but you're mighty different!\"    He paused and rubbed his forehead. \"Son, I've seen pretty good men in  my day, but I ain't never seen one that I cotton to like I do to you.  You've saved my life. How can you figure on me going out and taking  yours, now?\"    \"You ain't going to, maybe,\" said Bull calmly. \"Maybe I'll get to  you.\"    \"Son,\" answered the other almost sadly, shaking his head, \"when I'm  right, with a good, steady nerve, they ain't any man in the world that  can sling a gun with me. And tonight I'm right. If it comes to a  showdown--but are you pretty good with a gun yourself, Bull?\"    \"No,\" answered Bull frankly. \"I ain't any good compared to an expert  like you. But I'm good enough to take a chance.\"    \"Them sort of chances ain't taken twice, Bull!\"    \"You see,\" said Bull, \"I'm going to make a rush as I pull the gun, and  if I get to you before I'm dead, well--all I ask is to lay my hands on  you, you see?\"    The little man shuddered and blinked. \"I see,\" he said, and swallowed  with difficulty. \"But, in the name of reason, Bull, have sense! Lemme  talk! I'll tell you what that uncle of yours was--\"    \"Don't talk!\" exclaimed Bull Hunter. \"I sort of like you, partner, and  it sort of breaks me down to hear you talk. Don't talk, but listen.  The next time that frog croaks we go for our guns, eh? That frog off  in the marsh!\"    He had hardly spoken before the ominous sound was heard, and Bull  reached for his gun. For all his bulk of hand and unwieldy arms, the  gun came smoothly, swiftly into his hand. He would have had an  ordinary man covered, long before the latter had his gun muzzle-clear  of the leather. But Pete Reeve was no ordinary man. His arm jerked  down; his fingers flickered down and up. They went down empty; they  came up with the burden of a long revolver, shining in the moonlight,  and he fired before Bull's gun came to the level for a shot.    Only Pete Reeve knew the marvel of his own shooting this day. He had  sworn a solemn and silent oath that he would not kill this faithful,  courageous fellow from the mountains. He could have planted a bullet  where the life lay, at any instant of the fight. But he fired for  another purpose. The moment Bull reached for his weapon he had lurched  forward, aiming to shoot as he ran. Pete Reeve set himself a double  goal. His first intention was to disarm the giant; the other was to  stop his rush. For, once within the grip of those big fingers, his  life would be squeezed out like the juice of an orange.    His task was doubly difficult in the moonlight. But the first shot  went home nicely, aimed as exactly as a scientist finds a spot with  his instruments. Where the moon's rays splashed across the bare right  forearm of Bull, he sent a bullet that slashed through the great  muscles. The revolver dropped from the nerveless hand of the giant,  but Bull never paused. On he came, empty-handed, but with power of  death, as the little man well knew, in the fingers of his extended  left hand. He came with a snarl, a savage intake of breath, as he felt  the hot slash of Pete's bullet. But Reeve, standing erect like some  duelist of old, his left hand tucked into the hollow of his back, took  the great gambling chance and refused to shoot to kill.    He placed his second shot more effectively, for this time he must stop  that tremendous body, advancing upon him. He found one critical spot.  Between the knee and the thigh, halfway up on the inside of the left  leg, he drove that second bullet with the precision of a surgeon. The  leg crumpled under Bull and sent him pitching forward on his face.    Perhaps the marsh ground was unstable, but it seemed to Pete Reeve  that the very earth quaked beneath his feet as the big man fell. He  swung his gun wide and leaned to see how serious was the damage he had  done. Bleeding would be the greater danger.    But that fraction of a second brought him into another peril. The  giant heaved up on his sound right leg and his sound left arm, and  flung himself forward, two limbs dangling uselessly. With a hideously  contorted face, Bull swung his left arm in a wide circle for a grip  and scooped in Pete Reeve, as the latter sprang back with a cry  of horror.    The action swept Pete in and crushed his gun hand and arm against the  body of his assailant, paralyzing his only power of attack or defense.  Reeve was carried down to the ground as if beneath the bulk of a  mountain. There was no question of sparing life now. Pete Reeve began  to fight for life. He wrestled at his gun to tug it free, but found it  anchored. He pulled the trigger, and the gun spoke loud and clear, but  the bullet plunged into empty space. Then he felt that left arm begin  to move, and the hand worked up behind his back like a great spider.    Higher it rose, and the huge, thick fingers reached up and around his  throat, fumbling to get at the windpipe. Pete Reeve made his last  effort; it was like striving to free himself from a ton's weight.  Hysteria of fear and horror seized him, and his voice gave utterance  to his terror. As he screamed, the big fingers joined around his  throat. Any further pressure would end him!    He looked up into the glaring eyes and the contorted face of the  giant; the rasping, panting breathing paralyzed his senses. There was  a slight inward contraction of the grip; then it ceased.    Miraculously he felt the great hand relax and fall away. The bulk was  heaved away from him, and staggering to his own feet, he saw Bull  Hunter supported against a tree, one leg useless, one arm streaming.    \"I couldn't seem to do it,\" said Bull Hunter thickly. \"I couldn't  noways seem to do it, Reeve. You see, I sort of like you, and I  couldn't kill you, Pete.\"    When Pete Reeve recovered from his astonishment he said, \"You can do  more. You can go home and tell that infernal hound of an uncle of  yours that you had the life of Pete Reeve under your fingertips and  that you didn't take it. It's the second time I've owed my life, and  both times in one day, and both times to one man. You tell your  uncle that!\"    The big man sagged still more against the tree. \"I'll never go home,  Pete, unless ghosts walk; and I'll never tell Uncle Bill anything,  unless the ghosts talk. I'm dying pretty pronto, I think, Pete.\"    \"Dyin'? You ain't hurt bad, Bull!\"    \"It's the bleeding; all the senses is running out of my head--like  water--and the moon--is turning black--and--\" He slumped down at the  foot of the tree.          CHAPTER 10      When old Farmer Morton and his son came in their buckboard through the  marshes, they heard the screaming of Pete Reeve for help. Leaving  their team, they bolted across country to the open glade. There they  found Pete still shouting for help, kneeling above the body of a man,  and working desperately to arrange an effectual tourniquet. They ran  close and discovered the two men.    Old Morton knew enough rude surgery to stop the bleeding. It was he  who counted the pulse and listened to the heart. \"Low,\" he said, \"very  low--life is just flickerin', stranger.\"    \"If they's as much light of life in him,\" said Pete Reeve, \"as the  flicker of a candle, I'll fan it up till it's as big as a forest fire.  Man, he's got to live.\"    \"H'm!\" said Morton. \"And how come the shooting?\"    \"Stop your fool questions,\" said Reeve. \"Help me get him to town and  to a bed.\"    It was useless to attempt to carry that great, loose-limbed body. They  brought the buckboard perilously through the shrubbery and then  managed, with infinite labor, to lift Bull Hunter into it. With Pete  Reeve supporting the head of the wounded man and cautioning them to  drive gently, they managed the journey to the town as softly as  possible. At the hotel a strong-armed cortege bore Bull to a bed, and  they carried him reverently. Had his senses been with him he would  have wondered greatly; and had his uncle, or his uncle's sons, been  there, they would surely have laughed uproariously.    In the hotel room Pete Reeve took command at once. \"He's too big to  die,\" he told the dubious doctor. \"He's got to live. And the minute  you say he can't, out you go and another doc comes in. Now do  your work.\"    The doctor, haunted by the deep, fiery eyes of the gunfighter, stepped  into the room to minister to his patient. He had a vague feeling that,  if Bull Hunter died, Pete Reeve would blame him for lack of care. In  truth, Pete seemed ready to blame everyone. He threatened to destroy  the whole village if a dog was allowed to howl in the night, or if the  baby next door were permitted to cry in the day.    Silence settled over the little town--silence and the fear of Pete  Reeve. Pete himself never left the sickroom. Wide-eyed, silent-footed,  he was ever about. He seemed never to sleep, and the doctor swore that  the only reason Bull Hunter did not die was because death feared to  enter the room while the awful Reeve was there.    But the long hours of unconsciousness and delirium wore away. Then  came the critical period when a relapse was feared. Finally the time  came when it could be confidently stated that Bull was recovering his  health and his strength.    All this filled a matter of weeks. Bull was still unable to leave his  bed. He was dull and listless, bony of hand, and liable to sleep many  hours through the very heart of the day. At this point of his recovery  the door opened one day, and, in the warmth of the afternoon, a big  man came into the room, shutting the door softly behind him.    Bull turned his head slowly and then blinked, for it was the unshaven  face of his cousin, Harry Campbell, that he saw. With his eyes closed,  Bull wondered why that face was so distinctly unpleasant. When he  opened them again, Harry had drawn closer, his hat pushed on the back  of his head after the manner of a baffled man, and a faint smile  working at the corners of his lips. He took the limp hand of Bull in  "]]]
