It has been the solace  of my life, it will be the solace of my death! [Footnote ref 2]\" Through  Schopenhauer the study of the Upani@sads attracted much attention in  Germany and with the growth of a general interest in the study  of Sanskrit, they found their way into other parts of Europe as  well.    The study of the Upani@sads has however gained a great  impetus by the earnest attempts of our Ram Mohan Roy who  not only translated them into Bengali, Hindi and English and  published them at his own expense, but founded the Brahma  Samaj in Bengal, the main religious doctrines of which were  derived directly from the Upani@sads.    ______________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Translation by Haldane and Kemp, vol. I. pp. xii and xiii.]    [Footnote 2: Max Muller says in his introduction to the Upanishada  (-_S.B.E._ I p. lxii; see also pp. lx, lxi) \"that Schopenhauer should  have spoken of the Upanishads as 'products of the highest wisdom'...that  he should have placed the pantheism there taught high above the  pantheism of Bruno, Malebranche, Spinoza and Scotus Erigena, as brought  to light again at Oxford in 1681, may perhaps secure a more considerate  reception for those relics of ancient wisdom than anything that I could  say in their favour.\"]    41      The Upani@sads and their interpretations.    Before entering into the philosophy of the Upani@sads it may  be worth while to say a few words as to the reason why diverse  and even contradictory explanations as to the real import of the  Upani@sads had been offered by the great Indian scholars of past  times. The Upani@sads, as we have seen, formed the concluding  portion of the revealed Vedic literature, and were thus called the  Vedanta. It was almost universally believed by the Hindus that  the highest truths could only be found in the revelation of the  Vedas. Reason was regarded generally as occupying a comparatively  subservient place, and its proper use was to be found in its  judicious employment in getting out the real meaning of the  apparently conflicting ideas of the Vedas. The highest knowledge  of ultimate truth and reality was thus regarded as having  been once for all declared in the Upani@sads. Reason had only to  unravel it in the light of experience. It is important that readers  of Hindu philosophy should bear in mind the contrast that it  presents to the ruling idea of the modern world that new truths  are discovered by reason and experience every day, and even in  those cases where the old truths remain, they change their hue  and character every day, and that in matters of ultimate truths no  finality can ever be achieved; we are to be content only with as  much as comes before the purview of our reason and experience  at the time. It was therefore thought to be extremely audacious  that any person howsoever learned and brilliant he might be  should have any right to say anything regarding the highest  truths simply on the authority of his own opinion or the reasons  that he might offer. In order to make himself heard it was necessary  for him to show from the texts of the Upani@sads that they  supported him, and that their purport was also the same. Thus  it was that most schools of Hindu philosophy found it one of their  principal duties to interpret the Upani@sads in order to show that  they alone represented the true Vedanta doctrines. Any one  who should feel himself persuaded by the interpretations of any  particular school might say that in following that school he was  following the Vedanta.    The difficulty of assuring oneself that any interpretation is  absolutely the right one is enhanced by the fact that germs of  diverse kinds of thoughts are found scattered over the Upani@sads    42    which are not worked out in a systematic manner. Thus each  interpreter in his turn made the texts favourable to his own  doctrines prominent and brought them to the forefront, and tried  to repress others or explain them away. But comparing the  various systems of Upani@sad interpretation we find that the  interpretation offered by S'a@nkara very largely represents the view  of the general body of the earlier Upani@sad doctrines, though  there are some which distinctly foreshadow the doctrines of other  systems, but in a crude and germinal form. It is thus that Vedanta  is generally associated with the interpretation of S'a@nkara and  S'a@nkara's system of thought is called the Vedanta system, though  there are many other systems which put forth their claim as representing  the true Vedanta doctrines.    Under these circumstances it is necessary that a modern interpreter  of the Upani@sads should turn a deaf ear to the absolute  claims of these exponents, and look upon the Upani@sads not as  a systematic treatise but as a repository of diverse currents of  thought--the melting pot in which all later philosophic ideas were  still in a state of fusion, though the monistic doctrine of S'a@nkara,  or rather an approach thereto, may be regarded as the purport of  by far the largest majority of the texts. It will be better that a  modern interpreter should not agree to the claims of the ancients  that all the Upani@sads represent a connected system, but take the  texts independently and separately and determine their meanings,  though keeping an attentive eye on the context in which they  appear. It is in this way alone that we can detect the germs of  the thoughts of other Indian systems in the Upani@sads, and thus  find in them the earliest records of those tendencies of thoughts.      The quest after Brahman: the struggle and the failures.    The fundamental idea which runs through the early Upani@sads  is that underlying the exterior world of change there is an unchangeable  reality which is identical with that which underlies  the essence in man [Footnote ref 1]. If we look at Greek philosophy in  Parmenides or Plato or at modern philosophy in Kant, we find the  same tendency towards glorifying one unspeakable entity as the  reality or the essence. I have said above that the Upani@sads are    _______________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: B@rh. IV. 4. 5. 22.    43    no systematic treatises of a single hand, but are rather collations  or compilations of floating monologues, dialogues or anecdotes.  There are no doubt here and there simple discussions but there  is no pedantry or gymnastics of logic. Even the most casual  reader cannot but be struck with the earnestness and enthusiasm  of the sages. They run from place to place with great eagerness  in search of a teacher competent to instruct them about the nature  of Brahman. Where is Brahman? What is his nature?    We have noticed that during the closing period of the Sa@mhita  there were people who had risen to the conception of a single  creator and controller of the universe, variously called Prajapati,  Vis'vakarman, Puru@sa, Brahma@naspati and Brahman. But this  divine controller was yet only a deity. The search as to the  nature of this deity began in the Upani@sads. Many visible objects  of nature such as the sun or the wind on one hand and the various  psychological functions in man were tried, but none could render  satisfaction to the great ideal that had been aroused. The sages  in the Upani@sad had already started with the idea that there was  a supreme controller or essence presiding over man and the  universe. But what was its nature? Could it be identified with  any of the deities of Nature, was it a new deity or was it no deity  at all? The Upani@sads present to us the history of this quest and  the results that were achieved.    When we look merely to this quest we find that we have not  yet gone out of the Ara@nyaka ideas and of symbolic (_pratika_)  forms of worship. _Pra@na_ (vital breath) was regarded as the most  essential function for the life of man, and many anecdotes are  related to show that it is superior to the other organs, such as the  eye or ear, and that on it all other functions depend. This  recognition of the superiority of pra@na brings us to the meditations  on pra@na as Brahman as leading to the most beneficial results.  So also we find that owing to the presence of the exalting  characters of omnipresence and eternality _akas'a_ (space) is  meditated upon as Brahman. So also manas and Aditya (sun)  are meditated upon as Brahman. Again side by side with the  visible material representation of Brahman as the pervading Vayu,  or the sun and the immaterial representation as akas'a, manas or  pra@na, we find also the various kinds of meditations as substitutes  for actual sacrifice. Thus it is that there was an earnest quest  after the discovery of Brahman. We find a stratum of thought    44    which shows that the sages were still blinded by the old ritualistic  associations, and though meditation had taken the place of sacrifice  yet this was hardly adequate for the highest attainment of  Brahman.    Next to the failure of the meditations we have to notice the  history of the search after Brahman in which the sages sought to  identify Brahman with the presiding deity of the sun, moon,  lightning, ether, wind, fire, water, etc., and failed; for none of  these could satisfy the ideal they cherished of Brahman. It is  indeed needless here to multiply these examples, for they are  tiresome not only in this summary treatment but in the original  as well. They are of value only in this that they indicate how  toilsome was the process by which the old ritualistic associations  could be got rid of; what struggles and failures the sages had to  undergo before they reached a knowledge of the true nature of  Brahman.

I have told you already that there is no time to  spare. Tell me what course you intend to take. Give up some articles  in this room--there is that clock, which will do more than pay the  bill--or follow me immediately. There is no other alternative.\"    The whole conversation with the Grand Master occurred to Dumiger.  There could be no doubt that the clock would go into his possession;  that it was a deep-laid scheme to spoil him of the result of all his  labor. Better, far better, that Marguerite should bear the pain of  separation, than that the clock should be endangered, and by such a  man.    \"Marguerite,\" said Dumiger, in a low voice, after a long pause, \"it is  fixed. We must part for a short time. I will write from my prison to  some of my friends; they will not desert me in this necessity. A few  short hours, and I shall return to you, my own Marguerite.\"    But Marguerite had fainted, and the lips which touched his cheek were  cold and pale.    Slowly she opened those large blue eyes, and although her lips  faltered, the look and the voice were both earnest as she bade him go.    \"Yes, Dumiger, you are right: ambition such as yours is a less selfish  passion than love like mine. Leave me for a time. I know the interval  will be short. It is another step toward the greatness to which you  are aspiring.\"    The man looked at them with a vague and vacant look. He had been  witness to this description of scene so frequently, that he began  to believe it to be a part of the debtor's craft. As some people can  regard the most beautiful varying tints of heaven, the lights and  shadows which flit across the face of nature, and see nothing more in  them than a part of that vast and complicated machinery that governs  the world--so he, in these lights and shadows of life, only beheld the  natural workings of the human mind.    With a pale cheek but a firm step Dumiger departed. The last sound  that fell upon his ear as he left his door, was the blessing murmured  by his bride. Again he felt disposed to turn back and sacrifice all  for his affection; but already one of the city guard stood behind him,  and the rattle of arms on the pavement told him that his arrest had  not been lightly planned or carelessly conducted.    The castle toward which Dumiger and his guards directed their steps  was the Grimshaus, formerly a citadel and an important point of  defense for the town of Dantzic, though now converted into a prison  for political offenders and debtors. The reader may be aware that  the laws against debtors in the great free commercial cities were  intolerably severe. Some men were permitted to groan away their whole  lives in hopeless misery. The creditor was in general without pity,  and the debtor unpitied. He was entirely at the mercy of the jailer,  who had it in his power to load him with chains, and even on the  slightest pretext of insubordination to execute summary justice  upon him. These laws, however, had as yet little affected Dumiger;  though threatened with arrest on one or two previous occasions his  difficulties had always been arranged. But the present debt was more  serious than any which had as yet been pressed for, and he could not  but feel that friends might be less willing to become surety.    They arrived at the square in which the Grimshaus was situated. It  was a wild, unhealthy, stern, fantastic pile, which stood, in point  of fact, upon an island, for a wide, wet ditch surrounded it, except  where a drawbridge connected it with the square. The towers and  ramparts had in some places mouldered away, and huge bars of iron  were introduced in different parts of the wall to give strength to the  building by binding the yawning mason-work together.    The square was deserted. The cry of the sentinel at the most distant  of the landward posts sounded ominous, like that of a lost bird  at night. Although the moon shone brightly, it was difficult to  distinguish the whole outline of the building, on account of the  pestiferous vapors which arose from the moat, and hung like a pall  over the recently flooded plain. Through these mists the city chimes  sounded muffled and melancholy. It was solitude--of all solitude the  most fearful--a prison solitude in the neighborhood of a great town.  The very escort appeared to feel the influence of their melancholy  and lonely scene, for the jests stopped as the foot of the vanguard  clanged on the drawbridge. This was merely the effect of discipline;  but to Dumiger it appeared a part of the drama, and it added to his  sense of fear.    They were detained some time upon the drawbridge while the sergeant  was holding some conversation with the officer of the watch.    \"By the Holy Mary!\" exclaimed the functionary who had arrested  Dumiger, \"there must be something more than a mere debt in all this.  I never saw such a fuss made about the receipt of the body of a debtor  in all my life. And then, it was rather strange my being ordered to  take a file of my guard instead of honest Jean, who would have held  him just as firm in his grasp, and not kept my poor fellows shivering  out all night in this unhealthy atmosphere. No, no, there is something  more than a debt due: it is a case of political crime. Is it not so,  my lad?\" he exclaimed, giving Dumiger a thump on his back which made  the chain-bridge rattle.    \"Is it not what?\" said Dumiger, who was quite taken by surprise. He  had been gazing on the water, and the purest drops in it were the  two tears which had fallen from his eyes. \"I have heard nothing,\" he  replied. \"What does all this mean, and why am I kept here?\"    \"Ah, that's just what I wish to know!\" answered the man, \"and no one  can tell us better than yourself. It is not merely for a case of debt  that I was sent to your house to-night. No, no, I am wiser than that.  Come now, tell us the real truth. What conspiracy have you entered  into, what political offense have you committed, to entitle you to be  escorted with such honor, and be made the subject of so many forms?  There is no use denying it,\" he continued, for Dumiger's astonished  countenance was quite a sufficient protestation against any such  inference. \"Look here; the lieutenant of the tower has been called up,  and the guard is reinforced.\"    It was quite true. Had Dumiger been a state prisoner of the highest  rank, he could not have been received with more ceremony. The guard  turned out, and the rattle of the muskets was heard as the massive  gates rolled ponderously upon their axes. The one light in the  entrance gave an awful but not unpicturesque appearance to the scene,  for it was reflected on the glittering steel. It cast its wild gleams  on the bronzed cheeks of the guards, while the length and height of  the hall were lost in the gloom.    \"Forward!\" was the word, and tramp, tramp, tramp, mingled with the  rattle of the chains of the bridge. Dumiger was now placed in the  center of the guard.    The soldiers presented arms to the burghers: the burghers carried  theirs as they passed. The single drum beat, and its echo vibrated  through the building. The gates closed behind them--bolt after bolt  was drawn, and Dumiger was separated from the world.    His heart sank within him, and well it might; for as the moon shone  into the courtyard beyond the hall where he was standing, he could see  that the windows which looked into it were all trebly barred. Besides,  the building looked throughout so miserably damp and wretched; and  there was an entire absence of care for the comfort of its inmates,  which chilled his blood.    The lieutenant of the tower, after the conference with Dumiger's  officer had lasted some time, approached him. He took him gently by  the arm, and brought him to the broken, rotten, creaking stairs,  which led to the upper rooms, or rather cells, from which they were  separated by two large, massive iron doors.    The lieutenant himself opened the locks, while two soldiers, standing  on either side with flambeaux, gave Dumiger a full view of the  desolate stair which he had to ascend. The passage to which it led had  been taken out of the thickness of the walls, so massive were they.  They passed through a large hall where a huge fire was blazing, about  which some soldiers slept, with their cloaks drawn tightly round them  to ward off the draughts which came in strong gusts beneath the doors  and even through the shutters; one or two with handkerchiefs tied  round their heads, to serve the purpose of night-caps, were sitting  by the fire smoking. They took the pipes from their lips to salute the  lieutenant as he passed, but beyond this notice paid no attention  to the object of his visit. It was evidently an event of no uncommon  occurrence. More passages, more bars, more doors battered by age and  mended by slabs of iron, and at last Dumiger arrived at the room, or  rather the cell, which had been prepared for him. The preparations,  it must however be admitted, were of the very simplest character.  A palliasse thrown down in the corner, a rickety chair, and the  strangest apology for a table, were the whole furniture of the place.  Without one word of explanation the lieutenant motioned him into his  new abode. In vain Dumiger stormed and raved, and desired to know  whether this was the way in which free citizens were treated in the  free city of Dantzic. The lieutenant only shrugged his shoulders,  gave orders to the soldiers to withdraw, and Dumiger was left to his  melancholy meditations.    A heavy weight, such as magnetic influence affects the brain with,  oppressed his"]]]
