For this purpose they  exaggerated them more and more--neither time nor space, nor the  entire of nature could contain their immensity--every thing became an  impenetrable mystery. Although man has originally borrowed from himself  the traits, the colours, the primitive lineaments of which he composed  his gods; although he has made them jealous, powerful, vindictive  monarchs, yet his theology, by force of dreaming, entirely lost sight  of human nature. In order to render his divinities still more different  from their creatures, it assigned them, over and above the usual  qualities of man, properties so marvellous, so uncommon, so far removed  from every thing of which his mind could form a conception, that he lost  sight of them himself. From thence he persuaded himself these qualities  were divine, because he could no longer comprehend them; he believed  them worthy of his gods, because no man could figure to himself any one  distinct idea of them. Thus theology obtained the point of persuading  man he must believe that which he could not conceive; that he must  receive with submission improbable systems; that he must adopt, with  pious deference, conjectures contrary to his reason; that this reason  itself was the most agreeable sacrifice he could make on the altars of  his gods, who were unwilling he should use the gift they had bestowed  upon him. In short, it had made mortals implicitly believe that they  were not formed to comprehend the thing of all others the most important  to themselves. Thus it is evident that superstition founded its basis  upon the absurd principle that man is obliged to accredit firmly that  which he is in the most complete impossibility of comprehending. On  the other hand, man persuaded himself that the gigantic, the truly  incomprehensible attributes which were assigned to these celestial  monarchs, placed between them and their slaves a distance so immense,  that these could not be by any means offended with the comparison; that  these distinctions rendered them still greater; made them more powerful,  more marvellous, more inaccessible to observation. Man always entertains  the idea, that what he is not in a condition to conceive, is much more  noble, much wore respectable, than that which he has the capacity  to comprehend. The more a thing is removed from his reach, the more  valuable it always appears.    These prejudices in man for the marvellous, appear to have been the  source that gave birth to those wonderful, unintelligible qualities with  which superstition clothed these divinities. The invincible ignorance  of the human mind, whose fears reduced him to despair, engendered those  obscure, vague notions, with which mythology decorated its gods. He  believed he could never displease them, provided he rendered them  incommensurable; impossible to be compared with any thing, of which he  had a knowledge; either with that which was most sublime, or that which  possessed the greatest magnitude, From hence the multitude of negative  attributes with which ingenious dreamers have successively embellished  their phantoms, to the end that they might more surely form a being  distinguished from all others, or which possessed nothing in common with  that which the human mind had the faculty of being acquainted with: they  did not perceive that after all their endeavours, it was nothing wore  than exaggerated human qualities, which they thus heaped together, with  no more skill than a painter would display who should delineate all the  members of the body of the same size, taking a giant for dimension.    The theological attributes with which metaphysicians decorated these  divinities, were in fact nothing but pure negations of the qualities  found in man, or in those beings of which he has a knowledge; by these  attributes their gods were supposed exempted from every thing which they  considered weakness or imperfection in him, or in the beings by whom he  is surrounded: they called every quality infinite, which has been  shewn is only to affirm, that unlike man, or the beings with whom he  is acquainted, it is not circumscribed by the limits of space; this,  however, is what he can never in any manner comprehend, because he is  himself finite. Hobbes in his _Leviathan_, says, \"whatsoever we imagine  is finite. Therefore there is no idea, or conception of any thing  we call infinite. No man can have in his mind an image of infinite  magnitude, nor conceive infinite swiftness, infinite time, infinite  force, or infinite power. When we say any thing is infinite, we signify  only, that we are not able to conceive the ends and bound of the thing  named, having no conception of the thing, but of our own inability.\"  Sherlock says, \"the word infinite is only a negation, which signifies  that which has neither end, nor limits, nor extent, and, consequently,  that which has no positive and determinate nature, and is therefore  nothing;\" he adds, \"that nothing but custom has caused this word to  be adopted, which without that, would appear devoid of sense, and a  contradiction.\"    When it is said these gods are eternal, it signifies they have not had,  like man or like every thing that exists, a beginning, and that they  will never have an end: to say they are immutable, is to say, that  unlike himself or every thing which he sees, they are not subject to  change: to say they are immaterial, is to advance, that their substance  or essence is of a nature not conceivable by himself, but which must  from that very circumstance be totally different from every thing of  which he has cognizance.    It is from the confused collection of these negative qualities, that has  resulted the theological gods; those metaphysical wholes of which it  is impossible for man to form to himself any correct idea. In  these abstract beings every thing is infinity,--immensity,--  spirituality,--omniscience,--order,--wisdom,--intelligence,--  omnipotence. In combining these vague terms, or these modifications, the  ethnic priests believed they formed something, they extended these  qualities by thought, and they imagined they made gods, whilst they only  composed chimeras. They imagined that these perfections or these  qualities must be suitable to their gods, because they were not suitable  to any thing of which they had a knowledge; they believed that  incomprehensible beings must have inconceivable qualities. These were  the materials of which theology availed itself to compose those  inexplicable shadows before which they commanded the human race to bend  the knee.    Nevertheless, experience soon proved that beings so vague, so impossible  to be conceived, so incapable of definition, so far removed from every  thing of which man could have any knowledge, were but little calculated  to fix his restless views; his mind requires to be arrested by qualities  which he is capacitated to ascertain; of which he is in a condition to  form a judgment. Thus after it had subtilized these metaphysical gods,  after it had rendered them so different in idea, from every thing that  acts upon the senses, theology found itself under the necessity of  again assimilating them to man, from whom it had so far removed them: it  therefore again made them human by the moral qualities which it assigned  them; it felt that without this it would not be able to persuade mankind  there could possibly exist any relation between him and such vague,  ethereal, fugitive, incommensurable beings; that it would never be  competent to secure for them his adoration.    It began to perceive that these marvellous gods were only calculated  to exercise the imagination of some few thinkers, whose minds were  accustomed to labour upon chimerical subjects, or to take words for  realities; in short it found, that for the greater number of the  material children of the earth it was necessary to have gods more  analogous to themselves, more sensible, more known to them. In  consequence these divinities were re-clothed with human qualities;  theology never felt the incompatibility of these qualities with beings  it had made essentially different from man, who consequently could  neither have his properties, nor be modified like himself. It did not  see that gods who were immaterial, destitute of corporeal organs, were  neither able to think nor to act as material beings, whose peculiar  organizations render them susceptible of the qualities, the feelings  the will, the virtues, that are found in them. The necessity it felt to  assimilate the gods to their worshippers, to make an affinity  between them, made it pass over without consideration these palpable  contradictions--this want of keeping in their portrait: thus ethnic  theology obstinately continued to unite those incompatible qualities,  that discrepancy of character, which the human mind attempted in vain  either to conceive or to reconcile: according to it, pure spirits were  the movers of the material world; immense beings were enabled to occupy  space, without however excluding nature; immutable deities were the  causes of those continual changes operated in the world: omnipotent  beings did not prevent those evils which were displeasing to them;  the sources of order submitted to confusion: in short, the wonderful  properties of these theological beings every moment contradicted  themselves.    There is not less discrepancy, less incompatibility, less discordance  in the human perfections, less contradiction in the moral qualities  attributed to them, to the end that man might be enabled to form to  himself some idea of these beings. These were all said to be _eminently_  possessed by the gods, although they every moment contradicted each  other: by this means they formed a kind of patch-work character,  heterogeneous beings, discrepant phenomena, entirely inconceivable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8911"],[0,"Explorations in Australia (#13)"],[1,"ng. I had  left orders that, if they came, they were not to be allowed to come near  the camp, but were to be met a little distance from it. They remained for  some time, and then stole off one by one without being perceived, and  were out of sight in a moment. The one that remained to the last in his  flight did not forget to carry along with him a piece of blanket that had  been a saddle-cloth, and which happened to be lying outside the camp.    Saturday, 30th April, Chambers Creek. Sent Muller and my stockman to  build a cone of stones upon the highest of the three table-topped hills,  for the base line of the survey. They are three remarkable hills close  together; two only can be seen coming from the south and from the  north-east. Latitude, 29 degrees 40 minutes 27 seconds. From the hill the  men saw a number of native fires smoking to the westward on the creek,  but have not seen any natives.    Sunday, 1st May, Chambers Creek. This morning we had a heavy dew. Went to  the top of the three table-tops, and had a fine view of Mount Hamilton  and the lagoon where the springs are, and the other hills; they are the  same hills that I saw on my north-west course, when on my last journey.    Monday, 2nd May, Chambers Creek. Sent Muller and Campbell to build a cone  of stones on Mount Strangways, which I have fixed as a south point of my  base line. The mean of all the observations that I have got to-day makes  the latitude to be 29 degrees 39 minutes 15 seconds.    Tuesday, 3rd May, Chambers Creek. Spent the day examining the  neighbourhood for water, and in taking numerous bearings.    Wednesday, 4th May, Chambers Creek. I intend to move to-day to the large  water holes westward, where I first struck the creek. The horses having  strayed a long way off this morning, made it 11 o'clock before we got a  start. About four miles from last night's camp the chain of large water  holes commences, and continues beyond to-night's camp. They are indeed  most splendid water holes--not holes, but very long ponds; they are  nearly one continuous sheet of water, and the scenery is beautiful. I am  sorry I did not name it a river in my former journal. I must bring my  survey up to this night's camp to-morrow. It is very cloudy to-night,  with a strong wind from the south-west, from which quarter the clouds are  coming. The country is a little stony, but well grassed.    Thursday, 5th May, Chambers Creek. Moved the camp to a better situation.  Ascended a hill, got some bearings to fix it, and built a cone of stones  upon it. I have had the creek, which joins this, run up for three miles  to the sources to-day. There is no more permanent water. There are an  immense number of small fish in the ponds, and on the banks there is a  shrub growing that tastes and smells like cinnamon; we happened to stir  up the sugar in a pannikin of tea with a small twig of the bush, and it  left quite the flavour of it in the tea. I have had Herrgott to take  sketches of some of the ponds, also of the fish and other remarkable  things. It has been rather cloudy to-day, and I could not depend upon my  observations. There are numerous tracks of natives about, but we have not  seen any of them; we have also found some new plants in the creek.    Friday, 6th May, Chambers Creek. Moved further up the creek on the south  side to the last water that we knew of. It is a hole of rain water, very  large, and will last a long time, being well sheltered by gum-trees and  other shrubs.    Saturday, 7th May, Chambers Creek. Sent Muller to see if there is any  more water to the west, and went myself to the top of a small hill, and  built a cone of stones to connect this point with the last point. Muller  returned after dark, and reported that there was no more permanent water.  I shall start to the north to-morrow.    Sunday, 8th May, Chambers Creek. Started to the north over the range,  which is rather difficult to get the horses up and down. On the top it is  very stony, with salt bush and scanty grass. Crossed the Margaret and a  salt creek, in which there is water, some of which is salt and some  brackish, but not unfit for the use of cattle. There is abundance of feed  all round. We arrived at Hamilton Springs a little before sundown.  Distance, twenty-one miles.    Monday, 9th May, Mount Hamilton. Some of the horses require to be shod  to-day. I shall also require to build a cone of stones upon Mount  Hamilton (the one built by Major Warburton having fallen down), and get  an observation of the same. Latitude, 29 degrees 27 minutes 37 seconds.  The springs are certainly very remarkable, and Major Warburton gives a  very good description of them.    Tuesday, 10th May, Mount Hamilton. Started for the Beresford Springs.  Arrived at Mount Hugh at 11 o'clock, seven miles distant from Mount  Hamilton, and, as I anticipated, found a number of splendid springs,  giving out a fine stream of water, not the least brackish. The hill from  which this stream issues is one hundred feet above the level of the  plain, the water coming from the very top. My horse got bogged on the  top, and I had some difficulty in getting him out, but I did so at last  without injuring him. Started from the mount at 12.30, and, after three  miles and a half, arrived at Beresford Springs. The Beresford Springs are  nothing in comparison to the others; there are only two that are running,  but they are very good. The country travelled over to-day has been very  well grassed, with salt bush; take it altogether I have not seen better  runs in the colony, and in the driest summer the furthest distance from  water will not be above five miles at the most, but the feed is so  abundant that they would not require to go so far. On that account they  will feed double and treble the number of stock that the runs down the  country do. At two miles on this side of the Hugh Springs discovered  another batch of springs with plenty of water running from them; there  are about eight or nine of them very good; those springs have not been  visited by Major Warburton. We examined all round, but could find no  tracks. I have named them the Elizabeth Springs. There is enough water  running to drive a flour-mill in two or three places. They are really  remarkable springs--such a height above the level of the plain; I saw  them from a hill on Chambers Creek (the Twins). From whence do they  derive their supply of water, to cause them to rise to such a height? It  must be from some high ranges to the north-west, or a large body of fresh  water lying on elevated ground. This is another strange feature of the  mysterious interior of Australia. I shall remain here until after 12  to-morrow, to get an observation of the sun to fix this hill. I shall  return to Mount Hamilton, and proceed to examine the country west of  North Lake Torrens, for one of the east runs, which will complete my  survey of them, and I shall despatch thence a messenger to Oratunga.    Wednesday, 11th May, Elizabeth Springs. Latitude, 29 degrees 17 minutes  43 seconds. I omitted to mention yesterday that, two miles before we  reached Beresford Hill, we crossed Pasley Ponds and saw one of the  Major's camps. The water is brackish, but not bad. The white deposit  round these springs, and also round the Elizabeth, is soda. In returning,  I examined the Coward Springs; the water is good, and running. There is a  plentiful supply. It was dark when I arrived at Mount Hamilton. Saw four  natives to-day, but they gave us a wide berth; they do not like to come  near us.    Thursday, 12th May, Mount Hamilton. Some of the horses require shoeing,  and I wish to get another observation of the sun. I shall remain here  to-day, and examine the country to the north-east. About seven miles in  that direction is the salt creek of Major Warburton. The country is of a  light sandy soil covered with grass.    Friday, May 13th, Mount Hamilton. Started to the eastward, to complete  the survey of the runs, and see if there are any more springs. To the  south of east, about four miles, we discovered four springs not seen by  the Major; there is a plentiful supply of water, and would be more if  they were opened. One is choked up with reeds, but the other two are  running. Saw some natives; they seemed frightened at first, but were  induced to come close up: they were very much amused at our equipments.  Two had seen or heard of whites before; they knew the name of horse, but  no more; they call water courie, and some of their words very much  resemble those of the natives in Port Lincoln. We could make nothing of  them--they repeat every word of the question we ask them. They followed  us over to the Margaret, and took us to some fresh-water springs in the  creek, the water of which is very good. There is a quantity of reeds  growing round them, also tea-tree. From this we followed the creek to the  north, thence north-east towards the lake, but the water being too  brackish, I returned to the springs, the natives walking with us all the  time; they seemed very inoffensive. In following down the creek, another  native joined us from the creek, carrying a net in which were some small  fish; the net was a hoop one, well made.    Saturday, May 14th, The Margaret Creek. The morning very cloudy; every  appearance of rain. Saddled and proceeded in search of Emerald Spring, on  a north course. At seven miles made Mr. Babbage's old camp on a sand  hill. Camped a little way from it. I did not know the position of the  spring, but Herrgott informed me that it was three miles to the west. It  commenced raining before we started, has rained all the way up, and is  still doing so; it is a very light rain, but the wind is very strong and  cold from the south-west. Intended to have brought up my plan, but the  rain and wind prevent me.    Sunday, 15th May, Mr. Babbage's Old Camp. It cleared off during the  night, but the clouds have come up again this morning and look very"]]]
