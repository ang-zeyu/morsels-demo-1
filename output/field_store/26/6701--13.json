[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/139"],[0,"The Lost World (#14)"],[1," don't think!\" said Lord Roxton, holding the paper to the light.  \"No, young fellah my lad, there is no use deceiving yourself.  I'll go  bail for it that nothing has ever been written upon this paper.\"    \"May I come in?\" boomed a voice from the veranda.    The shadow of a squat figure had stolen across the patch of sunlight.  That voice!  That monstrous breadth of shoulder!  We sprang to our feet  with a gasp of astonishment as Challenger, in a round, boyish straw-hat  with a colored ribbon--Challenger, with his hands in his jacket-pockets  and his canvas shoes daintily pointing as he walked--appeared in the  open space before us.  He threw back his head, and there he stood in  the golden glow with all his old Assyrian luxuriance of beard, all his  native insolence of drooping eyelids and intolerant eyes.    \"I fear,\" said he, taking out his watch, \"that I am a few minutes too  late.  When I gave you this envelope I must confess that I had never  intended that you should open it, for it had been my fixed intention to  be with you before the hour.  The unfortunate delay can be apportioned  between a blundering pilot and an intrusive sandbank.  I fear that it  has given my colleague, Professor Summerlee, occasion to blaspheme.\"    \"I am bound to say, sir,\" said Lord John, with some sternness of voice,  \"that your turning up is a considerable relief to us, for our mission  seemed to have come to a premature end.  Even now I can't for the life  of me understand why you should have worked it in so extraordinary a  manner.\"    Instead of answering, Professor Challenger entered, shook hands with  myself and Lord John, bowed with ponderous insolence to Professor  Summerlee, and sank back into a basket-chair, which creaked and swayed  beneath his weight.    \"Is all ready for your journey?\" he asked.    \"We can start to-morrow.\"    \"Then so you shall.  You need no chart of directions now, since you  will have the inestimable advantage of my own guidance.  From the first  I had determined that I would myself preside over your investigation.  The most elaborate charts would, as you will readily admit, be a poor  substitute for my own intelligence and advice.  As to the small ruse  which I played upon you in the matter of the envelope, it is clear  that, had I told you all my intentions, I should have been forced to  resist unwelcome pressure to travel out with you.\"    \"Not from me, sir!\" exclaimed Professor Summerlee, heartily.  \"So long  as there was another ship upon the Atlantic.\"    Challenger waved him away with his great hairy hand.    \"Your common sense will, I am sure, sustain my objection and realize  that it was better that I should direct my own movements and appear  only at the exact moment when my presence was needed.  That moment has  now arrived.  You are in safe hands.  You will not now fail to reach  your destination.  From henceforth I take command of this expedition,  and I must ask you to complete your preparations to-night, so that we  may be able to make an early start in the morning.  My time is of  value, and the same thing may be said, no doubt, in a lesser degree of  your own.  I propose, therefore, that we push on as rapidly as  possible, until I have demonstrated what you have come to see.\"    Lord John Roxton has chartered a large steam launch, the Esmeralda,  which was to carry us up the river.  So far as climate goes, it was  immaterial what time we chose for our expedition, as the temperature  ranges from seventy-five to ninety degrees both summer and winter, with  no appreciable difference in heat.  In moisture, however, it is  otherwise; from December to May is the period of the rains, and during  this time the river slowly rises until it attains a height of nearly  forty feet above its low-water mark.  It floods the banks, extends in  great lagoons over a monstrous waste of country, and forms a huge  district, called locally the Gapo, which is for the most part too  marshy for foot-travel and too shallow for boating.  About June the  waters begin to fall, and are at their lowest at October or November.  Thus our expedition was at the time of the dry season, when the great  river and its tributaries were more or less in a normal condition.    The current of the river is a slight one, the drop being not greater  than eight inches in a mile.  No stream could be more convenient for  navigation, since the prevailing wind is south-east, and sailing boats  may make a continuous progress to the Peruvian frontier, dropping down  again with the current.  In our own case the excellent engines of the  Esmeralda could disregard the sluggish flow of the stream, and we made  as rapid progress as if we were navigating a stagnant lake.  For three  days we steamed north-westwards up a stream which even here, a thousand  miles from its mouth, was still so enormous that from its center the  two banks were mere shadows upon the distant skyline.  On the fourth  day after leaving Manaos we turned into a tributary which at its mouth  was little smaller than the main stream.  It narrowed rapidly, however,  and after two more days' steaming we reached an Indian village, where  the Professor insisted that we should land, and that the Esmeralda  should be sent back to Manaos.  We should soon come upon rapids, he  explained, which would make its further use impossible.  He added  privately that we were now approaching the door of the unknown country,  and that the fewer whom we took into our confidence the better it would  be.  To this end also he made each of us give our word of honor that we  would publish or say nothing which would give any exact clue as to the  whereabouts of our travels, while the servants were all solemnly sworn  to the same effect.  It is for this reason that I am compelled to be  vague in my narrative, and I would warn my readers that in any map or  diagram which I may give the relation of places to each other may be  correct, but the points of the compass are carefully confused, so that  in no way can it be taken as an actual guide to the country.  Professor  Challenger's reasons for secrecy may be valid or not, but we had no  choice but to adopt them, for he was prepared to abandon the whole  expedition rather than modify the conditions upon which he would guide  us.    It was August 2nd when we snapped our last link with the outer world by  bidding farewell to the Esmeralda.  Since then four days have passed,  during which we have engaged two large canoes from the Indians, made of  so light a material (skins over a bamboo framework) that we should be  able to carry them round any obstacle.  These we have loaded with all  our effects, and have engaged two additional Indians to help us in the  navigation.  I understand that they are the very two--Ataca and Ipetu  by name--who accompanied Professor Challenger upon his previous  journey.  They appeared to be terrified at the prospect of repeating  it, but the chief has patriarchal powers in these countries, and if the  bargain is good in his eyes the clansman has little choice in the  matter.    So to-morrow we disappear into the unknown.  This account I am  transmitting down the river by canoe, and it may be our last word to  those who are interested in our fate.  I have, according to our  arrangement, addressed it to you, my dear Mr. McArdle, and I leave it  to your discretion to delete, alter, or do what you like with it.  From  the assurance of Professor Challenger's manner--and in spite of the  continued scepticism of Professor Summerlee--I have no doubt that our  leader will make good his statement, and that we are really on the eve  of some most remarkable experiences.                                     CHAPTER VIII                 \"The Outlying Pickets of the New World\"    Our friends at home may well rejoice with us, for we are at our goal,  and up to a point, at least, we have shown that the statement of  Professor Challenger can be verified.  We have not, it is true,  ascended the plateau, but it lies before us, and even Professor  Summerlee is in a more chastened mood.  Not that he will for an instant  admit that his rival could be right, but he is less persistent in his  incessant objections, and has sunk for the most part into an observant  silence.  I must hark back, however, and continue my narrative from  where I dropped it.  We are sending home one of our local Indians who  is injured, and I am committing this letter to his charge, with  considerable doubts in my mind as to whether it will ever come to hand.    When I wrote last we were about to leave the Indian village where we  had been deposited by the Esmeralda.  I have to begin my report by bad  news, for the first serious personal trouble (I pass over the incessant  bickerings between the Professors) occurred this evening, and might  have had a tragic ending.  I have spoken of our English-speaking  half-breed, Gomez--a fine worker and a willing fellow, but afflicted, I  fancy, with the vice of curiosity, which is common enough among such  men.  On the last evening he seems to have hid himself near the hut in  which we were discussing our plans, and, being observed by our huge  negro Zambo, who is as faithful as a dog and has the hatred which all  his race bear to the half-breeds, he was dragged out and carried into  our presence.  Gomez whipped out his knife, however, and but for the  huge strength of his captor, which enabled him to disarm him with one  hand, he would certainly have stabbed him.  The matter has ended in  reprimands, the opponents have been compelled to shake hands, and there  is every hope that all will be well.  As to the feuds of the two  learned men, they are continuous and bitter.  It must be admitted that  Challenger is provocative in the last degree, but Summerlee has an acid  tongue, which makes matters worse.  Last night Challenger said that he  never cared to walk on the Thames Embankment and look up the river, as  it was always sad to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1390"],[0,"The Jimmyjohn Boss, and Other Stories (#14)"],[1,"'em over, an' balks, an' mires down, an' backs out, an  starts fresh, en' it's confusin' to foller him.\"    \"I'm glad to see you take so much interest, gentlemen,\" said I.    \"Yes, we're apt to see it through,\" said the barkeeper. And Stuart and I  bade them a good-morning.    As we neared the school-master's house, where Stuart was next taking me,  we came again upon the boys with Josey, and no barkeeper at hand to \"see  him through.\" But Josey made it needless. At the word \"Chicken-legs\" he  flew in a limber manner upon the nearest, and knocking him immediately  flat, turned with spirit upon a second and kicked him. At this they set  up a screeching and fell all together, and the school-master came out of  his door.    \"Boys, boys!\" said he. \"And the Sabbath too!\"    As this did not immediately affect them, Mr. Eastman made a charge, and  they fled from him then. A long stocking of Josey's was torn, and hung  in two streamers round his ankles; and his dangling shoe-laces were  trodden to fringe.    \"If you want your hand to get well for strawberry night--\" began Mr.  Eastman.    \"Ah, bother strawberry night!\" said Josey, and hopped at one of his  playmates. But Mr. Eastman caught him skilfully by the collar.    \"I am glad his misfortunes have not crushed him altogether,\" said I.    \"Josey Yeatts is an anxious case, sir,\" returned the teacher. \"Several  influences threaten his welfare. Yesterday I found tobacco on him.  Chewing, sir.\"    \"Just you hurt me,\" said Josey, \"and I'll tell Abe.\"    \"Abe!\" exclaimed Mr. Eastman, lifting his brow. \"He means a man old  enough to be his father, sir. I endeavor to instill him with some few  notions of respect, but the town spoils him. Indulges him completely, I  may say. And when Sharon's sympathies are stirred sir, it will espouse a  cause very warmly--Give me that!\" broke off the schoolmaster, and there  followed a brief wrestle. \"Chewing again to-day, sir,\" he added to me.    \"Abe lemme have it,\" shrieked Josey. \"Lemme go, or he'll come over and  fix you.\"    But the calm, chilly Eastman had ground the tobacco under his heel. \"You  can understand how my hands are tied,\" he said to me.    \"Readily,\" I answered.    \"The men give Josey his way in everything. He has a--I may say an  unworthy aunt.\"    \"Yes,\" said I. \"So I have gathered.\"    At this point Josey ducked and slid free, and the united flock vanished  with jeers at us. Josey forgot they had insulted him, they forgot he had  beaten them; against a common enemy was their friendship cemented.    \"You spoke of Sharon's warm way of espousing causes,\" said I to Eastman.    \"I did, sir. No one could live here long without noticing it.\"    \"Sharon is a quiet town, but sudden,\" remarked Stuart. \"Apt to be  sudden. They're beginning about strawberry night,\" he said to Eastman.  \"Wanted to know about things down in the saloon.\"    \"How does their taste in elocution chiefly lie?\" I inquired.    Eastman smiled. He was young, totally bald, the moral dome of his skull  rising white above visionary eyes and a serious auburn beard. He  was clothed in a bleak, smooth slate-gray suit, and at any climax of  emphasis he lifted slightly upon his toes and relaxed again, shutting  his lips tight on the finished sentence. \"Your question,\" said he, \"has  often perplexed me. Sometimes they seem to prefer verse; sometimes prose  stirs them greatly. We shall have a liberal crop of both this year. I am  proud to tell you I have augmented our number of strawberry speakers by  nearly fifty per cent.\"    \"How many will there be?\" said I.    \"Eleven. You might wish some could be excused. But I let them speak to  stimulate their interest in culture. Will you not take dinner with me,  gentlemen? I was just sitting down when little Josey Yeatts brought me  out.\"    We were glad to do this, and he opened another can of corned beef for  us. \"I cannot offer you wine, sir,\" said he to me, \"though I am aware it  is a general habit in luxurious homes.\" And he tightened his lips.    \"General habit wherever they don't prefer whiskey,\" said Stuart.    \"I fear so,\" the school-master replied, smiling. \"That poison shall  never enter my house, gentlemen, any more than tobacco. And as I cannot  reform the adults of Sharon, I am doing what I can for their children.  Little Hugh Straight is going to say his 'Lochinvar' very pleasingly,  Mr. Stuart. I went over it with him last night. I like them to be word  perfect,\" he continued to me, \"as failures on exhibition night elicit  unfavorable comment.\"    \"And are we to expect failures also?\" I inquired.    \"Reuben Gadsden is likely to mortify us. He is an earnest boy, but  nervous; and one or two others. But I have limited their length. Reuben  Gadsden's father declined to have his boy cut short, and he will give  us a speech of Burke's; but I hope for the best. It narrows down, it  narrows down. Guy Jeffries and Leola Mattern are the two.\"    \"The parents seem to take keen interest,\" said I.    Mr. Eastman smiled at Stuart. \"We have no reason to suppose they have  changed since last year,\" said he. \"Why, sir,\" he suddenly exclaimed,  \"if I did not feel I was doing something for the young generation  here, I should leave Sharon to-morrow! One is not appreciated, not  appreciated.\"    He spoke fervently of various local enterprises, his failures, his  hopes, his achievements; and I left his house honoring him, but  amazed--his heart was so wide and his head so narrow; a man who would  purify with simultaneous austerity the morals of Lochinvar and of  Sharon.    \"About once a month,\" said Stuart, \"I run against a new side he is blind  on. Take his puzzlement as to whether they prefer verse or prose. Queer  and dumb of him that, you see. Sharon does not know the difference  between verse and prose.\"    \"That's going too far,\" said I.    \"They don't,\" he repeated, \"when it comes to strawberry night. If the  piece is about something they understand, rhymes do not help or hinder.  And of course sex is apt to settle the question.\"    \"Then I should have thought Leola--\" I began.    \"Not the sex of the speaker. It's the listeners. Now you take women.  Women generally prefer something that will give them a good cry. We men  want to laugh mostly.\"    \"Yes,\" said I; \"I would rather laugh myself, I think.\"    \"You'd know you'd rather if you had to live in Sharon. The laugh is one  of the big differences between women and men, and I would give you my  views about it, only my Sunday-off time is up, and I've got to go to  telegraphing.\"    \"Our ways are together,\" said I. \"I'm going back to the railroad hotel.\"    \"There's Guy,\" continued Stuart. \"He took the prize on 'The Jumping  Frog.' Spoke better than Leola, anyhow. She spoke 'The Wreck of  the Hesperus.' But Guy had the back benches--that's where the men  sit--pretty well useless. Guess if there had been a fire, some of  the fellows would have been scorched before they'd have got strength  sufficient to run out. But the ladies did not laugh much. Said they saw  nothing much in jumping a frog. And if Leola had made 'em cry good and  hard that night, the committee's decision would have kicked up more of a  fuss than it did. As it was, Mrs. Mattern got me alone; but I worked us  around to where Mrs. Jeffries was having her ice-cream, and I left them  to argue it out.\"    \"Let us adhere to that policy,\" I said to Stuart; and he replied  nothing, but into the corner of his eye wandered that lurking smile  which revealed that life brought him compensations.    He went to telegraphing, and I to revery concerning strawberry night.  I found myself wishing now that there could have been two prizes; I  desired both Leola and Guy to be happy; and presently I found the matter  would be very close, so far at least as my judgment went. For boy and  girl both brought me their selections, begging I would coach them, and  this I had plenty of leisure to do. I preferred Guy's choice--the story  of that blue-jay who dropped nuts through the hole in a roof, expecting  to fill it, and his friends came to look on and discovered the hole went  into the entire house. It is better even than \"The Jumping Frog\"--better  than anything, I think--and young Guy told it well. But Leola brought a  potent rival on the tearful side of things. \"The Death of Paul Dombey\"  is plated pathos, not wholly sterling; but Sharon could not know this;  and while Leola most prettily recited it to me I would lose my recent  opinion in favor of Guy, and acknowledge the value of her performance.  Guy might have the men strong for him, but this time the women were  going to cry. I got also a certain other sort of entertainment out of  the competing mothers. Mrs. Jeffries and Mrs. Mattern had a way of being  in the hotel office at hours when I passed through to meals. They never  came together, and always were taken by surprise at meeting me.    \"Leola is ever so grateful to you,\" Mrs. Mattern would say.    \"Oh,\" I would answer, \"do not speak of it. Have you ever heard Guy's  'Blue-Jay' story?\"    \"Well, if it's anything like that frog business, I don't want to.\" And  the lady would leave me.    \"Guy tells me you are helping him so kindly,\" said Mrs. Jeffries.    \"Oh yes, I'm severe,\"' I answered, brightly. \"I let nothing pass. I only  wish I was as careful with Leola. But as soon as she begins 'Paul had  never risen from his little bed,' I just lose myself listening to her.\"    On the whole, there were also compensations for me in these mothers, and  I thought it as well to secure them in advance.    When the train arrived from El Paso, and I saw our strawberries and our  ice-cream taken out, I felt the hour to be at hand, and that whatever  our decision, no bias could be laid to me. According to his prudent  habit, Eastman had the speakers follow each other alphabetically. This  happened to place Leola after Guy, and perhaps might give her the last  word, as it were, with the people; but our committee was there, and"]]]
