In witness whereof,  he has signed these presents, and begs the king to be pleased to pardon  those towards whom he is ill disposed on account of this business.  CHARLES.\"  In writing this letter the constable had no other object than  to gain a little time, for, on bidding good by to the Bishop of Autun,  he said to him, \"Farewell, my dear bishop; I am off to Carlat, and from  Carlat I shall slip away with five or six horses on my road to Spain.\"  On the next day but one, indeed, the 8th of September, 1523, whilst the  Bishop of Autun was kept prisoner by the troops sent forward to  Chantelle, the constable sallied from it about one in the morning, taking  with him five-and-twenty or thirty thousand crowns of gold sewn up in  from twelve to fifteen jackets, each of which was intrusted to a man in  his train.  For a month he wandered about Bourbonness, Auvergne,  Burgundy, Beaujolais, Vienness, Languedoc, and Dauphiny, incessantly  changing his road, his comrades, his costume, and his asylum,  occasionally falling in with soldiers of the king who were repairing to  Italy, and seeking for some place whence he might safely concert with and  act with his allies.  At last, in the beginning of October, he arrived at  Saint-Claude, in Franche-Comte, imperial territory, and on the 9th of  October he made his entry into Besancon, where there came to join him  some of his partisans who from necessity or accident had got separated  from him, without his having been able anywhere in his progress to excite  any popular movement, form any collection of troops, or intrench himself  strongly in his own states.  To judge from appearances, he was now but a  fugitive conspirator, without domains and without an army.    Such, however, were his fame and importance as a great lord and great  warrior, that Francis I., as soon as he knew him to be beyond his reach  and in a fair way to co-operate actively with his enemies, put off his  departure for Italy, and \"offered the redoubtable fugitive immediate  restitution of his possessions, reimbursement from the royal treasury of  what was due to him, renewal of his pensions and security that they would  be paid him with punctuality.\"  Bourbon refused everything.  \"It is too  late,\" he replied.  Francis I.'s envoy then asked him to give up the  sword of constable and the collar of the order of St.  Michael.  \"You  will tell the king,\" rejoined Bourbon, \"that he took from me the sword  of constable on the day that he took from me the command of the  advance-guard to give it to M. d'Alencon.  As for the collar of his  order, you will find it at Chantelle under the pillow of my bed.\"  Francis I., in order to win back Bourbon, had recourse to his sister, the  Duchess of Lorraine [Renee de Bourbon, who had married, in 1515, Antony,  called the Good, Duke of Lorraine, son of Duke Rend II. and his second  wife, Philippine of Gueldres]: but she was not more successful.  After  sounding him, she wrote to Francis I. that the duke her brother \"was  determined to go through with his enterprise, and that he proposed to  draw off towards Flanders by way of Lorraine with eighteen hundred horse  and ten thousand foot, and form a junction with the King of England.\"  [M. Mignet, _Etude sur le Connetable de Bourbon, in the Revue des Deux  Mondes_ of January 15, 1854, and March 15 and April 1, 1858.]    Under such grave and urgent circumstances, Francis I. behaved on the one  hand with more prudence and efficiency than he had yet displayed, and on  the other with his usual levity and indulgence towards his favorites.  Abandoning his expedition in person into Italy, he first concerned  himself for that internal security of his kingdom, which was threatened  on the east and north by the Imperialists and the English, and on the  south by the Spaniards, all united in considerable force and already in  motion.  Francis opposed to them in the east and north the young Count  Claude of Guise, the first celebrity amongst his celebrated race, the  veteran Louis de La Tremoille, the most tried of all his warriors, and  the Duke of Vendome, head of the younger branch of the House of Bourbon.  Into the south he sent Marshal de Lautrec, who was more brave than  successful, but of proved fidelity.  All these captains acquitted  themselves honorably.  Claude of Guise defeated a body of twelve thousand  lanzknechts who had already penetrated into Champagne; he hurled them  back into Lorraine, and dispersed them beneath the walls of the little  town of Neufchateau, where the princesses and ladies of Lorraine, showing  themselves at the windows, looked on and applauded their discomfiture.  La Tremoille's only forces were very inferior to the thirty-five thousand  Imperialists or English who had entered Picardy; but he managed to make  of his small garrisons such prompt and skilful use that the invaders were  unable to get hold of a single place, and advanced somewhat heedlessly to  the very banks of the Oise, whence the alarm spread rapidly to Paris.  The Duke of Vendome, whom the king at once despatched thither with a  small body of men-at-arms, marched night and day to the assistance of the  Parisians, harangued the Parliament and Hotel de Ville vehemently on the  conspiracy of the Constable de Bourbon, and succeeded so well in  reassuring them that companies of the city militia eagerly joined his  troops, and the foreigners, in dread of finding themselves hemmed in,  judged it prudent to fall back, leaving Picardy in a state of equal  irritation and devastation.  In the south, Lautrec, after having made  head for three days and three nights against the attacks of a Spanish  army which had crossed the Pyrenees under the orders of the Constable of  Castille, forced it to raise the siege and beat a retreat.  Everywhere,  in the provinces as well as at the court, the feudal nobility, chieftains  and simple gentlemen, remained faithful to the king; the magistrates and  the people supported the military; it was the whole nation that rose  against the great lord, who, for his own purposes, was making alliance  with foreigners against the king and the country.    In respect of Italy, Francis I. was less wise and less successful.  Not  only did he persist in the stereotyped madness of the conquest of  Milaness and the kingdom of Naples, but abandoning for the moment the  prosecution of it in person, he intrusted it to his favorite, Admiral  Bonnivet, a brave soldier, alternately rash and backward, presumptuous  and irresolute, who had already lost credit by the mistakes he had  committed and the reverses he had experienced in that arena.  At the very  juncture when Francis I. confided this difficult charge to Bonnivet, the  Constable de Bourbon, having at last got out of France, crossed Germany,  repaired to Italy, and halted at Mantua, Piacenza, and Genoa; and, whilst  waiting for a reply from Charles V., whom he had informed of his arrival,  he associated with the leaders of the imperial armies, lived amongst the  troops, inoculated them with his own ardor as well as warlike views, and  by his natural superiority regained, amongst the European coalition, the  consideration and authority which had been somewhat diminished by his  ill-success in his own country and his flight from it.  Charles V. was  some time about sending an answer; for, in his eyes also, Bourbon had  fallen somewhat.  \"Was it prudent,\" says the historian of Bourbon  himself, \"to trust a prince who, though born near the throne, had  betrayed his own blood and forsworn his own country?  Charles V. might no  doubt have insured his fidelity, had he given him in marriage Eleanor of  Austria, who was already affianced to him; but he could not make up his  mind to unite the destiny of a princess, his own sister, with that of a  prince whose position was equally pitiable and criminal.  At last,  however, he decided to name him his lieutenant-general in Italy; but he  surrounded him with so many colleagues and so much surveillance that he  had nothing to fear from his remorse and repentance.\"  [_Histoire de la  Maison de Bourbon,_ t. ii.  p. 531.] Bourbon, however, though thus placed  in a position of perplexity and difficulty, was none the less an  adversary with whom Bonnivet was not in a condition to cope.    It was not long before this was proved by facts.  The campaign of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11956"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 6 (#14)"],[1,"and despair caused by  the necessary and logical development of Law's system, the Duke of  Orleans had dealt other blows and directed other affairs of importance.  Easy-going, indolent, often absorbed by his pleasures, the Regent found  no great difficulty in putting up with the exaltation of the  legitimatized princes; it had been for him sufficient to wrest authority  from the Duke of Maine, he let him enjoy the privileges of a prince of  the blood.  \"I kept silence during the king's lifetime,\" he would say;  \"I will not be mean enough to break it now he is dead.\"  But the Duke of  Bourbon, heir of the House of Conde, fierce in temper, violent in his  hate, greedy of honors as well as of money, had just arrived at man's  estate, and was wroth at sight of the bastards' greatness.  He drew after  him the Count of Charolais his brother, and the Prince of Conti his  cousin; on the 22d of April, 1716, all three presented to the king a  request for the revocation of Louis XIV.'s edict declaring his  legitimatized sons princes of the blood, and capable of succeeding to the  throne.  The Duchess of Maine, generally speaking very indifferent about  her husband, whom she treated haughtily, like a true daughter of the  House of Conde, flew into a violent passion, this time, at her cousins'  unexpected attack; she was for putting her own hand to the work of  drawing up the memorial of her husband and of her brother-in-law, the  Count of Toulouse.  \"The greater part of the nights was employed at it,\"  says Madame de Stael, at that time Mdlle. do Launay, a person of much  wit, half lady's maid, half reader to the duchess.  \"The huge volumes,  heaped up on her bed like mountains overwhelming her, caused her,\" she  used to say, \"to look, making due allowances, like Enceladus, buried  under Mount AEtna.  I was present at the work, and I also used to turn  over the leaves of old chronicles and of ancient and modern  jurisconsults, until excess of fatigue disposed the princess to take  some repose.\"    [Illustration: The Duke of Maine----71]    All this toil ended in the following declaration on the part of the  legitimatized princes: \"The affair, being one of state, cannot be decided  but by a king, who is a major, or indeed by the States-general.\"  At the  same time, and still at the instigation of the Duchess of Maine, thirty-  nine noblemen signed a petition, modestly addressad to \"Our Lords of the  Parliament,\" demanding, in their turn, that the affair should be referred  to the states-general, who alone were competent, when it was a question  of the succession to the throne.    The Regent saw the necessity of firmness.  \"It is a maxim,\" he declared,  \"that the king is always a major as regards justice; that which was done  without the states-general has no need of their intervention to be  undone.\"  The decree of the council of regency, based on the same  principles, suppressed the right of succession to the crown, and cut  short all pretensions on the part of the legitimatized princes' issue to  the rank of princes of the blood; the rights thereto were maintained in  the case of the Duke of Maine and the Count of Toulouse, for their lives,  by the bounty of the Regent, \"which did not prevent the Duchess of Maine  from uttering loud shrieks, like a maniac,\" says St.  Simon, \"or the  Duchess of Orleans from weeping night and day, and refusing for two  months to see anybody.\"  Of the thirty-nine members of the nobility who  had signed the petition to Parliament, six were detained in prison for a  month, after which the Duke of Orleans pardoned them.  \"You know me, well  enough to be aware that I am only nasty when I consider myself positively  obliged to be,\" he said to them.  The patrons, whose cause these noblemen  had lightly embraced, were not yet at the end of their humiliations.    [Illustrations: The Duchess of Maine----72]    The Duke of Bourbon was not satisfied with their exclusion from the  succession to the throne; he claimed the king's education, which belonged  of right, he said, to the first prince of the blood, being a major.  In  his hatred, then, towards the legitimatized, he accepted with alacrity  the Duke of St. Simon's proposal to simply reduce them to their rank by  seniority in the peerage, with the proviso of afterwards restoring the  privileges of a prince of the blood in favor of the Count of Toulouse  alone, as a reward for his services in the navy.  The blow thus dealt  gratified all the passions of the House of Conde and the wrath of Law,  as well as that of the keeper of the seals, D'Argenson, against the  Parliament, which for three months past had refused to enregister all  edicts.  On the 24th of August, 1718, at six in the morning, the  Parliament received orders to repair to the Tuileries, where the king was  to hold a bed of justice., The Duke of Maine, who was returning from a  party, was notified, as colonel of the Swiss, to have his regiment under  arms; at eight o'clock the council of regency was already assembled; the  Duke of Maine and the Count of Toulouse arrived in peer's robes.  The  Regent had flattered himself that they would not come to the bed of  justice, and had not summoned them.  He at once advanced towards the  Count of Toulouse, and said out loud that he was surprised to see him in  his robes, and that he had not thought proper to notify him of the bed of  justice, because he knew that, since the last edict, he did not like  going to the Parliament.  The Count of Toulouse replied that that was  quite true, but that, when it was a question of the welfare of the State,  he put every other consideration aside.  The Regent was disconcerted; he  hesitated a moment, then, speaking low and very earnestly to the Count of  Toulouse, he returned to St. Simon.  \"I have just told him all,\" said he,  \"I couldn't help it; he is the best fellow in the world, and the one who  touches my heart the most.  He was coming to me on behalf of his brother,  who had a shrewd notion that there was something in the wind, and that he  did not stand quite well with me; he had begged him to ask me whether I  wished him to remain, or whether he would not do well to go away.  I  confess to you that I thought I did well to tell him that his brother  would do just as well to go away, since he asked me the question; that,  as for himself, he might safely remain, because he was to continue just  as he is, without alteration; but that something might take place rather  disagreeable to M. du Maine.  Whereupon, he asked me how he could remain,  when there was to be an attack upon his brother, seeing that they were  but one, both in point of honor and as brothers.  I do believe, there  they are just going out,\" added the Regent, casting a glance towards the  door, as the members of the council were beginning to take their places:  \"they will be prudent; the Count of Toulouse promised me so.\"  \"But, if  they were to do anything foolish, or were to leave Paris?\"  \"They shall  be arrested, I give you my word,\" replied the Duke of Orleans, in a  firmer tone than usual.  They had just read the decree reducing the  legitimatized to their degree in the peerage, and M. le Duc had claimed  the superintendence of the king's education, when it was announced that  the Parliament, in their scarlet robes, were arriving in the court of the  palace.  Marshal de Villeroi alone dared to protest.  \"Here, then,\" said  he with a sigh, \"are all the late king's dispositions upset; I cannot see  it without sorrow.  M. du Maine is very unfortunate.\"  \"Sir,\" rejoined  the Regent, with animation, \"M. du Maine is my brother-in-law, but I  prefer an open to a hidden enemy.\"    With the same air the Duke of Orleans passed to the bed of justice, \"with  a gentle but resolute majesty, which was quite new to him; eyes  observant, but bearing grave and easy; M. le Duc staid, circumspect,  surrounded by a sort of radiance that adorned his whole person, and under  perceptible restraint; the keeper of the seals, in his chair, motionless,  gazing askance with that witful fire which flashed from his eyes and  which seemed to pierce all bosoms, in presence of that Parliament which  had so often given him orders standing at its bar as chief of police, in  presence of that premier president, so superior to him, so haughty, so  proud of his Duke of Maine, so mightily in hopes of the seals.\"  After  his speech, and the reading of the king's decree, the premier president  was for attempting a remonstrance; D'Argenson mounted the step,  approached the young king, and then, without taking any opinion, said, in  a very loud voice, \"The king desires to be obeyed, and obeyed at once.\"  There was nothing further for it but to enregister the edict; all the  decrees of the Parliament were quashed.    Some old servants of Louis XIV., friends and confidants of the Duke of  Maine, alone appeared moved.  The young king was laughing, and the crowd  of spectators were amusing themselves with the scene, without any  sensible interest in the court intrigues.  The Duchess of Maine made her  husband pay for his humble behavior at the council; \"she was,\" says St.  Simon, \"at one time motionless with grief, at another boiling with rage,  and her poor husband wept daily like a calf at the biting reproaches and  strange insults which he had incessantly to pocket in her fits of anger  against him.\"    In the excess of her indignation and wrath, the Duchess of Maine  determined not to confine herself to reproaches.  She had passed her life  in elegant entertainments, in sprightly and frivolous intellectual  amusements; ever bent on diverting herself, she made up her mind to taste  the pleasure of vengeance, and set on foot a conspiracy, as frivolous as  her diversions.  The object, however, was nothing less than to overthrow  the Duke of Orleans, and to confer the regency on the King of Spain,  Philip V., with a council and a lieutenant, who was to be the Duke"]]]
