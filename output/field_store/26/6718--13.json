[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14293"],[0,"The Complete Book of Cheese (#14)"],[1," feel really       grateful to hens. From its name it originated probably in Italy,       but it has crossed the Alps. I have often met it in France, but       only once in Italy.         First of all, make a very stiff white sauce with butter, flour       and milk. The sauce should be stiff enough to allow the wooden       spoon to stand upright or almost.         Off the fire, add yolks of eggs and 4 ounces of grated Gruyere       cheese. Mix this in well with the white sauce and season with       salt, pepper and some grated nutmeg. Beat whites of egg firm. Add       the whites to the preparation, stir in, and pour into a pudding       basin.         Take a large saucepan and fill half full of water. Bring to a       boil, and then place the pudding basin so that the top of the       basin is well out of the water. Allow to boil gently for 1-1/2 to       2 hours. Renew the boiling water from time to time, as it       evaporates, and take care that the water, in boiling, does not       bubble over the mixture.         Test with a knife, as for a cake, to see if it is cooked. When       the knife comes out clean, take the basin out of the water and       turn the Fondue out on a dish. It should be fairly firm and keep       the shape of the basin.         Sprinkle with some finely chopped ham and serve hot.    The imported Swiss sometimes is cubed instead of grated, then  marinated for four or five hours in dry white wine, before being  melted and liquored with the schnapps. This can be pleasantly adopted  here in:       All-American Fondue    1 pound imported Swiss cheese, cubed  3/4 cup scuppernong or other American white wine  1-1/2 jiggers applejack         After marinating the Swiss cubes in the wine, simply melt       together over hot water, stir until soft and creamy, add the       applejack and dunk with fingers of toast or your own to a chorus       of \"All Bound Round with a Woolen String.\"         Of course, this can be treated as a mere vinous Welsh Rabbit and       poured over toast, to be accompanied by beer. But wine is the       thing, for the French Fondue is to dry wine what the Rabbit is to       stale ale or fresh beer.    We say French instead of Swiss because the French took over the dish  so eagerly, together with the great Gruyere that makes it distinctive.  They internationalized it, sent it around the world with bouillabaisse  and onion soup, that celestial _soupe a l'oignon_ on which snowy  showers of grated Gruyere descend.    To put the Welsh Rabbit in its place they called it Fondue a  l'Anglaise, which also points up the twinlike relationship of the  world's two favorite dishes of melted cheese. But to differentiate and  show they are not identical twins, the No. 1 dish remained Fromage  Fondue while the second was baptized Fromage Fondue a la Biere.    Beginning with Savarin the French whisked up more rapturous,  rhapsodic writing about Gruyere and its offspring, the Fondue,  together with the puffed Souffle, than about any other imported cheese  except Parmesan.    Parmesan and Gruyere were praised as the two greatest culinary  cheeses. A variant Fondue was made of the Italian cheese.       Parmesan Fondue    3 tablespoons butter  1 cup grated Parmesan cheese  4 eggs, lightly beaten  Salt  Pepper         Over boiling water melt butter and cheese slowly, stir in the       eggs, season to taste and stir steadily in one direction only,       until smooth.         Pour over fingers of buttered toast. Or spoon it up, as the       ancients did, before there were any forks. It's beaten with a       fork but eaten catch-as-catch-can, like chicken-in-the-rough.       Sapsago Swiss Fondue    2 tablespoons butter  2 tablespoons flour  1/2 teaspoon salt  1-1/2 cups milk  2-1/2 cups shredded Swiss cheese  2-1/2 tablespoons grated Sapsago  1/2 cup dry white wine  Pepper, black and red, freshly ground  Fingers of toast         Over boiling water stir the first four ingredients into a smooth,       fairly thick cream sauce. Then stir in Swiss cheese until well       melted. After that add the Sapsago, finely grated, and wine in       small splashes. Stir steadily, in one direction only, until       velvety. Season sharply with the contrasting peppers and serve       over fingers of toast.    This is also nice when served bubbling in individual, preheated  pastry shells, casseroles or ramekins, although this way most of the  fun of the dunking party is left out. To make up for it, however,  cooked slices of mushrooms are sometimes added.    At the Cheese Cellar in the New York World's Fair Swiss Pavilion,  where a continual dunking party was in progress, thousands of amateurs  learned such basic things as not to overcook the Fondue lest it become  stringy, and the protocol of dunking in turn and keeping the mass in  continual motion until the next on the Fondue line dips in his cube of  bread. The success of the dish depends on making it quickly, keeping  it gently a-bubble and never letting it stand still for a split  second.    The Swiss, who consume three or four times as much cheese per capita  as we, and almost twice as much as the French, are willing to share  Fondue honors with the French Alpine province of Savoy, a natural  cheese cellar with almost two dozen distinctive types of its very own,  such as Fat cheese, also called Death's Head; La Grande Bornand, a  luscious half-dried sheep's milker; Chevrotins, small, dry goat milk  cheeses; and Le Vacherin. The latter, made in both Savoy and  Switzerland, boasts two interesting variants:         1. _Vacherin Fondue or Spiced Fondue:_ Made about the same as       Emmentaler, ripened to sharp age, and then melted, spices added       and the cheese re-formed. It is also called Spiced Fondue and       sells for about two dollars a pound. Named Fondue from being       melted, though it's really recooked,         2. _Vacherin a la Main:_ This is a curiosity in cheeses,       resembling a cold, uncooked Fondue. Made of cow's milk, it is       round, a foot in diameter and half a foot high. It is salted and       aged until the rind is hard and the inside more runny than the       ripest Camembert, so it can be eaten with a spoon (like the       cooked Fondue) as well as spread on bread. The local name for it       is _Tome de Montagne_.    Here is a good assortment of Fondues:       Vacherin-Fribourg Fondue    2 tablespoons butter  1 clove garlic, crushed  2 cups shredded Vacherin cheese  2 tablespoons hot water         This authentic quickie is started by cooking the garlic in butter       until the butter is melted. Then remove garlic and reduce heat.       Add the soft cheese and stir with silver fork until smooth and       velvety. Add the water in little splashes, stirring constantly in       one direction. Dunk! (In this melted Swiss a little water takes       the place of a lot of wine.)       La Fondue Comtois         This regional specialty of Franche-Comte is made with white wine.       Sauterne, Chablis, Riesling or any Rhenish type will serve       splendidly. Also use butter, grated Gruyere, beaten eggs and that       touch of garlic.       Chives Fondue    3 cups grated Swiss cheese  3 tablespoons flour  2 tablespoons butter  1 garlic clove, crushed  3 tablespoons finely chopped chives  1 cup dry white wine  Salt  Freshly ground pepper  A pinch of nutmeg  1/4 cup kirsch         Mix cheese and flour. Melt butter in chafing-dish blazer rubbed       with garlic. Cook chives in butter 1 minute. Add wine and heat       just under boiling. Keep simmering as you add cheese-and-flour       mix gradually, stirring always in one direction. Salt according       to age and sharpness of cheese; add plenty of freshly ground       pepper and the pinch of nutmeg.         When everything is stirred smooth and bubbling, toss in the       kirsch without missing a stroke of the fork and get to dunking.         Large, crisp, hot potato chips make a pleasant change for dunking       purposes. Or try assorted crackers alternating with the absorbent       bread, or hard rolls.       Tomato Fondue    2 tomatoes, skinned, seeded and chopped  1/2 teaspoon dried sweet basil  1 clove garlic  2 tablespoons butter  1/2 cup dry white wine  2 cups grated Cheddar cheese  Paprika         Mix basil with chopped tomatoes. Rub chafing dish with garlic,       melt butter, add tomatoes and much paprika. Cook 5 to 6 minutes,       add wine, stir steadily to boiling point. Then add cheese, half a       cup at a time, and keep stirring until everything is smooth.         Serve on hot toast, like Welsh Rabbit.    Here the two most popular melted-cheese dishes tangle, but they're  held together with the common ingredient, tomato.    Fondue also appears as a sauce to pour over baked tomatoes. Stale  bread crumbs are soaked in tomato juice to make:     Tomato Baked Fondue    1 cup tomato juice  1 cup stale bread crumbs  1 cup grated sharp American cheese  1 tablespoon melted butter  Salt  4 eggs, separated and well beaten         Soak crumbs in tomato juice, stir cheese in butter until melted,       season with a little or no salt, depending on saltiness of the       cheese. Mix in the beaten yolks, fold in the white and bake       about 50 minutes in moderate oven.      BAKED FONDUES    Although Savarin's dunking Fondue was first to make a sensation on  these shores and is still in highest esteem among epicures, the Fondue  America took to its bosom was baked. The original recipe came from the  super-caseous province of Savoy under the explicit title, _La Fondue  au Fromage_.       La Fondue au Fromage         Make the usual creamy mixture of butter, flour, milk, yolks of       eggs and Gruyere, in thin slices for a change. Use red pepper       instead of black, splash in a jigger of kirsch but no white wine.       Finally fold in the egg whites and bake in a mold for 45 minutes.    We adapted this to our national taste which had already based the  whole business of melted "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14297"],[0,"The Congo and Coasts of Africa (#14)"],[1," the common-sense type. Like  other rich men of their race, they have given largely to charity and  to assist those less fortunate than themselves.    For thirteen years in mines in Mexico, in China, and Alaska, they  have had to deal with the problem of labor, and they have met it  successfully. Workmen of three nationalities they have treated with  fairness.    \"Why should you suppose,\" Mr. Daniel Guggenheim asked me, \"that in  the Congo we will treat the negroes harshly? In Mexico we found the  natives ill-paid and ill-fed. We fed them and paid them well. Not  from any humanitarian idea, but because it was good business. It is  not good business to cut off a workman's hands or head. We are not  ashamed of the way we have always treated our workmen, and in the  Congo we are not going to spoil our record.\"    I suggested that in Mexico he did not have as his partner Leopold,  tempting him with slave labor, and that the distance from Broadway  to his concessions in the Congo was so great that as to what his  agents might do there he could not possibly know. To this Mr.  Guggenheim answered that \"Neither Leopold nor anyone else can  dictate how we shall treat the native labor,\" that if his agents  were cruel they would be instantly dismissed, and that for what  occurred in the Congo on the land occupied by the American Congo  Company his brothers and himself alone were responsible, and that  they accepted that responsibility.    But already on his salary list he has men who are sure to get him  into trouble, men of whose _dossiers_ he is quite ignorant.    From Belgium, Leopold has unloaded on the American companies several  of his \"valets du roi,\" press agents, and tools, men who for years  have been defenders of his dirty work in the Congo; and of the  Americans, one, who is prominently exploited by the Belgians, had  to leave Africa for theft.    That Mr. Guggenheim wishes and intends to give to the black in the  Congo fair treatment there is no possible doubt. But that on  Broadway, removed from the scene of operations in time some four to  six months, and in actual distance eight thousand miles, he can  control the acts of his agents and his partners, remains to be  proved. He is attacking a problem much more momentous than the  handling of Mexican _peons_ or Chinese coolies, and every step of  the working out of this problem will be watched by the people of  this country.    And should they find that the example of the Belgian concessionaires  in their treatment of the natives is being imitated by even one of  the American Congo Company the people of this country will know it,  and may the Lord have mercy on his soul!          V    HUNTING THE HIPPO      Except once or twice in the Zoo, I never had seen a hippopotamus,  and I was most anxious, before I left the Congo, to meet one. I  wanted to look at him when he was free, and his own master, without  iron bars or keepers; when he believed he was quite alone, and was  enjoying his bath in peace and confidence. I also wanted to shoot  him, and to hang in my ancestral halls his enormous head with the  great jaws open and the inside of them painted pink and the small  tusks hungrily protruding. I had this desire, in spite of the fact  that for every hippo except the particular one whose head I coveted,  I entertained the utmost good feeling.    As a lad, among other beasts the hippopotamus had appealed to my  imagination. Collectively, I had always looked upon them as most  charming people. They come of an ancient family. Two thousand four  hundred years ago they were mentioned by Herodotus. And Herodotus to  the animal kingdom is what Domesday Book is to the landed gentry. To  exist beautifully for twenty-four hundred years without a single  mesalliance, without having once stooped to trade, is certainly a  strong title to nobility. Other animals by contact with man have  become degraded. The lion, the \"King of Beasts,\" now rides a  bicycle, and growls, as previously rehearsed, at the young woman in  spangles, of whom he is secretly afraid. And the elephant, the  monarch of the jungle, and of a family as ancient and noble as that  of the hippopotamus, the monarch of the river, has become a beast of  burden and works for his living. You can see him in Phoenix Park  dragging a road-roller, in Siam and India carrying logs, and at  Coney Island he bends the knee to little girls from Brooklyn. The  royal proboscis, that once uprooted trees, now begs for peanuts.    But, you never see a hippopotamus chained to a road-roller, or  riding a bicycle. He is still the gentleman, the man of elegant  leisure, the aristocrat of aristocrats, harming no one, and, in his  ancestral river, living the simple life.    And yet, I sought to kill him. At least, one of him, but only one.  And, that I did not kill even one, while a bitter disappointment, is  still a source of satisfaction.    In the Congo River we saw only two hippos, and both of them were  dead. They had been shot from a steamer. If the hippo is killed in  the water, it is impossible to recover the body at once. It sinks  and does not rise, some say, for an hour, others say for seven  hours. As in an hour the current may have carried the body four  miles below where it sank, the steamer does not wait, and the  destruction of the big beast is simple murder. There should be a law  in the Congo to prevent their destruction, and, no doubt, if the  State thought it could make a few francs out of protecting the  hippo, as it makes many million francs by preserving the elephant,  which it does for the ivory, such a law would exist. We soon saw  many hippos, but although we could not persuade the only other  passenger not to fire at them, there are a few hippos still alive in  the Congo. For, the only time the Captain and I were positive he  hit anything, was when he fired over our heads and blew off the roof  of the bridge.    When first we saw the two dead hippos, one of them was turning and  twisting so violently that we thought he was alive. But, as we drew  near, we saw the strange convulsions were due to two enormous and  ugly crocodiles, who were fiercely pulling at the body. Crocodiles  being man-eaters, we had no feelings about shooting them, either in  the water or up a tree; and I hope we hit them. In any event, after  we fired the body drifted on in peace.    On my return trip, going with the stream, when the boat covers about  four times the distance she makes when steaming against it, I saw  many hippos. In one day I counted sixty-nine. But on our way up the  Congo, until we turned into the Kasai River, we saw none.    So, on the first night we camped in the Kasai I had begun to think I  never would see one, and I went ashore both skeptical and  discouraged. We had stopped, not at a wood post, but at a place on  the river's bank previously untouched by man, where there was a  stretch of beach, and then a higher level with trees and tall  grasses. Driven deep in this beach were the footprints of a large  elephant. They looked as though some one had amused himself by  sinking a bucket in the mud, and then pulling it out. For sixty  yards I followed the holes and finally lost them in a confusion of  other tracks. The place had been so trampled upon that it was beaten  into a basin. It looked as though every animal in the Kasai had met  there to hold a dance. There were the deep imprints of the hippos  and the round foot of the elephant, with the marks of the big toes  showing as clearly as though they had been scooped out of the mud  with a trowel, the hoofs of buffalo as large as the shoe of a cart  horse, and the arrow-like marks of the antelope, some in dainty  little Vs, others measuring three inches across, and three inches  from the base to the point. They came from every direction, down the  bank and out of the river; and crossed and recrossed, and beneath  the fresh prints that had been made that morning at sunrise, were  those of days before rising up sharply out of the sun-dried clay,  like bas-reliefs in stucco. I had gone ashore in a state of mind so  skeptical that I was as surprised as Crusoe at the sight of  footprints. It was as though the boy who did not believe in fairies  suddenly stumbled upon them sliding down the moonbeams. One felt  distinctly apologetic--as though uninvited he had pushed himself  into a family gathering. At the same time there was the excitement  of meeting in their own homes the strange peoples I had seen only in  the springtime, when the circus comes to New York, in the basement  of Madison Square Garden, where they are our pitiful prisoners,  bruising their shoulders against bars. Here they were monarchs of  all they surveyed. I was the intruder; and, looking down at the  marks of the great paws and delicate hoofs, I felt as much out of  place as would a grizzly bear in a Fifth Avenue club. And I behaved  much as would the grizzly bear. I rushed back for my rifle intent on  killing something.    The sun had just set; the moon was shining faintly: it was the  moment the beasts of the jungle came to the river to drink. Anfossi,  although he had spent three years in the Congo and had three years'  contract still to work out, was as determined to kill something as  was the tenderfoot from New York.    Sixty yards from the stern of the _Deliverance_ was the basin I had  discovered; at an equal distance from her bow, a stream plunged into  the river. Anfossi argued the hippos would prefer to drink the clear  water of the stream, to the muddy water of the basin, and elected to  watch at the stream. I carried a deck chair to the edge of my basin  and placed it in the shadow of the trees. Anfossi went into our  cabin for his rifle. At that exact moment a hippopotamus climbed  leisurely out of the river and plunged into the stream. One of the  soldiers on shore saw him and rushed for the boat. Anfossi sent my  boy on the jump for me and, like a gentleman, waited until I had"]]]
