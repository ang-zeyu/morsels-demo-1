The pith is soft,  spongy and somewhat sappy. There is also sap between the bark and the  wood. An older twig has changed its color. There is a layer of brown bark,  which has replaced the colorless skin. In a twig a year old the wood is  thicker and the pith is dryer. Comparing sections of older branches with  these twigs, we find that the pith has shrunk and become quite dry, and  that the wood is in rings. It is not practicable for the pupils to  compare the number of these rings with the bud-rings, and so find out for  themselves that the age of the branch can be determined from the wood, for  in young stems the successive layers are not generally distinct. But, in  all the specimens, the sap is found just between the wood and the bark,  and here, where the supply of food is, is where the growth is taking  place. Each year new wood and new bark are formed in this _cambium-layer_,  as it is called, new wood on its inner, new bark on its outer face. Trees  which thus form a new ring of wood every year are called _exogenous_, or  outside-growing.    Ask the pupils to separate the bark into its three layers and to try  the strength of each. The two outer will easily break, but the inner is  generally tough and flexible. It is this inner bark, which makes the  Poplar and Willow branches so hard to break. These strong, woody fibres  of the inner bark give us many of our textile fabrics. Flax and Hemp come  from the inner bark of their respective plants (_Linum usitatissimum_ and  _Cannabis sativa_), and Russia matting is made from the bark of the Linden  (_Tilia Americana_).    We have found, in comparing the bark of specimens of branches of various  ages, that, in the youngest stems, the whole is covered with a skin, or  _epidermis_, which is soon replaced by a brown outer layer of bark, called  the _corky layer_; the latter gives the distinctive color to the tree.  While this grows, it increases by a living layer of cork-cambium on its  inner face, but it usually dies after a few years. In some trees it goes  on growing for many years. It forms the layers of bark in the Paper Birch  and the cork of commerce is taken from the Cork Oak of Spain. The green  bark is of cellular tissue, with some green coloring matter like that of  the leaves; it is at first the outer layer, but soon becomes covered with  cork. It does not usually grow after the first year. Scraping the bark of  an old tree, we find the bark homogeneous. The outer layers have perished  and been cast off. As the tree grows from within, the bark is stretched  and, if not replaced, cracks and falls away piecemeal. So, in most old  trees, the bark consists of successive layers of the inner woody bark.    Stems can be well studied from pieces of wood from the woodpile. The ends  of the log will show the concentric rings. These can be traced as long,  wavy lines in vertical sections of the log, especially if the surface is  smooth. If the pupils can whittle off different planes for themselves,  they will form a good idea of the formation of the wood. In many of  the specimens there will be knots, and the nature of these will be an  interesting subject for questions. If the knot is near the centre of the  log, lead back their thoughts to the time when the tree was as small as  the annular ring on which the centre of the knot lies. Draw a line on this  ring to represent the tree at this period of its growth. What could the  knot have been? It has concentric circles like the tree itself. It was a  branch which decayed, or was cut off. Year after year, new rings of wood  formed themselves round this broken branch, till it was covered from  sight, and every year left it more deeply buried in the trunk.    Extremely interesting material for the study of wood will be found in thin  sections prepared for veneers. Packages of such sections will be of great  use to the teacher.[1] They show well the reason of the formation of a  dividing line between the wood of successive seasons. In a cross section  of Oak or Chestnut the wood is first very open and porous and then close.  This is owing to the presence of ducts in the wood formed in the spring.  In other woods there are no ducts, or they are evenly distributed, but  the transition from the close autumn wood, consisting of smaller and  more closely packed cells, to the wood of looser texture, formed in the  following spring, makes a line that marks the season's growth.    [Footnote 1: Mr. Romeyn B. Hough, of Lowville, N.Y., will supply a package  of such sections for one dollar. The package will consist of several  different woods, in both cross and vertical section and will contain  enough duplicates for an ordinary class.    He also issues a series of books on woods illustrated by actual and neatly  mounted specimens, showing in each case three distinct views of the grain.  The work is issued in parts, each representing twenty-five species, and  selling with text at $5, expressage prepaid; the mounted specimens alone  at 25 cts. per species or twenty-five in neat box for $4. He has also  a line of specimens prepared for the stereopticon and another for the  microscope. They are very useful and sell at 50 cts. per species or  twenty-five for $10.]    Let each of the scholars take one of the sections of Oak and write a  description of its markings. The age is easily determined; the pith rays,  or _medullary rays_, are also plain. These form what is called the silver  grain of the wood. The ducts, also, are clear in the Oak and Chestnut.  There is a difference in color between the outer and inner wood, the older  wood becomes darker and is called the _heart-wood_, the outer is the  _sap-wood_. In Birds-eye Maple, and some other woods, the abortive buds  are seen. They are buried in the wood, and make the disturbance which  produces the ornamental grain. In sections of Pine or Spruce, no ducts  can be found. The wood consists entirely of elongated, thickened cells or  fibres. In some of the trees the pith rays cannot be seen with the naked  eye.    Let the pupils compare the branches which they have described, with a  stalk of Asparagus, Rattan, or Lily. A cross section of one of these shows  dots among the soft tissue. These are ends of the fibro-vascular bundles,  which in these plants are scattered through the cellular tissue instead of  being brought together in a cylinder outside of the pith. In a vertical  section they appear as lines. There are no annular rings.    If possible, let the pupils compare the leaves belonging to these  different types of stems. The parallel-veined leaves of monocotyledons  have stems without distinction of wood, bark and pith; the netted-veined  leaves of dicotyledons have exogenous stems.    Dicotyledons have bark, wood, and pith, and grow by producing a new ring  of wood outside the old. They also increase by the growth of the woody  bundles of the leaves, which mingle with those of the stem.[1] Twist off  the leaf-stalk of any leaf, and trace the bundles into the stem.    [Footnote 1: See note, p. 127, Physiological Botany.]    Monocotyledons have no layer which has the power of producing new wood,  and their growth takes place entirely from the intercalation of new  bundles, which originate at the bases of the leaves. The lower part of a  stem of a Palm, for instance, does not increase in size after it has lost  its crown of leaves. This is carried up gradually. The upper part of the  stem is a cone, having fronds, and below this cone the stem does not  increase in diameter. The word _endogenous_, inside-growing, is not,  therefore, a correct one to describe the growth of most monocotyledons,  for the growth takes place where the leaves originate, near the exterior  of the stem.    _Gray's First Lessons_.

We have studied leaves as cotyledons, bud-scales, etc., but when we speak  of _leaves_, we do not think of these adapted forms, but of the green  foliage of the plant.    1. _Forms and Structure_.--Provide the pupils with a number of green  leaves, illustrating simple and compound, pinnate and palmate, sessile and  petioled leaves. They must first decide the question, _What are the parts  of a leaf_? All the specimens have a green _blade_ which, in ordinary  speech, we call the leaf. Some have a stalk, or _petiole_, others are  joined directly to the stem. In some of them, as a rose-leaf, for  instance, there are two appendages at the base of the petiole, called  _stipules_. These three parts are all that any leaf has, and a leaf that  has them all is complete.    Let us examine the blade. Those leaves which have the blade in one  piece are called _simple_; those with the blade in separate pieces are  _compound_. We have already answered the question, _What constitutes a  single leaf_?[1] Let the pupils repeat the experiment of cutting off the  top of a seedling Pea, if it is not already clear in their minds, and find  buds in the leaf-axils of other plants.[2]    [Footnote 1: See page 31.]    [Footnote 2: With one class of children, I had much difficulty in making  them understand the difference between simple and compound leaves. I did  not tell them that the way to tell a single leaf was to look for buds in  the axils, but incautiously drew their attention to the stipules at the  base of a rose leaf as a means of knowing that the whole was one. Soon  after, they had a locust leaf to describe; and, immediately, with the  acuteness that children are apt to develop so inconveniently to their  teacher, they triumphantly refuted my statement that it was one leaf, by  pointing to the stiples. There was no getting over the difficulty; and  although I afterwards explained to them about the position of the buds,  and showed them examples, they clung "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10738"],[0,"Mahomet, Founder of Islam (#14)"],[1,"in 616; there is an allusion to the battle and the Greek  defeat in the Kuran, and a vague prophecy of their ultimate success, for  Mahomet was in sympathy with the Greek Empire, seeing that, from the  point of view of Arabia, it was the less formidable enemy.    But really the events of such outlying territories only troubled him in  regard to Medina, for his whole thoughts were centred now upon the chosen  city of his dreams. His followers became less aggressive in Mecca when  they knew that the Prophet had the nucleus of a new colony in another  city. Persecution within Mecca therefore died down considerably, and the  period is one of pause upon either side, the Kureisch watching to see  what the next move was to be, Mahomet carefully and secretly maturing his  plans.    During this year there fell a drought upon Mecca, followed by a famine,  which the devout attributed directly to divine anger at the rejection of  the Prophet's heavenly message, and which Mahomet interpreted as the  punishment of God, and this doubtless added to the sum of reasons which  impelled him to relinquish his native town.    From this time until the Hegira, or Flight from the City, events in the  world of action move but slowly for Mahomet. He was careful not to excite  undue suspicion among the Kureisch, and we can imagine him silent and  preoccupied, fulfilling his duties among them, visiting the Kaaba, and  mingling somewhat coldly with their daily life. Still keeping his purpose  immutable, he sought to strengthen the faith of his followers for the  trials he knew must come. The Kuran thus became more important as the  mouthpiece of his exhortations. The suras of this time resound with words  of encouragement and confidence. He is about to become the leader of a  perilous venture in honour of God. The reflex of the expectancy in the  hearts of the Muslim may be traced in his messages to them. Their whole  world, as it were, waited breathless, quiet, and tense for the record of  the year's achievements in Medina, and for the time appointed by God.  But how far their leader's actions were the result of painstaking  calculations, an insight into the qualities and energies of men, a  prevision startling in its range and accuracy, they never suspected; but,  serene in their confidence, they held their magnificent faith in the  divine guidance and in the inspiration of their Prophet.          CHAPTER VIII      THE FLIGHT TO MEDINA      \"Knowest thou not that the dominion of the Heavens and of the    Earth is God's? and that ye have neither patron nor helper save    God?\"--_The Kuran_.    The expectancy which burned like revivifying fire in the hearts of the  Meccan Muslim, kindled and nourished by their leader himself, was to  culminate at the time of the yearly pilgrimage in 622. In that month came  the great concourse of pilgrims from Yathreb to Mecca, among them seventy  of the \"Faithful\" who had received the faith at Medina, headed by their  teacher Musab and strengthened by the knowledge that they were before  long to stand face to face with their Prophet.    Musab had reported to Mahomet the success of his mission in the city, and  had prepared him for the advent of the little band of followers secured  for Islam. Secrecy was essential, for the Muslim from Medina were in  heart strangers among their own people, in such a precarious situation  that any treachery would have meant their utter annihilation, if not at  the hands of their countrymen, who would doubtless throw in their lot  with the stronger, certainly at the hands of the Kureisch, the implacable  foes of Islam, in whose territory they fearfully were. The rites of  pilgrimage were accordingly performed faithfully, though many breathed  more freely as they departed for the last ceremony at Mina. All was now  completed, and the Medinan party prepared to return, when Mahomet  summoned the Faithful by night to the old meeting-place in the gloomy  valley of Akaba.    About seventy men and two women of both Medinan tribes, the Beni Khazraj  and the Beni Aus, assembled thus in that barren place, under the  brilliant night skies of Arabia, to pledge themselves anew to an unseen,  untried God and to the service of his Prophet, who as yet counted but few  among his followers, and whose word carried no weight with the great ones  of their world.    To this meeting Mahomet brought Abbas, his uncle, younger son of  Abd-al-Muttalib, a weak and insignificant character, who had endeared  himself to Mahomet chiefly because of his doglike devotion. He was not a  convert, but he revered his energetic nephew too highly and was also too  greatly in awe of him to imagine such a thing as treachery. He was in  part a guarantee to the Khazraj of Mahomet's good faith, in part an asset  for him against the Kureisch, for his family were still influential in  Mecca.    The two made their way from the city unaccompanied, by steep and stony  ways, until they came to Akaba, and Mahomet saw awaiting him that  concourse summoned by his persistence and tireless faith--a concourse  part of himself, almost his own child, upon which all his hopes were now  set. Coming thus into that circle of faces, illumined dimly by the  torches, which prudence even now urged them to extinguish, he could not  but feel some foreshadowing of the mighty future that awaited this little  gathering, as yet impotent and tremulous, but bearing within itself the  seeds of that loyalty and courage that were to spread \"the Faith\" over  half the world.    When the greetings were over, Abbas stepped forward and spoke, while the  lines of dark faces closed around him in earnest scrutiny.    \"Ye men of the Beni Khazraj, this my kinsmen dwelleth amongst us in  honour and safety; his clan will defend him, but he preferreth to seek  protection from you. Wherefore, ye Khazraj, consider the matter well and  count the cost.\"    Then answered Bara, who stood for them in position of Chief:    \"We have listened to your words. Our resolution is unshaken. Our lives  are at the Prophet's service. It is now for him to speak.\"    Mahomet stepped forward into the circle of their glances, and with the  solemnity of the occasion urgent within him recited to them verses of the  Kuran, whose fire and eloquence kindled those passionate souls into an  enthusiasm glowing with a sombre resolve, and prompted them to stake all  upon their enterprise. At the end of those tumultuous words he assured  them that he would be content if they would pledge themselves to defend  him.    \"And if we die in thy defence, what reward have we?\"    \"Paradise!\" replied Mahomet, exalted, raising his hand in token of his  belief in Allah and the certitude of his cause.    Then arose a murmur deep and long, the protestation of loyalty that  threatened to rise into triumphant acclamation, but Abbas, the fearful of  the party, stayed them in dread of spies. So the tumult died down, and  Bara, taking upon himself the authority of his fellows, stretched forth  his hand to Mahomet, and with their clasping the Second Pledge of the  Akaba was sealed. They broke up swiftly, dreading to prolong their  meeting, for danger was all around them and the air heavy with suspected  treacheries.    And their apprehension was not groundless, for the Kureisch had heard of  their assembly through some secret messenger, though not until the  Medinan caravan with its concourse of the Faithful and the Unbelievers  was well on its homeward way across the dreary desert paths which lead to  Mecca from Medina. Their wrath was intense, and in fury they pursued it;  but either they were ignorant as to which road the party had taken, or  the Medinans eluded them by greater speed, for they returned disconsolate  from the pursuit, having only succeeded in finding two luckless men, one  of whom escaped, but the other, Sa'd ibn Obada, was dragged back to Mecca  and subjected to much brutality before he ultimately made his escape to  his native city.    The Kureisch were not content with attempting reprisals against Medina,  or possibly they were enraged because they had effected so little, for  they recommenced the persecution of Islam at Mecca with much violence.  From March until April they harassed the Believers in their city,  imposing restrictions upon them, and in many cases inflicting bodily harm  upon Mahomet's unfortunate and now defenceless followers. The renewed  persecution doubtless gave an added impetus to the Prophet's resolve to  quit Mecca.    Indeed, the time was fully ripe, and with the prescience that continually  characterised him in his role of leader of a religious state, he felt  that now the ground was prepared at Medina, emigration of the Muslim from  Mecca could not fail to be advantageous to him.    The command was given in April 622, and found immediate popularity,  except with a few malcontents who had large interests in their native  city. Then began the slow removal of a whole colony. The families of  Abu Talib's quarter of Mecca tranquilly forsook their birthplace in  orderly groups, taking with them their household treasures, until the  neighbourhood showed tenantless houses falling into the swift decay  accompanying neglect in such a climate, barricaded doors and gaping  windows, filled only with an immense feeling of desolation and the  blankness which overtakes a city when its humanity has deputed to another  abiding place. Weeds grew in the deserted streets, and over all lay a  fine film of dust, the almost impalpable effort of the desert to merge  once more into itself the territory wrung from it by human will.    The effect of this emigration upon the Kureisch can hardly be estimated.  They were amazed and helpless before it; for with their wrath hot against  Mahomet, it was as if their antagonist had melted into insubstantial  vapours to leave them enraged and breathless, pursuing a phantom  continually elusive. So silent was the emigration that they were only"]]]
