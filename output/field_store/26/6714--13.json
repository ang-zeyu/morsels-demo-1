[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14168"],[0,"Widdershins (#14)"],[1," Fate has no  morrow. Oleron's morrow must be to sit down to profitless, ill-done,  unrequired work again, and so on the morrow after that, and the morrow  after that, and as many morrows as there might be....    He lay there, weakly yet sanely considering it....    And since the whole attempt had failed, it was hardly worth while to  consider whether a little might not be saved from the general wreck. No  good would ever come of that half-finished novel. He had intended that it  should appear in the autumn; was under contract that it should appear; no  matter; it was better to pay forfeit to his publishers than to waste what  days were left. He was spent; age was not far off; and paths of wisdom  and sadness were the properest for the remainder of the journey....    If only he had chosen the wife, the child the faithful friend at the  fireside, and let them follow an _ignis fatuus_ that list!...    In the meantime it began to puzzle him exceedingly what he should be so  weak, that his room should smell so overpoweringly of decaying vegetable  matter, and that his hand, chancing to stray to his face in the darkness,  should encounter a beard.    \"Most extraordinary!\" he began to mutter to himself. \"Have I been ill? Am  I ill now? And if so, why have they left me alone?... Extraordinary!...\"    He thought he heard a sound from the kitchen or bathroom. He rose a  little on his pillow, and listened.... Ah! He was not alone, then! It  certainly would have been extraordinary if they had left him ill and  alone--Alone? Oh no. He would be looked after. He wouldn't be left, ill,  to shift for himself. If everybody else had forsaken him, he could trust  Elsie Bengough, the dearest chum he had, for that ... bless her faithful  heart!    But suddenly a short, stifled, spluttering cry rang sharply out:    \"_Paul!_\"    It came from the kitchen.    And in the same moment it flashed upon Oleron, he knew not how, that two,  three, five, he knew not how many minutes before, another sound, unmarked  at the time but suddenly transfixing his attention now, had striven to  reach his intelligence. This sound had been the slight touch of metal on  metal--just such a sound as Oleron made when he put his key into the  lock.    \"Hallo!... Who's that?\" he called sharply from his bed.    He had no answer.    He called again. \"Hallo!... Who's there?... Who is it?\"    This time he was sure he heard noises, soft and heavy, in the kitchen.    \"This is a queer thing altogether,\" he muttered. \"By Jove, I'm as weak as  a kitten too.... Hallo, there! Somebody called, didn't they?... Elsie! Is  that you?...\"    Then he began to knock with his hand on the wall at the side of his bed.    \"Elsie!... Elsie!... You called, didn't you?... Please come here, whoever  it is!...\"    There was a sound as of a closing door, and then silence. Oleron began to  get rather alarmed.    \"It may be a nurse,\" he muttered; \"Elsie'd have to get me a nurse, of  course. She'd sit with me as long as she could spare the time, brave  lass, and she'd get a nurse for the rest.... But it was awfully like her  voice.... Elsie, or whoever it is!... I can't make this out at all. I  must go and see what's the matter....\"    He put one leg out of bed. Feeling its feebleness, he reached with his  hand for the additional support of the wall....           *       *       *       *       *    But before putting out the other leg he stopped and considered, picking  at his new-found beard. He was suddenly wondering whether he _dared_ go  into the kitchen. It was such a frightfully long way; no man knew what  horror might not leap and huddle on his shoulders if he went so far;  when a man has an overmastering impulse to get back into bed he ought to  take heed of the warning and obey it. Besides, why should he go? What  was there to go for? If it was that Bengough creature again, let her look  after herself; Oleron was not going to have things cramp themselves on  his defenceless back for the sake of such a spoilsport as _she_!... If  she was in, let her let herself out again, and the sooner the better for  her! Oleron simply couldn't be bothered. He had his work to do. On the  morrow, he must set about the writing of a novel with a heroine so  winsome, capricious, adorable, jealous, wicked, beautiful, inflaming, and  altogether evil, that men should stand amazed. She was coming over him  now; he knew by the alteration of the very air of the room when she was  near him; and that soft thrill of bliss that had begun to stir in him  never came unless she was beckoning, beckoning....    He let go the wall and fell back into bed again as--oh, unthinkable!--the  other half of that kiss that a gnash had interrupted was placed (how else  convey it?) on his lips, robbing him of very breath....      XII    In the bright June sunlight a crowd filled the square, and looked up at  the windows of the old house with the antique insurance marks in its  walls of red brick and the agents' notice-boards hanging like wooden  choppers over the paling. Two constables stood at the broken gate of the  narrow entrance-alley, keeping folk back. The women kept to the outskirts  of the throng, moving now and then as if to see the drawn red blinds of  the old house from a new angle, and talking in whispers. The children  were in the houses, behind closed doors.    A long-nosed man had a little group about him, and he was telling some  story over and over again; and another man, little and fat and wide-eyed,  sought to capture the long-nosed man's audience with some relation in  which a key figured.    \"... and it was revealed to me that there'd been something that very  afternoon,\" the long-nosed man was saying. \"I was standing there, where  Constable Saunders is--or rather, I was passing about my business, when  they came out. There was no deceiving me, oh, no deceiving _me! I_ saw  her face....\"    \"What was it like, Mr. Barrett?\" a man asked.    \"It was like hers whom our Lord said to, 'Woman, doth any man accuse  thee?'--white as paper, and no mistake! Don't tell _me_!... And so I  walks straight across to Mrs. Barrett, and 'Jane,' I says, 'this must  stop, and stop at once; we are commanded to avoid evil,' I says, 'and it  must come to an end now; let him get help elsewhere.'    \"And she says to me, 'John,' she says, 'it's four-and-sixpence a  week'--them was her words.    \"'Jane,' I says, 'if it was forty-six thousand pounds it should  stop'... and from that day to this she hasn't set foot inside that gate.\"    There was a short silence: then,    \"Did Mrs. Barrett ever..._ see_ anythink, like?\" somebody vaguely  inquired.    Barrett turned austerely on the speaker.    \"What Mrs. Barrett saw and Mrs. Barrett didn't see shall not pass these  lips; even as it is written, keep thy tongue from speaking evil,\" he  said.    Another man spoke.    \"He was pretty near canned up in the _Waggon and Horses_ that night,  weren't he, Jim?\"    \"Yes, 'e 'adn't 'alf copped it....\"    \"Not standing treat much, neither; he was in the bar, all on his own....\"    \"So 'e was; we talked about it....\"    The fat, scared-eyed man made another attempt.    \"She got the key off of me--she 'ad the number of it--she come into my  shop of a Tuesday evening....\"    Nobody heeded him.    \"Shut your heads,\" a heavy labourer commented gruffly, \"she hasn't been  found yet. 'Ere's the inspectors; we shall know more in a bit.\"    Two inspectors had come up and were talking to the constables who guarded  the gate. The little fat man ran eagerly forward, saying that she had  bought the key of him. \"I remember the number, because of it's being  three one's and three three's--111333!\" he exclaimed excitedly.    An inspector put him aside.    \"Nobody's been in?\" he asked of one of the constables.    \"No, sir.\"    \"Then you, Brackley, come with us; you, Smith, keep the gate. There's a  squad on its way.\"    The two inspectors and the constable passed down the alley and entered  the house. They mounted the wide carved staircase.    \"This don't look as if he'd been out much lately,\" one of the inspectors  muttered as he kicked aside a litter of dead leaves and paper that lay  outside Oleron's door. \"I don't think we need knock--break a pane,  Brackley.\"    The door had two glazed panels; there was a sound of shattered glass; and  Brackley put his hand through the hole his elbow had made and drew back  the latch.    \"Faugh!\"... choked one of the inspectors as they entered. \"Let some light  and air in, quick. It stinks like a hearse--\"    The assembly out in the square saw the red blinds go up and the windows  of the old house flung open.    \"That's better,\" said one of the inspectors, putting his head out of a  window and drawing a deep breath.... \"That seems to be the bedroom in  there; will you go in, Simms, while I go over the rest?...\"    They had drawn up the bedroom blind also, and the waxy-white, emaciated  man on the bed had made a blinker of his hand against the torturing  flood of brightness. Nor could he believe that his hearing was not  playing tricks with him, for there were two policemen in his room,  bending over him and asking where \"she\" was. He shook his head.    \"This woman Bengough... goes by the name of Miss Elsie Bengough... d'ye  hear? Where is she?... No good, Brackley; get him up; be careful with  him; I'll just shove _my_ head out of the window, I think....\"    The other inspector had been through Oleron's study and had found  nothing, and was now in the kitchen, kicking aside an ankle-deep mass of  vegetable refuse that cumbered the floor. The kitchen window had no  blind, and was over-shadowed by the blank end of the house across the  alley. The kitchen appeared to be empty.    But the inspector, kicking aside the dead flowers, noticed that a  shuffling track that was not of his making had been swept to a cupboard  in the corner. In the upper part of the door of the cupboard was a square  panel that looked as if it slid on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14209"],[0,"The Kybalion (#14)"],[1," law  against another; one principle against others; and who accomplish their  results by changing the vibrations of material objects, or forms of  energy, and thus perform what are commonly called \"miracles.\"    As one of the old Hermetic writers has truly said: \"He who understands  the Principle of Vibration, has grasped the scepter of Power.\"        CHAPTER X    POLARITY        \"Everything is dual; everything has poles; everything      has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same;      opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree;      extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes      may be reconciled.\"--The Kybalion.    The great Fourth Hermetic Principle--the Principle of Polarity embodies  the truth that all manifested things have \"two sides\"; \"two aspects\";  \"two poles\"; a \"pair of opposites,\" with manifold degrees between the  two extremes. The old paradoxes, which have ever perplexed the mind of  men, are explained by an understanding of this Principle. Man has always  recognized something akin to this Principle, and has endeavored to  express it by such sayings, maxims and aphorisms as the following:  \"Everything is and isn't, at the same time\"; \"all truths are but  half-truths\"; \"every truth is half-false\"; \"there are two sides to  everything\"--\"there is a reverse side to every shield,\" etc., etc.    The Hermetic Teachings are to the effect that the difference between  things seemingly diametrically opposed to each other is merely a matter  of degree. It teaches that \"the pairs of opposites may be reconciled,\"  and that \"thesis and anti-thesis are identical in nature, but different  in degree\"; and that the \"universal reconciliation of opposites\" is  effected by a recognition of this Principle of Polarity. The teachers  claim that illustrations of this Principle may be had on every hand, and  from an examination into the real nature of anything. They begin by  showing that Spirit and Matter are but the two poles of the same thing,  the intermediate planes being merely degrees of vibration. They show  that THE ALL and The Many are the same, the difference being merely a  matter of degree of Mental Manifestation. Thus the LAW and Laws are the  two opposite poles of one thing. Likewise, PRINCIPLE and Principles.  Infinite Mind and finite minds.    Then passing on to the Physical Plane, they illustrate the Principle by  showing that Heat and Cold are identical in nature, the differences  being merely a matter of degrees. The thermometer shows many degrees of  temperature, the lowest pole being called \"cold,\" and the highest  \"heat.\" Between these two poles are many degrees of \"heat\" or \"cold,\"  call them either and you are equally correct. The higher of two degrees  is always \"warmer,\" while the lower is always \"colder.\" There is no  absolute standard-all is a matter of degree. There is no place on the  thermometer where heat ceases and cold begins. It is all a matter of  higher or lower vibrations. The very terms \"high\" and \"low,\" which we  are compelled to use, are but poles of the same thing-the terms are  relative. So with \"East and West\"--travel around the world in an  eastward direction, and you reach a point which is called west at your  starting point, and you return from that westward point. Travel far  enough North, and you will find yourself traveling South, or vice versa.    Light and Darkness are poles of the same thing, with many degrees  between them. The musical scale is the same--starting with \"C\" you move  upward until you reach another \"C\" and so on, the differences between  the two ends of the board being the same, with many degrees between the  two extremes. The scale of color is the same-higher and lower vibrations  being the only difference between high violet and low red. Large and  Small are relative. So are Noise and Quiet; Hard and Soft follow the  rule. Likewise Sharp and Dull. Positive and Negative are two poles of  the same thing, with countless degrees between them.    Good and Bad are not absolute--we call one end of the scale Good and the  other Bad, or one end Good and the other Evil, according to the use of  the terms. A thing is \"less good\" than the thing higher in the scale;  but that \"less good\" thing, in turn, is \"more good\" than the thing next  below it--and so on, the \"more or less\" being regulated by the position  on the scale.    And so it is on the Mental Plane. \"Love and. Hate\" are generally  regarded as being things diametrically opposed to each other; entirely  different; unreconcilable. But we apply the Principle of Polarity; we  find that there is no such thing as Absolute Love or Absolute Hate, as  distinguished from each other. The two are merely terms applied to the  two poles of the same thing. Beginning at any point of the scale we find  \"more love,\" or \"less hate,\" as we ascend the scale; and \"more hate\" or  \"less love\" as we descend this being true no matter from what point,  high or low, we may start. There are degrees of Love and Hate, and there  is a middle point where \"Like and Dislike\" become so faint that it is  difficult to distinguish between them. Courage and Fear come under the  same rule. The Pairs of Opposites exist everywhere. Where you find one  thing you find its opposite-the two poles.    And it is this fact that enables the Hermetist to transmute one mental  state into another, along the lines of Polarization. Things belonging to  different classes cannot be transmuted into each other, but things of  the same class may be changed, that is, may have their polarity changed.  Thus Love never becomes East or West, or Red or Violet-but it may and  often does turn into Hate and likewise Hate may be transformed into  Love, by changing its polarity. Courage may be transmuted into Fear, and  the reverse. Hard things may be rendered Soft. Dull things become Sharp.  Hot things become Cold. And so on, the transmutation always being  between things of the same kind of different degrees. Take the case of a  Fearful man. By raising his mental vibrations along the line of Fear-  Courage, he can be filled with the highest degree of Courage and  Fearlessness. And, likewise, the Slothful man may change himself into an  Active, Energetic individual simply by polarizing along the lines of the  desired quality.    The student who is familiar with the processes by which the various  schools of Mental Science, etc., produce changes in the mental states of  those following their teachings, may not readily understand the  principle underlying many of these changes. When, however, the Principle  of Polarity is once grasped, and it is seen that the mental changes are  occasioned by a change of polarity-a sliding along the same scale-the  hatter is readily understood. The change is not in the nature of a  transmutation of one thing into another thing entirely different-but is  merely a change of degree in the same things, a vastly important  difference. For instance, borrowing an analogy from the Physical Plane,  it is impossible to change Heat into Sharpness, Loudness, Highness,  etc., but Heat may readily be transmuted into Cold, simply by lowering  the vibrations. In the same way Hate and Love are mutually transmutable;  so are Fear and Courage. But Fear cannot be transformed into Love, nor  can Courage be transmuted into Hate. The mental states belong to  innumerable classes, each class of which has its opposite poles, along  which transmutation is possible.    The student will readily recognize that in the mental states, as well as  in the phenomena of the Physical Plane, the two poles may be classified  as Positive and Negative, respectively. Thus Love is Positive to Hate;  Courage to Fear; Activity to Non-Activity, etc., etc. And it will also  be noticed that even to those unfamiliar with the Principle of  Vibration, the Positive pole seems to be of a higher degree than the  Negative, and readily dominates it. The tendency of Nature is in the  direction of the dominant activity of the Positive pole.    In addition to the changing of the poles of one's own mental states by  the operation of the art of Polarization, the phenomena of Mental  Influence, in its manifold phases, shows us that the principle may be  extended so as to embrace the phenomena of the influence of one mind  over that of another, of which so much has been written and taught of  late years. When it is understood that Mental Induction is possible,  that is that mental states may be produced by \"induction\" from others,  then we can readily see how a certain rate of vibration, or polarization  of a certain mental state, may be communicated to another person, and  his polarity in that class of mental states thus changed. It is along  this principle that the results of many of the \"mental treatments\" are  obtained. For instance, a person is \"blue,\" melancholy and full of fear.  A mental scientist bringing his own mind up to the desired vibration by  his trained will, and thus obtaining the desired polarization in his own  case, then produces a similar mental state in the other by induction,  the result being that the vibrations are raised and the person polarizes  toward the Positive end of the scale instead toward the Negative, and  his Fear and other negative emotions are transmuted to Courage and  similar positive mental states. A little study will show you that these  mental changes are nearly all along the line of Polarization, the change  being one of degree rather than of kind.    A knowledge of the existence of this great Hermetic Principle will  enable the student to better understand his own mental states, and those  of other people. He will see that these states are all matters of  degree, and seeing thus, he will be able to raise or lower the vibration  at will--to change his mental poles, and thus be Master of his mental  states, instead of being their servant and slave. And by his knowledge  he will be able to aid his fellows"]]]
