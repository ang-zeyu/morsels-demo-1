He showed teeth white  as a child's, and had dimples--actually dimples--in his big cheeks, to  say nothing of the one in his chin, with which snapshots had  familiarized me. He looked like a huge, overgrown schoolboy with a  corked moustache. My glare faded in the light of his smile. No man with  a gleam of humour could have kept a mask of grimness. I found my hand  enveloped in the pound of steak, and warmly shaken up and down inside  it.    \"Lord Ernest Borrow, I'm delighted to see you. Very good of you to  come, I'm sure!\" to David quoth Goliath, in a big voice, mellow despite  a slight Cockney accent. \"Nice view I've treated myself to here, what?  I'm in Egypt on business, but I like to have pretty things around me  --pleasant colours and flowers and a view. That's a specialty of mine.  I'm great on specializing. And that brings me to what we have in  common; a scheme of yours; a scheme of mine.\"    I wanted to detest the man, but somehow couldn't. To hate him would be  hating an overpowering force, like heat, or electricity.    With an old-fashioned politeness he made me sit down, picking out my  chair, the most comfortable in the room, then taking the next best for  himself. He fitted into it as tightly as a ripe plum into its skin, and  talked with one leg crossed over the other and swinging, the points of  his brown fingers joined. I was glad they were brown.    \"I'm afraid you're sore with me,\" he began, having ordered coffee and  liqueurs, and forced upon his guest a cigar as big as a sausage. \"I've  got what you and your friend wanted; and I'm going to be frank with you  as I've been with him, and admit that I got it because you did want it.  Simply and solely for that reason and nothing else. He told you this?\"    \"He left the telling to you,\" I said, wondering why I wasn't more  furious than curious. But it was the other way round.    \"Good egg! He promised he would, and he looks the sort of chap to keep  his promise. Well, I see you want me to get down to business, and I  will. I'm going to lay all my cards on the table. I came here to Egypt  for the first time in my life, to see a scheme through, and I landed on  the scene in time to find that I was likely to fail. I haven't told any  one else that, but your friend Fenton; for I never have made a business  failure yet, and I don't mean to now if I can help it. The scheme had  to be saved in a hurry if it could be saved at all; and when I set my  wits to work I saw that I must get hold of some such young men as you  and Captain Fenton to help me. I don't know how the thought of you two  popped into my head, but I suppose it was seeing a lot of stuff about  Fenton in the papers, his Balkan adventure, and the announcement that  he'd been recalled to his regiment. There were paragraphs about him as  a linguist, and an Egyptologist, and anecdotes of him as a smart  soldier. You know the sort of thing. And the stories about his  parentage caught my fancy a bit. They're romantic. I've got enough  romance in me to see that side of life, and to know how it goes down  with the women. This scheme of mine depends on women. Most schemes do.  At the same time the Egyptian papers were printing paragraphs about  Lord Ernest Borrow. I don't know whether you're aware of that or not?  No? Would you like to see 'em? I've had my secretary cut 'em out--and  the Fenton stuff, too. The minute this idea began to wiggle in my mind  like a tadpole in water, I kept everything.\"    \"Don't trouble about the paragraphs, thanks,\" I said.    \"All right. It will save our time not to. But your wish to go in with  your friend, for the rights of excavating in the Sudan, was mentioned,  and the delay on account of alleged interference with Garstang's  pitch.\"    \"By Jove, I wonder how the reporters got onto that?\" I couldn't help  exclaiming.    \"It's their livelihood to get onto everything. 'Well then,' I said to  myself, 'Here's my chance, my only one. I want those two young men.  They're the right combination nation for me, to give real distinction  to my undertaking. I have money, but they ain't the sort you can buy  with money. There must be an incentive. If I get what they want,  perhaps I can get _them_.' So I went into the job tooth and nail.  Neither you nor Fenton was on the spot. I was--very much on it. Nothing  was definitely fixed up between the Government and Fenton for the right  to excavate at the Mountain of the Golden Pyramid, as they call the  little old molehill, and I scored. Now, if you two will do what I want,  you can have your mountain, and whatever you find you can keep. You're  worth more to me than any beads and broken-nosed statues under the sand  of Egypt. I think I've made some impression on your friend. He may be  inclined to go in with me, if you will. He's explained that in any case  he can't use his own name, on account of his position in the army and  so on. That's a disappointment to me, but I'll put up with it for the  sake of his accomplishments and his looks. Your name alone will carry  the necessary weight as a leader.\"    \"You're very flattering,\" said I. \"But I'm in the dark.\"    \"I'm going to put you wise, as Americans say. My scheme was--and is--to  be a rival _de luxe_ of Cook on the Nile. Not only that, but all over  the near East. You've heard, of course, about my buying the Marquis of  Redruth's yacht _Candace,_ on his bankruptcy--the second biggest, and  the most up-to-date yacht in the world--and turning her into a pleasure  cruiser for the Mediterranean?\"    \"If I've heard, I'm afraid my memory's treacherous,\" said I, glad to  show how unimportant to me were the schemes of financiers, but  interested in the yacht's name, which carried my thoughts away to  Meroee.    \"Great Scout! And I've spent two thousand in advertising! I've taken  whole pages of London and Continental papers!\"    \"I never read advertisements if I can help it, except of new patents in  razors. They're a fad of mine.\"    \"Thank goodness you've got fads. Then we've something in common. I make  money out of my fads. I call 'em inspirations. I thought the _Candace_  business was one of my inspirations, and that I'd have some fun out of  it. I advertised her to start on her first pleasure cruise from  Marseilles to Gib, Algiers, Tangier, Tunis, Greece, Alexandria, and  Jaffa. 'That'll be a smack in the eye for the big liners,' I said to  myself. 'I'll skim the top layer of clotted cream off their passenger  lists!' I was going to do the thing _de luxe_ straight through--bid for  the swell set, exclusiveness my motto. Of course I didn't expect to hit  the dukes and dollar kings first shot, but I thought if everything went  right the passengers would tell their friends at home how much better  we did them on board than any one else had ever done, and we'd get a  'snowball' ad, that nothing could stop. All would have worked out first  rate, if I hadn't made one mistake. I engaged a retired army colonel  for a conductor on board my yacht. I got the man cheap. But I was a  fool to economize on him. I ought to have launched out on a belted  earl. Folks, especially Americans, don't like retired colonels. The  woods are full of 'em over there, crawling with 'em. Most Americans are  colonels and not retired. Besides, this chap of mine's no good anyhow  --fancies himself as a politician, and is a first-class snob; has no  tact; rubs up the passengers the wrong way, and outrages their  feelings. We got a lot of people from the north of England, rich and a  bit crude, like me. Will you believe it, Colonel Corkran began his job  by sneering audibly at 'provincials' to some beastly friend of his,  come to see him off at Marseilles? Instead of making his dinner-table  lectures a kind of travellogue as he was hired to do, he turns 'em into  political tirades, and calls the Liberals scoundrels, half of our folks  being red-hot Rads. Not only that, if the girls and boys talk while the  band's playin' any of his favourite airs, he hisses out 'Silence,'  through a hole in his mouth where one tooth's missin'. That tooth bein'  gone, has got on the girls' nerves worse than anything else, it would  seem, except his being down on Suffragettes. And the crisis was reached  when he insulted Miss Hassett Bean, the richest and most important  woman in the bunch, when she expressed her political opinions. Said to  her, 'My dear lady, why do you bother to have opinions? They give you a  lot of trouble to collect, and nobody else will trouble to listen. Why  not collect insects or stamps instead?' Of course she did think Germany  had already invaded England with a large army of soldiers disguised as  hotel waiters, which was calculated to rile an old officer; but that's  no excuse for a man who's paid to please. And now the fellow's  wondering why he's not popular with the passengers!\"    I laughed, but Sir Walter had worked himself into a state past smiling  point. \"It's no laughing matter,\" he said, \"This snob Corkran's killing  my scheme. There's a plot on foot for the party to walk off the yacht  at Alexandria, and demand half their passage money. Some old grampus on  board has started the story that the _Candace_ has been down three  times------\"    \"A lie, of course,\" I soothed him.    \"A dastardly lie. She's been down only twice. The first time was a  collision, the second a coincidence.\"    \"But I thought she was the most up-to-date yacht in the world!\"    \"So she is, as the _Candace._ That was the Marquis's name for her: gave  it after a trip to Egypt. He bought her second hand, and rechristened  her while she was being redecorated. He spared no expense, which he  could well afford, seeing that he never paid a penny. I got her at cost  price, as you may say. But these plotters are going to claim that they  were inveigled on board under false pretences, by my advertising the  _Candace_ as the newest thing in yachts.

Already a bewildering sequence to look back upon; but it is in the  nature of a retrospect to reverse the order of things, and it was the new  risk run by Raffles that now loomed largest in my mind, and Levy's last  word of warning to him that rang the loudest in my ears. The apparently  complete ruin of the Garlands was still a profound mystery to me. But no  mere mystery can hold the mind against impending peril; and I was less  exercised to account for the downfall of these poor people than in  wondering whether it would be followed by that of their friend and mine.  Had his Carlsbad crime really found him out? Had Levy only refrained from  downright denunciation of Raffles in order to denounce him more  effectually to the police? These were the doubts that dogged me at my  dinner, and on through the evening until Raffles himself appeared in my  corner of the smoking-room, with as brisk a step and as buoyant a  countenance as though the whole world and he were one.    \"My dear Bunny! I've never given the matter another thought,\" said he in  answer to my nervous queries, \"and why the deuce should Dan Levy? He has  scored us off quite handsomely as it is; he's not such a fool as to put  himself in the wrong by stating what he couldn't possibly prove. They  wouldn't listen to him at Scotland Yard; it's not their job, in the  first place. And even if it were, no one knows better than our Mr.  Shylock that he hasn't a shred of evidence against me.\"    \"Still,\" said I, \"he happens to have hit upon the truth, and that's half  the battle in a criminal charge.\"    \"Then it's a battle I should love to fight, if the odds weren't all on  Number One! What happens, after all? He recovers his property--he's not a  pin the worse off--but because he has a row with me about something else  he thinks he can identify me with the Teutonic thief! But not in his  heart, Bunny; he's not such a fool as that. Dan Levy's no fool at all,  but the most magnificent knave I've been up against yet. If you want to  hear all about his tactics, come round to the Albany and I'll open your  eyes for you.\"    His own were radiant with light and life, though he could not have closed  them since his arrival at Charing Cross the night before. But midnight  was his hour. Raffles was at his best when the stars of the firmament are  at theirs; not at Lord's in the light of day, but at dead of night in the  historic chambers to which we now repaired. Certainly he had a congenial  subject in the celebrated Daniel, \"a villain after my own black heart,  Bunny! A foeman worthy of Excalibur itself.\"    And how he longed for the fierce joy of further combat for a bigger  stake! But the stake was big enough for even Raffles to shake a hopeless  head over it. And his face grew grave as he passed from the fascinating  prowess of his enemy to the pitiful position of his friends.    \"They said I might tell you, Bunny, but the figures must keep until I  have them in black and white. I've promised to see if there really isn't  a forlorn hope of getting these poor Garlands out of the spider's web.  But there isn't, Bunny, I don't mind telling you.\"    \"What I can't understand,\" said I, \"is how father and son seem to have  walked into the same parlour--and the father a business man!\"    \"Just what he never was,\" replied Raffles; \"that's at the bottom of the  whole thing. He was born into a big business, but he wasn't born a  business man. So his partners were jolly glad to buy him out some years  ago; and then it was that poor old Garland lashed out into the place  where you spent the day, Bunny. It has been his ruin. The price was  pretty stiff to start with; you might have a house in most squares and  quite a good place in the country for what you've got to pay for a cross  between the two. But the mixture was exactly what attracted these good  people; for it was not only in Mrs. Garland's time, but it seems she was  the first to set her heart upon the place. So she was the first to leave  it for a better world--poor soul--before the glass was on the last  vinery. And the poor old boy was left to pay the shot alone.\"    \"I wonder he didn't get rid of the whole show,\" said I, \"after that.\"    \"I've no doubt he felt like it, Bunny, but you don't get rid of a place  like that in five minutes; it's neither fish nor flesh; the ordinary  house-hunter, with the money to spend, wants to be nearer in or further  out. On the other hand there was a good reason for holding on. That part  of Kensington is being gradually rebuilt; old Garland had bought the  freehold, and sooner or later it was safe to sell at a handsome profit  for building sites. That was the one excuse for his dip; it was really a  fine investment, or would have been if he had left more margin for upkeep  and living expenses. As it was he soon found himself a bit of a beggar on  horseback. And instead of selling his horse at a sacrifice, he put him at  a fence that's brought down many a better rider.\"    \"What was that?\"    \"South Africans!\" replied Raffles succinctly. \"Piles were changing hands  over them at the time, and poor old Garland began with a lucky dip  himself; that finished him off. There's no tiger like an old tiger that  never tasted blood before. Our respected brewer became a reckless  gambler, lashed at everything, and in due course omitted to cover his  losses. They were big enough to ruin him, without being enormous.  Thousands were wanted at almost a moment's notice; no time to fix up an  honest mortgage; it was a case of pay, fail, or borrow through the nose!  And old Garland took ten thousand of the best from Dan Levy--and had  another dip!\"    \"And lost again?\"    \"And lost again, and borrowed again, this time on the security of his  house; and the long and short of it is that he and every stick, brick and  branch he is supposed to possess have been in Dan Levy's hands for months  and years.\"    \"On a sort of mortgage?\"    \"On a perfectly nice and normal mortgage so far as interest went, only  with a power to call in the money after six months. But old Garland is  being bled to the heart for iniquitous interest on the first ten  thousand, and of course he can't meet the call for another fifteen when  it comes; but he thinks it's all right because Levy doesn't press for the  dibs. Of course it's all wrong from that moment. Levy has the right to  take possession whenever he jolly well likes; but it doesn't suit him to  have the place empty on his hands, it might depreciate a rising property,  and so poor old Garland is deliberately lulled into a false sense of  security. And there's no saying how long that state of things might have  lasted if we hadn't taken a rise out of old Shylock this morning.\"    \"Then it's our fault, A.J.?\"    \"It's mine,\" said Raffles remorsefully. \"The idea, I believe, was  altogether mine, Bunny; that's why I'd give my bowing hand to take the  old ruffian at his word, and save the governor as we did the boy!\"    \"But how _do_ you account for his getting them both into his toils?\" I  asked. \"What was the point of lending heavily to the son when the father  already owed more than he could pay?\"    \"There are so many points,\" said Raffles. \"They love you to owe more than  you can pay; it's not their principal that they care about nearly so much  as your interest; what they hate is to lose you when once they've got  you. In this case Levy would see how frightfully keen poor old Garland  was about his boy--to do him properly and, above all, not to let him see  what an effort it's become. Levy would find out something about the boy;  that he's getting hard up himself, that he's bound to discover the old  man's secret, and capable of making trouble and spoiling things when he  does. 'Better give him the same sort of secret of his own to keep,' says  Levy, 'then they'll both hold their tongues, and I'll have one of 'em  under each thumb till all's blue.' So he goes for Teddy till he gets him,  and finances father and son in watertight compartments until this libel  case comes along and does make things look a bit blue for once. Not blue  enough, mind you, to compel the sale of a big rising property at a  sacrifice; but the sort of thing to make a man squeeze his small  creditors all round, while still nursing his top class. So you see how it  all fits in. They say the old blackguard is briefing Mr. Attorney  himself; that along with all the rest to scale, will run him into  thousands even if he wins his case.\"    \"May he lose it!\" said I, drinking devoutly, while Raffles lit the  inevitable Egyptian. I gathered that this plausible exposition of Mr.  Levy's tactics had some foundation in the disclosures of his hapless  friends; but his ready grasp of an alien subject was highly  characteristic of Raffles. I said I supposed Miss Belsize had not  remained to hear the whole humiliating story, but Raffles replied briefly  that she had. By putting the words into his mouth, I now learnt that she  had taken the whole trouble as finely as I should somehow have expected  from those fearless eyes of hers; that Teddy had offered to release her  on the spot, and that Camilla Belsize had refused to be released; but  when I applauded her spirit, Raffles was ostentatiously irresponsive.  Nothing, indeed, could have been more marked than the contrast between  his reluctance to discuss Miss Belsize and the captious gusto with which  she had discussed him. But in each case the inference was that there was  no love lost between the pair; and in each case I could"]]]
