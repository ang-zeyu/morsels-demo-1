Un matin, un cuirassier, qui avait frequemment entendu prononcer  le nom de Vernet, mais qui ne se rendait pas bien compte de la  position du celebre peintre, alla le trouver dans son atelier.  Le brave garcon desirait avoir son portrait pour l'envoyer au  pays. Il s'en ouvrit a l'artiste, mais il ajouta qu'il voulait  avant tout etre fixe sur le prix que cela lui couterait.    \"Combien veux-tu y mettre? demanda Horace.--J'irai bien jusqu'a  trente sous, repondit le cuirassier.--Bon! cela me va.\"    En quelques coups de crayon, Vernet eut bien vite termine une  charmante esquisse du guerrier, que celui-ci emporta triomphant.  Le beau militaire ne put cependant s'empecher de dire a un camarade  qui l'attendait a la porte: \"J'ai eu tort de ne pas marchander:  j'aurais peut-etre eu mon portrait pour vingt sous.\"    La naivete du cuirassier est d'autant plus amusante que le moindre  dessin de Vernet se payait deja fort cher quand ce peintre celebre  vivait.

LE PEINTRE DAVID ET LE COCHER    David, celebre peintre francais sous l'Empire, a excelle par  la purete classique de son dessin. On conte sur lui, pourtant,  une anecdote qui porte a croire que les artistes memes sont  faillibles.    Cet homme illustre avait expose un de ses plus beaux tableaux et  se trouvait par hasard confondu dans la foule qui l'admirait. Il  remarqua un homme dont le costume annoncait un cocher de fiacre,  et dont l'attitude indiquait le dedain. \"Je vois que vous n'aimez  point ce tableau, lui dit le peintre.--Ma foi, non!--C'est pourtant  un de ceux devant lesquels tout le monde s'arrete.--Il n'y a  pas de quoi. Voyez cet imbecile de peintre qui a fait un cheval  dont la bouche est toute couverte d'ecume et qui, pourtant, n'a  pas de mors.\" David se tut; mais des que le salon fut ferme,  il effaca l'ecume.

L'HOMME DUPE DE SA CREDULITE    Un bourgeois de Lyon, fort riche, ayant fait tirer son horoscope,  mangea, pendant le temps qu'il croyait avoir a vivre, tout ce  qu'il avait. Mais ayant ete plus loin que l'astrologue ne l'avait  predit, il n'avait plus de quoi se nourrir. Il se vit oblige de  demander l'aumone, et il disait en tendant la main: \"Assistez  un homme qui a ete dupe de sa credulite.\"      Est-ce qu'on croit encore de nos jours aux horoscopes?--Quelle  destinee avait-on predite au bourgeois?--Comment a-t-il voulu  en tirer profit?--L'horoscope a-t-il dit vrai?--Qu'est-ce que  le pauvre bourgeois a du faire pour se nourrir?--Quelle est la  moralite du recit?      94.

Edison, le grand inventeur americain, a recu un  jour une lettre que lui ecrivait une demoiselle et dans laquelle  elle lui demandait s'il ne pourrait pas inventer une machine au  moyen de laquelle elle pourrait voir son futur mari. Il aurait pu  repondre, comme le Pape au cardinal peint en enfer: \"Mon pouvoir  ne s'etend pas si loin.\"      Les grands personnages recoivent-ils beaucoup de lettres?--A  quel titre M.

He said,\" in a tone in which  triumph was plainly noticeable, \"that he didn't know _when_ he'd seen a  dog with legs an' a chest like Baldy.\"    \"I know a good dog is about the best introduction you can have to Mr.  Fink; but if for any reason that fails, I'll have a talk with Mr. Daly  and tell him that you want to be another Lincoln, as nearly as possible,  and that will appeal to him,\" confidently remarked the Woman.    \"You got the right system in this here case,\" chuckled Moose Jones. \"Ef  you was t' tell one o' them lawyers that you jest couldn't git the other  one interested in the boy, it's a dead cinch he'd git inter one office  or t'other; an' it don't make much difference which. They're both mighty  smart men, even ef they don't go at things the same way. Well, anyway,  Ben, I'm glad I kin depend on retainin' you when my claims begin t' show  up rich, as I kinda think some of 'em's bound t' do, one place or  another. On my way back t' Nome, I stopped at them new diggin's at Dime  Creek, an' staked some ground; an' it's a likely lookin' country, I kin  tell you.\"    From the first instant he had heard the sound of the man's voice, Baldy  had remained motionless, but intent, trying to recall their past  association; then with a bark he rushed up to Moose Jones, showing every  possible sign of recognition and joy.    \"Well, well,\" exclaimed Moose, \"ef this ain't Baldy o' Golconda! Why, I  didn't know him right away, he's so sorta perky an' high-toned; all  along of gettin' in with a speedy bunch, I expect,\" and the man stroked  the dog affectionately.    \"Isn't he fine?\" cried Ben eagerly. \"I just wish you could 'a' seen him  the day o' the race; but George'll tell you all about it--how he  wouldn't let Spot an' Queen bolt, an' how willin' he was an' all.\"    \"Yes, indeed, the boys must tell you all about that famous event, Mr.  Jones, while I talk to Mrs. Edwards about something else.\"    Before going into the details of the race, which never palled upon Ben,  they described with much gusto the defeat of Oolik Lomen in the first  Great Adventure the Wonder Workers had undertaken; and Ben bitterly  regretted that he could not also have been one of the brave knights who  had so valorously risen in defense of the weak and distressed against  the strong and unprincipled.    But Dan consoled him somewhat by the information that the incident had  been almost spoiled by interference; and that the next time they  performed deeds of chivalry he hoped it would be when no female was  about, unless, indeed, it might be a victim to be rescued from a  terrible plight.    In the brief chat the Woman had with Mrs. Edwards she learned a little  of the hardships that had fallen to the lot of the boy and his mother,  and realized in spite of their courage and reticence that they had  endured a hard struggle for almost a mere existence.    \"Don't you think it would be easier for you outside, where there are not  so many physical discomforts to be considered?\"    \"Perhaps. But my husband left a little mining ground that may, in time,  prove worth while if developed; and I have remained where I could look  after it, and see that the assessment work was properly done. As it is,  a man named Barclay--Black Mart Barclay, they call him--jumped the claim  next to his, and if it had not been for Mr. Jones I should have lost it.  He loaned me the money to take the matter into the courts, where I won  out.\"    \"And the boy?\"    \"He is my one thought,\" responded Mrs. Edwards. \"As a young child he was  rather delicate, and we could not send him to school because of the  distance. Since then his association with the men at Golconda has done  much to offset what I have tried to do for him. Before my marriage I  taught school in a village in New Hampshire, though you would hardly  suspect it to hear Ben speak. I wanted to get a position in the school  here; but nowadays there is so much special training required that I  found I was not fitted for the work; and I have just had to take what I  could get from time to time. At any rate,\" with a cheerful smile, \"we  are still alive and have kept our property.\"    \"It was brave,\" murmured the Woman, whose eyes were misty; \"very brave.\"    \"Now that Ben is going to school regularly,\" the other continued, \"he  will, I think, soon lose this roughness of speech; and you can see that  he is anxious to learn, and is ambitious.\"    \"Yes, indeed; I have found him really unusual.\"    \"Mr. Jones told us this morning that if his mining ventures turn out  well, and they certainly look as if they might, that he will send Ben to  college. He was my husband's partner at one time, and has always taken a  great interest in the boy.\"    \"I am so glad,\" was the response. \"I have felt all along that some way  should be found to make such a thing possible. The child deserves it.  Some day soon, if you will let me come again, we will make some  wonderful plans for his future. But I came to-day to ask you if you will  let Ben go on a trip to the Hot Springs with us next week? I am sure it  would do him a lot of good to be in the open air, and perhaps he would  enjoy the outing.\"    \"I should be glad to have him go; as to his enjoyment--just see what he  says.\"    Ben listened breathlessly while the Woman told of the prospective  outing. \"I am to go with 'Scotty' and nine or ten of the racing dogs,  and Pete Bernard, with twelve big huskies, is to take my husband. As  Pete will have a sled load of freight for Shelton and the Springs, we  thought you had better go with 'Scotty' and me; that is, of course, if  you would like to make the trip. I believe that 'Scotty' intends driving  Baldy, if that is any inducement.\"    Ben could hardly reply for excitement and happiness.    \"Well then,\" and the Woman rose, \"it is quite decided that you are to  go. I dare say George and Dan--and Baldy--will want to remain a while.  We have talked so much and so fast that I had really forgotten the  'party' we came to give you, and it is time for me to leave if I keep  another engagement. If you are able to get out to-morrow, Ben, bring  your mother and Mr. Jones over to the Kennel, and we will introduce them  to some of our distinguished dog friends.\"    Mrs. Edwards and Moose Jones followed her to the door. The former, with  a warm hand-clasp, faltered a few words of thanks; and Moose, with some  embarrassment, said in an undertone, \"I'm much obliged, ma'am, fer what  you and 'Scotty''s done fer the kid an' the dog. Ben used t' come t' my  cabin when I was kinda lonely an' discouraged at Golconda; an' havin'  him 'round learnt me that you got t' have some one that you love, t'  work fer, if you want t' git the best out o' things an' people. Now Mrs.  Edwards says I kin give Ben his eddication, which'll pay back somethin'  o' what his father done fer me once when I was considerable down on my  luck. And,\" with enthusiasm, \"believe me, you kin bet it'll be some  eddication, ef I have my way, an' them claims pan out the way they look  now.\"    So potent a cure was the delight of the coming excursion that Ben was  over not only the next day with Moose Jones, but every day after, until  the time for the departure arrived; for there were many interesting  matters to be settled. The most absorbing was, naturally, the selection  of dogs for the journey; and there were long discussions by all  concerned before the team was finally chosen.    The Woman's suggestions were, as usual, well meant; but were almost  invariably influenced by personal preferences rather than sound  judgment. And \"Scotty\" had to firmly repress her desire to thrust the  greatness of a Trail Career upon some of those for whom he had other  achievements in mind.    [Illustration: \"SHE HAD BEEN A MEMBER OF ONE OF  THE MAIL TEAMS\"    Eric Johnson, U. S. Mail Carrier on the Nome-Unalakleet Route]    \"I do wish you would take Mego,\" she urged. \"The dear old thing simply  loves sled work, and you never give her anything to do nowadays but  bring up families.\"    \"And why not?\" demanded \"Scotty.\" \"There is not another dog-mother in  all Nome who can so intelligently care for a family.\" Which was true;  for added to her natural fondness for those dependent upon her, she had  wide experience in the ways of dogs and people, and was thoroughly  familiar with the dangers that beset the path of puppy-hood.    When young she had been a member of one of the Mail Teams and had worked  hard for her living. The run of over two hundred and thirty miles  between Nome and Unalakleet was covered many times during the winter;  and the Mail Carrier, who has the chance to observe carefully the  individual behavior of the dogs he uses, was much attracted to Mego. Her  patient industry was a happy contrast to the actions of some of the  others, who were unruly and quarrelsome, or disinclined to do their  share of the necessary labor; and it was with such a high  recommendation that \"Scotty\" had bought her.    \"If she only had to care for her own puppies it would not be so bad,\"  the Woman complained; \"but every once in a while some light-minded  gad-about roams around at will, or runs away, and leaves her offspring  for Mego to raise. Why, sometimes you would think she was the matron of  a Puppies' Day Home.\"    To her credit it may be said that whether the puppies were hers or  another's, Mego was untiring in her gentle supervision of their minds  and manners. She taught them to be respectful and wag their tails  prettily when addressed; not to jump and place muddy paws on those who  came to see them, and not to wander away alone, nor associate with  strangers. And the task was often difficult, for there were many  alluring temptations and many bad examples.    \"But she positively enjoys it,\" insisted \"Scotty.\" \"When her own little  ones outgrow her care, she is always watching for a chance to annex at  least one member of any new litter in her"]]]
