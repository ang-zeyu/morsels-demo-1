Limitation is certainly produced by society and the State, but it is a  limitation of the mere brute emotions and rude instincts, as also, in a  more advanced stage of culture, of the premeditated self-will of caprice  and passion. This kind of constraint is part of the instrumentality by  which only the consciousness of freedom and the desire for its  attainment, in its true--that is, its rational and ideal form--can be  obtained. To the ideal of freedom, law and morality are indispensably  requisite; and they are, in and for themselves, universal existences,  objects, and aims, which are discovered only by the activity of thought,  separating itself from the merely sensuous and developing itself in  opposition thereto, and which must, on the other hand, be introduced  into and incorporated with the originally sensuous will, and that  contrarily to its natural inclination. The perpetually recurring  misapprehension of freedom consists in regarding that term only in its  formal, subjective sense, abstracted from its essential objects and  aims; thus a constraint put upon impulse, desire, passion--pertaining to  the particular individual as such--a limitation of caprice and  self-will is regarded as a fettering of freedom. We should, on the  contrary, look upon such limitation as the indispensable proviso of  emancipation. Society and the State are the very conditions in which  freedom is realized.    We must notice a second view, contravening the principle of the  development of moral relations into a legal form. The patriarchal  condition is regarded, either in reference to the entire race of man or  to some branches of it, as exclusively that condition of things in which  the legal element is combined with a due recognition of the moral and  emotional parts of our nature, and in which justice, as united with  these, truly influences the intercourse of the social units. The basis  of the patriarchal condition is the family relation, which develops the  primary form of conscious morality, succeeded by that of the State as  its second phase. The patriarchal condition is one of transition, in  which the family has already advanced to the position of a race of  people, where the union, therefore, has already ceased to be simply a  bond of love and confidence and has become one of plighted service.    We must first examine the ethical principle of the Family, which may be  reckoned as virtually a single person, since its members have either  mutually surrendered their individual personality and consequently their  legal position toward one another, with the rest of their particular  interests and desires, as in the case of the parents, or, in the care of  children who are primarily in that merely natural condition already  mentioned, have not yet attained such an independent personality. They  live, therefore, in a unity of feeling, love, confidence, and faith in  one another, and, in a relation of mutual love, the one individual has  the consciousness of himself in the consciousness of another; he lives  out of self; and in this mutual self-renunciation each regains the life  that had been virtually transferred to the other--gains, in fact, the  other's existence and his own, as involved with that other. The ultimate  interests connected with the necessities and external concerns of life,  as well as the development that has to take place within their circle,  i. e., of the children, constitute a common object for the members of the  family. The spirit of the family--the _Penates_--form one substantial  being, as much as the spirit of a people in the State; and morality in  both cases consists in a feeling, a consciousness, and a will, not  limited to individual personality and interest, but embracing the common  interests of the members generally. But this unity is, in the case of  the family, essentially one of feeling, not advancing beyond the limits  of the merely natural. The piety of the family relation should be  respected in the highest degree by the State; by its means the State  obtains as its members individuals who are already moral (for as mere  persons they are not) and who, in uniting to form a State, bring with  them that sound basis of a political edifice--the capacity of feeling  one with a whole. But the expansion of the family to a patriarchal unity  carries us beyond the ties of blood-relationship--the simply natural  elements of that basis; and outside of these limits the members of the  community must enter upon the position of independent personality. A  review of the patriarchal condition, _in extenso_, would lead us to give  special attention to the theocratical constitution. The head of the  patriarchal clan is also its priest. If the family in its general  relations is not yet separated from civic society and the State, the  separation of religion from it has also not yet taken place; and so much  the less since the piety of the hearth is itself a profoundly subjective  state of feeling.    We have considered two aspects of freedom--the objective and the  subjective; if, therefore, freedom is asserted to consist in the  individuals of a State, all agreeing in its arrangements, it is evident  that only the subjective aspect is regarded. The natural inference from  this principle is, that no law can be valid without the approval of all.  It is attempted to obviate this difficulty by the decision that the  minority must yield to the majority; the majority therefore bears sway;  but long ago J.J. Rousseau remarked that, in that case, there would no  longer be freedom, for the will of the minority would cease to be  respected. At the Polish Diet each individual member had to give his  consent before any political step could be taken; and this kind of  freedom it was that ruined the State. Besides, it is a dangerous and  false prejudice that the people alone have reason and insight, and know  what justice is; for each popular faction may represent itself as the  people, and the question as to what constitutes the State is one of  advanced science and not of popular decision.    If the principle of regard for the individual will is recognized as the  only basis of political liberty, viz., that nothing should be done by or  for the State to which all the members of the body politic have not  given their sanction, we have, properly speaking, no constitution. The  only arrangement found necessary would be, first, a centre having no  will of its own, but which should take into consideration what appeared  to be the necessities of the State, and, secondly, a contrivance for  calling the members of the State together, for taking the votes, and for  performing the arithmetical operations of reckoning and comparing the  number of votes for the different propositions, and thereby deciding  upon them. The State is an abstraction, having even its generic  existence in its citizens; but it is an actuality, and its simply  generic existence must embody itself in individual will and activity.  The want of government and political administration in general is felt;  this necessitates the selection and separation from the rest of those  who have to take the helm in political affairs, to decide concerning  them, and to give orders to other citizens, with a view to the execution  of their plans. If, for instance, even the people in a democracy resolve  on a war, a general must head the army. It is only by a constitution  that the abstraction--the State--attains life and reality; but this  involves the distinction between those who command and those who obey.  Yet obedience seems inconsistent with liberty, and those who command  appear to do the very opposite of that which the fundamental idea of the  State, viz., that of freedom, requires. It is, however, urged that  though the distinction between commanding and obeying is absolutely  necessary, because affairs could not go on without it, and indeed, this  seems only a compulsory limitation, external to and even contravening  freedom in the abstract--the constitution should be at least so framed  that the citizens may obey as little as possible and the smallest  modicum of free volition be left to the commands of the superiors; that  the substance of that for which subordination is necessary, even in its  most important bearings, should be decided and resolved on by the  people, by the will of many or of all the citizens; though it is  supposed to be thereby provided that the State should be possessed of  vigor and strength as a reality--an individual unity. The primary  consideration is, then, the distinction between the governing and the  governed, and political constitutions in the abstract have been rightly  divided into monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy; this gives occasion,  however, for the remark that monarchy itself must be further divided  into despotism and monarchy proper; that in all the divisions to which  the leading idea gives rise, only the generic character is to be made  prominent, it being not intended thereby that the particular category  under review should be exhausted as a form, order, or kind in its  concrete development. But it must especially be observed that the above  mentioned divisions admit of a multitude of particular modifications--not  only such as lie within the limits of those classes themselves but also  such as are mixtures of several of these essentially distinct classes  and which are consequently misshapen, unstable, and inconsistent forms.  In such a collision, the concerning question is: What is the best  constitution--that is, by what arrangement, organization, or mechanism  of the power of the State can its object be most surely attained? This  object may indeed be variously understood; for instance, as the calm  enjoyment of life on part of the citizens, or as universal happiness.  Such aims have suggested "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12380"],[0,"Two Thousand Miles on an Automobile (#14)"],[1,"is that?\"    \"L--\" is the long drawn shout as we go flying by.    \"Why, the S___s live there.

CHAPTER EIGHT THE MORGAN MYSTERY  THE OLD STONE BLACKSMITH SHOP AT STAFFORD    It was Wednesday, August 22, that we left Buffalo. In some stray  notes made by my companion, I find this enthusiastic description  of the start.    \"Toof! toof! on it comes like a gigantic bird, its red breast  throbbing, its black wings quivering; it swerves to the right, to  the left, and with a quick sweep circles about and stands panting  at the curb impatient to be off.    \"I hastily mount and make ready for the long flight. The chauffeur  grasps the iron reins, something is pulled, and something is  pressed,--'Chic--chic--whirr--whirr--r--r,' we are off. Through  the rich foliage of noble trees we catch last glimpses of  beautiful homes gay with flags, with masses of flowers and broad,  green lawns.    \"In a moment we are in the crowded streets where cars, omnibuses,  cabs, carriages, trucks, and wagons of every description are  hurrying pell-mell in every direction. The automobile glides like  a thing of life in and out, snorting with vexation if blocked for  an instant.    \"Soon we are out of the hurly-burly; the homes melt away into the  country; the road lengthens; we pass the old toll-gate and are  fairly on our way; farewell city of jewelled towers and gay  festivities.    \"The day is bright, the air is sweet, and myriads of yellow  butterflies flutter about us, so thickly covering the ground in  places as to look like beds of yellow flowers.    \"Corn-fields and pastures stretch along the roadsides; big red  barns and cosey white houses seem to go skurrying by, calling, 'I  spy,' then vanishing in a sort of cinematographic fashion as the  automobile rushes on.\"    As we sped onward I pointed out the places--only too well  remembered--where the Professor had worked so hard exactly two  weeks before to the day.    After luncheon, while riding about some of the less frequented  streets of Batavia, we came quite unexpectedly to an old cemetery.  In the corner close to the tracks of the New York Central, so  placed as to be in plain view of all persons passing on trains, is  a tall, gray, weather-beaten monument, with the life-size figure  of a man on the top of the square shaft. It is the monument to the  memory of William Morgan who was kidnapped near that spot in the  month of September, 1826, and whose fate is one of the mysteries  of the last century.    To read the inscriptions I climbed the rickety fence; the grass  was high, the weeds thick; the entire place showed signs of  neglect and decay.    The south side of the shaft, facing the railroad, was inscribed as  follows:        Sacred To The Memory Of    WILLIAM MORGAN,    A NATIVE OF VIRGINIA,    A CAPT. IN THE WAR OF 1812,    A RESPECTABLE CITIZEN OF    BATAVIA, AND A MARTYR    TO THE FREEDOM OF WRITING,    PRINTING, AND SPEAKING THE    TRUTH. HE WAS ABDUCTED    FROM NEAR THIS SPOT IN THE    YEAR 1826 BY FREEMASONS,    AND MURDERED FOR REVEALING    THE SECRETS OF THE ORDER.    The disappearance of Morgan is still a mystery,--a myth to most  people nowadays; a very stirring reality in central and western  New York seventy-five years ago; even now in the localities  concerned the old embers of bitter feeling show signs of life if  fanned by so much as a breath.    Six miles beyond Batavia, on the road to Le Roy, is the little  village of Stafford; some twenty or thirty houses bordering the  highway; a church, a schoolhouse, the old stage tavern, and  several buildings that are to-day very much as they were nearly  one hundred years ago. This is the one place which remains very  much as it was seventy-five years ago when Morgan was kidnapped  and taken through to Canandaigua. As one approaches the little  village, on the left hand side of the highway set far back in an  open field is an old stone church long since abandoned and  disused, but so substantially built that it has defied time and  weather. It is a monument to the liberality of the people of that  locality in those early days, for it was erected for the  accommodation of worshippers regardless of sect; it was at the  disposal of any denomination that might wish to hold services  therein. Apparently the foundation of the weather-beaten structure  was too liberal, for it has been many years since it has been used  for any purpose whatsoever.    As one approaches the bridge crossing the little stream which cuts  the village in two, there is at the left on the bank of the stream  a large three-story stone dwelling. Eighty years ago the first  story of this dwelling was occupied as a store; the third story  was the Masonic lodge-room, and no doubt the events leading up to  the disappearance of Morgan were warmly discussed within the four  walls of this old building. Across from the three-story stone  building is a brick house set well back from the highway,  surrounded by shrubbery, and approached by a gravel walk bordered  by old-fashioned boxwood hedges. This house was built in 1812, and  is still well preserved. For many years it was a quite famous  private school for young ladies, kept by a Mr. Radcliffe.    Across the little bridge on the right is a low stone building now  used as a blacksmith shop, but which eighty years ago was a  dwelling. A little farther on the opposite side of the street is  the old stage tavern, still kept as a tavern, and to-day in  substantially the same condition inside and out as it was  seventy-five years ago. It is now only a roadside inn, but before  railroads were, through stages from Buffalo, Albany, and New York  stopped here. A charming old lady living just opposite, said,--    \"I have sat on this porch many a day and watched the stages and  private coaches come rattling up with horn and whip and carrying  the most famous people in the country,--all stopped there just  across the road at that old red tavern; those were gay days; I  shall never see the like again; but perhaps you may, for now  coaches like yours stop at the old tavern almost every day.\"    The ballroom of the tavern remains exactly as it was,--a fireplace  at one end filled with ashes of burnt-out revelries, a little  railing at one side where the fiddlers sat, the old benches along  the side,--all remind one of the gayeties of long ago.    In connection with the Morgan mystery the village of Stafford is  interesting, because the old tavern and the three-story stone  building are probably the only buildings still standing which were  identified with the events leading up to the disappearance of  Morgan. The other towns, like Batavia and Canandaigua, have grown  and changed, so that the old buildings have long since made way  for modern. One of the last to go was the old jail at Canandaigua  where Morgan was confined and from which he was taken. When that  old jail was torn down some years ago, people carried away pieces  of his cell as souvenirs of a mystery still fascinating because  still a mystery.    As we came out of the old tavern there were a number of men  gathered about the machine, looking at it. I asked them some  questions about the village, and happened to say,--    \"I once knew a man who, seventy-five years ago, lived in that  little stone building by the bridge.\"    \"That was in Morgan's time,\" said an old man, and every one in the  crowd turned instantly from the automobile to look at me.    \"Yes, he lived here as a young man.\"    \"They stopped at this very tavern with Morgan on their way  through,\" said some one in the crowd.    \"And that stone building just the other side of the bridge is  where the Masons met in those days,\" said another.    \"That's where they took Miller,\" interrupted the old man.    \"Who was Miller?\" I asked.    \"He was the printer in Batavia who was getting out Morgan's book;  they brought him here to Stafford, and took him up into the  lodge-room in that building and tried to frighten him, but he wasn't  to be frightened, so they took him on to Le Roy and let him go.\"    \"Did they ever find out what became of Morgan?\" I asked.    There was silence for a moment, and then the old man, looking  first at the others, said,--    \"No-o-o, not for sartain, but the people in this locality hed  their opinion, and hev it yet.\"    \"You bet they have,\" came from some one in the crowd.    Thursday we started for Rochester by way of Stafford and Le Roy  instead of Newkirk, Byron, and Bergen, which is the more direct  route and also a good road.    The morning was bright and very warm, scarcely a cloud in the sky,  but there was a feeling of storm in the air,--the earth was  restless.    As we neared Stafford dark clouds were gathering in the far  distant skies, but not yet near enough to cause apprehension.  Driving slowly into the village, we again visited the three-story  stone house. Here, no doubt, as elsewhere, Morgan's forthcoming  exposures were discussed and denounced, here the plot to seize  him--if plot there was--may have been formed; but then there was  probably no plot, conspiracy, or action on the part of any lodge  or body of Masons. Morgan was in their eyes a most despicable  traitor,--a man who proposed to sell--not simply disclose,"]]]
