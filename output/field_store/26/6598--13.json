Even in  writing _Don Carlos_ he had felt that he needed to give more care to  artistic form and to the deeper questions of dramatic unity. His own  dissatisfaction with the results achieved was one of several reasons  why for nearly ten years he dropped dramatic composition. He felt,  too, that he needed more experience of life. He himself said of the  greatest of his Storm and Stress dramas that he had attempted to  portray humanity before he really knew humanity.    In 1788 he published the first part of his _History of the Rebellion  of the Netherlands_, which brought him the appointment to the chair of  history in the University of Jena. The occupation with his next  historical work, the _History of the Thirty Years' War_, suggested to  him the thought of dramatizing the career of Wallenstein. But he was  not yet clear with himself on questions of artistic method. He was  studying Homer and dramatizing Euripides, lecturing and writing on  dramatic theory. Further delays were due to marriage and to serious  illness. It was not until 1796 that Schiller felt ready to begin work  on the long planned drama of _Wallenstein_.    The first scenes were written in prose, but soon the poet realized  that only the dignified heroic verse was suited to his theme. Then  \"all went better.\" Constant discussions with Goethe and Christian  Gottfried Koerner helped him to clear up his doubts and overcome the  difficulties of his subject. He found that history left too little  room for sympathy with Wallenstein, for he conceived him as really  guilty of treason. He decided early to lighten the gloom of his theme  by introducing the love episode of Max and Thekla. He modified also  his view of the nature of Wallenstein's guilt. Gradually the material  grew upon him. What he had planned as a Prologue became the one-act  play, _Wallenstein's Camp_, which, when it was produced in October,  1798, at the reopening of the Weimar Theatre, was preceded by 138  lines of Dedication, since printed as the _Prologue_. Already Schiller  had foreseen the development into more than five acts, and accordingly  _The Piccolomini_ appeared separately, January 30, 1799, and the whole  series in order about the middle of April, upon the completion of  _Wallenstein's Death_.    _Wallenstein_ is a trilogy, but in name rather than in real connection  and relation of parts. _Wallenstein's Camp_ is a picture of masses,  introducing only common soldiers and none of the chief personages of  the other parts of the composition. Its purpose is to present  something of the tremendous background of the action proper and to  give a realizing sense of the influence upon Wallenstein's career of  the soldiery with which he operated--as Schiller expressed it in a  line of his Prologue: \"His camp alone explains to us his crime.\" By  this he meant that, on the one hand, the blind confidence of the  troops in the luck and the destiny of their leader made him arrogant  and reckless, and, on the other hand, perhaps, that the mercenary  character of these soldiers of fortune forced Wallenstein to steps  which his calm judgment would have condemned.    In a succession of eleven scenes of very unequal length the various  arms of the service are introduced, together with camp followers and a  Capuchin preacher; in reminiscences the earlier features of the great  war and some feats of the general are recalled; in discussions the  character of Wallenstein and of his leading officers is sketched;  finally the report of the recent demand of the Emperor, that  Wallenstein detach 8,000 men to escort the Cardinal Infant to the  Netherlands, reveals the opposition of the army to such an order and  its unconditional loyalty to Wallenstein.    The second and third parts of the trilogy, _The Piccolomini_ and  _Wallenstein's Death_, constitute, in fact, one ten-act play, which  requires two evenings for presentation. So slight is the organic  division between the two plays that, as first presented, in the fall  of 1798 and the spring of 1799, _The Piccolomini_ included the first  two acts of _Wallenstein's Death_ as later printed and here given,  while the last three acts were so divided as to constitute five.    _The Piccolomini_, which could not be reprinted in this anthology,  presents essentially what is called the \"exposition\" of the entire  drama, together with a _part_ of the complication of the plot.  Questenberg, the imperial commissioner, visits Wallenstein's  headquarters in Pilsen to present the order of the Emperor for the  detachment of eight regiments of Wallenstein's best cavalry to serve  as escort to the Cardinal Infant on his way to the Netherlands. He  meets distrust and almost incredible defiance from Wallenstein's  officers, excepting Octavio Piccolomini, one of the oldest and most  trusted, to whom he brings secret dispatches directing him to  supersede Wallenstein in case of the latter's open rebellion, which  the court believes he has already determined upon. Wallenstein himself  meets the demands with a reproachful reference to the violation of the  plenary powers intrusted to him by the Emperor as the condition of his  assuming the command, but announces that he will relieve him from  embarrassment by resigning. This announcement is received with a storm  of protests from his officers. Questenberg and Octavio are deeply  concerned to make sure of the adherence to their cause of Octavio's  son, Max, a child of the camp and an especial favorite with  Wallenstein. Max has just arrived at Pilsen as escort of Wallenstein's  wife and of his daughter Thekla, to whom he has lost his heart.  Wallenstein and his masterful sister, Countess Terzky, are also eager  to secure Max to their side in the coming conflict, and the Countess  tries to persuade Thekla to govern her actions accordingly. Thekla,  however, is nobly frank with Max and warns him to trust only his own  heart; for she realizes that the threads of a dark plot are drawing  close about herself and Max, though she does not clearly understand  what it is. Meanwhile Terzky and Illo have planned a meeting of  Wallenstein's officers to protest against his withdrawal. In a  splendid banquet scene they present a written agreement (Revers) to  stand by the general _so far as loyalty to the Emperor will permit_,  and then, when all are heated with wine, secure signatures to a  substituted document from which this reservation of loyalty to the  Emperor is omitted. It is the hope of Illo and Terzky, through the  sight of this document, to persuade Wallenstein to open rebellion. Max  Piccolomini, coming late to the banquet from the interview with  Thekla, refuses to sign the pledge, not because he sees through the  deception, but because he is in no mood for business. Before morning  his father summons him, thinking Max has refused to sign because he  scented the intended treason, and reveals to him the whole  situation--the plots of the officers, Wallenstein's dangerous  negotiations with enemies of the Emperor, and his own commission to  take command and save whatever he can of loyal troops. Max is  thunder-truck. He can believe neither Wallenstein's purpose of  treason nor his father's duplicity in dealing behind the back of his  great commander. He refuses to follow his father's orders and leaves  him with the avowed intention of going to Wallenstein and calling upon  him to clear himself of the calumnious charges of the court. At this  point begins the action of _Wallenstein's Death_.    In all of his later dramas excepting _William Tell_, Schiller  endeavored to introduce a factor which is called \"the dramatic guilt,\"  a circumstance, usually in the character of the hero but sometimes in  his environment, which makes the tragic outcome inevitable and yet  leaves room in the breast of the reader or spectator for sympathy with  the hero in his fate. In the case of Wallenstein this \"guilt\" is the  dalliance with the love of power and the possibility of rebellion, not  a deliberate intention to commit treason. In the close of his  treatment of Wallenstein in The Thirty Years' War Schiller says: \"No  one of his actions justifies us in considering him convicted of  treason. * * * Thus Wallenstein fell, not because he was a rebel, but  he rebelled because he fell.\"    The circumstances are urged that Wallenstein was a prince of the  Empire, and had as such the right to negotiate with foreign powers;  that his delegated authority from the Emperor gave him the right to do  so in the Emperor's name; that the Emperor had not kept faith with  Wallenstein, and had thus justified him in at least frightening the  court; that self preservation seemed to indicate rebellion as the only  recourse; that Wallenstein's belief in his destiny and the fatuous  devotion of his army led him to reckless action; and finally that he  did not originally intend to commit actual treason.    Thus prepared, the reader can easily sympathize with Wallenstein in  his downfall; this sympathy is entirely won by the admirable courage  with which Wallenstein bears the successive blows of fate, and it is  strengthened by consideration of the mean motives of the men who serve  as the tools of his execution, and by the remembrance that the fate of  Max and Thekla is bound up in his. Schiller was concerned lest the  love episode should detract from the interest due the chief persons  of the tragedy; his art has effected the exact opposite.    The influence of Shakespeare is more or less obvious in all of  Schiller's later dramas. Aside from the splendid rhetoric of the  monologues, the character of Countess Terzky, so similar to that of  Lady Macheth, suggests this. But such influence is not so controlling  as to be in any respect a reproach to Schiller. Goethe in his generous  admiration considered Wallenstein \"so great that nothing could be  compared with it.\" \"In the imaginative power"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11716"],[0,"The Balkans: A History of Bulgaria—Serbia—Greece—Rumania—Turkey (#14)"],[1," that they and the  Croats are one people because they speak the same language, and that  racial and linguistic unity outweighs religious divergence. A very large  number of Croats agree with the Serbs in this and support their views, but  a minority for long obstinately insisted that there was a racial as well  as a religious difference, and that fusion was impossible. The former  based their argument on facts, the latter theirs on prejudice, which is  notoriously difficult to overcome. Latterly the movement in favour of  fusion grew very much stronger among the Croats, and together with that in  Serbia resulted in the Pan-Serb agitation which, gave the pretext for the  opening of hostilities in July 1914.    The designation Southern Slav (or Jugo-Slav, _jug_, pronounced yug, =  _south_ in Serbian) covers Serbs and Croats, and also includes Slovenes;  it is only used with reference to the Bulgarians from the point of view of  philology (the group of South Slavonic languages including Bulgarian,  Serbo-Croatian and Slovene; the East Slavonic, Russian; and the West  Slavonic, Polish and Bohemian).    In the history of the Serbs and Croats, or of the Serbo-Croatian race,  several factors of a general nature have first to be considered, which  have influenced its whole development. Of these, the physical nature of  the country in which they settled, between the Danube and Save and the  Adriatic, is one of the most important. It is almost everywhere  mountainous, and though the mountains themselves never attain as much as  10,000 feet in height, yet they cover the whole country with an intricate  network and have always formed an obstacle to easy communication between  the various parts of it. The result of this has been twofold. In the first  place it has, generally speaking, been a protection against foreign  penetration and conquest, and in so far was beneficial. Bulgaria, further  east, is, on the whole, less mountainous, in spite of the Balkan range  which stretches the whole length of it; for this reason, and also on  account of its geographical position, any invaders coming from the north  or north-east, especially if aiming at Constantinople or Salonika, were  bound to sweep over it. The great immemorial highway from the north-west  to the Balkan peninsula crosses the Danube at Belgrade and follows the  valley of the Morava to Nish; thence it branches off eastwards, going  through Sofia and again crossing all Bulgaria to reach Constantinople,  while the route to Salonika follows the Morava southwards from Nish and  crosses the watershed into the valley of the Vardar, which flows into the  Aegean. But even this road, following the course of the rivers Morava and  Vardar, only went through the fringe of Serb territory, and left untouched  the vast mountain region between the Morava and the Adriatic, which is  really the home of the Serb race.    In the second place, while it has undoubtedly been a protection to the  Serb race, it has also been a source of weakness. It has prevented a  welding together of the people into one whole, has facilitated the rise of  numerous political units at various times, and generally favoured the  dissipation of the national strength, and militated against national  organization and cohesion. In the course of history this process has been  emphasized rather than diminished, and to-day the Serb race is split up  into six political divisions, while Bulgaria, except for those Bulgars  claimed as 'unredeemed' beyond the frontier, presents a united whole. It  is only within the last thirty years, with the gradual improvement of  communications (obstructed to an incredible extent by the Austro-Hungarian  government) and the spread of education, that the Serbs in the different  countries which they inhabit have become fully conscious of their  essential identity and racial unity.    No less important than the physical aspect of their country on the  development of the Serbs has been the fact that right through the middle  of it from south to north there had been drawn a line of division more  than two centuries before their arrival. Artificial boundaries are  proverbially ephemeral, but this one has lasted throughout the centuries,  and it has been baneful to the Serbs. This dividing line, drawn first by  the Emperor Diocletian, has been described on p. 14; at the division of  the Roman Empire into East and West it was again followed, and it formed  the boundary between the dioceses of Italy and Dacia; the line is roughly  the same as the present political boundary between Montenegro and  Hercegovina, between the kingdom of Serbia and Bosnia; it stretched from  the Adriatic to the river Save right across the Serb territory. The  Serbo-Croatian race unwittingly occupied a country that was cut in two by  the line that divides East from West, and separates Constantinople and the  Eastern Church from Rome and the Western. This curious accident has had  consequences fatal to the unity of the race, since it has played into the  hands of ambitious and unscrupulous neighbours. As to the extent of the  country occupied by the Serbs at the beginning of their history it is  difficult to be accurate.    The boundary between the Serbs in the west of the peninsula and the  Bulgars in the east has always been a matter of dispute. The present  political frontier between Serbia and Bulgaria, starting in the north from  the mouth of the river Timok on the southern bank of the Danube and going  southwards slightly east of Pirot, is ethnographically approximately  correct till it reaches the newly acquired and much-disputed territories  in Macedonia, and represents fairly accurately the line that has divided  the two nationalities ever since they were first differentiated in the  seventh century. In the confused state of Balkan politics in the Middle  Ages the political influence of Bulgaria often extended west of this line  and included Nish and the Morava valley, while at other times that of  Serbia extended east of it. The dialects spoken in these frontier  districts represent a transitional stage between the two languages; each  of the two peoples naturally considers them more akin to its own, and  resents the fact that any of them should be included in the territory of  the other. Further south, in Macedonia, conditions are similar. Before the  Turkish conquest Macedonia had been sometimes under Bulgarian rule, as in  the times of Simeon, Samuel, and John Asen II, sometimes under Serbian,  especially during the height of Serbian power in the fourteenth century,  while intermittently it had been a province of the Greek Empire, which  always claimed it as its own. On historical grounds, therefore, each of  the three nations can claim possession of Macedonia. From an ethnographic  point of view the Slav population of Macedonia (there were always and are  still many non-Slav elements) was originally the same as that in the other  parts of the peninsula, and probably more akin to the Serbs, who are pure  Slavs, than to the Slavs of Bulgaria, who coalesced with their Asiatic  conquerors. In course of time, however, Bulgarian influences, owing to the  several periods when the Bulgars ruled the country, began to make headway.  The Albanians also (an Indo-European or Aryan race, but not of the Greek,  Latin, or Slav families), who, as a result of all the invasions of the  Balkan peninsula, had been driven southwards into the inaccessible  mountainous country now known as Albania, began to spread northwards and  eastwards again during the Turkish dominion, pushing back the Serbs from  the territory where they had long been settled. During the Turkish  dominion neither Serb nor Bulgar had any influence in Macedonia, and the  Macedonian Slavs, who had first of all been pure Slavs, like the Serbs,  then been several times under Bulgar, and finally, under Serb influence,  were left to themselves, and the process of differentiation between Serb  and Bulgar in Macedonia, by which in time the Macedonian Slavs would have  become either Serbs or Bulgars, ceased. The further development of the  Macedonian question is treated elsewhere (cf. chap. 13).    The Serbs, who had no permanent or well-defined frontier in the east,  where their neighbours were the Bulgars, or in the south, where they were  the Greeks and Albanians, were protected on the north by the river Save  and on the west by the Adriatic. They were split up into a number of  tribes, each of which was headed by a chief called in Serbian _[)z]upan_  and in Greek _arch[=o]n_. Whenever any one of these managed, either by  skill or by good fortune, to extend his power over a few of the  neighbouring districts he was termed _veliki_ (=great) _[)z]upan_. From  the beginning of their history, which is roughly put at A.D. 650, until  A.D. 1196, the Serbs were under foreign domination. Their suzerains were  nominally always the Greek emperors, who had 'granted' them the land they  had taken, and whenever the emperor happened to be energetic and powerful,  as were Basil I (the Macedonian, 867-86), John Tzimisces (969-76), Basil  II (976-1025), and Manuel Comnenus (1143-80), the Greek supremacy was very  real. At those times again when Bulgaria was very powerful, under Simeon  (893-927), Samuel (977-1014), and John Asen II (1218-41), many of the more  easterly and southerly Serbs came under Bulgarian rule, though it is  instructive to notice that the Serbs themselves do not recognize the West  Bulgarian or Macedonian kingdom of Samuel to have been a Bulgarian state.  The Bulgars, however, at no time brought all the Serb lands under their  sway.    Intermittently, whenever the power of Byzantium or of Bulgaria waned, some  Serb princeling would try to form a political state on a more ambitious  scale, but the fabric always collapsed at his death, and the Serbs  reverted to their favourite occupation of quarrelling amongst themselves.
