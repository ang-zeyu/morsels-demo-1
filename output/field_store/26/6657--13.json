So Edmond Fauville--\" muttered the Prefect, without finishing  his sentence.    In two minutes the whole situation had changed. In the eyes of the  magistrates, Mme. Fauville was no longer the widow and mother who must on  no account be attacked. She had suddenly become a woman whom  circumstances compelled them to cross-examine. However prejudiced they  might be in her favour, however charmed by the seductive qualities of her  beauty, they were inevitably bound to ask themselves, whether for some  reason or other, for instance, in order to be alone in the enjoyment of  the enormous fortune, she had not had the madness to kill her husband and  to kill the boy who was only her husband's son. In any case, the question  was there, calling for a solution.    The Prefect of Police continued:    \"Do you know this turquoise?\"    She took the stone which he held out to her and examined it without the  least sign of confusion.    \"No,\" she said. \"I have an old-fashioned turquoise necklace, which I  never wear, but the stones are larger and none of them has this  irregular shape.\"    \"We found this one in the safe,\" said M. Desmalions. \"It forms part of a  ring belonging to a person whom we know.\"    \"Well,\" she said eagerly, \"you must find that person.\"    \"He is here,\" said the Prefect, pointing to Don Luis, who had been  standing some way off and who had not been noticed by Mme. Fauville.    She started at the sight of Perenna and cried, very excitedly:    \"But that gentleman was here yesterday evening! He was talking to my  husband--and so was that other gentleman,\" she said, referring to  Sergeant Mazeroux. \"You must question them, find out why they were here.  You understand that, if the turquoise belonged to one of them--\"    The insinuation was direct, but clumsy; and it lent the greatest weight  to Perenna's unspoken argument:    \"The turquoise was picked up by some one who saw me yesterday and who  wishes to compromise me. Apart from M. Fauville and the detective  sergeant, only two people saw me: Silvestre, the manservant, and Mme.  Fauville. Consequently, as Silvestre is outside the question, I accuse  Mme. Fauville of putting the turquoise in the safe.\"    M. Desmalions asked:    \"Will you let me see the necklace, Madame?\"    \"Certainly. It is with my other jewels, in my wardrobe. I will go for  it.\"    \"Pray don't trouble, Madame. Does your maid know the necklace?\"    \"Quite well.\"    \"In that case, Sergeant Mazeroux will tell her what is wanted.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Not a word was spoken during the few minutes for which Mazeroux was  absent. Mme. Fauville seemed absorbed in her grief. M. Desmalions kept  his eyes fixed on her.    The sergeant returned, carrying a very large box containing a number of  jewel-cases and loose ornaments.    M. Desmalions found the necklace, examined it, and realized, in fact,  that the stones did not resemble the turquoise and that none of them was  missing. But, on separating two jewel cases in order to take out a tiara  which also contained blue stones, he made a gesture of surprise.    \"What are these two keys?\" he asked, pointing to two keys identical in  shape and size with those which opened the lock and the bolt of the  garden door.    Mme. Fauville remained very calm. Not a muscle of her face moved. Nothing  pointed to the least perturbation on account of this discovery. She  merely said:    \"I don't know. They have been there a long time.\"    \"Mazeroux,\" said M. Desmalions, \"try them on that door.\"    Mazeroux did so. The door opened.    \"Yes,\" said Mme. Fauville. \"I remember now, my husband gave them to me.  They were duplicates of his own keys--\"    The words were uttered in the most natural tone and as though the speaker  did not even suspect the terrible charge that was forming against her.    And nothing was more agonizing than this tranquillity. Was it a sign of  absolute innocence, or the infernal craft of a criminal whom nothing is  able to stir? Did she realize nothing of the tragedy which was taking  place and of which she was the unconscious heroine? Or did she guess the  terrible accusation which was gradually closing in upon her on every side  and which threatened her with the most awful danger? But, in that case,  how could she have been guilty of the extraordinary blunder of keeping  those two keys?    A series of questions suggested itself to the minds of all those present.  The Prefect of Police put them as follows:    \"You were out, Madame, were you not, when the murders were committed?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"You were at the opera?\"    \"Yes; and I went on to a party at the house of one of my friends, Mme.  d'Ersingen.\"    \"Did your chauffeur drive you?\"    \"To the opera, yes. But I sent him back to his garage; and he came to  fetch me at the party.\"    \"I see,\" said M. Desmalions. \"But how did you go from the opera to Mme.  d'Ersingen's?\"    For the first time, Mme. Fauville seemed to understand that she was the  victim of a regular cross-examination; and her look and attitude betrayed  a certain uneasiness. She replied:    \"I took a motor cab.\"    \"In the street?\"    \"On the Place de l'Opera.\"    \"At twelve o'clock, therefore?\"    \"No, at half-past eleven: I left before the opera was over.\"    \"You were in a hurry to get to your friend's?\"    \"Yes ... or rather--\"    She stopped; her cheeks were scarlet; her lips and chin trembled; and  she asked:    \"Why do you ask me all these questions?\"    \"They are necessary, Madame. They may throw a light on what we want to  know. I beg you, therefore, to answer them. At what time did you reach  your friend's house?\"    \"I hardly know. I did not notice the time.\"    \"Did you go straight there?\"    \"Almost.\"    \"How do you mean, almost?\"    \"I had a little headache and told the driver to go up the Champs  Elysees and the Avenue du Bois--very slowly--and then down the Champs  Elysees again--\"    She was becoming more and more embarrassed. Her voice grew indistinct.  She lowered her head and was silent.    Certainly her silence contained no confession, and there was nothing  entitling any one to believe that her dejection was other than a  consequence of her grief. But yet she seemed so weary as to give the  impression that, feeling herself lost, she was giving up the fight. And  it was almost a feeling of pity that was entertained for this woman  against whom all the circumstances seemed to be conspiring, and who  defended herself so badly that her cross-examiner hesitated to press her  yet further.    M. Desmalions, in fact, wore an irresolute air, as if the victory had  been too easy, and as if he had some scruple about pursuing it.    Mechanically he observed Perenna, who passed him a slip of paper, saying:    \"Mme. d'Ersingen's telephone number.\"    M. Desmalions murmured:    \"Yes, true, they may know--\"    And, taking down the receiver, he asked for number 325.04. He was  connected at once and continued:    \"Who is that speaking?... The butler? Ah! Is Mme. d'Ersingen at  home?... No?... Or Monsieur?... Not he, either?... Never mind, you can  tell me what I want to know. I am M. Desmalions, the Prefect of Police,  and I need certain information. At what time did Mme. Fauville come last  night?... What do you say?... Are you sure?... At two o'clock in the  morning?... Not before?... And she went away?... In ten minutes  time?... Good ... But you're certain you are not mistaken about the  time when she arrived? I must know this positively: it is most  important.... You say it was two o'clock in the morning? Two o'clock in  the morning?... Very well.... Thank you.\"    When M. Desmalions turned round, he saw Mme. Fauville standing beside him  and looking at him with an expression of mad anguish. And one and the  same idea occurred to the mind of all the onlookers. They were in the  presence either of an absolutely innocent woman or else of an exceptional  actress whose face lent itself to the most perfect simulation of  innocence.    \"What do you want?\" she stammered. \"What does this mean? Explain  yourself!\"    Then M. Desmalions asked simply:    \"What were you doing last night between half-past eleven in the evening  and two o'clock in the morning?\"    It was a terrifying question at the stage which the examination had  reached, a fatal question implying:    \"If you cannot give us an exact and strict account of the way in which  you employed your time while the crime was being committed, we have the  right to conclude that you were not alien to the murder of your husband  and stepson--\"    She understood it in this sense and staggered on her feet, moaning:    \"It's horrible!... horrible!\"    The Prefect repeated:    \"What were you doing? The question must be quite easy to answer.\"    \"Oh,\" she cried, in the same piteous tone, \"how can you believe!... Oh,  no, no, it's not possible! How can you believe!\"    \"I believe nothing yet,\" he said. \"Besides, you can establish the truth  with a single word.\"    It seemed, from the movement of her lips and the sudden gesture of  resolution that shook her frame, as though she were about to speak that  word. But all at once she appeared stupefied and dumfounded, pronounced a  few unintelligible syllables, and fell huddled into a chair, sobbing  convulsively and uttering cries of despair.    It was tantamount to a confession. At the very least, it was a confession  of her inability to supply the plausible explanation which would have put  an end to the discussion.    The Prefect of Police moved away from her and spoke in a low voice to the  examining magistrate and the public prosecutor. Perenna and Sergeant  Mazeroux were left alone together, side by side.    Mazeroux whispered:    \"What did I tell you? I knew you would find out! Oh, what a man you are!  The way you managed!\"    He was beaming at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13065"],[0,"Beethoven's Letters 1790-1826, Volume 1 (#14)"],[1,"either the  date of this note, or the lady to whom it is addressed.]      63.    TO ZMESKALL.[1]    January 23, 1810.    What are you about? My gayety yesterday, though only assumed, has not only  vexed but offended you. The _uninvited guests_ seemed so little to deserve  your ill-humor, that I endeavored to use all my friendly influence to  prevent your giving way to it, by my pretended flow of spirits. I am still  suffering from indigestion. Say whether you can meet me at the \"Swan\"  to-day.    Your true friend,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: The cause that gave rise to this note is not known.]      64.    TO WEGELER.    Vienna, May 2, 1810.    MY DEAR OLD FRIEND,--    These lines may very possibly cause you some surprise, and yet, though you  have no written proof of it, I always retain the most lively remembrance of  you. Among my MSS. is one that has long been destined for you, and which  you shall certainly receive this summer. For the last two years my secluded  and quiet life has been at an end, and I have been forcibly drawn into the  vortex of the world; though as yet I have attained no good result from  this,--nay, perhaps rather the reverse,--but who has not been affected by  the storms around us? Still I should not only be happy, but the happiest of  men, if a demon had not taken up his settled abode in my ears. Had I not  somewhere read that man must not voluntarily put an end to his life while  he can still perform even one good deed, I should long since have been no  more, and by my own hand too! Ah! how fair is life; but for me it is  forever poisoned!    You will not refuse me one friendly service, which is to procure me my  baptismal certificate. As Steffen Breuning has an account with you, he can  pay any expenses you may incur, and I will repay him here. If you think it  worth while to make the inquiry in person, and choose to make a journey  from Coblenz to Bonn, you have only to charge it all to me. I must,  however, warn you that I had an _elder brother_ whose name was also Ludwig,  with the second name of _Maria_, who died. In order to know my precise age,  the date of my birth must be first ascertained, this circumstance having  already led others into error, and caused me to be thought older than I  really am. Unluckily, I lived for some time without myself knowing my age  [see Nos. 26 and 51]. I had a book containing all family incidents, but it  has been lost, Heaven knows how! So pardon my urgently requesting you to  try to discover _Ludwig Maria's_ birth, as well as that of the present  Ludwig. The sooner you can send me the certificate of baptism the more  obliged shall I be.[1] I am told that you sing one of my songs in your  Freemason Lodge, probably the one in E major, which I have not myself got;  send it to me, and I promise to compensate you threefold and fourfold.[2]  Think of me with kindness, little as I apparently deserve it. Embrace your  dear wife and children, and all whom you love, in the name of your friend,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Wegeler says:--\"I discovered the solution of the enigma (why  the baptismal certificate was so eagerly sought) from a letter written to  me three months afterwards by my brother-in-law, Stephan von Breuning, in  which he said: 'Beethoven tells me at least once a week that he means to  write to you; but I believe his _intended marriage is broken off_; he  therefore feels no ardent inclination to thank you for having procured his  baptismal certificate.'\"]    [Footnote 2: Beethoven was mistaken; Wegeler had only supplied other music  to the words of Matthisson's _Opfer Lied_.]      65.    TO ZMESKALL.    July 9, 1810.    DEAR Z.,--    You are about to travel, and so am I on account of my health. In the mean  time all goes topsy-turvy with me. The _Herr_[1] wants to have me with him,  and Art is not less urgent in her claims. I am partly in Schoenbrunn and  partly here; every day assailed by messages from strangers and new  acquaintances, and even as regards art I am often driven nearly distracted  by my undeserved fame. Fortune seeks me, and for that very reason I almost  dread some new calamity. As for your \"Iphigenie,\" the facts are these. I  have not seen it for the last two years and a half, and have no doubt lent  it to some one; but to whom?--that is the question. I have sent in all  directions, and have not yet discovered it, but hope still to find it. If  lost, you shall be indemnified. Farewell, my dear Z. I trust that when we  meet again you will find that my art has made some progress in the interim.    Ever remain my friend, as much as I am yours,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: The \"Herr\" is his pupil, the Archduke Rudolph.]      66.    TO BETTINA BRENTANO.[1]    Vienna, August 11, 1810.    MY DEAREST FRIEND,--    Never was there a lovelier spring than this year; I say so, and feel it  too, because it was then I first knew you. You have yourself seen that in  society I am like a fish on the sand, which writhes and writhes, but cannot  get away till some benevolent Galatea casts it back into the mighty ocean.  I was indeed fairly stranded, dearest friend, when surprised by you at a  moment in which moroseness had entirely mastered me; but how quickly it  vanished at your aspect! I was at once conscious that you came from another  sphere than this absurd world, where, with the best inclinations, I cannot  open my ears. I am a wretched creature, and yet I complain of others!! You  will forgive this from the goodness of heart that beams in your eyes, and  the good sense manifested by your ears; at least they understand how to  flatter, by the mode in which they listen. My ears are, alas! a  partition-wall, through which I can with difficulty hold any intercourse  with my fellow-creatures. Otherwise, perhaps, I might have felt more  assured with you; but I was only conscious of the full, intelligent glance  from your eyes, which affected me so deeply that never can I forget it. My  dear friend! dearest girl!--Art! who comprehends it? with whom can I  discuss this mighty goddess? How precious to me were the few days when we  talked together, or, I should rather say, corresponded! I have carefully  preserved the little notes with your clever, charming, most charming  answers; so I have to thank my defective hearing for the greater part of  our fugitive intercourse being written down. Since you left this I have had  some unhappy hours,--hours of the deepest gloom, when I could do nothing.  I wandered for three hours in the Schoenbrunn Allee after you left us, but  no _angel_ met me there to take possession of me as you did. Pray forgive,  my dear friend, this deviation from the original key, but I must have such  intervals as a relief to my heart. You have no doubt written to Goethe  about me? I would gladly bury my head in a sack, so that I might neither  see nor hear what goes on in the world, because I shall meet you there no  more; but I shall get a letter from you? Hope sustains me, as it does half  the world; through life she has been my close companion, or what would have  become of me? I send you \"Kennst Du das Land,\" written with my own hand, as  a remembrance of the hour when I first knew you; I send you also another  that I composed since I bade you farewell, my dearest, fairest sweetheart!      Herz, mein Herz, was soll das geben,    Was bedraenget dich so sehr;    Welch ein neues fremdes Leben,    Ich erkenne dich nicht mehr.    Now answer me, my dearest friend, and say what is to become of me since my  heart has turned such a rebel. Write to your most faithful friend,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: The celebrated letters to Bettina are given here exactly as  published in her book, _Ilius Pamphilius und die Ambrosia_ (Berlin, Arnim,  1857) in two volumes. I never myself had any doubts of their being genuine  (with the exception of perhaps some words in the middle of the third  letter), nor can any one now distrust them, especially after the  publication of _Beethoven's Letters_. But for the sake of those for whom  the weight of innate conviction is not sufficient proof, I may here mention  that in December, 1864, Professor Moritz Carriere, in Munich, when  conversing with me about _Beethoven's Letters_, expressly assured me that  these three letters were genuine, and that he had seen them in Berlin at  Bettina v. Arnim's in 1839, and read them most attentively and with the  deepest interest. From their important contents, he urged their immediate  publication; and when this shortly after ensued, no change whatever struck  him as having been made in the original text; on the contrary, he still  perfectly remembered that the much-disputed phraseology (and especially the  incident with Goethe) was precisely the same as in the originals. This  testimony seems to me the more weighty, as M. Carriere must not in such  matters be looked on as a novice, but as a competent judge, who has  carefully studied all that concerns our literary heroes, and who would not  permit anything to be falsely imputed to Beethoven any more than to Goethe.  Beethoven's biography is, however, the proper place to discuss more closely  such things, especially his character and his conduct in this particular  case. At present we only refer in general terms to the first chapter of  _Beethoven's Jugend_, which gives all the facts connected with these  letters to Bettina and the following ones--a characteristic likeness of  Beethoven thus impressed itself on the mind of the biographer, and was  reproduced in a few bold outlines in his _Biography_. These letters could  not, however, possibly be given _in extenso_ in a general introduction to a  comprehensive biography.]      67.    TO BETTINA BRENTANO.    Vienna, Feb. 10, 1811.    DEAR AND BELOVED FRIEND,--    I have now received two letters from you, while those to Tonie show that  you still remember me, and even too kindly. I carried your letter about  with me the whole summer, and it often made me "]]]
