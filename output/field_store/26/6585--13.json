A great change had been effected in  this land of political narrowness and social sterility since the year  1750. A literature and a science, born in the hearts of the nation, and  deeply rooted in the moral teaching of Protestantism, had raised their  minds far beyond the boundaries of practical life into the sunlit  heights of intellectual liberty, and manifested the power and  superiority of the German spirit. \"Thus the new poetry and science  became for many decades the most effectual bond of union for this  dismembered people, and decided the victory of Protestantism in German  life.\" [B]    [Footnote B: Treitschke, \"Deutsche Geschichte\", i., p. 88.]    Germany was raised to be once more \"the home of heresy, since she  developed the root-idea of the Reformation into the right of  unrestricted and unprejudiced inquiry\". [C] Moral obligations, such as no  nation had ever yet made the standard of conduct, were laid down in the  philosophy of Kant and Fichte, and a lofty idealism inspired the songs  of her poets. The intense effect of these spiritual agencies was  realized in the outburst of heroic fury in 1813. \"Thus our classical  literature, starting from a different point, reached the same goal as  the political work of the Prussian monarchy\", [D] and of those men of  action who pushed this work forward in the hour of direst ruin.    [Footnote C: _Ibid.,_ i., p. 90.]    [Footnote D: _Ibid._]    The meeting of Napoleon and Goethe, two mighty conquerors, was an event  in the world's history. On one side the scourge of God, the great  annihilator of all survivals from the past, the gloomy despot, the last  abortion of the revolution--a      \"Part of the power that still    Produces Good, while still devising Ill\";    on the other, the serenely grave Olympian who uttered the words, \"Let  man be noble, resourceful, and good\"; who gave a new content to the  religious sentiment, since he conceived all existence as a perpetual  change to higher conditions, and pointed out new paths in science; who  gave the clearest expression to all aspirations of the human intellect,  and all movements of the German mind, and thus roused his people to  consciousness; who finally by his writings on every subject showed that  the whole realm of human knowledge was concentrated in the German brain;  a prophet of truth, an architect of imperishable monuments which testify  to the divinity in man.    The great conqueror of the century was met by the hero of intellect, to  whom was to fall the victory of the future. The mightiest potentate of  the Latin race faced the great Germanic who stood in the forefront of  humanity.    Truly a nation which in the hour of its deepest political degradation  could give birth to men like Fichte, Scharnhorst, Stein, Schiller, and  Goethe, to say nothing about the great soldier-figures of the wars of  Liberation, must be called to a mighty destiny.    We must admit that in the period immediately succeeding the great  struggle of those glorious days, the short-sightedness, selfishness, and  weakness of its Sovereigns, and the jealousy of its neighbours, robbed  the German people of the full fruits of its heroism, devotion, and pure  enthusiasm. The deep disappointment of that generation found expression  in the revolutionary movement of 1848, and in the emigration of  thousands to the free country of North America, where the Germans took a  prominent part in the formation of a new nationality, but were lost to  their mother-country. The Prussian monarchy grovelled before Austria and  Russia, and seemed to have forgotten its national duties.    Nevertheless in the centre of the Prussian State there was springing up  from the blood of the champions of freedom a new generation that no  longer wished to be the anvil, but to wield the hammer. Two men came to  the front, King William I. and the hero of the Saxon forest. Resolutely  they united the forces of the nation, which at first opposed them from  ignorance, and broke down the selfishness and dogmatic positivism of the  popular representatives. A victorious campaign settled matters with  Austria, who did not willingly cede the supremacy in Germany, and left  the German Imperial confederation without forfeiting her place as a  Great Power. France was brought to the ground with a mighty blow; the  vast majority of the German peoples united under the Imperial crown  which the King of Prussia wore; the old idea of the German Empire was  revived in a federal shape by the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria,  and Italy. The German idea, as Bismarck fancied it, ruled from the North  Sea to the Adriatic and the Mediterranean. Like a phoenix from the  ashes, the German giant rose from the sluggard-bed of the old German  Confederation, and stretched his mighty limbs.    It was an obvious and inevitable result that this awakening of Germany  vitally affected the other nations which had hitherto divided the  economic and political power. Hostile combinations threatened us on all  sides in order to check the further expansion of our power. Hemmed in  between France and Russia, who allied themselves against us, we failed  to gather the full fruits of our victories. The short-sightedness and  party feuds of the newly-formed Reichstag--the old hereditary failings  of our nation--prevented any colonial policy on broad lines. The intense  love of peace, which the nation and Government felt, made us fall behind  in the race with other countries.    In the most recent partition of the earth, that of Africa, victorious  Germany came off badly. France, her defeated opponent, was able to found  the second largest colonial Empire in the world; England appropriated  the most important portions; even small and neutral Belgium claimed a  comparatively large and valuable share; Germany was forced to be content  with some modest strips of territory. In addition to, and in connection  with, the political changes, new views and new forces have come forward.    Under the influence of the constitutional ideas of Frederick the Great,  and the crop of new ideas borne by the French Revolution, the conception  of the State has completely changed since the turn of the century. The  patrimonial state of the Middle Ages was the hereditary possession of  the Sovereign. Hence sprung the modern State, which represents the  reverse of this relation, in which the Sovereign is the first servant of  the State, and the interest of the State, and not of the ruler, is the  key to the policy of the Government. With this altered conception of the  State the principle of nationality has gradually developed, of which the  tendency is as follows: Historical boundaries are to be disregarded, and  the nations combined into a political whole; the State will thus acquire  a uniform national character and common national interests.    This new order of things entirely altered the basis of international  relations, and set new and unknown duties before the statesman. Commerce  and trade also developed on wholly new lines.    After 1815 the barriers to every activity--guilds and trade  restrictions--were gradually removed. Landed property ceased to be a  monopoly. Commerce and industries flourished conspicuously. \"England  introduced the universal employment of coal and iron and of machinery  into industries, thus founding immense industrial establishments; by  steamers and railways she brought machinery into commerce, at the same  time effecting an industrial revolution by physical science and  chemistry, and won the control of the markets of the world by cotton.  There came, besides, the enormous extension of the command of credit in  the widest sense, the exploitation of India, the extension of  colonization over Polynesia, etc.\" England at the same time girdled the  earth with her cables and fleets. She thus attained to a sort of  world-sovereignty. She has tried to found a new universal Empire; not,  indeed, by spiritual or secular weapons, like Pope and Emperor in bygone  days, but by the power of money, by making all material interests  dependent on herself.    Facing her, between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, linking the West  and the East, the United States of North America have risen to be an  industrial and commercial power of the first rank. Supported by  exceptionally abundant natural resources, and the unscrupulously pushing  character of her inhabitants, this mighty Empire aims at a suitable  recognition of her power in the council of the nations, and is on the  point of securing this by the building of a powerful navy.      Russia has not only strengthened her position in Europe, but has  extended her power over the entire North of Asia, and is pressing  farther into the centre of that continent. She has already crossed  swords with the States of the Mongolian race. This vast population,  which fills the east of the Asiatic continent, has, after thousands of  years of dormant civilization, at last awakened to political life, and  categorically claims its share in international life. The entrance of  Japan into the circle of the great World Powers means a call to arms.  \"Asia for the Asiatics,\" is the phrase which she whispers beneath her  breath, trusting in the strength of her demand. The new Great Power has  emerged victoriously from its first encounter with a European foe.  China, too, is preparing to expand her forces outwardly. A mighty  movement is thrilling Asia--the awakening of a new epoch.    Dangers, then, which have already assumed a profound importance for the  civilized countries of Europe, are threatening from Asia, the old cradle  of the nations. But even in the heart of the European nations, forces  which have slumbered hitherto are now awake. The persisting ideas of the  French Revolution and the great industrial progress which characterized  the last century, have roused the working classes of every country to a  consciousness of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11365"],[0,"The Fern Lover's Companion (#14)"],[1,"superstitions and was  reputed to open all locks at a mere touch, and to unshoe all horses that  trod upon it. \"Unshoe the horse\" was one of the names given to it by the  country people.      \"Horses that feeding on the grassy hills,    Tread upon moonwort with their hollow heels,    Though lately shod, at night go barefoot home    Their maister musing where their shoes be gone.\"    In dry pastures, Lake Superior and northward, but rare in the United  States. Willoughby, Vt., where the author found a single plant in 1904, and  St. Johnsbury, Vt. Also New York, Michigan and westward.    In England said to be local rather than rare. Sometimes called Lunary.      \"Then sprinkled she the juice of rue    With nine drops of the midnight dew    From Lunary distilling.\"    DRAYTON.    (2) LITTLE GRAPE FERN. _Botrychium simplex_    Fronds two to four inches high, very variable. Sterile segment  short-petioled, usually near the middle, simple and roundish or pinnately  three to seven lobed. Veins all forking from the base. Fertile segments  simple or one to two pinnate, apex of both segments erect in the bud.    In moist woods and fields, Canada to Maryland and westward; Conway and  Plainfield, Mass., Berlin and Litchfield, Conn. Rare. According to Pringle  it is \"abundantly scattered over Vermont, its habitat usually poor soil,  especially knolls of hill pastures.\" May or June.    (3) LANCE-LEAVED GRAPE FERN    _Botrychium lanceolatum_    BOTRYCHIUM ANGUSTISEGMENTUM    Frond two to nine inches high, both sterile and fertile segments at the  top of the common stalk. Sterile segment triangular, twice pinnatifid, the  acute lobes lanceolate, incised or toothed, scarcely fleshy, resembling  a very small specimen of the rattlesnake fern. Fertile segment slightly  overtopping the sterile, two to three pinnate and spreading.    One of the constant companions of the rattlesnake fern. New England to Lake  Superior. July.    [Illustration: Little Grape Fern _Botrychium simplex_]    [Illustration: Lance-leaved Grape Fern _Botrychium lanceolatum Botrychium  angustisegmentum_]    (4) MATRICARY FERN    _Botrychium ramosum. Botrychium matricariaefolium_    Fronds small, one to twelve inches high. Sterile segment above the middle,  usually much divided. Fertile segment twice or thrice pinnate. Apex of both  segments turned down in the bud, the sterile overtopping and clasping the  fertile one.    [Illustration: The Matricary Fern _Botrychium ramosum_]    The matricary fern differs from the preceding in ripening its spores about  a month earlier, in having its sterile frond stalked, besides being a  taller and fleshier plant. It may also be noted that in the lance-leaved  species the midveins of the larger lobes are continuous, running to the  tip; whereas in the matricary fern the midveins fork repeatedly and are  soon indistinguishable from the veinlets. The two are apt to grow near each  other, with the rattlesnake fern as a near neighbor. June.    NOTE. In 1897 A.A. Eaton discovered certain _Botrychia_ in a sphagnum  swamp in New Hampshire, to which he gave the specific name of _Botrychium  tenebrosum_. The plants were very small, not averaging above two or three  inches high, with the sterile blade sessile or slightly stalked. Many  botanists prefer to place this fern as a variety of the matricary, but  others regard it as a form of _Botrychium simplex_. Borders of maple  swamps, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York.    (5) COMMON GRAPE FERN    _Botrychium obliquum_. _Botrychium ternatum_, var.  _obliquum_    BOTRYCHIUM DISSECTUM, var. OBLIQUUM    Rootstock short, its base including the buds of succeeding years. Fronds  two to twelve inches or more high. Leafy or sterile segment triangular,  ternate, long-petioled, springing from near the base of the plant, and  spreading horizontally. From the main leafstock grow several pairs of  stalked pinnae, with the divisions ovate-oblong, acutish, crenate-serrulate,  obliquely cordate or subcordate. Fertile segment taller, erect, about three  times pinnate, maturing its fruit in autumn. Occasionally two or three  fertile spikes grow on the same plant. In vernation the apex of each  segment is bent down with a slight curve inward.    [Illustration: Common Grape Fern. _Botrychium obliquum_]    New England to Virginia, westward to Minnesota and southward.    _Botrychium obliquum_, var. _dissectum_. Similar to the type, but with  the divisions very finely dissected or incisely many-toothed, the most  beautiful of all the grape ferns. There is considerable variety in the  cutting of the fronds. Maine to Florida and westward.    _Botrychium obliquum_, var. _oneidense_. Ultimate segments oblong, rounded  at the apex, crenulate-serrate, less divided than any of the others and,  perhaps, less common. Vermont to Central New York.    _Botrychium obliquum_, var. _elongatum_. Divisions lanceolate, elongated,  acute.    [Illustration: _Botrychium obliquum_ var. _oneidense_]    Note: A Botrychium not uncommon in Georgia and Alabama, named by Swartz  B. lunarioides, deserves careful study. It is known as the \"Southern  Botrychium.\"    [Illustration: _Botrychium obliquum, var. dissectum_]    (6) TERNATE GRAPE FERN    _Botrychium ternatum_, var. _intermedium_    _Botrychium obliquum_, var. _intermedium_    Leaf more divided than in _obliquum_ and the numerous segments not so  long and pointed, but large, fleshy, ovate or obovate (including var.  _australe_), crenulate, and more or less toothed.    Sandy soil, pastures and open woods. More northerly in its range--New  England and New York. Var. _rutaefolium_. More slender, rarely over six or  seven inches high; sterile segment about two inches broad, its divisions  few, broadly ovate, the lowest sublunate. The first variety passes  insensibly into the second.    [Illustration: Ternate Grape Fern _Botrychium ternatum_ var. _intermedium_  (Reduced)]    [Illustration: Ternate Grape Fern _Botrychium ternatum_ var. _intermedium_  (Two stocks, reduced)]    (7) RATTLESNAKE FERN. _Botrychium virginianum_    Fronds six inches to two feet high. Sterile segment sessile above the  middle of the plant, broadly triangular, thin, membranaceous, ternate.  Pinnules lanceolate, deeply pinnatifid; ultimate segments oblong or  lanceolate and scarcely or not at all spatulate. Fertile part long-stalked,  two to three pinnate, its ultimate segments narrow and thick, nearly  opaque in dried specimens. Mature sporangia varying from dark yellow-brown  to almost black. Open sporangia close again and are flattened or of a  lenticular form. In rich, deciduous woods, rather common and widely  distributed.    [Illustration: Rattlesnake Fern. _Botrychium virginianum_ (From Waters's  \"Ferns,\" Henry Holt & Co.)]    Prince Edward Island, Minnesota, south to Florida and Texas, and north to  Newfoundland and Labrador.    Var. _gracilis_. A form much reduced in size.    Var. LAURENTIANUM. A conspicuous variety having thick and heavy sterile  fronds less finely divided than the type, with the segments crowded to  overlapping. Pinnules shorter than the type, tending to be ovate, outer  segments strongly spatulate. Fertile spike relatively short and stout,  strongly paniculate when well developed. Ultimate segments flat, folaceous,  one mm. wide. Mostly confined to the limestone district near the Gulf of  St. Lawrence, Labrador, Newfoundland, Quebec, Maine, and Michigan.    Var. INTERMEDIUM. Segments of sterile fronds ultimately much spatulate,  previously ovate, not overlapping. Segments of fertile fronds ultimately  narrowly flattened. (For this and the other varieties see Rhodora of  September, 1919.) Nova Scotia, Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut,  northern New York, Illinois, and Missouri.    Var. EUROPAEUM. Fertile frond less finely dissected than in type. Ultimate  segments more obtuse than in type; has but very slight tendency towards the  spatulate form of the two previous varieties. Pinnules lanceolate, strongly  decurrent so that the pinnae are merely pinnatifid. In coniferous forests  of Canada, and confined to calcareous regions. Quebec, New Brunswick, New  Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Ontario, Montana, and British Columbia. Said  to be rare even in Europe.          V    THE FILMY FERN FAMILY      _HYMENOPHYLLACEAE_    The filmy ferns are small, delicate plants with membranaceous, finely  dissected fronds from slender, creeping rootstocks. Sporangia sessile on  a bristle-like receptacle. There are about one hundred species, mostly  tropical, only one of which grows as far north as Kentucky.    [Illustration: Filmy Fern _Trichomanes Boschianum_ (From Waters' \"Ferns\",  Henry Holt & Co.)]    FILMY FERN. BRISTLE FERN    _Trichomanes Boschianum. Trichomanes radicans_    Rootstocks creeping, filiform, stipes ascending, one to three inches  long, thin, very delicate, pellucid, much divided, oblong-lanceolate,  bipinnatifid. Rachis narrowly winged. Sporangia clustered around the  slender bristle, which is the prolongation of a vein, and surrounded by a  vase-like, slightly two-lipped involucre.    On moist, dripping sandstone cliffs, Kentucky to Alabama. Often called the  \"Killarney fern,\" as it grows about the lakes of Killarney in Ireland.
