The town      child sees prostitutes in the street every day without      distinguishing them from other people. In the country he would      every day hear it stated in the crudest terms that such and such      a girl has been found at night in a barn or a ditch making love      with such and such a youth, or that the servant girl slips every      night into the coachman's bed, the facts of sexual intercourse,      pregnancy, and childbirth being spoken of in the plainest terms.      In towns the child's attention is solicited by a thousand      different objects; in the country, except fieldwork, which fails      to interest him, he hears only of the reproduction of animals and      the erotic exploits of girls and youths. When we say that the      urban environment is more exciting we are thinking of adults, but      the things which excite the adult have usually no erotic effect      on the child, who cannot, however, long remain asexual when he      sees the great peasant girls, as ardent as mares in heat,      abandoning themselves to the arms of robust youths. He cannot      fail to remark these frank manifestations of sexuality, though      the subtle and perverse refinements of the town would escape his      notice. I know that in the countries of exaggerated prudery there      is much hidden corruption, more, one is sometimes inclined to      think, than in less hypocritical countries. But I believe that      that is a false impression, and am persuaded that precisely      because of all these little concealments which excite the      malicious amusement of foreigners, there are really many more      young people in England who remain chaste than in the countries      which treat sexual relations more frankly. At all events, if I      have known Englishmen who were very debauched and very refined in      vice, I have also known young men of the same nation, over      twenty, who were as innocent as children, but never a young      Frenchman, Italian, or Spaniard of whom this could be said.\"      There is undoubtedly truth in this statement, though it must be      remembered that, excellent as chastity is, if it is based on mere      ignorance, its possessor is exposed to terrible dangers.    The question of sexual hygiene, more especially in its special aspect of  sexual enlightenment, is not, however, dependent on the fact that in some  children the psychic and nervous manifestation of sex appears at an  earlier age than in others. It rests upon the larger general fact that in  all children the activity of intelligence begins to work at a very early  age, and that this activity tends to manifest itself in an inquisitive  desire to know many elementary facts of life which are really dependent on  sex. The primary and most universal of these desires is the desire to know  where children come from. No question could be more natural; the question  of origins is necessarily a fundamental one in childish philosophies as,  in more ultimate shapes, it is in adult philosophies. Most children,  either guided by the statements, usually the misstatements, of their  elders, or by their own intelligence working amid such indications as are  open to them, are in possession of a theory of the origin of babies.        Stanley Hall (\"Contents of Children's Minds on Entering School,\"      _Pedagogical Seminary_, June, 1891) has collected some of the      beliefs of young children as to the origin of babies. \"God makes      babies in heaven, though the Holy Mother and even Santa Claus      make some. He lets them down and drops them, and the women or      doctors catch them, or He leaves them on the sidewalk, or brings      them down a wooden ladder backwards and pulls it up again, or      mamma or the doctor or the nurse go up and fetch them, sometimes      in a balloon, or they fly down and lose off their wings in some      place or other and forget it, and jump down to Jesus, who gives      them around. They were also often said to be found in      flour-barrels, and the flour sticks ever so long, you know, or      they grew in cabbages, or God puts them in water, perhaps in the      sewer, and the doctor gets them out and takes them to sick folks      that want them, or the milkman brings them early in the morning;      they are dug out of the ground, or bought at the baby store.\"        In England and America the inquisitive child is often told that      the baby was found in the garden, under a gooseberry bush or      elsewhere; or more commonly it is said, with what is doubtless      felt to be a nearer approach to the truth, that the doctor      brought it. In Germany the common story told to children is that      the stork brings the baby. Various theories, mostly based on      folk-lore, have been put forward to explain this story, but none      of them seem quite convincing (see, e.g., G. Herman,      \"Sexual-Mythen,\" _Geschlecht und Gesellschaft_, vol. i, Heft 5,      1906, p. 176, and P. Naecke, _Neurologische Centralblatt_, No. 17,      1907). Naecke thinks there is some plausibility in Professor      Petermann's suggestion that a frog writhing in a stork's bill      resembles a tiny human creature.        In Iceland, according to Max Bartels (\"Islaendischer Brauch und      Volksglaube,\" etc., _Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie_, 1900, Heft 2      and 3) we find a transition between the natural and the fanciful      in the stories told to children of the origin of babies (the      stork is here precluded, for it only extends to the southern      border of Scandinavian lands). In North Iceland it is said that      God made the baby and the mother bore it, and on that account is      now ill. In the northwest it is said that God made the baby and      gave it to the mother. Elsewhere it is said that God sent the      baby and the midwife brought it, the mother only being in bed to      be near the baby (which is seldom placed in a cradle). It is also      sometimes said that a lamb or a bird brought the baby. Again it      is said to have entered during the night through the window.      Sometimes, however, the child is told that the baby came out of      the mother's breasts, or from below her breasts, and that is why      she is not well.        Even when children learn that babies come out of the mother's      body this knowledge often remains very vague and inaccurate. It      very commonly happens, for instance, in all civilized countries      that the navel is regarded as the baby's point of exit from the      body. This is a natural conclusion, since the navel is seemingly      a channel into the body, and a channel for which there is no      obvious use, while the pudendal cleft would not suggest itself to      girls (and still less to boys) as the gate of birth, since it      already appears to be monopolized by the urinary excretion. This      belief concerning the navel is sometimes preserved through the      whole period of adolescence, especially in girls of the so-called      educated class, who are too well-bred to discuss the matter with      their married friends, and believe indeed that they are already      sufficiently well informed. At this age the belief may not be      altogether harmless, in so far as it leads to the real gate of      sex being left unguarded. In Elsass where girls commonly believe,      and are taught, that babies come through the navel, popular      folk-tales are current (_Anthropophyteia_, vol. iii, p. 89)      which represent the mistakes resulting from this belief as      leading to the loss of virginity.        Freud, who believes that children give little credit to the stork      fable and similar stories invented for their mystification, has      made an interesting psychological investigation into the real      theories which children themselves, as the result of observation      and thought, reach concerning the sexual facts of life (S. Freud,      \"Ueber Infantile Sexualtheorien,\" _Sexual-Probleme_, Dec., 1908).      Such theories, he remarks, correspond to the brilliant, but      defective hypotheses which primitive peoples arrive at concerning      the nature and origin of the world. There are three theories,      which, as Freud quite truly concludes, are very commonly formed      by children. The first, and the most widely disseminated, is that      there is no real anatomical difference between boys and girls; if      the boy notices that his little sister has no obvious penis he      even concludes that it is because she is too young, and the      little girl herself takes the same view. The fact that in early      life the clitoris is relatively larger and more penis-like helps      to confirm this view which Freud connects with the tendency in      later life to erotic dream of women furnished with a penis. This      theory, as Freud also remarks, favors the growth of homosexuality      when its germs are present. The second theory is the faecal theory      of the origin of babies. The child, who perhaps thinks his mother      has a penis, and is in any case ignorant of the vagina, concludes      that the baby is brought into the world by an action analogous to      the action of the bowels. The third theory, which is perhaps less      prevalent than the others, Freud terms the sadistic theory of      coitus. The child realizes that his father must have taken some      sort of part in his production. The theory that sexual      intercourse consists in violence has in it a trace of truth, but      seems to be arrived at rather obscurely. The child's own sexual      feelings are often aroused for the first time when wrestling or      struggling with a companion; he may see his mother, also,      resisting more or less playfully a sudden caress from his father,      and if a real quarrel takes place, the impression may be      fortified. As to what the state of marriage consists in, Freud"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13618"],[0,"The Cathedral Church of Peterborough (#14)"],[1," here to indicate some of the designs. Most  need little explanation, but a few are hard to understand. On the roof  may be seen the three lions of England, a cross between four martlets,  three crowns each pierced by an arrow, and another design. The smaller  designs include four-leaved flowers, Tudor roses, fleurs-de-lys, the  portcullis, some undescribable creatures, crossed keys, crossed swords,  crossed crosiers, crosses, crowns, crowns pierced with arrows, crowned  female heads, an eagle, the head of the Baptist in a charger, an angel,  mitres, three feathers rising from a crown, S. Andrew's cross, and  perhaps others. There are also some rebuses, and some lettering. On the  north wall, in six several squares, are the letters of the name Ashton  interwoven with scrolls; the letters AR before a church, and a bird on a  tun occur more than once. This certainly refers to Abbot Robert Kirton;  but what the bird means is not clear. In the moulding over the large  arch to the south choir aisle are four sets of letters. They form the  last verse of the psalter. The words are contracted: they stand for  _Omnis spiritus laudet Dominum_.    =The Transepts=, including the arch to the aisles, are of four bays,  and, as has before been pointed out, are of precisely the same character  as the work in the choir. The central piers here are octagonal. All  round the Norman portion of the church, below the windows, is an arcade  of round arches with simple round mouldings and plain cushion capitals:  in the transepts these have not intersecting heads, as in the choir and  nave. The western sides of the transepts have no proper triforium, but a  passage runs along in front of the windows in the triforium range. The  chapels to the east have Perpendicular screens. In the north transept  those three chapels were made into one which was used for early service,  and called the morning chapel. We read in the chapter records of a minor  canon being appointed to read the prayers at 6 o'clock, and once at  least the hour is named as 5 o'clock, in the morning. This chapel was  fitted up with some of the desks from the choir; and, judging from a  number of names and initials that had been cut upon the desks, it has  been conjectured that it was at one time used for the chapel of the  King's School. At the north end is a desk for the reader or readers made  out of two Early English stalls; there are three double shafts with  admirably carved wooden foliage in the capitals. A very fine little  Norman door leads to the staircase to the triforium. It should be  mentioned that in the triforium is arranged an excellent series of  stones, fragments, mouldings, and various ornaments, found in different  places during the recent restoration.    [Illustration: The New Building--Interior.]    The series of basins of Alwalton marble was found, during the recent  underpinning of the west front, in use as foundation stones; they appear  to be of late Norman date. One window in the north transept aisle and  all three in the south have fine geometrical tracery. The three chapels  in the south transept were used as vestries until a few years ago, when  the space beneath the bell-tower and part of the north aisle of the nave  was converted into a large vestry for both clergy and choir. In the  chapel here nearest the choir there remains the lower part of the newel  staircase which led to an upper chapel. On the west side of the south  transept has been erected a building which has in its time served many  different purposes. It can hardly be called an aisle, as there is only  access to the transept by a single ogee-headed doorway, which is a  Decorated insertion. This building is of late, almost transition, Norman  date; and is not very many years later than the transept itself. It can  be seen from the cloister court that it had originally three gables. The  roof is vaulted. In an inventory of goods made in 1539, printed in  Gunton, there is one chapel described as the \"Ostrie Chapel,\" which is  believed to refer to this building. In a plan drawn in Bishop Kennett's  time and dedicated to him, the south part is called \"The Hostry Chapel,  now the Chapter-House,\" and the north part is called the \"Chapel of St.  Sprite or the Holy Ghost.\" In some plans it is called the vestry. It has  also been employed as a muniment room, as a Chapter-house, and (as now)  as a practising room for the choir.    [Illustration: The Transepts, looking North.]    Near the south-western pier of the central tower access can be obtained  to what remains of the =Saxon Church=. It was when the foundations of  this pier were reached, in 1883, that the first indications of an  earlier building were brought to light. First a solid piece of wall was  discovered, and soon after a substantial piece of plaster attached to  the wall, running north and south, which has since proved to be the  eastern wall of the north transept of the Saxon Church. The workmen also  came upon a plaster floor, on which were remains of burnt wood, reddened  stone, and other evidences of a conflagration. As the work of excavation  proceeded at intervals, fresh discoveries were made. The walls of the  north transept, choir, and part of the south transept, can be traced.  Just outside the eastern wall can be seen portions of two Saxon tombs  which were originally in the grave-yard.    The width of both choir and transepts is about 23 feet. The choir was  not apsidal. The south wall of the south transept was just beyond the  wall of the existing building; the extreme east end was almost exactly  underneath the pillars in the present transept; the west wall of the  south transept of the Saxon church was under the practising room; the  nave extended into the cloister court. Near the south end of the  excavations was discovered a portion of a Saxon altar _in situ_. No  remains have been found of the nave (see plan, p. 9).    [Illustration: Evangelistic Symbols, from Lantern Tower Roof.]    The roofs of both transepts are flat, and, except where rotten boards  have been replaced, original. They are now uncoloured, but formerly were  painted in black and white diamond patterns. All the windows at the  north and south ends are Norman, with Perpendicular tracery.    [Illustration: Evangelistic Symbols, from Lantern Tower Roof.]    The lantern tower has a fine groined roof, carefully restored and well  painted. In the centre is a representation of the Saviour; eight  coloured shields have the emblems of the Passion; four have the  evangelistic symbols.    [Illustration: Boss from Lantern Tower Roof.]    =The Nave=, notwithstanding the years it took to build, the change of  architecture that was coming into use as it was being finished, and the  alteration in plan that was decided upon towards the end, is a very  complete and almost uniform structure. There are ten bays, all having  round arches; in the triforium each large arch has two smaller ones  beneath it; and in each bay of the clerestory is one high arch and two  smaller ones. The triforium arches in the two easternmost bays, on both  sides, have the hatchet ornamentation in the tympanum; this may either  mark the limits of the old Benedictine choir, or may simply suggest  earlier work. Almost the only indication of distinct later work, as we  proceed towards the west, is in the different forms of the bases of the  piers. The arcading of the aisles curiously changes towards the west in  both aisles, but not at corresponding points; the change consists in  the reversing the interlacing of the arches. The third pillars from the  west end on either side are not really, strictly speaking, pillars at  all. They were built as supports to two western towers which it was  intended certainly to erect at this point, even if they were not at  least in part built. There are many other little details in the  neighbourhood of these piers, all confirming Mr Paley's discovery with  respect to these contemplated towers, one at any rate of which he thinks  was actually erected. The pillars are cylindrical with numerous attached  shafts. In addition to the changed form of the bases, careful observers  can detect proofs of later work in the capitals of the shafts in the  triforium. In front of each pier a shaft rises to the roof; and on these  the original ceiling rested. On some of the piers in the south aisle,  near the west end, may be seen several very curious masons' marks. In  the nave is a very massive pulpit given in 1873 by the family of Dr  James, for forty years Canon, bearing an inscription to his memory. It  is from the design of Mr Edward Barry, and was meant to be in keeping  with the Norman architecture of the nave. The central shaft is of  Devonshire marble, the main body of the pulpit of red Dumfries stone,  and some of the smaller pillars are of green Greek marble. At the angles  are four large figures of the Evangelists. There is a wooden eagle  lectern, carved by the late Rev. R.S. Baker, behind the choir-stalls on  the south side.    [Illustration: The Nave, looking East.]    =The Nave Ceiling= is very curious and remarkable. If originally flat,  and supported on the tall shafts last mentioned, it would be just above  the great arch of the central tower before that was altered from the  round form. It is supposed that this was the case; and that when the  pointed arch was substituted the central compartment of the ceiling was  raised, and the two outer ones made to slope as we see it now. But if  the Norman roof was flat, its outer compartments would manifestly not be  broad enough to fill the space now occupied by the sloping sides. And  yet there is no alteration in the style of ornamentation: nor are the  diamonds, which are divided by the line where the slope joins the  horizontal portion, unduly elongated, as would seem to be necessary in  the part nearest the wall. Some change was clearly made when the  Decorated arches were built; for above the"]]]
