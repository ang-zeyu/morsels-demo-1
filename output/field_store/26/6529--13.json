Then the shout of McTee rang joyously: \"A ship!\"    \"The fire!\" answered Harrigan, and pointed back to the hill, for Kate  had allowed the flames to fall in their absence.    All thought of the battle left them. They started back on the run to  build high their signal light, and when they came to the top of the  hill, they found Kate lying as they had left her. She started to her  knees at the sound of their footsteps and stretched out her arms to  them.    \"God has sent you back to me!\"    \"A ship!\" thundered McTee for answer, and he flung a great armful of  wood upon the blaze. It rose with a rush, leaping and crackling, but  all three kept at their work until the pile of wood was higher than  their heads. Only when the supply of dry fuel was exhausted did they  pause to look out to sea. In place of the one eye of white there were  three lights, one of white, one of red, and one of green--the lights of  a ship running in toward land.    In a moment the moon slipped up above the eastern waters, and right  across that broad white circle moved a ship with the smoke streaming  back from her funnel. Unquestionably the captain had seen the signal  fire and understood its meaning.    They waited until the red light became fairly stationary, showing that  the steamer had been laid-to. Then they ran for the beach and took up  their position on the line between the glow of their fire and the  position of the ship, guessing that in this way they would be on the  spot where the ship's boat would be most likely to touch the shore.    \"McTee,\" said Harrigan, \"it may be half an hour before that boat  reaches the beach. Is there any reason why both of us should go aboard  it?\"    \"Harrigan, there is none! Stand up to me.\"    \"If you do this,\" broke in Kate, \"I will bring the sailors who come  ashore to the spot where the dead man lies, and I'll tell how he died.\"    They looked at her, knowing that she could be trusted to fulfill that  threat. The moon lay on the beauty of her face; never had she seemed so  desirable. They looked to each other, and each seemed doubly hateful to  the other.    \"Kate, dear,\" said Harrigan hastily, \"I see the boat come tossin' there  over the water. Speak out like a brave girl. Neither of us will leave  the other in peace as long as we have a hope of you. Choose between us  before we put a foot in that boat, and if you choose McTee, I'll give  you God's blessin' an' say no more nor ever raise my hand against ye.  McTee, will ye do the like?\"    \"For the sake of the day of the fight and the wreck I will. If she  chooses you now, I'll raise no hand against you.\"    A shout came faintly across the rush and ripple of the breakers.    \"Speak out,\" said Harrigan.    \"Hallo!\" she screamed in answer to the hail from the boat, and then  turning to them: \"I choose neither of you!\"    \"McTee,\" growled Harrigan, \"I'm thinkin' we've both been fools.\"    \"Think what you will, I'll have her; and if you cross me again, I'll  finish you, Harrigan.\"    \"McTee, ten of your like couldn't finish me. But look! There's the girl  wadin' out to the boat. Let's steady her through the waves.\"    They ran out and, catching her beneath the shoulders, bore her safe and  high through the small rollers. When they were waist-deep, the boat  swung near. A lantern was raised by the man in the bows, and under that  light they saw the four men at the oars, now backing water to keep  their boat from washing to the beach. The sailors cheered as the two  men swung Kate over the gunwale and then clambered in after her. The  man at the bows all this time had kept his lantern high above his head  with a rigid arm, and now he bellowed: \"Black McTee!\"    \"Right!\" said McTee. \"And you?\"    \"Salvain--put back for the ship, lads--Pietro Salvain. D'you mean to  say you've forgotten me?\"    \"Shanghai!\" said McTee, as light broke on his memory. \"What a night  that was.\"    \"But you--\"    \"The _Mary Rogers_ took a header for Davy Jones's locker; first mate  drunk and ran her on a reef; all hands went under except the three of  us; we drifted to this island.\"    \"Black McTee shipwrecked! By God, if we get to port with our old tramp,  I'll get a farm and stick to dry land.\"    \"Your ship?\"    \"The _Heron_, four thousand tons, White Henshaw, skipper.\"    \"White Henshaw?\" cried McTee in almost reverent tones.    \"The same. Old White still sticks to his wheel. He's as hard a man as  you, McTee, in his own way.\"    They were pulling close to the freighter by this time, and Salvain gave  quick orders to lay the boat alongside. In another moment they stood on  the deck, where a tall man in white clothes advanced to meet them.    \"Good fishing, sir,\" said Salvain. \"We've picked up three shipwrecked  people, with Angus McTee among them.\"    \"Black McTee!\" cried the other, and even in the dim light he picked out  the towering form of the Scotchman.    \"It took a wreck to bring us together, Captain Henshaw,\" said McTee,  \"but here we are, I've combed the South Seas for ten years for the sake  of meeting you.\"    \"H-m!\" grunted Henshaw. \"We'll drink on the strength of that. Come into  the cabin.\"    They trooped after him, Salvain and the three rescued, and stood in the  roomy cabin, the captain and the first mate dapper and cool in their  white uniforms, the other three marvelously ragged. Barefooted, their  hair falling in jags across their foreheads, their muscles bulging  through the rents in their shirts, McTee and Harrigan looked battered  but triumphant. Kate Malone might have been the prize which they had  safely carried away. She was even more ragged than her companions, and  now she withdrew into a shadowy corner of the cabin and shook the long,  loose masses of her hair about her shoulders.          CHAPTER 16      The dark eye of Pietro Salvain was quick to note her condition. He was  a rather small, lean-faced man with the skin drawn so tightly across  his high cheekbones that it glistened. He was emaciated; his energy  consumed him as hunger consumes other men.    \"There is a berth for me below,\" he said to Kate. \"You must take my  room. And I have a cap, some silk shirts, a loose coat which you might  wear--so?\"    \"This is Miss Malone, Salvain,\" said McTee before she could answer.    \"You are very kind, Mr. Salvain,\" she said.    He smiled and bowed very low, and then opened the door for her; but all  the while his glance was upon McTee, who stared at him so significantly  that before following Kate through the door, Salvain shrugged his  shoulders and made a gesture of resignation.    The captain turned to Harrigan. Henshaw was very old. He was always so  erect and carried his chin so high that the loose skin of his throat  hung in two sharp ridges. In spite of the tight-lipped mouth, the  beaklike nose, and the small, gleaming eyes, there was something about  his face which intensified his age. Perhaps it was the yellow skin, dry  as the parchment from an Egyptian tomb and criss-crossed by a myriad  little wrinkles.    \"And you, sir?\" he said to the Irishman.    \"One of my crew,\" broke in McTee carelessly. \"He'll be quite contented  in the forecastle. Eh, Harrigan?\"    \"Quite,\" said Harrigan, and his glance acknowledged the state of war.    \"Then if you'll go forward, Harrigan,\" said the captain, and his voice  was dry and dead as his skin--\"if you'll go forward and report to the  bos'n, he'll see that you have a bunk.\"    \"Thank you, sir,\" murmured Harrigan, and slipped from the room on his  bare feet.    \"That man,\" stated Henshaw, \"is as strong as you are, McTee, and yet  they call you the huskiest sailor of the South Seas.\"    \"He is almost as strong,\" answered McTee with a certain emphasis.    Something like a smile appeared in the eyes of Henshaw, but did not  disturb the fixed lines of his mouth. For a moment Henshaw and McTee  measured each other.    The Scotchman spoke first: \"Captain, you're as keen as the stories they  tell of you.\"    \"And you're as hard, McTee.\"    The latter waved the somewhat dubious compliment away.    \"I was breaking that fellow, and he held out longer than any man I've  ever handled. The shipwreck interrupted me, or I would have finished  what I started.\"    \"You'd like to have me finish what you began?\"    \"You read my mind.\"    \"Discipline is a great thing.\"    \"Absolutely necessary at sea.\"    Henshaw answered coldly: \"There's no need for us to act the hypocrite,  eh?\"    McTee hesitated, and then grinned: \"Not a bit. I know what you did  twenty years ago in the Solomons.\"    \"And I know the story of you and the pearl divers.\"    \"That's enough.\"    \"Quite.\"    \"And Harrigan?\"    \"As a favor to you, McTee, I'll break him. Maybe you'll be interested  in my methods.\"    \"Try mine first. I made him scrub down the bridge with suds every  morning, and while his hands were puffed and soft, I sent him down to  the fireroom to pass coal.\"    \"He'll kill you someday.\"    \"If he can.\"    They smiled strangely at each other.    A knock came at the door, and Salvain entered, radiant.    \"She is divine!\" he cried. \"Her hair is old copper with golden lights.  McTee, if she is yours, you have found another Venus!\"    \"If she is not mine,\" answered McTee, \"at least she belongs to no other  man.\"    Salvain studied him, first with eagerness, then with doubt, and last of  all with despair.    \"If any other man said that I would question it--so!--with my life. But  McTee? No, I love life too well!\"    \"Now,\" Henshaw said to Salvain, \"Captain McTee and I have business to  talk.\"    \"Aye, sir,\" said Salvain.    \"One minute, Salvain,\" broke in McTee. \"I haven't thanked you in the  girl's name for taking care of Miss Malone.\"    The first mate paused at the door.    \"I begin to wonder, captain,\" he answered, \"whether or not you have the  right to thank me in her name!\"    He disappeared through the door without waiting for an answer.    \"Salvain has forgotten"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9793"],[0,"Josephus (#13)"],[1,"were somewhat careless of the exact record of their  history, many of the Greek and Roman historians paid attention to it,  some specifically for the purpose of attacking them, others incidentally  in the course of their comprehensive works. The fashion of universal  history continued for some centuries, and works of fifty volumes and  over were more the rule than the exception. These \"elephantine books\"  were rendered possible because it was the fashion for each succeeding  historian to compile the results of his predecessor's labors, and adopt  it as part of his own monumental work. Distinguished among this school  of writers were Apollodorus of Athens, who in 150 B.C.E. wrote  Chronicles containing the most important events of general history down  to his own time, and Polybius, who was brought as a prisoner from Greece  to Rome in 145 B.C.E., and in his exile wrote a history of the rise of  the Roman Republic, in the course of which he dealt with the early  Jewish relations with Rome. Then, in the first century, there flourished  Posidonius of Apamea (90-50 B.C.E.), a Stoic and a bitter enemy of the  Jews, who continued the work of Polybius down to the year 90, and,  besides, wrote a separate diatribe against Judaism, which he regarded as  a misanthropic atheism. The succession was carried on by Timagenes of  Alexandria, who wrote a very full history of the second and the first  part of the first century.    Among Roman writers of the period that dealt with general affairs were  Asinius Pollio, the friend of Herod, and Titus Livius, who, under the  name of Livy, has become the standard Latin historian for schoolboys.  Josephus refers to both of them as well as to Timagenes, Posidonius, and  Polybius; but as there is no reason to think that he ever tried to  master the earlier authorities, it is probable that he knew them only so  far as they were reproduced in his immediate sources and his immediate  predecessors. The two writers whom he quotes repeatedly and must have  studied are Strabo of Amasea (in Pontus) and Nicholas of Damascus.  Strabo was an author of remarkable versatility and industry. Besides his  geography, the standard work of ancient times on the subject, he wrote  in forty-seven books a large historical work on the period between 150  (where Polybius ended) and 30 B.C.E. Nearly the whole of it has  disappeared, but we can tell from Josephus' excerpts that he appreciated  the Jews and their religion as did few other pagans of the time. He  dealt, too, at considerable length with the wars of the Hasmonean kings  against the Seleucids, and he is one of the authorities cited by  Josephus for the period between the accession of John Hyrcanus and the  overthrow of Antigonus II by Herod. The Jewish historian follows still  more closely, and in many places probably reproduces, Nicholas, who was  the court historian of Herod. Nicholas was a man of remarkable  versatility. He played many parts at Herod's court, as diplomatist,  advocate, and minister. He was a poet and philosopher of some repute,  and he wrote a general history in forty-four books. In the first eight  books he dealt with the early annals of the Assyrians, the Greeks, the  Medes, and the Persians. Josephus, who took him for his chief guide  after the Bible, often reproduces from him comparative passages to the  Scripture story which he is paraphrasing. And for the later period of  the _Antiquities_, from the time of Antiochus the Great (ab. 200  B.C.E.), he depends on him largely for the comparative Hellenistic  history, which he brings into relation with the story of the Hasmoneans.  When he comes to the epoch of Herod, the disproportionate fulness, the  vivacity, and the dramatic power of the narrative in books XIV-XVI of  the _Antiquities_ are due in a large measure to the historical virtues  of the court chronicler. We can tell how far this is the case by the  immediate and marked deterioration of the narrative when Josephus  proceeds to the reigns of Archelaus and Agrippa--where Nicholas failed  him.    Among Roman writers of his own day whom Josephus used was the Emperor  Vespasian himself, who, to record his exploits, wrote _Commentaries on  the Jewish War_, which were placed at his client's disposal.[1] In the  competition of flattery that greeted the new Flavian dynasty, various  Roman writers described and celebrated the Jewish campaigns.[2] Among  them were Antonius Julianus, who was on the staff of Vespasian and Titus  throughout the war, and at the end of it was appointed procurator of  Judea; Valerius Flaccus, who burst into ecstatic hexameters over the  burning of the Temple; and Tacitus, the most brilliant of all Latin  historians. Besides these writers' works, which have come down to us  more or less complete, a number of memoirs and histories of the war  appeared, some by those who wrote on hearsay, others by men who had  taken some part in the campaigns. It was an age of literary  dilettantism, when nearly everybody wrote books who knew how to write;  and in the drab monotony of Roman supremacy, the triumph over the Jews,  which had placed the Flavian house on the throne, was a happy  opportunity for ambitious authors.    [Footnote 1: Vita, 68.]    [Footnote 2: C. Ap. 9-10.]    It has been suggested that the Roman point of view that pervades the  _Wars_ of Josephus, the frequent absence of sympathy with the Jewish  cause, and the incongruous pagan ideas, which surprise us, can be  explained by the fact that the Jewish writer founded his account on that  of Antonius Julianus, which is referred to by the Christian apologist  Minucius[1] as a standard authority on the destruction of Jerusalem.  Antonius is mentioned by Josephus as one of the Roman staff who gave his  opinion in favor of the burning of the Temple, and he has also been  ingeniously identified with the Roman general (called [Hebrew: Otaninus]  or [Hebrew: Ananitus]) who engaged in controversy with Rabbi Johanan ben  Zakkai.[2] The evidence in favor of the theory is examined more fully  later; but whether or not the history of Antonius was the main source of  the _Wars_, it is certain that Josephus had before him Gentile accounts  of the struggle, and he often slavishly adopted not only their record of  facts but their expressions of opinion. In point of time Tacitus might  have derived from Josephus his summary of the Jewish Wars, part of which  has come down to us, and on some points the Jewish and the Roman authors  agree; but the correspondence is to be explained more readily by the use  of a common source by both writers. It is unlikely that the haughty  patrician, who hated and despised the Jews, and who had no love of  research, turned to a Jewish chronicle for his information, when he had  a number of Roman and Greek authors to provide him with food for his  epigrams.    [Footnote 1: Epist. ad Octav. 33.]    [Footnote 2: Yer. Sanhedrin, i. 4. Comp. Schlatter, Zur Topographie und  Geschichte Palaestinas, pp. 97_ff_.]    One other writer on contemporary Jewish history to whom Josephus refers  as an author, not indeed in the _Wars_, but in his _Life_, was Justus of  Tiberias, Unfortunately we have to depend almost entirely on a hostile  rival's spitefulness and malice for our knowledge of Justus. He did not  produce his work on the wars till after Josephus had established his  reputation, and part of his object, it is alleged, was to blacken the  character and destroy the repute of his rival. The conduct of Justus in  the Galilean campaign had been little more creditable than that of  Josephus--that is, if the latter's account may be believed at all. He  had been a leader of the Zealot party in Tiberias, and had roused the  people of that city against the double-dealing commander; but on the  breakdown of the revolt he entered the service of Agrippa II. He fell  into disgrace, but was pardoned. Some twenty-four years after the war  was over he wrote a History of the Jewish Kings and a History of the  War. It is difficult to form any judgment of the work, because, apart  from the abuse of Josephus, the criticism we have comes merely from  ecclesiastical historians, who imbibed Josephus' personal enmity as  though it were the pure milk of truth. Eusebius and Jerome[1] accuse him  of having distorted Jewish affairs to suit his personal ends and of  having been convicted by Josephus of falsehood. His chief crime in their  eyes and the reason for the disappearance of his work are that he did  not mention any of the events connected with the foundation of the  Christian Church, and had not the good fortune to be interpolated, as  Josephus was, with a passage about Jesus.[2] Hence Photius says that he  passed over many of the most important occurrences.[3] We know of him  now only by the charges of Josephus and a few disconnected fragments.    [Footnote 1: Hist. Eccl. III. x. 8; De Viris Illustr, 14.]    [Footnote 2: See below, pp. 241 ff.]    [Footnote 3: Bibl. Cod. 33.]    Coming now to the works of Josephus, his prefaces give a full account of  his historical motives. He originally wrote seven books on the Wars with  Rome in Aramaic for the benefit of his own countrymen. He was induced to  translate them into Greek because his predecessors had given false  accounts, either out of a desire to flatter the Romans or out of hatred  to the Jews. He claims that his own work is a true and careful narrative  of the events that he had witnessed with his own eyes and had special  opportunities of studying accurately. \"The writings of my predecessors  contain sometimes slanders, sometimes eulogies, but nowhere the accurate  truth of the facts.\" He goes on to complain of the way in which they  belittle the action of the Jews in order to aggrandize the Romans, which  defeats its own purpose; and he contrasts the merit of one who composes  by his own industry a history of events not hitherto faithfully  recorded, with the more popular and the easier fashion of"]]]
