'That we shall vanquish him,' replied the Goose; 'for he disregards, as  I learn, the counsel of that great statesman, the Vulture Far-sight; and  the wise have said--        'Merciless, or money-loving, deaf to counsel, false of faith,      Thoughtless, spiritless, or careless, changing course with every              breath,      Or the man who scorns his rival--if a prince should choose a foe,      Ripe for meeting and defeating, certes he would choose him so.    He is marching without due preparation; let us send the Paddy-bird at  the head of a force and attack him on his march.\"    Accordingly the Paddy-bird, setting out with a force of water-fowl, fell  upon the host of the Peacock-king, and did immense execution.  Disheartened thereat, King Jewel-plume summoned Far-sight, his Minister,  and acknowledged to him his precipitation.    'Wherefore do you abandon us, my father?' he said. 'Correct for us what  has been done amiss.    'My Liege,' replied the Vulture, 'it has been well observed--        'By the valorous and unskilful great achievements are not wrought;      Courage, led by careful Prudence, unto highest ends is brought.'    You have set Strength in the seat of Counsel, your Majesty, and he hath  clumsily spoiled your plans. How indeed could it fall otherwise? for--        'Grief kills gladness, winter summer, midnight-gloom the light of day,      Kindnesses ingratitude, and pleasant friends drive pain away;      Each ends each, but none of other surer conquerors can be      Than Impolicy of Fortune--of Misfortune Policy.'    I have said to myself, 'My Prince's understanding is affected--how else  would he obscure the moonlight of policy with the night-vapors of talk;'  in such a mood I cannot help him--        'Wisdom answers all who ask her, but a fool she cannot aid;      Blind men in the faithful mirror see not their reflection made.'    And therefore I have been absent.'    'My father!' said the King, joining his palms in respect, 'mine is all  the fault! Pardon it, and instruct me how to withdraw my army without  further loss.'    Then the Vulture's anger melted, and he reflected--        'Where the Gods are, or thy Guru--in the face of Pain and Age,      Cattle, Brahmans, Kings, and Children--reverently curb thy rage.'    And with a benignant smile, he answered the King thus, 'Be of good  heart, my Liege; thou shalt not only bring the host back safely, but  thou shalt first destroy the castle of King Silver-sides.'    'How can that be, with my diminished forces?' asked the Rajah.    'It will come to pass!' answered the Vulture. 'Break up to-day for the  blockade of the fort.'    Now, when this was reported by the spies to King Silver-sides, he was  greatly alarmed. 'Good Goose!' said he, 'what is to be done? Here is the  King of the Peacocks at hand, to blockade us--by his Minister's advice,  too.'    'Sire,' replied the Goose, 'separate the efficient and the inefficient  in your force; and stimulate the loyalty of the first, with a royal  bounty of gold and dresses, as each may seem to merit. Now is the time  for it--        'Oh, my Prince! on eight occasions prodigality is none--      In the solemn sacrificing, at the wedding of a son,      When the glittering treasure given makes the proud invader bleed,      Or its lustre bringeth comfort to the people in their need,      Or when kinsmen are to succor, or a worthy work to end,      Or to do a mistress honor, or to welcome back a friend.'    'But is this expenditure needed?' said the King.    'It is needed, my Liege,' said the Goose, 'and it befits a Monarch;  for--        'Truth, munificence, and valor, are the virtues of a King;      Royalty, devoid of either, sinks to a rejected thing.'    'Let it be incurred then!' replied the King.    At this moment Night-cloud, the Crow, made his appearance. 'Deign me one  regard, Sire,' said he, 'the insolent enemy is at our gates; let your  Majesty give the word, and I will go forth and show my valor and  devotion to your Crown.'    'It were better to keep our cover,' said the Goose. 'Wherefore else  builded we this fortalice? Is it not said?--        'Hold thy vantage!--alligators on the land make none afraid;      And the lion's but a jackal that hath left his forest-shade.'    But go, your Majesty, and encourage our warriors.\" Thereupon they  repaired to the Gateway of the Fort, and all day the battle raged there.    It was the morning after, when King Jewel-plume spake thus to his  Minister the Vulture--'Good sir, shall thy promise be kept to us?'    'It shall be kept, your Majesty,' replied the Vulture; 'storm the fort!'    'We will storm it!' said the Peacock-king. The sun was not well-risen  accordingly when the attack was made, and there arose hot fighting at  all the four gates. It was then that the traitorous Crows, headed by  their Monarch, Night-cloud, put fire to every dwelling in the citadel,  and raised a shout of 'The Fort is taken! it is taken!' At this terrible  sound the soldiers of the Swan-king forsook their posts, and plunged  into the pool.    Not thus King Silver-sides:--retiring coolly before the foe, with his  General the Paddy-bird, he was cut off and encircled by the troopers of  King Jewel-plume, under the command of his Marshal, the Cock.    'My General,' said the King, 'thou shalt not perish for me. Fly! I can  go no farther. Fly! I bid thee, and take counsel with the Goose that  Crest-jewel, my son, be named King!'    'Good my Lord,' replied the Paddy-bird, 'speak not thus! Let your  Majesty reign victorious while the sun and moon endure. I am governor of  your Majesty's fortress, and if the enemy enter it he shall but do so  over my body; let me die for thee, my Master!--        'Gentle, generous, and discerning; such a Prince the Gods do give!'    'That shalt thou not,' replied the Rajah--        'Skilful, honest, and true-hearted; where doth such a Vassal live?'    'Nay! my royal Lord, escape!' cried the Paddy-bird; a king's life is the  life of his people--        'The people are the lotus-leaves, their monarch is the sun--      When he doth sink beneath the waves they vanish every one.        When he doth rise they rise again with bud and blossom rife,      To bask awhile in his warm smile, who is their lord and life.'    'Think no more of me.' At this instant the Cock rushing forward,  inflicted a wound with his sharp spurs on the person of the King; but  the Paddy-bird sprang in front of him, and receiving on his body the  blows designed for the Rajah, forced him away into the pool. Then  turning upon the Cock, he despatched him with a shower of blows from his  long bill; and finally succumbed, fighting in the midst of his enemies.  Thus the King of the Peacocks captured the fortress; and marched home  with all the treasure in it, amid songs of victory.    Then spake the Princes: \"In that army of the Swans there was no soldier  like the Paddy-bird, who gave his own life for the King's.\"    \"There be nowhere many such,\" replied Vishnu-Sarman; \"for        'All the cows bring forth are cattle--only now and then is born      An authentic lord of pastures, with his shoulder-scratching horn.'[20]    \"It is well spoken,\" said the Princes.    \"But for him that dares to die so,\" added the Sage, \"may an eternal  heaven be reserved, and may the lustrous Angels of Paradise, the  Apsaras, conduct him thither! Is it not so declared, indeed?--        'When the soldier in the battle lays his life down for his king,      Unto Swerga's perfect glory such a deed his soul shall bring.'    \"It is so declared,\" said the Rajah's sons.    \"And now, my Princes,\" concluded Vishnu-Sarman, \"you have listened to  'War.'\"    \"We have listened, and are gratified,\" replied the sons of the King.    \"Let me end then,\" said their Preceptor, \"with this--          'If the clouds of Battle lower        When ye come into your power,        Durga grant the foes that dare you        Bring no elephants to scare you;        Nor the thunderous rush of horses,        Nor the footmen's steel-fringed forces:      But overblown by Policy's strong breath,      Hide they in caverns from the avenging death.'      [16] The peacock is wild in most Indian jungles. The swan is a species  of flamingo of a white color. The voice and gait of a beautiful woman  are likened by the Hindoo poets to those of the swan.    [17] By such a death as that alluded to, she earns the title of Sati,  the \"excellent.\"    [18] The common Indian crane; a graceful white bird, seen everywhere in  the interior of Hindoostan.    [19] A man of military caste.    [20] Large branching horns which reach backward and rub upon his  shoulders.          PEACE      When the time came for resuming instruction, the King's sons said to  Vishnu-Sarman, \"Master, we have heard of War, we would now learn  somewhat of the treaties which follow war.\" \"It is well asked,\" replied  the Sage; \"listen therefore to 'Peace,' which hath this commencement--        'When those great Kings their weary war did cease,      The Vulture and the Goose concluded Peace.'    'How came that?' asked the Princes.    Vishnu-Sarman related:--      THE TREATY BETWEEN THE PEACOCKS AND THE SWANS    \"So soon as King Jewel-plume had retreated, the first care of King  Silver-sides was the discovery of the treason that had cost him the  fort.    'Goose,' he said to his Minister, 'who put the fire to our citadel,  think you? Was it an enemy or an inmate?'    'Sire,' replied the Goose, 'Night-cloud and his followers are nowhere to  be seen--it must needs be his work.'    'It must needs be,' sighed the King, after a pause; 'but what  ill-fortune!'    'If it please your Majesty, no,' replied the Minister; 'it is written--        \"'Tis the fool who, meeting trouble, straightway destiny reviles;      Knowing not his own misdoing brought his own mischance the whiles.\"    You have forgotten the saying--        'Who listens not, when true friends counsel well,      Must fall, as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13272"],[0,"Beethoven's Letters 1790-1826, Volume 2 (#14)"],[1," be very  annoying to be brought into court; indeed, I would not be so for the whole  world. My brother's conduct is quite worthy of him. The tailor is appointed  to come to-day, still I hope to be able to get rid of him for the present  by a few polite phrases.      319.    TO HERR KIND.    DEAR KIND,--    I intend to call on you at latest on Wednesday afternoon at four o'clock,  when I will settle everything.    Your obedient    BEETHOVEN.      320.    TO CHERUBINI.[1]    March 15, 1823.    HIGHLY ESTEEMED SIR,--    I joyfully take advantage of this opportunity to address you. I have done  so frequently in spirit, as I prize your theatrical works beyond others.  The artistic world has only to lament that, in Germany at least, no new  dramatic piece of yours has appeared. Highly as all your works are valued  by true connoisseurs, still it is a great loss to art not to possess any  fresh production of your great genius for the theatre.    True art is imperishable, and the true artist feels heartfelt pleasure in  grand works of genius, and that is what enchants me when I hear a new  composition of yours; in fact, I take greater interest in it than in my  own; in short, I love and honor you. Were it not that my continued bad  health prevents my going to see you in Paris, with what exceeding delight  would I discuss questions of art with you! Do not think that this is merely  intended to serve as an introduction to the favor I am about to ask of you.  I hope and feel convinced that you do not for a moment suspect me of such  base sentiments.    I recently completed a grand solemn mass, and have resolved to offer it to  the various European courts, as it is not my intention to publish it at  present. I have therefore solicited the King of France, through the French  embassy here, to subscribe to this work, and I feel certain that his  Majesty would, at your recommendation, agree to do so. _Ma situation  critique demande que je ne fixe pas seulement, comme ordinnaire, mes voeux  au ciel; au contraire, il faut les fixer aussi_ [\"_aussi_\" in Beethoven's  hand] _en bas pour les necessites de la vie._ Whatever may be the fate of  my request to you, I shall forever continue to love and esteem you, _et  vous resterez toujours celui de mes contemporains que je l'estime le plus.  Si vous me voulez faire un extreme plaisir, c'etait si vous m'ecrivez  quelques lignes, ce que me soulagera bien. L'art unit tout le monde_, how  much more, then, true artists, _et peut-etre vous me dignez aussi_ to  include me in that number. _Avec le plus haut estime_,    _Votre ami et serviteur_,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Cherubini declared that he never received this letter.]      321.    TO SCHINDLER.[1]    DEAR SCHINDLER,--    I am not sure whether the other copy was corrected or not, so I send you  this one instead. As to N. in S----, I beg you not to say a word; Bl. is  already very uneasy on the subject. In haste, your friend,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: We cannot understand what induced Beethoven, who lived in the  same house with Schindler, to write to him; but he often did so to persons  with whom he could easily have spoken, partly in order to get rid of the  matter while it was in his thoughts, and also because he was a great deal  from home; that is, going backwards and forwards from one lodging to  another, having often several at the same time.]      322.    TO HERR PETERS,--LEIPZIG.    Vienna, March 20, 1823.    The other three marches are only to be sent off to-day, as I missed the  post last week. Irregular as I have been on this occasion in our  transactions, you would not think me so culpable if you were here, and  aware of my position, a description of which would be too tedious both for  you and me.    I have now an observation to make with regard to what I have sent off to  you.    Several sets of wind instruments may combine in the performance of the  Grand March, and if this cannot be done, and a regimental band is not  strong enough for its present arrangement, any bandmaster can easily adapt  it by omitting some of the parts.    You can, no doubt, find some one in Leipzig to show you how this can be  managed with a smaller number, although I should regret if it were not to  appear engraved exactly as it is written.    You must forgive the numerous corrections in the works I send; my old  copyist no longer sees distinctly, and the younger one has yet to be  trained, but at all events there are no errors left.    It is impossible for me to comply at once with your request for a stringed  and a pianoforte quartet, but if you will write to me fixing the time you  wish to have both works, I will do what I can to complete them. I must,  however, apprise you that I cannot accept less than 50 ducats for a  stringed quartet, and 70 for a pianoforte one, without incurring loss;  indeed, I have repeatedly been offered more than 50 ducats for a violin  quartet. I am, however, always unwilling to ask more than necessary, so I  adhere to the sum of 50 ducats, which is, in fact, nowadays the usual  price.    The other commission is indeed an uncommon one, and I, of course, accept  it, only I must beg you to let me know soon when it is required; otherwise,  willing as I am to give you the preference, I might find it almost  impossible to do so. You know I wrote to you formerly that quartets were  precisely what had risen most in value, which makes me feel positively  ashamed when I have to ask a price for a _really great work_. Still, such  is my position that it obliges me to secure every possible advantage. It is  very different, however, with the work itself; when I never, thank God,  think of _profit_, but solely of _how I write it_. It so happens that two  others besides yourself wish to have a mass of mine, and I am quite  disposed to write at least three. The first has long been finished, the  second not yet so, and the third not even begun. But in reference to  yourself, I must have a certainty, that I may in any event be secure.    More of this next time I write; do not remit the money, at any rate till  you hear from me that the work is ready to be sent off.    I must now conclude. I hope your distress is, by this time, in some degree  alleviated.    Your friend,    BEETHOVEN.      323.    TO ZELTER.    Vienna, March 25, 1823.    SIR,--    I avail myself of the present opportunity to send you my best wishes. The  bearer of this asked me to recommend her to you; her name is Cornega; she  has a fine _mezzo soprano_, and is a very artistic singer, and has,  moreover, been favorably received in several operas.    I have also specially considered your proposals about your Academy for  Singing. If the Mass is ever published, I will send you a copy free of all  charge. There is no doubt that it might be almost entirely executed _a la  capella_; in which case, however, the work would have to be arranged  accordingly; perhaps you have patience to do this. Besides, there is  already a movement in the work quite _a la capella_, and that style may be  specially termed the true church style. Thanks for your wish to be of  service to me, but never would I accept anything whatever from so highly  esteemed an artist as yourself. I honor you, and only wish I could have an  opportunity to prove this by my actions.    I am, with high consideration,    Your friend and servant,    BEETHOVEN.      324.    TO HIS IMPERIAL HIGHNESS THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    The Spring of 1823.    YOUR IMPERIAL HIGHNESS,--    It must still be some days before I can wait on you again, as I am in the  greatest hurry to send off the works that I named to your R.H. yesterday,  for if they are not punctually dispatched, I might lose all profit. Your  R.H. can easily understand how much time is occupied in getting copies  made, and looking through every part; indeed, it would not be easy to find  a more troublesome task. Your R.H. will, I am sure, gladly dispense with my  detailing all the toil caused by this kind of thing, but I am compelled to  allude to it candidly, though only in so far as is absolutely necessary to  prevent your R.H. being misled with regard to me, knowing, alas! only too  well what efforts are made to _prejudice your R.H. against_ me. But time  will prove that I have been in all respects most faithful and attached to  your R.H., and if my position were only as great as my zeal to serve your  R.H., no happier man than myself would exist.    I am your R.H.'s faithful and obedient servant,    BEETHOVEN.      325.    TO SCHINDLER.    _Imprimis._--Papageno, not a word of what I said about Prussia. No reliance  is to be placed on it; Martin Luther's table-talk alone can be compared to  it. I earnestly beg my brother also not to remove the padlock from his  lips, and not to allow anything to transpire beyond the  Selchwurst-Gasse.[1]    _Finis._--Inquire of that arch-churl Diabelli when the French copy of the  Sonata in C minor [Op. 111] is to be published. I stipulated to have five  copies for myself, one of which is to be on fine paper, for the Cardinal  [the Archduke Rudolph]. If he attempts any of his usual impertinence on  this subject, I will sing him in person a bass aria in his warehouse which  shall cause it and all the street (Graben) to ring![2]    [Footnote 1: Schindler relates: \"The royal decision (to subscribe for a  copy of the mass) was brought to Beethoven by the Chancellor of the  Embassy, Hofrath Wernhard. Whether Prince Hatzfeld [the Ambassador] made  the following offer from his own impulse, or in consequence of a commission  from Berlin, is not known. At all events, the Hofrath put this question in  the name of the prince to the great composer, 'Whether he would be disposed  to prefer a royal order to the fifty ducats' [the sum demanded for the  mass]. Beethoven replied at once, 'The fifty ducats.' Scarcely had the  Chancellor left the room when Beethoven, in considerable excitement,  indulged in all kinds of sarcastic remarks"]]]
