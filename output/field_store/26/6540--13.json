A dull patter on the window--if one sits unbuttoned on the hearth--gives  a zest to a languid chapter. The rattle of a storm--if only the room be  snug--fixes the attention fast. Therefore, let the rain descend as though  the heavens rehearsed for a flood! Let a tempest come out of the west! Let  the chimney roar as it were a lion! And if there must be a clearing, let  it hold off until the late afternoon, lest it sow too early a distaste for  indoors and reading! There is scarcely a bookworm who will not slip his  glasses off his nose, if the clouds break at the hour of sunset when the  earth and sky are filled with a green and golden light. I took the book off  the library shelf and timidly glancing across my shoulder for fear that  some one might catch me, I looked along the pages. There was a thumb mark  in a margin, and presently appeared a kindly stickiness on the paper as  though an orange had squirted on it. Surely there had been a human being  hereabouts. It was as certain as when Crusoe found the footprints in the  sand. Ah, I thought, this fellow who sits in the firelight has caught an  appetite. Perhaps he bit a hole and sucked the fruit, and the skin has  burst behind. Or I wave the theory and now conceive that the volume was  read at breakfast. If so, it is my comfort that in those dim hours it stood  propped against his coffee cup.    But the trail ended with the turning of the page. There were, indeed,  further on, pencil checks against one of the paragraphs as if here the book  had raised a faint excitement, but I could not tell whether they sprang  up in derision or in approval. Toward the end there were uncut leaves, as  though even my single reader had failed in his persistence.    Being swept once beyond a usual caution, I lamented to my friend F---- of  the neglect in which readers held me, to which the above experience in  a library was a rare exception. F---- offered me such consolation as he  could, deplored the general taste and the decadence of the times, and said  that as praise was sweet to everyone, he, as far as he himself was able,  offered it anonymously to those who merited it. He was standing recently  in a picture gallery, when a long-haired man who stood before one of the  pictures was pointed out to him as the artist who had painted it. At once  F---- saw his opportunity to confer a pleasure, but as there is a touch of  humor in him, he first played off a jest. Lounging forward, he dropped his  head to one side as artistic folk do when they look at color. He made a  knot-hole of his fingers and squinted through. Next he retreated across the  room and stood with his legs apart in the very attitude of wisdom. He cast  a stern eye upon the picture and gravely tapped his chin. At last when the  artist was fretted to an extremity, F---- came forward and so cordially  praised the picture that the artist, being now warmed and comforted,  presently excused himself in a high excitement and rushed away to start  another picture while the pleasant spell was on him.    Had I been the artist, I would have run from either F----'s praise or  disapproval. As an instance, I saw a friend on a late occasion coming from  a bookstore with a volume of suspicious color beneath his arm. I had been  avoiding that particular bookstore for a week because my book lay for sale  on a forward table. And now when my friend appeared, a sudden panic seized  me and I plunged into the first doorway to escape. I found myself facing a  soda fountain. For a moment, in my blur, I could not account for the  soda fountain, or know quite how it had come into my life. Presently an  interne--for he was jacketted as if he walked a hospital--asked me what I'd  have.    Still somewhat dazed, in my discomposure, having no answer ready, my  startled fancy ran among the signs and labels of the counter until I  recalled that a bearded man once, unblushing in my presence, had ordered  a banana flip. I got the fellow's ear and named it softly. Whereupon he  placed a dead-looking banana across a mound of ice-cream, poured on colored  juices as though to mark the fatal wound and offered it to me. I ate a few  bites of the sickish mixture until the streets were safe.    I do not know to what I can attribute my timidity. Possibly it arises from  the fact that until recently my writing met with uniform rejection and  failure. For years I wrote secretly in order that few persons might know  how miserably I failed. I answered upon a question that I had given up the  practice, that I now had no time for it, that I scribbled now and then  but always burned it. All that while I gave my rare leisure and my stolen  afternoons--the hours that other men give to golf and sleep and sitting  together--these hours I gave to writing. On a holiday I was at it early. On  Saturday when other folks were abroad, I sat at my desk. It was my grief  that I was so poor a borrower of the night that I blinked stupidly on my  papers if I sat beyond the usual hour. Writing was my obsession. I need no  pity for my failures, for although I tossed my cap upon a rare acceptance,  my deeper joy was in the writing. That joy repeated failures could not  blunt.    There are paragraphs that now lie yellow in my desk with their former  meaning faded, that still recall as I think of them the first exaltation  when I wrote them--feverishly in a hot emotion. In those days I thought  that I had caught the sunlight on my pen, and the wind and the moon and the  spinning earth. I thought that the valleys and the mountains arose from the  mist obedient to me. If I splashed my pen, in my warm regard it was the  roar and fury of the sea. It was really no more than my youth crying out.  And, alas, my thoughts and my feelings escaped me when I tried to put them  down on paper, although I did not know it then. Perhaps they were too  vagrant to be held. And yet these paragraphs that might be mournful records  of failure, fill me with no more than a tender recollection for the boy  who wrote them. The worn phrases now beg their way with broken steps. Like  shrill and piping minstrels they whine and crack a melody that I still  remember in its freshness.    But perhaps, reader, we are brothers in these regards. Perhaps you, too,  have faded papers. Or possibly, even on a recent date, you sighed your soul  into an essay or a sonnet, and you now have manuscript which you would like  to sell. Do not mistake me! I am not an editor, nor am I an agent for these  wares. Rather I speak as a friend who, having many such hidden sorrows,  offers you a word of comfort. To a desponding Hamlet I exclaim, \"'Tis  common, my Lord.\" I have so many friends that have had an unproductive  fling toward letters, that I think the malady is general. So many books are  published and flourish a little while in their bright wrappers, but yours  and theirs and mine waste away in a single precious copy.    I am convinced that a close inspection of all desks--a federal matter as  though Capital were under fire--would betray thousands of abandoned novels.  There may be a few stern desks that are so cluttered with price-sheets and  stock-lists that they cannot offer harborage to a love tale. Standing desks  in particular, such as bookkeepers affect, are not always chinked  with these softer plots. And rarely there is a desk so smothered in  learning--reeking so of scholarship--as not to admit a lighter nook for  the tucking of a sea yarn. Even so, it was whispered to me lately that  Professor B----, whose word shakes the continent, holds in a lower drawer  no fewer than three unpublished historical novels, each set up with a full  quota of smugglers and red bandits. One of these stories deals scandalously  with the abduction of an heiress, but this must be held in confidence. The  professor is a stoic before his class, but there's blood in the fellow.    There is, therefore, little use in your own denial. You will recall that  once, when taken to a ruined castle, you brooded on the dungeons until a  plot popped into your head. You crammed it with quaint phrasing from the  chroniclers. You stuffed it with soldiers' oaths. \"What ho! landlord,\"  you wrote gayly at midnight, \"a foaming cup, good sir. God pity the poor  sailors that take the sea this night!\" And on you pelted with your plot to  such conflicts and hair-breadth escapes as lay in your contrivance.    These things you have committed. Good sir, we are of a common piece. Let us  salute as brothers! And therefore, as to a comrade, I bid you continue in  your ways. And that you may not lack matter for your pen, I warmly urge  you, when by shrewdest computation you have exhausted the plots of  adventure and have worn your villains thin, that you proceed in quieter  vein. I urge you to an April mood, for the winds of Spring are up and  daffodils nod across the garden. There is black earth in the Spring and  green hilltops, and there is also the breath of flowers along the fences  and the sound of water for your pen to prattle of.          A Plague of All Cowards      Having written lately against the dog, several acquaintances have asked me  to turn upon the cat, and they have been good enough to furnish me with  instances of her faithlessness. Also, a lady with whom I recently sat at  dinner, inquired of me on the passing of the fish, whether I had ever  properly considered the cow, which she esteemed a most mischievous animal.  One of them had mooed at her as she crossed a pasture and she had hastily  climbed a fence. I get a good many suggestions first and last. I was once  taken to a Turkish bath for no other reason--as I was afterwards told--than  that it might supply me with a topic. Odd books have been put in my way.  A basket of school readers was once lodged with me, with a request that I  direct my attention to the absurd selection of the poems. I have been urged  to go against car conductors and customs men. On one occasion I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10027"],[0,"The Triple Alliance, Its Trials and Triumphs (#14)"],[1,"persons who are ever  ready to help the former over the latter, and our three friends were  fortunate enough to fall in with one of these philanthropic individuals  soon after their arrival.    The stranger, who was a youngster of about their own age, with a  pleasant, good-natured-looking face, patted Diggory on the back in a  fatherly manner, and addressing the group said,--    \"Well, my boys, we're a large family at Ronleigh, but fresh additions  are always welcome.  How did you leave them all at home?  Quite well,  I hope?  Um, ah! Just so.  That's what Dr. Denson always says,\"  continued the speaker, without waiting for any reply to his numerous  questions.  \"You'll have to go and see him after tea.  My name's Carton;  what's yours?\"    The three comrades introduced themselves.    \"What bedroom are you in?\"    \"Number 16.\"    \"Then you're in the same one as I and young Hart.  Come for a stroll,  and I'll show you round the place.\"    With Carton acting as conductor, the party set out on a tour of  inspection.  It was some time before the new-comers could find their way  about alone without turning down wrong passages, or encroaching on  forbidden ground, and getting shouted at by irate seniors, and ordered  to \"Come out of that!\"  But by the time they had finished their round,  and the clanging of a big bell summoned them to assemble in the  dining-hall for tea, they had been able to form a general idea as to the  geography of Ronleigh College, and a brief account of their discoveries  will be of interest to the reader.    Passing through the central archway in the block of buildings which  faced the road, the boys found themselves in a large gravelled  quadrangle surrounded on all sides by high walls, broken by what  appeared at first sight to be an almost countless number of windows,  while the red brick was relieved in many places by a thick growth of  ivy.    \"That's the gymnasium on the left,\" said Carton, \"and above it are  studies; and that row of big windows on the right, with the coloured  glass in the top, is the big schoolroom.\"    Crossing the gravel they passed through another archway, in which were  two folding-doors, and emerged upon an open space covered with asphalt,  upon which stood a giant-stride and two double fives-courts.    This formed but a small corner of a large level field, in which a number  of boys were to be seen wandering about arm in arm, or standing chatting  together in small groups, pausing every now and then in their  conversation to give chase to a football which was being kicked about in  an aimless fashion by a number of their more energetic companions.    \"The goal-posts aren't up yet,\" said Carton, \"and this is only what's  called the junior field; the one beyond is where the big fellows play.  The pavilion is over the hedge there, with the flagstaff by the side  of it.  That's the match ground, and there's room for another game  besides.\"    \"Where do all the fellows go when they aren't out of doors?\" asked  Diggory.    \"Well, the Sixth all have studies; then comes Remove, and those chaps  have a room to themselves; all the rest have desks in the big school,  and you hang about there, though of course, if you like, there's the  gymnasium, or the box-room--that's where a lot of fellows spend most of  their time.\"    \"What sort of a place is that?\"    \"Oh, it's where the play-boxes are kept.  Come along; we'll go there  next.\"    They passed once more through the double doors, and were crossing the  quadrangle, when a certain incident attracted their notice, unimportant  in itself, but indicating a strong contrast in the manner of life at  Ronleigh to what they had always been accustomed to at The Birches.  A youngster was tearing up a piece of paper and scattering the fragments  about on the gravel.    \"Hi, you there!\" cried a voice; \"pick that up.  What d'you mean by  making that mess here?\"    The small boy grabbed up the bits of paper, stuffed them in his pocket,  and hurried away towards the schoolroom.    \"Is that one of the masters?\" asked Mugford.    \"No,\" answered Carton, \"that's Oaks; he's one of the prefects.  Don't you see he's got a blue tassel to his mortar-board?\"    \"But what's a prefect?\"    \"Whew!\" laughed the other, \"you'll soon find out if you play the fool,  and don't mind what you're about.  Why, there are fourteen of them, all  fellows in the Sixth, and they keep order and give you lines, and all  that sort of thing.\"    \"Why, I thought it was only masters did that,\" said Jack Vance.    \"Well, you'll find the prefects do it here,\" answered Carton; \"and when  they tell you to do a thing, I'd advise you to look alive and do it, for  they don't reckon to speak twice.\"    The evening passed quickly enough.  After tea came an interview with the  head-master in his study, and then what was perhaps a still more trying  ordeal--a long spell of sitting in the big schoolroom answering an  incessant fire of questions such as, \"What's your name?\"--\"Where d'you  come from?\" etc., etc.    At length the signal was given for passing on to bed, and the Triple  Alliance were not sorry to gain the shelter of No. 16 dormitory.    The room contained seven other beds besides their own, two of which were  as yet still vacant, waiting the arrival of boys who had not turned up  on the first day.  The remainder were occupied by a couple of other  new-comers, and three oldsters, Carton, Hart, and Bayley.    It was very different from the cosy little bedrooms at The Birches; but  the three friends were glad to be allowed to undress in peace and quiet,  and had scrambled safely into bed some time before the prefect put in an  appearance to turn out the light.    \"I tell you what,\" said Hart, a few moments later: \"you new kids may  think yourselves lucky that you're in a quiet room for a start.  I know  when I came first there used to be christenings and all kinds of  humbug.\"    \"What was that?\" asked Diggory.    \"Why, fellows used always to christen you with a nickname: they stuck  your head in a basin and poured water over you, and if you struggled you  got it all down your back.\"    \"Yes,\" continued Carton, \"and they hid your clothes, and had bull-fights  and all sorts of foolery.  That was in _Nineteen_: old 'Thirsty' was the  prefect for that passage, and he doesn't care tu'pence what fellows do.  But Allingford's put a stop to almost all that kind of thing: he's  captain of the school, and he's always awfully down on anything of that  sort.\"    By the time breakfast was over on the following morning, Diggory and his  two companions were beginning to recover a little from their first state  of bewilderment amid their strange surroundings.  They donned the school  cap of black flannel, with the crest worked in silk upon the front, and  went out to enjoy some fresh air and sunshine in the playground.    It was a bright, frosty day, and the whole place seemed full of life and  activity.  There was plenty to engage their attention, and much that was  new and singular after their comparatively quiet playground at The  Birches.  But whatever there was to awaken their interest out of doors,  a thing was destined to happen during their first morning school which  would be a still greater surprise than anything they had yet encountered  during their short residence at Ronleigh.    At nine o'clock the clanging of the big bell summoned them to the  general assembly in the big schoolroom.  They took their places at a  back desk pointed out to them by the master on duty, and sat watching  the stream of boys that poured in through the open doors, wondering how  long it would take them to become acquainted with the names of such a  multitude.    The forms passed on in their usual order, and the new boys were  conducted to a vacant classroom, where they received a set of  examination papers which were intended to test the amount of their  knowledge, and determine the position in which they were to start work  on the following day.    Jack Vance, Diggory, and Mugford sat together at the first desk, just in  front of the master's table, and were soon busy in proving their  previous acquaintance with the Latin grammar.  Presently the door  opened, and a voice, which they at once recognized as Dr. Denson's,  said, \"Mr. Ellesby, may I trouble you to step here for a moment?\"  None of the trio raised their eyes from their work.  There was a  muttered conversation in the passage, and then the door was once more  closed.    The master returned to his desk, dipped his pen in the ink, and  addressing some one at the back of the room, inquired,--    \"What did Dr. Denson say your name was?\"    \"Noaks, sir.\"    The Triple Alliance gave a simultaneous start as though they had  received an electric shock, and their heads turned round like three  weathercocks.    There, sure enough, at the back desk of all, sat the late leader of the  Philistines, with a rather sheepish expression on his face, somewhat  similar to the one it had worn when the marauders from Horace House had  been ushered into Mr. Welsby's study.    Jack Vance looked at Mugford, and Mugford looked at Diggory.  \"Well, I'm  jiggered!\" whispered the latter, and once more returned to his  examination paper.    At eleven o'clock there was a quarter of an hour's interval.  Being  still, as it were, strangers in a strange land, the three friends kept  pretty close together.  They were walking arm in arm about the  quadrangle, giving expression to their astonishment at this latest  arrival at Ronleigh, when Diggory suddenly exclaimed,  \"Look out! here  he comes!\"    After so many encounters of a decidedly hostile nature, it was difficult  to meet their old enemy on neutral ground without some feeling of  embarrassment.  Young Noaks, however, walked up cool as a cucumber, and  holding out his hand said,--    \"Hullo, you fellows, who'd have thought of seeing you here! How are  you?\"    The three boys returned the salutation in a manner "]]]
