I  had lost all sense of direction, and when, swinging to the left and to  the right again, I looked through the window and perceived that we were  before the door of the Police Station, I was dully surprised.    In quite mechanical fashion I entered the depot. Inspector Ryman, our  associate in one of the darkest episodes of the campaign with the Yellow  Doctor two years before, received me in his office.    By a negative shake of the head, he answered my unspoken question.    \"The ten o'clock boat is lying off the Stone Stairs, Doctor,\" he said,  \"and co-operating with some of the Scotland Yard men who are dragging  that district--\"    I shuddered at the word \"dragging\"; Ryman had not used it literally, but  nevertheless it had conjured up a dread possibility--a possibility in  accordance with the methods of Dr. Fu-Manchu. All within space of an  instant I saw the tide of Limehouse Reach, the Thames lapping about  the green-coated timbers of a dock pier; and rising--falling--sometimes  disclosing to the pallid light a rigid hand, sometimes a horribly  bloated face--I saw the body of Nayland Smith at the mercy of those oily  waters. Ryman continued:    \"There is a launch out, too, patrolling the riverside from here to  Tilbury. Another lies at the breakwater\"--he jerked his thumb over his  shoulder. \"Should you care to take a run down and see for yourself?\"    \"No, thanks,\" I replied, shaking my head. \"You are doing all that can be  done. Can you give me the address of the place to which Mr. Smith went  last night?\"    \"Certainly,\" said Ryman; \"I thought you knew it. You remember Shen-Yan's  place--by Limehouse Basin? Well, further east--east of the Causeway,  between Gill Street and Three Colt Street--is a block of wooden  buildings. You recall them?\"    \"Yes,\" I replied. \"Is the man established there again, then?\"    \"It appears so, but, although you have evidently not been informed of  the fact, Weymouth raided the establishment in the early hours of this  morning!\"    \"Well?\" I cried.    \"Unfortunately with no result,\" continued the inspector. \"The notorious  Shen-Yan was missing, and although there is no real doubt that the place  is used as a gaming-house, not a particle of evidence to that effect  could be obtained. Also--there was no sign of Mr. Nayland Smith, and no  sign of the American, Burke, who had led him to the place.\"    \"Is it certain that they went there?\"    \"Two C. I. D. men who were shadowing, actually saw the pair of them  enter. A signal had been arranged, but it was never given; and at about  half past four, the place was raided.\"    \"Surely some arrests were made?\"    \"But there was no evidence!\" cried Ryman. \"Every inch of the rat-burrow  was searched. The Chinese gentleman who posed as the proprietor of what  he claimed to be a respectable lodging-house offered every facility to  the police. What could we do?\"    \"I take it that the place is being watched?\"    \"Certainly,\" said Ryman. \"Both from the river and from the shore. Oh!  they are not there! God knows where they are, but they are not there!\"    I stood for a moment in silence, endeavoring to determine my course;  then, telling Ryman that I hoped to see him later, I walked out slowly  into the rain and mist, and nodding to the taxi-driver to proceed to our  original destination, I re-entered the cab.    As we moved off, the lights of the River Police depot were swallowed up  in the humid murk, and again I found myself being carried through the  darkness of those narrow streets, which, like a maze, hold secret within  their labyrinth mysteries as great, and at least as foul, as that of  Pasiphae.    The marketing centers I had left far behind me; to my right stretched  the broken range of riverside buildings, and beyond them flowed the  Thames, a stream more heavily burdened with secrets than ever was Tiber  or Tigris. On my left, occasional flickering lights broke through the  mist, for the most part the lights of taverns; and saving these rents  in the veil, the darkness was punctuated with nothing but the faint and  yellow luminance of the street lamps.    Ahead was a black mouth, which promised to swallow me up as it had  swallowed up my friend.    In short, what with my lowered condition and consequent frame of mind,  and what with the traditions, for me inseparable from that gloomy  quarter of London, I was in the grip of a shadowy menace which at any  moment might become tangible--I perceived, in the most commonplace  objects, the yellow hand of Dr. Fu-Manchu.    When the cab stopped in a place of utter darkness, I aroused myself with  an effort, opened the door, and stepped out into the mud of a narrow  lane. A high brick wall frowned upon me from one side, and, dimly  perceptible, there towered a smoke stack, beyond. On my right uprose  the side of a wharf building, shadowly, and some distance ahead, almost  obscured by the drizzling rain, a solitary lamp flickered. I turned up  the collar of my raincoat, shivering, as much at the prospect as from  physical chill.    \"You will wait here,\" I said to the man; and, feeling in my  breast-pocket, I added: \"If you hear the note of a whistle, drive on and  rejoin me.\"    He listened attentively and with a certain eagerness. I had selected  him that night for the reason that he had driven Smith and myself  on previous occasions and had proved himself a man of intelligence.  Transferring a Browning pistol from my hip-pocket to that of my  raincoat, I trudged on into the mist.    The headlights of the taxi were swallowed up behind me, and just abreast  of the street lamp I stood listening.    Save for the dismal sound of rain, and the trickling of water along the  gutters, all about me was silent. Sometimes this silence would be broken  by the distant, muffled note of a steam siren; and always, forming  a sort of background to the near stillness, was the remote din of  riverside activity.    I walked on to the corner just beyond the lamp. This was the street in  which the wooden buildings were situated. I had expected to detect some  evidences of surveillances, but if any were indeed being observed, the  fact was effectively masked. Not a living creature was visible, peer as  I could.    Plans, I had none, and perceiving that the street was empty, and that  no lights showed in any of the windows, I passed on, only to find that I  had entered a cul-de-sac.    A rickety gate gave access to a descending flight of stone steps, the  bottom invisible in the denser shadows of an archway, beyond which, I  doubted not, lay the river.    Still uninspired by any definite design, I tried the gate and found that  it was unlocked. Like some wandering soul, as it has since seemed to  me, I descended. There was a lamp over the archway, but the glass was  broken, and the rain apparently had extinguished the light; as I passed  under it, I could hear the gas whistling from the burner.    Continuing my way, I found myself upon a narrow wharf with the Thames  flowing gloomily beneath me. A sort of fog hung over the river, shutting  me in. Then came an incident.    Suddenly, quite near, there arose a weird and mournful cry--a cry  indescribable, and inexpressibly uncanny!    I started back so violently that how I escaped falling into the river  I do not know to this day. That cry, so eerie and so wholly unexpected,  had unnerved me; and realizing the nature of my surroundings, and the  folly of my presence alone in such a place, I began to edge back toward  the foot of the steps, away from the thing that cried; when--a great  white shape uprose like a phantom before me!...    There are few men, I suppose, whose lives have been crowded with so many  eerie happenings as mine, but this phantom thing which grew out of the  darkness, which seemed about to envelope me, takes rank in my memory  amongst the most fearsome apparitions which I have witnessed.    I knew that I was frozen with a sort of supernatural terror. I stood  there with hands clenched, staring--staring at that white shape, which  seemed to float.    As I stared, every nerve in my body thrilling, I distinguished the  outline of the phantom. With a subdued cry, I stepped forward. A new  sensation claimed me. In that one stride I passed from the horrible to  the bizarre.    I found myself confronted with something tangible, certainly, but  something whose presence in that place was utterly extravagant--could  only be reconcilable in the dreams of an opium slave.    Was I awake, was I sane? Awake and sane beyond doubt, but surely  moving, not in the purlieus of Limehouse, but in the fantastic realms of  fairyland.    Swooping, with open arms, I rounded up in an angle against the building  and gathered in this screaming thing which had inspired in me so keen a  terror.    The great, ghostly fan was closed as I did so, and I stumbled back  toward the stair with my struggling captive tucked under my arm; I  mounted into one of London's darkest slums, carrying a beautiful white  peacock!        CHAPTER XII. DARK EYES LOOKED INTO MINE    My adventure had done nothing to relieve the feeling of unreality which  held me enthralled. Grasping the struggling bird firmly by the body, and  having the long white tail fluttering a yard or so behind me, I returned  to where the taxi waited.    \"Open the door!\" I said to the man--who greeted me with such a stare of  amazement that I laughed outright, though my mirth was but hollow.    He jumped into the road and did as I directed. Making sure that both  windows were closed, I thrust the peacock into the cab and shut the door  upon it.    \"For God's sake, sir!\" began the driver--    \"It has probably escaped from some collector's place on the riverside,\"  I explained, \"but one never knows. See that it does not escape again,  and if at the end of an hour, as arranged, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11870"],[0,"The Country of the Blind, and Other Stories (#14)"],[1,"just then that Boyce came in. So soon as he spoke Davidson  exclaimed: \"Old Boyce! Dead too! What a lark!\" I hastened to explain that  Davidson was in a kind of somnambulistic trance. Boyce was interested at  once. We both did all we could to rouse the fellow out of his  extraordinary state. He answered our questions, and asked us some of his  own, but his attention seemed distracted by his hallucination about a  beach and a ship. He kept interpolating observations concerning some boat  and the davits, and sails filling with the wind. It made one feel queer,  in the dusky laboratory, to hear him saying such things.    He was blind and helpless. We had to walk him down the passage, one at  each elbow, to Boyce's private room, and while Boyce talked to him there,  and humoured him about this ship idea, I went along the corridor and asked  old Wade to come and look at him. The voice of our Dean sobered him a  little, but not very much. He asked where his hands were, and why he had  to walk about up to his waist in the ground. Wade thought over him a long  time--you know how he knits his brows--and then made him feel the couch,  guiding his hands to it. \"That's a couch,\" said Wade. \"The couch in the  private room of Professor Boyce. Horse-hair stuffing.\"    Davidson felt about, and puzzled over it, and answered presently that he  could feel it all right, but he couldn't see it.    \"What _do_ you see?\" asked Wade. Davidson said he could see nothing  but a lot of sand and broken-up shells. Wade gave him some other things to  feel, telling him what they were, and watching him keenly.    \"The ship is almost hull down,\" said Davidson presently, _apropos_ of  nothing.    \"Never mind the ship,\" said Wade. \"Listen to me, Davidson. Do you know  what hallucination means?\"    \"Rather,\" said Davidson.    \"Well, everything you see is hallucinatory.\"    \"Bishop Berkeley,\" said Davidson.    \"Don't mistake me,\" said Wade. \"You are alive and in this room of Boyce's.  But something has happened to your eyes. You cannot see; you can feel and  hear, but not see. Do you follow me?\"    \"It seems to me that I see too much.\" Davidson rubbed his knuckles into  his eyes. \"Well?\" he said.    \"That's all. Don't let it perplex you. Bellows here and I will take you  home in a cab.\"    \"Wait a bit.\" Davidson thought. \"Help me to sit down,\" said he presently;  \"and now--I'm sorry to trouble you--but will you tell me all that over  again?\"    Wade repeated it very patiently. Davidson shut his eyes, and pressed his  hands upon his forehead. \"Yes,\" said he. \"It's quite right. Now my eyes  are shut I know you're right. That's you, Bellows, sitting by me on the  couch. I'm in England again. And we're in the dark.\"    Then he opened his eyes. \"And there,\" said he, \"is the sun just rising,  and the yards of the ship, and a tumbled sea, and a couple of birds  flying. I never saw anything so real. And I'm sitting up to my neck in a  bank of sand.\"    He bent forward and covered his face with his hands. Then he opened his  eyes again. \"Dark sea and sunrise! And yet I'm sitting on a sofa in old  Boyce's room!... God help me!\"        III.    That was the beginning. For three weeks this strange affection of  Davidson's eyes continued unabated. It was far worse than being blind. He  was absolutely helpless, and had to be fed like a newly-hatched bird, and  led about and undressed. If he attempted to move, he fell over things or  struck himself against walls or doors. After a day or so he got used to  hearing our voices without seeing us, and willingly admitted he was at  home, and that Wade was right in what he told him. My sister, to whom he  was engaged, insisted on coming to see him, and would sit for hours every  day while he talked about this beach of his. Holding her hand seemed to  comfort him immensely. He explained that when we left the College and  drove home--he lived in Hampstead village--it appeared to him as if we  drove right through a sandhill--it was perfectly black until he emerged  again--and through rocks and trees and solid obstacles, and when he was  taken to his own room it made him giddy and almost frantic with the fear  of falling, because going upstairs seemed to lift him thirty or forty feet  above the rocks of his imaginary island. He kept saying he should smash  all the eggs. The end was that he had to be taken down into his father's  consulting room and laid upon a couch that stood there.    He described the island as being a bleak kind of place on the whole, with  very little vegetation, except some peaty stuff, and a lot of bare rock.  There were multitudes of penguins, and they made the rocks white and  disagreeable to see. The sea was often rough, and once there was a  thunderstorm, and he lay and shouted at the silent flashes. Once or twice  seals pulled up on the beach, but only on the first two or three days. He  said it was very funny the way in which the penguins used to waddle right  through him, and how he seemed to lie among them without disturbing them.    I remember one odd thing, and that was when he wanted very badly to smoke.  We put a pipe in his hands--he almost poked his eye out with it--and lit  it. But he couldn't taste anything. I've since found it's the same with  me--I don't know if it's the usual case--that I cannot enjoy tobacco at  all unless I can see the smoke.    But the queerest part of his vision came when Wade sent him out in a  Bath-chair to get fresh air. The Davidsons hired a chair, and got that  deaf and obstinate dependant of theirs, Widgery, to attend to it.  Widgery's ideas of healthy expeditions were peculiar. My sister, who had  been to the Dogs' Home, met them in Camden Town, towards King's Cross,  Widgery trotting along complacently, and Davidson, evidently most  distressed, trying in his feeble, blind way to attract Widgery's  attention.    He positively wept when my sister spoke to him. \"Oh, get me out of this  horrible darkness!\" he said, feeling for her hand. \"I must get out of it,  or I shall die.\" He was quite incapable of explaining what was the matter,  but my sister decided he must go home, and presently, as they went uphill  towards Hampstead, the horror seemed to drop from him. He said it was good  to see the stars again, though it was then about noon and a blazing day.    \"It seemed,\" he told me afterwards, \"as if I was being carried  irresistibly towards the water. I was not very much alarmed at first. Of  course it was night there--a lovely night.\"    \"Of course?\" I asked, for that struck me as odd.    \"Of course,\" said he. \"It's always night there when it is day here...  Well, we went right into the water, which was calm and shining under the  moonlight--just a broad swell that seemed to grow broader and flatter as I  came down into it. The surface glistened just like a skin--it might have  been empty space underneath for all I could tell to the contrary. Very  slowly, for I rode slanting into it, the water crept up to my eyes. Then I  went under and the skin seemed to break and heal again about my eyes. The  moon gave a jump up in the sky and grew green and dim, and fish, faintly  glowing, came darting round me--and things that seemed made of luminous  glass; and I passed through a tangle of seaweeds that shone with an oily  lustre. And so I drove down into the sea, and the stars went out one by  one, and the moon grew greener and darker, and the seaweed became a  luminous purple-red. It was all very faint and mysterious, and everything  seemed to quiver. And all the while I could hear the wheels of the  Bath-chair creaking, and the footsteps of people going by, and a man in  the distance selling the special _Pall Mall_.    \"I kept sinking down deeper and deeper into the water. It became inky  black about me, not a ray from above came down into that darkness, and the  phosphorescent things grew brighter and brighter. The snaky branches of  the deeper weeds flickered like the flames of spirit-lamps; but, after a  time, there were no more weeds. The fishes came staring and gaping towards  me, and into me and through me. I never imagined such fishes before. They  had lines of fire along the sides of them as though they had been outlined  with a luminous pencil. And there was a ghastly thing swimming backwards  with a lot of twining arms. And then I saw, coming very slowly towards me  through the gloom, a hazy mass of light that resolved itself as it drew  nearer into multitudes of fishes, struggling and darting round something  that drifted. I drove on straight towards it, and presently I saw in the  midst of the tumult, and by the light of the fish, a bit of splintered  spar looming over me, and a dark hull tilting over, and some glowing  phosphorescent forms that were shaken and writhed as the fish bit at them.  Then it was I began to try to attract Widgery's attention. A horror came  upon me. Ugh! I should have driven right into those half-eaten--things. If  your sister had not come! They had great holes in them, Bellows, and ...  Never mind. But it was ghastly!\"      IV.    For three weeks Davidson remained in this singular state, seeing what at  the time we imagined was an altogether phantasmal world, and stone blind  to the world around him. Then, one Tuesday, when I called I met old  Davidson in the passage. \"He can see his thumb!\" the old gentleman said,  in a perfect transport. He was struggling into his overcoat. \"He can see  his thumb, Bellows!\" he said, with the tears in his eyes. \"The lad will be  all right yet.\"    I rushed in to Davidson. He was holding up a little book before his face,  and looking at it and laughing in a weak kind of way.    \"It's amazing,\" said he. \"There's a kind of patch come there.\" He pointed  with his finger. \"I'm on the rocks as usual, and the penguins are  staggering and flapping about as usual, and there's been a whale showing  every now and then, but it's got too dark now to make him out. But put  something _there_, and I"]]]
