The great noise gradually ceased to be heard, as  they journeyed inwards, till at last they became aware of a world of  sighs, which produced a trembling in the air. They were breathed by the  souls of such as had died without baptism, men, women, and infants; no  matter how good; no matter if they worshipped God before the coming of  Christ, for they worshipped him not \"properly.\" Virgil himself was  one of them. They were all lost for no other reason; and their \"only  suffering\" consisted in \"hopeless desire!\"    Dante was struck with great sorrow when he heard this, knowing how many  good men must be in that place. He inquired if no one had ever been  taken out of it into heaven. Virgil told him there had, and he named  them; to wit, Adam, Abel, Noah, Moses, King David, obedient Abraham the  patriarch, and Isaac, and Jacob, with their children, and Rachel, for  whom Jacob did so much,--and \"many more;\" adding, however, that there  was no instance of salvation before theirs.    Journeying on through spirits as thick as leaves, Dante perceived a  lustre at a little distance, and observing shapes in it evidently of  great dignity, inquired who they were that thus lived apart from the  rest. Virgil said that heaven thus favoured them by reason of their  renown on earth. A voice was then heard exclaiming, \"Honour and glory to  the lofty poet! Lo, his shade returns.\" Dante then saw four other noble  figures coming towards them, of aspect neither sad nor cheerful.    \"Observe him with the sword in his hand,\" said Virgil, as they were  advancing. \"That is Homer, the poets' sovereign. Next to him comes  Horace the satirist; then Ovid; and the last is Lucan.\"    \"And thus I beheld,\" says Dante, \"the bright school of the loftiest of  poets, who flies above the rest like an eagle.\"    For a while the illustrious spirits talked together, and then turned to  the Florentine with a benign salutation, at which his master smiled and  \"further honour they did me,\" adds the father of Italian poetry, \"for  they admitted me of their tribe; so that to a band of that high account  I added a sixth.\" [7]    The spirits returned towards the bright light in which they lived,  talking with Dante by the way, and brought him to a magnificent castle,  girt with seven lofty walls, and further defended with a river, which  they all passed as if it had been dry ground. Seven gates conducted them  into a meadow of fresh green, the resort of a race whose eyes moved with  a deliberate soberness, and whose whole aspects were of great authority,  their voices sweet, and their speech seldom.[8] Dante was taken apart to  an elevation in the ground, so that he could behold them all distinctly;  and there, on the \"enamelled green,\" [9] were pointed out to him the  great spirits, by the sight of whom he felt exalted in his own esteem.  He saw Electra with many companions, among whom were Hector and AEneas,  and Caesar in armour with his hawk's eyes; and on another side he beheld  old King Latinus with his daughter Lavinia, and the Brutus that expelled  Tarquin, and Lucretia, and Julia, and Cato's wife Marcia, and the mother  of the Gracchi, and, apart by himself, the Sultan Saladin. He then  raised his eyes a little, and beheld the \"master of those who know\" [10]  (Aristotle), sitting amidst the family of philosophers, and honoured  by them all. Socrates and Plato were at his side. Among the rest was  Democritus, who made the world a chance, and Diogenes, and Heraclitus,  &c. and Dioscorides, the good gatherer of simples. Orpheus also he saw,  and Cicero, and the moral Seneca, and Euclid, and Hippocrates, and  Avicen, and Averroes, who wrote the great commentary, and others too  numerous to mention. The company of six became diminished to two, and  Virgil took him forth on a far different road, leaving that serene air  for a stormy one; and so they descended again into darkness.    It was the second circle into which they now came--a sphere narrower  than the first, and by so much more the wretcheder. Minos sat at the  entrance, gnarling--he that gives sentence on every one that comes, and  intimates the circle into which each is to be plunged by the number of  folds into which he casts his tail round about him. Minos admonished  Dante to beware how he entered unbidden, and warned him against his  conductor; but Virgil sharply rebuked the judge, and bade him not set  his will against the will that was power.    The pilgrims then descended through hell-mouth, till they came to a  place dark as pitch, that bellowed with furious cross-winds, like a sea  in a tempest. It was the first place of torment, and the habitation of  carnal sinners. The winds, full of stifled voices, buffeted the souls  for ever, whirling them away to and fro, and dashing them against one  another. Whenever it seized them for that purpose, the wailing and the  shrieking was loudest, crying out against the Divine Power. Sometimes a  whole multitude came driven in a body like starlings before the wind,  now hither and thither, now up, now down; sometimes they went in a line  like cranes, when a company of those birds is beheld sailing along in  the air, uttering its dolorous clangs.    Dante, seeing a group of them advancing, inquired of Virgil who they  were. \"Who are these,\" said he, \"coming hither, scourged in the blackest  part of the hurricane?\"    \"She at the head of them,\" said Virgil, \"was empress over many nations.  So foul grew her heart with lust, that she ordained license to be law,  to the end that herself might be held blameless. She is Semiramis, of  whom it is said that she gave suck to Ninus, and espoused him. Leading  the multitude next to her is Dido, she that slew herself for love, and  broke faith to the ashes of Sichaeus; and she that follows with the next  is the luxurious woman, Cleopatra.\"    Dante then saw Helen, who produced such a world of misery; and the great  Achilles, who fought for love till it slew him; and Paris; and Tristan;  and a thousand more whom his guide pointed at, naming their names, every  one of whom was lost through love.    The poet stood for a while speechless for pity, and like one bereft of  his wits. He then besought leave to speak to a particular couple who  went side by side, and who appeared to be borne before the wind with  speed lighter than the rest. His conductor bade him wait till they came  nigher, and then to entreat them gently by the love which bore them in  that manner, and they would stop and speak with him. Dante waited his  time, and then lifted up his voice between the gusts of wind, and  adjured the two \"weary souls\" to halt and have speech with him, if none  forbade their doing so; upon which they came to him, like doves to the  nest.[11]    There was a lull in the tempest, as if on purpose to let them speak;  and the female addressed Dante, saying, that as he showed such pity for  their state, they would have prayed heaven to give peace and repose to  his life, had they possessed the friendship of heaven.[12]    \"Love,\" she said, \"which is soon kindled in a gentle heart, seized this  my companion for the fair body I once inhabited--how deprived of it, my  spirit is bowed to recollect. Love, which compels the beloved person  upon thoughts of love, seized me in turn with a delight in his passion  so strong, that, as thou seest, even here it forsakes me not. Love  brought us both to one end. The punishment of Cain awaits him that slew  us.\"    The poet was struck dumb by this story. He hung down his head, and stood  looking on the ground so long, that his guide asked him what was in his  mind. \"Alas!\" answered he, \"such then was this love, so full of sweet  thoughts; and such the pass to which it brought them! Oh, Francesca!\" he  cried, turning again to the sad couple, \"thy sufferings make me weep.  But tell me, I pray thee, what was it that first made thee know, for a  certainty, that his love was returned?--that thou couldst refuse him  thine no longer?\"    \"There is not a greater sorrow,\" answered she, \"than calling to mind  happy moments in the midst of wretchedness.[13] But since thy desire is  so great to know our story to the root, hear me tell it as well as I  may for tears. It chanced, one day, that we sat reading the tale of  Sir Launcelot, how love took him in thrall. We were alone, and had no  suspicion. Often, as we read, our eyes became suspended,[14] and we  changed colour; but one passage alone it was that overcame us. When we  read how Genevra smiled, and how the lover, out of the depth of his  love, could not help kissing that smile, he that is never more to be  parted from me kissed me himself on the mouth, all in a tremble. Never  had we go-between but that book. The writer was the betrayer. That day  we read no more.\"    While these words were being uttered by one of the spirits, the other  wailed so bitterly, that the poet thought he should have died for pity.  His senses forsook him, and he fell flat on the ground, as a dead body  falls.[15]    On regaining his senses, the poet found himself in the third circle of  hell, a place of everlasting wet, darkness, and cold, one heavy slush of  hail and mud, emitting a squalid smell. The triple-headed dog Cerberus,  with red eyes and greasy black beard, large belly, and hands with claws,  barked above the heads of the wretches who floundered in the mud,  tearing, skinning, and dismembering them, as they turned their sore and  soddened bodies from side to side. When he saw the two living men, he  showed his fangs, and shook in every limb for desire of their flesh.  Virgil threw lumps of dirt into his mouth, and so they passed him.    It was the place of Gluttons. The travellers passed over them, as if  they had been ground to walk upon. But one of them sat up, and addressed  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10886"],[0,"The Untamed (#14)"],[1," Lee Hardy woke  up, and before the stranger had spoken a dozen words the agent was  leaning forward to be sure that he would not miss a syllable.    \"You're Lee Hardy, aren't you?\" said he, and his eyes gave the  impression of a smile, though his lips did not stir after speaking.    \"I am,\" said the agent.    \"Then you're the man I want to see. If you don't mind--\"    He closed the door, pulled a chair against it, and then sat down, and  folded his arms. Very obviously he meant business. Hardy switched his  position in his chair, sitting a little more to the right, so that the  edge of the seat would not obstruct the movement of his hand towards  the holster on his right thigh.    \"Well,\" he said good naturedly, \"I'm waitin'.\"    \"Good,\" said the stranger, \"I won't keep you here any longer than is  necessary. In the first place my name is Tex Calder.\"    Hardy changed as if a slight layer of dust had been sifted over his  face. He stretched out his hand.    \"It's great to see you, Calder,\" he said, \"of course I've heard  about you. Everyone has. Here! I'll send over to the saloon for some  red-eye. Are you dry?\"    He rose, but Calder waved him back to the swivel-chair.    \"Not dry a bit,\" he said cheerily. \"Not five minutes ago I had a drink  of--water.\"    \"All right,\" said Hardy, and settled back into his chair.    \"Hardy, there's been crooked work around here.\"    \"What in hell--\"    \"Get your hand away from that gun, friend.\"    \"What the devil's the meaning of all this?\"    \"That's very well done,\" said Calder. \"But this isn't the stage. Are  we going to talk business like friends?\"    \"I've got nothing agin you,\" said Hardy testily, and his eyes followed  Calder's right hand as if fascinated. \"What do you want to say? I'll  listen. I'm not very busy.\"    \"That's exactly it,\" smiled Tex Calder, \"I want you to get busier.\"    \"Thanks.\"    \"In the first place I'll be straight with you. Wells Fargo hasn't sent  me here.\"    \"Who has?\"    \"My conscience.\"    \"I don't get your drift.\"    Through a moment of pause Calder's eyes searched the face of Hardy.    \"You've been pretty flush for some time.\"    \"I ain't been starvin'.\"    \"There are several easy ways for you to pick up extra money.\"    \"Yes?\"    \"For instance, you know all about the Wells Fargo money shipments, and  there are men around here who'd pay big for what you could tell them.\"    The prominent Adam's apple rose and fell in Hardy's throat.    \"You're quite a joker, ain't you Calder? Who, for instance?\"    \"Jim Silent.\"    \"This is like a story in a book,\" grinned Hardy. \"Go on. I suppose  I've been takin' Silent's money?\"    The answer came like the click of a cocked revolver.    \"You have!\"    \"By God, Calder--\"    \"Steady! I have some promising evidence, partner. Would you like to  hear part of it?\"    \"This country has its share of the world's greatest liars,\" said  Hardy, \"I don't care what you've heard.\"    \"That saves my time. Understand me straight. I can slap you into a  lock-up, if I want to, and then bring in that evidence. I'm not going  to do it. I'm going to use you as a trap and through you get some of  the worst of the lone riders.\"    \"There's nothin' like puttin' your hand on the table.\"    \"No, there isn't. I'll tell you what you're to do.\"    \"Thanks.\"    The marshal drove straight on.    \"I've got four good men in this town. Two of them will always be  hanging around your office. Maybe you can get a job for them here, eh?  I'll pay the salaries. You simply tip them off when your visitors are  riders the government wants, see? You don't have to lift a hand. You  just go to the door as the visitor leaves, and if he's all right you  say: 'So long, we'll be meeting again before long.' But if he's a man  I want, you say 'Good-bye.' That's all. My boys will see that it is  good-bye.\"    \"Go on,\" said the agent, \"and tell the rest of the story. It starts  well.\"    \"Doesn't it?\" agreed Calder, \"and the way it concludes is with you  reaching over and shaking hands with me and saying 'yes'!\"    He leaned forward. The twinkle was gone from his eyes and he extended  his hand to Hardy. The latter reached out with an impulsive gesture,  wrung the proffered hand, and then slipping back into his chair broke  into hysterical laughter.    \"The real laugh,\" said Calder, watching his man narrowly, \"will be on  the long riders.\"    \"Tex,\" said the agent. \"I guess you have the dope. I won't say  anything except that I'm glad as hell to be out of the rotten business  at last. Once started I couldn't stop. I did one 'favour' for these  devils, and after that they had me in their power. I haven't slept for  months as I'm going to sleep tonight!\"    He wiped his face with an agitated hand.    \"A week ago,\" he went on, \"I knew you were detailed on this work. I've  been sweating ever since. Now that you've come--why, I'm glad of it!\"    A faint sneer touched Calder's mouth and was gone.    \"You're a wise man,\" he said. \"Have you seen much of Jim Silent  lately?\"    Hardy hesitated. The role of informer was new.    \"Not directly.\"    Calder nodded.    \"Now put me right if I go off the track. The way I understand it, Jim  Silent has about twenty gun fighters and long riders working in gangs  under him and combining for big jobs.\"    \"That's about it.\"    \"The inside circle consists of Silent; Lee Haines, a man who went  wrong because the law did _him_ wrong; Hal Purvis, a cunning devil;  and Bill Kilduff, a born fighter who loves blood for its own sake.\"    \"Right.\"    \"Here's something more. For Jim Silent, dead or alive, the government  will pay ten thousand dollars. For each of the other three it pays  five thousand. The notices aren't out yet, but they will be in a few  days. Hardy, if you help me bag these men, you'll get fifty per cent  of the profits. Are you on?\"    The hesitancy of Hardy changed to downright enthusiasm.    \"Easy money, Tex. I'm your man, hand and glove.\"    \"Don't get optimistic. This game isn't played yet, and unless I make  the biggest mistake of my life we'll be guessing again before we land  Silent. I've trailed some fast gunmen in my day, and I have an idea  that Silent will be the hardest of the lot; but if you play your end  of the game we may land him. I have a tip that he's lying out in the  country near Elkhead. I'm riding out alone to get track of him. As I  go out I'll tell my men that you're O.K. for this business.\"    He hesitated a moment with his hand on the door knob.    \"Just one thing more, Hardy. I heard a queer tale this morning about  a fight in a saloon run by a man named Morgan. Do you know anything  about it?\"    \"No.\"    \"I was told of a fellow who chipped four dollars thrown into the air  at twenty yards.\"    \"That's a lie.\"    \"The man who talked to me had a nicked dollar to prove his yarn.\"    \"The devil he did!\"    \"And after the shooting this chap got into a fight with a tall man  twice his size and fairly mopped up the floor with him. They say it  wasn't a nice thing to watch. He is a frail man, but when the fight  started he turned into a tiger.\"    \"Wish I'd seen it.\"    \"The tall man tallies to a hair with my description of Silent.\"    \"You're wrong. I know what Silent can do with his hands. No one could  beat him up. What's the name of the other?\"    \"Barry. Whistling Dan Barry.\"    Calder hesitated.    \"Right or wrong, I'd like to have this Barry with me. So long.\"    He was gone as he had come, with a nod and a flash of the keen, black  eyes. Lee Hardy stared at the door for some moments, and then went  outside. The warm light of the sun had never been more welcome to him.  Under that cheering influence he began to feel that with Tex Calder  behind him he could safely defy the world.    His confidence received a shock that afternoon when a heavy step  crossed the outside room, and his door opening without a preliminary  knock, he looked up into the solemn eyes of Jim Silent. The outlaw  shook his head when Hardy offered him a chair.    \"What's the main idea of them two new men out in your front room,  Lee?\" he asked.    \"Two cowpunchers that was down on their luck. I got to stand in with  the boys now and then.\"    \"I s'pose so. Shorty Rhinehart in here to see you, Lee?\"    \"Yep.\"    \"You told him that the town was gettin' pretty hot.\"    \"It is.\"    \"You said you had no dope on when that delayed shipment was comin'  through?\"    Hardy made lightning calculations. A half truth would be the best way  out.    \"I've just got the word you want. It come this morning.\"    Silent's expression changed and he leaned a little closer.    \"It's the nineteenth. Train number 89. Savvy? Seven o'clock at  Elkhead!\"    \"How much? Same bunch of coin?\"    \"Fifty thousand!\"    \"That's ten more.\"    \"Yep. A new shipment rolled in with the old one. No objections?\"    Silent grinned.    \"Any other news, Lee?\"    \"Shorty told you about Tex Calder?\"    \"He did. Seen him around here?\"    The slightest fraction of a second in hesitation.    \"No.\"    \"Was that the straight dope you give Shorty?\"    \"Straighter'n hell. They're beginnin' to talk, but I guess I was jest  sort of panicky when I talked with Shorty.\"    \"This Tex Calder----\"    \"What about him?\" This with a trace of suspicion.    \"He's got a long record.\"    \"So've you, Jim.\"    Once more that wolflike grin which had no mirth.    \"So long, Lee. I'll be on the job. Lay to that.\"    He turned towards the door. Hardy followed him. A moment more, in a  single word, and the job would be done. Five thousand dollars for a  single word! It warmed the very heart of Lee Hardy.    Silent, as he moved away, seemed singularly thoughtful. He hesitated a  moment with bowed head at the door--then whirled and shoved a six-gun  under the nose of Hardy. The latter leaped back with his arms thrust  above his head, straining at his hands to get them higher.    \"My God, Jim!\"    \"You're a low-down, lyin' hound!\"    Hardy's tongue clove to the roof of his mouth.    \"Damn you,"]]]
