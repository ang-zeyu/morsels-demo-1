[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/964"],[0,"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (#13)"],[1,"Fair which was  celebrated every five years at Nottingham Town, to which folk came from  far and near throughout the country. At such times archery was always  the main sport of the day, for the Nottinghamshire yeomen were the best  hand at the longbow in all merry England, but this year the Sheriff  hesitated a long time before he issued proclamation of the Fair, fearing  lest Robin Hood and his band might come to it. At first he had a great  part of a mind not to proclaim the Fair, but second thought told him  that men would laugh at him and say among themselves that he was afraid  of Robin Hood, so he put that thought by. At last he fixed in his mind  that he would offer such a prize as they would not care to shoot for.  At such times it had been the custom to offer a half score of marks or  a tun of ale, so this year he proclaimed that a prize of two fat steers  should be given to the best bowman.    When Robin Hood heard what had been proclaimed he was vexed, and said,  \"Now beshrew this Sheriff that he should offer such a prize that none  but shepherd hinds will care to shoot for it! I would have loved nothing  better than to have had another bout at merry Nottingham Town, but if I  should win this prize nought would it pleasure or profit me.\"    Then up spoke Little John: \"Nay, but hearken, good master,\" said he,  \"only today Will Stutely, young David of Doncaster, and I were at the  Sign of the Blue Boar, and there we heard all the news of this merry  Fair, and also that the Sheriff hath offered this prize, that we of  Sherwood might not care to come to the Fair; so, good master, if thou  wilt, I would fain go and strive to win even this poor thing among the  stout yeomen who will shoot at Nottingham Town.\"    \"Nay, Little John,\" quoth Robin, \"thou art a sound stout fellow, yet  thou lackest the cunning that good Stutely hath, and I would not have  harm befall thee for all Nottinghamshire. Nevertheless, if thou wilt go,  take some disguise lest there be those there who may know thee.\"    \"So be it, good master,\" quoth Little John, \"yet all the disguise that I  wish is a good suit of scarlet instead of this of Lincoln green. I will  draw the cowl of my jacket about my head so that it will hide my brown  hair and beard, and then, I trust, no one will know me.\"    \"It is much against my will,\" said Robin Hood, \"ne'ertheless, if thou  dost wish it, get thee gone, but bear thyself seemingly, Little John,  for thou art mine own right-hand man and I could ill bear to have harm  befall thee.\"    So Little John clad himself all in scarlet and started off to the Fair  at Nottingham Town.    Right merry were these Fair days at Nottingham, when the green before  the great town gate was dotted with booths standing in rows, with  tents of many-colored canvas, hung about with streamers and garlands  of flowers, and the folk came from all the countryside, both gentle  and common. In some booths there was dancing to merry music, in others  flowed ale and beer, and in others yet again sweet cakes and barley  sugar were sold; and sport was going outside the booths also, where some  minstrel sang ballads of the olden time, playing a second upon the harp,  or where the wrestlers struggled with one another within the sawdust  ring, but the people gathered most of all around a raised platform where  stout fellows played at quarterstaff.    So Little John came to the Fair. All scarlet were his hose and jerkin,  and scarlet was his cowled cap, with a scarlet feather stuck in the side  of it. Over his shoulders was slung a stout bow of yew, and across his  back hung a quiver of good round arrows. Many turned to look after such  a stout, tall fellow, for his shoulders were broader by a palm's-breadth  than any that were there, and he stood a head taller than all the other  men. The lasses, also, looked at him askance, thinking they had never  seen a lustier youth.    First of all he went to the booth where stout ale was sold and, standing  aloft on a bench, he called to all that were near to come and drink  with him. \"Hey, sweet lads!\" cried he \"who will drink ale with a stout  yeoman? Come, all! Come, all! Let us be merry, for the day is sweet and  the ale is tingling. Come hither, good yeoman, and thou, and thou;  for not a farthing shall one of you pay. Nay, turn hither, thou lusty  beggar, and thou jolly tinker, for all shall be merry with me.\"    Thus he shouted, and all crowded around, laughing, while the brown ale  flowed; and they called Little John a brave fellow, each swearing that  he loved him as his own brother; for when one has entertainment with  nothing to pay, one loves the man that gives it to one.    Then he strolled to the platform where they were at cudgel play, for he  loved a bout at quarterstaff as he loved meat and drink; and here befell  an adventure that was sung in ballads throughout the mid-country for  many a day.    One fellow there was that cracked crowns of everyone who threw cap into  the ring. This was Eric o' Lincoln, of great renown, whose name had been  sung in ballads throughout the countryside. When Little John reached the  stand he found none fighting, but only bold Eric walking up and down the  platform, swinging his staff and shouting lustily, \"Now, who will  come and strike a stroke for the lass he loves the best, with a good  Lincolnshire yeoman? How now, lads? Step up! Step up! Or else the  lasses' eyes are not bright hereabouts, or the blood of Nottingham youth  is sluggish and cold. Lincoln against Nottingham, say I! For no one hath  put foot upon the boards this day such as we of Lincoln call a cudgel  player.\"    At this, one would nudge another with his elbow, saying, \"Go thou,  Ned!\" or \"Go thou, Thomas!\" but no lad cared to gain a cracked crown for  nothing.    Presently Eric saw where Little John stood among the others, a head and  shoulders above them all, and he called to him loudly, \"Halloa, thou  long-legged fellow in scarlet! Broad are thy shoulders and thick thy  head; is not thy lass fair enough for thee to take cudgel in hand for  her sake? In truth, I believe that Nottingham men do turn to bone and  sinew, for neither heart nor courage have they! Now, thou great lout,  wilt thou not twirl staff for Nottingham?\"    \"Ay,\" quoth Little John, \"had I but mine own good staff here, it would  pleasure me hugely to crack thy knave's pate, thou saucy braggart! I wot  it would be well for thee an thy cock's comb were cut!\" Thus he spoke,  slowly at first, for he was slow to move; but his wrath gathered headway  like a great stone rolling down a hill, so that at the end he was full  of anger.    Then Eric o' Lincoln laughed aloud. \"Well spoken for one who fears to  meet me fairly, man to man,\" said he. \"Saucy art thou thine own self,  and if thou puttest foot upon these boards, I will make thy saucy tongue  rattle within thy teeth!\"    \"Now,\" quoth Little John, \"is there never a man here that will lend me  a good stout staff till I try the mettle of yon fellow?\" At this, half a  score reached him their staves, and he took the stoutest and heaviest of  them all. Then, looking up and down the cudgel, he said, \"Now, I have in  my hand but a splint of wood--a barley straw, as it were--yet I trow it  will have to serve me, so here goeth.\" Thereupon he cast the cudgel  upon the stand and, leaping lightly after it, snatched it up in his hand  again.    Then each man stood in his place and measured the other with fell looks  until he that directed the sport cried, \"Play!\" At this they stepped  forth, each grasping his staff tightly in the middle. Then those that  stood around saw the stoutest game of quarterstaff that e'er Nottingham  Town beheld. At first Eric o' Lincoln thought that he would gain an easy  advantage, so he came forth as if he would say, \"Watch, good people, how  that I carve you this cockerel right speedily;\" but he presently found  it to be no such speedy matter. Right deftly he struck, and with great  skill of fence, but he had found his match in Little John. Once, twice,  thrice, he struck, and three times Little John turned the blows to the  left hand and to the right. Then quickly and with a dainty backhanded  blow, he rapped Eric beneath his guard so shrewdly that it made his head  ring again. Then Eric stepped back to gather his wits, while a great  shout went up and all were glad that Nottingham had cracked Lincoln's  crown; and thus ended the first bout of the game.    Then presently the director of the sport cried, \"Play!\" and they came  together again; but now Eric played warily, for he found his man was of  right good mettle, and also he had no sweet memory of the blow that he  had got; so this bout neither Little John nor the Lincoln man caught  a stroke within his guard. Then, after a while, they parted again, and  this made the second bout.    Then for the third time they came together, and at first Eric strove to  be wary, as he had been before; but, growing mad at finding himself so  foiled, he lost his wits and began to rain blows so fiercely and so fast  that they rattled like hail on penthouse roof; but, in spite of all, he  did not reach within Little John's guard. Then at last Little John saw  his chance and seized it right cleverly. Once more, with a quick blow,  he rapped Eric beside the head, and ere he could regain himself, Little  John slipped his right hand down to his left and, with a swinging blow,  smote the other so sorely upon the crown that down he fell as though he  would never move again.    Then the people shouted so loud that folk came running from all about to  see what was the ado; while Little John leaped down from the stand and  gave the staff back to him that had lent it to him. And thus ended the  famous bout between Little John and Eric o' Lincoln of great renown.    But now the time had come when those who were to shoot with the longbow  were to take their places, so the people began flocking to the butts  where the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/965"],[0,"The Black Tulip (#13)"],[1,"turned round and took a rapid survey of the whole  cabinet.    \"Where is the apartment you call your dry-room?\" he asked.    \"The very same where you now are, Master van Spennen.\"    The magistrate cast a glance at a small note at the top of his papers.    \"All right,\" he said, like a man who is sure of his ground.    Then, turning round towards Cornelius, he continued, \"Will you give up  those papers to me?\"    \"But I cannot, Master van Spennen; those papers do not belong to me;  they have been deposited with me as a trust, and a trust is sacred.\"    \"Dr. Cornelius,\" said the judge, \"in the name of the States, I order you  to open this drawer, and to give up to me the papers which it contains.\"    Saying this, the judge pointed with his finger to the third drawer of  the press, near the fireplace.    In this very drawer, indeed the papers deposited by the Warden of the  Dikes with his godson were lying; a proof that the police had received  very exact information.    \"Ah! you will not,\" said Van Spennen, when he saw Cornelius standing  immovable and bewildered, \"then I shall open the drawer myself.\"    And, pulling out the drawer to its full length, the magistrate at first  alighted on about twenty bulbs, carefully arranged and ticketed, and  then on the paper parcel, which had remained in exactly the same state  as it was when delivered by the unfortunate Cornelius de Witt to his  godson.    The magistrate broke the seals, tore off the envelope, cast an eager  glance on the first leaves which met his eye and then exclaimed, in a  terrible voice,--    \"Well, justice has been rightly informed after all!\"    \"How,\" said Cornelius, \"how is this?\"    \"Don't pretend to be ignorant, Mynheer van Baerle,\" answered the  magistrate. \"Follow me.\"    \"How's that! follow you?\" cried the Doctor.    \"Yes, sir, for in the name of the States I arrest you.\"    Arrests were not as yet made in the name of William of Orange; he had  not been Stadtholder long enough for that.    \"Arrest me!\" cried Cornelius; \"but what have I done?\"    \"That's no affair of mine, Doctor; you will explain all that before your  judges.\"    \"Where?\"    \"At the Hague.\"    Cornelius, in mute stupefaction, embraced his old nurse, who was in  a swoon; shook hands with his servants, who were bathed in tears, and  followed the magistrate, who put him in a coach as a prisoner of state  and had him driven at full gallop to the Hague.          Chapter 8. An Invasion      The incident just related was, as the reader has guessed before this,  the diabolical work of Mynheer Isaac Boxtel.    It will be remembered that, with the help of his telescope, not even the  least detail of the private meeting between Cornelius de Witt and Van  Baerle had escaped him. He had, indeed, heard nothing, but he had seen  everything, and had rightly concluded that the papers intrusted by the  Warden to the Doctor must have been of great importance, as he saw Van  Baerle so carefully secreting the parcel in the drawer where he used to  keep his most precious bulbs.    The upshot of all this was that when Boxtel, who watched the course of  political events much more attentively than his neighbour Cornelius was  used to do, heard the news of the brothers De Witt being arrested on a  charge of high treason against the States, he thought within his heart  that very likely he needed only to say one word, and the godson would be  arrested as well as the godfather.    Yet, full of happiness as was Boxtel's heart at the chance, he at first  shrank with horror from the idea of informing against a man whom this  information might lead to the scaffold.    But there is this terrible thing in evil thoughts, that evil minds soon  grow familiar with them.    Besides this, Mynheer Isaac Boxtel encouraged himself with the following  sophism:--    \"Cornelius de Witt is a bad citizen, as he is charged with high treason,  and arrested.    \"I, on the contrary, am a good citizen, as I am not charged with  anything in the world, as I am as free as the air of heaven.\"    \"If, therefore, Cornelius de Witt is a bad citizen,--of which there  can be no doubt, as he is charged with high treason, and arrested,--his  accomplice, Cornelius van Baerle, is no less a bad citizen than himself.    \"And, as I am a good citizen, and as it is the duty of every good  citizen to inform against the bad ones, it is my duty to inform against  Cornelius van Baerle.\"    Specious as this mode of reasoning might sound, it would not perhaps  have taken so complete a hold of Boxtel, nor would he perhaps have  yielded to the mere desire of vengeance which was gnawing at his heart,  had not the demon of envy been joined with that of cupidity.    Boxtel was quite aware of the progress which Van Baerle had made towards  producing the grand black tulip.    Dr. Cornelius, notwithstanding all his modesty, had not been able to  hide from his most intimate friends that he was all but certain to win,  in the year of grace 1673, the prize of a hundred thousand guilders  offered by the Horticultural Society of Haarlem.    It was just this certainty of Cornelius van Baerle that caused the fever  which raged in the heart of Isaac Boxtel.    If Cornelius should be arrested there would necessarily be a great upset  in his house, and during the night after his arrest no one would think  of keeping watch over the tulips in his garden.    Now in that night Boxtel would climb over the wall and, as he knew the  position of the bulb which was to produce the grand black tulip, he  would filch it; and instead of flowering for Cornelius, it would flower  for him, Isaac; he also, instead of Van Baerle, would have the prize  of a hundred thousand guilders, not to speak of the sublime honour of  calling the new flower Tulipa nigra Boxtellensis,--a result which would  satisfy not only his vengeance, but also his cupidity and his ambition.    Awake, he thought of nothing but the grand black tulip; asleep, he  dreamed of it.    At last, on the 19th of August, about two o'clock in the afternoon,  the temptation grew so strong, that Mynheer Isaac was no longer able to  resist it.    Accordingly, he wrote an anonymous information, the minute exactness of  which made up for its want of authenticity, and posted his letter.    Never did a venomous paper, slipped into the jaws of the bronze lions at  Venice, produce a more prompt and terrible effect.    On the same evening the letter reached the principal magistrate, who  without a moment's delay convoked his colleagues early for the next  morning. On the following morning, therefore, they assembled, and  decided on Van Baerle's arrest, placing the order for its execution in  the hands of Master van Spennen, who, as we have seen, performed his  duty like a true Hollander, and who arrested the Doctor at the very hour  when the Orange party at the Hague were roasting the bleeding shreds of  flesh torn from the corpses of Cornelius and John de Witt.    But, whether from a feeling of shame or from craven weakness, Isaac  Boxtel did not venture that day to point his telescope either at the  garden, or at the laboratory, or at the dry-room.    He knew too well what was about to happen in the house of the poor  doctor to feel any desire to look into it. He did not even get up when  his only servant--who envied the lot of the servants of Cornelius just  as bitterly as Boxtel did that of their master--entered his bedroom. He  said to the man,--    \"I shall not get up to-day, I am ill.\"    About nine o'clock he heard a great noise in the street which made him  tremble, at this moment he was paler than a real invalid, and shook more  violently than a man in the height of fever.    His servant entered the room; Boxtel hid himself under the counterpane.    \"Oh, sir!\" cried the servant, not without some inkling that, whilst  deploring the mishap which had befallen Van Baerle, he was announcing  agreeable news to his master,--\"oh, sir! you do not know, then, what is  happening at this moment?\"    \"How can I know it?\" answered Boxtel, with an almost unintelligible  voice.    \"Well, Mynheer Boxtel, at this moment your neighbour Cornelius van  Baerle is arrested for high treason.\"    \"Nonsense!\" Boxtel muttered, with a faltering voice; \"the thing is  impossible.\"    \"Faith, sir, at any rate that's what people say; and, besides, I have  seen Judge van Spennen with the archers entering the house.\"    \"Well, if you have seen it with your own eyes, that's a different case  altogether.\"    \"At all events,\" said the servant, \"I shall go and inquire once more. Be  you quiet, sir, I shall let you know all about it.\"    Boxtel contented himself with signifying his approval of the zeal of his  servant by dumb show.    The man went out, and returned in half an hour.    \"Oh, sir, all that I told you is indeed quite true.\"    \"How so?\"    \"Mynheer van Baerle is arrested, and has been put into a carriage, and  they are driving him to the Hague.\"    \"To the Hague!\"    \"Yes, to the Hague, and if what people say is true, it won't do him much  good.\"    \"And what do they say?\" Boxtel asked.    \"Faith, sir, they say--but it is not quite sure--that by this hour the  burghers must be murdering Mynheer Cornelius and Mynheer John de Witt.\"    \"Oh,\" muttered, or rather growled Boxtel, closing his eyes from the  dreadful picture which presented itself to his imagination.    \"Why, to be sure,\" said the servant to himself, whilst leaving the room,  \"Mynheer Isaac Boxtel must be very sick not to have jumped from his bed  on hearing such good news.\"    And, in reality, Isaac Boxtel was very sick, like a man who has murdered  another.    But he had murdered his man with a double object; the first was  attained, the second was still to be attained.    Night closed in. It was the night which Boxtel had looked forward to.    As soon as it was dark he got up.    He then climbed into his sycamore.    He had calculated correctly; no one thought of keeping watch over"]]]
