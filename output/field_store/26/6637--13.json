Then take one outlet wire, R, and connect to one  side of a 2-cp. electric lamp, and the other outlet wire, B, hold  in one hand, and press all fingers of the other hand on globe at  point A. A bright, blue light will come from the wires in the lamp  to the surface of the globe where the fingers touch. No shock will  be perceptible.        ** Interesting Electrical Experiment  [47]    The materials necessary for performing this experiment are:  Telephone receiver, transmitter, some wire and some carbons,  either the pencils for arc lamps, or ones taken from old dry  batteries will do.    Run a line from the inside of the house to the inside of some  other building and fasten it to one terminal of the receiver. To  the other terminal fasten another piece of wire and ground it on  the water faucet in the house. If there is no faucet in the house,  ground it with a large piece of zinc.    Fasten the other end to one terminal of the transmitter and from  the other terminal of the same run a wire into the ground. The  ground here should consist either of a large piece of carbon, or  several pieces bound tightly together.    [Illustration: A Unique Battery]    If a person speak into the transmitter, one at the receiver can  hear what is said, even though there are no batteries in the  circuit. It is a well known fact that two telephone receivers  connected up in this way will transmit words between two persons,  for the voice vibrating the diaphragm causes an inductive current  to flow and the other receiver copies these vibrations. But in  this experiment, a transmitter which induces no current is used.  Do the carbon and the zinc and the moist earth form a battery?  --Contributed by Wm. J.

A is a wooden block,  which is fastened under the loft at a gable end of the barn; B is  an iron weight attached to the string C, and this string passes up  through the barn to the roof, then over a hook or pulley and  across the barn, under the gable, and is fastened to the opposite  end of the barn.    D D are binding posts for electric wires. They have screw ends, as  shown, by which means they are fastened to the wooden block A.  They also hold the brass piece E and the strip of spring brass F  in place against the wooden block. G is a leather strap fastened  to the weight B and the spring F connected to the latter by a  small sink bolt.    [Illustration: Electric Fire Alarm]    At the house an electric bell is placed wherever convenient.  Several battery cells, of course, are also needed. Dry batteries  are most convenient. The battery cells and bell are connected in  the usual manner, and one wire from the bell and one from the  battery are strung to the barn and connected to the binding posts  D D.    If a fire occurs in the hay-mow the blaze will generally shoot  toward the gable soon after it starts, and will then burn the  string C, which allows the weight B to fall and pull the brass  spring against the iron piece E, which closes the circuit and  rings the bell in the house.    If desired, the string may be stretched back and forth under the  roof several times or drawn through any place that is in danger of  fire.  --Contributed by Geo. B.

Wrap a layer of  asbestos around it and cover this with a thin layer of  plaster-of-paris. When the plaster is nearly dry wind a coil of  No. 36 wire around it, taking care that the wire does not touch  itself anywhere. Put another course of plaster-of-paris on this,  and again wind the wire around it. Continue the process of  alternate layers of plaster and wire until 500 ft. or more of the  latter has been used, leaving about 10 in. at each end for  terminals. Then set the whole core away to dry.    For a base use a pine board 10 in. by 12 in. by 1 in. Bore four  holes at one end for binding-posts, as indicated by E E. Connect  the holes in pairs by ordinary house fuse wire. At one side secure  two receptacles, B B, and one single post switch, C. Place another  switch at I and another binding-post at F. The oven is now ready  to be connected.    Withdraw the wooden core from the coils of wire and secure the  latter by bands of tin to the board. Connect the ends of the wire  to binding-posts E and F, as shown. From the other set of  binding-posts, E, run a No. 12 or No. 14 wire, connecting lamp  receptacles, B B, and switch, C, in parallel. Connect these three  to switch, D, in series with binding-post, F, the terminal of the  coil. Place 16-cp. lights in the receptacles and connect the fuses  with a 110-volt lighting circuit. The apparatus is now ready for  operation. Turn on switch, D, and the lamps, while C is open. The  coil will commence to become warm, soon drying out the  plaster-of-paris. To obtain more heat    [Illustration: Electric Furnace]    open one lamp, and to obtain still more open the other and close  switch C.  --Contributed by Eugene Tuttles, Jr., Newark, Ohio.        ** How to Make an Ammeter [49]    Every amateur mechanic who performs electrical experiments will  find use for an ammeter, and for the benefit of those who wish to  construct such an instrument the following description is given:  The operative principle    [Illustration: Complete Ammeter and Details]    of this instrument is the same as that of a galvanometer, except  that its working position is not confined to the magnetic  meridian. This is accomplished by making the needle revolve in a  vertical instead of a horizontal plane. The only adjustment  necessary is that of leveling, which is accomplished by turning  the thumbscrew shown at A, Fig. 1, until the hand points to zero  on the scale.    First make a support, Fig. 2, by bending a piece of sheet brass to  the shape indicated and tapping for the screws CC. These should  have hollow ends, as shown, for the purpose of receiving the  pivoted axle which supports the hand. The core, Fig. 3, is made of  iron. It is 1 in. long, 1/4 in. wide and 1/8 in. thick. At a point  a little above the center, drill a hole as shown at H, and through  this hole drive a piece of knitting-needle about 1/2 in. long, or  long enough to reach between the two screws shown in Fig. 2. The  ends of this small axle should be ground pointed and should turn  easily in the cavities, as the sensitiveness of the instrument  depends on the ease with which this axle turns.    After assembling the core as shown in Fig. 4, it should be filed a  little at one end until it assumes the position indicated. The  pointer or hand, Fig. 5, is made of wire, aluminum being  preferable for this purpose, although copper or steel will do.  Make the wire 4-1/2 in. long and make a loop, D, 1/2 in. from the  lower end. Solder to the short end a piece of brass, E, of such  weight that it will exactly balance the weight of the hand. This  is slipped on the pivot, and the whole thing is again placed in  position in the support. If the pointer is correctly balanced it  should take the position shown in Fig. 1, but if it is not exactly  right a little filing will bring it near enough so that it may be  corrected by the adjusting-screw.    Next make a brass frame as shown in Fig. 6. This may be made of  wood, although brass is better, as the eddy currents set up in a  conductor surrounding a magnet tend to stop oscillation of the  magnet. (The core is magnetized when a current flows through the  instrument.) The brass frame is wound with magnet wire, the size  depending on the number of amperes to be measured. Mine is wound  with two layers of No. 14 wire, 10 turns to each layer, and is  about right for ordinary experimental purposes. The ends of the  wire are fastened to the binding posts B and C, Fig. 1.    A wooden box, D, is then made and provided with a glass front. A  piece of paper is pasted on a piece of wood, which is then  fastened in the box in such a position that the hand or pointer  will lie close to the paper scale. The box is 5-1/2 in. high, 4  in. wide and 1-3/4 in. deep, inside measurements. After everything  is assembled put a drop of solder on the loop at D, Fig. 5, to  prevent it turning on the axle.    To calibrate the instrument connect as shown in Fig. 7, where A is  the homemade ammeter; B, a standard ammeter; C, a variable  resistance, and D, a battery, consisting of three or more cells  connected in multiple. Throw in enough resistance to make the  standard instrument read 1 ohm [sic: ampere] and then put a mark  on the paper scale of the instrument to be calibrated. Continue in  this way with 2 amperes, 3 amperes, 4 amperes, etc., until the  scale is full. To make a voltmeter out of this instrument, wind  with plenty of No. 36 magnet wire instead of No. 14, or if it is  desired to make an instrument for measuring both volts and  amperes, use both windings and connect to two pairs of binding  posts.  --Contributed by J.E. Dussault, Montreal.        ** How to Make a Three-Way Cock for Small Model-Work [50]    [Illustration: Three-way Valve]    In making models of machines it is often necessary to contrive  some method for a 3- or 4-way valve or cock. To make one, secure a  pet cock and drill and tap hole through, as shown in the cut. If  for 3-way, drill in only to the opening already through, but if  for a 4-way, drill through the entire case and valve. Be sure to  have valve B turned so as to drill at right angles to the opening  through it. After drilling, remove the valve, take off the burr  with a piece of emery paper and replace ready for work.        ** Easy Experiments with Electric-Light"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12661"],[0,"Canada under British Rule 1760-1900 (#14)"],[1,"movement, when the large and influential loyal body of  people in the colonies ought to have been vigorously supported, and not  left exposed to the threats, insults, and even violence of a resolute  minority, comprising many persons influenced by purely selfish  reasons--the stoppage of illicit trade from which they had profited--as  well as men who objected on principle to a policy which seemed to them  irreconcilable with the rights of the people to the fullest possible  measure of local self-government. As it was, however, the insults and  injuries to British officials bound to obey the law, the shameless and  continuous rioting, the destruction of private property, the defiant  attitude of the opposition to England, had at last awakened the home  authorities to the dangers latent in the rebellious spirit that reckless  agitators had aroused in colonies for which England had sacrificed so  much of her blood and treasure when their integrity and dearest  interests were threatened by France. The port of Boston, where the  agitators were most influential and the most discreditable acts of  violence had taken place, was closed to trade; and important  modifications were made in the charter granted to Massachusetts by  William III in 1692. Another obnoxious act provided that persons  \"questioned for any acts in execution of the laws\" should be tried in  England--a measure intended to protect officials and soldiers in the  discharge of their duty against the rancour of the colonial community  where they might be at that time. These measures, undoubtedly unwise at  this juncture, were calculated to evoke the hostility of the other  colonies and to show them what was probably in store for themselves. But  while the issue certainly proved this to be the case, the course pursued  by the government under existing conditions had an appearance of  justification. Even Professor Goldwin Smith, who will not be accused of  any sympathy with the British cabinet of that day, or of antagonism to  liberal principles, admits that \"a government thus bearded and insulted  had its choice between abdication and repression,\" and \"that repression  was the most natural\" course to pursue under the circumstances. Lord  North gave expression to what was then a largely prevailing sentiment in  England when he said \"to repeal the tea duty would stamp us with  timidity,\" and that the destruction of the property of private  individuals, such as took place at Boston, \"was a fitting culmination of  years of riot and lawlessness.\" Lord North, we all know now, was really  desirous of bringing about a reconciliation between the colonies and the  parent state, but he servilely yielded his convictions to the king, who  was determined to govern all parts of his empire, and was in favour of  coercive measures. It is quite evident that the British ministry and  their supporters entirely underrated the strength of the colonial party  that was opposing England. Even those persons who, when the war broke  out, remained faithful to their allegiance to the crown, were of opinion  that the British government was pursuing a policy unwise in the extreme,  although they had no doubt of the abstract legal right of that  government to pass the Grenville and Townshend acts for taxing the  colonies. Chatham, Burke, Conway, and Barre were the most prominent  public men who, in powerful language, showed the dangers of the unwise  course pursued by the \"king's friends\" in parliament.    As we review the events of those miserable years we can see that every  step taken by the British government, from the stamp act until the  closing of the port of Boston and other coercive measures, had the  effect of strengthening the hands of Samuel Adams and the other  revolutionary agitators. Their measures to create a feeling against  England exhibited great cunning and skill. The revolutionary movement  was aided by the formation of \"Sons of Liberty\"--a phrase taken from one  of Barre's speeches,--by circular letters and committees of  correspondence between the colonies, by petitions to the king winch were  framed in a tone of independence not calculated to conciliate that  uncompromising sovereign, by clever ingenious appeals to public  patriotism, by the assembling of a \"continental congress,\" by acts of  \"association\" which meant the stoppage of all commercial intercourse  with Great Britain. New England was the head and front of the whole  revolution, and Samuel Adams was its animating spirit. Even those famous  committees of correspondence between the towns of Massachusetts, which  gave expression to public opinion and stimulated united action when the  legislative authority was prevented by the royal governor from working,  were the inspiration of this astute political manager. Prominent  Virginians saw the importance of carrying out this idea on a wider field  of action, and Virginia accordingly inaugurated a system of  intercolonial correspondence which led to the meeting of a continental  congress, and was the first practical step towards political  independence of the parent state. Adams's decision to work for  independence was made, or confirmed, as early as 1767, when Charles  Townshend succeeded in passing the measures which were so obnoxious to  the colonists, and finally led to civil war.    At a most critical moment, when the feelings of a large body of people  were aroused to a violent pitch, when ideas of independence were  ripening in the minds of others besides Samuel Adams, General Gage, then  in command of the British regular troops in Boston, sent a military  force to make prisoners of Adams and Hancock at Lexington, and seize  some stores at Concord. Then the \"embattled farmers\" fired the shot  \"which was heard around the world.\" Then followed the capture of  Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and the battle of Bunker's Hill, on the  same day that Washington was appointed by congress to command the  continental army. At this critical juncture, John Adams and other  prominent colonists--not excepting Washington--were actually disavowing  all desire to sever their relations with the parent state in the face of  the warlike attitude of congress--an attitude justified by the  declaration that it was intended to force a redress of grievances. Tom  Paine, a mere adventurer, who had not been long in the country, now  issued his pamphlet, \"Common Sense,\" which was conceived in a spirit  and written in a style admirably calculated to give strength and  cohesion to the arguments of the people, who had been for some time  coming to the conclusion that to aim at independence was the only  consistent and logical course in the actual state of controversy between  England and the colonies. On March 14th, 1776, the town of Boston, then  the most important in America, was given up to the rebels; and British  ships carried the first large body of unhappy and disappointed Loyalists  to Halifax. On July the fourth of the same year the Declaration of  Independence was passed, after much hesitation and discussion, and  published to the world by the continental congress assembled at  Philadelphia. The signal victory won by the continental army over  Burgoyne at Saratoga in the autumn of the following year led to an  alliance with France, without whose effective aid the eventual success  of the revolutionists would have been very doubtful The revolutionists  won their final triumph at Yorktown in the autumn of 1781, when a small  army of regulars and Loyalists, led by Cornwallis, was obliged to  surrender to the superior American and French forces, commanded by  Washington and Rochambeau, and supported by a French fleet which  effectively controlled the approaches to Chesapeake Bay.    The conduct of the war on the part of England was noted for the singular  incapacity of her generals. Had there been one of any energy or ability  at the head of her troops, when hostilities commenced, the undisciplined  American army might easily have been beaten and annihilated Boston need  never have been evacuated had Howe taken the most ordinary precautions  to occupy the heights of Dorchester that commanded the town. Washington  could never have organised an army had not Howe given him every possible  opportunity for months to do so. The British probably had another grand  opportunity of ending the war on their occupation of New York, when  Washington and his relatively insignificant army were virtually in their  power while in retreat. The history of the war is full of similar  instances of lost opportunities to overwhelm the continental troops. All  the efforts of the British generals appear to have been devoted to the  occupation of the important towns in a country stretching for a thousand  miles from north to south, instead of following and crushing the  constantly retreating, diminishing, and discouraged forces of the  revolutionists. The evacuation of Philadelphia at a critical moment of  the war was another signal illustration of the absence of all military  foresight and judgment, since it disheartened the Loyalists and gave up  an important base of operation against the South. Even Cornwallis, who  fought so bravely and successfully in the southern provinces, made a  most serious mistake when he chose so weak a position as Yorktown, which  was only defensible whilst the army of occupation had free access to the  sea. Admiral Rodney, then at St. Eustatius, is open to censure for not  having sent such naval reinforcements as would have enabled the British  to command Chesapeake Bay, and his failure in this respect explains the  inability of Clinton, an able general, to support Cornwallis in his hour  of need. The moment the French fleet appeared in the Chesapeake,  Cornwallis's position became perfectly untenable, and he was obliged to  surrender to the allied armies, who were vastly superior in number and  equipment to his small force, which had not even the advantage of  fighting"]]]
