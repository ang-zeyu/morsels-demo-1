Calyx of 6 short-lived  sepals; 6 to 9 rounded, flat petals; stamens as many as petals or  (usually) twice as many; 1 pistil, with a thick stigma. _Stem:_ 1 to  1-1/2 ft. high, from a long, running rootstock. _Leaves:_ Of flowerless  stems (from separate rootstock), solitary, on a long petiole from,  base, nearly 1 ft. across, rounded, centrally peltate, umbrella  fashion, 5 to 7 lobed, the lobes 2-cleft, dark above, light green  below. Leaves of flowering stem 1 to 3, usually a pair, similar to  others, but smaller. _Fruit:_ A fleshy, yellowish, egg-shaped,  many-seeded fruit about 2 in. long.    _Preferred Habitat_--Rich, moist woods.    _Flowering Season_--May.    _Distribution_--Quebec to the Gulf of Mexico, westward to Minnesota and  Texas.    In giving this plant its abridged scientific name, Linnaeus seemed to  see in its leaves a resemblance to a duck's foot _(Anapodophyllum);_ but  equally imaginative American children call them green umbrellas, and  declare they unfurl only during April showers. In July, a sweetly  mawkish many-seeded fruit, resembling a yellow egg-tomato, delights the  uncritical palates of the little people, who should be warned, however,  against putting any other part of this poisonous, drastic plant in their  mouths. Physicians best know its uses. Dr. Asa Gray's statement about  the harmless fruit \"eaten by pigs and boys\" aroused William Hamilton  Gibson, who had happy memories of his own youthful gorges on anything  edible that grew. \"Think of it, boys!\" he wrote; \"and think of what else  he says of it: 'Ovary ovoid, stigma sessile, undulate, seeds covering  the lateral placenta each enclosed in an aril.' Now it may be safe for  pigs and billygoats to tackle such a compound as that, but we boys all  like to know what we are eating, and I cannot but feel that the public  health officials of every township should require this formula of Doctor  Gray's to be printed on every one of these big loaded pills, if that is  what they are really made of.\"      Barberry; Pepperidge-bush    _Berberis vulgaris_    _Flowers_--Yellow, small, odor disagreeable, 6-parted, borne in  drooping, many-flowered racemes from the leaf axils along arching twigs.  _Stem_: A much-branched, smooth, gray shrub, 5 to 8 ft. tall, armed with  sharp spines. _Leaves_: From the 3-pronged spines (thorns); oval or  obovate, bristly edged. _Fruit_: Oblong, scarlet, acid berries.    _Preferred Habitat_--Thickets, roadsides, dry or gravelly soil.    _Flowering Season_--May-June.    _Distribution_--Naturalized in New England and Middle states; less  common in Canada and the West. Europe and Asia.    When the twigs of barberry bushes arch with the weight of clusters of  beautiful bright berries in September, every one must take notice of a  shrub so decorative, which receives scant attention from us, however,  when its insignificant little flowers are out.    In the barberry bushes, as in the gorse, when grown in dry, gravelly  situations, we see many leaves and twigs modified into thorns to  diminish the loss of water through evaporation by exposing too much leaf  surface to the sun and air. That such spines protect the plants which  bear them from the ravages of grazing cattle is, of course, an  additional motive for their presence. Under cultivation, in well-watered  garden soil--and how many charming varieties of barberries are  cultivated--the thorny shrub loses much of its armor, putting forth many  more leaves, in rosettes, along more numerous twigs, instead. Even the  prickly pear cactus might become mild as a lamb were it to forswear  sandy deserts and live in marshes instead. Country people sometimes rob  the birds of the acid berries to make preserves. The wood furnishes a  yellow dye.          POPPY FAMILY _(Papaveraceae)_      Bloodroot; Indian Paint; Red Puccoon    _Sanguinaria canadensis_    _Flowers_--Pure white, rarely pinkish, golden centred, 1 to 1-1/2 in.  across, solitary, at end of a smooth, naked scape 6 to 14 in. tall.  Calyx of 2 short-lived sepals; corolla of 8 to 12 oblong petals, early  falling; stamens numerous; 1 short pistil composed of 2 carpels.  _Leaves:_ Rounded, deeply and palmately lobed, the 5 to 9 lobes often  cleft. _Rootstock:_ Thick, several inches long, with fibrous roots, and  filled with orange-red juice.    _Preferred Habitat_--Rich woods and borders; low hillsides.    _Flowering Season_--April-May.    _Distribution_--Nova Scotia to Florida, westward to Nebraska.    Snugly protected in a papery sheath enfolding a silvery-green  leaf-cloak, the solitary erect bud slowly rises from its embrace, sheds  its sepals, expands into an immaculate golden-centred blossom that,  poppy-like, offers but a glimpse of its fleeting loveliness ere it drops  its snow-white petals and is gone. But were the flowers less ephemeral,  were we always certain of hitting upon the very time its colonies are  starring the woodland, would it have so great a charm? Here to-day, if  there comes a sudden burst of warm sunshine; gone to-morrow, if the  spring winds, rushing through the nearly leafless woods, are too rude to  the fragile petals--no blossom has a more evanescent beauty, none is  more lovely. After its charms have been displayed, up rises the circular  leaf-cloak on its smooth reddish petiole, unrolls, and at length  overtops the narrow, oblong seed-vessel. Wound the plant in any part,  and there flows an orange-red juice, which old-fashioned mothers used to  drop on lumps of sugar and administer when their children had coughs and  colds. As this fluid stains whatever it touches--hence its value to the  Indians as a war-paint--one should be careful in picking the flower. It  has no value for cutting, of course; but in some rich, shady corner of  the garden, a clump of the plants will thrive and bring a suggestive  picture of the spring woods to our very doors. It will be noticed that  plants having thick rootstock, corms, and bulbs, which store up food  during the winter, like the irises, Solomon's seals, bloodroot, adder's  tongue, and crocuses, are prepared to rush into blossom far earlier in  spring than fibrous-rooted species that must accumulate nourishment  after the season has opened.      Greater Celandine; Swallow-wort    _Chelidonium majus_    _Flowers_--Lustreless yellow, about 1/2 in. across, on slender pedicels,  in a small umbel-like cluster. Sepals 2, soon falling; 4 petals, many  yellow stamens, pistil prominent. _Stem:_ Weak, 1 to 2 ft. high,  branching, slightly hairy, containing bright orange acrid juice.  _Leaves:_ Thin, 4 to 8 in. long, deeply cleft into 5 (usually) irregular  oval lobes, the terminal one largest. _Fruit:_ Smooth, slender, erect  pods, 1 to 2 in. long, tipped with the persistent style.    _Preferred Habitat_--Dry waste land, fields, roadsides, gardens, near  dwellings.    _Flowering Season_--April-September.    _Distribution_--Naturalized from Europe in eastern United States.    Not this weak invader of our roadsides, whose four yellow petals suggest  one of the cross-bearing mustard tribe, but the pert little Lesser  Celandine, Pilewort, or Figwort Buttercup (_Ficaria Ficaria_), one of  the crowfoot family, whose larger solitary satiny yellow flowers so  commonly star European pastures, was Wordsworth's special delight--a  tiny, turf-loving plant, about which much poetical association clusters.  Having stolen passage across the Atlantic, it is now making itself at  home about College Point, Long Island; on Staten Island; near  Philadelphia, and maybe elsewhere. Doubtless it will one day overrun our  fields, as so many other European immigrants have done.    The generic Greek name of the greater celandine, meaning a swallow, was  given it because it begins to bloom when the first returning swallows  are seen skimming over the water and freshly ploughed fields in a  perfect ecstasy of flight, and continues in flower among its erect seed  capsules until the first cool days of autumn kill the gnats and small  winged insects not driven to cover. Then the swallows, dependent on such  fare, must go to warmer climes where plenty still fly. Quaint old  Gerarde claims that the Swallow-wort was so called because \"with this  herbe the dams restore eyesight to their young ones when their eye be  put out\" by swallows. Coles asserts \"the swallow cureth her dim eyes  with Celandine.\"          FUMITORY FAMILY _(Fumariaceae)_      Dutchman's Breeches; White Hearts; Soldier's Cap; Ear-drops    _Dicentra Cucullaria_    _Flowers_--White, tipped with yellow, nodding in a 1-sided raceme. Two  scale-like sepals; corolla of 4 petals, in 2 pairs, somewhat cohering  into a heart-shaped, flattened, irregular flower, the outer pair of  petals extended into 2 widely spread spurs, the small inner petals  united above; 6 stamens in 2 sets; style slender, with a 2-lobed stigma.  _Scape: 5_ to 10 in. high, smooth, from a bulbous root. _Leaves:_ Finely  cut, thrice compound, pale beneath, on slender petioles, all from base.    _Preferred Habitat_--Rich, rocky woods.    _Flowering Season_--April-May.    _Distribution_--Nova Scotia to the Carolinas, west to Nebraska.    Rich leaf mould, accumulated between crevices of rock, makes the ideal  home of this delicate yet striking flower, coarse-named, but refined in  all its parts. Consistent with the dainty, heart-shaped blossoms that  hang trembling along the slender stem like pendants from a lady's ear,  are the finely dissected, lace-like leaves, the whole plant repudiating  by its femininity its most popular name. It was Thoreau who observed  that only those plants which require but little light, and can stand the  drip of trees, prefer to dwell in the woods--plants which have commonly  more beauty in their leaves than in their pale and almost colorless"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8909"],[0,"The System of Nature, or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World. Volume 1 (#13)"],[1,"ce. Therefore it is in his  imagination, only, man finds a model of that which he terms order or  confusion; which, like all his abstract, metaphysical ideas, supposes  nothing beyond his reach. Order, however, is never more than the faculty  of conforming himself with the beings by whom he is environed, or with  the whole of which he forms a part.    Nevertheless, if the idea of order be applied to Nature, it will be  found to be nothing but a series of action or motion, which he judges  to conspire to one common end. Thus, in a body that moves, order is the  chain of action, the series of motion, proper to constitute it what it  is, and to maintain it in its actual state. Order, relatively to the  whole of Nature, is the concatenation of causes and effects, necessary  to her _active_ existence--to maintaining her constantly together; but,  as it has been proved in the chapter preceding, every individual being  is obliged to concur to this end, in the different ranks they occupy;  from whence it is a necessary deduction, that what is called the ORDER  OF NATURE, can never be more than a certain manner of considering the  necessity of things, to which all, of which man has any knowledge, is  submitted. That which is styled CONFUSION, is only a relative term, used  to designate that series of necessary action, that chain of requisite  motion, by which an individual being is necessarily changed or disturbed  in its mode of existence--by which it is instantaneously obliged to  alter its manner of action; but no one of these actions, no part of  this motion is capable, even for a single instant, of contradicting  or deranging the general order of Nature; from which all beings derive  their existence, their properties, the motion appropriate to each.    What is termed confusion in a being, is nothing more than its passage  into a new class, a new mode of existence; which necessarily carries  with it a new series of action, a new chain of motion, different from  that of which this being found itself susceptible in the preceding  rank it occupied. That which is called order, in Nature, is a mode of  existence, or a disposition of its particles, strictly _necessary_. In  every other assemblage of causes and effects, of worlds, as well as  in that which we inhabit, some sort of arrangement, some kind of order  would necessarily be established. Suppose the most incongruous, the  most heterogeneous substances were put into activity, and assembled by  a concatenation of extraordinary circumstances; they would form amongst  themselves, a complete order, a perfect arrangement. This is the true  notion of a property, which may be defined, an aptitude to constitute a  being, such as it is actually found, such as it is with respect to the  whole of which it makes a part.    Order, then, is nothing but necessity, considered relatively to the  series of actions, or the connected chain of causes and effects, that  it produces in the universe. What is the motion in our planetary system;  but a series of phenomena, operated upon according to necessary laws,  that regulate the bodies of which it is composed? In conformity to these  laws, the sun occupies the centre; the planets gravitate towards it, and  revolve round it, in regulated periods: the satellites of these planets  gravitate towards those which are in the centre of their sphere of  action, and describe round them their periodical route. One of these  planets, the earth which man inhabits, turns on its own axis; and by the  various aspects which its revolution obliges it to present to the sun,  experiences those regular variations which are called SEASONS. By a  sequence of the sun's action upon different parts of this globe, all its  productions undergo vicissitudes: plants, animals, men, are in a sort of  morbid drowsiness during _Winter_: in _Spring_, these beings re-animate,  to come as it were out of a long lethargy. In short, the mode in  which the earth receives the sun's beams, has an influence on all its  productions; these rays, when darted obliquely, do not act in the same  manner as when they fall perpendicularly; their periodical absence,  caused by the revolution of this sphere on itself, produces _night_ and  _day_. However, in all this, man never witnesses more than necessary  effects, flowing from the nature of things, which, whilst that remains  the same, can never be opposed with propriety. These effects are owing  to gravitation, attraction, centrifugal power, &c.    On the other hand, this _order_, which man admires as a supernatural  effect, is sometimes disturbed, or changed into what he calls  _confusion_: this confusion is, however, always a necessary consequence  of the laws of Nature; in which it is requisite to the support of the  whole that some of her parts should be deranged and thrown out of the  ordinary course. It is thus, COMETS present themselves so unexpectedly  to man's wondering eyes; their eccentric motion disturbs the  tranquillity of his planetary system; they excite the terror of the  misinstructed to whom every thing unusual is marvellous. The natural  philosopher, himself, conjectures that in former ages, these comets  have overthrown the surface of this mundane ball, and caused great  revolutions on the earth. Independent of this extraordinary _confusion_,  he is exposed to others more familiar to him: sometimes, the seasons  appear to have usurped each other's place; to have quitted their regular  order: sometimes the opposing elements seem to dispute among themselves  the dominion of the world; the sea bursts its limits; the solid earth  is shaken and rent asunder; mountains are in a state of conflagration;  pestilential diseases destroy both men and animals; sterility desolates  a country: then affrighted man utters piercing cries, offers up his  prayers to recall order; tremblingly raises his hands towards the Being  he supposes to be the author of all these calamities; nevertheless, the  whole of this afflicting confusion are necessary effects, produced by  natural causes; which act according to fixed laws, determined by their  own peculiar essence, and the universal essence of Nature: in which  every thing must necessarily be changed, moved, and dissolved; where  that which is called ORDER, must sometimes be disturbed and altered into  a new mode of existence; which to his deluded mind, to his imagination,  led astray by ignorance and want of reflection, appears CONFUSION.    There cannot possibly exist what is generally termed _a confusion of  Nature_: man finds order in every thing that is conformable to his  own mode of being; confusion in every thing by which it is opposed:  nevertheless, in Nature, all is in order; because none of her parts are  ever able to emancipate themselves from those invariable rules which  flow from their respective essences: there _is_ not, there _cannot_  be confusion in a whole, to the maintenance of which what is _called_  confusion is absolutely requisite; of which the general course can never  be discomposed, although individuals may be, and necessarily are; where  all the effects produced are the consequence of natural causes, that  under the circumstances in which they are placed, act only as they  infallibly are obliged to act.    It therefore follows, there can be neither monsters nor prodigies;  wonders nor miracles in Nature: those which are designated MONSTERS, are  certain combinations, with which the eyes of man are not familiarized;  but which, therefore, are not less the necessary effects of natural  causes. Those which he terms PRODIGIES, WONDERS, or SUPERNATURAL  effects, are phenomena of Nature, with whose mode of action he is  unacquainted; of which his ignorance does not permit him to ascertain  the principles; whose causes he cannot trace; but which his impatience,  his heated imagination, aided by a desire to explain, makes him  foolishly attribute to imaginary causes; which, like the idea of order,  have no existence but in himself; and which, that he may conceal his  own ignorance, that he may obtain more respect with the uninformed,  he places beyond Nature, out of which his experience is every instant  demonstrably proving that none of these things can have existence.    As for those effects which are called MIRACLES, that is to say, contrary  to the unalterable laws of Nature, it must be felt such things are  impossible; because, nothing can, for an instant, suspend the necessary  course of beings, without the whole of Nature was arrested; without  she was disturbed in her tendency. There have neither been wonders nor  miracles in Nature; except for those, who have not sufficiently studied  the laws, who consequently do not feel, that those laws can never be  contradicted, even in the most minute parts, without the whole being  destroyed, or at least without changing her essence, her mode of action;  that it is the height of folly to recur to supernatural causes to  explain the phenomena man beholds, before he becomes fully acquainted  with natural causes--with the powers and capabilities which Nature  herself contains.    _Order_ and _Confusion_, then, are only relative terms, by which man  designates the state in which particular beings find themselves. He  says, a being is in order, when all the motion it undergoes conspires to  favor its tendency to its own preservation; when it is conducive to the  maintenance of its actual existence: that it is in confusion when the  causes which move it disturb the harmony of its existence, or have a  tendency to destroy the equilibrium necessary to the conservation of its  actual state. Nevertheless, confusion, as we have shown, is nothing but  the passage of a being into a new order; the more rapid the progress,  the greater the confusion for the being that is submitted to it: that  which conducts man to what is called death, is, for him, the greatest  of all possible confusion. Yet this death is nothing more than a"]]]
