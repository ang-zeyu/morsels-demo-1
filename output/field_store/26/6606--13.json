The people whom he had sent to explore the spot reported that  the approach to the castle was very difficult, and in truth impossible.  Many urged the king to change his purpose in the matter; but he cried,  'Nay, what we resolved on at Laon stands: I would not hold back  therefrom, though it were to save my life.  The king's majesty would be  vilified, if I were to fly before this scoundrel.'  Forthwith, in spite  of his corpulence, and with admirable ardor, he pushed on with his troops  through ravines and roads encumbered with forests.  .  .  .  Thomas, made  prisoner and mortally wounded, was brought to King Louis, and by his  order removed to Laon, to the almost universal satisfaction of his own  folk and ours.  Next day, his lands were sold for the benefit of the  public treasury, his ponds were broken up, and King Louis, sparing the  country because he had the lord of it at his disposal, took the road back  to Laon, and afterwards returned in triumph to Paris.\"    Sometimes, when the people, and their habitual protectors, the bishops,  invoked his aid, Louis would carry his arms beyond his own dominions, by  sole right of justice and kingship.  It is known,\" says Suger, \"that  kings have long hands.\"  In 1121, the Bishop of Clermont-Ferrand made a  complaint to the king against William VI., Count of Auvergne, who had  taken possession of the town, and even of the episcopal church, and was  exercising therein \"unbridled tyranny.\"  The king, who never lost a  moment when there was a question of helping the Church, took up with  pleasure and solemnity what was, under these circumstances, the cause of  God; and having been unable, either by word of mouth or by letters sealed  with the seal of the king's majesty, to bring back the tyrant to his  duty, he assembled his troops, and led into revolted Auvergne a numerous  army of Frenchmen.  He had now become exceeding fat, and could scarce  support the heavy mass of his body.  Any one else, however humble, would  have had neither the will nor the power to ride a-horseback; but he,  against the advice of all his friends, listened only to the voice of  courage, braved the fiery suns of June and August, which were the dread  of the youngest knights, and made a scoff of those who could not bear the  heat, although many a time, during the passage of narrow and difficult  swampy places, he was constrained to get himself held on by those about  him.\"  After an obstinate struggle, and at the intervention of William  VII., Duke of Aquitaine, the Count of Auvergne's suzerain, \"Louis fixed a  special day for regulating and deciding, in parliament, at Orleans, and  in the duke's presence, between the bishop and the count, the points to  which the Auvergnats had hitherto refused to subscribe.  Then  triumphantly leading back his army, he returned victoriously to France.\"  He had asserted his power, and increased his ascendency, without any  pretension to territorial aggrandizement.    [Illustration: Louis the Fat on an Expedition----69]    Into his relations with his two powerful neighbors, the King of England,  Duke of Normandy, and the Emperor of Germany, Louis the Fat introduced  the same watchfulness, the same firmness, and, at need, the same warlike  energy, whilst observing the same moderation, and the same policy of  holding aloof from all turbulent or indiscreet ambition, adjusting his  pretensions to his power, and being more concerned to govern his kingdom  efficiently than to add to it by conquest.  Twice, in 1109 and in 1118,  he had war in Normandy with Henry I., King of England, and he therein was  guilty of certain temerities resulting in a reverse, which he hastened to  repair during a vigorous prosecution of the campaign; but, when once his  honor was satisfied, he showed a ready inclination for the peace which  the Pope, Calixtus II., in council at Rome, succeeded in establishing  between the two rivals.  The war with the Emperor of Germany, Henry V.,  in 1124, appeared, at the first blush, a more serious matter.  The  emperor had raised a numerous army of Lorrainers, Allemannians,  Bavarians, Suabians, and Saxons, and was threatening the very city of  Rheims with instant attack.  Louis hastened to put himself in position;  he went and took solemnly, at the altar of  St. Denis, the banner of that  patron of the kingdom, and flew with a mere handful of men to confront  the enemy, and parry the first blow, calling on the whole of France to  follow him.  France summoned the flower of her chivalry; and when the  army had assembled from every quarter of the kingdom at Rheims, there was  seen, says Suger, \"so great a host of knights and men a-foot, that they  might have been compared to swarms of grasshoppers covering the face of  the earth, not only on the banks of the rivers, but on the mountains and  over the plains.\"  This multitude was formed in three divisions.  The  third division was composed of Orleanese, Parisians, the people of  Etampes, and those of  St. Denis; and at their head was the king in  person: \"With them,\" said he, \"I shall fight bravely and with good  assurance; besides being protected by the saint, my liege lord, I have  here of my country-men those who nurtured me with peculiar affection, and  who, of a surety, will back me living, or carry me off dead, and save my  body.\"  At news of this mighty host, and the ardor with which they were  animated, the Emperor Henry V. advanced no farther, and, before long,  \"marching, under some pretext, towards other places, he preferred the  shame of retreating like a coward to the risk of exposing his empire and  himself to certain destruction.  After this victory, which was more than  as great as a triumph on the field of battle, the French returned, every  one, to their homes.\"    The three elements which contributed to the formation and character of  the kingship in France,--the German element, the Roman element, and the  Christian element,--appear in con-junction in the reign of Louis the Fat.  We have still the warrior-chief of a feudal society founded by conquest  in him who, in spite of his moderation and discretion, cried many a time,  says Suger, \"What a pitiable state is this of ours, to never have  knowledge and strength both together!  In my youth had knowledge, and in  my old age had strength been mine, I might have conquered many kingdoms;  \"and probably from this exclamation of a king in the twelfth century came  the familiar proverb, \"If youth but knew, and age could do!  \"We see the  maxims of the Roman empire and reminiscences of Charlemagne in Louis's  habit of considering justice to emanate from the king as fountain head,  and of believing in his right to import it everywhere.  And what  conclusion of a reign could be more Christian-like than his when,  \"exhausted by the long enfeeblement of his wasted body, but disdaining to  die ignobly or unpreparedly, he called about him pious men, bishops,  abbots, and many priests of holy Church; and then, scorning all false  shame, he demanded to make his confession devoutly before them all, and  to fortify himself against death by the comfortable sacrament of the body  and blood of Christ!  Whilst everything is being arranged, the king on a  sudden rises, of himself, dresses himself, issues, fully clad, from his  chamber, to the wonderment of all, advances to meet the body of our Lord  Jesus Christ, and prostrates himself in reverence.  Thereupon, in the  presence of all, cleric and laic, he lays aside his kingship, deposes  himself from the government of the state, confesses the sin of having  ordered it ill, hands to his son Louis the king's ring, and binds him to  promise, on oath, to protect the Church of God, the poor, and the orphan,  to respect the rights of everybody, and to keep none prisoner in his  court, save such a one as should have actually transgressed in the court  itself.\"    This king, so well prepared for death, in his last days found great cause  for rejoicing as a father.  William VII., Duke of Aquitaine, had, at his  death, intrusted to him the guardianship of his daughter Eleanor, heiress  of all his dominions, that is to say, of Poitou, of Saintonge, of  Gascony, and of the Basque country, the most beautiful provinces of the  south-west of France, from the lower Loire to the Pyrenees.  A marriage  between Eleanor and Louis the Young, already sharing his father's throne,  was soon concluded; and a brilliant embassy, composed of more than five  hundred lords and noble knights, to whom the king had added his intimate  adviser, Suger, set out for Aquitaine, where the ceremony was to take  place.  At the moment of departure the king had them all assembled about  him, and, addressing himself to his son, said, \"May the strong hand of  God Almighty, by whom kings reign, protect thee, my dear son, both thee  and thine!  If, by any mischance, I were to lose thee, thee and those I  send with thee, neither my life, nor my kingdom would thenceforth be  aught to me.\"  The marriage took place at Bordeaux, at the end of July,  1137, and, on the 8th of August following, Louis the Young, on his way  back to Paris, was crowned at Poitiers as Duke of Aquitaine.  He there  learned that the king, his father, had lately died, on the 1st of August.  Louis the Fat was far from foreseeing the deplorable issues of the  marriage, which he regarded as one of the blessings of his reign.    In spite of its long duration of forty-three years, the reign of Louis  VII., called the Young, was a period barren of events and of persons  worthy of keeping a place in history.  We have already had the story of  this king's unfortunate crusade "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11953"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 3 (#14)"],[1,"nor  refuse, could only partially cloak his weakness by imputing the crime to  some disorderly youngsters whom he enabled to get away.  On the 20th of  August an angry mob collected in front of the Chatelet, shouting out that  nobody would bring the Armagnacs to justice, and that they were every day  being set at liberty on payment of money.  The great and little Chatelet  were stormed, and the prisoners massacred.  The mob would have liked to  serve the Bastille the same; but the duke told the rioters that he would  give the prisoners up to them if they would engage to conduct them to the  Chatelet without doing them any harm, and, to win them over, he grasped  the hand of their head man, who was no other than Capeluche, the city  executioner.  Scarcely had they arrived at the court-yard of the little  Chatelet when the prisoners were massacred there without any regard for  the promise made to the duke.  He sent for the most distinguished  burgesses, and consulted them as to what could be done to check such  excesses; but they confined themselves to joining him in deploring them.  He sent for the savages once more, and said to them, \"You would do far  better to go and lay siege to Montlhery, to drive off the king's enemies,  who have come ravaging everything up to the St. Jacques gate, and  preventing the harvest from being got in.\"  \"Readily,\" they answered,  \"only give us leaders.\"  He gave them leaders, who led six thousand of  them to Montlhery.  As soon as they were gone Duke John had Capeluche and  two of his chief accomplices brought to trial, and Capeluche was beheaded  in the market-place by his own apprentice.  But the gentry sent to the  siege of Montlhery did not take the place; they accused their leaders of  having betrayed them, and returned to be a scourge to the neighborhood of  Paris, everywhere saying that the Duke of Burgundy was the most  irresolute man in the kingdom, and that if there were no nobles the war  would be ended in a couple of months.  Duke John set about negotiating  with the _dauphin_ and getting him back to Paris.  The _dauphin_ replied  that he was quite ready to obey and serve his mother as a good son  should, but that it would be more than he could stomach to go back to a  city where so many crimes and so much tyranny had but lately been  practised.  Terms of reconciliation were drawn up and signed on the 16th  of September, 1418, at St. Maur, by the queen, the Duke of Burgundy, and  the pope's legates; but the _dauphin_ refused to ratify them.  The  unpunished and long-continued massacres in Paris had redoubled his  distrust towards the Duke of Burgundy; he had, moreover, just assumed the  title of regent of the kingdom; and he had established at Poitiers a  parliament, of which Juvenal des Ursins was a member.  He had promised  the young Count of Armagnac to exact justice for his father's cruel  death; and the old friends of the house of Orleans remained faithful to  their enmities.  The Duke of Burgundy had at one time to fight, and at  another to negotiate with the _dauphin_ and the King of England, both at  once, and always without success.  The _dauphin_ and his council, though  showing a little more discretion, were going on in the same alternative  and unsatisfactory condition.  Clearly neither France and England nor the  factions in France had yet exhausted their passions or their powers; and  the day of summary vengeance was nearer than that of real reconciliation.    Nevertheless, complicated, disturbed and persistently resultless  situations always end by becoming irksome to those who are entangled in  them, and by inspiring a desire for extrication.  The King of England, in  spite of his successes and his pride, determined upon sending the Earl of  Warwick to Provins, where the king and the Duke of Burgundy still were: a  truce was concluded between the English and the Burgundians, and it was  arranged that on the 30th of May, 1419, the two kings should meet between  Mantes and Melun, and hold a conference for the purpose of trying to  arrive at a peace.  A few days before the time, Duke John set out from  Provins with the king, Queen Isabel, and Princess Catherine, and repaired  first of all to Pontoise, and then to the place fixed for the interview,  on the borders of the Seine, near Meulan, where two pavilions had been  prepared, one for the King of France and the other for the King of  England.  Charles VI., being ill, remained at Pontoise.  Queen Isabel,  Princess Catherine, and the Duke of Burgundy arrived at the appointed  spot.  Henry V. was already there; he went to meet the queen, saluted  her, took her hand, and embraced her and Madame Catherine as well; Duke  John slightly bent his knee to the king, who raised him up and embraced  him likewise.  This solemn interview was succeeded by several others to  which Princess Catherine did not come.  The queen requested the King of  England to state exactly what he proposed; and he demanded the execution  of the treaty of Bretigny, the cession of Normandy, and the absolute  sovereignty, without any bond of vassalage, of whatever should be ceded  by the treaty.  A short discussion ensued upon some secondary questions.  There appeared to be no distant probability of an understanding.  The  English believed that they saw an inclination on the Duke of Burgundy's  part not to hasten to a conclusion, and to obtain better conditions from  King Henry by making him apprehensive of a reconciliation with the  _dauphin_.  Henry proposed to him, for the purpose of ending everything,  a conference between themselves alone; and it took place on the 3d of  June.  \"Cousin,\" said the king to the duke, \"we wish you to know that we  will have your king's daughter, and all that we have demanded with her;  else we will thrust him out of his kingdom, and you too.\"  \"Sir,\"  answered the duke, \"you speak according to your pleasure; but before  thrusting my lord and myself from the kingdom you will have what will  tire you, we make no doubt, and you will have enough to do to keep  yourself in your own island.\"  Between two princes so proud there was  little probability of an understanding; and they parted with no other  result than mutual displeasure.    Some days before, on the 14th of May, 1419, a truce of three months had  been concluded between the _dauphin_ and the Duke of Burgundy, and was to  lead to a conference also between these two princes.  It did not commence  before the 8th of July.  During this interval, Duke John had submitted  for the mature deliberation of his council the question whether it were  better to grant the English demands, or become reconciled to the  _dauphin_.  Amongst his official councillors opinions were divided; but,  in his privacy, the lady of Giac, \"whom he loved and trusted mightily,\"  and Philip Jossequin, who had at first been his chamber attendant, and  afterwards custodian of his jewels and of his privy seal, strongly urged  him to make peace with the _dauphin_; and the pope's fresh legate, the  Bishop of Laon, added his exhortations to these home influences.  There  had been fitted up at a league's distance from Melun, on the embankment  of the ponds of Vert, a summer-house of branches and leaves, hung with  drapery and silken stuffs; and there the first interview between the two  princes took place.  The _dauphin_ left in displeasure; he had found the  Duke of Burgundy haughty and headstrong.  Already the old servants of the  late Duke of Orleans, impelled by their thirst for vengeance, were saying  out loud that the matter should be decided by arms, when the lady of Giac  went after the _dauphin_, who from infancy had also been very much  attached to her, and she, going backwards and forwards between the two  princes, was so affectionate and persuasive with both that she prevailed  upon them to meet again, and to sincerely wish for an understanding.  The  next day but one they returned to the place of meeting, attended, each of  them, by a large body of men-at-arms.  They advanced towards one another  with ten men only, and dismounted.  The Duke of Burgundy went on bended  knee.  The _dauphin_ took him by the hand, embraced him, and would have  raised him up.  \"No, my lord,\" said the duke; \"I know how I ought to  address you.\"  The _dauphin_ assured him that he forgave every offence,  if indeed he had received any, and added, \"Cousin, if in the proposed  treaty between us there be aught which is not to your liking, we desire  that you amend it, and henceforth we will desire all you shall desire;  make no doubt of it.\"  They conversed for some time with every appearance  of cordiality; and then the treaty was signed.  It was really a treaty of  reconciliation, in which, without dwelling upon \"the suspicions and  imaginings which have been engendered in the hearts of ourselves and many  of our officers, and have hindered us from acting with concord in the  great matters of my lord the king and his kingdom, and resisting the  damnable attempts of his and our old enemies,\" the two princes made  mutual promises, each in language suitable to their rank and connection,  \"to love one another, support one another, and serve one another  mutually, as good and loyal relatives, and bade all their servants, if  they saw any hinderance thereto, to give them notice thereof, according  to their bounden duty.\"  The treaty was signed by all the men of note  belonging to the houses of both princes; and the crowd which surrounded  them shouted \"Noel!\" and invoked curses on whosoever should be minded  henceforth to take up arms again in this damnable quarrel.  When the  _dauphin_ went away, the duke insisted upon holding his stirrup, and they  parted with every demonstration of amity.  The _dauphin_ returned to  Touraine, and the duke to Pontoise, to be near the king, who, by letters  of July 19, confirmed the treaty, enjoined general forgetfulness of the  past, and ordained that \"all war should"]]]
