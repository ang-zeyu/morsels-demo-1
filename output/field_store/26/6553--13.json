As to the organization and functions of the League of Nations planned by  Mr. Wilson there was little that appealed to one who was opposed to the  employment of force in compelling the observance of international  obligations and to the establishment of an international oligarchy of  the Great Powers to direct and control world affairs. The basic  principle of the plan was that the strong should, as a matter of right  recognized by treaty, possess a dominant voice in international  councils. Obviously the principle of the equality of nations was ignored  or abandoned. In the face of the repeated declarations of the Government  of the United States in favor of the equality of independent states as  to their rights in times of peace, this appeared to be a reversal of  policy which it would be difficult, if not impossible, to explain in a  satisfactory way. Personally I could not subscribe to this principle  which was so destructive of the American theory of the proper relations  between nations.    It was manifest, when I read the President's plan, that there was no  possible way to harmonize my ideas with it. They were fundamentally  different. There was no common basis on which to build. To attempt to  bring the two theories into accord would have been futile. I, therefore,  told Colonel House that it was useless to try to bring into accord the  two plans, since they were founded on contradictory principles and that  the only course of procedure open to me was to present my views to the  President in written form, hoping that he would give them consideration,  although fearing that his mind was made up, since he had ordered his  plan to be printed.    In the afternoon of the same day (January 7), on which I informed the  Colonel of the impossibility of harmonizing and uniting the two plans,  President Wilson held a conference with the American Commissioners  during which he declared that he considered the affirmative guaranty  absolutely necessary to the preservation of future peace and the only  effective means of preventing war. Before this declaration could be  discussed M. Clemenceau was announced and the conference came to an end.  While the President did not refer in any way to the \"self-denying  covenant\" which I had proposed as a substitute, it seemed to me that he  intended it to be understood that the substitute was rejected, and that  he had made the declaration with that end in view. This was the nearest  approach to an answer to my letter of December 23 that I ever received.  Indirect as it was the implication was obvious.    Although the settled purpose of the President to insist on his form of  mutual guaranty was discouraging and his declaration seemed to be  intended to close debate on the subject, I felt that no effort should be  spared to persuade him to change his views or at least to leave open an  avenue for further consideration. Impelled by this motive I gave to the  President the articles which I had drafted and asked him if he would be  good enough to read them and consider the principles on which they were  based. The President with his usual courtesy of manner smilingly  received them. Whether or not he ever read them I cannot state  positively because he never mentioned them to me or, to my knowledge, to  any one else. I believe, however, that he did read them and realized  that they were wholly opposed to the theory which he had evolved,  because from that time forward he seemed to assume that I was hostile to  his plan for a League of Nations. I drew this conclusion from the fact  that he neither asked my advice as to any provision of the Covenant nor  discussed the subject with me personally. In many little ways he showed  that he preferred to have me direct my activities as a Commissioner into  other channels and to keep away from the subject of a League. The  conviction that my counsel was unwelcome to Mr. Wilson was, of course,  not formed at the time that he received the articles drafted by me. It  only developed after some time had elapsed, during which incidents took  place that aroused a suspicion which finally became a conviction.  Possibly I was over-sensitive as to the President's treatment of my  communications to him. Possibly he considered my advice of no value,  and, therefore, unworthy of discussion. But, in view of his letter of  February 11, 1920, it must be admitted that he recognized that I was  reluctant in accepting certain of his views at Paris, a recognition  which arose from my declared opposition to them. Except in the case of  the Shantung settlement, there was none concerning which our judgments  were so at variance as they were concerning the League of Nations. I  cannot believe, therefore, that I was wrong in my conclusion as to  his attitude.    On the two days succeeding the one when I handed the President my draft  of articles I had long conferences with Lord Robert Cecil and Colonel  House. Previous to these conferences, or at least previous to the second  one, I examined Lord Robert's plan for a League. His plan was based on  the proposition that the Supreme War Council, consisting of the Heads of  States and the Secretaries and Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Five  Great Powers, should be perpetuated as a permanent international body  which should meet once a year and discuss subjects of common interest.  That is, he proposed the formation of a Quintuple Alliance which would  constitute itself primate over all nations and the arbiter in world  affairs, a scheme of organization very similar to the one proposed by  General Smuts.    Lord Robert made no attempt to disguise the purpose of his plan. It was  intended to place in the hands of the Five Powers the control of  international relations and the direction in large measure of the  foreign policies of all nations. It was based on the power to compel  obedience, on the right of the powerful to rule. Its chief merit was its  honest declaration of purpose, however wrong that purpose might appear  to those who denied that the possession of superior might conferred  special rights upon the possessor. It seemed to provide for a rebirth of  the Congress of Vienna which should be clothed in the modern garb of  democracy. It could only be interpreted as a rejection of the principle  of the equality of nations. Its adoption would mean that the destiny of  the world would be in the hands of a powerful international oligarchy  possessed of dictatorial powers.    There was nothing idealistic in the plan of Lord Robert Cecil, although  he was reputed to be an idealist favoring a new international order. An  examination of his plan (Appendix) shows it to be a substantial revival  of the old and discredited ideas of a century ago. There could be no  doubt that a plan of this sort, materialistic and selfish as it was,  would win the approval and cordial support of M. Clemenceau, since it  fitted in with his public advocacy of the doctrine of \"the balance of  power.\" Presumably the Italian delegates would not be opposed to a  scheme which gave Italy so influential a voice in international affairs,  while the Japanese, not averse to this recognition of their national  power and importance, would unquestionably favor an alliance of this  nature. I think that it is fair to assume that all of the Five Great  Powers would have readily accepted the Cecil plan--all except the  United States.    This plan, however, did not meet with the approval of President Wilson,  and his open opposition to it became an obstacle which prevented its  consideration in the form in which it was proposed. It is a matter of  speculation what reasons appealed to the President and caused him to  oppose the plan, although the principle of primacy found application in  a different and less radical form in his own plan of organization.  Possibly he felt that the British statesman's proposal too frankly  declared the coalition and oligarchy of the Five Powers, and that there  should be at least the appearance of cooperation on the part of the  lesser nations. Of course, in view of the perpetual majority of the Five  Powers on the Executive Council, as provided in the President's plan,  the primacy of the Five was weakened little if at all by the minority  membership of the small nations. The rule of unanimity gave to each  nation a veto power, but no one believed that one of the lesser states  represented on the Council would dare to exercise it if the Great Powers  were unanimous in support of a proposition. In theory unanimity was a  just and satisfactory rule; in practice it would amount to nothing. The  President may also have considered the council proposed by Lord Robert  to be inexpedient in view of the political organization of the United  States. The American Government had no actual premier except the  President, and it seemed out of the question for him to attend an annual  meeting of the proposed council. It would result in the President  sending a personal representative who would unavoidably be in a  subordinate position when sitting with the European premiers. I think  this latter reason was a very valid one, but that the first one, which  seemed to appeal especially to the President, had little real merit.    In addition to his objection to the Cecil plan of administration,  another was doubtless of even greater weight to Mr. Wilson and that was  the entire omission in the Cecil proposal of the mutual guaranty of  political independence and territorial integrity. The method of  preventing wars which was proposed by Lord Robert was for the nations to  enter into a covenant to submit disputes to international investigation  and to obtain a report before engaging in hostilities and also a  covenant not to make war on a disputant nation which accepted a report  which had been unanimously adopted. He further proposed that the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10477"],[0,"Beacon Lights of History, Volume 01: The Old Pagan Civilizations (#14)"],[1," domestic life.    Demeter (Roman Ceres) represented Mother Earth, and thus was closely  associated with agriculture and all operations of tillage and  bread-making. As agriculture is the primitive and most important of all  human vocations, this deity presided over civilization and law-giving,  and occupied an important position in the Eleusinian mysteries.    These were the twelve Olympian divinities, or greater gods; but they  represent only a small part of the Grecian Pantheon. There was Dionysus  (Roman Bacchus), the god of drunkenness. This deity presided over  vineyards, and his worship was attended with disgraceful orgies,--with  wild dances, noisy revels, exciting music, and frenzied demonstrations.    Leto (Roman Latona), another wife of Zeus, and mother of Apollo and  Diana, was a very different personage from Hera, being the impersonation  of all those womanly qualities which are valued in woman,--silent,  unobtrusive, condescending, chaste, kindly, ready to help and tend, and  subordinating herself to her children.    Persephone (Roman Proserpina) was the queen of the dead, ruling the  infernal realm even more distinctly than her husband Pluto, severely  pure as she was awful and terrible; but there were no temples erected to  her, as the Greeks did not trouble themselves much about the  future state.    The minor deities of the Greeks were innumerable, and were identified  with every separate thing which occupied their thoughts,--with  mountains, rivers, capes, towns, fountains, rocks; with domestic  animals, with monsters of the deep, with demons and departed heroes,  with water-nymphs and wood-nymphs, with the qualities of mind and  attributes of the body; with sleep and death, old age and pain, strife  and victory; with hunger, grief, ridicule, wisdom, deceit, grace; with  night and day, the hours, the thunder the rainbow,---in short, all the  wonders of Nature, all the affections of the soul, and all the qualities  of the mind; everything they saw, everything they talked about,  everything they felt. All these wonders and sentiments they  impersonated; and these impersonations were supposed to preside over the  things they represented, and to a certain extent were worshipped. If a  man wished the winds to be propitious, he prayed to Zeus; if he wished  to be prospered in his bargains, he invoked Hermes; if he wished to be  successful in war, he prayed to Ares.    He never prayed to a supreme and eternal deity, but to some special  manifestation of deity, fancied or real; and hence his religion was  essentially pantheistic, though outwardly polytheistic. The divinities  whom he invoked he celebrated with rites corresponding with those traits  which they represented. Thus, Aphrodite was celebrated with lascivious  dances, and Dionysus with drunken revels. Each deity represented the  Grecian ideal,--of majesty or grace or beauty or strength or virtue or  wisdom or madness or folly. The character of Hera was what the poets  supposed should be the attributes of the Queen of heaven; that of Leto,  what should distinguish a disinterested housewife; that of Hestia, what  should mark the guardian of the fireside; that of Demeter, what should  show supreme benevolence and thrift; that of Athene, what would  naturally be associated with wisdom, and that of Aphrodite, what would  be expected from a sensual beauty. In the main, Zeus was serene,  majestic, and benignant, as became the king of the gods, although he was  occasionally faithless to his wife; Poseidon was boisterous, as became  the monarch of the seas; Apollo was a devoted son and a bright  companion, which one would expect in a gifted poet and wise prophet,  beautiful and graceful as a sun-god should be; Hephaestus, the god of  fire and smiths, showed naturally the awkwardness to which manual labor  leads; Ares was cruel and bloodthirsty, as the god of war should be;  Hermes, as the god of trade and business, would of course be sharp and  tricky; and Dionysus, the father of the vine, would naturally become  noisy and rollicking in his intoxication.    Thus, whatever defects are associated with the principal deities, these  are all natural and consistent with the characters they represent, or  the duties and business in which they engage. Drunkenness is not  associated with Zeus, or unchastity with Hera or Athene. The poets make  each deity consistent with himself, and in harmony with the interests he  represents. Hence the mythology of the poets is elaborate and  interesting. Who has not devoured the classical dictionary before he has  learned to scan the lines of Homer or of Virgil? As varied and romantic  as the \"Arabian Nights,\" it shines in the beauty of nature. In the  Grecian creations of gods and goddesses there is no insult to the  understanding, because these creations are in harmony with Nature, are  consistent with humanity. There is no hatred and no love, no jealousy  and no fear, which has not a natural cause. The poets proved themselves  to be great artists in the very characters they gave to their  divinities. They did not aim to excite reverence or stimulate to duty or  point out the higher life, but to amuse a worldly, pleasure-seeking,  good-natured, joyous, art-loving, poetic people, who lived in the  present and for themselves alone.    As a future state of rewards and punishments seldom entered into the  minds of the Greeks, so the gods are never represented as conferring  future salvation. The welfare of the soul was rarely thought of where  there was no settled belief in immortality. The gods themselves were fed  on nectar and ambrosia, that they might not die like ordinary mortals.  They might prolong their own existence indefinitely, but they were  impotent to confer eternal life upon their worshippers; and as eternal  life is essential to perfect happiness, they could not confer even  happiness in its highest sense.    On this fact Saint Augustine erected the grand fabric of his theological  system. In his most celebrated work, \"The City of God,\" he holds up to  derision the gods of antiquity, and with blended logic and irony makes  them contemptible as objects of worship, since they were impotent to  save the soul. In his view the grand and distinguishing feature of  Christianity, in contrast with Paganism, is the gift of eternal life and  happiness. It is not the morality which Christ and his Apostles taught,  which gave to Christianity its immeasurable superiority over all other  religions, but the promise of a future felicity in heaven. And it was  this promise which gave such comfort to the miserable people of the old  Pagan world, ground down by oppression, injustice, cruelty, and poverty.  It was this promise which filled the converts to Christianity with joy,  enthusiasm, and hope,--yea, more than this, even boundless love that  salvation was the gift of God through the self-sacrifice of Christ.  Immortality was brought to light by the gospel alone, and to miserable  people the idea of eternal bliss after the trials of mortal life were  passed was the source of immeasurable joy. No sooner was this sublime  expectation of happiness planted firmly in the minds of pagans, than  they threw their idols to the moles and the bats.    But even in regard to morality, Augustine showed that the gods were no  examples to follow. He ridicules their morals and their offices as  severely as he points out their impotency to bestow happiness. He shows  the absurdity and inconsistency of tolerating players in their  delineation of the vices and follies of deities for the amusement of the  people in the theatre, while the priests performed the same obscenities  as religious rites in the temples which were upheld by the State; so  that philosophers like Varro could pour contempt on players with  impunity, while he dared not ridicule priests for doing in the temples  the same things. No wonder that the popular religion at last was held in  contempt by philosophers, since it was not only impotent to save, but  did not stimulate to ordinary morality, to virtue, or to lofty  sentiments. A religion which was held sacred in one place and ridiculed  in another, before the eyes of the same people, could not in the end but  yield to what was better.    If we ascribe to the poets the creation of the elaborate mythology of  the Greeks,--that is, a system of gods made by men, rather than men made  by gods,--whether as symbols or objects of worship, whether the religion  was pantheistic or idolatrous, we find that artists even surpassed the  poets in their conceptions of divine power, goodness, and beauty, and  thus riveted the chains which the poets forged.    The temple of Zeus at Olympia in Elis, where the intellect and the  culture of Greece assembled every four years to witness the games  instituted in honor of the Father of the gods, was itself calculated to  impose on the senses of the worshippers by its grandeur and beauty. The  image of the god himself, sixty feet high, made of ivory, gold, and gems  by the greatest of all the sculptors of antiquity, must have impressed  spectators with ideas of strength and majesty even more than any  poetical descriptions could do. If it was art which the Greeks  worshipped rather than an unseen deity who controlled their destinies,  and to whom supreme homage was due, how nobly did the image before them  represent the highest conceptions of the attributes to be ascribed to  the King of Heaven! Seated on his throne, with the emblems of  sovereignty in his hands and attendant deities around him, his head,  neck, breast, and arms in massive proportions, and his face expressive  of majesty and sweetness, power in repose, benevolence blended with  strength,--the image of the Olympian deity conveyed to the minds of his  worshippers everything that could inspire awe, wonder, and goodness, as  well as power. No fear was blended with admiration, since his favor  could be won by the magnificent rites and"]]]
