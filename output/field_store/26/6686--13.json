Let us call these people by their own favourite name, Huns, even at the  risk of being unjust to the real Huns. And let us send as many of them  to the trenches as we can possibly induce to go, in the hope that they  may presently join the lists of the missing. Still, as they rather cling  to our soil, they will have to be reckoned with when the settlement  comes. But they will not count for much then. Most of them will be  heartily ashamed of what they said in those first three or four weeks of  blue funk (I am too timid myself not to make allowances for that most  distressing and universal, but fortunately transient effect of war); and  most of those who are not will be ashamed to bear malice publicly.      *The Commercial Attitude.*    Far more weighty in the matter will be the intermediate sections. First,  our commercial main body, which thinks that chivalry is not business,  and that rancour is childish, but cannot see why we should not make the  Germans pay damages and supply us with some capital to set the City  going again, forgetting that when France did that after 1871 for Berlin,  Berlin was set going so effectually that it went headlong to a colossal  financial smash, whilst the French peasant who had provided the capital  from his old stocking throve soberly on the interest at the expense of  less vital classes. Unfortunately Germany has set the example of this  kind of looting. Prussian generals, like Napoleon's marshals, have  always been shameless brigands, keeping up the seventeenth and  eighteenth century tradition of making cities bribe them to refrain from  sack and pillage and even billeting, and being quite incapable of the  magnificence of the great Conde (or was it Turenne?), who refused a  payment offered by a city on the ground that he had not intended to  march through it. Blucher's fury when Wellington would not allow him to  plunder Paris, and his exclamation when he saw London \"What a city to  loot!\" is still regarded as fair soldiering; and the blackmail levied  recently by the Prussian generals on the Belgian and French towns they  have occupied must, I suppose, be let pass as ransom, not as ordinary  criminal looting. But if the penalty of looting be thus spared, the  Germans can hardly complain if they are themselves held to ransom when  the fortunes of war go against them. Liege and Lille and Antwerp and the  rest must be paid their money back with interest; and there will be a  big builder's bill at Rheims. But we should ourselves refrain strictly  from blackmail. We should sell neither our blood nor our mercy. If we  sell either we are as much brigands as Blucher.      *Vindictive Damages.*    And we must not let ourselves be tempted to soil our hands under pretext  of vindictive damages. The man who thinks that all the money in Germany  could pay for the life of a single British drummer boy ought to be shot  merely as an expression of the feeling that he is unfit to live. We  stake our blood as the Germans stake theirs; and in that _ganz  besonderes Saft_ alone should we [missing text]r accept payment. We had  better **[missing text]y to the Kaiser at the end of the **[missing  text] \"Scoundrel: you can never replace **[missing text] Louvain  library, nor the sculpture of Rheims; and it follows logically that you  shall empty your pockets into ours.\" Much better say: \"God forgive us  all!\" If we cannot rise to this, and must soil our hands with plunder,  at least let us call it plunder, and not profane our language and our  souls by giving it fine names.      *Our Annihilationists.*    Then we shall have the Militarists, who will want to have Germany \"bled  to the white,\" dismembered and maimed, so that she may never do it  again. Well, that is quite simple, if you are Militarist enough to do  it. Loading Germany with debt will not do it. Towing her fleet into  Portsmouth or sinking it will not do it. Annexing provinces and colonies  will not do it. The effective method is far shorter and more practical.  What has made Germany formidable in this war? Obviously her  overwhelmingly superior numbers. That was how she rushed us back almost  to the gates of Paris. The organization, the readiness, the sixteen-inch  howitzer helped; but it was the multitudinous _Kanonenfutter_ that  nearly snowed us under. The British soldier at Cambrai and Le Cateau  killed and killed until his rifle was too hot to hold and his hand was  paralyzed with slayer's cramp; but still they came and came.      *Why Not Kill the German Women?*    Well, there is no obscurity about that problem. Those Germans who took  but an instant to kill had taken the travail of a woman for  three-quarters of a year to breed, and eighteen years to ripen for the  slaughter. All we have to do is to kill, say, 75 per cent, of all the  women in Germany under 60. Then we may leave Germany her fleet and her  money, and say \"Much good may they do you.\" Why not, if you are really  going in to be what you, never having read \"this Neech they talk of,\"  call a Nietzschean Superman? War is not an affair of sentiment. Some of  our newspapers complain that the Germans kill the wounded and fire on  field hospitals and Red Cross Ambulances. These same newspapers fill  their columns with exultant accounts of how our wounded think nothing of  modern bullet wounds and hope to be back at the front in a week, which I  take to be the most direct incitement to the Germans to kill the wounded  that could be devized. It is no use being virtuously indignant: \"stone  dead hath no fellow\" is an English proverb, not a German one. Even the  killing of prisoners is an Agincourt tradition. Now it is not more  cowardly to kill a woman than to kill a wounded man. And there is only  one reason why it is a greater crime to kill a woman than a man, and why  women have to be spared and protected when men are exposed and  sacrificed. That reason is that the destruction of the women is the  destruction of the community. Men are comparatively of no account: kill  90 per cent, of the German men, and the remaining 10 per cent. can  repeople her. But kill the women, and _Delenda est Carthago_. Now this  is exactly what our Militarists want to happen to Germany. Therefore the  objection to killing women becomes in this case the reason for doing it.  Why not? No reply is possible from the Militarist, disable-your-enemy  point of view. If disablement is your will, there is your way, and the  only effectual way. We really must not call the Kaiser and Von Bernhardi  disciples of the mythical Neech when they have either overlooked or  shrunk from such a glaring \"biological necessity.\" A pair of puling  pious sentimentalists if you like. But Supermen! Nonsense. O, my brother  journalists, if you revile the Prussians, call them sheep led by snobs,  call them beggars on horseback, call them sausage eaters, depict them in  the good old English fashion in spectacles and comforter, seedy overcoat  buttoned over paunchy figure, playing the contrabass tuba in a street  band; but do not flatter them with the heroic title of Superman, and  hold up as magnificent villainies worthy of Milton's Lucifer these  common crimes of violence and raid and lust that any drunken blackguard  can commit when the police are away, and that no mere multiplication can  dignify. As to Nietzsche, with his Polish hatred of Prussia (who  heartily reciprocated the sentiment), when did he ever tell the Germans  to allow themselves to be driven like sheep to the slaughter in millions  by mischievous dolts who, being for the most part incapable of reading  ten sentences of a philosophic treatise without falling asleep, allow  journalists as illiterate as themselves to persuade them that he got his  great reputation by writing a cheap gospel for bullies? Strictly between  ourselves, we also are an illiterate people; but we may at least hold  our tongues about matters we don't understand, and not say in the face  of Europe that the English believe that the composer of Parsifal was a  Militarist Prussian (he was an exiled revolutionist); that Nietzsche was  a diciple of Wagner (Nietzsche preferred the music of Bizet, a  Frenchman); and that the Kaiser is a disciple of Nietzsche, who would  have laughed his childish pietism to scorn.      *The Simple Answer.*    Nietzsche would certainly have agreed that we must kill the German women  if we mean business when we talk of destroying Germany. But he would  also have answered my Why not?, which is more than any consistent  Militarist can. Indeed, it needs no philosopher to give the answer. The  first ordinary anti-Militarist human person you meet will tell you that  it would be too horrible; that life would be unbearable if people did  such things. And he would be quite right; so please let us hear no more  of kicking your enemy when he is down so that he may be unable to rise"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1364"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Locomotive; Or, Two Miles a Minute on the Rails (#14)"],[1,"oil-burning type have achieved from  eighty-five to ninety-five miles an hour with a heavy load behind them.  They are very powerful machines. The Mogul mountain climbers are  powerful, too, although they are not built for speed.    \"The electric Goliaths built for the C. M. & St. P., and the Jandels,  are both very speedy under certain conditions. The former has a maximum  speed of sixty-five miles and the Jandel slightly faster.\"    \"But that is only half what that Mr. Bartholomew demands of your  invention, Tom!\" Mary cried.    \"That is a fact. I must reach twice sixty miles an hour, anyway, to  meet his demand and gain that hundred thousand bonus.  But I have the  advantage of a knowledge of all that has been done before my time in  the matter of electrical locomotive construction.\"    \"The world do move,\" repeated Ned. \"You believe that you have the edge  on all the other inventors?\"    \"Along the line of this development--yes,\" said Tom. \"I am taking up  the work where former experimenters ended theirs. Why shouldn't I find  the right combination to bring about a two-miles-a-minute drive?\"    \"Oh, Tom!\" cried Mary, with clasped hands, \"I hope you do.\"    \"I hope I do, too,\" said Tom, grimly. \"At least, if trying will bring  it, success is going to come my way.\"          Chapter XIV    Speed      More than four months had passed since the contract had been signed,  when Tom made his first yard-test of the Hercules 0001.  For a month  nothing had been seen or heard of Andy O'Malley, whose identity as the  spy, set by Montagne Lewis to cripple Tom's attempt to help the  Hendrickton & Pas Alos Railroad, had been determined beyond any doubt.    The private inquiry agent that Tom had engaged to find O'Malley had  been unsuccessful in his work. The spy had disappeared from Shopton and  the vicinity. Nevertheless, the inventor did not for a moment overlook  the possibility that the enemy might again strike.    Every night the electric current was turned into the wires that capped  the stockade of the Swift Construction Company enclosure.  Koku beat a  path around the enclosure at night, getting such short sleep as he  seemed to need in the forenoon.    \"Dat crazy cannibal,\" grumbled Rad, \"got it in his haid dat he's gwine  to he'p Massa Tom by walkin' out o' nights like he was dis here  Western, de great sprinter, Ma lawsy me! Koku ain't got brains enough  to fill up a hic'ry nut shell. Dat he ain't.\"    Nothing anybody else could do for Tom ever satisfied Rad. The colored  man fully believed that he was the only person really necessary for  Tom's success and peace of mind. In fact, Rad thought that even Ned  Newton's duties as financial manager of the firm were scarcely of as  much importance.    When he heard that Tom was going West, after a time, with the electric  locomotive, to try it out on the tracks of the H. & P. A., Rad was  quite sure that if he did not go along, the test would not come out  right.    \"O' course yo'll need me, Massa Tom,\" he said, confidently.  \"Couldn't  git along widout me nohow. Yo' knows, sir, I allus has to go 'long wid  yo' to fix things.\"    \"Don't you think father will need you here, Rad?\" Tom asked the  faithful old fellow. \"You're getting old--\"    \"Me gittin' old?\" cried, the colored man. \"Huh! Yo' don't know 'bout  dis here chile. I don't purpose ever to git old. I been gray-haided  since befo' yo' was born; but I ain't old yit!\"    Mr. Damon chanced to be present at this conversation, and he was highly  amused, yet somewhat impressed, too, by the colored man's statement.    \"Bless my own antiquity!\" he exclaimed. \"I agree with Rad, Tom.  It's  us old fellows who know what to do when an emergency of any kind  arises. Experience teaches more than inspiration.\"    \"Oh,\" said Tom, laughing, \"I do not deny the value of old friends at  any stage of the game.\"    \"Bless my roving nature! I am glad to hear you say that. For I tell you  right now, Tom, I want to be out there when you make your final test of  the locomotive.\"    \"Do you mean that you will go West when I take out the Hercules  Three-Oughts-One?\" cried Tom.    \"It's just what I want to do. Bless my traveling bag, Tom! I mean to be  present at your final triumph.\"    \"What will happen to your buff Orpingtons while you are gone?\" asked  the young inventor, gravely.    \"I have got my servant trained to look after those chickens,\" declared  Mr. Damon. \"And this invention of yours is really more important than  even my buff Orpingtons.\"    \"Just the same,\" remarked Tom to his eccentric friend, when Rad had  left the room. \"I've got to fix it so that Eradicate stays at home with  father. He doesn't really know how old and broken he is--poor fellow.\"    \"His heart is green, Tom. That's what is the matter with Rad.\"    \"He is a loyal old fellow. But I shall take Koku with me, not Rad,\" and  the young inventor spoke decidedly. \"And that is going to trouble poor  Rad a lot.\"    The prospect of going West, however, was not the main subject of Tom's  thoughts at this time. As the weeks passed and the end of the six  months of experiment came nearer, the inventor was more and more  troubled by the principal difficulty which had from the first  confronted him. Speed.    That was the mark he had set himself. A maximum speed of two miles a  minute on a level track for the Hercules 0001. With the speed already  attained by both steam and electric locomotives in the more recent  past, this was by no means an impossible attainment, as Tom quite well  knew.    But he became convinced that the conditions under which he labored made  it impossible for him to be positive of just how great a speed on a  straight, level track his invention would attain.    There was no electrified stretch of railroad near Shopton on which the  Hercules 0001 might be tested. The track inside the Swift Company's  enclosure did not offer the conditions the inventor needed. He felt  balked.    \"I believe I have hit the right idea in my improvements on the Jandel  patents,\" he told Ned Newton when they were discussing the matter. \"But  believing is one thing. Knowing is another!\"    \"Theoretically it works out all right, I suppose?\" questioned Ned.    \"Quite. I can prove on paper that I've got the speed. But that isn't  enough. You can see that.\"    \"Impossible to be sure on the trackage already built here, Tom?\"    \"I haven't dared give her all she'll take,\" grumbled Tom. \"If I did, I  fear she'd jump the rails and I'd have a wreck on my hands.\"    \"And maybe kill yourself!\" exclaimed Ned. \"You want to have a care.\"    \"Oh, that's all right! I've taken risks before. I don't want to risk  the safety of the locomotive, which is more important. That machine has  cost us a lot of money.\"    \"I'll say so!\" agreed Ned. \"You'll have to wait till you can get the  locomotive out there on the H. & P. A. tracks before you get a fair  speed-test.\"    \"And suppose instead of a triumph it is a fiasco?\" Tom said,  doubtfully. \"I tell you straight, Ned: I never was so uncertain about  the outcome of one of my inventions since I began dabbling with  motive-power.\"    \"We could build several miles of straight track in the waste ground  behind the works,\" Ned said, thoughtfully.    \"Not a chance! There is neither time nor money for such work.  Besides,  I should have to rebuild my transforming station if I supplied longer  conduit wires with current.\"    \"You don't really consider that you have failed, do you, Tom?\" and  Ned's anxiety made his voice sound very woeful indeed.    \"I tell you that my belief doesn't satisfy me. I hate to go West  without being sure--positive. I want to know! I have tried the  locomotive out in the yard half a dozen times. It runs like a fine  watch. There doesn't seem to be a thing the matter with it now. But  what speed can I attain?\"    \"I don't see but you'll have to risk it, Tom.\"    \"I mean to give her one more test. I'll run her out tonight when there  is nobody about but the watchmen--and you, if you want to come. I'll  arrange with the Electric Company for all the current they can spare.  By ginger! I've got to take some risk.\"    \"By the way, Tom,\" said his chum, \"did it ever strike you as odd that  that private detective agency never got any trace of O'Malley?\"    \"Well, he's gone away. We needn't worry about him. Maybe the detective  wasn't very smart, at that.\"    \"And yet he was here in town after you put the inquiry on foot.  I saw  him in the bank. He came there occasionally. And either he, or somebody  he hired, placed that bomb in the locomotive.\"    \"All those being facts, what of it?\"    \"Besides, there was that other fellow--the man with the Vandyke beard.  Might be a shyster lawyer, or something of the kind. He wasn't spotted,  either.\"    \"To tell the truth, I didn't bother to give the Detective Agency the  description of that fellow, although you gave it to me,\" and Tom  laughed. \"I must confess that I depend more upon my man-trap electric  wires to protect the invention than I do on the private inquiry agent.\"    \"It's funny, just the same. If I had another job for a detective I  should not submit it to the Blatz Agency,\" grumbled Ned.    \"I fancy Montagne Lewis and his crowd called off their Wild West  gunman,\" said Tom. \"In any case, every attempt he made to bother us  turned out a fizzle. I am not, however, forgetting precautions, my boy.\"    Ned Newton realized that his chum had determined to make this night  test of the electric locomotive the pivotal trial of the whole affair.  He came back to the works after dinner and was let in by the office  watchman at about nine o'clock.    \"Mr. Tom here yet?\" he asked the man.    \"Yes, Mr. Newton. The young boss didn't go home to supper, even. That  colored man brought something down for him, and he's in the shed yet.\"    \"Rad is here, you mean?\"    \"Yes, sir. At least, he didn't go out this way, and we watchmen have  instructions to let nobody in or out by the yard gates at"]]]
