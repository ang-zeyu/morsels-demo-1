This, the passion of his life, never asleep even in the  hottest days of business or the most hopeless days of defeat, must have  had full play during these days of suspended public employment. He was a  man who was not easily satisfied with his attempts to arrange the order  and proportions of his plans for mastering that new world of unknown  truth, which he held to be within the grasp of man if he would only dare  to seize it; and he was much given to vary the shape of his work, and to  try experiments in composition and even style. He wrote and rewrote.  Besides what was finally published, there remains a larger quantity of  work which never reached the stage of publication. He repeated over and  over again the same thoughts, the same images and characteristic  sayings. Among these papers is one which sums up his convictions about  the work before him, and the vocation to which he had been called in  respect of it. It is in the form of a \"Proem\" to a treatise on the  _Interpretation of Nature_. It was never used in his published works;  but, as Mr. Spedding says, it has a peculiar value as an authentic  statement of what he looked upon as his special business in life. It is  this mission which he states to himself in the following paper. It is  drawn up in \"stately Latin.\" Mr. Spedding's translation is no unworthy  representation of the words of the great Prophet of Knowledge:         \"Believing that I was born for the service of mankind, and       regarding the care of the Commonwealth as a kind of common property       which, like the air and water, belongs to everybody, I set myself       to consider in what way mankind might be best served, and what       service I was myself best fitted by nature to perform.         \"Now among all the benefits that could be conferred upon mankind, I       found none so great as the discovery of new arts, endowments, and       commodities for the bettering of man's life.... But if a man could       succeed, not in striking out some particular invention, however       useful, but in kindling a light in nature--a light that should in       its very rising touch and illuminate all the border regions that       confine upon the circle of our present knowledge; and so spreading       further and further should presently disclose and bring into sight       all that is most hidden and secret in the world--that man (I       thought) would be the benefactor indeed of the human race--the       propagator of man's empire over the universe, the champion of       liberty, the conqueror and subduer of necessities.         \"For myself, I found that I was fitted for nothing so well as for       the study of Truth; as having a mind nimble and versatile enough to       catch the resemblances of things (which is the chief point), and at       the same time steady enough to fix and distinguish their subtler       differences; as being gifted by nature with desire to seek,       patience to doubt, fondness to meditate, slowness to assert,       readiness to reconsider, carefulness to dispose and set in order;       and as being a man that neither affects what is new nor admires       what is old, and that hates every kind of imposture. So I thought       my nature had a kind of familiarity and relationship with Truth.        \"Nevertheless, because my birth and education had seasoned me in      business of State; and because opinions (so young as I was) would      sometimes stagger me; and because I thought that a man's own country      has some special claims upon him more than the rest of the world;      and because I hoped that, if I rose to any place of honour in the      State, I should have a larger command of industry and ability to      help me in my work--for these reasons I both applied myself to      acquire the arts of civil life, and commended my service, so far as      in modesty and honesty I might, to the favour of such friends as had      any influence. In which also I had another motive: for I felt that      those things I have spoken of--be they great or small--reach no      further than the condition and culture of this mortal life; and I      was not without hope (the condition of religion being at that time      not very prosperous) that if I came to hold office in the State, I      might get something done too for the good of men's souls. When I      found, however, that my zeal was mistaken for ambition, and my life      had already readied the turning-point, and my breaking health      reminded me how ill I could afford to be so slow, and I reflected,      moreover, that in leaving undone the good that I could do by myself      alone, and applying myself to that which could not be done without      the help and consent of others, I was by no means discharging the      duty that lay upon me--I put all those thoughts aside, and (in      pursuance of my old determination) betook myself wholly to this      work. Nor am I discouraged from it because I see signs in the times      of the decline and overthrow of that knowledge and erudition which      is now in use. Not that I apprehend any more barbarian invasions      (unless possibly the Spanish empire should recover its strength, and      having crushed other nations by arms should itself sink under its      own weight); but the civil wars which may be expected, I think      (judging from certain fashions which have come in of late), to      spread through many countries--together with the malignity of sects,      and those compendious artifices and devices which have crept into      the place of solid erudition--seem to portend for literature and the      sciences a tempest not less fatal, and one against which the      Printing-office will be no effectual security. And no doubt but that      fair-weather learning which is nursed by leisure, blossoms under      reward and praise, which cannot withstand the shock of opinion, and      is liable to be abused by tricks and quackery, will sink under such      impediments as these. Far otherwise is it with that knowledge whose      dignity is maintained by works of utility and power. For the      injuries, therefore, which should proceed from the times, I am not      afraid of them; and for the injuries which proceed from men, I am      not concerned. For if any one charge me with seeking to be wise      over-much, I answer simply that modesty and civil respect are fit      for civil matters; in contemplations nothing is to be respected but      Truth. If any one call on me for _works_, and that presently, I tell      him frankly, without any imposture at all, that for me--a man not      old, of weak health, my hands full of civil business, entering      without guide or light upon an argument of all others the most      obscure--I hold it enough to have constructed the machine, though I      may not succeed in setting it on work.... If, again, any one ask me,      not indeed for actual works, yet for definite premises and      forecasts of the works that are to be, I would have him know that      the knowledge which we now possess will not teach a man even what to      _wish_. Lastly--though this is a matter of less moment--if any of      our politicians, who used to make their calculations and conjectures      according to persons and precedents, must needs interpose his      judgment in a thing of this nature, I would but remind him how      (according to the ancient fable) the lame man keeping the course won      the race of the swift man who left it; and that there is no thought      to be taken about precedents, for the thing is without precedent.        \"For myself, my heart is not set upon any of those things which      depend upon external accidents. I am not hunting for fame: I have no      desire to found a sect, after the fashion of heresiarchs; and to      look for any private gain from such an undertaking as this I count      both ridiculous and base. Enough for me the consciousness of      well-deserving, and those real and effectual results with which      Fortune itself cannot interfere.\"    In 1604 James's first Parliament met, and with it Bacon returned to an  industrious public life, which was not to be interrupted till it finally  came to an end with his strange and irretrievable fall. The opportunity  had come; and Bacon, patient, vigilant, and conscious of great powers  and indefatigable energy, fully aware of all the conditions of the time,  pushed at once to the front in the House of Commons. He lost no time in  showing that he meant to make himself felt. The House of Commons had no  sooner met than it was involved in a contest with the Chancery, with the  Lords, and finally with the King himself, about its privileges--in this  case its exclusive right to judge of the returns of its members. Bacon's  time was come for showing the King both that he was willing to do him  service, and that he was worth being employed. He took a leading part in  the discussions, and was trusted by the House as their spokesman and  reporter in the various conferences. The King, in his overweening  confidence in his absolute prerogative, had, indeed, got himself into  serious difficulty; for the privilege was one which it was impossible  for the Commons to give up. But Bacon led the House to agree to an  arrangement which saved their rights; and under a cloud of words of  extravagant flattery he put the King in good-humour, and elicited from  him the spontaneous proposal of a compromise which ended a very  dangerous dispute. \"The King's voice,\" said Bacon, in his report to the  House, \"was the voice of God in man, the good spirit of God in the mouth  of man; I do not say the voice of God and not of man; I am not one of  Herod's flatterers; a curse fell upon him that said it, a curse on him  that suffered it. We might say, as was said to Solomon, We are glad, O  King, that we give account to you,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13893"],[0,"Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents: William McKinley; (#14)"],[1,"of international duty I issued, April 26, 1898, a  proclamation announcing the treatment proposed to be accorded to vessels  and their cargoes as to blockade, contraband, the exercise of the right  of search, and the immunity of neutral flags and neutral goods under  enemy's flag.[19] A similar proclamation was made by the Spanish  Government. In the conduct of hostilities the rules of the Declaration  of Paris, including abstention from resort to privateering, have  accordingly been observed by both belligerents, although neither was a  party to that declaration.    Our country thus, after an interval of half a century of peace with all  nations, found itself engaged in deadly conflict with a foreign enemy.  Every nerve was strained to meet the emergency. The response to the  initial call for 125,000 volunteers[20] was instant and complete, as was  also the result of the second call, of May 25, for 75,000 additional  volunteers.[21] The ranks of the Regular Army were increased to the  limits provided by the act of April 26, 1898.    The enlisted force of the Navy on the 15th day of August, when it  reached its maximum, numbered 24,123 men and apprentices. One hundred  and three vessels were added to the Navy by purchase, 1 was presented  to the Government, 1 leased, and the 4 vessels of the International  Navigation Company--the _St. Paul_, _St. Louis_, _New York_, and  _Paris_--were chartered. In addition to these the revenue cutters  and lighthouse tenders were turned over to the Navy Department and  became temporarily a part of the auxiliary Navy.    The maximum effective fighting force of the Navy during the war,  separated into classes, was as follows:    Four battle ships of the first class, 1 battle ship of the second  class, 2 armored cruisers, 6 coast-defense monitors, 1 armored ram,  12 protected cruisers, 3 unprotected cruisers, 18 gunboats, 1 dynamite  cruiser, 11 torpedo boats; vessels of the old Navy, including monitors,  14. Auxiliary Navy: 11 auxiliary cruisers, 28 converted yachts, 27  converted tugs, 19 converted colliers, 15 revenue cutters, 4 light-house  tenders, and 19 miscellaneous vessels.    Much alarm was felt along our entire Atlantic seaboard lest some attack  might be made by the enemy. Every precaution was taken to prevent  possible injury to our great cities lying along the coast. Temporary  garrisons were provided, drawn from the State militia; infantry and  light batteries were drawn from the volunteer force. About 12,000 troops  were thus employed. The coast signal service was established for  observing the approach of an enemy's ships to the coast of the United  States, and the Life-Saving and Light-House services cooperated, which  enabled the Navy Department to have all portions of the Atlantic coast,  from Maine to Texas, under observation.    The auxiliary Navy was created under the authority of Congress and was  officered and manned by the Naval Militia of the several States. This  organization patrolled the coast and performed the duty of a second line  of defense.    Under the direction of the Chief of Engineers submarine mines were  placed at the most exposed points. Before the outbreak of the war  permanent mining casemates and cable galleries had been constructed at  nearly all important harbors. Most of the torpedo material was not to be  found in the market, and had to be specially manufactured. Under date  of April 19 district officers were directed to take all preliminary  measures short of the actual attaching of the loaded mines to the  cables, and on April 22 telegraphic orders were issued to place the  loaded mines in position.    The aggregate number of mines placed was 1,535, at the principal harbors  from Maine to California. Preparations were also made for the planting  of mines at certain other harbors, but owing to the early destruction of  the Spanish fleet these mines were not placed.    The Signal Corps was promptly organized, and performed service of the  most difficult and important character. Its operations during the war  covered the electrical connection of all coast fortifications, the  establishment of telephonic and telegraphic facilities for the camps at  Manila, Santiago, and in Puerto Rico. There were constructed 300 miles  of line at ten great camps, thus facilitating military movements from  those points in a manner heretofore unknown in military administration.  Field telegraph lines were established and maintained under the enemy's  fire at Manila, and later the Manila-Hongkong cable was reopened.    In Puerto Rico cable communications were opened over a discontinued  route, and on land the headquarters of the commanding officer was kept  in telegraphic or telephonic communication with the division commanders  on four different lines of operations.    There was placed in Cuban waters a completely outfitted cable ship,  with war cables and cable gear, suitable both for the destruction of  communications belonging to the enemy and the establishment of our own.  Two ocean cables were destroyed under the enemy's batteries at Santiago.  The day previous to the landing of General Shafter's corps, at  Caimanera, within 20 miles of the landing place, cable communications  were established and a cable station opened giving direct communication  with the Government at Washington. This service was invaluable to the  Executive in directing the operations of the Army and Navy. With a total  force of over 1,300, the loss was by disease in camp and field, officers  and men included, only 5.    The national-defense fund of $50,000,000 was expended in large part  by the Army and Navy, and the objects for which it was used are fully  shown in the reports of the several Secretaries. It was a most timely  appropriation, enabling the Government to strengthen its defenses and  make preparations greatly needed in case of war.    This fund being inadequate to the requirements of equipment and for the  conduct of the war, the patriotism of the Congress provided the means in  the war-revenue act of June 13 by authorizing a 3 per cent popular loan  not to exceed $400,000,000 and by levying additional imposts and taxes.  Of the authorized loan $200,000,000 were offered and promptly taken, the  subscriptions so far exceeding the call as to cover it many times over,  while, preference being given to the smaller bids, no single allotment  exceeded $5,000. This was a most encouraging and significant result,  showing the vast resources of the nation and the determination of the  people to uphold their country's honor.    It is not within the province of this message to narrate the history of  the extraordinary war that followed the Spanish declaration of April 21,  but a brief recital of its more salient features is appropriate.    The first encounter of the war in point of date took place April 27,  when a detachment of the blockading squadron made a reconnoissance in  force at Matanzas, shelled the harbor forts, and demolished several new  works in construction.    The next engagement was destined to mark a memorable epoch in maritime  warfare. The Pacific fleet, under Commodore George Dewey, had lain for  some weeks at Hongkong. Upon the colonial proclamation of neutrality  being issued and the customary twenty-four hours' notice being given,  it repaired to Mirs Bay, near Hongkong, whence it proceeded to the  Philippine Islands under telegraphed orders to capture or destroy the  formidable Spanish fleet then assembled at Manila. At daybreak on the  1st of May the American force entered Manila Bay, and after a few  hours' engagement effected the total destruction of the Spanish fleet,  consisting of ten war ships and a transport, besides capturing the naval  station and forts at Cavite, thus annihilating the Spanish naval power  in the Pacific Ocean and completely controlling the bay of Manila, with  the ability to take the city at will. Not a life was lost on our ships,  the wounded only numbering seven, while not a vessel was materially  injured. For this gallant achievement the Congress, upon my  recommendation, fitly bestowed upon the actors preferment and  substantial reward.    The effect of this remarkable victory upon the spirit of our people and  upon the fortunes of the war was instant. A prestige of invincibility  thereby attached to our arms which continued throughout the struggle.  Reenforcements were hurried to Manila under the command of Major-General  Merritt and firmly established within sight of the capital, which lay  helpless before our guns.    On the 7th day of May the Government was advised officially of the  victory at Manila, and at once inquired of the commander of our fleet  what troops would be required. The information was received on the 15th  day of May, and the first army expedition sailed May 25 and arrived off  Manila June 30. Other expeditions soon followed, the total force  consisting of 641 officers and 15,058 enlisted men.    Only reluctance to cause needless loss of life and property prevented  the early storming and capture of the city, and therewith the absolute  military occupancy of the whole group. The insurgents meanwhile had  resumed the active hostilities suspended by the uncompleted truce of  December, 1897. Their forces invested Manila from the northern and  eastern sides, but were constrained by Admiral Dewey and General Merritt  from attempting an assault. It was fitting that whatever was to be done  in the way of decisive operations in that quarter should be accomplished  by the strong arm of the United States alone. Obeying the stern precept  of war which enjoins the overcoming of the adversary and the extinction  of his power wherever assailable as the speedy and sure means to win a  peace, divided victory was not permissible, for no partition of the  rights and responsibilities attending the enforcement of a just and  advantageous peace could be thought of.
