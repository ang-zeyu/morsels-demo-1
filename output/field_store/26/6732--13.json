He was more than pleased when the Minister  closed the debate by a speech in which he seemed to be willing to meet  the wishes of those in the House who thought that amendment was required.  He could not have imagined that the Bill would develop into the shape  into which it had developed, and had he known that so great an alteration  would take place in the general effect of the measure  from what was foreshadowed by the hon. Minister when he had made  that interesting speech on the second reading he (the speaker)  could not have conscientiously voted for the second reading.  He would have been better pleased had a resolution been taken  not to bring in a Bill until the Commission had reported.  That was the position he had taken up all through and he would much rather now  that the matter should be dealt with in that way.  If, however,  the Bill was to be pressed through there should be guarantees in it  which should allay all suspicion.  Anything affecting the native people  required to be done gradually and should be placed before them  a long time before the change took place.  He hoped there would yet be  some steps taken to give them a greater sense of security.  To give some idea of the feeling in the minds of the Natives  he read a letter from a gentleman in Natal, largely interested  in the Natives, which had expressed the opinion that the Natives  stood uncompromisingly against any change in their present status  until the Commission had reported.  He hoped the hon. Minister  would even yet endeavour to do something to meet their views.    Mr. C. H. Haggar (Roodepoort) said that from the point of those  who had worked successfully in turning the uncivilized man  into the civilized man the Bill was bound to be a failure.  It was necessary not only to have legislation theoretically just,  but also practically right and good.  But there were many who felt  that so far from the effect of that Bill being good it would be disastrous  to a very large extent.  The great sin which they had been committing  was that they had always been legislating ahead of the people,  and there had not been sufficient preparation for the changes  which were proposed in that Bill; the Natives were not ready for it.  The hon. member for Victoria West had said that there was a disposition  in certain directions to repress the Natives.  He (the speaker) believed  that there was a feeling that white men had some divine right  to the labour of the black, that the black people were to be  hewers of wood and drawers of water, and he wanted to say that while men  were obsessed with that feeling they would never be able to legislate fairly.  They had no more divine right to the labour of the black people  than they had to the labour of the white.  To his mind the great point was,  should their policy be one of repression or a policy of inspiration?  They had inspired the Natives to a certain extent, but no sooner  had they created an appetite than they had told the Natives  they should go no further.  Their policy was the policy of Tantalus.  That Bill would create a feeling of insecurity in the minds of the Natives.  There were those who said that if the Natives would not submit to dictation  they should be wiped out.  But that should not be their policy.  They must cease the policy of repression and let it be  one of wide inspiration.  ==    But alas! these and similar pleadings had about as much effect  upon the Ministerial steam-roller as the proverbial water on a duck's back.  With a rush the Natives' Land Bill was dispatched from the Lower House  to the Senate, adopted hurriedly by the Senate, returned to the Lower House,  and went at the same pace to Government House, and there receiving  the Governor-General's signature, it immediately became law.  As regards the Governor-General's signature, His Excellency,  if Ministers are to be believed, was ready to sign the Bill  (or rather signified his intention of doing so) long before it was introduced  into Parliament.  This excited haste suggests grave misgivings  as to the character of the Bill.  Why all the hurry and scurry,  and why the Governor-General's approval in advance?  Other Bills  are passed and approved by the Governor, yet they do not come into operation  until some given day -- the beginning of the next calendar year,  or of the next financial year.  But the Natives' Land Act  became law and was operating as soon as it could be promulgated.    After desperately protesting, with individual members of Parliament  and with Cabinet Ministers, and getting nothing for their pains,  the delegates from the Native Congress wrote Lord Gladstone,  from an office about two hundred yards distant from Government House,  requesting His Excellency to withhold his assent to the Natives' Land Bill  until the people mostly concerned (i.e. the Natives) had had a chance  of making known to His Majesty the King their objection to the measure.  His Excellency replied that such a course \"was not within  his constitutional functions.\"  Thereby the die was cast,  and the mandate went forth that the land laws of the Orange \"Free\" State,  which is commonly known as \"the Only Slave State\", shall be  the laws of the whole Union of South Africa.  The worst feature in the case  is the fact that, even with the Governments of the late Republics,  the Presidents always had the power to exempt some Natives  from the operation of those laws, and that prerogative had been liberally used  by successive Presidents.  Now, however, without a President,  and with the prerogative of the King (by the exercise of which  the evils of such a law could have been averted) disowned by  the King's own Ministers on the spot, God in the heavens alone  knows what will become of the hapless, because voteless, Natives,  who are without a President, \"without a King\", and with a Governor-General  without constitutional functions, under task-masters whose national traditions  are to enslave the dark races.          Chapter IV      One Night with the Fugitives      Es ist unkoeniglich zu weinen -- ach,    Und hier nicht weinen ist unvaeterlich.                                         Schiller.        \"Pray that your flight be not in winter,\" said Jesus Christ;  but it was only during the winter of 1913 that the full significance  of this New Testament passage was revealed to us.  We left Kimberley  by the early morning train during the first week in July,  on a tour of observation regarding the operation of the Natives' Land Act;  and we arrived at Bloemhof, in Transvaal, at about noon.  On the River Diggings there were no actual cases representing  the effects of the Act, but traces of these effects were everywhere manifest.  Some fugitives of the Natives' Land Act had crossed the river in full flight.  The fact that they reached the diggings a fortnight before our visit  would seem to show that while the debates were proceeding in Parliament  some farmers already viewed with eager eyes the impending opportunity  for at once making slaves of their tenants and appropriating their stock;  for, acting on the powers conferred on them by an Act signed  by Lord Gladstone, so lately as June 16, they had during that very week  (probably a couple of days after, and in some cases, it would seem,  a couple of days before the actual signing of the Bill)  approached their tenants with stories about a new Act which makes it criminal  for any one to have black tenants and lawful to have black servants.  Few of these Natives, of course, would object to be servants,  especially if the white man is worth working for, but this is where  the shoe pinches:  one of the conditions is that the black man's  (that is the servant's) cattle shall henceforth work for the landlord  free of charge.  Then the Natives would decide to leave the farm  rather than make the landlord a present of all their life's savings,  and some of them had passed through the diggings in search of a place  in the Transvaal.  But the higher up they went the more gloomy  was their prospect as the news about the new law was now penetrating  every part of the country.    One farmer met a wandering native family in the town of Bloemhof  a week before our visit.  He was willing to employ the Native  and many more homeless families as follows:  A monthly wage  of 2 Pounds 10s. for each such family, the husband working in the fields,  the wife in the house, with an additional 10s. a month for each son,  and 5s. for each daughter, but on condition that the Native's cattle  were also handed over to work for him.  It must be clearly understood,  we are told that the Dutchman added, that occasionally the Native  would have to leave his family at work on the farm, and go out  with his wagon and his oxen to earn money whenever and wherever  he was told to go, in order that the master may be enabled to pay  the stipulated wage.  The Natives were at first inclined to laugh at the idea  of working for a master with their families and goods and chattels,  and then to have the additional pleasure of paying their own small wages,  besides bringing money to pay the \"Baas\" for employing them.  But the Dutchman's serious demeanour told them that his suggestion  was \"no joke\".  He himself had for some time been in need  of a native cattle owner, to assist him as transport rider  between Bloemhof, Mooifontein, London, and other diggings,  in return for the occupation and cultivation of some of his waste lands  in the district, but that was now illegal.  He could only \"employ\" them;  but, as he had no money to pay wages, their cattle would have  to go out and earn it for him.  Had they not heard of the law before?  he inquired.  Of course they had; in fact that is why they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14521"],[0,"Memories: A Story of German Love (#14)"],[1,"ice.  If two men  love the same maiden, one or both must fall as a sacrifice.  Why?  Cannot  one love a maiden, without wishing to marry her?  Cannot one look upon a  woman, without desiring her for his own?  You close your eyes, and I feel  I have said too much.  The world has changed the most sacred things in  life into the most common.  But, Marie, enough!  Let us talk the language  of the world when we must talk, and act in it, and with it.  But let us  preserve a sanctuary where two hearts can speak the pure language of the  heart, undisturbed by the raging of the world without.  The world itself  honors this seclusion, this courageous resistance, which noble hearts,  conscious of their own rectitude, oppose to the ordinary course of  things.  The attentions, the amenities, the prejudices of the world are  like a climbing plant.  It is pleasant to see an ivy, with its thousand  tendrils and roots, decorating the solid wall-work; but it should not be  allowed too luxuriant growth, else it will penetrate every crevice of the  structure, and destroy the cement which welds it together.  Be mine,  Marie; follow the voice of your heart.  The word which now hangs upon  your lips decides forever your life and mine--my happiness and yours.\"    I was silent.  The hand I held in mine returned the warm pressure of the  heart.  A storm raged in her breast, and the blue heaven before me never  seemed so beautiful as now, while the storm swept by, cloud upon cloud.    \"Why do you love me?\" said she, gently, as if she must still delay the  moment of decision.    \"Why, Marie?  Ask the child why it is born; ask the flower why it  blossoms; ask the sun why it shines.  I love you because I must love you.  But if I am compelled to answer further, let this book, lying by you,  which you love so much, speak for me:      [\"Das beste solte das liebste sin, und in diser libe solte nicht  angesehen werden nuss und unnuss, fromen oder schaden, gewin oder  vorlust, ere oder unere, lob oder unlob oder diser keins, sunder was in  der warheit das edelste und das aller beste ist, das solt auch das  allerliebste sin, und umb nichts anders dan allein umb das, das es das  edelst und das beste ist.  Hie nach mocht ein mensche sin leben gerichten  von ussen und von innen.  Von ussen: wan under den creaturen ist eins  besser dan das ander, dar nach dan das ewig gut in einem mer oder minner  schinet und wurket dan in dem andern.  In welchem nun das ewig gut aller  meist schinet, luchtet, wurket und bekant und geliebet wirt, das ist ouch  das beste under den creaturen; und in welchem dis minst ist, das ist ouch  das aller minst gut.  So nu der mensche die creatur handelt und da mit  umb get, und disen underscheit bekennet, so sol im ie die beste creatur  die liebste sin und sol sich mit flis zu ir halden und sich da mit  voreinigen. . .\"]      \"The best should be the most loved, and in this love there should be no  consideration of advantage or disadvantage, gain or loss, honor or  dishonor, praise or blame, or anything else, but of that which in reality  is the noblest and best, which should be the dearest of all; and for no  other reason, but because it is the noblest and best.  According to this  a man should plan his inner and outer life.  From without: if among  mankind there is one better than another, in proportion as the eternally  good shines or works more in one than in another.  That being in whom the  eternally good shines, works, is known and loved most, is therefore the  best among mankind; and in whom this is most, there is also the most  good.  As now a man has intercourse with a being, and apprehends this  distinction, then the best being should be the dearest to him, and he  should fervently cling to it, and unite himself with it. . . . . .\"      \"Because you are the most perfect creature that I know, Marie, therefore  I am good to you, therefore you are dear to me, therefore we love each  other.  Speak the word which lives in you, say that you are mine.  Deny  not your innermost convictions.  God has imposed a life of suffering upon  you.  He sent me to bear it with you.  Your sorrow shall be my sorrow,  and we will bear it together, as the ship bears the heavy sails which  guide it through the storms of life into the safe haven at last.\"    She grew more and more silent, A gentle flush played upon her cheeks like  the quiet evening gleam.  Then she opened her eyes full--the sun gleamed  all at once with marvellous lustre.    \"I am yours,\" said she.  \"God wills it.  Take me just as I am; so long as  I live I am yours, and may God bring us together again in a more  beautiful life, and recompense your love.\"    We lay heart to heart.  My lips closed the lips upon which had just now  hung the blessing of my life, with a gentle kiss.  Time stood still for  us.  The world about us disappeared.  Then a deep sigh escaped from her  breast.  \"May God forgive me for this rapture,\" she whispered.  \"Leave me  alone now, I cannot endure more.  _Auf wiedersehen_!  my friend, my loved  one, my savior.\"    These were the last words I ever heard from her.  But no--I had reached  home and was lying upon my bed in troubled dreams.  It was past midnight  when the Hofrath entered my room.  \"Our angel is in Heaven,\" said he;  \"here is the last greeting she sends you.\"  With these words he gave me a  letter.  It enclosed the ring which she had given me, and I once had  given her, with the words: \"_As God wills_.\"  It was wrapped in an old  paper, whereon she had some time written the words I spoke to her when a  child: \"What is thine, is mine.  Thy Marie.\"    Hours long, we sat together without speaking.  It was a spiritual swoon  which Heaven sends us when the load of pain becomes greater than we can  bear.  At last the old man arose, took my hand and said: \"We see each  other to-day for the last time, for you must leave here, and my days are  numbered.  There is but one thing I must say to you--a secret which I  have carried all my life, and confessed to no one.  I have always longed  to confess it to some one.  Listen to me.  The spirit which has left us  was a beautiful spirit, a majestic, pure soul, a deep, true heart.  I  knew one spirit as beautiful as hers--still more beautiful.  It was her  mother.  I loved her mother, and she loved me.  We were both poor, and I  struggled with life to obtain an honorable position both on her account  and my own.  The young Prince saw my bride and loved her.  He was my  Prince; he loved her ardently.  He was ready to make any sacrifice and to  elevate her, the poor orphan, to the rank of Princess.  I loved her so  that I sacrificed the happiness of my love for her.  I forsook my native  land and wrote her I would release her from her vow.  I never saw her  again, except on her death-bed.  She died in giving birth to her first  daughter.  Now you know why I loved your Marie, and prolonged her life  from day to day.  She was the only being that linked my heart to this  life.  Bear life as I have borne it.  Lose not a day in useless  lamentation.  Help mankind whenever you can.  Love them and thank God  that you have seen and known and loved on this earth such a human heart  as hers--and that you have lost it.\"    \"_As God will_.\" said I, and we parted for life.          *      *      *      *      *    And days and weeks and months and years have flown.  Home is a stranger  to me, and a foreign land is my home.  But her love remains with me, and  as a tear drops into the ocean, so has her love dropped into the living  ocean of humanity and pervades and embraces millions--millions of the  \"strange people\" whom I have so loved from childhood.          *      *      *      *      *    Only on quiet summer days like this, when one in the green woods has  nature alone at heart, and knows not whether there are human beings.  without, or he is living entirely alone in the world, then there is a  stir in the graveyard of memory, the dead thoughts, rise again, the full  omnipotence of love returns to the heart and streams out from that  beautiful being who once looked upon me with her deep unfathomable eyes.  Then it seems as if the love for the millions were lost in the love for  the one, my good angel, and my thoughts are dumb in the presence of the  incomprehensible enigma of endless and everlasting love."]]]
