Then a Spanish sentry was caught asleep by  the advanced party of Maroons, who smelt him out by the match of his  fire-lock. In his gratitude for being protected from the Maroons, this  man confirmed the previous information.    The excitement now was most intense; for the crowning triumph of a  two-years' great adventure was at last within striking distance of the  English crew. Drake drew them up in proper order; and every man took off  his shirt and put it on again outside his coat, so that each would  recognize the others in the night attack. Then they lay listening for  the mule-bells, till presently the warning tinkle let them know that  _recuas_ were approaching from both Venta Cruz and Panama. The first, or  silver train from Venta Cruz, was to pass in silence; only the second,  or gold train from Panama, was to be attacked. Unluckily one of the  Englishmen had been secretly taking pulls at his flask and had just  become pot-valiant when a stray Spanish gentleman came riding up from  Venta Cruz. The Englishman sprang to his feet, swayed about, was  tripped up by Maroons and promptly sat upon. But the Spaniard saw his  shirt, reined up, whipped round, and galloped back to Panama. This took  place so silently at the extreme flank in towards Panama that it was not  observed by Drake or any other Englishman. Presently what appeared to be  the gold train came within range. Drake blew his whistle; and all set on  with glee, only to find that the Panama _recua_ they were attacking was  a decoy sent on to spring the trap and that the gold and jewels had been  stopped.    The Spaniards were up in arms. But Drake slipped away through the  engulfing forest and came out on the Atlantic side, where he found his  rear-guard intact and eager for further exploits. He was met by Captain  Tetu, a Huguenot just out from France, with seventy men. Tetu gave Drake  news of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, and this drew the French and  English Protestants together. They agreed to engage in further raiding  of Spaniards, share and share alike by nationalities, though Drake had  now only thirty-one men against Tetu's seventy. Nombre de Dios, they  decided, was not vulnerable, as all the available Spanish forces were  concentrated there for its defence, and so they planned to seize a  Spanish train of gold and jewels just far enough inland to give them  time to get away with the plunder before the garrison could reach them.  Somewhere on the coast they established a base of operations and then  marched overland to the Panama trail and lay in wait.    This time the marauders were successful. When the Spanish train of gold  and jewels came opposite the ambush, Drake's whistle blew. The leading  mules were stopped. The rest lay down, as mule-trains will. The guard  was overpowered after killing a Maroon and wounding Captain Tetu. And  when the garrison of Nombre de Dios arrived a few hours later the gold  and jewels had all gone.    For a day and a night and another day Drake and his men pushed on,  loaded with plunder, back to their rendezvous along the coast, leaving  Tetu and two of his devoted Frenchmen to be rescued later. When they  arrived, worn out, at the rendezvous, not a man was in sight. Drake  built a raft out of unhewn tree trunks and, setting up a biscuit bag as  a sail, pushed out with two Frenchmen and one Englishman till he found  his boats. The plunder was then divided up between the French and the  English, while Oxenham headed a rescue party to bring Tetu to the coast.  One Frenchman was found. But Tetu and the other had been caught by  Spaniards.    The _Pascha_ was given to the accumulated Spanish prisoners to sail away  in. The pinnaces were kept till a suitable, smart-sailing Spanish craft  was found, boarded, and captured to replace them; whereupon they were  broken up and their metal given to the Maroons. Then, in two frigates,  with ballast of silver and cargo of jewels and gold, the thirty  survivors of the adventure set sail for home. 'Within 23 days we passed  from the Cape of Florida to the Isles of Scilly, and so arrived at  Plymouth on Sunday about sermon time, August 9, 1573, at what time the  news of our Captain's return, brought unto his friends, did so speedily  pass over all the church, and surpass their minds with desire to see  him, that very few or none remained with the preacher, all hastening to  see the evidence of God's love and blessing towards our Gracious Queen  and country, by the fruit of our Captain's labour and success. _Soli Deo  Gloria._'          CHAPTER VII    DRAKE'S 'ENCOMPASSMENT OF ALL THE WORLDE'      When Drake left for Nombre de Dios in the spring of 1572, Spain and  England were both ready to fly at each other's throats. When he  Came back in the summer of 1573, they were all for making  friends--hypocritically so, but friends. Drake's plunder stank in the  nostrils of the haughty Dons. It was a very inconvenient factor in the  diplomatic problem for Elizabeth. Therefore Drake disappeared and his  plunder too. He went to Ireland on service in the navy. His plunder was  divided up in secrecy among all the high and low contracting parties.    In 1574 the Anglo-Spanish scene had changed again. The Spaniards had  been so harassed by the English sea-dogs between the Netherlands and  Spain that Philip listened to his great admiral, Menendez, who,  despairing of direct attack on England, proposed to seize the Scilly  Isles and from that naval base clear out a way through all the pirates  of the English Channel. War seemed certain. But a terrible epidemic  broke out in the Spanish fleet. Menendez died. And Philip changed his  policy again.    This same year John Oxenham, Drake's old second-in-command, sailed over  to his death. The Spaniards caught him on the Isthmus of Darien and  hanged him as a pirate at Lima in Peru.    In the autumn of 1575 Drake returned to England with a new friend,  Thomas Doughty, a soldier-scholar of the Renaissance, clever and good  company, but one of those 'Italianate' Englishmen who gave rise to the  Italian proverb: _Inglese italianato e diavolo incarnato--_'an  Italianized Englishman is the very Devil.' Doughty was patronized by the  Earl of Essex, who had great influence at court.    The next year, 1576, is noted for the 'Spanish Fury.' Philip's sea power  was so hampered by the Dutch and English privateers, and he was so  impotent against the English navy, that he could get no ready money,  either by loan or from America, to pay his troops in Antwerp. These men,  reinforced by others, therefore mutinied and sacked the whole of  Antwerp, killing all who opposed them and practically ruining the city  from which Charles V used to draw such splendid subsidies. The result  was a strengthening of Dutch resistance everywhere.    Elizabeth had been unusually tortuous in her policy about this time. But  in 1577 she was ready for another shot at Spain, provided always that it  entailed no open war. Don John of Austria, natural son of Charles V, had  all the shining qualities that his legitimate half-brother Philip  lacked. He was the hero of Lepanto and had offered to conquer the Moors  in Tunis if Philip would let him rule as king. Philip, crafty, cold, and  jealous, of course refused and sent him to the Netherlands instead. Here  Don John formed the still more aspiring plan of pacifying the Dutch,  marrying Mary Queen of Scots, deposing Elizabeth, and reigning over all  the British Isles. The Pope had blessed both schemes. But the Dutch  insisted on the immediate withdrawal of the Spanish troops. This  demolished Don John's plan. But it pleased Philip, who could now ruin  his brilliant brother by letting him wear himself out by trying to  govern the Netherlands without an army. Then the Duke of Anjou, brother  to the King of France, came into the fast-thickening plot at the head of  the French rescuers of the Netherlands from Spain. But a victorious  French army in the Netherlands was worse for England than even Spanish  rule there. So Elizabeth tried to support the Dutch enough to annoy  Philip and at the same time keep them independent of the French.    In her desire to support them against Philip indirectly she found it  convenient to call Drake into consultation. Drake then presented to Sir  Francis Walsingham his letter of commendation from the Earl of Essex,  under whom he had served in Ireland; whereupon 'Secretary Walsingham  [the first civilian who ever grasped the principle of modern sea power]  declared that Her Majesty had received divers injuries of the King of  Spain, for which she desired revenge. He showed me a plot [map] willing  me to note down where he might be most annoyed. But I refused to set my  hand to anything, affirming that Her Majesty was mortal, and that if it  should please God to take Her Majesty away that some prince might reign  that might be in league with the King of Spain, and then would my own  hand be a witness against myself.' Elizabeth was forty-four. Mary Queen  of Scots was watching for the throne. Plots and counter-plots were  everywhere.    Shortly after this interview Drake was told late at night that he should  have audience of Her Majesty next day. On seeing him, Elizabeth went  straight to the point. 'Drake, I would gladly be revenged on the King of  Spain for divers injuries that I have received.' 'And withal,' says  Drake, 'craved my advice therein; who told Her Majesty the only way was  to annoy him by the Indies.' On that he disclosed his whole daring  scheme for raiding the Pacific. Elizabeth, who, like her father, 'loved  a man' who was a man, fell in with this at once. Secrecy was of course  essential. 'Her Majesty did swear by her Crown that if any within her  realm did give the King of Spain to understand hereof they should lose  their heads therefor.' At a subsequent audience 'Her Majesty gave me"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12888"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 05 (#14)"],[1,"e, I behold even my present world in another light!  Nature and natural consequences in the destinies and actions of free  beings, in view of thee, are empty, unmeaning words. There is no  Nature more. Thou, thou alone, art.    It no longer appears to me the aim of the present world that the  above-mentioned state of universal peace among men, and of their  unconditioned empire over the mechanism of Nature, should be brought  about merely that it may exist, but that it should be brought about  by man himself, and, since it is calculated for all, then it should be  brought about by all, as one great, free, moral community. Nothing  new and better for the individual, except through his dutiful will,  nothing new and better for the community, except through their united,  dutiful will, is the fundamental law of the great moral kingdom of  which the present life is a part.    The reason why the good-will of the individual is so often lost for  this world, is that it is only the will of the individual, and that  the will of the majority does not coincide with it; therefore it has  no consequences but those which belong to a future world. Hence, even  the passions and vices of men appear to cooeperate in the promotion of  a better state, _not in and for themselves_--in this sense good can  never come out of evil--but by furnishing a counter-poise to opposite  vices, and finally annihilating those vices and themselves by their  preponderance. Oppression could never have gained the upper hand  unless cowardice, and baseness, and mutual distrust had prepared the  way for it. It will continue to increase until it eradicates cowardice  and the slavish mind; and despair re-awakens the courage that was  lost. Then the two antagonistic vices will have destroyed each other,  and the noblest in all human relations, permanent freedom, will have  come forth from them.    The actions of free beings have, strictly speaking, no other  consequences than those which affect other free beings. For only in  such, and for such, does a world exist; and that, wherein all agree,  is the world. But they have consequences in free agents only by  means of the infinite Will, by which all individuals exist. A call, a  revelation of that Will to us, is always a requirement to perform some  particular duty. Hence, even that which we call evil in the world, the  consequence of the abuse of freedom, exists only through _him_; and it  exists for all, for whom it exists, only so far as it imposes duties  upon them. Did it not fall within the eternal plan of our moral  education and the education of our whole race that precisely these  duties should be laid upon us, they would not have been imposed; and  that whereby they are imposed, and which we call evil, would never  have been. In this view, everything which takes place is good, and  absolutely accordant with the best ends. There is but one world  possible--a thoroughly good one. Everything that occurs in this world  conduces to the reformation and education of man, and, by means of  that, to the furtherance of his earthly destination.    It is this higher world-plan that we call Nature, when we say Nature  leads men through want to industry, through the evils of general  disorder to a righteous polity, through the miseries of their  perpetual wars to final, ever-during peace. Thy will, O Infinite, thy  providence alone, is this higher Nature! This too is best understood  by artless simplicity, which regards this life as a place of  discipline and education, as a school for eternity; which, in all  the fortunes it experiences, the most trivial as well as the most  momentous, beholds thy ordinations designed for good; and which firmly  believes that all things will work together for good to those who love  their duty and know thee.    O truly have I spent the former days of my life in darkness! Truly  have I heaped errors upon errors, and thought myself wise! Now only  out of thy mouth, wondrous Spirit, I fully understand the doctrine  which seemed so strange to me![3] although my understanding had  nothing to oppose to it. For now only I overlook it, in its whole  extent, in its deepest meaning, and in all its consequences.    Man is not a product of the world of the senses; and the end of his  existence can never be attained in that world. His destination lies  beyond time and space and all that pertains to the senses. He must  know what he is and what he is to make himself. As his destination  is sublime, so his thought must be able to lift itself above all the  bounds of the senses. This must be his calling. Where his being is  indigenous, there his thought must be indigenous also; and the most  truly human view, that which alone befits him, that in which his whole  power of thought is represented, is the view by which he lifts himself  above those limits, by which all that is of the senses is changed for  him into pure nothing, a mere reflection in mortal eyes of the alone  enduring, non-sensuous.    Many have been elevated to this view without scientific thought,  simply by their great heart and their pure moral instinct; because  they lived especially with the heart, and in the sentiments. They  denied, by their conduct, the efficacy and reality of the world of  the senses; and in the shaping of their purposes and measures, they  esteemed as nothing that concerning which they had not yet learned by  thinking that it is nothing, even to thought. They who could say, \"our  citizenship is in heaven; we have here no permanent place, but seek  one to come;\" they whose first principle was, to die to the world and  to be born anew, and, even here, to enter into another life--they,  truly, placed not the slightest value upon all the objects of sense,  and were, to use the language of the School, practical transcendental  Idealists.    Others who, in addition to the sensuous activity which is native to  us all, have, by their thought, confirmed themselves in the sensuous,  become implicated, and, as it were, grown together with it; they can  raise themselves permanently and perfectly above the sensuous only by  continuing and carrying out their thought. Otherwise, with the  purest moral intentions, they will still be drawn down again by their  understanding, and their whole being will remain a continued and  insoluble contradiction. For such, that philosophy, which I now first  entirely understand, is the power by which Psyche first strips off her  chrysalis, unfolds the wings on which she then hovers above herself,  and casts one glance on the slough she has dropped, thenceforth to  live and work in higher spheres.    Blessed be the hour in which I resolved to meditate on myself and my  destination! All my questions are solved. I know what I can know,  and I am without anxiety concerning that which I cannot know. I am  satisfied. There is perfect harmony and clearness in my spirit, and a  new and more glorious existence for that spirit begins.    My whole, complete destination, I do not comprehend. What I am  called to be and shall be, surpasses all my thought. A part of this  destination is yet hidden to me, visible only to him, the Father of  Spirits, to whom it is committed. I know only that it is secured to  me, and that it is eternal and glorious as himself. But that portion  of it which is committed to me, I know. I know it entirely, and it  is the root of all my other knowledge. I know, in every moment of my  life, with certainty, what I am to do in that moment. And this is my  whole destination, so far as it depends upon me. From this, since my  knowledge goes no farther, I must not depart. I must not desire to  know anything beyond it. I must stand fast in this one centre, and  take root in it. All my scheming and striving, and all my faculty,  must be directed to that. My whole existence must inweave itself with  it.           *       *       *       *       *    I raise myself to this viewpoint, and am a new creature. My whole  relation to the existing world is changed. The threads by which my  mind was heretofore bound to this world, and by whose mysterious  traction it followed all the movements of this world, are forever  severed, and I stand free--myself, my own world, peaceful and unmoved.  No longer with the heart, with the eye alone, I seize the objects  about me, and, through the eye alone, am connected with them. And this  eye itself, made clearer by freedom, looks through error and deformity  to the true and the beautiful; as, on the unmoved surface of the  water, forms mirror themselves pure and with a softened light.    My mind is forever closed against embarrassment and confusion, against  doubt and anxiety; my heart is forever closed against sorrow, and  remorse, and desire. There is but one thing that I care to know: What  I must do; and this I know, infallibly, always. Concerning all besides  I know nothing, and I know that I know nothing; and I root myself fast  in this my ignorance, and forbear to conjecture, to opine, to quarrel  with myself concerning that of which I know nothing. No event in this  world can move me to joy, and none to sorrow. Cold and unmoved I look  down upon them all; for I know that I cannot interpret one of them,  nor discern its connection with that which is my only concern.  Everything which takes place belongs to the plan of the eternal world,  and is good in relation to that plan; so much I know. But what, in  that plan, is pure gain, and what is only meant to remove existing  evil, accordingly what I should most or least rejoice in, I know not.  In his world everything succeeds. This suffices me, and in this faith  I stand firm as a rock. But what in his world is only germ, what  blossom, what the fruit itself, I know not. The only thing which can  interest me is the progress of reason and morality in the kingdom of  rational beings--and that purely for its own sake, for the sake of the  progress.
