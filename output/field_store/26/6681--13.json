I wouldn't be surprised but what that fellow--whoever he  was--whatever his object was--hoped to get in to see the casting;  either to get some idea about your new gun, or to do some desperate  deed to spoil it.\"    \"Do you think that, Ned?\"    \"I sure do. You've got to be on your guard, Tom.\"    \"I will. But I wonder what object anyone could have in spoiling my gun?\"    \"So as to make his own cannon stand in a better light.\"    \"Still thinking of General Waller, are you?\"    \"I am, Tom.\"    There was nothing more to be done at present, and, as it would take  several days for the big mass of metal to properly cool, Tom, Ned and  Mr. Damon returned to Shopton.    There Tom busied himself over many things. Ned helping him, and Mr.  Damon lending an occasional hand. Koku was very useful, for often his  great strength did what the combined efforts of Tom and his friends  could not accomplish.    As for Eradicate, he \"puttered around,\" doing all he could, which was  not much, for he was getting old. Still Tom would not think of  discharging him, and it was pitiful to see the old colored man try to  do things for the young inventor--tasks that were beyond his strength.  But if Koku offered to help, Eradicate would draw himself up, and  exclaim:    \"Git away fom heah! I guess dish yeah coon ain't forgot how t' wait on  Massa Tom. Go 'way, giant. I ain't so big as yo'-all, but I know de  English language, which is mo' 'n yo' all does. Go on an' lemme be!\"    Koku, good naturedly, gave place, for he, too, felt for Eradicate.    \"Well, Ned,\" remarked Tom one day, after the visit of the postman, \"I  have a letter from the steel people. They are going to take the gun out  of the mould tomorrow, and start to rifle it.  We'll take a run down in  the airship, and see how it looks. I must take those drawings, too,  that show the new plan of shrinking on the jackets. I guess I'll keep  them in my room, so I won't forget them.\"    Tom and Ned occupied adjoining and connecting apartments, for, of late,  Ned had taken up his residence with his chum. It was shortly after  midnight that Ned was awakened by hearing someone prowling about his  room. At first he thought it was Tom, for the shorter way to the bath  lay through Ned's apartment, but when the lad caught the flash of a  pocket electric torch he knew it could not be Tom.    \"Who's there?\" cried Ned sharply, sitting up in bed.    Instantly the light went out, and there was silence.    \"Who's there?\" cried Ned again.    This time he thought he heard a stealthy footstep.    \"What is it?\" called Tom from his chamber.    \"Someone is in here!\" exclaimed Ned. \"Look out, Tom!\"          CHAPTER XV    READY FOR THE TEST      Tom Swift acted promptly, for he realized the necessity. The events  that had hedged him about since he had begun work on his giant cannon  made him suspicious. He did not quite know whom to suspect, nor the  reasons for their actions, but he had been on the alert for several  days, and was now ready to act.    The instant Ned answered as he did, and warned Tom, the young inventor  slid his hand under his pillow and pressed an auxiliary electric switch  he had concealed there. In a moment the rooms were flooded with a  bright light, and the two lads had a momentary glimpse of an intruder  making a dive for the window.    \"There he is, Tom!\" cried Ned.    \"What do you want?\" demanded Tom, instinctively. But the intruder did  not stay to answer.    Instead, he made a dive for the casement. It was one story above the  ground, but this did not cause him any hesitation. It was summer, and  the window was open, though a wire mosquito net barred the aperture.  This was no hindrance to the man, however.    As Ned and Tom leaped from their beds, Ned catching up the heavy, empty  water pitcher as a weapon, and Tom an old Indian war club that served  as one of the ornaments of his room, the fellow, with one kick, burst  the screen.    Then, clambering out on the sill, he dropped from sight, the boys  hearing him land with a thud on the turf below. It was no great leap,  though the fall must have jarred him considerably, for the boys heard  him grunt, and then groan as if in pain.    \"Quick!\" cried Ned. \"Ring the bell for Koku, Ned. I want to capture  this fellow if possible.\"    \"Who is he?\" asked Ned.    \"I don't know, but we'll see if we can size him up. Signal for the  giant!\"    There was an electric bell from Tom's room to the apartment of his big  servant, and a speaking tube as well. While Ned was pressing the  button, and hastily telling the giant what had happened, urging him to  get in pursuit of the intruder, Tom had taken from his bureau a  powerful, portable, electric flash lamp, of the same variety as that  used by the would-be thief. Only Tom's was provided with a tungsten  filament, which gave a glaring white pencil of light, increased by  reflectors.    And in this glare the young inventor saw, speeding away over the lawn,  the form of a big man.    \"There he goes, Ned!\" he shouted.    \"So I see. Koku will be right on the job. I told him not to dress. Can  you make out who the fellow is?\"    \"No, his back is toward us. But he's limping, all right. I guess that  jump jarred him up a bit. Where is Koku?\"    \"There he goes now!\" exclaimed Ned, as a figure leaped from the side  door of the house--a gigantic figure, scantily clad.    \"Get to him, Koku!\" cried Tom.    \"Me git, Master!\" was the reply, and the giant sped on.    \"Let's go out and lend a hand!\" suggested Ned, looking at the water  pitcher as though wondering what he had intended to do with it.    \"I'm with you,\" agreed Tom. \"Only I want to get into something a little  more substantial than my pajamas.\"    As the two lads hurriedly slipped on some clothing they heard the voice  of Mr. Swift calling:    \"What is it, Tom? Has anything happened?\"    \"Nothing much,\" was the reassuring answer. \"It was a near-happening,  only Ned woke up in time. Someone was in our rooms--a burglar, I guess.\"    \"A burglar! Good land a massy!\" cried Eradicate, who had also gotten up  to see what the excitement was about. \"Did you cotch him, Massa Tom?\"    \"No, Rad; but Koku is after him.\"    \"Koku? Huh, he nebber cotch anybody. I'se got t' git out dere mahse'f!  Koku? Hu! I s'pects it's dat no-'count cousin ob mine, arter mah  chickens ag'in! I'll lambaste dat coon when I gits him, so I will. I'll  cotch him for yo'-all, Massa Tom,\" and, muttering to himself, the aged  colored man endeavored to assume the activity of former years.    \"Hark!\" exclaimed Ned, as he and Tom were about ready to take part in  the chase. \"What's that noise, Tom?\"    \"Sounds like a motor-cycle.\"    \"It is. That fellow--\"    \"It's the same chap!\" interrupted Tom. \"No use trying to chase him on  that speedy machine. He's a mile away from here by now. He must have  had it in waiting, ready for use. But come on, anyhow.\"    \"Where are you going?\"    \"Out to the shop. I want to see if he got in there.\"    \"But the charged wires?\"    \"He may have cut them. Come on.\"    It was as Tom had suspected. The deadly, charged wires, that formed a  protecting cordon about his shops, had been cut, and that by an  experienced hand, probably by someone wearing rubber gloves, who must  have come prepared for that very purpose. During the night the current  was supplied to the wires from a storage battery, through an  intensifying coil, so that the charge was only a little less deadly  than when coming direct from a dynamo.    \"This looks bad, Tom,\" said Ned.    \"It does, but wait until we get inside and look around. I'm glad I took  my gun-plans to the house with me.\"    But a quick survey of the shop did not reveal any damage done, nor had  anything been taken, as far as Tom could tell. The office of his main  shop was pretty well upset, and it looked as though the intruder had  made a search for something, and, not finding it, had entered the house.    \"It was the gun-plans he was after, all right,\" decided Tom.  \"And I  believe it was the same fellow who has been making trouble for me right  along.\"    \"You mean General Waller?\"    \"No, that German--the one who was at the machine shop.\"    \"But who is he--what is his object?\"    \"I don't know who he is, but he evidently wants my plans.  Probably  he's a disappointed inventor, who has been trying to make a gun  himself, and can't. He wants some of my ideas, but he isn't going to  get them. Well, we may as well get back to bed, after I connect these  wires again. I must think up a plan to conceal them, so they can't be  cut.\"    While Tom and Ned were engaged on this, Koku came back, much out of  breath, to report:    \"Me not git, Master. He git on bang-bang machine and go off--puff!\"    \"So we heard, Koku. Never mind, we'll get him yet.\"    \"Hu! Ef I had de fust chanst at him, I'd a cotched dat coon suah!\"  declared Eradicate, following the giant. \"Koku he done git in mah way!\"  and he glared indignantly at the big man.    \"That's all right, Rad,\" consoled Tom. \"You did your best. Now we'll  all get to bed. I don't believe he'll come back.\" Nor did he.    Tom and Ned were up at the first sign of daylight, for they wanted to  go to the steel works, some miles away, in time to see the cannon taken  out of the mould, and preparations made for boring the rifle channels.  They found the manager, anxiously waiting for them.    \"Some of my men are as interested in this as you are,\" he said to the  young inventor. \"A number of them declare that the cast will be a  failure, while some think it will be a success.\"    \"I think it will be all right,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13610"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 1 (#14)"],[1,"Medicean Venus--The  Sexual Factor of Modesty Based on Sexual Periodicity and on the Primitive  Phenomena of Courtship--The Necessity of Seclusion in Primitive Sexual  Intercourse--The Meaning of Coquetry--The Sexual Charm of Modesty--Modesty  as an Expression of Feminine Erotic Impulse--The Fear of Causing Disgust  as a Factor of Modesty--The Modesty of Savages in Regard to Eating in the  Presence of Others--The Sacro-Pubic Region as a Focus of Disgust--The Idea  of Ceremonial Uncleanliness--The Custom of Veiling the Face--Ornaments and  Clothing--Modesty Becomes Concentrated in the Garment--The Economic Factor  in Modesty--The Contribution of Civilization to Modesty--The Elaboration  of Social Ritual.      That modesty--like all the closely-allied emotions--is based on fear, one  of the most primitive of the emotions, seems to be fairly evident.[4] The  association of modesty and fear is even a very ancient observation, and is  found in the fragments of Epicharmus, while according to one of the most  recent definitions, \"modesty is the timidity of the body.\" Modesty is,  indeed, an agglomeration of fears, especially, as I hope to show, of two  important and distinct fears: one of much earlier than human origin, and  supplied solely by the female; the other of more distinctly human  character, and of social, rather than sexual, origin.    A child left to itself, though very bashful, is wholly devoid of  modesty.[5] Everyone is familiar with the shocking _inconvenances_ of  children in speech and act, with the charming ways in which they  innocently disregard the conventions of modesty their elders thrust upon  them, or, even when anxious to carry them out, wholly miss the point at  issue: as when a child thinks that to put a little garment round the neck  satisfies the demands of modesty. Julius Moses states that modesty in the  uncovering of the sexual parts begins about the age of four. But in cases  when this occurs it is difficult to exclude teaching and example. Under  civilized conditions the convention of modesty long precedes its real  development. Bell has found that in love affairs before the age of nine  the girl is more aggressive than the boy and that at that age she begins  to be modest.[6] It may fairly be said that complete development of  modesty only takes place at the advent of puberty.[7] We may admit, with  Perez, one of the very few writers who touch on the evolution of this  emotion, that modesty may appear at a very early age if sexual desire  appears early.[8] We should not, however, be justified in asserting that  on this account modesty is a purely sexual phenomenon. The social impulses  also develop about puberty, and to that coincidence the compound nature of  the emotion of modesty may well be largely due.    The sexual factor is, however, the simplest and most primitive element of  modesty, and may, therefore, be mentioned first. Anyone who watches a  bitch, not in heat, when approached by a dog with tail wagging gallantly,  may see the beginnings of modesty. When the dog's attentions become a  little too marked, the bitch squats firmly down on the front legs and hind  quarters though when the period of oestrus comes her modesty may be flung  to the air and she eagerly turns her hind quarters to her admirer's nose  and elevates her tail high in the air. Her attitude of refusal is  equivalent, that is to say, to that which in the human race is typified by  the classical example of womanly modesty in the Medicean Venus, who  withdraws the pelvis, at the same time holding one hand to guard the  pubes, the other to guard the breasts.[9] The essential expression in each  case is that of defence of the sexual centers against the undesired  advances of the male.[10]        Stratz, who criticizes the above statement, argues (with      photographs of nude women in illustration) that the normal type      of European surprised modesty is shown by an attitude in which      the arms are crossed over the breast, the most sexually      attractive region, while the thighs are pressed together, one      being placed before the other, the shoulder raised and the back      slightly curved; occasionally, he adds, the hands may be used to      cover the face, and then the crossed arms conceal the breasts.      The Medicean Venus, he remarks, is only a pretty woman coquetting      with her body. Canova's Venus in the Pitti (who has drapery in      front of her, and presses her arms across her breast) being a      more accurate rendering of the attitude of modesty. But Stratz      admits that when a surprised woman is gazed at for some time, she      turns her head away, sinks or closes her eyes, and covers her      pubes (or any other part she thinks is being gazed at) with one      hand, while with the other she hides her breast or face. This he      terms the secondary expression of modesty. (Stratz, _Die      Frauenkleidung_, third ed., p. 23.)        It is certainly true that the Medicean Venus merely represents an      artistic convention, a generalized tradition, not founded on      exact and precise observation of the gestures of modesty, and it      is equally true that all the instinctive movements noted by      Stratz are commonly resorted to by a woman whose nakedness is      surprised. But in the absence of any series of carefully recorded      observations, one may doubt whether the distinction drawn by      Stratz between the primary and the secondary expression of      modesty can be upheld as the general rule, while it is most      certainly not true for every case. When a young woman is      surprised in a state of nakedness by a person of the opposite, or      even of the same, sex, it is her instinct to conceal the primary      centers of sexual function and attractiveness, in the first      place, the pubes, in the second place the breasts. The exact      attitude and the particular gestures of the hands in achieving      the desired end vary with the individual, and with the      circumstances. The hand may not be used at all as a veil, and,      indeed, the instinct of modesty itself may inhibit the use of the      hand for the protection of modesty (to turn the back towards the      beholder is often the chief impulse of blushing modesty, even      when clothed), but the application of the hand to this end is      primitive and natural. The lowly Fuegian woman, depicted by      Hyades and Deniker, who holds her hand to her pubes while being      photographed, is one at this point with the Roman Venus described      by Ovid (_Ars Amatoria_, Book  II):--            \"Ipsa Venus pubem, quoties velamnia ponit,          Protegitur laeva semireducta manus.\"        It may be added that young men of the lower social classes, at      all events in England, when bathing at the seaside in complete      nudity, commonly grasp the sexual organs with one hand, for      concealment, as they walk up from the sea.    The sexual modesty of the female animal is rooted in the sexual  periodicity of the female, and is an involuntary expression of the organic  fact that the time for love is not now. Inasmuch as this fact is true of  the greater part of the lives of all female animals below man, the  expression itself becomes so habitual that it even intrudes at those  moments when it has ceased to be in place. We may see this again  illustrated in the bitch, who, when in heat, herself runs after the male,  and again turns to flee, perhaps only submitting with much persuasion to  his embrace. Thus, modesty becomes something more than a mere refusal of  the male; it becomes an invitation to the male, and is mixed up with his  ideas of what is sexually desirable in the female. This would alone serve  to account for the existence of modesty as a psychical secondary sexual  character. In this sense, and in this sense only, we may say, with Colin  Scott, that \"the feeling of shame is made to be overcome,\" and is thus  correlated with its physical representative, the hymen, in the rupture of  which, as Groos remarks, there is, in some degree, a disruption also of  modesty. The sexual modesty of the female is thus an inevitable by-product  of the naturally aggressive attitude of the male in sexual relationships,  and the naturally defensive attitude of the female, this again being  founded on the fact that, while--in man and the species allied to him--the  sexual function in the female is periodic, and during most of life a  function to be guarded from the opposite sex, in the male it rarely or  never needs to be so guarded.[11]    Both male and female, however, need to guard themselves during the  exercise of their sexual activities from jealous rivals, as well as from  enemies who might take advantage of their position to attack them. It is  highly probable that this is one important sexual factor in the  constitution of modesty, and it helps to explain how the male, not less  than the female, cultivates modesty, and shuns publicity, in the exercise  of sexual functions. Northcote has especially emphasized this element in  modesty, as originating in the fear of rivals. \"That from this seeking  after secrecy from motives of fear should arise an instinctive feeling  that the sexual act must always be hidden, is a natural enough sequence.  And since it is not a long step between thinking of an act as needing  concealment and thinking of it as wrong, it is easily conceivable that  sexual intercourse comes to be regarded as a stolen and therefore, in some  degree, a sinful pleasure.\"[12]    Animals in a state of nature usually appear to seek seclusion for sexual  intercourse, although this instinct is lost under domestication. Even the  lowest savages, also, if uncorrupted by civilized influences, seek the  solitude of the forest or the protection of their huts for the same  purpose; the rare cases in which coitus is public seem usually to involve  a ceremonial or social observance, rather than mere"]]]
