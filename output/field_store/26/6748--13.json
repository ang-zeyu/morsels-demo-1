Without regarding what I said, he instantly seized my  cane, and twisted it, as you see; but I will make him repent of it.\"    5. \"To be sure,\" said Stephen, \"he is a very wicked boy, and is already  very properly punished for being such, since nobody likes him or will have  anything to do with him. He can scarcely find a companion to play with  him; and is often at a loss for amusement, as he deserves to be. This,  properly considered, I think will appear sufficient revenge for you.\"    6. \"All this is true,\" replied Philip, \"but he has broken my cane. It was  a present from my father, and a very pretty cane it was. I offered to fill  his pitcher for him again, as I knocked it down by accident. I will be  revenged.\"    7. \"Now, Philip;\" said Stephen, \"I think you will act better in not  minding him, as your contempt will be the best punishment you can inflict  upon him. Be assured, he will always be able to do more mischief to you  than you choose to do to him. And, now I think of it, I will tell you what  happened to him not long since.\"    8. \"Very unluckily for him, he chanced to see a bee hovering about a  flower which he caught, and was going to pull off its wings out of sport,  when the animal stung him, and flew away in safety to the hive. The pain  put him into a furious passion, and, like you, he vowed revenge. He  accordingly procured a stick, and thrust it into the beehive.\"    9. \"In an instant the whole swarm flew out, and alighting upon him stung  him in a hundred different places. He uttered the most piercing cries, and  rolled upon the ground in the excess of his agony. His father immediately  ran to him, but could not put the bees to flight until they had stung him  so severely that he was confined several days to his bed.\"    l0. \"Thus, you see, he was not very successful in his pursuit of revenge.  I would advise you, therefore, to pass over his insult. He is a wicked  boy, and much stronger than you; so that your ability to obtain this  revenge may be doubtful.\"    11. \"I must own,\" replied Philip, \"that your advice seems very good. So  come along with me, and I will tell my father the whole matter, and I  think he will not be angry with me.\" They went, and Philip told his father  what had happened. He thanked Stephen for the good advice he had given his  son, and promised Philip to give him another cane exactly like the first.    12. A few days afterward, Philip saw this ill-natured boy fall as he was  carrying home a heavy log of wood, which he could not lift up again.  Philip ran to him, and helped him to replace it on his shoulder. Young  Robinson was quite ashamed at the thought of this unmerited kindness, and  heartily repented of his behavior. Philip went home quite satisfied.  \"This,\" said he, \"is the noblest vengeance I could take, in returning good  for evil. It is impossible I should repent of it.\"      DEFINITIONS.--l.

Come to the sunset tree,       The day is past and gone;     The woodman's ax lies free,       And the reaper's work is done;     The twilight star to heaven,       And the summer dew to flowers,     And rest to us is given,       By the soft evening hours.    2. Sweet is the hour of rest,       Pleasant the woods' low sigh,     And the gleaming of the west,       And the turf whereon we lie,     When the burden and the heat       Of the laborer's task is o'er,     And kindly voices greet       The tired one at the door.    3. Yes, tuneful is the sound       That dwells in whispering boughs:     Welcome the freshness round,       And the gale that fans our brows;     But rest more sweet and still       Than ever the nightfall gave,     Our yearning hearts shall fill,       In the world beyond the grave.    4. There, shall no tempests blow,       Nor scorching noontide heat;     There, shall be no more snow,       No weary, wandering feet;     So we lift our trusting eyes       From the hills our fathers trod,     To the quiet of the skies,       To the Sabbath of our God.        XXXV. HOW MARGERY WONDERED. (99)  By Lucy Larcom.    1. One bright morning late in March, little Margery put on her hood and  her Highland plaid shawl, and went trudging across the beach. It was the  first time she had been trusted out alone, for Margery was a little girl;  nothing about her was large, except her round gray eyes, which had yet  scarcely opened upon half a dozen springs and summers.    2. There was a pale mist on the far-off sea and sky, and up around the sun  were white clouds edged with the hues of pinks and violets. The sunshine  and the mild air made Margery's very heart feel warm, and she let the soft  wind blow aside her Highland shawl, as she looked across the waters at the  sun, and wondered! For, somehow, the sun had never looked before as it did  to-day;--it seemed like a great golden flower bursting out of its  pearl-lined calyx,--a flower without a stem. Or was there a strong stem  away behind it in the sky, that reached down below the sea, to a root,  nobody could guess where?    3. Margery did not stop to puzzle herself about the answer to her  question, for now the tide, was coming in, and the waves, little at first,  but growing larger every moment, were crowding up along the sand and  pebbles, laughing, winking, and whispering, as they tumbled over each  other, like thousands of children hurrying home from somewhere, each with  its own precious little secret to tell.    4. Where did the waves come from? Who was down there under the blue wall  of the horizon, with the hoarse, hollow voice, urging and pushing them  across the beach at her feet? And what secret was it they were lisping to  each other with their pleasant voices? Oh, what was there beneath the sea,  and beyond the sea, so deep, so broad, and so dim, too, away off where the  white ships, that looked smaller than sea birds, were gliding out and in?    5. But while Margery stood still for a moment on a dry rock, and wondered,  there came a low, rippling warble to her ear from a cedar tree on the  cliff above her. It had been a long winter, and Margery had forgotten that  there were birds, and that birds could sing. So she wondered again what  the music was.    6. And when she saw the bird perched on a yellow-brown bough, she wondered  yet more. It was only a bluebird, but then it was the first bluebird  Margery had ever seen. He fluttered among the prickly twigs, and looked as  if he had grown out of them, as the cedar berries had, which were dusty  blue, the color of his coat. But how did the music get in his throat? And  after it was in his throat, how could it untangle itself, and wind itself  off so evenly? And where had the bluebird flown from, across the snow  banks down to the shore of the blue sea?    7. The waves sang a welcome to him, and he sang a welcome to the waves;  they seemed to know each other well; and the ripple and the warble sounded  so much alike, the bird and the wave must have both learned their music of  the same teacher. And Margery kept on wondering as she stepped between the  song of the bluebird and the echo of the sea, and climbed a sloping bank,  just turning faintly green in the spring sunshine.    8. The grass was surely beginning to grow! There were fresh, juicy shoots  running up among the withered blades of last year, as if in hopes of  bringing them back to life; and closer down she saw the sharp points of  new spears peeping from their sheaths. And scattered here and there were  small, dark green leaves folded around buds shut up so tightly that only  those who had watched them many seasons could tell what flowers were to be  let out of their safe prisons by and by. So no one could blame Margery for  not knowing that they were only common things, nor for stooping over the  tiny buds, and wondering.    9. What made the grass come up so green out of the black earth? And how  did the buds know when it was time to take off their little green hoods,  and see what there was in the world around them? And how came they to be  buds at all? Did they bloom in another world before they sprung up  here?--and did they know, themselves, what kind of flowers they should  blossom into? Had flowers souls, like little girls, that would live in  another world when their forms had faded away in this?    10. Margery thought she would like to sit down on the bank, and wait  beside the buds until they opened; perhaps they would tell her their  secret if the very first thing they saw was her eyes watching them. One  bud was beginning to unfold; it was streaked with yellow in little stripes  that she could imagine became wider every minute. But she would not touch  it, for it seemed almost as much alive as herself. She only wondered, and  wondered!    11. Margery heard her mother calling her, and she trudged home across the  shells and pebbles with a pleasant smile dimpling her cheeks; for she felt  very much at home in this large, wonderful world, and was happy to be  alive, although she neither could have told, nor cared to know, the reason  why. But when her mother unpinned the little girl's Highland shawl, and  took off her hood, she said, \"O mother, do let me live on the doorstep! I  don't like houses to stay in. What makes everything so pretty and so glad?  Don't you like to wonder?\"    12. Margery's mother was "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14883"],[0,"Grandmother Elsie (#14)"],[1,"the mother would be away at Roselands for a day or two, taking turns in  ministering to Mrs. Conly, and comforting and cheering her feeble old  father.    \"You have no idea, my dear sir,\" the captain one day remarked to his host,  \"how delightful it is to a man who has passed most of his life on  shipboard, away from women and children, to be taken into such a family  circle as this! I think you who live in it a highly favored man, sir!\"    \"I quite agree with you,\" Mr. Dinsmore said \"I think we are an  exceptionally happy family, though not exempt from the trials incident to  life in this world of sin and sorrow.\"    \"Your daughter is an admirable mother,\" the captain went on, \"so gentle  and affectionate, and yet so firm; her children show by their behavior  that their training has been very nearly ii not quite faultless. And in  seeing so much of them I realize as never before the hardship of the  constant separation from my own which my profession entails, as I ask  myself, 'If I were with them thus day after day, should I find them as  obedient, docile, and intelligent as these little ones? Will my Max be as  fine a lad as Harold or Herbert? Can I hope to see Lulu and Gracie growing  up into such lovely maidenhood as that of Miss Violet?\"    \"I sincerely hope you may be so blessed, captain,\" Mr. Dinsmore said, \"but  much will depend upon the training to which they are subjected. There is  truth in the old proverb, 'Just as the twig is bent the tree's inclined.'\"    \"Yes, sir; and a higher authority says, 'Train up a child in the way he  should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.' But my  difficulty is that I can neither train them myself, nor see that the work  is rightly done by others.\"    \"That is sad, indeed,\" Mr. Dinsmore replied with sincere sympathy. \"But,  my dear sir, is there not strong consolation in the thought that you can  pray for them, and that 'the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man  availeth much'?\"    \"There is indeed, sir!\" the captain said with emotion. \"And also in the  promise, 'I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed  after thee in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God  unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.'\"          CHAPTER X.        \"One Pinch, hungry, leanfac'd villain.\"                              --_Shake._      Captain Raymond's two little daughters were at this time in a village in  one of the Northern States, in charge of Mrs. Beulah Scrimp, a distant  relative on the mother's side.    Mrs. Scrimp was a widow living in rather genteel style in a house and upon  means left her by her late husband. She was a managing woman, fond of  money; therefore glad of the increase to her income yielded by the liberal  sum Captain Raymond had offered her as compensation for the board and care  of his motherless little girls.    She had undertaken Max also at first, but given him up as beyond her  control; and now, though continuing to attend school in the town, he  boarded with the Rev. Thomas Fox, who lived upon its outskirts.    Mrs. Scrimp was a woman of economies, keeping vigilant watch over all  expenditures, great and small, and employing one servant only, who was  cook, housemaid, and laundress all in one, and expected to give every  moment of her time to the service of her mistress, and be content with  smaller wages than many who did less work.    Mrs. Scrimp was a woman of theories also, and her pet one accorded well  with the aforementioned characteristic. It was that two meals a day were  sufficient for any one, and that none but the very vigorous and  hard-working ought to eat anything between three o'clock in the afternoon  and breakfast-time the next morning.    That was a rule to which neither Max nor Lulu could ever be made to  submit; but Grace, the youngest, a delicate, fragile child, with little  force of will, had no strength or power to resist, so fell a victim to the  theory; each night went supperless to bed, and each day found herself too  feeble and languid to take part in the active sports in which her stronger  sister delighted.    It is quite possible that Mrs. Scrimp had no intention of being cruel, but  merely made the not uncommon mistake of supposing that what is good for  one person is of course good for everybody else. She was dyspeptic, and  insisted that she found her favorite plan exceedingly beneficial in her  own case; therefore she was sure so delicate a child as Gracie ought to  conform to the same regimen.    She seemed fond of the little girl, petted and caressed her, calling her  by many an endearing name, and telling her very often that she was \"a  good, biddable child; far better than fiery-tempered, headstrong Lulu.\"    Lulu would hear the remark with a scornful smile and toss of the head,  sometimes saying proudly, \"I wouldn't let anybody call you names to me,  Gracie; and I wouldn't be such a little goose as to be wheedled and  flattered into putting up with being half-starved.\"    There had been a time when Mrs. Scrimp tried to prevent and punish such  daring words, but she had given it up long since, and contented herself  with sighing sadly over the \"depravity of that irrepressible child.\"    She had once or twice threatened to write to Captain Raymond and tell him  that Lulu was unmanageable, but the child coolly replied, \"I wish you  would; for then papa would send Gracie and me somewhere else to stay.\"    \"Where you would, perhaps, fare a great deal worse,\" returned Mrs. Scrimp  wrathfully.    \"I am willing to risk it,\" Lulu said; and that was the end of it, for Mrs.  Scrimp would have been very loath to lose the children's board.    One pleasant October morning Lulu came down a trifle late to her  breakfast. Mrs. Scrimp and Gracie were already seated at the table and  had began their meal.    \"Lulu,\" said Mrs. Scrimp with a portentous frown, \"you were in the pantry  last night, helping yourself.\"    \"Of course I was,\" returned the child as she took her seat at the table.  \"I told you I wouldn't go without my supper, and you didn't have Ann get  any for me; so what could I do but go and help myself?\"    \"You have no right to go to my pantry and take the food that belongs to  me. It's neither more nor less than stealing, Miss Lulu Raymond.\"    \"Well, Aunt Beulah, what do you call it when you take the money my father  pays you for feeding Gracie and me, and don't give us the food he has paid  for?\"    Mrs. Scrimp colored violently at that, but quickly answered, \"He doesn't  pay for any particular kind or quantity, and doesn't want you overfed; and  I don't consider it at all good for you to eat after three o'clock, as  I've told you fifty times.\"    \"Oftener than that, I dare say,\" returned Lulu with indifference, \"but you  might say it five hundred times and I shouldn't believe it a bit the more.  Papa and mamma never had us put to bed without our supper; they always  gave us plenty to eat whenever we were hungry, and Gracie was far  stronger then than she is now.\"    Mrs. Scrimp was exasperated into a return to old tactics. \"Lulu, you are  the most impudent child I ever saw!\" she exclaimed, \"and shall go without  supper to-night, if it were only to punish you for talking as you have  this morning.\"    \"No, I'll not. I'll have something to eat if I must go to the neighbors  for it.\"    \"I'll lock you up.\"    \"Then I'll call out to the people in the street and tell them you won't  give me enough to eat. And just as soon as papa comes I'll tell him all  about it right before you.\"    \"You wouldn't dare tell him how you've talked to me; he'd punish you for  your impertinence.\"    \"No, he would say it was justifiable under the circumstances.\"    \"Dear me!\" sighed Mrs. Scrimp, lifting hands and eyes in holy horror,  \"what a time your stepmother will have with you! I shouldn't want to be in  her place.\"    \"My stepmother!\" cried Lulu, growing very red, while her dark eyes flashed  with anger. \"I haven't any! What do you mean by talking in that way, Aunt  Beulah?\"    Mrs. Scrimp's laugh jarred very unpleasantly upon the nerves of the  excited child.    \"Your father will be presenting you with one some of these days, I'll  warrant,\" she said in a tantalizing tone.    Lulu felt ready to burst into passionate weeping, but would not give her  tormentor the satisfaction of seeing her do so. She struggled determinedly  with her emotion, and presently was able to say in a tone of perfect  indifference: \"Well, I don't care if he does; anything will be better than  staying here with you.\"    \"Ungrateful, hateful child!\" said Mrs. Scrimp. \"Gracie's a real comfort to  me, but you are just the opposite.\"    \"Aunt Beulah,\" said Lulu, fixing her keen eyes steadily upon Mrs. Scrimp's  face, \"you've called me ungrateful ever so many times. Now I'd like to  know what I have to be grateful for toward you? My father pays you well  for everything you do for Gracie and me.\"    \"There are some things that can't be bought with money, and that money  can't pay for, Miss Impertinence;\" and Mrs. Scrimp, having satisfied her  appetite, rose from the table and, taking Gracie by the hand, walked out  of the room with her in the most dignified manner.    Presently afterward Lulu saw her, through the window, in bonnet and shawl  and with a basket on her arm, going out to do the marketing.    Having finished her breakfast, Lulu walked into the sitting-room.    Gracie lay on the sofa looking pale and weak. Lulu went to her, stroked  her hair, and kissed her.    \"Poor little Gracie! weren't you hungry for some supper last night?\"    \"Yes, Lulu,\" replied the child, lifting a thin white little hand and  stroking her sister's face, \"but Aunt Beulah says it makes me worse to eat  at night.\"    \"I don't believe it!\" cried Lulu vehemently, and half stamping her foot,  \"and I'm going to write a letter to papa and tell him how she starves you,  and would starve me too if I'd let her!\"    \"I wish papa would"]]]
