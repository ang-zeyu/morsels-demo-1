Besides, he was, in fact, in a state of mental  derangement, and in his uninterrupted alienation he could not be expected  to behave, as if he had still retained some use of reason.    We were now only twenty-seven remaining; of this number but fifteen seemed  likely to live some days: all the rest, covered with large wounds, had  almost entirely lost their reason; yet they had a share in the distribution  of provisions, and might, before their death, consume thirty or forty  bottles of wine, which were of inestimable value to us. We deliberated  thus: to put the sick on half allowance would have been killing them by  inches. So after a debate, at which the most dreadful despair presided, it  was resolved to throw them into the sea. This measure, however repugnant it  was to ourselves, procured the survivors wine for six days; when the  decision was made, who would dare to execute it? The habit of seeing death  ready to pounce upon us as his prey, the certainly of our infallible  destruction, without this fatal expedient, every thing in a word, had  hardened our hearts, and rendered them callous to all feeling except that  of self preservation. Three sailors and a soldier took on themselves this  cruel execution: we turned our faces aside, and wept tears of blood over  the fate of these unhappy men. Among them were the unfortunate woman and  her husband. Both of them had been severely wounded in the various combats:  the woman had a thigh broken between the pieces of wood composing the raft,  and her husband had received a deep wound with a sabre on his head. Every  thing announced their speedy dissolution. We must seek to console  ourselves, by the belief, that our cruel resolution shortened, but for a  few moments only, the measure of their existence.    This French woman, to whom soldiers and Frenchmen gave the sea for a tomb,  had partaken for twenty years in the glorious fatigues of our armies; for  twenty years she had afforded to the brave, on the field of battle, either  the assistance which they needed, or soothing consolations ... It is in the  midst of her friends; it is by the hands of her friends ... Readers, who  shudder at the cry of outraged humanity, recollect at least, that it was  other men, fellow countrymen, comrades, who had placed us in this horrible  situation.    This dreadful expedient saved the fifteen who remained; for, when we were  found by the Argus, we had very little wine left, and it was the sixth day  after the cruel sacrifice which we have just described: the victims, we  repeat it, had not above forty-eight hours to live, and by keeping them on  the raft, we should absolutely have been destitute of the means of  existence two days before we were found. Weak as we were, we considered it  as certain that it would have been impossible for us to hold out, even  twenty-four hours, without taking some food. After this catastrophe, which  inspired us with a degree of horror not to be overcome, we threw the arms  into the sea; we reserved, however, one sabre in case it should be wanted  to cut a rope or piece of wood.    After all this, we had scarcely sufficient food on the raft, to last for  the six days, and they were the most wretched immaginable. Our dispositions  had become soured: even in sleep, we figured to ourselves the sad end of  all our unhappy companions, and we loudly invoked death.    A new event, for every thing was an _event_ for wretches for whom the  universe was reduced to a flooring of a few toises in extent, who were the  sport of the winds and waves, as they hung suspended over the abyss; an  event then happened which happily diverted our attention from the horrors  of our situation. All at once a white butterfly, of the species so common  in France, appeared fluttering over our heads, and settled on our sail. The  first idea which, as it were, inspired each of us made us consider this  little animal as the harbinger, which brought us the news of a speedy  approach to land, and we snatched at this hope with a kind of delirium of  joy. But it was the ninth day that we passed upon the raft; the torments of  hunger consumed our entrails; already some of the soldiers and sailors  devoured, with haggard eyes, this wretched prey, and seemed ready to  dispute it with each other. Others considered this butterfly as a messenger  of heaven, declared that they took the poor insect under their protection,  and hindered any injury being done to it. We turned our wishes and our eyes  towards the land, which we so ardently longed for, and which we every  moment fancied we saw rise before us. It is certain that we could not be  far from it: for the butterflies continued, on the following days, to come  and flutter about our sail, and the same day we had another sign equally  positive: for we saw a (_goeland_) flying over our raft. This second  visitor did not allow us to doubt of our being very near to the African  shore, and we persuaded ourselves that we should soon be thrown upon the  coast by the force of the currents. How often did we then, and in the  following days, invoke a tempest to throw us on the coast, which, it seemed  to us, we were on the point of touching.    The hope which had just penetrated the inmost recesses of our souls,  revived our enfeebled strength, and inspired us with an ardour, an  activity, of which we should not have thought ourselves capable. We again  had recourse to all the means which we had before employed, to catch fish.  Above all, we eagerly longed for the (goeland), which appeared several  times tempted to settle on the end of our machine. The impatience of our  desire increased, when we saw several of its companions join it, and keep  following us till our deliverance; but all attempts to draw them to us were  in vain; not one of them suffered itself to be taken by the snares we had  laid for them. Thus our destiny, on the fatal raft, was to be incessantly  tossed between transitory illusions and continued torments, and we never  experienced an agreeable sensation without being, in a manner, condemned to  atone for it, by the anguish of some new suffering, by the irritating pangs  of hope always deceived.    Another care employed us this day; as soon as we were reduced to a small  number, we collected the little strength we had remaining; we loosened some  planks on the front of the raft, and with some pretty long pieces of wood,  raised in the center a kind of platform, on which we reposed: all the  effects which we had been able to collect, were placed upon it, and served  to render it less hard; besides, they hindered the sea from passing with so  much facility through the intervals between the different pieces of the  raft; but the waves came across, and sometimes covered us entirely.    It was on this new theatre that we resolved to await death in a manner  worthy of Frenchmen, and with perfect resignation. The most adroit among  us, to divert our thoughts, and to make the time pass with more rapidity,  got their comrades to relate to us their passed triumphs, and sometimes, to  draw comparisons between the hardships they had undergone in their glorious  campaigns, and the distresses we endured upon our raft. The following is  what Lavillette the serjeant of artillery told us: \"I have experienced, in  my various naval campaigns, all the fatigues, all the privations and all  the dangers, which it is possible to meet with at sea, but none of my past  sufferings, is comparable to the extreme pain and privations which I endure  here. In my last campaigns in 1813 and 1814, in Germany and France, I  shared all the fatigues which were alternately caused us by victory and  retreat, I was at the glorious days of Lutzen, Bautzen, Dresden, Leipzig,  Hanau, Montmirail, Champaubert, Montereau,\" &c. \"Yes,\" continued he, \"all  that I suffered in so many forced marches, and in the midst of the  privations which were the consequences of them, was nothing in comparison  with what I endure on this frightful machine. In those days, when the  French valour shewed itself in all its lustre, and always worthy of a free  people, I had hardly anything to fear, but during the battle; but here, I  often have the same dangers, and what is more dreadful, I have to combat  Frenchmen and comrades. I have to contend, besides, with hunger and thirst,  with a tempestuous sea, full of dangerous monsters, and with the ardour of  a burning sun, which is not the least of our enemies. Covered with ancient  scars and fresh wounds, which I have no means of dressing, it is physically  impossible for me to save myself from this extreme danger, if it should be  prolonged for a few days.\"    The sad remembrance of the critical situation of our country also mingled  with our grief; and certainly, of all the afflictions we experienced, this  was not the least, to us, who had almost all of us left it, only that we  might no longer be witnesses of the hard laws, of the afflicting  dependence, under which, it is bowed down by enemies jealous of our glory  and of our power. These thoughts, we do not fear to say so, and to boast of  it, afflicted us still more than the inevitable death which we were almost  certain of meeting on our raft. Several of us regretted not having fallen  in the defence of France. At least, said they, if it had been possible for  us to measure our strength once more, with the enemies of our independence,  and our liberty! Others found some consolation in the death which awaited  us, because we should no longer have to groan under the shameful yoke which  oppresses the country. Thus passed the last days of our abode on the raft.  Our time was almost wholly employed in speaking of our unhappy country: all  our wishes, our last prayers were for the happiness of France.    During the first days and nights of our being abandoned, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1182"],[0,"Dope (#14)"],[1,"intentions were strictly  creditable, by some malignancy of fate, possessed no influence whatever.  She came to regard herself as a peculiarly unlucky girl, being ignorant  of the fact that Fortune, an impish hierophant, imposes identical tests  upon every candidate who aspires to the throne of a limelight princess.    Matters stood thus when a new suitor appeared in the person of Sir  Lucien Pyne. When his card was brought up to Rita, her heart leaped  because of a mingled emotion of triumph and fear which the sight of the  baronet's name had occasioned. He was a director of the syndicate in  whose production she was playing--a man referred to with awe by  every girl in the company as having it in his power to make or mar a  professional reputation. Not that he took any active part in the affairs  of the concern; on the contrary, he was an aristocrat who held himself  aloof from all matters smacking of commerce, but at the same time one  who invested his money shrewdly. Sir Lucien's protegee of today was  London's idol of tomorrow, and even before Rita had spoken to him she  had fought and won a spiritual battle between her true self and that  vain, admiration-loving Rita Dresden who favored capitulation.    She knew that Sir Lucien's card represented a signpost at the  cross-roads where many a girl, pretty but not exceptionally talented,  had hesitated with beating heart. It was no longer a question of  remaining a member of the chorus (and understudy for a small part) or  of accepting promotion to \"lead\" in a new production; it was that of  accepting whatever Sir Lucien chose to offer--or of retiring from the  profession so far as this powerful syndicate was concerned.    Such was the reputation enjoyed at this time by Sir Lucien Pyne among  those who had every opportunity of forming an accurate opinion.    Nevertheless, Rita was determined not to succumb without a struggle. She  did not count herself untalented nor a girl to be lightly valued, and  Sir Lucien might prove to be less black than rumor had painted him. As  presently appeared, both in her judgment of herself and in that of Sir  Lucien, she was at least partially correct. He was very courteous, very  respectful, and highly attentive.    Her less favored companions smiled significantly when the familiar  Rolls-Royce appeared at the stage door night after night, never doubting  that Rita Dresden was chosen to \"star\" in the forthcoming production,  but, with rare exceptions, frankly envying her this good fortune.    Rita made no attempt to disillusion them, recognizing that it must fail.  She was resigned to being misjudged. If she could achieve success at  that price, success would have been purchased cheaply.    That Sir Lucien was deeply infatuated she was not slow to discover, and  with an address perfected by experience and a determination to avoid the  easy path inherited from a father whose scrupulous honesty had ruined  his professional prospects, she set to work to win esteem as well as  admiration.    Sir Lucien was first surprised, then piqued, and finally interested by  such unusual tactics. The second phase was the dangerous one for Rita,  and during a certain luncheon at Romanos her fate hung in the balance.  Sir Lucien realized that he was in peril of losing his head over this  tantalizingly pretty girl who gracefully kept him at a distance, fencing  with an adroitness which was baffling, and Sir Lucien Pyne had set out  with no intention of doing anything so preposterous as falling in love.  Keenly intuitive, Rita scented danger and made a bold move. Carelessly  rolling a bread-crumb along the cloth:    \"I am giving up the stage when the run finishes,\" she said.    \"Indeed,\" replied Sir Lucien imperturbably. \"Why?\"    \"I am tired of stage life. I have been invited to go and live with my  uncle in New York and have decided to accept. You see\"--she bestowed  upon him a swift glance of her brilliant eyes--\"men in the theatrical  world are not all like you. Real friends, I mean. It isn't very nice,  sometimes.\"    Sir Lucien deliberately lighted a cigarette. If Rita was bluffing, he  mused, she had the pluck to make good her bluff. And if she did so? He  dropped the extinguished match upon a plate. Did he care? He glanced at  the girl, who was smiling at an acquaintance on the other side of  the room. Fortune's wheel spins upon a needle point. By an artistic  performance occupying less than two minutes, but suggesting that Rita  possessed qualities which one day might spell success, she had decided  her fate. Her heart was beating like a hammer in her breast, but  she preserved an attitude of easy indifference. Without for a moment  believing in the American uncle, Sir Lucien did believe, correctly,  that Rita Dresden was about to elude him. He realized, too, that he  was infinitely more interested than he had ever been hitherto, and more  interested than he had intended to become.    This seemingly trivial conversation was a turning point, and twelve  months later Rita Dresden was playing the title role in The Maid of the  Masque. Sir Lucien had discovered himself to be really in love with  her, and he might quite possibly have offered her marriage even if a  dangerous rival had not appeared to goad him to that desperate leap--for  so he regarded it. Monte Irvin, although considerably Rita's senior,  had much to commend him in the eyes of the girl--and in the eyes of her  mother, who still retained a curious influence over her daughter. He  was much more wealthy than Pyne, and although the latter was a baronet,  Irvin was certain to be knighted ere long, so that Rita would secure the  appendage of \"Lady\" in either case. Also, his reputation promised a more  reliable husband than Sir Lucien could be expected to make. Moreover,  Rita liked him, whereas she had never sincerely liked and trusted Sir  Lucien. And there was a final reason--of which Mrs. Esden knew nothing.    On the first night that Rita had been entrusted with a part of any  consequence--and this was shortly after the conversation at Romanos--she  had discovered herself to be in a state of hopeless panic. All her  scheming and fencing would have availed her nothing if she were to break  down at the critical moment. It was an eventuality which Sir Lucien had  foreseen, and he seized the opportunity at once of securing a new hold  upon the girl and of rendering her more pliable than he had hitherto  found her to be. At this time the idea of marriage had not presented  itself to Sir Lucien.    Some hours before the performance he detected her condition of abject  fright... and from his waistcoat pocket he took a little gold snuff-box.    At first the girl declined to follow advice which instinctively she  distrusted, and Sir Lucien was too clever to urge it upon her. But he  glanced casually at his wrist-watch--and poor Rita shuddered. The gold  box was hidden again in the baronet's pocket.    To analyze the process which thereupon took place in Rita's mind would  be a barren task, since its result was a foregone conclusion. Daring  ambition rather than any merely abstract virtue was the keynote of  her character. She had rebuffed the advances of Sir Lucien as she had  rebuffed others, primarily because her aim in life was set higher than  mere success in light comedy. This she counted but a means to a more  desirable end--a wealthy marriage. To the achievement of such an  alliance the presence of an accepted lover would be an obstacle;  and true love Rita Dresden had never known. Yet, short of this final  sacrifice which some women so lightly made, there were few scruples  which she was not prepared to discard in furtherance of her designs. Her  morality, then, was diplomatic, for the vice of ambition may sometimes  make for virtue.    Rita's vivacious beauty and perfect self-possession on the fateful night  earned her a permanent place in stageland: Rita Dresden became a \"star.\"  She had won a long and hard-fought battle; but in avoiding one master  she had abandoned herself to another.    The triumph of her debut left her strangely exhausted. She dreaded  the coming of the second night almost as keenly as she had dreaded the  ordeal of the first. She struggled, poor victim, and only increased her  terrors. Not until the clock showed her that in twenty minutes she must  make her first entrance did she succumb. But Sir Lucien's gold snuff-box  lay upon her dressing-table--and she was trembling. When at last she  heard the sustained note of the oboe in the orchestra giving the pitch  to the answering violins, she raised the jewelled lid of the box.    So she entered upon the path which leads down to destruction, and  since to conjure with the drug which pharmacists know as methylbenzoyl  ecgonine is to raise the demon Insomnia, ere long she found herself  exploring strange by-paths in quest of sleep.    By the time that she was entrusted with the leading part in The Maid  of the Masque, she herself did not recognize how tenacious was the  hold which this fatal habit had secured upon her. In the company of Sir  Lucien Pyne she met other devotees, and for a time came to regard her  unnatural mode of existence as something inseparable from the Bohemian  life. To the horrible side of it she was blind.    It was her meeting with Monte Irvin during the run of this successful  play which first awakened a dawning comprehension; not because she  ascribed his admiration to her artificial vivacity, but because she  realized the strength of the link subsisting between herself and Sir  Lucien. She liked and respected Irvin, and as a result began to view her  conduct from a new standpoint. His life was so entirely open and free  from reproach while part of her own was dark and secret. She conceived a  desire to be done with that dark and secret life.    This was a shadow-land over which Sir Lucien Pyne presided, and which  must be kept hidden from Monte Irvin; and it was not until she"]]]
