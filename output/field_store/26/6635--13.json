Into the subject of means and methods it is not proposed to enter, nor  to attempt to answer such questions as to whether the light shall be  direct or projected; whether the spectator, wrapped in darkness, shall  watch the music unfold at the end of some mysterious vista, or  whether his whole organism shall be played upon by powerful waves  of multi-coloured light. These coupled alternatives are not mutually  exclusive, any more than the idea of an orchestra is exclusive of that  of a single human voice.    In imagining an art of mobile color unconditioned by considerations  of mechanical difficulty or of expense, ideas multiply in truly  bewildering profusion. Sunsets, solar coronas, star spectra, auroras  such as were never seen on sea or land; rainbows, bubbles, rippling  water; flaming volcanoes, lava streams of living light--these and a  hundred other enthralling and perfectly realizable effects suggest  themselves. What Israfil of the future will pour on mortals this new  \"music of the spheres\"?          LOUIS SULLIVAN    PROPHET OF DEMOCRACY      Due tribute has been paid to Mr. Louis Sullivan as an architect in  the first essay of this volume. That aspect of his genius has been  critically dealt with by many, but as an author he is scarcely  known. Yet there are Sibylline leaves of his, still let us hope in  circulation, which have wielded a potent influence on the minds of a  generation of men now passing to maturity. It is in the hope that his  message may not be lost to the youth of today and of tomorrow that the  present author now undertakes to summarize and interpret that message  to a public to which Mr. Sullivan is indeed a name, but not a voice.    That he is not a voice can be attributed neither to his lack of  eloquence--for he is eloquent--nor to the indifference of the younger  generation of architects which has grown up since he has ceased,  in any public way, to speak. It is due rather to a curious fatality  whereby his memorabilia have been confined to sheets which the  winds of time have scattered--pamphlets, ephemeral magazines, trade  journals--never the bound volume which alone guards the sacred flame  from the gusts of evil chance.    And Mr. Sullivan's is a \"sacred flame,\" because it was kindled solely  with the idea of service--a beacon to keep young men from  shipwreck traversing those straits made dangerous by the Scylla of  Conventionality, and the Charybdis of License. The labour his writing  cost him was enormous. \"I shall never again make so great a sacrifice  for the younger generation,\" he says in a letter, \"I am amazed to  note how insignificant, how almost nil is the effect produced, in  comparison to the cost, in vitality to me. Or perhaps it is I who  am in error. Perhaps one must have reached middle age, or the Indian  Summer of life, must have seen much, heard much, felt and produced  much and been much in solitude to receive in reading what I gave in  writing 'with hands overfull.'\"    This was written with reference to _Kindergarten Chats. A sketch  Analysis of Contemporaneous American Architecture_, which constitutes  Mr. Sullivan's most extended and characteristic preachment to the  young men of his day. It appeared in 1901, in fifty-two consecutive  numbers of _The Interstate Architect and Builder_, a magazine now  no longer published. In it the author, as mentor, leads an imaginary  disciple up and down the land, pointing out to him the \"bold,  upholsterrific blunders\" to be found in the architecture of the day,  and commenting on them in a caustic, colloquial style--large, loose,  discursive--a blend of Ruskin, Carlyle and Whitman, yet all Mr.  Sullivan's own. He descends, at times, almost to ribaldry, at others  he rises to poetic and prophetic heights. This is all a part of his  method alternately to shame and inspire his pupil to some sort of  creative activity. The syllabus of Mr. Sullivan's scheme, as it  existed in his mind during the writing of _Kindergarten Chats_,  and outlined by him in a letter to the author is such a torch of  illumination that it is quoted here entire.        A young man who has \"finished his education\" at the      architectural schools comes to me for a post-graduate      course--hence a free form of dialogue.        I proceed with his education rather by indirection and      suggestion than by direct precept. I subject him to certain      experiences and allow the impressions they make on him to      infiltrate, and, as I note the effect, I gradually use a      guiding hand. I supply the yeast, so to speak, and allow the      ferment to work in him.        This is the gist of the whole scheme. It remains then to      determine, carefully, the kind of experiences to which I shall      subject the lad, and in what order, or logical (and especially      psychological) sequence. I begin, then, with aspects that      are literal, objective, more or less cynical, and brutal, and      philistine. A little at a time I introduce the subjective,      the refined, the altruistic; and, by a to-and-fro increasingly      intense rhythm of these two opposing themes, worked so to      speak in counterpoint, I reach a preliminary climax: of      brutality tempered by a longing for nobler, purer things.        Hence arise a purblind revulsion and yearning in the lad's      soul; the psychological moment has arrived, and I take him      at once into the _country_--(Summer: The Storm). This is the      first of the four out-of-door scenes, and the lad's first      real experience with nature. It impresses him crudely but      violently; and in the tense excitement of the tempest he is      inspired to temporary eloquence; and at the close is much      softened. He feels in a way but does not know that he has been      a participant in one of Nature's superb dramas. (Thus do      I insidiously prepare the way for the notion that creative      architecture is in essence a dramatic art, and an art of      eloquence; of subtle rhythmic beauty, power, and tenderness).        Left alone in the country the lad becomes maudlin--a callow      lover of nature--and makes feeble attempts at verse. Returning      to the city he melts and unbosoms--the tender shaft of the      unknowable Eros has penetrated to his heart--Nature's subtle      spell is on him, to disappear and reappear. Then follow      discussions, more or less didactic, leading to the second      out-of-door scene (Autumn Glory). Here the lad does most of      the talking and shows a certain lucidity and calm of mind. The      discussion of Responsibility, Democracy, Education, etc., has      inevitably detached the lurking spirit of pessimism. It has      to be:--Into the depths and darkness we descend, and the      work reaches the tragic climax in the third out-of-door      scene--Winter.        Now that the forces have been gathered and marshalled the      true, sane movement of the work is entered upon and pushed      at high tension, and with swift, copious modulations to its      foreordained climax and optimistic peroration in the fourth      and last out-of-door scene as portrayed in the Spring Song.      The _locale_ of this closing number is the beautiful spot in      the woods, on the shore of Biloxi Bay:--where I am writing      this.        I would suggest in passing that a considerable part of the      K.C. is in rhythmic prose--some of it declamatory. I have      endeavoured throughout this work to represent, or reproduce      to the mind and heart of the reader the spoken word and      intonation--not written language. It really should be read      aloud, especially the descriptive and exalted passages.    There was a movement once on the part of Mr. Sullivan's admirers to  issue _Kindergarten Chats_ in book form, but he was asked to tone it  down and expurgate it, a thing which he very naturally refused to do.  Mr. Sullivan has always been completely alive to our cowardice when  it comes to hearing the truth about ourselves, and alive to the danger  which this cowardice entails, for to his imaginary pupil he says,        If you wish to read the current architecture of your country,      you must go at it courageously, and not pick out merely the      little bits that please you. I am going to soak you with it      until you are absolutely nauseated, and your faculties turn      in rebellion. I may be a hard taskmaster, but I strive to be      a good one. When I am through with you, you will know      architecture from the ground up. You will know its virtuous      reality and you will know the fake and the fraud and the      humbug. I will spare nothing--for your sake. I will stir up      the cesspool to its utmost depths of stench, and also the      pious, hypocritical virtues of our so-called architecture--the      nice, good, mealy-mouthed, suave, dexterous, diplomatic      architecture, I will show you also the kind of architecture      our \"cultured\" people believe in. And why do they believe in      it? Because they do not believe in themselves.    _Kindergarten Chats_ is even more pertinent and pointed today than it  was some twenty years ago, when it was written. Speech that is full of  truth is timeless, and therefore prophetic. Mr. Sullivan forecast some  of the very evils by which we have been overtaken. He was able to do  this on account of the fundamental soundness of his point of view,  which finds expression in the following words: \"Once you learn to look  upon architecture not merely as an art more or less well, or more or  less badly done, but as a _social manifestation_, the critical eye  becomes clairvoyant, and obscure, unnoted phenomena become illumined.\"    Looking, from this point of view, at the office"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12629"],[0,"Language: An Introduction to the Study of Speech (#14)"],[1,"of indifference whether I say _yesterday the man saw  the dog_ or _yesterday the dog saw the man_ or whether I say _he is  here_ or _is he here?_ In the one case, of the latter group of examples,  the vital distinction of subject and object depends entirely on the  placing of certain words of the sentence, in the latter a slight  difference of sequence makes all the difference between statement and  question. It goes without saying that in these cases the English  principle of word order is as potent a means of expression as is the  Latin use of case suffixes or of an interrogative particle. There is  here no question of functional poverty, but of formal economy.    We have already seen something of the process of composition, the  uniting into a single word of two or more radical elements.  Psychologically this process is closely allied to that of word order in  so far as the relation between the elements is implied, not explicitly  stated. It differs from the mere juxtaposition of words in the sentence  in that the compounded elements are felt as constituting but parts of a  single word-organism. Such languages as Chinese and English, in which  the principle of rigid sequence is well developed, tend not infrequently  also to the development of compound words. It is but a step from such a  Chinese word sequence as _jin tak_ \"man virtue,\" i.e., \"the virtue of  men,\" to such more conventionalized and psychologically unified  juxtapositions as _t'ien tsz_ \"heaven son,\" i.e., \"emperor,\" or _shui  fu_ \"water man,\" i.e., \"water carrier.\" In the latter case we may as  well frankly write _shui-fu_ as a single word, the meaning of the  compound as a whole being as divergent from the precise etymological  values of its component elements as is that of our English word  _typewriter_ from the merely combined values of _type_ and _writer_. In  English the unity of the word _typewriter_ is further safeguarded by a  predominant accent on the first syllable and by the possibility of  adding such a suffixed element as the plural _-s_ to the whole word.  Chinese also unifies its compounds by means of stress. However, then, in  its ultimate origins the process of composition may go back to typical  sequences of words in the sentence, it is now, for the most part, a  specialized method of expressing relations. French has as rigid a word  order as English but does not possess anything like its power of  compounding words into more complex units. On the other hand, classical  Greek, in spite of its relative freedom in the placing of words, has a  very considerable bent for the formation of compound terms.    It is curious to observe how greatly languages differ in their ability  to make use of the process of composition. One would have thought on  general principles that so simple a device as gives us our _typewriter_  and _blackbird_ and hosts of other words would be an all but universal  grammatical process. Such is not the case. There are a great many  languages, like Eskimo and Nootka and, aside from paltry exceptions, the  Semitic languages, that cannot compound radical elements. What is even  stranger is the fact that many of these languages are not in the least  averse to complex word-formations, but may on the contrary effect a  synthesis that far surpasses the utmost that Greek and Sanskrit are  capable of. Such a Nootka word, for instance, as \"when, as they say, he  had been absent for four days\" might be expected to embody at least  three radical elements corresponding to the concepts of \"absent,\"  \"four,\" and \"day.\" As a matter of fact the Nootka word is utterly  incapable of composition in our sense. It is invariably built up out of  a single radical element and a greater or less number of suffixed  elements, some of which may have as concrete a significance as the  radical element itself. In, the particular case we have cited the  radical element conveys the idea of \"four,\" the notions of \"day\" and  \"absent\" being expressed by suffixes that are as inseparable from the  radical nucleus of the word as is an English element like _-er_ from the  _sing_ or _hunt_ of such words as _singer_ and _hunter_. The tendency to  word synthesis is, then, by no means the same thing as the tendency to  compounding radical elements, though the latter is not infrequently a  ready means for the synthetic tendency to work with.    There is a bewildering variety of types of composition. These types  vary according to function, the nature of the compounded elements, and  order. In a great many languages composition is confined to what we may  call the delimiting function, that is, of the two or more compounded  elements one is given a more precisely qualified significance by the  others, which contribute nothing to the formal build of the sentence. In  English, for instance, such compounded elements as _red_ in _redcoat_ or  _over_ in _overlook_ merely modify the significance of the dominant  _coat_ or _look_ without in any way sharing, as such, in the predication  that is expressed by the sentence. Some languages, however, such as  Iroquois and Nahuatl,[28] employ the method of composition for much  heavier work than this. In Iroquois, for instance, the composition of a  noun, in its radical form, with a following verb is a typical method of  expressing case relations, particularly of the subject or object.  _I-meat-eat_ for instance, is the regular Iroquois method of expressing  the sentence _I am eating meat_. In other languages similar forms may  express local or instrumental or still other relations. Such English  forms as _killjoy_ and _marplot_ also illustrate the compounding of a  verb and a noun, but the resulting word has a strictly nominal, not a  verbal, function. We cannot say _he marplots_. Some languages allow the  composition of all or nearly all types of elements. Paiute, for  instance, may compound noun with noun, adjective with noun, verb with  noun to make a noun, noun with verb to make a verb, adverb with verb,  verb with verb. Yana, an Indian language of California, can freely  compound noun with noun and verb with noun, but not verb with verb.  On the other hand, Iroquois can compound only noun with verb, never  noun and noun as in English or verb and verb as in so many other  languages. Finally, each language has its characteristic types of order  of composition. In English the qualifying element regularly precedes; in  certain other languages it follows. Sometimes both types are used in the  same language, as in Yana, where \"beef\" is \"bitter-venison\" but  \"deer-liver\" is expressed by \"liver-deer.\" The compounded object of a  verb precedes the verbal element in Paiute, Nahuatl, and Iroquois,  follows it in Yana, Tsimshian,[29] and the Algonkin languages.    [Footnote 28: The language of the Aztecs, still spoken in large parts of  Mexico.]    [Footnote 29: Indian language of British Columbia closely related to the  Nass already cited.]    Of all grammatical processes affixing is incomparably the most  frequently employed. There are languages, like Chinese and Siamese, that  make no grammatical use of elements that do not at the same time possess  an independent value as radical elements, but such languages are  uncommon. Of the three types of affixing--the use of prefixes, suffixes,  and infixes--suffixing is much the commonest. Indeed, it is a fair guess  that suffixes do more of the formative work of language than all other  methods combined. It is worth noting that there are not a few affixing  languages that make absolutely no use of prefixed elements but possess a  complex apparatus of suffixes. Such are Turkish, Hottentot, Eskimo,  Nootka, and Yana. Some of these, like the three last mentioned, have  hundreds of suffixed elements, many of them of a concreteness of  significance that would demand expression in the vast majority of  languages by means of radical elements. The reverse case, the use of  prefixed elements to the complete exclusion of suffixes, is far less  common. A good example is Khmer (or Cambodgian), spoken in French  Cochin-China, though even here there are obscure traces of old suffixes  that have ceased to function as such and are now felt to form part of  the radical element.    A considerable majority of known languages are prefixing and suffixing  at one and the same time, but the relative importance of the two groups  of affixed elements naturally varies enormously. In some languages, such  as Latin and Russian, the suffixes alone relate the word to the rest of  the sentence, the prefixes being confined to the expression of such  ideas as delimit the concrete significance of the radical element  without influencing its bearing in the proposition. A Latin form like  _remittebantur_ \"they were being sent back\" may serve as an illustration  of this type of distribution of elements. The prefixed element _re-_  \"back\" merely qualifies to a certain extent the inherent significance of  the radical element _mitt-_ \"send,\" while the suffixes _-eba-_, _-nt-_,  and _-ur_ convey the less concrete, more strictly formal, notions of  time, person, plurality, and passivity.    On the other hand, there are languages, like the Bantu group of Africa  or the Athabaskan languages[30] of North America, in which the  grammatically significant elements precede, those that follow the  radical element forming a relatively dispensable class. The Hupa word  _te-s-e-ya-te_ \"I will go,\" for example, consists of a radical element  _-ya-_ \"to go,\" three essential prefixes and a formally subsidiary  suffix. The element _te-_ indicates that the act takes place here and  there in space or continuously over space; practically, it has no  clear-cut significance apart from such verb stems as it is customary to  connect it with. The second prefixed element, _-s-_, is even less easy  to define. All we can say is that it is used in verb forms of \"definite\"  time and that it marks action as in progress rather than as"]]]
