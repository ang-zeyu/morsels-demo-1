I silently supplemented her peroration by attributing her  garrulity to a more stimulating source.    When we started again, it was time to learn something about the scene of  our further proceedings, and the driver enunciated his views on monks in  general, _a propos_ to the Convent of Grace-Dieu, the Chartreuse at  which we were to leave our carriage, and obtain food for man and horse.  The Brothers, he said, were possessed of many mills, and were in  consequence enormously rich. Among the products of their industry, a  liqueur known as _Chartreuse_ seemed to fill a high place in his esteem,  for he considered it to be better--and he said it as if that  comparative led into an eighth heaven--better even than absinthe. I had  an opportunity of tasting this liqueur some weeks after, a few minutes  below the summit of Mont Blanc, and certainly no one would suspect its  great strength, which is entirely disguised by an innocent and insidious  sweetness, as unlike absinthe as anything can possibly be: impressions,  however, respecting meat and drink, and all other matters, are not very  trustworthy when received near the top of the Calotte. It has lately  been found that the worthy Brothers of the Grande Chartreuse have been  systematically defrauding the revenue, by returning their profits on the  manufacture of this liqueur at something merely nominal as compared with  the real gains. I could not learn whether the ceremony of blessing each  batch of the liqueur, before sending it out to intoxicate the world, is  performed with so much solemnity at Grace-Dieu as at Grenoble; and,  indeed, it rests only on the assertion of the short-tongued Bisuntian  that the manufacture is carried on at all at the former place.[35]    Having communicated such information as he possessed, the man seemed to  think he had a right to learn something in return, and administered  various questions respecting customs which he believed to prevail in  England. He evidently did not credit the denial of the truth of what he  had heard, nor yet the assertion, in answer to another question, that  English hothouse grapes are three or four times as large as the ordinary  grapes of France, and well-flavoured in at least a like proportion. The  roadside was planted with apple-trees, and these were overgrown with  mistletoe; so, by way of correcting his idea that the English are a sad  and gloomy people, I informed him of the use made of this parasite by  young people in the country at Christmas-time. Instead, however, of  being thereby impressed with our national liveliness, he looked with a  sort of supercilious contempt upon a people who could require the  intervention or sanction of anything external in such a matter, and  turned the conversation to some more worthy subject.    At length we passed into a pleasant valley, with thrushes singing, and  much chirping of those smaller birds, in the murder of which, sitting,  consists _le sport_ in the eyes of many gentlemen of France. Up to this  point, nothing could have been more unlike the scenery which I had so  far found to be associated with glacieres; but now the country became  slightly more Jurane, and limestone precipices on a small scale rose up  on either hand, decked with the corbel towers which result from the  weathering of the rock. It was the Jura in softer as well as smaller  type, for all the desolate wildness which characterises the more rocky  part of that range was gone, and there were no signs of the grand  pine-scenery, or needle-foliage, as the Germans call it; the trees were  all oak and ash and beech, and the rocks were much more neat and  orderly, and of course less grand, than their contorted kindred farther  south. The valley speedily became very narrow, and a final bend brought  us face-to-face with the buildings of the Abbaye de Grace-Dieu, striking  from their position--filling, as they do, the breadth of the  valley,--but in no way remarkable architecturally. The journey had been  so long that it was now ten o'clock; and as we were due in Besancon at  five in the evening, we put the horse up as quickly as possible, in a  shed provided by the Brothers, and set off on foot for the glaciere,  half an hour distant. About a mile and a half from the convent, the  valley comes to an end, the rocks on the opposite sides approaching so  close to each other as only to leave room for a large flour-mill,  belonging to the Brothers, and for the escape-channel of the stream  which works the mill. This building is quite new, and might almost be  taken for a fortification against inroads by the head of the valley,  especially as the words _Posuerunt me custodem_ appear on the face,  applying, however, to an image of the Virgin, which presides over the  establishment. The monks have expended their superfluous time and  energies upon the erection of crosses of all sizes on every projecting  peak and point of rock, one cross more sombre than the rest marking the  scene of a recent death. As I had no means of determining the elevation  of this district above the sea,[36] I made enquiries as to the climate  in winter; and one of the Brothers told me, that it was an unusual thing  with them to have a fall of snow amounting to two joints of a remarkably  dirty finger.    At the mill, the path turns up the steep wooded hill on the right, and  leads through young plantations to a small cottage near the glaciere,  where the plantations give place to a well-grown beech wood. Here my  conductor startled me by announcing that there was 20 centimes to pay  to the farmer of the cave for entrance; an announcement which seemed to  take all the pleasure out of the expedition, and invested it with the  disagreeable character of sightseeing. The poor driver thought, no  doubt, with some trepidation upon the small amount of _pour-boire_ he  could expect from a monsieur on whom a demand for two pence produced so  serious an effect, and it was difficult to make him understand that the  fact and not the amount of payment was the trouble. When I illustrated  this by saying that I would gladly give a franc to be allowed to enter  the glaciere free, he seemed to think that if I would entrust him with  the franc, he might possibly arrange that little matter for me.    The immediate approach to the glaciere is very impressive. The surface  of the ground slopes slightly upwards, and the entrance, from north to  south, is by a broad inclined plane, of gentle fall at first, which  rapidly becomes steep enough to require zigzags. The walls of rock on  either side are very sheer, and increase of course in height as the  plane of entrance falls. The whole length of the slope is about 420  feet, and down a considerable part of this some grasses and flowers are  to be found: the last 208 feet are covered more or less with ice;  though, at the time of my visit, the furious rains of the end of June,  1864, had washed down a considerable amount of mud, and so covered some  of the ice. There were no ready means of determining the thickness of  this layer of ice, for the descent of which ten or eleven zigzags had  been made by the farmer. In one place, within 24 feet of its upper  commencement, it was from 2-1/2 to 3 feet thick; but the prominence of  that part seemed to mark it out as of more than the average thickness.  Even where to all appearance there was nothing but mud and earth, an  unexpected fall or two showed that all was ice below. Whether the driver  had previously experienced the treacherousness of this slope of ice,  or whatever his motive might be, he left me to enter and explore alone.    The roof of the entrance is at first a mere shell, formed by the thin  crust of rock on which the surface-earth and trees rest high overhead;  but this rapidly becomes thicker, as shown in the section of the cave,  and thus a sort of outer cave is formed, the real portal of the glaciere  being reached about 60 feet above the bottom of the slope. This outer  cave presents a curious appearance, from the distinctness with which the  several strata of the limestone are marked, the lower strata weathered  and rounded off like the seats of an amphitheatre of the giants, and  all, up to the shell-like roof, arranged in horizontal semicircles of  various graduated sizes, showing their concavity; while at the bottom of  the whole is seen a patch of darkness, with two masses of ice in its  centre, looming out like grey ghosts at midnight. This darkness is of  course the inner cave, the entrance to which, though it seems so small  from above, is 78 feet broad.    The glaciere itself may be said to commence as soon as this entrance,  or perpendicular portal, is passed, and thus includes 60 feet of the  long slope of ice, from the foot of which to the farther end of the  cave is 145 feet, the greatest breadth of the cave being 148 feet.  Immediately below the portal I found a piece of the trunk of a large  column of ice, 7 feet long and 12 feet in girth, its fractured ends  giving the idea of the interior of a quickly-grown tree, in  consequence of the concentric arrangement of convergent prisms  described in the account of the Glaciere of S. Georges. The wife of  the farmer told me afterwards that there had been two glorious  columns at this portal, which the recent rains had swept away.  Excepting a short space at the foot of the slope, and another towards  the farther end of the cave, the floor was covered with ice, in some  parts from 3 to 4 feet thick: of this a considerable area had been  removed to a depth of 2 1/2 or 3 feet, leaving a pond of water a foot  deep, with bottom and banks of ice. The rock which composes the true  floor rises at the farthest end of the cave, and the roof is so  arranged that a sort of private chapel is there formed; and from a  fissure in the dome a monster column of ice had been constructed on  the floor, which, at the time of my visit, had lost its upper parts,  and stood as a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14020"],[0,"The Works of Horace (#14)"],[1,"  He would not, by being shut up in a [wooden] horse, that belied the  sacred rights of Minerva, have surprised the Trojans reveling in an evil  hour, and the court of Priam making merry in the dance; but openly  inexorable to his captives, (oh impious! oh!) would have burned  speechless babes with Grecian fires, even him concealed in his mother's  womb: had not the father of the gods, prevailed upon by thy entreaties  and those of the beauteous Venus, granted to the affairs of Aeneas walls  founded under happier auspices. Thou lyrist Phoebus, tutor of the  harmonious Thalia, who bathest thy locks in the river Xanthus, O  delicate Agyieus, support the dignity of the Latian muse. Phoebus gave  me genius, Phoebus the art of composing verse, and the title of poet. Ye  virgins of the first distinction, and ye youths born of illustrious  parents, ye wards of the Delian goddess, who stops with her bow the  flying lynxes, and the stags, observe the Lesbian measure, and the  motion of my thumb; duly celebrating the son of Latona, duly  [celebrating] the goddess that enlightens the night with her shining  crescent, propitious to the fruits, and expeditious in rolling on the  precipitate months. Shortly a bride you will say: \"I, skilled in the  measures of the poet Horace, recited an ode which was acceptable to the  gods, when the secular period brought back the festal days.\"           *       *       *       *       *        ODE VII.    TO TORQUATUS.      The snows are fled, the herbage now returns to the fields, and the  leaves to the trees. The earth changes its appearance, and the  decreasing rivers glide along their banks: the elder Grace, together  with the Nymphs, and her two sisters, ventures naked to lead off the  dance. That you are not to expect things permanent, the year, and the  hour that hurries away the agreeable day, admonish us. The colds are  mitigated by the zephyrs: the summer follows close upon the spring,  shortly to die itself, as soon as fruitful autumn shall have shed its  fruits: and anon sluggish winter returns again. Nevertheless the  quick-revolving moons repair their wanings in the skies; but when we  descend [to those regions] where pious Aeneas, where Tullus and the  wealthy Ancus [have gone before us], we become dust and a mere shade.  Who knows whether the gods above will add to this day's reckoning the  space of to-morrow? Every thing, which you shall indulge to your beloved  soul, will escape the greedy hands of your heir. When once, Torquatus,  you shall be dead, and Minos shall have made his awful decisions  concerning you; not your family, not you eloquence, not your piety shall  restore you. For neither can Diana free the chaste Hippolytus from  infernal darkness; nor is Theseus able to break off the Lethaean fetters  from his dear Piri thous.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE VIII.    TO MARCIUS CENSORINUS.      O Censorinus, liberally would I present my acquaintance with goblets and  beautiful vases of brass; I would present them with tripods, the rewards  of the brave Grecians: nor would you bear off the meanest of my  donations, if I were rich in those pieces of art, which either  Parrhasius or Scopas produced; the latter in statuary, the former in  liquid colors, eminent to portray at one time a man, at another a god.  But I have no store of this sort, nor do your circumstances or  inclination require any such curiosities as these. You delight in  verses: verses I can give, and set a value on the donation. Not marbles  engraved with public inscriptions, by means of which breath and life  returns to illustrious generals after their decease; not the precipitate  flight of Hannibal, and his menaces retorted upon his own head: not the  flames of impious Carthage * * * * more eminently set forth his praises,  who returned, having gained a name from conquered Africa, than the  Calabrlan muses; neither, should writings be silent, would you have any  reward for having done well. What would the son of Mars and Ilia be, if  invidious silence had stifled the merits of Romulus? The force, and  favor, and voice of powerful poets consecrate Aecus, snatched from the  Stygian floods, to the Fortunate Islands. The muse forbids a  praiseworthy man to die: the muse, confers the happiness of heaven. Thus  laborious Hercules has a place at the longed-for banquets of Jove:  [thus] the sons of Tyndarus, that bright constellation, rescue shattered  vessels from the bosom of the deep: [and thus] Bacchus, his temples  adorned with the verdant vine-branch, brings the prayers of his votaries  to successful issues.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE IX.    TO MARCUS LOLLIUS.      Lest you for a moment imagine that those words will be lost, which I,  born on the far-resounding Aufidus, utter to be accompanied with the  lyre, by arts hitherto undivulged--If Maeonian Homer possesses the first  rank, the Pindaric and Cean muses, and the menacing strains of Alcaeus,  and the majestic ones of Stesichorus, are by no means obscure: neither,  if Anacreon long ago sportfully sung any thing, has time destroyed it:  even now breathes the love and live the ardors of the Aeolian maid,  committed to her lyre. The Lacedaemonian Helen is not the only fair, who  has been inflamed by admiring the delicate ringlets of a gallant, and  garments embroidered with gold, and courtly accomplishments, and  retinue: nor was Teucer the first that leveled arrows from the Cydonian  bow: Troy was more than once harassed: the great Idomeneus and Sthenelus  were not the only heroes that fought battles worthy to be recorded by  the muses: the fierce Hector, or the strenuous Deiphobus were not the  first that received heavy blows in defense of virtuous wives and  children. Many brave men lived before Agamemnon: but all of them,  unlamented and unknown, are overwhelmed with endless obscurity, because  they were destitute of a sacred bard. Valor, uncelebrated, differs but  little from cowardice when in the grave. I will not [therefore], O  Lollius, pass you over in silence, uncelebrated in my writings, or  suffer envious forgetfulness with impunity to seize so many toils of  thine. You have a mind ever prudent in the conduct of affairs, and  steady alike amid success and trouble: you are an avenger of avaricious  fraud, and proof against money, that attracts every thing; and a consul  not of one year only, but as often as the good and upright magistrate  has preferred the honorable to the profitable, and has rejected with a  disdainful brow the bribes of wicked men, and triumphant through  opposing bands has displayed his arms. You can not with propriety call  him happy, that possesses much; he more justly claims the title of  happy, who understands how to make a wise use of the gifts of the gods,  and how to bear severe poverty; and dreads a reproachful deed worse than  death; such a man as this is not afraid to perish in the defense of his  dear friends, or of his country.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE X.    TO LIGURINUS.      O cruel still, and potent in the endowments of beauty, when an  unexpected plume shall come upon your vanity, and those locks, which now  wanton on your shoulders, shall fall off, and that color, which is now  preferable to the blossom of the damask rose, changed, O Ligurinus,  shall turn into a wrinkled face; [then] will you say (as often as you  see yourself, [quite] another person in the looking glass), Alas! why  was not my present inclination the same, when I was young? Or why do not  my cheeks return, unimpaired, to these my present sentiments?           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XI.    TO PHYLLIS.      Phyllis, I have a cask full of Abanian wine, upward of nine years old; I  have parsley in my garden, for the weaving of chaplets, I have a store  of ivy, with which, when you have bound your hair, you look so gay: the  house shines cheerfully With plate: the altar, bound with chaste  vervain, longs to be sprinkled [with the blood] of a sacrificed lamb:  all hands are busy: girls mingled with boys fly about from place to  place: the flames quiver, rolling on their summit the sooty smoke. But  yet, that you may know to what joys you are invited, the Ides are to be  celebrated by you, the day which divides April, the month of sea-born  Venus; [a day,] with reason to be solemnized by me, and almost more  sacred to me than that of my own birth; since from this day my dear  Maecenas reckons his flowing years. A rich and buxom girl hath possessed  herself of Telephus, a youth above your rank; and she holds him fast by  an agreeable fetter. Consumed Phaeton strikes terror into ambitious  hopes, and the winged Pegasus, not stomaching the earth-born rider  Bellerophon, affords a terrible example, that you ought always to pursue  things that are suitable to you, and that you should avoid a  disproportioned match, by thinking it a crime to entertain a hope beyond  what is allowable. Come then, thou last of my loves (for hereafter I  shall burn for no other woman), learn with me such measures, as thou  mayest recite with thy lovely voice: our gloomy cares shall be mitigated  with an ode.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XII.    TO VIRGIL.      The Thracian breezes, attendants on the spring, which moderate the deep,  now fill the sails; now neither are the meadows stiff [with frost], nor  roar the rivers swollen with winter's snow. The unhappy bird, that  piteotisly bemoans Itys, and is the eternal disgrace of the house of  Cecrops (because she wickedly revenged the brutal lusts of kings), now  builds her nest. The keepers of the sheep play tunes upon the pipe amid  the tendar herbage, and delight that god, whom flocks and the shady  hills of Arcadia delight. The time of year, O Virgil, has brought on a  drought: but if you desire to quaff wine from the Calenian press, you,  that are a constant companion of young"]]]
