Third. The Indian Councils Act of 1892 forbids--and  this is no doubt a most important prohibition--either resolutions  or divisions of the Council in financial discussions. We shall ask  Parliament to repeal this prohibition. Fourth. We shall propose to  invest legislative Councils with power to discuss matters of public  and general importance, and to pass recommendations or resolutions  to the Indian Government. That Government will deal with them as  carefully, or as carelessly, as they think fit--just as a Government  does here. Fifth. To extend the power that at present exists, to  appoint a Member of the Council to preside. Sixth. Bombay and  Madras have now Executive Councils, numbering two. I propose to ask  Parliament to double the number of ordinary members. Seventh.  The Lieutenant-Governors have no Executive Council. We shall ask  Parliament to sanction the creation of such Councils, consisting of  not more than two ordinary members, and to define the power of the  Lieutenant-Governor to overrule his Council. I am perfectly sure there  may be differences of opinion as to these proposals. I only want your  Lordships to believe that they have been well thought out, and that  they are accepted by the Governor-General in Council.    There is one point of extreme importance which, no doubt, though it  may not be over diplomatic for me to say so at this stage, will create  some controversy. I mean the matter of the official majority. The  House knows what an official majority is. It is a device by which the  Governor-General, or the Governor of Bombay or Madras, may secure  a majority in his Legislative Council by means of officials and  nominees. And the officials, of course, for very good reasons, just  like a Cabinet Minister or an Under-Secretary, whatever the man's  private opinion may be, would still vote, for the best of reasons,  and I am bound to think with perfect wisdom, with the Government.  But anybody can see how directly, how palpably, how injuriously, an  arrangement of this kind tends to weaken, and I think I may say  even to deaden, the sense both of trust and responsibility in the  non-official members of these councils. Anybody can see how the system  tends to throw the non-official member into an attitude of peevish,  sulky, permanent opposition, and, therefore, has an injurious effect  on the minds and characters of members of these Legislative Councils.    I know it will be said--I will not weary the House by arguing it, but  I only desire to meet at once the objection that will be taken--that  these councils will, if you take away the safeguard of the official  majority, pass any number of wild-cat Bills. The answer to that is  that the head of the Government can veto the wild-cat Bills. The  Governor-General can withhold his assent, and the withholding of the  assent of the Governor-General is no defunct power. Only the other  day, since I have been at the India Office, the Governor-General  disallowed a Bill passed by a Local Government which I need not name,  with the most advantageous effect. I am quite convinced that if that  Local Government had had an unofficial majority the Bill would never  have been passed, and the Governor-General would not have had to  refuse his assent. But so he did, and so he would if these gentlemen,  whose numbers we propose to increase and whose powers we propose to  widen, chose to pass wild-cat Bills. And it must be remembered that  the range of subjects within the sphere of Provincial Legislative  Councils is rigorously limited by statutory exclusions. I will not  labour the point now. Anybody who cares, in a short compass, can grasp  the argument, of which we shall hear a great deal, in Paragraphs 17  to 20 of my reply to the Government of India, in the Papers that will  speedily be in your Lordships' hands.    There is one proviso in this matter of the official majority, in which  your Lordships may, perhaps, find a surprise. We are not prepared to  divest the Governor-General in his Council of an official majority.  In the Provincial Councils we propose to dispense with it, but in the  Viceroy's Legislative Council we propose to adhere to it. Only let  me say that here we may seem to lag a stage behind the Government of  India themselves--so little violent are we--because that Government  say, in their despatch--\"On all ordinary occasions we are ready  to dispense with an official majority in the Imperial Legislative  Council, and to rely on the public spirit of non-official members to  enable us to carry on the ordinary work of legislation.\" My Lords,  that is what we propose to do in the Provincial Councils. But in the  Imperial Council we consider an official majority essential. It may be  said that this is a most flagrant logical inconsistency. So it would  be, on one condition. If I were attempting to set up a Parliamentary  system in India, or if it could be said that this chapter of reforms  led directly or necessarily up to the establishment of a Parliamentary  system in India, I, for one, would have nothing at all to do with it.  I do not believe--it is not of very great consequence what I believe,  because the fulfilment of my vaticinations could not come off very  soon--in spite of the attempts in Oriental countries at this moment,  interesting attempts to which we all wish well, to set up some sort  of Parliamentary system--it is no ambition of mine, at all events, to  have any share in beginning that operation in India. If my existence,  either officially or corporeally, were prolonged twenty times longer  than either of them is likely to be, a Parliamentary system in India  is not at all the goal to which I would for one moment aspire.    One point more. It is the question of an Indian member on the  Viceroy's Executive Council. The absence of an Indian member from the  Viceroy's Executive Council can no longer, I think, be defended. There  is no legal obstacle or statutory exclusion. The Secretary of State  can, to-morrow, if he likes, if there be a vacancy on the Viceroy's  Council, recommend His Majesty to appoint an Indian member. All I want  to say is that, if, during my tenure of office, there should be a  vacancy on the Viceroy's Executive Council, I should feel it a duty  to tender my advice to the King that an Indian member should be  appointed. If it were on my own authority only, I might hesitate to  take that step, because I am not very fond of innovations in dark and  obscure ground, but here I have the absolute and the zealous approval  and concurrence of Lord Minto himself. It was at Lord Minto's special  instigation that I began to think seriously of this step. Anyhow, this  is how it stands, that you have at this moment a Secretary of State  and a Viceroy who both concur in such a recommendation. I suppose--if  I may be allowed to give a personal turn to these matters--that Lord  Minto and I have had as different experience of life and the world as  possible, and we belong I daresay to different schools of national  politics, because Lord Minto was appointed by the party opposite. It  is a rather remarkable thing that two men, differing in this way in  political antecedents, should agree in this proposal. We need not  discuss what particular portfolio should be assigned to an Indian  member. That will be settled by the Viceroy on the merits of the  individual. The great object, the main object, is that the merits of  individuals are to be considered and to be decisive, irrespective and  independent of race and colour.    We are not altogether without experience, because a year ago, or  somewhat more, it was my good fortune to be able to appoint two Indian  gentlemen to the Council of India sitting at the Indian Office. Many  apprehensions reached me as to what might happen. So far, at all  events, those apprehensions have been utterly dissipated. The concord  between the two Indian members of the Council and their colleagues has  been unbroken, their work has been excellent, and you will readily  believe me when I say that the advantage to me of being able to ask  one of these two gentlemen to come and tell me something about an  Indian question from an Indian point of view, is enormous. I find  in it a chance of getting the Indian angle of vision, and I feel  sometimes as if I were actually in the streets of Calcutta.    I do not say there are not some arguments on the other side. But this,  at all events, must be common sense--for the Governor-General and the  European members of his Council to have at their side a man who knows  the country well, who belongs to the country and who can give him the  point of view of an Indian. Surely, my Lords, that cannot but prove an  enormous advantage.    Let me say further, on the Judicial Bench in India everybody  recognises the enormous service that it is to have Indian members of  abundant learning, and who add to that abundant learning a complete  knowledge of the conditions and life of the country. I propose at  once, if Parliament agrees, to acquire powers to double the Executive  Council in Bombay and Madras, and to appoint at least one Indian  member in each of those cases, as well as in the Governor-General's  Council. Nor, as the Papers will show, shall I be backward in  advancing towards a similar step, as occasion may require, in respect  of at least four of the major provinces.    I wish that this chapter had been opened at a more fortunate moment:  but as I said when I rose, I repeat--do not let us for a moment take  too gloomy a view. There is not the slightest occasion. None of those  who are responsible take gloomy views.

He then called a coach, declaring he could  not walk the streets of London in safety.    Those who know what mischief has arisen from very trifling causes,  will, of course, perceive the necessity of checking this growing evil;  for this man went away with very unfavourable impressions concerning  our country, and would, no doubt, prejudice many against us, and make  them suppose we are worse than we are.    Nearly allied to this is, \"Pray remember poor Guy Faux;\" which not  only teaches children the art of begging, but is frequently the means  of their becoming dishonest, for I have known children break down  fences, and water-spouts, and, in short, any thing that they could lay  their hands upon, in order to make a bonfire, to the great danger of  the inhabitants near it, without producing one good effect. Yet how  easily might this practice be put down. The ill effects of it are so  self-evident, that there can be no need for further enlargement.    I also disapprove of children going about begging at Christmas; this  practice is calculated to instil into the children's minds a principle  of meanness not becoming the English character, and the money they  get, seldom, if ever, does them any good. If persons choose to give  children any thing at this time of the year, there can be no objection  to it, but I dislike children going about to ask for money like common  beggars; it cannot be proper, and should be generally discountenanced.  All these things, to some men, may appear trifling, but to me and  others they are of consequence; for if we mean to improve the general  character of the labouring population, there is nothing like beginning  in time; and we should, amongst other things, get rid of all mean and  improper customs.    Before concluding this chapter I would hint to travellers not to give  children money for running after a coach. I have seen children of both  sexes run until their breath failed, and, completely exhausted, drop  down on the grass; merely because some injudicious persons had thrown  halfpence to them. I have also seen little boys turn over and over  before the horses, for the purpose of getting money, to the danger of  their own lives and of the passengers; and I recollect an instance of  one boy being, in consequence, killed on the spot. In some counties  children will, in spring and summer, run after a carriage with flowers  upon a long stick, thrusting it in the coach or the faces of the  travellers, begging halfpence, which habit had been taught them by the  same injudicious means.    The most virtuous and pious of men, on looking back to their early  lives, have almost invariably confessed that they owe the first  seeds of what is excellent in them, to the blessing of God, on the  instruction and example of their parents, and those around them in the  years of their childhood.    Reflections like these ought to make us humble and thankful for the  advantages we have enjoyed, and cause us to look with an eye of pity,  charity, and commiseration on the vices and delinquencies of the poor,  rather than to judge them with harsh and cruel severity. Had we been  in their places, might not--would not--our character and conduct have  been as theirs?--Still further, ought not such thoughts as these to  touch our hearts with deep compassion for them, and excite us to  strenuous endeavours to remedy these lamentable evils, by the most  powerful and effective measures that can be found; and more especially  to strive if possible to rescue the rising generation from the  contamination of surrounding vice and misery.

Wholesome laws and good sermons are but slow and late ways;  the timely and most compendious way is a good education.\"--_Archbishop  Tillotson_.           *       *       *       *       *      Having brought the prevalency of juvenile delinquency immediately  before the eyes of my readers, by various examples in the second  chapter, and in the third exhibited a few of the causes of it, I shall  now proceed to point out what, in my humble opinion appears to be the  only efficient remedy, namely, the education of the infant poor.  It may not be amiss, however, to glance at the means which have  heretofore been employed, and found, though productive of some good,  inefficient for the end proposed.    As preventives, I may notice the numerous national and Sunday schools,  tract societies, &c., established throughout the kingdom. These have  doubtless much good effect, and deserve the zealous support of every  one who has at heart the welfare of society in general, and the  improvement of the labouring classes in particular. Many have been  plucked, \"as brands from the burning,\" by these institutions; which  are a blessing to the objects of their benevolence, and an honour to  their conductors and supporters. That Sunday schools are not wholly  efficient, in conjunction with other institutions, to accomplish  the end desired, is to be attributed, on the one hand, to the small  portion of time in which their salutary influence is exerted; and, on  the other, to their not admitting children at a sufficiently early  age. At the period usually assigned for their entrance, they have not  only acquired many evil habits, but their affections have become  so thoroughly perverted, as to offer great, and, in some cases,  insuperable obstacles to the corrective efforts of their teachers.  Each child brings into the school some portion of acquired evil,  making, when united, a formidable aggregate, and affording every  facility for mutual contamination. Add to this, the counteracting  effect which the bad examples they meet with in the course of six days  must have upon the good they hear on the seventh, and it will be seen  how little comparatively is really practicable. I do not say this to  dishearten those who are engaged in this labour of love, or to abate  the zeal of its promoters. At the same time that their experience  confirms the truth of my observations--and I know they would candidly  confess that it does so--they must have many gratifying instances of a  contrary nature, in children, who from evil habits have been won to  a love of goodness and religion, shewn not merely in a punctual  attendance at their school, but in that good-will toward their  fellow-scholars, and grateful love to their teachers, which are the  only infallible signs of a change in the affections. These things  encourage them, in spite of many difficulties and mortifications, to  persevere in well doing; and may the God of love bless their labours  with an increase of fruitfulness! It is only my purpose here to state,  that the most likely human means to produce such an increase, is the  establishment of infant schools;--schools designed, particularly, for  the cultivation of the affections,--for preparing the heart to receive  that wisdom which teaches us to love God supremely, and to love our  neighbour as ourselves. As to the system of instruction pursued in  Sunday schools, as well as other free schools, it is, indeed, my  opinion, that some alteration for the better might be made, but as I  intend to speak of this matter in a future place, I shall say no  more on the subject at present, but pass on to notice prison  discipline--which is, I fear, entitled to any term but that of a  _remedy_.    That the end of punishment should be the prevention of future crime,  rather than the gratification of vindictive feelings--whether those of  states or of injured individuals--but few will venture to deny; and  yet how little calculated is the punishment usually inflicted on young  offenders in this country, to answer that end! They are shut up in  a prison, in company with other thieves, perhaps older and more  experienced than themselves, and all that was wanting to complete  their education in dishonesty is here attained. Previously to their  confinement within the walls of one of these places, in spite of the  assertions of their hardened associates, that it was nothing to fear,  it is probable, dread or apprehension hung over their minds; the last  vestige of shame had not been banished by a public appearance as  criminals--and this, properly taken advantage of, might have made  their reformation possible! But, having encountered the object of  their fears, and endured the shame of a trial--shame and fear are  alike gone for ever; and when once they find their way into those  sinks of iniquity, there is very little hope of amendment. From that  period a prison has not the least terror for them. Being a place of  idleness while there, it calls forth the evil inclinations of  its inmates, and as they have opportunities of indulging those  inclinations, it not only loses all its utility, but becomes  incalculably injurious. I heard a boy who had been confined in Newgate  say, that he did not care any thing about it; that his"]]]
