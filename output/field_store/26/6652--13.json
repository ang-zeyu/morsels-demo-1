[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/130"],[0,"Orthodoxy (#14)"],[1," was the reverse of the fierce and pious  care which I felt touching the pricelessness and the peril of life.  They showed only a dreary waste; but I felt a sort of sacred thrift.  For economy is far more romantic than extravagance.  To them stars  were an unending income of halfpence; but I felt about the golden sun  and the silver moon as a schoolboy feels if he has one sovereign and  one shilling.         These subconscious convictions are best hit off by the colour  and tone of certain tales.  Thus I have said that stories of magic  alone can express my sense that life is not only a pleasure but a  kind of eccentric privilege.  I may express this other feeling of  cosmic cosiness by allusion to another book always read in boyhood,  \"Robinson Crusoe,\" which I read about this time, and which owes  its eternal vivacity to the fact that it celebrates the poetry  of limits, nay, even the wild romance of prudence.  Crusoe is a man  on a small rock with a few comforts just snatched from the sea:  the best thing in the book is simply the list of things saved from  the wreck.  The greatest of poems is an inventory.  Every kitchen  tool becomes ideal because Crusoe might have dropped it in the sea.  It is a good exercise, in empty or ugly hours of the day,  to look at anything, the coal-scuttle or the book-case, and think  how happy one could be to have brought it out of the sinking ship  on to the solitary island.  But it is a better exercise still  to remember how all things have had this hair-breadth escape:  everything has been saved from a wreck.  Every man has had one  horrible adventure:  as a hidden untimely birth he had not been,  as infants that never see the light.  Men spoke much in my boyhood  of restricted or ruined men of genius:  and it was common to say  that many a man was a Great Might-Have-Been. To me it is a more  solid and startling fact that any man in the street is a Great  Might-Not-Have-Been.         But I really felt (the fancy may seem foolish) as if all the order  and number of things were the romantic remnant of Crusoe's ship.  That there are two sexes and one sun, was like the fact that there  were two guns and one axe.  It was poignantly urgent that none should  be lost; but somehow, it was rather fun that none could be added.  The trees and the planets seemed like things saved from the wreck:  and when I saw the Matterhorn I was glad that it had not been overlooked  in the confusion.  I felt economical about the stars as if they were  sapphires (they are called so in Milton's Eden): I hoarded the hills.  For the universe is a single jewel, and while it is a natural cant  to talk of a jewel as peerless and priceless, of this jewel it is  literally true.  This cosmos is indeed without peer and without price:  for there cannot be another one.         Thus ends, in unavoidable inadequacy, the attempt to utter the  unutterable things.  These are my ultimate attitudes towards life;  the soils for the seeds of doctrine.  These in some dark way I  thought before I could write, and felt before I could think:  that we may proceed more easily afterwards, I will roughly recapitulate  them now.  I felt in my bones; first, that this world does not  explain itself.  It may be a miracle with a supernatural explanation;  it may be a conjuring trick, with a natural explanation.  But the explanation of the conjuring trick, if it is to satisfy me,  will have to be better than the natural explanations I have heard.  The thing is magic, true or false.  Second, I came to feel as if magic  must have a meaning, and meaning must have some one to mean it.  There was something personal in the world, as in a work of art;  whatever it meant it meant violently.  Third, I thought this  purpose beautiful in its old design, in spite of its defects,  such as dragons.  Fourth, that the proper form of thanks to it  is some form of humility and restraint:  we should thank God  for beer and Burgundy by not drinking too much of them.  We owed,  also, an obedience to whatever made us.  And last, and strangest,  there had come into my mind a vague and vast impression that in some  way all good was a remnant to be stored and held sacred out of some  primordial ruin.  Man had saved his good as Crusoe saved his goods:  he had saved them from a wreck.  All this I felt and the age gave me  no encouragement to feel it.  And all this time I had not even thought  of Christian theology.        V THE FLAG OF THE WORLD           When I was a boy there were two curious men running about  who were called the optimist and the pessimist.  I constantly used  the words myself, but I cheerfully confess that I never had any  very special idea of what they meant.  The only thing which might  be considered evident was that they could not mean what they said;  for the ordinary verbal explanation was that the optimist thought  this world as good as it could be, while the pessimist thought  it as bad as it could be.  Both these statements being obviously  raving nonsense, one had to cast about for other explanations.  An optimist could not mean a man who thought everything right and  nothing wrong.  For that is meaningless; it is like calling everything  right and nothing left.  Upon the whole, I came to the conclusion  that the optimist thought everything good except the pessimist,  and that the pessimist thought everything bad, except himself.  It would be unfair to omit altogether from the list the mysterious  but suggestive definition said to have been given by a little girl,  \"An optimist is a man who looks after your eyes, and a pessimist  is a man who looks after your feet.\"  I am not sure that this is not  the best definition of all.  There is even a sort of allegorical truth  in it.  For there might, perhaps, be a profitable distinction drawn  between that more dreary thinker who thinks merely of our contact  with the earth from moment to moment, and that happier thinker  who considers rather our primary power of vision and of choice  of road.         But this is a deep mistake in this alternative of the optimist  and the pessimist.  The assumption of it is that a man criticises  this world as if he were house-hunting, as if he were being shown  over a new suite of apartments.  If a man came to this world from  some other world in full possession of his powers he might discuss  whether the advantage of midsummer woods made up for the disadvantage  of mad dogs, just as a man looking for lodgings might balance  the presence of a telephone against the absence of a sea view.  But no man is in that position.  A man belongs to this world before  he begins to ask if it is nice to belong to it.  He has fought for  the flag, and often won heroic victories for the flag long before he  has ever enlisted.  To put shortly what seems the essential matter,  he has a loyalty long before he has any admiration.         In the last chapter it has been said that the primary feeling  that this world is strange and yet attractive is best expressed  in fairy tales.  The reader may, if he likes, put down the next  stage to that bellicose and even jingo literature which commonly  comes next in the history of a boy.  We all owe much sound morality  to the penny dreadfuls.  Whatever the reason, it seemed and still  seems to me that our attitude towards life can be better expressed  in terms of a kind of military loyalty than in terms of criticism  and approval.  My acceptance of the universe is not optimism,  it is more like patriotism.  It is a matter of primary loyalty.  The world is not a lodging-house at Brighton, which we are to  leave because it is miserable.  It is the fortress of our family,  with the flag flying on the turret, and the more miserable it  is the less we should leave it.  The point is not that this world  is too sad to love or too glad not to love; the point is that  when you do love a thing, its gladness is a reason for loving it,  and its sadness a reason for loving it more.  All optimistic thoughts  about England and all pessimistic thoughts about her are alike  reasons for the English patriot.  Similarly, optimism and pessimism  are alike arguments for the cosmic patriot.         Let us suppose we are confronted with a desperate thing--say  Pimlico.  If we think what is really best for Pimlico we shall find  the thread of thought leads to the throne or the mystic and the  arbitrary.  It is not enough for a man to disapprove of Pimlico: in  that case he will merely cut his throat or move to Chelsea. Nor,  certainly, is it enough for a man to approve of Pimlico: for then  it will remain Pimlico, which would be awful. The only way out of  it seems to be for somebody to love Pimlico: to love it with a  transcendental tie and without any earthly reason. If there arose a  man who loved Pimlico, then Pimlico would rise into ivory towers and  golden pinnacles; Pimlico would attire herself as a woman does when  she is loved.  For decoration is not given to hide horrible things:  but to decorate things already adorable. A mother does not give her  child a blue bow because he is so ugly without it.  A lover does not  give a girl a necklace to hide her neck. If men loved Pimlico as  mothers love children, arbitrarily, because it is THEIRS, Pimlico in a  year or two might be fairer than Florence. Some readers will say that  this is a mere fantasy.  I answer that this is the actual history of  mankind.  This, as a fact, is how cities did grow great.  Go back to  the darkest roots of civilization and you will find them knotted round  some sacred stone or encircling some sacred well.  People first paid  honour to a spot and afterwards gained glory for it.  Men did not love  Rome because she was great. She was great because they had loved her.         The eighteenth-century theories of the social contract have  been exposed to much clumsy criticism in our time; in so far  as they meant that there is at the back of all historic government  an idea of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1300"],[0,"Riders of the Purple Sage (#14)"],[1,"her room  and changed to the riding-clothes she always donned when going into  the sage. In this male attire her mirror showed her a jaunty, handsome  rider. If she expected some little need of admiration from Lassiter, she  had no cause for disappointment. The gentle smile that she liked, which  made of him another person, slowly overspread his face.    \"If I didn't take you for a boy!\" he exclaimed. \"It's powerful queer  what difference clothes make. Now I've been some scared of your dignity,  like when the other night you was all in white but in this rig--\"    Black Star came pounding into the court, dragging Jerd half off his  feet, and he whistled at Lassiter's black. But at sight of Jane all his  defiant lines seemed to soften, and with tosses of his beautiful head he  whipped his bridle.    \"Down, Black Star, down,\" said Jane.    He dropped his head, and, slowly lengthening, he bent one foreleg, then  the other, and sank to his knees. Jane slipped her left foot in the  stirrup, swung lightly into the saddle, and Black Star rose with a  ringing stamp. It was not easy for Jane to hold him to a canter through  the grove, and like the wind he broke when he saw the sage. Jane let him  have a couple of miles of free running on the open trail, and then she  coaxed him in and waited for her companion. Lassiter was not long in  catching up, and presently they were riding side by side. It reminded  her how she used to ride with Venters. Where was he now? She gazed  far down the slope to the curved purple lines of Deception Pass and  involuntarily shut her eyes with a trembling stir of nameless fear.    \"We'll turn off here,\" Lassiter said, \"en' take to the sage a mile or  so. The white herd is behind them big ridges.\"    \"What are you going to show me?\" asked Jane. \"I'm prepared--don't be  afraid.\"    He smiled as if he meant that bad news came swiftly enough without being  presaged by speech.    When they reached the lee of a rolling ridge Lassiter dismounted,  motioning to her to do likewise. They left the horses standing, bridles  down. Then Lassiter, carrying the field-glasses began to lead the way  up the slow rise of ground. Upon nearing the summit he halted her with a  gesture.    \"I reckon we'd see more if we didn't show ourselves against the sky,\"  he said. \"I was here less than an hour ago. Then the herd was seven or  eight miles south, an' if they ain't bolted yet--\"    \"Lassiter!... Bolted?\"    \"That's what I said. Now let's see.\"    Jane climbed a few more paces behind him and then peeped over the ridge.  Just beyond began a shallow swale that deepened and widened into a  valley and then swung to the left. Following the undulating sweep of  sage, Jane saw the straggling lines and then the great body of the white  herd. She knew enough about steers, even at a distance of four or  five miles, to realize that something was in the wind. Bringing her  field-glass into use, she moved it slowly from left to right, which  action swept the whole herd into range. The stragglers were restless;  the more compactly massed steers were browsing. Jane brought the glass  back to the big sentinels of the herd, and she saw them trot with quick  steps, stop short and toss wide horns, look everywhere, and then trot in  another direction.    \"Judkins hasn't been able to get his boys together yet,\" said Jane. \"But  he'll be there soon. I hope not too late. Lassiter, what's frightening  those big leaders?\"    \"Nothin' jest on the minute,\" replied Lassiter. \"Them steers are  quietin' down. They've been scared, but not bad yet. I reckon the whole  herd has moved a few miles this way since I was here.\"    \"They didn't browse that distance--not in less than an hour. Cattle  aren't sheep.\"    \"No, they jest run it, en' that looks bad.\"    \"Lassiter, what frightened them?\" repeated Jane, impatiently.    \"Put down your glass. You'll see at first better with a naked eye. Now  look along them ridges on the other side of the herd, the ridges where  the sun shines bright on the sage.... That's right. Now look en' look  hard en' wait.\"    Long-drawn moments of straining sight rewarded Jane with nothing save  the low, purple rim of ridge and the shimmering sage.    \"It's begun again!\" whispered Lassiter, and he gripped her arm.  \"Watch.... There, did you see that?\"    \"No, no. Tell me what to look for?\"    \"A white flash--a kind of pin-point of quick light--a gleam as from sun  shinin' on somethin' white.\"    Suddenly Jane's concentrated gaze caught a fleeting glint. Quickly she  brought her glass to bear on the spot. Again the purple sage, magnified  in color and size and wave, for long moments irritated her with its  monotony. Then from out of the sage on the ridge flew up a broad, white  object, flashed in the sunlight and vanished. Like magic it was, and  bewildered Jane.    \"What on earth is that?\"    \"I reckon there's some one behind that ridge throwin' up a sheet or a  white blanket to reflect the sunshine.\"    \"Why?\" queried Jane, more bewildered than ever.    \"To stampede the herd,\" replied Lassiter, and his teeth clicked.    \"Ah!\" She made a fierce, passionate movement, clutched the glass  tightly, shook as with the passing of a spasm, and then dropped her  head. Presently she raised it to greet Lassiter with something like a  smile. \"My righteous brethren are at work again,\" she said, in scorn.  She had stifled the leap of her wrath, but for perhaps the first time  in her life a bitter derision curled her lips. Lassiter's cool gray eyes  seemed to pierce her. \"I said I was prepared for anything; but that was  hardly true. But why would they--anybody stampede my cattle?\"    \"That's a Mormon's godly way of bringin' a woman to her knees.\"    \"Lassiter, I'll die before I ever bend my knees. I might be led I won't  be driven. Do you expect the herd to bolt?\"    \"I don't like the looks of them big steers. But you can never tell.  Cattle sometimes stampede as easily as buffalo. Any little flash or move  will start them. A rider gettin' down an' walkin' toward them sometimes  will make them jump an' fly. Then again nothin' seems to scare them.  But I reckon that white flare will do the biz. It's a new one on me,  an' I've seen some ridin' an' rustlin'. It jest takes one of them  God-fearin' Mormons to think of devilish tricks.\"    \"Lassiter, might not this trick be done by Oldring's men?\" asked Jane,  ever grasping at straws.    \"It might be, but it ain't,\" replied Lassiter. \"Oldring's an honest  thief. He don't skulk behind ridges to scatter your cattle to the four  winds. He rides down on you, an' if you don't like it you can throw a  gun.\"    Jane bit her tongue to refrain from championing men who at the very  moment were proving to her that they were little and mean compared even  with rustlers.    \"Look!... Jane, them leadin' steers have bolted. They're drawin' the  stragglers, an' that'll pull the whole herd.\"    Jane was not quick enough to catch the details called out by Lassiter,  but she saw the line of cattle lengthening. Then, like a stream of white  bees pouring from a huge swarm, the steers stretched out from the main  body. In a few moments, with astonishing rapidity, the whole herd got  into motion. A faint roar of trampling hoofs came to Jane's ears, and  gradually swelled; low, rolling clouds of dust began to rise above the  sage.    \"It's a stampede, an' a hummer,\" said Lassiter.    \"Oh, Lassiter! The herd's running with the valley! It leads into the  canyon! There's a straight jump-off!\"    \"I reckon they'll run into it, too. But that's a good many miles yet.  An', Jane, this valley swings round almost north before it goes east.  That stampede will pass within a mile of us.\"    The long, white, bobbing line of steers streaked swiftly through the  sage, and a funnel-shaped dust-cloud arose at a low angle. A dull  rumbling filled Jane's ears.    \"I'm thinkin' of millin' that herd,\" said Lassiter. His gray glance  swept up the slope to the west. \"There's some specks an' dust way off  toward the village. Mebbe that's Judkins an' his boys. It ain't likely  he'll get here in time to help. You'd better hold Black Star here on  this high ridge.\"    He ran to his horse and, throwing off saddle-bags and tightening the  cinches, he leaped astride and galloped straight down across the valley.    Jane went for Black Star and, leading him to the summit of the ridge,  she mounted and faced the valley with excitement and expectancy. She had  heard of milling stampeded cattle, and knew it was a feat accomplished  by only the most daring riders.    The white herd was now strung out in a line two miles long. The dull  rumble of thousands of hoofs deepened into continuous low thunder, and  as the steers swept swiftly closer the thunder became a heavy roll.  Lassiter crossed in a few moments the level of the valley to the eastern  rise of ground and there waited the coming of the herd. Presently, as  the head of the white line reached a point opposite to where Jane stood,  Lassiter spurred his black into a run.    Jane saw him take a position on the off side of the leaders of the  stampede, and there he rode. It was like a race. They swept on down the  valley, and when the end of the white line neared Lassiter's first  stand the head had begun to swing round to the west. It swung slowly and  stubbornly, yet surely, and gradually assumed a long, beautiful curve of  moving white. To Jane's amaze she saw the leaders swinging, turning till  they headed back toward her and up the valley. Out to the right of  these wild plunging steers ran Lassiter's black, and Jane's keen eye  appreciated the fleet stride and sure-footedness of the blind horse.  Then it seemed that the herd moved in a great curve, a huge half-moon  with the points of head and tail almost opposite, and a mile apart But  Lassiter relentlessly crowded the leaders, sheering them to the left,  turning them little by little. And the dust-blinded wild followers  plunged on"]]]
