Scott, _The  Betrothed_ (time, Henry II.).    AM'GIAD, son of Camaralzaman and Badoura, and half-brother of Assad  (son of Camaralzaman and Haiatal'nefous). Each of the two mothers  conceived a base passion for the other's son, and when the young  princes revolted at their advances, accused them to their father of  designs upon their honor. Camaralzaman ordered his emir Giondar to put  them both to death, but as the young men had saved him from a lion he  laid no hand on them, but told them not to return to their father's  dominions. They wandered on for a time, and then parted, but both  reached the same place, which was a city of the Magi. Here, by a  strange adventure Amgiad was made vizier, while Assad was thrown into  a dungeon, where he was designed as a sacrifice to the fire-god.  Bosta'na, a daughter of the old man who imprisoned Assad, released  him, and Amgiad out of gratitude made her his wife. After which, the  king, who was greatly advanced in years, appointed him his successor,  and Amgiad used his best efforts to abolish the worship of fire and  establish \"the true faith.\"--_Arabian Nights_ (\"Amgiad and Assad\").    AM'YAS, a squire of low degree, beloved by Aemylia. They agreed  to meet at a given spot, but on their way thither both were taken  captives--Amyas by Corflambo, and Aemylia by a man monster. Aemylia  was released by Belphoebe (3 _syl_.), who slew \"the caitiff;\" and  Amyas by prince Arthur, who slew Corflambo. The two lovers were then  brought together by the prince \"in peace and joyous blis.\"--Spenser,  _Faery Queen_, iv. 7, 9 (1596).    AMI'DAS, the younger brother of Brac'idas, sons of Mile'sio; the  former in love with the dowerless Lucy, and the latter with the  wealthy Philtra. The two brothers had each an island of equal size and  value left them by their father, but the sea daily added to the island  of the younger brother, and encroached on that belonging to Bracidas.  When Philtra saw that the property of Amidas was daily increasing,  she forsook the elder brother and married the wealthier; while Lucy,  seeing herself jilted, threw herself into the sea. A floating chest  attracted her attention, she clung to it, and was drifted to the  wasted island. It was found to contain great riches, and Lucy gave its  contents and herself to Bracidas. Amidas claimed the chest as his own  by right, and the question in dispute was submitted to sir Ar'tegal.  The wise arbiter decided, that whereas Armidas claimed as his own all  the additions given to his island by the sea, Lucy might claim as her  own the chest, because the sea had given it to her.--Spenser, _Faery  Queen_, v. 4 (1596).    AM'IEL, in Dryden's _Absalom and Achitophel_, is meant for sir Edward  Seymour, Speaker of the House of Commons.      Who can Amiel's praise refuse?    Of ancient race by birth, but nobler yet    In his own worth, and without title great.    The sanhedrim long time as chief he ruled,    Their reason guided, and their passion cooled.    Part i.    A'MIN (_Prince_), son of the caliph Haroun-al-Raschid; he married  Am'ine, sister of Zobeide (3 _syl_.), the caliph's wife.--_Arabian  Nights' Entertainments_ (\"The History of Amine\").    _Am'ina_, an orphan, who walked in her sleep. She was betrothed to  Elvi'no, a rich farmer, but being found the night before the wedding  in the chamber of count Rodolpho, Elvino rightly refused to marry her.  The count remonstrated with the young farmer, and while they were  talking, the orphan was seen to get out of a window and walk along  the narrow edge of a mill-roof while the great wheel was rapidly  revolving; she then crossed a crazy old bridge, and came into the same  chamber. Here she awoke, and, seeing Elvino, threw her arms around  him so lovingly, that all his doubts vanished, and he married  her.--Bellini, _La Sonnambula_ (an opera, 1831).    AM'INE (3 _syl_.), half-sister of Zobei'de (3 _syl_.), and wife of  Amin, the caliph's son. One day she went to purchase a robe, and the  seller told her he would charge nothing if she would suffer him to  kiss her cheek. Instead of kissing he bit it, and Amine, being asked  by her husband how she came by the wound, so shuffled in her answers  that he commanded her to be put to death, a sentence he afterwards  commuted to scourging. One day she and her sister told the stories  of their lives to the caliph Haroun-al-Raschid, when Amin  became reconciled to his wife, and the caliph married her  half-sister.--_Arabian Nights'Entertainments_ (\"History of Zobeide and  History of Amine\").    AM'INE (3 _syl_.) or AM'INES (3 _syl_.), the beautiful wife of Sidi  Nouman. Instead of eating her rice with a spoon, she used a bodkin for  the purpose, and carried it to her mouth in infinitesimal portions.  This went on for some time, till Sidi Nouman determined to ascertain  on what his wife really fed, and to his horror discovered that she was  a ghoul, who went stealthily by night to the cemetery, and feasted on  the freshly-buried dead.--_Arabian Nights_ (\"History of Sidi Nouman\").      One of the Amines' sort, who pick up their    grains of food with a bodkin.--O.W. Holmes,    _Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table_.    AMIN'TOR, a young nobleman, the troth-plight husband of Aspatia, but  by the king's command he marries Evad'ne (3 _syl_.). This is the great  event of the tragedy of which Amintor is the hero. The sad story of  Evadne, the heroine, gives name to the play.--Beaumont and Fletcher,  _The Maid's Tragedy_ (1610).    (Till the reign of Charles II., the kings of England claimed the  feudal right of disposing in marriage any one who owed them feudal  allegiance. In _All's Well that Ends Well_, Shakespeare makes the king  of France exercise a similar right, when he commands Bertram, count  of Rousillon, to marry against his will Hel'ena, the physician's  daughter.)    AMIS THE PRIEST, the hero of a comic German epic of the 13th century,  represented as an Englishman, a man of great wit and humor, but  ignorant and hypocritical. His popularity excites the envy of the  superior clergy, who seek to depose him from the priesthood by making  public exposition of his ignorance, but by his quickness at repartee  he always manages to turn the laugh against them.--Ascribed to  Stricker of Austria.    AM'LET (_Richard_), the gamester in Vanbrugh's _Confederacy_ (1695).  He is usually called \"Dick.\"      I saw Miss Pope for the second time, in the year 1790, in the  character of \"Flippanta,\" John Palmer being \"Dick Amlet,\" and Mrs.  Jordan \"Corinna.\"--James Smith.      _Mrs. Amlet_, a rich, vulgar tradeswoman, mother of _Dick_, of whom  she is very proud, although she calls him a \"sad scapegrace,\" and  swears \"he will be hanged.\" At last she settles on him L10,000, and he  marries Corinna, daughter of Gripe the rich scrivener.    AMMO'NIAN HORN (_The_), the cornucopia. Ammon king of Lib'ya gave to  his mistress Amalthe'a (mother of Bacchus) a tract of land resembling  a ram's horn in shape, and hence called the \"_Ammonian_ horn\" (from  the giver), the \"_Amalthe'an_ horn\" (from the receiver), and the  \"_Hesperian_ horn\" (from its locality). Amalthea also personifies  fertility. (Ammon is Ham, son of Noah, founder of the African race.)  (See AMALTHEA.)      [Here] Amalthea pours,    Well pleased, the wealth of that Ammonian horn,    Her dower.     Akenside, _Hymn to the Naiads_.    AM'MON'S SON. Alexander the Great called himself the son of the god  Ammon, but others call him the son of Philip of Macedon.      Of food I think with Philip's son, or rather    Ammon's (ill pleased with one world and one    father).    Byron, _Don Juan_, v. 31.    (Alluding to the tale that when Alexander had conquered the whole  world, he wept that there was no other world to conquer.)    A'MON'S SON is Rinaldo, eldest son of Amon or Aymon marquis d'Este,  and nephew of Charlemagne.--Ariosto, _Orlando Furioso_ (1516).    AM'ORET, a modest, faithful shepherdess, who plighted her troth to  Per'igot (_t_ sounded) at the \"Virtuous Well.\" The wanton shepherdess  Amarillis, having by enchantment assumed her appearance and dress, so  disgusted Perigot with her bold ways, that he lost his love for the  true Amoret, repulsed her with indignation, and tried to kill her. The  deception was revealed by Cor'in, \"the faithful shepherdess,\" and the  lovers being reconciled, were happily married.--John Fletcher, _The  Faithful Shepherdess_ (before 1611).    AMORET'TA or AM'ORET, twin-born with Belphoebe (3 _syl_.), their  mother being Chrysog'one (4 _syl_.). While the mother and her two  babes were asleep, Diana took one (Belphoebe) to bring up, and Venus  the other. Venus committed Amoretta to the charge of Psyche (2  _syl_.), and Psyche tended her as lovingly as she tended her own  daughter Pleasure, \"to whom she became the companion.\" When grown to  marriageable estate, Amoretta was brought to Fairyland, and wounded  many a heart, but gave her own only to sir Scudamore (bk. iii. 6).  Being seized by Bu'sirane, an enchanter, she was kept in durance  by him because she would not \"her true love deny;\" but Britomart  delivered her and bound the enchanter (bk. iii. 11, 12), after which  she became the tender, loving wife of sir Scudamore.    _Amoret_ is the type of female loveliness and wifely affection, soft,  warm, chaste, gentle, and ardent; not sensual nor yet platonic, but  that living, breathing, warm-hearted love which fits woman for the  fond mother and faithful wife.--Spenser, _Faery Queen_, iii. (1590).    AMOUR'Y (_Sir Giles_), the Grand-Master of the Knights Templars, who  conspires with the marquis of Montserrat against Richard I. Saladin  cuts off the Templar's head while in the act of drinking.--Sir W.  Scott, _The Talisman_ (time, Richard I.).    AM'PHIBAL (_St._), confessor of St. Alban of Verulam.

And now  those wonderful kingdoms of song that the dark musicians established  all night by magical chords dropped back again to the sway of that  ancient silence who ruled before the gods, and the musicians wrapped  their cloaks about them and covered up their marvellous instruments  and stole away to the plains; and no one dared ask them whither they  went or why they dwelt there, or what god they served.  And the dance  stopped and all the queens departed.  And then the female slave came  out again by a door and emptied her basket of sapphires down the abyss  as I saw her do before.  Beautiful Saranoora said that those great  queens would never wear their sapphires more than once and that every  day at noon a merchant from the mountains sold new ones for that  evening.  Yet I suspected that something more than extravagance lay at  the back of that seemingly wasteful act of tossing sapphires into an  abyss, for there were in the depths of it those two dragons of gold of  whom nothing seemed to be known.  And I thought, and I think so still,  that Singanee, terrific though he was in war with the elephants, from  whose tusks he had built his palace, well knew and even feared those  dragons in the abyss, and perhaps valued those priceless jewels less  than he valued his queens, and that he to whom so many lands paid  beautiful tribute out of their dread of his spear, himself paid  tribute to the golden dragons. Whether those dragons had wings I could  not see; nor, if they had, could I tell if they could bear that weight  of solid gold from the abyss; nor by what paths they could crawl from  it did I know. And I know not what use to a golden dragon should  sapphires be or a queen. Only it seemed strange to me that so much  wealth of jewels should be thrown by command of a man who had nothing  to fear--to fall flashing and changing their colours at dawn into an  abyss.    I do not know how long we lingered there watching the sunrise on those  miles of amethyst.  And it is strange that that great and famous  wonder did not move me more than it did, but my mind was dazzled by  the fame of it and my eyes were actually dazzled by the blaze, and as  often happens I thought more of little things and remember watching  the daylight in the solitary sapphire that Saranoora had and that she  wore upon her finger in a ring.  Then, the dawn wind being all about  her, she said that she was cold and turned back into the ivory palace.  And I feared that we might never meet again, for time moves  differently over the Lands of Dream than over the fields we know; like  ocean-currents going different ways and bearing drifting ships.  And  at the doorway of the ivory palace I turned to say farewell and yet I  found no words that were suitable to say.  And often now when I stand  in other lands I stop and think of many things to have said; yet all I  said was \"Perhaps we shall meet again.\"  And she said that it was  likely that we should often meet for that this was a little thing for  the gods to permit not knowing that the gods of the Lands of Dream  have little power upon the fields we know.  Then she went in through  the doorway. And having exchanged for my own clothes again the raiment  that the chamberlain had given me I turned from the hospitality of  mighty Singanee and set my face towards the fields we know.  I crossed  that enormous tusk that had been the end of Perdondaris and met the  artists carving it as I went; and some by way of greeting as I passed  extolled Singanee, and in answer I gave honour to his name.  Daylight  had not yet penetrated wholly to the bottom of the abyss but the  darkness was giving place to a purple haze and I could faintly see one  golden dragon there. Then looking once towards the ivory palace, and  seeing no one at the windows, I turned sorrowfully away, and going by  the way that I knew passed through the gap in the mountains and down  their slopes till I came again in sight of the witch's cottage.  And  as I went to the upper window to look for the fields we know, the  witch spoke to me; but I was cross, as one newly waked from sleep, and  I would not answer her. Then the cat questioned me as to whom I had  met, and I answered him that in the fields we know cats kept their  place and did not speak to man.  And then I came downstairs and walked  straight out of the door, heading for Go-by Street.  \"You are going  the wrong way,\" the witch called through the window; and indeed I had  no sooner gone back to the ivory palace again, but I had no right to  trespass any further on the hospitality of Singanee and one cannot  stay always in the Lands of Dream, and what knowledge had that old  witch of the call of the fields we know or the little though many  snares that bind our feet therein? So I paid no heed to her, but kept  on, and came to Go-by Street.  I saw the house with the green door  some way up the street but thinking that the near end of the street  was closer to the Embankment where I had left my boat I tried the  first door I came to, a cottage thatched like the rest, with little  golden spires along the roof-ridge, and strange birds sitting there  and preening marvellous feathers.  The door opened, and to my surprise  I found myself in what seemed like a shepherd's cottage; a man who was  sitting on a log of wood in a little low dark room said something to  me in an alien language.  I muttered something and hurried through to  the street. The house was thatched in front as well as behind.  There  were not golden spires in front, no marvellous birds; but there was no  pavement.  There was a row of houses, byres, and barns but no other  sign of a town.  Far off I saw one or two little villages.  Yet there  was the river--and no doubt the Thames, for it was the width of the  Thames and had the curves of it, if you can imagine the Thames in that  particular spot without a city around it, without any bridges, and the  Embankment fallen in.  I saw that there had happened to me permanently  and in the light of day some such thing as happens to a man, but to a  child more often, when he awakes before morning in some strange room  and sees a high, grey window where the door ought to be and unfamiliar  objects in wrong places and though knowing where he is yet knows not  how it can be that the place should look like that.    A flock of sheep came by me presently looking the same as ever, but  the man who led them had a wild, strange look.  I spoke to him and he  did not understand me.  Then I went down to the river to see if my  boat was there and at the very spot where I had left it, in the mud  (for the tide was low) I saw a half-buried piece of blackened wood  that might have been part of a boat, but I could not tell.  I began to  feel that I had missed the world.  It would be a strange thing to  travel from far away to see London and not be able to find it among  all the roads that lead there, but I seemed to have travelled in Time  and to have missed it among the centuries.  And when as I wandered  over the grassy hills I came on a wattled shrine that was thatched  with straw and saw a lion in it more worn with time than even the  Sphinx at Gizeh and when I knew it for one of the four in Trafalgar  Square then I saw that I was stranded far away in the future with many  centuries of treacherous years between me and anything that I had  known.  And then I sat on the grass by the worn paws of the lion to  think out what to do.  And I decided to go back through Go-by Street  and, since there was nothing left to keep me any more to the fields we  know, to offer myself as a servant in the palace of Singanee, and to  see again the face of Saranoora and those famous, wonderful,  amethystine dawns upon the abyss where the golden dragons play.  And I  stayed no longer to look for remains of the ruins of London; for there  is little pleasure in seeing wonderful things if there is no one at  all to hear of them and to wonder.  So I returned at once to Go-by  Street, the little row of huts, and saw no other record that London  had been except that one stone lion.  I went to the right house this  time.  It was very much altered and more like one of those huts that  one sees on Salisbury plain than a shop in the city of London, but I  found it by counting the houses in the street for it was still a row  of houses though pavement and city were gone. And it was still a shop.  A very different shop to the one I knew, but things were for sale  there--shepherd's crooks, food, and rude axes.  And a man with long  hair was there who was clad in skins. I did not speak to him for I did  not know his language. He said to me something that sounded like  \"Everkike.\"  It conveyed no meaning to me; but when he looked towards  one of his buns, light suddenly dawned in my mind, and I knew that  England was even England still and that still she was not conquered,  and that though they had tired of London they still held to their  land; for the words that the man had said were, \"Av er kike,\" and then  I knew that that very language that was carried to distant lands by  the old, triumphant cockney was spoken still in his birthplace and  that neither his politics nor his enemies had destroyed him after all  these thousand years.  I had always disliked the Cockney dialect--and  with the arrogance of the Irishman who hears from rich and poor the  English of the splendour of Elizabeth; and yet when I heard those  words my eyes felt sore as with impending tears--it should be  remembered how far away I was.  I think I was silent for a little  while.  Suddenly I saw that the man who kept the shop was asleep.  That habit was strangely like the ways of a man who if he were then  alive would be (if I could judge from the time-worn look of the lion)  over a thousand years old.  But then"]]]
