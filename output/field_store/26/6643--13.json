Hypocrisy A-La-Mode         Upon a simmer Sunday morn       When Nature's face is fair,       I walked forth to view the corn,       An' snuff the caller air.       The rising sun owre Galston muirs       Wi' glorious light was glintin;       The hares were hirplin down the furrs,       The lav'rocks they were chantin       Fu' sweet that day.         As lightsomely I glowr'd abroad,       To see a scene sae gay,       Three hizzies, early at the road,       Cam skelpin up the way.       Twa had manteeles o' dolefu' black,       But ane wi' lyart lining;       The third, that gaed a wee a-back,       Was in the fashion shining       Fu' gay that day.         The twa appear'd like sisters twin,       In feature, form, an' claes;       Their visage wither'd, lang an' thin,       An' sour as only slaes:       The third cam up, hap-stap-an'-lowp,       As light as ony lambie,       An' wi'a curchie low did stoop,       As soon as e'er she saw me,       Fu' kind that day.         Wi' bonnet aff, quoth I, \"Sweet lass,       I think ye seem to ken me;       I'm sure I've seen that bonie face       But yet I canna name ye.\"       Quo' she, an' laughin as she spak,       An' taks me by the han's,       \"Ye, for my sake, hae gien the feck       Of a' the ten comman's       A screed some day.\"         \"My name is Fun--your cronie dear,       The nearest friend ye hae;       An' this is Superstitution here,       An' that's Hypocrisy.       I'm gaun to Mauchline Holy Fair,       To spend an hour in daffin:       Gin ye'll go there, yon runkl'd pair,       We will get famous laughin       At them this day.\"         Quoth I, \"Wi' a' my heart, I'll do't;       I'll get my Sunday's sark on,       An' meet you on the holy spot;       Faith, we'se hae fine remarkin!\"       Then I gaed hame at crowdie-time,       An' soon I made me ready;       For roads were clad, frae side to side,       Wi' mony a weary body       In droves that day.         Here farmers gash, in ridin graith,       Gaed hoddin by their cotters;       There swankies young, in braw braid-claith,       Are springing owre the gutters.       The lasses, skelpin barefit, thrang,       In silks an' scarlets glitter;       Wi' sweet-milk cheese, in mony a whang,       An' farls, bak'd wi' butter,       Fu' crump that day.         When by the plate we set our nose,       Weel heaped up wi' ha'pence,       A greedy glowr black-bonnet throws,       An' we maun draw our tippence.       Then in we go to see the show:       On ev'ry side they're gath'rin;       Some carrying dails, some chairs an' stools,       An' some are busy bleth'rin       Right loud that day.         Here stands a shed to fend the show'rs,       An' screen our countra gentry;       There Racer Jess,^2 an' twa-three whores,       Are blinkin at the entry.       Here sits a raw o' tittlin jads,       Wi' heaving breast an' bare neck;       An' there a batch o' wabster lads,       Blackguarding frae Kilmarnock,       For fun this day.         Here, some are thinkin on their sins,       An' some upo' their claes;       Ane curses feet that fyl'd his shins,       Anither sighs an' prays:       On this hand sits a chosen swatch,       Wi' screwed-up, grace-proud faces;       On that a set o' chaps, at watch,       Thrang winkin on the lasses       To chairs that day.         O happy is that man, an' blest!       Nae wonder that it pride him!       Whase ain dear lass, that he likes best,       Comes clinkin down beside him!       Wi' arms repos'd on the chair back,       He sweetly does compose him;       Which, by degrees, slips round her neck,       An's loof upon her bosom,       Unkend that day.

I know a few of  the simple principles of rustling myself. Do you want her thrown?\"    \"That's what I asked for.\"    \"Throw her, then,\" said Flood, \"and don't let's parley.\"    Fox rode back in to the herd, and after some little delay, located the  cow and worked her out to the edge of the cattle. Dropping his rope,  he cut her out clear of the herd, and as she circled around in an  endeavor to reenter, he rode close and made an easy cast of the rope  about her horns. As he threw his horse back to check the cow, I rode  to his assistance, my rope in hand, and as the cow turned ends, I  heeled her. A number of the outfit rode up and dismounted, and one of  the boys taking her by the tail, we threw the animal as humanely as  possible. In order to get at the brand, which was on the side, we  turned the cow over, when Flood took out his knife and cut the hair  away, leaving the brand easily traceable.    \"What is she, Jim?\" inquired Fox, as he sat his horse holding the rope  taut.    \"I'll let this man who claims her answer that question,\" replied  Flood, as her claimant critically examined the brand to his  satisfaction.    \"I claim her as an 'O' cow,\" said the stranger, facing Flood.    \"Well, you claim more than you'll ever get,\" replied our foreman.  \"Turn her loose, boys.\"    The cow was freed and turned back into the herd, but the claimant  tried to argue the matter with Flood, claiming the branding iron had  simply slipped, giving it the appearance of a \"Q\" instead of an \"O\" as  it was intended to be. Our foreman paid little attention to the  stranger, but when his persistence became annoying checked his  argument by saying,--    \"My Christian friend, there's no use arguing this matter. You asked to  have the cow thrown, and we threw her. You might as well try to tell  me that the cow is white as to claim her in any other brand than a  'Q.' You may read brands as well as I do, but you're wasting time  arguing against the facts. You'd better take your 'Window Sash' cattle  and ride on, for you've cut all you're going to cut here to-day. But  before you go, for fear I may never see you again, I'll take this  occasion to say that I think you're common cow thieves.\"    By his straight talk, our foreman stood several inches higher in our  estimation as we sat our horses, grinning at the discomfiture of the  trail cutters, while a dozen six-shooters slouched languidly at our  hips to give emphasis to his words.    \"Before going, I'll take this occasion to say to you that you will see  me again,\" replied the leader, riding up and confronting Flood. \"You  haven't got near enough men to bluff me. As to calling me a cow thief,  that's altogether too common a name to offend any one; and from what I  can gather, the name wouldn't miss you or your outfit over a thousand  miles. Now in taking my leave, I want to tell you that you'll see me  before another day passes, and what's more, I'll bring an outfit with  me and we'll cut your herd clean to your road brand, if for no better  reasons, just to learn you not to be so insolent.\"    After hanging up this threat, Flood said to him as he turned to ride  away, \"Well, now, my young friend, you're bargaining for a whole lot  of fun. I notice you carry a gun and quite naturally suppose you shoot  a little as occasion requires. Suppose when you and your outfit come  back, you come a-shooting, so we'll know who you are; for I 'll  promise you there's liable to be some powder burnt when you cut this  herd.\"    Amid jeers of derision from our outfit, the trail cutters drove off  their three lonely \"Window Sash\" cattle. We had gained the point we  wanted, and now in case of any trouble, during inspection or at night,  we had the river behind us to catch our herd. We paid little attention  to the threat of our disappointed callers, but several times Straw's  remarks as to the character of the residents of those hills to the  westward recurred to my mind. I was young, but knew enough, instead of  asking foolish questions, to keep mum, though my eyes and ears drank  in everything. Before we had been on the trail over an hour, we met  two men riding down the trail towards the river. Meeting us, they  turned and rode along with our foreman, some distance apart from the  herd, for nearly an hour, and curiosity ran freely among us boys  around the herd as to who they might be. Finally Flood rode forward to  the point men and gave the order to throw off the trail and make a  short drive that afternoon. Then in company with the two strangers, he  rode forward to overtake our wagon, and we saw nothing more of him  until we reached camp that evening. This much, however, our point man  was able to get from our foreman: that the two men were members of a  detachment of Rangers who had been sent as a result of information  given by the first herd over the trail that year. This herd, which had  passed some twenty days ahead of us, had met with a stampede below the  river, and on reaching Abilene had reported the presence of rustlers  preying on through herds at the crossing of the Colorado.    On reaching camp that evening with the herd, we found ten of the  Rangers as our guests for the night. The detachment was under a  corporal named Joe Hames, who had detailed the two men we had met  during the afternoon to scout this crossing. Upon the information  afforded by our foreman about the would-be trail cutters, these  scouts, accompanied by Flood, had turned back to advise the Ranger  squad, encamped in a secluded spot about ten miles northeast of the  Colorado crossing. They had only arrived late the day before, and this  was their first meeting with any trail herd to secure any definite  information.    Hames at once assumed charge of the herd, Flood gladly rendering every  assistance possible. We night herded as usual, but during the two  middle guards, Hames sent out four of his Rangers to scout the  immediate outlying country, though, as we expected, they met with no  adventure. At daybreak the Rangers threw their packs into our wagon  and their loose stock into our _remuda_, and riding up the trail a  mile or more, left us, keeping well out of sight. We were all hopeful  now that the trail cutters of the day before would make good their  word and return. In this hope we killed time for several hours that  morning, grazing the cattle and holding the wagon in the rear. Sending  the wagon ahead of the herd had been agreed on as the signal between  our foreman and the Ranger corporal, at first sight of any posse  behind us. We were beginning to despair of their coming, when a dust  cloud appeared several miles back down the trail. We at once hurried  the wagon and _remuda_ ahead to warn the Rangers, and allowed the  cattle to string out nearly a mile in length.    A fortunate rise in the trail gave us a glimpse of the cavalcade in  our rear, which was entirely too large to be any portion of Straw's  outfit; and shortly we were overtaken by our trail cutters of the day  before, now increased to twenty-two mounted men. Flood was  intentionally in the lead of the herd, and the entire outfit galloped  forward to stop the cattle. When they had nearly reached the lead,  Flood turned back and met the rustlers.    \"Well, I'm as good as my word,\" said the leader, \"and I'm here to trim  your herd as I promised you I would. Throw off and hold up your  cattle, or I'll do it for you.\"    Several of our outfit rode up at this juncture in time to hear Flood's  reply: \"If you think you're equal to the occasion, hold them up  yourself. If I had as big an outfit _as_ you have, I wouldn't ask any  man to help me. I want to watch a Colorado River outfit work a  herd,--I might learn something. My outfit will take a rest, or perhaps  hold the cut or otherwise clerk for you. But be careful and don't  claim anything that you are not certain is your own, for I reserve the  right to look over your cut before you drive it away.\"    The rustlers rode in a body to the lead, and when they had thrown the  herd off the trail, about half of them rode back and drifted forward  the rear cattle. Flood called our outfit to one side and gave us our  instructions, the herd being entirely turned over to the rustlers.  After they began cutting, we rode around and pretended to assist in  holding the cut as the strays in our herd were being cut out. When the  red \"Q\" cow came out, Fox cut her back, which nearly precipitated a  row, for she was promptly recut to the strays by the man who claimed  her the day before. Not a man of us even cast a glance up the trail,  or in the direction of the Rangers; but when the work was over, Flood  protested with the leader of the rustlers over some five or six head  of dim-branded cattle which actually belonged to our herd. But he was  exultant and would listen to no protests, and attempted to drive away  the cut, now numbering nearly fifty head. Then we rode across their  front and stopped them.    In the parley which ensued, harsh words were passing, when one of our  outfit blurted out in well feigned surprise,--    \"Hello, who's that, coming over there?\"    A squad of men were riding leisurely through our abandoned herd,  coming over to where the two outfits were disputing.    \"What's the trouble here, gents?\" inquired Hames as he rode up.    \"Who are you and what might be your business, may I ask?\" inquired the  leader of the rustlers.    \"Personally I'm nobody, but officially I'm Corporal in Company B,  Texas Rangers--well, if there isn't smiling Ed Winters, the biggest  cattle thief ever born in Medina County. Why, I've got papers for you;  for altering the brands on over fifty head of 'C' cattle into a 'G'  brand. Come here, dear, and give me that gun of yours. Come on, and no  false moves or funny work or I'll shoot the white out of your eye."]]]
