Some of his  prophecies were so disagreeable to Pope Innocent VI, that the Pontiff  determined to put a stop to them, by locking up the prophet in the  dungeons of the Vatican. It is generally believed that he died there,  though there is no evidence of the fact. His chief works are the \"Book  of Light,\" the \"Five Essences,\" the \"Heaven of Philosophers,\" and his  grand work \"De Confectione Lapidis.\" He was not thought a shining light  among the adepts. Ortholani was another pretender, of whom nothing is  known, but that he exercised the arts of alchymy and astrology at Paris,  shortly before the time of Nicholas Flamel. His work on the practice of  alchymy was written in that city in 1358. Isaac of Holland wrote, it  is supposed, about this time; and his son also devoted himself to the  science. Nothing worth repeating is known of their lives. Boerhaave  speaks with commendation of many passages in their works, and Paracelsus  esteemed them highly: the chief are \"De Triplici Ordine Elixiris et  Lapidis Theoria,\" printed at Berne in 1608; and \"Mineralia Opera, seu  de Lapide Philosophico,\" printed at Middleburg in 1600. They also wrote  eight other works upon the same subject. Koffstky, a Pole, wrote an  alchymical treatise, entitled \"The Tincture of Minerals,\" about the  year 1488. In this list of authors a royal name must not be forgotten.  Charles VI. of France, one of the most credulous princes of the day,  whose court absolutely swarmed with alchymists, conjurers, astrologers,  and quacks of every description, made several attempts to discover  the philosopher's stone, and thought he knew so much about it, that  he determined to enlighten the world with a treatise. It is called the  \"Royal Work of Charles VI. of France, and the Treasure of Philosophy.\"  It is said to be the original from which Nicholas Flamel took the idea  of his \"Desir Desire.\" Lenglet du Fresnoy says it is very allegorical,  and utterly incomprehensible. For a more complete list of the hermetic  philosophers of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the reader is  referred to the third volume of Lenglet's History already quoted.

During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the search for the  philosopher's stone was continued by thousands of the enthusiastic and  the credulous; but a great change was introduced during this period.  The eminent men who devoted themselves to the study, totally changed  its aspect, and referred to the possession of their wondrous stone and  elixir, not only the conversion of the base into the precious metals,  but the solution of all the difficulties of other sciences. They  pretended that by its means man would be brought into closer communion  with his Maker; that disease and sorrow would be banished from the  world; and that \"the millions of spiritual beings who walk the earth  unseen\" would be rendered visible, and become the friends, companions,  and instructors of mankind. In the seventeenth century more especially,  these poetical and fantastic doctrines excited the notice of Europe;  and from Germany, where they had been first disseminated by Rosencreutz,  spread into France and England, and ran away with the sound judgment of  many clever, but too enthusiastic, searchers for the truth. Paracelsus,  Dee, and many others of less note, were captivated by the grace and  beauty of the new mythology, which was arising to adorn the literature  of Europe. Most of the alchymists of the sixteenth century, although  ignorant of the Rosicrucians as a sect, were, in some degree, tinctured  with their fanciful tenets: but before we speak more fully of these  poetical visionaries, it will be necessary to resume the history of the  hermetic folly where we left off in the former chapter, and trace the  gradual change that stole over the dreams of the adepts. It will be seen  that the infatuation increased rather than diminished as the world grew  older.    AUGURELLO.    Among the alchymists who were born in the fifteenth, and distinguished  themselves in the sixteenth century, the first, in point of date,  is John Aurelio Augurello. He was born at Rimini in 1441, and became  Professor of the belles lettres at Venice and Trevisa. He was early  convinced of the truth of the hermetic science, and used to pray to God  that he might be happy enough to discover the philosopher's stone.  He was continually surrounded by the paraphernalia of chemistry, and  expended all his wealth in the purchase of drugs and metals. He was also  a poet, but of less merit than pretensions. His \"Chrysopeia,\" in which  lie pretended to teach the art of making gold, he dedicated to Pope  Leo X, in the hope that the Pontiff would reward him handsomely for the  compliment; but the Pope was too good a judge of poetry to be pleased  with the worse than mediocrity of his poem, and too good a philosopher  to approve of the strange doctrines which it inculcated: he was,  therefore, far from gratified at the dedication. It is said, that when  Augurello applied to him for a reward, the Pope, with great ceremony  and much apparent kindness and cordiality, drew an empty purse from his  pocket, and presented it to the alchymist, saying, that since he was  able to make gold, the most appropriate present that could be made  him, was a purse to put it in. This scurvy reward was all that the poor  alchymist ever got either for his poetry or his alchymy. He died in a  state of extreme poverty, in the eighty-third year of his age.    CORNELIUS AGRIPPA.    This alchymist has left a more distinguished reputation. The most  extraordinary tales were told and believed of his powers. He could turn  iron into gold by his mere word. All the spirits of the air, and  demons of the earth, were under his command, and bound to obey him in  everything. He could raise from the dead the forms of the great men of  other days, and make them appear \"in their habit as they lived,\" to the  gaze of the curious who had courage enough to abide their presence.    He was born at Cologne in 1486, and began, at an early age, the study of  chemistry and philosophy. By some means or other which have never been  very clearly explained, he managed to impress his contemporaries with a  great idea of his wonderful attainments. At the early age of twenty, so  great was his reputation as an alchymist, that the principal adepts of  Paris wrote to Cologne, inviting him to settle in France, and aid them  with his experience in discovering the philosopher's stone. Honours  poured upon him in thick succession; and he was highly esteemed by all  the learned men of his time. Melancthon speaks of him with respect  and commendation. Erasmus also bears testimony in his favour; and the  general voice of his age proclaimed him a light of literature and an  ornament to philosophy. Some men, by dint of excessive egotism, manage  to persuade their contemporaries that they are very great men indeed:  they publish their acquirements so loudly in people's ears, and keep up  their own praises so incessantly, that the world's applause is actually  taken by storm. Such seems to have been the case with Agrippa. He  called himself a sublime theologian, an excellent jurisconsult, an able  physician, a great philosopher, and a successful alchymist. The world,  at last, took him at his word; and thought that a man who talked so  big, must have some merit to recommend him--that it was, indeed, a great  trumpet which sounded so obstreperous a blast. He was made secretary to  the Emperor Maximilian, who conferred upon him the title of Chevalier,  and gave him the honorary command of a regiment. He afterwards became  Professor of Hebrew and the belles lettres, at the University of Dole,  in France; but quarrelling with the Franciscan monks upon some knotty  point of divinity, he was obliged to quit the town. He took refuge in  London, where he taught Hebrew and cast nativities, for about a year.  From London he proceeded to Pavia, and gave lectures upon the writings,  real or supposed, of Hermes Trismegistus; and might have lived there in  peace and honour, had he not again quarrelled with the clergy. By their  means his position became so disagreeable, that he was glad to accept  an offer made him by the magistracy of Metz, to become their Syndic and  Advocate-General. Here, again, his love of disputation made him enemies:  the theological wiseacres of that city asserted, that St. Anne had three  husbands, in which opinion they were confirmed by the popular belief of  the day. Agrippa needlessly ran foul of this opinion, or prejudice as he  called it, and thereby lost much of his influence. Another dispute, more  creditable to his character, occurred soon after, and sank him for ever  in the estimation of the Metzians. Humanely taking the part of a young  girl who was accused of witchcraft, his enemies asserted, that he was  himself a sorcerer, and raised such a storm over his head, that he was  forced to fly the city. After this, he became physician to Louisa de  Savoy, mother of King Francis I. This lady was curious to know the  future, and required her physician to cast her nativity. Agrippa  replied, that he would not encourage such idle curiosity. The result  was, he lost her confidence, and was forthwith dismissed. If it had been  through his belief in the worthlessness of astrology, that he had made  his answer, we might admire his honest and fearless independence; but,  when it is known that, at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8855"],[0,"Astral Worship (#13)"],[1,"and a writer of  considerable eminence in the 17th century, said, in reference to the  complaisant spirit of the early church towards the Pagans, that \"it was  attended by very bad consequences, since Christianity became at last,  by that means, nothing else but reformed Paganism, as to its divine  worship.\" See Stillingfleet's defense of the charge of idolatry against  the Romanists, vol. 5, page 459. M. Turrentin, of Geneva, Switzerland,  a learned Protestant writer of the 17th century, in one of his orations  describing the state of Christianity in the 4th century, says \"that it  was not so much the Empire that was brought over to the faith, as the  faith that was brought over to the Empire; not the Pagans who were  converted to Christianity, but the Christians who were converted to  Paganism.\" Thus, having shown that the Catholics derived all their  cardinal tenets from the Pagan mythology, the Protestants must surely  have obtained theirs from the Catholics, for they teach all of them  except that of Purgatory.        FREEMASONRY AND DRUIDISM.    The rites and ceremonies of Astral worship, under the name of Druidism,  were primarily observed in consecrated groves by all peoples; which  custom was retained by the Scandinavian and Germanic races, and by the  inhabitants of Gaul and the British Islands; while the East Indians,  Assyrians, Egyptians, Grecians, Romans, and other adjacent nations,  ultimately observed their religious services in temples; and we propose  to show that the modern societies of Freemasonry, and ancient order of  Druids, are but perpetuations of the grove and temple forms of the  ancient astrolatry. In determining the fact that Freemasonry finds its  prototype in the temple worship of ancient Egypt, we have but to study  the Masonic arms, as illustrated in Fellows' chart, in which are  pictured, as its objects of adoration, the sun and moon, the seven  stars, known as Pleiades in the sign of Taurus; the blazing star  Sirius, or Dog-star, worshipped by the Egyptians under the name of  Anubis, and whose rising forewarned those people of the rising of the  Nile River; the seven signs of the Zodiac from Aries to Libra,  inclusive, through which the sun was supposed to pass in making his  apparent annual revolution, and which constitutes the Royal arch from  which was derived the name of one of its higher degrees; and its  armorial bearings, consisting of pictures of the Lion, the Bull, the  Waterman, and the Flying Eagle, which representing the signs at the  cardinal points, constituted the genii of the seasons. Besides these,  we have the checkered flooring or mosaic work, representing the earth  and its variegated face, which was introduced when temple worship  succeeded its grove form; the two columns representing the imaginary  pillars of heaven resting upon the earth at Equinoctial points, and  supporting the Royal arch; also the letter \"G\" standing for Geometry,  the knowledge of which was of great importance to the natives of Egypt  in establishing the boundaries of their lands removed by the  inundations of the Nile, the square and compass, being the instruments  through which the old landmarks were restored, and which ultimately  became the symbols of justice. The cornucopia, or horn of plenty,  denoted the sun in the sign of Capricorn, and indicated the season when  the harvest was gathered and provisions laid up for Winter use; the  cenotaph or mock coffin with the sign of the cross upon its lid,  referred to the sun's crossing of the celestial equator at the Autumnal  Equinox, and to the figurative death of the genius of that luminary in  the lower hemisphere; whose resurrection at the Vernal Equinox is  typified by the sprig of acacia sprouting near the head of the coffin.  The serpent, issuing from the small vessel to the left, represented the  symbol of the Lord of Evil under whose dominion was placed the seasons  of Autumn and Winter; and the figure of a box at the right hand,  represented the sacred ark in which, anciently, the symbols of solar  worship were deposited; but which is now used by the masons as a  receptacle for their papers.    [See plate9.gif]    After, the promulgation, in the fifth century, of the edict by one of  the Emperors of Rome, decreeing the death penalty against all persons  discovered practicing any of the rites and ceremonies of the ancient  religion, a body of its cultured adherents, determining to observe them  secretly, banded themselves together into a society for that purpose.  With the view to masking their real object, they took advantage of the  fact that the square and compass, the plumbline, etc., were symbols of  speculative masonry in the temple form of Astral worship, they publicly  claimed to be only a trades-union for the prosecution of the arts of  architecture and operative masonry; but, among themselves, were known  as Free and Accepted Masons or Freemasons. In imitation of the ancient  mysteries they instituted lower and higher degrees; in the former they  taught the Exoteric creed, and in the latter the Esoteric philosophy,  as explained in our introduction. Inculcating supreme adoration to the  solar divinity the candidates for initiation were made to personate  that mythical being and subjected to the ceremonies representing his  figurative death and resurrection, were required to take fearful oaths  not to reveal the secrets of the order. To enable them to recognize  each other, and to render aid to a brother in emergencies, they adopted  a system of grips, signs and calls; and to guard against the intrusion  of their Christian enemies they stationed watchmen outside of their  lodges to give timely warning of their approach. Thus was instituted  the original Grand Lodge of Freemasonry, from which charters were  issued for the organization of subordinate lodges in all the principal  cities throughout the Roman Empire.    Becoming cognizant of the true object of Freemasonry, the Hierarchy of  the Church of Rome resolved to suppress the order, and to that end  maintained such a strict espionage upon its members that, no longer  able to assemble in their lodges, they determined to defend themselves  by an appeal to arms, and gathering together in strongholds, for a long  time successfully resisted the armies of the church; but ultimately,  being almost exterminated, the residue disbanded, and we hear no more  of Freemasonry, as a secret order, until the conclusion of the Dark  Ages, when the Reformation, making it possible, a form of the order,  recognizing Christianity, was revived among the Protestants; but the  Church of Rome, true to her traditions, has never ceased to hurl  anathemas against it and all other secret societies outside of her own  body. Thus, having made it apparent that Freemasonry, as primarily  instituted, was but a perpetuation of the temple form of Astral  worship, we can readily see that, while some of its symbols are as old  as the ancient Egyptian religion, it did not, as a secret order, take  its rise until Christian persecution made it necessary. Hence it cannot  justly lay claim to a greater antiquity than the fifth century of the  Christian era.    According to Masonic annals a Grand Lodge was organized at York,  England, early in the tenth century, but, like the lodges of Southern  Europe, was suppressed by the Church of Rome. In 1717 a Grand Lodge was  organized at London, England, and soon afterwards the old Grand Lodge  at York was revived, and its members took the name of Free and Accepted  Ancient York Masons, from which emanated the charter of the Grand Lodge  in the United States, which was organized in Boston in 1733. In 1813  the rivalry between the Grand Lodges of York and London was  compromised, and the supremacy of the former was conceded.    From church history we learn that in the year 596 of our era Pope  Gregory I. dispatched Augustin, and forty other monks of the order of  St. Andrew, from Rome to Britain, to convert the natives to  Christianity; but, while the Anglo-Saxons embraced the new faith, the  Britons rejected it, and, being persecuted by the Christians, retired  to the fastnesses of the country known as Wales, where, for a long  period, they maintained the observance of the Druidical form of  worship; and although that country has long since become Christianized,  the society of the Ancient Order of Druids has existed with an  uninterrupted succession at Pout-y-prid, where the Arch-Druid resides,  and from, whence emanated the charter of the Grand Lodge of the order  in this country. In reference to the Druidism on the continent, history  records the fact that when one of the reigning kings became a convert  to Christianity the whole of his subjects were baptized into the Church  of Rome by Imperial decree.        THE SABBATH.    In determining the origin of the seventh day Sabbath, we must of  necessity refer to that source of all religious ordinances, the ancient  astrolatry, the founders of which, having taught that God Sol was  engaged in the reorganization of Chaos during the first six periods of  the twelve thousand year cycle, corresponding to the months of Spring  and Summer, they conceived the idea that he ceased to exert his  energies, or rested from his labors on the seventh period,  corresponding to the first of the Autumn months. Hence, deriving the  suggestion from the apparent septenary rest in nature, they taught that  God ordained the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath or rest day for  man.    In conformity to this ordinance the founders of ancient Judaism  enforced the observance of the seventh day Sabbath in the fourth  commandment of the Decalogue, which, found in Gen. xx. 8-11,[1] reads  as follows, viz: \"Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days  shalt thou labor and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the  Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou,  nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man"]]]
