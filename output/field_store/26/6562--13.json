At daybreak, the intelligence having been confirmed by the  scouts, he sent forward his cavalry to harass their rear; and gave the  command of it to two of his lieutenants, Q. Pedius, and L. Aurunculeius  Cotta. He ordered T. Labienus, another of his lieutenants, to follow  them closely with three legions. These, attacking their rear, and  pursuing them for many miles, slew a great number of them as they were  fleeing; while those in the rear with whom they had come up, halted, and  bravely sustained the attack of our soldiers; the van, because they  appeared to be removed from danger, and were not restrained by any  necessity or command, as soon as the noise was heard, broke their ranks,  and, to a man, rested their safety in flight. Thus without any risk [to  themselves] our men killed as great a number of them as the length of  the day allowed; and at sunset desisted from the pursuit, and betook  themselves into the camp, as they had been commanded.    XII.--On the day following, before the enemy could recover from their  terror and flight, Caesar led his army into the territories of the  Suessiones, which are next to the Remi, and having accomplished a long  march, hastens to the town named Noviodunum. Having attempted to take it  by storm on his march, because he heard that it was destitute of  [sufficient] defenders, he was not able to carry it by assault, on  account of the breadth of the ditch and the height of the wall, though  few were defending it. Therefore, having fortified the camp, he began to  bring up the vineae, and to provide whatever things were necessary for  the storm. In the meantime, the whole body of the Suessiones, after  their flight, came the next night into the town. The vineae having been  quickly brought up against the town, a mound thrown up, and towers  built, the Gauls, amazed by the greatness of the works, such as they had  neither seen nor heard of before, and struck, also, by the despatch of  the Romans, send ambassadors to Caesar respecting a surrender, and  succeed in consequence of the Remi requesting that they [the Suessiones]  might be spared.    XIII.--Caesar, having received as hostages the first men of the state,  and even the two sons of king Galba himself; and all the arms in the  town having been delivered up, admitted the Suessiones to a surrender,  and led his army against the Bellovaci. Who, when they had conveyed  themselves and all their possessions into the town called Bratuspantium,  and Caesar with his army was about five miles distant from that town,  all the old men, going out of the town, began to stretch out their hands  to Caesar, and to intimate by their voice that they would throw  themselves on his protection and power, nor would contend in arms  against the Roman people. In like manner, when he had come up to the  town, and there pitched his camp, the boys and the women from the wall,  with outstretched hands, after their custom, begged peace from the  Romans.    XIV.--For these Divitiacus pleads (for after the departure of the  Belgae, having dismissed the troops of the Aedui, he had returned to  Caesar). \"The Bellovaci had at all times been in the alliance and  friendship of the Aeduan state; that they had revolted from the Aedui  and made war upon the Roman people, being urged thereto by their nobles,  who said that the Aedui, reduced to slavery by Caesar, were suffering  every indignity and insult. That they who had been the leaders of that  plot, because they perceived how great a calamity they had brought upon  the state, had fled into Britain. That not only the Bellovaci, but also  the Aedui, entreated him to use his [accustomed] clemency and lenity  towards them [the Bellovaci]: which if he did, he would increase the  influence of the Aedui among all the Belgae, by whose succour and  resources they had been accustomed to support themselves whenever any  wars occurred.\"    XV.--Caesar said that on account of his respect for Divitiacus and the  Aeduans, he would receive them into his protection, and would spare  them; but, because the state was of great influence among the Belgae,  and pre-eminent in the number of its population, he demanded 600  hostages. When these were delivered, and all the arms in the town  collected, he went from that place into the territories of the Ambiani,  who, without delay, surrendered themselves and all their possessions.  Upon their territories bordered the Nervii, concerning whose character  and customs when Caesar inquired he received the following information:  --That \"there was no access for merchants to them; that they suffered no  wine and other things tending to luxury to be imported; because they  thought that by their use the mind is enervated and the courage  impaired: that they were a savage people and of great bravery: that they  upbraided and condemned the rest of the Belgae who had surrendered  themselves to the Roman people and thrown aside their national courage:  that they openly declared they would neither send ambassadors, nor  accept any condition of peace.\"    XVI.--After he had made three days' march through their territories, he  discovered from some prisoners, that the river Sambre was not more than  ten miles from his camp: that all the Nervii had stationed themselves on  the other side of that river, and together with the Atrebates and the  Veromandui, their neighbours, were there awaiting the arrival of the  Romans; for they had persuaded both these nations to try the same  fortune of war [as themselves]: that the forces of the Aduatuci were  also expected by them, and were on their march; that they had put their  women, and those who through age appeared useless for war, in a place to  which there was no approach for an army, on account of the marshes.    XVII.--Having learnt these things, he sends forward scouts and  centurions to choose a convenient place for the camp. And as a great  many of the surrounding Belgae and other Gauls, following Caesar,  marched with him; some of these, as was afterwards learnt from the  prisoners, having accurately observed, during those days, the army's  method of marching, went by night to the Nervii, and informed them that  a great number of baggage-trains passed between the several legions, and  that there would be no difficulty, when the first legion had come into  the camp, and the other legions were at a great distance, to attack that  legion while under baggage, which being routed, and the baggage-train  seized, it would come to pass that the other legions would not dare to  stand their ground. It added weight also to the advice of those who  reported that circumstance, that the Nervii, from early times, because  they were weak in cavalry (for not even at this time do they attend to  it, but accomplish by their infantry whatever they can), in order that  they might the more easily obstruct the cavalry of their neighbours if  they came upon them for the purpose of plundering, having cut young  trees, and bent them, by means of their numerous branches [extending] on  to the sides, and the quick-briars and thorns springing up between them,  had made these hedges present a fortification like a wall, through which  it was not only impossible to enter, but even to penetrate with the eye.  Since [therefore] the march of our army would be obstructed by these  things, the Nervii thought that the advice ought not to be neglected by  them.    XVIII.--The nature of the ground which our men had chosen for the camp  was this: A hill, declining evenly from the top, extended to the river  Sambre, which we have mentioned above: from this river there arose a  [second] hill of like ascent, on the other side and opposite to the  former, and open from about 200 paces at the lowest part; but in the  upper part, woody, (so much so) that it was not easy to see through it  into the interior. Within those woods the enemy kept themselves in  concealment; a few troops of horse-soldiers appeared on the open ground,  along the river. The depth of the river was about three feet.    XIX.--Caesar, having sent his cavalry on before, followed close after  them with all his forces; but the plan and order of the march was  different from that which the Belgae had reported to the Nervii. For as  he was approaching the enemy Caesar, according to his custom, led on [as  the van] six legions unencumbered by baggage; behind them he had placed  the baggage-trains of the whole army; then the two legions which had  been last raised closed the rear, and were a guard for the baggage-train.  Our horse, with the slingers and archers, having passed the river,  commenced action with the cavalry of the enemy. While they from  time to time betook themselves into the woods to their companions, and  again made an assault out of the wood upon our men, who did not dare to  follow them in their retreat further than the limit to which the plain  and open parts extended, in the meantime the six legions which had  arrived first, having measured out the work, began to fortify the camp.  When the first part of the baggage-train of our army was seen by those  who lay hid in the woods, which had been agreed on among them as the  time for commencing action, as soon as they had arranged their line of  battle and formed their ranks within the woods, and had encouraged one  another, they rushed out suddenly with all their forces and made an  attack upon our horse. The latter being easily routed and thrown into  confusion, the Nervii ran down to the river with such incredible speed  that they seemed to be in the woods, the river, and close upon us almost  at the same time. And with the same speed they hastened up the hill to  our camp and to those who were employed in the works.    XX.--Caesar had everything to do at one time: the standard to be  displayed, which was the sign when it was necessary to run to arms; the  signal to be given by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10661"],[0,"A Selection from the Discourses of Epictetus with the Encheiridion (#14)"],[1," that I  may see the man whom I have long been looking for, who is truly noble  and ingenuous, whether young or old; name him.    What then are the things which are heavy on us and disturb us? What else  than opinions? What else than opinions lies heavy upon him who goes away  and leaves his companions and friends and places and habits of life? Now  little children, for instance, when they cry on the nurse leaving them  for a short time, forget their sorrow if they receive a small cake. Do  you choose then that we should compare you to little children? No, by  Zeus, for I do not wish to be pacified by a small cake, but by right  opinions. And what are these? Such as a man ought to study all day, and  not to be affected by anything that is not his own, neither by companion  nor place nor gymnasia, and not even by his own body, but to remember  the law and to have it before his eyes. And what is the divine law? To  keep a man's own, not to claim that which belongs to others, but to use  what is given, and when it is not given, not to desire it; and when a  thing is taken away, to give it up readily and immediately, and to be  thankful for the time that a man has had the use of it, if you would not  cry for your nurse and mamma. For what matter does it make by what thing  a man is subdued, and on what he depends? In what respect are you better  than he who cries for a girl, if you grieve for a little gymnasium, and  little porticos, and young men, and such places of amusement? Another  comes and laments that he shall no longer drink the water of Dirce. Is  the Marcian water worse than that of Dirce? But I was used to the water  of Dirce. And you in turn will be used to the other. Then if you become  attached to this also, cry for this too, and try to make a verse like  the verse of Euripides,      The hot baths of Nero and the Marcian water.    See how tragedy is made when common things happen to silly men.    When then shall I see Athens again and the Acropolis? Wretch, are you  not content with what you see daily? Have you anything better or greater  to see than the sun, the moon, the stars, the whole earth, the sea? But  if indeed you comprehend Him who administers the whole, and carry him  about in yourself, do you still desire small stones and a beautiful  rock?           *       *       *       *       *    HOW WE MUST ADAPT PRECONCEPTIONS TO PARTICULAR CASES.--What is the first  business of him who philosophizes? To throw away self-conceit ([Greek:  oiaesis]). For it is impossible for a man to begin to learn that which  he thinks that he knows. As to things then which ought to be done and  ought not to be done, and good and bad, and beautiful and ugly, all of  us talking of them at random go to the philosophers; and on these  matters we praise, we censure, we accuse, we blame, we judge and  determine about principles honorable and dishonorable. But why do we go  to the philosophers? Because we wish to learn what we do not think that  we know. And what is this? Theorems. For we wish to learn what  philosophers say as being something elegant and acute; and some wish to  learn that they may get profit from what they learn. It is ridiculous  then to think that a person wishes to learn one thing, and will learn  another; or further, that a man will make proficiency in that which he  does not learn. But the many are deceived by this which deceived also  the rhetorician Theopompus, when he blames even Plato for wishing  everything to be defined. For what does he say? Did none of us before  you use the words good or just, or do we utter the sounds in an  unmeaning and empty way without understanding what they severally  signify? Now who tells you, Theopompus, that we had not natural notions  of each of these things and preconceptions ([Greek: prolaepseis])? But  it is not possible to adapt preconceptions to their correspondent  objects if we have not distinguished (analyzed) them, and inquired what  object must be subjected to each preconception. You may make the same  charge against physicians also. For who among us did not use the words  healthy and unhealthy before Hippocrates lived, or did we utter these  words as empty sounds? For we have also a certain preconception of  health, but we are not able to adapt it. For this reason one says,  Abstain from food; another says, Give food; another says, Bleed; and  another says, Use cupping. What is the reason? is it any other than that  a man cannot properly adapt the preconceptions of health to particulars?           *       *       *       *       *    HOW WE SHOULD STRUGGLE AGAINST APPEARANCES.--Every habit and faculty is  maintained and increased by the corresponding actions: the habit of  walking by walking, the habit of running by running. If you would be a  good reader, read; if a writer, write. But when you shall not have read  for thirty days in succession, but have done something else, you will  know the consequence. In the same way, if you shall have lain down ten  days, get up and attempt to make a long walk, and you will see how your  legs are weakened. Generally then if you would make anything a habit, do  it; if you would not make it a habit, do not do it, but accustom  yourself to do something else in place of it.    So it is with respect to the affections of the soul: when you have been  angry, you must know that not only has this evil befallen you, but that  you have also increased the habit, and in a manner thrown fuel upon  fire.    In this manner certainly, as philosophers say, also diseases of the mind  grow up. For when you have once desired money, if reason be applied to  lead to a perception of the evil, the desire is stopped, and the ruling  faculty of our mind is restored to the original authority. But if you  apply no means of cure, it no longer returns to the same state, but  being again excited by the corresponding appearance, it is inflamed to  desire quicker than before: and when this takes place continually, it is  henceforth hardened (made callous), and the disease of the mind confirms  the love of money. For he who has had a fever, and has been relieved  from it, is not in the same state that he was before, unless he has been  completely cured. Something of the kind happens also in diseases of the  soul. Certain traces and blisters are left in it, and unless a man shall  completely efface them, when he is again lashed on the same places, the  lash will produce not blisters (weals) but sores. If then you wish not  to be of an angry temper, do not feed the habit: throw nothing on it  which will increase it: at first keep quiet, and count the days on which  you have not been angry. I used to be in passion every day; now every  second day; then every third, then every fourth. But if you have  intermitted thirty days, make a sacrifice to God. For the habit at first  begins to be weakened, and then is completely destroyed. \"I have not  been vexed to-day, nor the day after, nor yet on any succeeding day  during two or three months; but I took care when some exciting things  happened.\" Be assured that you are in a good way.    How then shall this be done? Be willing at length to be approved by  yourself, be willing to appear beautiful to God, desire to be in purity  with your own pure self and with God. Then when any such appearance  visits you, Plato says, Have recourse to expiations, go a suppliant to  the temples of the averting deities. It is even sufficient if you resort  to the society of noble and just men, and compare yourself with them,  whether you find one who is living or dead.    But in the first place, be not hurried away by the rapidity of the  appearance, but say, Appearances, wait for me a little; let me see who  you are, and what you are about; let me put you to the test. And then do  not allow the appearance to lead you on and draw lively pictures of the  things which will follow; for if you do, it will carry you off wherever  it pleases. But rather bring in to oppose it some other beautiful and  noble appearance, and cast out this base appearance. And if you are  accustomed to be exercised in this way, you will see what shoulders,  what sinews, what strength you have. But now it is only trifling words,  and nothing more.    This is the true athlete, the man who exercises himself against such  appearances. Stay, wretch, do not be carried away. Great is the combat,  divine is the work; it is for kingship, for freedom, for happiness, for  freedom from perturbation. Remember God; call on him as a helper and  protector, as men at sea call on the Dioscuri in a storm. For what is a  greater storm than that which comes from appearances which are violent  and drive away the reason? For the storm itself, what else is it but an  appearance? For take away the fear of death, and suppose as many  thunders and lightnings as you please, and you will know what calm and  serenity there is in the ruling faculty. But if you have once been  defeated and say that you will conquer hereafter, and then say the same  again, be assured that you will at last be in so wretched a condition  and so weak that you will not even know afterwards that you are doing  wrong, but you will even begin to make apologies (defences) for your  wrong-doing, and then you will confirm the saying of Hesiod to be true,      With constant ills the dilatory strives.           *       *       *       *       *    OF INCONSISTENCY.--Some things men readily confess, and other things  they do not. No one then will confess that he is a fool or without  understanding; but quite the contrary you will hear all men saying, I  wish that I had fortune equal to my understanding. But men readily  confess that they are timid, and they say: I am rather timid, I confess;  but as to other respects you will not find me to be foolish. A man will  not readily confess that he is intemperate; and that he is unjust, he  will not confess at all. He will by no means confess that he is envious"]]]
