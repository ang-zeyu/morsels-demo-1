Thanks to an excellent raw material endowment, a  technically skilled labor force, and strong links with West German  industrial firms, Austria has successfully occupied specialized niches  in European industry and services (tourism, banking) and produces almost  enough food to feed itself with only 8% of the labor force in  agriculture.  Living standards are roughly comparable with the large  industrial countries of Western Europe.  Problems for the l990s include  an aging population and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within  budget capabilities.

So he had  changed his name, and come West, hoping to return in a few years to his  family a rich man. All this Anne had believed, and had not repeated  until now.    All New Salem joined in declaring McNamar an impostor and his story a  fabrication. \"Who knew how many wives he had?\" they said. With one  accord Anne's friends denounced him; and although his story turned out  afterward to be not altogether false, it is small wonder that Anne  herself at last came to believe that either he was dead or had ceased to  love her.    While matters were in this state, Lincoln ventured to show his love for  Anne. It was a long time before she would listen; but, convinced at last  that her former lover had deserted her, she promised, in the spring of  1835, to become his wife. But Lincoln had nothing on which to support a  family,--in fact, could hardly support himself. Besides, Anne was  anxious to go to school another year. So it was decided that she should  spend the winter in an academy in Jacksonville, while Lincoln devoted  himself to the study of the law. Then, when she should return from  school, he would be a member of the bar and they could be married.    A happy spring and summer followed. All their friends took an interest  in the lovers, and their prospects seemed bright. But Anne's health  began to fail. She could not rid herself of her haunting memories. There  was a possibility that she had wronged McNamar. What if he should love  her still, and should return and find her wedded to another? Had she  wronged both men? In her thoughts was perpetual conflict. The old love  still persisted. Her conscience troubled her. She doubted, and was  morbidly melancholy. All this wore upon her; she fell ill. At last her  condition became grave, then hopeless. Lincoln was sent for. Anne's last  hour was passed alone with him. She died at sunset, August 25, 1835. An  old neighbor who saw Lincoln just after his parting with the dying girl  says: \"There were signs of the most terrible distress in his face. His  grief became frantic. He lost all self-control, even the consciousness  of his own identity; and his closest friends in New Salem pronounced him  insane, crazy, mad. They watched him with especial vigilance on dark and  stormy days. At such times he raved piteously, often saying, 'I can  never be reconciled to having the snow fall and the rain beat upon her  grave.'\" His old friend, Bowlin Greene, alone seemed possessed of the  power to quiet him. He took him to his own home and kept him for several  weeks, an object of undisguised solicitude. At last it seemed safe to  permit him to return to his old haunts. Greene urged him to go back to  the law; and he did so, but he was never the same man again. He was  thin, haggard, and careworn. He was as one who had been at the brink of  the grave. A long time afterward, when the grass had for nearly thirty  years grown over the grave of Anne Rutledge, Lincoln was one day  introduced to a man named Rutledge in the White House. He looked at him  a moment, then grasped his hand and said with deep feeling: \"I love the  name of Rutledge to this day. Anne was a lovely girl. She was natural,  well-educated. She would have made a good, loving wife. I did honestly  and truly love her, and I think often, often of her now.\" Mr. Herndon  has said that the love and the death of this young girl shattered  Lincoln's purposes and tendencies. \"He threw off his infinite sorrow  only by leaping wildly into the political arena. He needed whip and spur  to save him from despair.\"    The period of Abraham Lincoln's boyhood and youth had closed when he  stood by the grave of Anne Rutledge. He had long been a man in stature.  He was now a man in years; yet the rough path he had been forced to  travel had made his progress toward maturity painfully slow. In spite  of his low birth, of his dire poverty, of the rudeness and illiteracy of  his associates, of the absence of refinement in his surroundings, of his  scanty means of education, of his homely figure and awkward manners, of  his coarse fare and shabby dress, he dared to believe there was an  exalted career in store for him. He hewed out the foundations for it  with indomitable spirit. It was to be grounded on manly virtues. It  seems as though the boy felt the consecration of a high destiny from the  very dawn of his intelligence, and it set him apart, secure amid the  temptations and safe from the vices that corrupt many men. In the rough  garb of the backwoodsman he preserved the instincts of a gentleman. He  was the companion of bullies and boors. He shared their work and their  sports, but he never stooped to their vulgarity. He very seldom drank  with them, and they never heard him speak an oath. He could throw the  stoutest in a wrestling match, and was ready, when brought to it, to  whip any insolent braggart who made cruel use of his strength. He never  flinched from hardship or danger, yet his heart was as soft and tender  as a woman's. The great gentle giant had a feeling of sympathy for every  living creature. He was not ashamed to rock a cradle, or to carry a pail  of water or an armful of wood to spare a tired woman's arms. Though  destitute of worldly goods, he was rich in friends. All the people of  his acquaintance knew they could count on his doing the right thing  always, so far as he was able. Hence they trusted and loved him; and the  title of \"Honest Abe,\" which he bore through life, was a seal of  knighthood rarer and prouder than any king or queen could confer with  the sword. Abraham Lincoln was one of nature's noblemen. He showed  himself a hero in every circumstance of his boyhood and youth. The  elements of greatness were visible even then. The boy who was true to  duty, patient in privation, modest in merit, kind to every form of  distress, determined to rise by wresting opportunities from the  grudging hand of fate, was sure to make a man distinguished among his  fellows,--a man noted among the great men of the world, as the boy had  been among his neighbors in the wilds of Spencer County and New Salem.    The site of the town where Lincoln spent the last three years of the  period covered in this portion of his biography is now a desolate waste.  A gentleman who visited the spot during the summer of 1885 thus  describes the mournful scene: \"From the hill where I sit, under the  shade of three trees whose branches make one, I look out over the  Sangamon river and its banks covered apparently with primeval forests.  Around are fields overgrown with weeds and stunted oaks. It was a town  of ten or twelve years only. It began in 1824 and ended in 1836. Yet in  that time it had a history which the world will not let die as long as  it venerates the memory of the noble liberator and martyr President,  Abraham Lincoln.\"          CHAPTER III           Lincoln's Beginning as a Lawyer--His Early Taste for       Politics--Lincoln and the Lightning-Rod Man--Not an       Aristocrat--Reply to Dr. Early--A Manly Letter--Again in the       Illinois Legislature--The \"Long Nine\"--Lincoln on His Way to the       Capital--His Ambition in 1836--First Meeting with Douglas--Removal       of the Illinois Capital--One of Lincoln's Early       Speeches--Pro-Slavery Sentiment in Illinois--Lincoln's Opposition       to Slavery--Contest with General Ewing--Lincoln Lays out a       Town--The Title \"Honest Abe.\"    Abraham Lincoln's career as a lawyer covered a period of a quarter of a  century, beginning about 1834 or '35, and ending with his election to  the Presidency, in November, 1860. When he began his professional life  he was an obscure and unpromising youth of twenty-five, with but little  learning and fewer accomplishments, and without advantages of social  influence or wealthy friends. Step by step, with patient industry and  unflinching determination, he climbed the ladder of professional  advancement until he stood among the foremost lawyers of the West. He  had, indeed, won a national reputation; and when he laid aside his law  books, a mature man of fifty, it was to enter upon the great honors and  responsibilities of the Presidency of the American Republic.    Lincoln was devoted to his profession, and his success in it was earned  by hard and constant application. But his natural taste for politics led  him to take a full share in the activities of political life. He had  already served a term in the Illinois Legislature (1834-35), and so well  satisfied were his constituents that they renominated him for the  succeeding term. In the canvass which followed he distinguished himself  as a stump-speaker; showing, by his tact and ability, by the skill and  ingenuity with which he met his opponents in debate, by his shrewdness  in attack and readiness in retort, how much he had profited by the  training of the previous years.    An incident illustrating his ready wit and his keen insight into human  nature occurred early in this campaign, at Springfield, where a public  discussion was held between the opposing candidates. An interesting  version of this incident is given by Mr. Arnold: \"There lived at this  time in the most pretentious house in Springfield a prominent citizen  named George Forquer. He had been long in public life, had been a  leading Whig--the party to which Lincoln belonged--but had lately gone  over to the Democrats, and had received from the Democratic  administration an appointment to the lucrative post of Register of the  Land Office at Springfield. Upon his handsome new house he had lately  placed a lightning-rod, the first one ever put up in Sangamon County. As  Lincoln was riding into town with his friends, they passed the fine  house of Forquer, and observed the novelty of the lightning-rod,  discussing the manner in which it protected the house from being struck  by lightning. In this discussion there were seven Whig and seven  Democratic candidates for the lower branch of the Legislature; "]]]
