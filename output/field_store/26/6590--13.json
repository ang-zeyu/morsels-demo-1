But stock  brickwork in mortar weighs just about one hundred weight per cubic foot,  or 20 cubic feet to the ton. In cement it is heavier, about 120 lb. to  the cubic foot.    The strength of brickwork depends of course on the strength of the  weakest material--i.e., the mortar--though when it is in cement the  strength of brickwork to withstand a weight probably approaches that of  the individual bricks. Some experiments quoted in Rivington's Notes give  the following as the crushing weight per foot--that is to say, weight at  which crushing began--of piers having a height of less than twelve times  their diameter:                                                 Tons per                                                 foot.    Best stocks, set in Portland cement and      sand 1 to 1, and three months old.          40    Ordinary good stocks, three months old.       30    Hard stocks, Roman cement and sand 1 to 1,      three months old.                           28    Hard stocks, lias lime, and sand 1 to 2,      and six months old.                         24    Hard stocks, gray chalk lime, and sand,      six months old.                             12    The rule given in popular handbook, that brickwork in mortar should not  have to carry more than three tons per superficial foot, and in cement  more than five tons, is probably sound, as in no building ought the load  to approach the crushing point, and, indeed, there are many sorts of  foundations on which such a load as five tons per foot would be too  great to be advisable.    It is a rather interesting inquiry, whenever we are dealing with a  building material, if we ask what can we best do with it, and for what  is it ill fitted. The purposes for which brick can be best used depend,  of course, upon its qualities. Speaking generally, such purposes are  very numerous and very various, especially the utilitarian purposes,  though rich and varied ornamental work can also be executed in  brickwork.    Perhaps the most remarkable quality of brickwork is that it can be  thrown into almost any shape. It is in this respect almost like a  plastic material, and this peculiarity it owes chiefly to the very small  size of each brick as compared with the large masses of the brickwork of  most buildings. Stone is far less easily dealt with than brick in this  respect. Think for a moment of the great variety of walls, footings,  piers, pilasters, openings, recesses, flues, chimney breasts, chimney  shafts, vaults, arches, domes, fireproof floors, corbels, strings,  cappings, panels, cornices, plinths, and other features met with in  constant use, and all formed by the bricklayer with little trouble out  of the one material--brickwork! A little consideration will convince you  that if the same material furnishes all these, it must be very plastic.  As a limitation we ought to note that this almost plastic material  cannot be suddenly and violently dealt with--that is to say, with the  exception of some sorts of arches, you cannot form any abrupt or  startling feature in brickwork, and you are especially limited as to  projections.    If you wish to throw out any bold projection, you may support it on a  long and sloping corbel of brickwork. But if there is not room for that,  you must call in some other material, and form the actual support in  stone, or terra cotta, or iron, and when you have gained your  projection, you may then go on in brickwork if you like.    Brick cornices should be steep, but cannot be bold, and so with other  ornamental and structural features. A noteworthy property of brickwork,  and one of immense value, is that it is thoroughly fireproof; in fact,  almost the only perfectly fireproof material. There is an interesting  account of the great fire of London by one of the eye witnesses, and  among the striking phenomena of that awful time he notes that the few  brick buildings which existed were the only ones able to withstand the  raging fire when it reached them.    In our own day a striking proof of the same thing was given in the great  fire in Tooley street, when Braidwood lost his life. I witnessed that  conflagration for a time from London Bridge, and its fury was something  not to be described. There were vaults under some of the warehouses  stored with inflammable materials, the contents of which caught fire and  burnt for a fortnight, defying all attempts to put them out. Yet these  very vaults, though they were blazing furnaces for all that time, were  not materially injured. When the warehouses came to be reinstated, it  was only found necessary to repair and repoint them a little, and they  were retained in use. The fact is that the bricks have been calcined  already, so has the lime in the mortar, and the sand is not affected by  heat, so there is nothing in brickwork to burn. Against each of these  good qualities, however, we may set a corresponding defect.    If brickwork is easily thrown into any shape, it is also easily thrown  out of shape. It has little coherence or stability, less than masonry  and very considerably less than timber. If any unequal settlement in the  foundation of a brick building occurs, those long zigzag cracks with  which we in London are only too familiar set themselves up at once; and  if any undue load, or any variation in load, exists, the brickwork  begins to bulge. Any serious shock may cause a building of ordinary  brickwork to collapse altogether, and from time to time a formidable  accident occurs owing to this cause. The fact is, the bricks are each so  small compared to the mass of the work, and the tenacity or hold upon  them of even fairly good lime mortar is so comparatively slight, that  there is really but little grip of one put upon another.    Persons who have to design and construct brick buildings should never  forget that they have to be handled with caution, and are really very  ticklish and unstable. One or two of the methods of overcoming this to  some extent may be mentioned. The first is the introduction of what is  called bond. At the end of the last century it was usual to build in, at  every few feet in height, bond timbers, which were embedded in the heart  of the walls. If these had always remained indestructible, they would no  doubt have served their purpose to some extent. Unfortunately, timber  both rots and burns, and this bond timber has brought down many a wall  owing to its being destroyed by fire, and has in other cases decayed  away, and caused cracks, settlements, and failures.    The more modern method of introducing a strong horizontal tie is to  build into the wall a group of bands of thin iron, such as some sorts of  barrels are hooped with--hence called hoop iron. The courses of bricks  where this occurs must be laid in cement, because iron in contact with  cement does not perish as it does in contact with mortar.    If in every story of a building four or five courses are thus laid and  fortified, a great deal of strength is given to the structure. Another  method, which has rather fallen into disuse, is grouting. This is  pouring liquid mortar, about the consistency of gruel, upon the work at  about every fourth course. The result is to fill up all interstices and  cavities, and to delay the drying of the mortar, and brickwork so  treated sets extremely hard. I have seen a wall that had been so treated  cut into, and it was quite as easy to cut the bricks (sound ones though  they were) as the mortar joints.    Grouting is objected to because it interferes with the good look of the  work, as it is very difficult to prevent streaks of it from running down  the face, and it is apt to delay the work. But it is a valuable means of  obtaining strong brickwork. Another and a more popular method is to  build the work in cement, now usually Portland cement. This, of course,  makes very strong, sound work, and does not involve any delay or dirt  like grouting, or the introduction of any fresh material like hoop iron.  But it, of course, adds to the expense of the work considerably, as  cement is much more costly than lime. I ought to add that the advocates  of Scott's selenitic mortar claim that it not only sets quickly and  hard, but that it is extremely tenacious, and consequently makes a much  more robust wall than ordinary mortar. I dare say this is true; but I  have not happened to see such a wall cut into, and this is the best test  of solidity.    The second deficiency in brickwork which I am bound to notice is that,  though it is very fireproof, it is far from being waterproof. In an  exposed situation rain will drive completely through a tolerably stout  brick wall. If water be allowed to drop or fall against it, the wall  will become saturated like a sponge. If the foot of a wall becomes wet,  or if the earth resting against the lower parts of it be moist, water  will, if not checked, rise to a great height in it, and if the upper  part of the wall be wet, the water will sink downward. With most sorts  of brick the outer face absorbs moisture whenever the weather is moist;  and in time the action of the rain, and the subsequent action of frost  upon the moisture so taken up, destroys the mortar in the joints, which  are to be seen perfectly open, as if they had been raked out, in old  brickwork, and in some cases (happily not in many) the action of weather  destroys the bricks themselves, the face decaying away, and the brick  becoming soft.    Against this serious defect in our staple building material a series of  precautions have been devised. Damp rising from the foot of the wall, or  from earth lying round its base, is combated by a damp course--a bed of  some impervious material going through the wall. Damp earth may be kept  off by surrounding the walls with an open area or a closed one--usually  termed a dry area.

So whenas Fafnir had his death-wound, he asked \"Who art thou? And who is  thy father? And what thy kin, that thou wert so hardy as to bear weapons  against me?\"    Sigurd answered, \"Unknown to men is my kin. I am called a noble beast:  (2) neither father have I nor mother, and all alone have I fared  hither.\"    Said Fafnir, \"Whereas thou hast neither father nor mother, of what  wonder wert thou born then? But now, though thou tellest me not thy name  on this my death-day, yet thou knowest verily that thou liest unto me.\"    He answered, \"Sigurd am I called, and my father was Sigmund.\"    Says Fafnir, \"Who egged thee on to this deed, and why wouldst thou be  driven to it? Hadst thou never heard how that all folk were adrad of  me, and of the awe of my countenance? But an eager father thou hadst, O  bright eyed swain!\"    Sigurd answered, \"A hardy heart urged me on hereto; and a strong hand  and this sharp sword, which well thou knowest now, stood me in stead in  the doing of the deed; 'Seldom hath hardy eld a faint-heart youth.'\"    Fafnir said, \"Well, I wot that hadst thou waxed amid thy kin, thou  mightest have good skill to slay folk in thine anger; but more of a  marvel is it, that thou, a bondsman taken in war, shouldst have the  heart to set on me, 'for few among bondsmen have heart for the fight.'\"    Said Sigurd, \"Wilt thou then cast it in my teeth that I am far away from  my kin? Albeit I was a bondsman, yet was I never shackled. God wot thou  hast found me free enow.\"    Fafnir answered, \"In angry wise dost thou take my speech; but hearken,  for that same gold which I have owned shall be thy bane too.\"    Quoth Sigurd, \"Fain would we keep all our wealth til that day of days;  yet shall each man die once for all.\"    Said Fafnir, \"Few things wilt thou do after my counsel; but take heed  that thou shalt be drowned if thou farest unwarily over the sea; so bide  thou rather on the dry land, for the coming of the calm tide.\"    Then said Sigurd, \"Speak, Fafnir, and say, if thou art so exceeding  wise, who are the Norns who rule the lot of all mothers' sons.\"    Fafnir answers, \"Many there be and wide apart; for some are of the kin  of the Aesir, and some are of Elfin kin, and some there are who are  daughters of Dvalin.\"    Said Sigurd, \"How namest thou the holm whereon Surt (3) and the Aesir  mix and mingle the water of the sword?\"    \"Unshapen is that holm hight,\" said Fafnir.    And yet again he said, \"Regin, my brother, has brought about my end,  and it gladdens my heart that thine too he bringeth about; for thus will  things be according to his will.\"    And once again he spake, \"A countenance of terror I bore up before all  folk, after that I brooded over the heritage of my brother, and on every  side did I spout out poison, so that none durst come anigh me, and of  no weapon was I adrad, nor ever had I so many men before me, as that  I deemed myself not stronger than all; for all men were sore afeard of  me.\"    Sigurd answered and said, \"Few may have victory by means of that same  countenance of terror, for whoso comes amongst many shall one day find  that no one man is by so far the mightiest of all.\"    Then says Fafnir, \"Such counsel I give thee, that thou take thy horse  and ride away at thy speediest, for ofttimes it falls out so, that he  who gets a death-wound avenges himself none the less.\"    Sigurd answered, \"Such as thy redes are I will nowise do after them;  nay, I will ride now to thy lair and take to me that great treasure of  thy kin.\"    \"Ride there then,\" said Fafnir, \"and thou shalt find gold enow to  suffice thee for all thy life-days; yet shall that gold be thy bane, and  the bane of every one soever who owns it.\"    Then up stood Sigurd, and said, \"Home would I ride and lose all that  wealth, if I deemed that by the losing thereof I should never die; but  every brave and true man will fain have his hand on wealth till that  last day; but thou, Fafnir, wallow in the death-pain till Death and Hell  have thee.\"    And therewithal Fafnir died.

Thereafter came Regin to Sigurd, and said, \"Hail, lord and master, a  noble victory hast thou won in the slaying of Fafnir, whereas none durst  heretofore abide in the path of him; and now shall this deed of fame be  of renown while the world stands fast.\"    Then stood Regin staring on the earth a long while, and presently  thereafter spake from heavy mood: \"Mine own brother hast thou slain, and  scarce may I be called sackless of the deed.\"    Then Sigurd took his sword Gram and dried it on the earth, and spake to  Regin--    \"Afar thou faredst when I wrought this deed and tried this sharp sword  with the hand and the might of me; with all the might and main of a  dragon must I strive, while thou wert laid alow in the heather-bush,  wotting not if it were earth or heaven.\"    Said Regin, \"Long might this worm have lain in his lair, if the sharp  sword I forged with my hand had not been good at need to thee; had that  not been, neither thou nor any man would have prevailed against him as  at this time.\"    Sigurd answers, \"Whenas men meet foes in fight, better is stout heart  than sharp sword.\"    Then said Regin, exceeding heavily, \"Thou hast slain my brother, and  scarce may I be sackless of the deed.\"    Therewith Sigurd cut out the heart of the worm with the sword called  Ridil; but Regin drank of Fafnir's blood, and spake, \"Grant me a boon,  and do a thing little for thee to do. Bear the heart to the fire, and  roast it, and give me thereof to eat.\"    Then Sigurd went his ways and roasted it on a rod; and when the blood  bubbled out he laid his finger thereon to essay it, if it were fully  done; and then he set his finger in his mouth, and lo, when the  heart-blood of the worm touched his tongue, straightway he knew the  voice of all fowls, and heard withal how the wood-peckers chattered in  the brake beside him--    \"There sittest thou, Sigurd, roasting Fafnir's heart for another, that  thou shouldest eat thine ownself, and then thou shouldest become the  wisest of all men.\"    And another spake: \"There lies Regin, minded to beguile the man who  trusts in him.\"    But yet again said the third, \"Let him smite the head from off him then,  and be only lord of all that gold.\"    And once more the fourth spake and said, \"Ah, the wiser were he if he  followed after that good counsel, and rode thereafter to Fafnir's lair,  and took to him that mighty treasure that lieth there, and then rode  over Hindfell, whereas sleeps Brynhild; for there would he get great  wisdom. Ah, wise he were, if he did after your redes, and bethought him  of his own weal; 'for where wolf's ears are, wolf's teeth are near.'\"    Then cried the fifth: \"Yea, yea, not so wise is he as I deem him, if he  spareth him, whose brother he hath slain already.\"    At last spake the sixth: \"Handy and good rede to slay him, and be lord  of the treasure!\"    Then said Sigurd, \"The time is unborn wherein Regin shall be my bane;  nay, rather one road shall both these brothers fare.\"    And therewith he drew his sword Gram and struck off Regin's head.    Then heard Sigurd the wood-peckers a-singing, even as the song says. (1)    For the first sang:         \"Bind thou, Sigurd,       The bright red rings!       Not meet it is       Many things to fear.       A fair may know I,       Fair of all the fairest       Girt about with gold,       Good for thy getting.\"    And the second:         \"Green go the ways       Toward the hall of Giuki       That the fates show forth       To those who fare thither;       There the rich king       Reareth a daughter;       Thou shalt deal, Sigurd,       With gold for thy sweetling.\"    And the third:         \"A high hall is there       Reared upon Hindfell,       Without all around it       Sweeps the red flame aloft.       Wise men wrought       That wonder of halls       With the unhidden gleam       Of the glory of gold.\"    Then the fourth sang:         \"Soft on the fell       A shield-may sleepeth       The lime-trees' red plague       Playing about her:       The sleep-thorn set Odin       Into that maiden       For her choosing in war       The one he willed not.         \"Go, son, behold       That may under helm       Whom from battle       Vinskornir bore,       From her may not turn       The torment of sleep.       Dear offspring of kings       In the dread Norns' despite.\"    Then Sigurd ate some deal of Fafnir's heart, and the remnant he kept.  Then he leapt on his horse and rode along the trail of the worm Fafnir,  and so right unto his abiding-place; and he found it open, and beheld  all the doors and the gear of them that they were wrought of iron: yea,  and all the beams of the house; and it was dug down deep into the earth:  there found Sigurd gold exceeding plenteous, and the sword Rotti; and  thence he took the Helm of Awe, and the Gold Byrny, and many things  fair and good. So much gold he found there, that he thought verily that  scarce might two horses, or three belike, bear it thence. So he took  all the gold and laid it in two great chests, and set them on the horse  Grani, and took the reins of him, but nowise will he stir, neither will  he abide smiting. Then Sigurd knows the mind of the horse, and leaps on  the back of him, and smites and spurs into him, and off the horse goes  even as if he were unladen.
