One long, slender hand lay upon a cushion placed on  the chair arm, and a pretty girl was busily engaged in manicuring  his excellency's nails. Although the day held every promise of being  uncomfortably hot, already a huge fire was burning in the grate.    As Parker stood before him, the languid, handsome Oriental did not stir  a muscle, merely keeping the gaze of his strange black eyes fixed upon  the nervous cobbler. The manicurist, after one quick upward glance,  continued her work. But in this moment of distraction she had hurt the  cuticle of one of those delicate, slender fingers.    Ormuz Khan withdrew his hand sharply from the cushion, glanced aside at  the girl, and then, extending his hand again, pushed her away from him.  Because of her half-kneeling posture, she almost fell, but managed to  recover herself by clutching at the edge of a little table upon which  the implements of her trade were spread. The table rocked and a bowl of  water fell crashing on the carpet. His excellency spoke. His voice was  very musical.    \"Clumsy fool,\" he said. \"You have hurt me. Go.\"    The girl became very white and began to gather up the articles upon the  table. \"I am sorry,\" she said, \"but--\"    \"I do not wish you to speak,\" continued the musical voice; \"only to go.\"    Hurriedly collecting the remainder of the implements and placing them  in an attache case, the manicurist hurried from the room. Her eyes were  overbright and her lips pathetically tremulous. Ormuz Khan never glanced  in her direction again, but resumed his disconcerting survey of Parker.  \"Yes?\" he said.    Parker bumblingly began to remove the lid of the cardboard box which he  had brought with him.    \"I do not wish you to alter the shoes you have made,\" said his  excellency. \"I instructed you to remeasure my foot in order that you  might make a pair to fit.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Parker. \"Quite so, your excellency.\" And he dropped the  box and the shoes upon the floor. \"Just a moment, sir?\"    From an inner pocket he drew out a large sheet of white paper, a pencil,  and a tape measure. \"Will you place your foot upon this sheet of paper,  sir?\"    Ormuz Khan raised his right foot listlessly.    \"Slipper off, please, sir.\"    \"I am waiting,\" replied the other, never removing his gaze from Parker's  face.    \"Oh, I beg your pardon sir, your excellency,\" muttered the bootmaker.    Dropping upon one knee, he removed the furred slipper from a slender,  arched foot, bare, of the delicate colour of ivory, and as small as a  woman's.    \"Now, sir.\"    The ivory foot was placed upon the sheet of paper, and very clumsily  Parker drew its outline. He then took certain measurements and made a  number of notes with a stub of thick pencil. Whenever his none too  clean hands touched Ormuz Khan's delicate skin the Oriental perceptibly  shuddered.    \"Of course, sir,\" said Parker at last, \"I should really have taken your  measurement with the sock on.\"    \"I wear only the finest silk.\"    \"Very well, sir. As you wish.\"    Parker replaced paper, pencil, and measure, and, packing up the rejected  shoes, made for the door.    \"Oh, bootmaker!\" came the musical voice.    Parker turned. \"Yes, sir?\"    \"They will be ready by Monday?\"    \"If possible, your excellency.\"    \"Otherwise I shall not accept them.\"    Ormuz Khan drew a hyacinth from a vase close beside him and languidly  waved it in dismissal.    In the outer room the courteous secretary awaited Parker, and there was  apparently no one else in the place, for the Hindu conducted him to the  lobby and opened the door.    Parker said \"Good morning, sir,\" and would have departed without his hat  had not the secretary smilingly handed it to him.    When, presently, the cobbler emerged from the elevator, below, he paused  before leaving the hotel to mop his perspiring brow with a large, soiled  handkerchief. The perfume of hyacinths seemed to have pursued him,  bringing with it a memory of the handsome, effeminate ivory face of the  man above. He was recalled to his senses by the voice of the impudent  page.    \"Been kicked out, gov'nor?\" the youth inquired. \"You're the third this  morning.\"    \"Is that so?\" answered Parker. \"Who were the other two, lad?\"    \"The girl wot comes to do his nails. A stunnin' bird, too. She came down  cryin' a few minutes ago. Then--\"    \"Shut up, Chivers!\" cried the hall porter. \"You're asking for the sack,  and I'm the man to get it for you.\"    Chivers did not appear to be vastly perturbed by this prospect, and  he grinned agreeably at Parker as the latter made his way out into the  courtyard.    Any one sufficiently interested to have done so might have found matter  for surprise had he followed that conscientious bootmaker as he left the  hotel. He did not proceed to the shop of Mr. Jarvis, but, crossing the  Strand, mounted a city-bound motor bus and proceeded eastward upon it as  far as the Law Courts. Here he dismounted and plunged into that maze of  tortuous lanes which dissects the triangle formed by Chancery Lane and  Holborn.    His step was leisurely, and once he stopped to light his pipe, peering  with interest into the shop window of a law stationer. Finally he came  to another little shop which had once formed part of a private house. It  was of the lock-up variety, and upon the gauze blind which concealed the  interior appeared the words: \"The Chancery Agency.\"    Whether the Chancery Agency was a press agency, a literary or a dramatic  agency, was not specified, but Mr. Parker was evidently well acquainted  with the establishment, for he unlocked the door with a key which he  carried and, entering a tiny shop, closed and locked the door behind him  again.    The place was not more than ten yards square and the ceiling was very  low. It was barely furnished as an office, but evidently Mr. Parker's  business was not of a nature to detain him here. There was a second door  to be unlocked; and beyond it appeared a flight of narrow stairs--at  some time the servant's stair of the partially demolished house which  had occupied that site in former days. Relocking this door in turn, Mr.  Parker mounted the stair and presently found himself in a spacious and  well-furnished bedroom.    This bedroom contained an extraordinary number of wardrobes, and a  big dressing table with wing mirrors lent a theatrical touch to the  apartment. This was still further enhanced by the presence of all sorts  of wigs, boxes of false hair, and other items of make-up. At the table  Mr. Parker seated himself, and when, half an hour later, the bedroom  door was opened, it was not Mr. Parker who crossed the book-lined study  within and walked through to the private office where Innes was seated  writing. It was Mr. Paul Harley.        CHAPTER XI. THE PURPLE STAIN    For more than an hour Harley sat alone, smoking, neglectful of the  routine duties which should have claimed his attention. His face was  set and grim, and his expression one of total abstraction. In spirit  he stood again in that superheated room at the Savoy. Sometimes, as he  mused, he would smoke with unconscious vigour, surrounding himself with  veritable fog banks. An imaginary breath of hyacinths would have reached  him, to conjure up vividly the hateful, perfumed environment of Ormuz  Khan.    He was savagely aware of a great mental disorderliness. He recognized  that his brain remained a mere whirlpool from which Phyllis Abingdon,  the deceased Sir Charles, Nicol Brinn, and another, alternately arose to  claim supremacy. He clenched his teeth upon the mouthpiece of his pipe.    But after some time, although rebelliously, his thoughts began to  marshal themselves in a certain definite formation. And outstanding,  alone, removed from the ordinary, almost from the real, was the bizarre  personality of Ormuz Khan.    The data concerning the Oriental visitor, as supplied by Inspector  Wessex, had led him to expect quite a different type of character.  Inured as Paul Harley was to surprise, his first sentiment as he had set  eyes upon the man had been one of sheer amazement.    \"Something of a dandy,\" inadequately described the repellent  sensuousness of this veritable potentate, who could contrive to invest  a sitting room in a modern hotel with the atmosphere of a secret  Eastern household. To consider Ormuz Khan in connection with matters  of international finance was wildly incongruous, while the manicurist  incident indicated an inherent cruelty only possible in one of Oriental  race.    In a mood of complete mental detachment Paul Harley found himself  looking again into those black, inscrutable eyes and trying to analyze  the elusive quality of their regard. They were unlike any eyes that  he had met with. It were folly to count their possessor a negligible  quantity. Nevertheless, it was difficult, because of the fellow's  scented effeminacy, to believe that women could find him attractive.  But Harley, wise in worldly lore, perceived that the mystery surrounding  Ormuz Khan must make a strong appeal to a certain type of female mind.  He was forced to admit that some women, indeed many, would be as clay in  the hands of the man who possessed those long-lashed, magnetic eyes.    He thought of the pretty manicurist. Mortification he had read in her  white face, and pain; but no anger. Yes, Ormuz Khan was dangerous.    In what respect was he dangerous?    \"Phil Abingdon!\" Harley whispered, and, in the act of breathing the  name, laughed at his own folly.    In the name of reason, he mused, what could she find to interest her in  a man of Ormuz Khan's type? He was prepared to learn that there was a  mystic side to her personality--a phase in her character which would be  responsive to the outre and romantic. But he was loath to admit that  she could have any place in her affections for the scented devotee of  hyacinths.    Thus, as always, his musings brought him back to the same point. He  suppressed a groan and,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11602"],[0,"The World of Ice (#14)"],[1,"ley's  head and shoulders reappeared, and when they came up he was standing on  the margin of the pool blowing like a walrus.    \"Oh! then, but it _is_ cowld!\" he exclaimed, wringing the water from his  garments. \"Och! where's the ball? give me a kick or I'll freeze! so I  will.\"    As he spoke the drenched Irishman seized the ball from Mivins's hands  and gave it a kick that sent it high into the air. He was too wet and  heavy to follow it up, however, so he ambled off towards the ship as  vigorously as his clothes would allow him, followed by the whole crew.        CHAPTER VIII.    _Fred and the doctor go on an excursion in which, among other strange  things, they meet with red snow and a white bear, and Fred makes his  first essay as a sportsman_.      But where were Fred Ellice and Tom Singleton all this time? the reader  will probably ask.    Long before the game at football was suggested they had obtained leave  of absence from the captain, and, loaded with game-bag, a botanical box  and geological hammer, and a musket, were off along the coast on a  semi-scientific cruise. Young Singleton carried the botanical box and  hammer, being an enthusiastic geologist and botanist, while Fred carried  the game-bag and musket.    \"You see, Tom,\" he said as they stumbled along over the loose ice  towards the ice-belt that lined the cliffs--\"you see, I'm a great dab at  ornithology, especially when I've got a gun on my shoulder. When I  haven't a gun, strange to say, I don't feel half so enthusiastic about  birds!\"    \"That's a very peculiar style of regarding the science. Don't you think  it would be worth while communicating your views on the subject to one  of the scientific bodies when we get home again. They might elect you a  member, Fred.\"    \"Well, perhaps I shall,\" replied Fred gravely; \"but I say, to be  serious, I'm really going to screw up my energies as much as possible,  and make coloured drawings of all the birds I can get hold of in the  Arctic Regions. At least, I would like to try.\"    Fred finished his remark with a sigh, for just then the object for which  he had gone out to those regions occurred to him; and although the  natural buoyancy and hopefulness of his feelings enabled him generally  to throw off anxiety in regard to his father's fate, and join in the  laugh, and jest, and game as heartily as any one on board, there were  times when his heart failed him, and he almost despaired of ever seeing  his father again, and these feelings of despondency had been more  frequent since the day on which he witnessed the sudden and utter  destruction of the strange brig.    \"Don't let your spirits down, Fred,\" said Tom, whose hopeful and earnest  disposition often reanimated his friend's drooping spirits; \"it will  only unfit you for doing any good service. Besides, I think we have no  cause yet to despair. We know that your father came up this inlet, or  strait, or whatever it is, and he had a good stock of provisions with  him, according to the account we got at Upernavik, and it is not more  than a year since he was there. Many and many a whaler and discovery  ship has wintered more than a year in these regions. And then, consider  the immense amount of animal life all round us. They might have laid up  provisions for many months long before winter set in.\"    \"I know all that,\" replied Fred, with a shake of his head; \"but think of  yon brig that we saw go down in about ten minutes.\"    \"Well, so I do think of it. No doubt the brig was lost very suddenly,  but there was ample time, had there been any one on board, to have  leaped upon the ice, and they might have got to land by jumping from one  piece to another. Such things have happened before frequently. To say  truth, at every point of land we turn, I feel a sort of expectation  amounting almost to certainty that we shall find your father and his  party travelling southward on their way to the Danish settlements.\"    \"Perhaps you are right. God grant that it may be so!\"    As he spoke, they reached the fixed ice which ran along the foot of the  precipices for some distance like a road of hard white marble. Many  large rocks lay scattered over it, some of them several tons in weight,  and one or two balanced in a very remarkable way on the edge of the  cliffs.    \"There's a curious-looking gull I should like to shoot,\" exclaimed Fred,  pointing to a bird that hovered over his head, and throwing forward the  muzzle of his gun.    \"Fire away, then,\" said his friend, stepping back a pace.    Fred, being unaccustomed to the use of fire-arms, took a wavering aim  and fired.    \"What a bother! I've missed it!\"    \"Try again,\" remarked Tom with a quiet smile, as the whole cliff vomited  forth an innumerable host of birds, whose cries were perfectly  deafening.    \"It's my opinion,\" said Fred with a comical grin, \"that if I shut my  eyes and point upwards I can't help hitting something; but I  particularly want yon fellow, because he's beautifully marked. Ah! I see  him sitting on a rock yonder, so here goes once more.\"    Fred now proceeded towards the coveted bird in the fashion that is known  by the name of _stalking_--that is, creeping as close up to your game as  possible, so as to get a good shot; and it said much for his patience  and his future success the careful manner in which, on this occasion, he  wound himself in and out among the rocks and blocks of ice on the shore  in the hope of obtaining that sea-gull. At last he succeeded in getting  to within about fifteen yards of it, and then, resting his musket on a  lump of ice, and taking an aim so long and steadily that his companion  began to fancy he must have gone to sleep, he fired, and blew the gull  to atoms! There was scarcely so much as a shred of it to be found.    Fred bore his disappointment and discomfiture manfully. He formed a  resolution then and there to become a good shot, and although he did not  succeed exactly in becoming so that day, he nevertheless managed to put  several fine specimens of gulls and an auk into his bag. The last bird  amused him much, being a creature with a dumpy little body and a beak of  preposterously large size and comical aspect. There were also a great  number of eider-ducks flying about, but they failed to procure a  specimen.    Singleton was equally successful in his scientific researches. He found  several beautifully green mosses, one species of which was studded with  pale yellow flowers, and in one place, where a stream trickled down the  steep sides of the cliffs, he discovered a flower-growth which was rich  in variety of colouring. Amid several kinds of tufted grasses were seen  growing a small purple flower and the white star of the chickweed; The  sight of all this richness of vegetation growing in a little spot close  beside the snow, and amid such cold Arctic scenery, would have delighted  a much less enthusiastic spirit than that of our young surgeon. He went  quite into raptures with it, and stuffed his botanical box with mosses  and rocks until it could hold no more, and became a burden that cost him  a few sighs before he got back to the ship.    The rocks were found to consist chiefly of red sandstone. There was also  a good deal of green-stone and gneiss, and some of the spires of these  that shot up to a considerable height were particularly striking and  picturesque objects.    But the great sight of the day's excursion was that which unexpectedly  greeted their eyes on rounding a cape towards which they had been  walking for several hours. On passing this point they stopped with an  exclamation of amazement. Before them lay a scene such as the Arctic  Regions alone can produce.    In front lay a vast reach of the strait, which at this place opened up  abruptly and stretched away northward, laden with floes, and fields, and  hummocks, and bergs of every shade and size, to the horizon, where the  appearance of the sky indicated open water. Ponds of various sizes and  sheets of water whose dimensions entitled them to be styled lakes  spangled the white surface of the floes; and around these were sporting  innumerable flocks of wild-fowl, many of which, being pure white,  glanced like snow-flakes in the sunshine. Far off to the west the ice  came down with heavy uniformity to the water's edge. On the right there  was an array of cliffs whose frowning grandeur filled them with awe.  They varied from twelve to fifteen hundred feet in height, and some of  the precipices descended sheer down seven or eight hundred feet into the  sea, over which they cast a dark shadow.    Just at the feet of our young discoverers--for such we may truly call  them--a deep bay or valley trended away to the right, a large portion of  which was filled with the spur of a glacier, whose surface was covered  with _pink snow_! One can imagine with what feelings the two youths  gazed on this beautiful sight. It seemed as if that valley, instead of  forming a portion of the sterile region beyond the Arctic Circle, were  one of the sunniest regions of the south, for a warm glow rested on the  bosom of the snow, as if the sun were shedding upon it his rosiest hues.  A little farther to the north the red snow ceased, or only occurred here  and there in patches; and beyond it there appeared another gorge in the  cliffs, within which rose a tall column of rock, so straight and  cylindrical that it seemed to be a production of art. The whole of the  back country was one great rolling distance of glacier, and, wherever a  crevice or gorge in the riven cliffs afforded an opportunity, this ocean  of land-ice sent down spurs into the sea, the extremities of which were  constantly shedding off huge bergs into the water.    \"What a scene!\" exclaimed Tom Singleton, when he found words to express  his admiration. \"I did not think that our world contained so grand a  sight. It surpasses my wildest dreams of fairy-land.\"    \"Fairy-land!\" ejaculated Fred, with a slight look "]]]
