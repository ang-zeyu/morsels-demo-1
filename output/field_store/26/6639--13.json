The sea had  penetrated to the end of the passages, and everything was overthrown and  destroyed in the interior of the Chimneys!        Chapter 9    In a few words, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Neb were made acquainted  with what had happened. This accident, which appeared so very serious  to Pencroft, produced different effects on the companions of the honest  sailor.    Neb, in his delight at having found his master, did not listen, or  rather, did not care to trouble himself with what Pencroft was saying.    Herbert shared in some degree the sailor's feelings.    As to the reporter, he simply replied,--    \"Upon my word, Pencroft, it's perfectly indifferent to me!\"    \"But, I repeat, that we haven't any fire!\"    \"Pooh!\"    \"Nor any means of relighting it!\"    \"Nonsense!\"    \"But I say, Mr. Spilett--\"    \"Isn't Cyrus here?\" replied the reporter.    \"Is not our engineer alive? He will soon find some way of making fire  for us!\"    \"With what?\"    \"With nothing.\"    What had Pencroft to say? He could say nothing, for, in the bottom of  his heart he shared the confidence which his companions had in Cyrus  Harding. The engineer was to them a microcosm, a compound of every  science, a possessor of all human knowledge. It was better to be with  Cyrus in a desert island, than without him in the most flourishing town  in the United States. With him they could want nothing; with him they  would never despair. If these brave men had been told that a volcanic  eruption would destroy the land, that this land would be engulfed in the  depths of the Pacific, they would have imperturbably replied,--    \"Cyrus is here!\"    While in the palanquin, however, the engineer had again relapsed into  unconsciousness, which the jolting to which he had been subjected during  his journey had brought on, so that they could not now appeal to his  ingenuity. The supper must necessarily be very meager. In fact, all the  grouse flesh had been consumed, and there no longer existed any means of  cooking more game. Besides, the couroucous which had been reserved had  disappeared. They must consider what was to be done.    First of all, Cyrus Harding was carried into the central passage. There  they managed to arrange for him a couch of sea-weed which still remained  almost dry. The deep sleep which had overpowered him would no doubt be  more beneficial to him than any nourishment.    Night had closed in, and the temperature, which had modified when the  wind shifted to the northwest, again became extremely cold. Also, the  sea having destroyed the partitions which Pencroft had put up in certain  places in the passages, the Chimneys, on account of the draughts, had  become scarcely habitable. The engineer's condition would, therefore,  have been bad enough, if his companions had not carefully covered him  with their coats and waistcoats.    Supper, this evening, was of course composed of the inevitable  lithodomes, of which Herbert and Neb picked up a plentiful supply on the  beach. However, to these molluscs, the lad added some edible sea-weed,  which he gathered on high rocks, whose sides were only washed by the sea  at the time of high tides. This sea-weed, which belongs to the order  of Fucacae, of the genus Sargassum, produces, when dry, a gelatinous  matter, rich and nutritious. The reporter and his companions, after  having eaten a quantity of lithodomes, sucked the sargassum, of which  the taste was very tolerable. It is used in parts of the East very  considerably by the natives. \"Never mind!\" said the sailor, \"the captain  will help us soon.\" Meanwhile the cold became very severe, and unhappily  they had no means of defending themselves from it.    The sailor, extremely vexed, tried in all sorts of ways to procure fire.  Neb helped him in this work. He found some dry moss, and by striking  together two pebbles he obtained some sparks, but the moss, not being  inflammable enough, did not take fire, for the sparks were really only  incandescent, and not at all of the same consistency as those which  are emitted from flint when struck in the same manner. The experiment,  therefore, did not succeed.    Pencroft, although he had no confidence in the proceeding, then tried  rubbing two pieces of dry wood together, as savages do. Certainly, the  movement which he and Neb exhibited, if it had been transformed into  heat, according to the new theory, would have been enough to heat the  boiler of a steamer! It came to nothing. The bits of wood became hot, to  be sure, but much less so than the operators themselves.    After working an hour, Pencroft, who was in a complete state of  perspiration, threw down the pieces of wood in disgust.    \"I can never be made to believe that savages light their fires in this  way, let them say what they will,\" he exclaimed. \"I could sooner light  my arms by rubbing them against each other!\"    The sailor was wrong to despise the proceeding. Savages often kindle  wood by means of rapid rubbing. But every sort of wood does not answer  for the purpose, and besides, there is \"the knack,\" following the usual  expression, and it is probable that Pencroft had not \"the knack.\"    Pencroft's ill humor did not last long. Herbert had taken the bits of  wood which he had turned down, and was exerting himself to rub them.  The hardy sailor could not restrain a burst of laughter on seeing the  efforts of the lad to succeed where he had failed.    \"Rub, my boy, rub!\" said he.    \"I am rubbing,\" replied Herbert, laughing, \"but I don't pretend to do  anything else but warm myself instead of shivering, and soon I shall be  as hot as you are, my good Pencroft!\"    This soon happened. However, they were obliged to give up, for this  night at least, the attempt to procure fire. Gideon Spilett repeated,  for the twentieth time, that Cyrus Harding would not have been troubled  for so small a difficulty. And, in the meantime, he stretched himself in  one of the passages on his bed of sand. Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft did  the same, while Top slept at his master's feet.    Next day, the 28th of March, when the engineer awoke, about eight in the  morning, he saw his companions around him watching his sleep, and, as on  the day before, his first words were:--    \"Island or continent?\" This was his uppermost thought.    \"Well!\" replied Pencroft, \"we don't know anything about it, captain!\"    \"You don't know yet?\"    \"But we shall know,\" rejoined Pencroft, \"when you have guided us into  the country.\"    \"I think I am able to try it,\" replied the engineer, who, without much  effort, rose and stood upright.    \"That's capital!\" cried the sailor.    \"I feel dreadfully weak,\" replied Harding. \"Give me something to eat, my  friends, and it will soon go off. You have fire, haven't you?\"    This question was not immediately replied to. But, in a few seconds--    \"Alas! we have no fire,\" said Pencroft, \"or rather, captain, we have it  no longer!\"    And the sailor recounted all that had passed the day before. He amused  the engineer by the history of the single match, then his abortive  attempt to procure fire in the savages' way.    \"We shall consider,\" replied the engineer, \"and if we do not find some  substance similar to tinder--\"    \"Well?\" asked the sailor.    \"Well, we will make matches.    \"Chemicals?\"    \"Chemicals!\"    \"It is not more difficult than that,\" cried the reporter, striking the  sailor on the shoulder.    The latter did not think it so simple, but he did not protest. All went  out. The weather had become very fine. The sun was rising from the sea's  horizon, and touched with golden spangles the prismatic rugosities of  the huge precipice.    Having thrown a rapid glance around him, the engineer seated himself on  a block of stone. Herbert offered him a few handfuls of shell-fish and  sargassum, saying,--    \"It is all that we have, Captain Harding.\"    \"Thanks, my boy,\" replied Harding; \"it will do--for this morning at  least.\"    He ate the wretched food with appetite, and washed it down with a little  fresh water, drawn from the river in an immense shell.    His companions looked at him without speaking. Then, feeling somewhat  refreshed, Cyrus Harding crossed his arms, and said,--    \"So, my friends, you do not know yet whether fate has thrown us on an  island, or on a continent?\"    \"No, captain,\" replied the boy.    \"We shall know to-morrow,\" said the engineer; \"till then, there is  nothing to be done.\"    \"Yes,\" replied Pencroft.    \"What?\"    \"Fire,\" said the sailor, who, also, had a fixed idea.    \"We will make it, Pencroft,\" replied Harding.    \"While you were carrying me yesterday, did I not see in the west a  mountain which commands the country?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Spilett, \"a mountain which must be rather high--\"    \"Well,\" replied the engineer, \"we will climb to the summit to-morrow,  and then we shall see if this land is an island or a continent. Till  then, I repeat, there is nothing to be done.\"    \"Yes, fire!\" said the obstinate sailor again.    \"But he will make us a fire!\" replied Gideon Spilett, \"only have a  little patience, Pencroft!\"    The seaman looked at Spilett in a way which seemed to say, \"If it  depended upon you to do it, we wouldn't taste roast meat very soon\"; but  he was silent.    Meanwhile Captain Harding had made no reply. He appeared to be very  little troubled by the question of fire. For a few minutes he remained  absorbed in thought; then again speaking,--    \"My friends,\" said he, \"our situation is, perhaps, deplorable; but, at  any rate, it is very plain. Either we are on a continent, and then, at  the expense of greater or less fatigue, we shall reach some inhabited  place, or we are on an island. In the latter case, if the island is  inhabited, we will try to get out of the scrape with the help of its  inhabitants; if it is desert, we will try to get out of the scrape by  ourselves.\"    \"Certainly, nothing could be plainer,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12680"],[0,"Children of the Ghetto: A Study of a Peculiar People (#14)"],[1,"hat, and a boa round her throat, and  earned thirty shillings a week, all told, as a school teacher. (Esther  Ansell was in her class just now.) Probably her toilette had made old  Hyams unpunctual. His arrival was the signal for the commencement of the  proceedings, and the men hastened to assume their head-gear.    Ephraim Phillips cautiously took the swaddled-up infant from the bosom  of Milly where it was suckling and presented it to old Hyams.  Fortunately Ezekiel had already had a repletion of milk, and was drowsy  and manifested very little interest in the whole transaction.    \"This my first-born son,\" said Ephraim in Hebrew as he handed Ezekiel  over--\"is the first-born of his mother, and the Holy One, blessed be He,  hath given command to redeem him, as it is said, and those that are to  be redeemed of them from a month old, shalt thou redeem according to  thine estimation for the money of five shekels after the shekel of the  sanctuary, the shekel being twenty gerahs; and it is said, 'Sanctify  unto me all the first-born, whatsoever openeth the womb among the  children of Israel, both of man and of beast; it is mine.'\"    Ephraim Phillips then placed fifteen shillings in silver before old  Hyams, who thereupon inquired in Chaldaic: \"Which wouldst thou  rather--give me thy first-born son, the first-born of his mother, or  redeem him for five selaim, which thou art bound to give according to  the Law?\"    Ephraim replied in Chaldaic: \"I am desirous rather to redeem my son,  and here thou hast the value of his redemption, which I am bound to give  according to the Law.\"    Thereupon Hyams took the money tendered, and gave back the child to his  father, who blessed God for His sanctifying commandments, and thanked  Him for His mercies; after which the old _Cohen_ held the fifteen  shillings over the head of the infant, saying: \"This instead of that,  this in exchange for that, this in remission of that. May this child  enter into life, into the Law, and into the fear of Heaven. May it be  God's will that even as he has been admitted to redemption, so may he  enter into the Law, the nuptial canopy and into good deeds. Amen.\" Then,  placing his hand in benediction upon the child's head, the priestly  layman added: \"God make thee as Ephraim and Manasseh. The Lord bless  thee and keep thee. The Lord make His face to shine upon thee, and be  gracious unto thee. The Lord turn His face to thee and grant thee peace.  The Lord is thy guardian; the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. For  length of days and years of life and peace shall they add to thee. The  Lord shall guard thee from all evil. He shall guard thy soul.\"    \"Amen,\" answered the company, and then there was a buzz of secular talk,  general rapture being expressed at the stolidness of Ezekiel's demeanor.  Cups of tea were passed round by the lovely Leah, and the secrets of the  paper bags were brought to light. Ephraim Phillips talked horses with  Sam Levine, and old Hyams quarrelled with Malka over the disposal of the  fifteen shillings. Knowing that Hyams was poor, Malka refused to take  back the money retendered by him under pretence of a gift to the child.  The _Cohen_, however, was a proud man, and under the eye of Miriam a  firm one. Ultimately it was agreed the money should be expended on a  _Missheberach_, for the infant's welfare and the synagogue's. Birds of a  feather flock together, and Miriam forgathered with Hannah Jacobs, who  also had a stylish feather in her hat, and was the most congenial of the  company. Mrs. Jacobs was left to discourse of the ailments of childhood  and the iniquities of servants with Mrs. Phillips. Reb Shemuel's wife,  commonly known as the Rebbitzin, was a tall woman with a bony nose and  shrivelled cheeks, whereon the paths of the blood-vessels were scrawled  in red. The same bones were visible beneath the plumper padding of  Hannah's face. Mrs. Jacobs had escaped the temptation to fatness, which  is the besetting peril of the Jewish matron. If Hannah could escape her  mother's inclination to angularity she would be a pretty woman. She  dressed with taste, which is half the battle, and for the present she  was only nineteen.    \"Do you think it's a good match?\" said Miriam Hyams, indicating Sam  Levine with a movement of the eyebrow.    A swift, scornful look flitted across Hannah's face. \"Among the Jews,\"  she said, \"every match is a grand _Shidduch_ before the marriage; after,  we hear another tale.\"    \"There is a good deal in that,\" admitted Miriam, thoughtfully. \"The  girl's family cries up the capture shamelessly. I remember when Clara  Emanuel was engaged, her brother Jack told me it was a splendid  _Shidduch_. Afterwards I found he was a widower of fifty-five with three  children.\"    \"But that engagement went off,\" said Hannah.    \"I know,\" said Miriam. \"I'm only saying I can't fancy myself doing  anything of the kind.\"    \"What! breaking off an engagement?\" said Hannah, with a cynical little  twinkle about her eye.    \"No, taking a man like that,\" replied Miriam. \"I wouldn't look at a man  over thirty-five, or with less than two hundred and fifty a year.\"    \"You'll never marry a teacher, then,\" Hannah remarked.    \"Teacher!\" Miriam Hyams repeated, with a look of disgust. \"How can one  be respectable on three pounds a week? I must have a man in a good  position.\" She tossed her piquant nose and looked almost handsome. She  was five years older than Hannah, and it seemed an enigma why men did  not rush to lay five pounds a week at her daintily shod feet.    \"I'd rather marry a man with two pounds a week if I loved him,\" said  Hannah in a low tone.    \"Not in this century,\" said Miriam, shaking her head incredulously. \"We  don't believe in that nonsense now-a-days. There was Alice Green,--she  used to talk like that,--now look at her, riding about in a gig side by  side with a bald monkey.\"    \"Alice Green's mother,\" interrupted Malka, pricking up her ears,  \"married a son of Mendel Weinstein by his third wife, Dinah, who had ten  pounds left her by her uncle Shloumi.\"    \"No, Dinah was Mendel's second wife,\" corrected Mrs. Jacobs, cutting  short a remark of Mrs. Phillips's in favor of the new interest.    \"Dinah was Mendel's third wife,\" repeated Malka, her tanned cheeks  reddening. \"I know it because my Simon, God bless him, was breeched the  same month.\"    Simon was Malka's eldest, now a magistrate in Melbourne.    \"His third wife was Kitty Green, daughter of the yellow Melammed,\"  persisted the Rebbitzin. \"I know it for a fact, because Kitty's sister  Annie was engaged for a week to my brother-in-law Nathaniel.\"    \"His first wife,\" put in Malka's husband, with the air of arbitrating  between the two, \"was Shmool the publican's eldest daughter.\"    \"Shmool the publican's daughter,\" said Malka, stirred to fresh  indignation, \"married Hyam Robins, the grandson of old Benjamin, who  kept the cutlery shop at the corner of Little Eden Alley, there where  the pickled cucumber store stands now.\"    \"It was Shmool's sister that married Hyam Robins, wasn't it, mother?\"  asked Milly, incautiously.    \"Certainly not,\" thundered Malka. \"I knew old Benjamin well, and he sent  me a pair of chintz curtains when I married your father.\"    \"Poor old Benjamin! How long has he been dead?\" mused Reb Shemuel's  wife.    \"He died the year I was confined with my Leah----\"    \"Stop! stop!\" interrupted Sam Levine boisterously. \"There's Leah getting  as red as fire for fear you'll blab out her age.\"    \"Don't be a fool, Sam,\" said Leah, blushing violently, and looking the  lovelier for it.    The attention of the entire company was now concentrated upon the  question at issue, whatever it might be. Malka fixed her audience with  her piercing eye, and said in a tone that scarce brooked contradiction:  \"Hyam Robins couldn't have married Shmool's sister because Shmool's  sister was already the wife of Abraham the fishmonger.\"    \"Yes, but Shmool had two sisters,\" said Mrs. Jacobs, audaciously  asserting her position as the rival genealogist.    \"Nothing of the kind,\" replied Malka warmly.    \"I'm quite sure,\" persisted Mrs. Jacobs. \"There was Phoeby and there was  Harriet.\"    \"Nothing of the kind,\" repeated Malka. \"Shmool had three sisters. Only  two were in the deaf and dumb home.\"    \"Why, that, wasn't Shmool at all,\" Milly forgot herself so far as to  say, \"that was Block the Baker.\"    \"Of course!\" said Malka in her most acid tone. \"My _kinder_ always know  better than me.\"    There was a moment of painful silence. Malka's eye mechanically sought  the clothes-brush. Then Ezekiel sneezed. It was a convulsive \"atichoo,\"  and agitated the infant to its most intimate flannel-roll.    \"For thy Salvation do I hope, O Lord,\" murmured Malka, piously, adding  triumphantly aloud, \"There! the _kind_ has sneezed to the truth of it. I  knew I was right.\"    The sneeze of an innocent child silences everybody who is not a  blasphemer. In the general satisfaction at the unexpected solution of  the situation, no one even pointed out that the actual statement to  which Ezekiel had borne testimony, was an assertion of the superior  knowledge of Malka's children. Shortly afterwards the company trooped  downstairs to partake of high tea, which in the Ghetto need not include  anything more fleshly than fish. Fish was, indeed, the staple of the  meal. Fried fish, and such fried fish! Only a great poet could sing the  praises of the national dish, and the golden age of Hebrew poetry is  over. Strange that Gebirol should have lived and died without the  opportunity of the theme, and that the great Jehuda Halevi himself  should have had to devote his genius merely to singing the glories of  Jerusalem. \"Israel is among the other nations,\" he sang, \"as the heart  among the limbs.\" Even so is the fried fish of Judaea to the fried fish  of Christendom and Heathendom. With the audacity of true culinary  genius, Jewish fried fish is always"]]]
