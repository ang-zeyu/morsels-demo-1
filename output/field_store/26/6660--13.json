You see I've got to send money  home to the old woman, and--you've won twenty times that amount from  me.\"    The conclusion was, perhaps, not entirely logical, but Jack overlooked  it, and handed the sum to his visitor. \"The old-woman business is about  played out, Brown,\" he added, by way of commentary; \"why don't you say  you want to buck agin' faro? You know you ain't married!\"    \"Fact, sir,\" said Brown, with a sudden gravity, as if the mere contact  of the gold with the palm of the hand had imparted some dignity to his  frame. \"I've got a wife--a damned good one, too, if I do say it--in the  States. It's three year since I've seen her, and a year since I've writ  to her. When things is about straight, and we get down to the lead, I'm  going to send for her.\"    \"And Kate?\" queried Mr. Hamlin, with his previous smile.    Mr. Brown of Calaveras essayed an archness of glance, to cover his  confusion, which his weak face and whisky-muddled intellect but poorly  carried out, and said:    \"Damn it, Jack, a man must have a little liberty, you know. But  come, what do you say to a little game? Give us a show to double this  hundred.\"    Jack Hamlin looked curiously at his fatuous friend. Perhaps he knew that  the man was predestined to lose the money, and preferred that it should  flow back into his own coffers rather than any other. He nodded his  head, and drew his chair toward the table. At the same moment there came  a rap upon the door.    \"It's Kate,\" said Mr. Brown.    Mr. Hamlin shot back the bolt, and the door opened. But, for the  first time in his life, he staggered to his feet, utterly unnerved and  abashed, and for the first time in his life the hot blood crimsoned his  colorless cheeks to his forehead. For before him stood the lady he had  lifted from the Wingdam coach, whom Brown--dropping his cards with a  hysterical laugh--greeted as:    \"My old woman, by thunder!\"    They say that Mrs. Brown burst into tears, and reproaches of her  husband. I saw her, in 1857, at Marysville, and disbelieve the story.  And the WINGDAM CHRONICLE, of the next week, under the head of \"Touching  Reunion,\" said: \"One of those beautiful and touching incidents, peculiar  to California life, occurred last week in our city. The wife of one of  Wingdam's eminent pioneers, tired of the effete civilization of the East  and its inhospitable climate, resolved to join her noble husband  upon these golden shores. Without informing him of her intention,  she undertook the long journey, and arrived last week. The joy of the  husband may be easier imagined than described. The meeting is said  to have been indescribably affecting. We trust her example may be  followed.\"      Whether owing to Mrs. Brown's influence, or to some more successful  speculations, Mr. Brown's financial fortune from that day steadily  improved. He bought out his partners in the \"Nip and Tuck\" lead, with  money which was said to have been won at poker, a week or two after his  wife's arrival, but which rumor, adopting Mrs. Brown's theory that Brown  had forsworn the gaming-table, declared to have been furnished by Mr.  Jack Hamlin. He built and furnished the \"Wingdam House,\" which pretty  Mrs. Brown's great popularity kept overflowing with guests. He was  elected to the Assembly, and gave largess to churches. A street in  Wingdam was named in his honor.    Yet it was noted that in proportion as he waxed wealthy and fortunate,  he grew pale, thin, and anxious. As his wife's popularity increased,  he became fretful and impatient. The most uxorious of husbands, he  was absurdly jealous. If he did not interfere with his wife's social  liberty, it was because it was maliciously whispered that his first and  only attempt was met by an outburst from Mrs. Brown that terrified him  into silence. Much of this kind of gossip came from those of her own sex  whom she had supplanted in the chivalrous attentions of Wingdam, which,  like most popular chivalry, was devoted to an admiration of power,  whether of masculine force or feminine beauty. It should be remembered,  too, in her extenuation that since her arrival, she had been the  unconscious priestess of a mythological worship, perhaps not more  ennobling to her womanhood than that which distinguished an older Greek  democracy. I think that Brown was dimly conscious of this. But his only  confidant was Jack Hamlin, whose INFELIX reputation naturally precluded  any open intimacy with the family, and whose visits were infrequent.    It was midsummer, and a moonlit night; and Mrs. Brown, very rosy,  large-eyed, and pretty, sat upon the piazza, enjoying the fresh incense  of the mountain breeze, and, it is to be feared, another incense  which was not so fresh, nor quite as innocent. Beside her sat Colonel  Starbottle and Judge Boompointer, and a later addition to her court in  the shape of a foreign tourist. She was in good spirits.    \"What do you see down the road?\" inquired the gallant Colonel, who had  been conscious, for the last few minutes, that Mrs. Brown's attention  was diverted.    \"Dust,\" said Mrs. Brown, with a sigh. \"Only Sister Anne's 'flock of  sheep.'\"    The Colonel, whose literary recollections did not extend farther back  than last week's paper, took a more practical view. \"It ain't sheep,\" he  continued; \"it's a horseman. Judge, ain't that Jack Hamlin's gray?\"    But the Judge didn't know; and as Mrs. Brown suggested the air was  growing too cold for further investigations, they retired to the parlor.    Mr. Brown was in the stable, where he generally retired after dinner.  Perhaps it was to show his contempt for his wife's companions; perhaps,  like other weak natures, he found pleasure in the exercise of absolute  power over inferior animals. He had a certain gratification in the  training of a chestnut mare, whom he could beat or caress as pleased  him, which he couldn't do with Mrs. Brown. It was here that he  recognized a certain gray horse which had just come in, and, looking  a little farther on, found his rider. Brown's greeting was cordial and  hearty, Mr. Hamlin's somewhat restrained. But at Brown's urgent request,  he followed him up the back stairs to a narrow corridor, and thence to  a small room looking out upon the stable yard. It was plainly furnished  with a bed, a table, a few chairs, and a rack for guns and whips.    \"This yer's my home, Jack,\" said Brown, with a sigh, as he threw himself  upon the bed, and motioned his companion to a chair. \"Her room's t'other  end of the hall. It's more'n six months since we've lived together, or  met, except at meals. It's mighty rough papers on the head of the house,  ain't it?\" he said, with a forced laugh. \"But I'm glad to see you,  Jack, damn glad,\" and he reached from the bed, and again shook the  unresponsive hand of Jack Hamlin.    \"I brought ye up here, for I didn't want to talk in the stable; though,  for the matter of that, it's all round town. Don't strike a light. We  can talk here in the moonshine. Put up your feet on that winder, and sit  here beside me. Thar's whisky in that jug.\"    Mr. Hamlin did not avail himself of the information. Brown of Calaveras  turned his face to the wall and continued:    \"If I didn't love the woman, Jack, I wouldn't mind. But it's loving her,  and seeing her, day arter day, goin' on at this rate, and no one to put  down the brake; that's what gits me! But I'm glad to see ye, Jack, damn  glad.\"    In the darkness he groped about until he had found and wrung his  companion's hand again. He would have detained it, but Jack slipped it  into the buttoned breast of his coat, and asked, listlessly, \"How long  has this been going on?\"    \"Ever since she came here; ever since the day she walked into the  Magnolia. I was a fool then; Jack, I'm a fool now; but I didn't know how  much I loved her till then. And she hasn't been the same woman since.    \"But that ain't all, Jack; and it's what I wanted to see you about, and  I'm glad you've come. It ain't that she doesn't love me any more; it  ain't that she fools with every chap that comes along, for, perhaps, I  staked her love and lost it, as I did everything else at the Magnolia;  and, perhaps, foolin' is nateral to some women, and thar ain't no great  harm done, 'cept to the fools. But, Jack, I think--I think she loves  somebody else. Don't move, Jack; don't move; if your pistol hurts ye,  take it off.    \"It's been more'n six months now that she's seemed unhappy and lonesome,  and kinder nervous and scared-like. And sometimes I've ketched her  lookin' at me sort of timid and pitying. And she writes to somebody.  And for the last week she's been gathering her own things--trinkets,  and furbelows, and jew'lry--and, Jack, I think she's goin' off. I could  stand all but that. To have her steal away like a thief--\" He put his  face downward to the pillow, and for a few moments there was no sound  but the ticking of a clock on the mantel. Mr. Hamlin lit a cigar, and  moved to the open window. The moon no longer shone into the room, and  the bed and its occupant were in shadow. \"What shall I do, Jack?\" said  the voice from the darkness.    The answer came promptly and clearly from the window-side: \"Spot the  man, and kill him on sight.\"    \"But, Jack?\"    \"He's took the risk!\"    \"But will that bring HER back?\"    Jack did not reply, but moved from the window toward the door.    \"Don't go yet, Jack; light the candle, and sit by the table. It's a  comfort to see ye, if nothin' else.\"    Jack hesitated, and then complied. He drew a pack of cards from his  pocket and shuffled them, glancing at the bed. But Brown's face was  turned to the wall. When Mr. Hamlin had shuffled the cards, he cut them,  and dealt one card on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13121"],[0,"A Voyage to Terra Australis — Volume 2 (#14)"],[1,"ed, it was sent on board.    The botanists landed upon the east shore, preferring the main land for  their pursuits; and the launch was sent to haul the seine on that side,  at a beach a little way up the Sound. I went to the top of Pier Head and  took bearings of the Northumberland Islands, as also of the points and  hills of the coast to the east and west; the most essential of them to  the connexion of the survey, were as under:    Mount Westall, station on the top,              S. 63 deg. 20' E.  Aken's Island, station on the N. E. end,        S. 43  10  E.  Pine Mount,                                     S. 25   5  E.  Long Island, the north point, distant 8 miles,  N. 65   5  W.  Peaked Hill, west side of Broad Sound,          N. 61  25  W.  Northumberland I., a peak, marked h,            N. 22  25  W.  Northumberland I., No. 3 peak (of Percy Isles), N. 20  10  E.    Captain Cook observed, when taking bearings upon the top of Pier Head,  \"that the needle differed very considerably in its position, even to  thirty degrees, in some places more, in others less; and once he found it  differ from itself no less than two points in the distance of fourteen  feet.\" (Hawkesworth, III, 126); from whence he concluded there was iron  ore in the hills. I determined, in consequence, to make more particular  observations, both with the theodolite and dipping needle; and shall  briefly state the results obtained on this, and on the following day.    Azimuths were taken, and the bearing of Mount Westall, distant  thirty-four miles, was set at S. 63 deg. 28' E. (true), whilst the theodolite  remained in the same place; and from a comparison between this bearing  and those of the same object at different parts of the head, the  variations were deduced. The dip was observed with both ends of the  needle, and the face of the instrument changed each time.    At the highest top of Pier Head, Var.        3 deg. 25' E. Dip 53 deg. 20' S.  West, three yards from it,                   6  10  S. E. three yards,                          10   5  S. S. E., ten yards,                         8   6         52  19  North, four,                                 6  55  N. E., twenty,                               6  50         50  35  N. N. E., one-sixth mile, at the water side, 7   6         50  28  S. E., one-third mile, at ditto,             8   2         50  50    There are here no differences equal to those found by captain Cook; but  it is to be observed, that he used a ship's azimuth compass, probably not  raised further from the ground than to be placed on a stone, whereas my  theodolite stood upon legs, more than four feet high. The dipping needle  was raised about two feet; and by its greater inclination at the top of  the hill, shows the principal attraction to have been not far from  thence. The least dip, 50 deg. 28', taken at the shore on the north side of  the head, was doubtless the least affected; but it appears to have been  half a degree too much, for at Port Bowen, twenty-two miles further  south, it was no more than 50 deg. 20'. An amplitude taken on board the ship  in the Sound by lieutenant Flinders, when the head was S. S. W., gave  variation 8 deg. 39', or corrected to the meridian, 7 deg. 40' east. As Pier Head  lay almost exactly in the meridian, from the ship, its magnetism would  not alter the direction of the needle; and I therefore consider 7 deg. 40' to  be very nearly the true variation, when unaffected by local causes: in  Port Bowen, it varied from 7 deg. 40' to 8 deg. 30' east.    Notwithstanding this very sensible effect upon the needle, both  horizontally and vertically, I did not find, any more than captain Cook,  that a piece of the stone applied to the theodolite drew the needle at  all out of its direction; nevertheless I am induced to think, that the  attraction was rather dispersed throughout the mass of stone composing  Pier Head, than that any mine of iron ore exists in it. The stone is a  porphyry of a dark, blueish colour.     MONDAY 6 SEPTEMBER 1802    On the 6th, at noon, when the observations were finished and I had  proposed to quit Thirsty Sound, the wind and tide were both against us.  To employ the rest of the day usefully, I went over in the whale boat,  accompanied by the landscape painter, to the 6th, 7th, and 8th  Northumberland Islands, which, with many low islets and rocks near them,  form a cluster three or four leagues to the north-east of the Sound.  Orders were left with lieutenant Fowler to get the ship under way as  early as possible on the following morning, and come out to meet us.    Nearly mid-way between Pier Head and the cluster, lie some rocks  surrounded with breakers; and until they were passed the depth was from 6  to 8 fathoms, and 11 afterwards. We rowed to a beach at the north-west  end of the 7th island, proposing there to pass the night, and hoped to  turn some turtle; but proofs of natives having lately visited, or being  perhaps then on the island, damped our prospects, and still more did the  absence of turtle tracks; yet under each tree near the shore were the  remains of a turtle feast.    TUESDAY 7 SEPTEMBER 1802    In the morning I ascended the highest hill on the 7th island, and took  bearings; but the hazy weather which had come on with a strong wind at E.  S. E., confined them within a circle of three leagues. This island is  somewhat more than a mile in length, and was covered with grass, but  almost destitute of wood; the rock is a greenish, speckled stone, with  veins of quartz finely inserted, and is something between granite and  porphyry. The 6th island is the largest of this little cluster, being two  and a half miles long; and it was well covered with wood. We rowed over  to it with some difficulty on account of the wind, but could not sound in  the channel; it appeared to be deep, its least width three-quarters of a  mile, and in fine weather a ship might anchor there and procure pines fit  for top masts, at several places in the group. Water was found under the  hills on the 6th island; but not in sufficient quantities for the purpose  of a ship.    I looked anxiously, but in vain, for lieutenant Fowler to come out of  Thirsty Sound; for the wind blew so strong that it was uncertain whether  the boat could fetch over, or that it was even safe to attempt it; our  provisions, besides, were nearly exhausted, and nothing more substantial  than oysters could be procured. Pressed by necessity, we set off under  close-reefed sails; and the boat performing admirably, fetched the low  neck to leeward of Pier Head, whence another boat took us to the ship;  and at high water in the evening, the whale boat floated over the neck  and followed.    When Mr. Fowler had weighed in the morning, according to my directions,  the ship had driven so near the shore before the stream anchor was at the  bows, that he let go the small bower; but the cable parted, and obliged  him to drop the best bower, being then in 3 fathoms water with the wind  blowing strong into the sound. By means of a warp to the brig, the best  bower was shifted into 4 fathoms; and when I got on board, the stream and  small bower anchors had just been recovered. The weather tide made at  nine in the evening, and we ran into 7 fathoms in the channel; and at  daylight stood out of the sound, with the brig in company, having then a  moderate breeze at south-east.    Of Thirsty Sound as a harbour, very little can be said in praise; the  north-east and east winds throw in a good deal of sea, and there is not  room for more than three or four ships, without running up into the  narrow part; and what the depth may be there I did not examine, but saw  that there were shoals. The entrance of the sound may be known by two  round hills, one on each side, lying nearly north and south, one mile and  a half from each other: the northernmost is Pier Head. The surrounding  country is clothed with grass and wood; but on the Long-Island side the  grass is coarse, the trees are thinly scattered, and the soil is every  where too stony for the cultivation of grain.    There were many traces of natives, though none recent. Judging from what  was seen round the fire places, turtle would seem to be their principal  food; and indeed several turtle were seen in the water, but we had not  dexterity enough to take any of them. In fishing with the seine, at a  small beach two miles up the sound, we always had tolerably good success;  but no fresh water accessible to boats could be found in the  neighbourhood.    The _latitude_ of Pier Head, from an observation made at the top in an  artificial horizon, is 22 deg. 6' 53\" S.    _Longitude_ from thirteen sets of distances of the sun west of the moon,  observed by lieutenant Flinders, 149 deg. 47' 50\"; but by the survey and the  fixed position in Broad Sound, with which the time-keepers agreed, it  will be more correctly 150 deg. 0' 10\"  E.    Captain Cook specifies the situation of Thirsty Sound to be in latitude  22 deg. 10', longitude 149 deg. 42' (Hawkesworth, III, 128); but in the chart  published by Mr. Dalrymple, it is 22 deg. 7' and 149 deg. 36', which agrees  nearer with the deductions of Mr. Wales (_Astron. Obs._ p. 135). In  either case it appears, that my longitude was getting more eastward from  captain Cook as we advanced further along the coast.    WEDNESDAY 8 SEPTEMBER 1802    The tides in Thirsty Sound were neaped at this time, and the rise,  judging by the lead line, was from ten to twelve feet; but captain Cook  says, \"at spring tides the water does not rise less than sixteen or  eighteen feet,\" which I have no doubt is correct. It ceases at _ten hours  and three quarters after_ the moon passes over and under the meridian.    On quitting Thirsty Sound we steered north-westward, to pass round a  chain of rocks extending six miles out from Pier Head, and behind which  there was a bight in Long Island, with some appearance of an opening. It  was my"]]]
