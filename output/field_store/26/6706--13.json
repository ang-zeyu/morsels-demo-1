Adjective pronouns are divided into three classes:--    (1) DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS, such as _this_, _that_, _the former_, etc.    (2) DISTRIBUTIVE PRONOUNS, such as _each_, _either_, _neither_, etc.    (3) NUMERAL PRONOUNS, as _some_, _any_, _few_, _many_, _none_, _all_,  etc.      DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS.    [Sidenote: _Definition and examples._]    133. A DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUN is one that definitely points out what  persons or things are alluded to in the sentence.    The person or thing alluded to by the demonstrative may be in another  sentence, or may be the whole of a sentence. For example, \"Be _that_  as it may\" could refer to a sentiment in a sentence, or an argument in  a paragraph; but the demonstrative clearly points to that thing.    The following are examples of demonstratives:--         I did not say _this_ in so many words.         All _these_ he saw; but what he fain had seen He could not see.         Beyond _that_ I seek not to penetrate the veil.         How much we forgive in _those_ who yield us the rare spectacle of       heroic manners!         The correspondence of Bonaparte with his brother Joseph, when       _the latter_ was the King of Spain.         _Such_ are a few isolated instances, accidentally preserved.         Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness,       reap _the same_.         They know that patriotism has its glorious opportunities and its       sacred duties. They have not shunned _the one_, and they have       well performed _the other_.    NOTE.--It will be noticed in the first four sentences that _this_ and  _that_ are inflected for number.        Exercises.    (_a_) Find six sentences using demonstrative adjective pronouns.    (_b_) In which of the following is _these_ a pronoun?--         1. Formerly the duty of a librarian was to keep people as much as       possible from the books, and to hand _these_ over to his       successor as little worn as he could.--LOWELL.         2. They had fewer books, but _these_ were of the best.--_Id._         3. A man inspires affection and honor, because he was not lying       in wait for _these_.--EMERSON         4. Souls such as _these_ treat you as gods would.--_Id._         5. _These_ are the first mountains that broke the uniform level       of the earth's surface.--AGASSIZ      DISTRIBUTIVE PRONOUNS.    [Sidenote: _Definition and examples._]    134. The DISTRIBUTIVE PRONOUNS are those which stand for the names  of persons or things considered singly.    [Sidenote: _Simple._]    Some of these are _simple_ pronouns; for example,--         They stood, or sat, or reclined, as seemed good to _each_.         As two yoke devils sworn to _other's_ purpose.         Their minds accorded into one strain, and made delightful music       which _neither_ could have claimed as all his own.    [Sidenote: _Compound_.]    Two are compound pronouns,--_each other_, _one another_. They may be  separated into two adjective pronouns; as,         We violated our reverence _each_ for _the other's_ soul.       --HAWTHORNE.    More frequently they are considered as one pronoun.         They led one another, as it were, into a high pavilion of their       thoughts.--HAWTHORNE.         Men take each other's measure when they react.--EMERSON.    Exercise.--Find sentences containing three distributive pronouns.      NUMERAL PRONOUNS.    [Sidenote: _Definition and examples_.]    135. The NUMERAL PRONOUNS are those which stand for an uncertain  number or quantity of persons or things.    The following sentences contain numeral pronouns:--         Trusting too much to _others'_ care is the ruin of _many_.         'Tis of no importance how large his house, you quickly come to       the end of _all_.         _Another_ opposes him with sound argument.         It is as if _one_ should be so enthusiastic a lover of poetry as       to care nothing for Homer or Milton.         There were plenty _more_ for him to fall in company with, as       _some_ of the rangers had gone astray.         The Soldan, imbued, as _most_ were, with the superstitions of his       time, paused over a horoscope.         If those [taxes] were the only _ones_ we had to pay, we might the       more easily discharge them.         _Much_ might be said on both sides.         If hand of mine _another's_ task has lightened.       It felt the guidance that it does not claim.       So perish _all_ whose breast ne'er learned to glow       For _others_' good, or melt for _others_' woe.         _None_ shall rule but the humble.    [Sidenote: _Some inflected._]    It will be noticed that some of these are inflected for case and  number; such as _one other_, _another_.    The word _one_ has a reflexive form; for example,--    [Sidenote: One _reflexive_.]         The best way to punish _oneself_ for doing ill seems to me to go       and do good.--KINGSLEY.         The lines sound so prettily to _one's self_. HOLMES.    Exercise.--Find sentences containing ten numeral pronouns.        INDEFINITE PRONOUNS.      [Sidenote: _Definition and examples._]    136. Indefinite pronouns are words which stand for an indefinite  number or quantity of persons or things; but, unlike adjective  pronouns, they are never used as adjectives.    Most of them are compounds of two or more words:--    [Sidenote: _List._]    _Somebody_, _some one_, _something_; _anybody_, _any one_ (or  _anyone_), _anything_; _everybody_, _every one_ (or _everyone_),  _everything_; _nobody_, _no one_, _nothing_; _somebody else_, _anyone  else_, _everybody else_, _every one else_, etc.; also _aught_,  _naught_; and _somewhat_, _what_, and _they_.    The following sentences contain indefinite pronouns:--         As he had them of all hues, he hoped to fit _everybody's_ fancy.         _Every one_ knows how laborious the usual method is of attaining       to arts and sciences.         _Nothing_ sheds more honor on our early history than the       impression which these measures everywhere produced in America.         Let us also perform _something_ worthy to be remembered.         William of Orange was more than _anything else_ a religious man.         Frederick was discerned to be a purchaser of _everything_ that       _nobody else_ would buy.         These other souls draw me as _nothing else_ can.         The genius that created it now creates _somewhat else_.         _Every one else_ stood still at his post.         That is perfectly true: I did not want _anybody else's_ authority       to write as I did.    _They_ indefinite means people in general; as,--         At lovers' perjuries, _they_ say, Jove laughs.--SHAKESPEARE.    _What_ indefinite is used in the expression \"I tell you _what_.\" It  means _something_, and was indefinite in Old English.         Now, in building of chaises, I tell you _what_,       There is always somewhere a weakest spot.      Exercise.--Find sentences with six indefinite pronouns.      137. Some indefinite pronouns are inflected for case, as shown in  the words _everybody's_, _anybody else's_, etc.    See also \"Syntax\" (Sec. 426) as to the possessive case of the forms  with _else_.        HOW TO PARSE PRONOUNS.      [Sidenote: _A reminder._]    138. In parsing pronouns the student will need particularly to  guard against the mistake of parsing words according to _form_ instead  of according to function or use.      Exercise.    Parse in full the pronouns in the following sentences:--         1. She could not help laughing at the vile English into which       they were translated.         2. Our readers probably remember what Mrs. Hutchinson tells us of       herself.         3. Whoever deals with M. de Witt must go the plain way that he       pretends to, in his negotiations.         4. Some of them from whom nothing was to be got, were suffered to       depart; but those from whom it was thought that anything could be       extorted were treated with execrable cruelty.         5. All was now ready for action.         6. Scarcely had the mutiny broken up when he was himself again.         7. He came back determined to put everything to the hazard.         8. Nothing is more clear than that a general ought to be the       servant of his government, and of no other.         9. Others did the same thing, but not to quite so enormous an       extent.         10. On reaching the approach to this about sunset of a beautiful       evening in June, I first found myself among the mountains,--a       feature of natural scenery for which, from my earliest days, it       was not extravagant to say that I hungered and thirsted.         11. I speak of that part which chiefly it is that I know.         12. A smaller sum I had given to my friend the attorney (who was       connected with the money lenders as their lawyer), to which,       indeed, he was entitled for his unfurnished lodgings.         13. Whatever power the law gave them would be enforced against       me to the utmost.         14. O thou that rollest above, round as the shield of my fathers!         15. But there are more than you ever heard of who die of grief in       this island of ours.         16. But amongst themselves is no voice nor sound.         17. For this did God send her a great reward.         18. The table was good; but that was exactly what Kate cared       little about.         19. Who and what was Milton? That is to say, what is the place       which he fills in his own vernacular literature?         20. These hopes are mine as much as theirs.         21. What"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1401"],[0,"Tarzan the Untamed (#14)"],[1,"and, as there could  be no doubt that he considered her part of his prey, he would  certainly come back for her, or possibly drag her in first and kill  her.    Again Numa fell to feeding. The girl's nerves were at the breaking  point. She wondered that she had not fainted under the strain  of terror and shock. She recalled that she often had wished she  might see a lion, close to, make a kill and feed upon it. God! how  realistically her wish had been granted.    Again she bethought herself of her pistol. As she had fallen, the  holster had slipped around so that the weapon now lay beneath her.  Very slowly she reached for it; but in so doing she was forced to  raise her body from the ground.  Instantly the lion was aroused.  With the swiftness of a cat he reached across the carcass of the  horse and placed a heavy, taloned paw upon her breast, crushing her  back to earth, and all the time he growled and snarled horribly.  His face was a picture of frightful rage incarnate. For a moment  neither moved and then from behind her the girl heard a human voice  uttering bestial sounds.    Numa suddenly looked up from the girl's face at the thing beyond  her. His growls increased to roars as he drew back, ripping the  front of the girl's waist almost from her body with his long talons,  exposing her white bosom, which through some miracle of chance the  great claws did not touch.    Tarzan of the Apes had witnessed the entire encounter from the  moment that Numa had leaped upon his prey. For some time before,  he had been watching the girl, and after the lion attacked her he  had at first been minded to let Numa have his way with her. What  was she but a hated German and a spy besides? He had seen her at  General Kraut's headquarters, in conference with the German staff  and again he had seen her within the British lines masquerading as  a British officer. It was the latter thought that prompted him to  interfere. Doubtless General Jan Smuts would be glad to meet and  question her. She might be forced to divulge information of value  to the British commander before Smuts had her shot.    Tarzan had recognized not only the girl, but the lion as well.  All  lions may look alike to you and me; but not so to their intimates  of the jungle. Each has his individual characteristics of face and  form and gait as well defined as those that differentiate members  of the human family, and besides these the creatures of the jungle  have a still more positive test--that of scent. Each of us, man or  beast, has his own peculiar odor, and it is mostly by this that  the beasts of the jungle, endowed with miraculous powers of scent,  recognize individuals.    It is the final proof. You have seen it demonstrated a thousand  times--a dog recognizes your voice and looks at you.  He knows your  face and figure. Good, there can be no doubt in his mind but that  it is you; but is he satisfied? No, sir--he must come up and smell  of you. All his other senses may be fallible, but not his sense of  smell, and so he makes assurance positive by the final test.    Tarzan recognized Numa as he whom he had muzzled with the hide of  Horta, the boar--as he whom he handled by a rope for two days and  finally loosed in a German front-line trench, and he knew that Numa  would recognize him--that he would remember the sharp spear that  had goaded him into submission and obedience and Tarzan hoped that  the lesson he had learned still remained with the lion.    Now he came forward calling to Numa in the language of the great  apes--warning him away from the girl. It is open to question that  Numa, the lion, understood him; but he did understand the menace of  the heavy spear that the Tarmangani carried so ready in his brown,  right hand, and so he drew back, growling, trying to decide in his  little brain whether to charge or flee.    On came the ape-man with never a pause, straight for the lion. \"Go  away, Numa,\" he cried, \"or Tarzan will tie you up again and lead  you through the jungle without food. See Arad, my spear! Do you  recall how his point stuck into you and how with his haft I beat  you over the head? Go, Numa!  I am Tarzan of the Apes!\"    Numa wrinkled the skin of his face into great folds, until his  eyes almost disappeared and he growled and roared and snarled and  growled again, and when the spear point came at last quite close  to him he struck at it viciously with his armed paw; but he drew  back. Tarzan stepped over the dead horse and the girl lying behind  him gazed in wide-eyed astonishment at the handsome figure driving  an angry lion deliberately from its kill.    When Numa had retreated a few yards, the ape-man called back to  the girl in perfect German, \"Are you badly hurt?\"    \"I think not,\" she replied; \"but I cannot extricate my foot from  beneath my horse.\"    \"Try again,\" commanded Tarzan. \"I do not know how long I can hold  Numa thus.\"    The girl struggled frantically; but at last she sank back upon an  elbow.    \"It is impossible,\" she called to him.    He backed slowly until he was again beside the horse, when he  reached down and grasped the cinch, which was still intact.  Then  with one hand he raised the carcass from the ground.  The girl  freed herself and rose to her feet.    \"You can walk?\" asked Tarzan.    \"Yes,\" she said; \"my leg is numb; but it does not seem to be  injured.\"    \"Good,\" commented the ape-man. \"Back slowly away behind me--make  no sudden movements. I think he will not charge.\"    With utmost deliberation the two backed toward the bush.  Numa  stood for a moment, growling, then he followed them, slowly. Tarzan  wondered if he would come beyond his kill or if he would stop there.  If he followed them beyond, then they could look for a charge, and  if Numa charged it was very likely that he would get one of them.  When the lion reached the carcass of the horse Tarzan stopped and  so did Numa, as Tarzan had thought that he would and the ape-man  waited to see what the lion would do next. He eyed them for a  moment, snarled angrily and then looked down at the tempting meat.  Presently he crouched upon his kill and resumed feeding.    The girl breathed a deep sigh of relief as she and the ape-man  resumed their slow retreat with only an occasional glance from the  lion, and when at last they reached the bush and had turned and  entered it, she felt a sudden giddiness overwhelm her so that she  staggered and would have fallen had Tarzan not caught her. It was  only a moment before she regained control of herself.    \"I could not help it,\" she said, in half apology. \"I was so close  to death--such a horrible death--it unnerved me for an instant;  but I am all right now. How can I ever thank you?  It was so  wonderful--you did not seem to fear the frightful creature in the  least; yet he was afraid of you. Who are you?\"    \"He knows me,\" replied Tarzan, grimly--\"that is why he fears me.\"    He was standing facing the girl now and for the first time  he had a chance to look at her squarely and closely. She was very  beautiful--that was undeniable; but Tarzan realized her beauty only  in a subconscious way. It was superficial--it did not color her  soul which must be black as sin. She was German--a German spy. He  hated her and desired only to compass her destruction; but he would  choose the manner so that it would work most grievously against  the enemy cause.    He saw her naked breasts where Numa had torn her clothing from her  and dangling there against the soft, white flesh he saw that which  brought a sudden scowl of surprise and anger to his face--the  diamond-studded, golden locket of his youth--the love token that  had been stolen from the breast of his mate by Schneider, the Hun.  The girl saw the scowl but did not interpret it correctly. Tarzan  grasped her roughly by the arm.    \"Where did you get this?\" he demanded, as he tore the bauble from  her.    The girl drew herself to her full height. \"Take your hand from me,\"  she demanded, but the ape-man paid no attention to her words, only  seizing her more forcibly.    \"Answer me!\" he snapped. \"Where did you get this?\"    \"What is it to you?\" she countered.    \"It is mine,\" he replied. \"Tell me who gave it to you or I will  throw you back to Numa.\"    \"You would do that?\" she asked.    \"Why not?\" he queried. \"You are a spy and spies must die if they  are caught.\"    \"You were going to kill me, then?\"    \"I was going to take you to headquarters. They would dispose of  you there; but Numa can do it quite as effectively.  Which do you  prefer?\"    \"Hauptmann Fritz Schneider gave it to me,\" she said.    \"Headquarters it will be then,\" said Tarzan. \"Come!\" The girl  moved at his side through the bush and all the time her mind worked  quickly. They were moving east, which suited her, and as long as  they continued to move east she was glad to have the protection  of the great, white savage. She speculated much upon the fact that  her pistol still swung at her hip. The man must be mad not to take  it from her.    \"What makes you think I am a spy?\" she asked after a long silence.    \"I saw you at German headquarters,\" he replied, \"and then again  inside the British lines.\"    She could not let him take her back to them. She must reach  Wilhelmstal at once and she was determined to do so even if she  must have recourse to her pistol. She cast a side glance at the  tall figure. What a magnificent creature! But yet he was a brute  who would kill her or have her killed if she did not slay him. And  the locket! She must have that back--it must not fail to reach  Wilhelmstal. Tarzan was now a foot or two ahead of her as the path  was very narrow. Cautiously she drew her pistol. A single shot would  suffice and he was so close that she could not miss. As she figured  it all out her eyes rested on the brown skin with the graceful muscles  rolling beneath it and the perfect limbs and head and the carriage  that a proud king of old might have envied.
