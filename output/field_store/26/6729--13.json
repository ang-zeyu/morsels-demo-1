COLONEL.    You are trembling, my daughter. You are a woman, and let yourself be  too much affected by such trifles. I will not have you listen to these  tidings any longer. Go, my child! Why, your friend has won, there is  no reason for you to cry! Help her, Miss Adelaide!    IDA (_is led by_ ADELAIDE _to the side door on the left;  entreatingly_.)    Leave me! Stay with father!    SENDEN.    Upon my honor, the bad faith and arrogance with which this paper is  edited are no longer to be endured. Colonel, since we are alone--for  Miss Adelaide will let me count her as one of us--we have a chance to  take a striking revenge. Their days are numbered now. Quite a long  time ago, already, I had the owner of the _Union_ sounded. He is not  disinclined to sell the paper, but merely has scruples about the party  now controlling the sheet. At the club-fete I myself had a talk with  him.    ADELAIDE.    What's this I hear?    SENDEN.    This outcome of the election will cause the greatest bitterness among  all our friends, and I have no doubt that, in a few days, by forming a  stock company, we can collect the purchase price. That would be a  deadly blow to our opponents, a triumph for the good cause. The most  widely-read sheet in the province in our hands, edited by a  committee--    ADELAIDE.    To which Mr. von Senden would not refuse his aid--    SENDEN.    As a matter of duty I should do my part. Colonel, if you would be one  of the shareholders, your example would at once make the purchase a  sure thing.    COLONEL.    Sir, what you do to further your political ideas is your own affair.  Professor Oldendorf, however, has been a welcome guest in my house.  Never will I work against him behind his back. You would have spared  me this moment had you not previously deceived me by your assurances  as to the sentiments of the majority. However, I bear you no malice.  You acted from the best of motives, I am sure. I beg the company to  excuse me if I withdraw for today. I hope to see you tomorrow again,  dear Senden.    SENDEN.    Meanwhile I will start the fund for the purchase of the newspaper. I  bid you good day. [_Exit_.]    COLONEL.    Pardon me, Adelaide, if I leave you alone. I have some letters to  write, and [_with a forced laugh_] my newspapers to read.    ADELAIDE (_sympathetically_).    May I not stay with you now, of all times?    COLONEL (_with an effort_).    I shall be better off alone, now.    [_Exit through centre door_.]    ADELAIDE (_alone_).    My poor Colonel! Injured vanity is hard at work in his faithful soul.  And Ida. [_Gently opens the door on the left, remains standing_.] She  is writing. It is not difficult to guess to whom. [_Closes the door_.]  And for all of this mischief that evil spirit Journalism is to blame.  Everybody complains of it, and every one tries to use it for his own  ends. My Colonel scorned newspaper men until he became one himself,  and Senden misses no opportunity of railing at my good friends of  the pen, merely because he wishes to put himself in their place. I see  Piepenbrink and myself becoming journalists, too, and combining to  edit a little sheet under the title of _Naughty Bolz_. So the _Union_  is in danger of being secretly sold. It might be quite a good thing  for Conrad: he would then have to think of something else besides the  newspaper. Ah! the rogue would start a new one at once!    _Enter_ OLDENDORF _and_ CARL.    OLDENDORF (_while still outside of the room_).    And the Colonel will receive no one?    CARL.    No one, Professor. [_Exit_.]    ADELAIDE (_going up to_ OLDENDORF).    Dear Professor, this is not just the right moment for you to come. We  are very much hurt and out of sorts with the world, but most of all  with you.    OLDENDORF.    I am afraid you are, but I must speak to him.    _Enter_ IDA _through the door on the left_.    IDA (_going toward him_).    Edward! I knew you would come!    OLDENDORF.    My dear Ida! [_Embraces her_.]    IDA (_with her arms around his neck_).    And what will become of us now?    _Enter_ COLONEL _through centre door_.    COLONEL (_with forced calmness_).    You shall remain in no doubt about that, my daughter! I beg you,  Professor, to forget that you were once treated as a friend in this  household. I require you, Ida, to banish all thought of the hours when  this gentleman entertained you with his sentiments. (_More  violently_.) Be still! In my own house at least I submit to no attacks  from a journalist. Forget him, or forget that you are my daughter. Go  in there! [_Leads_ IDA, _not ungently, out to the left, and places  himself in front of the door_.] On this ground, Mr. Editor and Member  of Parliament, before the heart of my child, you shall not beat me.    [_Exit to the left_.]    ADELAIDE (_aside_).    Dear me! That is bad!    OLDENDORF (_as the_ COLONEL _turns to go, with determination_).    Colonel, it is ungenerous of you to refuse me this interview. [_Goes  toward the door_.]    ADELAIDE (_intercepting him quickly_).    Stop! No further! He is in a state of excitement where a single word  might do permanent harm. But do not leave us this way, Professor; give  me just a few moments.    OLDENDORF.    I must, in my present condition of mind, ask your indulgence. I have  long dreaded just such a scene, and yet I hardly feel able to control  myself.    ADELAIDE.    You know our friend; you know that his quick temper drives him into  acts for which later he would gladly atone.    OLDENDORF.    This was more than a fit of temper. It means a breach between us  two--a breach that seems to me beyond healing.    ADELAIDE.    Beyond healing, Professor! If your sentiments toward Ida are what I  think they are, healing is not so difficult. Would it not be fitting  for you even now--especially now--to accede to the father's wishes.  Does not the woman you love deserve that, for once at least, you  sacrifice your ambition!    OLDENDORF.    My ambition, yes; my duty, no.    ADELAIDE.    Your own happiness, Professor, seems to me to be ruined for a long  time, possibly forever, if you part from Ida in this way.    OLDENDORF (_gloomily_).    Not every one can be happy in his private life.    ADELAIDE.    This resignation does not please me at all, least of all in a man.  Pardon me for saying so, plainly. (_Ingratiatingly_.) Is the  misfortune so great if you become member for this town a few years  later, or even not at all?    OLDENDORF.    Miss Runeck, I am not conceited. I do not rate my abilities very high,  and, as far as I know myself, there is no ambitious impulse lurking at  the bottom of my heart. Possibly, as you do now, so a later age will  set a low estimate on our political wrangling, our party aims, and all  that that includes. Possibly all our labor will be without result;  possibly much of the good we hope to do will, when achieved, turn out  to be the opposite--yes, it is highly probable that my own share in  the struggle will often be painful, unedifying, and not at all what  you would call a grateful task; but all that must not keep me from  devoting my life to the strife and struggle of the age to which I  belong. That struggle, after all, is the best and noblest that the  present has to offer. Not every age permits its sons to achieve  results which remain great for all time; and, I repeat, not every age  can make those who live in it distinguished and happy.    ADELAIDE.    I think every age can accomplish that if the individuals will only  understand how to be great and happy. [_Rising_.] You, Professor, will  do nothing for your own little home-happiness. You force your friends  to act for you.    [Illustration: Permission F. Bruckmann, A.-G. Munich  IN THE BEERGARDEN   Adolph von Menzel]    OLDENDORF.    At all events cherish as little anger against me as possible, and  speak a good word for me to Ida.    ADELAIDE.    I shall set my woman's wits to aiding you, Mr. Statesman.    [_Exit_ OLDENDORF.]    ADELAIDE (_alone_).    So this is one of the noble, scholarly, free spirits of the German  nation! And he climbs into the fire from a sheer sense of duty! But to  conquer anything--the world, happiness, or even a wife--for that he  never was made!    _Enter_ CARL.    CARL (_announcing_).    Dr. Bolz!    ADELAIDE.    Ah! He at least will be no such paragon of virtue!--Where is the  Colonel?    CARL.    In Miss Ida's room.    ADELAIDE.    Show the gentleman in here.    [_Exit_ CARL.]    I feel somewhat embarrassed at seeing you again, Mr. Bolz; I shall  take pains to conceal it.    _Enter_ BOLZ.    BOLZ.    A poor soul has just left you, vainly seeking consolation in your  philosophy. I too come as an unfortunate, for yesterday I incurred  your displeasure; and but for your presence, which cut short a  vexatious scene, Mr. von Senden, in the interests of social propriety,  would doubtless have pitched into me still harder. I thank you for the  reminder you gave me; I take it as a sign that you will not withdraw  your friendly interest in me.    ADELAIDE (_aside_).    Very pretty, very diplomatic!--It is kind of you to put so good a  construction on my astonishing behavior. But pardon me if I presume to  interfere again; that scene with Mr. von Senden will not, I trust,  give provocation for a second one?    BOLZ (_aside_).    This eternal Senden! (_Aloud_.) Your interest in him furnishes me  grounds for avoiding further consequences. I think I can manage it.    ADELAIDE.    I thank you. And now let me tell you that you are a dangerous  diplomatist. You have inflicted a thorough defeat on this household.  On this unfortunate day but one thing has pleased me--the one vote  which sought to make you member of Parliament.    BOLZ.    It was a crazy idea of the honest wine-merchant.    ADELAIDE.    You took so much trouble to put your friend in, why did you not work  for yourself?

The great Chartist movement, though not supported by  the leaders of the local Liberal party, was taken up with a warmth  almost unequalled in any other town in the Kingdom, meetings being held  daily and nightly for months in succession, Feargus O'Connor, Henry  Vincent, and many other \"orators of the fiery tongue,\" taking part. On  the 13th of August, 1838, a monstre demonstration took place on Holloway  Head, at which it was reckoned there were over 100,000 persons present,  and a petition in favour of \"The Charter\" was adopted that received the  signatures of 95,000 people in a few days. The Chartist \"National  Convention\" met here May 13, 1839, and noisy assemblages almost daily  affrighted the respectable townsmen out of their propriety. It was  advised that the people should abstain from all exciseable articles, and  \"run for gold\" upon the savings banks--very good advice when given by  Attwood in 1832, but shockingly wicked in 1839 when given to people who  could have had but little in the savings or any other banks. This, and  the meetings which ensued, so alarmed the magistrates for the safety of  property that, in addition to swearing in hundreds of special  constables, they sent to London for a body of police. These arrived on  July 4, and unfortunately at the time a stormy meeting was being held in  the Bull Ring, which they were at once set to disperse, a work soon  accomplished by the free use they made of their staves. The indignant  Brums, however, soon rallied and drove the police into the Station,  several being wounded on either side. The latent fury thus engendered  burst out in full force on the 15th when the notorious Chartist Riots  commenced, but the scenes then enacted, disgraceful as they were, may  well be left in oblivion, especially as the best of \"the points\" of the  Charter are now part of the laws of the land. Besides many others who  were punished more or less, two of the leaders, Wm. Lovett and John  Collins, were sentenced to one year's imprisonment for a seditious libel  in saying that \"the people of Birmingham were the best judges of their  own rights to meet in the Bull Ring, and the best judges of their own  power and resources to obtain justice.\" On the 27th July, 1849, Lovett  and Collins were accorded a public welcome on their release from prison,  being met at the Angel by a crowd of vehicles, bands of music, &c., and  a procession (said to have numbered nearly 30,000), accompanied them to  Gosta Green where speeches were delivered; a dinner, at which 800  persons sat down, following on the site of \"The People's Hall of  Science,\" in Loveday Street. In 1841, Joseph Sturge gave in his adhesion  to some movement for the extension of the franchise to the working  classes, and at his suggestion a meeting was held at the Waterloo Rooms  (Feb. 25th, 1842), and a memorial to the Queen drawn up, which in less  than a month received 16,000 signatures. On the 5th of April, 87  delegates from various parts of England, Ireland, and Scotland,  assembled here, and after four days' sitting formed themselves into \"The  National Complete Suffrage Union,\" whose \"points\" were similar to those  of the Charter, viz., manhood suffrage, abolition of the property  qualification, vote by ballot, equal electoral districts, payment of  election expenses and of members, and annual Parliaments. On the 27th of  December, another Conference was held (at the Mechanics' Institute), at  which nearly 400 delegates were present, but the apple of discord had  been introduced, and the \"Complete Suffrage Union\" was pooh-poohed by  the advocates of \"the Charter, the whole Charter, and nothing but the  Charter,\" and our peace-loving townsman, whom _The Times_ had dubbed  \"the Birmingham Quaker Chartist,\" retired from the scene. From that time  until the final collapse of the Chartist movement, notwithstanding many  meetings were held, and strong language often used, Birmingham cannot be  said to have taken much part in it, though, in 1848 (August 15th),  George J. Mantle, George White, and Edward King, three local worthies in  the cause, found themselves in custody for using seditious language.    ~Chauntries.~--In 1330 Walter of Clodeshale, and in 1347 Richard of  Clodeshale, the \"Lords of Saltley,\" founded and endowed each a Chauntry  in old St. Martin's Church, wherein daily services should be performed  for themselves, their wives, and ancestors, in their passage through  purgatory. In like manner, in 1357, Philip de Lutteley gave to the  Lutteley chantry in Enville Church, a parcel of land called Morfe Woode,  \"for the health of his soul, and the souls of all the maintained of the  said chantry;\" and in 1370 he gave other lands to the chantry, \"for the  priest to pray at the altar of St. Mary for the health of his soul, and  Maud his wife, and of Sir Fulke de Birmingham,\" and of other benefactors  recited in the deed. It is to be devoutly hoped that the souls of the  devisees and their friends had arrived safely at their journeys' end  before Harry the Eighth's time, for he stopped the prayers by stopping  the supplies.    ~Cherry Street~ took its name from the large and fruitful cherry orchard  which we read of as being a favourite spot about the year 1794.    ~Chess.~--See \"_Sports and Sporting_.\"    ~Chicago Fire.~--The sum of L4,300 was subscribed and sent from here  towards relieving the sufferers by this calamity.    ~Children.~--A society known as \"The Neglected Children's Aid Society,\"  was founded in 1862, by Mr. Arthur Ryland, for the purpose of looking  after and taking care of children under fourteen found wandering or  begging, homeless or without proper guardianship. It was the means of  rescuing hundreds from the paths of dishonesty and wretchedness, but as  its work was in a great measure taken up by the School Board, the  society was dissolved Dec. 17, 1877. Mr. Thos. Middlemore, in 1872,  pitying the condition of the unfortunate waifs and strays known as  \"Street Arabs,\" took a house in St. Luke's Road for boys, and one in  Spring Road for girls, and here he has trained nearly a thousand poor  children in ways of cleanliness and good behaviour prior to taking the  larger part of them to Canada. A somewhat similar work, though on a  smaller scale, is being carried on by Mr. D. Smith, in connection with  the mission attached to the Bloomsbury Institution. In both instances  the children are found good homes, and placed with worthy people on  their arrival in Canada, and, with scarcely an exception all are doing  well. The total cost per head while at the Homes and including the  passage money is about L16, and subscriptions will be welcomed, so that  the work of the Institutions may be extended as much as possible.    ~Chimes.~--The earliest note we can find respecting the chimes in the  tower of St. Martin's is in a record dated 1552, which states there were  \"iiij belles, with a clocke, and a chyme.\"    ~Chimnies.~--Like all manufacturing towns Birmingham is pretty well  ornamented with tall chimnies, whose foul mouths belch forth clouds of  sooty blackness, but the loftiest and most substantial belongs to the  town itself. At the Corporation Wharf in Montague Street the \"stack\" is  258 feet in height, with a base 54 feet in circumference, and an inside  diameter of 12 feet. About 250,000 bricks were used in its construction,  which was completed in September, 1879.--Householders of an economical  turn must remember it is not always the cheapest plan to clean their  chimnies by \"burning them out,\" for in addition to the danger and risk  of damage by so doing, the authorities of Moor Street have the peculiar  custom of imposing a penalty (generally 10s.) when such cases are  brought before them. Should such an event occur by mischance keep all  doors and windows shut, and do not admit the sweeps who may come  knocking at your door, unless fully prepared with the half-crowns they  require as bribes not to tell the police. As a rule it is cheaper to  trust to \"Robert\" not seeing it.    ~China Temple Field~ was a noted place for amusements about the year  1820, and was situate where Cattell Road is now. Originally it formed  part of the grounds of Bordesley Hall, which was wrecked in the riots of  1791.    ~Choral Society.~--This Society held its first Choral Concert, August 2,  1836. The Festival Choral Society was established in 1845.    ~Cholera.~--This dreadful epidemic has never yet been felt in severity  in this town, though several fatal cases were reported in August, 1832.  In July, 1865, great alarm was caused by the fact of 243 inmates of the  Workhouse being attacked with choleraic symptoms, but they all  recovered.    ~Church Pastoral Aid Society.~--There is a local branch of this Society  here, and about L1,300 per annum is gathered in and forwarded to the  parent society, who in return grant sums in aid of the stipends of  thirty Curates and as many Scripture readers, amounting to nearly L4,700  per year.    ~Churchrates.~--Prior to 1831, Churchrates had been regularly levied,  and, to a great extent, cheerfully paid, but with the other reforms of  that Reforming age came the desire to re-form this impost, by doing away  with it altogether, and at a meeting held on August 7, 1832, the  ratepayers assembled not only denounced it, but petitioned Parliament  for its entire abolition. Between that year and 1837, Churchrates of 6d.  to 9d. in the L were not at all infrequent, but in the latter year there  was a sweet little row, which led to an"]]]
