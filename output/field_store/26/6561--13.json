In the year 1761, Thomas Jeffery published an account of a part of North  America, in which he lays open the miserable state of the slaves in the  West Indies, both as to their clothing, their food, their labour, and  their punishments. But, without going into particulars, the general  account be gives of them is affecting: \"It is impossible,\" he says, \"for  a human heart to reflect upon the slavery of these dregs of mankind,  without in some measure feeling for their misery, which ends but with  their lives--nothing can be more wretched than the condition of this  people.\"    Sterne, in his account of the Negro girl in his _Life of Tristram  Shandy_, took decidedly the part of the oppressed Africans. The  pathetic, witty, and sentimental manner, in which he handled this  subject, occasioned many to remember it, and procured a certain portion  of feeling in their favour.    Rousseau contributed not a little in his day to the same end.    Bishop Warburton, preached a sermon in the year 1766, before the Society  for the Propagation of the Gospel, in which he took up the cause of the  miserable Africans, and in which he severely reprobated their  oppressors. The language in this sermon is so striking, that I shall  make an extract from it. \"From the free savages,\" says he, \"I now come  to the savages in bonds. By these I mean the vast multitudes yearly  stolen from the opposite continent, and sacrificed by the colonists to  their great idol, the god of gain. But what then say these sincere  worshippers of Mammon? They are our own property which we offer  up,--Gracious God! to talk, as of herds of cattle, of property in  rational creatures, creatures endued with all our faculties, possessing  all our qualities but that of colour, our brethren both by nature and  grace, shocks all the feelings of humanity, and the dictates of common  sense? But, alas! what is there, in the infinite abuses of society,  which does not shock them! Yet nothing is more certain in itself and  apparent to all, than that the infamous traffic for slaves directly  infringes both divine and human law. Nature created man free, and grace  invites him to assert his freedom.    \"In excuse of this violation it hath been pretended, that though,  indeed, these miserable outcasts of humanity be torn from their homes  and native country by fraud and violence, yet they thereby become the  happier, and their condition the more eligible. But who are you, who  pretend to judge of another man's happiness; that state which each man  under the guidance of his Maker forms for himself, and not one man for  another? To know what constitutes mine or your happiness is the sole  prerogative of him who created us, and cast us in so various and  different moulds. Did your slaves ever complain to you of their  unhappiness amidst their native woods and deserts? or rather let me ask,  did they ever cease complaining of their condition under you their  lordly masters, where they see, indeed, the accommodations of civil  life, but see them all pass to others, themselves unbenefited by them?  Be so gracious then, ye petty tyrants over human freedom, to let your  slaves judge for themselves, what it is which makes their own happiness,  and then see whether they do not place it in the return to their own  country, rather than in the contemplation of your grandeur, of which  their misery makes so large a part; a return so passionately longed for,  that, despairing of happiness here, that is, of escaping the chains of  their cruel task-masters, they console themselves with feigning it to be  the gracious reward of heaven in their future state.\"    About this time certain cruel and wicked practices, which must now be  mentioned, had arrived at such a height, and had become so frequent in  the metropolis, as to produce of themselves other coadjutors to the  cause.    Before the year 1700, planters, merchants, and others, resident in the  West Indies, but coming to England, were accustomed to bring with them  certain slaves to act as servants with them during their stay. The  latter, seeing the freedom and the happiness of servants in this  country, and considering what would be their own hard fate on their  return to the islands, frequently absconded. Their masters of course  made search after them, and often had them seized and carried away by  force. It was, however, thrown out by many on these occasions, that the  English laws did not sanction such proceedings, for that all persons who  were baptized became free. The consequence of this was, that most of the  slaves, who came over with their masters, prevailed upon some pious  clergyman to baptize them. They took of course godfathers of such  citizens as had the generosity to espouse their cause. When they were  seized they usually sent to these, if they had an opportunity, for their  protection. And in the result, their godfathers, maintaining that they  had been baptized, and that they were free on this account as well as by  the general tenour of the law of England, dared those who had taken  possession of them to send them out of the kingdom.    The planters, merchants, and others, being thus circumstanced, knew not  what to do. They were afraid of taking their slaves away by force, and  they were equally afraid of bringing any of the cases before a public  court. In this dilemma, in 1729, they applied to York and Talbot, the  attorney and solicitor-general for the time being, and obtained the  following strange opinion from them:--\"We are of opinion, that a slave  by coming from the West Indies into Great Britain or Ireland, either  with or without his master, does not become free, and that his master's  right and property in him is not thereby determined or varied, and that  baptism doth not bestow freedom on him, nor make any alteration in his  temporal condition in these kingdoms. We are also of opinion, that the  master may legally compel him to return again to the plantations.\"    This cruel and illegal opinion was delivered in the year 1729. The  planters, merchants, and others, gave it of course all the publicity in  their power. And the consequences were as might easily have been  apprehended. In a little time slaves absconding were advertised in the  London papers as runaways, and rewards offered for the apprehension of  them, in the same brutal manner as we find them advertised in the land  of slavery. They were advertised also, in the same papers, to be sold by  auction, sometimes by themselves, and at others with horses, chaises,  and harness? They were seized also by their masters, or by persons  employed by them, in the very streets, and dragged from thence to the  ships; and so unprotected now were these poor slaves, that persons in  nowise concerned with them began to institute a trade in their persons,  making agreements with captains of ships going to the West Indies to put  them on board at a certain price. This last instance shows how far human  nature is capable of going, and is an answer to those persons who have  denied that kidnapping in Africa was a source of supplying the Slave  Trade. It shows, as all history does from the time of Joseph, that where  there is a market for the persons of human beings, all kinds of  enormities will be practised to obtain them.    These circumstances then, as I observed before, did not fail of  producing new coadjutors in the cause. And first they produced that able  and indefatigable advocate, Mr. Granville Sharp. This gentleman is to be  distinguished from those who preceded him by this particular, that,  whereas these were only writers, he was both a writer and an actor in  the cause. In fact, he was the first labourer in it in England. By the  words \"actor\" and \"labourer,\" I mean that he determined upon a plan of  action in behalf of the oppressed Africans, to the accomplishment of  which he devoted a considerable portion of his time, talents, and  substance. What Mr. Sharp has done to merit the title of coadjutor in  this high sense, I shall now explain. The following is a short history  of the beginning and of the course of his labours:--    In the year 1765, Mr. David Lisle had brought over from Barbados  Jonathan Strong, an African slave, as his servant. He used the latter in  a barbarous manner at his lodgings in Wapping, but particularly by  beating him over the head with a pistol, which occasioned his head to  swell. When the swelling went down, a disorder fell into his eyes, which  threatened the loss of them. To this an ague and fever succeeded, and a  lameness in both his legs.    Jonathan Strong, having been brought into this deplorable situation, and  being therefore wholly useless, was left by his master to go whither he  pleased. He applied accordingly to Mr. William Sharp, the surgeon, for  his advice, as to one who gave up a portion of his time to the healing  of the diseases of the poor. It was here that Mr. Granville Sharp, the  brother of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10635"],[0,"Stories from the Italian Poets: with Lives of the Writers, Volume 2 (#14)"],[1," into the church when a boy. But his conduct to Ariosto  shewed him coarse and selfish; and those who say all they can for him  admit that he was proud and revengeful, and that nobody regretted him  when he died. He is said to have had a taste for mathematics, as his  brother had for mechanics. The truth seems to be, that he and the duke,  who lived in troubled times, and had to exert all their strength to  hinder Ferrara from becoming a prey to the court of Rome, were clever,  harsh men, of no grace or elevation of character, and with no taste but  for war; and if it had not been for their connexion with Ariosto, nobody  would have heard of them, except while perusing the annals of the time.  Ippolito might have been, and probably was, the ruffian which the  anecdote of his brother Giulio represents him; but the world would have  heard little of the villany, had he not treated a poet with contempt.    The admirers of our author may wonder how he could become the servant of  such a man, much more how he could praise him as he did in the great work  which he was soon to begin writing. But Ariosto was the son of a man who  had passed his life in the service of the family; he had probably been  taught a loyal blindness to its defects; gratuitous panegyrics of princes  had been the fashion of men of letters since the time of Augustus; and  the poet wanted help for his relatives, and was of a nature to take  the least show of favour for a virtue, till he had learnt, as he  unfortunately did, to be disappointed in the substance. It is not known  what his appointment was under the cardinal. Probably he was a kind of  gentleman of all work; an officer in his guards, a companion to amuse,  and a confidential agent for the transaction of business. The employment  in which he is chiefly seen is that of an envoy, but he is said also to  have been in the field of battle; and he intimates in his _Satires_,  that household attentions were expected of him which he was not quick  to offer, such as pulling off his eminence's boots, and putting on  his spurs.[9] It is certain that he was employed in very delicate  negotiations, sometimes to the risk of his life from the perils of roads  and torrents. Ippolito, who was a man of no delicacy, probably made use  of him on every occasion that required address, the smallest as well  as greatest,--an interview with a pope one day, and a despatch to a  dog-fancier the next.    His great poem, however, proceeded. It was probably begun before he  entered the cardinal's service; certainly was in progress during the  early part of his engagement. This appears from a letter written to  Ippolito by his sister the Marchioness of Mantua, to whom he had sent  Ariosto at the beginning of the year 1509 to congratulate her on the  birth of a child. She gives her brother special thanks for sending his  message to her by \"Messer Ludovico Ariosto,\" who had made her, she says,  pass two delightful days, with giving her an account of the poem he was  writing.[10] Isabella was the name of this princess; and the grateful  poet did not forget to embalm it in his verse.[11]    Ariosto's latest biographer, Panizzi, thinks he never served under any  other leader than the cardinal; but I cannot help being of opinion with a  former one, whom he quotes, that he once took arms under a captain of the  name of Pio, probably a kinsman of his friend Alberto Pio, to whom he  addresses a Latin poem. It was probably on occasion of some early disgust  with the cardinal; but I am at a loss to discover at what period of time.  Perhaps, indeed, he had the cardinal's permission, both to quit his  service, and return to it. Possibly he was not to quit it at all, except  according to events; but merely had leave given him to join a party in  arms, who were furthering Ippolito's own objects. Italy was full of  captains in arms and conflicting interests. The poet might even, at some  period of his life, have headed a troop under another cardinal, his  friend Giovanni de' Medici, afterwards Leo the Tenth. He had certainly  been with him in various parts of Italy; and might have taken part in  some of his bloodless, if not his most military, equitations.    Be this as it may, it is understood that Ariosto was present at the  repulse given to the Venetians by Ippolito, when they came up the river  Po against Ferrara towards the close of the year 1509; though he was away  from the scene of action at his subsequent capture of their flotilla, the  poet having been despatched between the two events to Pope Julius the  Second on the delicate business of at once appeasing his anger with the  duke for resisting his allies, and requesting his help to a feudatary of  the church. Julius was in one of his towering passions at first, but  gave way before the address of the envoy, and did what he desired. But  Ariosto's success in this mission was nearly being the death of him in  another; for Alfonso having accompanied the French the year following  in their attack on Vicenza, where they committed cruelties of the same  horrible kind as have shocked Europe within a few months past,[12] the  poet's tongue, it was thought, might be equally efficacious a second  time; but Julius, worn out of patience with his too independent vassal,  who maintained an alliance with the French when the pope had ceased to  desire it, was to be appeased no longer. He excommunicated Alfonso, and  threatened to pitch his envoy into the Tiber; so that the poet was fain  to run for it, as the duke himself was afterwards, when he visited Rome  to be absolved. Would Julius have thus treated Ariosto, could he have  foreseen his renown? Probably he would. The greater the opposition to the  will, the greater the will itself. To chuck an accomplished envoy into  the river would have been much; but to chuck the immortal poet there,  laurels and all, in the teeth of the amazement of posterity, would have  been a temptation irresistible.    It was on this occasion that Ariosto, probably from inability to choose  his times or anodes of returning home, contracted a cough, which is  understood to have shortened his existence; so that Julius may have  killed him after all. But the pope had a worse enemy in his own  bosom--his violence--which killed himself in a much shorter period. He  died in little more than two years afterwards; and the poet's prospects  were all now of a very different sort--at least he thought so; for in  March 1513, his friend Giovanni de' Medici succeeded to the papacy, under  the title of Leo the Tenth.    Ariosto hastened to Rome, among a shoal of visitants, to congratulate the  new pope, perhaps not without a commission from Alfonso to see what he  could do for his native country, on which the rival Medici family never  ceased to have designs. The poet was full of hope, for he had known Leo  under various fortunes; had been styled by him not only a friend, but a  brother; and promised all sorts of participations of his prosperity. Not  one of them came. The visitor was cordially received. Leo stooped from  his throne, squeezed his hand, and kissed him on both his cheeks; but \"at  night,\" says Ariosto, \"I went all the way to the Sheep to get my supper,  wet through.\" All that Leo gave him was a \"bull,\" probably the one  securing to him the profits of his _Orlando;_ and the poet's friend  Bibbiena--wit, cardinal, and kinsman of Berni--facilitated the bull, but  the receiver discharged the fees. He did not get one penny by promise,  pope, or friend.[13] He complains a little, but all in good humour; and  good-naturedly asks what he was to expect, when so many hungry kinsmen  and partisans were to be served first. Well and wisely asked too, and  with a superiority to his fortunes which Leo and Bibbiena might have  envied.    It is thought probable, however, that if the poet had been less a friend  to the house of Este, Leo would have kept his word with him, for their  intimacy had undoubtedly been of the most cordial description. But it is  supposed that Leo was afraid he should have a Ferrarese envoy constantly  about him, had he detained Ariosto in Rome. The poet, however, it is  admitted, was not a good hunter of preferment. He could not play the  assenter, and bow and importune: and sovereigns, however friendly they  may have been before their elevation, go the way of most princely flesh  when they have attained it. They like to take out a man's gratitude  beforehand, perhaps because they feel little security in it afterwards.    The elevation to the papacy of the cheerful and indulgent son of Lorenzo  de' Medici, after the troublous reign of Julius, was hailed with delight  by all Christendom, and nowhere more so than in the pope's native place,  Florence. Ariosto went there to see the spectacles; and there, in the  midst of them, he found himself robbed of his heart by the lady whom he  afterwards married. Her name was Alessandra Benucci. She was the widow of  one of the Strozzi family, whom he had known in Ferrara, and he had long  admired her. The poet, who, like Petrarch and Boccaccio, has recorded the  day on which he fell in love, which was that of St. John the Baptist (the  showy saint-days of the south offer special temptations to that effect),  dwells with minute fondness on the particulars of the lady's appearance.  Her dress was black silk, embroidered with two grape-bearing vines  intertwisted; and \"between her serene forehead and the path that went  dividing in two her rich and golden tresses,\" was a sprig of laurel in  bud. Her observer, probably her welcome if not yet accepted lover, beheld  something very significant in this attire; and a mysterious poem, in  which he records a device of a black pen feathered with gold, which he  wore embroidered on a gown of his own, has been supposed to allude to it.  As every body is tempted to make his guess on such occasions, I take the  pen to have been the black-haired poet himself, and the golden "]]]
