Thrice more, at intervals, he repeated this performance. The only result  was to daub with mud every possible side of that bale. I hope it was his  property.    You must remember that I was observing the heavy artillery of the attack  on the conflagration. Individual campaigns were everywhere in progress.  I saw one man standing on the roof of a threatened building. He lowered  slowly, hand over hand, a small tea-kettle at the end of a string. This  was filled by a friend in the street, whereupon the man hauled it up  again, slowly, hand over hand, and solemnly dashed its contents into the  mouth of the furnace. Thousands of other men on roofs, in balconies, on  the street, were doing the same thing. Some had ordinary cups which they  filled a block away! The limit of efficiency was a pail. Nobody did  anything in concert with anybody else. The sight of these thousands of  little midgets each with his teacup, or his teapot, or his tin pail,  throwing each his mite of water--for which he had to walk a street or  so--into the ravening roaring furnace of flame was as pathetic or as  comical as you please. They did not seem to have a show in the world.    Nevertheless, to my vast surprise, the old system of the East triumphed  at last. The system of the East is that if you get _enough_ labour you  can accomplish anything. Little by little those thousands of tea kettles  of water had their aggregate effect. The flames fed themselves out and  died down leaving the contiguous buildings unharmed save for a little  scorching. In two hours all was safe, and I returned to the hotel,  having enjoyed myself hugely. I had, however, in the interest and  excitement, forgotten how deadly is the fever of Mombasa. Midnight in  pyjamas did the business; and shortly I paid well for the fun.          PART III.    NAIROBI.              XIII.    UP FROM THE COAST.      Nairobi is situated at the far edge of the great Athi Plains and just  below a range of hills. It might about as well have been anywhere else,  and perhaps better a few miles back in the higher country. Whether the  funny little narrow-gauge railroad exists for Nairobi, or Nairobi for  the railroad, it would be difficult to say. Between Mombasa and this  interior placed-to-order town, certainly, there is nothing, absolutely  nothing, either in passengers or freight, to justify building the line.  That distance is, if I remember it correctly, about three hundred and  twenty miles. A dozen or so names of stations appear on the map. These  are water tanks, telegraph stations, or small groups of tents in which  dwell black labourers--on the railroad.    The way climbs out from the tropical steaming coast belt to and across  the high scrub desert, and then through lower rounded hills to the  plains. On the desert is only dense thorn brush--and a possibility that  the newcomer, if he looks very closely, may to his excitement see his  first game in Africa. This is a stray duiker or so, tiny grass antelopes  a foot high. Also in this land is thirst; so that alongside the  locomotives, as they struggle up grade, in bad seasons, run natives to  catch precious drops.[5] An impalpable red dust sifts through and into  everything. When a man descends at Voi for dinner he finds his  fellow-travellers have changed complexion. The pale clerk from indoor  Mombasa has put on a fine healthy sunburn; and the company in general  present a rich out-of-doors bloom. A chance dab with a white napkin  comes away like fresh paint, however.    You clamber back into the compartment, with its latticed sun shades and  its smoked glass windows; you let down the narrow canvas bunk; you  unfold your rug, and settle yourself for repose. It is a difficult  matter. Everything you touch is gritty. The air is close and stifling,  like the smoke-charged air of a tunnel. If you try to open a window you  are suffocated with more of the red dust. At last you fall into a doze;  to awaken nearly frozen! The train has climbed into what is, after weeks  of the tropics, comparative cold; and if you have not been warned to  carry wraps, you are in danger of pneumonia.    The gray dawn comes, and shortly, in the sudden tropical fashion, the  full light. You look out on a wide smiling grass country, with dips and  swales, and brushy river bottoms, and long slopes and hills thrusting up  in masses from down below the horizon, and singly here and there in the  immensities nearer at hand. The train winds and doubles on itself up the  gentle slopes and across the imperceptibly rising plains. But the  interest is not in these wide prospects, beautiful and smiling as they  may be, but in the game. It is everywhere. Far in the distance the herds  twinkle, half guessed in the shimmer of the bottom lands or dotting the  sides of the hills. Nearer at hand it stares as the train rumbles and  sways laboriously past. Occasionally it even becomes necessary to  whistle aside some impertinent kongoni that has placed himself between  the metals! The newcomer has but a theoretical knowledge at best of all  these animals; and he is intensely interested in identifying the various  species. The hartebeeste and the wildebeeste he learns quickly enough,  and of course the zebra and the giraffe are unmistakable; but the  smaller gazelles are legitimate subjects for discussion. The wonder of  the extraordinary abundance of these wild animals mounts as the hours  slip by. At the stops for water or for orders the passengers gather from  their different compartments to detail excitedly to each other what they  have seen. There is always an honest superenthusiast who believes he has  seen rhinoceroses, lions, or leopards. He is looked upon with envy by  the credulous, and with exasperation by all others.    So the little train puffs and tugs along. Suddenly it happens on a  barbed wire fence, and immediately after enters the town of Nairobi. The  game has persisted right up to that barbed wire fence.    The station platform is thronged with a heterogeneous multitude of  people. The hands of a dozen raggetty black boys are stretched out for  luggage. The newcomer sees with delight a savage with a tin can in his  stretched ear lobe; another with a set of wooden skewers set fanwise  around the edge of the ear; he catches a glimpse of a beautiful naked  creature very proud, very decorated with beads and heavy polished wire.  Then he is ravished away by the friend, or agent, or hotel  representative who has met him, and hurried out through the gates  between the impassive and dignified Sikh sentries to the cab. I believe  nobody but the newcomer ever rides in the cab; and then but once, from  the station to the hotel. After that he uses rickshaws. In fact it is  probable that the cab is maintained for the sole purpose of giving the  newcomer a grand and impressive entrance. This brief fleeting quarter  hour of glory is unique and passes. It is like crossing the Line, or the  first kiss, something that in its nature cannot be repeated.    The cab was once a noble vehicle, compounded of opulent curves, with a  very high driver's box in front, a little let-down bench, and a deep,  luxurious, shell-shaped back seat, reclining in which one received the  adulation of the populace. That was in its youth. Now in its age the  varnish is gone; the upholstery of the back seat frayed; the upholstery  of the small seat lacking utterly, so that one sits on bare boards. In  place of two dignifiedly spirited fat white horses, it is drawn by two  very small mules in a semi-detached position far ahead. And how it  rattles!    Between the station and the hotel at Nairobi is a long straight wide  well-made street, nearly a mile long, and bordered by a double row of  young eucalyptus. These latter have changed the main street of Nairobi  from the sunbaked array of galvanized houses described by travellers of  a half dozen years back to a thoroughfare of great charm. The iron  houses and stores are now in a shaded background; and the attention is  freed to concentrate on the vivid colouring, the incessant movement, the  great interest of the people moving to and fro. When I left Nairobi the  authorities were considering the removal of these trees, because one row  of them had been planted slightly within the legal limits of the street.  What they could interfere with in a practically horseless town I cannot  imagine, but I trust this stupidity gave way to second thought.    The cab rattles and careers up the length of the street, scattering  rickshaws and pedestrians from before its triumphant path. To the left  opens a wide street of little booths under iron awnings, hung with gay  colour and glittering things. The street is thronged from side to side  with natives of all sorts. It whirls past, and shortly after the cab  dashes inside a fence and draws up before the low stone-built,  wide-verandahed hotel.

It has been, as I have said, the fashion to speak of Nairobi as an ugly  little town. This was probably true when the first corrugated iron  houses huddled unrelieved near the railway station. It is not true now.  The lower part of town is well planted, and is always picturesque as  long as its people are astir. The white population have built in the  wooded hills some charming bungalows surrounded by bright flowers or  lost amid the trunks of great trees. From the heights on which is  Government House one can, with a glass, watch the game herds feeding on  the plains. Two clubs, with the usual games of golf, polo,  tennis--especially tennis--football and cricket; a weekly hunt, with  jackals instead of foxes; a bungalow town club on the slope of a hill;  an electric light system; a race track; a rifle range; frilly parasols  and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14460"],[0,"Faust: a Tragedy [part 1], Translated from the German of Goethe (#14)"],[1,"a heavenly kingdom slime!  And here!        [_He lifts a bed-curtain_.]  What blissful awe my heart thrills through!  Here for long hours could I linger.  Here, Nature! in light dreams, thy airy finger  The inborn angel's features drew!  Here lay the child, when life's fresh heavings  Its tender bosom first made warm,  And here with pure, mysterious weavings  The spirit wrought its godlike form!    And thou! What brought thee here? what power  Stirs in my deepest soul this hour?  What wouldst thou here? What makes thy heart so sore?  Unhappy Faust! I know thee thus no more.    Breathe I a magic atmosphere?  The will to enjoy how strong I felt it,--  And in a dream of love am now all melted!  Are we the sport of every puff of air?    And if she suddenly should enter now,  How would she thy presumptuous folly humble!  Big John-o'dreams! ah, how wouldst thou  Sink at her feet, collapse and crumble!    _Mephistopheles_. Quick, now! She comes! I'm looking at her.    _Faust_. Away! Away! O cruel fate!    _Mephistopheles_. Here is a box of moderate weight;  I got it somewhere else--no matter!  Just shut it up, here, in the press,  I swear to you, 'twill turn her senses;  I meant the trifles, I confess,  To scale another fair one's fences.  True, child is child and play is play.    _Faust_. Shall I? I know not.    _Mephistopheles_. Why delay?  You mean perhaps to keep the bauble?  If so, I counsel you to spare  From idle passion hours so fair,  And me, henceforth, all further trouble.  I hope you are not avaricious!  I rub my hands, I scratch my head--         [_He places the casket in the press and locks it up again_.]   (Quick! Time we sped!)--  That the dear creature may be led  And moulded by your will and wishes;  And you stand here as glum,  As one at the door of the auditorium,  As if before your eyes you saw  In bodily shape, with breathless awe,  Metaphysics and physics, grim and gray!  Away!          [_Exit_.]    _Margaret [with a lamp_]. It seems so close, so sultry here.          [_She opens the window_.]  Yet it isn't so very warm out there,  I feel--I know not how--oh dear!  I wish my mother 'ld come home, I declare!  I feel a shudder all over me crawl--  I'm a silly, timid thing, that's all!          [_She begins to sing, while undressing_.]      There was a king in Thule,      To whom, when near her grave,      The mistress he loved so truly      A golden goblet gave.        He cherished it as a lover,      He drained it, every bout;      His eyes with tears ran over,      As oft as he drank thereout.        And when he found himself dying,      His towns and cities he told;      Naught else to his heir denying      Save only the goblet of gold.        His knights he straightway gathers      And in the midst sate he,      In the banquet hall of the fathers      In the castle over the sea.        There stood th' old knight of liquor,      And drank the last life-glow,      Then flung the holy beaker      Into the flood below.        He saw it plunging, drinking      And sinking in the roar,      His eyes in death were sinking,      He never drank one drop more.              [_She opens the press, to put away her clothes,               and discovers the casket_.]    How in the world came this fine casket here?  I locked the press, I'm very clear.  I wonder what's inside! Dear me! it's very queer!  Perhaps 'twas brought here as a pawn,  In place of something mother lent.  Here is a little key hung on,  A single peep I shan't repent!  What's here? Good gracious! only see!  I never saw the like in my born days!  On some chief festival such finery  Might on some noble lady blaze.  How would this chain become my neck!  Whose may this splendor be, so lonely?              [_She arrays herself in it, and steps before the glass_.]  Could I but claim the ear-rings only!  A different figure one would make.  What's beauty worth to thee, young blood!  May all be very well and good;  What then? 'Tis half for pity's sake  They praise your pretty features.  Each burns for gold,  All turns on gold,--  Alas for us! poor creatures!                PROMENADE.            FAUST [_going up and down in thought_.] MEPHISTOPHELES _to him_.    _Mephistopheles_. By all that ever was jilted! By all the infernal fires!  I wish I knew something worse, to curse as my heart desires!    _Faust_. What griping pain has hold of thee?  Such grins ne'er saw I in the worst stage-ranter!    _Mephistopheles_. Oh, to the devil I'd give myself instanter,  If I were not already he!    _Faust_. Some pin's loose in your head, old fellow!  That fits you, like a madman thus to bellow!    _Mephistopheles_. Just think, the pretty toy we got for Peg,  A priest has hooked, the cursed plague I--  The thing came under the eye of the mother,  And caused her a dreadful internal pother:  The woman's scent is fine and strong;  Snuffles over her prayer-book all day long,  And knows, by the smell of an article, plain,  Whether the thing is holy or profane;  And as to the box she was soon aware  There could not be much blessing there.  \"My child,\" she cried, \"unrighteous gains  Ensnare the soul, dry up the veins.  We'll consecrate it to God's mother,  She'll give us some heavenly manna or other!\"  Little Margaret made a wry face; \"I see  'Tis, after all, a gift horse,\" said she;  \"And sure, no godless one is he  Who brought it here so handsomely.\"  The mother sent for a priest (they're cunning);  Who scarce had found what game was running,  When he rolled his greedy eyes like a lizard,  And, \"all is rightly disposed,\" said he,  \"Who conquers wins, for a certainty.  The church has of old a famous gizzard,  She calls it little whole lands to devour,  Yet never a surfeit got to this hour;  The church alone, dear ladies; _sans_ question,  Can give unrighteous gains digestion.\"    _Faust_. That is a general pratice, too,  Common alike with king and Jew.    _Mephistopheles_. Then pocketed bracelets and chains and rings  As if they were mushrooms or some such things,  With no more thanks, (the greedy-guts!)  Than if it had been a basket of nuts,  Promised them all sorts of heavenly pay--  And greatly edified were they.    _Faust_. And Margery?    _Mephistopheles_. Sits there in distress,  And what to do she cannot guess,  The jewels her daily and nightly thought,  And he still more by whom they were brought.    _Faust._ My heart is troubled for my pet.  Get her at once another set!  The first were no great things in their way.    _Mephistopheles._ O yes, my gentleman finds all child's play!    _Faust._ And what I wish, that mind and do!  Stick closely to her neighbor, too.  Don't be a devil soft as pap,  And fetch me some new jewels, old chap!    _Mephistopheles._ Yes, gracious Sir, I will with pleasure.      [_Exit_ FAUST.]  Such love-sick fools will puff away  Sun, moon, and stars, and all in the azure,  To please a maiden's whimsies, any day.      [_Exit._]                THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE.            MARTHA [_alone]._  My dear good man--whom God forgive!  He has not treated me well, as I live!  Right off into the world he's gone  And left me on the straw alone.  I never did vex him, I say it sincerely,  I always loved him, God knows how dearly.        [_She weeps_.]  Perhaps he's dead!--O cruel fate!--  If I only had a certificate!          _Enter_ MARGARET.  Dame Martha!    _Martha_. What now, Margery?    _Margaret_. I scarce can keep my knees from sinking!  Within my press, again, not thinking,  I find a box of ebony,  With things--can't tell how grand they are,--  More splendid than the first by far.    _Martha_. You must not tell it to your mother,  She'd serve it as she did the other.    _Margaret_. Ah, only look! Behold and see!    _Martha [puts them on her_]. Fortunate thing! I envy thee!    _Margaret._ Alas, in the street or at church I never  Could be seen on any account whatever.    _Martha._ Come here as often as you've leisure,  And prink yourself quite privately;  Before the looking-glass walk up and down at pleasure,  Fine times for both us 'twill be;  Then, on occasions, say at some great feast,  Can show them to the world, one at a time, at least.  A chain, and then an ear-pearl comes to view;  Your mother may not see, we'll make some pretext, too.    _Margaret._ Who could have brought both caskets in succession?  There's something here for just suspicion!      [_A knock._ ]  Ah, God! If that's my mother--then!    _Martha_ [_peeping through the blind_].  'Tis a strange gentleman--come in!        [_Enter_ MEPHISTOPHELES.]  Must, ladies, on your kindness reckon  To excuse the freedom I have taken;      [_Steps back with profound respect at seeing_ MARGARET.]  I would for Dame Martha Schwerdtlein inquire!    _Martha._ I'm she, what, sir, is your desire?    _Mephistopheles_ [_aside to her_]. I know your face, for now 'twill do;  A distinguished lady is visiting you.  For a call so abrupt be pardon meted,  This afternoon it shall be repeated.    _Martha [aloud]._ For all the world, think, child! my sakes!  The gentleman you for a lady takes.    _Margaret_. Ah, God! I am a poor young blood;  The gentleman is quite too good;  The jewels and trinkets are none of my own.    _Mephistopheles_. Ah, 'tis not the jewels and trinkets alone;  Her look is so piercing, so _distingue_!  How glad I am to be suffered to stay.    _Martha_. What bring you, sir? I long to hear--    _Mephistopheles_. Would I'd a happier tale for your ear!  I hope you'll forgive me this one for repeating:  Your husband is dead and sends you a greeting.    _Martha_. Is dead? the faithful heart! Woe! Woe!  My husband dead! I, too, shall go!    _Margaret_. Ah, dearest Dame, despair not thou!    _Mephistopheles_ Then, hear the mournful story now!    _Margaret_. Ah, keep me free from love forever,  I should never survive such a loss, no, never!    _Mephistopheles_. Joy and woe, woe and joy, must have each other.    _Martha_. Describe his closing hours to me!    _Mephistopheles_. In Padua lies"]]]
