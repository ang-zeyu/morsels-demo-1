And so shall thine heart avail thee, and thy mighty fateful hand,    And the Light that lay in the Branstock, the well-beloved brand.\"      Said the child: \"I shall do thy bidding, and for thee shall I strike the         stroke;    For I love thee, friend of my fathers, Wise Heart of the holy folk.\"      So spake the Son of Sigmund, and beheld no man anear,    And again was the night the midnight, and the twinkling flame shone clear    In the hush of the Glittering Heath; and alone went Sigmund's son    Till he came to the road of Fafnir, and the highway worn by one,    By the drift of the rain unfurrowed, by the windy years unrent,    And forth from the dark it came, and into the dark it went.      Great then was the heart of Sigurd, for there in the midmost he stayed,    And thought of the ancient fathers, and bared the bright blue blade,    That shone as a fleck of the day-light, and the night was all around.    Fair then was the Son of Sigmund as he toiled and laboured the ground;    Great, mighty he was in his working, and the Glittering Heath he clave,    And the sword shone blue before him as he dug the pit and the grave:    There he hid his hope from the night-tide and lay like one of the dead,    And wise and wary he bided; and the heavens hung over his head.      Now the night wanes over Sigurd, and the ruddy rings he sees,    And his war-gear's fair adornment, and the God-folk's images;    But a voice in the desert ariseth, a sound in the waste has birth,    A changing tinkle and clatter, as of gold dragged over the earth:    O'er Sigurd widens the day-light, and the sound is drawing close,    And speedier than the trample of speedy feet it goes;    But ever deemeth Sigurd that the sun brings back the day,    For the grave grows lighter and lighter and heaven o'erhead is grey.      But now, how the rattling waxeth till he may not heed nor hark!    And the day and the heavens are hidden, and o'er Sigurd rolls the dark,    As the flood of a pitchy river, and heavy-thick is the air    With the venom of hate long hoarded, and lies once fashioned fair:    Then a wan face comes from the darkness, and is wrought in man-like wise,    And the lips are writhed with laughter and bleared are the blinded eyes;    And it wandereth hither and thither, and searcheth through the grave    And departeth, leaving nothing, save the dark, rolled wave on wave    O'er the golden head of Sigurd and the edges of the sword,    And the world weighs heavy on Sigurd, and the weary curse of the Hoard;    Him-seemed the grave grew straiter, and his hope of life grew chill,    And his heart by the Worm was enfolded, and the bonds of the Ancient Ill.      Then was Sigurd stirred by his glory, and he strove with the swaddling of         Death;    He turned in the pit on the highway, and the grave of the Glittering Heath;    He laughed and smote with the laughter and thrust up over his head.    And smote the venom asunder and clave the heart of Dread;    Then he leapt from the pit and the grave, and the rushing river of blood,    And fulfilled with the joy of the War-God on the face of earth he stood    With red sword high uplifted, with wrathful glittering eyes;    And he laughed at the heavens above him for he saw the sun arise,    And Sigurd gleamed on the desert, and shone in the new-born light,    And the wind in his raiment wavered, and all the world was bright.      But there was the ancient Fafnir, and the Face of Terror lay    On the huddled folds of the Serpent, that were black and ashen-grey    In the desert lit by the sun; and those twain looked each on each,    And forth from the Face of Terror went a sound of dreadful speech:      \"Child, child, who art thou that hast smitten? bright child, of whence is         thy birth?\"      \"I am called the Wild-thing Glorious, and alone I wend on the earth.\"           *       *       *       *       *      \"What master hath taught thee of murder?--Thou hast wasted Fafnir's day.\"      \"I, Sigurd, knew and desired, and the bright sword learned the way.\"           *       *       *       *       *      \"I am blind, O Strong Compeller, in the bonds of Death and Hell.    But thee shall the rattling Gold and the red rings bring unto bane.\"      \"Yet the rings mine hand shall scatter, and the earth shall gather again.\"      \"Woe, woe! in the days passed over I bore the Helm of Dread,    I reared the Face of Terror, and the hoarded hate of the Dead:    I overcame and was mighty; I was wise and cherished my heart    In the waste where no man wandered, and the high house builded apart:    Till I met thine hand, O Sigurd, and thy might ordained from of old;    And I fought and fell in the morning, and I die far off from the Gold.\"           *       *       *       *       *      Then all sank into silence, and the Son of Sigmund stood    On the torn and furrowed desert by the pool of Fafnir's blood,    And the Serpent lay before him, dead, chilly, dull, and grey;    And over the Glittering Heath fair shone the sun and the day,    And a light wind followed the sun and breathed o'er the fateful place,    As fresh as it furrows the sea-plain or bows the acres' face.      _Sigurd slayeth Regin the Master of Masters on the Glittering Heath._      There standeth Sigurd the Volsung, and leaneth on his sword,    And beside him now is Greyfell and looks on his golden lord,    And the world is awake and living; and whither now shall they wend,    Who have come to the Glittering Heath, and wrought that deed to its end?    For hither comes Regin the Master from the skirts of the field of death.           *       *       *       *       *      Afoot he went o'er the desert, and he came unto Sigurd and stared    At the golden gear of the man, and the Wrath yet bloody and bared,    And the light locks raised by the wind, and the eyes beginning to smile,    And the lovely lips of the Volsung, and the brow that knew no guile;    And he murmured under his breath while his eyes grew white with wrath:      \"O who art thou, and wherefore, and why art thou in the path?\"      Then he turned to the ash-grey Serpent, and grovelled low on the ground,    And he drank of that pool of the blood where the stones of the wild were         drowned,    And long he lapped as a dog; but when he arose again,    Lo, a flock of the mountain-eagles that drew to the feastful plain;    And he turned and looked on Sigurd, as bright in the sun he stood,    A stripling fair and slender, and wiped the Wrath of the blood.           *       *       *       *       *      Then he scowled and crouched and darkened, and came to Sigurd and spake:    \"O child, thou hast slain my brother, and the Wrath is alive and awake.\"      \"Thou sayest sooth,\" said Sigurd, \"thy deed and mine is done:    But now our ways shall sunder, for here, meseemeth, the sun    Hath but little of deeds to do, and no love to win aback.\"           *       *       *       *       *      But Regin darkened before him, and exceeding grim was he grown,    And he spake: \"Thou hast slain my brother, and wherewith wilt thou atone?\"      \"Stand up, O Master,\" said Sigurd, \"O Singer of ancient days,    And take the wealth I have won thee, ere we wend on the sundering ways.    I have toiled and thou hast desired, and the Treasure is surely anear,    And thou hast wisdom to find it, and I have slain thy fear.\"      But Regin crouched and darkened: \"Thou hast slain my brother,\" he said.      \"Take thou the Gold,\" quoth Sigurd, \"for the ransom of my head!\"      Then Regin crouched and darkened, and over the earth he hung;    And he said: \"Thou hast slain my brother, and the Gods are yet but young.\"           *       *       *       *       *      And he spake: \"Thou hast slain my brother, and today shall thou be my         thrall:    Yea, a King shall be my cook-boy and this heath my cooking-hall.\"      Then he crept to the ash-grey coils where the life of his brother had lain,    And he drew a glaive from his side and smote the smitten and slain,    And tore the heart from Fafnir, while the eagles cried o'erhead,    And sharp and shrill was their voice o'er the entrails of the dead.      Then Regin spake to Sigurd: \"Of this slaying wilt thou be free?    Then gather thou fire together and roast the heart for me,    That I may eat it and live, and be thy master and more;    For therein was might and wisdom, and the grudged and hoarded lore:--    --Or else, depart on thy ways afraid from the Glittering Heath.\"      Then he fell abackward and slept, nor set his sword in the sheath.           *       *       *       *       *      But Sigurd took the Heart, and wood on the waste he found,    The wood that grew and died, as it crept"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13493"],[0,"The American Frugal Housewife (#14)"],[1,"long, as cherry pies.      APPLE PIE.    When you make apple pies, stew your apples very little indeed; just  strike them through, to make them tender. Some people do not stew  them at all, but cut them up in very thin slices, and lay them in  the crust. Pies made in this way may retain more of the spirit of the  apple; but I do not think the seasoning mixes in as well. Put in sugar  to your taste; it is impossible to make a precise rule, because apples  vary so much in acidity. A very little salt, and a small piece of  butter in each pie, makes them richer. Cloves and cinnamon are both  suitable spice. Lemon-brandy and rose-water are both excellent. A  wine-glass full of each is sufficient for three or four pies. If your  apples lack spirit, grate in a whole lemon.      CUSTARD PIE.    It is a general rule to put eight eggs to a quart of milk, in making  custard pies; but six eggs are a plenty for any common use. The  milk should be boiled and cooled before it is used; and bits of  stick-cinnamon and bits of lemon-peel boiled in it. Sweeten to your  taste with clean sugar; a very little sprinkling of salt makes them  taste better. Grate in a nutmeg. Bake in a deep plate. About 20  minutes are usually enough. If you are doubtful whether they are done,  dip in the handle of a silver spoon, or the blade of a small knife; if  it come out clean, the pie is done. Do not pour them into your plates  till the minute you put them into the oven; it makes the crust wet  and heavy. To be baked with an under crust only. Some people bake the  under crust a little before the custard is poured in; this is to keep  it from being clammy.      CRANBERRY PIE.    Cranberry pies need very little spice. A little nutmeg, or cinnamon,  improves them. They need a great deal of sweetening. It is well to  stew the sweetening with them; at least a part of it. It is easy to  add, if you find them too sour for your taste. When cranberries are  strained, and added to about their own weight in sugar, they make very  delicious tarts. No upper crust.      RHUBARB STALKS, OR PERSIAN APPLE.    Rhubarb stalks, or the Persian apple, is the earliest in gradient for  pies, which the spring offers. The skin should be carefully stripped,  and the stalks cut into small bits, and stewed very tender. These are  dear pies, for they take an enormous quantity of sugar. Seasoned like  apple pies Gooseberries, currants, &c., are stewed, sweetened and  seasoned like apple pies, in proportions suited to the sweetness of  the fruit; there is no way to judge but by your own taste. Always  remember it is more easy to add seasoning than to diminish it.      PIE CRUST.    To make pie crust for common use, a quarter of a pound of butter is  enough for a half a pound of flour. Take out about a quarter part of  the flour you intend to use, and lay it aside. Into the remainder of  the flour rub butter thoroughly with your hands, until it is so short  that a handful of it, clasped tight, will remain in a ball, without  any tendency to fall in pieces. Then wet it with cold water, roll it  out on a board, rub over the surface with flour, stick little lumps  of butter all over it, sprinkle some flour over the butter, and roll  the dough all up; flour the paste, and flour the rolling-pin; roll it  lightly and quickly; flour it again; stick in bits of butter; do it  up; flour the rolling-pin, and roll it quickly and lightly; and so  on, till you have used up your butter. Always roll from you. Pie crust  should be made as cold as possible, and set in a cool place; but be  careful it does not freeze. Do not use more flour than you can help in  sprinkling and rolling. The paste should not be rolled out more than  three times; if rolled too much, it will not be flaky.      COMMON CAKES.    In all cakes where butter or eggs are used, the butter should be very  faithfully rubbed into the flour, and the eggs beat to a foam, before  the ingredients are mixed.      GINGERBREAD.    A very good way to make molasses gingerbread is to rub four pounds and  a half of flour with half a pound of lard and half a pound of butter;  a pint of molasses, a gill of milk, tea-cup of ginger, a tea-spoonful  of dissolved pearlash stirred together. All mixed, baked in shallow  pans twenty or thirty minutes.    Hard gingerbread is good to have in the family, it keeps so well. One  pound of flour, half a pound of butter and sugar, rubbed into it; half  a pound of sugar; great spoonful of ginger, or more, according to the  strength of the ginger; a spoonful of rose-water, and a handful of  caraway seed. Well beat up. Kneaded stiff enough to roll out and bake  on flat pans. Bake twenty or thirty minutes.    A cake of common gingerbread can be stirred up very quick in the  following way. Rub in a bit of shortening as big as an egg into a  pint of flour; if you use lard, add a little salt; two or three great  spoonfuls of ginger; one cup of molasses, one cup and a half of cider,  and a great spoonful of dissolved pearlash, put together and poured  into the shortened flour while it is foaming; to be put in the oven in  a minute. It ought to be just thick enough to pour into the pans with  difficulty; if these proportions make it too thin, use less liquid the  next time you try. Bake about twenty minutes.    If by carelessness you let a piece of short-cake dough grow sour, put  in a little pearlash and water, warm a little butter, according to the  size of the dough, knead in a cup or two of sugar, (two cups, unless  it is a very small bit,) two or three spoonfuls of ginger, and a  little rose-water Knead it up thoroughly, roll it out on a flat pan,  and bake it twenty minutes. Every thing mixed with pearlash should be  put in the oven immediately.      CUP CAKE.    Cup cake is about as good as pound cake, and is cheaper. One cup of  butter, two cups of sugar, three cups of flour, and four eggs, well  beat together, and baked in pans or cups. Bake twenty minutes, and no  more.      TEA CAKE.    There is a kind of tea cake still cheaper. Three cups of sugar, three  eggs, one cup of butter, one cup of milk, a spoonful of dissolved  pearlash, and four cups of flour, well beat up. If it is so stiff it  will not stir easily, add a little more milk.      CIDER CAKE.    Cider cake is very good, to be baked in small loaves. One pound and  a half of flour, half a pound of sugar, quarter of a pound of butter,  half a pint of cider, one teaspoonful of pearlash; spice to your  taste. Bake till it turns easily in the pans. I should think about  half an hour.      ELECTION CAKE.    Old-fashioned election cake is made of four pounds of flour; three  quarters of a pound of butter; four eggs; one pound of sugar; one  pound of currants, or raisins if you choose; half a pint of good  yeast; wet it with milk as soft as it can be and be moulded on a  board. Set to rise over night in winter; in warm weather, three hours  is usually enough for it to rise. A loaf, the size of common flour  bread, should bake three quarters of an hour.      SPONGE CAKE.    The nicest way to make sponge cake, or diet-bread, is the weight  of six eggs in sugar, the weight of four eggs in flour, a little  rose-water. The whites and yolks should be beaten thoroughly and  separately. The eggs and sugar should be well beaten together; but  after the flour is sprinkled, it should not be stirred a moment longer  than is necessary to mix it well; it should be poured into the pan,  and got into the oven with all possible expedition. Twenty minutes is  about long enough to bake. Not to be put in till some other articles  have taken off the first few minutes of furious heat.      WEDDING CAKE.    Good common wedding cake may be made thus: Four pounds of flour, three  pounds of butter, three pounds of sugar, four pounds of currants,  two pounds of raisins, twenty-four eggs, half a pint of brandy, or  lemon-brandy, one ounce of mace, and three nutmegs. A little molasses  makes it dark colored, which is desirable. Half a pound of citron  improves it; but it is not necessary. To be baked two hours and a  half, or three hours. After the oven is cleared, it is well to shut  the door for eight or ten minutes, to let the violence of the heat  subside, before cake or bread is put in.    To make icing for your wedding cake, beat the whites of eggs to an  entire froth, and to each egg add five teaspoonfuls of sifted loaf  sugar, gradually; beat it a great while. Put it on when your cake is  hot, or cold, as is most convenient. It will dry in a warm room, a  short distance from a gentle fire, or in a warm oven.      LOAF CAKE.    Very good loaf cake is made with two pounds of flour, half a pound  of sugar, quarter of a pound of butter, two eggs, a gill of sweet  emptings, half an ounce of cinnamon, or cloves, a large spoonful of  lemon-brandy, or rose-water; if it is not about as thin as goad white  bread dough, add a little milk. A common sized loaf is made by these  proportions. Bake about three quarters of an hour.    A handy way to make loaf cake is, to take about as much of your white  bread dough, or sponge, as you think your pan will hold, and put it  into a pan in which you have already beat up three or four eggs, six  ounces of butter warmed, and half a pound of sugar, a spoonful of  rose-water, little sifted cinnamon, or cloves. The materials should be  well mixed and beat before the dough is put in; and then it should be  all kneaded well together, about as stiff as white bread. Put in half  a pound of currants, or raisins, with the butter, if you choose. It  should Stand in the pan two or three hours to rise; and be baked about  three quarters of an hour, if the pan is a common sized bread-pan.    If you have loaf cake slightly injured by time, or by being kept in  the cellar, cut off all appearance of mould from the outside, wipe  it with a clean cloth, and wet it well with strong brandy and water  sweetened with sugar; then put it in your oven, and let the heat "]]]
