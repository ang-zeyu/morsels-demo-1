He began feeling about the dark room, and was recalled to  the consequences of his position by the breaking of a large piece of  glass.  Having obtained a light, he discovered this to be a glass wheel,  part of an elaborate piece of mechanism which he must in his sleep have  taken from the chest, which was now opened.  He had once again opened it  whilst asleep, but he had no recollection of the circumstances.    Caswall came to the conclusion that there had been some sort of dual  action of his mind, which might lead to some catastrophe or some  discovery of his secret plans; so he resolved to forgo for a while the  pleasure of making discoveries regarding the chest.  To this end, he  applied himself to quite another matter--an investigation of the other  treasures and rare objects in his collections.  He went amongst them in  simple, idle curiosity, his main object being to discover some strange  item which he might use for experiment with the kite.  He had already  resolved to try some runners other than those made of paper.  He had a  vague idea that with such a force as the great kite straining at its  leash, this might be used to lift to the altitude of the kite itself  heavier articles.  His first experiment with articles of little but  increasing weight was eminently successful.  So he added by degrees more  and more weight, until he found out that the lifting power of the kite  was considerable.  He then determined to take a step further, and send to  the kite some of the articles which lay in the steel-hooped chest.  The  last time he had opened it in sleep, it had not been shut again, and he  had inserted a wedge so that he could open it at will.  He made  examination of the contents, but came to the conclusion that the glass  objects were unsuitable.  They were too light for testing weight, and  they were so frail as to be dangerous to send to such a height.    So he looked around for something more solid with which to experiment.  His eye caught sight of an object which at once attracted him.  This was  a small copy of one of the ancient Egyptian gods--that of Bes, who  represented the destructive power of nature.  It was so bizarre and  mysterious as to commend itself to his mad humour.  In lifting it from  the cabinet, he was struck by its great weight in proportion to its size.  He made accurate examination of it by the aid of some instruments, and  came to the conclusion that it was carved from a lump of lodestone.  He  remembered that he had read somewhere of an ancient Egyptian god cut from  a similar substance, and, thinking it over, he came to the conclusion  that he must have read it in Sir Thomas Brown's _Popular Errors_, a book  of the seventeenth century.  He got the book from the library, and looked  out the passage:    \"A great example we have from the observation of our learned friend Mr.  Graves, in an AEgyptian idol cut out of Loadstone and found among the  Mummies; which still retains its attraction, though probably taken out of  the mine about two thousand years ago.\"    The strangeness of the figure, and its being so close akin to his own  nature, attracted him.  He made from thin wood a large circular runner,  and in front of it placed the weighty god, sending it up to the flying  kite along the throbbing cord.          CHAPTER XIII--OOLANGA'S HALLUCINATIONS      During the last few days Lady Arabella had been getting exceedingly  impatient.  Her debts, always pressing, were growing to an embarrassing  amount.  The only hope she had of comfort in life was a good marriage;  but the good marriage on which she had fixed her eye did not seem to move  quickly enough--indeed, it did not seem to move at all--in the right  direction.  Edgar Caswall was not an ardent wooer.  From the very first  he seemed _difficile_, but he had been keeping to his own room ever since  his struggle with Mimi Watford.  On that occasion Lady Arabella had shown  him in an unmistakable way what her feelings were; indeed, she had made  it known to him, in a more overt way than pride should allow, that she  wished to help and support him.  The moment when she had gone across the  room to stand beside him in his mesmeric struggle, had been the very  limit of her voluntary action.  It was quite bitter enough, she felt,  that he did not come to her, but now that she had made that advance, she  felt that any withdrawal on his part would, to a woman of her class, be  nothing less than a flaming insult.  Had she not classed herself with his  nigger servant, an unreformed savage?  Had she not shown her preference  for him at the festival of his home-coming?  Had she not . . . Lady  Arabella was cold-blooded, and she was prepared to go through all that  might be necessary of indifference, and even insult, to become chatelaine  of Castra Regis.  In the meantime, she would show no hurry--she must  wait.  She might, in an unostentatious way, come to him again.  She knew  him now, and could make a keen guess at his desires with regard to Lilla  Watford.  With that secret in her possession, she could bring pressure to  bear on Caswall which would make it no easy matter for him to evade her.  The great difficulty was how to get near him.  He was shut up within his  Castle, and guarded by a defence of convention which she could not pass  without danger of ill repute to herself.  Over this question she thought  and thought for days and nights.  At last she decided that the only way  would be to go to him openly at Castra Regis.  Her rank and position  would make such a thing possible, if carefully done.  She could explain  matters afterwards if necessary.  Then when they were alone, she would  use her arts and her experience to make him commit himself.  After all,  he was only a man, with a man's dislike of difficult or awkward  situations.  She felt quite sufficient confidence in her own womanhood to  carry her through any difficulty which might arise.    From Diana's Grove she heard each day the luncheon-gong from Castra Regis  sound, and knew the hour when the servants would be in the back of the  house.  She would enter the house at that hour, and, pretending that she  could not make anyone hear her, would seek him in his own rooms.  The  tower was, she knew, away from all the usual sounds of the house, and  moreover she knew that the servants had strict orders not to interrupt  him when he was in the turret chamber.  She had found out, partly by the  aid of an opera-glass and partly by judicious questioning, that several  times lately a heavy chest had been carried to and from his room, and  that it rested in the room each night.  She was, therefore, confident  that he had some important work on hand which would keep him busy for  long spells.    Meanwhile, another member of the household at Castra Regis had schemes  which he thought were working to fruition.  A man in the position of a  servant has plenty of opportunity of watching his betters and forming  opinions regarding them.  Oolanga was in his way a clever, unscrupulous  rogue, and he felt that with things moving round him in this great  household there should be opportunities of self-advancement.  Being  unscrupulous and stealthy--and a savage--he looked to dishonest means.  He  saw plainly enough that Lady Arabella was making a dead set at his  master, and he was watchful of the slightest sign of anything which might  enhance this knowledge.  Like the other men in the house, he knew of the  carrying to and fro of the great chest, and had got it into his head that  the care exercised in its porterage indicated that it was full of  treasure.  He was for ever lurking around the turret-rooms on the chance  of making some useful discovery.  But he was as cautious as he was  stealthy, and took care that no one else watched him.    It was thus that the negro became aware of Lady Arabella's venture into  the house, as she thought, unseen.  He took more care than ever, since he  was watching another, that the positions were not reversed.  More than  ever he kept his eyes and ears open and his mouth shut.  Seeing Lady  Arabella gliding up the stairs towards his master's room, he took it for  granted that she was there for no good, and doubled his watching  intentness and caution.    Oolanga was disappointed, but he dared not exhibit any feeling lest it  should betray that he was hiding.  Therefore he slunk downstairs again  noiselessly, and waited for a more favourable opportunity of furthering  his plans.  It must be borne in mind that he thought that the heavy trunk  was full of valuables, and that he believed that Lady Arabella had come  to try to steal it.  His purpose of using for his own advantage the  combination of these two ideas was seen later in the day.  Oolanga  secretly followed her home.  He was an expert at this game, and succeeded  admirably on this occasion.  He watched her enter the private gate of  Diana's Grove, and then, taking a roundabout course and keeping out of  her sight, he at last overtook her in a thick part of the Grove where no  one could see the meeting.    Lady Arabella was much surprised.  She had not seen the negro for several  days, and had almost forgotten his existence.  Oolanga would have been  startled had he known and been capable of understanding the real value  placed on him, his beauty, his worthiness, by other persons, and compared  it with the value in these matters in which he held himself.  Doubtless  Oolanga had his dreams like other men.  In such cases he saw himself as a  young sun-god, as beautiful as the eye of dusky or even white womanhood  had ever dwelt upon.  He would have been filled with all noble and  captivating qualities--or those regarded as such in West Africa.  Women  would have loved him, and would have told him so in the overt and fervid  manner usual in affairs of the heart in the shadowy depths of the forest  of the Gold Coast.    Oolanga came close behind Lady Arabella, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11880"],[0,"Ronicky Doone (#14)"],[1,"Ronicky drew his gun and waited. \"Good,\" said the man of the sneer.  \"Go ahead.\"    \"It was down in the cellar that we found the first tracks. He came in  through the side window and closed it after him.\"    \"That dropped him into the coal bin. Did he get coal dust on his  shoes?\"    \"Right; and he didn't have sense enough to wipe it off.\"    \"An amateur--a rank amateur! I told you!\" said the man of the sneer,  with satisfaction. \"You followed his trail?\"    \"Up the stairs to the kitchen and down the hall and up to Harry's  room.\"    \"We already knew he'd gone there.\"    \"But he left that room again and came down the hall.\"    \"Yes. The coal dust was pretty well wiped off by that time, but we  held a light close to the carpet and got the signs of it.\"    \"And where did it lead?\"    \"Right to this room!\"    Ronicky stepped from among the smooth silks and pressed close to the  door of the closet, his hand on the knob. The time had almost come for  one desperate attempt to escape, and he was ready to shoot to kill.    A moment of pause had come, a pause which, in the imagination of  Ronicky, was filled with the approach of both the men toward the door  of the closet.    Then the man of the sneer said: \"That's a likely story!\"    \"I can show you the tracks.\"    \"H'm! You fool, they simply grew dim when they got to this door. I've  been here for some time. Go back and tell them to hunt some more. Go  up to the attic and search there. That's the place an amateur would  most likely hide.\"    The man growled some retort and left, closing the door heavily behind  him, while Ronicky Doone breathed freely again for the first time.    \"Now,\" said the man of the sneer, \"tell me the whole of it, Ruth.\"    Ronicky set his teeth. Had the clever devil guessed at the truth so  easily? Had he sent his follower away, merely to avoid having it known  that a man had taken shelter in the room of the girl he loved?    \"Go on,\" the leader was repeating. \"Let me hear the whole truth.\"    \"I--I--\" stammered the girl, and she could say no more.    The man of the sneer laughed unpleasantly. \"Let me help you. It was  somebody you met somewhere--on the train, perhaps, and you couldn't  help smiling at him, eh? You smiled so much, in fact, that he followed  you and found that you had come here. The only way he could get in  was by stealth. Is that right? So he came in exactly that way, like a  robber, but really only to keep a tryst with his lady love? A pretty  story, a true romance! I begin to see why you find me such a dull  fellow, my dear girl.\"    \"John--\" began Ruth Tolliver, her voice shaking.    \"Tush,\" he broke in as smoothly as ever. \"Let me tell the story for  you and spare your blushes. When I sent you for Harry Morgan you found  Lochinvar in the very act of slugging the poor fellow. You helped him  tie Morgan; then you took him here to your room; although you were  glad to see him, you warned him that it was dangerous to play with  fire--fire being me. Do I gather the drift of the story fairly well?  Finally you have him worked up to the right pitch. He is convinced  that a retreat would be advantageous, if possible. You show him that  it is possible. You point out the ledge under your window and the easy  way of working to the ground. Eh?\"    \"Yes,\" said the girl unevenly. \"That is--\"    \"Ah!\" murmured the man of the sneer. \"You seem rather relieved that I  have guessed he left the house. In that case--\"    Ronicky Doone had held the latch of the door turned back for some  time. Now he pushed it open and stepped out. He was only barely in  time, for the man of the sneer was turning quickly in his direction,  since there was only one hiding place in the room.    He was brought up with a shock by the sight of Ronicky's big Colt,  held at the hip and covering him with absolute certainty. Ruth  Tolliver did not cry out, but every muscle in her face and body seemed  to contract, as if she were preparing herself for the explosion.    \"You don't have to put up your hands,\" said Ronicky Doone, wondering  at the familiarity of the face of the man of the sneer. He had brooded  on it so often in the past few days that it was like the face of an  old acquaintance. He knew every line in that sharp profile.    \"Thank you,\" responded the leader, and, turning to the girl, he said  coldly: \"I congratulate you on your good taste. A regular Apollo, my  dear Ruth.\"    He turned back to Ronicky Doone. \"And I suppose you have overhead our  entire conversation?\"    \"The whole lot of it,\" said Ronicky, \"though I wasn't playing my hand  at eavesdropping. I couldn't help hearing you, partner.\"    The man of the sneer looked him over leisurely. \"Western,\" he said at  last, \"decidedly Western.    \"Are you staying long in the East, my friend?\"    \"I dunno,\" said Ronicky Doone, smiling faintly at the coolness of the  other. \"What do you think about it?\"    \"Meaning that I'm liable to put an end to your stay?\"    \"Maybe!\"    \"Tush, tush! I suppose Ruth has filled your head with a lot of rot  about what a terrible fellow I am. But I don't use poison, and I  don't kill with mysterious X-rays. I am, as you see, a very quiet and  ordinary sort.\"    Ronicky Doone smiled again. \"You just oblige me, partner,\" he  replied in his own soft voice. \"Just stay away from the walls of the  room--don't even sit down. Stand right where you are.\"    \"You'd murder me if I took another step?\" asked the man of the sneer,  and a contemptuous and sardonic expression flitted across his face for  the first time.    \"I'd sure blow you full of lead,\" said Ronicky fervently. \"I'd kill  you like a snake, stranger, which I mostly think you are. So step  light, and step quick when I talk.\"    \"Certainly,\" said the other, bowing. \"I am entirely at your service.\"  He turned a little to Ruth. \"I see that you have a most determined  cavalier. I suppose he'll instantly abduct you and sweep you away from  beneath my eyes?\"    She made a vague gesture of denial.    \"Go ahead,\" said the leader. \"By the way, my name is John Mark.\"    \"I'm Doone--some call me Ronicky Doone.\"    \"I'm glad to know you, Ronicky Doone. I imagine that name fits you.  Now tell me the story of why you came to this house; of course it  wasn't to see a girl!\"    \"You're wrong! It was.\"    \"Ah?\" In spite of himself the face of John Mark wrinkled with pain and  suspicious rage.    \"I came to see a girl, and her name, I figure, is Caroline Smith.\"    Relief, wonder, and even a gleam of outright happiness shot into the  eyes of John Mark. \"Caroline? You came for that?\" Suddenly he laughed  heartily, but there was a tremor of emotion in that laughter. The  perfect torture, which had been wringing the soul of the man of the  sneer, projected through the laughter.    \"I ask your pardon, my dear,\" said John Mark to Ruth. \"I should have  guessed. You found him; he confessed why he was here; you took pity on  him--and--\" He brushed a hand across his forehead and was instantly  himself, calm and cool.    \"Very well, then. It seems I've made an ass of myself, but I'll try  to make up for it. Now what about Caroline? There seems to be a whole  host of you Westerners annoying her.\"    \"Only one: I'm acting as his agent.\"    \"And what do you expect?\"    \"I expect that you will send for her and tell her that she is free to  go down with me--leave this house--and take a ride or a walk with me.\"    \"As much as that? If you have to talk to her, why not do the talking  here?\"    \"I dunno,\" replied Ronicky Doone. \"I figure she'd think too much about  you all the time.\"    \"The basilisk, eh?\" asked John Mark. \"Well, you are going to persuade  her to go to Bill Gregg?\"    \"You know the name, eh?\"    \"Yes, I have a curious stock of useless information.\"    \"Well, you're right; I'm going to try to get her back for Bill.\"    \"But you can't expect me to assent to that?\"    \"I sure do.\"    \"And why? This Caroline Smith may be a person of great value to me.\"    \"I have no doubt she is, but I got a good argument.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"The gun, partner.\"    \"And, if you couldn't get the girl--but see how absurd the whole thing  is, Ronicky Doone! I send for the girl; I request her to go down with  you to the street and take a walk, because you wish to talk to her.  Heavens, man, I can't persuade her to go with a stranger at night!  Surely you see that!\"    \"I'll do that persuading,\" said Ronicky Doone calmly.    \"And, when you're on the streets with the girl, do you suppose I'll  rest idle and let you walk away with her?\"    \"Once we're outside of the house, Mark,\" said Ronicky Doone, \"I don't  ask no favors. Let your men come on. All I got to say is that I come  from a county where every man wears a gun and has to learn how to use  it. I ain't terrible backward with the trigger finger, John Mark. Not  that I figure on bragging, but I want you to pick good men for my  trail and tell 'em to step soft. Is that square?\"    \"Aside from certain idiosyncrasies, such as your manner of paying a  call by way of a cellar window, I think you are the soul of honor,  Ronicky Doone. Now may I sit down?\"    \"Suppose we shake hands to bind the bargain,\" said Ronicky. \"You send  for Caroline Smith; I'm to do the persuading to get her out of the  house. We're safe to the doors of the house; the minute we step into  the street, you're free to do anything you want to get either of us.  Will you shake on that?\"    For a moment the leader hesitated, then his fingers closed over the  extended hand of Ronicky Doone and clamped down on them like so many  steel wires contracting. At the same time a flush of excitement and  fierceness passed over the face of John Mark. Ronicky Doone, taken  utterly by surprise, was at a great disadvantage. Then he put the  whole power of his own hand into the grip, and it was like iron  meeting iron. A great rage came in the eyes of John Mark; a great  wonder came in the eyes of the Westerner.
