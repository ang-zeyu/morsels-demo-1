So that there are about a million and a half inverted persons in  Germany.[105] This would be a minimum which can scarcely fail to be below  the actual proportion, as no one can be certain that he is acquainted with  the real proclivities of all the persons comprising a larger group of  acquaintances.[106] It is not found in the estimates which have reached  Hirschfeld that the French groups show a smaller proportion of homosexual  persons than the German groups, and a Japanese group comes out near to  the general average for the whole. Various authorities, especially  Germans, believe that homosexuality is just as common in France as in  Germany.[107] Saint-Paul (\"Dr. Laupts\"), on the other hand, is unable to  accept this view. As an army surgeon who has long served in Africa he can  (as also Rebierre in his _Joyeux et demifous_) bear witness to the  frequency of homosexuality among the African battalions of the French  army, especially in the cavalry, less so in the infantry; in the French  army generally he finds it rare, as also in the general population.[108]  Naecke is also inclined to believe that homosexuality is rarer in Celtic  lands, and in the Latin countries generally, than in Teutonic and Slavonic  lands, and believes that it may be a question of race.[109] The question  is still undecided. It is possible that the undoubted fact that  homosexuality is less conspicuous in France and the other Latin countries  than in Teutonic lands, may be due not to the occurrence of a smaller  proportion of congenital inverts in the former lands, but mainly to  general difference in temperament and in the social reaction.[110] The  French idealize and emphasize the place of women to a much greater degree  than the Germans, while at the same time inverts in France have much less  occasion than in Germany to proclaim their legal grievances. Apart from  such considerations as these it seems very doubtful whether inborn  inversion is in any considerable degree rarer in France than in Germany.    As to the frequency of homosexuality in England[111] and the United  States there is much evidence. In England its manifestations are well  marked for those whose eyes have once been opened. The manifestations are  of the same character as those in Germany, modified by social and national  differences, and especially by the greater reserve, Puritanism, and  prudery of England.[112] In the United States these same influences exert  a still greater effect in restraining the outward manifestations of  homosexuality. Hirschfeld, though so acute and experienced in the  investigation of homosexuality, states that when visiting Philadelphia and  Boston he could scarcely detect any evidence of homosexuality, though he  was afterward assured by those acquainted with local conditions that its  extension in both cities is \"colossal.\" There have been numerous criminal  cases and scandals in the United States in which homosexuality has come to  the surface, and the very frequently occurring cases of transvestism or  cross-dressing in the States seem to be in a large proportion associated  with homosexuality.    In the opinion of some, English homosexuality has become much more  conspicuous during recent years, and this is sometimes attributed to the  Oscar Wilde case. No doubt, the celebrity of Oscar Wilde and the universal  publicity given to the facts of the case by the newspapers may have  brought conviction of their perversion to many inverts who were before  only vaguely conscious of their abnormality, and, paradoxical though it  may seem, have imparted greater courage to others; but it can scarcely  have sufficed to increase the number of inverts. Rather, one may say, the  development of urban life renders easier the exhibition and satisfaction  of this as of all other forms of perversion. Regarding the proportion of  inverts among the general population, it is very difficult to speak  positively. The invert himself is a misleading guide because he has formed  round himself a special coterie of homosexual persons, and, moreover, he  is sometimes apt to overestimate the number of inverts through the  misinterpretation of small indications that are not always conclusive.  The estimate of the ordinary normal person, feeling the ordinary disgust  toward abnormal phenomena, is also misleading, because his homosexual  acquaintances are careful not to inform him concerning their proclivities.  A writer who has studied the phenomena of homosexuality is apt to be  misguided in the same way as the invert himself, and to overestimate the  prevalence of the perversion. Striving to put aside this source of  fallacy, and only considering those individuals with whom I have been  brought in contact by the ordinary circumstances of life, and with whose  modes of feeling I am acquainted, I am still led to the conclusion that  the proportion is considerable. Among the professional and most cultured  element of the middle class in England, there must be a distinct  percentage of inverts which may sometimes be as much as 5 per cent.,  though such estimates must always be hazardous. Among women of the same  class the percentage seems to be at least double, though here the  phenomena are less definite and deep-seated. This seems to be a moderate  estimate for this class, which includes, however, it must be remembered, a  considerable proportion of individuals who are somewhat abnormal in other  respects. As we descend the scale the phenomena are doubtless less common,  though when we reach the working class we come to that comparative  indifference to which allusion has already been made. Taken altogether we  may probably conclude that the proportion of inverts is the same as in  other related and neighboring lands, that is to say, slightly over 2 per  cent. That would give the homosexual population of Great Britain as  somewhere about a million.      FOOTNOTES:    [1] Taking all its forms _en bloc_, as they are known to the police,  homosexuality is seen to possess formidable proportions. Thus in France,  from official papers which passed through M. Carlier's bureau during ten  years (1860-70), he compiled a list of 6342 pederasts who came within the  cognizance of the police; 2049 Parisians, 3709 provincials, and 584  foreigners. Of these, 3432, or more than the half, could not be convicted  of illegal acts.    [2] The chief general collection of data (not here drawn upon) concerning  homosexuality among animals is by the zooelogist Prof. Karsch, \"Paederastie  und Tribadie bei den Tieren,\" _Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen_, vol.  ii.

We may  perhaps connect this with an observation of E. Selous (_Zooelogist_, May  and Sept., 1901) on a bird, the Great Crested Grebe; after pairing, the  male would crouch to the female, who played his part to him; the same  thing is found among pigeons. Selous suggests that this is a relic of  primitive hermaphroditism. But it may be remembered that in the male  generally sexual intercourse tends to be more exhausting than in the  female; this fact would favor a reversion of their respective parts.    [8] E.

Krauss (_Das"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13612"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 3 (#14)"],[1,"from real      life. In the same way, while the sexual pantomime dance of the      Azimba girls of central Africa has a direct and recognized      relationship to the demands of real life, the somewhat allied      _danses du ventre_ of the Hamitic peoples of northern Africa are      merely an amusement, a play more or less based on the sexual      instinct. At the same time it is important to bear in mind that      there is no rigid distinction between dances that are, and those      that are not, primitive. As Haddon truly points out in a book      containing valuable detailed descriptions of dances, even among      savages dances are so developed that it is difficult to trace      their origin, and at Torres Straits, he remarks, \"there are      certainly play or secular dances, dances for pure amusement      without any ulterior design.\" (A.C. Haddon, _Head Hunters_, p.      233.) When we remember that dancing had probably become highly      developed long before man appeared on the earth, this difficulty      in determining the precise origin of human dancing cannot cause      surprise.        Spix and Martius described how the Muras of Brazil by moonlight      would engage all night in a Bacchantic dance in a great circle,      hand in hand, the men on one side, the women on the other,      shouting out all the time, the men \"Who will marry me?\" the      women, \"You are a beautiful devil; all women will marry you,\"      (Spix and Martius, _Reise in Brasilien_, 1831, vol. iii, p.      1117.) They also described in detail the dance of the Brazilian      Puris, performed in a state of complete nakedness, the men in a      row, the women in another row behind them. They danced backward      and forward, stamping and singing, at first in a slow and      melancholy style, but gradually with increasing vigor and      excitement. Then the women began to rotate the pelvis backward      and forward, and the men to thrust their bodies forward, the      dance becoming a pantomimic representation of sexual intercourse      (ibid., vol. i, 1823, pp. 373-5).        Among the Apinages of Brazil, also, the women stand in a row,      almost motionless, while the men dance and leap in front of them,      both men and women at the same time singing. (Buscalioni, \"Reise      zu den Apinages,\" _Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie_, 1899, ht. 6, p.      650.)        Among the Gilas of New Mexico, \"when a young man sees a girl whom      he desires for a wife, he first endeavors to gain the good-will      of the parents; this accomplished, he proceeds to serenade his      lady-love, and will often sit for hours, day after day, near her      home, playing on his flute. Should the girl not appear, it is a      sign she rejects him; but if, on the other hand, she comes out to      meet him, he knows that his suit is accepted, and he takes her to      his home. No marriage ceremony is performed.\"[33] (H.H. Bancroft,      _Native Races of the Pacific_, vol. i, p. 549.)        \"Among the Minnetarees a singular night-dance is, it is said,      sometimes held. During this amusement an opportunity is given to      the squaws to select their favorites. A squaw, as she dances,      will advance to a person with whom she is captivated, either for      his personal attractions or for his renown in arms; she taps him      on the shoulder and immediately runs out of the lodge and betakes      herself to the bushes, followed by the favorite. But if it should      happen that he has a particular preference for another from whom      he expects the same favor, or if he is restrained by a vow, or is      already satiated with indulgence, he politely declines her offer      by placing his hand in her bosom, on which they return to the      assembly and rejoin the dance.\" It is worthy of remark that in      the language of the Omahas the word _watche_ applies equally to      the amusement of dancing and to sexual intercourse. (S.H. Long,      _Expedition to the Rocky Mountains_, 1823, vol. i, p. 337.)        At a Kaffir marriage \"singing and dancing last until midnight.      Each party [the bride's and the bridegroom's] dances in front of      the other, but they do not mingle together. As the evening      advances, the spirits and passions of all become greatly excited;      and the power of song, the display of muscular action, and the      gesticulations of the dancers and leapers are something      extraordinary. The manner in which, at certain times, one man or      woman, more excited than the rest, bounds from the ranks, leaps      into the air, bounces forward, and darts backward beggars all      description. These violent exercises usually close about      midnight, when each party retires; generally, each man selects a      paramour, and, indulging in sexual gratification, spends the      remainder of the night.\" (W.C. Holden, _The Kaffir Race_, 1866,      p. 192.)        At the initiation of Kaffir boys into manhood, as described by      Holden, they were circumcised. \"Cattle are then slaughtered by      the parents, and the boys are plentifully supplied with flesh      meat; a good deal of dancing also ensues at this stage of the      proceedings. The _ukut-shila_ consists in attiring themselves      with the leaves of the wild date in the most fantastic manner;      thus attired they visit each of the kraals to which they belong      in rotation, for the purpose of dancing. These dances are the      most licentious which can be imagined. The women act a prominent      part in them, and endeavor to excite the passions of the novices      by performing all sorts of obscene gesticulations. As soon as the      soreness occasioned by the act of circumcision is healed the boys      are, as it were, let loose upon society, and exempted from nearly      all the restraints of law; so that should they even steal and      slaughter their neighbor's cattle they would not be punished; and      they have the special privilege of seizing by force, if force be      necessary, every unmarried woman they choose, for the purpose of      gratifying their passions.\" Similar festivals take place at the      initiation of girls. (W.C. Holden, _The Kaffir Race_, 1866, p.      185.)        The Rev. J. Macdonald has described the ceremonies and customs      attending and following the initiation-rites of a young girl on      her first menstruation among the Zulus between the Tugela and      Delagoa Bay. At this time the girl is called an _intonjane_. A      beast is killed as a thank-offering to the ancestral spirits,      high revel is held for several days, and dancing and music take      place every night till those engaged in it are all exhausted or      daylight arrives. \"After a few days and when dancing has been      discontinued, young men and girls congregate in the outer      apartment of the hut, and begin singing, clapping their hands,      and making a grunting noise to show their joy. At nightfall most      of the young girls who were the intonjane's attendants, leave for      their own homes for the night, to return the following morning.      Thereafter the young men and girls who gathered into the hut in      the afternoon separate into pairs and sleep together _in puris      naturalibus_, for that is strictly ordained by custom. Sexual      intercourse is not allowed, but what is known as _metsha_ or      _ukumetsha_ is the sole purpose of the novel arrangement.      _Ukumetsha_ may be defined as partial intercourse. Every man who      sleeps thus with a girl has to send to the father of the      intonjane an assegai; should he have formed an attachment for his      partner of the night and wish to pay her his addresses, he sends      two assegais.\" (Rev. J. Macdonald, \"Manners, etc., of South      African Tribes,\" _Journal of the Anthropological Institute_, vol.      xx, November, 1890, p. 117.)        Goncourt reports the account given him by a French officer from      Senegal of the dances of the women, \"a dance which is a gentle      oscillation of the body, with gradually increasing excitement,      from time to time a woman darting forward from the group to stand      in front of her lover, contorting herself as though in a      passionate embrace, and, on passing her hand between her thighs,      showing it covered with the moisture of amorous enjoyment.\"      (_Journal_, vol. ix, p. 79.) The dance here referred to is      probably the Bamboula dance of the Wolofs, a spring festival      which has been described by Pierre Loti in his _Roman d'un      Spahi_, and concerning which various details are furnished by a      French army-surgeon, acquainted with Senegal, in his _Untrodden      Fields of Anthropology_. The dance, as described by the latter,      takes place at night during full moon, the dancers, male and      female, beginning timidly, but, as the beat of the tam-tams and      the encouraging cries of the spectators become louder, the dance      becomes more furious. The native name of the dance is _anamalis      fobil_, \"the dance of the treading drake.\" \"The dancer in his      movements imitates the copulation of the great Indian duck. This      drake has a member of a corkscrew shape, and a peculiar movement      is required to introduce it into the duck. The woman tucks up her      clothes and convulsively agitates the lower part of her body; she      alternately shows her partner her vulva and hides it from him by      a regular movement, backward and forward, of the body.\"      (_Untrodden Fields of Anthropology_, Paris, 1898, vol. ii, p.      112.)        Among the Gurus of the Ivory Coast (Gulf of Guinea), Eysseric      observes, dancing is usually carried on at night and more      especially by the men, and on certain occasions women must not      appear, for if they assisted at fetichistic dances \"they would      die.\" Under other circumstances men and women dance together with      ardor, not forming couples but often"]]]
