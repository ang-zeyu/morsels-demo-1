As it is, I'm a Prince, and as  royal as any man in Jinxland.\"    \"How does that come?\" asked Cap'n Bill.    \"My father used to be the King and Krewl was his Prime Minister. But  one day while out hunting, King Phearse--that was my father's name--had  a quarrel with Krewl and tapped him gently on the nose with the  knuckles of his closed hand. This so provoked the wicked Krewl that he  tripped my father backward, so that he fell into a deep pond. At once  Krewl threw in a mass of heavy stones, which so weighted down my poor  father that his body could not rise again to the surface. It is  impossible to kill anyone in this land, as perhaps you know, but when  my father was pressed down into the mud at the bottom of the deep pool  and the stones held him so he could never escape, he was of no more use  to himself or the world than if he had died. Knowing this, Krewl  proclaimed himself King, taking possession of the royal castle and  driving all my father's people out. I was a small boy, then, but when I  grew up I became a gardener. I have served King Krewl without his  knowing that I am the son of the same King Phearse whom he so cruelly  made away with.\"    \"My, but that's a terr'bly exciting story!\" said Trot, drawing a long  breath. \"But tell us, Pon, who was Gloria's father?\"    \"Oh, he was the King before my father,\" replied Pon. \"Father was Prime  Minister for King Kynd, who was Gloria's father. She was only a baby  when King Kynd fell into the Great Gulf that lies just this side of the  mountains--the same mountains that separate Jinxland from the rest of  the Land of Oz. It is said the Great Gulf has no bottom; but, however  that may be, King Kynd has never been seen again and my father became  King in his place.\"    \"Seems to me,\" said Trot, \"that if Gloria had her rights she would be  Queen of Jinxland.\"    \"Well, her father was a King,\" admitted Pon, \"and so was my father; so  we are of equal rank, although she's a great lady and I'm a humble  gardener's boy. I can't see why we should not marry if we want to  except that King Krewl won't let us.\"    \"It's a sort of mixed-up mess, taken altogether,\" remarked Cap'n Bill.  \"But we are on our way to visit King Krewl, and if we get a chance,  young man, we'll put in a good word for you.\"    \"Do, please!\" begged Pon.    \"Was it the flogging you got that broke your heart?\" inquired  Button-Bright.    \"Why, it helped to break it, of course,\" said Pon.    \"I'd get it fixed up, if I were you,\" advised the boy, tossing a pebble  at a chipmunk in a tree. \"You ought to give Gloria just as good a heart  as she gives you.\"    \"That's common sense,\" agreed Cap'n Bill. So they left the gardener's  boy standing beside the path, and resumed their journey toward the  castle.          Chapter Eleven    The Wicked King and Googly-Goo      When our friends approached the great doorway of the castle they found  it guarded by several soldiers dressed in splendid uniforms. They were  armed with swords and lances. Cap'n Bill walked straight up to them and  asked:    \"Does the King happen to be at home?\"    \"His Magnificent and Glorious Majesty, King Krewl, is at present  inhabiting his Royal Castle,\" was the stiff reply.    \"Then I guess we'll go in an' say how-d'ye-do,\" continued Cap'n Bill,  attempting to enter the doorway. But a soldier barred his way with a  lance.    \"Who are you, what are your names, and where do you come from?\"  demanded the soldier.    \"You wouldn't know if we told you,\" returned the sailor, \"seein' as  we're strangers in a strange land.\"    \"Oh, if you are strangers you will be permitted to enter,\" said the  soldier, lowering his lance. \"His Majesty is very fond of strangers.\"    \"Do many strangers come here?\" asked Trot.    \"You are the first that ever came to our country,\" said the man. \"But  his Majesty has often said that if strangers ever arrived in Jinxland  he would see that they had a very exciting time.\"    Cap'n Bill scratched his chin thoughtfully. He wasn't very favorably  impressed by this last remark. But he decided that as there was no way  of escape from Jinxland it would be wise to confront the King boldly  and try to win his favor. So they entered the castle, escorted by one  of the soldiers.    It was certainly a fine castle, with many large rooms, all beautifully  furnished. The passages were winding and handsomely decorated, and  after following several of these the soldier led them into an open  court that occupied the very center of the huge building. It was  surrounded on every side by high turreted walls, and contained beds of  flowers, fountains and walks of many colored marbles which were matched  together in quaint designs. In an open space near the middle of the  court they saw a group of courtiers and their ladies, who surrounded a  lean man who wore upon his head a jeweled crown. His face was hard and  sullen and through the slits of his half-closed eyelids the eyes glowed  like coals of fire. He was dressed in brilliant satins and velvets and  was seated in a golden throne-chair.    This personage was King Krewl, and as soon as Cap'n Bill saw him the  old sailor knew at once that he was not going to like the King of  Jinxland.    \"Hello! who's here?\" said his Majesty, with a deep scowl.    \"Strangers, Sire,\" answered the soldier, bowing so low that his  forehead touched the marble tiles.    \"Strangers, eh? Well, well; what an unexpected visit! Advance,  strangers, and give an account of yourselves.\"    The King's voice was as harsh as his features. Trot shuddered a little  but Cap'n Bill calmly replied:    \"There ain't much for us to say, 'cept as we've arrived to look over  your country an' see how we like it. Judgin' from the way you speak,  you don't know who we are, or you'd be jumpin' up to shake hands an'  offer us seats. Kings usually treat us pretty well, in the great big  Outside World where we come from, but in this little kingdom--which  don't amount to much, anyhow--folks don't seem to 'a' got much  culchure.\"    The King listened with amazement to this bold speech, first with a  frown and then gazing at the two children and the old sailor with  evident curiosity. The courtiers were dumb with fear, for no one had  ever dared speak in such a manner to their self-willed, cruel King  before. His Majesty, however, was somewhat frightened, for cruel people  are always cowards, and he feared these mysterious strangers might  possess magic powers that would destroy him unless he treated them  well. So he commanded his people to give the new arrivals seats, and  they obeyed with trembling haste.    After being seated, Cap'n Bill lighted his pipe and began puffing smoke  from it, a sight so strange to them that it filled them all with  wonder. Presently the King asked:    \"How did you penetrate to this hidden country? Did you cross the desert  or the mountains?\"    \"Desert,\" answered Cap'n Bill, as if the task were too easy to be worth  talking about.    \"Indeed! No one has ever been able to do that before,\" said the King.    \"Well, it's easy enough, if you know how,\" asserted Cap'n Bill, so  carelessly that it greatly impressed his hearers. The King shifted in  his throne uneasily. He was more afraid of these strangers than before.    \"Do you intend to stay long in Jinxland?\" was his next anxious question.    \"Depends on how we like it,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"Just now I might suggest  to your Majesty to order some rooms got ready for us in your dinky  little castle here. And a royal banquet, with some fried onions an'  pickled tripe, would set easy on our stomicks an' make us a bit happier  than we are now.\"    \"Your wishes shall be attended to,\" said King Krewl, but his eyes  flashed from between their slits in a wicked way that made Trot hope  the food wouldn't be poisoned. At the King's command several of his  attendants hastened away to give the proper orders to the castle  servants and no sooner were they gone than a skinny old man entered the  courtyard and bowed before the King.    This disagreeable person was dressed in rich velvets, with many  furbelows and laces. He was covered with golden chains, finely wrought  rings and jeweled ornaments. He walked with mincing steps and glared at  all the courtiers as if he considered himself far superior to any or  all of them.    \"Well, well, your Majesty; what news--what news?\" he demanded, in a  shrill, cracked voice.    The King gave him a surly look.    \"No news, Lord Googly-Goo, except that strangers have arrived,\" he said.    Googly-Goo cast a contemptuous glance at Cap'n Bill and a disdainful  one at Trot and Button-Bright. Then he said:    \"Strangers do not interest me, your Majesty. But the Princess Gloria is  very interesting--very interesting, indeed!  What does she say, Sire?  Will she marry me?\"    \"Ask her,\" retorted the King.    \"I have, many times; and every time she has refused.\"    \"Well?\" said the King harshly.    \"Well,\" said Googly-Goo in a jaunty tone, \"a bird that can sing, and  won't sing, must be made to sing.\"    \"Huh!\" sneered the King. \"That's easy, with a bird; but a girl is  harder to manage.\"    \"Still,\" persisted Googly-Goo, \"we must overcome difficulties. The  chief trouble is that Gloria fancies she loves that miserable  gardener's boy, Pon. Suppose we throw Pon into the Great Gulf, your  Majesty?\"    \"It would do you no good,\" returned the King. \"She would still love  him.\"    \"Too bad, too bad!\" sighed Googly-Goo. \"I have laid aside more than a  bushel of precious gems--each worth a king's ransom--to present to your  Majesty on the day I wed Gloria.\"    The King's eyes sparkled, for he loved wealth above everything; but the  next moment he frowned deeply again.    \"It won't help us to kill Pon,\" he muttered. \"What we must do is kill  Gloria's love for Pon.\"    \"That is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/959"],[0,"The Lost Princess of Oz (#13)"],[1,"Woozy just now.  She loved to climb the trees  and swing herself by the branches from one tree to another.  Some of  the choicest fruit was gathered by the Patchwork Girl from the very  highest limbs and tossed down to the others.  Suddenly, Trot asked,  \"Where's Button-Bright?\" and when the others looked for him, they found  the boy had disappeared.    \"Dear me!\" cried Dorothy.  \"I guess he's lost again, and that will mean  our waiting here until we can find him.\"    \"It's a good place to wait,\" suggested Betsy, who had found a plum tree  and was eating some of its fruit.    \"How can you wait here and find Button-Bright at one and the same  time?\" inquired the Patchwork Girl, hanging by her toes on a limb just  over the heads of the three mortal girls.    \"Perhaps he'll come back here,\" answered Dorothy.    \"If he tries that, he'll prob'ly lose his way,\" said Trot.  \"I've known  him to do that lots of times.  It's losing his way that gets him lost.\"    \"Very true,\" said the Wizard.  \"So all the rest of you must stay here  while I go look for the boy.\"    \"Won't YOU get lost, too?\" asked Betsy.    \"I hope not, my dear.\"    \"Let ME go,\" said Scraps, dropping lightly to the ground.  \"I can't get  lost, and I'm more likely to find Button-Bright than any of you.\"  Without waiting for permission, she darted away through the trees and  soon disappeared from their view.    \"Dorothy,\" said Toto, squatting beside his little mistress, \"I've lost  my growl.\"    \"How did that happen?\" she asked.    \"I don't know,\" replied Toto.  \"Yesterday morning the Woozy nearly  stepped on me, and I tried to growl at him and found I couldn't growl a  bit.\"    \"Can you bark?\" inquired Dorothy.    \"Oh, yes indeed.\"    \"Then never mind the growl,\" said she.    \"But what will I do when I get home to the Glass Cat and the Pink  Kitten?\" asked the little dog in an anxious tone.    \"They won't mind if you can't growl at them, I'm sure,\" said Dorothy.  \"I'm sorry for you, of course, Toto, for it's just those things we  can't do that we want to do most of all; but before we get back, you  may find your growl again.\"    \"Do you think the person who stole Ozma stole my growl?\"    Dorothy smiled.    \"Perhaps, Toto.\"    \"Then he's a scoundrel!\" cried the little dog.    \"Anyone who would steal Ozma is as bad as bad can be,\" agreed Dorothy,  \"and when we remember that our dear friend, the lovely Ruler of Oz, is  lost, we ought not to worry over just a growl.\"    Toto was not entirely satisfied with this remark, for the more he  thought upon his lost growl, the more important his misfortune became.  When no one was looking, he went away among the trees and tried his  best to growl--even a little bit--but could not manage to do so.  All  he could do was bark, and a bark cannot take the place of a growl, so  he sadly returned to the others.    Now Button-Bright had no idea that he was lost at first.  He had merely  wandered from tree to tree seeking the finest fruit until he discovered  he was alone in the great orchard.  But that didn't worry him just  then, and seeing some apricot trees farther on, he went to them.  Then  he discovered some cherry trees; just beyond these were some  tangerines.  \"We've found 'most ev'ry kind of fruit but peaches,\" he  said to himself, \"so I guess there are peaches here, too, if I can find  the trees.\"    He searched here and there, paying no attention to his way, until he  found that the trees surrounding him bore only nuts.  He put some  walnuts in his pockets and kept on searching, and at last--right among  the nut trees--he came upon one solitary peach tree.  It was a  graceful, beautiful tree, but although it was thickly leaved, it bore  no fruit except one large, splendid peach, rosy-cheeked and fuzzy and  just right to eat.    In his heart he doubted this statement, for this was a solitary peach  tree, while all the other fruits grew upon many trees set close to one  another; but that one luscious bite made him unable to resist eating  the rest of it, and soon the peach was all gone except the pit.  Button-Bright was about to throw this peach pit away when he noticed  that it was of pure gold.  Of course, this surprised him, but so many  things in the Land of Oz were surprising that he did not give much  thought to the golden peach pit.  He put it in his pocket, however, to  show to the girls, and five minutes afterward had forgotten all about  it.    For now he realized that he was far separated from his companions, and  knowing that this would worry them and delay their journey, he began to  shout as loud as he could.  His voice did not penetrate very far among  all those trees, and after shouting a dozen times and getting no  answer, he sat down on the ground and said, \"Well, I'm lost again. It's  too bad, but I don't see how it can be helped.\"    As he leaned his back against a tree, he looked up and saw a Bluefinch  fly down from the sky and alight upon a branch just before him.  The  bird looked and looked at him.  First it looked with one bright eye and  then turned its head and looked at him with the other eye.  Then,  fluttering its wings a little, it said, \"Oho!  So you've eaten the  enchanted peach, have you?\"    \"Was it enchanted?\" asked Button-Bright.    \"Of course,\" replied the Bluefinch. \"Ugu the Shoemaker did that.\"    \"But why?  And how was it enchanted?  And what will happen to one who  eats it?\" questioned the boy.    \"Ask Ugu the Shoemaker.  He knows,\" said the bird, preening its  feathers with its bill.    \"And who is Ugu the Shoemaker?\"    \"The one who enchanted the peach and placed it here--in the exact  center of the Great Orchard--so no one would ever find it.  We birds  didn't dare to eat it; we are too wise for that.  But you are  Button-Bright from the Emerald City, and you, YOU, YOU ate the  enchanted peach!  You must explain to Ugu the Shoemaker why you did  that.\"    And then, before the boy could ask any more questions, the bird flew  away and left him alone.    Button-Bright was not much worried to find that the peach he had eaten  was enchanted.  It certainly had tasted very good, and his stomach  didn't ache a bit.  So again he began to reflect upon the best way to  rejoin his friends.  \"Whichever direction I follow is likely to be the  wrong one,\" he said to himself, \"so I'd better stay just where I am and  let THEM find ME--if they can.\"    A White Rabbit came hopping through the orchard and paused a little way  off to look at him.  \"Don't be afraid,\" said Button-Bright.  \"I won't  hurt you.\"    \"Oh, I'm not afraid for myself,\" returned the White Rabbit.  \"It's you  I'm worried about.\"    \"Yes, I'm lost,\" said the boy.    \"I fear you are, indeed,\" answered the Rabbit.  \"Why on earth did you  eat the enchanted peach?\"    The boy looked at the excited little animal thoughtfully.  \"There were  two reasons,\" he explained.  \"One reason was that I like peaches, and  the other reason was that I didn't know it was enchanted.\"    \"That won't save you from Ugu the Shoemaker,\" declared the White  Rabbit, and it scurried away before the boy could ask any more  questions.    \"Rabbits and birds,\" he thought, \"are timid creatures and seem afraid  of this shoemaker, whoever he may be.  If there was another peach half  as good as that other, I'd eat it in spite of a dozen enchantments or a  hundred shoemakers!\"    Just then, Scraps came dancing along and saw him sitting at the foot of  the tree.  \"Oh, here you are!\" she said.   \"Up to your old tricks, eh?  Don't you know it's impolite to get lost and keep everybody waiting for  you?  Come along, and I'll lead you back to Dorothy and the others.\"    Button-Bright rose slowly to accompany her.    \"That wasn't much of a loss,\" he said cheerfully.  \"I haven't been gone  half a day, so there's no harm done.\"    Dorothy, however, when the boy rejoined the party, gave him a good  scolding.  \"When we're doing such an important thing as searching for  Ozma,\" said she, \"it's naughty for you to wander away and keep us from  getting on.  S'pose she's a pris'ner in a dungeon cell!  Do you want to  keep our dear Ozma there any longer than we can help?\"    \"If she's in a dungeon cell, how are you going to get her out?\"  inquired the boy.    \"Never you mind.  We'll leave that to the Wizard.  He's sure to find a  way.\"    The Wizard said nothing, for he realized that without his magic tools  he could do no more than any other person.  But there was no use  reminding his companions of that fact; it might discourage them.  \"The  important thing just now,\" he remarked, \"is to find Ozma, and as our  party is again happily reunited, I propose we move on.\"    As they came to the edge of the Great Orchard, the sun was setting and  they knew it would soon be dark.  So it was decided to camp under the  trees, as another broad plain was before them.  The Wizard spread the  blankets on a bed of soft leaves, and presently all of them except  Scraps and the Sawhorse were fast asleep.  Toto snuggled close to his  friend the Lion, and the Woozy snored so loudly that the Patchwork Girl  covered his square head with her apron to deaden the sound.          CHAPTER 12    THE CZAROVER OF HERKU      Trot wakened just as the sun rose, and slipping out of the blankets,  went to the edge of the Great Orchard and looked across the plain.  Something glittered in the far distance.  \"That looks like another  city,\" she said half aloud.    \"And another city it is,\" declared Scraps, who had crept to Trot's side  unheard, for her stuffed feet made no sound.  \"The Sawhorse and I made  a journey in the dark while you were all asleep, and we found over  there a bigger city than Thi.  There's a wall around it, too, but it  has gates and plenty of pathways.\"    \"Did you get in?\" asked Trot.    \"No, for the gates were locked and the wall was a real wall.  So we  came back here again.  It isn't far to the city.  We can reach it in  two hours after you've had your breakfasts.\"    Trot went"]]]
