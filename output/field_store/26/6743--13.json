This man continued to live in this decaying place, and to  declaim in the same strain, refusing for many years to buy a house  there, because all was going to destruction; and at last I had the  pleasure of seeing him give five times as much for one as he might have  bought it for when he first began his croaking.    I should have mentioned before, that, in the autumn of the preceding  year, I had form'd most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of  mutual improvement, which we called the JUNTO; we met on Friday  evenings.  The rules that I drew up required that every member, in his  turn, should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals,  Politics, or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss'd by the company; and  once in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing, on  any subject he pleased.  Our debates were to be under the direction of  a president, and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry after  truth, without fondness for dispute, or desire of victory; and, to  prevent warmth, all expressions of positiveness in opinions, or direct  contradiction, were after some time made contraband, and prohibited  under small pecuniary penalties.    The first members were Joseph Breintnal, a copyer of deeds for the  scriveners, a good-natur'd, friendly, middle-ag'd man, a great lover of  poetry, reading all he could meet with, and writing some that was  tolerable; very ingenious in many little Nicknackeries, and of sensible  conversation.    Thomas Godfrey, a self-taught mathematician, great in his way, and  afterward inventor of what is now called Hadley's Quadrant.  But he  knew little out of his way, and was not a pleasing companion; as, like  most great mathematicians I have met with, he expected universal  precision in everything said, or was for ever denying or distinguishing  upon trifles, to the disturbance of all conversation.  He soon left us.    Nicholas Scull, a surveyor, afterwards surveyor-general, who lov'd  books, and sometimes made a few verses.    William Parsons, bred a shoemaker, but loving reading, had acquir'd a  considerable share of mathematics, which he first studied with a view  to astrology, that he afterwards laught at it.  He also became  surveyor-general.    William Maugridge, a joiner, a most exquisite mechanic, and a solid,  sensible man.    Hugh Meredith, Stephen Potts, and George Webb I have characteriz'd  before.    Robert Grace, a young gentleman of some fortune, generous, lively, and  witty; a lover of punning and of his friends.    And William Coleman, then a merchant's clerk, about my age, who had the  coolest, dearest head, the best heart, and the exactest morals of  almost any man I ever met with.  He became afterwards a merchant of  great note, and one of our provincial judges.  Our friendship continued  without interruption to his death, upward of forty years; and the club  continued almost as long, and was the best school of philosophy,  morality, and politics that then existed in the province; for our  queries, which were read the week preceding their discussion, put us  upon reading with attention upon the several subjects, that we might  speak more to the purpose; and here, too, we acquired better habits of  conversation, every thing being studied in our rules which might  prevent our disgusting each other.  From hence the long continuance of  the club, which I shall have frequent occasion to speak further of  hereafter.    But my giving this account of it here is to show something of the  interest I had, every one of these exerting themselves in recommending  business to us.  Breintnal particularly procur'd us from the Quakers  the printing forty sheets of their history, the rest being to be done  by Keimer; and upon this we work'd exceedingly hard, for the price was  low.  It was a folio, pro patria size, in pica, with long primer notes.  I compos'd of it a sheet a day, and Meredith worked it off at press; it  was often eleven at night, and sometimes later, before I had finished  my distribution for the next day's work, for the little jobbs sent in  by our other friends now and then put us back.  But so determin'd I was  to continue doing a sheet a day of the folio, that one night, when,  having impos'd my forms, I thought my day's work over, one of them by  accident was broken, and two pages reduced to pi, I immediately  distributed and compos'd it over again before I went to bed; and this  industry, visible to our neighbors, began to give us character and  credit; particularly, I was told, that mention being made of the new  printing-office at the merchants' Every-night club, the general opinion  was that it must fail, there being already two printers in the place,  Keimer and Bradford; but Dr. Baird (whom you and I saw many years after  at his native place, St. Andrew's in Scotland) gave a contrary opinion:  \"For the industry of that Franklin,\" says he, \"is superior to any thing  I ever saw of the kind; I see him still at work when I go home from  club, and he is at work again before his neighbors are out of bed.\"  This struck the rest, and we soon after had offers from one of them to  supply us with stationery; but as yet we did not chuse to engage in  shop business.    I mention this industry the more particularly and the more freely, tho'  it seems to be talking in my own praise, that those of my posterity,  who shall read it, may know the use of that virtue, when they see its  effects in my favour throughout this relation.    George Webb, who had found a female friend that lent him wherewith to  purchase his time of Keimer, now came to offer himself as a journeyman  to us.  We could not then employ him; but I foolishly let him know as a  secret that I soon intended to begin a newspaper, and might then have  work for him.  My hopes of success, as I told him, were founded on  this, that the then only newspaper, printed by Bradford, was a paltry  thing, wretchedly manag'd, no way entertaining, and yet was profitable  to him; I therefore thought a good paper would scarcely fail of good  encouragement.  I requested Webb not to mention it; but he told it to  Keimer, who immediately, to be beforehand with me, published proposals  for printing one himself, on which Webb was to be employ'd. I resented  this; and, to counteract them, as I could not yet begin our paper, I  wrote several pieces of entertainment for Bradford's paper, under the  title of the BUSY BODY, which Breintnal continu'd some months.  By this  means the attention of the publick was fixed on that paper, and  Keimer's proposals, which we burlesqu'd and ridicul'd, were  disregarded.  He began his paper, however, and, after carrying it on  three quarters of a year, with at most only ninety subscribers, he  offered it to me for a trifle; and I, having been ready some time to go  on with it, took it in hand directly; and it prov'd in a few years  extremely profitable to me.    I perceive that I am apt to speak in the singular number, though our  partnership still continu'd; the reason may be that, in fact, the whole  management of the business lay upon me.  Meredith was no compositor, a  poor pressman, and seldom sober.  My friends lamented my connection  with him, but I was to make the best of it.    Our first papers made a quite different appearance from any before in  the province; a better type, and better printed; but some spirited  remarks of my writing, on the dispute then going on between Governor  Burnet and the Massachusetts Assembly, struck the principal people,  occasioned the paper and the manager of it to be much talk'd of, and in  a few weeks brought them all to be our subscribers.    Their example was follow'd by many, and our number went on growing  continually.  This was one of the first good effects of my having  learnt a little to scribble; another was, that the leading men, seeing  a newspaper now in the hands of one who could also handle a pen,  thought it convenient to oblige and encourage me.  Bradford still  printed the votes, and laws, and other publick business.  He had  printed an address of the House to the governor, in a coarse,  blundering manner, we reprinted it elegantly and correctly, and sent  one to every member.  They were sensible of the difference: it  strengthened the hands of our friends in the House, and they voted us  their printers for the year ensuing.    Among my friends in the House I must not forget Mr. Hamilton, before  mentioned, who was then returned from England, and had a seat in it.  He interested himself for me strongly in that instance, as he did in  many others afterward, continuing his patronage till his death.[6]         [6] I got his son once L500.--[Marg. note.]    Mr. Vernon, about this time, put me in mind of the debt I ow'd him, but  did not press me.  I wrote him an ingenuous letter of acknowledgment,  crav'd his forbearance a little longer, which he allow'd me, and as  soon as I was able, I paid the principal with interest, and many  thanks; so that erratum was in some degree corrected.    But now another difficulty came upon me which I had never the least  reason to expect.  Mr. Meredith's father, who was to have paid for our  printing-house, according to the expectations given me, was able to  advance only one hundred pounds currency, which had been paid; and a  hundred more was due to the merchant, who grew impatient, and su'd us  all.  We gave bail, but saw that, if the money could not be rais'd in  time, the suit must soon come to a judgment and execution, and our  hopeful prospects must, with us, be ruined, as the press and letters  must be sold for payment, perhaps at half price.    In this distress two true friends, whose kindness I have never  forgotten, nor ever shall forget while I can remember any thing, came  to me separately, unknown to each other, and, without any application  from me, offering each of them to advance me all the money"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1480"],[0,"Tom Brown's School Days (#14)"],[1,"to hoora  too, thinking it was a runaway; and first lot on 'em stands grinnin'  and wavin' their old hats as we comes abreast on 'em; and then you'd ha'  laughed to see how took aback and choking savage they looked, when they  gets the peas a-stinging all over 'em. But bless you, the laugh weren't  all of our side, sir, by a long way. We was going so fast, and they was  so took aback, that they didn't take what was up till we was half-way  up the line. Then 'twas, 'Look out all!' surely. They howls all down the  line fit to frighten you; some on 'em runs arter us and tries to clamber  up behind, only we hits 'em over the fingers and pulls their hands off;  one as had had it very sharp act'ly runs right at the leaders, as though  he'd ketch 'em by the heads, only luck'ly for him he misses his tip and  comes over a heap o' stones first. The rest picks up stones, and gives  it us right away till we gets out of shot, the young gents holding out  werry manful with the pea-shooters and such stones as lodged on us, and  a pretty many there was too. Then Bob picks hisself up again, and looks  at young gent on box werry solemn. Bob'd had a rum un in the ribs,  which'd like to ha' knocked him off the box, or made him drop the reins.  Young gent on box picks hisself up, and so does we all, and looks round  to count damage. Box's head cut open and his hat gone; 'nother young  gent's hat gone; mine knocked in at the side, and not one on us as  wasn't black and blue somewheres or another, most on 'em all over. Two  pound ten to pay for damage to paint, which they subscribed for there  and then, and give Bob and me a extra half-sovereign each; but I  wouldn't go down that line again not for twenty half-sovereigns.\" And  the guard shook his head slowly, and got up and blew a clear, brisk  toot-toot.    \"What fun!\" said Tom, who could scarcely contain his pride at this  exploit of his future school-fellows. He longed already for the end of  the half, that he might join them.    \"'Taint such good fun, though, sir, for the folk as meets the coach, nor  for we who has to go back with it next day. Them Irishers last summer  had all got stones ready for us, and was all but letting drive, and we'd  got two reverend gents aboard too. We pulled up at the beginning of  the line, and pacified them, and we're never going to carry no more  pea-shooters, unless they promises not to fire where there's a line of  Irish chaps a-stonebreaking.\" The guard stopped and pulled away at his  cheroot, regarding Tom benignantly the while.    \"Oh, don't stop! Tell us something more about the pea-shooting.\"    \"Well, there'd like to have been a pretty piece of work over it at  Bicester, a while back. We was six mile from the town, when we meets an  old square-headed gray-haired yeoman chap, a-jogging along quite quiet.  He looks up at the coach, and just then a pea hits him on the nose, and  some catches his cob behind and makes him dance up on his hind legs. I  see'd the old boy's face flush and look plaguy awkward, and I thought we  was in for somethin' nasty.    \"He turns his cob's head and rides quietly after us just out of shot.  How that 'ere cob did step! We never shook him off not a dozen yards  in the six miles. At first the young gents was werry lively on him; but  afore we got in, seeing how steady the old chap come on, they was quite  quiet, and laid their heads together what they should do. Some was for  fighting, some for axing his pardon. He rides into the town close after  us, comes up when we stops, and says the two as shot at him must come  before a magistrate; and a great crowd comes round, and we couldn't get  the osses to. But the young uns they all stand by one another, and says  all or none must go, and as how they'd fight it out, and have to be  carried. Just as 'twas gettin' serious, and the old boy and the mob was  going to pull 'em off the coach, one little fellow jumps up and says,  'Here--I'll stay. I'm only going three miles farther. My father's name's  Davis; he's known about here, and I'll go before the magistrate with  this gentleman.' 'What! be thee parson Davis's son?' says the old boy.  'Yes,' says the young un. 'Well, I be mortal sorry to meet thee in such  company; but for thy father's sake and thine (for thee bist a brave  young chap) I'll say no more about it.' Didn't the boys cheer him, and  the mob cheered the young chap; and then one of the biggest gets down,  and begs his pardon werry gentlemanly for all the rest, saying as they  all had been plaguy vexed from the first, but didn't like to ax his  pardon till then, 'cause they felt they hadn't ought to shirk the  consequences of their joke. And then they all got down, and shook hands  with the old boy, and asked him to all parts of the country, to their  homes; and we drives off twenty minutes behind time, with cheering and  hollering as if we was county 'members. But, Lor' bless you, sir,\" says  the guard, smacking his hand down on his knee and looking full into  Tom's face, \"ten minutes arter they was all as bad as ever.\"    Tom showed such undisguised and open-mouthed interest in his narrations  that the old guard rubbed up his memory, and launched out into a graphic  history of all the performances of the boys on the roads for the last  twenty years. Off the road he couldn't go; the exploit must have been  connected with horses or vehicles to hang in the old fellow's head. Tom  tried him off his own ground once or twice, but found he knew nothing  beyond, and so let him have his head, and the rest of the road bowled  easily away; for old Blow-hard (as the boys called him) was a dry old  file, with much kindness and humour, and a capital spinner of a yarn  when he had broken the neck of his day's work, and got plenty of ale  under his belt.    What struck Tom's youthful imagination most was the desperate and  lawless character of most of the stories. Was the guard hoaxing him? He  couldn't help hoping that they were true. It's very odd how almost all  English boys love danger. You can get ten to join a game, or climb a  tree, or swim a stream, when there's a chance of breaking their limbs or  getting drowned, for one who'll stay on level ground, or in his depth,  or play quoits or bowls.    The guard had just finished an account of a desperate fight which had  happened at one of the fairs between the drovers and the farmers with  their whips, and the boys with cricket-bats and wickets, which arose out  of a playful but objectionable practice of the boys going round to the  public-houses and taking the linch-pins out of the wheels of the gigs,  and was moralizing upon the way in which the Doctor, \"a terrible stern  man he'd heard tell,\" had come down upon several of the performers,  \"sending three on 'em off next morning in a po-shay with a parish  constable,\" when they turned a corner and neared the milestone, the  third from Rugby. By the stone two boys stood, their jackets buttoned  tight, waiting for the coach.    \"Look here, sir,\" says the guard, after giving a sharp toot-toot;  \"there's two on 'em; out-and-out runners they be. They comes out about  twice or three times a week, and spirts a mile alongside of us.\"    And as they came up, sure enough, away went two boys along the footpath,  keeping up with the horses--the first a light, clean-made fellow going  on springs; the other stout and round-shouldered, labouring in his pace,  but going as dogged as a bull-terrier.    Old Blow-hard looked on admiringly. \"See how beautiful that there un  holds hisself together, and goes from his hips, sir,\" said he; \"he's a  'mazin' fine runner. Now many coachmen as drives a first-rate team'd  put it on, and try and pass 'em. But Bob, sir, bless you, he's  tender-hearted; he'd sooner pull in a bit if he see'd 'em a-gettin'  beat. I do b'lieve, too, as that there un'd sooner break his heart than  let us go by him afore next milestone.\"    At the second milestone the boys pulled up short, and waved their  hats to the guard, who had his watch out and shouted \"4.56,\" thereby  indicating that the mile had been done in four seconds under the five  minutes. They passed several more parties of boys, all of them objects  of the deepest interest to Tom, and came in sight of the town at ten  minutes before twelve. Tom fetched a long breath, and thought he had  never spent a pleasanter day. Before he went to bed he had quite settled  that it must be the greatest day he should ever spend, and didn't alter  his opinion for many a long year--if he has yet.        CHAPTER V--RUGBY AND FOOTBALL.           \"Foot and eye opposed       In dubious strife.\"--Scott.    \"And so here's Rugby, sir, at last, and you'll be in plenty of time  for dinner at the School-house, as I telled you,\" said the old guard,  pulling his horn out of its case and tootle-tooing away, while the  coachman shook up his horses, and carried them along the side of the  school close, round Dead-man's corner, past the school-gates, and down  the High Street to the Spread Eagle, the wheelers in a spanking trot,  and leaders cantering, in a style which would not have disgraced \"Cherry  Bob,\" \"ramping, stamping, tearing, swearing Billy Harwood,\" or any other  of the old coaching heroes.    Tom's heart beat quick as he passed the great schoolfield or close, with  its noble elms, in which several games at football were going on, and  tried to take in at once the long line of gray buildings, beginning  with the chapel, and ending with the School-house, the residence of the  head-master, where the great flag was lazily waving from the highest  round tower. And he began already to be proud of being a Rugby boy, as  he passed the schoolgates, with the oriel window above, and saw the boys  standing there, looking as if the town belonged to them, and nodding in  a familiar manner to the coachman, as if any one of them would be quite  equal to getting on the box, and working the team down street as well as  he.
