[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1298"],[0,"The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains (#14)"],[1," in these pages, she was in  her twenty-first year; or, to be more precise, she had been twenty some  eight months previous.    Now, it is not usual for young ladies of twenty to contemplate a journey  of nearly two thousand miles to a country where Indians and wild animals  live unchained, unless they are to make such journey in company with a  protector, or are going to a protector's arms at the other end. Nor is  school teaching on Bear Creek a usual ambition for such young ladies.    But Miss Mary Stark Wood was not a usual young lady for two reasons.    First, there was her descent. Had she so wished, she could have belonged  to any number of those patriotic societies of which our American ears  have grown accustomed to hear so much. She could have been enrolled in  the Boston Tea Party, the Ethan Allen Ticonderogas, the Green Mountain  Daughters, the Saratoga Sacred Circle, and the Confederated Colonial  Chatelaines. She traced direct descent from the historic lady whose name  she bore, that Molly Stark who was not a widow after the battle where  her lord, her Captain John, battled so bravely as to send his name  thrilling down through the blood of generations of schoolboys. This  ancestress was her chief claim to be a member of those shining societies  which I have enumerated. But she had been willing to join none of them,  although invitations to do so were by no means lacking. I cannot tell  you her reason. Still, I can tell you this. When these societies were  much spoken of in her presence, her very sprightly countenance became  more sprightly, and she added her words of praise or respect to the  general chorus. But when she received an invitation to join one of  these bodies, her countenance, as she read the missive, would assume an  expression which was known to her friends as \"sticking her nose in the  air.\" I do not think that Molly's reason for refusing to join could have  been a truly good one. I should add that her most precious possession--a  treasure which accompanied her even if she went away for only one  night's absence--was an heirloom, a little miniature portrait of the old  Molly Stark, painted when that far-off dame must have been scarce more  than twenty. And when each summer the young Molly went to Dunbarton, New  Hampshire, to pay her established family visit to the last survivors of  her connection who bore the name of Stark, no word that she heard in the  Dunbarton houses pleased her so much as when a certain great-aunt would  take her by the hand, and, after looking with fond intentness at her,  pronounce: \"My dear, you're getting more like the General's wife every  year you live.\"    \"I suppose you mean my nose,\" Molly would then reply.    \"Nonsense, child. You have the family length of nose, and I've never  heard that it has disgraced us.\"    \"But I don't think I'm tall enough for it.\"    \"There now, run to your room, and dress for tea. The Starks have always  been punctual.\"    And after this annual conversation, Molly would run to her room, and  there in its privacy, even at the risk of falling below the punctuality  of the Starks, she would consult two objects for quite a minute before  she began to dress. These objects, as you have already correctly  guessed, were the miniature of the General's wife and the looking glass.    So much for Miss Molly Stark Wood's descent.    The second reason why she was not a usual girl was her character. This  character was the result of pride and family pluck battling with family  hardship.    Just one year before she was to be presented to the world--not the great  metropolitan world, but a world that would have made her welcome and  done her homage at its little dances and little dinners in Troy and  Rutland and Burlington--fortune had turned her back upon the Woods.  Their possessions had never been great ones; but they had sufficed. From  generation to generation the family had gone to school like gentlefolk,  dressed like gentlefolk, used the speech and ways of gentlefolk, and as  gentlefolk lived and died. And now the mills failed.    Instead of thinking about her first evening dress, Molly found pupils  to whom she could give music lessons. She found handkerchiefs that she  could embroider with initials. And she found fruit that she could  make into preserves. That machine called the typewriter was then in  existence, but the day of women typewriters had as yet scarcely begun  to dawn, else I think Molly would have preferred this occupation to the  handkerchiefs and the preserves.    There were people in Bennington who \"wondered how Miss Wood could go  about from house to house teaching the piano, and she a lady.\" There  always have been such people, I suppose, because the world must always  have a rubbish heap. But we need not dwell upon them further than to  mention one other remark of theirs regarding Molly. They all with one  voice declared that Sam Bannett was good enough for anybody who did  fancy embroidery at five cents a letter.    \"I dare say he had a great-grandmother quite as good as hers,\" remarked  Mrs. Flynt, the wife of the Baptist minister.    \"That's entirely possible,\" returned the Episcopal rector of Hoosic,  \"only we don't happen to know who she was.\" The rector was a friend of  Molly's. After this little observation, Mrs. Flynt said no more, but  continued her purchases in the store where she and the rector had  happened to find themselves together. Later she stated to a friend that  she had always thought the Episcopal Church a snobbish one, and now she  knew it.    So public opinion went on being indignant over Molly's conduct. She  could stoop to work for money, and yet she pretended to hold herself  above the most rising young man in Hoosic Falls, and all just because  there was a difference in their grandmothers!    Was this the reason at the bottom of it? The very bottom? I cannot be  certain, because I have never been a girl myself. Perhaps she thought  that work is not a stooping, and that marriage may be. Perhaps--But all  I really know is that Molly Wood continued cheerfully to embroider  the handkerchiefs, make the preserves, teach the pupils--and firmly to  reject Sam Bannett.    Thus it went on until she was twenty. There certain members of her  family began to tell her how rich Sam was going to be--was, indeed,  already. It was at this time that she wrote Mrs. Balaam her doubts and  her desires as to migrating to Bear Creek. It was at this time also  that her face grew a little paler, and her friends thought that she was  overworked, and Mrs. Flynt feared she was losing her looks. It was at  this time, too, that she grew very intimate with that great-aunt over at  Dunbarton, and from her received much comfort and strengthening.    \"Never!\" said the old lady, \"especially if you can't love him.\"    \"I do like him,\" said Molly; \"and he is very kind.\"    \"Never!\" said the old lady again. \"When I die, you'll have  something--and that will not be long now.\"    Molly flung her arms around her aunt, and stopped her words with a kiss.  And then one winter afternoon, two years later, came the last straw.    The front door of the old house had shut. Out of it had stepped the  persistent suitor. Mrs. Flynt watched him drive away in his smart  sleigh.    \"That girl is a fool!\" she said furiously; and she came away from her  bedroom window where she had posted herself for observation.    Inside the old house a door had also shut. This was the door of Molly's  own room. And there she sat, in floods of tears. For she could not bear  to hurt a man who loved her with all the power of love that was in him.    It was about twilight when her door opened, and an elderly lady came  softly in.    \"My dear,\" she ventured, \"and you were not able--\"    \"Oh, mother!\" cried the girl, \"have you come to say that too?\"    The next day Miss Wood had become very hard. In three weeks she  had accepted the position on Bear Creek. In two months she started,  heart-heavy, but with a spirit craving the unknown.          IX. THE SPINSTER MEETS THE UNKNOWN      On a Monday noon a small company of horsemen strung out along the trail  from Sunk Creek to gather cattle over their allotted sweep of range.  Spring was backward, and they, as they rode galloping and gathering  upon the cold week's work, cursed cheerily and occasionally sang. The  Virginian was grave in bearing and of infrequent speech; but he kept  a song going--a matter of some seventy-nine verses. Seventy-eight were  quite unprintable, and rejoiced his brother cow-punchers monstrously.  They, knowing him to be a singular man, forebore ever to press him, and  awaited his own humor, lest he should weary of the lyric; and when after  a day of silence apparently saturnine, he would lift his gentle voice  and begin:         \"If you go to monkey with my Looloo girl,        I'll tell you what I'll do:        I'll cyarve your heart with my razor, AND        I'll shoot you with my pistol, too--\"    then they would stridently take up each last line, and keep it going  three, four, ten times, and kick holes in the ground to the swing of it.    By the levels of Bear Creek that reach like inlets among the  promontories of the lonely hills, they came upon the schoolhouse, roofed  and ready for the first native Wyoming crop. It symbolized the dawn of a  neighborhood, and it brought a change into the wilderness air. The feel  of it struck cold upon the free spirits of the cow-punchers, and they  told each other that, what with women and children and wire fences, this  country would not long be a country for men. They stopped for a meal at  an old comrade's. They looked over his gate, and there he was pattering  among garden furrows.    \"Pickin' nosegays?\" inquired the Virginian and the old comrade asked  if they could not recognize potatoes except in the dish. But he grinned  sheepishly at them, too, because they knew that he had not always lived  in a garden. Then he took them into his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12982"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science — Volume 1, No. (#14)"],[1,"a little, and went out. In great  trepidation, young West once more grasped the whole of the remaining  matches in his hand and ignited them, but at the same instant the dog  barked. He hears the gate open, a step is close to him, the matches  are extinguished, the lad makes a desperate effort to escape,--but a  strong hand was laid on his shoulder, and a deep calm voice inquired,  \"What can have urged you to such a crime?\" Then calling loudly, the  gentleman, without relinquishing his hold, soon obtained the help of  some farming men, who commenced a search with their lanterns all about  the farm. Of course they found no accomplices, nothing at all but the  handful of half-consumed matches the lad had dropped, and he all that  time stood trembling, and occasionally struggling, beneath the firm,  but not rough grasp of the master who held him.    At last the men were told to return to the house, and thither,  by a different path, was George led till they entered a small,  poorly-furnished room. The walls were covered with books, as the  bright flame of the fire revealed to the anxious gaze of the  little culprit. The clergyman lit a lamp, and surveyed his prisoner  attentively. The lad's eyes were fixed on the ground, whilst Mr.  Leyton's wandered from his pale, pinched features to his scanty,  ragged attire, through the tatters of which he could discern the  thin limbs quivering from cold or fear; and when at last impelled by  curiosity at the long silence, George looked up, there was something  so sadly compassionate in the stranger's gentle look, that the boy  could scarcely believe that he was really the man whose evidence had  mainly contributed to transport his father. At the trial he had been  unable to see his face, and nothing so kind had over gazed upon him.  His proud bad feelings were already melting.    \"You look half-starved,\" said Mr. Leyton, \"draw nearer to the fire,  you can sit down on that stool whilst I question you; and mind you  answer me the truth. I am not a magistrate, but of course can easily  hand you over to justice if you will not allow me to benefit you in my  own way.\"    George still stood twisting his ragged cap in his trembling fingers,  and with so much emotion depicted on his face, that the good clergyman  resumed, in still more soothing accents: \"I have no wish to do you  anything but good, my poor boy; look up at me, and see if you cannot  trust me; you need not be thus frightened. I only desire to hear the  tale of misery your appearance indicates, to relieve it if I can.\"    Here the young culprit's heart smote him. Was this the man whose house  he had tried to burn? On whom he had wished to bring ruin and perhaps  death? Was it a snare spread for him to lead to confession? But when  he looked on that grave compassionate countenance, he felt that it was  _not_.    \"Come, my lad, tell me all.\"    George had for years heard little but oaths, and curses, and ribald  jests, or the thief's jargon of his father's associates, and had been  constantly cuffed and punished; but the better part of his nature was  not extinguished; and at those words from the mouth of his _enemy_,  he dropped on his knees, and clasping his hands, tried to speak: but  could only sob. He had not wept before during that day of anguish; and  now his tears gushed forth so freely, his grief was so passionate as  he half knelt, half rested on the floor, that the good questioner saw  that sorrow must have its course ere calm could be restored.    The young penitent still wept, when a knock was heard at the door,  and a lady entered. It was the clergyman's wife; he kissed her as she  asked how he had succeeded with the wicked man in the jail.    \"He told me,\" replied Mr. Leyton, \"that he had a son whose fate  tormented him more than his punishment. Indeed his mind was so  distracted respecting the youth, that he was scarcely able to  understand my exhortations. He entreated me with agonizing energy to  save his son from such a life as he had led, and gave me the address  of a woman in whose house he lodged. I was, however, unable to find  the boy in spite of many earnest inquiries.\"    \"Did you hear his name?\" asked the wife.    \"George West,\" was the reply.    At the mention of his name, the boy ceased to sob. Breathlessly he  heard the account of his father's last request, of the benevolent  clergyman's wish to fulfill it. He started up, ran toward the door,  and endeavored to open it; Mr. Leyton calmly restrained him. \"You must  not escape,\" he said.    \"I cannot stop here. I cannot bear to look at you. Let me go!\" The lad  said this wildly, and shook himself away.    \"Why, I intend you nothing but kindness.\"    A new flood of tears gushed forth; and George West said between his  sobs,    \"Whilst you were searching for me to help me, I was trying to burn you  in your house. I cannot bear it.\" He sunk on his knees, and covered  his face with both hands.    There was a long silence, for Mr. and Mrs. Leyton were as much moved  as the boy, who was bowed down with shame and penitence, to which  hitherto he had been a stranger.    At last the clergyman asked, \"What could have induced you to commit  such a crime?\"    Rising suddenly in the excitement of remorse, gratitude, and many  feelings new to him, he hesitated for a moment, and then told his  story; he related his trials, his sins, his sorrows, his supposed  wrongs, his burning anger at the terrible fate of his only parent, and  his rage at the exultation of the crowd: his desolation on recovering  from his swoon, his thirst for vengeance, the attempt to satisfy it.  He spoke with untaught, child-like simplicity, without attempting to  suppress the emotions which successively overcame him.    When he ceased, the lady hastened to the crouching boy, and soothed  him with gentle words. The very tones of her voice were new to  him. They pierced his heart more acutely than the fiercest of the  upbraidings and denunciations of his old companions. He looked on  his merciful benefactors with bewildered tenderness. He kissed Mrs.  Leyton's hand then gently laid on his shoulder. He gazed about like  one in a dream who dreaded to wake. He became faint and staggered. He  was laid gently on a sofa, and Mr. and Mrs. Leyton left him.    Food was shortly administered to him, and after a time, when his  senses had become sufficiently collected, Mr. Leyton returned to the  study, and explained holy and beautiful things, which were new to  the neglected boy: of the great yet loving Father; of Him who loved  the poor, forlorn wretch, equally with the richest, and noblest, and  happiest; of the force and efficacy of the sweet beatitude, \"Blessed  are the Merciful, for they shall obtain Mercy.\"    I heard this story from Mr. Leyton, during a visit to him in May.  George West was then head-plowman to a neighboring farmer, one of the  cleanest, best behaved, and moat respected laborers in the parish.           *       *       *       *       *    FROM FRASER'S MAGAZINE.    THE GREAT MARSHAL SUWARROW.    The Russian is eminently fitted for a soldier's life; his education  is almost as martial as if he had been brought up in a camp; for his  relatives and neighbors hold their lands by military tenure, and love  to talk together of the days when they served in the wars. All, from  the highest order to the lowest, look to the fulfillment of their  ancient prophecy, that \"_All the world is to be conquered by the arms  of Russia_.\" Should some man of resplendent genius, like Suwarrow,  chance to command, there is no calculating on the position to which  the Russian army might attain. Suwarrow was not alone fitted to lead  an army, but was exactly the general to form one: his frankness and  generosity, and the manner in which his habits identified him with  his soldiers, endeared him to the army; while his religious feelings  and exercises, and the habit of participating in some of their  superstitions, sanctified him in the eyes of the men, and gave him  unbounded influence. Some of the anecdotes with which we have met  exhibit feelings for which we were but little inclined to give the  devoted warrior credit, for most certainly we should never have sought  in rude camps, and among wild Cossacks, for gentle affections and  tender emotions; and yet even there they may be found; and we see  that he whose whole existence was nearly an uninterrupted series  of military exploits, was by no means devoid of those congenial  sympathies which make up the charm of domestic life.... This is  the more worthy of observation, as he has been regarded by many  as something not far removed from an ogre--an impression which the  barbarous warfare carried on between the Turks and Cossacks, in which  he took such a prominent part, seemed to justify; coupled as it has  been, too, with the story of his having packed up in a sack the heads  of the Janissaries who had fallen by his hand, for the purpose of  laying them at the feet of his general. The spirit of the times,  and of those with whom his lot was cast, must be looked to as some  palliation for the savage conflicts in which he was engaged. That they  had not hardened his heart against all tender emotions is surprising.    Pierre Alexis Wasiltowitch, Count Suwarrow, was born in 1730, in  Moscow, according to his biographer, of a Swedish family. He began his  military career when but twelve years of age, having been placed in  the School of Young Cadets in St. Petersburgh by his father. He was a  mere boy when he entered the Russian service as a private soldier. For  some years he was not advanced beyond the rank of a subaltern. From  the earliest age the decision and originality of his character were  developed, and he was not long in perceiving his own superiority to  those by whom he was commanded. This conviction rendered the control  to which he was forced to submit extremely distasteful, and made him  determine to raise himself from a "]]]
