But the most important assistance the Czechs rendered to the Allies was  their refusal to fight for Austria.    Out of 70,000 prisoners taken by Serbia during the first months of the war,  35,000 were Czechs. Of these, 24,000 perished during the Serbian retreat,  and 8000 died of typhoid fever and cholera at Asinara. The remaining 3000  were transferred to France and voluntarily joined the Czecho-Slovak army.    Over 300,000 Czecho-Slovaks surrendered voluntarily to Russia whom they  regarded as their liberator. Unfortunately the old regime in Russia did not  always show much understanding of their aspirations. They were scattered  over Siberia, cut off from the outer world, and often abandoned to the  ill-treatment of German and Magyar officers. It is estimated that over  thirty thousand of them perished from starvation. It was only after great  efforts, after the Russian Revolution, and especially when Professor  Masaryk himself went to Russia, that the Czecho-Slovak National Council  succeeded in organising a great part of them into an army. Finally, when  Austria desired to strike a death-blow at Italy in 1918, and began again to  employ Slav troops, she failed again, and this failure was once more to a  large extent caused by the disaffection of her Slav troops, as is proved by  the Austrian official statements. Indeed, whenever Austria relied solely on  her own troops she was always beaten, even by the \"contemptible\" Serbians.  The Czechs and other Slavs have greatly contributed to these defeats by  their passive resistance. It was only the intervention of German troops  which saved Austria from an utter collapse in 1915, and which prevented the  Czechs from completing their aim of entirely disorganising the military  power of Austria. Slav regiments have since then been intermixed with  German and Magyar troops. The Slavs receive their ammunition only at the  front, where they are placed in the foremost ranks with Germans or Magyars  behind them, so that they are exposed to a double fire if they attempt to  surrender. Nevertheless, up to 1916 some 350,000 Czechs out of a total of  600,000 in the Austrian army surrendered to the Allies.    4. From the very beginning of the war Czech soldiers showed their real  feelings. They were driven to fight against the Russians and Serbs who were  their brothers by race and their sincere and devoted friends. They were  driven to fight for that hated Austria which had trampled their liberties  underfoot for centuries past, and for a cause which they detested from the  bottom of their hearts. They were driven to fight in the interests of their  German and Magyar enemies against their Slav brothers and friends under  terrible circumstances.    In September, 1914, the 8th Czech Regiment refused to go to the front until  threatened by the German troops. The 11th Czech Regiment of Pisek refused  to march against Serbia and was decimated. The 36th Regiment revolted in  the barracks and was massacred by German troops. The 88th Regiment, which  made an unsuccessful attempt to surrender to Russia, was shot down by the  Magyar Honveds. A similar fate befell the 13th and 72nd Slovak Regiments.    On the other hand, many Czech troops succeeded in surrendering. The 35th  Regiment of Pilsen went over to the Russians in a body half-an-hour after  arriving at the front. Soon after, the 28th Regiment of Prague surrendered  _en masse_, having been \"fetched\" by the Czechs fighting on the Russian  side. Immediately afterwards the Austrian commander-in-chief issued an  order of the day in which he declared.        \"On April 3, 1915, almost the whole of the 28th Regiment surrendered      without fighting to a single enemy battalion.... This disgraceful act      not only destroys the reputation of this regiment, but necessitates its      name being struck off the list of our army corps, until new deeds of      heroism retrieve its character. His Apostolic Majesty has accordingly      ordered the dissolution of this regiment, and the deposition of its      banners in the army museum.\"    And indeed \"new deeds of heroism\" did follow. A fresh battalion was founded  composed of Czech youths who were sent to the Isonzo front and exposed in a  dangerous position to deadly artillery fire. Almost the whole battalion was  thus unscrupulously wiped out. Only eighteen of them survived. This was  followed by a new imperial order saying that the disgrace of the 28th  Regiment was \"atoned for\" by the \"sacrifice\" of this regiment on  the Isonzo.    As regards Italy, over 20,000 Czechs surrendered voluntarily on the Italian  front up to 1917, and 7000 during the last offensive on the Piave in June,  1918. Of recent cases we need mention only the \"treachery of Carzano,\"  where, on September 18, 1917, some Czech officers went over to the  Italians, communicated to them the Austrian plans of campaign and led them  against the Austrians whose front was thus successfully broken through.  This incident was not the only one of its kind. It has been repeated  several times by Czech officers whenever they found an opportunity of going  over to the Italians. During the offensive of June, 1918, the Austrian  press openly attributed the Austrian failure to \"Czech treachery,\"  asserting that the plan of the offensive was communicated to the Italian  headquarters staff by Czecho-Slovak officers. This the Austrian military  authorities themselves admitted later, when they published the following  official statement, which appeared in the German press on July 28:        \"On the morning of June 15, we started a vigorous offensive on the      whole front between the Tyrolese mountains and the Adriatic, with a      power that can be attained only by complete co-operation of all the      units and with an accurate execution and a common and uniform action.      But, just at the beginning of the attack, it became apparent that the      enemy were making a counter-attack according to a well-defined plan, as      in the case of a projected vigorous offensive. It was also found out      that the enemy was perfectly aware of the extent, the day and the hour      of our attack. The intended surprise, so important for the success of      an offensive, has thus failed. In due course Italy also obtained, from      documents which some deserters handed to the Italian high command,      information which gave her a sufficiently precise idea of our      dispositions. English, French and Italian officers and men captured by      us declare unanimously that their regiments were advised on the evening      of June 14 that the Austrian offensive would start at two o'clock on      the following morning.        \"The exact time of the beginning of our offensive must have been      betrayed by _Yugoslav and Czech deserters_. The enemy took steps      against the bombardment by means of gas, which was expected. These      steps later proved insufficient. As an example we may mention only the      following facts: The battalion of bersaglieri received, at 3.20 on June      14, a quantity of ammunition at 72 to 240 cartridges per man. The      Pinerolo Brigade took up fighting position at 2 o'clock at night. An      order, captured late on July 14, said: 'According to reports received,      the enemy will commence early on June 15 their bombardment preparations      for attack. At midnight hot coffee and meat conserves will be      distributed. The troops will remain awake, armed and prepared to use      their gas-masks.'        \"For some time now the Italian command have tried to disorganise our      troops by high treasonable propaganda. In the Italian prisoners-of-war      camps the Slavs are persuaded by promises and corruption to enlist in      the Czecho-Slovak army. This is done in a way prohibited by law. Their      ignorance of the international situation and their lack of news from      home, partly caused by Italian censorship, are exploited by means of      propaganda without scruples. An order of the 5th Italian Army Corps      (1658 Prot. R. J.) of May 14, 1918, refers to active propaganda by      Czecho-Slovak volunteers with the object of disorganising the      Austro-Hungarian army. The Italian military authorities on their part      deceive the Czecho-Slovaks by telling them of the continuous disorders      and insurrections in Bohemia. In the above-mentioned order it is      asserted that in the corps to which it is addressed, as well as in      other corps, some attempts of the Czecho-Slovak elements have been      successful in causing confusion among enemy ranks. _Some of our      Czecho-Slovak soldiers deserted and went over to the Italians_. Others      remained in touch with them and declared themselves ready to stay in      our positions as a source of ferment for future insurrections. Although      the high treason miscarried owing to the heroic resistance which our      troops, without distinction of nationality, offered to the enemy, it is      nevertheless true that some elements succumbed to the treacherous enemy      propaganda.        \"The gunner Rudolf Paprikar, of the machine gun section, according to      reports of the 8th Army Corps jumped off the river bank into the Piave      below Villa Jacur and swam across under danger of being drowned. He      betrayed the position, strength and composition of his sector, and      through observation and spying, he acquired some valuable information      by which our projected attack against Montello was disclosed.

And experience  only teaches us, how one event constantly follows another; without  instructing us in the secret connexion, which binds them together, and  renders them inseparable.    _Thirdly,_ We learn from anatomy, that the immediate object of power in  voluntary motion, is not the member itself which is moved, but certain  muscles, and nerves, and animal spirits, and, perhaps, something still  more minute and more unknown, through which the motion is successively  propagated, ere it reach the member itself whose motion is the immediate  object of volition. Can there be a more certain proof, that the power,  by which this whole operation is performed, so far from being directly  and fully known by an inward sentiment or consciousness, is, to the last  degree mysterious and unintelligible? Here the mind wills a certain  event: Immediately another event, unknown to ourselves, and totally  different from the one intended, is produced: This event produces  another, equally unknown: Till at last, through a long succession, the  desired event is produced. But if the original power were felt, it must  be known: Were it known, its effect also must be known; since all power  is relative to its effect. And _vice versa,_ if the effect be not known,  the power cannot be known nor felt. How indeed can we be conscious of a  power to move our limbs, when we have no such power; but only that to  move certain animal spirits, which, though they produce at last the  motion of our limbs, yet operate in such a manner as is wholly beyond  our comprehension?    We may, therefore, conclude from the whole, I hope, without any  temerity, though with assurance; that our idea of power is not copied  from any sentiment or consciousness of power within ourselves, when we  give rise to animal motion, or apply our limbs to their proper use and  office. That their motion follows the command of the will is a matter of  common experience, like other natural events: But the power or energy by  which this is effected, like that in other natural events, is unknown  and inconceivable.[12]        [12] It may be pretended, that the resistance which we meet      with in bodies, obliging us frequently to exert our force, and      call up all our power, this gives us the idea of force and      power. It is this _nisus_, or strong endeavour, of which we are      conscious, that is the original impression from which this idea      is copied. But, first, we attribute power to a vast number of      objects, where we never can suppose this resistance or exertion      of force to take place; to the Supreme Being, who never meets      with any resistance; to the mind in its command over its ideas      and limbs, in common thinking and motion, where the effect      follows immediately upon the will, without any exertion or      summoning up of force; to inanimate matter, which is not      capable of this sentiment. _Secondly,_ This sentiment of an      endeavour to overcome resistance has no known connexion with      any event: What follows it, we know by experience; but could      not know it _a priori._ It must, however, be confessed, that      the animal _nisus,_ which we experience, though it can afford      no accurate precise idea of power, enters very much into that      vulgar, inaccurate idea, which is formed of it.    53. Shall we then assert, that we are conscious of a power or energy in  our own minds, when, by an act or command of our will, we raise up a new  idea, fix the mind to the contemplation of it, turn it on all sides, and  at last dismiss it for some other idea, when we think that we have  surveyed it with sufficient accuracy? I believe the same arguments will  prove, that even this command of the will gives us no real idea of force  or energy.    _First,_ It must be allowed, that, when we know a power, we know that  very circumstance in the cause, by which it is enabled to produce the  effect: For these are supposed to be synonimous. We must, therefore,  know both the cause and effect, and the relation between them. But do we  pretend to be acquainted with the nature of the human soul and the  nature of an idea, or the aptitude of the one to produce the other? This  is a real creation; a production of something out of nothing: Which  implies a power so great, that it may seem, at first sight, beyond the  reach of any being, less than infinite. At least it must be owned, that  such a power is not felt, nor known, nor even conceivable by the mind.  We only feel the event, namely, the existence of an idea, consequent to  a command of the will: But the manner, in which this operation is  performed, the power by which it is produced, is entirely beyond our  comprehension.    _Secondly_, The command of the mind over itself is limited, as well as  its command over the body; and these limits are not known by reason, or  any acquaintance with the nature of cause and effect, but only by  experience and observation, as in all other natural events and in the  operation of external objects. Our authority over our sentiments and  passions is much weaker than that over our ideas; and even the latter  authority is circumscribed within very narrow boundaries. Will any one  pretend to assign the ultimate reason of these boundaries, or show why  the power is deficient in one case, not in another.    _Thirdly_, This self-command is very different at different times. A man  in health possesses more of it than one languishing with sickness. We  are more master of our thoughts in the morning than in the evening:  Fasting, than after a full meal. Can we give any reason for these  variations, except experience? Where then is the power, of which we  pretend to be conscious? Is there not here, either in a spiritual or  material substance, or both, some secret mechanism or structure of  parts, upon which the effect depends, and which, being entirely unknown  to us, renders the power or energy of the will equally unknown and  incomprehensible?    Volition is surely an act of the mind, with which we are sufficiently  acquainted. Reflect upon it. Consider it on all sides. Do you find  anything in it like this creative power, by which it raises from nothing  a new idea, and with a kind of _Fiat_, imitates the omnipotence of its  Maker, if I may be allowed so to speak, who called forth into existence  all the various scenes of nature? So far from being conscious of this  energy in the will, it requires as certain experience as that of which  we are possessed, to convince us that such extraordinary effects do ever  result from a simple act of volition.    54. The generality of mankind never find any difficulty in accounting  for the more common and familiar operations of nature--such as the  descent of heavy bodies, the growth of plants, the generation of  animals, or the nourishment of bodies by food: But suppose that, in all  these cases, they perceive the very force or energy of the cause, by  which it is connected with its effect, and is for ever infallible in its  operation. They acquire, by long habit, such a turn of mind, that, upon  the appearance of the cause, they immediately expect with assurance its  usual attendant, and hardly conceive it possible that any other event  could result from it. It is only on the discovery of extraordinary  phaenomena, such as earthquakes, pestilence, and prodigies of any kind,  that they find themselves at a loss to assign a proper cause, and to  explain the manner in which the effect is produced by it. It is usual  for men, in such difficulties, to have recourse to some invisible  intelligent principle[13] as the immediate cause of that event which  surprises them, and which, they think, cannot be accounted for from the  common powers of nature. But philosophers, who carry their scrutiny a  little farther, immediately perceive that, even in the most familiar  events, the energy of the cause is as unintelligible as in the most  unusual, and that we only learn by experience the frequent _Conjunction_  of objects, without being ever able to comprehend anything like  _Connexion_ between them.        [13] [Greek: theos apo maechanaes.]    55. Here, then, many philosophers think themselves obliged by reason to  have recourse, on all occasions, to the same principle, which the vulgar  never appeal to but in cases that appear miraculous and supernatural.  They acknowledge mind and intelligence to be, not only the ultimate and  original cause of all things, but the immediate and sole cause of every  event which appears in nature. They pretend that those objects which are  commonly denominated _causes,_ are in reality nothing but _occasions;_  and that the true and direct principle of every effect is not any power  or force in nature, but a volition of the Supreme Being, who wills that  such particular objects should for ever be conjoined with each other.  Instead of saying that one billiard-ball moves another by a force which  it has derived from the author of nature, it is the Deity himself, they  say, who, by a particular volition, moves the second ball, being  determined to this operation by the impulse of the first ball, in  consequence of those general laws which he has laid down to himself in  the government of the universe. But philosophers advancing still in  their inquiries, discover that, as we are totally ignorant of the power  on which depends the mutual operation of bodies, we are no less ignorant  of that power on which depends the operation of mind on body, or of body  on mind; nor are we able, either from our senses or consciousness, to  assign the ultimate principle in one case more than in the other. The  same ignorance, therefore, reduces them to the same conclusion. They  assert that the Deity is the immediate cause of the union between soul  and body; and that they are not the organs of sense, which, being  agitated by external objects, produce sensations in the mind; "]]]
