[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12060"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 04 (#14)"],[1,"  assumed literary name Novalis (1772-1801). Both his father, Baron von  Hardenberg (chief director of the Saxon salt-works), and his mother  belonged to the Moravians, that devoted group of mystical pietists  whose sincere consecration to the things of the spirit has achieved a  deathless place in the annals of the religious history of the  eighteenth century, and, more particularly, determined the beginnings  and the essential character of the world-wide Methodist movement. His  gentle life presents very little of dramatic incident: he was a  reserved, somewhat unsocial boy, greatly devoted to study and to the  reading of poetry. He was given a most thorough education, and, while  completing his university career, became acquainted with Friedrich  Schlegel, and remained his most intimate friend. He also came to know  Fichte, and eagerly absorbed his _Doctrine of Science_. A little later  he came into close relations with Wilhelm Schlegel and Tieck in Jena.  He experienced a seraphic love for a delicate girl of thirteen, whose  passing away at the age of fifteen served to transport the youth's  interests almost exclusively to the invisible world: \"Life is a  sickness of the spirit, a passionate Doing.\" His chief conversation  lay in solitude, in seeking for a mystic inner solution of the secrets  of external nature. He loved to discourse on these unseen realms, and  to create an ideal connection between them all. The testimony of his  friend Tieck, who in company with Friedrich Schlegel edited his works  in a spirit of almost religious piety, runs: \"The common life  environed him like some tale of fiction, and that realm which most men  conceive as something far and incomprehensible was the very Home of  his Soul.\" He was not quite twenty-nine years old at the time of his  peaceful death, which plunged the circle of his Romantic friends into  deepest grief.    The envelope of his spiritual nature was so tenuous that he seemed to  respond to all the subtler influences of the universe; a sensitive  chord attuned to poetic values, he appeared to exercise an almost  mediumistic refraction and revelation of matters which lie only in the  realm of the transcendental--      \"Weaving about the commonplace of things    The golden haze of morning's blushing glow.\"    In reading Novalis, it is hardly possible to discriminate between  discourse and dreaming; his passion was for remote, never-experienced  things--      \"Ah, lonely stands, and merged in woe,    Who loves the past with fervent glow!\"    His homesickness for the invisible world became an almost sensuous  yearning for the joys of death.    In the first volume of the _Athenaeum_ (1798) a place of honor was  given to his group of apothegms, _Pollen_ (rather an unromantic  translation for \"_Bluethenstaub_\"); these were largely supplemented by  materials found after his death, and republished as _Fragments_. In  the last volume of the same journal (1800) appeared his _Hymns to  Night_. Practically all of his other published works are posthumous:  his unfinished novel, _Henry of Ofterdingen_; a set of religious  hymns; the beginnings of a \"physical novel,\" _The Novices at Sais_.    Novalis's aphoristic \"seed-thoughts\" reveal Fichte's transcendental  idealistic philosophy as the fine-spun web of all his observations on  life. The external world is but a shadow; the universe is in us;  there, or nowhere, is infinity, with all its systems, past or future;  the world is but a precipitate of human nature.    _The Novices at Sais_, a mystical contemplation of nature reminding us  of the discourses of Jakob Boehme, has some suggestion of the  symbolistic lore of parts of Goethe's _Wilhelm Meister_, and proves a  most racking riddle to the uninitiated. The penetration into the  meaning of the Veiled Image of Nature is attempted from the point of  view that all is symbolic: only poetic, intuitive souls may enter in;  the merely physical investigator is but searching through a  charnel-house. Nature, the countenance of Divinity, reveals herself to  the childlike spirit; to such she will, at her own good pleasure,  disclose herself spontaneously, though gradually. This seems to be the  inner meaning of the episodic tale, _Hyacinth and Rose-Blossom_. The  rhythmic prose _Hymns to Night_ exhale a delicate melancholy, moving  in a vague haze, and yet breathing a peace which comes from a  knowledge of the deeper meanings of things, divined rather than  experienced. Their stealing melody haunts the soul, however dazed the  mind may be with their vagueness, and their exaltation of death above  life. In his _Spiritual Poems_ we feel a simple, passionate intensity  of adoration, a yearning sympathy for the hopeless and the  heavy-laden; in their ardent assurance of love, peace, and rest, they  are surely to be reckoned among the most intimate documents in the  whole archives of the \"varieties of religious experience.\"    The unfinished novel _Henry of Ofterdingen_ reaches a depth of  obscurity which is saved from absurdity only by the genuinely fervent  glow of a soul on the quest for its mystic ideals: \"The blue flower it  is that I yearn to look upon!\" No farcical romance of the nursery  shows more truly the mingled stuff that dreams are made on, yet the  intimation that the dream is not all a dream, that the spirit of an  older day is symbolically struggling for some expression in words,  gave it in its day a serious importance at which our own age can  merely marvel. It brings no historical conviction; it is altogether  free from such conventional limits as Time and Space. Stripped of its  dreamy diction, there is even a tropical residue of sensuousness, to  which the English language is prone to give a plainer name. It  develops into a fantastic _melange_ which no American mind can  possibly reckon with; what its effect would be upon a person relegated  to reading it in close confinement, it would not be safe to assert,  but it is quite certain that \"this way madness lies.\"    To generalize about the Romantic movement, may seem about as practical  as to attempt to make a trigonometrical survey of the Kingdom of  Dreams. No epoch in all literary history is so hopelessly entangled in  the meshes of subtle philosophical speculation, derived from the most  complex sources. To deal with the facts of classic art, which is  concerned with seeking a clearly-defined perfection, is a simple  matter compared with the unbounded and undefined concepts of a school  which waged war upon \"the deadliness of ascertained facts\" and  immersed itself in vague intimations of glories that were to be. Its  most authorized exponent declared it to be \"the delineation of  sentimental matter in fantastic form.\" A more elaborated authoritative  definition is given in the first volume of the _Athenaeum_:    \"Romantic poetry is a progressive universal-poetry. Its aim is not  merely to reunite all the dispersed classes of poetry, and to place  poetry in touch with philosophy and rhetoric; it aims and ought to aim  to mingle and combine poetry and prose, genius and criticism, artistic  and natural poetry; to make poetry lively and social, to make life and  society poetic; to poetize wit, to saturate all the forms of art with  worthy materials of culture and enliven them by the sallies of humor.  It embraces everything that is poetic, from the greatest and most  inclusive system of art, to the sigh, the kiss, that the poetic child  utters in artless song. Other classes of poetry are complete, and may  now be exhaustively dissected; romantic poetry is still in process of  becoming--in fact this is its chief characteristic, that it forever  can merely become, but never be completed. It can never be exhausted  by any theory, and only an intuitive criticism could dare to attempt  to characterize its ideals. It alone is endless, as it alone is free,  and asserts as its first law that the whim of the poet tolerates no  law above itself. Romantic poetry is the only sort which is more than  a class, and, as it were, the art of poetry itself.\"    We may in part account for Romanticism by recalling that it was the  product of an age which was no longer in sympathy with its own tasks,  an age of political miseries and restrained powers, which turned away  from its own surroundings and sought to be free from all contact with  them, striving to benumb its sensations by an auto-intoxication of  dreams.    Romanticism is built upon the imposing corner-stone of the unique  importance of the Individual: \"To become God, to be man, to develop  one's own being, these are expressions for the same thing.\" As  personality is supreme, it is natural that there should follow a  contempt for the mediocrity of current majorities, standards and  opinions. It abhorred universal abstractions, as opposed to the truth  and meaning of individual phenomena. It stoutly believed in an  inexpugnable right to Illusions, and held clarity and earnestness to  be foes of human happiness. \"The poem gained great applause, because  it had so strange, so well-nigh unintelligible a sound. It was like  music itself, and for that very reason attracted so irresistibly.  Although the hearers were awake, they were entertained _as though in a  dream_.\"    Hence a purely lyric attitude toward life, which was apprehended only  on transcendent, musical valuations. Poetry was to be the heart and  centre of actual living; modern life seemed full of \"prose and  pettiness\" as compared with the Middle Ages; it was the doctrine of  this Mary in the family of Bethany to leave to the Martha of dull  externalists the care of many things, while she \"chose the better  part\" in contemplative lingering at the vision of what was essentially  higher. A palpitant imagination outranks \"cold intelligence;\"  sensation, divorced from all its bearings or functions, is its own  excuse for being.

Since Bull's last words nobody had spoken. They were going to sleep. It  was too late to speak now, Eric thought. The moment passed by for ever;  Eric had listened without objection to foul words, and the irreparable  harm was done.    How easy it would have been to speak! With the temptation, God had  provided also a way to escape. Next time it came, it was far harder to  resist, and it soon became, to men, impossible.    Ah Eric, Eric! how little we know the moments which decide the destinies  of life. We live on as usual. The day is a common day, the hour a common  hour. We never thought twice about the change of intention, which by one  of the accidents--(accidents!)--of life determined for good or for evil,  for happiness or misery, the color of our remaining years. The stroke of  the pen was done in a moment which led unconsciously to our ruin; the  word was uttered quite heedlessly, on which turned for ever the decision  of our weal or woe.    Eric lay silent. The darkness was not broken by the flashing of an  angel's wing, the stillness was not syllabled by the sound of an angel's  voice; but to his dying day Eric never forgot the moments which passed,  until, weary and self-reproachful, he fell asleep.    Next morning he awoke, restless and feverish. He at once remembered what  had passed. Bull's words haunted him; he could not forget them; they  burnt within him like the flame of a moral fever. He was moody and  petulant, and for a time could hardly conceal his aversion to Bull. Ah  Eric! moodiness and petulance cannot save you, but prayerfulness would;  one word, Eric, at the throne of grace--one prayer before you go down  among the boys, that God in his mercy would wash away, in the blood of  his dear Son, your crimson stains, and keep your conscience and  memory clean.    The boy knelt down for a few minutes, and repeated to himself a few  formal words. Had he stayed longer on his knees, he might have given way  to a burst of penitence and supplication--but he heard Bull's footstep,  and getting up, he ran down stairs to breakfast; so Eric did not pray.    Conversations did not generally drop so suddenly in dormitory No. 7. On  the contrary, they generally flashed along in the liveliest way, till  some one said \"Good night;\" and then the boys turned off to sleep. Eric  knew this, and instantly conjectured that it was only a sort of respect  for him, and ignorance of the manner in which he would consider it, that  prevented Duncan and the rest from taking any further notice of Bull's  remark. It was therefore no good disburdening his mind to any of them;  but he determined to speak about the matter to Russell in their  next walk.    They usually walked together on Sunday. Dr. Rowlands had discontinued  the odious and ridiculous custom of the younger boys taking their  exercise under a master's inspection. Boys are not generally fond of  constitutionals, so that on the half-holidays they almost entirely  confined their open-air exercise to the regular games, and many of them  hardly left the play-ground boundaries once a week. But on Sundays they  often went walks, each with his favorite friend or companion. When Eric  first came as a boarder, he invariably went with Russell on Sunday, and  many a pleasant stroll they had taken together, sometimes accompanied by  Duncan, Montagu, or Owen. The latter, however, had dropped even this  intercourse with Eric, who for the last few weeks had more often gone  with his new friend Upton.    \"Come a walk, boy,\" said Upton, as they left the dining-room.    \"O excuse me to-day, Upton,\" said Eric, \"I'm going with your cousin.\"    \"Oh _very_ well,\" said Upton, in high dudgeon, and, hoping to make Eric  jealous, he went a walk with Graham, whom he had \"taken up\" before he  knew Williams.    Russell was rather surprised when Eric came to him and said, \"Come a  stroll to Fort Island, Edwin--will you?\"    \"O yes,\" said Russell cheerfully; \"why, we haven't seen each other for  some time lately! I was beginning to fancy that you meant to drop  me, Eric.\"    He spoke with a smile, and in a rallying tone, but Eric hung his head,  for the charge was true. Proud of his popularity among all the school,  and especially at his friendship with so leading a fellow as Upton, Eric  had _not_ seen much of his friend since their last conversation about  swearing. Indeed, conscious of failure, he felt sometimes uneasy in  Russell's company.    He faltered, and answered humbly, \"I hope you will never drop _me_,  Edwin, however bad I get? But I particularly want to speak to  you to-day.\"    In an instant Russell had twined his arm in Eric's, as they turned  towards Fort Island; and Eric, with an effort, was just going to begin,  when they heard Montagu's voice calling after them--    \"I say, you fellows, where are you off to! may I come with you?\"    \"O yes, Monty, do,\" said Russell, \"It will be quite like old times; now  that my cousin Horace has got hold of Eric, we have to sing 'When shall  we three meet again?'\"    Russell only spoke in fun; but, unintentionally, his words jarred in  Eric's heart. He was silent, and answered in monosyllables, so the walk  was provokingly dull. At last they reached Fort Island, and sat down by  the ruined chapel looking on the sea.    \"Why what's the row with you, old boy,\" said Montagu, playfully shaking  Eric by the shoulder, \"you're as silent as Zimmerman on Solitude, and as  doleful as Harvey on the Tombs. I expect you've been going through a  select course of Blair's Grave, Young's Night Thoughts, and Drelincourt  on Death.\"    To his surprise Eric's head was still bent, and, at last, he heard a  deep suppressed sigh.    \"My dear child, what is the matter with you?\" said Russell,  affectionately taking his hand, \"surely you're not offended at my  nonsense?\"    Eric had not liked to speak while Montagu was by, but now he gulped down  his rising emotion, and briefly told them of Bull's vile words the night  before. They listened in silence.    \"I knew it must come, Eric,\" said Russell at last, \"and I am so sorry  you didn't speak at the time.\"    \"Do the fellows ever talk in that way in either of your dormitories?\"  asked Eric.    \"No,\" said Russell.    \"Very little,\" said Montagu.    A pause followed, during which all three plucked the grass and looked  away.    \"Let me tell you,\" said Russell solemnly; \"my father (he is dead now you  know, Eric), when I was sent to school, warned me of this kind of thing.  I had been brought up in utter ignorance of such coarse knowledge as is  forced upon one here, and with my reminiscences of home, I could not  bear even that much of it which was impossible to avoid. But the very  first time such talk was begun in my dormitory I spoke out. What I said  I don't know, but I felt as if I was trampling on a slimy poisonous  adder, and, at any rate, I showed such pain and distress that the  fellows dropped it at the time. Since then I have absolutely refused to  stay in the room if ever such talk is begun. So it never is now, and I  do think the fellows are very glad of it themselves.\"    \"Well,\" said Montagu, \"I don't profess to look on it from the religious  ground, you know, but I thought it blackguardly, and in bad taste, and  said so. The fellow who began it, threatened to kick me for a conceited  little fool, but he didn't; and they hardly ever venture on that  ground now.\"    \"It is more than blackguardly--it is deadly,\" answered Russell; \"my  father said it was the most fatal curse which could ever become rife in  a public school.\"    \"Why do masters never give us any help or advice on these matters?\"  asked Eric thoughtfully.    \"In sermons they do. Don't you remember Rowlands' sermon not two weeks  ago on Kibroth-Hattaavah? But I for one think them quite right not to  speak to us privately on such subjects, unless we invite confidence.  Besides, they cannot know that any boys talk in this way. After all, it  is only a very few of the worst who ever do.\"    They got up and walked home, but from day to day Eric put off performing  the duty which Russell had advised, viz.--a private request to Bull to  abstain from his offensive communications, and an endeavor to enlist  Duncan into his wishes.    One evening they were telling each other stories in No. 7. Bull's turn  came, and in his story the vile element again appeared. For a while Eric  said nothing, but as the strain grew worse, he made a faint  remonstrance.    \"Shut up there, Williams,\" said Attlay, \"and don't spoil the story.\"    \"Very well. It's your own fault, and I shall shut my ears.\"    He did for a time, but a general laugh awoke him. He pretended to be  asleep, but he listened. Iniquity of this kind was utterly new to him;  his curiosity was awakened; he no longer feigned indifference, and the  poison flowed deep into his veins. Before that evening was over, Eric  Williams was \"a god, knowing good from evil.\"    O young boys, if your eyes ever read these pages, pause and beware. The  knowledge of evil is ruin, and the continuance in it hell. That little  matter--that beginning of evil,--it will be like the snowflake detached  by the breath of air from the mountain-top, which, as it rushes down,  gains size, and strength, and impetus, till it has swollen to the mighty  and irresistible avalanche that overwhelms garden, and field, and  village, in a chaos of undistinguishable death.    Kibroth-Hattaavah! Many and many a young Englishman has perished there!  Many and many a happy English boy, the jewel of his mother's  heart,--brave, and beautiful, and strong,--lies buried there. Very pale  their shadows rise before us--the shadows of our young brothers who have  sinned and suffered. From the sea and the sod, from foreign graves and  English churchyards, they start up and throng around us in the paleness  of their fall.
