In St. Louis, in 1871, this was regarded as quite a large  fortune. It would have been ample to start any young man, with  prudence, regular habits, and a small modicum of business sense, well  along in any profession or occupation he might adopt. But it was and  would have been a bagatelle to Eugene though ten times the amount,  unless surrounded with conditions as impenetrable as chilled steel to a  pewter chisel to resist the seductive ingenuity of his spendthrift  nature.    On first going to St. Louis to live, Eugene Field was peculiarly  fortunate in being taken into the home and enduring friendship of  Melvin L. Gray, the executor of his father's estate, and of Mrs. Gray.  To the memory of the latter, on her death several years since, Eugene  contributed a memorial from which I have already quoted and which in  some respects is the most sincerely beautiful piece of prose he ever  wrote. In that he refers to his first coming to St. Louis in the  following terms:      My acquaintance with Mrs. Gray began in 1871. I was at that time just    coming of age, and there were many reasons why I was attracted to the    home over which this admirable lady presided. In the first-place Mrs.    Gray's household was a counterpart of the households to which my    boyhood life in New England had attracted me. Again both Mr. and Mrs.    Gray were old friends of my parents; and upon Mr. Gray's accepting    the executorship of my father's estate, Mrs. Gray felt, I am pleased    to believe, somewhat more than a friendly interest in the two boys,    who, coming from rural New England life into the great, strange,    fascinating city, stood in need of disinterested friendship and    prudent counsel. I speak for my brother and myself when I say that    for the period of twenty years we found in Mrs. Gray a friend as    indulgent, as forbearing, as sympathetic, as kindly suggestive and as    disinterested as a mother, and in her home a refuge from temptation,    care and vexation.    [Illustration: EARLY PORTRAITS OF EUGENE FIELD.]    In the subscription edition of \"A Little Book of Western Verse,\" of  which I had all the labor and none of the fleeting fame of publisher,  Field dedicated his paraphrase of the Twenty-third Psalm to Mr. Gray,  and it was to this constant friend of his youth and manhood, who still  survives (1901), that Field indited the beautiful dedication of \"The  Sabine Farm\":      _Come dear old friend! and with us twain      To calm Digentian groves repair;    The turtle coos his sweet refrain      And posies are a-blooming there,    And there the romping Sabine girls    With myrtle braid their lustrous curls._    I have followed the original copy Field sent to Mr. Gray, which has  several variations in punctuation from the version as printed in \"The  Sabine Farm,\" where the eighth line reads:      _Bind myrtle in their lustrous curls,_    which the reader can compare with the original as printed above. In  that same dedication Field referred to Mr. Gray as one      _Who lov'st us for our father's sake._    In announcing to Mr. Gray by letter, June 28th, 1891, his intention to  make this dedication, Field wrote:      It will interest, and we [Roswell was a joint contributor to \"The    Sabine Farm\"] are hoping that it will please you to know that we    shall dedicate this volume to you, as a slight, though none the less    sincere, token of our regard and affection to you, as the friend of    our father and as the friend to us. Were our father living, it would    please him, we think, to see his sons collaborating as versifiers of    the pagan lyrist whose songs he admired; it would please him, too,    we are equally certain, to see us dedicating a result of our    enthusiastic toil to so good a man and to so good a friend as you.    These quotations are interesting as indicating the character of the  surroundings of Eugene Field's early life in St. Louis.    It was the hope of their father that one, if not both, of his sons  would adopt the profession of the law, in which he and his brother  Charles and their father before them had attained both distinction and  something more than a competence. But neither Eugene nor his brother  Roswell had the slightest predilection for the law. By nature and by a  certain inconsequence of fancy they were peculiarly unfitted for the  practice of a profession which requires drudgery to attain a mastery  of its subtle requirements and a preternatural gravity in the  application of its stilted jargon to the simplest forms of justice.    The stage, on the other hand, possessed a fascination for Eugene. He  was a mimic by inheritance, a comedian by instinct and unrestrained  habit. Everything appealed to his sense of the queer, the fanciful,  and the utterly ridiculous. He was a student of the whimsicalities of  character and nature, and delighted in their portrayal by voice or  pen. Strange to relate, however, his first thought of adopting the  histrionic profession contemplated tragedy as his forte. He had  inherited a wondrous voice, deep, sweet, and resonant, from his  father, and had a face so plastic that it could be moulded at will to  all the expressions of terror, malignity, and devotion, or anon into  the most grotesque and mirth-provoking lines of comedy. His early love  for reciting passages from \"Spartacus,\" referred to by the Rev. Mr.  Tufts, showed the bent of his mind, and when he became master of his  own affairs he sought out Edwin Forrest and confided to him his  ambition to go on the boards. Would that I could reproduce Field's  version of that interview! He approached the great tragedian with a  sinking heart, for Forrest had a reputation for brusque roughness  never exceeded on or off the stage. But Eugene managed to prefer his  request for advice and an opening in Forrest's company. The  dark-browed Othello looked his visitor over from head to foot, and, in  a voice that rolled through the flies of the stage where this little  scene was enacted, exclaimed:    \"Boy, return to your friends and bid them apprentice you to a  wood-sawyer, rather than waste your life on a precarious profession  whose successes are few and whose rewards are bankruptcy and  ingratitude. Go! study and learn of Coriolanus.\"    This I repeat from memory, preserving the sense and the three words  \"boy,\" \"wood-sawyer,\" and \"Coriolanus,\" which always recurred in  Field's various versions of \"Why I did not go on the stage.\" Eugene  returned to St. Louis and quietly disposed of the costumes he had  prepared for such characters as Hamlet, Lear, and Spartacus.    [Illustration: MELVIN L. GRAY.]    Francis Wilson, in his \"The Eugene Field I Knew,\" preserves the  following story of Eugene's further venture in search of a profession:    He organized a company of his own in conjunction with his friend,  Marvin Eddy, who tells of a comedy Field wrote in which the heroines  were impersonated by Field himself to the heroes of the only other  acting member of the cast--Mr. Eddy. A Madame Saunders was the  orchestra, or rather the pianist, and Monsieur Saunders painted  the posters which announced the coming of the \"great and only\"  entertainment. Rehearsals were held in the hotel dining-rooms. While  a darky carried a placard of announcement, the result of Saunders's  artistic handiwork, the local band, specially engaged, played in  front of the principal places in town. Mr. Eddy recalls that Field  had a sweet bass voice which he used with much effect both in songs  and recitations.    The season, confined to such towns in Missouri as Carrollton, Richmond,  etc., lasted about two weeks and was what the papers would call a  _succes d'estime_.    Which, being interpreted into the vernacular of the author of \"Sharps  and Flats,\" spelled a popular \"frost\" and a financial failure. And  thus Missouri closed the door of comedy against Field, as Forrest had  shut the gates of tragedy in his pale and intellectual face.    There was still one profession open to him in which he had made a few  halting and tentative steps--that of journalism, with its broad  entrance and narrowing perspective into the fair field of letters.  While a sophomore at Knox he had exercised his irrepressible  inclination \"to shoot folly as it flies\" by contributions to the local  paper of Galesburg, which had the piquant flavor of personal comment.  His youthful dash at the door of the stage had brought him into the  comradeship of Stanley Waterloo and several other young journalists in  St. Louis, and he was easily persuaded to try his 'prentice hand as a  reporter, under the tutelage of Stanley Huntley, of the \"Spoopendyke  Papers\" fame.    But Eugene Field was yet without the stern incentive of necessity that  is the seed of journalism. Circumstances, however, were ripening that  would soon leave him no excuse on that score for not buckling down to  \"sawing wood,\" as for twenty-three years he was wont to consider his  daily work. When he reached his majority he was entitled to his share  in the first distribution of his father's estate. Before this could be  made, Mr. Gray had to dispose of a part of the land which he held as  executor of Roswell M. Field. It was accordingly offered for sale at  auction, and enough to realize $20,000 was sold. Under the will,  Eugene's share of this was $8,000, and he immediately placed himself  in the way of investing it where it would be the least incumbrance to  him. While at Columbia he had met Edgar V. Comstock, the brother of  his future wife, through whom it was that he made her acquaintance.  Upon the first touch of the cash payment on his share of the  executor's sale, Eugene at once proposed to young Comstock that they  visit Europe in company, he bearing the expenses of the expedition.  His friend did not need much persuasion to embark on what promised to  be such a lark.

Love to the folks.      Ever yours,      FIELD.    The proposed \"Noctes,\" except the set for Field, never materialized.      XII      CHICAGO, September 28th, 1886.      Dear Nomp:--I am just cunning enough to send this to the care of our    New York office, for I surmise that it will reach there in time to    intercept you. I do not intend that you shall get out of New York    without being reminded of that present you intend bringing me for    being so good as to write to you regularly whilst you were away. I    confidently expect to see you back here next Sunday. On Monday I go    to Indianapolis for two or three days, and I heartily wish you were    going with me to help bear the expense of the trip. In fact, I am so    anxious to have you along that I would cheerfully consent to letting    you pay everything. But at any rate I agree to take supper with you    at Mr. Pullman's godless hotel the night you return. The Dock    invited me out to supper to-night. We went to the Drum. Suspecting    that I was going to exceed his capability of payment, he handed me    over a dollar--all the money he had. I had the check charged to me    and kept the dollar. Whereat the Dock grieves passing sore.      I have begun to surmise that my remarks about Literary Life will    lead to Miss Cleveland's retirement from the editorship of that    delectable mush-bucket. The signs all point that way now. I enclose    you a letter to my friend Mitchell of the Sun. Tell him about the    Goethe poem. I promised to send him a copy of it when Literary Life    printed it. Scrutinize young Kingsbury's daily life carefully.    Heaven forefend all the temptations that compass him in the modern    Babylon. Give my love to Mr. Scribner.      Yours as ever,      FIELD.    Field's satirical comments on Literary Life, a weekly that sought to  make capital by engaging President Cleveland's sister, Miss Rose  Cleveland, as its editor, not only led to her early retirement from an  impossible position, but to the early collapse of the publication  itself. When Miss Cleveland first came to Chicago to assume the duties  of editorship Field welcomed her in verse:      _THE ROSE      Since the days of old Adam the welkin has rung      With the praises of sweet-scented posies,    And poets in rapturous phrases have sung      The paramount beauty of roses.      Wheresoever she 'bides, whether resting in lanes      Or gracing the proud urban bowers,    The red, royal rose her distinction maintains      As the one regnant queen among flowers.      How joyous are we of the West when we find      That Fate, with her gifts ever chary,    Has decreed that the rose who is queen of her kind      Shall bloom on our wild Western prairie.      Let us laugh at the East as an impotent thing      With envy and jealousy crazy,    While grateful Chicago is happy to sing      In praise of the rose, she's a daisy._          CHAPTER V    PUBLICATION OF HIS FIRST BOOKS      Although the bibliomaniac and collector will claim that \"The Tribune  Primer,\" printed in Denver in 1882, was Eugene Field's first book, and  cite the fact that a copy of this rare pamphlet recently sold for $125  as proof that it is still his most valuable contribution to literature,  his first genuine entrance into the world of letters between covers  came with the publication of \"Culture's Garland,\" by Ticknor & Company,  of Boston, in August, 1887. Whatever may be the truth as to the size of  the first edition of the \"Primer,\" so few copies were printed and its  distribution was so limited that it scarcely amounted to a bona-fide  publication. Neither did the form of the \"Primer,\" a little 18mo  pamphlet of forty-eight pages, bound in pink paper covers, nor its  ephemeral newspaper persiflage, rise to the dignity of a book.    \"Culture's Garland,\" on the contrary, marks the first real essay of  Field as a maker of books. Field himself is the authority for the  statement that \"Tom\" Ticknor edited the book. \"I simply sent on a lot  of stuff,\" wrote he, \"and the folks at the other end picked out what  they wanted and ran it as they pleased.\" This is scarcely just to Mr.  Ticknor. Field himself, to my knowledge, selected the matter for  \"Culture's Garland,\" and arranged it in the general form in which it  appeared. He then delegated to Mr. Ticknor authority to reject any and  all paragraphs in which the bite of satire or the broadness of the  humor transgressed too far the bounds of a reasonable discretion. The  true nature of this, to my mind the most entertaining of all Field's  books, is reflected in its title page, frontispiece, emblem,  tail-piece, and the advertisements with which it concludes. The full  title reads:      CULTURE'S GARLAND      Being Memoranada of    The Gradual Rise of Literature, Art, Music,    And Society in Chicago, and Other    Western Ganglia      by    EUGENE FIELD      With an Introduction by Julian Hawthorne.    The frontispiece is a pen-and-ink sketch of \"the Author at the Age of  30 (A.D. 1880),\" such as Field frequently drew of himself; the symbolic  emblem, which takes the place of a dedication, was a string of link  sausages \"in the similitude of a laurel wreath,\" representing \"A  Chicago Literary Circle,\" and the tail-piece was a gallows, to mark  \"The End.\"    Writing to a friend in Boston, in 1893, Field said that he thought \"the  alleged advertisements at the end of the volume are its best feature.\"  These were introduced by a letter from one of Field's favorite  fictitious creations, \"Felix Bosbyshell,\" to Messrs. Ticknor & Co.:    CHICAGO, June 26th, 1887.      Dear Sirs:--I am informed that one of the leading _litterateurs_    of this city is about to produce a book under your auspices.    Representing, as I do, the prominent advertising bureau of the West,    I desire to contribute one page of advertisements to this work, and    I am prepared to pay therefor cash rates. I enclose copy, and would    like to have the advertisements printed on the fly-leaf which will    face the _finis_ of the book in question.      Yours in the cause of literature,      FELIX J. BOSBYSHELL,    For Bosbyshell & Co.    This was accompanied by a Publisher's Note, which Field also supplied:      It is entirely foreign to our custom to accept advertisements for    our books; but we recognize the exceptional nature of the case    and the fine literary character and high tone of the Messrs.    Bosbyshells' offering, and we cheerfully give it place over leaf.    In his discriminating and felicitous introduction to his friend's  book, Julian Hawthorne said: \"The present little volume comprises  mainly a bubbling forth of delightful badinage and mischievous  raillery, directed at some of the foibles and pretensions of his  enterprising fellow-townsmen, who, however, can by no means be allowed  to claim a monopoly of either the pretensions or the foibles herein  exploited. Laugh, but look to yourself: _mutato nomine, de te fabula  narratur_. It is a book which should, and doubtless will, attain a  national popularity; but admirable, and, indeed, irresistible though  it be in its way, it represents a very inconsiderable fraction of the  author's real capacity. We shall hear of Eugene Field in regions of  literature far above the aim and scope of these witty and waggish  sketches. But as the wise orator wins his audience at the outset of  his speech by the human sympathy of a smile, so does our author, in  these smiling pages, establish genial relations with us before  betaking himself to more ambitious flights.\"    [Illustration: PAGE OF ADVERTISEMENTS FROM \"CULTURE'S GARLAND.\"    ---------------------------------------------------------------------              W.H.
