Allah has manifested himself; the size of this  turtle has changed. It will continue to change. Measure it yourself and  you will see.\"    Mr. Feathercock did measure Zobeide, and was forced to admit that she  had indeed grown the breadth of a finger. He became thoughtful.    Thus day by day Zobeide grew in size, in vigor and in appetite. At  first she had only been as big as a saucer, and took each day but a few  ounces of nourishment. Then she reached the size of a dessert plate,  then of a soup plate. With her strong beak she could split the rind of  a melon at a blow; distinctly could be heard the sound of her heavy  jaws as she crunched the sweet pulp of the fruits which she loved, and  which she devoured in great quantities. In one week she had grown so  tremendously that she was as big as a meat platter. The Rev. Mr.  Feathercock no longer dared to go near this monster, from whose eyes  seemed to glisten a look of deviltry. And, always and forever,  apparently devoured by a perpetual hunger, the monster ate.    The members of Mr. Feathercock's flock came to hear that he was keeping  in his house a turtle that had been enchanted in the name of Allah and  not by the power of the Occidental Divinity: this proved to be anything  but helpful to the evangelical labors of the clergyman. But he himself  refused steadily and obstinately to believe in the miracle, although  Mohammed-si-Koualdia had never set foot in the house since the day when  he had invoked the charm. He remained outside the grounds, seated at  the door of a little cafe, plunged in meditation or in dreams, and  consuming hashish in large quantities. At the end of some time Mr.  Feathercock succeeded in persuading himself that what he was witnessing  was nothing more nor less than a perfectly simple and natural  phenomenon, perhaps not well understood hitherto, and due entirely to  the extraordinarily favorable action of melon pulp on the physical  development of turtles. He decided to cut off Zobeide's supply of  melons.    Finally there came a day when Mohammed, drunk with hashish, saw Hakem,  Mr. Feathercock's valet, returning from market with a large bunch of  fresh greens. He rose majestically, though with features distorted by  the drug, and followed the boy with hasty steps.    \"Miserable one!\" cried he to Mr. Feathercock. \"Wretched worm, you have  tried to break the charm! Rejoice then, for you have succeeded and it  is broken. But let despair follow upon the heels of your rapture, for  it is broken in a way that you do not dream. Henceforth your turtle  shall _dwindle away_ day by day!\"    The Rev. Mr. Feathercock tried to laugh, but he did not feel entirely  happy. On Sundays, at the services, the few faithful souls who remained  in his flock looked upon him with suspicion. At the English consulate  they spoke very plainly, telling him unsympathetically that anyone who  would make a friend of such a man as Mohammed-si-Koualdia and who would  mingle \"promiscuously\" with such rabble, need look for nothing but harm  from it.    Zobeide, when she was first confronted with the fresh, damp greens,  showed the most profound contempt for them. Unquestionably she  preferred melons. Mr. Feathercock applauded his own acumen. \"She was  eating too much; that was the whole trouble,\" he said to himself. \"And  that was what made her grow so remarkably. If she eats less she will  probably not grow so much. And if she should happen to die, I shall be  rid of her. Whatever comes, it will be for the best.\"    But the next day Zobeide gave up pouting and began very docilely to eat  the greens, and when the boy Hakem carried her next bunch to her he  said slyly:    \"Effendi, she is growing smaller!\"    The clergyman attempted to shrug his shoulders, but it was impossible  to disguise the fact from himself--Zobeide had certainly shrunk! And  within an hour all Damascus knew that Zobeide had shrunk. When Mr.  Feathercock went to the barber shop the Greek barber said to him, \"Sir,  your turtle is no ordinary turtle!\" When he went to call on Mrs.  Hollingshead, a lady who was always intensely interested in all  subjects that she failed to understand and who discussed them with a  beautiful freedom, she said to him: \"Dear sir, your turtle. How  exciting it must be to watch it shrink! I am certainly coming to see it  myself.\" When he went to the Anglican Orphanage, all the little  Syrians, all the little Arabs, all the little Armenians, all the little  Jews, drew turtles in their copy-books, turtles of every size and every  description, the big ones walking behind the little ones, the tail of  each in the mouth of another, making an interminable line. And in the  street the donkey drivers, the water-carriers, the fishmongers, the  venders of broiled meats, of baked breads, of beans, of cream, all  cried: \"Mister Turtle, Mister Turtle! Try our wares. Buy something for  your poor stubborn beast that is pining away!\"    And, in truth, the turtle continued to shrink. She became again the  size of a soup plate, then of a dessert plate, then of a saucer, till  finally one morning there was nothing there but a little round thing,  tiny, frail, translucent, a spot about as big as a lady's watch, almost  invisible at the base of the fountain. And the next day--ah! the next  day there was nothing there, nothing whatever, neither turtle nor the  shadow of turtle, or more trace of a turtle than of an elephant in all  the grounds!    Mohammed-si-Koualdia had stopped taking hashish, because he was  saturated with it. But he remained all day long, huddled in a heap at  the door of the little cafe immediately opposite the clergyman's house,  his eyes enlarged out of all proportion, set in a face the color of  death, gave him the look of a veritable sorcerer. At this moment the  Rev. Mr. Feathercock was returning from a visit to the English consul  who had said to him coldly:    \"All that I can tell you is that you have made an ass of yourself or,  as a Frenchman would say, played the donkey to hear yourself bray. The  best thing you can do is to go and hunt up a congregation somewhere  else.\"    The Rev. John Feathercock accepted the advice with deference, and took  the train for Bayreuth. That same evening Mohammed-si-Koualdia betook  himself to the house of one Antonio, interpreter and public scribe, and  ordered him to translate into French the following letter, which he  dictated in Arabic. Afterwards he carried this letter to Father  Stephen, prior to the monastery of the Greek Hicrosolymites:    \"May heaven paint your cheeks with the colors of health, most venerable  father, and may happiness reign in your heart! I have the honor to  inform you that the Rev. John Feathercock has just left for Bayreuth,  but that he has had put upon his trunks the address of a city called  Liverpool, which, I am informed, is in the kingdom of England; and  also, everything points to the belief that he will never return.  Therefore, I dare to hope that you will send me the second part of the  reward you agreed upon as well as a generous present for Hakem, Mr.  Feathercock's valet, who carried every day a new turtle to the house of  the clergyman, and carried away the old one under his cloak.    \"I also pray you to tell your friends that I have for sale, at prices  exceptionally low, fifty-five turtles, all of different sizes, the last  and smallest of which is no larger than the watch of a European  _houri_. I have been at infinite pains to find them, and they have  served to prove to me with what exquisite care Allah fashions the  members of the least of His creatures and ornaments their bodies with  the most delicate designs.\"          VILLIERS DE L'ISLE ADAM    _The Torture by Hope_      Many years ago, as evening was closing in, the venerable Pedro Arbuez  d'Espila, sixth prior of the Dominicans of Segovia, and third Grand  Inquisitor of Spain, followed by a _fra redemptor_, and preceded by two  familiars of the Holy Office, the latter carrying lanterns, made their  way to a subterranean dungeon. The bolt of a massive door creaked, and  they entered a mephitic _in-pace_, where the dim light revealed between  rings fastened to the wall a bloodstained rack, a brazier, and a jug.  On a pile of straw, loaded with fetters and his neck encircled by an  iron carcan, sat a haggard man, of uncertain age, clothed in rags.    This prisoner was no other than Rabbi Aser Abarbanel, a Jew of Arragon,  who--accused of usury and pitiless scorn for the poor--had been daily  subjected to torture for more than a year. Yet \"his blindness was as  dense as his hide,\" and he had refused to abjure his faith.    Proud of a filiation dating back thousands of years, proud of his  ancestors--for all Jews worthy of the name are vain of their blood--he  descended Talmudically from Othoniel and consequently from Ipsiboa, the  wife of the last judge of Israel, a circumstance which had sustained  his courage amid incessant torture. With tears in his eyes at the  thought of this resolute soul rejecting salvation, the venerable Pedro  Arbuez d'Espila, approaching the shuddering rabbi, addressed him as  follows:    \"My son, rejoice: your trials here below are about to end. If in the  presence of such obstinacy I was forced to permit, with deep regret,  the use of great severity, my task of fraternal correction has its  limits.

Why  are you trying to make me mad by such frequent references to the  fact that Darrin won his fight with me?\"    \"I'm sounding you fellows,\" admitted Henkel.    \"That's just what it rings like,\" affirmed Midshipman Page, nodding  his head.  \"Well, out with it!  What's your real proposition?\"    \"Are you with me?\" asked Midshipman Henkel warily.    \"How can we tell,\" demanded Farley impatiently, \"until you come  down out of the thunder clouds, and tell us just what you mean?\"    \"Pshaw, fellows,\" remarked Mr. Henkel, in exasperation, \"I hate  to think it, but I am beginning to wonder if you two have the  amount of spirit with which I had always credited you.\"    \"Cut out the part about the doubts,\" urged Farley, \"and tell us,  in plain English, just what you are driving at.\"    \"Fellows, I believe, then,\" explained Midshipman Henkel, \"that  we owe it to ourselves, to the Naval Academy and to the Navy,  to work Dave Darrin out of here as soon as we can.\"    \"How?\" challenged Farley flatly.    \"Why, can't we put up some scheme that will pile up the 'dems.'  against that industrious greaser?  Can't we spring a game that  will wipe all his grease-marks off the efficiency slate?\" asked  Midshipman Henkel mysteriously.    \"Do you mean by putting up a job on Darrin?\" inquired Page.    \"That's just it!\" nodded Henkel, with emphasis.    \"Putting up a job on a man usually calls for trickery, doesn't it?\"  questioned Farley.    \"Why, yes--that is--er--ingenuity,\" admitted Henkel.    \"Trickery isn't the practice of a gentleman, is it?\" insisted  Farley.    \"It has to be, sometimes, when we are fighting a rascal,\" retorted  Midshipman Henkel.    \"I'm afraid I don't see that,\" rejoined Page, shaking his head.  \"Dirty work is never excusable.  I'd sooner let a fellow seem to win  over me, for the time being, than to resort to trickery or anything  like underhanded methods for getting even with him.\"    \"Good for you, Page!\" nodded Farley \"That's the whole game for  a gentleman--and that's what either a midshipman or a Naval officer  is required to be.  Henkel, old fellow, you are a little too hot  under your blouse collar tonight.  Wait until you've cooled off,  and you'll sign in with us on our position.\"    \"Then you fellows are going to play the meek waiting game with  Darrin, are you?\" sneered Henkel.    \"We're going to play the only kind of game that a gentleman may  play,\" put in Page incisively, \"and we are not going to dally with  any game about which a gentleman need feel the least doubt.\"    \"You've spoken for me, Page, old chap,\" added Farley.    Midshipman Henkel took his leg off the desk, stood there for a  moment, eyeing his two comrades half sneeringly, then turned on  his heel and left the room.  Just before he closed the door after  him Henkel called back:    \"Good night, fellows.\"    \"Well, what do you think of that?\" demanded Farley, a moment later.    \"I think,\" replied Midshipman Page, \"just as you do, that Darrin,  in his desire to bone grease somewhere, played a dirty trick on  us.  I consider Darrin to be no better than a dog, and I apologize  to the dog.  But we're not going to make dogs of ourselves in order  to even up matters.\"    \"We're certainly not,\" replied Farley, with a nod.  \"Oh, well,  Henkel is a mighty good fellow, at heart.  He'll cool down and  come around all right.\"    At that instant, however, Midshipman Henkel, with a deep scowl  on his face, was whispering mysteriously with his roommate Brimmer.          CHAPTER XII    A CHRONIC PAP FRAPPER      Another week had passed.    By this time all of the new midshipmen had had a very strong taste  of what the \"grind\" is like at the U.S. Naval Academy.    If the lessons had seemed hard at the outset, the young men now  regarded the tax demanded on their brains as little short of inhuman.    The lessons were long and hard.  No excuse of \"unprepared\" or  otherwise was ever accepted in a section room.    The midshipman who had to admit himself \"unprepared\" immediately  struck \"zip,\" or absolute zero as a marking for the day.  Many such  marks would swiftly result in dragging even a bright man's average  down to a point where he would fall below two-five and be \"unsat.\"    \"I thought we plugged along pretty steadily when we were in the  High School,\" sighed Dave Darrin, looking up from a book.  \"Danny  boy, a day's work here is fully three times as hard as the severest  day back at the High School.    \"David, little giant,\" retorted Dalzell, \"your weak spot is arithmetic.  It's just seven times as hard here as the worst deal that we ever got  in the High School.\"    \"Oh, well,\" retorted Darrin doggedly, \"other men have stood this  racket before us, and have graduated into the Navy.  If they did  it, we can do it, too.  Mr. Trotter was telling me, yesterday,  that the plebe year is the hardest year of all here.\"    \"Mr. Trotter is a highly intelligent individual, then,\" murmured  Dan Dalzell.    \"He explained that the first year is the hardest just because the  new man has never before learned how to study.  After our first  year here, he says, we'll have the gait so that we can go easily  at the work given us.\"    \"If we ever live through the first year,\" murmured Dan disconsolately.  \"As for me, I'm hovering at the 'unsat.' line all the time, and  constantly fearing that I'm going to be unseated.  If I could  see myself actually getting through the first year here, with  just enough of an average to save me, I'd be just as happy as  ever a fourth class man can hope to be here.\"    \"Remember the old Gridley spirit, Danny boy,\" coaxed Dave.  \"We  can't be licked--just because we don't know how to take a licking.  We're going to get through here, Danny, and we're going to become  officers in the Navy.  It's tough on the way--that's all.\"    \"And we green young idiots,\" sighed Dalzell, \"thought the life  here was just a life of parading, with yachting thrown in on the  side.  We were going to feel swell in our gold lace, and puff  out our chests under the approving smiles of the girls.  We were  going to lead the german--and, say, Dave, what were some of the  other fool things we expected to find happiness in doing at Annapolis?    \"It served us right,\" grunted Darrin, \"if we imagined that we  were going to get through without real work.  Danny boy, I don't  believe there's a single thing in life--worth having--a fellow  can get without working hard for it!\"    \"There goes the call for mathematics, Dave.  We'll tumble out and  see whether we can get a two-six today.    \"Or a two-seven,\" suggested Darrin hopefully.  \"My, but how far  away a full four seems!    \"Did anyone ever get a full four?\" asked Dan, opening his eyes  very wide.    As each, with his uniform cap set squarely on, and his book and  papers carried in left hand, turned out, he found the corridor  to be swarming with midshipmen fully as anxious as were this pair.    A minute later hundreds of midshipmen were forming by classes.  Then the classes parted into sections and the little groups marched  away in many directions, all going at brisk military gait.  Dave got through better, that forenoon, than usual.  He made  a three-one, while Dalzell scored a two-eight.    Then this section, one of many, marched back.    As Dave and Dan swung down the corridor, and into their own room,  they halted, just inside the door, and came quickly to attention.  Lieutenant Hall, the officer in charge for the day, stood there,  and with him the midshipman who served as assistant cadet officer  of the day.    \"Mr. Darrin,\" spoke Lieutenant Hall severely, \"here is your dress  jacket on the floor, and with dust ground into it.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" replied Dave, saluting.  \"But I left it on its proper  hook--I am sure of that.\"    Up came Dan's hand in quick salute.    \"May I speak, sir?\"    \"Yes, Mr. Dalzell,\" replied the officer in charge.    \"I remember seeing Mr. Darrin's coat hanging properly on its hook,  sir, just before we marched off to math. recitation.\"    \"Did you leave the room, Mr. Dalzell, after Mr. Darrin, or even  with him?\" questioned Lieutenant Hall.    \"No-o, sir.  I stepped out just ahead of Mr. Darrin.\"    \"That is all, then, Mr. Dalzell.  Mr. Darrin, there is a pair  of your shoes.  They are in place, but one of them is muddy.\"    Dave glanced at the shoes uneasily, a flush coming to his face.    \"I am certain, sir, that both shoes were in proper condition when  I left to go to the last recitation.\"    \"Then how do you account for the dust-marked dress jacket on the  floor, and the muddy shoe, Mr. Darrin?\"    \"I can think of no explanation to offer, sir.\"    \"Nor can I imagine any excuse,\" replied Lieutenant Hall courteously,  yet skeptically.    Lieutenant Hall made a further inspection of the room, then turned  to Dave.    \"Mr. Darrin, you will put yourself on the report for these two  examples of carelessness of your uniform equipment.\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    Saluting, Dave crossed to the study table, laying his book and  papers there.  Then, once more saluting, he passed Lieutenant  Hall and made his way to the office of the officer in charge.    Taking one of the blanks, and a pen, Dave Darrin filled out the  complaint against himself, and turned it over.    \"Dave, you didn't leave your things in any such shape as that?\"  burst from Dan as soon as Dave had returned to his room.    \"I didn't do it--of course I didn't,\" came impatiently from Darrin.    \"Then who did?\"    \"Some fellow may have done it for a prank.\"    Dan shook his head, replying, stubbornly:    \"I don't believe that any fellow in the Naval Academy has a sense  of humor that would lead him to do a thing like that, just as  a piece of what he would consider good-natured mischief.  Dave,  this "]]]
