The sum of life experiences consists solely in the  adjustments required to enable the sentient organism--man or beast--to  live.    How readily a \"throw-back\" to earlier and cruder life may be brought  about under favorable conditions, is shown by the methods and virulence  of combat during the vicious massacre in the war just ended. Can the  conclusion be evaded that individually and collectively we constantly  teeter on the brink of a precipice? If we fall it spells crime or  misfortune, or both.    Wherever civilization exists on the private property basis as its main  bulwark, we find crime as an inseparable result. Man, by virtue of his  organic nature, is a predatory animal. This does not mean that he is a  vicious animal. It simply means that man, in common with the eagle and  the wolf, acts in accordance with the all-impelling urge and fundamental  instincts of his organic structure. In any conflict between newer and  nobler sentiments and the emotions which function through the primeval  instincts, he is shackled to the bed-rock master instincts in such  manner that they usually win. This is conclusively shown by the history  of the race.    If this is true, we should expect to find the master hunger specially  active through the many chances presented for exploitation after the  fall of feudalism--beginning, let us assume, with the invention of power  machinery--the \"Age of Steam\". It is apparent that from that time to our  own day, man's acquisitive tendency has so expanded, that if we were  capable of an unbiased opinion it might be said to be a form of  megalomania gripping the entire white race, where highly-developed  commerce and industry are found in their most vigorous forms.    If our theory is correct, we should expect to find the most energetic  and enterprising nations showing a greater ratio of property crimes than  the invalid and feeble nations. This would more certainly be true where  political constitutions by letter and spirit encourage and promote  individual development, mental and industrial. When this condition  exists with abundant natural resources, such as often may be found in  what we term a new country, it furnishes the chance for the most  vigorous functioning of whatsoever may be the dominant qualities  inherent in the tendencies and aspirations of a people. The United  States of America, among the nations, meets these conditions, and we  find here the highest ratio of property crimes per capita. This holds as  to all such crimes, both minor and major, which are far in excess of  those of any other nation, as shown by statistics.    It seems clear that this explanation shows the main reason for the  seemingly abnormal number of property crimes in the United States.    Man's infinitely long past developed the hunger instinct, which made him  take directly and simply where he could and as he could. This is always  urging him to supply his wants in the simplest way, regardless of the  later restrictions that modern civilization has placed around the  getting of property. With the weaker intellectually and physically,  these instincts are all-controlling. The superficial and absurd theories  that his excesses are due to the lack of the certainty of punishment  take no account of the life experience, and the inherent structure of  man.    Especially in our large cities with their great opportunities for the  creation and accumulation of wealth, the \"lust of power\" is shown by the  nerve-racking efforts to obtain wealth by the most reckless methods. The  emotion drives us to spend extravagantly and conspicuously, that we may  inspire the envy of our neighbors by our money and power.    This is an old emotion securing a new outlet, and tenfold magnified in  force, through modern conditions in commercial and industrial life. Is  it not plain that in America it has assumed the form of an obsession,  biting us high and low, until we reek of it? It is likewise clear that  it is a menace to any abiding peace and welfare; that it is still  growing and leaving a bitter harvest of neurasthenics in its wake.    The criminologist must face the fact that, in spite of contrary  pretenses by most of our social doctors, we are still in our work-a-day  life guided almost exclusively by the mores--the folk-ways of  old--founded on expediency as revealed by experiences, and acquired by  the only known process, that of trial and error. If this be true, it  clearly follows that in order to conserve any vestige of a civilization,  we must realize the fact that property crimes are the normal results of  the complex activities making up the treadmill called civilization. We  must likewise realize that to modify these crimes we must modify the  trend of the race.    When the seamy side of man's behavior is scrutinized by science, it  cannot be other than grim and distressing to the reader. It is this to  the writer. But all the really significant facts of life are grim and  often repulsive in the material presented. To the \"irony of facts\" must  be ascribed the shadows as well as the high lights. No distortions or  speculations can influence the findings of science. They are accessible  and can be checked up by any one sufficiently interested. The student  knows that man is what he is, because of his origin and long and painful  past.          XIV    CRIMES AGAINST PROPERTY      By far the largest class of crimes may be called crimes against  property. Strictly speaking, these are crimes in relation to the  ownership of property; criminal ways of depriving the lawful owner of  its possession.    Many writers claim that nearly all crime is caused by economic  conditions, or in other words that poverty is practically the whole  cause of crime. Endless statistics have been gathered on this subject  which seem to show conclusively that property crimes are largely the  result of the unequal distribution of wealth. But crime of any class  cannot safely be ascribed to a single cause. Life is too complex,  heredity is too variant and imperfect, too many separate things  contribute to human behavior, to make it possible to trace all actions  to a single cause. No one familiar with courts and prisons can fail to  observe the close relation between poverty and crime. All lawyers know  that the practice of criminal law is a poor business. Most lawyers of  ability refuse such practice because it offers no financial rewards.  Nearly all the inmates of penal institutions are without money. This is  true of almost all men who are placed on trial. Broad generalizations  have been made from statistics gathered for at least seventy-five years.  It has been noted in every civilized country that the number of property  crimes materially increases in the cold months and diminishes in the  spring, summer and early autumn. The obvious cause is that employment is  less regular in the winter time, expenses of living are higher, idle  workers are more numerous, wages are lower, and, in short, it is harder  for the poor to live. Most men and women spend their whole lives close  to the line of want; they have little or nothing laid by. Sickness, hard  luck, or lack of work makes them penniless and desperate. This drives  many over the uncertain line between lawful and unlawful conduct and  they land in jail. There are more crimes committed in hard times than in  good times. When wages are comparatively high and work is steady fewer  men enter the extra-hazardous occupation of crime. Strikes, lockouts,  panics and the like always leave their list of unfortunates in the  prisons. Every lawyer engaged in criminal practice has noticed the large  numbers of prosecutions and convictions for all sorts of offences that  follow in the wake of strikes and lockouts.    The cost of living has also had a direct effect on crime. Long ago,  Buckle, in his \"_History of Civilization_,\" collected statistics  showing that crime rose and fell in direct ratio to the price of food.  The life, health and conduct of animals are directly dependent upon the  food supply. When the pasture is poor cattle jump the fences. When food  is scarce in the mountains and woods the deer come down to the farms and  villages. And the same general laws that affect all other animal life  affect men. When men are in want, or even when their standard of living  is falling, they will take means to get food or its equivalent that they  would not think of adopting except from need. This is doubly true when a  family is dependent for its daily bread upon its own efforts.    Always bearing in mind that most criminals are men whose equipment and  surroundings have made it difficult for them to make the adjustments to  environment necessary for success in life, we may easily see how any  increase of difficulties will lead to crime. Most men are not well  prepared for life. Even in the daily matter of the way to spend their  money, they lack the judgment necessary to get the most from what they  have. As families increase, debts increase, until many a man finds  himself in a net of difficulties with no way out but crime. Men whose  necessities have led them to embezzlement and larceny turn up so  regularly that they hardly attract attention. Neither does punishment  seem to deter others from following the same path although the danger  of detection, disgrace and prison is perfectly clear.    Sometimes, of course, men of education and apparent lack of physical  defect commit property crimes. Bankers often take money on deposit after  the bank is insolvent. Not infrequently they forge notes to cover losses  and in various ways manipulate funds to prevent the discovery of  insolvency. As a rule the condition of the bank is brought about by the  use of funds for speculation, with the intention of repaying from what  seems to be a safe venture. Sometimes it comes through bad loans and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12058"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#14)"],[1," hundred and  five of them unto the abode of Yama, like the wielder of the thunderbolt  slaying the Danavas. And setting Draupadi free from her bonds, he then,  O king, comforted her. And that mighty-armed and irrepressible  Vrikodara, the son of Pandu, then addressed the distressed princess of  Panchala with face bathed in tears, saying, 'Thus, O timid one, are they  slain that wrong thee without cause. Return, O Krishna, to the city.  Thou hast no longer any fear; I myself will go to the Virata's kitchen  by another route.'\"        [18] Literature, force of his thighs.    Vaisampayana continued, \"It was thus, O Bharata, that a hundred and five  of those Kichakas were slain. And their corpses lay on the ground,  making the place look like a great forest overspread with uprooted trees  after a hurricane. Thus fell those hundred and five Kichakas. And  including Virata's general slain before, the slaughtered Sutas numbered  one hundred and six. And beholding that exceedingly wonderful feat, men  and women that assembled together, were filled with astonishment. And  the power of speech, O Bharata, was suspended in every one.\"      SECTION XXIV    Vaisampayana said, \"And beholding the Sutas slain, the citizens went to  the king, and represented unto him what had happened, saying, 'O king,  those mighty sons of the Sutas have all been slain by the Gandharvas.  Indeed, they lie scattered on the earth like huge peaks of mountains  riven by thunder. _Sairindhri_ also, having been set free, returneth to  thy palace in the city. Alas, O king, if _Sairindhri_ cometh, thy entire  kingdom will be endangered. _Sairindhri_ is endued with great beauty;  the Gandharvas also are exceedingly powerful. Men again, without doubt,  are naturally sexual. Devise, therefore, O king, without delay, such  means that in consequence of wrongs done to _Sairindhri_, thy kingdom  may not meet with destruction.' Hearing those words of theirs, Virata,  that lord of hosts, said unto them, 'Do ye perform the last rites of the  Sutas. Let all the Kichakas be burnt, in one blazing pyre with gems and  fragrant unguents in profusion.' And filled with fear, the king then  addressed his queen Sudeshna, saying, 'When _Sairindhri_ comes back, do  thou tell her these words from me, \"Blessed be thou, O fair-faced  _Sairindhri_. Go thou whithersoever thou likest. The king hath been  alarmed, O thou of graceful hips, at the defeat already experienced at  the hands of the Gandharvas. Protected as thou art by the Gandharvas, I  dare not personally say all this to thee. A woman, however, cannot  offend, and it is for this that I tell thee all this through a woman.\"'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Thus delivered by Bhimasena after the slaughter  of the Sutas, the intelligent and youthful Krishna relieved from all her  fears, washed her limbs and clothes in water, and proceeded towards the  city, like a doe frightened by a tiger. And beholding her, the citizens,  O king, afflicted with the fear of the Gandharvas fled in all  directions. And some of them went so far as to shut their eyes. And  then, O king, at the gate of the kitchen, the princess of Panchala saw  Bhimasena staying, like an infuriate elephant of gigantic proportions.  And looking upon him with wonder-expanded eyes, Draupadi, by means of  words intelligible to them alone, said, 'I bow unto that prince of the  Gandharvas, who hath rescued me.' At these words of her, Bhima said,  'Hearing these words of hers in obedience to whom those persons were  hitherto living in the city, they will henceforth range here, regarding  themselves as freed from the debt.'\"[19]        [19] What Bhima says is this.--The Gandharvas, your husbands,      are always obedient to thee! If they have been able to do thee a      service, they have only repaid a debt.    Vaisampayana continued, \"Then she beheld the mighty-armed Dhananjaya, in  the dancing-hall instructing king Virata's daughters in dancing. And  issuing with Arjuna from the dancing-hall, all those damsels came to  Krishna who had arrived there, and who had been persecuted so sorely,  all innocent though she was. And they said, 'By good luck also it is, O  _Sairindhri_, that thou hast been delivered from thy dangers. By good  luck it is that thou hast returned safe. And by good luck also it is  that those Sutas have been slain that had wronged thee, innocent though  thou art.' Hearing this, Vrihannala said, 'How hast thou, O  _Sairindhri_, been delivered? And how have those sinful wretches been  slain? I wish to learn all this from thee exactly as it occurred.'  _Sairindhri_ replied, 'O blessed Vrihannala, always passing thy days  happily in the apartments of the girls, what concern hast thou with  _Sairindhri's_ fate to say? Thou hast no grief to bear that _Sairindhri_  hath to bear! It is for this, that thou askest me thus, distressed as I  am in ridicule.' Thereat Vrihannala said, 'O blessed one, Vrihannala  also hath unparalleled sorrows of her own. She hath become as low as a  brute. Thou dost not, O girl, understand this. I have lived with thee,  and thou too hast lived with us. When, therefore, thou art afflicted  with misery, who is it that will not, O thou of beautiful hips, feel it?  But no one can completely read another's heart. Therefore it is, O  amiable one, that thou knowest not my heart!'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Then Draupadi, accompanied by those girls  entered the royal abode, desirous of appearing before Sudeshna. And when  she came before the queen, Virata's wife addressed her at the command of  the king, saying, 'Do thou, O _Sairindhri_, speedily go whithersoever  thou likest. The king, good betide thee, hath been filled with fear at  this discomfiture at the hands of the Gandharvas. Thou art, O thou of  graceful eye-brows, young and unparalleled on earth in beauty. Thou art,  besides, an object of desire with men. The Gandharvas again, are  exceedingly wrathful.' Thereat _Sairindhri_ said, 'O beauteous lady, let  the king suffer me to live here for only thirteen days more. Without  doubt, the Gandharvas also will be highly obliged at this. They will  then convey me hence and do what would be agreeable to Virata. Without  doubt, the king, by doing this, with his friends, will reap great  benefit.'\"      SECTION XXV    Vaisampayana said, \"At the slaughter of Kichaka and brothers, people, O  king, thinking of this terrible feat, were filled with surprise. And in  the city and the provinces it was generally bruited about that for  bravery the king's Vallava and Kichaka were both mighty warriors. The  wicked Kichaka, however, had been an oppressor of men and a dishonourer  of other people's wives. And it was for this that wicked of sinful soul  had been slain by the Gandharvas. And it was thus, O king, that people  began to speak, from province to province of the invincible Kichaka,  that slayer of hostile ranks.    \"Meanwhile, the spies employed by Dhritarashtra's son, having searched  various villages and towns and kingdoms and done all that they had been  commanded to do and completed their examination, in the manner directed,  of the countries indicated in their orders, returned to Nagarupa,  gratified with at least one thing that they had learnt.[20] And seeing  Dhritarashtra's son king Duryodhana of the Kuru race seated in his court  with Drona and Karna and Kripa, with the high-souled Bhishma, his own  brothers, and those great warriors--the Trigartas, they addressed him,  saying, 'O lord of men, great hath been the care always bestowed by us  in the search after the sons of Pandu in that mighty forest. Searched  have we through the solitary wilderness abounding with deer and other  animals and overgrown with trees and creepers of diverse kind. Searched  have we also in arbours of matted woods and plants and creepers of every  species, but we have failed in discovering that track by which Pritha's  son of irrepressible energy may have gone. Searched have we in these and  other places for their foot-prints. Searched have we closely, O king, on  mountain tops and in inaccessible fastnesses, in various kingdoms and  provinces teeming with people, in encampments and cities. No trace have  yet been found of the sons of Pandu. Good betide thee, O bull among men,  it seems that they have perished without leaving a mark behind. O  foremost of warriors, although we followed in the track of those  warriors, yet, O best of men, we soon lost their footprints and do not  know their present residence. O lord of men, for some time we followed  in the wake of their charioteers. And making our inquiries duly, we  truly ascertained what we desired to know. O slayer of foes, the  charioteers reached Dwaravati without the sons of Pritha among them. O  king, neither the sons of Pandu, nor the chaste Krishna, are in that  city of Yadavas. O bull of the Bharata race, we have not been able to  discover either their track or their present abode. Salutations to thee,  they are gone for good. We are acquainted with the disposition of the  sons of Pandu and know something of the feats achieved by them. It  behoveth thee, therefore, O lord of men, to give us instructions, O  monarch, as to what we should next do in the search after the sons of  Pandu. O hero, listen also to these agreeable words of ours, promising  great good to thee. King Matsya's commander, Kichaka of wicked soul, by  whom the Trigartas, O monarch, were repeatedly vanquished and slain with  mighty force, now lieth low on the ground with all his brothers, slain,  O monarch, by invisible Gandharvas during the hours of darkness, O thou  of unfading glory. Having heard this delightful news about the  discomfiture of our enemies, we have been exceedingly gratified, O  Kauravya. Do thou now ordain what should next be done.'\"        [20] _Krita-krita_--Nilakantha explains this to mean 'imagining      themselves to have achieved success in their mission' for having      learnt of Kichaka's death,"]]]
