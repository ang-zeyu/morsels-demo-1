He had chosen the black poplar for the canoe because it was the lightest  wood, and would float best. To fell so large a tree had been a great  labour, for the axes were of poor quality, cut badly, and often required  sharpening. He could easily have ordered half-a-dozen men to throw the  tree, and they would have obeyed immediately; but then the individuality  and interest of the work would have been lost. Unless he did it himself  its importance and value to him would have been diminished. It had now  been down some weeks, had been hewn into outward shape, and the larger  part of the interior slowly dug away with chisel and gouge.    He had commenced while the hawthorn was just putting forth its first  spray, when the thickets and the trees were yet bare. Now the May bloom  scented the air, the forest was green, and his work approached  completion. There remained, indeed, but some final shaping and rounding  off, and the construction, or rather cutting out, of a secret locker in  the stern. This locker was nothing more than a square aperture chiselled  out like a mortice, entering not from above but parallel with the  bottom, and was to be closed with a tight-fitting piece of wood driven  in by force of mallet.    A little paint would then conceal the slight chinks, and the boat might  be examined in every possible way without any trace of this hiding-place  being observed. The canoe was some eleven feet long, and nearly three  feet in the beam; it tapered at either end, so that it might be  propelled backwards or forwards without turning, and stem and stern  (interchangeable definitions in this case) each rose a few inches higher  than the general gunwale. The sides were about two inches thick, the  bottom three, so that although dug out from light wood the canoe was  rather heavy.    At first Felix constructed a light shed of fir poles roofed with  spruce-fir branches over the log, so that he might work sheltered from  the bitter winds of the early spring. As the warmth increased he had  taken the shed down, and now as the sun rose higher was glad of the  shade of an adjacent beech.          CHAPTER IV    THE CANOE      Felix had scarcely worked half an hour before Oliver returned and threw  himself on the ground at full length. He had wearied of fishing, the  delicate adjustment of the tackle and the care necessary to keep the  hook and line from catching in the branches had quickly proved too much  for his patience. He lay on the grass, his feet towards the stream which  ran and bubbled beneath, and watched Felix chipping out the block  intended to fit into the secret opening or locker.    \"Is it nearly finished, then?\" he said presently. \"What a time you have  been at it!\"    \"Nearly three months.\"    \"Why did you make it so big? It is too big.\"    \"Is it really? Perhaps I want to put some things in it.\"    \"Oh, I see; cargo. But where are you going to launch it?\"    \"Below the stones there.\"    \"Well, you won't be able to go far; there's an old fir across the river  down yonder, and a hollow willow has fallen in. Besides, the stream's  too shallow; you'll take ground before you get half a mile.\"    \"Shall I?\"    \"Of course you will. That boat will float six inches deep by herself,  and I'm sure there's not six inches by the Thorns.\"    \"Very awkward.\"    \"Why didn't you have a hide boat made, with a willow framework and  leather cover? Then you might perhaps get down the river by hauling it  past the shallows and the fallen trees. In two days' time you would be  in the hands of the gipsies.\"    \"And you would be Sir Constans' heir!\"    \"Now, come, I say; that's too bad. You know I didn't mean that. Besides,  I think I'm as much his heir as you now\" (looking at his sinewy arm);  \"at least, he doesn't listen as much to you. I mean, the river runs into  the gipsies' country as straight as it can go.\"    \"Just so.\"    \"Well, you seem very cool about it!\"    \"I am not going down the river.\"    \"Then, where _are_ you going?\"    \"On the Lake.\"    \"Whew!\" (whistling) \"Pooh! Why, the Lake's--let me see, to Heron Bay  it's quite fifteen miles. You can't paddle across the land.\"    \"But I can put the canoe on a cart.\"    \"Aha! why didn't you tell me before?\"    \"Because I did not wish anyone to know. Don't say anything.\"    \"Not I. But what on earth, or rather, on water, are you driving at?  Where are you going? What's the canoe for?\"    \"I am going a voyage. But I will tell you all when it is ready.  Meantime, I rely on you to keep silence. The rest think the boat is for  the river.\"    \"I will not say a word. But why did you not have a hide boat?\"    \"They are not strong enough. They can't stand knocking about.\"    \"If you want to go a voyage (where to, I can't imagine), why not take a  passage on board a ship?\"    \"I want to go my own way. They will only go theirs. Nor do I like the  company.\"    \"Well, certainly the sailors are the roughest lot I know. Still, that  would not have hurt you. You are rather dainty, Sir Felix!\"    \"My daintiness does not hurt you.\"    \"Can't I speak?\" (sharply)    \"Please yourself.\"    A silence. A cuckoo sang in the forest, and was answered from a tree  within the distant palisade. Felix chopped away slowly and deliberately;  he was not a good workman. Oliver watched his progress with contempt; he  could have put it into shape in half the time. Felix could draw, and  design; he could invent, but he was not a practical workman, to give  speedy and accurate effect to his ideas.    \"My opinion is,\" said Oliver, \"that that canoe will not float upright.  It's one-sided.\"    Felix, usually so self-controlled, could not refrain from casting his  chisel down angrily. But he picked it up again, and said nothing. This  silence had more influence upon Oliver, whose nature was very generous,  than the bitterest retort. He sat up on the sward.    \"I will help launch it,\" he said. \"We could manage it between us, if you  don't want a lot of the fellows down here.\"    \"Thank you. I should like that best.\"    \"And I will help you with the cart when you start.\"    Oliver rolled over on his back, and looked up idly at the white flecks  of cloud sailing at a great height.    \"Old Mouse is a wretch not to give me a command,\" he said presently.    Felix looked round involuntarily, lest any one should have heard; Mouse  was the nick-name for the Prince. Like all who rule with irresponsible  power, the Prince had spies everywhere. He was not a cruel man, nor a  benevolent, neither clever nor foolish, neither strong nor weak; simply  an ordinary, a very ordinary being, who chanced to sit upon a throne  because his ancestors did, and not from any personal superiority.    He was at times much influenced by those around him; at others he took  his own course, right or wrong; at another he let matters drift. There  was never any telling in the morning what he might do towards night, for  there was no vein of will or bias running through his character. In  fact, he lacked character; he was all uncertainty, except in jealousy of  his supremacy. Possibly some faint perception of his own incapacity, of  the feeble grasp he had upon the State, that seemed outwardly so  completely his, occasionally crossed his mind.    Hence the furious scenes with his brother; hence the sudden  imprisonments and equally sudden pardons; the spies and eavesdroppers,  the sequestration of estates for no apparent cause. And, following these  erratic severities to the suspected nobles, proclamations giving  privileges to the people, and removing taxes. But in a few days these  were imposed again, and men who dared to murmur were beaten by the  soldiers, or cast into the dungeons. Yet Prince Louis (the family were  all of the same name) was not an ill-meaning man; he often meant well,  but had no stability or firmness of purpose.    This was why Felix dreaded lest some chance listener should hear Oliver  abuse him. Oliver had been in the army for some time; his excellence in  all arms, and especially with lance and sword, his acknowledged courage,  and his noble birth, entitled him to a command, however lowly it might  be. But he was still in the ranks, and not the slightest recognition had  ever been taken of his feats, except, indeed, if whispers were true, by  some sweet smiles from a certain lady of the palace, who admired  knightly prowess.    Oliver chafed under this neglect.    \"I would not say that kind of thing,\" remarked Felix. \"Certainly it is  annoying.\"    \"Annoying! that is a mild expression. Of course, everyone knows the  reason. If we had any money, or influence, it would be very different.  But Sir Constans has neither gold nor power, and he might have had  both.\"    \"There was a clerk from the notary's at the house yesterday evening,\"  said Felix.    \"About the debts, no doubt. Some day the cunning old scoundrel, when he  can squeeze no more interest out of us, will find a legal quibble and  take the lot.\"    \"Or put us in the Blue Chamber, the first time the Prince goes to war  and wants money. The Blue Chamber will say, 'Where can we get it? Who's  weakest?' 'Why, Sir Constans!' 'Then away with him.'\"    \"Yes, that will be it. Yet I wish a war would happen; there would be  some chance for me. I would go with you in your canoe, but you are going  you don't know where. What's your object? Nothing. You don't know  yourself.\"    \"Indeed!\"    \"No, you don't; you're a dreamer.\"    \"I am afraid it is true.\"    \"I hate dreams.\" After a pause, in a lower voice, \"Have you any money?\"    Felix took out his purse and showed him the copper pieces.    \"The eldest son of Constans Aquila with ten copper pieces,\" growled  Oliver, rising, but taking them all the same. \"Lend them to me. I'll try  them on the board to-night. Fancy me putting down _copper!_ It's  intolerable\" (working himself into a rage). \"I'll turn bandit, and rob  on the roads. I'll go to King Yeo and fight the Welsh."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13962"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 455, September 20, 1884 (#14)"],[1,"occasional  driving of a few wedges and putting on a band or two, it gave no trouble  from leakage, which probably for its entire length did not amount to more  than an average of 3 or 4 cubic feet a minute; from time to time, a little  sawdust was put into the pen-stock. Three stop-gates were placed on the  main, and a separate stop-gate at each shaft, operated by a fine-threaded  screw, so that the water could be cut off when desired.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.]    Fig. 13 shows the arrangement of the machinery for hoisting and pumping,  which was identical at the several shafts, except that the hurdy-gurdies  varied from 161/2 feet in diameter at the upper shaft to 21 feet at the  lowest shaft. The water-wheel moved only in one direction; the pinion on  the wheel-shaft drove the spur-wheel, to which the pitman of the pump-bob  was attached. On the spur-wheel shaft was a friction-gear, driving the  hoisting-reel; this reel was mounted on sliding blocks, so that hoisting  was done by putting it in gear, the empty load being dropped by a  friction-band. Changing the size of the water-wheel as the pressure  increased permitted the use of the same pattern of machinery at the  different shafts. The water was brought to the wheel by a discharge-pipe,  some nine feet long, having a vertical movement by ball-and-socket joint,  so that at pleasure, by dropping the pipe, the machinery could be run at  various speeds, or entirely stopped. At the end of this discharge-pipe  was a cast tapered nozzle, about 31/2 inches in diameter, in which was  inserted a ring of saw-plate steel having the desired diameter, and which  was held in place by an annular screw-cap. By changing the ring, which  only required a few moments' time, any desired amount of water, up to 3 or  4 cubic feet a second, could be discharged against the wheel. The  stop-gate was left wide open while the machinery was running. The pumping  was done by eighteen pumps, of Cornish pattern; the largest amount of  water pumped from any one shaft was something over 30 cubic feet a minute;  the power at hand, however, was ample to pump more than twice that  quantity. It was rather curious at, this shaft to see more water coming  from the pumps than was used on the wheel. The two diamond drills were  driven by a small hurdy-gurdy set on the rear of the drill carriage. This,  but at another tunnel, was afterward modified by placing a separate  hurdy-gurdy on a sleeve on each drill-rod; the advance movement of the  drill being given by hydrostatic pressure on an annular piston, thus doing  away with all gearing. These eight sets of machinery were run for nearly  21/2 years' time; the only break being that of a spur-wheel, doubtless  caused by the careless dropping of a steel bar between it and its pinion.  Aside from this accident, practically not a dollar was spent for repairs,  and the machinery, including the pipe, was in about as good order when the  tunnel was finished as when it was first erected. One man, on a twelve  hour shift, operated the machinery at each shaft, besides dumping the  cars; two men kept the 18 pumps on the line in order, the principal work  being in keeping the suction-pipes for the down-grade headings tight; thus  a force of 18 men was only required for the eight shafts. The cost of the  pipe, gates, etc., when put in place, was $14,631, and of the machinery  about $60,000.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.]    At the Idaho gold quartz mine, situated near Grass Valley, California,  water-power has been introduced during the past year (1883), taking the  place of steam. The supply main is of wrought-iron, 22 inches in diameter,  8,764 feet long, buried in the ground below frost-line. The joints, as a  rule, are riveted together, with occasional lead joints to admit of slight  movements in the pipe.[4] The pipe was coated by placing each joint in a  bath of boiling tar and asphaltum; to insure the most thorough coating, it  is necessary to keep the pipe for ten or fifteen minutes in the boiling  mixture. A cast-iron stop-gate is placed at the lower end of the main, and  also one at each of the branches. Cast-iron man-holes are attached to the  main, which, although they have given no trouble in this particular case,  are very objectionable for high pressures, as it is difficult to avoid  ruptures with cast and wrought-iron combined, owing to the great  difference in the elasticity of the two metals. The long seams of this  pipe are double-riveted, and the round seams single riveted; at the lower  end, iron of No. 6 gauge is used. From the end of the main, the water is  led to the several wheels by branches of smaller diameter.    [Footnote 4: With buried wrought-iron pipe this precaution is unnecessary,  as the elasticity of the iron will admit of the movement due to changes of  temperature, without injury to the rivets.]    The water is delivered at the hoisting-wheel with a total head of 542.6  feet. For power and for mill uses, etc., the required supply is about 8  cubic feet a second; this draught reduces the effective head to say 523  feet.    The work done consists in driving the following described machinery:    A large air-compressor--2 cylinders, double acting, air compressed to 75  pounds--requiring about 140 horse-power.    A line of Cornish pumps, forcing the water from a depth of 1,450 feet  vertical; 12-inch plungers for upper 800 feet, 6-inch plungers for lower  650 feet, with 6-foot stroke, requiring from 55 to 70 horse-power.    Hoisting from a double-compartment shaft--two connected winding reels,  moving separate cages--requiring 35 horse-power, or more.    A few small machine-tools and smithy forges, requiring 3 or 4 horse-power.    A 35-stamp mill, with concentrating apparatus, etc., requiring about 70  horse-power.    The total amount of power required being say 320 horse-power, for which  seven Pelton hurdy-gurdy wheels are employed.    The power in all cases is transmitted by systems of Manila rope belting;  the rope is 2 inches in diameter; the grooves in the sheaves or pulleys  are slightly oval, so that the rope does not go quite to the bottom; the  ropes are horizontal, and run very slack (no tighteners), with no  appreciable slip; the splices are made very long, to obtain uniformity in  diameter.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.]    This method of transmitting power appears to work most perfectly and has  given excellent satisfaction. It is thought, at the Idaho, to be greatly  preferable to the gearing formerly in use when the works were driven by  steam (for such work as pumping or hoisting, leather or rubber belting is  never used), besides being much cheaper in first cost.    The wheel driving the air-compressor is 6 feet in diameter, running 300  turns[5] per minute, with 1-15/18-inch nozzle; three ropes are used from  the wheel shaft to the counter-shaft, and six ropes from the latter to the  fly-wheel shaft.    [Footnote 5: The revolutions per minute, of these wheels, as here given,  are only approximate, as the design was to have the bucket speed=1/2  2(gh)^{1/2}.]    For driving the pumps, there are two water-wheels, set on the same shaft,  one 5 feet and the other 7 feet in diameter, either of which can be used  at will, thus permitting different rates of speed; two nozzles are placed  on each wheel, so that if necessary the power can at any time be doubled.  The smaller wheel has a 1-1/4 inch nozzle, and runs 360 turns a minute;  the larger has 1-1/8-inch nozzle, and makes 270 turns a minute. There are  two ropes from the wheel-shaft to a counter-shaft, and four ropes to the  fly-wheel shaft, on which is the pinion driving the spur-wheel attached to  the pitman of the pump-bob. Hoisting is done by two wheels placed side by  side on the same shaft, the buckets and nozzle of each wheel being placed  in opposite directions. Both wheels are 8 feet in diameter, with  15/16-inch nozzles, and make at full speed about 225 turns a minute.  Reversing the movement of the shaft is done by shutting off water from one  wheel, and turning water on the other wheel; the two water-gates for these  nozzles are quickly opened or closed by hydrostatic pressure, afforded  from the water main. In addition to the usual brakes on the winding-reels,  a brake is placed on the wheel-shaft, so that it can be stopped in a very  short period of time.    The shock to the pipe by the almost instantaneous cutting off the water at  these hoisting-wheels (nearly one cubic foot per second) has not  apparently had any injurious, effect. To lessen this shock, a compensating  balance was designed, but which is not now in use. A wheel, of small  diameter, is used for the smithy, etc., running at a very high velocity.  The wheel driving the stamp-mill is 6 feet in diameter, makes 300  revolutions a minute, and is supplied through a 1-3/16 inch nozzle. The  head of water at this point is a few feet greater than at the other  wheels. Power is transmitted from the hoisting and mill-wheel shafts by  two and four ropes, the same as with the pumping rig. The amount of work  done, or of water used, has not been carefully determined; judging from  the indicator cards taken from the old steam-engines, the managers of the  Idaho believe that an efficiency of fully 80 per cent. of the theoretic  power of the water is obtained on the main driving-shafts of the  machinery. The substitution of water for steam-power has resulted in a  large saving of expense. Although the hills near by are covered with fine  forests, thus making wood cheap, and although a round price is charged for  water by the company furnishing it, the cost of the water is considerably  less than that of the wood formerly used as fuel. The cost of attendance  is altogether in favor of the water-wheels, which hardly require any  attention. The cost of the change from steam to water-power was  $46,496.32.           *       *       *       *       *          TEXAS CREEK PIPE AND AQUEDUCT.      A"]]]
