And then none could ascertain whether it was day or  night, or distinguish the points of the horizon. And, becoming  bewildered, I fixed on my bowstring the weapon called _Pragnastra_. And,  O son of Kunti, the weapon went like unto flakes of pure cotton blown  away by the winds! And a great fight took place, calculated to make the  down on one's body stand on end. And O best of monarchs, having regained  light, I again fought with the enemy!'\"      SECTION XXI    \"Vasudeva said, 'O thou tiger among men, my great enemy king Salwa, thus  encountered by me in battle, again ascended the sky. And O mighty  monarch, inspired with the desire of victory, that wicked one hurled at  me _Sataghnis_, and mighty maces, and flaming lances, and stout clubs,  and as the weapons came along the sky, I speedily resisted them with my  swift arrows, and cut them in two or three pieces before they came at  me. And there was a great noise in the welkins. And Salwa covered  Daruka, and my steeds, and my car also with hundreds of straight shafts.  Then, O hero, Daruka, evidently about to faint, said unto me, \"Afflicted  with the shafts of Salwa I stay in the field, because it is my duty to  do so. But I am incapable of doing so (any longer). My body hath become  weak!\" Hearing these piteous words of my charioteer, I looked at him,  and found the driver wounded with arrows. Nor was there a spot on his  breasts or the crown of his head, or body or his arms which was not, O  thou foremost of sons of Pandu, covered with shafts! And blood flowed  profusely from his wounds inflicted by arrows, and he looked like unto a  mountain of red chalk after a heavy shower. And, O thou of mighty arms,  seeing the charioteer with the reins in his hands thus pierced and  enfeebled by the shafts of Salwa in the field of battle, I cheered him  up!    \"'And, O Bharata, about this time, a certain person, having his home in  Dwaraka quickly coming to my car, addressed me like a friend, delivering  to me, O hero, a message from Ahuka! He seemed to be one of Ahuka's  followers. And sadly and in a voice choked in sorrow, know, O  Yudhishthira, he said words--\"O warrior, Ahuka, the lord of Dwaraka,  hath said these words unto thee! O Kesava, hear what thy father's friend  sayeth: _O son of the Vrishni race, O thou irrepressible one, in thy  absence today Salwa, coming to Dwaraka, hath by main force killed  Vasudeva! Therefore, no need of battle any more. Cease, O Janardana! Do  thou defend Dwaraka! This is thy principal duty!_\"--Hearing these words  of his, my heart became heavy, and I could not ascertain what I should  do and what I should not. And, O hero, hearing of that great misfortune,  I mentally censured Satyaki, and _Baladeva_, and also that mighty  Pradyumna. Having reposed on them the duty of protecting Dwaraka and  Vasudeva, I had gone, O son of the Kuru race, to effect the destruction  of Salwa's city. And in a sorrowful heart, I asked myself,--Doth that  destroyer of foes, the mighty-armed _Baladeva_, live, and Satyaki, and  the son of Rukmini and Charudeshna possessed of prowess, and Shamva and  others? For, O thou tiger among men, these living, even the bearer  himself of the thunderbolt could by no means destroy Suta's son  (Vasudeva)! And, thought I, _It is plain that Vasudeva is dead and  equally plain that the others with Baladeva at their head have been  deprived of life_--This was my certain conclusion. And, O mighty king,  thinking of the destruction of those all, I was overwhelmed with grief!  And it was in this state of mind that I encountered Salwa afresh. And  now I saw, O great monarch, Vasudeva himself falling from the car of  precious metals! And, O warrior I swooned away, and, O king of men, my  sire seemed like unto Yayati after the loss of his merit, falling  towards the earth from heaven! And like unto a luminary whose merit hath  been lost saw my father falling, his head-gear foul and flowing loosely,  and his hair and dress disordered. And then the bow _Sharanga_ dropped  from my hand, and, O son of Kunti I swooned away! I sat down on the side  of the car. And, O thou descendant of the Bharata race, seeing me  deprived of consciousness on the car, and as if dead, my entire host  exclaimed _Oh_! and _Alas_! And my prone father with out-stretched arms  and lower limbs, appeared like a dropping bird. And him thus falling, O  thou of mighty arms, O hero, the hostile warriors bearing in their hands  lances and axes struck grievously! And (beholding this) my heart  trembled! and soon regaining my consciousness, O warrior, I could not  see in that mighty contest either the car of costly metals, or the enemy  Salwa, or my old father! Then I concluded in my mind that it was  certainly illusion. And recovering my senses, I again began to discharge  arrows by hundreds.'\"      SECTION XXII    \"Vasudeva continued, 'Then O thou foremost of the Bharata race, taking  up my beautiful bow, I began to cut off with my arrows the heads of the  enemies of the celestials, from off that car of costly metals! And I  began to discharge from the _Sharanga_ many well-looking arrows of the  forms of snakes, capable of going at a great height and possessing  intense energy. And, O perpetuator of the Kuru race, I could not then  see the car of costly metals, for it had vanished, through illusion! I  was then filled with wonder! That host of Danavas then, O Bharata, of  frightful visages and hair, set up a loud howl while I was waiting for  it, in that fierce battle. I then, with the object of destroying them,  fixed on my bow-string the weapon capable of piercing the foes if but  his sound was inaudible. Upon this, their shouts ceased. But those  Danavas that had sent up that shout were all slain by those shafts of  mine blazing as the Sun himself, and capable of striking at the  perception of sound alone. And after the shout had ceased at one place,  O mighty king, another yell proceeded from another quarter. Thitherto  also I sent my shafts. In this way, O Bharata, the Asuras began to send  up yells in all the ten quarters above and across. These were all slain  by me, _viz_., those that were in the skies and that were invisible,  with arrows of diverse forms, and celestial weapons inspired with  _mantras_. Then, O hero, that car of precious metals capable of going  anywhere at will, bewildering my eyes, reappeared at Pragjyotisha! And  then the destroying Danavas of fierce forms suddenly drowned me with a  mighty shower of rocks. And, O thou foremost of monarchs, torrents of  rocks falling upon me covered me up, and I began to grow like an  ant-hill (with its summits and peaks)! And covered along with my horses  and charioteer and flagstaffs, with crags on all sides, I disappeared  from sight altogether. Then those foremost of heroes of the Vrishni race  who were of my army were struck with panic, and all on a sudden began to  fly in all directions. And beholding me in that plight, O king, the  heaven, the firmament, and the earth were filled with exclamation of  _Oh!_ and _Alas!_ And then, O monarch, my friends filled with sorrow and  grief began to weep and wail with heavy hearts! And delight filled the  hearts of the enemies. And O thou who never waverest, I heard of this  after I had defeated the foe! And then wielding the thunderbolt, that  favourite (weapon) of Indra, capable of riving stones, I destroyed that  entire mass of crags! But my steeds, afflicted with the weight of the  stones and almost on the point of death began to tremble. And beholding  me, all my friends rejoiced again even as men rejoice on seeing the sun  rise in the sky, dispersing the clouds. And seeing my horses almost in  their last gasp for breath, afflicted with that load of stones, my  charioteer said unto me in words suitable to the occasion, \"O thou of  the Vrishni race, behold Salwa the owner of the car of precious metals  sitting (yonder). Do not disregard him! Do thou exert thyself! Do thou  abandon thy mildness and consideration for Salwa. Slay Salwa, O thou of  mighty arms! O Kesava, do not let him live! O hero, O thou destroyer of  those that are not thy friends (enemies), an enemy should be slain with  every exertion! Even a weak enemy who is under the feet of a man endued  with strength, should not be disregarded by the latter: what (shall I  say) of one that dareth us to the fight? Therefore, O thou tiger among  men, putting forth every exertion, slay him, O lord, O thou foremost of  the Vrishni race! Do thou not delay again! This one is not capable of  being vanquished by milder measures. And he cannot in my opinion be thy  friend who is fighting thee and who devastated Dwaraka!\" O Kaunteya,  hearing such words of my charioteer, and knowing that what he said was  true, I directed my attention to the fight (afresh), with the view of  slaying Salwa and destroying the car of costly metals! And, O hero,  saying unto Daruka, \"_Stay a moment_\" I fixed on my bow-string my  favourite weapon of fire, blazing and of celestial origin, of  irresistible force, and incapable of being baffled, bursting with  energy, capable of penetrating into everything, and of great splendour!  And saying, \"_Destroy the car of precious metals together with all those  enemies that are in it_\" I launched with the might of my arms and in  wrath with _mantras_, the great powerful discus _Sudarsana_ which  reduceth to ashes in battle Yakshas and Rakshasas and Danavas and kings  born in impure tribes, sharp-edged like the razor, and without stain,  like unto Yama the destroyer, and incomparable, and which killeth  enemies. And rising into the sky, it seemed like a second sun of  exceeding effulgence at the end of the _Yuga_. And approaching the town  of Saubha whose splendour had disappeared, the discus went right through  it, even as a saw divideth a tall tree. And cut in twain by the energy  of the Sudarsana it fell like the city of Tripura shaken by the shafts  of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11924"],[0,"The Loves of Krishna in Indian Painting and Poetry (#14)"],[1,"in, including the Pandavas and  Kauravas. With them are their wives and families and Kunti, the mother of  the Pandavas, is thus enabled to meet once more her brother, Vasudeva, the  father of Krishna. A little later, Nanda and Yasoda along with the  cowherds and cowgirls also arrive. They have come on the same pilgrimage  and finding Krishna there, at once throng to see him. Vasudeva greets his  old friend, Nanda, and recalls the now long-distant days when Krishna had  lived with him in his house. Krishna and Balarama greet Nanda and Yasoda  with loving respect, while the cowgirls are excited beyond description.  Krishna however refuses to regard them and faced with their ardent looks  and impassioned adoration, addresses to them the following sermon.  'Whoever believes in me shall be fearlessly carried across the sea of  life. You gave me your bodies, minds and wealth. You loved me with a love  that knew no limit. No one has been so fortunate as you--neither Brahma  nor Indra, neither any other god nor any man. For all along I have been  living in you, loving you with a love that has never faltered. I live in  everyone. What I say to you cannot easily be understood, but as light,  water, fire, earth and air abide in the body, so does my glory.' To the  cowgirls such words strike chill. But there is nothing they can say and  when the festival is over, Krishna and the Yadavas return to Dwarka, while  Nanda with the cowherds and cowgirls go back to Brindaban. This is the  last time Krishna sees them.    This dismissal reveals how final is Krishna's severance from his former  life, yet provided the cowherds are not involved, he is quick to honour  earlier relationships. One day in Dwarka his mother, Devaki, tells him  that she has a private grief--grief at the loss of the six elder brothers  of Krishna slain by the tyrant Kansa. Krishna tells her not to mourn,  descends to the third of the three worlds, interviews its ruler, Raja  Bali, and effects the release of the six brothers. Returning with them, he  gives them to his mother and her joy is great.    On another occasion he is visited by Sudama, a Brahman who had lived with  him, when, after slaying the tyrant, he and Balarama had gone for  instruction to their spiritual preceptor. Since then Sudama has grown thin  and poor. The thatch on his hut has tumbled down. He has nothing to eat.  His wife is alarmed at their abject state and advises him to seek out  Krishna, his chief friend. 'If you go to him,' she says, 'our poverty will  end because it is he who grants wealth and virtue, fulfils desires and  bestows final happiness.' Sudama replies that even Krishna does not give  anyone anything without that person giving him something first. As he has  not given, how can he hope to receive? His wife then ties up a little rice  in an old white cloth and gives it to Sudama as a present to Krishna.  Sudama sets out. On reaching Dwarka, he is admitted to Krishna's presence,  is immediately recognized and is treated with the utmost kindness and  respect. Krishna himself washes his feet and reveres him as a Brahman.[40]  'Brother,' he says, 'from the time you quitted our preceptor's house, I  have heard nothing of you. Your coming has purified my house and made me  happy.' Krishna then notices the rice and laughingly asks Sudama what  present his wife has sent him and why it is hidden under his arm. Sudama  is greatly abashed but allows Krishna to take the bundle. On taking it,  Krishna eats the rice. He then conducts Sudama within, feasts him on  delicacies and puts him to bed. During the night he sends Visvakarma, the  divine architect, to Sudama's home, with instructions to turn it into a  palace. The next morning Sudama takes leave of Krishna, congratulating  himself on not having asked Krishna for anything. As he nears home, he is  dismayed to find no trace of his hut, but instead a golden palace. He  approaches the gate-keeper and is told it belongs to Sudama, the friend of  Krishna. His wife comes out and he finds her dressed in fine clothes and  jewels and attended by maid-servants. She takes him in and at first he is  abashed at so much wealth. Krishna, he reflects, can only have given it to  him because he doubted his affection. He did not ask Krishna for wealth  and cannot fathom why he has been given it. His wife assures him that  Krishna knows the thoughts of everyone. Sudama did not ask for wealth, but  she herself desired it and that is why Krishna has given it to them.  Sudama is convinced and says no more.    All these incidents provide a clue to Krishna's nature. They illustrate  his attitudes, confirm him in his role as protector and preserver and show  him in a new light--that of a guardian and upholder of morality. He is  still a fervent lover, but his love is sanctioned and formalized by legal  marriage. Moreover, a new respect characterizes his dealings with Brahmans  and his approach to festivals. Instead of the young revolutionary, we now  meet a sage conservative. These changes colour his final career.    As life at Dwarka runs its course, Krishna's activities centre more and  more on wars with demons and his relations with the Pandavas. Despite his  prowess and renown, demons trouble the Yadavas from time to time, but all  are killed either by Krishna wielding a magic quoit or by Balarama plying  his plough or pestle. On one occasion, a monkey demon runs amok, harassing  the people and ravaging the country. He surprises Balarama bathing in a  tank with his wives, despoils their clothes and defiles their pitchers. A  great combat then ensues, the monkey hurling trees and hills while  Balarama counters with his plough and pestle. But the outcome is hardly in  doubt and at last the monkey is killed.    On another occasion, Krishna is compelled to intervene in force. Following  his marriage with his first queen, Rukmini, a son, Pradyumna has been  born. He is no less a person than Kama, the god of love, whom Siva has  burnt for disturbing his meditations. When grown up, Pradyumna is married  to a cousin, the daughter of his uncle, Rukma. Rukma has never forgiven  Krishna for abducting and marrying his sister, Rukmini, and despite their  intimate alliance is sworn to kill him. His plot is discovered and in a  final contest, Balarama kills him. Meanwhile, Pradyumna has had a son,  Aniruddha, who grows up into a charming youth, while at the same time  Vanasura, a demon with a thousand arms, has a lovely daughter, Usa. When  Usa is twelve years old, she longs for a husband and in a dream sees and  embraces Aniruddha. She does not know who he is, but describes him to a  confidante. The latter draws pictures of all the leading royalty, and  among the Yadavas, Usa recognizes her love, Aniruddha. The confidante  agrees to bring him to her and going through the air to Dwarka, finds him  sleeping, dreaming of Usa. She transports him to Usa's palace and on  waking. Aniruddha finds himself alone with his love. Usa conceals him, but  the news reaches her father and he surrounds the palace with his demon  army. Aniruddha routs the army but is caught by Vanasura, who then  imprisons the two young lovers. News now reaches Krishna who rushes an  army to the scene. A battle ensues during which Vanasura loses all his  arms save four. He then worships Krishna, and Aniruddha and Usa are  married.    Meanwhile Krishna is carefully maintaining relations with the Pandavas. We  have seen how immediately after the slaying of the tyrant he sends an  envoy to inquire after his aunt Kunti, the sister of his father, and  mother of the five Pandavas. We have also noticed how during a visit to  the Pandava court, he has acquired a new queen, Kalindi. He now embarks on  several courses of action, each of which is designed to cement their  relations. During a visit to his court, Arjuna, the brother whose lucky  shot won Draupadi for the Pandavas, falls in love with Subhadra, Krishna's  sister. Krishna is delighted to have him as a brother-in-law and as  already narrated in the epic, he advises Arjuna to marry her by capture. A  little later Krishna learns that Yudhisthira will shortly proclaim himself  a 'ruler of the world' and decides to visit the Pandava court to assist at  the sacrifice. He takes a vast army with him and advances on the court  with massive splendour. As he arrives, he learns that Jarasandha whose  feud is unabated has now imprisoned twenty thousand rajas, all of whom cry  to be released. Krishna decides that Jarasandha's demon activities must be  ended once for all and taking two of the Pandavas with him, Bhima and  Arjuna, he sets out to destroy him. Jarasandha elects to engage Bhima in  single-handed combat and for twenty-seven days the fight proceeds, each  wielding a club and neither securing the advantage. Krishna now learns  that Jarasandha can only be killed if he is split in two. He directs  Bhima, therefore, to throw him down, place a foot on one of his thighs and  catching the other leg with his hand, tear him asunder. Bhima does so and  in this way Jarasandha is destroyed. The captive rajas are now released  and after returning home they foregather at the Pandavas' court to assist  at the sacrifice.    As arrangements proceed an incident occurs which illustrates yet again the  complex situation arising from Krishna's dual character. Krishna is God,  yet he is also man. Being a man, it is normally as a man that he is  regarded. Yet from time to time particular individuals sense his Godhead  and then he is no longer man but God himself. Even those, however, who  view him as God do so only for brief periods of time and hence the  situation is constantly arising in which Krishna is one moment honoured as  God and then a moment later is treated as a man. And it is this situation  which now recurs.    As we have already seen in the epic, part of the custom at imperial  sacrifices was to offer presents to distinguished guests, and according to  the epic "]]]
