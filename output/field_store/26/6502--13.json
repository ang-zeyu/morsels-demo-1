The master is steering for that narrow opening  between these two great rocks ahead. It will be but two or three  minutes now before our fate is decided.\"    At this moment Harold shouted:    \"Let each man make his peace with God.\" And baring his head he stood  silently for a minute or two, imitated by all on board. Then Harold  again raised his voice in a shout that was heard above the storm:    \"Move forward now all of you, but not further forward than the mast;  for if her head were too far down the master could not hold her  straight. Moreover, the mast will assuredly fall forward and crush  those in front of it. Therefore, let no man go forward of it until  the ship strikes.\"    The sailors had already cut away the canvas stretched across the  bow, and all on board clustered just aft the mast. Wulf looked back,  and saw the master standing alone on the poop, with his eyes fixed  in front of him and a look of grim resolve on his face. Then he  turned again to look ahead. The scene was terrible. On either side  extended a long line of white foam. Great masses of water were  hurled against the rocks with a thundering crash, and the spray  flew high up into the air, and then, caught by the wind, was carried  far inland. The rocks were now but a few lengths ahead, and the  passage between them looked terribly narrow, so narrow that he  doubted if the ship could possibly pass through them. Not a word  was spoken on board as the ship neared the opening. Now she swerved  a little to one side, now a little to the other, as the waves lifted  her stern and swept her along, but the hand of the master checked  her immediately, and brought her head back to the line.    She was but a length away from the passage when there was a crash  that shook her from stem to stern; then another great wave lifted  her, and Wulf saw a black wall of rock gleaming with the water that  streamed down it. The wall of rock flashed past the bulwarks so  closely that he could have touched it. A moment later the ship struck  again, this time with a force that threw many off their feet, while  the mast fell over the bow. Then once more she lifted, shot a few  feet further, then struck with tremendous force and remained  stationary.    There was a grinding and splintering of planks, as the men rushed  forward, and then a wave swept over the vessel, carrying all on  deck before it into the cove beyond the rock, rolling them over and  over up a sandy shore behind. Some managed to dig their hands and  feet into the sand and to scramble out; more were sucked back again  by the receding waters. As Wulf found himself in the water he felt  his arm clutched, and Osgod shouted in his ear: \"Do not struggle,  I can keep you up!\"    When thrown up on the sand Wulf tried in vain to resist the backward  rush of the water; he and Osgod were borne out again. When the next  wave again swept them up Wulf saw the earl standing knee-deep in  the water, and as he was swept past, Harold seized him and Osgod,  and with tremendous strength lifted them right out of the water.  \"Keep still!\" he shouted; \"your weight will help me to keep my  feet.\" Wulf felt his supporter quiver as the water rushed out, for  he was waist-deep now; but directly afterwards he set them both  down on their feet, saying, \"Run before the next wave comes.\" Ten  yards farther and they were beyond the reach of the sea. Harold  was with them, and directed those who had got ashore to form lines,  taking hold of each other's hands, and so to advance far into the  surf and grasp their comrades as they were swept up. Many were saved  in this way, although some of the rescuers were badly hurt by  floating pieces of wreckage, for the vessel had entirely broken up  immediately after her course had been arrested.    As soon as all who could be seen were brought ashore it was found  that ten men were missing, among whom was the master of the ship,  most of them having probably been struck by floating timbers. As  soon as it was certain that no more would come ashore alive Harold  called the men together. Rough litters were made of oars and pieces  of sail, for the conveyance of those who had broken limbs or were  too much injured to walk, and the party prepared for a start. By  this time several men, apparently of the fishing class, had approached,  but stood a short distance away, evidently waiting for the departure  of the party before beginning the work of collecting whatever the  sea might cast up. Harold went over to them, and asked in the Norman  tongue:    \"What shore is this, and how far is it to the nearest town where  we can obtain shelter and assistance?\"    \"You are in Ponthieu, in the territories of Count Conrad. The town  of St. Valery is but two miles along the coast. There you can obtain  all you need.\"    Returning to his men, Harold ordered the wounded to be raised, and  the party at once set out. Harold had already taken off his gold  chain and rings, and had told his companions to do the same, in  order that the cupidity of the natives might not be excited nor  their rank guessed at. As soon as they started Wulf went up to him.    \"My lord,\" he said, \"I fear that you have already been recognized  by one of the fishermen. I saw him looking earnestly at you, and  then whisper to one of his companions. After doing so he hurried  away.\"    \"That is bad news, Wulf; but I could hardly expect that I should  be long unrecognized. There are many vessels come and go between  the northern ports and our own, and in St. Valery there must be  numbers of sailors and fishermen who have seen me in London. Besides,  we are sure to be questioned by the count as to our rank and  condition, and even could we conceal it for a while, the news is  certain to be brought ere long from England of our having been blown  off the coast, and when it was known it would be speedily guessed  that we were the missing party. Hark you, Wulf; I have never heard  aught good of Count Conrad, and one cannot say what steps he may  take to force us to pay a heavy ransom, but it is like enough that  he will do all he can to prevent the news of my being in his hands  from reaching the ears of the duke. It is likely that you and Beorn,  being but lads, will be watched less rigorously than the rest of  us. Should this be so, try, if you find an opportunity, to send the  news to the duke that we are all held prisoners here. I shall, of  course, endeavour to communicate with him, but some chance may occur  by which you can do so more readily than I can.\"    \"I will try to do so, my lord; but I trust this Norman count will  treat you with all due honour and courtesy.\"    Wulf then fell back to Beorn's side, and half an hour later the  shipwrecked party entered the gates of St. Valery. The townspeople  flocked round them, and as soon as they learned that they were a  party of shipwrecked Saxons who had been blown by the gale from  England, they were led to the house of the officer in command of  the town. He asked them a few questions, saying, \"I must refer the  matter to the count. By the usages of our land all who are cast  upon it become his prisoners, to be put to ransom or otherwise as  he may decide. However, food shall be supplied you at once, but  you must be content to remain under guard until his pleasure is  known.\"    They were accordingly at once placed in a disused granary, under  the charge of a strong guard. Food was brought to them, and as soon  as they had consumed this, most of the men threw themselves on the  ground, worn out by their long exertions.    \"This is a sorry welcome, Wulf, after our escape from the sea,\"  Beorn said. \"Truly the land seems as inhospitable as the ocean.\"    \"It is not pleasant, Beorn, but at present I feel so thankful for  my escape from those terrible waves that even the thought that we  are all prisoners to this petty noble does not greatly concern me.  Doubtless William of Normandy, who is the liege lord of the land,  will speedily take us out of his hands. Were we alone it may be  that we should suffer a long stay in his dungeons, but Harold and  his brother are far too important personages to be allowed to remain  in the hands of one of the duke's vassals.\"    \"It is shameful,\" Beorn said indignantly. \"I do not say that those  who are cast on our shores may not be often pillaged and ill-treated  by the common folk, but surely none of gentle blood would fail to  show them kindness and hospitality.\"    \"That is so on our coast of Sussex, but I have heard that further  west, and certainly among the Danes of Northumbria, vessels cast  on the coast are considered as gifts from the sea, and even the  lives of those who gain the shore are not often respected. I regret  much that Harold should be with us. It is true that his being here  will doubtless shorten the term of our imprisonment, but it is  unfortunate that he should fall into the hands of William, who is  as famous for craft and subtlety as he is for bravery and skill as  a leader.\"    \"But what can he gain from Harold?\" Beorn asked. \"Our earl is  well-nigh as much known throughout Europe as William of Normandy,  and all Christendom would cry out with shame were he treated with  ought but courtesy by the duke.\"    \"I doubt not that he will treat him with courtesy, Beorn, but he  may well wring some concessions from him before he lets him depart.  He may bargain that the Normans may be again allowed to hold land  in England, and to build their castles, as they did before Godwin  and his sons returned from exile, and the Normans had to fly the  land, save those around the person of the king. He may beg so many  bishoprics for Norman priests. There is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8770"],[0,"Milton (#13)"],[1," as that of Shakspeare. But no inference can be founded  upon the absolute number of words used by any writer. We must know,  not the total of different words, but the _proportion_ of different  words to the whole of any writer's words. Now to furnish a list of  100 different words the English Bible requires 531 common words,  Shakspeare 164, Milton 135 only. This computation is founded on the  poems; it would be curious to have the same test tried upon the prose  writings, though no such test can be as trustworthy as the educated  ear of a listener to a continued reading.    It is no part of a succinct biography, such as the present, to furnish  an account in detail of the various controversies of the time, as  Milton engaged in them. The reader will doubtless be content with the,  bare indication of the subjects on which he wrote. The whole number of  Milton's political pamphlets Is twenty-five. Of these, twenty-one are  written in English, and four in Latin, Of the _Tractate of Education_  and the four divorce pamphlets something has been already said. Of the  remaining twenty, nine, or nearly half, relate to church government,  or ecclesiastical affairs; eight treat of the various crises of the  civil strife; and two are personal vindications of himself against one  of his antagonists. There remains one tract of which the subject is of  a more general and permanent nature, the best known of all the series,  _Areopagitica: A Speech for the Liberty of unlicensed Printing, to the  Parliament of England_. The whole series of twenty-five extends over  a period of somewhat less than twenty years; the earliest, viz., _Of  Reformation touching Church Discipline in England, and the Causes that  hitherto have hindered it_, having been published in 1641; the latest,  entitled, _A ready and easy way to establish a free Commonwealth_,  coming out in March, 1660, after the torrent of royalism had set in,  which was to sweep away the men and the cause to which Milton had  devoted himself. Milton's pen thus accompanied the whole of the  Puritan revolution from the modest constitutional opposition in  which It commenced, through its unexpected triumph, to its crushing  overthrow by the royalist and clerical reaction.    The autumn of 1641 brought with it a sensible lull in the storm of  revolutionary passion. Indeed, there began to appear all the symptoms  of a reaction, and of the formation of a solid conservative party,  likely to be strong enough to check, or even to suppress, the  movement. The impulse seemed to have spent itself, and a desire for  rest from political agitation began to steal over the nation. Autumn  and the harvest turn men's thoughts towards country occupations and  sports. The King went off to Scotland in August; the Houses adjourned  till the 20th October. The Scottish army had been paid off, and had  repassed the border; the Scottish commissioners and preachers had left  London.    It was a critical moment for the Puritan party. Some very considerable  triumphs they had gained. The archenemy Strafford had been brought to  the block; Laud was in the tower; the leading members of Convocation,  bishops, deans, and archdeacons, had been heavily fined; the Star  Chamber and the High Commission Court had been abolished; the Stannary  and Forestal jurisdictions restrained. But the Puritan movement aimed  at far more than this. It was not only that the root-and-branch men  were pushing for a generally more levelling policy, but the whole  Puritan party was committed to a struggle with the hierarchy of the  Established Church. It was not so much that they demanded more and  more reform, with the growing appetite of revolution, but that as  long as bishops existed, nothing that had been wrested from them was  secure. The Puritans could not exist in safety side by side with  a church whose principle was that there was no church without the  apostolic succession. The abolition of episcopacy and the substitution  of the Presbyterian platform was, so it then seemed, a bare measure  of necessary precaution, and not merely the extravagant demand of  dissatisfied spirits. Add to this, that it was well understood by  those near enough to the principal actors in the drama, that the  concessions made by the Court had been easily made, because they could  be taken back, when the time should come, with equal ease. Even the  most moderate men, who were satisfied with the amount of reform  already obtained, must have trembled at its insecurity. The Puritan  leaders must have viewed with dismay the tendency in the nation  towards a reaction in favour of things as they were.    It was upon this condition of the public mind that Milton persistently  poured pamphlet after pamphlet, successive vials of apocalyptic wrath.  He exhausts all the resources of rhetoric, and plays upon every note  in the gamut of public feeling; that he may rouse the apathetic,  confirm the wavering, dumbfound the malignant; where there was zeal,  to fan it into flame; where there was opposition, to sow and browbeat  it by indignant scorn and terrific denunciation. The first of these  manifestoes was (1) _Of Reformation touching Church Discipline_, of  which I have already spoken. This was immediately followed by (2)  _Of Prelaticall Episcopacy_. This tract was a reply, in form, to a  publication of Archbishop Usher. It was about the end of May, 1641,  that Usher had come forward on the breach with his _Judgment of Dr.  Rainolds touching the Original of Episcopacy_, Rainolds, who had been  President of Corpus (1598-1607), had belonged to the Puritan party in  his day, had refused a bishopric, and was known, like Usher himself,  to be little favourable to the exclusive claims of the high  prelatists. He was thus an unexceptionable witness to adduce in  favour of the apostolic origin of the distinction between bishop and  presbyter. Usher, in editing Rainolds' opinions, had backed them up  with all the additional citations which his vast reading could supply.    Milton could not speak with the weight that attached to Usher, the  most learned Churchman of the age, who had spent eighteen years in  going through a complete course of fathers and councils. But, in the  first paragraph of his answer, Milton adroitly puts the controversy  upon a footing by which antiquarian research is put out of court.  Episcopacy is either of human or divine origin. If of human origin, it  may be either retained or abolished, as may be found expedient. If of  divine appointment, it must be proved to be so out of Scripture. If  this cannot be proved out of inspired Scripture, no accumulation of  merely human assertion of the point can be of the least authority.  Having thus shut out antiquity as evidence in the case, he proceeds  nevertheless to examine his opponent's authorities, and sets them  aside by a style of argument which has more of banter than of  criticism.    One incident of this collision between Milton, young and unknown, and  the venerable prelate, whom he was assaulting with the rude wantonness  of untempered youth, deserves to be mentioned here. Usher had  incautiously included the Ignatian epistles among his authorities.  This laid the most learned man of the day at the mercy of an adversary  of less reading than himself. Milton, who at least knew so much  suspicion of the genuineness of these remains as Casaubon's  _Exercitations on Baronius_ and Vedelin's edition (Geneva, 1623) could  suggest, pounced upon this critical flaw, and delightedly denounced  in trenchant tones this \"Perkin Warbeck of Ignatius,\" and the  \"supposititious offspring of some dozen epistles.\" This rude shock it  was which set Usher upon a more careful examination of the Ignatian  question. The result was his well-known edition of Ignatius, printed  1642, though not published till 1644, in which he acknowledged the  total spuriousness of nine epistles, and the partial interpolation of  the other six. I have not noticed in Usher's _Prolegomena_ that he  alludes to Milton's onslaught. Nor, indeed, was he called upon to  do so in a scientific investigation, as Milton had brought no  contribution to the solution of the question beyond sound and fury.    Of Milton's third pamphlet, entitled (3) _Animadversions on the  Remonstrants defence against Smectymnuus_, it need only be said that  it is a violent personal onfall upon Joseph Hall, bishop, first, of  Exeter and afterwards of Norwich. The bishop, by descending into the  arena of controversy, had deprived himself of the privilege which his  literary eminence should have secured to him. But nothing can excuse  or reconcile us to the indecent scurrility with which he is assailed  in Milton's pages, which reflect more discredit on him who wrote them,  than on him against whom they are written.    The fifth pamphlet, called (5) _An Apology against a Pamphlet called  \"A Modest Confutation, &c.\"_ (1642), is chiefly remarkable for a  defence of his own Cambridge career. A man who throws dirt, as Milton  did, must not be surprised if some of it comes back to him. A son of  Bishop Hall, coming forward as his father's champion and avenger,  had raked up a garbled version of Milton's quarrel with his tutor  Chappell, and by a further distortion, had brought it out in the shape  that, \"after an inordinate and violent youth spent at the university,\"  Milton had been \"vomited out thence.\" From the university this  \"alchemist of slander\" follows him to the city, and declares that  where Milton's morning haunts are, he wisses not, but that his  afternoons are spent in playhouses and bordelloes. Milton replies to  these random charges by a lengthy account of himself and his studious  habits. As the reader may expect a specimen of Milton's prose style, I  quote a part of this autobiographical paragraph:--    \"I had my time, as others have who have good learning bestowed upon  them, to be sent to those places where the opinion was it might be  sooner"]]]
