But in the presence of the Holy  One--blessed be He!--Israel is more beloved than the ministering angels;  for Israel reiterates the song every hour, while the ministering angels  repeat it only once a day, some say once a week, others once a month,  others once a year, others once in seven years, others once in a  jubilee, and others only once in eternity. Again, Israel mentions The  Name after two words, as it is said (Deut. vi. 4), \"Hear Israel,  Yehovah,\" but the ministering angels do not mention The Name till after  three, as it is written (Isa. vi. 3), \"Holy! holy! holy! Yehovah  Zebaoth.\" Moreover, the ministering angels do not take up the song above  till Israel has started it below; for it is said (Job xxxviii. 7), \"When  the morning stars sang together, then all the sons of God shouted for  joy.\"    _Chullin_, fol. 91, col. 2.    The Rabbis have taught, a man should not sell to his neighbor shoes made  from the hide of a beast that has died of disease, as if of a beast that  had been slaughtered in the shambles, for two reasons: first, because he  imposes on him (for the skin of a beast that dies of itself is not so  durable as the hide of a slaughtered animal); second, because there is  danger (for the beast that died of itself might have been stung by a  serpent, and the poison remaining in the leather might prove fatal to  the wearer of shoes made of that leather). A man should not send his  neighbor a barrel of wine with oil floating upon its surface; for it  happened once that a man did so, and the recipient went and invited his  friends to a feast, in the preparation of which oil was to form a chief  ingredient; but when the guests assembled, it was found out that the  cask contained wine, and not oil; and because the host had nothing else  in preparation for a worthy feast, he went and committed suicide.  Neither should guests give anything from what is set before them to the  son or daughter of their host, unless the host himself give them leave  to do so; for it once happened during a time of scarcity that a man  invited three of his friends to dine, and he had nothing but three eggs  to place before them. Meanwhile, as the guests were seated at the board,  the son of the host came into the room, and first one of the guests gave  him his share, and then the other two followed his example. Shortly  afterward the host himself came in, and seeing the child with his mouth  full and both hands, he knocked him down to the ground, so that he died  on the instant. The mother, seeing this, went and threw herself  headlong, from the housetop, and the father followed her example. Thus  Rabbi Eliezar ben Yacob said, \"There perished in this affair three souls  of Israel.\"    Ibid., fol. 94, col. 1.    Once the Roman Government issued a decree that the Israelites should  neither observe the Sabbath nor circumcise their sons. Thereupon Reuben  the son of Istrubli trimmed his hair as a Gentile, and went among the  Roman senators and plied them with wise remonstrance. \"If one,\" said he,  \"has an enemy, does he wish him to be poor or rich?\" \"To be poor,\" was  the reply. \"Then,\" he argued, \"won't he be poorer if you prohibit him  from working on the Sabbath?\" \"It is well said,\" observed the senators;  and they at once abolished their decree respecting the Sabbath. Again he  asked, \"If one has an enemy, does he wish him to be weak or strong?\"  \"Why, weak, to be sure,\" was the inevitable answer. \"Then,\" said he,  \"let the Jews circumcise their children, then will they be weakened.\"  \"The argument is good,\" said they, and the decree against circumcision  was rescinded. Again he asked, \"If one has an enemy, does he wish him to  increase or decrease?\" \"To decrease, of course,\" said they. In response  to his argument the decree against catamenia was accordingly abolished.  When, however, they found out that he was a Jew, they at once re-enacted  the decrees they had canceled. Upon this the question arose who should  go to Rome and appeal against these enactments. It was resolved that  Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai, who was reputed experienced in miracles, should  go, accompanied by Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Yossi.... As they  journeyed along, the question was proposed to them, \"Whence is it proved  that the blood of a reptile is unclean?\" Rabbi Elazar replied with a  curl of the lip, and quoted Lev. ii. 29. \"And these shall be unclean  unto you.\" Rabbi Shimon said unto him, \"By the curl of thy lip art thou  recognizable as a disciple of the wise! May the son never return to his  father!\" for he was annoyed that he should presume to teach a Halachah  in his presence, and then and there he condemned him to death. (See  _Berachoth_, fol. 31, col. 2.) Thereupon Ben Temalion (an evil sprite or  imp) came, and greeting him, said, \"Do ye wish me to accompany you?\"  Rabbi Shimon wept and said, \"Alas! a maid-servant of my ancestor  (Abraham) was assisted by three angels, and I have not one to attend me!  However, let a miracle be worked for us anyhow.\" Then the evil spirit  entered into the Emperor's daughter, and when the Rabbi was called in to  cure the princess, he exorcised the spirit by saying, \"Depart, Ben  Temalion! Ben Temalion, depart!\" and the evil spirit left her. By way of  reward the Rabbis were bidden to ask whatsoever they pleased, and  admitted into the imperial treasury that they might choose what seemed  good to them. Espying there the edict against Israel, they chose it, and  tore it to pieces.    _Meyilah_, fol. 17, col. 1, 2.    At the time when the high priest enters to worship, three acolytes take  hold of him, one by the right hand and another by the left, while the  third lifts the gems attached to the train of his pontifical vestment.    _Tamid_, chap. 7; _Mishna_, 1.    \"I once, when a grave-digger,\" says Abba Shaul, as the Rabbis relate,  \"chased a roe which had entered the shinbone of a dead man; and though I  ran three miles after it, I could not overtake it, nor reach the end of  the bone. When I returned, I was told that it was a bone of Og, king of  Bashan.\"    _Niddah_, fol. 24, col. 2.    The Rabbis have taught that during the first three months (of pregnancy)  the child lies in the lower part (of the uterus); during the next three  it occupies the middle part; and during the last three it is in the  upper part; and that when the time of parturition comes, it turns over  first, and this causes the birth-pains. We are also taught that the  pains caused by a female child are greater than those caused by a male.  Rabbi Elazar said, \"What Scripture is there for this? 'When I was made  in secret and curiously wrought, in the lowest parts of the earth' (Ps.  cxxxix. 15). It is not said, 'I abode,' but, 'I was curiously wrought.'  Why the difference? Why are the pains caused by a girl greater than  those caused by a boy?\"    Ibid., fol. 31, col. 1.    The Rabbis teach there are three that have a share in a man; God, and  his father and mother. The father's part consists of all that is white  in him--the bones, the veins, the nails, the brain, and the white of the  eye. The mother's part consists of all that is red in him--the skin, the  flesh, the hair, and the black part of the eye. God's part consists of  the breath, the soul, the physiognomy, sight and hearing, speech, motive  power, knowledge, understanding, and wisdom. And when the time comes  that the man should depart from the world, God takes away His part, and  leaves those which belong to the father and mother. Rav Pappa says,  \"This is the meaning of the proverb, 'Shake off the salt and throw the  flesh to the dogs.'\"    _Niddah_, fol. 31. col. 1.        Rashi's explanatory note is this: \"Shake off the salt from the      flesh and it becomes fit only for dogs. The soul is the salt      which preserves the body; when it departs, the body putrefies.\"    Four things require fortitude in the observance:--The law, good works,  prayer, and social duties. Respecting the law and good works it is  written (Josh. i. 7), \"Be thou strong and firm, that thou mayest observe  to do all the law;\" in which the word \"strong\" refers to the law, and  the word \"firm\" to good works. Of prayer it is written, \"Wait on the  Lord; be strong, and He shall make thine heart firm; wait, I say, upon  the Lord\" (Ps. xxvii. 14). In respect to social duties it is written (2  Sam. x. 2), \"Be strong, and let us strengthen ourselves for our people,  and for the cities of our God.\"    _Berachoth_, fol. 32, col. 2.    There are four signs which tell tales:--Dropsy is a sign of sin;  jaundice is a sign of hatred without a cause; poverty is a sign of  pride; and quinsy is a sign of slander.    _Shabbath_, fol. 33, col. 1.    \"Unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah,\" i.e., four (Gen. xxxv. 27). Rabbi  Isaac calls it the city of four couples, i.e., Adam and Eve, Abraham and  Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah. These four couples being  buried in Mamre, it was therefore called \"the city of four.\"    _Eiruvin_, fol. 53, col. 1.    The sun makes four quarterly circuits. In April, May, and June, i.e.,  Nisan, Iyar, and Sivan, his circuit is between the mountains, in order  to dissolve the snow; in July, August, and September, i.e., Tamuz, Ab,  and Ellul, his circuit is over the habitable parts of the earth, in  order to ripen the fruits; in October, November, and December, i.e.,  Tishri, Marcheshvan, and Kislev, his circuit is over the seas, to  evaporate the waters; in January, February, and March, i.e., Tebeth,  Shebat, and Adar, his circuit is over the deserts, in order to protect  the seed sown from being scorched.    _Psachim_, fol. 94, col. 2.    Four persons are intolerable:--A poor man who is proud, a rich man who  is a liar, an old man who is incontinent, and a warden who behaves  haughtily to a community for whom he has done nothing.

On inquiry I learnt that it was usual to prepare such  a \"Soonium\" when one lay sick unto death;  as throwing it on another was  the only means of rescuing the sick one, and woe to the unfortunate who  broke a thread by stumbling over it!    --E.H. Morgan          Shamanism and Witchcraft Amongst the Kolarian Tribes      Having resided for some years amongst the Mimdas and Hos of Singbhoom,  and Chutia Nagpur, my attention was drawn at times to customs differing  a good deal in some ways, but having an evident affinity to those  related of the Nilghiri \"Curumbers\" in Mrs. Morgan's article.  I do not  mean to say that the practices I am about to mention are confined simply  to the Kolarian tribes, as I am aware both Oraons (a Dravidian tribe),  and the different Hindu castes living side by side with the Kols, count  many noted wizards among their number;  but what little I have come to  know of these curious customs, I have learnt among the Mimdas and Hos,  some of the most celebrated practitioners among them being Christian  converts.  The people themselves say, that these practices are peculiar  to their race, and not learnt from the Hindu invaders of their plateau;  but I am inclined to think that some, at least, of the operations have a  strong savour of the Tantric black magic about them, though practiced by  people who are often entirely ignorant of any Hindu language.    These remarks must he supplemented by a short sketch of Kol ideas of  worship.  They have nothing that I have either seen or heard of in the  shape of an image, but their periodical offerings are made to a number  of elemental spirits, and they assign a genie to every rock or tree in  the country, whom they do not consider altogether malignant, but who, if  not duly \"fed\" or propitiated, may become so.    The Singbonga (lit., sun or light spirit) is the chief;  Buru Bonga  (spirit of the hills), and the Ikhir Bonga (spirit of the deep), come  next.  After these come the Darha, of which each family has its own, and  they may be considered in the same light as Lares and Penates.  But  every threshing, flour and oil mill, has its spirit, who must be duly  fed, else evil result may be expected.  Their great festival (the Karam)  is in honour of Singbonga and his assistants;  the opening words of the  priests' speech on that occasion, sufficiently indicate that they  consider Singbonga, the creator of men and things.  Munure Singbonga  manokoa luekidkoa (In the beginning Singbonga made men).    Each village has its Sarna or sacred grove, where the hereditary priest  from time to time performs sacrifices, to keep things prosperous;  but  this only relates to spirits actually connected with the village, the  three greater spirits mentioned, being considered general, are only fed  at intervals of three or more years, and always on a public road or  other public place, and once every ten years a human being was (and as  some will tell you is sacrificed to keep the whole community of spirits  in good train.)  The Pahans, or village priests, are regular servants of  the spirits, and the najo, deona and bhagats are people who in some way  are supposed to obtain an influence or command over them.  The first and  lowest grade of these adepts, called najos (which may be translated as  practitioners of witchcraft pure and simple), are frequently women.  They are accused, like the \"Mula Curumbers,\" of demanding quantities of  grain or loans of money, &c., from people, and when these demands are  refused, they go away with a remark to the effect, \"that you have lots  of cattle and grain just now, but we'll see what they are like after a  month or two.\"  Then probably the cattle of the bewitched person will  get some disease, and several of them die, or some person of his family  will become ill or get hurt in some unaccountable way. Till at last,  thoroughly frightened, the afflicted person takes a little uncooked rice  and goes to a deona or mati (as he is called in the different  vernaculars of the province)--the grade immediately above najo in  knowledge--and promising him a reward if he will assist him, requests  his aid;  if the deona accedes to the request, the proceedings are as  follows.  The deona taking the oil brought, lights a small lamp and  seats himself beside it with the rice in a surpa (winnower) in his  hands.  After looking intently at the lamp flame for a few minutes, he  begins to sing a sort of chant of invocation in which all the spirits  are named, and at the name of each spirit a few grains of rice are  thrown into the lamp.  When the flame at any particular name gives a  jump and flares up high, the spirit concerned in the mischief is  indicated.  Then the deona takes a small portion of the rice wrapped up  in a sal (Shorea robusta) leaf and proceeds to the nearest new white-ant  nest from which he cuts the top off and lays the little bundle, half in  and half out of the cavity. Having retired, he returns in about an hour  to see if the rice is consumed, and according to the rapidity with which  it is eaten he predicts the sacrifice which will appease the spirit.  This ranges from a fowl to a buffalo, but whatever it may include, the  pouring out of blood is an essential.  It must be noted, however, that  the mati never tells who the najo is who has excited the malignity of  the spirit.    But the most important and lucrative part of a deona's business is the  casting out of evil spirits, which operation is known variously as ashab  and langhan.  The sign of obsession is generally some mental alienation  accompanied (in bad cases) by a combined trembling and restlessness of  limbs, or an unaccountable swelling up of the body.  Whatever the  symptoms may be the mode of cure appears to be much the same.  On such  symptoms declaring themselves, the deona is brought to the house and is  in the presence of the sick man and his friends provided with some rice  in a surpa, some oil, a little vermilion, and the deona produces from  his own person a little powdered sulphur and an iron tube about four  inches long and two tikli.*  Before the proceedings begin all the things  mentioned are touched with vermilion, a small quantity of which is also  mixed with the rice.  Three or four grains of rice and one of the tikli  being put into the tube, a lamp is then lighted beside the sick man and  the deona begins his chant, throwing grains of rice at each name, and  when the flame flares up, a little of the powdered sulphur is thrown  into the lamp and a little on the sick man, who thereupon becomes  convulsed, is shaken all over and talks deliriously, the deona's chant  growing louder all the while.  Suddenly the convulsions and the chant  cease, and the deona carefully takes up a little of the sulphur off the  man's body and puts into the tube, which he then seals with the second  tikli.  The deona and one of the man's friends then leave the hut,  taking the iron tube and rice with them, the spirit being now supposed  out of the man and bottled up in the iron tube.  They hurry across  country until they leave the hut some miles behind.  Then they go to the  edge of some tank or river, to some place they know to be frequented by  people for the purposes of bathing, &c., where, after some further  ceremony, the iron is stuck into the ground and left there.  This is  done with the benevolent intention that the spirit may transfer its  attentions to the unfortunate person who may happen to touch it while  bathing.  I am told the spirit in this case usually chooses a young and  healthy person.  Should the deona think the spirit has not been able to  suit itself with a new receptacle, he repairs to where a bazaar is  taking place and there (after some ceremony) he mixes with the crowd,  and taking a grain of the reddened rice jerks it with his forefinger and  thumb in such a way that without attracting attention it falls on the  person or clothes of some.  This is done several times to make certain.  Then the deona declares he has done his work, and is usually treated to  the best dinner the sick man's friends can afford.  It is said that the  person to whom the spirit by either of these methods is transferred may  not be affected for weeks or even months.  But some fine day while he is  at his work, he will suddenly stop, wheel round two or three times on  his heels and fall down more or less convulsed, from that time forward  he will begin to be troubled in the same way as his dis-obsessed  predecessor was.    --------  * Tikli is a circular piece of gilt paper which is stuck on between the  eyebrows of the women of the Province as ornament.  --------    Having thus given some account of the deona, we now come to the bhagat,  called by the Hindus sokha and sivnath.  This is the highest grade of  all, and, as I ought to have mentioned before, the 'ilm (knowledge) of  both the deona and bhagat grades is only to be learned by becoming a  regular chela of a practitioner;  but I am given to understand that the  final initiation is much hastened by a seasonable liberality on the part  of the chela. During the initiation of the sokha certain ceremonies are  performed at night by aid of a human corpse, this is one of the things  which has led me to think that this part at least of these practices is  connected with Tantric black magic.    The bhagat performs two distinct functions:  (1st), a kind of divination  called bhao (the same in Hindi), and (2nd), a kind of Shamanism called  darasta in Hindi, and bharotan in Horokaji, which, however, is resorted  to only on very grave occasions--as, for instance, when several families  think they are bewitched at one time and by the same najo.    The bhao is performed as follows:--The person having some query to  propound, makes a small dish out of a sal leaf and puts in it a little  uncooked rice and a "]]]
