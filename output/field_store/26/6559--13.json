Of that he had no conception;  but he was sure that everything that was good came from God.  His good  act in refraining from slaying the poor, defenseless old Gomangani;  Teeka's love that had hurled her into the embrace of death; his own  loyalty to Teeka which had jeopardized his life that she might live.  The flowers and the trees were good and beautiful.  God had made them.  He made the other creatures, too, that each might have food upon which  to live.  He had made Sheeta, the panther, with his beautiful coat; and  Numa, the lion, with his noble head and his shaggy mane.  He had made  Bara, the deer, lovely and graceful.    Yes, Tarzan had found God, and he spent the whole day in attributing to  Him all of the good and beautiful things of nature; but there was one  thing which troubled him.  He could not quite reconcile it to his  conception of his new-found God.    Who made Histah, the snake?                                     5                   Tarzan and the Black Boy    TARZAN OF THE Apes sat at the foot of a great tree braiding a new grass  rope.  Beside him lay the frayed remnants of the old one, torn and  severed by the fangs and talons of Sheeta, the panther.  Only half the  original rope was there, the balance having been carried off by the  angry cat as he bounded away through the jungle with the noose still  about his savage neck and the loose end dragging among the underbrush.    Tarzan smiled as he recalled Sheeta's great rage, his frantic efforts  to free himself from the entangling strands, his uncanny screams that  were part hate, part anger, part terror.  He smiled in retrospection at  the discomfiture of his enemy, and in anticipation of another day as he  added an extra strand to his new rope.    This would be the strongest, the heaviest rope that Tarzan of the Apes  ever had fashioned.  Visions of Numa, the lion, straining futilely in  its embrace thrilled the ape-man. He was quite content, for his hands  and his brain were busy.  Content, too, were his fellows of the tribe  of Kerchak, searching for food in the clearing and the surrounding  trees about him.  No perplexing thoughts of the future burdened their  minds, and only occasionally, dimly arose recollections of the near  past.  They were stimulated to a species of brutal content by the  delectable business of filling their bellies.  Afterward they would  sleep--it was their life, and they enjoyed it as we enjoy ours, you and  I--as Tarzan enjoyed his.  Possibly they enjoyed theirs more than we  enjoy ours, for who shall say that the beasts of the jungle do not  better fulfill the purposes for which they are created than does man  with his many excursions into strange fields and his contraventions of  the laws of nature? And what gives greater content and greater  happiness than the fulfilling of a destiny?    As Tarzan worked, Gazan, Teeka's little balu, played about him while  Teeka sought food upon the opposite side of the clearing.  No more did  Teeka, the mother, or Taug, the sullen sire, harbor suspicions of  Tarzan's intentions toward their first-born. Had he not courted death  to save their Gazan from the fangs and talons of Sheeta? Did he not  fondle and cuddle the little one with even as great a show of affection  as Teeka herself displayed? Their fears were allayed and Tarzan now  found himself often in the role of nursemaid to a tiny anthropoid--an  avocation which he found by no means irksome, since Gazan was a  never-failing fount of surprises and entertainment.    Just now the apeling was developing those arboreal tendencies which  were to stand him in such good stead during the years of his youth,  when rapid flight into the upper terraces was of far more importance  and value than his undeveloped muscles and untried fighting fangs.  Backing off fifteen or twenty feet from the bole of the tree beneath  the branches of which Tarzan worked upon his rope, Gazan scampered  quickly forward, scrambling nimbly upward to the lower limbs.  Here he  would squat for a moment or two, quite proud of his achievement, then  clamber to the ground again and repeat.  Sometimes, quite often in  fact, for he was an ape, his attention was distracted by other things,  a beetle, a caterpillar, a tiny field mouse, and off he would go in  pursuit; the caterpillars he always caught, and sometimes the beetles;  but the field mice, never.    Now he discovered the tail of the rope upon which Tarzan was working.  Grasping it in one small hand he bounced away, for all the world like  an animated rubber ball, snatching it from the ape-man's hand and  running off across the clearing.  Tarzan leaped to his feet and was in  pursuit in an instant, no trace of anger on his face or in his voice as  he called to the roguish little balu to drop his rope.    Straight toward his mother raced Gazan, and after him came Tarzan.  Teeka looked up from her feeding, and in the first instant that she  realized that Gazan was fleeing and that another was in pursuit, she  bared her fangs and bristled; but when she saw that the pursuer was  Tarzan she turned back to the business that had been occupying her  attention.  At her very feet the ape-man overhauled the balu and,  though the youngster squealed and fought when Tarzan seized him, Teeka  only glanced casually in their direction.  No longer did she fear harm  to her first-born at the hands of the ape-man. Had he not saved Gazan  on two occasions?    Rescuing his rope, Tarzan returned to his tree and resumed his labor;  but thereafter it was necessary to watch carefully the playful balu,  who was now possessed to steal it whenever he thought his great,  smooth-skinned cousin was momentarily off his guard.    But even under this handicap Tarzan finally completed the rope, a long,  pliant weapon, stronger than any he ever had made before.  The  discarded piece of his former one he gave to Gazan for a plaything, for  Tarzan had it in his mind to instruct Teeka's balu after ideas of his  own when the youngster should be old and strong enough to profit by his  precepts.  At present the little ape's innate aptitude for mimicry  would be sufficient to familiarize him with Tarzan's ways and weapons,  and so the ape-man swung off into the jungle, his new rope coiled over  one shoulder, while little Gazan hopped about the clearing dragging the  old one after him in childish glee.    As Tarzan traveled, dividing his quest for food with one for a  sufficiently noble quarry whereupon to test his new weapon, his mind  often was upon Gazan.  The ape-man had realized a deep affection for  Teeka's balu almost from the first, partly because the child belonged  to Teeka, his first love, and partly for the little ape's own sake, and  Tarzan's human longing for some sentient creature upon which to expend  those natural affections of the soul which are inherent to all normal  members of the GENUS HOMO. Tarzan envied Teeka.  It was true that Gazan  evidenced a considerable reciprocation of Tarzan's fondness for him,  even preferring him to his own surly sire; but to Teeka the little one  turned when in pain or terror, when tired or hungry.  Then it was that  Tarzan felt quite alone in the world and longed desperately for one who  should turn first to him for succor and protection.    Taug had Teeka; Teeka had Gazan; and nearly every other bull and cow of  the tribe of Kerchak had one or more to love and by whom to be loved.  Of course Tarzan could scarcely formulate the thought in precisely this  way--he only knew that he craved something which was denied him;  something which seemed to be represented by those relations which  existed between Teeka and her balu, and so he envied Teeka and longed  for a balu of his own.    He saw Sheeta and his mate with their little family of three; and  deeper inland toward the rocky hills, where one might lie up during the  heat of the day, in the dense shade of a tangled thicket close under  the cool face of an overhanging rock, Tarzan had found the lair of  Numa, the lion, and of Sabor, the lioness.  Here he had watched them  with their little balus--playful creatures, spotted leopard-like. And  he had seen the young fawn with Bara, the deer, and with Buto, the  rhinoceros, its ungainly little one.  Each of the creatures of the  jungle had its own--except Tarzan.  It made the ape-man sad to think  upon this thing, sad and lonely; but presently the scent of game  cleared his young mind of all other considerations, as catlike he  crawled far out upon a bending limb above the game trail which led down  to the ancient watering place of the wild things of this wild world.    How many thousands of times had this great, old limb bent to the savage  form of some blood-thirsty hunter in the long years that it had spread  its leafy branches above the deep-worn jungle path! Tarzan, the  ape-man, Sheeta, the panther, and Histah, the snake, it knew well.  They had worn smooth the bark upon its upper surface.    Today it was Horta, the boar, which came down toward the watcher in the  old tree--Horta, the boar, whose formidable tusks and diabolical temper  preserved him from all but the most ferocious or most famished of the  largest carnivora.    But to Tarzan, meat was meat; naught that was edible or tasty might  pass a hungry Tarzan unchallenged and unattacked.  In hunger, as in  battle, the ape-man out-savaged the dreariest denizens of the jungle.  He knew neither fear nor mercy, except upon rare occasions when some  strange, inexplicable force stayed his hand--a force inexplicable to  him, perhaps, because of his ignorance of his own origin and of all the  forces of humanitarianism and civilization that were his rightful  heritage because of that origin.    So today, instead of staying his hand until a less formidable feast  found its way toward him, Tarzan dropped his new noose about the neck  of Horta, the boar.  It was an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10601"],[0,"The Rangeland Avenger (#14)"],[1,"uddered. He came back and studied the sleeper.  Something about the nonchalance with which Sinclair had gone to sleep  under the very eye of his prisoner affected John Gaspar strangely.  Doubtless it was sheer contempt for the man he was guarding. And,  indeed, something assured Jig that, no matter how well he employed the  next eight hours in putting a great distance between himself and Sour  Creek, the tireless riding of Sinclair would more than make up the  distance.    Gaspar went to the door, then turned sharply and glanced over his  shoulder at the sleeper; but the eyes of Sinclair were still closed,  and his regular breathing continued. Jig turned the knob cautiously and  slipped out into the living room.    Jerry and Sally beckoned instantly to him from the far side of the  room. The beauty of the family had descended upon Sally alone. Jerry  was a swart-skinned, squat, bow-legged, efficient cowpuncher. He now  ambled awkwardly to meet John Gaspar.    \"Are you all set?\" he asked.    \"For what?\"    \"To start on the trail!\" exclaimed Jerry. \"What else? Ain't Sinclair  asleep?\"    \"How d'you know?\"    \"I listened at the door and heard his breathing a long time ago.  Thought you'd never come out.\"    Sally Bent was already on the other side of Gaspar, drawing him toward  the door.    \"You can have my hoss, Jig,\" she offered. \"Meg is sure as sin in the  mountains. You won't have nothing to fear on the worst trail they is.\"    \"Not a thing,\" asserted Jerry.    They half led and half dragged Cold Feet to the door.    \"I'll show you the best way. You see them two peaks yonder, like a pair  of mule's ears? You start--\"    \"I don't know,\" said Jig. \"It seems very difficult, even to think of  riding alone through those mountains.\"    Sally was white with fear. \"You ain't going to throw away this chance,  Jig? It'll mean hanging sure, if you don't run now. Ask Jerry what  they're saying in Sour Creek tonight?\"    Jerry volunteered the information. \"They're all wondering why you  wasn't strung up today, when they got so much evidence agin' you. Also  they're thinking that the boys played plumb foolish in turning you over  to this stranger, Sinclair, to guard. But they're waiting for Sheriff  Kern to come over from Woodville an' nab you in the morning. They's  some that says that they won't wait, if it looks like the law is going  to take too long to hang you. They'll get up a necktie party and break  the jail and do their own hanging. I heard all them things and more,  Jig.\"    John Gaspar looked uncertainly from one to the other of his friends.    \"You've _got_ to go!\" cried Sally.    \"I've got to go,\" admitted Cold Feet in a whisper.    \"I've got Meg saddled for you already. She's plumb gentle.\"    \"Just a minute. I've forgotten something.\"    \"You don't mean you're going back into that room where Sinclair is?\"    \"I won't waken him. He's sleeping like the dead.\"    Jig turned away from them and hurried back to his room. Having opened  and closed the door softly, he went to a chest of drawers near the  window and fumbled in the half-light of the low-burning lamp. He  slipped a small leather case into the breast pocket of his coat, and  then stole back toward the door, as softly as before. With his hand on  the knob, he paused and looked back. For all he knew, Sinclair might be  really awake now, watching his quarry from beneath those heavy lashes,  waiting until his prisoner should have made a definite attempt to  escape.    And then the big man would rise to his feet as soon as the door was  closed. The picture became startlingly real to John Gaspar. Sinclair  would slip out that window, no doubt, and circle around toward the  horse shed. There he would wait until his prisoner came out on Meg, and  then without warning would come a shot, and there would be an end of  Sinclair's trouble with his prisoner. Gaspar could easily attribute  such cunning cruelty to Sinclair. And yet there was something untested,  unprobed, different about the rangy fellow.    Whatever it was, it kept Gaspar staring down into the lean face of  Sinclair for a long moment. Then he went resolutely back into the  living room and faced Sally Bent; Jerry was already waiting outdoors.    \"I'm not going,\" said Gaspar slowly. \"I'll stay.\"    Sally cried out. \"Oh, Jig, have you lost your nerve ag'in? Ain't you  got _no_ courage?\"    The schoolteacher sighed. \"I'm afraid not, Sally. I guess my only  courage comes in waiting and seeing how things turn out.\"    He turned and went gloomily back to his room.          12      With the first brightness of dawn, Sinclair wakened even more suddenly  that he had fallen asleep. There was no slow adjusting of himself to  the requirements of the day. One prodigious stretching of the long  arms, one great yawn, and he was as wide awake as he would be at noon.  He jerked on his boots and rose, and not until he stood up, did he see  John Gaspar asleep in the big chair, his head inclining to one side,  the book half-fallen from his hand, and the lamp sputtering its last  beside him. But instead of viewing the weary face with pity, Sinclair  burst into sudden and amazed profanity.    The first jarring note brought Gaspar up and awake with a start, and he  stared in astonishment at the uninterrupted flood which rippled from  the lips of the cowpuncher. It concluded: \"Still here! Of all the  shorthorned fatheads that I ever seen, the worst is this Gaspar--this  Jig--this Cold Feet. Say, man, ain't you got no spirit at all?\"    \"What do you mean?\" asked Gaspar. \"Still here? Of course I'm still  here! Did you expect me to escape?\"    Sinclair flung himself into a chair, speechless with rage and disgust.    \"Did you think I was joking when I told you I was going to sleep eight  hours without waking up?\"    \"It might very well have been a trap, you know.\"    Sinclair groaned. \"Son, they ain't any man in the world that'll tell  you that Riley Sinclair sets his traps for birds that ain't got their  stiff feathers growed yet. Trap for you? What in thunder should I want  you for, eh?\"    He strode to the window, still groaning.    \"There's where you'd ought to be, over yonder behind them mule ears.  They'd never catch you in a thousand years with that start. Eight hours  start! As good as have eight years, kid--just as good. And you've  throwed that chance away!\"    He turned and stared mournfully at the schoolteacher.    \"It ain't no use,\" he said sadly. \"I see it all now. You was cut out to  end in a rope collar.\"    Not another word could be pried from his set lips during breakfast, a  gloomy meal to which Sally Bent came with red eyes, and Jerry Bent  sullenly, with black looks at Sinclair. Jig was the cheeriest one of  the party. That cheer at last brought another explosion from Sinclair.  They stood in front of the house, watching a horseman wind his way up  the road through the hills.    \"It's Sheriff Kern,\" said Jerry Bent. \"I can tell by the way he rides,  sort of slanting. It's Kern, right enough.\"    Sally Bent choked, but Jig continued to hum softly.    \"Singin'?\" asked Riley Sinclair suddenly. \"Ain't you no more worried  than that?\"    The voice of the schoolteacher in reply was as smooth as running water.  \"I think you'll bring me out of the trouble safely enough, Mr.  Sinclair.\"    \"Mr. Sinclair'll see you damned before he lifts a hand for you!\" Riley  retorted savagely.    He strode to his horse and expended his wrath by viciously jerking at  the cinches, until the mustang groaned. Sheriff Kern came suddenly into  clear view around the last turn and rode quickly up to them, a very  short man, muscular, sweaty. He always gave the impression that he had  been working ceaselessly for a week, and certainly he found time to  shave only once in ten days. Dense bristle clouded the lower features  of his face. He was a taciturn man. His greetings took the form of a  single grunt. He took possession of John Gaspar with a single glance  that sent the latter nervously toward his saddle horse.    \"I see you got this party all ready for me,\" said the sheriff more  amiably to Riley Sinclair, who was watching in disgust the clumsy  method of Jig's mounting. \"You're Sinclair, I guess?\"    \"I'm Sinclair, sheriff.\"    They shook hands.    \"Nice bit of work you done for me, Sinclair, keeping the boys from  stringing up Jig, yonder. These here lynchings don't set none too well  on the reputation of a sheriff. I guess we're ready to start. S'long  Sally--Jerry. Are you riding our way, Sinclair?\"    \"I thought I'd happen along. Ain't never seen Woodville yet.\"    \"Glad to have you. But they ain't much to see unless you look twice at  the same thing.\"    They started down the trail three abreast.    \"Ride on ahead,\" commanded Sinclair to Jig. \"We don't want you riding  in the same line with men. Git on ahead!\"    John Gaspar obeyed that brutal order with bowed head. He rode  listlessly, with loose rein, letting the pony pick its own way. Once  Sinclair looked back to Sally Bent, weeping in the arms of her brother.  Again his face grew black.    \"And yet,\" confided the sheriff softly, \"I ain't never heard no trouble  about this Gaspar before.\"    \"He's poison,\" declared Sinclair bitterly, and he raised his voice that  it would unmistakably carry to the shrinking figure before them. \"He's  such a yaller-hearted skunk, sheriff, that it makes me ashamed of bein'  a man!\"    \"They's only one thing I misdoubt,\" said the sheriff. \"How'd that sort  of a gent ever get the nerve to murder a man like Quade? Quade wasn't  no tenderfoot, and he could shoot a bit, besides.\"    \"Speaking personal, sheriff, I don't think he done it, now I've had a  chance to go over the evidence.\"    \"Maybe he didn't, but most like he'll hang for it. The boys is dead set  agin' him. First, he's a dude; second, he's a coward. Sour Creek and  Woodville wasn't never cut out for that sort. They ain't wanted  around.\"    That speech made Riley Sinclair profoundly"]]]
