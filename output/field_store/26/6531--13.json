W. decided  he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9845"],[0,"The Spy (#13)"],[1,"of his person it was secreted.    This very material point in his business so satisfactorily completed,  the peddler rose from his seat on the floor of the piazza, and  approached to where Captain Wharton stood, supporting his sisters on  either arm, as they listened with the lively interest of affection to  his conversation.    The agitation of the preceding incidents had caused such an expenditure  of the juices which had become necessary to the mouth of the peddler,  that a new supply of the weed was required before he could turn his  attention to business of lesser moment. This done, he asked abruptly,--    \"Captain Wharton, do you go in to-night?\"    \"No!\" said the captain, laconically, and looking at his lovely burdens  with great affection. \"Mr. Birch, would you have me leave such company  so soon, when I may never enjoy it again?\"    \"Brother!\" said Frances, \"jesting on such a subject is cruel.\"    \"I rather guess,\" continued the peddler, coolly, \"now the storm is over,  the Skinners may be moving; you had better shorten your visit,  Captain Wharton.\"    \"Oh!\" cried the British officer, \"a few guineas will buy off those  rascals at any time, should I meet them. No, no, Mr. Birch, here I stay  until morning.\"    \"Money could not liberate Major Andre,\" said the peddler, dryly.    Both the sisters now turned to the captain in alarm, and the elder  observed,--    \"You had better take the advice of Harvey; rest assured, his opinion in  such matters ought not to be disregarded.\"    \"Yes,\" added the younger, \"if, as I suspect, Mr. Birch assisted you to  come here, your safety, our happiness, dear Henry, requires you to  listen to him now.\"    \"I brought myself out, and can take myself in,\" said the captain  positively. \"Our bargain went no further than to procure my disguise,  and to let me know when the coast was clear; and in the latter  particular, you were mistaken, Mr. Birch.\"    \"I was,\" said the peddler, with some interest, \"and the greater is the  reason why you should get back to-night; the pass I gave you will serve  but once.\"    \"Cannot you forge another?\"    The pale cheek of the trader showed an unusual color, but he continued  silent, with his eyes fixed on the ground, until the young man added,  with great positiveness, \"Here I stay this night, come what will.\"    \"Captain Wharton,\" said the peddler, with great deliberation and marked  emphasis, \"beware a tall Virginian, with huge whiskers; he is below you,  to my knowledge; the devil can't deceive him; I never could but once.\"    \"Let him beware of me,\" said Wharton, haughtily. \"But, Mr. Birch, I  exonerate you from further responsibility.\"    \"Will you give me that in writing?\" asked the cautious Birch.    \"Oh! cheerfully,\" cried the captain, with a laugh. \"Caesar! pen, ink,  and paper, while I write a discharge for my trusty attendant, Harvey  Birch, peddler, etc., etc.\"    The implements for writing were produced, and the captain, with great  gayety, wrote the desired acknowledgment in language of his own; which  the peddler took, and carefully depositing it by the side of the image  of his Catholic Majesty, made a sweeping bow to the whole family, and  departed as he had approached. He was soon seen at a distance, stealing  into the door of his own humble dwelling.    The father and sisters of the captain were too much rejoiced in  retaining the young man to express, or even entertain, the apprehensions  his situation might reasonably excite; but on retiring to their evening  repast, a cooler reflection induced the captain to think of changing his  mind. Unwilling to trust himself out of the protection of his father's  domains, the young man dispatched Caesar to desire another interview  with Harvey. The black soon returned with the unwelcome intelligence  that it was now too late. Katy had told him that Harvey must be miles on  his road to the northward, \"having left home at early candlelight with  his pack.\" Nothing now remained to the captain but patience, until the  morning should afford further opportunity of deciding on the best course  for him to pursue.    \"This Harvey Birch, with his knowing looks and portentous warnings,  gives me more uneasiness than I am willing to own,\" said Captain  Wharton, rousing himself from a fit of musing in which the danger of his  situation made no small part of his meditations.    \"How is it that he is able to travel to and fro in these difficult  times, without molestation?\" inquired Miss Peyton.    \"Why the rebels suffer him to escape so easily, is more than I can  answer,\" returned the other; \"but Sir Henry would not permit a hair of  his head to be injured.\"    \"Indeed!\" cried Frances, with interest. \"Is he then known to Sir Henry  Clinton?\"    \"At least he ought to be.\"    \"Do you think, my son,\" asked Mr. Wharton, \"there is no danger of his  betraying you?\"    \"Why--no; I reflected on that before I trusted myself to his power,\"  said the captain, thoughtfully. \"He seems to be faithful in matters of  business. The danger to himself, should he return to the city, would  prevent such an act of villainy.\"    \"I think,\" said Frances, adopting the manner of her brother, \"Harvey  Birch is not without good feelings; at least, he has the appearance of  them at times.\"    \"Oh!\" cried his sister, exulting, \"he has loyalty, and that with me is a  cardinal virtue.\"    \"I am afraid,\" said her brother, laughing, \"love of money is a stronger  passion than love of his king.\"    \"Then,\" said the father, \"you cannot be safe while in his power--for no  love will withstand the temptations of money, when offered to avarice.\"    \"Surely, sir,\" cried the youth, recovering his gayety, \"there must be  one love that can resist anything--is there not, Fanny?\"    \"Here is your candle; you keep your father up beyond his usual hour.\"          CHAPTER V           Through Solway sands, through Taross moss,       Blindfold, he knew the paths to cross:       By wily turns, by desperate bounds,       Had baffled Percy's best bloodhounds.       In Eske, or Liddel, fords were none,       But he would ride them, one by one;       Alike to him was time or tide,       December's snow or July's pride;       Alike to him was tide or time,       Moonless midnight or matin prime.                                      --WALTER SCOTT.    All the members of the Wharton family laid their heads on their pillows  that night, with a foreboding of some interruption to their ordinary  quiet. Uneasiness kept the sisters from enjoying their usual repose, and  they rose from their beds, on the following morning, unrefreshed, and  almost without having closed their eyes.    On taking an eager and hasty survey of the valley from the windows of  their room, nothing, however, but its usual serenity was to be seen. It  was glittering with the opening brilliancy of one of those lovely, mild  days, which occur about the time of the falling of the leaf; and which,  by their frequency, class the American autumn with the most delightful  seasons of other countries. We have no spring; vegetation seems to leap  into existence, instead of creeping, as in the same latitudes of the Old  World; but how gracefully it retires! September, October, even November  and December, compose the season for enjoyment in the open air; they  have their storms, but they are distinct, and not of long continuance,  leaving a clear atmosphere and a cloudless sky.    As nothing could be seen likely to interrupt the enjoyments and harmony  of such a day, the sisters descended to the parlor, with a returning  confidence in their brother's security, and their own happiness.    The family were early in assembling around the breakfast table; and  Miss Peyton, with a little of that minute precision which creeps into  the habits of single life, had pleasantly insisted that the absence of  her nephew should in no manner interfere with the regular hours she had  established; consequently, the party were already seated when the  captain made his appearance; though the untasted coffee sufficiently  proved that by none of his relatives was his absence disregarded.    \"I think I did much better,\" he cried, taking a chair between his  sisters, and receiving their offered salutes, \"to secure a good bed and  such a plentiful breakfast, instead of trusting to the hospitality of  that renowned corps, the Cowboys.\"    \"If you could sleep,\" said Sarah, \"you were more fortunate than Frances  and myself; every murmur of the night air sounded to me like the  approach of the rebel army.\"    \"Why,\" said the captain, laughing, \"I do acknowledge a little inquietude  myself--but how was it with you?\" turning to his younger and evidently  favorite sister, and tapping her cheek. \"Did you see banners in the  clouds, and mistake Miss Peyton's Aeolian harp for rebellious music?\"    \"Nay, Henry,\" rejoined the maid, looking at him affectionately, \"much as  I love my own country, the approach of her troops just now would give me  great pain.\"    The brother made no reply; but returning the fondness expressed in her  eye by a look of fraternal tenderness, he gently pressed her hand in  silence; when Caesar, who had participated largely in the anxiety of the  family, and who had risen with the dawn, and kept a vigilant watch on  the surrounding objects, as he stood gazing from one of the windows,  exclaimed with a face that approached to something like the hues of a  white man,--    \"Run--Massa Harry--run--if he love old Caesar, run--here come a rebel  horse.\"    \"Run!\" repeated the British officer, gathering himself up in military  pride. \"No, Mr. Caesar, running is not my trade.\" While speaking, he  walked deliberately to the window, where the family were already  collected in the greatest consternation.    At the distance of more than a mile, about fifty dragoons were to be  seen, winding down one of the lateral entrances of the valley. In  advance, with an officer, was a man attired in the dress of a  countryman, "]]]
