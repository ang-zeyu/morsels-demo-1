The latter, however,  was not to be moved. He had been displeased with Mr. Fox in the earlier  part of the voyage, considering him indolent and inactive; and probably  thought his present repugnance arose from a want of true nautical  spirit. The interference of the partners in the business of the ship,  also, was not calculated to have a favorable effect on a stickler  for authority like himself, especially in his actual state of feeling  towards them.    At one o'clock, P.M., therefore, Fox and his comrades set off in  the whaleboat, which is represented as small in size, and crazy in  condition. All eyes were strained after the little bark as it pulled for  shore, rising and sinking with the huge rolling waves, until it entered,  a mere speck, among the foaming breakers, and was soon lost to view.  Evening set in, night succeeded and passed away, and morning returned,  but without the return of the boat.    As the wind had moderated, the ship stood near to the land, so as to  command a view of the river's mouth. Nothing was to be seen but a wild  chaos of tumbling waves breaking upon the bar, and apparently forming a  foaming barrier from shore to shore. Towards night the ship again stood  out to gain sea-room, and a gloom was visible in every countenance. The  captain himself shared in the general anxiety, and probably repented  of his peremptory orders. Another weary and watchful night succeeded,  during which the wind subsided, and the weather became serene.    On the following day, the ship having drifted near the land, anchored  in fourteen fathoms water, to the northward of the long peninsula or  promontory which forms the north side of the entrance, and is called  Cape Disappointment. The pinnace was then manned, and two of the  partners, Mr. David Stuart and Mr. M'Kay, set off in the hope of  learning something of the fate of the whaleboat. The surf, however,  broke with such violence along the shore that they could find no landing  place. Several of the natives appeared on the beach and made signs to  them to row round the cape, but they thought it most prudent to return  to the ship.    The wind now springing up, the Tonquin got under way, and stood in to  seek the channel; but was again deterred by the frightful aspect of  the breakers, from venturing within a league. Here she hove to; and  Mr. Mumford, the second mate, was despatched with four hands, in the  pinnace, to sound across the channel until he should find four fathoms  depth. The pinnace entered among the breakers, but was near being lost,  and with difficulty got back to the ship. The captain insisted that  Mr. Mumford had steered too much to the southward. He now turned to Mr.  Aiken, an able mariner, destined to command the schooner intended  for the coasting trade, and ordered him, together with John Coles,  sail-maker, Stephen Weekes, armorer, and two Sandwich Islanders, to  proceed ahead and take soundings, while the ship should follow under  easy sail. In this way they proceeded until Aiken had ascertained the  channel, when signal was given from the ship for him to return on board.  He was then within pistol shot, but so furious was the current, and  tumultuous the breakers, that the boat became unmanageable, and was  hurried away, the crew crying out piteously for assistance. In a  few moments she could not be seen from the ship's deck. Some of the  passengers climbed to the mizzen top, and beheld her still struggling to  reach the ship; but shortly after she broached broadside to the waves,  and her case seemed desperate. The attention of those on board of the  ship was now called to their own safety. They were in shallow water; the  vessel struck repeatedly, the waves broke over her, and there was danger  of her foundering. At length she got into seven fathoms water, and the  wind lulling, and the night coming on, cast anchor. With the darkness  their anxieties increased. The wind whistled, the sea roared, the gloom  was only broken by the ghastly glare of the foaming breakers, the  minds of the seamen were full of dreary apprehensions, and some of them  fancied they heard the cries of their lost comrades mingling with  the uproar of the elements. For a time, too, the rapidly ebbing tide  threatened to sweep them from their precarious anchorage. At length the  reflux of the tide, and the springing up of the wind, enabled them to  quit their dangerous situation and take shelter in a small bay within  Cape Disappointment, where they rode in safety during the residue of a  stormy night, and enjoyed a brief interval of refreshing sleep.    With the light of day returned their cares and anxieties. They looked  out from the mast-head over a wild coast, and wilder sea, but could  discover no trace of the two boats and their crews that were missing.  Several of the natives came on board with peltries, but there was no  disposition to trade. They were interrogated by signs after the lost  boats, but could not understand the inquiries.    Parties now Went on shore and scoured the neighborhood. One of these  was headed by the captain. They had not proceeded far when they beheld a  person at a distance in civilized garb. As he drew near he proved to  be Weekes, the armorer. There was a burst of joy, for it was hoped his  comrades were near at hand. His story, however, was one of disaster. He  and his companions had found it impossible to govern their boat, having  no rudder, and being beset by rapid and whirling currents and boisterous  surges. After long struggling they had let her go at the mercy of  the waves, tossing about, sometimes with her bow, sometimes with her  broadside to the surges, threatened each instant with destruction, yet  repeatedly escaping, until a huge sea broke over and swamped her. Weekes  was overwhelmed by the broiling waves, but emerging above the surface,  looked round for his companions. Aiken and Coles were not to be seen;  near him were the two Sandwich Islanders, stripping themselves of their  clothing that they might swim more freely. He did the same, and the boat  floating near to him he seized hold of it. The two islanders joined him,  and, uniting their forces, they succeeded in turning the boat upon her  keel; then bearing down her stern and rocking her, they forced out  so much water that she was able to bear the weight of a man without  sinking. One of the islanders now got in, and in a little while bailed  out the water with his hands. The other swam about and collected the  oars, and they all three got once more on board.    By this time the tide had swept them beyond the breakers, and Weekes  called on his companions to row for land. They were so chilled and  benumbed by the cold, however, that they lost all heart, and absolutely  refused. Weekes was equally chilled, but had superior sagacity and  self-command. He counteracted the tendency to drowsiness and stupor  which cold produces by keeping himself in constant exercise; and  seeing that the vessel was advancing, and that everything depended upon  himself, he set to work to scull the boat clear of the bar, and into  quiet water.    Toward midnight one of the poor islanders expired; his companion threw  himself on his corpse and could not be persuaded to leave him. The  dismal night wore away amidst these horrors: as the day dawned, Weekes  found himself near the land. He steered directly for it, and at length,  with the aid of the surf, ran his boat high upon a sandy beach.    Finding that one of the Sandwich Islanders yet gave signs of life, he  aided him to leave the boat, and set out with him towards the adjacent  woods. The poor fellow, however, was too feeble to follow him, and  Weekes was soon obliged to abandon him to his fate and provide for his  own safety. Falling upon a beaten path, he pursued it, and after a few  hours came to a part of the coast, where, to his surprise and joy, he  beheld the ship at anchor and was met by the captain and his party.    After Weekes had related his adventures, three parties were despatched  to beat up the coast in search of the unfortunate islander. They  returned at night without success, though they had used the utmost  diligence. On the following day the search was resumed, and the poor  fellow was at length discovered lying beneath a group of rocks, his  legs swollen, his feet torn and bloody from walking through bushes and  briars, and himself half-dead with cold, hunger, and fatigue. Weekes and  this islander were the only survivors of the crew of the jolly-boat, and  no trace was ever discovered of Fox and his party. Thus eight men were  lost on the first approach to the coast; a commencement that cast a  gloom over the spirits of the whole party, and was regarded by some of  the superstitious as an omen that boded no good to the enterprise.    Towards night the Sandwich Islanders went on shore, to bury the body of  their unfortunate countryman who had perished in the boat. On arriving  at the place where it had been left, they dug a grave in the sand, in  which they deposited the corpse, with a biscuit under one of the arms,  some lard under the chin, and a small quantity of tobacco, as provisions  for its journey in the land of spirits. Having covered the body with  sand and flints, they kneeled along the grave in a double row, with  their faces turned to the east, while one who officiated as a priest  sprinkled them with water from a hat. In so doing he recited a kind of  prayer or invocation, to which, at intervals, the others made responses.  Such were the simple rites performed by these poor savages at the grave  of their comrade on the shores of a strange land; and when these were  done, they rose and returned in silence to the ship, without once  casting a look behind.

Ivan gazed vacantly at everything; but he  saw not the dark and glancing river--he saw not the bleak plain of  snow--his eyes looked not on the romantic picture of the tent and its  bivouac-fire: his thoughts were on one thing alone. He it was who  had brought them to that pass, and on his head rested all the misery  endured by man and beast, and, worst of all, by the good and devoted  Kolina.    There she sat, too, on the ground, wrapped in her warm clothes, her  eyes, fixed on the crackling logs. Of what was she thinking? Whatever  occupied her mind, it was soon chased away by the sudden speech  of Ivan. \"Kolina,\" said he, in a tone which borrowed a little of  intensity from the state of mind in which hunger had placed all of  them, \"canst thou ever forgive me?\"    \"What?\" replied the young girl softly.    \"My having brought you here to die, far away from your native hills?\"    \"Kolina cares little for herself,\" said the Yakouta maiden, rising and  speaking perhaps a little wildly; \"let her father escape, and she is  willing to lie near the tombs of the old people on the borders of the  icy sea.\"    \"But Ivan had hoped to see for Kolina many bright, happy days; for  Ivan would have made her father rich, and Kolina would have been the  richest unmarried girl in the plain of Mioure!\"    \"And would riches make Kolina happy?\" said she sadly.    \"Young girl of the Yakouta, hearken to me! Let Ivan live or die this  hour; Ivan is a fool. He left home and comfort to cross the icy seas  in search of wealth, and to gain happiness; but if he had only had  eyes, he would have stopped at Mioure. There he saw a girl, lively as  the heaven-fire in the north, good, generous, kind; and she was an old  friend, and might have loved Ivan; but the man of Yakoutsk was blind,  and told her of his passion for a selfish widow, and the Yakouta  maiden never thought of Ivan but as a brother!\"    \"What means Ivan?\" asked Kolina, trembling with emotion.    \"Ivan has long meant, when he came to the yourte of Sakalar, to lay  his wealth at his feet, and beg of his old friend to give him his  child: but Ivan now fears that he may die, and wishes to know what  would have been the answer of Kolina?\"    \"But Maria Vorotinska?\" urged the girl, who seemed dreaming.    \"Has long been forgotten. How could I not love my old playmate and  friend! Kolina--Kolina, listen to Ivan! Forget his love for the widow  of Yakoutsk, and Ivan will stay in the plain of Vchivaya and die.\"    \"Kolina is very proud,\" whispered the girl, sitting down on a log near  the fire, and speaking in a low tone; \"and Kolina thinks yet that the  friend of her father has forgotten himself. But if he be not wild, if  the sufferings of the journey have not made him say that which is not,  Kolina would be very happy.\"    \"Be plain, girl of Mioure--maiden of the Yakouta tribe! and play not  with the heart of a man. Can Kolina take Ivan as her husband?\"    A frank and happy reply gave the Yakoutsk merchant all the  satisfaction he could wish; and then followed several hours of those  sweet and delightful explanations which never end between young lovers  when first they have acknowledged their mutual affection. They had  hitherto concealed so much, that there was much to tell; and Ivan  and Kolina, who for nearly three years had lived together, with a bar  between their deep but concealed affection, seemed to have no end of  words. Ivan had begun to find his feelings change from the very hour  Sakalar's daughter volunteered to accompany him, but it was only in  the cave of New Siberia that his heart had been completely won.    So short, and quiet, and sweet were the hours, that the time of rest  passed by without the thought of sleep. Suddenly, however, they were  roused to a sense of their situation, and leaving their wearied and  exhausted companions still asleep, they moved with doubt and dread to  the water's side. Life was now doubly dear to both, and their fancy  painted the coming forth of an empty net as the termination of all  hope. But the net came heavily and slowly to land. It was full of  fish. They were on the well-stocked Vchivaya. More than three hundred  fish, small and great, were drawn on shore; and then they recast the  net.    \"Up, man and beast!\" thundered Ivan, as, after selecting two dozen of  the finest, he abandoned the rest to the dogs.    The animals, faint and weary, greedily seized on the food given them,  while Sakalar and the Kolimsk men could scarcely believe their senses.  The hot coals were at once brought into requisition, and the party  were soon regaling themselves on a splendid meal of tea and broiled  fish. I should alarm my readers did I record the quantities eaten. An  hour later, every individual was a changed being, but most of all the  lovers. Despite their want of rest, they looked fresher than any of  the party. It was determined to camp at least twenty hours more in  that spot; and the Kolimsk men declared that the river must be the  Vchivaya, they could draw the seine all day, for the river was deep,  its waters warmer than others, and its abundance of fish such as to  border on the fabulous. They went accordingly down to the side of  the stream, and then the happy Kolina gave free vent to her joy.  She burst out into a song of her native land, and gave way to some  demonstrations of delight, the result of her earlier education, that  astonished Sakalar. But when he heard that during that dreadful night  he had found a son, Sakalar himself almost lost his reason. The old  man loved Ivan almost as much as his own child, and when he saw the  youth in his yourte on his hunting trips, had formed some project of  the kind now brought about; but the confessions of Ivan on his last  visit to Mioure had driven all such thoughts away.    \"Art in earnest, Ivan?\" said he, after a pause of some duration.    \"In earnest!\" exclaimed Ivan, laughing; \"why, I fancy the young men of  Mioure will find me so, if they seek to question my right to Kolina!\"    Kolina smiled, and looked happy; and the old hunter heartily blessed  his children, adding that the proudest, dearest hope of his heart was  now within probable realization.    The predictions of the Kolimsk men were realized. The river gave them  as much fish as they needed for their journey home; and as now Sakalar  knew his way, there was little fear for the future. An ample stock was  piled on the sledges, the dogs had unlimited feeding for two days, and  then away they sped toward an upper part of the river, which, being  broad and shallow, was no doubt frozen on the surface. They found it  as they expected, and even discovered that the river was gradually  freezing all the way down. But little caring for this now, on they  went, and after considerable fatigue and some delay, arrived at  Kolimsk, to the utter astonishment of all the inhabitants, who had  long given them up for lost.    Great rejoicings took place. The friends of the three Kolimsk men  gave a grand festival, in which the rum, and tobacco, and tea, which  had been left at the place for payment for their journey, played  a conspicuous part. Then, as it was necessary to remain here some  time, while the ivory was brought from a deposit near the sea,  Ivan and Kolina were married. Neither of them seemed to credit the  circumstance, even when fast tied by the Russian church. It had come  so suddenly, so unexpectedly on both, that their heads could not quite  make the affair out. But they were married in right down earnest, and  Kolina was a proud and happy woman. The enormous mass of ivory brought  to Kolimsk excited the attention of a distinguished exile, who drew  up a statement in Ivan's name, and prepared it for transmission to the  White Czar, as the emperor is called in these parts.    When summer came, the young couple, with Sakalar and a caravan of  merchants, started for Yakoutsk, Ivan being by far the richest and  most important member of the party. After a single day's halt at  Mioure, on they went to the town, and made their triumphal entry in  September. Ivan found Maria Vorotinska a wife and mother, and his  vanity was not much wounded by the falsehood. The _ci-devant_ widow  was a little astonished at Ivan's return, and particularly at his  treasure of ivory: but she received his wife with politeness, a little  tempered by her sense of her own superiority to a savage, as she  designated Kolina to her friends in a whisper. But Kolina was so  gentle, so pretty, so good, so cheerful, so happy, that she found her  party at once, and the two ladies became rival leaders of the fashion.    This lasted until the next year, when a messenger from the capital  brought a letter to Ivan from the emperor himself, thanking him for  his narrative, sending him a rich present, his warm approval, and the  office of first civil magistrate in the city of Yakoutsk. This turned  the scales wholly on one side, and Maria bowed low to Kolina. But  Kolina had no feelings of the parvenu, and she was always a general  favorite. Ivan accepted with pride his sovereign's favor, and by  dint of assiduity, soon learned to be a useful magistrate. He always  remained a good husband, a good father, and a good son, for he made  the heart of old Sakalar glad. He never regretted his journey: he  always declared he owed to it wealth and happiness, a high position in  society, and an admirable wife. Great rejoicings took place many years  after in Yakoutsk, at the marriage of the son of Maria, united to  the daughter of Ivan, and from the first unto the last, none of the  parties concerned ever had reason to mourn over the perilous journey  in search of the Ivory Mine.           *       *       *       *       *    For the information of the non-scientific, it may be necessary to  mention that the ivory alluded to in the preceding tale, is derived  from the tusks of the mammoth, or fossil elephant of"]]]
