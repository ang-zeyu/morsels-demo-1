'You know very well, Joe,' said Mary quietly.    (I knew very well, but the knowledge only maddened me. I had had an idea  of getting a billet in one of the big wool-stores--I was a fair wool  expert--but Mary was afraid of the drink. I could keep well away from it  so long as I worked hard in the Bush. I had gone to Sydney twice since  I met Mary, once before we were married, and she forgave me when I came  back; and once afterwards. I got a billet there then, and was going to  send for her in a month. After eight weeks she raised the money somehow  and came to Sydney and brought me home. I got pretty low down that  time.)    'But, Mary,' I said, 'it would have been different this time. You would  have been with me. I can take a glass now or leave it alone.'    'As long as you take a glass there is danger,' she said.    'Well, what did you want to advise me to come out here for, if you can't  stand it? Why didn't you stay where you were?' I asked.    'Well,' she said, 'why weren't you more decided?'    I'd sat down, but I jumped to my feet then.    'Good God!' I shouted, 'this is more than any man can stand. I'll chuck  it all up! I'm damned well sick and tired of the whole thing.'    'So am I, Joe,' said Mary wearily.    We quarrelled badly then--that first hour in our new home. I know now  whose fault it was.    I got my hat and went out and started to walk down the creek. I didn't  feel bitter against Mary--I had spoken too cruelly to her to feel that  way. Looking back, I could see plainly that if I had taken her advice  all through, instead of now and again, things would have been all right  with me. I had come away and left her crying in the hut, and James  telling her, in a brotherly way, that it was all her fault. The trouble  was that I never liked to 'give in' or go half-way to make it up--not  half-way--it was all the way or nothing with our natures.    'If I don't make a stand now,' I'd say, 'I'll never be master. I gave up  the reins when I got married, and I'll have to get them back again.'    What women some men are! But the time came, and not many years after,  when I stood by the bed where Mary lay, white and still; and, amongst  other things, I kept saying, 'I'll give in, Mary--I'll give in,' and  then I'd laugh. They thought that I was raving mad, and took me from the  room. But that time was to come.    As I walked down the creek track in the moonlight the question rang in  my ears again, as it had done when I first caught sight of the house  that evening--    'Why did I bring her here?'    I was not fit to 'go on the land'. The place was only fit for some  stolid German, or Scotsman, or even Englishman and his wife, who had no  ambition but to bullock and make a farm of the place. I had only drifted  here through carelessness, brooding, and discontent.    I walked on and on till I was more than half-way to the only  neighbours--a wretched selector's family, about four miles down the  creek,--and I thought I'd go on to the house and see if they had any  fresh meat.    A mile or two farther I saw the loom of the bark hut they lived in, on  a patchy clearing in the scrub, and heard the voice of the selector's  wife--I had seen her several times: she was a gaunt, haggard Bushwoman,  and, I supposed, the reason why she hadn't gone mad through hardship  and loneliness was that she hadn't either the brains or the memory to go  farther than she could see through the trunks of the 'apple-trees'.    'You, An-nay!' (Annie.)    'Ye-es' (from somewhere in the gloom).    'Didn't I tell yer to water them geraniums!'    'Well, didn't I?'    'Don't tell lies or I'll break yer young back!'    'I did, I tell yer--the water won't soak inter the ashes.'    Geraniums were the only flowers I saw grow in the drought out there.  I remembered this woman had a few dirty grey-green leaves behind some  sticks against the bark wall near the door; and in spite of the sticks  the fowls used to get in and scratch beds under the geraniums, and  scratch dust over them, and ashes were thrown there--with an idea of  helping the flower, I suppose; and greasy dish-water, when fresh water  was scarce--till you might as well try to water a dish of fat.    Then the woman's voice again--    'You, Tom-may!' (Tommy.)    Silence, save for an echo on the ridge.    'Y-o-u, T-o-m-MAY!'    'Ye-e-s!' shrill shriek from across the creek.    'Didn't I tell you to ride up to them new people and see if they want  any meat or any think?' in one long screech.    'Well--I karnt find the horse.'    'Well-find-it-first-think-in-the-morning and.  And-don't-forgit-to-tell-Mrs-Wi'son-that-mother'll-be-up-as-soon-as-she-can.'      I didn't feel like going to the woman's house that night. I felt--and  the thought came like a whip-stroke on my heart--that this was what Mary  would come to if I left her here.    I turned and started to walk home, fast. I'd made up my mind. I'd take  Mary straight back to Gulgong in the morning--I forgot about the load I  had to take to the sheep station. I'd say, 'Look here, Girlie' (that's  what I used to call her), 'we'll leave this wretched life; we'll leave  the Bush for ever! We'll go to Sydney, and I'll be a man! and work my  way up.' And I'd sell waggon, horses, and all, and go.    When I got to the hut it was lighted up. Mary had the only kerosene  lamp, a slush lamp, and two tallow candles going. She had got both rooms  washed out--to James's disgust, for he had to move the furniture and  boxes about. She had a lot of things unpacked on the table; she had  laid clean newspapers on the mantel-shelf--a slab on two pegs over the  fireplace--and put the little wooden clock in the centre and some of  the ornaments on each side, and was tacking a strip of vandyked American  oil-cloth round the rough edge of the slab.    'How does that look, Joe? We'll soon get things ship-shape.'    I kissed her, but she had her mouth full of tacks. I went out in the  kitchen, drank a pint of cold tea, and sat down.    Somehow I didn't feel satisfied with the way things had gone.          II. 'Past Carin''.      Next morning things looked a lot brighter. Things always look brighter  in the morning--more so in the Australian Bush, I should think, than in  most other places. It is when the sun goes down on the dark bed of the  lonely Bush, and the sunset flashes like a sea of fire and then fades,  and then glows out again, like a bank of coals, and then burns away to  ashes--it is then that old things come home to one. And strange, new-old  things too, that haunt and depress you terribly, and that you can't  understand. I often think how, at sunset, the past must come home to  new-chum blacksheep, sent out to Australia and drifted into the Bush.  I used to think that they couldn't have much brains, or the loneliness  would drive them mad.    I'd decided to let James take the team for a trip or two. He could drive  alright; he was a better business man, and no doubt would manage better  than me--as long as the novelty lasted; and I'd stay at home for a  week or so, till Mary got used to the place, or I could get a girl from  somewhere to come and stay with her. The first weeks or few months of  loneliness are the worst, as a rule, I believe, as they say the first  weeks in jail are--I was never there. I know it's so with tramping or  hard graft*: the first day or two are twice as hard as any of the rest.  But, for my part, I could never get used to loneliness and dulness; the  last days used to be the worst with me: then I'd have to make a move, or  drink. When you've been too much and too long alone in a lonely place,  you begin to do queer things and think queer thoughts--provided you have  any imagination at all. You'll sometimes sit of an evening and watch the  lonely track, by the hour, for a horseman or a cart or some one that's  never likely to come that way--some one, or a stranger, that you can't  and don't really expect to see. I think that most men who have been  alone in the Bush for any length of time--and married couples too--are  more or less mad. With married couples it is generally the husband who  is painfully shy and awkward when strangers come. The woman seems to  stand the loneliness better, and can hold her own with strangers, as a  rule. It's only afterwards, and looking back, that you see how queer you  got. Shepherds and boundary-riders, who are alone for months, MUST have  their periodical spree, at the nearest shanty, else they'd go raving  mad. Drink is the only break in the awful monotony, and the yearly or  half-yearly spree is the only thing they've got to look forward to: it  keeps their minds fixed on something definite ahead.         * 'Graft', work.  The term is now applied, in Australia, to       all sorts of work, from bullock-driving to writing poetry.    But Mary kept her head pretty well through the first months of  loneliness. WEEKS, rather, I should say, for it wasn't as bad as it  might have been farther up-country: there was generally some one came  of a Sunday afternoon--a spring-cart with a couple of women, or maybe  a family,--or a lanky shy Bush native or two on lanky shy horses. On  a quiet Sunday, after I'd brought Jim home, Mary would dress him and  herself--just the same as if we were in town--and make me get up on one  end and put on a collar and take her and Jim for a walk along the creek.  She said she wanted to keep me civilised. She tried to make a gentleman  of me for years, but gave it up gradually.    Well. It was the first morning on the creek: I was greasing the  waggon-wheels, and James out after the horse, and Mary hanging out  clothes, in an old print dress and a big ugly white hood, when I heard  her being hailed as 'Hi, missus!' from the front slip-rails.    It was a boy on horseback. He was a light-haired, very much freckled boy  of fourteen or fifteen, with a small head, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10366"],[0,"Freedom's Battle (#14)"],[1,"a status in the world that, shall not be surpassed by any nation.  We hope therefore that all concerned will take rather than lose heart  and treat hanging as an ordinary affair of life.    [Since the above was in type, we have received cruel news. At last H.E.  the Viceroy has mercilessly given the rude shock to Indian society. It  is now for the latter to take heart in spite of the unkindest  cut.--Ed. Y.I.]          IV. SWARAJ      SWARAJ IN ONE YEAR    Much laughter has been indulged in at my expense for having told the  Congress audience at Calcutta that if there was sufficient response to  my programme of non-co-operation Swaraj would be attained in one year.  Some have ignored my condition and laughed because of the impossibility  of getting Swaraj anyhow within one year. Others have spelt the 'if' in  capitals and suggested that if 'ifs' were permissible in argument, any  absurdity could be proved to be a possibility. My proposition however is  based on a mathematical calculation. And I venture to say that true  Swaraj is a practical impossibility without due fulfilment of my  conditions. Swaraj means a state such that we can maintain our separate  existence without the presence of the English. If it is to be a  partnership, it must be partnership at will. There can be no Swaraj  without our feeling and being the equals of Englishmen. To-day we feel  that we are dependent upon them for our internal and external security,  for an armed peace between the Hindus and the Mussulmans, for our  education and for the supply of daily wants, nay, even for the  settlement of our religious squabbles. The Rajahs are dependent upon the  British for their powers and the millionaires for their millions. The  British know our helplessness and Sir Thomas Holland cracks jokes quite  legitimately at the expense of non-co-operationists. To get Swaraj then  is to get rid of our helplessness. The problem is no doubt stupendous  even as it is for the fabled lion who having been brought up in the  company of goats found it impossible to feel that he was a lion. As  Tolstoy used to put it, mankind often laboured under hypnotism. Under  its spell continuously we feel the feeling of helplessness. The British  themselves cannot be expected to help us out of it. On the contrary,  they din into our ears that we shall be fit to govern ourselves only by  slow educative processes. The \"Times\" suggested that if we boycott the  councils we shall lose the opportunity of a training in Swaraj. I have  no doubt that there are many who believe what the \"Times\" says. It even  resorts to a falsehood. It audaciously says that Lord Milner's Mission  listened to the Egyptians only when they were ready to lift the boycott  of the Egyptian Council. For me the only training in Swaraj we need is  the ability to defend ourselves against the whole world and to live our  natural life in perfect freedom even though it may be full of defects.  Good Government is no substitute for self-Government. The Afghans have a  bad Government but it is self-Government. I envy them. The Japanese  learnt the art through a sea of blood. And if we to-day had the power to  drive out the English by superior brute force, we would be counted their  superiors, and in spite of our inexperience in debating at the Council  table or in holding executive offices, we would be held fit to govern  ourselves. For brute force is the only test the west has hitherto  recognised. The Germans were defeated not because they were necessarily  in the wrong, but because the allied Powers were found to possess  greater brute strength. In the end therefore India must either learn the  art of war which the British will not teach her or, she must follow her  own way of discipline and self-sacrifice through non-co-operation. It is  as amazing as it is humiliating that less than one hundred-thousand  white men should be able to rule three hundred and fifteen million  Indians. They do so somewhat undoubtedly by force, but more by securing  our co-operation in a thousand ways and making us more and more helpless  and dependent on them as time goes forward. Let us not mistake reformed  councils, more lawcourts and even governorships for real freedom or  power. They are but subtler methods of emasculation. The British cannot  rule us by mere force. And so they resort to all means, honourable and  dishonourable, in order to retain their hold on India. They want India's  billions and they want India's man power for their imperialistic greed.  If we refuse to supply them with men and money, we achieve our goal,  namely, Swaraj, equality, manliness.    The cup of our humiliation was filled during the closing scenes in the  Viceregal Council. Mr. Shustri could not move his resolution on the  Punjab. The Indian victims of Jullianwala received Rs. 1,250, the  English victims of mob-frenzy received lakhs. The officials who were  guilty of crimes against those whose servants they were, were  reprimanded. And the councillors were satisfied. If India were powerful,  India would not have stood this addition of insult, to her injury.    I do not blame the British. If we were weak in numbers as they are, we  too would perhaps have resorted to the same methods as they are now  employing. Terrorism and deception are weapons not of the strong but of  the weak. The British are weak in numbers we are weak in spite of our  numbers. The result is that each is dragging the other down. It is  common experience that Englishmen lose in character after residence in  India and that Indians lose in courage and manliness by contact with  Englishmen. This process of weakening is good neither for us, two  nations, nor for the world.    But if we Indians take care of ourselves the English and the rest of  the world would take care of themselves. Our contributions to the  world's progress must therefore consist in setting our own house  in order.    Training in arms for the present is out of the question. I go a step  further and believe that India has a better mission for the world. It is  within her to show that she can achieve her destiny by pure  self-sacrifice, i.e., self-purification. This can be done only by  non-co-operation. And non-co-operation is possible only when those who  commenced to co-operate being the process of withdrawal. If we can but  free ourselves from the threefold _maya_ of Government-controlled  schools, Government law-courts and legislative councils, and truly  control our own education regulate our disputes and be indifferent to  their legislation, we are ready to govern ourselves and we are only then  ready to ask the government servants, whether civil or military, to  resign, and the tax-payers to suspend payment of taxes.    And is it such an impracticable proposition to expect parents to  withdraw their children from schools and colleges and establish their  own institutions or to ask lawyers to suspend their practice and devote  their whole time attention to national service against payment where  necessary, of their maintenance, or to ask candidates for councils not  to enter councils and lend their passive or active assistance to the  legislative machinery through which all control is exercised. The  movement of non-co-operation is nothing but an attempt to isolate the  brute force of the British from all the trappings under which it is  hidden and to show that brute force by itself cannot for one single  moment hold India.    But I frankly confess that, until the three conditions mentioned by me  are fulfilled, there is no Swaraj. We may not go on taking our college  degrees, taking thousands of rupees monthly from clients for cases which  can be finished in five minutes and taking the keenest delight in  wasting national time on the council floor and still expect to gain  national self-respect.    The last though not the least important part of the Maya still remains  to be considered. That is Swadeshi. Had we not abandoned Swadeshi, we  need not have been in the present fallen state. If we would get rid of  the economic slavery, we must manufacture our own cloth and at the  present moment only by hand-spinning and hand weaving.    All this means discipline, self-denial, self-sacrifice, organising  ability, confidence and courage. If we show this in one year among the  classes that to-day count, and make public opinion, we certainly gain  Swaraj within one year. If I am told that even we who lead have not  these qualities in us, there certainly will never be Swaraj for India,  but then we shall have no right to blame the English for what they are  doing. Our salvation and its time are solely dependent upon us.      BRITISH RULE--AN EVIL    The _Interpreter_ is however more to the point in asking, \"Does Mr.  Gandhi hold without hesitation or reserve that British rule in India is  altogether an evil and that the people of India are to be taught so to  regard it? He must hold it to be so evil that the wrongs it does  outweigh the benefit it confers, for only so is non-co-operation to be  justified at the bar of conscience or of Christ.\" My answer is  emphatically in the affirmative. So long as I believed that the sum  total of the energy of the British Empire was good, I clung to it  despite what I used to regard as temporary aberrations. I am not sorry  for having done so. But having my eyes opened, it would be sin for me to  associate myself with the Empire unless it purges itself of its evil  character. I write this with sorrow and I should be pleased if I  discovered that I was in error and that my present attitude was a  reaction. The continuous financial drain, the emasculation of the Punjab  and the betrayal of the Muslim sentiment constitute, in my humble  opinion, a threefold robbery of India. 'The blessings of _pax  Britanica_' I reckon, therefore, to be a curse. We would have at least  remained like the other nations brave men and women, instead of feeling  as we do so utterly helpless, "]]]
