In making a      first call, either upon a newly-married couple, or persons newly      arrived in the neighbourhood, a lady should leave her husband's      card together with her own, at the same time, stating that the      profession or business in which he is engaged has prevented him      from having the pleasure of paying the visit, with her. It is a      custom with many ladies, when on the eve of an absence from      their neighbourhood, to leave or send their own and husband's      cards, with the letters P. P. C. in the right-hand corner. These      letters are the initials of the French words, \"_Pour prendre      conge_,\" meaning, \"To take leave.\"    32. THE MORNING CALLS BEING PAID OR RECEIVED, and their etiquette  properly attended to, the next great event of the day in most  establishments is \"The Dinner;\" and we only propose here to make a few  general remarks on this important topic, as, in future pages, the whole  \"Art of Dining\" will be thoroughly considered, with reference to its  economy, comfort, and enjoyment.    33. IN GIVING OR ACCEPTING AN INVITATION FOR DINNER, the following is  the form of words generally made use of. They, however, can be varied in  proportion to the intimacy or position of the hosts and guests:--      Mr. and Mrs. A---- present their compliments to Mr. and Mrs. B----,    and request the honour, [or hope to have the pleasure] of their                  company    to dinner on Wednesday, the 6th of December next.      A---- STREET,    _November 13th, 1859. R. S. V. P._    The letters in the corner imply \"_Repondez, s'il vous plait;_\" meaning,  \"an answer will oblige.\" The reply, accepting the invitation, is couched  in the following terms:--      Mr. and Mrs. B---- present their compliments to Mr. and Mrs. A---, and    will do themselves the honour of, [or will have much pleasure in]    accepting their kind invitation to dinner on the 6th of December next.      B---- SQUARE,    _November 18th, 1859._        Cards, or invitations for a dinner-party, should be issued a      fortnight or three weeks (sometimes even a month) beforehand,      and care should be taken by the hostess, in the selection of the      invited guests, that they should be suited to each other. Much      also of the pleasure of a dinner-party will depend on the      arrangement of the guests at table, so as to form a due      admixture of talkers and listeners, the grave and the gay. If an      invitation to dinner is accepted, the guests should be punctual,      and the mistress ready in her drawing-room to receive them. At      some periods it has been considered fashionable to come late to      dinner, but lately _nous avons change tout cela_.    34. THE HALF-HOUR BEFORE DINNER has always been considered as the great  ordeal through which the mistress, in giving a dinner-party, will either  pass with flying colours, or, lose many of her laurels. The anxiety to  receive her guests,--her hope that all will be present in due time,--her  trust in the skill of her cook, and the attention of the other  domestics, all tend to make these few minutes a trying time. The  mistress, however, must display no kind of agitation, but show her tact  in suggesting light and cheerful subjects of conversation, which will be  much aided by the introduction of any particular new book, curiosity of  art, or article of vertu, which may pleasantly engage the attention of  the company. \"Waiting for Dinner,\" however, is a trying time, and there  are few who have not felt--     \"How sad it is to sit and pine,    The long _half-hour_ before we dine!    Upon our watches oft to look,    Then wonder at the clock and cook,           *       *       *       *       *   \"And strive to laugh in spite of Fate!    But laughter forced soon quits the room,    And leaves it in its former gloom.    But lo! the dinner now appears,    The object of our hopes and fears,                  The end of all our pain!\"        In giving an entertainment of this kind, the mistress should      remember that it is her duty to make her guests feel happy,      comfortable, and quite at their ease; and the guests should also      consider that they have come to the house of their hostess to be      happy. Thus an opportunity is given to all for innocent      enjoyment and intellectual improvement, when also acquaintances      may be formed that may prove invaluable through life, and      information gained that will enlarge the mind. Many celebrated      men and women have been great talkers; and, amongst others, the      genial Sir Walter Scott, who spoke freely to every one, and a      favourite remark of whom it was, that he never did so without      learning something he didn't know before.    35. DINNER BEING ANNOUNCED, the host offers his arm to, and places on  his right hand at the dinner-table, the lady to whom he desires to pay  most respect, either on account of her age, position, or from her being  the greatest stranger in the party. If this lady be married and her  husband present, the latter takes the hostess to her place at table, and  seats himself at her right hand. The rest of the company follow in  couples, as specified by the master and mistress of the house, arranging  the party according to their rank and other circumstances which may be  known to the host and hostess.        It will be found of great assistance to the placing of a party      at the dinner-table, to have the names of the guests neatly (and      correctly) written on small cards, and placed at that part of      the table where it is desired they should sit. With respect to      the number of guests, it has often been said, that a private      dinner-party should consist of not less than the number of the      Graces, or more than that of the Muses. A party of ten or twelve      is, perhaps, in a general way, sufficient to enjoy themselves      and be enjoyed. White kid gloves are worn by ladies at      dinner-parties, but should be taken off before the business of      dining commences.    36. THE GUESTS BEING SEATED AT THE DINNER-TABLE, the lady begins to help  the soup, which is handed round, commencing with the gentleman on her  right and on her left, and continuing in the same order till all are  served. It is generally established as a rule, not to ask for soup or  fish twice, as, in so doing, part of the company may be kept waiting too  long for the second course, when, perhaps, a little revenge is taken by  looking at the awkward consumer of a second portion. This rule, however,  may, under various circumstances, not be considered as binding.        It is not usual, where taking wine is _en regle_, for a      gentleman to ask a lady to take wine until the fish or soup is      finished, and then the gentleman honoured by sitting on the      right of the hostess, may politely inquire if she will do him      the honour of taking wine with him. This will act as a signal to      the rest of the company, the gentleman of the house most      probably requesting the same pleasure of the ladies at his right      and left. At many tables, however, the custom or fashion of      drinking wine in this manner, is abolished, and the servant      fills the glasses of the guests with the various wines suited to      the course which is in progress.    37. WHEN DINNER IS FINISHED, THE DESSERT is placed on the table,  accompanied with finger-glasses. It is the custom of some gentlemen to  wet a corner of the napkin; but the hostess, whose behaviour will set  the tone to all the ladies present, will merely wet the tips of her  fingers, which will serve all the purposes required. The French and  other continentals have a habit of gargling the mouth; but it is a  custom which no English gentlewoman should, in the slightest degree,  imitate.    38. WHEN FRUIT HAS BEEN TAKEN, and a glass or two of wine passed round,  the time will have arrived when the hostess will rise, and thus give the  signal for the ladies to leave the gentlemen, and retire to the  drawing-room. The gentlemen of the party will rise at the same time, and  he who is nearest the door, will open it for the ladies, all remaining  courteously standing until the last lady has withdrawn. Dr. Johnson has  a curious paragraph on the effects of a dinner on men. \"Before dinner,\"  he says, \"men meet with great inequality of understanding; and those who  are conscious of their inferiority have the modesty not to talk. When  they have drunk wine, every man feels himself happy, and loses that  modesty, and grows impudent and vociferous; but he is not improved, he  is only not sensible of his defects.\" This is rather severe, but there  may be truth in it.        In former times, when the bottle circulated freely amongst the      guests, it was necessary for the ladies to retire earlier than      they do at present, for the gentlemen of the company soon became      unfit to conduct themselves with that decorum which is essential      in the presence of ladies. Thanks, however, to the improvements      in modern society, and the high example shown to the nation by      its most illustrious personages, temperance is, in these happy      days, a striking feature in the character of a gentleman.      Delicacy of conduct towards the female sex has increased with      the esteem in which they are now universally held, and thus, the      very early withdrawing of the ladies from the dining-room is to      be deprecated. A lull in the conversation will seasonably      indicate the moment for the ladies' departure.    39. AFTER-DINNER INVITATIONS MAY BE GIVEN; by which we wish to be  understood, invitations for the evening. The time of the arrival of  these visitors will vary according to their engagements, or sometimes  will be varied in obedience to the caprices of fashion.

When the  archers had taken their places, the herald came forward and proclaimed  the rules of the game, and how each should shoot three shots, and to him  that should shoot the best the prize of two fat steers was to belong. A  score of brave shots were gathered there, and among them some of the  keenest hands at the longbow in Lincoln and Nottinghamshire; and among  them Little John stood taller than all the rest. \"Who is yon stranger  clad all in scarlet?\" said some, and others answered, \"It is he that  hath but now so soundly cracked the crown of Eric o' Lincoln.\"  Thus the  people talked among themselves, until at last it reached even the  Sheriff's ears.    And now each man stepped forward and shot in turn; but though each shot  well, Little John was the best of all, for three times he struck the  clout, and once only the length of a barleycorn from the center.  \"Hey  for the tall archer!\" shouted the crowd, and some among them shouted,  \"Hey for Reynold Greenleaf!\" for this was the name that Little John had  called himself that day.    Then the Sheriff stepped down from the raised seat and came to where the  archers stood, while all doffed their caps that saw him coming. He  looked keenly at Little John but did not know him, though he said, after  a while, \"How now, good fellow, methinks there is that about thy face  that I have seen erewhile.\"    \"Mayhap it may be so,\" quoth Little John, \"for often have I seen Your  Worship.\"  And, as he spoke, he looked steadily into the Sheriff's eyes  so that the latter did not suspect who he was.    \"A brave blade art thou, good friend,\" said the Sheriff, \"and I hear  that thou hast well upheld the skill of Nottinghamshire against that of  Lincoln this day.  What may be thy name, good fellow?\"    \"Men do call me Reynold Greenleaf, Your Worship,\" said Little John; and  the old ballad that tells of this, adds, \"So, in truth, was he a green  leaf, but of what manner of tree the Sheriff wotted not.\"    \"Now, Reynold Greenleaf,\" quoth the Sheriff, \"thou art the fairest hand  at the longbow that mine eyes ever beheld, next to that false knave,  Robin Hood, from whose wiles Heaven forfend me!  Wilt thou join my  service, good fellow? Thou shalt be paid right well, for three suits of  clothes shalt thou have a year, with good food and as much ale as thou  canst drink; and, besides this, I will pay thee forty marks each  Michaelmastide.\"    \"Then here stand I a free man, and right gladly will I enter thy  household,\" said Little John, for he thought he might find some merry  jest, should he enter the Sheriff's service.    \"Fairly hast thou won the fat steers,\" said the Sheriff, \"and hereunto  I will add a butt of good March beer, for joy of having gotten such a  man; for, I wot, thou shootest as fair a shaft as Robin Hood himself.\"    \"Then,\" said Little John, \"for joy of having gotten myself into thy  service, I will give fat steers and brown ale to all these good folk, to  make them merry withal.\"  At this arose a great shout, many casting  their caps aloft, for joy of the gift.    Then some built great fires and roasted the steers, and others broached  the butt of ale, with which all made themselves merry. Then, when they  had eaten and drunk as much as they could, and when the day faded and  the great moon arose, all red and round, over the spires and towers of  Nottingham Town, they joined hands and danced around the fires, to the  music of bagpipes and harps. But long before this merrymaking had begun,  the Sheriff and his new servant Reynold Greenleaf were in the Castle of  Nottingham.          How Little John Lived at the Sheriff's    THUS LITTLE JOHN entered into the Sheriff's service and found the life  he led there easy enough, for the Sheriff made him his right-hand man  and held him in great favor. He sat nigh the Sheriff at meat, and he ran  beside his horse when he went a-hunting; so that, what with hunting and  hawking a little, and eating rich dishes and drinking good sack, and  sleeping until late hours in the morning, he grew as fat as a stall-fed  ox. Thus things floated easily along with the tide, until one day when  the Sheriff went a-hunting, there happened that which broke the smooth  surface of things.    This morning the Sheriff and many of his men set forth to meet certain  lords, to go a-hunting. He looked all about him for his good man,  Reynold Greenleaf, but, not finding him, was vexed, for he wished to  show Little John's skill to his noble friends.  As for Little John, he  lay abed, snoring lustily, till the sun was high in the heavens. At last  he opened his eyes and looked about him but did not move to arise.  Brightly shone the sun in at the window, and all the air was sweet with  the scent of woodbine that hung in sprays about the wall without, for  the cold winter was past and spring was come again, and Little John lay  still, thinking how sweet was everything on this fair morn. Just then he  heard, faint and far away, a distant bugle note sounding thin and clear.  The sound was small, but, like a little pebble dropped into a glassy  fountain, it broke all the smooth surface of his thoughts, until his  whole soul was filled with disturbance.  His spirit seemed to awaken  from its sluggishness, and his memory brought back to him all the merry  greenwood life--how the birds were singing blithely there this bright  morning, and how his loved companions and friends were feasting and  making merry, or perhaps talking of him with sober speech; for when he  first entered the Sheriff's service he did so in jest; but the  hearthstone was warm during the winter, and the fare was full, and so he  had abided, putting off from day to day his going back to Sherwood,  until six long months had passed.  But now he thought of his good master  and of Will Stutely, whom he loved better than anyone in all the world,  and of young David of Doncaster, whom he had trained so well in all  manly sports, till there came over his heart a great and bitter longing  for them all, so that his eyes filled with tears. Then he said aloud,  \"Here I grow fat like a stall-fed ox and all my manliness departeth from  me while I become a sluggard and dolt. But I will arouse me and go back  to mine own dear friends once more, and never will I leave them again  till life doth leave my lips.\" So saying, he leaped from bed, for he  hated his sluggishness now.    When he came downstairs he saw the Steward standing near the pantry  door--a great, fat man, with a huge bundle of keys hanging to his  girdle. Then Little John said, \"Ho, Master Steward, a hungry man am I,  for nought have I had for all this blessed morn.  Therefore, give me to  eat.\"    Then the Steward looked grimly at him and rattled the keys in his  girdle, for he hated Little John because he had found favor with the  Sheriff.  \"So, Master Reynold Greenleaf, thou art anhungered, art thou?\"  quoth he.  \"But, fair youth, if thou livest long enough, thou wilt find  that he who getteth overmuch sleep for an idle head goeth with an empty  stomach. For what sayeth the old saw, Master Greenleaf?  Is it not 'The  late fowl findeth but ill faring'?\"    \"Now, thou great purse of fat!\" cried Little John, \"I ask thee not for  fool's wisdom, but for bread and meat. Who art thou, that thou shouldst  deny me to eat? By Saint Dunstan, thou hadst best tell me where my  breakfast is, if thou wouldst save broken bones!\"    \"Thy breakfast, Master Fireblaze, is in the pantry,\" answered the  Steward.    \"Then fetch it hither!\" cried Little John, who waxed angry by this time.    \"Go thou and fetch it thine own self,\" quoth the Steward.  \"Am I thy  slave, to fetch and carry for thee?\"    \"I say, go thou, bring it me!\"    \"I say, go thou, fetch it for thyself!\"    \"Ay, marry, that will I, right quickly!\" quoth Little John in a rage.  And, so saying, he strode to the pantry and tried to open the door but  found it locked, whereat the Steward laughed and rattled his keys. Then  the wrath of Little John boiled over, and, lifting his clenched fist, he  smote the pantry door, bursting out three panels and making so large an  opening that he could easily stoop and walk through it.    When the Steward saw what was done, he waxed mad with rage; and, as  Little John stooped to look within the pantry, he seized him from behind  by the nape of the neck, pinching him sorely and smiting him over the  head with his keys till the yeoman's ears rang again.  At this Little  John turned upon the Steward and smote him such a buffet that the fat  man fell to the floor and lay there as though he would never move again.  \"There,\" quoth Little John, \"think well of that stroke and never keep a  good breakfast from a hungry man again.\"    So saying, he crept into the pantry and looked about him to see if he  could find something to appease his hunger. He saw a great venison pasty  and two roasted capons, beside which was a platter of plover's eggs;  moreover, there was a flask of sack and one of canary--a sweet sight to  a hungry man. These he took down from the shelves and placed upon a  sideboard, and prepared to make himself merry.    Now the Cook, in the kitchen across the courtyard, heard the loud  talking between Little John and the Steward, and also the blow that  Little John struck the other, so he came running across the court and up  the stairway to where the Steward's pantry was, bearing in his hands the  spit with the roast still upon it. Meanwhile the Steward had gathered  his wits about him and risen to his feet, so that when the Cook came to  the Steward's pantry he saw him glowering through the broken door at  Little John, who was making ready for a good repast, as one dog glowers  at another that has a bone.  When the Steward saw the Cook, he came to  him, and, putting one arm over his shoulder, \"Alas, sweet friend!\" quoth  he--for the Cook was a tall, stout man--\"seest thou what that vile knave  Reynold Greenleaf hath done?  He hath"]]]
