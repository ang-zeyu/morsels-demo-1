The tour was successful  in that it relieved the pressing necessities of the moment, but the  sturdy, independent spirit of the boy showed itself even then. \"The  Dutch are very stingy, and I shall take care not to trouble them  again,\" he remarked to a friend.    The boy Ludwig could play the organ fairly well, as he had studied it  with Christian Neefe, who was organist at the Court church. He also  could play the piano with force and finish, read well at sight and  knew nearly the whole of Bach's \"Well Tempered Clavichord.\" This was  a pretty good record for a boy of 11, who, if he went on as he had  begun, it was said, would become a second Mozart.    Neefe was ordered to proceed with the Elector and Court to Muenster,  which meant to leave his organ in Bonn for a time. Before starting  he called Ludwig to him and told him of his intended absence. \"I must  have an assistant to take my place at the organ here. Whom do you  think I should appoint?\" Seeing the boy had no inkling of his meaning,  he continued: \"I have thought of an assistant, one I am sure I can  trust,--and that is you, Ludwig.\"    The honor was great, for a boy of eleven and a half. To conduct the  service, and receive the respect and deference due the position, quite  overwhelmed the lad. Honors of this kind were very pleasant, but,  alas, there was no money attached to the position, and this was what  the straitened family needed most sorely. The responsibilities of the  position and the confidence of Neefe spurred Ludwig on to a passion of  work which nothing could check. He began to compose; three sonatas  for the pianoforte were written about this time. Before completing his  thirteenth year, Ludwig obtained his first official appointment from  the Elector; he became what is called cembalist in the orchestra,  which meant that he had to play the piano in the orchestra, and  conduct the band at rehearsals. With this appointment there was no  salary attached either, and it was not until a year later when he was  made second organist to the Court, under the new Elector, Max Franz,  that he began to receive a small salary, equal to about sixty-five  dollars a year. We have seen that the straits of the family had not  prevented Ludwig from pursuing his musical studies with great ardor.  With his present attainments and his ambition for higher achievements,  he longed to leave the little town of Bonn, and see something of the  great world. Vienna was the center of the musical life of Germany; the  boy dreamed of this magical city by day as he went about his routine  of work, and by night as he lay on his poor narrow cot. Like Haydn,  Vienna was the goal of his ambition. When a kind friend, knowing his  great longing, came forward with an offer to pay the expenses of the  journey, the lad knew his dream was to become a reality. In Vienna he  would see the first composers of the day; best of all he would see and  meet the divine Mozart, the greatest of them all.    Ludwig, now seventeen, set out for the city of his dreams with the  brightest anticipations. On his arrival in Vienna he went at once to  Mozart's house. He was received most kindly and asked to play, but  Mozart seemed preoccupied and paid but little attention. Ludwig,  seeing this stopped playing and asked for a theme on which to  improvise. Mozart gave a simple theme, and Beethoven, taking the  slender thread, worked it up with so much feeling and power, that  Mozart, who was now all attention and astonishment, stepped into the  next room, where some friends were waiting for him, and said, \"Pay  attention to this young man; he will make a noise in the world some  day.\"    Shortly after his return home he was saddened by the loss of his  good, kind, patient mother, and a few months later his little sister  Margaretha passed away. No doubt these sorrows were expressed in some  of his most beautiful compositions. But brighter days followed the  dark ones. He became acquainted with the Breuning family, a widow  lady and four children, three boys and a girl, all young people. The  youngest boy and the girl became his pupils, and all were very fond  of him. He would stay at their house for days at a time and was always  treated as one of the family. They were cultured people, and in  their society Beethoven's whole nature expanded. He began to take an  interest in the literature of his own country and in English authors  as well. All his spare time was given to reading and composition.  A valuable acquaintance with the young Count Von Waldstein was made  about this time. The Count called one day and found the composer at  his old worn out piano, surrounded by signs of abject poverty. It  went to his heart to see that the young man, whose music he so greatly  admired should have to struggle for the bare necessities of life while  he himself enjoyed every luxury. It seemed to him terribly unjust. He  feared to offend the composer's self-respect by sending him money, but  shortly after the call Beethoven was made happy by the gift of a fine  new piano, in place of his old one. He was very grateful for this  friendship and later dedicated to the Count one of his finest sonatas,  the Op. 53, known as the \"Waldstein Sonata.\"    With a view of aiding the growth of the opera, and operatic art, the  Elector founded a national theater, and Beethoven was appointed viola  player in the orchestra besides still being assistant organist in the  chapel. In July, 1792, the band arranged a reception for Haydn, who  was to pass through Bonn on his way from London, where he had had  a wonderful success, to his home in Vienna. Beethoven seized the  opportunity to show the master a cantata he had just composed. Haydn  praised the work and greatly encouraged the young musician to go  forward in his studies. The Elector, hearing of Haydn's words of  praise, felt that Beethoven should have the chance to develop his  talents that he might be able to produce greater works. Therefore  he decided to send the young composer, at his own expense, to  study strict counterpoint with Haydn. He was now twenty-two and his  compositions already published had brought him considerable fame and  appreciation in his vicinity. Now he was to have wider scope for his  gifts.    He bade farewell to Bonn in November of this year and set out a second  time for the city of his dreams--Vienna. He was never to see Bonn  again. He arrived in Vienna comparatively unknown, but his fine piano  playing and wonderful gift for improvising greatly impressed all  who heard him. He constantly played in the homes of the wealthy  aristocracy. Many who heard him play, engaged lessons and he was  well on the road to social success. Yet his brusque manners often  antagonized his patrons. He made no effort to please or conciliate;  he was obstinate and self-willed. In spite of all this, the innate  nobleness and truth of his character retained the regard of men and  women belonging to the highest ranks of society. With the Prince and  Princess Lichnowsky Beethoven shortly became very intimate, and was  invited to stay at the Palace. The Princess looked after his personal  comfort with as motherly an affection as Madame Breuning had done.  The etiquette of the Palace however, offended Ludwig's love of  Bohemianism, especially the dressing for dinner at a certain time.  He took to dining at a tavern quite frequently, and finally engaged  lodgings. The Prince and his good lady, far from taking offense at  this unmannerly behavior, forgave it and always kept for Beethoven a  warm place in their hearts, while he, on his part was sincere in his  affection for his kind friends.    Beethoven began his lessons with Haydn, but they did not seem to get  on well together. The pupil thought the master did not give him enough  time and attention. When Haydn went to England, about a year after the  lessons began, Beethoven studied with several of the best musicians  of the city, both in playing and composition. Albrechtsberger, one of  these, was a famous contrapuntist of his time, and the student gained  much from his teaching. The young musician was irresistible when he  seated himself at the piano to extemporize. \"His improvisating was  most brilliant and striking,\" wrote Carl Czerny, a pupil of Beethoven.  \"In whatever company he might be, he knew how to produce such an  effect upon the listeners that frequently all eyes would be wet,  and some listeners would sob; there was something wonderful in his  expressive style, the beauty and originality of his ideas and his  spirited way of playing.\" Strange to say the emotion he roused in  his hearers seemed to find no response in Beethoven himself. He would  sometimes laugh at it, at other times he would resent it, saying, \"We  artists don't want tears, we want applause.\" These expressions however  only concealed his inner feelings--for he was very sympathetic  with those friends he loved. His anger, though sharp, was of short  duration, but his suspicions of those whose confidence he had won by  his genius and force of character, were the cause of much suffering to  himself and others.    Beethoven in appearance was short and stockily built; his face was not  at all good looking. It is said he was generally meanly dressed and  was homely, but full of nobility, fine feeling and highly cultivated.  The eyes were black and bright, and they dilated, when the composer  was lost in thought, in a way that made him look inspired. A mass of  dark hair surmounted a high broad forehead. He often looked gloomy,  but when he smiled it was with a radiant brightness. His hands were  strong and the fingers short and pressed out with much practise. He  was very particular about hand position when "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13300"],[0,"The Doctrine and Practice of Yoga (#14)"],[1,"soothing and pleasant. After a bath or a thorough rubbing  of the body from top to toe, with a wet towel, on an empty stomach,  take this exercise: Send a current of holy thought to everyone, on  planes seen and unseen, north and south, east and west, engage in  meditation--take anyone of the meditation exercises you like. When you  are perfectly calm and relaxed, seat yourself cross-legged, assuming any  posture that comes easiest to you, with head, neck and chest held in a  straight line and the weight of the upper parts of the body resting on  ribs. Keep the region about the waist quite free. Loosen the cloth there  out and out. Now inhale air slowly and steadily through right nostril  after closing left nostril with your finger as long as it takes to count  sixteen mentally. Close both nostrils, holding the inspired air within  and count sixty-four. Then very slowly exhale the air through the left  nostril for as long as it takes to count thirty-two. You must begin with  a 4 second inhalation, 16 second retention and 8 second exhalation.  Instead of dry counting you might improve yourself decidedly by repeating  the word \"Fearless\" as many times holding mentally that dominant idea  back of the word. Practise 5 pranayamas mornings and evenings for one  week daily. Increase to 10 next week. Work up to 20. Go slowly. Practise  as long as you like, but not less than 6 months. Be serious and earnest.  This is not for non-serious minds. This exercise will augment digestive  power, steady heart-action, make the body light and the mind calm. It  shall help also miraculously in your Soul-Unfoldment. During this  practice be pure in all ways. Observe Bramhacharya. Practice mental  concentration and spiritual meditation. Don't talk much with others.  Don't encourage any but holy society. Don't sleep much. Don't work very  hard. Keep your emotions well-in-hand. Be always engaged mentally  and physically. Be hopeful and cheerful. Never encourage negative  thinking. It shall do wonders for you.    PHYSICAL EXERCISE.    Exercise No. 1.    Stand straight, facing a corner of the room with bare feet about 14 or 15  inches from the corner itself, arms straight out, even with shoulders or  perhaps two inches below, hands resting on the two-side walls, chest out,  abdomen in. Now lean forward towards the corner, without moving the feet  or bending the knees. Aim lightly to touch the corner with the chest,  while holding the head and abdomen as far back from the corner as  possible, arms and hands slipping forward on the walls in a straight line  with shoulders. Resume first position without moving the feet or lowering  the arms, and repeat. Make the forward movement slowly, at the same time  inhaling through nostrils a slow, full breath; put your whole effort into  stretching the chest forward and upward (careful not to bruise yourself  against wall) and head and abdomen backward, thus straightening the back  at the shoulders. Hold the chest to the corner a moment, holding the  breath likewise, then slowly resume original upright position, slowly  exhaling through slightly open lips at the same time bending the head  forward towards the chest. As you lean forward toward the corner,  mentally keep count of your exercise one, two, three, etc. As you resume  the upright position, exhaling and bending the head forward mentally,  affirm \"I am fearless, pure, strong.\" Make these movements always slowly,  deliberately, with the closest attention. Begin with 5 or 6 movements and  raise to 20 at a time.    Exercise No. 2.    Stand straight about two feet from the wall. Place the palms on the  wall-level with the shoulders. Without moving the feet or bending the  body, lean forward slowly, inhaling slowly as you do so, until the  chest touches the wall, head back; then push yourself slowly to an  upright position slowly exhaling as you do so. Repeat 10 times or more.    Exercise No. 3.    Clasp the hands behind. As you slowly inhale extend the clasped hand  slowly downwards as far as possible, straightening arms at elbow and  lowering shoulders as much as possible, at the same time extending  and lifting the chest as far as you can. Hold the breath and the position  a moment only, shoulders down, chest out and up, abdomen in, then release  the hand and slowly exhale. A rather vigorous exercise. So go slowly.    Exercise No. 4.    Stand straight, arms extended even with the shoulders, head up;  tense muscles of right arm doubling slowly at elbow and hand only, until  the clenched fist touches the shoulders; at the same time tensing the  neck muscles, chin up, and turning the head slowly to face the clenched  fist. Repeat with the left arm. The arms from shoulder to elbow must  be kept in a horizontal position.    Exercise No. 5.    Stand straight, hands at sides. Bend as far over to the right as  possible, slowly; then to the left as far as possible. Repeat 10 times.    Exercise No. 6.    Stand straight, arms at sides. Lean as far forward as you can without  bending the knees and roll the body clear around in a circle to the  right, arms and body as limp as possible. Repeat 5 times. Then roll  five times to the left.    Exercise No. 7.    Stand straight. Extend arms easily in front. Wave them backwards and  upwards in a sort of reversed swimming movement, until they meet  overhead; at the same time bending backward as far as possible slowly  inhale a full breath. Now bend forward, exhaling breath, taking care not  to bend the knees, until your fingers touch your toes, head hanging as  low as possible, toes and head as limp as possible, fingers reaching  towards the floor. Repeat upright position. Keep the knees straight  throughout. Aim to stretch the entire body and hands upward and backward  as far as possible, with the upward motion of the arms. If you can't  touch the floor without bending the knees, just come as near it as you  can. Practice will limber you up until you can touch it.    Exercise No. 8.    Lie full length on the back of the floor, hands clasped under head.  Tense the muscles of the right leg, raising the knee slowly until it  touches or almost touches the body, at the same time bending the foot  downward as far as possible, stretching the toes towards the floor. Now  slowly lower the right leg, still tense, towards the floor, straightening  the knee and turning the toe upward towards the body. As the right  leg is being lowered, raise the left one upward in the same way tensing  the muscles, knee to chest, toes stretching upward; as the left leg goes  down, point the toes and foot toward the knee 5 times, increasing  gradually to 10 times.      PHYSICAL EXERCISES.    SERIES 2.      Exercise I.    (1) Extend the arms straight out in front of you, on the level of  the shoulder, with palms of the hand touching each other; (2) swing  back the hands until the arms stand out straight, sideways, from the  shoulders or even a little further back if they will go there easily  without forcing; return briskly to position 1, and repeat several times.  The arms should be swung with a rapid movement and with animation and  life. Do not go to sleep over the work or rather play. This exercise is  most useful in developing the chest, muscles of the shoulders, etc. In  swinging the hands backward, it is an improvement if you will rise on  your toe during the backward sweep; sinking on your heels as you move the  arms forward again. The repeated movements should be rhythmical, backward  and forward, like the swinging of a quick pendulum.    Exercise II.    (1) Extend the arms straight in front of you, letting the little fingers  of each hand touch each other, the palms being upward; (2) then keeping  the little fingers still touching, bring the hands straight up in a  curved circular movement, until the tips of the fingers of both hands  touch the top of the head back of the forehead, the backs of the fingers  touching, the elbows swinging out as the movement is made until (when  the fingers touch the head, with thumbs pointing the rear) they point  out straight sideways; (3) let the fingers rest on the top of the head a  moment, and then with the elbows pressing back (which forces the  shoulders back) force the arms backward with an oblique motion until  they reach the sides at full length, as in the standing position.      Exercise III.    (1) Extend the arms straight out, sideways, from the shoulders;  (2) then, still keeping the upper arms extended in same position, bend  the arms at the elbow and bring the forearm upward with a circular  movement, until the tips of the extended fingers lightly touch the tops  of the shoulders; (3) then with fingers in the last position, force the  elbows out to the front until they touch, or nearly go (a little practice  will enable you to touch them together); (4) then, keeping the fingers  still lightly touching the tops of the shoulders, swinging the elbows as  far back as you can get them. (A little practice will enable you to get  them much farther back than at the first attempt.) (S) Swing the elbows  to the front position and then back to the rear position, several times.    Exercise IV.    (1) Place the hands on the hips, thumbs to the rear, and elbows pressed  back; (2) bend the body forward, from the hips as far as you can, keeping  the chest protruding and the shoulders pressed back; (3) raise the body  to the original standing position (hands still at the hips) and then bend  backward. In these movements the knees should not be bent and the motions  should be made slowly and gently; (4) then (hands still on the hips) bend  gently to the right, keeping the heels firmly on the ground, knees unbent  and avoid twisting the body; (5) resume original position, and then bend  the body gently to the left, observing the precautions given in the last  movement. This exercise is somewhat fatiguing and you should be careful  not to overdo it at the start. Proceed gradually; (6) with hands"]]]
