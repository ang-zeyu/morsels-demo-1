I heard steps behind me, and turning round I fired again for luck. The  steps ceased.    \"Please God,\" said I, \"she told me the truth about the ladder!\" for the  wall was high and topped with iron spikes.    Yes, there it was. I was up and over in a minute. Doubling back, I saw  the horses; then I heard a shot. It was Sapt. He had heard us, and was  battling and raging with the locked gate, hammering it and firing into  the keyhole like a man possessed. He had quite forgotten that he was  not to take part in the fight. Whereat I laughed again, and said, as I  clapped him on the shoulder:    \"Come home to bed, old chap. I've got the finest tea-table story that  ever you heard!\"    He started and cried: \"You're safe!\" and wrung my hand. But a moment  later he added:    \"And what the devil are you laughing at?\"    \"Four gentlemen round a tea-table,\" said I, laughing still, for it had  been uncommonly ludicrous to see the formidable three altogether routed  and scattered with no more deadly weapon than an ordinary tea-table.    Moreover, you will observe that I had honourably kept my word, and not  fired till they did.        CHAPTER 10    A Great Chance for a Villain      It was the custom that the Prefect of Police should send every afternoon  a report to me on the condition of the capital and the feeling of the  people: the document included also an account of the movements of any  persons whom the police had received instructions to watch. Since I had  been in Strelsau, Sapt had been in the habit of reading the report and  telling me any items of interest which it might contain. On the day  after my adventure in the summer-house, he came in as I was playing a  hand of _ecarte_ with Fritz von Tarlenheim.    \"The report is rather full of interest this afternoon,\" he observed,  sitting down.    \"Do you find,\" I asked, \"any mention of a certain fracas?\"    He shook his head with a smile.    \"I find this first,\" he said: \"'His Highness the Duke of Strelsau left  the city (so far as it appears, suddenly), accompanied by several of his  household. His destination is believed to be the Castle of Zenda, but  the party travelled by road and not by train. MM De Gautet, Bersonin,  and Detchard followed an hour later, the last-named carrying his arm in  a sling. The cause of his wound is not known, but it is suspected that  he has fought a duel, probably incidental to a love affair.'\"    \"That is remotely true,\" I observed, very well pleased to find that I  had left my mark on the fellow.    \"Then we come to this,\" pursued Sapt: \"'Madame de Mauban, whose  movements have been watched according to instructions, left by train at  midday. She took a ticket for Dresden--'\"    \"It's an old habit of hers,\" said I.    \"'The Dresden train stops at Zenda.' An acute fellow, this. And finally  listen to this: 'The state of feeling in the city is not satisfactory.  The King is much criticized' (you know, he's told to be quite frank)  'for taking no steps about his marriage. From enquiries among the  entourage of the Princess Flavia, her Royal Highness is believed to be  deeply offended by the remissness of his Majesty. The common people are  coupling her name with that of the Duke of Strelsau, and the duke gains  much popularity from the suggestion.' I have caused the announcement that  the King gives a ball tonight in honour of the princess to be widely  diffused, and the effect is good.\"    \"That is news to me,\" said I.    \"Oh, the preparations are all made!\" laughed Fritz. \"I've seen to that.\"    Sapt turned to me and said, in a sharp, decisive voice:    \"You must make love to her tonight, you know.\"    \"I think it is very likely I shall, if I see her alone,\" said I. \"Hang  it, Sapt, you don't suppose I find it difficult?\"    Fritz whistled a bar or two; then he said: \"You'll find it only too  easy. Look here, I hate telling you this, but I must. The Countess Helga  told me that the princess had become most attached to the King. Since  the coronation, her feelings have undergone a marked development. It's  quite true that she is deeply wounded by the King's apparent neglect.\"    \"Here's a kettle of fish!\" I groaned.    \"Tut, tut!\" said Sapt. \"I suppose you've made pretty speeches to a girl  before now? That's all she wants.\"    Fritz, himself a lover, understood better my distress. He laid his hand  on my shoulder, but said nothing.    \"I think, though,\" pursued that cold-blooded old Sapt, \"that you'd  better make your offer tonight.\"    \"Good heavens!\"    \"Or, any rate, go near it: and I shall send a 'semi-official' to the  papers.\"    \"I'll do nothing of the sort--no more will you!\" said I. \"I utterly  refuse to take part in making a fool of the princess.\"    Sapt looked at me with his small keen eyes. A slow cunning smile passed  over his face.    \"All right, lad, all right,\" said he. \"We mustn't press you too hard.  Soothe her down a bit, if you can, you know. Now for Michael!\"    \"Oh, damn Michael!\" said I. \"He'll do tomorrow. Here, Fritz, come for a  stroll in the garden.\"    Sapt at once yielded. His rough manner covered a wonderful tact--and  as I came to recognize more and more, a remarkable knowledge of human  nature. Why did he urge me so little about the princess? Because he  knew that her beauty and my ardour would carry me further than all his  arguments--and that the less I thought about the thing, the more likely  was I to do it. He must have seen the unhappiness he might bring on the  princess; but that went for nothing with him. Can I say, confidently,  that he was wrong? If the King were restored, the princess must turn to  him, either knowing or not knowing the change. And if the King were not  restored to us? It was a subject that we had never yet spoken of. But I  had an idea that, in such a case, Sapt meant to seat me on the throne of  Ruritania for the term of my life. He would have set Satan himself there  sooner than that pupil of his, Black Michael.      The ball was a sumptuous affair. I opened it by dancing a quadrille  with Flavia: then I waltzed with her. Curious eyes and eager whispers  attended us. We went in to supper; and, half way through, I, half mad by  then, for her glance had answered mine, and her quick breathing met my  stammered sentences--I rose in my place before all the brilliant crowd,  and taking the Red Rose that I wore, flung the ribbon with its jewelled  badge round her neck. In a tumult of applause I sat down: I saw Sapt  smiling over his wine, and Fritz frowning. The rest of the meal passed  in silence; neither Flavia nor I could speak. Fritz touched me on the  shoulder, and I rose, gave her my arm, and walked down the hall into a  little room, where coffee was served to us. The gentlemen and ladies in  attendance withdrew, and we were alone.    The little room had French windows opening on the gardens. The night was  fine, cool, and fragrant. Flavia sat down, and I stood opposite her. I  was struggling with myself: if she had not looked at me, I believe that  even then I should have won my fight. But suddenly, involuntarily, she  gave me one brief glance--a glance of question, hurriedly turned aside;  a blush that the question had ever come spread over her cheek, and she  caught her breath. Ah, if you had seen her! I forgot the King in Zenda.  I forgot the King in Strelsau. She was a princess--and I an impostor.  Do you think I remembered that? I threw myself on my knee and seized  her hands in mine. I said nothing. Why should I? The soft sounds of the  night set my wooing to a wordless melody, as I pressed my kisses on her  lips.    She pushed me from her, crying suddenly:    \"Ah! is it true? or is it only because you must?\"    \"It's true!\" I said, in low smothered tones--\"true that I love you more  than life--or truth--or honour!\"    She set no meaning to my words, treating them as one of love's sweet  extravagances. She came close to me, and whispered:    \"Oh, if you were not the King! Then I could show you how I love you! How  is it that I love you now, Rudolf?\"    \"Now?\"    \"Yes--just lately. I--I never did before.\"    Pure triumph filled me. It was I--Rudolf Rassendyll--who had won her! I  caught her round the waist.    \"You didn't love me before?\" I asked.    She looked up into my face, smiling, as she whispered:    \"It must have been your Crown. I felt it first on the Coronation Day.\"    \"Never before?\" I asked eagerly.    She laughed low.    \"You speak as if you would be pleased to hear me say 'Yes' to that,\" she  said.    \"Would 'Yes' be true?\"    \"Yes,\" I just heard her breathe, and she went on in an instant: \"Be  careful, Rudolf; be careful, dear. He will be mad now.\"    \"What, Michael? If Michael were the worst--\"    \"What worse is there?\"    There was yet a chance for me. Controlling myself with a mighty effort,  I took my hands off her and stood a yard or two away. I remember now the  note of the wind in the elm trees outside.    \"If I were not the King,\" I began, \"if I were only a private  gentleman--\"    Before I could finish, her hand was in mine.    \"If you were a convict in the prison of Strelsau, you would be my King,\"  she said.    And under my breath I groaned, \"God forgive me!\" and, holding her hand  in mine, I said again:    \"If I were not the King--\"    \"Hush, hush!\" she whispered. \"I don't deserve it--I don't deserve to be  doubted. Ah, Rudolf! does a woman who marries without love look on the  man as I look on you?\"    And she hid her face from me.    For more than a minute we stood there together; and I, even with my arm  about her, summoned up what honour and conscience her beauty and the  toils that I was in had left me.    \"Flavia,\" I said, in a strange dry voice that seemed not my own, \"I am  not--\"    As I spoke--as she raised her eyes to me--there was a heavy step on the  gravel outside, and a man appeared "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/950"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Runabout; Or, The Speediest Car on the Road (#13)"],[1," up, or anything like that?\"    \"No,\" replied the lad, as he leaped out of the car, and began to make  an examination. Mr. Sharp assisted him.    \"The motor seems to be all right,\" remarked the balloonist, as he  inspected it.    \"Yes,\" agreed our hero, \"and the batteries have plenty of power left in  them yet. The gauge shows that. I can't understand what the trouble can  be, unless--\" He paused in his remark and uttered an exclamation. \"I've  found it!\" he cried.    \"What?\" demanded the aeronaut.    \"Some of the fuses blew out. I turned on too much current, and the  fuses wouldn't carry it. I put them in to save the motor from being  burned out, but I didn't use heavy enough ones. I see where my mistake  was.\"    \"But what does it mean?\" inquired Mr. Damon.    \"It means that we've got to walk back home,\" was Tom's sorrowful  answer. \"The car is stalled, for I haven't any extra fuses with me.\"    \"Can't you connect up the battery by using some extra wire?\" asked Mr.  Sharp. \"I have some,\" and he drew a coil of it from his pocket.    \"I wouldn't dare to. It might be so heavy that it would carry more  current than the motor could stand. I don't want to burn that out. No,  I guess we'll have to walk home, or rather I will.  You two can stay  here until I come back with heavier fuses. I'm sorry.\"    Tom had hardly ceased speaking, when, from around the turn in the road  proceeded a voice, and, at the sound of it all three started, for the  voice was saying:    \"Now it ain't no use fer yo' to act dat-a-way, Boomerang. Yo' all ain't  got no call t' git contrary now, jest when I wants t' git home t' mah  dinner. I should t'ink you'd want t' git t' de stable, too. But ef yo'  all ain't mighty keerful I'll cut down yo' rations, dat's what I'se  goin' to do. G'lang, now, dat's a good feller. Ho! Ho! I knowed dat'd  fetch yo' all. When yo' all wiggles yo' ears dat-a-way, dat's a suah  sign yo' all is gwine t' move.\"    Then followed the sound of a rattletrap of a wagon approaching.    \"Eradicate! It's Eradicate!\" exclaimed Tom.    \"And his mule, Boomerang!\" added Mr. Sharp. \"He's just in time!\"  commented Mr. Damon with a sigh of relief, as the ancient outfit, in  charge of the aged colored man, came along. Eradicate had been sent to  Shopton to get a load of wood for Mr. Swift, and was now returning. At  the sight of the stalled auto the mule pricked up his long ears, and  threw them forward.    \"Whoa dar, now, Boomerang!\" cried Eradicate. \"Doan't yo' all commence  t' gittin' skittish. Dat machine ain't gwine t' hurt yo'. Why good  land a' massy! Ef 'tain't Mistah Swift!\" cried the colored man, as he  caught sight of Tom. \"What's de trouble?\" he asked.    \"Broke down,\" answered the young inventor briefly. \"You always seem to  come along when I'm in trouble, Rad.\"    \"Dat's right,\" assented the darkey, with a grin. \"Me an' trouble am ole  acquaintances. Sometimes she hits me a clip on de haid, den, ag'in  Boomerang, mah mule, gits it. He jest had his trouble. Got a stone  under his shoe, an' didn't want t' move. Den when I did git him started  he balked on me. But I'se all right now. But I suah am sorry fo' you.  Can't I help yo' all, Mistah Swift?\"    \"Yes, you can, Rad,\" answered Tom. \"Drive home as fast as you can, and  ask Dad to send back with you some of those fuses he'll find on my work  bench. He knows what I want. Hurry there and hurry back.\"    Eradicate shook his head doubtfully.    \"What's the matter? Don't you want to go?\" asked Mr. Sharp, a trifle  nettled. \"We can't get the car started until we have some new fuses.\"    \"Oh, I wants t' go all right 'nuff, Mistah Sharp,\" was Eradicate's  prompt answer. \"Yo' all knows I'd do anyt'ing t' 'blige yo' or Mistah  Swift. But hits dish yeah mule, Boomerang. I jest done promised him dat  we were gwine home t' dinnah, an' he 'spects a manger full ob oats. Ef  I got to Mistah Swift's house wid him, I couldn't no mo' git him t'  come back widout his dinnah, dan yo' all kin git dat 'ar car t' move  widout dem fusin' t'ings yo' all talked about.\"    \"Bless my necktie!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"That's all nonsense!  You  don't suppose that mule understands what you say to him, do you? How  does he know you promised him his dinner?\"    \"I doan't know how he know, Mistah Damon,\" replied Eradicate, \"but he  do know, jest de same. I know hit would be laik pullin' teeth an' wuss  too, t' git Boomerang t' start back wid dem foosd t'ings until after  he's had his dinner. Wouldn't it, Boomerang?\"    The mule waved his long ears as if in answer.    \"Bless my soul, I believe he does understand!\" cried Mr. Damon.    \"Of course he do,\" put in the colored man. \"I'se awful sorry.  Now if  it were afternoon I could bring back dem what-d'ye-call-'ems in a  jiffy, 'cause Boomerang allers feels good arter he has his dinnah, but  befo' dat--\" and Eradicate shook his head, as if there was no more to  be said on the subject.    \"Well,\" remarked Tom, sadly, \"I guess there's no help for it.  We'll  have to walk home, unless you two want to wait until I can ride back  with Eradicate, and come back on my motor cycle. Then I'll have to  leave the cycle here, for I can't get it in the car.\"    \"Bless my collar button!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"It's like the puzzle of the  fox, the goose and the bag of corn on the banks of a stream. I guess  we'd better all walk.\"    \"Hold on!\" exclaimed Mr. Sharp. \"Is your mule good and strong,  Eradicate?\"    \"Strong? Why dish yeah mule could pull a house ober--dat is when he's  got a mind to. An' he'd do most anyt'ing now, 'ca'se he's anxious t'  git home t' his dinnah; ain't yo' all, Boomerang?\"    Once more the mule waved his ears, like signal flags.    \"Then I have a proposition to make,\" went on the balloonist.  \"Unhitch  the mule from the load of wood, and hitch him to the auto. We've got  some rope along, I noticed. Then the mule can pull us and the runabout  home.\"    \"Good idea!\" cried Mr. Damon.    \"Dat's de racket!\" ejaculated Eradicate. \"I'll jest sequesterate dish  year load ob wood side ob de road, an' hitch Boomerang to de auto.\"    Tom said nothing for a few seconds.  He gazed sadly at his auto, which  he hoped would win the touring club's prize. It was a bitter pill for  him to swallow.    \"Towed by a mule!\" he exclaimed, shaking his head, and smiling  ruefully. \"The fastest car in this country towed by a mule! It's tough  luck!\"    \"'Tain't half so bad as goin' widout yo' dinnah, Mistah Swift!\"  remarked Eradicate, as he began to harness the mule to the electric  runabout.    Boomerang made no objection to the transfer. He looked around once or  twice as he was being made fast to the auto and, when the word was  given he stepped out as if pulling home stalled cars was his regular  business. Tom sat beside Eradicate on the front seat, and steered,  while the colored man drove the mule, and Mr. Sharp and Mr. Damon were  in the \"tonneau\" seats as Tom called them.    \"I hope no one sees us,\" thought Tom, but he was doomed to  disappointment. When nearly home he heard an auto approaching, and in  it were Andy Foger, Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey. The three cronies  stared at the odd sight of Boomerang ambling along, with his great ears  flapping, drawing Tom's speedy new car.    \"Ha! Ha!\" laughed Andy. \"So that's the motive power he's going to use!  Look at him, fellows. I thought his new electric, that was going to  beat my car, and win the prize, was to be two hundred horse power.  Instead it's one mule power! That's rich!\" and Andy's chums joined in  the laugh at poor Tom.    The young inventor said nothing, for there was nothing he could say. In  dignified silence he passed the car containing his enemies, they,  meanwhile, jeering at him.    \"Dat's all right,\" spoke Eradicate, sympathizing with his young  employer. \"Maybe dey'll 'want a tow derselves some day, an' when dey  does, I'll make Boomerang pull 'em in a ditch.\"    But this was small comfort to Tom. He made up his mind, though, that he  would demonstrate that his car could do all that he had claimed for it,  and that very soon.          CHAPTER XIV    A GREAT RUN      Boomerang did not belie the reputation Eradicate had given him as a  beast of strength. Though the electric runabout was heavy, the mule  managed to move it along the road at a fair speed, with the four  occupants. Perhaps the animal knew that at the end of his journey a  good feed awaited him. At any rate they were soon within sight of the  Swift home.    Mr. Damon and Mr. Sharp refrained from making any comments that might  hurt Tom's feelings, for they realized the chagrin felt by the young  inventor in having his apparatus go back on him at the first trial. But  our hero was not the kind of a lad who is disheartened by one failure,  or even half a dozen.    The humor of the situation appealed to him, and, as he turned the auto  into the driveway, and noticed Boomerang's long ears waving to and fro,  he laughed.    The lad insisted on putting new fuses in the car before he ate his  dinner, and then, satisfied that the motor was once more in running  order, he partook of a hasty meal, and began making several changes  which he had decided were desirable. He finished them in time to go for  a little run in the car all alone on a secluded road late that  afternoon.    Tom returned, with eyes shining, and cheeks flushed with elation.    \"Well, how did it go? asked his father.    \"Fine! Better than I expected,\" responded his son enthusiastically.  \"When it gets to running smoothly I'll pass anything on the road.\"    \"Don't be too sure,\" cautioned Mr. Swift, but Tom only smiled.    There was still much to do on the electric runabout, and Tom spent the  next few days in adjusting the light steel wind-shield, that was to  come down over the driver's seat. He also put in a powerful electric  search-light, which was run by current from the battery, and installed  a new speedometer and an instrument to tell how much current he was  using,"]]]
