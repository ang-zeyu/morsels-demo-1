The commanding General von Laffert has never uttered the words  ascribed to him, that the Kaiser had been murdered. These reports must  be contradicted with the greatest energy.\"[43]    [Footnote 43: _Leipziger Tageblatt_, August 3rd.]    The following extracts are of the greatest importance, for they prove  beyond doubt the source of these lies, and the cold-blooded, calculated  manner in which they were circulated by the German authorities:    \"The decision as to what may be published in newspapers, is now in the  hands of the military commander in each district.    \"The regulations issued by the military authorities, force certain  restrictions upon us and threaten the existence of our journals. As  regards our principles and convictions no change has taken place.\"[44]    [Footnote 44: The editor of the _Vorwaerts_ to his readers on August  1st.]    \"Berlin, August 10th.--Major Nicolai, director of the Press department  of the General Staff, received representatives of the Press to-day and  communicated to them, _inter alia_, the following details: Our army  commanders decline to enter into competition with the lie-factories  abroad. They will convince the world that truth is on our side, and that  we spread neither lies nor coloured reports. We hope in a short time to  be able to prove how much our enemies have sinned against the truth.    \"What have we achieved up till now? The dreaded invasion of Russian  cavalry was broken up by our frontier guards alone. Indeed, in many  cases only the Landwehr was needed to throw back the invaders. What  about the destruction of important buildings, railways, bridges and such  like? Nothing at all has happened.\"[45]    [Footnote 45: Condensed translation of the report in the _Leipziger  Volkszeitung_, August 11th.]    On another page of the same issue a long official army order to the  Press is given in which this paragraph occurs: \"All news given out by  Wolff's Telegraph-Bureau may only be quoted literally as they stand and  the source named by the initials W.T.-B.\"    It is thus clear that the news-agency mentioned performs two separate  functions, although the German army authorities do not draw this  distinction. First, the circulation of reports issued by the Army  Headquarters in the field, for the truth of which the Berlin General  Staff guarantees. Secondly, the spreading of their own news, and  information supplied to them by other German Government departments. All  news published by the agency has thus received the stamp of official  authority, and the German public is too ignorant to recognize the  palpable fraud.    \"Metz, August 3rd.--A French doctor, accompanied by two officers in  disguise, was caught yesterday while trying to infect the water supply  with cholera bacilli. He was at once shot under military law.\"[46]    [Footnote 46: _Deutsche Tageszeitung_, August 3rd.]    \"The report of the Metz water supply being infected, which was given out  by Wolff's Bureau yesterday, proves to be a pure invention. The agency  informs us that there is no ground for uneasiness, but the state of  affairs at present makes it imperative to exercise great care.\"[47]    [Footnote 47: _Berliner Tageblatt_, August 4th.]    \"Coblence, August 2nd.--The Government-president in Duesseldorf reports  that twelve motor-cars containing eighty French officers in Prussian  uniforms tried this morning to cross the Prussian frontier by Walbeck,  west of Geldern. The attempt failed.\"[48]    [Footnote 48: Ibid., August 3rd.]    Referring to this episode another paper wrote: \"The alleged attempt of  whole caravans of French officers, masquerading as German lieutenants,  to enter the Rhine province as spies is too adventurous to be believed.  Especially as it is known that the Dutch frontier is very strictly  guarded.    \"But Wolff's Bureau, which at present takes every precaution, circulated  the news. Hence we have here an instance of France violating Dutch  neutrality.\"[49]    [Footnote 49: _Koelnische Volkszeitung_, August 3rd.]    As far as the author is aware, the German Government has not yet  protested to the Dutch authorities for this breach of their neutrality.    The poisoned-water-supplies lie deserves further attention. It was  scattered broadcast throughout the land, and millions of credulous  Germans reduced to a state of absolute panic and--what was intended by  those who spread the lie--blind hate against Germany's opponents. I have  before me a number of descriptions of scares in various parts of the  Fatherland. A few notices will suffice as illustrations.    \"A most terrifying report spread like wild-fire through the town last  Monday morning, and reached to the farthest suburbs. The waters of the  Mangfall had been poisoned by Russian spies, and everyone's life was in  danger. It is hardly possible to conceive the effect of this terrible  rumour. Messengers of despair rushed from house to house, knocking at  strangers' doors in order to spread the warning. 'That is a devilish  deed!' stammered the white lips of women. 'Only barbarians wage war in  this manner!' hissed the men, trembling with rage and hate.\"[50]    [Footnote 50: The full report of this Munich scare occupies more than a  column in the _Muenchen-Augsburger Abendzeitung_, August 10th.]    The _Breslauer-Morgenzeitung_ for August 10th contains an announcement  from the Breslau municipality warning the inhabitants that the waters of  the Oder have possibly been poisoned, and appealing for every precaution  to be taken before drinking from the town supply, till a fresh supply  can be provided.    \"The authorities in Danzig have declared the waters of the Weichsel to  be under suspicion of having been infected with cholera bacilli. It is  presumed that cholera is raging on the upper Weichsel in Russia, and  that the Russians have not allowed this to become known. Water from the  river must not be used for any purposes connected with human food or  drink.\"[51]    [Footnote 51: _Leipziger Neuesten Nachrichten_, August 20th. A lying  report put in circulation hundreds of miles away from Danzig.]    Finally the originator of these rumours piously contradicts them all and  announces, \"lieb Vaterland magst ruhig sein,\" in the following words:    \"Wolff's Bureau reports: There is absolutely no reason for anxiety on  account of the alleged poisoning and infection of rivers, water supplies  and springs which have been reported unauthoritatively from all parts of  the country, and published in the Press. These rumours, which have  caused grave anxiety, on closer investigation have all proved to be  utterly unfounded.\"[52]    [Footnote 52: _Leipziger Volkszeitung_, August 27th.]    The war had lasted for four weeks, and although no rivers had been  poisoned, the same could not be said of the currents of popular opinion.    \"While I was walking down a street in Breslau a tram suddenly stopped,  loud cries proceeding from within it. The occupants had discovered a  Russian, dragged him out and handed him over to a policeman who led the  man away. But the official was unable to protect him, and blows with  fists and sticks literally rained on the defenceless fellow. The couple,  surrounded by a howling crowd, had just moved away, when a nun attracted  the attention of the crowd. On account of a report that a Russian spy  disguised as a nun had been arrested the same morning, the people  imagined the nun to be a man in disguise.    \"Smiling at the ridiculous supposition and the maddened howls of the  ever-increasing throng, the lady endeavoured to enter a tram. Men placed  themselves in front of the car, others dragged the frightened woman out  again and with blows and kicks she was driven before them to the next  police station. But the saddest part of these excesses--and I am only  describing a few of which I was accidentally a witness--is that members  of the so-called educated classes participated in them.\"[53]    [Footnote 53: A special correspondent in the _Frankfurter Zeitung_,  August 7th.]    \"On one of the most frequented open places in Breslau a soldier  approached a lady and looked searchingly into her face. She understood  him, and remarked with a smile: 'I am not a spy!' The man replied: 'But  you have short hair. I am sorry, you must come with me.'    \"She at once recognized that the wisest plan was to accompany him, and  turned to do so. The movement worked like a signal; the bystanders  immediately threw themselves in blind rage upon the defenceless woman.  In vain the single soldier tried to protect her, and equally in vain was  the assistance of two policemen who had come up. Her cries to be taken  into a neighbouring house for safety met with no response.    \"Her garments were literally torn from her body, a spectacle which  finally proved to her persecutors that she actually was a woman, but  that fact no longer protects her. Brutal instincts, once let loose, are  mad and unrestrained. Blows continue to fall on her head and kicks rain  against her body. She only tries to shield her eyes. 'Take her to the  police station' was shouted, but that is some distance away. And any  second may mean death--a horrible, disgraceful death.    \"Having arrived in the guard-room the officials are soon convinced that  they have to do with an absolutely innocent woman. Outside the throngs  yelled in triumph.\"[54]    [Footnote 54: _Breslauer Generalanzeiger_, August 6th.]    A German officer wrote the following"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10201"],[0,"The Desert of Wheat (#14)"],[1," he replied, huskily.    Lenore had proceeded so cleverly to carry out her scheme that in three  days Nash had begun to implore and demand that she elope with him. He  had been so much of a fool. But she as yet had found out but little  about him. His right name was Ruenke. He was a socialist. He had plenty  of money and hinted of mysterious sources for more.    At this Lenore hid her face, and while she fell back in pretended  distress, she really wanted to laugh. She had learned something new in  these few days, and that was to hate.    \"Oh no! no!\" she murmured. \"I--I can't think of that--yet.\"    \"But why not?\" he demanded, in shrill violence. His gloved hand clenched  on the tool he held.    \"Mother has been so unhappy--with my brother Jim--off to the war. I--I  just couldn't--now. Harry, you must give me time. It's all so--so  sudden. Please wait!\"    Nash appeared divided between two emotions. Lenore watched him from  behind her parted veil. She had been astonished to find out that, side  by side with her intense disgust and shame at the part she was playing,  there was a strong, keen, passionate interest in it, owing to the fact  that, though she could prove little against this man, her woman's  intuition had sensed his secret deadly antagonism toward her father. By  little significant mannerisms and revelations he had more and more  betrayed the German in him. She saw it in his overbearing conceit, his  almost instant assumption that he was her master. At first Lenore feared  him, but, as she learned to hate him she lost her fear. She had never  been alone with him except under such circumstances as this; and she had  decided she would not be.    \"Wait?\" he was expostulating. \"But it's going to get hot for me.\"    \"Oh!... What do you mean?\" she begged. \"You frighten me.\"    \"Lenore, the I.W.W. will have hard sledding in this wheat country. I  belong to that. I told you. But the union is run differently this  summer. And I've got work to do--that I don't like, since I fell in love  with you. Come, run off with me and I'll give it up.\"    Lenore trembled at this admission. She appeared to be close upon further  discovery.    \"Harry, how wildly you talk!\" she exclaimed. \"I hardly know you. You  frighten me with your mysterious talk.... Have--a--a little  consideration for me.\"    Nash strode back to lean into the car. Behind his huge goggles his eyes  gleamed. His gloved hand closed hard on her arm.    \"It is sudden. It's got to be sudden,\" he said, in fierce undertone.  \"You must trust me.\"    \"I will. But you must confide in me,\" she replied, earnestly. \"I'm not  quite a fool. You're rushing me--too--too--\"    Suddenly he released her, threw up his hand, then quickly stepped back  to the front of the car. Jake stood in the door of the hotel. He had  seen that action of Nash's. Then Anderson appeared, followed by a boy  carrying a glass of water for Lenore. They approached the car, Jake  sauntering last, with his curious gaze on Nash.    \"Go in an' get a bite an' a drink,\" said Anderson to the driver. \"An'  hurry.\"    Nash obeyed. Jake's eyes never left him until he entered the door. Then  Jake stepped in beside Lenore.    \"Thet water's wet, anyhow,\" he drawled.    \"We'll get a good cold drink at Dorn's,\" said Anderson. \"Lass, how are  you makin' it?\"    \"Fine,\" she replied, smiling.    \"So I seen,\" significantly added Jake, with a piercing glance at her.    Lenore realized then that she would have to confide in Jake or run the  risk of having violence done to Nash. So she nodded wisely at the cowboy  and winked mischievously, and, taking advantage of Anderson's entering  the car, she whispered in Jake's ear: \"I'm finding out things. Tell  you--later.\"    The cowboy looked anything but convinced; and he glanced with narrowed  eyes at Nash as that worthy hurried back to the car.    With a lurch and a leap the car left Palmer behind in a cloud of dust.  The air was furnace-hot, oppressive, and exceedingly dry. Lenore's lips  smarted so that she continually moistened them. On all sides stretched  dreary parched wheat-fields. Anderson shook his head sadly. Jake said:  \"Ain't thet too bad? Not half growed, an' sure too late now.\"    Near at hand Lenore saw the short immature dirty-whitish wheat, and she  realized that it was ruined.    \"It's been gettin' worse, Jake,\" remarked Anderson. \"Most of this won't  be cut at all. An' what is cut won't yield seedlings. I see a yellow  patch here an' there on the north slopes, but on the most part the  Bend's a failure.\"    \"Father, you remember Dorn's section, that promised so well?\" asked  Lenore.    \"Yes. But it promised only in case of rain. I look for the worst,\"  replied Anderson, regretfully.    \"It looks like storm-clouds over there,\" said Lenore, pointing far  ahead.    Through the drifting veils of heat, far across the bare, dreamy hills of  fallow and the blasted fields of wheat, stood up some huge white  columnar clouds, a vivid contrast to the coppery sky.    \"By George! there's a thunderhead!\" exclaimed Anderson. \"Jake, what do  you make of that?\"    \"Looks good to me,\" replied Jake, who was always hopeful.    Lenore bore the hot wind and the fine, choking dust without covering her  face. She wanted to see all the hills and valleys of this desert of  wheat. Her heart beat a little faster as, looking across that waste on  waste of heroic labor, she realized she was nearing the end of a ride  that might be momentous for her. The very aspect of that wide, treeless  expanse, with all its overwhelming meaning, seemed to make her a  stronger and more thoughtful girl. If those endless wheat-fields were  indeed ruined, what a pity, what a tragedy! Not only would young Dorn be  ruined, but perhaps many other toiling farmers. Somehow Lenore felt no  hopeless certainty of ruin for the young man in whom she was interested.    \"There, on that slope!\" spoke up Anderson, pointing to a field which was  yellow in contrast to the surrounding gray field. \"There's a  half-section of fair wheat.\"    But such tinges of harvest gold were not many in half a dozen miles of  dreary hills. Where were the beautiful shadows in the wheat? wondered  Lenore. Not a breath of wind appeared to stir across those fields.    As the car neared the top of a hill the road curved into another, and  Lenore saw a dusty flash of another car passing on ahead.    Suddenly Jake leaned forward.    \"Boss, I seen somethin' throwed out of thet car--into the wheat,\" he  said.    \"What?--Mebbe it was a bottle,\" replied Anderson, peering ahead.    \"Nope. Sure wasn't thet.... There! I seen it again. Watch, boss!\"    Lenore strained her eyes and felt a stir of her pulses. Jake's voice was  perturbing. Was it strange that Nash slowed up a little where there was  no apparent need? Then Lenore saw a hand flash out of the side of the  car ahead and throw a small, glinting object into the wheat.    \"There! Seen it again,\" said Jake.    \"I saw!... Jake, mark that spot.... Nash, slow down,\" yelled Anderson.    Lenore gathered from the look of her father and the cowboy that  something was amiss, but she could not guess what it might be. Nash bent  sullenly at his task of driving.    \"I reckon about here,\" said Jake, waving his hand.    \"Stop her,\" ordered Anderson, and as the car came to a halt he got out,  followed by Jake.    \"Wal, I marked it by thet rock,\" declared the cowboy.    \"So did I,\" responded Anderson. \"Let's get over the fence an' find what  it was they threw in there.\"    Jake rested a lean hand on a post and vaulted the fence. But Anderson  had to climb laboriously and painfully over the barbed-wire obstruction.  Lenore marveled at his silence and his persistence. Anderson hated wire  fences. Presently he got over, and then he divided his time between  searching in the wheat and peering after the strange car that was  drawing far away.    Lenore saw Jake pick up something and scrutinize it.    \"I'll be dog-goned!\" he muttered. Then he approached Anderson. \"What is  thet?\"    \"Jake, you can lambaste me if I ever saw the likes,\" replied Anderson.  \"But it looks bad. Let's rustle after that car.\"    As Anderson clambered into his seat once more he looked dark and grim.    \"Catch that car ahead,\" he tersely ordered Nash. Whereupon the driver  began to go through his usual motions in starting.    \"Lenore, what do you make of this?\" queried Anderson, turning to show  her a small cake of some gray substance, soft and wet to the touch.    \"I don't know what it is,\" replied Lenore, wonderingly. \"Do you?\"    \"No. An' I'd give a lot--Say, Nash, hurry! Overhaul that car!\"    Anderson turned to see why his order had not been obeyed. He looked  angry. Nash made hurried motions. The car trembled, the machinery began  to whir--then came a tremendous buzzing roar, a violent shaking of the  car, followed by sharp explosions, and silence.    \"You stripped the gears!\" shouted Anderson, with the red fading out of  his face.    \"No; but something's wrong,\" replied Nash. He got out to examine the  engine.    Anderson manifestly controlled strong feeling. Lenore saw Jake's hand go  to her father's shoulder. \"Boss,\" he whispered, \"we can't ketch thet car  now.\" Anderson resigned himself, averted his face so that he could not  see Nash, who was tinkering with the engine. Lenore believed then that  Nash had deliberately stalled the engine or disordered something, so as  to permit the escape of the strange car ahead. She saw it turn off the  long, straight road ahead and disappear to the right. After some  minutes' delay Nash resumed his seat and started the car once more.    From the top of the next hill Lenore saw the Dorn farm and home. All the  wheat looked parched. She remembered, however, that the section of  promising grain lay on the north slope, and therefore out of sight from  where she was.    \"Looks as bad as any,\" said Anderson. \"Good-by to my money.\"    Lenore shut her eyes and thought of herself, her inward state."]]]
