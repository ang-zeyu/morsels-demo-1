My father Nu saith:--  They covered up (or, concealed) my Eye with the plant-like clouds which  were behind them (i.e., Shu and Tefnut) for very many hen periods.  Plants and creeping things [sprang up] from the god REM, through the  tears which I let fall.  I cried out to my Eye, and men and women came  into existence.  Then I bestowed upon my Eye the uraeus of fire, and it  was wroth with me when another Eye (i.e., the Moon) came and grew up in  its place; its vigorous power fell on the plants, on the plants which I  had placed there, and it set order among them, and it took up its place  in my face, and it doth rule the whole earth.  Then Shu and Tefnut  brought forth Osiris, and Heru-khenti-an-maa, and Set, and Isis, and  Nephthys and behold, they have produced offspring, and have created  multitudinous children in this earth, by means of the beings which came  into existence from the creatures which they produced.  They invoke my  name, and they overthrow their enemies, and they make words of power  for the overthrowing of Apep, over whose hands and arms AKER keepeth  ward.  His hands and arms shall not exist, his feet and leas shall not  exist, and he is chained in one place whilst Ra inflicts upon him the  blows which are decreed for him.  He is thrown upon his accursed back,  his face is slit open by reason of the evil which he hath done, and he  shall remain upon his accursed back.\"        [FN#57]  i.e., I uttered my own name from my own mouth as a word of  power.            THE LEGEND OF THE DESTRUCTION OF MANKIND.        CHAPTER I.        [Here is the story of Ra,] the god who was self-begotten and self-  created, after he had assumed the sovereignty over men and women, and  gods, and things, the ONE god.  Now men and women were speaking words  of complaint, saying:--\"Behold, his Majesty (Life, Strength, and Health  to him!) hath grown old, and his bones have become like silver, and  his members have turned into gold and his hair is like unto real lapis-  lazuli.\"  His Majesty heard the words of complaint which men and women  were uttering, and his Majesty (Life, Strength, and Health to him!)  said unto those who were in his train:--\"Cry out, and bring to me my  Eye, and Shu, and Tefnut, and Seb, and Nut, and the father-gods, and  the mother-gods who were with me, even when I was in Nu side by side  with my god Nu.  Let there be brought along with my Eye his ministers,  and let them be led to me hither secretly, so that men and women may  not perceive them [coming] hither, and may not therefore take to flight  with their hearts.  Come thou[FN#58] with them to the Great House, and  let them declare their plans (or, arrangements) fully, for I will go  from Nu into the place wherein I brought about my own existence, and  let those gods be brought unto me there.\"  Now the gods were drawn up  on each side of Ra, and they bowed down before his Majesty until their  heads touched the ground, and the maker of men and women, the king of  those who have knowledge, spake his words in the presence of the Father  of the first-born gods. And the gods spake in the presence of his  Majesty, saying:--\"Speak unto us, for we are listening to them\" (i.e.,  thy words).  Then Ra spake unto Nu, saying:--\"O thou first-born god  from whom I came into being, O ye gods of ancient time, my ancestors,  take ye heed to what men and women [are doing]; for behold, those who  were created by my Eye are uttering words of complaint against me.  Tell me what ye would do in the matter, and consider this thing for me,  and seek out [a plan] for me, for I will not slay them until I have  heard what ye shall say to me concerning it.\"        [FN#58]  The god here addressed appears to have been Nu.        Then the Majesty of Nu, to son Ra, spake, saying:--\"Thou art the god  who art greater than he who made thee, thou art the sovereign of those  who were created with thee, thy throne is set, and the fear of thee is  great; let thine Eye go against those who have uttered blasphemies  against thee.\"  And the Majesty of Ra, said:--\"Behold, they have  betaken themselves to flight into the mountain lands, for their hearts  are afraid because of the words which they have uttered.\"  Then the  gods spake in the presence of his Majesty, saying:--\"Let thine Eye go  forth and let it destroy for thee those who revile thee with words of  evil, for there is no eye whatsoever that can go before it and resist  thee and it when it journeyeth in the form of Hathor.\"  Thereupon this  goddess went forth and slew the men and the women who were on the  mountain (or, desert land).  And the Majesty of this god said, \"Come,  come in peace, O Hathor, for the work is accomplished.\"  Then this  goddess said, \"Thou hast made me to live, for when I gained the mastery  over men and women it was sweet to my heart;\" and the Majesty of Ra  said, \"I myself will be master over them as [their] king, and I will  destroy them.\"  And it came to pass that Sekhet of the offerings waded  about in the night season in their blood, beginning at Suten-  henen.[FN#59]  Then the Majesty of Ra, spake [saying], \"Cry out, and  let there come to me swift and speedy messengers who shall be able to  run like the wind . . . .;\" and straightway messengers of this kind  were brought unto him.  And the Majesty of this god spake [saying],  \"Let these messengers go to Abu,[FN#60] and bring unto me mandrakes in  great numbers;\" and [when] these mandrakes were brought unto him the  Majesty of this god gave them to Sekhet, the goddess who dwelleth in  Annu (Heliopolis) to crush.  And behold, when the maidservants were  bruising the grain for [making] beer, these mandrakes were placed in  the vessels which were to hold the beer, and some of the blood of the  men and women [who had been slain].  Now they made seven thousand  vessels of beer.  Now when the Majesty of Re, the King of the South and  North, had come with the gods to look at the vessels of beer, and  behold, the daylight had appeared after the slaughter of men and women  by the goddess in their season as she sailed up the river, the Majesty  of Ra said, \"It is good, it is good, nevertheless I must protect men  and women against her.\"  And Ra, said, \"Let them take up the vases and  carry them to the place where the men and women were slaughtered by  her.\"  Then the Majesty of the King of the South and North in the  three-fold beauty of the night caused to be poured out these vases of  beer which make [men] to lie down (or, sleep), and the meadows of the  Four Heavens[FN#61] were filled with beer (or, water) by reason of the  Souls of the Majesty of this god.  And it came to pass that when this  goddess arrived at the dawn of day, she found these [Heavens] flooded  [with beer], and she was pleased thereat; and she drank [of the beer  and blood], and her heart rejoiced, and she became drunk, and she gave  no further attention to men and women.  Then said the Majesty of Ra to  this goddess, \"Come in peace, come in peace, O Amit,\"[FN#62] and  thereupon beautiful women came into being in the city of Amit (or,  Amem).  And the Majesty of Ra spake [concerning] this goddess,  [saying], \"Let there be made for her vessels of the beer which  produceth sleep at every holy time and season of the year, and they  shall be in number according to the number of my hand-maidens;\" and  from that early time until now men have been wont to make on the  occasions of the festival of Hathor vessels of the beer which make them  to sleep in number according to the number of the handmaidens of Ra.  And the Majesty of Ra spake unto this goddess, [saying], \"I am smitten  with the pain of the fire of sickness; whence cometh to me [this]  pain?\"  And the Majesty of Ra said, \"I live, but my heart hath become  exceedingly weary[FN#63] with existence with them (i.e., with men); I  have slain [some of] them, but there is a remnant of worthless ones,  for the destruction which I wrought among them was not as great as my  power.\"  Then the gods who were in his following said unto him, \"Be not  overcome by thy inactivity, for thy might is in proportion to thy  will.\"  And the Majesty of this god said unto the Majesty of Nu, \"My  members are weak for (or, as at) the first time; I will not permit this  to come upon me a second time.\"  And the Majesty of the god Nu said, \"O  son Shu, be thou the Eye 'for thy father . . . . . and avenue (?) him,  and 'thou goddess Nut, place him . . . . . ...  And the goddess Nut  said, \"How can this be then, O my father Nu? Hail,\" said Nut . . . . .  to the god Nu, and the goddess straightway became [a cow], and she set  the Majesty of Ra upon [her] back . . . . .  And when these things had  been done, men and women saw the god Ra, upon the back [of the cow].  Then these men and women said, \"Remain with us, and we will overthrow  thine enemies who speak words of blasphemy [against thee.], and  [destroy them].\"  Then his Majesty [Ra] set out for the Great House,  and [the gods who were in the train of Ra remained] with them (i.e.,  the men); during that time the earth was in darkness.  And when the  earth became light [again] and the morning had dawned, the men came  forth with their bows and their [weapons], and they set their arms in  motion to shoot the enemies [of Ra].  Then said the Majesty of this  god, \"Your \"transgressions of violence are placed behind you, for the  slaughtering of the enemies is above the slaughter [of sacrifice];\"  thus came into being the slaughter [of sacrifice].  And the Majesty of  this god said unto Nut, \"I have placed myself upon my back in order to  stretch myself out.\"  What then is the meaning of this?  It meaneth  that he united (?) himself with Nut.  [Thus came into being] . . . . .  Then said the Majesty of this god, \"I am departing from them (i.e.,  from men), and he must come after me who would see me;\" thus came into  being . . . . .

After the sherif had embraced the Wahabi doctrine, his income was  greatly diminished; because Saoud, the chief of the Wahabis, insisted  that the goods of all his followers should pass duty-free, and thus the  greater part of the coffee trade became exempt. I heard from a person  who had means of knowing the truth, and who had no motive for concealing  it from me, that the amount of customs collected at Djidda in 1814 was  four hundred thousand dollars, equal to eight thousand purses, or four  millions of piastres, which would give an annual importation of about  four millions of dollars, a sum certainly below rather than above the  truth. Customs are levied after the same rate at the two gates of the  town, called Bab Mekka and Bab el Medina, upon all provisions coming  from the interior of the country, principally cattle, butter, and dates,  which, in time of peace, when the communication with the interior is  uninterrupted, becomes a matter of importance. Except these, the people  of the town pay no imposts whatever.    [p.50] During my residence, the Turks had made Djidda the principal  depot for their army. A large magazine of corn belonging to the Pasha,  received almost daily supplies from Egypt, and caravans were every day  despatched to Mekka and Tayf; the commerce of the town also was much  increased by the wants of the army and its followers. The police of the  place was well regulated; and the Pasha had given the strictest  injunctions to his troops that they should not commit excesses, as he  well knew that the high-minded Arabians do not so quietly submit to ill-  treatment as the enslaved Egyptians: whenever quarrels happened between  Arabs and Turks, the former generally had the advantage. No avanies (or  wanton act of oppression and injustice) had, under any pretence, been  exercised upon individuals, except in the occupation of a few of the  best houses by the Pasha as lodgings for his wives. The merchants  suffered, however, as in the sherifs time, from the arbitrary rates of  customs, and from the necessity of frequently purchasing all kinds of  merchandize from the Pasha, who, while he was in the Hedjaz, seemed to  be as eager in his mercantile as he was in his military pursuits. But  after an impartial view of the merits and demerits of both governments,  it may be said that the people of Djidda have certainly gained by the  Osmanlys; yet, strange to mention, not an Arab could be found, whether  rich or poor, sincerely attached to his new masters; and the termination  of the sherifs government was universally regretted. This must not be  attributed wholly to the usual levity of a mob, which is found among the  subjects of the Porte, even in a greater degree than among those of any  European nation. The Ottoman governors or Pashas are continually  changing, and every new one becoming a supreme ruler, gives ample cause  for complaints and private hatred and disgust; while their rapid  succession inspires the people with the hope of being soon rid of their  present despot, an event to which they look forward with pleasure, as  the first months of a new governor are generally marked by clemency and  justice.    [p.51] The Arabians are a very proud, high-spirited nation; and this may  be said even of those who inhabit the towns, however corrupted the true  Bedouin character may be among this degenerate race. They despise every  nation that does not speak the Arabic language, or that differs in  manners; they have, besides, been accustomed, for many years, to look  upon Turks as a very inferior people, who, whenever they entered the  Hedjaz, were overawed by the power of the sherif. The rigid ceremonial  of a Turkish court was not adapted to the character and established  notions of Mohammed Alys new subjects. The sherif, in the height of his  power, resembled a great Bedouin Sheikh, who submits to be boldly and  often harshly addressed. A Turkish Pasha is approached with the most  abject forms of servitude. Whenever the Sherif Ghaleb wanted a loan of  money, observed one of the first merchants of the Hedjaz to me, he  sent for three or four of us; we sat in close discourse with him for a  couple of hours, often quarrelling loudly, and we always reduced the sum  to something much less than was at first demanded. When we went to him  on ordinary business, we spoke to him as I now speak to you; but the  Pasha keeps us standing before him in an humble attitude, like so many  Habesh (Abyssinian) slaves, and looks down upon us as if we were beings  of an inferior creation. I would rather, he concluded, pay a fine to  the sherif than receive a favour from the Pasha.    The little knowledge which the Turks possess of the Arabic language,  their bad pronunciation of it even in reciting prayers from the Koran,  the ignorance of Arabia and its peculiarities which they betray in every  act, are so many additional causes to render them hateful or despicable  in the eyes of the Arabs. The Turks return an equal share of contempt  and dislike. Whoever does not speak the language of the Turkish soldier,  or does not dress like one, is considered as a fellah, or boor, a term  which they have been in the habit of applying to the Egyptian peasants,  as beings in the lowest    [p.52] state of servitude and oppression. Their hatred of the Arabian  race is greater, because they cannot indulge their tyrannical  disposition with impunity, as they are accustomed to do in Egypt, being  convinced by experience that an Arabian, when struck, will strike again.  The Arabians particularly accuse the Turks of treachery, in seizing the  sherif and sending him to Turkey after he had declared for the Pasha,  and permitted Djidda and Mekka to be occupied by the Turkish troops,  who, they assert, would never, without the assistance of the sherif,  have been able to make any progress in Arabia, much less to acquire a  firm footing therein.    The term khayn, treacherous, is universally applied to every Turk in  Arabia, with that proud self-confidence of superiority, in this respect,  for which the Arabs are deservedly renowned. The lower classes of the  Arabs have discovered a fanciful confirmation of their charge against  the Turks in one of the Grand Signors titles, Khán, an ancient Tatar  word, which in Arabic signifies he betrayed, being the preterite of  the verb ykhoun, to betray. They pretend that an ancestor of the  Sultan having betrayed a fugitive, received the opprobrious appellation  of el Sultan Khán, (the Sultan has been treacherous;) and that the  title is merely retained by his successors from their ignorance of the  Arabic language.    Whenever the power of the Turks in the Hedjaz declines, which it will  when the resources of Egypt are no longer directed to that point by so  able and so undisturbed a possessor of Egypt as Mohammed Ali, the Arabs  will avenge themselves for the submission, light as it is, which they  now reluctantly yield to their conquerors; and the reign of the Osmanlis  in the Hedjaz will probably terminate in many a scene of bloodshed.    [p.53] ROUTE FROM DJIDDA TO TAYF. [I was unable to take any bearings  during this excursion, as the only compass which I possessed, and which  had served me throughout my Nubian journey, had become useless, and no  opportunity offered of replacing it till December in this year, when I  obtained one from a Bombay ship which arrived at Djidda.]    ON the 24th of August, 1814, (11th of Ramadhán, A.H. 1230.) I set out  from Djidda, late in the evening, with my guide and twenty camel-drivers  of the tribe of Harb, who were carrying money to Mekka for the Pashas  treasury. After having left the skirts of the town, where the road  passes by mounds of sand, among which is the cemetery of the  inhabitants, we travelled across a very barren, sandy plain, ascending  slightly towards the east; there are no trees in it, and it is strongly  impregnated with salt to about two miles from the town. After three  hours march, we entered a hilly country, where a coffee-hut stands near  a well named Ragháme. We continued in a broad and winding valley amongst  these hills, some sandy and some rocky, and, at the end of five hours  and a half, stopped for a short time at the coffee-hut and well called  El Beyádhye. Of these wells the water is not good. From thence, in one  hour and a half, (seven hours in all,) we reached a similar station  called El Feráyne, where we overtook a caravan of pilgrims, who were  accompanying goods and provisions destilled for the army: they had  quitted Djidda before us in the evening. The coffee-huts are miserable  structures, with half-ruined    [p.54] walls, and coverings of brushwood; they afford nothing more than  water and coffee. Formerly, it is said, there were twelve coffee-houses  on this road, which afforded refreshments of every kind to the  passengers between Djidda and the holy city; but as the journey is now  made chiefly during the night, and as the Turkish soldiers will pay for  nothing unless by compulsion, most of these houses have been abandoned.  The few that still remain are kept by some of the Arabs of the Lahyan  tribe, (a branch of the Hodheyl Arabs,) and Metarefe, whose families are  Bedouins, and live among the hills with their flocks. From Ferayne the  valley opens, and the hills, diverging on both sides, increase  considerably in height. At the end of eight hours, about sun-rise we  reached Bahhra, a cluster of about twenty huts, situated upon a plain  nearly four hours in length and two in breadth, extending eastward. At  Bahhra there is plenty of water in wells, some sweet and some brackish.  In a row of eight or ten shops are sold rice, onions, butter, dates, and  coffee-beans, at thirty per cent. in advance of the Djidda market-price.  This is what the Arabs call a souk, or market, and similar places occur  at every station in this chain of mountains as far as Yemen. Some  Turkish"]]]
