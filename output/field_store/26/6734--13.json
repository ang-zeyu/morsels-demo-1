For a normal brain, the PSM must contain only  \"standard models\" (see the general theory and ETAs) because, once a model is  in PSM, it cannot be changed regardless of the information received from  external reality. Even more, any information from external reality can be  accepted only if it can be accepted by PSM.    Example: Let's suppose that in the PSM of a person there is a non-standard  model which considers that the frogs are very dangerous. Regardless of the  information received from external reality, that person will be horrified when  frogs are around.    The content of the PSM is very hard to be known because the PSM is activated  only when there is no normal model to understand the external reality.    The PSM is an image model and it will remain so forever.      EXAMPLES, TESTS AND APPLICATIONS (ETA) ASSOCIATED TO THE MDT THEORY    These ETAs are intergrant parts of MDT and show how it works in some specific  cases. The order of occurence of the subjects is random. MDT tries to keep its  generality as much as possible, independent of the technological  implementation of different brains.    ETA 1: The Model    The model is a collection of elements and relations between the elements.  There are two types of models: image models (or analogic models) and symbolic  models. The elements and relationships are given explicitly for the symbolic  models, and implicitly for the image models.    Image models (analogic) can't be given in an explicit manner. They are given  as they are, as a whole. This is an intrinsic property of the image models.    To give a model in an explcit manner means to describe the elements and the  relationship between the elements, but this takes us outside the analogic  model. That means to translate the image model into a symbolic model (we need  to use words to describe the image model). Even if the translated model is  associated to the image model, it is a different model.    Example: given an image model of an airplane, its elements are the main body,  the wings etc. One of the wings could break in two, so it is made of two  pieces. Actually, it contains an infinity of elements, as it could break in  any way. In any real situation, it is by far easier to build an image model,  than explain what had been built. This is why we say that an image model is  just given as it is, and not defined explicitly. Anytime we refer to an image  model, we need to take into account this fundamental issue.    Application 1:  Image models in poetry and painting    A poet imagines something- there is an image model in his mind. The poet will  translate somehow this image model into several symbolic models (e.g.  statements), trying in fact to associate the image model from his mind to a  collection of symbolic models, materialised in the text of the poem. It is  assumed that the text of the poem, together with other image-type elements  (Rythm, rhyme, intonation etc) will be able to make the reader/listener to  reassemble somehow the initial image model from the poet's mind.    In the case of painting, the painter has in front of him a subject (e.g. a  person). This subject is perceived through all the senses the painter has.  What results is an image model of the subject based on this complex  interaction. This image model from the painter's mind will be translated into  another image model that will show on the canvas. The translation means only  to associate a model to another. The translated model can be built anyhow  within very large limits, based on the complex image model from the painter's  mind. It is supposed here as well, that the viewer will remake somehow as an  image model the initial model from the mind of the painter.    Application 2:  Image models from the external reality    Long time ago, when people needed to build some complex structures (e.g. a  fortress), in the first phase they had to make a sketch of what they intended  to build. This is valid only for less complex constructions. For more  complicated structures, the most used method was to build a 3D model. The  model can be easily analyzed and modified. With the model in sight, the brain  is able to simulate its behaviour for situations associated with the external  reality and to correct the discovered deficiencies, on the model. This model  can be used at the effective building of the external reality.    Nowadays, the image models are very highly developed. E.g. a model built based  on complex specs can be used to simulate its behaviour during an earthquake.  The data obtained can be used to predict the behaviour of the actual building.    The highly developed image models are used on large scale in technology  (skyscrapers, suspension bridges, airplanes, and actually in any complex  technological product). These image models can then be used to simulate  possible situations from external reality, including extreme situations,  before the actual construction of the technological product.    The symbolic models are built using GCL (General Communication Language). They  have explicit elements and relationships. They can be built only by humans.  The most important symbolic model is GCL itself. Its elements are in the first  place the nouns, as the relationship between elements are mainly the verbs.  Contrasting to image models, which evolve based on laws of harmony, symbolic  models evolve based on logic (see general theory). The presence of GCL in a  brain will define that brain as a human brain.    Important note:  GCL is not really a symbolic model. It contains only components (elements and  relationships). Whenever a symbolic model for communication is built (e.g. a  sentence), one needs to choose components from GCL. As any use of GCL is  materialised in a symbolic model and because there is no proper word for it,  GCL is considered by extension a symbolic model.    Technology uses models on a very large scale. Image models have initially been  used, but nowadays, due to the high costs of the image models and for other  reasons, symbolic models and the use of computers are favoured (e.g. symbolic  models are built currently for buildings, suspension bridges, airplanes and  spacecrafts, with the help of computers).    For training purposes, symbolic models are built and used for simulation of  nuclear plants, or flight behaviour, or anything, where it is necessary that  future crew/staff to gain experience beforehand. Present technology is based  in fact almost exclusively on symbolic models.      Application 3: From the iron to the space shuttle    Apparently an iron is too simple to require a design based on a symbolic  model. False.    Let's take a simple technological detail: the holes used for steam exhausts  for moisturising the tissue. Some questions are, e.g. how many holes it needs,  where, what shape and dimensions are needed for uniform moisturising of the  tissue with minimum water consumption and at lowest costs. Clearly, it is  possible to build analogic models, which can be tested experimentally. Based  on the analogic (image) models one can obtain certain results, but there is no  guarantee that the optimal solution was found. The existing image model cannot  be modified, as such. If we want to make any change in the image model we have  to rebuild it from scratch, as we already know, which implies time and money.    The vaporisation and dispersion process of the steam through a complex  structure as the surface of the iron, tissue and the support, is very complex.  Physicists, based on symbolic models, with help of computers, solve this type  of problem. The rebuilding of the model in order to find a better solution is  far simpler on a symbolic model, than on an image model.    If in the case of an iron, the highest risk is that the customers won't buy  the non-performing iron, in other cases the risks involved are unacceptable.    For instance, the space shuttle was 'verified' for reentering the atmosphere  on a symbolic model. This phase of the flight, by far the most dangerous,  would have been impossible to test before the actual flight. The crew was  trained on symbolic models in all the phases of the flight, and in all normal  and exceptional situations. The astronauts have learned to fly for reentering  the atmosphere, based mainly on training on symbolic models.    Given a model (image or symbolic), it can be used to predict its further  evolution. This is achieved by changing/ adding/ removing a parameter/  element/ relationship and following what happens. This process is called  simulation on the model. As we know, the results of the simulation on the  model are called truths associated to the model.    When a model is associated to external reality, by simulating on the model, we  can predict the evolution of the external reality. These operations are done  either by the human (image and symbolic) or the animal brains (image models  only).    We need to note here- it is as important, as it looks trivial: We extend to  the external reality the structure of symbolic and image models from our  brain. This extension is done not only in the domain of science and  technology, but also in all domains of life. For each of us, the world itself  is given as a sum of all the projections to external reality of all the active  models of the brain. This statement is true for animals as well.    Example: The laws voted in the parliament are long-range symbolic models; they  are an extension of the structure of models from the brains of the authors of  the laws.    The prediction of the evolution of external reality (see general theory) is  the main requirement of design for the human or animal brain. Thus, this  requirement is fulfilled by the facility of the brain to build and operate  models.      ETA 2: Truth, reality, and communication    Any result of the simulation on a model is a truth associated to that model.

MEPHISTOPHELES (_to_ FAUST)    My friend, take proper heed, I pray!  To manage witches, this is just the way.    THE WITCH    Wherein, Sirs, can I be of use?

'Tis all the same: the book I can repeat,  Such time I've squandered o'er the history:  A contradiction thus complete  Is always for the wise, no less than fools, a mystery.

The noble indolence I'll teach thee then to treasure,  And soon thou'lt be aware, with keenest thrills of pleasure,  How Cupid stirs and leaps, on light and restless wing.    FAUST    One rapid glance within the mirror give me,  How beautiful that woman-form!    MEPHISTOPHELES    No, no!

(MEPHISTOPHELES _enters_)    FAUST    Hear, of that girl I'd have possession!    MEPHISTOPHELES    Which, then?    FAUST    The one who just went by.    MEPHISTOPHELES    She, there? She's coming from confession,  Of every sin absolved; for I,  Behind her chair, was listening nigh.  So innocent is she, indeed,  That to confess she had no need.  I have no power o'er souls so green.    FAUST    And yet, she's older than fourteen.    MEPHISTOPHELES    How now! You're talking like Jack Rake,  Who every flower for himself would take,  And fancies there are no favors more,  Nor honors, save for him in store;  Yet always doesn't the thing succeed.

I need, at least, a fortnight's space,  To find an opportune occasion.    FAUST    Had I but seven hours for all,  I should not on the Devil call,  But win her by my own persuasion.    MEPHISTOPHELES    You almost like a Frenchman prate;  Yet, pray, don't take it as annoyance!  Why, all at once, exhaust the joyance?  Your bliss is by no means so great  As if you'd use, to get control,  All sorts of tender rigmarole,  And knead and shape her to your thought,  As in Italian tales 'tis taught.    FAUST    Without that, I have appetite.    MEPHISTOPHELES    But now, leave jesting out of sight!  I tell you, once for all, that speed  With this fair girl will not succeed;  By storm she cannot captured be;  We must make use of strategy.    FAUST    Get me something the angel keeps!  Lead me thither where she sleeps!  Get me a kerchief from her breast,--  A garter that her knee has pressed!    MEPHISTOPHELES    That you may see how much I'd fain  Further and satisfy your pain,  We will no longer lose a minute;  I'll find her room to-day, and take you in it.    FAUST    And shall I see--possess her?    MEPHISTOPHELES    No!  Unto a neighbor she must go,  And meanwhile thou, alone, mayst glow  With every hope of future pleasure,  Breathing her atmosphere in fullest measure.    FAUST    Can we go thither?    MEPHISTOPHELES    'Tis too early yet.    FAUST    A gift for her I bid thee get!  [_Exit_.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Presents at once? That's good: he's certain to get at her!
