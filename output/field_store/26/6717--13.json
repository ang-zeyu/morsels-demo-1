I've only just had lunch, you  know.\"    \"Oh, Cyril, that can't be true! It's after four,\" cried Josephine.  Constantia sat with her knife poised over the chocolate-roll.    \"It is, all the same,\" said Cyril. \"I had to meet a man at Victoria, and  he kept me hanging about till... there was only time to get lunch and  to come on here. And he gave me--phew\"--Cyril put his hand to his  forehead--\"a terrific blow-out,\" he said.    It was disappointing--to-day of all days. But still he couldn't be  expected to know.    \"But you'll have a meringue, won't you, Cyril?\" said Aunt Josephine.  \"These meringues were bought specially for you. Your dear father was so  fond of them. We were sure you are, too.\"    \"I am, Aunt Josephine,\" cried Cyril ardently. \"Do you mind if I take  half to begin with?\"    \"Not at all, dear boy; but we mustn't let you off with that.\"    \"Is your dear father still so fond of meringues?\" asked Auntie Con  gently. She winced faintly as she broke through the shell of hers.    \"Well, I don't quite know, Auntie Con,\" said Cyril breezily.    At that they both looked up.    \"Don't know?\" almost snapped Josephine. \"Don't know a thing like that  about your own father, Cyril?\"    \"Surely,\" said Auntie Con softly.    Cyril tried to laugh it off. \"Oh, well,\" he said, \"it's such a long time  since--\" He faltered. He stopped. Their faces were too much for him.    \"Even so,\" said Josephine.    And Auntie Con looked.    Cyril put down his teacup. \"Wait a bit,\" he cried. \"Wait a bit, Aunt  Josephine. What am I thinking of?\"    He looked up. They were beginning to brighten. Cyril slapped his knee.    \"Of course,\" he said, \"it was meringues. How could I have forgotten?  Yes, Aunt Josephine, you're perfectly right. Father's most frightfully  keen on meringues.\"    They didn't only beam. Aunt Josephine went scarlet with pleasure; Auntie  Con gave a deep, deep sigh.    \"And now, Cyril, you must come and see father,\" said Josephine. \"He  knows you were coming to-day.\"    \"Right,\" said Cyril, very firmly and heartily. He got up from his chair;  suddenly he glanced at the clock.    \"I say, Auntie Con, isn't your clock a bit slow? I've got to meet a man  at--at Paddington just after five. I'm afraid I shan't be able to stay  very long with grandfather.\"    \"Oh, he won't expect you to stay very long!\" said Aunt Josephine.    Constantia was still gazing at the clock. She couldn't make up her mind  if it was fast or slow. It was one or the other, she felt almost certain  of that. At any rate, it had been.    Cyril still lingered. \"Aren't you coming along, Auntie Con?\"    \"Of course,\" said Josephine, \"we shall all go. Come on, Con.\"      Chapter 3.IX.    They knocked at the door, and Cyril followed his aunts into  grandfather's hot, sweetish room.    \"Come on,\" said Grandfather Pinner. \"Don't hang about. What is it?  What've you been up to?\"    He was sitting in front of a roaring fire, clasping his stick. He had a  thick rug over his knees. On his lap there lay a beautiful pale yellow  silk handkerchief.    \"It's Cyril, father,\" said Josephine shyly. And she took Cyril's hand  and led him forward.    \"Good afternoon, grandfather,\" said Cyril, trying to take his hand out  of Aunt Josephine's. Grandfather Pinner shot his eyes at Cyril in the  way he was famous for. Where was Auntie Con? She stood on the other side  of Aunt Josephine; her long arms hung down in front of her; her hands  were clasped. She never took her eyes off grandfather.    \"Well,\" said Grandfather Pinner, beginning to thump, \"what have you got  to tell me?\"    What had he, what had he got to tell him? Cyril felt himself smiling  like a perfect imbecile. The room was stifling, too.    But Aunt Josephine came to his rescue. She cried brightly, \"Cyril says  his father is still very fond of meringues, father dear.\"    \"Eh?\" said Grandfather Pinner, curving his hand like a purple  meringue-shell over one ear.    Josephine repeated, \"Cyril says his father is still very fond of  meringues.\"    \"Can't hear,\" said old Colonel Pinner. And he waved Josephine away with  his stick, then pointed with his stick to Cyril. \"Tell me what she's  trying to say,\" he said.    (My God!) \"Must I?\" said Cyril, blushing and staring at Aunt Josephine.    \"Do, dear,\" she smiled. \"It will please him so much.\"    \"Come on, out with it!\" cried Colonel Pinner testily, beginning to thump  again.    And Cyril leaned forward and yelled, \"Father's still very fond of  meringues.\"    At that Grandfather Pinner jumped as though he had been shot.    \"Don't shout!\" he cried. \"What's the matter with the boy? Meringues!  What about 'em?\"    \"Oh, Aunt Josephine, must we go on?\" groaned Cyril desperately.    \"It's quite all right, dear boy,\" said Aunt Josephine, as though he and  she were at the dentist's together. \"He'll understand in a minute.\" And  she whispered to Cyril, \"He's getting a bit deaf, you know.\" Then she  leaned forward and really bawled at Grandfather Pinner, \"Cyril only  wanted to tell you, father dear, that his father is still very fond of  meringues.\"    Colonel Pinner heard that time, heard and brooded, looking Cyril up and  down.    \"What an esstrordinary thing!\" said old Grandfather Pinner. \"What an  esstrordinary thing to come all this way here to tell me!\"    And Cyril felt it was.    \"Yes, I shall send Cyril the watch,\" said Josephine.    \"That would be very nice,\" said Constantia. \"I seem to remember last  time he came there was some little trouble about the time.\"      Chapter 3.X.    They were interrupted by Kate bursting through the door in her usual  fashion, as though she had discovered some secret panel in the wall.    \"Fried or boiled?\" asked the bold voice.    Fried or boiled? Josephine and Constantia were quite bewildered for the  moment. They could hardly take it in.    \"Fried or boiled what, Kate?\" asked Josephine, trying to begin to  concentrate.    Kate gave a loud sniff. \"Fish.\"    \"Well, why didn't you say so immediately?\" Josephine reproached her  gently. \"How could you expect us to understand, Kate? There are a great  many things in this world you know, which are fried or boiled.\" And  after such a display of courage she said quite brightly to Constantia,  \"Which do you prefer, Con?\"    \"I think it might be nice to have it fried,\" said Constantia. \"On the  other hand, of course, boiled fish is very nice. I think I prefer both  equally well... Unless you... In that case--\"    \"I shall fry it,\" said Kate, and she bounced back, leaving their door  open and slamming the door of her kitchen.    Josephine gazed at Constantia; she raised her pale eyebrows until they  rippled away into her pale hair. She got up. She said in a very  lofty, imposing way, \"Do you mind following me into the drawing-room,  Constantia? I've got something of great importance to discuss with you.\"    For it was always to the drawing-room they retired when they wanted to  talk over Kate.    Josephine closed the door meaningly. \"Sit down, Constantia,\" she said,  still very grand. She might have been receiving Constantia for the  first time. And Con looked round vaguely for a chair, as though she felt  indeed quite a stranger.    \"Now the question is,\" said Josephine, bending forward, \"whether we  shall keep her or not.\"    \"That is the question,\" agreed Constantia.    \"And this time,\" said Josephine firmly, \"we must come to a definite  decision.\"    Constantia looked for a moment as though she might begin going over all  the other times, but she pulled herself together and said, \"Yes, Jug.\"    \"You see, Con,\" explained Josephine, \"everything is so changed now.\"  Constantia looked up quickly. \"I mean,\" went on Josephine, \"we're not  dependent on Kate as we were.\" And she blushed faintly. \"There's not  father to cook for.\"    \"That is perfectly true,\" agreed Constantia. \"Father certainly doesn't  want any cooking now, whatever else--\"    Josephine broke in sharply, \"You're not sleepy, are you, Con?\"    \"Sleepy, Jug?\" Constantia was wide-eyed.    \"Well, concentrate more,\" said Josephine sharply, and she returned  to the subject. \"What it comes to is, if we did\"--and this she barely  breathed, glancing at the door--\"give Kate notice\"--she raised her voice  again--\"we could manage our own food.\"    \"Why not?\" cried Constantia. She couldn't help smiling. The idea was so  exciting. She clasped her hands. \"What should we live on, Jug?\"    \"Oh, eggs in various forms!\" said Jug, lofty again. \"And, besides, there  are all the cooked foods.\"    \"But I've always heard,\" said Constantia, \"they are considered so very  expensive.\"    \"Not if one buys them in moderation,\" said Josephine. But she tore  herself away from this fascinating bypath and dragged Constantia after  her.    \"What we've got to decide now, however, is whether we really do trust  Kate or not.\"    Constantia leaned back. Her flat little laugh flew from her lips.    \"Isn't it curious, Jug,\" said she, \"that just on this one subject I've  never been able to quite make up my mind?\"      Chapter 3.XI.    She never had. The whole difficulty was to prove anything. How did one  prove things, how could one? Suppose Kate had stood in front of her  and deliberately made a face. Mightn't she very well have been in pain?  Wasn't it impossible, at any rate, to ask Kate if she was making a face  at her? If Kate answered \"No\"--and, of course, she would say \"No\"--what  a position! How undignified! Then again Constantia suspected, she was  almost certain that Kate went to her chest of drawers when she and  Josephine were out, not to take things but to spy. Many times she had  come back to find her amethyst cross in the most unlikely places, under  her lace ties or on top of her evening Bertha. More than once she had  laid a trap for Kate. She had arranged things in a special order and  then called Josephine to witness.    \"You see, Jug?\"    \"Quite, Con.\"    \"Now we shall be able to tell.\"  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14291"],[0,"The Story of Geographical Discovery: How the World Became Known (#14)"],[1,"land  which he took possession of in the name of Portugal, and named Santa  Cruz. The actual cross which he erected on this occasion is still  preserved in Brazil, for Cabral had touched upon the land now known  by that name. It is true that one of Columbus's companions, Pinzon,  had already touched upon the coast of Brazil before Cabral, but it  is evident from his experience that, even apart from Columbus, the  Portuguese would have discovered the New World sooner or later. It  is, however, to be observed that in stating this, as all historians  do, they leave out of account the fact that, but for Columbus,  sailors would still have continued the old course of coasting along  the shore, by which they would never have left the Old World. Cabral  lost several of his ships and many of his men, and, though he brought  home a rich cargo, was not regarded as successful, and Vasco da  Gama was again sent out with a large fleet in 1502, with which  he conquered the Zamorin of Calicut and obtained rich treasures.  In subsidiary voyages the Portuguese navigators discovered the  islands of St. Helena, Ascension, the Seychelles, Socotra, Tristan  da Cunha, the Maldives, and Madagascar.    Meanwhile King Emmanuel was adopting the Venetian method of  colonisation, which consisted in sending a Vice-Doge to each of  its colonies for a term of two years, during which his duty was to  encourage trade and to collect tribute. In a similar way, Emmanuel  appointed a Viceroy for his Eastern trade, and in 1505 Almeida  had settled in Ceylon, with a view to monopolising the cinnamon  trade of that place.    [Illustration: PORTUGUESE INDIES]    But the greatest of the Portuguese viceroys was Affonso de Albuquerque,  who captured the important post of Goa, on the mainland of India,  which still belongs to Portugal, and the port of Ormuz, which,  we have seen, was one of the centres of the Eastern trade. Even  more important was the capture of the Moluccas, or Spice Islands,  which were discovered in 1511, after the Portuguese had seized  Malacca. By 1521 the Portuguese had full possession of the Spice  Islands, and thus held the trade of condiments entirely in their  own hands. The result was seen soon in the rise of prices in the  European markets. Whereas at the end of the fifteenth century pepper,  for instance, was about 17s. a pound, from 1521 and onwards its  average price grew to be 25s., and so with almost all the ingredients  by which food could be made more tasty. One of the circumstances,  however, which threw the monopoly into the hands of the Portuguese  was the seizure of Egypt in 1521 by the Turks under Selim I., which  would naturally derange the course of trade from its old route  through Alexandria. From the Moluccas easy access was found to  China, and ultimately to Japan, so that the Portuguese for a time  held in their hands the whole of the Eastern trade, on which Europe  depended for most of its luxuries.    As we shall see, the Portuguese only won by a neck--if we may use  a sporting expression--in the race for the possession of the Spice  Islands. In the very year they obtained possession of them, Magellan,  on his way round the world, had reached the Philippines, within a  few hundred miles of them, and his ship, the _Victoria_, actually  sailed through them that year. In fact, 1521 is a critical year in  the discovery of the world, for both the Spanish and Portuguese  (the two nations who had attempted to reach the Indies eastward and  westward) arrived at the goal of their desires, the Spice Islands,  in that same year, while the closure of Egypt to commerce occurred  opportunely to divert the trade into the hands of the Portuguese.  Finally, the year 1521 was signalised by the death of King Emmanuel  of Portugal, under whose auspices the work of Prince Henry the  Navigator was completed.    It must here be observed that we are again anticipating matters. As  soon as the discovery of the New World was announced, the Pope was  appealed to, to determine the relative shares of Spain and Portugal  in the discoveries which would clearly follow upon Columbus's voyage.  By his Bull, dated 4th May 1493, Alexander VI. granted all discoveries  to the west to Spain, leaving it to be understood that all to the  east belonged to Portugal. The line of demarcation was an imaginary  one drawn from pole to pole, and passing one hundred leagues west  of the Azores and Cape Verde Islands, which were supposed, in the  inaccurate geography of the time, to be in the same meridian. In  the following year the Portuguese monarch applied for a revision  of the _raya_, as this would keep him out of all discovered in  the New World altogether; and the line of demarcation was then  shifted 270 leagues westward, or altogether 1110 miles west of  the Cape Verdes. By a curious coincidence, within six years Cabral  had discovered Brazil, which fell within the angle thus cut off by  the _raya_ from South America. Or was it entirely a coincidence?  May not Cabral have been directed to take this unusually westward  course in order to ascertain if any land fell within the Portuguese  claims? When, however, the Spice Islands were discovered, it remained  to be discussed whether the line of demarcation, when continued  on the other side of the globe, brought them within the Spanish  or Portuguese \"sphere of influence,\" as we should say nowadays.  By a curious chance they happened to be very near the line, and,  with the inaccurate maps of the period, a pretty subject of quarrel  was afforded between the Portuguese and Spanish commissioners who  met at Badajos to determine the question. This was left undecided  by the Junta, but by a family compact, in 1529, Charles V. ceded  to his brother-in-law, the King of Portugal, any rights he might  have to the Moluccas, for the sum of 350,000 gold ducats, while  he himself retained the Philippines, which have been Spanish ever  since.    By this means the Indian Ocean became, for all trade purposes, a  Portuguese lake throughout the sixteenth century, as will be seen  from the preceding map, showing the trading stations of the Portuguese  all along the shores of the ocean. But they only possessed their  monopoly for fifty years, for in 1580 the Spanish and Portuguese  crowns became united on the head of Philip II., and by the time  Portugal recovered its independence, in 1640, serious rivals had  arisen to compete with her and Spain for the monopoly of the Eastern  trade.    [_Authorities_: Major, _Prince Henry the Navigator_, 1869; Beazeley,  _Prince Henry the Navigator_, 1895; F. Hummerich, _Vasco da Gama_,  1896.]          CHAPTER VII    TO THE INDIES WESTWARD--THE SPANISH ROUTE--COLUMBUS AND MAGELLAN    While the Portuguese had, with slow persistency, devoted nearly a  century to carrying out Prince Henry's idea of reaching the Indies  by the eastward route, a bold yet simple idea had seized upon a  Genoese sailor, which was intended to achieve the same purpose by  sailing westward. The ancients, as we have seen, had recognised  the rotundity of the earth, and Eratosthenes had even recognised  the possibility of reaching India by sailing westward. Certain  traditions of the Greeks and the Irish had placed mysterious islands  far out to the west in the Atlantic, and the great philosopher  Plato had imagined a country named Atlantis, far out in the Indian  Ocean, where men were provided with all the gifts of nature. These  views of the ancients came once more to the attention of the learned,  owing to the invention of printing and the revival of learning,  when the Greek masterpieces began to be made accessible in Latin,  chiefly by fugitive Greeks from Constantinople, which had been  taken by the Turks in 1453. Ptolemy's geography was printed at  Rome in 1462, and with maps in 1478. But even without the maps  the calculation which he had made of the length of the known world  tended to shorten the distance between Portugal and Farther India  by 2500 miles. Since his time the travels of Marco Polo had added  to the knowledge of Europe the vast extent of Cathay and the distant  islands of Zipangu (Japan), which would again reduce the distance  by another 1500 miles. As the Greek geographers had somewhat  under-estimated the whole circuit of the globe, it would thus seem  that Zipangu was not more than 4000 miles to the west of Portugal.  As the Azores were considered to be much farther off from the coast  than they really were, it might easily seem, to an enthusiastic  mind, that Farther India might be reached when 3000 miles of the  ocean had been traversed.    [Illustration: TOSCANELLI'S MAP (_restored_)]    This was the notion that seized the mind of Christopher Columbus,  born at Genoa in 1446, of humble parentage, his father being a  weaver. He seems to have obtained sufficient knowledge to enable  him to study the works of the learned, and of the ancients in Latin  translations. But in his early years he devoted his attention to  obtaining a practical acquaintance with seamanship. In his day, as  we have seen, Portugal was the centre of geographical knowledge,  and he and his brother Bartolomeo, after many voyages north and  south, settled at last in Lisbon--his brother as a map-maker, and  himself as a practical seaman. This was about the year 1473, and  shortly afterwards he married Felipa Moniz, daughter of Bartolomeo  Perestrello, an Italian in the service of the King of Portugal,  and for some time Governor of Madeira.    Now it chanced just at this time that there was a rumour in Portugal  that a certain Italian philosopher, named Toscanelli, had put forth  views as to the possibility of a westward voyage to Cathay, or  China, and the Portuguese king had, through a monk named Martinez,  applied to Toscanelli to know his views, which were given in a letter  dated 25th June 1474. It would appear that, quite independently,  Columbus had heard the rumour, and applied to Toscanelli, for in "]]]
