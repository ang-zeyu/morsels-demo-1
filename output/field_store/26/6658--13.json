The inhumanity  and cruel circumstances of it did indeed in some degree affect this  malefactor himself, but he seemed much more disturbed with the  apprehension of being hanged in chains, a thing which from the weakness  of vulgar minds terrifies more than death itself, and the use of which I  confess I do not see, since it serves only to render the poor wretches  uneasy in their last moments, and instead of making suitable impressions  on the minds of the spectators, affords a pretence for servants and  other young persons to idle away their time in going to see the body so  exposed on a gibbet.    At the place of execution, Clark was extremely careful to inform the  people that he was so far from having any malice against the woman whom  he murdered that he really had a love for her. A report, too, of his  having designed to sell the young girl he had brought out of the country  into Virginia had weight enough with him to occasion his solemn denying  of it at the tree, though he acknowledged at the same time that he had  resolved to leave her. He declared also, to prevent any aspersions on  some young men who had been his companions, that no person was ever  present with, or privy to any of the robberies he had committed; and  having thus far discharged his conscience, he suffered on the 28th of  July, 1721, in the twenty-fourth year of his age.          The Life of JOHN WINSHIP, Highwayman and Footpad      That idleness in which youths are suffered to live in this kingdom till  they are grown to that size at which they are usually put apprentice (a  space of time in which they are much better employed, in many other  countries of Europe) too often creates an inaptitude to work and allows  them opportunity of entering into paths which have a fatal termination.    John Winship, of whom we are now to treat, was born of parents in  tolerable circumstances in the parish of St. Paul's, Covent Garden. They  gave him an education rather superior to his condition, and treated him  with an indulgence by which his future life became unhappy. At about  fourteen, they placed him as an apprentice with a carpenter, to which  trade he himself had a liking. His master used him as well as he could  have expected or wished, yet that inclination to idleness and loitering  which he had contracted while a boy, made him incapable of pursuing his  business with tolerable application. The particular accident by which he  was determined to leave it shall be the next point in our relation.    It happened that returning one day from work, he took notice of a young  woman standing at a door in a street not far distant from that in which  his master lived. He was then about seventeen, and imagining love to be  a very fine thing, thought fit, without further enquiry, to make this  young woman the object of his affection. The next evening he took  occasion to speak to her, and this acquaintance soon improving into  frequent appointments, naturally led Winship into much greater expenses  than he was able to support. This had two consequences equally fatal to  this unhappy young man, for in the first place he left his master and  his trade, and took to driving of coaches and like methods, to get his  bread; but all the ways he could think of, proving unable to supply his  expenses, he went next upon the road, and raised daily contributions in  as illegal a manner as they were spent at night, in all the excesses of  vice.    It is impossible to give either a particular or exact account of the  robberies he committed, because he was always very reserved, even after  conviction, in speaking as to these points.    However, he is said to have been concerned in robbing a Frenchman of  quality in the road to Hampstead, who in a two-horsed chaise, with the  coachman on his box, was attacked in the dusk of the evening by three  highwaymen. They exchanged several pistols and continued the fight,  till, the ammunition on both sides being exhausted, the foreigner  prepared to defend himself with his sword. The rogues were almost out of  all hopes of obtaining their booty, when one of them getting behind the  chaise secretly cut a square hole in its back, and putting in both his  arms, seized the gentleman so strongly about the shoulders that his  companions had an opportunity of closing in with him, disarming him of  his sword, rifling and taking a hundred and twenty pistoles. Not  content with this they ripped the lace off his clothes, and took from  the coachmen all the money he had about him.    Winship had been concerned in divers gangs, and being a fellow of  uncommon agility of body, was mighty well received and much caressed by  them, as was also another companion of his, whom they called  Clean-Limbed Tom, whose true name was never known, being killed in a  duel at Kilkenny in Ireland. This last mentioned person had been bred  with an apothecary, and sometimes travelled the country in the high  capacity of a quack doctor, at others, in the more humble station of a  merry-andrew. Travelling once down into the west, with a little chest of  medicines which he intended to dispose of in this matter at West  Chester, at an inn about twenty miles short of that city he overtook a  London wholesale dealer, who had been that way collecting debts. Tom  made a shift to get into his company overnight, and diverted him so much  with his facetious conversation that he invited him to breakfast with  him the next morning. Tom took occasion to put a strong purge into the  ale and toast which the Londoner was drinking, he himself pretending  never to take anything in the morning but a glass of wine and bitters.  When the stranger got on horseback, Tom offered to accompany him, _For_,  says he, _I can easily walk as fast as your horse will trot._ They had  not got above two miles before, at the entrance of a common, the physic  began to work. The tradesman alighting to untruss a point, Tom leaped at  once into his saddle, and galloped off both with his horse and  portmanteau. He baited an hour at a small village three miles beyond  Chester, having avoided passing through that city, then continued his  journey to Port Patrick, from whence he crossed to Dublin with about  four score pounds in ready money, a gold watch, which was put up in a  corner of a cloak bag, linen, and other things to a considerable value  besides.    But to return to Winship. His robberies were so numerous that he began  to be very well known and much sought after by those who make it their  business to bring men to justice for rewards. There is some reason to  believe that he had been once condemned and received mercy. However, on  the 25th of May, 1721, he stopped one Mr. Lowther in his chariot,  between Pancras Church and the Halfway House, and robbed him of his  silver watch and a purse of ten guineas; for which robbery being quickly  after apprehended, he was convicted at the Old Bailey, on the evidence  of the prosecutor and the voluntary information of one of his  companions.    While he lay under sentence, he could not help expressing a great  impatience at the miserable condition to which his follies had reduced  him, and at the same time to show the most earnest desire of life,  though it were upon the terms of transportation for the whole  continuance of it; though he frequently declared it did not arise so  much from a willingness in himself to continue in this world, as at the  grief he felt for the misfortunes of his aged mother, who was ready to  run distracted at her son's unhappy fate.    As he was a very personable young man strangers, especially at chapel,  took particular notice of him, and were continually inquiring of his  adventures; but Winship not only constantly refused to give them any  satisfaction, but declared also to the Ordinary that he did not think  himself obliged to make any discoveries which might affect the lives of  others, showing also an extraordinary uneasiness whenever such questions  were put to him. When he was asked, by the direction of a person of some  rank, whether he did not rob a person dressed in such a manner in a  chaise as he was watering his horse before the church door, during the  time of Divine service, Winship replied, he supposed the crime did not  consist in the time or place, and as to whether he was guilty of it or  no, he would tell nothing.    In other respects he appeared penitent and devout, suffering at Tyburn  at the same time with the afore-mentioned Matthew Clark, in the  twenty-second year of his age, leaving behind him a wife, who died  afterwards with grief for his execution.          The Life of JOHN MEFF, _alias_ MERTH, a Housebreaker and a Highwayman      The rigid execution of felons who return from transportation has been  found so necessary that few or none who have been tried for such illegal  returning have escaped, though 'tis very hard to convince those who  suffer for that offence that there is any real crime in their evading  their sentence. It was this which brought John Meff, _alias_ Merth, of  whom we are now to speak, to an ignominious death, after he had once  before escaped it in a very extraordinary manner, as in the process of  his story shall be related.    This unhappy man was born in London of French parents, who retired into  England for the sake of their religion, when Louis XIV began his furious  persecution against the Protestants in his dominions. This John Meff  was educated with great care, especially as to the principles of  religion, by a father who had very just"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13102"],[0,"The Decameron, Volume II (#14)"],[1," of my sufferings, for which she took not  blame to herself, but merit, was likewise condemned to the pains of hell.  Nor had she sooner made her descent, than for her pain and mine 'twas  ordained, that she should flee before me, and that I, who so loved her,  should pursue her, not as my beloved lady, but as my mortal enemy, and  so, as often as I come up with her, I slay her with this same rapier with  which I slew myself, and having ripped her up by the back, I take out  that hard and cold heart, to which neither love nor pity had ever access,  and therewith her other inward parts, as thou shalt forthwith see, and  cast them to these dogs to eat. And in no long time, as the just and  mighty God decrees, she rises even as if she had not died, and  recommences her dolorous flight, I and the dogs pursuing her. And it so  falls out that every Friday about this hour I here come up with her, and  slaughter her as thou shalt see; but ween not that we rest on other days;  for there are other places in which I overtake her, places in which she  used, or devised how she might use, me cruelly; on which wise, changed as  thou seest from her lover into her foe, I am to pursue her for years as  many as the months during which she shewed herself harsh to me. Wherefore  leave me to execute the decree of the Divine justice, and presume not to  oppose that which thou mayst not avail to withstand.\"    Affrighted by the knight's words, insomuch that there was scarce a hair  on his head but stood on end, Nastagio shrank back, still gazing on the  hapless damsel, and waited all a tremble to see what the knight would do.  Nor had he long to wait; for the knight, as soon as he had done speaking,  sprang, rapier in hand, like a mad dog upon the damsel, who, kneeling,  while the two mastiffs gripped her tightly, cried him mercy; but the  knight, thrusting with all his force, struck her between the breasts, and  ran her clean through the body. Thus stricken, the damsel fell forthwith  prone on the ground sobbing and shrieking: whereupon the knight drew  forth a knife, and having therewith opened her in the back, took out the  heart and all the circumjacent parts, and threw them to the two mastiffs,  who, being famished, forthwith devoured them. And in no long time the  damsel, as if nought thereof had happened, started to her feet, and took  to flight towards the sea, pursued, and ever and anon bitten, by the  dogs, while the knight, having gotten him to horse again, followed them  as before, rapier in hand; and so fast sped they that they were quickly  lost to Nastagio's sight.    Long time he stood musing on what he had seen, divided between pity and  terror, and then it occurred to him that, as this passed every Friday, it  might avail him not a little. So, having marked the place, he rejoined  his servants, and in due time thereafter sent for some of his kinsfolk  and friends, and said to them:--\"'Tis now a long while that you urge me  to give up loving this lady that is no friend to me, and therewith make  an end of my extravagant way of living; and I am now ready so to do,  provided you procure me one favour, to wit, that next Friday Messer Paolo  Traversaro, and his wife and daughter, and all the ladies, their  kinswomen, and as many other ladies as you may be pleased to bid, come  hither to breakfast with me: when you will see for yourselves the reason  why I so desire.\" A small matter this seemed to them; and so, on their  return to Ravenna, they lost no time in conveying Nastagio's message to  his intended guests: and, albeit she was hardly persuaded, yet in the end  the damsel that Nastagio loved came with the rest.    Nastagio caused a lordly breakfast to be prepared, and had the tables set  under the pines about the place where he had witnessed the slaughter of  the cruel lady; and in ranging the ladies and gentlemen at table he so  ordered it, that the damsel whom he loved was placed opposite the spot  where it should be enacted. The last course was just served, when the  despairing cries of the hunted damsel became audible to all, to their no  small amazement; and each asking, and none knowing, what it might import,  up they all started intent to see what was toward; and perceived the  suffering damsel, and the knight and the dogs, who in a trice were in  their midst. They hollaed amain to dogs and knight, and not a few  advanced to succour the damsel: but the words of the knight, which were  such as he had used to Nastagio, caused them to fall back,  terror-stricken and lost in amazement. And when the knight proceeded to  do as he had done before, all the ladies that were there, many of whom  were of kin to the suffering damsel and to the knight, and called to mind  his love and death, wept as bitterly as if 'twere their own case.    When 'twas all over, and the lady and the knight had disappeared, the  strange scene set those that witnessed it pondering many and divers  matters: but among them all none was so appalled as the cruel damsel that  Nastagio loved, who, having clearly seen and heard all that had passed,  and being ware that it touched her more nearly than any other by reason  of the harshness that she had ever shewn to Nastagio, seemed already to  be fleeing from her angered lover, and to have the mastiffs on her  flanks. And so great was her terror that, lest a like fate should befall  her, she converted her aversion into affection, and as soon as occasion  served, which was that very night, sent a trusty chambermaid privily to  Nastagio with a request that he would be pleased to come to her, for that  she was ready in all respects to pleasure him to the full. Nastagio made  answer that he was greatly flattered, but that he was minded with her  consent to have his pleasure of her in an honourable way, to wit, by  marrying her. The damsel, who knew that none but herself was to blame  that she was not already Nastagio's wife, made answer that she consented.  Wherefore by her own mouth she acquainted her father and mother that she  agreed to marry Nastagio; and, they heartily approving her choice,  Nastagio wedded her on the ensuing Sunday, and lived happily with her  many a year. Nor was it in her instance alone that this terror was  productive of good: on the contrary, it so wrought among the ladies of  Ravenna that they all became, and have ever since been, much more  compliant with men's desires than they had been wont to be.      NOVEL IX.    --  Federigo degli Alberighi loves and is not loved in return: he wastes his  substance by lavishness until nought is left but a single falcon, which,  his lady being come to see him at his house, he gives her to eat: she,  knowing his case, changes her mind, takes him to husband and makes him  rich.  --    So ended Filomena; and the queen, being ware that besides herself only  Dioneo (by virtue of his privilege) was left to speak, said with gladsome  mien:--'Tis now for me to take up my parable; which, dearest ladies, I  will do with a story like in some degree to the foregoing, and that, not  only that you may know how potent are your charms to sway the gentle  heart, but that you may also learn how upon fitting occasions to make  bestowal of your guerdons of your own accord, instead of always waiting  for the guidance of Fortune, which most times, not wisely, but without  rule or measure, scatters her gifts.    You are then to know, that Coppo di Borghese Domenichi, a man that in our  day was, and perchance still is, had in respect and great reverence in  our city, being not only by reason of his noble lineage, but, and yet  more, for manners and merit most illustrious and worthy of eternal  renown, was in his old age not seldom wont to amuse himself by  discoursing of things past with his neighbours and other folk; wherein he  had not his match for accuracy and compass of memory and concinnity of  speech. Among other good stories, he would tell, how that there was of  yore in Florence a gallant named Federigo di Messer Filippo Alberighi,  who for feats of arms and courtesy had not his peer in Tuscany; who, as  is the common lot of gentlemen, became enamoured of a lady named Monna  Giovanna, who in her day held rank among the fairest and most elegant  ladies of Florence; to gain whose love he jousted, tilted, gave  entertainments, scattered largess, and in short set no bounds to his  expenditure. However the lady, no less virtuous than fair, cared not a  jot for what he did for her sake, nor yet for him.    Spending thus greatly beyond his means, and making nothing, Federigo  could hardly fail to come to lack, and was at length reduced to such  poverty that he had nothing left but a little estate, on the rents of  which he lived very straitly, and a single falcon, the best in the world.  The estate was at Campi, and thither, deeming it no longer possible for  him to live in the city as he desired, he repaired, more in love than  ever before; and there, in complete seclusion, diverting himself with  hawking, he bore his poverty as patiently as he might.    Now, Federigo being thus reduced to extreme poverty, it so happened that  one day Monna Giovanna's husband, who was very rich, fell ill, and,  seeing that he was nearing his end, made his will, whereby he left his  estate to his son, who was now growing up, and in the event of his death  without lawful heir named Monna Giovanna, whom he dearly loved, heir in  his stead; and having made these dispositions he died.    Monna Giovanna, being thus left a widow, did as our ladies are wont, and  repaired in the summer to one of her estates in the country which lay  very near to that of Federigo. And so it befell that the urchin began to  make friends with Federigo, and to shew a fondness for hawks and dogs,  and having seen Federigo's falcon fly not a few times, took a singular  fancy to him, and greatly longed to have him for his own, but still did  not dare to ask him of Federigo, knowing that Federigo prized him "]]]
