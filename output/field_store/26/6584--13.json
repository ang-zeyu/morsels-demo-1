She did not see him, as the rest of the  assembly did, born to one of the amplest estates in the county, and  qualified to assert his title to the richest heiress. She thought only  of Falkland, with those advantages which were most intimately his own,  and of which no persecution of adverse fortune had the ability to  deprive him. In a word, she was transported when he was present; he was  the perpetual subject of her reveries and her dreams; but his image  excited no sentiment in her mind beyond that of the immediate pleasure  she took in his idea.    The notice Mr. Falkland bestowed on her in return, appeared sufficiently  encouraging to a mind so full of prepossession as that of Emily. There  was a particular complacency in his looks when directed towards her. He  had said in a company, of which one of the persons present repeated his  remarks to Miss Melville, that she appeared to him amiable and  interesting; that he felt for her unprovided and destitute situation;  and that he should have been glad to be more particular in his attention  to her, had he not been apprehensive of doing her a prejudice in the  suspicious mind of Mr. Tyrrel. All this she considered as the ravishing  condescension of a superior nature; for, if she did not recollect with  sufficient assiduity his gifts of fortune, she was, on the other hand,  filled with reverence for his unrivalled accomplishments. But, while she  thus seemingly disclaimed all comparison between Mr. Falkland and  herself, she probably cherished a confused feeling as if some event,  that was yet in the womb of fate, might reconcile things apparently the  most incompatible. Fraught with these prepossessions, the civilities  that had once or twice occurred in the bustle of a public circle, the  restoring her fan which she had dropped, or the disembarrassing her of  an empty tea-cup, made her heart palpitate, and gave birth to the  wildest chimeras in her deluded imagination.    About this time an event happened, that helped to give a precise  determination to the fluctuations of Miss Melville's mind. One evening,  a short time after the death of Mr. Clare, Mr. Falkland had been at the  house of his deceased friend in his quality of executor, and, by some  accidents of little intrinsic importance, had been detained three or  four hours later than he expected. He did not set out upon his return  till two o'clock in the morning. At this time, in a situation so remote  from the metropolis, every thing is as silent as it would be in a  region wholly uninhabited. The moon shone bright; and the objects around  being marked with strong variations of light and shade, gave a kind of  sacred solemnity to the scene. Mr. Falkland had taken Collins with him,  the business to be settled at Mr. Clare's being in some respects similar  to that to which this faithful domestic had been accustomed in the  routine of his ordinary service. They had entered into some  conversation, for Mr. Falkland was not then in the habit of obliging the  persons about him by formality and reserve to recollect who he was. The  attractive solemnity of the scene made him break off the talk somewhat  abruptly, that he might enjoy it without interruption. They had not  ridden far, before a hollow wind seemed to rise at a distance, and they  could hear the hoarse roarings of the sea. Presently the sky on one side  assumed the appearance of a reddish brown, and a sudden angle in the  road placed this phenomenon directly before them. As they proceeded, it  became more distinct, and it was at length sufficiently visible that it  was occasioned by a fire. Mr. Falkland put spurs to his horse; and, as  they approached, the object presented every instant a more alarming  appearance. The flames ascended with fierceness; they embraced a large  portion of the horizon; and, as they carried up with them numerous  little fragments of the materials that fed them, impregnated with fire,  and of an extremely bright and luminous colour, they presented some  feeble image of the tremendous eruption of a volcano.    The flames proceeded from a village directly in their road. There were  eight or ten houses already on fire, and the whole seemed to be  threatened with immediate destruction. The inhabitants were in the  utmost consternation, having had no previous experience of a similar  calamity. They conveyed with haste their moveables and furniture into  the adjoining fields. When any of them had effected this as far as it  could be attempted with safety, they were unable to conceive any further  remedy, but stood wringing their hands, and contemplating the ravages of  the fire in an agony of powerless despair. The water that could be  procured, in any mode practised in that place, was but as a drop  contending with an element in arms. The wind in the mean time was  rising, and the flames spread with more and more rapidity.    Mr. Falkland contemplated this scene for a few moments, as if ruminating  with himself as to what could be done. He then directed some of the  country people about him to pull down a house, next to one that was  wholly on fire, but which itself was yet untouched. They seemed  astonished at a direction which implied a voluntary destruction of  property, and considered the task as too much in the heart of the danger  to be undertaken. Observing that they were motionless, he dismounted  from his horse, and called upon them in an authoritative voice to follow  him. He ascended the house in an instant, and presently appeared upon  the top of it, as if in the midst of the flames. Having, with the  assistance of two or three of the persons that followed him most  closely, and who by this time had supplied themselves with whatever  tools came next to hand, loosened the support of a stack of chimneys, he  pushed them headlong into the midst of the fire. He passed and repassed  along the roof; and, having set people to work in all parts, descended  in order to see what could be done in any other quarter. At this moment  an elderly woman burst from the midst of a house in flames: the utmost  consternation was painted in her looks; and, as soon as she could  recollect herself enough to have a proper idea of her situation, the  subject of her anxiety seemed, in an instant, to be totally changed.  \"Where is my child?\" cried she, and cast an anxious and piercing look  among the surrounding crowd. \"Oh, she is lost! she is in the midst of  flames! Save her! save her! my child!\" She filled the air with  heart-rending shrieks. She turned towards the house. The people that  were near endeavoured to prevent her, but she shook them off in a  moment. She entered the passage; viewed the hideous ruin; and was then  going to plunge into the blazing staircase. Mr. Falkland saw, pursued,  and seized her by the arm; it was Mrs. Jakeman. \"Stop!\" he cried, with a  voice of grand, yet benevolent authority. \"Remain you in the street! I  will seek, and will save her!\" Mrs. Jakeman obeyed. He charged the  persons who were near to detain her; he enquired which was the apartment  of Emily. Mrs. Jakeman was upon a visit to a sister who lived in the  village, and had brought Emily along with her. Mr. Falkland ascended a  neighbouring house, and entered that in which Emily was, by a window in  the roof.    He found her already awaked from her sleep; and, becoming sensible of  her danger, she had that instant wrapped a loose gown round her. Such is  the almost irresistible result of feminine habits; but, having done  this, she examined the surrounding objects with the wildness of despair.  Mr. Falkland entered the chamber. She flew into his arms with the  rapidity of lightning. She embraced and clung to him, with an impulse  that did not wait to consult the dictates of her understanding. Her  emotions were indescribable. In a few short moments she had lived an age  in love. In two minutes Mr. Falkland was again in the street with his  lovely, half-naked burthen in his arms. Having restored her to her  affectionate protector, snatched from the immediate grasp of death, from  which, if he had not, none would have delivered her, he returned to his  former task. By his presence of mind, by his indefatigable humanity and  incessant exertions, he saved three fourths of the village from  destruction.    The conflagration being at length abated, he sought again Mrs. Jakeman  and Emily, who by this time had obtained a substitute for the garments  she had lost in the fire. He displayed the tenderest solicitude for the  young lady's safety, and directed Collins to go with as much speed as he  could, and send his chariot to attend her. More than an hour elapsed in  this interval. Miss Melville had never seen so much of Mr. Falkland upon  any former occasion; and the spectacle of such humanity, delicacy,  firmness, and justice in the form of man, as he crowded into this small  space, was altogether new to her, and in the highest degree fascinating.  She had a confused feeling as if there had been something indecorous in  her behaviour or appearance, when Mr. Falkland had appeared to her  relief; and this combined with her other emotions to render the whole  critical and intoxicating.    Emily no sooner arrived at the family mansion, than Mr. Tyrrel ran out  to receive her. He had just heard of the melancholy accident that had  taken place at the village, and was terrified for the safety of his  good-humoured cousin. He displayed those unpremeditated emotions which  are common to almost every individual of the human race. He was greatly  shocked at the suspicion that Emily might possibly have become the  victim of a catastrophe which had thus broken out in the dead of night.  His sensations were of the most pleasing sort when he folded her in his  arms, and fearful apprehension was instantaneously converted into  joyous certainty. Emily no sooner entered under the well known roof than  her spirits were brisk, and her tongue"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11344"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 415, December 15, 1883 (#14)"],[1," already been formed  from pyridine, we have here a true synthesis also. Both _theobromine_  and _caffeine_, its methyl derivative, have been made from xanthine,  which itself can be formed from guanine, a constituent of guano.    We may conclude from this reference to what has been done in the last  few years, that the reproach mentioned in first speaking of the  alkaloids as a class, that almost nothing was known of their  constitution, will not long remain, and that as their molecular  structure is laid bare in these studies now being made, keen-sighted  chemists will effect their artificial formation. When these most  valuable compounds can be made by exact methods, in a state of entire  purity, and at a cost much below that paid for the present extraction of  them from relatively rare plants, organic chemistry will have placed all  of us under obligations as great as those owing any branch of science,  no matter how practical we call it.--_Amer.

If we examine the literature of our theme, we are astounded by the  apparently hopeless confusion in which the whole is involved. Everywhere  attempts at ill-founded generalization are encountered. We are compelled  to admit, after perusing long debates in regard to the relative merits  of various therapeutic measures, that those who were foremost to  disparage the treatment pursued by others were totally ignorant of the  fact that those same symptomatic manifestations which they were  considering might be owing to entirely different causes from similar  conditions described by others. Hence a commensurate modification in  therapy might not only be admissible, but eminently desirable. It is  more especially of recent years that a laudable attempt to differentiate  the various etiological factors involved in different forms of headache  has been made. In 1832 Dr. James Mease, of Philadelphia published a  monograph on \"The Cause, Cure, and Prevention of the Sick Headache,\"  which is substantially a treatise on the dietetics of this particular  form of headache. The work, however, is conspicuously lacking in those  philosophical qualities which are so necessary to a true understanding  of the questions involved. Dr. E.H. Sieveking published in 1854[1] a  most interesting paper on \"Chronic and Periodical Headache.\" The views  therein expressed are remarkable for their succinct and thoroughly  scientific elucidation of the two great physiological principles  involved in the consideration of by far the greater majority of  instances of cephalalgia. I refer namely to the importance ascribed by  this eminent physician to the fluctuations of the blood-stream within  the cranial vault. In speaking of this subject Dr. Sieveking says:  \"Nothing is of more importance in reference to the pathology and  therapeutics of the head than clear and well-defined notions on the  physiological subject of the circulation within the cranium; for, among  the various sources of medical skepticism, no one is more puzzling or  more destructive of logical practice than a contradiction between the  doctrine of physiology and the daily practice of medicine.\"    [Footnote 1: On Chronic and Periodical Headache, by E.H. Sieveking,  M.D., _Medical Times and Gazette_ London, August 12, 1854.]    What Dr. Sieveking said in 1854 holds equally good to-day; and, indeed,  the position then taken has received substantial indorsement through the  positive results of more recent experimental physiology. Conspicuous in  this connection are the inductive researches of Durham, Fleming, and  Hammond, touching the modifications in the cerebral circulation during  sleep and wakefulness. By these experiments it has been conclusively  proved that the amount of blood in the brain is decreased during sleep  and increased during wakefulness. More, recently I have had occasion to  confirm the experiments of Fleming in this direction, and have published  the results of those researches in various papers and articles.[1] \"What  Hippocrates said of spasm,\" says Dr. Sieveking, \"that it results either  from fullness or emptiness, or, to use more modern terms, from hyperaemia  or anaemia, applies equally to headache; but, to embrace all the causes  of this affection we must add a third element, which, though most  commonly complicating one of the above circumstances, is not necessarily  included in them, namely a change in the constitution of the blood.\"  While I agree with Dr. Sieveking as regards the importance to be  ascribed to the first two factors--cerebral hyperaemia and anaemia, in the  production of the group of symptoms known as \"headache,\"--I fail to  perceive why especial prominence should be given to the third condition  mentioned by Dr. Sieveking. Indeed, I am quite unable to imagine how the  periodical, and more especially the intermittent form, of headache is to  be explained by what Dr. Sieveking describes rather ambiguously as a  \"change in the constitution of the blood.\" It is quite evident,  admitting that such a change is capable of producing an amount of  cerebral irritation sufficient to develop well-marked cephalalgia, that  the latter must of necessity be within certain limits continuous. This  is not the case, as the causative factor is constant and not  fluctuating. I am, therefore, not prepared to accept this third  causative factor without question. Nevertheless I am perfectly willing  to admit that other factors besides cerebral hyperaemia and anaemia may  produce the functional variety of headache. There would seem to be ample  ground for ascribing great causative importance to excessive irritation  of the brain plasma itself. Hence those forms of headache which while,  being unaccompanied by any especial circulatory derangements, succeed,  oftentimes, with relentless regularity upon any considerable degree of  mental work. It is not my purpose to discuss the treatment of the  multifarious forms of cephalalgia on this occasion, did time permit. As  regards the so-called \"neuralgic\" variety I content myself by referring  to the admirable work on \"Neuralgia and Kindred Diseases of the Nervous  System,\" by Dr. John Chapman of London, in which will be found many  interesting facts bearing on the question. Accepting the propositions,  then, that the more adjacent causes of headache are (1) cerebral  hyperaemia, (2) cerebral anaemia, and (3) irritation of the cerebral  plasma itself, let us now consider how these morbid factors are most  scientifically and speedily met at the bedside; and how, more  particularly, those distressing conditions of engorgement, which are so  baneful an item in the causation of a certain form of cephalalgia, are  best overcome.    [Footnote 1: _Vide_ Carotid Compression and Brain Rest, by J.L. Corning,  M.D. New York: Anson D.F. Randolph & Co.]    Two years ago I began a series of experiments on epileptics and maniacs,  which involved the application of protracted pressure to the common  carotid artery on both sides. In the course of these experiments the  thought suggested itself that suppression of the carotids might prove a  salutary means of reducing that form of cerebral congestion which is so  prolific a source of headache and vertigo. Accordingly I made a  protracted series of experiments with carotid compression upon those  suffering from congestive headache, and I can only say that I have been  so far pleased with the uniformly good results obtained, that I have  felt it a duty to call the attention of the profession to a procedure  which, for obvious reasons, possesses all the advantages of local  depletion by leeching or cupping, without the manifest disadvantages of  either of these methods. The instruments which I have devised as  substitutes for the primitive procedure of digital compression of the  carotids have already been described in former communications. It is  only necessary to say that the implements in question are of two kinds;  one, the \"carotid fork,\" is an adjustable instrument, which being held  in the hand of the operator permits him to exert any degree of pressure  upon both carotids for any desired length of time. The other instrument,  which I have designated as the \"carotid truss,\" for lack of a better  name, is a circular spring provided with adjustable pads at each  extremity. The spring is placed about the neck of the patient, and by  suitable appliances the pads at the extremities can be placed directly  above the trunks of the two common carotid arteries. By turning the  screws to which the pads are attached the desired amount of pressure can  be applied to the arteries, and the apparatus can be worn for any length  of time by the patient.    With these instruments I have frequently succeeded in arresting the most  obstinate form of congestive headache in an incredibly short time (on  one occasion in about five minutes). Where, however, the headache is of  manifestly nervous origin and uncomplicated by any especial circulatory  derangements, I have never been able to achieve notable results with  this method. Indeed, pressure upon the carotids is an excellent method  of differentiating the congestive form of headache from the nervous  varieties of head pains.    Of galvanism this much may be said, that it is one of the most valuable  methods which we possess for treating the form of headache under  consideration, for not only does it cause contraction of the smaller  arteries, but it also exerts a soothing influence upon the plasma of the  brain itself.    A powerful therapeutic agent, and one which has been more or less  extensively employed in the treatment of various forms of head and  spinal symptoms, is cold.    A very excellent method of applying both cold and galvanism to the head,  at the same time, is afforded by a species of refrigerating electrode,  designed by"]]]
