So far the source of danger seems to be in the weld, which would  be inadmissible in larger pipes; but there is no reason why these should  not be lapped and riveted. There seems, however, a more promising way  out of the difficulty in the Mannesmann steel tubes which are now being  \"spun\" out of solid bars, so as to form weldless tubes.

These were adopted because there existed  some doubt as to the strength of gun metal under a high temperature; and  as the data respecting its strength appeared of a doubtful character, a  series of careful tests were made to determine the tensile strength of  gun metal when at atmospheric and higher temperatures. The test bars  were all 0.75 in diameter, or 0.4417 square inch sectional area; and  those tested at the higher temperatures were broken while immersed in a  bath of oil at the temperature here stated, each line being the mean of  four experiments. The result of these experiments was to give somewhat  greater faith in gun metal as a material to be used under a higher  temperature; but as steel is much stronger, it is probably the most  advisable material to use, when the time necessary to procure it can be  allowed.    _Feed Heating_.--With the double object of obviating strain on the  boiler through the introduction of the feed water at a low temperature,  and also of securing a greater economy of fuel, the principle of  previously heating the feed water by auxiliary means has received  considerable attention, and the ingenious method introduced by Mr. James  Weir has been widely adopted. It is founded on the fact that, if the  feed water as it is drawn from the hot well be raised in temperature by  the heat of a portion of steam introduced into it from one of the steam  receivers, the decrease of the coal necessary to generate steam from the  water of the higher temperature bears a greater ratio to the coal  required without feed heating than the power which would be developed in  the cylinder by that portion of steam would bear to the whole power  developed when passing all the steam through all the cylinders. The  temperature of the feed is of course limited by the temperature of the  steam in the receiver from which the supply for heating is drawn.  Supposing, for example, a triple expansion engine were working under the  following conditions without feed heating: Boiler pressure, 150  lb.;--indicated horse power in high pressure cylinder 398, in  intermediate and low pressure cylinders together 790, total, 1,188; and  temperature of hot well 100 deg. Fahr. Then with feed heating the same  engine might work as follows: The feed might be heated to 220 deg. Fahr.,  and the percentage of steam from the first receiver required to heat it  would be 12.2 per cent.; the indicated horse power in the high pressure  cylinder would be as before 398, and in the intermediate and low  pressure cylinders it would be 12.2 per cent, less than before, or 694,  and the total would be 1,092, or 92 per cent. of the power developed  without feed heating. Meanwhile the heat to be added to each pound of  the feed water at 220 deg. Fahr. for converting it into steam would be 1,005  units against 1,125 units with feed at 100 deg. Fahr., equivalent to an  expenditure of only 89.4 per cent. of the heat required without feed  heating. Hence the expenditure of heat in relation to power would be  89.4 + 92.0 = 97.2 per cent., equivalent to a heat economy of 2.8 per  cent. If the steam for heating can be taken from the low pressure  receiver, the economy is about doubled. Other feed heaters, more or less  upon the same principle, have been introduced. Also others which heat  the feed in a series of pipes within the boiler, so that it is  introduced into the water in the boiler practically at boiling  temperature; this is economical, however, only in the sense that wear  and tear of the boiler is saved; in principle the plan does not involve  economy of fuel.    _Auxiliary Supply of Fresh Water_.--Intimately associated with the feed  is the means adopted for making up the losses of fresh water due to  leakage of steam from safety valves, glands, joints, etc., and of water  discharged from the air pumps. A few years ago this loss was regularly  made up from the sea, with the result that the water in the boilers was  gradually increased in density; whence followed deposit on the internal  surfaces, and consequent loss of efficiency, and danger of accident  through overheating the plates. With the higher pressures now adopted,  the danger arising from overheating is much more serious, and the  necessity is absolute of maintaining the heating surfaces free from  deposit. This can be done only by filling the boiler with fresh water in  the first instance, and maintaining it in that condition. To do this two  methods are adopted, either separately or in conjunction. Either a  reserve supply of fresh water is carried in tanks or the supplementary  feed is distilled from sea water by special apparatus provided for the  purpose. In the construction of the distilling or evaporating apparatus  advantage has been taken of two important physical facts, namely, that,  if water be heated to a temperature higher than that corresponding with  the pressure on its surface, evaporation will take place; and that the  passage of heat from steam at one side of a plate to water at the other  is very rapid. In practice the distillation is effected by passing  steam, say from the first receiver, through a nest of tubes inside a  still or evaporator, of which the steam space is connected either with  the second receiver or with the condenser. The temperature of the steam  inside the tubes being higher than that of the steam either in the  second receiver or in the condenser, the result is that the water inside  the still is evaporated, and passes with the rest of the steam into the  condenser, where it is condensed, and serves to make up the loss. This  plan localizes the trouble of deposit, and frees it from its dangerous  character, because an evaporator cannot become overheated like a boiler,  even though it be neglected until it salts up solid; and if the same  precautions are taken in working the evaporator which used to be adopted  with low pressure boilers when they were fed with salt water, no serious  trouble should result. When the tubes do become incrusted with deposit,  they can be either withdrawn or exposed, as the apparatus is generally  so arranged; and they can then be cleaned.    _Screw Propeller_.--In Mr. Marshall's paper of 1881 it was said that  \"the screw propeller is still to a great extent an unsolved problem.\"  This was at the time a fairly true remark. It was true the problem had  been made the subject of general theoretical investigation by various  eminent mathematicians, notably by Professor Rankine and Mr. William  Froude, and of special experimental investigation by various engineers.  As examples of the latter may be mentioned the extended series of  investigations in the French vessel Pelican, and the series made by Mr.  Isherwood on a steam launch about 1874. These experiments, however, such  as they were, did little to bring out general facts and to reduce the  subject to a practical analysis. Since the date of Mr. Marshall's paper,  the literature on this subject has grown rapidly, and, has been almost  entirely of a practical character. The screw has been made the subject  of most careful experiments. One of the earliest extensive series of  experiments was made under the writer's direction in 1881, with a large  number of models, the primary object being to determine what value there  was in a few of the various twists which inventive ingenuity can give to  a screw blade. The results led the experimenters to the conclusion that  in free water such twists and curves are valueless as serving to augment  efficiency. The experiments were then carried further with a view to  determine quantitative moduli for the resistance of screws with  different ratios of pitch to diameter, or \"pitch ratios,\" and afterward  with different ratios of surface to the area of the circle described by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13642"],[0,"The Journal of Negro History, Volume 1, January 1916 (#14)"],[1,"try, the punishment of relatives frequently happens on  the same farm, and in view of each other:--The father often sees his  beloved son--the son his venerable sire--the mother her much-loved  daughter--the daughter her affectionate parent--the husband the wife of his  bosom, and she the husband of her affection, cruelly bound up without  delicacy or mercy, and punished with all extremity of incensed rage, and  all the rigour of unrelenting severity, whilst these unfortunate wretches  dare not even interpose in each other's behalf.

LETTER ON SLAVERY BY A NEGRO      I am one of that unfortunate race of men, who are distinguished from the  rest of the human species, by a black skin and wooly hair--disadvantages  of very little moment in themselves, but which prove to us a source of  greatest misery, because there are men, who will not be persuaded that  it is possible for a human soul to be lodged within a sable body. The  West Indian planters could not, if they thought us men, so wantonly  spill our blood; nor could the natives of this land of liberty, deeming  us of the same species with themselves, submit to be instrumental in  enslaving us, or think us proper subjects of a sordid commerce. Yet,  strong as the prejudices against us are, it will not, I hope on this  side of the Atlantic, be considered as a crime, for a poor African not  to confess himself a being of an inferior order to those, who happen to  be of a different colour from himself; or be thought very presumptuous,  in one who is but a negro, to offer to the happy subjects of this free  government, some reflections upon the wretched condition of his  countrymen. They will not, I trust, think worse of my brethren, for  being discontented with so hard a lot as that of slavery; nor disown me  for their fellow-creature, merely because I deeply feel the unmerited  sufferings which my countrymen endure.    It is neither the vanity of being an author, nor a sudden and capricious  gust of humanity, which has prompted this present design. It has long been  conceived and long been the principal subject of my thoughts. Ever since an  indulgent master rewarded my youthful services with freedom and supplied me  at a very early age with the means of acquiring knowledge, I have laboured  to understand the true principles, on which the liberties of mankind are  founded, and to possess myself of the language of this country, in order to  plead the cause of those who were once my fellow slaves, and if possible to  make my freedom, in some degree, the instrument of their deliverance.    The first thing then, which seems necessary, in order to remove those  prejudices, which are so unjustly entertained against us, is to prove  that we are men--a truth which is difficult of proof, only because it is  difficult to imagine, by what argument it can be combatted. Can it be  contended that a difference of colour alone can constitute a difference of  species?--if not in what single circumstance are we different from the rest  of mankind? what variety is there in our organization? what inferiority  of art in the fashoning of our bodies? what imperfection in the faculties  of our minds?--Has not a negro eyes? has not a negro hands, organs,  dimensions, senses, affections, passions?--fed with the same food; hurt  with the same weapons; subject to the same diseases; healed by the same  means; warmed and cooled by the same summer and winter as a white man? if  you prick us, do we not bleed? if you poison us, do we not die? are we not  exposed to all the same wants? do we not feel all the same sentiments--are  we not capable of all the same exertions--and are we not entitled to all  the same rights, as other men?    Yes--and it is said we are men, it is true; but that we are men, addicted  to more and worse vices, than those of any other complexion; and such is  the innate perverseness of our minds, that nature seems to have marked us  out for slavery.--Such is the apology perpetually made for our masters, and  the justification offered for that universal proscription, under which we  labour.    But, I supplicate our enemies to be, though for the first time, just in  their proceedings toward us, and to establish the fact before, they attempt  to draw any conclusions from it. Nor let them imagine that this can be  done, by merely asserting that such is our universal character. It is  the character, I grant, that our inhuman masters have agreed to give us,  and which they have so industriously and too successfully propagated, in  order to palliate their own guilt, by blackening the helpless victims of  it, and to disguise their own cruelty under the semblance of justice. Let  the natural depravity of our character be proved--not by appealing to  declamatory invectives, and interested representations, but by showing that  a greater proportion of crimes have been committed by the wronged slaves of  the plantation, than by the luxurous inhabitants of Europe, who are happily  strangers to those aggravated provocations, by which our passions are every  day irritated and incensed. Show us, that, of the multitude of negroes, who  have within a few years transported themselves to this country,[8] and who  are abandoned to themselves; who are corrupted by example, prompted by  penury, and instigated by the memory of their wrongs to the commission of  crime--shew us, I say (and the demonstration, if it be possible, cannot be  difficult) that a greater proportion of these, than of white men have  fallen under the animadversions of justice, and have been sacrificed to  your laws. Though avarice may slander and insult our misery, and though  poets heighten the horror of their fables, by representing us as monsters  of vice--the fact is, that, if treated like other men, and admitted to a  participation of their rights, we should differ from them in nothing,  perhaps, but in our possessing stronger passions, nicer sensibility, and  more enthusiastic virtue.    Before so harsh a decision was pronounced upon our nature, we might have  expected--if sad experience had not taught us, to expect nothing but  injustice from our adversaries--that some pains would have been taken,  to ascertain, what our nature is; and that we should have been considered,  as we are found in our native woods, and not as we now are--altered and  perverted by an inhuman political institution. But, instead of this, we  are examined, not by philosophers, but by interested traders: not as  nature formed us, but as man has depraved us--and from such an inquiry,  prosecuted under such circumstances, the perverseness of our dispositions  is said to be established. Cruel that you are! you make us slaves; you  implant in our minds all the vices, which are in some degree, inseparable  from that condition; and you then impiously impute to nature, and to God,  the origin of those vices, to which you alone have given birth; and punish  in us the crimes, of which you are yourselves the authors.    The condition of the slave is in nothing more deplorable, than in its being  so unfavorable to the practice of every virtue. The surest foundation of  virtue is love of our fellow creatures; and that affection takes its birth,  in the social relations of men to one another. But to a slave these are  all denied. He never pays or receives the grateful duties of a son--he  never knows or experiences the fond solicitude of a father--the tender  names of husband, of brother, and of friend, are to him unknown. He has no  country to defend and bleed for--he can relieve no sufferings--for he looks  around in vain, to find a being more wretched than himself. He can indulge  no generous sentiment--for he sees himself every hour treated with contempt  and ridiculed, and distinguished from irrational brutes, by nothing but  the severity of punishment. Would it be surprising, if a slave, labouring  under all these disadvantages--oppressed, insulted, scorned, trampled  on--should come at last to despise himself--to believe the calumnies of his  oppressors--and to persuade himself, that it would be against his nature,  to cherish any honourable sentiment or to attempt any virtuous action?  Before you boast of your superiority over us, place some of your own colour  (if you have the heart to do it) in the same situation with us; and see,  whether they have such innate virtue, and such unconquerable vigour of  mind, as to be capable of surmounting such multiplied difficulties, and of  keeping their minds free from the infection of every vice, even under the  oppressive yoke of such a servitude.    But, not satisfied with denying us that indulgence, to which the misery of  our condition gives us so just a claim, our enemies have laid down other  and stricter rules of morality, to judge our actions by, than those by  which the conduct of all other men is tried. Habits, which in all human  beings, except ourselves, are thought innocent, are, in us, deemed criminal  and actions, which are even laudable in white men, become enormous crimes  in negroes. In proportion to our weakness, the strictness of censure is  increased upon us; and as resources are withheld from us, our duties are  multiplied. The terror of punishment is perpetually before our eyes; but we  know not, how to avert it, what rules to act by, or what guides to follow.  We have written laws, indeed, composed in a language we do not understand  and never promulgated: but what avail written laws, when the supreme law,  with us, is the capricious will of our overseers? To obey the dictates of  our own hearts, and to yield to the strong propensities of nature, is often  to incur severe punishment; and by emulating examples which we find  applauded and revered among Europeans, we risk inflaming the wildest wrath  of our inhuman tyrants.
