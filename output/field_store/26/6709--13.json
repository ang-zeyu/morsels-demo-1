To these two remarkable  women another has to be added, Eva Gonzales, the favourite pupil of  Manet who has painted a fine portrait of her. Eva Gonzales became the  wife of the excellent engraver Henri Guerard, and died prematurely, not,  however, before one was able to admire her talent as an exquisitely  delicate pastellist. Having first been a pupil of Chaplin, she soon came  to forget the tricks of technique in order to acquire under Manet's  guidance the qualities of clearness and the strength of the great  painter of _Argenteuil_; and she would certainly have taken one of the  first places in modern art, had not her career been cut short by death.  A small pastel at the Luxembourg Gallery proves her convincing qualities  as a colourist.    [Illustration: MARY CASSATT    GETTING UP BABY]    [Illustration: MARY CASSATT    WOMEN AND CHILD]    Gustave Caillebotte was a friend of the Impressionists from the very  first hour. He was rich, fond of art, and himself a painter of great  merit who modestly kept hidden behind his comrades. His picture _Les  raboteurs de parquets_ made him formerly the butt of derision. To-day  his work, at the Luxembourg Gallery seems hardly a fit pretext for so  much controversy, but at that time much was considered as madness,  that to our eyes appears quite natural. This picture is a study of  oblique perspective and its curious _ensemble_ of rising lines sufficed  to provoke astonishment. The work is, moreover, grey and discreet in  colour and has some qualities of fine light, but is on the whole not  very interesting. Recently an exhibition of works by Caillebotte has  made it apparent that this amateur was a misjudged painter. The  still-life pictures in this exhibition were specially remarkable. But  the name of Caillebotte was destined to reach the public only in  connection with controversies and scandal. When he died, he left to the  State a magnificent collection of objets-d'art and of old pictures, and  also a collection of Impressionist works, stipulating that these two  bequests should be inseparable. He wished by this means to impose the  works of his friends upon the museums, and thus avenge their unjust  neglect. The State accepted the two legacies, since the Louvre  absolutely wanted to benefit by the ancient portion, in spite of the  efforts of the Academicians who revolted against the acceptance of the  modern part. On this occasion one could see how far the official  artists were carried by their hatred of the Impressionists. A group of  Academicians, professors at the _Ecole des Beaux-Arts_, threatened the  minister that they would resign _en masse_. \"We cannot,\" they wrote to  the papers, \"continue to teach an art of which we believe we know the  laws, from the moment the State admits into the museums, where our  pupils can see them, works which are the very negation of all we teach.\"  A heated discussion followed in the press, and the minister boldly  declared that Impressionism, good or bad, had attracted the attention of  the public, and that it was the duty of the State to receive impartially  the work of all the art movements; the public would know how to judge  and choose; the Government's duty was not to influence them by showing  them only one style of painting, but to remain in historic neutrality.  Thanks to this clever reply, the Academicians, among whom M. Gerome was  the most rabid, resigned themselves to keeping their posts. A similar  incident, less publicly violent, but equally strange, occurred on the  occasion of the admission to the Luxembourg Gallery of the portrait of  M. Whistler's mother, a masterpiece of which the gallery is proud  to-day, and for which a group of writers and art lovers had succeeded in  opening the way. It is difficult to imagine the degree of irritation and  obstruction of the official painters against all the ideas of the new  painting, and if it had only depended upon them, there can be no doubt  that Manet and his friends would have died in total obscurity, not only  banished from the Salons and museums, but also treated as madmen and  robbed of the possibility of living by their work.    The Caillebotte collection was installed under conditions which the  ill-will of the administrators made at least as deplorable as possible.  The works were crowded into a small, badly lighted room, where it is  absolutely impossible to see them from the distance required by the  method of the division of tones, and the meanness of the opposition was  such that, the pictures having been bequeathed without frames, the  keeper was obliged to have recourse to the reserves of the Louvre,  because he was refused the necessary credit for purchasing them. The  collection is however beautiful and interesting. It does not represent  Impressionism in all its brilliancy, since the works by which it is  composed had been bought by Caillebotte at a time, when his friends were  still far from having arrived at the full blossoming of their qualities.  But some very fine things can at least be found there. Renoir is  marvellously represented by the _Moulin de la Galette_, which is one of  his masterpieces. Degas figures with seven beautiful pastels, Monet with  some landscapes grand in style; Sisley and Pissarro appear scarcely to  their advantage, and finally it is to be regretted, that Manet is only  represented by a study in black in his first manner, the _Balcony_,  which does not count among his best pictures, and the famous _Olympia_  whose importance is more historical than intrinsic. The gallery has  separately acquired a _Young Girl in Ball Dress_ by Berthe Morisot,  which is a delicate marvel of grace and freshness. And in the place of  honour of the gallery is to be seen Fantin-Latour's great picture  _Hommage a Manet_, in which the painter, seated before his easel, is  surrounded by his friends; and this canvas may well be considered the  emblem of the slow triumph of Impressionism, and of the amends for a  great injustice.    It is in this picture that the young painter Bazille is represented, a  friend and pupil of Manet's, who was killed during the war of 1870, and  who should not be forgotten here. He has left a few canvases marked by  great talent, and would no doubt have counted among the most original  contemporary artists. We shall terminate this all too short enumeration  with two remarkable landscapists; the one is Albert Lebourg who paints  in suave and poetic colour schemes, with blues and greens of particular  tenderness, a painter who will take his place in the history of  Impressionism. The other is Eugene Boudin. He has not adopted Claude  Monet's technique; but I have already said that the vague and inexact  term \"Impressionism\" must be understood to comprise a group of painters  showing originality in the study of light and getting away from the  academic spirit. As to this, Eugene Boudin deserves to be placed in the  first rank. His canvases will be the pride of the best arranged  galleries. He is an admirable seascape painter. He has known how to  render with unfailing mastery, the grey waters of the Channel, the  stormy skies, the heavy clouds, the effects of sunlight feebly piercing  the prevailing grey. His numerous pictures painted at the port of Havre  are profoundly expressive. Nobody has excelled him in drawing  sailing-boats, in giving the exact feeling of the keels plunged into the  water, in grouping the masts, in rendering the activity of a port, in  indicating the value of a sail against the sky, the fluidity of calm  water, the melancholy of the distance, the shiver of short waves rippled  by the breeze. Boudin is a learned colourist of grey tones. His  Impressionism consists in the exclusion of useless details, his  comprehension of reflections, his feeling for values, the boldness of  his composition and his faculty of directly perceiving nature and the  transparency of atmosphere: he reminds sometimes of Constable and of  Corot. Boudin's production has been enormous, and nothing that he has  done is indifferent. He is one of those artists who have not a brilliant  career, but who will last, and whose name, faithfully retained by the  elect, is sure of immortality. He may be considered an isolated  artist, on the border line between Classicism and Impressionism, and  this is unquestionably the cause of the comparative obscurity of his  fame. The same might be said of the ingenuous and fine landscapist  Hervier, who has left such interesting canvases; and of the Lyons  water-colour painter Ravier who, almost absolutely unknown, came very  close to Monticelli and showed admirable gifts. It must, however, be  recognised that Boudin is nearer to Impressionism than to any other  grouping of artists, and he must be considered as a small master of pure  French lineage. Finally, if a question of nationality prevents me from  enlarging upon the subject of the rank of precursor which must be  accorded to the great Dutch landscapist Jongkind, I must at least  mention his name. His water-colour sketches have been veritable  revelations for several Impressionists. Eugene Boudin and Berthe Morisot  have derived special benefit from them, and they are valuable lessons  for many young painters of the present day.    [Illustration: JONGKIND    IN HOLLAND]    [Illustration: JONGKIND    VIEW OF THE HAGUE]    We do not pretend to have mentioned in this chapter all the painters  directly connected with the first Impressionist movement. We have  confined ourselves to enumerating the most important only, and each of  them would deserve a complete essay. But our object will have been  achieved, if we have inspired art-lovers with just esteem for this brave  phalanx of artists who have proved better than any aesthetic  commentaries the vitality, the originality, and the logic of Manet's  theories, the great importance of the notions introduced by him"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14060"],[0,"Mr. Britling Sees It Through (#14)"],[1,"from the pangs of unrequited love,  and to conceal from himself just how bitterly his pride and vanity had  been rent by her ultimate rejection. There had been a time when she had  given him reason to laugh in his sleeve at Booth Wilmington.    Perhaps Booth Wilmington had also had reason for laughing in his  sleeve....    Had she even loved Booth Wilmington? Or had she just snatched at him?...    Wasn't he, Direck, as good a man as Booth Wilmington anyhow?...    For some moments the old sting of jealousy rankled again. He recalled  the flaring rivalry that had ended in his defeat, the competition of  gifts and treats.... A thing so open that all Carrierville knew of it,  discussed it, took sides.... And over it all Mamie with her flashing  smile had sailed like a processional goddess....    Why, they had made jokes about him in the newspapers!    One couldn't imagine such a contest in Matching's Easy. Yet surely even  in Matching's Easy there are lovers.    Is it something in the air, something in the climate that makes things  harder and clearer in America?...    Cissie--why shouldn't one call her Cissie in one's private thoughts  anyhow?--would never be as hard and clear as Mamie. She had English  eyes--merciful eyes....    That was the word--_merciful_!

They don't laugh at you.... At least--they laugh differently....    Was England the tolerant country? With its kind eyes and its wary  sidelong look. Toleration. In which everything mellowed and nothing was  destroyed. A soft country. A country with a passion for imperfection. A  padded country....    England--all stuffed with soft feathers ... under one's ear. A  pillow--with soft, kind Corners ... Beautiful rounded Corners.... Dear,  dear Corners. Cissie Corners. Corners. Could there be a better family?    Massachusetts--but in heaven....    Harps playing two-steps, and kind angels wrapped in moonlight.

DIRECK REACHES A CLIMAX      Section 1    Breakfast was in the open air, and a sunny, easy-going feast. Then the  small boys laid hands on Mr. Direck and showed him the pond and the  boats, while Mr. Britling strolled about the lawn with Hugh, talking  rather intently. And when Mr. Direck returned from the boats in a state  of greatly enhanced popularity he found Mr. Britling conversing over his  garden railings to what was altogether a new type of Britisher in Mr.  Direck's experience. It was a tall, lean, sun-bitten youngish man of  forty perhaps, in brown tweeds, looking more like the Englishman of the  American illustrations than anything Mr. Direck had met hitherto. Indeed  he came very near to a complete realisation of that ideal except that  there was a sort of intensity about him, and that his clipped moustache  had the restrained stiffness of a wiry-haired terrier. This gentleman  Mr. Direck learnt was Colonel Rendezvous. He spoke in clear short  sentences, they had an effect of being punched out, and he was refusing  to come into the garden and talk.    \"Have to do my fourteen miles before lunch,\" he said. \"You haven't seen  Manning about, have you?\"    \"He isn't here,\" said Mr. Britling, and it seemed to Mr. Direck that  there was the faintest ambiguity in this reply.    \"Have to go alone, then,\" said Colonel Rendezvous. \"They told me that he  had started to come here.\"    \"I shall motor over to Bramley High Oak for your Boy Scout festival,\"  said Mr. Britling.    \"Going to have three thousand of 'em,\" said the Colonel. \"Good show.\"    His steely eyes seemed to search the cover of Mr. Britling's garden for  the missing Manning, and then he decided to give him up. \"I must be  going,\" he said. \"So long. Come up!\"    A well-disciplined dog came to heel, and the lean figure had given Mr.  Direck a semi-military salutation and gone upon its way. It marched with  a long elastic stride; it never looked back.    \"Manning,\" said Mr. Britling, \"is probably hiding up in my rose garden.\"    \"Curiously enough, I guessed from your manner that that might be the  case,\" said Mr. Direck.    \"Yes. Manning is a London journalist. He has a little cottage about a  mile over there\"--Mr. Britling pointed vaguely--\"and he comes down for  the week-ends. And Rendezvous has found out he isn't fit. And everybody  ought to be fit. That is the beginning and end of life for Rendezvous.  Fitness. An almost mineral quality, an insatiable activity of body,  great mental simplicity. So he takes possession of poor old Manning and  trots him for that fourteen miles--at four miles an hour. Manning goes  through all the agonies of death and damnation, he half dissolves, he  pants and drags for the first eight or ten miles, and then I must admit  he rather justifies Rendezvous' theory. He is to be found in the  afternoon in a hammock suffering from blistered feet, but otherwise  unusually well. But if he can escape it, he does. He hides.\"    \"But if he doesn't want to go with Rendezvous, why does he?\" said Mr.  Direck.    \"Well, Rendezvous is accustomed to the command of men. And Manning's  only way of refusing things is on printed forms. Which he doesn't bring  down to Matching's Easy. Ah! behold!\"    Far away across the lawn between two blue cedars there appeared a  leisurely form in grey flannels and a loose tie, advancing with manifest  circumspection.    \"He's gone,\" cried Britling.    The leisurely form, obviously amiable, obviously a little out of  condition, became more confident, drew nearer.    \"I'm sorry to have missed him,\" he said cheerfully. \"I thought he might  come this way. It's going to be a very warm day indeed. Let us sit about  somewhere and talk.    \"Of course,\" he said, turning to Direck, \"Rendezvous is the life and  soul of the country.\"    They strolled towards a place of seats and hammocks between the big  trees and the rose garden, and the talk turned for a time upon  Rendezvous. \"They have the tidiest garden in Essex,\" said Manning. \"It's  not Mrs. Rendezvous' fault that it is so. Mrs. Rendezvous, as a matter  of fact, has a taste for the picturesque. She just puts the things about  in groups in the beds. She wants them, she says, to grow anyhow. She  desires a romantic disorder. But she never gets it. When he walks down  the path all the plants dress instinctively.... And there's a tree near  their gate; it used to be a willow. You can ask any old man in the  village. But ever since Rendezvous took the place it's been trying to  present arms. With the most extraordinary results. I was passing the  other day with old Windershin. 'You see that there old poplar,' he said.  'It's a willow,' said I. 'No,' he said, 'it did used to be a willow  before Colonel Rendezvous he came. But now it's a poplar.'... And, by  Jove, it is a poplar!\"...    The conversation thus opened by Manning centred for a time upon Colonel  Rendezvous. He was presented as a monster of energy and self-discipline;  as the determined foe of every form of looseness, slackness, and  easy-goingness.    \"He's done wonderful work for the local Boy Scout movement,\" said  Manning.    \"It's Kitchenerism,\" said Britling.    \"It's the army side of the efficiency stunt,\" said Manning.    There followed a digression upon the Boy Scout movement, and Mr. Direck  made comparisons with the propaganda of Seton Thompson in America.  \"Colonel Teddyism,\" said Manning. \"It's a sort of reaction against  everything being too easy and too safe.\"    \"It's got its anti-decadent side,\" said Mr. Direck.    \"If there is such a thing as decadence,\" said Mr. Britling.    \"If there wasn't such a thing as decadence,\" said Manning, \"we  journalists would have had to invent it.\"...    \"There is something tragical in all this--what shall I call  it?--Kitchenerism,\" Mr. Britling reflected \"Here you have it rushing  about and keeping itself--screwed up, and trying desperately to keep the  country screwed up. And all because there may be a war some day somehow  with Germany. Provided Germany _is_ insane. It's that war, like some  sort of bee in Rendezvous' brains, that is driving him along the road  now to Market Saffron--he always keeps to the roads because they are  severer--through all the dust and sunshine. When he might be here  gossiping....    \"And you know, I don't see that war coming,\" said Mr. Britling. \"I  believe Rendezvous sweats in vain. I can't believe in that war. It has  held off for forty years. It may hold off forever.\"    He nodded his head towards the German tutor, who had come into view  across the lawn, talking profoundly with Mr. Britling's eldest son.    \"Look at that pleasant person. There he is--_Echt Deutsch_--if anything  ever was. Look at my son there! Do you see the two of them engaged in  mortal combat? The thing's too ridiculous. The world grows sane. They  may fight in the Balkans still; in many ways the Balkan States are in  the very rear of civilisation; but to imagine decent countries like this  or Germany going back to bloodshed! No.... When I see Rendezvous  keeping it up and keeping it up, I begin to see just how poor Germany  must be keeping it up. I begin to realise how sick Germany must be  getting of the high road and the dust and heat and the everlasting drill  and restraint.... My heart goes out to the South Germans. Old Manning  here always reminds me of Austria. Think of Germany coming like  Rendezvous on a Sunday morning, and looking stiffly over Austria's  fence. 'Come for a good hard walk, man. Keep Fit....'\"    \"But suppose this Balkan trouble becomes acute,\" said Manning.    \"It hasn't; it won't. Even if it did we should keep out of it.\"    \"But suppose Russia grappled Austria and Germany flung herself suddenly  upon France--perhaps taking Belgium"]]]
