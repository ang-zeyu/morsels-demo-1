I'll vouch  for that! [_To himself._] Any man who gives away his daughter's dowry  must not be surprised if she remains an old maid. When I think of that  my back gets stiff, and I could wish that the old fellow were here to  receive a lecture. Why must I be such a monster?--Only because he was a  fool! Whatever happens as a result of that, he is to blame for it! That  is obvious!    [_To CLARA._]    Or would you prefer to have me talk with him myself? For your sake I  will risk a black eye and go to him. He may be rough with me, he may  throw the boot-jack at my head, but he will have to swallow the truth in  spite of the stomach-ache it gives him, and let you rest in peace!--Is  he at home?    CLARA (_stands up straight_).    I thank you!    [_Starts to go._]    LEONARD.    Shall I go over with you? I have the courage!    CLARA.    I thank you as I would thank a serpent which had wound itself around me  and unwound itself and sprung away again, because another prey enticed  it. I know that I have been bitten, I know that it deserts me only  because it does not seem worth the trouble to suck out what little  marrow there is left in my bones. But still I thank the snake, for now I  shall have a quiet death. Yes, man, I am not mocking; to me it is as if  I had seen through your breast down into the abyss of hell, and whatever  may be my lot in the awful eternity to come, I shall never have anything  more to do with you, and that is a consolation! And just as the  unfortunate person whom a viper has stung cannot be blamed for opening  his veins in terror and disgust, in order that his poisoned blood may  stream swiftly forth, so perhaps God in His everlasting mercy will take  pity on me when He looks down upon you and me and sees what you have  made of me! For how _could_ I do it, when I never, never _should_ have  done it?--One thing more: My father knows nothing, he does not even  suspect anything! And that he may never find out I shall quit the world  this very day! If I thought for one moment that you [_she takes a step,  wildly, toward him_]--oh, but that is foolishness! You would be only all  the better pleased to see them all stand and shake their heads and  inquire in vain of one another why it happened!    LEONARD.    Things will happen--what is one to do, Clara?    CLARA.    Away from here! The man can talk!    [_She starts to go._]    LEONARD.    Do you think that I believe you?    CLARA.    No!    LEONARD.    Thank God, you cannot be a suicide without being an infanticide as well!    CLARA.    Better both than a parricide! Oh, I know that one cannot atone for one  sin with another! But what I now do affects me alone! If I hand the  knife to my father the blow strikes him as well as me! It strikes me in  any case! That gives me courage and strength in all my distress! Things  will go well with you on earth!    [_Exit._]        SCENE V    LEONARD (_alone_).    \"I must, I must marry her!\" And why must I? She is going to do a crazy  thing in order to keep her father from doing one. Where lies the  necessity of my doing a still crazier thing in order to ward off hers? I  cannot admit the necessity--at least not until I see before me the man  who wants to get ahead of me with the most insane act of all! And if he  thinks as I do about it there will be no end! That sounds quite  sensible, and yet--I must follow her! Here comes somebody! Thank  God!--Nothing is more ignominious than to have to be at variance with  one's own thoughts! A rebellion in the head, in which one brings forth  viper after viper and each one tries to eat the other or bite his tail,  is the worst of all!        SCENE VI    _Enter the SECRETARY._    SECRETARY.    Good evening!    LEONARD.    Mr. Secretary? To what do I owe the honor--    SECRETARY.    Leonard, you will see at once!    LEONARD.    You say Leonard to me?--To be sure, we used to be schoolmates!    SECRETARY.    And we may perhaps be death-mates too!    [_He draws forth two pistols._]    Do you know how to handle these?    LEONARD.    I do not understand you!    SECRETARY (_cocks one of them_).    Do you see?--This is how it is done! Then you aim at me, as I am now  doing at you, and pull the trigger! So!    LEONARD.    What are you talking about?    SECRETARY.    One of us two must die! Die! And immediately!    LEONARD.    Die?    SECRETARY.    You know why!    LEONARD.    By God, no!    SECRETARY.    No matter--it will occur to you all right when you are dying!    LEONARD.    I have no idea--    SECRETARY.    Bethink yourself! Otherwise I might take you for a mad dog that has  unwittingly bitten the one I love most on earth, and shoot you down as  such! But for half an hour more I must let you pass as my equal!    LEONARD.    But don't talk so loud! If anybody should hear you--    SECRETARY.    If anybody could hear me you would have called him long ago! Well?    LEONARD.    If it is about the girl--I can marry her, you know! I had, in fact, half  made up my mind to do it, when she herself was here!    SECRETARY.    She was here! And has gone away again without having seen you contrite  and repentant at her feet? Come! Come!    LEONARD.    I beg of you! You see before you a man who is ready to do anything that  you dictate. This very evening I will betroth myself to her.    SECRETARY.    That I shall do, no one else. If the world itself hung on it you should  not even touch the hem of her dress again! Come! Into the woods with me!  But mark this! I shall take you by the arm, and if on the way you emit a  single cry--[_He holds up a pistol._] I trust you believe me!  Nevertheless, that you may not feel tempted, we will take the road  through the garden behind the house!    LEONARD.    One of them is for me--give it to me!    SECRETARY.    So that you can throw it away and compel me to murder you or let you  escape! Is that why you want it? Be patient, until we are on the spot!  Then I shall divide with you honestly!    LEONARD (_goes, and accidentally knocks his drinking-glass from the  table_).    Shall I never take another drink?    SECRETARY.    Courage, my lad! Perhaps it will go well with you! God and the devil  seem to be forever fighting for the world! Who knows which is master  just now?    [_Seizes him by the arm; exeunt both._]        SCENE VII    _A Room in the Joiner's House; enter CARL._    CARL.    Nobody at home! Had I not known about the rat-hole under the threshold  where they always hide the key when they all go out, I could not have  got in! Well, that would not have made any difference! I could run  around the city twenty times now and imagine to myself that there was no  greater pleasure in the world than that of using one's legs! Let's have  a light!    [_He strikes a light._]    I'll bet the tinder-box is in the same old place, for we have twice ten  commandments in this house! The hat belongs on the third nail, not on  the fourth! At half past nine one has to be tired! Before Martinmas one  must not shiver; after Martinmas one must not sweat! That stands on a  line with: Thou shalt love and fear God! I am thirsty!    [_Calls._]    Mother! Fie! As if I had forgotten that she lies where even the  innkeeper's boots no longer has to open his nut-cracker mouth with a  \"Yes, sir!\" when he is called! I did not weep when I heard the funeral  bell in my dark cell, but--Redcoat, you would not even let me roll the  last ball at the bowling alley, although I already had it in my hand.  Well, I shall not leave you time for a last breath when I meet you  alone, and that may happen this very evening! I know where you are to be  found about ten o'clock! Afterward, aboard ship!--I wonder where Clara  is? I am as hungry as I am thirsty! Today is Thursday--they have veal  broth for dinner. If it were winter, they would have had cabbage--before  Shrove-Tuesday white cabbage--after Shrove-Tuesday, green cabbage! That  is as fixed as Thursday's having to come when Wednesday has passed, so  that it cannot say to Friday: You go in my place--my feet are sore!        SCENE VIII    _Enter, CLARA._    CARL.    At last!--You should not kiss so much! Whenever four red lips meet a  bridge for the devil is built!--What have you there?    CLARA.    Where? What?    CARL.    Where? What?--In your hand!    CLARA.    Nothing!    CARL.    Nothing? Is it a secret?    [_He snatches LEONARD'S letter._]    Give me that! When the father is not here the brother is guardian!    CLARA.    I held fast to the scrap of paper, and yet the evening wind is so strong  that it blows the tiles off the roofs. As I was passing the church one  fell right in front of me, so that my foot struck against it. Oh, God! I  thought--one more! And I stood still. That would have been fine; they  would have buried me and said: \"She met with an accident!\"--But I waited  in vain for the second.    CARL (_has read the letter_).    Thunder and--I'll lame the hand that wrote that!--Bring me a bottle of  wine! Or is your savings box empty?    CLARA.    There is one more in the house. I had bought it secretly for mother's  birthday and put it aside. Tomorrow would have been the day--[_She turns  away._]    CARL.    Give it to me!    CLARA (_brings the wine_).    CARL (_drinks quickly_).    Now we can start in again--planing, sawing,  hammering, and, in between, eating, drinking, and sleeping, so that we  can go on planing, sawing, and hammering, and on Sundays do a bit of  praying into the bargain! I thank Thee, O Lord, that I may plane, saw,  and hammer!    [_Drinks._]    Long live every good dog that is tied to a chain, and yet does not snap  at everything around him!    [_He drinks again._]    And once more: Here's to his health!    CLARA.    Carl, do not drink so much! Father says the devil lurks in wine!    CARL.    And the priest says God lurks in wine! [_He drinks._] Let us see who is  right! The bailiff was here at the house--how did he behave himself?    CLARA.    As"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13033"],[0,"Three Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia, Volume 2 (#14)"],[1,"parallel to it.    I was disappointed in not finding sufficient water for our use remaining  on the surface after the late rain; and although the country appeared  declining to the westward, and we saw more pigeons and recent marks of  natives, I was reluctantly obliged at length to bend my steps  south-westward and afterwards south. The country we traversed was one  level plain whose extent westward we neither knew nor could discover, and  for some hours during this day's ride scarcely a bush was visible.    SAND HILLS.    Clumps of trees of the flooded box, or marura of the natives, appeared  occasionally in and about the many hollows in the surface; and, on the  isolated eminences of red sand, callitris trees grew, always hopeless  objects to persons in want of water. These patches of sand however were  not numerous, and never rose more than a few feet above the common  surface, which in general consisted of clay more or less tenacious. Parts  of it were quite naked; but others bore a crop of grass about three years  old which probably sprang up after the last thorough drenching of the  surface.    DEEP CRACKS IN THE EARTH.    So parched however was the ground now, especially in those parts which  bore no vegetation, that it yawned in cracks too deep to be fathomed by  the length of my sabre and arm together.    ATRIPLEX.    The best ground for travelling was of a reddish colour, glossy and firm  with tufts of a species of atriplex upon it; a dwarf grass with large  seeds not seen elsewhere by me was springing up, apparently in  consequence of the late rains. This new vegetation did not grow near the  old grass, and was too thin and low to tinge the surface.* The dreary  look of the old grass in other parts, decayed and of the colour of lead,  could not be exceeded; roots and stalks being all dead and decayed like  rotten timber.    (*Footnote. Panicum flavidum of Retz.)    SOUTH-WEST WINDS.    Every blade drooped towards the north-east and showed plainly how  prevalent the south-west winds were on these open wastes. In a gloomy day  a wanderer lost upon them might have known his course merely by the  uniform drooping of those blades of grass towards the north-east.    SEARCH FOR THE LACHLAN.    After travelling ten miles south-west without perceiving any indication  of the river I directed our course southward and, after proceeding seven  miles in that direction, we came upon a hollow of Polygonum junceum so  full of wide and deep cracks that our horses were got across with  difficulty. It extended in a south-west direction towards some flooded  box-trees. The country beyond was better wooded, and at eleven miles we  at length approached a creek, and the large trees which enveloped it  looked like those of the river itself; but we saw none of the yarra or  white-trunked trees which always accompanied such waters and, although we  certainly found the channel of a considerable current, it was shallow,  quite dry, and full of Polygonum junceum.    I could hardly consider this a lateral branch of the river as I thought  that I had seen its head in some hollows which I crossed on the plains  the day before. After passing this channel however we descried a long  dark line of river-trees which, as our horses were getting tired, we were  now somewhat anxious to see and, the native perceiving smoke arising from  the woods there, I, at his request, altered my course to that direction  which was 30 degrees East of South.    THIRST OF BARNEY.    None of the party suffered so much apparently from the want of water as  Barney, our native friend. He rode foremost of the men with a tin pot in  his hand, his eyes fixed on remote distance and his mouth open, with the  lower lip projecting, as if to catch rain from the heavens. When we were  within two miles of those trees we found enough of rainwater in a shallow  hole to refresh our horses, but it was surrounded with such tempting  grass that the animals preferred the verdure to it. Barney drank as much  as he wished, and I advised the men to fill their horns, but the horses  soon trod the water into mud, and all expected to find plenty near the  smoke; a hope in which I was by no means sanguine.    CROSS VARIOUS DRY CHANNELS.    The first line of trees we crossed enclosed only a shallow channel,  overgrown with polygonum; and we in vain sought the natives although we  saw where portions of fire had been recently dropped.    Three miles further we perceived a more promising line of trees and smoke  arising from them also. There we found the yarra trees growing on a flat  with a reedy channel meandering amongst them. The fire arose from some  burning trees and grass; and there were huts of natives but no  inhabitants.    GRAVES.    Green bushes grew luxuriantly, and amongst them, in a romantic looking  spot, three separate graves had been recently erected. Still we could  perceive neither signs of water nor any of the natives who might have  told us where to find it. Crossing another small plain of firm ground we  came upon what seemed to be the main channel of the Lachlan, pursuing a  course to the west-north-west. It had not however above one-third of the  capacity of the bed above, but in every other respect it was similar.  Having in vain looked for a waterhole we hastened towards another line of  trees which we reached by sunset. It consisted of the yarra kind also,  but overhung what was only a hollow in the midst of a plain, although  evidently subject to inundation.    SECOND NIGHT WITHOUT WATER.    To find water there seemed quite out of the question; but we were  nevertheless obliged to halt, for the sun had set. Late in the night, as  we lay burning with thirst and dreaming of water, a species of duck flew  over our heads which, from its peculiar note, I knew I had previously  heard on the Darling. It was flying towards the south-west.    April 24.    We proceeded on the bearing of 80 degrees east of south, towards the  nearest bend of a line of yarra river-trees. There we found, after riding  two miles, another diminutive Lachlan, precisely similar to the former,  but rather less: it was very sinuous in its course and full of holes, but  surrounded by green bushes with chirping birds; but it was too obvious  that these holes had been long, long dry. Thence I pursued a course 24  degrees North of East over naked ground, evidently subject at times to  inundation, towards other large trees; being anxious to cross all the  arms of the Lachlan before taking up its general course to guide us back  to our camp which lay then, by my calculation, 43 miles in direct  distance, higher up the river.    NATIVE TUMULUS.    On this flat we passed a newly-raised tumulus, a remarkable circumstance  considering the situation; for I had observed that the natives of the  Darling always selected the higher ground for burying in; and it might be  presumed that, on this part of the Lachlan, the tribe (whose marks were  numerous on the trees) could find no heights within their territory.    REEDY SWAMP WITH DEAD TREES.    We found that this belt of river-trees enclosed a dry swamp only, covered  with dead reeds, amongst which stood a forest of dead yarra trees,  bearing well-defined marks of water in dark stained rings at the height  of about four feet on their barkless trunks. The soil was soft and rich  and, where no roots of reeds bound it together, it opened in yawning  cracks which were very deep. This dried up swamp was nearly a mile broad,  and beyond it we found firm open and good ground; some very large  eucalypti or yarra growing between it and the edge of the reeds.    ROUTE OF MR. OXLEY.    I was now satisfied that we had crossed the whole bed of the Lachlan; and  I thought Mr. Oxley's line of route might have passed near the spot where  I then stood; and that in a time of flood all the channels, save the one  next the firm ground, might easily have escaped his notice. Here our  horses began to be quite knocked up, chiefly from want of water; we  therefore dismounted and dragged them on, for I hoped by taking the  direction of Mr. Oxley's line of route, as shown on his map, that the  branches would soon concentrate in one united channel.    DRY BED OF THE LACHLAN.    At the end of four miles we found that junction had taken place, and the  bed of the river as broad and deep as usual, but it was everywhere dry. I  made the people lead the exhausted horses from point to point, while I  examined all the bends, for the course was very sinuous; still I saw no  appearance of water, nor even of any having recently dried up.    FIND AT LENGTH A LARGE POOL.    After proceeding thus about two miles, the chirping of birds and a tree  full of chattering parrots raised my hopes that water was near; and at a  very sharp turn of the channel, to the great delight of all, I at length  saw a large and deep pool. Our horses stood drinking a full quarter of an  hour; and during the time a duck dropped into the pond amongst them. The  poor bird appeared to have been as much overcome by thirst as ourselves  for, on the inconsiderate native throwing his boomerang, it was scarcely  able to fly to the top of the opposite bank. As the grass was good I  halted during the remainder of the day for the sake of our horses;  although the delay subjected us to another night in the bush. I made the  men sit down out of sight of the pond for a reason which I did not choose  to tell them; but it was that we might not, by our presence, deprive many  other starving creatures of a benefit which Providence had so bountifully  afforded to us.    On a large tree overlooking the pond, and which had already been deprived  by the natives of a considerable patch of bark, I chalked the letter M,  which the men cut out of the solid wood with their tomahawks. This being  the lowest permanent pond above the separation of the river into so many  arms, I thought that by such a mark of a white man the natives"]]]
