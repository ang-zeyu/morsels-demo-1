Even  Heath Wilson, for instance, writes: \"The massive shoulders are thrown  back, the right arm is pendent, and _the right hand grasps resolutely  the stone_ with which the adversary is to be slain.\" This entirely  falsifies the sculptor's motive, misses the meaning of the sling,  renders the broad strap behind the back superfluous, and changes into  mere plastic symbolism what Michelangelo intended to be a moment  caught from palpitating life.    It has often been remarked that David's head is modelled upon the type  of Donatello's S. George at Orsanmichele. The observation is just; and  it suggests a comment on the habit Michelangelo early formed of  treating the face idealistically, however much he took from study of  his models. Vasari, for example, says that he avoided portraiture, and  composed his faces by combining several individuals. We shall see a  new ideal type of the male head emerge in a group of statues, among  which the most distinguished is Giuliano de' Medici at San Lorenzo. We  have already seen a female type created in the Madonnas of S. Peter's  and Notre Dame at Bruges. But this is not the place to discuss  Michelangelo's theory of form in general. That must be reserved until  we enter the Sistine Chapel, in order to survey the central and the  crowning product of his genius in its prime.    We have every reason to believe that Michelangelo carved his David  with no guidance but drawings and a small wax model about eighteen  inches in height. The inconvenience of this method, which left the  sculptor to wreak his fury on the marble with mallet and chisel, can  be readily conceived. In a famous passage, disinterred by M. Mariette  from a French scholar of the sixteenth century, we have this account  of the fiery master's system: \"I am able to affirm that I have seen  Michelangelo, at the age of more than sixty years, and not the  strongest for his time of life, knock off more chips from an extremely  hard marble in one quarter of an hour than three young stone-cutters  could have done in three or four--a thing quite incredible to one who  has not seen it. He put such impetuosity and fury into his work that I  thought the whole must fly to pieces; hurling to the ground at one  blow great fragments three or four inches thick, shaving the line so  closely that if he had overpassed it by a hair's-breadth he ran the  risk of losing all, since one cannot mend a marble afterwards or  repair mistakes, as one does with figures of clay and stucco.\" It is  said that, owing to this violent way of attacking his marble,  Michelangelo sometimes bit too deep into the stone, and had to abandon  a promising piece of sculpture. This is one of the ways of accounting  for his numerous unfinished statues. Accordingly a myth has sprung up  representing the great master as working in solitude upon huge blocks,  with nothing but a sketch in wax before him. Fact is always more  interesting than fiction; and, while I am upon the topic of his  method, I will introduce what Cellini has left written on this  subject. In his treatise on the Art of Sculpture, Cellini lays down  the rule that sculptors in stone ought first to make a little model  two palms high, and after this to form another as large as the statue  will have to be. He illustrates this by a critique of his illustrious  predecessors. \"Albeit many able artists rush boldly on the stone with  the fierce force of mallet and chisel, relying on the little model and  a good design, yet the result is never found by them to be so  satisfactory as when they fashion the model on a large scale. This is  proved by our Donatello, who was a Titan in the art, and afterwards by  the stupendous Michelangelo, who worked in both ways. Discovering  latterly that the small models fell far short of what his excellent  genius demanded, he adopted the habit of making most careful models  exactly of the same size as the marble statue was to be. This we have  seen with our own eyes in the Sacristy of S. Lorenzo. Next, when a man  is satisfied with his full-sized model, he must take charcoal, and  sketch out the main view of his figure on the marble in such wise that  it shall be distinctly traced; for he who has not previously settled  his design may sometimes find himself deceived by the chiselling  irons. Michelangelo's method in this matter was the best. He used  first to sketch in the principal aspect; and then to begin work by  removing the surface stone upon that side, just as if he intended to  fashion a figure in half-relief; and thus he went on gradually  uncovering the rounded form.\"    Vasari, speaking of four rough-hewn Captives, possibly the figures now  in a grotto of the Boboli Gardens, says: They are well adapted for  teaching a beginner how to extract statues from the marble without  injury to the stone. The safe method which they illustrate may be  described as follows. You first take a model in wax or some other hard  material, and place it lying in a vessel full of water. The water, by  its nature, presents a level surface; so that, if you gradually lift  the model, the higher parts are first exposed, while the lower parts  remain submerged; and, proceeding thus, the whole round shape at  length appears above the water. Precisely in the same way ought  statues to be hewn out from the marble with the chisel; first  uncovering the highest surfaces, and proceeding to disclose the  lowest. This method was followed by Michelangelo while blocking out  the Captives, and therefore his Excellency the Duke was fain to have  them used as models by the students in his Academy. It need hardly be  remarked that the ingenious process of \"pointing the marble\" by means  of the \"pointing machine\" and \"scale-stones,\" which is at present  universally in use among sculptors, had not been invented in the  sixteenth century.      IV    I cannot omit a rather childish story which Vasari tells about the  David. After it had been placed upon its pedestal before the palace,  and while the scaffolding was still there, Piero Soderini, who loved  and admired Michelangelo, told him that he thought the nose too large.  The sculptor immediately ran up the ladder till he reached a point  upon the level of the giant's shoulder. He then took his hammer and  chisel, and, having concealed some dust of marble in the hollow of his  hand, pretended to work off a portion from the surface of the nose. In  reality he left it as he found it; but Soderini, seeing the marble  dust fall scattering through the air, thought that his hint had been  taken. When, therefore, Michelangelo called down to him, \"Look at it  now!\" Soderini shouted up in reply, \"I am far more pleased with it;  you have given life to the statue.\"    At this time Piero Soderini, a man of excellent parts and sterling  character, though not gifted with that mixture of audacity and cunning  which impressed the Renaissance imagination, was Gonfalonier of the  Republic. He had been elected to the supreme magistracy for life, and  was practically Doge of Florence. His friendship proved on more than  one occasion of some service to Michelangelo; and while the gigantic  David was in progress he gave the sculptor a new commission, the  history of which must now engage us. The Florentine envoys to France  had already written in June 1501 from Lyons, saying that Pierre de  Rohan, Marechal de Gie, who stood high in favour at the court of Louis  XII., greatly desired a copy of the bronze David by Donatello in the  courtyard of the Palazzo Vecchio. He appeared willing to pay for it,  but the envoys thought that he expected to have it as a present. The  French alliance was a matter of the highest importance to Florence,  and at this time the Republic was heavily indebted to the French  crown. Soderini, therefore, decided to comply with the Marshal's  request, and on the 12th of August 1502 Michelangelo undertook to  model a David of two cubits and a quarter within six months. In the  bronze-casting he was assisted by a special master, Benedetto da  Rovezzano. During the next two years a brisk correspondence was kept  up between the envoys and the Signory about the statue, showing the  Marshal's impatience. Meanwhile De Rohan became Duke of Nemours in  1503 by his marriage with a sister of Louis d'Armagnac, and shortly  afterwards he fell into disgrace. Nothing more was to be expected from  him at the court of Blois. But the statue was in progress, and the  question arose to whom it should be given. The choice of the Signory  fell on Florimond Robertet, secretary of finance, whose favour would  be useful to the Florentines in their pecuniary transactions with the  King. A long letter from the envoy, Francesco Pandolfini, in September  1505, shows that Robertet's mind had been sounded on the subject; and  we gather from a minute of the Signory, dated November 6, 1508, that  at last the bronze David, weighing about 800 pounds, had been \"packed  in the name of God\" and sent to Signa on its way to Leghorn. Robertet  received it in due course, and placed it in the courtyard of his  chateau of Bury, near Blois. Here it remained for more than a century,  when it was removed to the chateau of Villeroy. There it disappeared.  We possess, however, a fine pen-and-ink drawing by the hand of  Michelangelo, which may well have been a design for this second David.  The muscular and naked youth, not a mere lad like the colossal statue,  stands firmly posed upon his left leg with the trunk thrown boldly  back. His right foot rests on the gigantic head of Goliath, and his  left hand, twisted back upon the buttock, holds what seems meant for  the sling. We see here what Michelangelo's conception of an ideal  David would have been when working under conditions more favourable  than the damaged block afforded.

For it was the man Foggatt who made a  felon of my father before the eyes of the world, and killed him with  shame. It was he who murdered my mother, and none the less murdered her  because she died of a broken heart. That he was also a thief and a  hypocrite might have concerned me little but for that.    \"Of my father I remember very little. He must, I fear, have been a weak  and incapable man in many respects. He had no business abilities--in fact,  was quite unable to understand the complicated business matters in which  he largely dealt. Foggatt was a consummate master of all those arts of  financial jugglery that make so many fortunes, and ruin so many others, in  matters of company promoting, stocks, and shares. He was unable to  exercise them, however, because of a great financial disaster in which he  had been mixed up a few years before, and which made his name one to be  avoided in future. In these circumstances he made a sort of secret and  informal partnership with my father, who, ostensibly alone in the  business, acted throughout on the directions of Foggatt, understanding as  little what he did, poor, simple man, as a schoolboy would have done. The  transactions carried on went from small to large, and, unhappily from  honorable to dishonorable. My father relied on the superior abilities of  Foggatt with an absolute trust, carrying out each day the directions given  him privately the previous evening, buying, selling, printing  prospectuses, signing whatever had to be signed, all with sole  responsibility and as sole partner, while Foggatt, behind the scenes  absorbed the larger share of the profits. In brief, my unhappy and foolish  father was a mere tool in the hands of the cunning scoundrel who pulled  all the wires of the business, himself unseen and irresponsible. At last  three companies, for the promotion of which my father was responsible,  came to grief in a heap. Fraud was written large over all their history,  and, while Foggatt retired with his plunder, my father was left to meet  ruin, disgrace, and imprisonment. From beginning to end he, and he only,  was responsible. There was no shred of evidence to connect Foggatt with  the matter, and no means of escape from the net drawn about my father. He  lived through three years of imprisonment, and then, entirely abandoned by  the man who had made use of his simplicity, he died--of nothing but shame  and a broken heart.    \"Of this I knew nothing at the time. Again and again, as a small boy, I  remember asking of my mother why I had no father at home, as other boys  had--unconscious of the stab I thus inflicted on her gentle heart. Of her  my earliest, as well as my latest, memory is that of a pale, weeping  woman, who grudged to let me out of her sight.    \"Little by little I learned the whole cause of my mother's grief, for she  had no other confidant, and I fear my character developed early, for my  first coherent remembrance of the matter is that of a childish design to  take a table-knife and kill the bad man who had made my father die in  prison and caused my mother to cry.    \"One thing, however, I never knew--the name of that bad man. Again and  again, as I grew older, I demanded to know, but my mother always withheld  it from me, with a gentle reminder that vengeance was for a greater hand  than mine.    \"I was seventeen years of age when my mother died. I believe that nothing  but her strong attachment to myself and her desire to see me safely  started in life kept her alive so long. Then I found that through all  those years of narrowed means she had contrived to scrape and save a  little money--sufficient, as it afterward proved, to see me through the  examinations for entrance to my profession, with the generous assistance  of my father's old legal advisers, who gave me my articles, and who have  all along treated me with extreme kindness.    \"For most of the succeeding years my life does not concern the matter in  hand. I was a lawyer's clerk in my benefactors' service, and afterward a  qualified man among their assistants. All through the firm were careful,  in pursuance of my poor mother's wishes, that I should not learn the name  or whereabouts of the man who had wrecked her life and my father's. I  first met the man himself at the Clifton Club, where I had gone with an  acquaintance who was a member. It was not till afterward that I understood  his curious awkwardness on that occasion. A week later I called (as I had  frequently done) at the building in which your office is situated, on  business with a solicitor who has an office on the floor above your own.  On the stairs I almost ran against Mr. Foggatt. He started and turned  pale, exhibiting signs of alarm that I could not understand, and asked me  if I wished to see him.    \"'No,' I replied, 'I didn't know you lived here. I am after somebody else  just now. Aren't you well?'    \"He looked at me rather doubtfully, and said he was _not_ very well.    \"I met him twice or thrice after that, and on each occasion his manner  grew more friendly, in a servile, flattering, and mean sort of way--a  thing unpleasant enough in anybody, but doubly so in the intercourse of a  man with another young enough to be his own son. Still, of course, I  treated the man civilly enough. On one occasion he asked me into his rooms  to look at a rather fine picture he had lately bought, and observed  casually, lifting a large revolver from the mantel-piece:    \"'You see, I am prepared for any unwelcome visitors to my little den! He!  He!' Conceiving him, of course, to refer to burglars, I could not help  wondering at the forced and hollow character of his laugh. As we went down  the stairs he said: 'I think we know one another pretty well now, Mr.  Mason, eh? And if I could do anything to advance your professional  prospects, I should be glad of the chance, of course. I understand the  struggles of a young professional man--he! he!' It was the forced laugh  again, and the man spoke nervously. 'I think,' he added, 'that if you will  drop in to-morrow evening, perhaps I may have a little proposal to make.  Will you?'    \"I assented, wondering what this proposal could be. Perhaps this eccentric  old gentleman was a good fellow, after all, anxious to do me a good turn,  and his awkwardness was nothing but a natural delicacy in breaking the  ice. I was not so flush of good friends as to be willing to lose one. He  might be desirous of putting business in my way.    \"I went, and was received with cordiality that even then seemed a little  over-effusive. We sat and talked of one thing and another for a long  while, and I began to wonder when Mr. Foggatt was coming to the point that  most interested me. Several times he invited me to drink and smoke, but  long usage to athletic training has given me a distaste for both  practices, and I declined. At last he began to talk about myself. He was  afraid that my professional prospects in this country were not great, but  he had heard that in some of the colonies--South Africa, for  example--young lawyers had brilliant opportunities.    \"'If you'd like to go there,' he said, 'I've no doubt, with a little  capital, a clever man like you could get a grand practice together very  soon. Or you might buy a share in some good established practice. I should  be glad to let you have L500, or even a little more, if that wouldn't  satisfy you, and----'    \"I stood aghast. Why should this man, almost a stranger, offer me L500, or  even more, 'if that wouldn't satisfy' me? What claim had I on him? It was  very generous of him, of course, but out of the question. I was, at least,  a gentleman, and had a gentleman's self-respect. Meanwhile, he had gone  maundering on, in a halting sort of way, and presently let slip a sentence  that struck me like a blow between the eyes.    \"'I shouldn't like you to bear ill-will because of what has happened in  the past,' he said. 'Your late--your late lamented mother--I'm afraid--she  had unworthy suspicions--I'm sure--it was best for all parties--your  father always appreciated----'    \"I set back my chair and stood erect before him. This groveling wretch,  forcing the words through his dry lips, was the thief who had made another  of my father and had brought to miserable ends the lives of both my  parents! Everything was clear. The creature went in fear of me, never  imagining that I did not know him, and sought to buy me off--to buy me  from the remembrance of my dead mother's broken heart for L500--L500 that  he had made my father steal for him! I said not a word. But the memory of  all my mother's bitter years, and a savage sense of this crowning insult  to myself, took a hold upon me, and I was a tiger. Even then I verily  believe that one word of repentance, one tone of honest remorse, would  have saved him. But he drooped his eyes, snuffled excuses, and stammered  of 'unworthy suspicions' and 'no ill-will.' I let him stammer. Presently  he looked up and saw my face; and fell back in his chair, sick with  terror. I snatched the pistol from the mantel-piece, and, thrusting it in  his face, shot him where he sat.    \"My subsequent coolness and quietness surprise me now. I took my hat and  stepped toward the door. But there were voices on the stairs. The door was  locked on the inside, and I left it so. I went back and quietly opened a  window. Below was a clear drop into darkness, and above was plain wall;  but away to one side, where the slope of the gable sprang from the roof,  an iron gutter ended, supported by a strong bracket. It was the only way.  I got upon the sill and carefully shut the window behind me, for people  were already knocking at the lobby door. From the end of the sill, holding  on by the reveal of the window with one hand, leaning and stretching my  utmost, I caught the gutter, swung myself clear, and scrambled on the  roof. I"]]]
