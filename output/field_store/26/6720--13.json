All colloquial expressions are little foxes that spoil the grapes of  perfect diction, but they are very little foxes; it is the false elegance  of stupid pretentiousness that is an annihilating blight which destroys  root and vine.    In the choice of words, we can hardly find a better guide than the lines  of Alexander Pope:        \"In words, as fashions, the same rule will hold;      Alike fantastic, if too new, or old:      Be not the first by whom the new are tried,      Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.\"      =PRONUNCIATION=    Traits of pronunciation which are typical of whole sections of the  country, or accents inherited from European parents must not be confused  with crude pronunciations that have their origin in illiteracy. A  gentleman of Irish blood may have a brogue as rich as plum cake, or  another's accent be soft Southern or flat New England, or rolling  Western; and to each of these the utterance of the others may sound too  flat, too soft, too harsh, too refined, or drawled, or clipped short, but  not uncultivated.    To a New York ear, which ought to be fairly unbiased since the New York  accent is a composite of all accents, English women chirrup and twitter.  But the beautifully modulated, clear-clipped enunciation of a cultivated  Englishman, one who can move his jaws and not swallow his words whole,  comes as near to perfection in English as the diction of the Comedie  Francaise comes to perfection in French.    The Boston accent is very crisp and in places suggestive of the best  English but the vowels are so curiously flattened that the speech has a  saltless effect. There is no rhyming word as flat as the way they say  \"heart\"--\"haht.\" And \"bone\" and \"coat\"--\"bawn,\" \"cawt,\" to rhyme with awe!    Then South, there is too much salt--rather too much sugar. Every one's  mouth seems full of it, with \"I\" turned to \"ah\" and every staccato a  drawl. But the voices are full of sweetness and music unknown north of the  Potomac.    The Pennsylvania burr is perhaps the mother of the Western one. It is  strong enough to have mothered all the r's in the wor-r-rld!  Philadelphia's \"haow\" and \"caow\" for \"how\" and \"cow,\" and \"me\" for \"my\" is  quite as bad as the \"water-r\" and \"thot\" of the West.    N'Yawk is supposed to say \"yeh\" and \"Omurica\" and \"Toosdeh,\" and  \"puddin'.\" Probably five per cent. of it does, but as a whole it has no  accent, since it is a composite of all in one.    In best New York society there is perhaps a generally accepted  pronunciation which seems chiefly an elimination of the accents of other  sections. Probably that is what all people think of their own  pronunciation. Or do they not know, whether their inflection is right or  wrong? Nothing should be simpler to determine. If they pronounce according  to a standard dictionary, they are correct; if they don't, they have an  \"accent\" or are ignorant; it is for them to determine which. Such  differences as between saying wash or wawsh, ad_ver_tisement or  adver_tise_ment are of small importance. But no one who makes the least  pretence of being a person of education says: kep for kept, genelmun or  gempmun or laydee, vawde-vil, or eye-talian.      =HOW TO CULTIVATE AN AGREEABLE SPEECH=    First of all, remember that while affectation is odious, crudeness must be  overcome. A low voice is always pleasing, not whispered or murmured, but  low in pitch. Do not talk at the top of your head, nor at the top of your  lungs. Do not slur whole sentences together; on the other hand, do not  pronounce as though each syllable were a separate tongue and lip exercise.    As a nation we do not talk so much too fast, as too loud. Tens of  thousands twang and slur and shout and burr! Many of us drawl and many  others of us race tongues and breath at full speed, but, as already said,  the speed of our speech does not matter so much. Pitch of voice matters  very much and so does pronunciation--enunciation is not so  essential--except to one who speaks in public.    Enunciation means the articulation of whatever you have to say distinctly  and clearly. Pronunciation is the proper sounding of consonants, vowels  and the accentuation of each syllable.    There is no better way to cultivate a perfect pronunciation; apart from  association with cultivated people, than by getting a small pronouncing  dictionary of words in ordinary use, and reading it word by word, marking  and studying any that you use frequently and mispronounce. When you know  them, then read any book at random slowly aloud to yourself, very  carefully pronouncing each word. The consciousness of this exercise may  make you stilted in conversation at first, but by and by the \"sense\" or  \"impulse\" to speak correctly will come.    This is a method that has been followed by many men handicapped in youth  through lack of education, who have become prominent in public life, and  by many women, who likewise handicapped by circumstances, have not only  made possible a creditable position for themselves, but have then given  their children the inestimable advantage of learning their mother tongue  correctly at their mother's knee.          CHAPTER IX    ONE'S POSITION IN THE COMMUNITY      =THE CHOICE=    First of all, it is necessary to decide what one's personal idea of  position is, whether this word suggests merely a social one, comprising a  large or an exclusive acquaintance and leadership in social gaiety, or  position established upon the foundation of communal consequence, which  may, or may not, include great social gaiety. In other words, you who are  establishing yourself, either as a young husband or a stranger, would you,  if you could have your wish granted by a genie, choose to have the  populace look upon you askance and in awe, because of your wealth and  elegance, or would you wish to be loved, not as a power conferring favors  which belong really to the first picture, but as a fellow-being with an  understanding heart? The granting of either wish is not a bit beyond the  possibilities of anyone. It is merely a question of depositing securities  of value in the bank of life.      =THE BANK OF LIFE=    Life, whether social or business, is a bank in which you deposit certain  funds of character, intellect and heart; or other funds of egotism,  hard-heartedness and unconcern; or deposit--nothing! And the bank honors  your deposit, and no more. In other words, you can draw nothing out but  what you have put in.    If your community is to give you admiration and honor, it is merely  necessary to be admirable and honorable. The more you put in, the more  will be paid out to you. It is too trite to put on paper! But it is  astonishing, isn't it, how many people who are depositing nothing  whatever, expect to be paid in admiration and respect?    A man of really high position is always a great citizen first and above  all. Otherwise he is a hollow puppet whether he is a millionaire or has  scarcely a dime to bless himself with. In the same way, a woman's social  position that is built on sham, vanity, and selfishness, is like one of  the buildings at an exposition; effective at first sight, but bound when  slightly weather-beaten to show stucco and glue.    It would be very presumptuous to attempt to tell any man how to acquire  the highest position in his community, especially as the answer is written  in his heart, his intellect, his altruistic sympathy, and his ardent civic  pride. A subject, however, that is not so serious or over-aweing, and  which can perhaps have directions written for it, is the lesser ambition  of acquiring a social position.      =TAKING OR ACQUIRING A SOCIAL POSITION=    A bride whose family or family-in-law has social position has merely to  take that which is hers by inheritance; but a stranger who comes to live  in a new place, or one who has always lived in a community but unknown to  society, have both to acquire a standing of their own. For example:      =THE BRIDE OF GOOD FAMILY=    The bride of good family need do nothing on her own initiative. After her  marriage when she settles down in her own house or apartment, everyone who  was asked to her wedding breakfast or reception, and even many who were  only bidden to the church, call on her. She keeps their cards, enters them  in a visiting or ordinary alphabetically indexed blank book, and within  two weeks she returns each one of their calls.    As it is etiquette for everyone when calling for the first time on a  bride, to ask if she is in, the bride, in returning her first calls,  should do likewise. As a matter of fact, a bride assumes the intimate  visiting list of both her own and her husband's families, whether they  call on her or not. By and by, if she gives a general tea or ball, she can  invite whom, among them, she wants to. She should not, however, ask any  mere acquaintances of her family to her house, until they have first  invited her and her husband to theirs. But if she would like to invite  intimate friends of her own or of her husband, or of her family, there is  no valid reason why she should not do so.    Usually when a bride and groom return from their wedding trip, all their  personal friends and those of their respective parents, give \"parties\" for  them. And from being seen at one house, they are invited to another. If  they go nowhere, they do not lose position but they are apt to be  overlooked until people remember them by seeing them. But it is not at all  necessary for young people to entertain in order to be asked out a great  deal; they need merely be attractive and have engaging manners to be as  popular as heart could wish. But they must make it a point to be  considerate of everyone and never fail to take the trouble to go up with a  smiling \"How do you do\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14317"],[0,"The Sorcery Club (#14)"],[1,"to come with you to your  house and wait there.\"    The lady protested, and Kelson consented to wait in the street outside  her house, where, eventually, she delivered the money into his hands.    \"I've kept my word,\" she said, \"and if you're half a man you'll keep  yours.\"    Kelson reassured her, and more than pleased with himself, made for the  hotel, where the three of them were now stopping.    This was merely a beginning. Before the day was out he had secured two  more victims. No woman whose character was not without blemish was  safe from him--his wonderful newly acquired gift enabling him to  detect any vice, no matter how snugly hidden. And this wonderful power  of discernment brought with it an expression of mystery and  penetration which, by enhancing the effect of the power, made the  application of it comparatively easy. Kelson had only to glide after  his victim, and with his eyes fixed searchingly on her, to say,  \"Madam, may I have a word with you?\"--and the battle was more than  half won--the women were too fascinated to think of resistance.    For example, shortly after his initial adventure, he saw a very  smartly dressed woman in Van Ness Avenue peep about furtively, and  then stop and speak to a little child, who was walking with its nurse.  Divination at once told him everything--the lady was the mother of the  child, but its father was not her legitimate husband, W.S. Hobson, the  millionaire mine owner.    When Kelson courteously informed her he was in possession of her  secret--a secret she had felt positively certain only one other person  knew, she went the colour of her pea-green sunshade and attempted to  remonstrate. But Kelson's appearance, no less than his marvellous  knowledge of her life, and character dumbfounded her--she was simply  paralysed into admission; and before he left her, Kelson had added  another thousand dollars to his hoard.    That evening, close to the Academy of Science in Market Street, he saw  a lady get out of a taxi and quickly enter a pawnbroker's. Her whole  life at once rose up before him. She was Ella Crockford, the wife of  the Californian Street Sugar King, and, unknown to her husband, she  spent her afternoons at a gambling saloon in Kearney Street, where she  ran through thousands.    She was now about to pledge her husband's latest present to her--a  diamond tiara, one of the most notable pieces of jewellery in the  country--in the hope that she would soon win back sufficient money at  cards to redeem it.    Kelson stopped her as she came out, and in a marvellously few words,  proved to her that he knew everything. Her amazement was beyond  description.    \"You must be a magician,\" she said, \"because I'm certain no one saw me  take my jewel-case out of the drawer--no one was in the room! And as I  put it in my muff immediately, no one could have seen it as I left the  house. Besides, I never told a soul I intended pawning it, so how is  it possible you could know--and be able to repeat the whole of the  conversation I had with Walter Le-Grand, to whom I lost so heavily  last night? Tell me, how do you know all this?\"    But Kelson would tell her nothing--nothing beyond her own sins and  misfortunes.    \"I have nothing to give you,\" she told him. \"I dare not ask my husband  for more money.\"    \"What, nothing!\" Kelson replied, \"When the pawnbroker has just  advanced you fifty thousand dollars. You call that nothing? Be pleased  to give me one thousand, and congratulate yourself that I do not ask  for all your 'nothing.'\" And as neither tears nor prayers had any  effect, she was obliged to pay him the sum he asked.    Flushed and excited with victory, and thinking, perhaps, that he had  done enough for one day, Kelson took his spoils to a bank near the  Palace Hotel, and for the first time in his career opened a banking  account. As he was leaving the building he ran into Hamar, bent on a  similar errand. The two gleefully compared notes.    \"I thought,\" Hamar said, \"my turn would never come, and that I must  have done something to get out of favour with the Unknown; but as I  was sitting in the Pig and Whistle Saloon in Corn Street drinking a  lager, I suddenly felt a peculiar throbbing sensation run up my left  leg into my left hand, and the floor seemed to open up, and I saw deep  below me, in a black pit, a skeleton clutching hold of a linen bag,  full of coins. I could see the gold quite distinctly--Spanish doubles,  none newer than the eighteenth century. I knew then that the Unknown  had not forgotten me. 'Look here, boss,' I said to old man Moss--the  proprietor, you know--'You're a bit of a juggins to go on working with  so much money under here,'--and I pointed to the floor.    \"'I'm surprised at you, Hamar,' Moss said, cocking an eye at me, 'and  lager, too!'    \"'No, old man!' I said, 'I'm not drunk. I'm sober and serious. You've  got a cellar below here, haven't you?'    \"'Well, and what if I have!' Moss retorted, drawing a step closer and  running his eyes carefully over me. 'What if I have! There's no harm  in that, is there?'    \"'You keep all your stock down there,' I went on, 'and more beside. I  can see a hat-pin with a gold nob, that's not your wife's, and a pair  of shoes with dandy silver buckles, that's not intended for your wife,  nohow.'    \"At that Moss made a queer noise in his throat, and I thought he was  going to have a fit. 'What--what the devil are you talking about?' he  gurgled.    \"'I wish I had had you with me--then, Matt, for you could have  doubtless summed up the woman to him--she was a blank to me--I only  divined one had been there. 'Yes, Mr. Mossy,' I said, 'you're a gay  deceiver and no mistake! I know all about it!'    \"'Do you,' he said, eyeing me excitedly. 'Do you know all about it?  I'm not so sure, but in order to avoid running any risks, drop your  voice a bit and have a cocktail with me!'    \"He poured me out one, and I went on softly, 'Well, boss Moss,' I  said, 'we'll leave the female out of the question for the present.  Underneath this cellar of yours, is a pit.'    \"'I'm damned if there is!' Moss snorted; 'leastways, it's the first  I've ever heard of it.'    \"'And in this pit,' I said, 'is the skeleton of a Spanish buccaneer  called Don Guzman, who landed in this port on August 10, 1699, and  after robbing and slicing up a family of the name of Hervada, who  lived on the site of what is now the Copthorne Hotel, was hurrying off  with all their money and jewels, when he fell into a pit, covered with  brambles and briars, and broke his neck.'    \"'And you expect me to believe this cock and bull story,' Moss  growled. 'Being out of a job so long has made you balmy.'    \"'It hasn't made me too balmy not to see through the way you deceive  your wife, Moss,' I said. 'I'll bet she would think me sane enough if  I were to tell her all I know. But I'll spare you if you will take me  into your cellar and help me to do a bit of excavation there. But  promise, mind you, that we will go shares in what we find.'    \"'Oh, I'll promise right enough,' Moss replied. 'I'll promise  anything--if only to keep you from talking such moonshine.'    \"Well, in the end I prevailed upon him to accompany me, and we went  into the cellar--just as I had depicted it--armed with a pick-axe and  crowbar. Moss growling and jeering every step he took, and I, deadly  in earnest.    \"'It's under here,' I said, halting over a flagstone in the corner of  the vault. 'But before we do anything you had better hide that hat-pin  and these shoes, or your missis will find them. She'll hear us  scraping and come to see what's up.'    \"Moss, who was in a vile temper all the time, made a grab at the  things, pricking his finger and swearing horribly. In the meanwhile I  had set to work, and, with his aid, raised the stone. We dug for  pretty nearly an hour, Moss calling upon me all the time to 'chuck  it,' when I suddenly struck something hard--it was the skeleton and  close beside it, was the bag. You should have seen Moss then. He was  simply overcome--called me a wizard, a magician, and heaven alone  knows what, and fairly stood on his head with delight when we opened  the bag, and hundreds of gold coins and precious stones rolled out on  the floor. He wanted to go back on his word then, and only give me a  handful; but I was too smart for him, and swore I would tell his wife  about the girl unless he gave me half. When we were leaving the  cellar, of course, he wanted me to go first, so that he could follow  with the pickaxe, but here again I was too sharp for him--and I got  safely out of the place with my pockets bulging. I went right away to  Prescott's in Clay Street, and let the lot go for three thousand  dollars. I wonder how Curtis has got on!\"    They walked together to the hotel, and found Curtis busily engaged  eating. \"I've worked hard,\" he said, \"and now I'm in for enjoying  myself. I've made them get out a special menu for me, and I'm going to  eat till I can't hold another morsel. I've starved all my life and now  I intend making up for it.\"    \"Been successful?\" Hamar asked, winking at Kelson.    \"Pretty well! Nothing to grumble at,\" Curtis rejoined, pouring himself  out a glass of champagne. \"First of all I went to Simpson's Dive in  Sacramento Street, and started doing the tricks we discovered  yesterday. Not a soul in the place could see through them, and I made  about two hundred dollars before I left. I then had lunch.\"    \"Why you had lunch with us!\" Hamar laughed.    \"Well, can't I have as many lunches as I like?\" Curtis replied. \"I had  lunch, I say, at a place in Market Street, and there I read in a paper  that Peters & Pervis, the tin food people, were offering a prize of  three thousand dollars for a solution to a puzzle contained on the  inside cover of one of their tins. I immediately determined to enter  for it. I bought a tin and saw through the puzzle at once. Bribing a  policeman to go with me to"]]]
