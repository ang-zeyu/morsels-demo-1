My gal nursed missis--let we go.\"    \"Go where?\" demanded Captain Cloud;    \"Back into bondage? Man, you're free\"  \"Well, _let_ we free!\" The Captain's brow  Lowered; the Colonel came--had heard:    \"Pooh! pooh! his simple heart I see--      A faithful servant.--Lady\" (a bow),      \"Mosby's abroad--with us you'll go.    \"Guard! look to your prisoners; back to camp!    The man in the grass--can he mount and away?  Why, how he groans!\" \"Bad inward bruise--  Might lug him along in the ambulance\"    \"Coals to Newcastle! let him stay.      Boots and saddles!--our pains we lose,      Nor care I if Mosby hear the news!\"    But word was sent to a house at hand,    And a flask was left by the hurt one's side.  They seized in that same house a man,  Neutral by day, by night a foe--    So charged his neighbor late, the Guide.      A grudge? Hate will do what it can;      Along he went for a Mosby-man.    No secrets now; the bugle calls;    The open road they take, nor shun  The hill; retrace the weary way.  But one there was who whispered low,    \"This is a feint--we'll back anon;      Young Hair-Brains don't retreat, they say;      A brush with Mosby is the play!\"    They rode till eve. Then on a farm    That lay along a hill-side green,  Bivouacked. Fires were made, and then  Coffee was boiled; a cow was coaxed    And killed, and savory roasts were seen;      And under the lee of a cattle-pen      The guard supped freely with Mosby's men.    The ball was bandied to and fro;    Hits were given and hits were met;  \"Chickamauga, Feds--take off your hat\"  \"But the Fight in the Clouds repaid you, Rebs\"    \"Forgotten about Manassas yet\"      Chatting and chaffing, and tit for tat,      Mosby's clan with the troopers sat.    \"Here comes the moon!\" a captive cried;    \"A song! what say? Archy, my lad\"  Hailing are still one of the clan  (A boyish face with girlish hair),    \"Give us that thing poor Pansy made      Last Year.\" He brightened, and began;      And this was the song of Mosby's man:          _Spring is come; she shows her pass--            Wild violets cool!        South of woods a small close grass--            A vernal wool!        Leaves are a'bud on the sassafras--            They'll soon be full;        Blessings on the friendly screen--        I'm for the South! says the leafage green._          _Robins! fly, and take your fill            Of out-of-doors--        Garden, orchard, meadow, hill,            Barns and bowers;        Take your fill, and have your will--            Virginia's yours!        But, bluebirds! keep away, and fear        The ambuscade in bushes here._    \"A green song that,\" a seargeant said;    \"But where's poor Pansy? gone, I fear\"  \"Ay, mustered out at Ashby's Gap\"  \"I see; now for a live man's song;    Ditty for ditty--prepare to cheer.      My bluebirds, you can fling a cap!      You barehead Mosby-boys--why--clap!\"          _Nine Blue-coats went a-nutting          Slyly in Tennessee--        Not for chestnuts--better than that--          Hugh, you bumble-bee!            Nutting, nutting--            All through the year there's nutting!_          _A tree they spied so yellow,          Rustling in motion queer;        In they fired, and down they dropped--          Butternuts, my dear!            Nutting, nutting--            Who'll 'list to go a-nutting?_    Ah! why should good fellows foemen be?    And who would dream that foes they were--  Larking and singing so friendly then--  A family likeness in every face.    But Captain Cloud made sour demur:      \"Guard! keep your prisoners _in_ the pen,      And let none talk with Mosby's men.\"    That captain was a valorous one    (No irony, but honest truth),  Yet down from his brain cold drops distilled,  Making stalactites in his heart--    A conscientious soul, forsooth;      And with a formal hate was filled      Of Mosby's band; and some he'd killed.    Meantime the lady rueful sat,    Watching the flicker of a fire  Were the Colonel played the outdoor host  In brave old hall of ancient Night.    But ever the dame grew shyer and shyer,      Seeming with private grief engrossed--      Grief far from Mosby, housed or lost.    The ruddy embers showed her pale.    The Soldier did his best devoir:  \"Some coffee?--no?--cracker?--one\"  Cared for her servant--sought to cheer:    \"I know, I know--a cruel war!      But wait--even Mosby'll eat his bun;      The Old Hearth--back to it anon!\"    But cordial words no balm could bring;    She sighed, and kept her inward chafe,  And seemed to hate the voice of glee--  Joyless and tearless. Soon he called    An escort: \"See this lady safe      In yonder house.--Madam, you're free.      And now for Mosby.--Guide! with me.\"    (\"A night-ride, eh?\") \"Tighten your girths!    But, buglers! not a note from you.  Fling more rails on the fires--a blaze\"  (\"Sergeant, a feint--I told you so--    Toward Aldie again. Bivouac, adieu!\")      After the cheery flames they gaze,      Then back for Mosby through the maze.    The moon looked through the trees, and tipped    The scabbards with her elfin beam;  The Leader backward cast his glance,  Proud of the cavalcade that came--    A hundred horses, bay and cream:      \"Major! look how the lads advance--      Mosby we'll have in the ambulance!\"    \"No doubt, no doubt:--was that a hare?--    First catch, then cook; and cook him brown\"  \"Trust me to catch,\" the other cried--  \"The lady's letter!--a dance, man, dance    This night is given in Leesburg town\"      \"He'll be there too!\" wheezed out the Guide;      \"That Mosby loves a dance and ride!\"    \"The lady, ah!--the lady's letter--    A _lady_, then, is in the case\"  Muttered the Major. \"Ay, her aunt  Writes her to come by Friday eve    (To-night), for people of the place,      At Mosby's last fight jubilant,      A party give, though table-cheer be scant.\"    The Major hemmed. \"Then this night-ride    We owe to her?--One lighted house  In a town else dark.--The moths, begar!  Are not quite yet all dead!\" \"How? how\"    \"A mute, meek mournful little mouse!--      Mosby has wiles which subtle are--      But woman's wiles in wiles of war!\"    \"Tut, Major! by what craft or guile--\"    \"Can't tell! but he'll be found in wait.  Softly we enter, say, the town--  Good! pickets post, and all so sure--    When--crack! the rifles from every gate,      The Gray-backs fire--dashes up and down--      Each alley unto Mosby known!\"    \"Now, Major, now--you take dark views    Of a moonlight night.\" \"Well, well, we'll see\"  And smoked as if each whiff were gain.  The other mused; then sudden asked,    \"What would you do in grand decree\"      I'd beat, if I could, Lee's armies--then      Send constables after Mosby's men.\"    \"Ay! ay!--you're odd.\" The moon sailed up;    On through the shadowy land they went.  \"_Names must be made and printed be!_\"  Hummed the blithe Colonel. \"Doc, your flask!    Major, I drink to your good content.      My pipe is out--enough for me!      One's buttons shine--does Mosby see?    \"But what comes here?\" A man from the front    Reported a tree athwart the road.  \"Go round it, then; no time to bide;  All right--go on! Were one to stay    For each distrust of a nervous mood,      Long miles we'd make in this our ride      Through Mosby-land.--Oh! with the Guide!\"    Then sportful to the Surgeon turned:    \"Green sashes hardly serve by night\"  \"Nor bullets nor bottles,\" the Major sighed,  \"Against these moccasin-snakes--such foes    As seldom come to solid fight:      They kill and vanish; through grass they glide;      Devil take Mosby!--\" his horse here shied.    \"Hold! look--the tree, like a dragged balloon;    A globe of leaves--some trickery here;  My nag is right--best now be shy\"  A movement was made, a hubbub and snarl;    Little was plain--they blindly steer.      The Pleiads, as from ambush sly,      Peep out--Mosby's men in the sky!    As restive they turn, how sore they feel,    And cross, and sleepy, and full of spleen,  And curse the war. \"Fools, North and South\"  Said one right out. \"O for a bed!    O now to drop in this woodland green\"      He drops as the syllables leave his mouth--      Mosby speaks from the undergrowth--    Speaks in a volley! out jets the flame!    Men fall from their saddles like plums from trees;  Horses take fright, reins tangle and bind;  \"Steady--Dismount--form--and into the wood\"    They go, but find what scarce can please:      Their steeds have been tied in the field behind,      And Mosby's men are off like the wind.    Sound the recall! vain to pursue--    The enemy scatters in wilds he knows,  To reunite in his own good time;  And, to follow, they need divide--    To come lone and lost on crouching foes:      Maple and hemlock, beech and lime,      Are Mosby's confederates, share the crime.    \"Major,\" burst in a bugler small,    \"The fellow we left in Loudon grass--  Sir slyboots with the inward bruise,  His voice I heard--the very same--    Some watchword in the ambush pass;      Ay, sir, we had him in his shoes--      We caught him--Mosby--but to lose!\"    \"Go, go!--these saddle-dreamers! Well,    And here's another.--Cool, sir, cool\"  \"Major, I saw them mount and sweep,  And one was humped, or I mistake,    And in the skurry dropped his wool\"      \"A wig! go fetch it:--the lads need sleep;      They'll next see Mosby in a sheep!    \"Come, come, fall back! reform yours ranks--    All's jackstraws here! Where's Captain Morn?--  We've parted like boats in a raging tide!  But stay-the Colonel--did he charge?    And comes he there? 'Tis streak of dawn;      Mosby is off, the woods are wide--      Hist! there's a groan--this crazy ride!\"    As they searched for the fallen, the dawn grew chill;    They lay in the dew: \"Ah! hurt much, Mink?  And--yes--the Colonel!\" Dead! but so calm  That death seemed nothing--even death,    The thing we deem every thing heart can think;      Amid wilding roses that shed their balm,      Careless of Mosby"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1239"],[0,"The Spirit of the Border: A Romance of the Early Settlers in the Ohio Valley (#14)"],[1,"can guide you  safely to the Village of Peace it will be they.\"    At this moment Joe saw two men approaching from the fort, and  recognized one of them as Wetzel. He doubted not that the other was  Lord Dunmore's famous guide and hunter, Jonathan Zane. In features  he resembled the colonel, and was as tall as Wetzel, although not so  muscular or wide of chest.    Joe felt the same thrill he had experienced while watching the  frontiersmen at Fort Pitt. Wetzel and Jonathan spoke a word to  Colonel Zane and then stepped aside. The hunters stood lithe and  erect, with the easy, graceful poise of Indians.    \"We'll take two canoes, day after to-morrow,\" said Jonathan,  decisively, to Colonel Zane. \"Have you a rifle for Wetzel? The  Delawares got his.\"    Colonel Zane pondered over the question; rifles were not scarce at  the fort, but a weapon that Wetzel would use was hard to find.    \"The hunter may have my rifle,\" said the old missionary. \"I have no  use for a weapon with which to destroy God's creatures. My brother  was a frontiersman; he left this rifle to me. I remember hearing him  say once that if a man knew exactly the weight of lead and powder  needed, it would shoot absolutely true.\"    He went into the cabin, and presently came out with a long object  wrapped in linsey cloths. Unwinding the coverings, he brought to  view a rifle, the proportions of which caused Jonathan's eyes to  glisten, and brought an exclamation from Colonel Zane. Wetzel  balanced the gun in his hands. It was fully six feet long; the  barrel was large, and the dark steel finely polished; the stock was  black walnut, ornamented with silver trimmings. Using Jonathan's  powder-flask and bullet-pouch, Wetzel proceeded to load the weapon.  He poured out a quantity of powder into the palm of his hand,  performing the action quickly and dexterously, but was so slow while  measuring it that Joe wondered if he were counting the grains. Next  he selected a bullet out of a dozen which Jonathan held toward him.  He examined it carefully and tried it in the muzzle of the rifle.  Evidently it did not please him, for he took another. Finally he  scraped a bullet with his knife, and placing it in the center of a  small linsey rag, deftly forced it down. He adjusted the flint,  dropped a few grains of powder in the pan, and then looked around  for a mark at which to shoot.    Joe observed that the hunters and Colonel Zane were as serious  regarding the work as if at that moment some important issue  depended upon the accuracy of the rifle.    \"There, Lew; there's a good shot. It's pretty far, even for you,  when you don't know the gun,\" said Colonel Zane, pointing toward the  river.    Joe saw the end of a log, about the size of a man's head, sticking  out of the water, perhaps an hundred and fifty yards distant. He  thought to hit it would be a fine shot; but was amazed when he heard  Colonel Zane say to several men who had joined the group that Wetzel  intended to shoot at a turtle on the log. By straining his eyes Joe  succeeded in distinguishing a small lump, which he concluded was the  turtle.    Wetzel took a step forward; the long, black rifle was raised with a  stately sweep. The instant it reached a level a thread of flame  burst forth, followed by a peculiarly clear, ringing report.    \"Did he hit?\" asked Colonel Zane, eagerly as a boy.    \"I allow he did,\" answered Jonathan.    \"I'll go and see,\" said Joe. He ran down the bank, along the beach,  and stepped on the log. He saw a turtle about the size of an  ordinary saucer. Picking it up, he saw a bullet-hole in the shell  near the middle. The bullet had gone through the turtle, and it was  quite dead. Joe carried it to the waiting group.    \"I allowed so,\" declared Jonathan.    Wetzel examined the turtle, and turning to the old missionary, said:    \"Your brother spoke the truth, an' I thank you fer the rifle.\"        Chapter VIII.    \"So you want to know all about Wetzel?\" inquired Colonel Zane of  Joe, when, having left Jim and Mr. Wells, they returned to the  cabin.    \"I am immensely interested in him,\" replied Joe.    \"Well, I don't think there's anything singular in that. I know  Wetzel better, perhaps, than any man living; but have seldom talked  about him. He doesn't like it. He is by birth a Virginian; I should  say, forty years old. We were boys together, and and I am a little  beyond that age. He was like any of the lads, except that he  excelled us all in strength and agility. When he was nearly eighteen  years old a band if Indians--Delawares, I think--crossed the border  on a marauding expedition far into Virginia. They burned the old  Wetzel homestead and murdered the father, mother, two sisters, and a  baby brother. The terrible shock nearly killed Lewis, who for a time  was very ill. When he recovered he went in search of his brothers,  Martin and John Wetzel, who were hunting, and brought them back to  their desolated home. Over the ashes of the home and the graves of  the loved ones the brothers swore sleepless and eternal vengeance.  The elder brothers have been devoted all these twenty years and more  to the killing of Indians; but Lewis has been the great foe of the  redman. You have already seen an example of his deeds, and will hear  of more. His name is a household word on the border. Scores of times  he has saved, actually saved, this fort and settlement. His  knowledge of savage ways surpasses by far Boone's, Major  McColloch's, Jonathan's, or any of the hunters'.\"    \"Then hunting Indians is his sole occupation?\"    \"He lives for that purpose alone. He is very seldom in the  settlement. Sometimes he stays here a few days, especially if he is  needed; but usually he roams the forests.\"    \"What did Jeff Lynn mean when he said that some people think Wetzel  is crazy?\"    \"There are many who think the man mad; but I do not. When the  passion for Indian hunting comes upon him he is fierce, almost  frenzied, yet perfectly sane. While here he is quiet, seldom speaks  except when spoken to, and is taciturn with strangers. He often  comes to my cabin and sits beside the fire for hours. I think he  finds pleasure in the conversation and laughter of friends. He is  fond of the children, and would do anything for my sister Betty.\"    \"His life must be lonely and sad,\" remarked Joe.    \"The life of any borderman is that; but Wetzel's is particularly  so.\"    \"What is he called by the Indians?\"    \"They call him Atelang, or, in English, Deathwind.\"    \"By George! That's what Silvertip said in French--'Le Vent de la  Mort.'\"    \"Yes; you have it right. A French fur trader gave Wetzel that name  years ago, and it has clung to him. The Indians say the Deathwind  blows through the forest whenever Wetzel stalks on their trail.\"    \"Colonel Zane, don't you think me superstitious,\" whispered Joe,  leaning toward the colonel, \"but I heard that wind blow through the  forest.\"    \"What!\" ejaculated Colonel Zane. He saw that Joe was in earnest, for  the remembrance of the moan had more than once paled his cheek and  caused beads of perspiration to collect on his brow.    Joe related the circumstances of that night, and at the end of his  narrative Colonel Zane sat silent and thoughtful.    \"You don't really think it was Wetzel who moaned?\" he asked, at  length.    \"No, I don't,\" replied Joe quickly; \"but, Colonel Zane, I heard that  moan as plainly as I can hear your voice. I heard it twice. Now,  what was it?\"    \"Jonathan said the same thing to me once. He had been out hunting  with Wetzel; they separated, and during the night Jonathan heard the  wind. The next day he ran across a dead Indian. He believes Wetzel  makes the noise, and so do the hunters; but I think it is simply the  moan of the night wind through the trees. I have heard it at times,  when my very blood seemingly ran cold.\"    \"I tried to think it was the wind soughing through the pines, but am  afraid I didn't succeed very well. Anyhow, I knew Wetzel instantly,  just as Jeff Lynn said I would. He killed those Indians in an  instant, and he must have an iron arm.\"    \"Wetzel excels in strength and speed any man, red or white, on the  frontier. He can run away from Jonathan, who is as swift as an  Indian. He's stronger than any of the other men. I remember one day  old Hugh Bennet's wagon wheels stuck in a bog down by the creek.  Hugh tried, as several others did, to move the wheels; but they  couldn't be made to budge. Along came Wetzel, pushed away the men,  and lifted the wagon unaided. It would take hours to tell you about  him. In brief, among all the border scouts and hunters Wetzel stands  alone. No wonder the Indians fear him. He is as swift as an eagle,  strong as mountain-ash, keen as a fox, and absolutely tireless and  implacable.\"    \"How long have you been here, Colonel Zane?\"    \"More than twelve years, and it has been one long fight.\"    \"I'm afraid I'm too late for the fun,\" said Joe, with his quiet  laugh.    \"Not by about twelve more years,\" answered Colonel Zane, studying  the expression on Joe's face. \"When I came out here years ago I had  the same adventurous spirit which I see in you. It has been  considerably quelled, however. I have seen many a daring young  fellow get the border fever, and with it his death. Let me advise  you to learn the ways of the hunters; to watch some one skilled in  woodcraft. Perhaps Wetzel himself will take you in hand. I don't  mind saying that he spoke of you to me in a tone I never heard Lew  use before.\"    \"He did?\" questioned Joe, eagerly, flushing with pleasure. \"Do you  think he'd take me out? Dare I ask him?\"    \"Don't be impatient. Perhaps I can arrange it. Come over here now to  Metzar's place. I want to make you acquainted with him. These boys  have all been cutting timber; they've just come in for dinner. Be  easy and quiet with them; then you'll get on.\"    Colonel Zane introduced Joe to five sturdy boys and left him in  their company. Joe sat down "]]]
