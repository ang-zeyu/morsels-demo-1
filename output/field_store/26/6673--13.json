On the contrary we are appealing to that region of the mind  in which is stored the capacity for intuitively apprehending truth. We  are endeavoring to speak in tones which will awaken a similar vibration  in that part of your mentality, and if these vibrations be started into  being, then will you be able to _feel_ and _know_ the truth, and then  will your Intellect eagerly seize upon the new idea that it finds  within itself, and will proceed to apply the same to the various  problems that have been bothering you in the past.    This consciousness of Unity must come from the higher regions of the  mind, for the Intellect alone knows it not,--it is out of its field.  Just as one may not know that the earth is round by means of his senses  which report quite the contrary, but may and does know this truth by  abstract reasoning and higher intellectual effort; so may one know the  truth that All Life is indeed One, at the last, and underlying, by the  higher faculties of the mind, although his senses and ordinary  intellectual processes fail to so inform him. The senses cannot inform  man that the earth is round, _because they cannot see it as a whole,  but only in part_--while the higher reasoning faculties are able to  visualize the earth as a whole, and know it must be round. And the  Intellect, in its ordinary field can see only separateness, and cannot  report Oneness, but the Higher Mind sees Life as a Whole, and knows it  to be One. And it is the Higher Mind that we are trying to bring into  the field of consciousness in the appeal to you in this lesson. We  trust that we may be successful--in fact we _know_ that we shall be so,  in many cases, for we know that the field is ready for the sowing of  the seed--and that the call has been heard, and the message passed on  to us to answer the call--else these words would not have been written.    The consciousness of the Unity of Life is something that must be  experienced before the truth may be realized. It is not necessary for  one to wait until he acquire full Cosmic Consciousness before he may  realize, at least partially, the Oneness of All Life, for he may unfold  gradually into the Cosmic Knowing, experiencing at each stage a fuller  conception of the underlying Unity of Life, in which he is a centre of  consciousness and manifestation. But there must be at least a partial  unfoldment before one is able to _feel_ the sense of Unity. To those  who have not unfolded sufficiently to gain at least a glimmering of the  truth, everything appears separate from every other thing, and there is  no Unity of All. It is as if every leaf on a mighty tree were to  consider itself a being separate and distinct from everything else in  the world, failing to perceive its connection with the branch or limb,  and tree, and its unity in being with every other leaf on the tree.  After a bit the unfolding consciousness of the leaf enables it to  perceive the stem that connects it with the twig. Then it begins to  realize certain relationships, and feels its vital connection with the  twig and the few other leaves attached to the same twig. Later on, it  unfolds sufficiently to perceive that certain other leaf-bearing twigs  are connected with the same branch, and it learns to feel its  relationship with all twigs and leaves springing from that branch. Then  again, a little later on, it begins to realize that other branches  spring from the same limb as its branch, and the sense of relationship  and dawning Unity begins to widen still further. And so it goes on,  until at last, the tiny leaflet realizes that the life of the tree is  the life of all of its parts--limbs, branches, twigs, leaves, blossoms,  fruit, seed, etc., and that it, itself, is but a centre of expression  in the One Life of the tree. Does the leaf feel less important and real  from this discovery? We should say assuredly not, for it must feel that  behind its tiny form and limited strength is the strength and vitality  of the entire organism of the tree. It must know that the tree is ever  at work extracting nourishment from the earth, air, and water, and  transmitting that nourishment to its every part, including our little  friend the leaflet. It knows that the sap will rise in the Spring to  renew the manifestations of life, and it knows that although its leafy  form may wither and die, still the essence of its life--its real  Life--does not die but remains ever active and strong awaiting its  chance for future expression and re-embodiment. Of course this figure  of the leaf and the tree fails us if we attempt to carry it very far,  but it will give us at least a partial idea of the relationship between  the life of the person, and the One Life.    Some of the Oriental teachers have illustrated this idea to their  students by various familiar examples and figures of speech. Some bid  the student hold up his hand, and then point out to him that each  finger is apparently separate and distinct if one does not look down to  where it joins the hand. Each finger, if it had consciousness, might  well argue that it was a separate individual, having no relationship  with any other finger. It might prove this to its own satisfaction, and  to that of its listeners, by showing that it could move itself without  stirring the other fingers. And so long as its consciousness was  confined to its upper two joints it would remain under the illusion of  separateness. But when its consciousness at last permeated the depths  of its being, it would find that it emerged from the same hand from  which also sprung the other fingers, and that its real life and power  was vested in the hand rather than in itself, and that although  apparently separate and independent, it was really but a part of the  hand. And when its consciousness, through the consciousness of the  hand, broadened and widened, it would perceive its relationship with,  and interdependence with, the whole body, and would also recognize the  power of the brain, and its mighty Will.    Another favorite illustration of the Eastern teachers is the stream of  water flowing over a rocky bed. They point to the stream before it  comes to a rocky place, and show the _chela_ (student) that it is One.  Then they will move a little way down the stream and show him how the  rocks and stones divide the stream into countless little streams, each  of which might imagine itself a separate and distinct stream, until  later on it again joins the main united stream, and finds that it was  but a form of expression of the One.    Another illustration that is frequently used by the teachers, is that  which bids the student consider himself as a minute cell, or  \"little-life\" as the Hindus call it, in a body. It may be a cell in the  blood performing the office of a carrier or messenger, or it may be a  working cell in one of the organs of the body; or it may be a thinking  cell in the brain. At any rate, the cell manifests capacity for  thought, action and memory--and a number of secondary attributes quite  wonderful in the way. (See \"_Hatha Yoga_,\" Chapter XVIII.) Each cell  might well consider itself as a separate individual--in a certain sense  it _does_. It has a certain degree of something akin to consciousness,  enabling it to perform its work correctly and properly, and is called  upon at times to manifest something like judgment. It may well be  excused for thinking of itself as a \"person\" having a separate life.  The analogy between its illusions and that of the man when seen by a  Master, is very close. But we know that the life of the cell is merely  a centre of expression of the life of the body--that its consciousness  is merely a part of the consciousness of the mind animating the body.  The cell will die and apparently perish, but the _essence_ of it will  remain in the life of the person whose body it occupied, and nothing  really dies or perishes. Would the cell feel any less real if it knew  that behind its Personality as a cell, there was the Individuality of  the Man--that its Real Self was the Man, not the cell? Of course, even  this figure of speech can be carried only so far, and then must stop,  for the personality of the man, when it is dissolved, leaves behind it  an essence which is called Character, which becomes the property of the  Ego and which accompanies it into after life according to the Law of  Karma, of which we shall speak in future lessons. But back even of  these attributes of Personality, is the Ego which exists in spite of  Personality, and lives on and on throughout many Personalities, and yet  learning the lessons of each, until at last it rises above Personality  and enters into higher sphere of Knowing and Being.    Still another favorite illustration of the Hindu teachers is that of  the sun beating down upon the ocean and causing a portion of the water  to rise in the form of vapor. This vapor forms clouds which spread all  over the earth, and which eventually condense in the form of rain  drops, dew, etc. This rain and dew form streams, rivers, etc., and  sooner or later every drop finds its way back to Mother Ocean which is  its Real Self. Separate though the dewdrop be, yet it is a part of the  Ocean, no matter how far distant it may be, and the attraction of the  Ocean will surely, and without fail, draw it back to its bosom. And the  dewdrop, if it could know the truth, would be so much happier and  stronger, and braver if it could know that it was superior to accident,  time and space, and that it could not escape its own good, and that  nothing could prevent its final triumph and victory when at last \"the  dewdrop glides into the shining sea.\" How cheerfully it could have met  its many changes of form. and the incidents of its journey, if it could  have gotten "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13444"],[0,"Searchlights on Health: The Science of Eugenics (#14)"],[1,", it may be, of infinite mischief to themselves, and  often to others.    On the contrary, a condition of comparative poverty is compatible with  character in its highest form. A man may possess only his industry,  his frugality, his integrity, and yet stand high in the rank of true  manhood. The advice which Burns' father gave him was the best:      \"He bade me act a manly part, though I had ne'er a farthing,    For without an honest, manly heart no man was worth regarding.\"    6. CHARACTER IS PROPERTY.--It is the noblest of possessions. It is an  estate in the general good-will and respect of men; they who invest in  it--though they may not become rich in this world's goods--will find  their reward in esteem and reputation fairly and honorably won. And  it is right that in life good qualities should tell--that industry,  virtue, and goodness should rank the highest--and that the really best  men should be foremost.    7. SIMPLE HONESTY OF PURPOSE.--This in a man goes a long way in life,  if founded on a just estimate of himself and a steady obedience to the  rule he knows and feels to be right. It holds a man straight, gives  him strength and sustenance, and forms a mainspring of vigorous  action. No man is bound to be rich or great--no, nor to be wise--but  every man is bound to be honest and virtuous.    [Illustration]    [Illustration: HOME AMUSEMENTS.]             *       *       *       *       *    FAMILY GOVERNMENT.      1. GENTLENESS MUST CHARACTERIZE EVERY ACT OF AUTHORITY.--The storm of  excitement that may make the child start, bears no relation to actual  obedience. The inner firmness, that sees and feels a moral conviction  and expects obedience, is only disguised and defeated by bluster. The  more calm and direct it is, the greater certainty it has of dominion.    2. FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF SMALL CHILDREN.--For the government of small  children speak only in the authority of love, yet authority, loving  and to be obeyed. The most important lesson to impart is obedience to  authority as authority. The question of salvation with most children  will be settled as soon as they learn to obey parental authority. It  establishes a habit and order of mind that is ready to accept divine  authority. This precludes skepticism and disobedience, and induces  that childlike trust and spirit set forth as a necessary state of  salvation. Children that are never made to obey are left to drift  into the sea of passion where the pressure for surrender only tends to  drive them at greater speed from the haven of safety.    3. HABITS OF SELF-DENIAL.--Form in the child habits of self-denial.  Pampering never matures good character.    4. EMPHASIZE INTEGRITY.--Keep the moral tissues tough in integrity;  then it will hold a hook of obligations when once set in a sure place.  There is nothing more vital. Shape all your experiments to preserve  the integrity. Do not so reward it that it becomes mercenary. Turning  State's evidence is a dangerous experiment in morals. Prevent deceit  from succeeding.    5. GUARD MODESTY.--To be brazen is to imperil some of the best  elements of character. Modesty may be strengthened into a becoming  confidence, but brazen facedness can seldom be toned down into  decency. It requires the miracle of grace.    6. PROTECT PURITY.--Teach your children to loathe impurity. Study  the character of their playmates. Watch their books. Keep them from  corruption at all cost. The groups of youth in the school and in  society, and in business places, seed with improprieties of word and  thought. Never relax your vigilance along this exposed border.    [Illustration: BOTH PUZZLED.]    7. THREATEN THE LEAST POSSIBLE.--In family government threaten the  least possible. Some parents rattle off their commands with penalties  so profusely that there is a steady roar of hostilities about the  child's head. These threats are forgotten by the parent and unheeded  by the child. All government is at an end.    8. DO NOT ENFORCE TOO MANY COMMANDS.--Leave a few things within the  range of the child's knowledge that are not forbidden. Keep your word  good, but do not have too much of it out to be redeemed.    9. PUNISH AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE.--Sometimes punishment is necessary,  but the less it is resorted to the better.    10. NEVER PUNISH IN A PASSION.--Wrath only becomes cruelty. There is  no moral power in it. When you seem to be angry you can do no good.    11. BRUTISH VIOLENCE ONLY MULTIPLIES OFFENDERS.--Striking and beating  the body seldom reaches the soul. Fear and hatred beget rebellion.    12. PUNISH PRIVATELY.--Avoid punishments that break down self-respect.  Striking the body produces shame and indignation. It is enough for the  other children to know that discipline is being administered.    13. NEVER STOP SHORT OF SUCCESS.--When the child is not conquered the  punishment has been worse than wasted. Reach the point where neither  wrath nor sullenness remain. By firm persistency and persuasion  require an open look of recognition and peace. It is only evil to stir  up the devil unless he is cast out. Ordinarily one complete victory  will last a child for a lifetime. But if the child relapses, repeat  the dose with proper accompaniments.    14. DO NOT REQUIRE CHILDREN TO COMPLAIN OF THEMSELVES FOR PARDON.--It  begets either sycophants or liars. It is the part of the government to  detect offences. It reverses the order of matters to shirk this duty.    15. GRADE AUTHORITY UP TO LIBERTY.--The growing child must have  experiments of freedom. Lead him gently into the family. Counsel  with him. Let him plan as he can. By and by he has the confidence of  courage without the danger of exposures.    16. RESPECT.--Parents must respect each other. Undermining either  undermines both. Always govern in the spirit of love.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]             *       *       *       *       *    CONVERSATION.      Some men are very entertaining for a first interview, but after that  they are exhausted, and run out; on a second meeting we shall find  them very flat and monotonous; like hand-organs, we have heard all  their tunes.--COULTON.    He who sedulously attends, pointedly asks, calmly speaks, coolly  answers, and ceases when he has no more to say, is in possession of  some of the best requisites of man.--LAVATER.    Beauty is never so lovely as when adorned with the smile, and  conversation never sits easier upon us than when we know and  then discharge ourselves in a symphony of Laughter, which may not  improperly be called the Chorus of Conversation.--STEELE.    The first ingredient in Conversation is Truth, the next Good Sense,  the third Good Humor, and the fourth Wit.--SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE.      HOME LESSONS IN CONVERSATION.    Say nothing unpleasant when it can be avoided.    Avoid satire and sarcasm.    Never repeat a word that was not intended for repetition.    Cultivate the supreme wisdom, which consists less in saying what ought  to be said than in not saying what ought not to be said.    Often cultivate \"flashes of silence.\"    It is the larger half of the conversation to listen well.    Listen to others patiently, especially the poor.    Sharp sayings are an evidence of low breeding.    Shun faultfindings and faultfinders.    Never utter an uncomplimentary word against anyone.    Compliments delicately hinted and sincerely intended are a grace in  conversation.    Commendation of gifts and cleverness properly put are in good taste,  but praise of beauty is offensive.    Repeating kind expressions is proper.    Compliments given in a joke may be gratefully received in earnest.    The manner and tone are important parts of a compliment.    Avoid egotism.    Don't talk of yourself, or of your friends or your deeds.    Give no sign that you appreciate your own merits.    Do not become a distributer of the small talk of a community. The  smiles of your auditors do not mean respect.    Avoid giving the impression of one filled with \"suppressed egotism.\"    Never mention your own peculiarities; for culture destroys vanity.    Avoid exaggeration.    Do not be too positive.    Do not talk of display oratory.    Do not try to lead in conversation looking around to enforce silence.    Lay aside affected, silly etiquette for the natural dictates of the  heart.    Direct the conversation where others can join with you and impart to  you useful information.    Avoid oddity. Eccentricity is shallow vanity.    Be modest.    Be what you wish to seem.    Avoid repeating a brilliant or clever saying.    [Illustration: THINKING ONLY OF DRESS.]    If you find bashfulness or embarrassment coming upon you, do or say  something at once. The commonest matter gently stated is better than  an embarrassing silence. Sometimes changing your position, or looking  into a book for a moment may relieve your embarrassment, and dispel  any settling stiffness.    Avoid telling many stories, or repeating a story more than once in the  same company.    Never treat any one as if you simply wanted him to tell stories.  People laugh and despise such a one.    Never tell a coarse story. No wit or preface can make it excusable.    Tell a story, if at all, only as an illustration, and not for itself.  Tell it accurately.    Be careful in asking questions for the purpose of starting  conversation or drawing out a person, not to be rude or intrusive.    Never take liberties by staring, or by any rudeness.    Never infringe upon any established regulations among strangers.    Do not always prove yourself to be the one in the right. The right  will appear. You need only give it a chance.    Avoid argument in conversation. It is discourteous to your host.    Cultivate paradoxes in conversation with your peers. They add interest  to common-place matters. To strike the harmless faith of ordinary  people in any public idol is waste, but such a movement with those  able to reply is better.    Never discourse upon your ailments.    Never use "]]]
