While we ate a great crowd of  Boers gathered around the train and peered curiously in at the windows.  One of them was a doctor, who, noticing that my hand was bound up,  inquired whether I were wounded. The cut caused by the splinter of  bullet was insignificant, but since it was ragged and had received no  attention for two days it had begun to fester. I therefore showed him my  hand, and he immediately bustled off to get bandages and hot water and  what not, with which, amid the approving grins of the rough fellows who  thronged the platform, he soon bound me up very correctly.    The train whereby we were to travel was required for other business  besides; and I noticed about a hundred Boers embarking with their horses  in a dozen large cattle trucks behind the engine. At or about noon we  steamed off, moving slowly along the line, and Captain Haldane pointed  out to me the ridge of Elandslaagte, and gave me some further account of  that successful action and of the great skill with which Hamilton had  directed the infantry attack. The two Boers who were guarding us  listened with great interest, but the single observation they made was  that we had only to fight Germans and Hollanders at Elandslaagte. 'If  these had been veldt Boers in front of you----' My companion replied  that even then the Gordon Highlanders might have made some progress.  Whereat both Boers laughed softly and shook their heads with the air of  a wiseacre, saying, 'You will know better when you're as old as me,' a  remark I constantly endure from very worthy people.    Two stations beyond Elandslaagte the Boer commando, or portion of  commando, left the train, and the care and thought that had been  lavished on the military arrangements were very evident. All the  stations on the line were fitted with special platforms three or four  hundred yards long, consisting of earth embankments revetted with wood  towards the line and sloping to the ground on the other side. The  horsemen were thereby enabled to ride their horses out of the trucks,  and in a few minutes all were cantering away across the plain. One of  the Boer guards noticed the attention I paid to these arrangements. 'It  is in case we have to go back quickly to the Biggarsberg or Laing's  Nek,' he explained. As we travelled on I gradually fell into  conversation with this man. His name, he told me, was Spaarwater, which  he pronounced _Spare-_water. He was a farmer from the Ermolo district.  In times of peace he paid little or no taxes. For the last four years he  had escaped altogether. The Field Cornet, he remarked, was a friend of  his. But for such advantages he lay under the obligation to serve  without pay in war-time, providing horse, forage, and provisions. He was  a polite, meek-mannered little man, very anxious in all the discussion  to say nothing that could hurt the feelings of his prisoners, and I took  a great liking to him. He had fought at Dundee. 'That,' he said, 'was a  terrible battle. Your artillery? _Bang! bang! bang_! came the shells all  round us. And the bullets! _Whew_, don't tell me the soldiers can't  shoot. They shoot jolly well, old chappie. I, too, can shoot. I can hit  a bottle six times out of seven at a hundred yards, but when there is a  battle then I do not shoot so well.'    The other man, who understood a little English, grinned at this, and  muttered something in Dutch.    'What does he say?' I inquired.    'He says \"He too,\"' replied Spaarwater. 'Besides, we cannot see your  soldiers. At Dundee I was looking down the hill and saw nothing except  rows of black boots marching and the black belts of one of the  regiments.'    'But,' I said, 'you managed to hit some of them after all.'    He smiled, 'Ah, yes, we are lucky, and God is on our side. Why, after  Dundee, when we were retiring, we had to cross a great open plain, never  even an ant-hill, and you had put twelve great cannons--I counted  them--and Maxims as well, to shoot us as we went; but not one fired a  shot. Was it not God's hand that stopped them? After that we knew.'    I said: 'Of course the guns did not fire, because you had raised the  white flag.'    'Yes,' he answered, 'to ask for armistice, but not to give in. We are  not going to give in yet. Besides, we have heard that your Lancers  speared our wounded at Elandslaagte.' We were getting on dangerous  ground. He hastened to turn the subject. 'It's all those lying  newspapers that spread these reports on both sides, just like the  capitalists made the war by lying.'    A little further on the ticket collector came to join in the  conversation. He was a Hollander, and very eloquent.    'Why should you English take this country away from us?' he asked, and  the silent Boer chimed in broken English. 'Are not our farms our own?  Why must we fight for them?'    I endeavoured to explain the ground of our quarrel. 'After all British  government is not a tyranny.'    'It's no good for a working-man,' said the ticket collector; 'look at  Kimberley. Kimberley was a good place to live in before the capitalists  collared it. Look at it now. Look at me. What are my wages?'    I forget what he said they were, but they were extraordinary wages for a  ticket collector.    'Do you suppose I should get such wages under the English Government?'    I said 'No.'    'There you are,' he said. 'No English Government for me,' and added  inconsequently, 'We fight for our freedom.'    Now I thought I had an argument that would tell. I turned th the farmer,  who had been listening approvingly:    'Those are very good wages.'    'Ah, yes.'    'Where does the money come from?'    'Oh, from the taxes ... and from the railroad.'    'Well, now, you send a good deal of your produce by rail, I suppose?'    'Ya' (an occasional lapse into Dutch).    'Don't you find the rates very high?'    'Ya, ya,' said both the Boers together; 'very high.'    'That is because he' (pointing to the ticket collector) 'is getting such  good wages. You are paying them.' At this they both laughed heartily,  and Spaarwater said that that was quite true, and that the rates were  too high.    'Under the English Government,' I said, 'he will not get such high  wages; you will not have to pay such high rates.'    They received the conclusion in silence. Then Spaarwater said, 'Yes, but  we shall have to pay a tribute to your Queen.'    'Does Cape Colony?' I asked.    'Well, what about that ironclad?'    'A present, a free-will offering because they are contented--as you will  be some day--under our flag.'    'No, no, old chappie, we don't want your flag; we want to be left alone.  We are free, you are not free.'    'How do you mean \"not free\"?'    'Well, is it right that a dirty Kaffir should walk on the  pavement--without a pass too? That's what they do in your British  Colonies. Brother! Equal! Ugh! Free! Not a bit. We know how to treat  Kaffirs.'    Probing at random I had touched a very sensitive nerve. We had got down  from underneath the political and reached the social. What is the true  and original root of Dutch aversion to British rule? It is not Slagters  Nek, nor Broomplatz, nor Majuba, nor the Jameson Raid. Those incidents  only fostered its growth. It is the abiding fear and hatred of the  movement that seeks to place the native on a level with the white man.  British government is associated in the Boer farmer's mind with violent  social revolution. Black is to be proclaimed the same as white. The  servant is to be raised against the master; the Kaffir is to be declared  the brother of the European, to be constituted his legal equal, to be  armed with political rights. The dominant race is to be deprived of  their superiority; nor is a tigress robbed of her cubs more furious than  is the Boer at this prospect.    I mused on the tangled skein of politics and party principles. This  Boer farmer was a very typical character, and represented to my mind all  that was best and noblest in the African Dutch character. Supposing he  had been conducting Mr. Morley to Pretoria, not as a prisoner of war,  but as an honoured guest, instead of me, what would their conversation  have been? How excellently they would have agreed on the general  question of the war! I could imagine the farmer purring with delight as  his distinguished charge dilated in polished sentences upon liberty and  the rights of nationalities. Both would together have bewailed the  horrors of war and the crime of aggression; both would have condemned  the tendencies of modern Imperialism and Capitalism; both would have  been in complete accord whenever the names of Rhodes, Chamberlain, or  Milner were mentioned. And the spectacle of this citizen soldier, called  reluctant, yet not unwilling, from the quiet life of his farm to fight  bravely in defence of the soil on which he lived, which his fathers had  won by all manner of suffering and peril, and to preserve the  independence which was his pride and joy, against great enemies of  regulars--surely that would have drawn the most earnest sympathy of the  eminent idealist. And then suddenly a change, a jarring note in the duet  of agreement.    '_We_ know how to treat Kaffirs in _this_ country. Fancy letting the  black filth walk on the pavement!'    And after that no more agreement: but argument growing keener and  keener; gulf widening every moment.    'Educate a Kaffir! Ah, that's you English all over. No, no, old chappie.  We educate 'em with a stick. Treat 'em with humanity and  consideration--I like that. They were put here by the God Almighty to  work for us. We'll stand no damned nonsense from them. We'll keep them  in their proper places. What do you think? Insist on their proper  treatment will you? Ah, that's what we're going to see about now. We'll  settle whether you English are to interfere with us before this war is  over.'    The afternoon dragged away before the train passed near Dundee.  Lieutenant Frankland had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14431"],[0,"International Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science, Vol. 1, (#14)"],[1,"to give the work a  thorough review, and examine it in detail. Ill health alone prevented me  from so doing. At the time I made the hasty sketch I sent you, I was so  ill as to be hardly able to see the paper on which I wrote, and I  finished it in a state of complete exhaustion. I have not, therefore,  done anything like justice to the book, and I am vexed about the matter,  for Mr. Kennedy has proved himself a kind friend to me in every respect,  and I am sincerely grateful to him for many acts of generosity and  attention. You ask me if I am perfectly, satisfied with your course. I  reply that I am--entirely. My poor services are not worth what you give  me for them.\"    About a month afterward he wrote:    \"You ask me if I would be willing to come on to Richmond if you should  have occasion, for my services during the coming winter. I reply that  nothing would give me greater pleasure. I have been desirous for some  time past of paying a visit to Richmond, and would be glad of an  reasonable excuse for so doing. Indeed I am anxious to settle myself in  that city, and if, by any chance, you hear of a situation likely to suit  me, I would gladly accept it, were the salary even the merest trifle. I  should, indeed, feel myself greatly indebted to you if through your means  I could accomplish this object. What you say in the conclusion of your  letter, in relation to the supervision of proof-sheets, gives me reason  to hope that possibly you might find something for me to do in your  office. If so I should be very glad--for at present only a very small  portion of my time is employed.\"    He continued in Baltimore till September. In this period he wrote several  long reviews, which for the most part were rather abstracts of works than  critical discussions, and published, with others, \"Hans Phall,\" a story  in some respects very similar to Mr. Locke's celebrated account of  Herschel's Discoveries in the Moon. At first he appears to have been ill  satisfied with Richmond, or with his duties, for in two or three weeks  after his removal to that city we find Mr. Kennedy writing to him:    \"I am sorry to see you in such plight as your letter shows you in. It is  strange that just at this time, when everybody is praising you, and when  fortune is beginning to smile upon your hitherto wretched circumstances,  you should be invaded by those blue devils. It belongs, however, to your  age and temper to be thus buffeted--but be assured, it only wants a  little resolution to master the adversary forever. You will doubtless do  well henceforth in literature, and add to your _comforts_ as well as to  your reputation, which it gives me great pleasure to assure you is  everywhere rising in popular esteem.\"    But he could not bear his good fortune. On receiving a month's salary he  gave himself up to habits which only necessity had restrained at  Baltimore. For a week he was in a condition of brutish drunkenness, and  Mr. White dismissed him. When he became sober, however, he had no  recourse but in reconciliation, and he wrote letters and induced  acquaintances to call upon Mr. White with professions of repentance and  promises of reformation. With his usual considerate and judicious  kindness that gentleman answered him:    \"_My dear Edgar_: I cannot address you in such language as this occasion  and my feelings demand: I must be content to speak to you in my plain  way. That you are sincere in all your promises I firmly believe. But when  you once again tread these streets, I have my fears that your resolutions  will fail, and that you will again drink till your senses are lost. If  you rely on your strength you are gone. Unless you look to your Maker for  help you will not be safe. How much I regretted parting from you is known  to Him only and myself. I had become attached to you; I am still; and I  would willingly say return, did not a knowledge of your past life make me  dread a speedy renewal of our separation. If you would make yourself  contented with quarters in my house, or with any other private family,  where liquor is not used, I should think there was some hope for you.  But, if you go to a tavern, or to any place where it is used at table,  you are not safe. You have fine talents, Edgar, and you ought to have  them respected, as well as yourself. Learn to respect yourself, and you  will soon find that you are respected. Separate yourself from the bottle,  and from bottle companions, forever. Tell me if you can and will do so.  If you again become an assistant in my office, it must be understood that  all engagements on my part cease the moment you get drunk. I am your true  friend, T. W. W.\"    A new contract was arranged, but Poe's irregularities frequently  interrupted the kindness and finally exhausted the patience of his  generous though methodical employer, and in the number of the \"Messenger\"  for January, 1837 he thus took leave of its readers:    \"Mr. Poe's attention being called in another direction, he will decline,  with the present number, the editorial duties of the Messenger. His  Critical Notices for this month end with Professor Anthon's Cicero-what  follows is from another hand. With the best wishes to the magazine, and  to its few foes as well as many friends, he is now desirous of bidding  all parties a peaceful farewell.\"    While in Richmond, with an income of but five hundred dollars a year, he  had married his cousin, Virginia Clemm, a very amiable and lovely girl,  who was as poor as himself, and little fitted, except by her gentle  temper, to be tho wife of such a person. He went from Richmond to  Baltimore; and after a short time, to Philadelphia, and to New York. A  slight acquaintance with Dr. Hawks had led that acute and powerful writer  to invite his contributions to the \"New York Review,\" and he had  furnished for the second number of it (for October, 1837) an elaborate  but not very remarkable article upon Stephens's then recently published  \"Incidents of Travel in Egypt, Arabia Petrea, and the Holy Land.\" His  abilities were not of the kind demanded for such work, and he never wrote  another paper for this or for any other Review of the same class. He had  commenced in the \"Literary Messenger,\" a story of the sea under the title  of \"Arthur Gordon Pym\"[A], and upon the recommendation of Mr. Paulding  and others, it was printed by the Harpers. It is his longest work, and is  not without some sort of merit, but it received little attention. The  publishers sent one hundred copies to England, and being mistaken at  first for a narrative of real experiences it was advertised to be  reprinted, but a discovery of its character, I believe, prevented such a  result. An attempt is made in it, by simplicity of style, minuteness of  nautical descriptions, and circumstantiality of narration, to give it  that air of truth which constitutes the principal attraction of Sir  Edward Seaward's narrative, and Robinson Cursoe; but it has none of the  pleasing interest of these tales; it is as full of wonders as Munchausen,  has as many atrocities as the Book of Pirates, and as liberal an array of  paining and revolting horrors as ever was invented by Anne Radcliffe or  George Walker. Thus far a tendency to extravagance had been the most  striking infirmity of his genius. He had been more anxious to be intense  than to be natural; and some of his _bizarreries_ had been mistaken for  satire, and admired for that quality. Afterward he was more judicious,  and if his outlines were incredible it was commonly forgotten in the  simplicity of his details and their cohesive cumulation.      [Footnote A: THE NARRATIVE OF ARTHUR GORDON PYM, OF NANTUCKET; comprising  the Details of a Mutiny and Atrocious Butchery on board the American Brig  Grampus, on her way to the South Seas--with an account of the Re-capture  of the Vessel by the Survivors; their Shipwreck, and subsequent Horrible  Sufferings from Famine; their Deliverance by means of the British  schooner Jane Gray; the brief Cruise of this latter Vessel in the  Antarctic ocean; her Capture, and the Massacre of the Crew among a Group  of Islands in the 84th parallel of southern latitude; together with the  incredible Adventures and Discoveries still further South, to which that  distressing calamity gave rise.--I vol. 12mo. pp. 198 New-York, Harper &  Brothers, 1838.]      Near the end of the year 1838 he settled in Philadelphia. He had no very  Definite purposes, but trusted for support to the chances of success as a  magazinist and newspaper correspondent. Mr. Burton, the comedian, had  recently established the \"Gentleman's Magazine,\" and of this he became a  contributor, and in May, 1839, the chief editor, devoting to it, for ten  dollars a week, two hours every day, which left him abundant time for  more important labors. In the same month he agreed to furnish such  reviewals as he had written for the \"Literary Messenger,\" for the  \"Literary Examiner,\" a new magazine at Pittsburgh. But his more congenial  pursuit was tale-writing, and he produced about this period some of his  most remarkable and characteristic works in a department of imaginative  composition in which he was henceforth alone and unapproachable. \"The Fall  of the House of Usher\" and \"Legeia\", are the most interesting  illustrations of his mental organization--his masterpieces in a peculiar  vein of romantic creation. They have theunquestionable stamp of genius.  The analyses of the growth of madness in one, and the thrilling  revelations of the existence of a first wife in the person of a second,  in the other, are made with consummate skill; and the strange and solemn  and fascinating beauty which informs the style and invests the  circumstances of both, drugs the mind, and makes us forget the  improbabilities of their general design.    An awakened ambition and the healthful influence of a conviction that his  works were appreciated, and that his fame was increasing, led"]]]
