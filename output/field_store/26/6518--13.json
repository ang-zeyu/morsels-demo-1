Supposing that the  teacher, or one of the monitors, had come to prepare him for the  dreadful sentence, he refused to move.    Then a voice, that certainly was not the one he expected, called to him.  He raised a flushed and tearful face from the bed, and met the inquiring  eyes of his father's old friend, and the \"protector\" of the Bonaparte  family, General Marbeuf, formerly the French commander in Corsica.    \"Why, Napoleon, boy! what does all this mean?\" inquired the general.  \"Have you been in mischief? What is the trouble?\"    The visit came as a climax to a most exciting event. In it Napoleon saw  escape from the disgrace he so feared, and the injustice against which  he so rebelled. With a joyful shout he flung himself impulsively at his  friend's feet, clasped his knees, and begged for his protection. The  boy, you see, was still unnerved and over-wrought, and was not as cool  or self-possessed as usual.    Gradually, however, he calmed down, and told General Marbeuf the whole  story.    The general was indignant at the sentence. But he laughed heartily at  the idea of this fourteen-year-old boy challenging another to a duel.    \"Why, what a fire-eater it is!\" he cried. \"But you had provocation,  boy. This Bouquet is a sneak, and your teacher is a tyrant. But we will  change it all; see, now! I will seek out the principal. I will explain  it all. He shall see it rightly, and you shall not be thus disgraced.  No, sir! not if I, General Marbeuf, intrench myself alone with you  behind what is left of your slushy snow-fort yonder, and fight all  Brienne school in your behalf--teachers and all. So cheer up, lad! we  will make it right.\"          CHAPTER THIRTEEN.    RECOMMENDED FOR PROMOTION.    General Marbeuf did make it all right. Bouquet was called to account;  the teacher who had so often made it unpleasant for Napoleon was sharply  reprimanded; and the principal, having his attention drawn to the  persistent persecution of this boy from Corsica, consented to his  release from imprisonment, while sternly lecturing him on the sin of  duelling.    The general also chimed in with the principal's lecture; although I am  afraid, being a soldier, he was more in sympathy with Napoleon than he  should have been.    \"A bad business this duelling, my son,\" he said, \"a bad business--though  I must say this rascal Bouquet deserved a good beating for his  insolence. But a beating is hardly the thing between gentlemen.\"    \"And you have fought a duel, my General?\" inquired Napoleon. \"Have I?  why, scores\" the bluff soldier admitted.    [Illustration: \"_'And you have fought a duel, my General'? inquired  Napoleon_\"]    \"Let me see--I have fought one--two--four--why, when I was scarcely more  than your age, my friend, I\"--and then the general suddenly stopped.  For he saw how his reminiscences would grow into admissions that would  scarcely be a correction.    So, with a hem and a haw, General Marbeuf wisely changed the subject,  and began to inquire into the reasons for Napoleon's unpleasant  experiences at Brienne. He speedily discovered that the cause lay in the  pocket. As you have already learned from Napoleon's letter to his father  and his own later reflections, the boy's poverty made him dissatisfied  with his lot, while his companions, heedless and blundering as boys are  apt to be in such matters, did not try to smooth over the difference  between their plenty and this boy's need, but rather increased his  bitterness by their thoughtless speech and action.    \"Brains do not lie in the pocket, Napoleon, boy,\" he said. \"You have as  much intelligence as any of your fellows, you should not be so touchy  because you do not happen to have their spending-money. You must learn  to be more charitable. Do not take offence so easily; remember that  all boys admire ability, and look kindly on good fellowship in a  comrade, whether he have much or little in his purse. Learn to be more  companionable; accept things as they come; and if you are ever hard  pushed for money,--call on me. I'll see you through.\"    Any boy will take a lecture with so agreeable an ending, and Napoleon  did not resent his good friend's advice.    The general also introduced the boy to the great lady who lived in the  big chateau near by--the Lady of Brienne. She interested herself in the  lad's doings, gave him many a \"tip,\" invited him to her home, and, by  kindly words and motherly deeds, brought the boy out of his nervousness  and solitude into something more like good manners and gentlemanly ways.    So the school--life at Brienne went on more agreeably as the months  passed by. Napoleon studied hard. He made good progress in mathematics  and history, though he disliked the languages, and never wrote a good  hand. He was always an \"old boy\" for his years; and, in time, many of  his teachers became interested in him, and even grew fond of him.    But he always kept his family in mind. He was continually planning how  he might help his mother, and give his brothers and sisters a chance to  get an education.    He even treated Joseph as if he himself were the elder, and Joseph the  younger brother. There is a letter in existence which he wrote to his  father in 1783, in which he tries to arrange for Joseph's future, as  that rather heavy boy had decided not to become a priest.    \"Joseph,\" so Napoleon wrote from Brienne to his father, \"can come here  to school. The principal says he can be received here; and Father  Patrault, the teacher of mathematics, says he will be glad to undertake  Joseph's instruction, and that, if he will work, we may both of us go  together for our artillery examination. Never mind me. I can get along.  But you must do something for Joseph. Good-by, my dear father. I hope  you will decide to send Joseph here to Brienne, rather than to Metz. It  will be a pleasure for us to be together; and, as Joseph knows nothing  of mathematics, if you send him to Metz, he will have to begin with the  little children; and that, I know, will disgust him. I hope, therefore,  that before the end of October I shall embrace Joseph.\"    That is a nice, brotherly letter, is it not? It does not sound like the  boy who was always ready to quarrel and fight with brother Joseph,  nor does it seem to be from a sulky, disagreeable boy. This spirit of  looking out for his family was one of the traits of Napoleon's character  that was noticeable alike in the boy, the soldier, the commander, and  the emperor.    Indeed, the very spirit of self-denial in which this letter, an extract  from which you have just read, was written, was not only characteristic  of this remarkable man of whose boy-life this story tells, but it led in  his school-days at Brienne to a change that affected his whole life.    One day there came to the school the Chevalier de Keralio, inspector of  military schools--a sort of committee man as you would say in America.  It was the duty of the inspector to look into the record, and arrange  for the promotions, of \"the king's wards,\" as the boys and girls were  called who were educated at the expense of the state. He was, in some  way, attracted to this sober, silent, and sad-eyed little Corsican, and  inquired into his history. He rather liked the boy's appearance, odd as  it was. He took quite a fancy to the young Napoleon, talked with him,  questioned him, and outlined to the teachers at Brienne what he thought  should be the future course of the lad.    Charles Bonaparte had some thought of placing Napoleon in the naval  service of France. The boy told Inspector Keralio this; but the  chevalier declared that he intended to recommend the boy for promotion  to the military school at Paris, and then have him assigned for service  at Toulon. This was the nearest port to Corsica, and would place  Napoleon nearer to his much-loved family home.    The teachers objected to this.    \"There are other boys in the school much better fitted for such an honor  than this young Bonaparte,\" they said.    But the inspector thought otherwise.    \"I know boys,\" he said. \"I know what I am doing.\"    \"But he is not ready yet,\" said the principal. \"To do as you advise  would be to change all the rules set down for promotion.\"    \"Well, what if it does?\" replied the inspector.    \"But why should you favor this boy and his family? They are Corsicans.\"    \"I do not care anything about his family,\" the inspector declared. \"If I  put aside the rules in this case, it is not to do the Bonaparte family a  favor. I do not know them. But I have studied this boy. It is because of  him that I propose this action. I see a spark in him that cannot be too  early cultivated. It shall not be extinguished if I can help it. This  young Bonaparte will make his mark if he has a chance, and I shall give  him that chance.\"    So before he left Brienne the inspector wrote this strong recommendation  of the boy whom he desired to befriend and put forward:--    \"Monsieur de Bonaparte (Napoleon), born August 15, 1769. Height,  four feet, ten inches. Of good constitution, excellent health, mild  disposition. Has finished the fourth form: is straightforward and  obliging. His conduct has been most satisfactory. He has been  distinguished for his application to mathematics; is fairly acquainted  with history and geography; is weak in all accomplishments,--drawing,  dancing, music, and the like. This boy would make an excellent sailor.  He deserves promotion to the school in Paris.\"    Napoleon had gained a powerful friend. His favor would put the boy well  forward in his career. He felt quite elated. But, unfortunately for  the plans proposed, the Inspector de Keralio died suddenly, before his  recommendation could be acted upon; and with so many other applications  that were backed up by influence, for boys with better opportunities,  Napoleon's desired assignment to the naval service did not receive  action by the government, and he was passed by in favor of less "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/949"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Submarine Boat; Or, Under the Ocean for Sunken Treasure (#13)"],[1,"efly, \"a whole school of them.\"    The fish seemed suddenly to multiply, and soon those in the submarine  felt curious tremors running through the whole craft.    \"The fish are rubbing up against it,\" cried Tom. \"They must think we  came down here to allow them to scratch their backs on the steel  plates.\"    For some time they remained on the bottom, watching the wonderful sight  of the fishes that swam all about them.    \"Well, I think we may as well rise,\" announced Mr. Swift, after they  had been on the bottom about an hour, moving here and there. \"We didn't  bring any provisions, and I'm getting hungry, though I don't know how  the others of you feel about it.\"    \"Bless my dinner-plate, I could eat, too!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Go up, by  all means. We'll get enough of under-water travel once we start for the  treasure.\"    \"Send her up, Tom,\" called his father. \"I want to make a few notes on  some needed changes and improvements.\"    Tom entered the lower pilot house, and turned the valve that opened the  tanks. He also pulled the lever that started the pumps, so that the  water ballast would be more quickly emptied, as that would render the  submarine buoyant, and she would quickly shoot to the surface. To the  surprise of the lad, however, there followed no outrushing of the  water. The Advance remained stationary on the ocean bed. Mr. Swift  looked up from his notes.    \"Didn't you hear me ask you to send her up, Tom?\" he inquired mildly.    \"I did, dad, but something seems to be the matter,\" was the reply.    \"Matter? What do you mean?\" and the aged inventor hastened to where his  son and Captain Weston were at the wheels, valves and levers.    \"Why, the tanks won't empty, and the pumps don't seem to work.\"    \"Let me try,\" suggested Mr. Swift, and he pulled the various handles.  There was no corresponding action of the machinery.    \"That's odd,\" he remarked in a curious voice \"Perhaps something has  gone wrong with the connections. Go look in the engine-room, and ask  Mr. Sharp if everything is all right there.\"    Tom made a quick trip, returning to report that the dynamos, motors and  gas engine were running perfectly.    \"Try to work the tank levers and pumps from the conning tower,\"  suggested Captain Weston. \"Sometimes I've known the steam steering gear  to play tricks like that.\"    Tom hurried up the circular stairway into the tower. He pulled the  levers and shifted the valves and wheels there.  But there was no  emptying of the water tanks. The weight and pressure of water in them  still held the submarine on the bottom of the sea, more than a mile  from the surface. The pumps in the engine-room were working at top  speed, but there was evidently something wrong in the connections.  Mr.  Swift quickly came to this conclusion.    \"We must repair it at once,\" he said. \"Tom, come to the engine-room.  You and I, with Mr. Jackson and Mr. Sharp, will soon have it in shape  again.\"    \"Is there any danger?\" asked Mr. Damon in a perturbed voice. \"Bless my  soul, it's unlucky to have an accident on our trial trip.\"    \"Oh, we must expect accidents,\" declared Mr. Swift with a smile. \"This  is nothing.\"    But it proved to be more difficult than he had imagined to re-establish  the connection between the pumps and the tanks. The valves, too, had  clogged or jammed, and as the pressure outside the ship was so great,  the water would not run out of itself. It must be forced.    For an hour or more the inventor, his son and the others, worked away.  They could accomplish nothing. Tom looked anxiously at his parent when  the latter paused in his efforts.    \"Don't worry,\" advised the aged inventor. \"It's got to come right  sooner or later.\"    Just then Mr. Damon, who had been wandering about the ship, entered the  engine-room.    \"Do you know,\" he said, \"you ought to open a window, or something.\"    \"Why, what's the matter?\" asked Tom quickly, looking to see if the odd  man was joking.    \"Well, of course I don't exactly mean a window,\" explained Mr. Damon,  \"but we need fresh air.\"    \"Fresh air!\" There was a startled note in Mr. Swift's voice as he  repeated the words.    \"Yes, I can hardly breathe in the living-room, and it's not much better  here.\"    \"Why, there ought to be plenty of fresh air,\" went on the inventor. \"It  is renewed automatically.\"    Tom jumped up and looked at an indicator. He uttered a startled cry.    \"The air hasn't been changed in the last hour!\" he exclaimed. \"It is  bad. There's not enough oxygen in it. I notice it, now that I've  stopped working. The gage indicates it, too. The automatic air-changer  must have stopped working. I'll fix it.\"    He hurried to the machine which was depended on to supply fresh air to  the submarine.    \"Why, the air tanks are empty!\" the young inventor cried.  \"We haven't  any more air except what is in the ship now!\"    \"And we're rapidly breathing that up,\" added Captain Weston solemnly.    \"Can't you make more?\" cried Mr. Damon. \"I thought you said you could  make oxygen aboard the ship.\"    \"We can,\" answered Mr. Swift, \"but I did not bring along a supply of  the necessary chemicals. I did not think we would be submerged long  enough for that. But there should have been enough in the reserve tank  to last several days. How about it, Tom?\"    \"It's all leaked out, or else it wasn't filled,\" was the despairing  answer. \"All the air we have is what's in the ship, and we can't make  more.\"    The treasure-seekers looked at each other. It was an awful situation.    \"Then the only thing to do is to fix the machinery and rise to the  surface,\" said Mr. Sharp simply. \"We can have all the air we want,  then.\"    \"Yes, but the machinery doesn't seem possible of being fixed,\" spoke  Tom in a low voice.    \"We must do it!\" cried his father.    They set to work again with fierce energy, laboring for their very  lives. They all knew that they could not long remain in the ship  without oxygen. Nor could they desert it to go to the surface, for the  moment they left the protection of the thick steel sides the terrible  pressure of the water would kill them. Nor were the diving suits  available. They must stay in the craft and die a miserable death--unless  the machinery could be repaired and the Advance sent to the surface.  The emergency expanding lifting tank was not yet in working order.    More frantically they toiled, trying every device that was suggested to  the mechanical minds of Tom, his father, Mr. Sharp or Mr. Jackson, to  make the pumps work. But something was wrong. More and more foul grew  the air. They were fairly gasping now. It was  difficult to breathe, to  say nothing of working, in that atmosphere. The thought of their  terrible position was in the minds of all.    \"Oh, for one breath of fresh air!\" cried Mr. Damon, who seemed to  suffer more than any of the others. Grim death was hovering around  them, imprisoned as they were on the ocean's bed, over a mile from the  surface.          Chapter Thirteen    Off for the Treasure      Suddenly Tom, after a moment's pause, seized a wrench and began  loosening some nuts.    \"What are you doing?\" asked his father faintly, for he was being  weakened by the vitiated atmosphere.    \"I'm going to take this valve apart,\" replied his son. \"We haven't  looked there for the trouble. Maybe it's out of order.\"    He attacked the valve with energy, but his hands soon lagged. The lack  of oxygen was telling on him. He could no longer work quickly.    \"I'll help,\" murmured Mr. Sharp thickly. He took a wrench, but no  sooner had he loosened one nut than he toppled over.  \"I'm all in,\" he  murmured feebly.    \"Is he dead?\" cried Mr. Damon, himself gasping.    \"No, only fainted. But he soon will be dead, and so will all of us, if  we don't get fresh air,\" remarked Captain Weston. \"Lie down on the  floor, every one. There is a little fairly good air there. It's heavier  than the air we've breathed, and we can exist on it for a little  longer. Poor Sharp was so used to breathing the rarified air of high  altitudes that he can't stand this heavy atmosphere.\"    Mr. Damon was gasping worse than ever, and so was Mr. Swift. The  balloonist lay an inert heap on the floor, with Captain Weston trying  to force a few drops of stimulant down his throat.    With a fierce determination in his heart, but with fingers that almost  refused to do his bidding, Tom once more sought to open the big valve.  He felt sure the trouble was located there, as they had tried to locate  it in every other place without avail.    \"I'll help,\" said Mr. Jackson in a whisper. He, too, was hardly able to  move.    More and more devoid of oxygen grew the air. It gave Tom a sense as if  his head was filled, and ready to burst with every breath he drew.  Still he struggled to loosen the nuts.  There were but four more now,  and he took off three while Mr. Jackson removed one. The young inventor  lifted off the valve cover, though it felt like a ton weight to him. He  gave a glance inside.    \"Here's the trouble!\" he murmured. \"The valve's clogged.  No wonder it  wouldn't work. The pumps couldn't force the water out.\"    It was the work of only a minute to adjust the valve. Then Tom and the  engineer managed to get the cover back on.    How they inserted the bolts and screwed the nuts in place they never  could remember clearly afterward, but they managed it somehow, with  shaking, trembling hands and eyes that grew more and more dim.    \"Now start the pumps!\" cried Tom faintly. \"The tanks will be emptied,  and we can get to the surface.\"    Mr. Sharp was still unconscious, nor was Mr. Swift able to help. He lay  with his eyes closed. Garret Jackson, however, managed to crawl to the  engine-room, and soon the clank of machinery told Tom that the pumps  were in motion. The lad staggered to the pilot house and threw the  levers over. An instant later there was the hissing of water as it  rushed from the ballast tanks. The submarine shivered, as"]]]
