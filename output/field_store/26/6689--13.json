The Yogis spend much time in acquiring this mental peace and calm, and  consider themselves well paid for it.    (b) When the mind is well calmed down, and peaceful, fix the thought on  the \"I Am,\" as taught in our previous lessons. Picture the \"I\" as an  entity independent of the body; deathless; invulnerable; immortal; real.  Then think of it as independent of the body, and able to exist without  its fleshly covering. Meditate upon this for a time, and then gradually  direct the thought to the realization of the \"I\" as independent and  superior to the mind, and controlling same. Go over the general ideas of  the first two lessons, and endeavor to calmly reflect upon them and  to see them in the \"mind's eye.\" You will find that your mind is  gradually becoming more and more peaceful and calm, and that the  distracting thoughts of the outside world are farther and farther removed  from you.    (c) Then let the mind pass on to a calm consideration of the Third  Lesson, in which we have spoken of the Oneness of All, and the  relationship of the \"I\" to the One Life; Power; Intelligence; Being. You  will find that you are acquiring a mental control and calm heretofore  unknown to you. The exercises in the first three lessons will have  prepared you for this.    (d) The following is the most difficult of the variations or degrees of  this exercise, but the ability to perform it will come gradually. The  exercise consists in gradually shutting out all thought or impression  of the outside world; of the body; and of the thoughts themselves, the  student concentrating and meditating upon the word and idea \"I AM,\" the  idea being that he shall concentrate upon the idea of mere \"being\" or  \"existence,\" symbolized by the words \"I Am.\" Not \"I am _this_,\" or \"I am  _that_,\" or \"I _do_ this,\" or \"I _think_ that,\" but simply: \"I _AM_.\"  This exercise will focus the attention at the very centre of Being within  oneself, and will gather in all the mental energies, instead of allowing  them to be scattered upon outside things. A feeling of Peace, Strength,  and Power will result, for the affirmation, and the thought back of it,  is the most powerful and strongest that one may make, for it is a  statement of Actual Being, and a turning of the thought inward to that  truth. Let the mind first dwell upon the word \"I,\" identifying it with  the Self, and then let it pass on to the word \"AM,\" which signifies  Reality, and Being. Then combine the two with the meanings thereof, and  the result a most powerful focusing of thought inward, and most potent  Statement of Being.    It is well to accompany the above exercises with a comfortable and easy  physical attitude, so as to prevent the distraction of the attention by  the body. In order to do this one should assume an easy attitude and then  relax every muscle, and take the tension from every nerve, until a  perfect sense of ease, comfort and relaxation is obtained. You should  practice this until you have fully acquired it. It will be useful to you  in many ways, besides rendering Concentration and Meditation easier. It  will act as a \"rest cure\" for tired body, nerves, and mind.      EXERCISE II.    The second step in _Raja Yoga_ is what is known as _Dharana_, or  Concentration. This is a most wonderful idea in the direction of focusing  the mental forces, and may be cultivated to an almost incredible degree,  but all this requires work, time, and patience. But the student will be  well repaid for it. Concentration consists in the mind focusing upon a  certain subject, or object, and being held there for a time. This, at  first thought seems very easy, but a little practice will show how  difficult it is to firmly fix the attention and hold it there. It will  have a tendency to waver, and move to some other object or subject, and  much practice will be needed in order to hold it at the desired point.  But practice will accomplish wonders, as one may see by observing people  who have acquired this faculty, and who use it in their everyday life.  But the following point should be remembered. Many persons have acquired  the faculty of concentrating their attention, but have allowed it to  become almost involuntary, and they become a slave to it, forgetting  themselves and everything else, and often neglecting necessary affairs.  This is the ignorant way of concentrating, and those addicted to it  become slaves to their habits, instead of masters of their minds. They  become day-dreamers, and absent-minded people, instead of Masters. They  are to be pitied as much as those who cannot concentrate at all. The  secret is in a mastery of the mind. The Yogis can concentrate at will,  and completely bury themselves in the subject before them, and extract  from it every item of interest, and can then pass the mind from the thing  at will, the same control being used in both cases. They do not allow  fits of abstraction, or \"absent-mindedness\" to come upon them, nor are  they day-dreamers. On the contrary they are very wide awake individuals;  close observers; clear thinkers; correct reasoners. They are masters of  their minds, not slaves to their moods. The ignorant concentrator buries  himself in the object or subject, and allows it to master and absorb  himself, while the trained Yogi thinker asserts the \"I,\" and then directs  his mind to concentrate upon the subject or object, keeping it well under  control and in view all the time. Do you see the difference? Then heed  the lesson.    The following exercises may be found useful in the first steps of  Concentration:    (a) Concentrate the attention upon some familiar object--a pencil, for  instance. Hold the mind there and consider the pencil to the exclusion of  any other object. Consider its size; color; shape; kind of wood. Consider  its uses, and purposes; its materials; the process of its manufacture,  etc., etc., etc. In short think as many things about the pencil as  possible allowing the mind to pursue any associated by-paths, such as a  consideration of the graphite of which the \"lead\" is made; the forest  from which came the wood used in making the pencil; the history of  pencils, and other implements used for writing, etc. In short exhaust  the subject of \"Pencils.\" In considering a subject under concentration,  the following plan of synopsis will be found useful. Think of the thing  in question from the following view-points:    (1) The thing itself.    (2) The place from whence it came.    (3) Its purpose or use.    (4) Its associations.    (5) Its probable end.    Do not let the apparently trivial nature of the inquiry discourage you,  for the simplest form of mental training is useful, and will help to  develop your Will and Concentration. It is akin to the process of  developing a physical muscle by some simple exercise, and in both cases  one loses sight of the unimportance of the exercise itself, in view of  the end to be gained.    (b) Concentrate the attention upon some part of the body--the hand for  instance, and fixing your entire attention upon it, shut off or inhibit  all sensation from the other parts of the body. A little practice will  enable you to do this. In addition to the mental training, this exercise  will stimulate the part of the body concentrated upon, for reasons that  will appear in future lessons. Change the parts of the body concentrated  upon, and thus give the mind a variety of exercises, and the body the  effect of a general stimulation.    (c) These exercises may be extended indefinitely upon familiar objects  about you. Remember always, that the thing in itself is of no importance,  the whole idea being to train the mind to obey the Will, so that when you  really wish to use the mental forces upon some important object, you may  find them well trained and obedient. Do not be tempted to slight this  part of the work because it is \"dry\" and uninteresting, for it leads up  to things that are most interesting, and opens a door to a fascinating  subject.    (d) Practice focusing the attention upon some abstract subject--that is  upon some subject of interest that may offer a field for mental  exploration. Think about the subject in all its phases and branches,  following up one by-path, and then another, until you feel that you know  all about the subject that your mind has acquired. You will be surprised  to find how much more you know about any one thing or subject than you  had believed possible. In hidden corners of your mind you will find some  useful or interesting information about the thing in question, and when  you are through you will feel well posted upon it, and upon the things  connected with it. This exercise will not only help, to develop your  intellectual powers, but will strengthen your memory, and broaden your  mind, and give you more confidence in yourself. And, in addition, you  will have taken a valuable exercise in Concentration or _Dharana_.      _The Importance of Concentration._    Concentration is a focusing of the mind. And this focusing of the mind  requires a focusing, or bringing to a center, of the Will. The mind is  concentrated because the Will is focused upon the object. The mind flows  into the mould made by the Will. The above exercises are designed not  only to accustom the mind to the obedience and direction of the Will, but  also tend to accustom the Will to command. We speak of strengthening the  Will, when what we really mean is training the mind to obey, and  accustoming the Will to command. Our Will is strong enough, but we do not  realize it. The Will takes root in the very center of our being--in the  \"I,\" but our imperfectly developed mind does not recognize this tact.  We are like young elephants that do not recognize their own strength, but  allow themselves to be mastered by puny drivers, whom they could brush  aside with a movement."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1366"],[0,"The Cloister and the Hearth (#14)"],[1,"have gone and left me  long ago. For my art. It has all but left me too. I have the knowledge  still, but what avails that when the hand trembles. No, Gerard; I look  on you as my son. You are good, you are handsome, you are a painter,  though not like some I have known. I will not let you throw your youth  away as I did mine: you shall marry this Margaret. I have inquired, and  she is a good daughter. Reicht here is a gossip. She has told me all  about it. But that need not hinder you to tell me.\"    Poor Gerard was overjoyed to be permitted to praise Margaret aloud, and  to one who could understand what he loved in her.    Soon there were two pair of wet eyes over his story; and when the poor  boy saw that, there were three.    Women are creatures brimful of courage. Theirs is not exactly the same  quality as manly courage; that would never do, hang it all; we should  have to give up trampling on them. No; it is a vicarious courage. They  never take part in a bull-fight by any chance; but it is remarked that  they sit at one unshaken by those tremors and apprehensions for the  combatants to which the male spectator--feeble-minded wretch!--is  subject. Nothing can exceed the resolution with which they have been  known to send forth men to battle: as some witty dog says,    \"Les femmes sont tres braves avec le peur d'autrui.\"    By this trait Gerard now profited. Margaret and Reicht were agreed that  a man should always take the bull by the horns. Gerard's only course was  to marry Margaret Brandt off-hand; the old people would come to after  a while, the deed once done. Whereas, the longer this misunderstanding  continued on its present footing, the worse for all parties, especially  for Gerard.    \"See how pale and thin they have made him amongst them.\"    \"Indeed you are, Master Gerard,\" said Reicht. \"It makes a body sad to  see a young man so wasted and worn. Mistress, when I met him in the  street to-day, I had liked to have burst out crying: he was so changed.    \"And I'll be bound the others keep their colour; ah, Reicht? such as it  is.\"    \"Oh, I see no odds in them.\"    \"Of course not. We painters are no match for boors. We are glass, they  are stone. We can't stand the worry, worry, worry of little minds; and  it is not for the good of mankind we should be exposed to it. It is hard  enough, Heaven knows, to design and paint a masterpiece, without having  gnats and flies stinging us to death into the bargain.\"    Exasperated as Gerard was by his father's threat of violence, he  listened to these friendly voices telling him the prudent course was  rebellion. But though he listened, he was not convinced.    \"I do not fear my father's violence,\" he said, \"but I do fear his  anger. When it came to the point he would not imprison me. I would marry  Margaret to-morrow if that was my only fear. No; he would disown me. I  should take Margaret from her father, and give her a poor husband,  who would never thrive, weighed down by his parent's curse. Madam! I  sometimes think if I could marry her secretly, and then take her away  to some country where my craft is better paid than in this; and after  a year or two, when the storm had blown over, you know, could come back  with money in my purse, and say, 'My dear parents, we do not seek your  substance, we but ask you to love us once more as you used, and as we  have never ceased to love you'--but, alas! I shall be told these are the  dreams of an inexperienced young man.\"    The old lady's eyes sparkled.    \"It is no dream, but a piece of wonderful common-sense in a boy;  it remains to be seen whether you have spirit to carry out your own  thought. There is a country, Gerard, where certain fortune awaits you  at this moment. Here the arts freeze, but there they flourish, as they  never yet flourished in any age or land.\"    \"It is Italy!\" cried Gerard. \"It is Italy!\"    \"Ay, Italy! where painters are honoured like princes, and scribes are  paid three hundred crowns for copying a single manuscript. Know you not  that his Holiness the Pope has written to every land for skilful scribes  to copy the hundreds of precious manuscripts that are pouring into that  favoured land from Constantinople, whence learning and learned men are  driven by the barbarian Turks?\"    \"Nay, I know not that; but it has been the dream and hope of my life to  visit Italy, the queen of all the arts; oh, madam! But the journey, and  we are all so poor.\"    \"Find you the heart to go, I'll find the means. I know where to lay my  hand on ten golden angels: they will take you to Rome: and the girl with  you, if she loves you as she ought.\"    They sat till midnight over this theme. And, after that day, Gerard  recovered his spirits, and seemed to carry a secret talisman against all  the gibes and the harsh words that flew about his ears at home.    Besides the money she procured him for the journey, Margaret Van Eyck  gave him money's worth. Said she, \"I will tell you secrets that I  learned from masters that are gone from me, and have left no fellow  behind. Even the Italians know them not; and what I tell you now in  Tergou you shall sell here in Florence. Note my brother Jan's pictures:  time, which fades all other paintings, leaves his colours bright as the  day they left the easel. The reason is, he did nothing blindly, in  a hurry. He trusted to no hireling to grind his colours; he did it  himself, or saw it done. His panel was prepared and prepared again--I  will show you how--a year before he laid his colour on. Most of them are  quite content to have their work sucked up and lost, sooner than not  be in a hurry. Bad painters are always in a hurry. Above all, Gerard,  I warn you use but little oil, and never boil it: boiling it melts that  vegetable dross into its heart which it is our business to clear away;  for impure oil is death to colour. No; take your oil and pour it into  a bottle with water. In a day or two the water will turn muddy: that is  muck from the oil. Pour the dirty water carefully away and add fresh.  When that is poured away, you will fancy the oil is clear. You're  mistaken. Reicht, fetch me that!\" Reicht brought a glass trough with a  glass lid fitting tight. \"When your oil has been washed in bottle, put  it into this trough with water, and put the trough in the sun all day.  You will soon see the water turbid again. But mark, you must not carry  this game too far, or the sun will turn your oil to varnish. When it is  as clear as crystal, not too luscious, drain carefully, and cork it up  tight. Grind your own prime colours, and lay them on with this oil, and  they shall live. Hubert would put sand or salt in the water to clear the  oil quicker. But Jan used to say, 'Water will do it best; give water  time.' Jan Van Eyck was never in a hurry, and that is why the world will  not forget him in a hurry.\"    This and several other receipts, quae nunc perscribere longum est,  Margaret gave him with sparkling eyes, and Gerard received them like  a legacy from Heaven, so interesting are some things that read  uninteresting. Thus provided with money and knowledge, Gerard decided to  marry and fly with his wife to Italy. Nothing remained now but to inform  Margaret Brandt of his resolution, and to publish the banns as quietly  as possible. He went to Sevenbergen earlier than usual on both these  errands. He began with Margaret; told her of the Dame Van Eyck's  goodness, and the resolution he had come to at last, and invited her  co-operation.    She refused it plump.    \"No, Gerard; you and I have never spoken of your family, but when you  come to marriage--\" She stopped, then began again. \"I do think your  father has no ill-will to me more than to another. He told Peter  Buyskens as much, and Peter told me. But so long as he is bent on your  being a priest (you ought have told me this instead of I you), I could  not marry you, Gerard, dearly as I love you.\"    Gerard strove in vain to shake this resolution. He found it very easy  to make her cry, but impossible to make her yield. Then Gerard was  impatient and unjust.    \"Very well!\" he cried; \"then you are on their side, and you will drive  me to be a priest, for this must end one way or another. My parents hate  me in earnest, but my lover only loves me in jest.\"    And with this wild, bitter speech, he flung away home again, and left  Margaret weeping.    When a man misbehaves, the effect is curious on a girl who loves him  sincerely. It makes her pity him. This, to some of us males, seems  anything but logical. The fault is in our own eye; the logic is too  swift for us. The girl argues thus:--\"How unhappy, how vexed, how poor  he must be to misbehave! Poor thing!\"    Margaret was full of this sweet womanly pity, when, to her great  surprise, scarce an hour and a half after he left her, Gerard came  running back to her with the fragments of a picture in his hand, and  panting with anger and grief.    \"There, Margaret! see! see! the wretches! Look at their spite! They have  cut your portrait to pieces.\"    Margaret looked, and, sure enough, some malicious hand had cut her  portrait into five pieces. She was a good girl, but she was not ice; she  turned red to her very forehead.    \"Who did it?\"    \"Nay, I know not. I dared not ask; for I should hate the hand that did  it, ay, till my dying day. My poor Margaret! The butchers, the ruffians!  Six months' work cut out of my life, and nothing to show for it now.  See, they have hacked through your very face; the sweet face that every  one loves who knows it. Oh, heartless, merciless vipers!\"    \"Never mind, Gerard,\" said Margaret, panting. \"Since this is how they  treat you for my sake--Ye rob him of my portrait, do ye? Well, then, he  shall have the face itself, such as it is.\"    \"Oh, Margaret!\"    \"Yes, Gerard; since they are so cruel, I will be the kinder: forgive  me for refusing you. I will be your wife: to-morrow, if it is your  pleasure.\"    Gerard kissed"]]]
