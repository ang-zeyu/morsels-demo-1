Her hair streamed over the pillow  in white, uncared-for tresses, and the hands that plucked at the  bed-clothes were like wrinkled claws. Only her eyes were unchanged; they  were as blue and brilliant as ever, but now filled with such agonized  terror and appeal that Mr. Leonard's gentle heart almost stood still  with the horror of them. They were the eyes of a creature driven wild  with torture, hounded by furies, clutched by unutterable fear.    Naomi sat up and dragged at his arm.    \"Can you help me? Can you help me?\" she gasped imploringly. \"Oh, I  thought you'd never come! I was skeered I'd die before you got here--die  and go to hell. I didn't know before today that I was dying. None of  those cowards would tell me. Can you help me?\"    \"If I cannot, God can,\" said Mr. Leonard gently. He felt himself very  helpless and inefficient before this awful terror and frenzy. He had  seen sad death-beds--troubled death-beds--ay, and despairing death-beds,  but never anything like this. \"God!\" Naomi's voice shrilled terribly as  she uttered the name. \"I can't go to God for help. Oh, I'm skeered of  hell, but I'm skeereder still of God. I'd rather go to hell a thousand  times over than face God after the life I've lived. I tell you, I'm  sorry for living wicked--I was always sorry for it all the time. There  ain't never been a moment I wasn't sorry, though nobody would believe  it. I was driven on by fiends of hell. Oh, you don't understand--you  CAN'T understand--but I was always sorry!\"    \"If you repent, that is all that is necessary. God will forgive you if  you ask Him.\"    \"No, He can't! Sins like mine can't be forgiven. He can't--and He  won't.\"    \"He can and He will. He is a God of love, Naomi.\"    \"No,\" said Naomi with stubborn conviction. \"He isn't a God of love at  all. That's why I'm skeered of him. No, no. He's a God of wrath and  justice and punishment. Love! There ain't no such thing as love! I've  never found it on earth, and I don't believe it's to be found in God.\"    \"Naomi, God loves us like a father.\"    \"Like MY father?\" Naomi's shrill laughter, pealing through the still  room, was hideous to hear.    The old minister shuddered.    \"No--no! As a kind, tender, all-wise father, Naomi--as you would have  loved your little child if it had lived.\"    Naomi cowered and moaned.    \"Oh, I wish I could believe THAT. I wouldn't be frightened if I could  believe that. MAKE me believe it. Surely you can make me believe that  there's love and forgiveness in God if you believe it yourself.\"    \"Jesus Christ forgave and loved the Magdalen, Naomi.\"    \"Jesus Christ? Oh, I ain't afraid of HIM. Yes, HE could understand and  forgive. He was half human. I tell you, it's God I'm skeered of.\"    \"They are one and the same,\" said Mr. Leonard helplessly. He knew he  could not make Naomi realize it. This anguished death-bed was no place  for a theological exposition on the mysteries of the Trinity.    \"Christ died for you, Naomi. He bore your sins in His own body on the  cross.\"    \"We bear our own sins,\" said Naomi fiercely. \"I've borne mine all my  life--and I'll bear them for all eternity. I can't believe anything  else. I CAN'T believe God can forgive me. I've ruined people body and  soul--I've broken hearts and poisoned homes--I'm worse than a murderess.  No--no--no, there's no hope for me.\" Her voice rose again into that  shrill, intolerable shriek. \"I've got to go to hell. It ain't so much  the fire I'm skeered of as the outer darkness. I've always been so  skeered of darkness--it's so full of awful things and thoughts. Oh,  there ain't nobody to help me! Man ain't no good and I'm too skeered of  God.\"    She wrung her hands. Mr. Leonard walked up and down the room in the  keenest anguish of spirit he had ever known. What could he do? What  could he say? There was healing and peace in his religion for this woman  as for all others, but he could express it in no language which this  tortured soul could understand. He looked at her writhing face; he  looked at the idiot girl chuckling to herself at the foot of the bed;  he looked through the open door to the remote, starlit night--and  a horrible sense of utter helplessness overcame him. He could do  nothing--nothing! In all his life he had never known such bitterness of  soul as the realization brought home to him.    \"What is the good of you if you can't help me?\" moaned the dying woman.  \"Pray--pray--pray!\" she shrilled suddenly.    Mr. Leonard dropped on his knees by the bed. He did not know what  to say. No prayer that he had ever prayed was of use here. The old,  beautiful formulas, which had soothed and helped the passing of many a  soul, were naught save idle, empty words to Naomi Clark. In his anguish  of mind Stephen Leonard gasped out the briefest and sincerest prayer his  lips had ever uttered.    \"O, God, our Father! Help this woman. Speak to her in a tongue which she  can understand.\"        A beautiful, white face appeared for a moment in the light that streamed  out of the doorway into the darkness of the night. No one noticed it,  and it quickly drew back into the shadow. Suddenly, Naomi fell back on  her pillow, her lips blue, her face horribly pinched, her eyes rolled up  in her head. Maggie started up, pushed Mr. Leonard aside, and proceeded  to administer some remedy with surprising skill and deftness. Mr.  Leonard, believing Naomi to be dying, went to the door, feeling sick and  bruised in soul.    Presently a figure stole out into the light.    \"Felix, is that you?\" said Mr. Leonard in a startled tone.    \"Yes, sir.\" Felix came up to the stone step. \"Janet got frightened that  you might fall on that rough road after dark, so she made me come after  you with a lantern. I've been waiting behind the point, but at last I  thought I'd better come and see if you would be staying much longer. If  you will be, I'll go back to Janet and leave the lantern here with you.\"  \"Yes, that will be the best thing to do. I may not be ready to go home  for some time yet,\" said Mr. Leonard, thinking that the death-bed of sin  behind him was no sight for Felix's young eyes.    \"Is that your grandson you're talking to?\" Naomi spoke clearly and  strongly. The spasm had passed. \"If it is, bring him in. I want to see  him.\"    Reluctantly, Mr. Leonard signed Felix to enter. The boy stood by Naomi's  bed and looked down at her with sympathetic eyes. But at first she did  not look at him--she looked past him at the minister.    \"I might have died in that spell,\" she said, with sullen reproach in her  voice, \"and if I had, I'd been in hell now. You can't help me--I'm done  with you. There ain't any hope for me, and I know it now.\"    She turned to Felix.    \"Take down that fiddle on the wall and play something for me,\" she said  imperiously. \"I'm dying--and I'm going to hell--and I don't want to  think of it. Play me something to take my thoughts off it--I don't care  what you play. I was always fond of music--there was always something in  it for me I never found anywhere else.\"    Felix looked at his grandfather. The old man nodded, he felt too ashamed  to speak; he sat with his fine silver head in his hands, while Felix  took down and tuned the old violin, on which so many godless lilts had  been played in many a wild revel. Mr. Leonard felt that he had failed  his religion. He could not give Naomi the help that was in it for her.    Felix drew the bow softly, perplexedly over the strings. He had no  idea what he should play. Then his eyes were caught and held by Naomi's  burning, mesmeric, blue gaze as she lay on her crumpled pillow. A  strange, inspired look came over the boy's face. He began to play as if  it were not he who played, but some mightier power, of which he was but  the passive instrument.    Sweet and soft and wonderful was the music that stole through the  room. Mr. Leonard forgot his heartbreak and listened to it in puzzled  amazement. He had never heard anything like it before. How could the  child play like that? He looked at Naomi and marvelled at the change  in her face. The fear and frenzy were going out of it; she listened  breathlessly, never taking her eyes from Felix. At the foot of the bed  the idiot girl sat with tears on her cheeks.    In that strange music was the joy of the innocent, mirthful childhood,  blent with the laughter of waves and the call of glad winds. Then it  held the wild, wayward dreams of youth, sweet and pure in all their  wildness and waywardness. They were followed by a rapture of young  love--all-surrendering, all-sacrificing love. The music changed. It  held the torture of unshed tears, the anguish of a heart deceived and  desolate. Mr. Leonard almost put his hands over his ears to shut out its  intolerable poignancy. But on the dying woman's face was only a strange  relief, as if some dumb, long-hidden pain had at last won to the healing  of utterance.    The sullen indifference of despair came next, the bitterness of  smouldering revolt and misery, the reckless casting away of all good.  There was something indescribably evil in the music now--so evil that  Mr. Leonard's white soul shuddered away in loathing, and Maggie cowered  and whined like a frightened animal.    Again the music changed. And in it now there was agony and fear--and  repentance and a cry for pardon. To Mr. Leonard there was something  strangely familiar in it. He struggled to recall where he had heard  it before; then he suddenly knew--he had heard it before Felix came in  Naomi's terrible words! He looked at his grandson with something like  awe. Here was a power of which he knew nothing--a strange and dreadful  power. Was it of God? Or of Satan?    For the last time the music changed. And now it was not music at all--it  was a great, infinite forgiveness, an all-comprehending love.

During the drive home  Mary could think and talk of nothing but Sadie Singmaster, and the  rugs she had promised to teach her to make at an early day. Elizabeth,  scarcely less enthusiastic, said: \"I've a lot of old things I'll give  her to cut up for carpet rags.\"    Reaching home, Mary could scarcely wait an opportunity to tell Aunt  Sarah all her plans for Sadie's betterment. When she finally did tell  her Aunt, she smiled and said: \"Mary, I'm not surprised. You are  always planning to do a kind act for some one. You remind me of the  lines, 'If I Can Live,' by Helen Hunt Jackson.\" And she repeated the  following for Mary:    IF I CAN LIVE.        If I can live      To make some pale face brighter and to give      A second luster to some tear-dimmed eye,        Or e'en impart        One throb of comfort to an aching heart,      Or cheer some wayworn soul in passing by;        If I can lend      A strong hand to the fallen, or defend      The right against a single envious strain,        My life, though bare,        Perhaps, of much that seemeth dear and fair      To us of earth, will not have been in vain.        The purest joy,      Most near to heaven, far from earth's alloy,      Is bidding cloud give way to sun and shine;        And 'twill be well        If on that day of days the angels tell      Of me, she did her best for one of Thine.          CHAPTER XVI.    OLD PARLOR MADE BEAUTIFUL (MODERNIZED).      When John Landis came into possession of \"Clear Spring\" Farm, where  his mother had lived during her lifetime, she having inherited it from  her father, the rooms of the old farm house were filled with quaint,  old-fashioned furniture of every description. \"Aunt Sarah,\" on coming  to the farm to live, had given a personal touch and cheery, homelike  look to every room in the house, with one exception, the large,  gloomy, old-fashioned parlor, which was cold, cheerless and damp. She  confessed to Mary she always felt as if John's dead-and-gone  ancestors' ghostly presences inhabited the silent room. The windows  were seldom opened to allow a ray of sunlight to penetrate the dusk  with which the room was always enveloped, except when the regular  weekly sweeping day arrived; when, after being carefully swept and  dusted, it was promptly closed. A room every one avoided, Aunt Sarah  was very particular about always having fresh air and sunlight in  every other part of the house but his one room. The old fireplace had  been boarded up many years before Aunt Sarah's advent to the farm, so  it could not be used. One day Mary noticed, while dusting the room  (after it had been given a thorough sweeping by Sibylla, Aunt Sarah's  one maid servant), that the small, many-paned windows facing the East,  at one end of the parlor, when opened, let in a flood of sunshine; and  in the evening those at the opposite end of the long room gave one a  lovely view of the setting sun--a finer picture than any painted by  the hand of a master. Mary easily persuaded her Aunt to make some  changes in the unlivable room. She suggested that they consult her  Uncle about repapering and painting the room and surprise him with the  result when finished.    Aunt Sarah, who never did things by halves, said: \"Mary, I have long  intended 'doing over' this room, but thought it such a great  undertaking. Now, with your assistance, I shall make a sweep of these  old, antiquated heirlooms of a past generation. This green carpet,  with its gorgeous bouquets of roses, we shall have combined with one  of brown and tan in the attic. Your Uncle shall take them with him  when he drives to town and have them woven into pretty, serviceable  rugs for the floor.\"    \"And, oh! Aunt Sarah,\" cried Mary, \"do let's have an open fireplace.  It makes a room so cheery and 'comfy' when the weather gets colder, on  long winter evenings, to have a fire in the grate. I saw some lovely,  old brass andirons and fender in the attic, and some brass  candlesticks there also, which will do nicely for the mantel shelf  over the fireplace. I'll shine 'em up, and instead of this  hideously-ugly old wall paper with gay-colored scrawley figures, Aunt  Sarah, suppose we get an inexpensive, plain, tan felt paper for drop  ceiling and separate it from the paper on the side wall, which should  be a warm, yellow-brown, with a narrow chestnut wood molding. Then  this dull, dark, gray-blue painted woodwork; could any one imagine  anything more hideously ugly? It gives me the 'blues' simply to look  at it. Could we not have it painted to imitate chestnut wood? And  don't you think we might paint the floor around the edges of the rug  to imitate the woodwork? Just think of those centre panels of the door  painted a contrasting shade of pale pink. The painter who did this  work certainly was an artist. A friend of mine in the city, wishing to  use rugs instead of carpets on her floors, and not caring to go to the  expense of laying hardwood floors, gave the old floors a couple of  coats of light lemon, or straw-colored paint, then stained and grained  them a perfect imitation of chestnut, at small expense. The floors  were greatly admired when finished, and having been allowed to dry  thoroughly after being varnished, proved quite durable. I will write  to my friend at once and ask her exactly how her floors were treated.\"    \"Now, Mary, about this old-style furniture. The old grandfather clock  standing in the corner, at the upper end of the room, I should like to  have remain. It is one hundred and fifty years old and belonged to my  folks, and, although old-fashioned, is highly valued by me.\"    \"Of course,\" said Mary, \"we'll certainly leave that in the room.\"    \"Also,\" said Aunt Sarah, \"allow the old cottage organ and large,  old-fashioned bookcase belonging to your Uncle to remain. He has  frequently spoken of moving his bookcase into the next room, when he  was obliged to come in here for books, of which he has quite a  valuable collection.\"    [Illustration:    A-24 Seed Wreath  A-25 Wax Fruit  A-26 Old Parlor Mantel  A-27 Old Clock  A-28 Boquet of Hair Flowers ]    \"Oh,\" said Mary, \"no need of that. We will move Uncle John in here,  near the bookcase, when we get our room fixed up. Aunt Sarah, we will  leave that old-fashioned table, also, with one leaf up against the  wall, and this quaint, little, rush-bottomed rocker, which I just dote  on.\"    \"Why, dear,\" exclaimed Aunt Sarah, \"there are several chairs to match  it in the attic, which you may have when you start housekeeping for  your very own. And,\" laughingly, said her Aunt, \"there is another old,  oval, marble-topped table in the attic, containing a large glass case  covering a basket of wax fruit, which you may have.\"    \"No, Aunt Sarah,\" said Mary, \"I don't believe I want the fruit, but I  will accept your offer of the table. Well, Aunt Sarah, I know you  won't have this old, black what-not standing in the corner of the  room. I do believe it is made of spools, strung on wire, as supports  for the shelves; then all painted black, imitation of ebony, I  suppose. It must have been made in the Black Age, at the same time the  old corner cupboard was painted, as Uncle John told me he scraped off  three different layers of paint before doing it over, and one was  black. It was originally made of cherry. It certainly looks fine now,  with those new brass hinges and pretty, old-fashioned glass knobs.\"    \"Yes, Mary,\" replied her Aunt, \"and there is an old corner cupboard in  the attic which belonged to my father, that you may have, and, with a  very little labor and expense, Ralph can make it look as well as mine.  It has only one door and mine possesses two.\"    \"Aunt Sarah,\" exclaimed Mary, \"you are a dear! How will I ever repay  you for all your kindness to me?\"    \"By passing it on to some one else when you find some one needing  help,\" said Aunt Sarah.    \"Such a collection of odd things, Aunt Sarah, as are on this what-not  I never saw. Old ambrotypes and daguerreotypes of gone and forgotten  members of the 'freinshoft,' as you sometimes say. I don't believe you  know any of them.\"    \"Yes, the red plush frame on the mantel shelf contains a picture of  John's Uncle, a fine-looking man, but he possessed 'Wanderlust' and  has lived in California for many years.    \"Oh, you mean the picture on the mantel standing near those twin  gilded china vases, gay with red and blue paint?\"    \"Yes; and that small china and gilt stand with little bowl and pitcher  was given me when a small child.\"    \"Suppose I bring a basket and we will fill it with articles from the  mantel and what-not,\" said Mary, \"and carry them all to the attic,  until you have a rummage sale some day. We'll burn these 'everlasting'  and 'straw' flowers, and pampas grass, and this large apple stuck full  of cloves. Here is a small china dog and a little china basket with a  plaited china handle decorated with gilt, and tiny, pink-tinted china  roses. And these large, glass marbles containing little silver eagles  inside; also this small, spun-glass ship and blue-and-pink-striped  glass pipe. Aunt Sarah, some of your ancestors must have attended a  glass blowers' exhibition in years past.\"    \"This branch of white coral, these large snail shells (when a child I  remember holding them to my ear to hear a noise resembling the roar of  the ocean), and this small basket, fashioned of twigs and tendrils of  grape vine, then dipped in red sealing wax, certainly is a good  imitation of coral, and this plate, containing a miniature ship  composed of green postage stamps, we will place in your corner  cupboard.\"    \"And, Aunt Sarah, I suppose this deep, glass-covered picture frame  containing a bouquet of hair flowers, most wonderfully and fearfully  made, was considered a work of art in days past and gone, as was also  the crescent in a frame on the opposite side of the room, composed of  flowers made of various seeds of grain and"]]]
