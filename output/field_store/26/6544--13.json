But as it was she tried to lure  Kazan more and more to the cabin, and slowly she won.    At last the great day came, eight days after the fight on the Sun Rock.  Kazan had taken Gray Wolf to a wooded point on the river two days  before, and there he had left her the preceding night when he went to  the cabin. This time a stout babiche thong was tied to the collar round  his neck, and he was fastened to a staple in the log wall. Joan and her  husband were up before it was light next day. The sun was just rising  when they all went out, the man carrying the baby, and Joan leading him.  Joan turned and locked the cabin door, and Kazan heard a sob in her  throat as they followed the man down to the river. The big canoe was  packed and waiting. Joan got in first, with the baby. Then, still  holding the babiche thong, she drew Kazan up close to her, so that he  lay with his weight against her.    The sun fell warmly on Kazan's back as they shoved off, and he closed  his eyes, and rested his head on Joan's lap. Her hand fell softly on his  shoulder. He heard again that sound which the man could not hear, the  broken sob in her throat, as the canoe moved slowly down to the wooded  point.    Joan waved her hand back at the cabin, just disappearing behind the  trees.    \"Good-by!\" she cried sadly. \"Good-by--\" And then she buried her face  close down to Kazan and the baby, and sobbed.    The man stopped paddling.    \"You're not sorry--Joan?\" he asked.    They were drifting past the point now, and the scent of Gray Wolf came  to Kazan's nostrils, rousing him, and bringing a low whine from his  throat.    \"You're not sorry--we're going?\" Joan shook her head.    \"No,\" she replied. \"Only I've--always lived here--in the forests--and  they're--home!\"    The point with its white finger of sand, was behind them now. And Kazan  was standing rigid, facing it. The man called to him, and Joan lifted  her head. She, too, saw the point, and suddenly the babiche leash  slipped from her fingers, and a strange light leaped into her blue eyes  as she saw what stood at the end of that white tip of sand. It was Gray  Wolf. Her blind eyes were turned toward Kazan. At last Gray Wolf, the  faithful, understood. Scent told her what her eyes could not see. Kazan  and the man-smell were together. And they were going--going--going--    \"Look!\" whispered Joan.    The man turned. Gray Wolf's forefeet were in the water. And now, as the  canoe drifted farther and farther away, she settled back on her  haunches, raised her head to the sun which she could not see and gave  her last long wailing cry for Kazan.    The canoe lurched. A tawny body shot through the air--and Kazan was  gone.    The man reached forward for his rifle. Joan's hand stopped him. Her  face was white.    \"Let him go back to her! Let him go--let him go!\" she cried. \"It is his  place--with her.\"    And Kazan reaching the shore, shook the water from his shaggy hair, and  looked for the last time toward the woman. The canoe was drifting slowly  around the first bend. A moment more and it had disappeared. Gray Wolf  had won.          CHAPTER X    THE DAYS OF FIRE      From the night of the terrible fight with the big gray lynx on the top  of the Sun Rock, Kazan remembered less and less vividly the old days  when he had been a sledge-dog, and the leader of a pack. He would never  quite forget them, and always there would stand out certain memories  from among the rest, like fires cutting the blackness of night. But as  man dates events from his birth, his marriage, his freedom from a  bondage, or some foundation-step in his career, so all things seemed to  Kazan to begin with two tragedies which had followed one fast upon the  other after the birth of Gray Wolf's pups.    The first was the fight on the Sun Rock, when the big gray lynx had  blinded his beautiful wolf mate for all time, and had torn her pups into  pieces. He in turn had killed the lynx. But Gray Wolf was still blind.  Vengeance had not been able to give her sight. She could no longer hunt  with him, as they had hunted with the wild wolf-packs out on the plain,  and in the dark forests. So at thought of that night he always snarled,  and his lips curled back to reveal his inch-long fangs.    The other tragedy was the going of Joan, her baby and her husband.  Something more infallible than reason told Kazan that they would not  come back. Brightest of all the pictures that remained with him was that  of the sunny morning when the woman and the baby he loved, and the man  he endured because of them, had gone away in the canoe, and often he  would go to the point, and gaze longingly down-stream, where he had  leaped from the canoe to return to his blind mate.    So Kazan's life seemed now to be made up chiefly of three things: his  hatred of everything that bore the scent or mark of the lynx, his  grieving for Joan and the baby, and Gray Wolf. It was natural that the  strongest passion in him should be his hatred of the lynx, for not only  Gray Wolf's blindness and the death of the pups, but even the loss of  the woman and the baby he laid to that fatal struggle on the Sun Rock.  From that hour he became the deadliest enemy of the lynx tribe. Wherever  he struck the scent of the big gray cat he was turned into a snarling  demon, and his hatred grew day by day, as he became more completely a  part of the wild.    He found that Gray Wolf was more necessary to him now than she had ever  been since the day she had left the wolf-pack for him. He was  three-quarters dog, and the dog-part of him demanded companionship.  There was only Gray Wolf to give him that now. They were alone.  Civilization was four hundred miles south of them. The nearest Hudson's  Bay post was sixty miles to the west. Often, in the days of the woman  and the baby, Gray Wolf had spent her nights alone out in the forest,  waiting and calling for Kazan. Now it was Kazan who was lonely and  uneasy when he was away from her side.    In her blindness Gray Wolf could no longer hunt with her mate. But  gradually a new code of understanding grew up between them, and through  her blindness they learned many things that they had not known before.  By early summer Gray Wolf could travel with Kazan, if he did not move  too swiftly. She ran at his flank, with her shoulder or muzzle touching  him, and Kazan learned not to leap, but to trot. Very quickly he found  that he must choose the easiest trails for Gray Wolf's feet. When they  came to a space to be bridged by a leap, he would muzzle Gray Wolf and  whine, and she would stand with ears alert--listening. Then Kazan would  take the leap, and she understood the distance she had to cover. She  always over-leaped, which was a good fault.    In another way, and one that was destined to serve them many times in  the future, she became of greater help than ever to Kazan. Scent and  hearing entirely took the place of sight. Each day developed these  senses more and more, and at the same time there developed between them  the dumb language whereby she could impress upon Kazan what she had  discovered by scent or sound. It became a curious habit of Kazan's  always to look at Gray Wolf when they stopped to listen, or to scent the  air.    After the fight on the Sun Rock, Kazan had taken his blind mate to a  thick clump of spruce and balsam in the river-bottom, where they  remained until early summer. Every day for weeks Kazan went to the cabin  where Joan and the baby--and the man--had been. For a long time he went  hopefully, looking each day or night to see some sign of life there. But  the door was never open. The boards and saplings at the windows always  remained. Never a spiral of smoke rose from the clay chimney. Grass and  vines began to grow in the path. And fainter and fainter grew that scent  which Kazan could still find about it--the scent of man, of the woman,  the baby.    One day he found a little baby moccasin under one of the closed windows.  It was old, and worn out, and blackened by snow and rain, but he lay  down beside it, and remained there for a long time, while the baby  Joan--a thousand miles away--was playing with the strange toys of  civilization. Then he returned to Gray Wolf among the spruce and balsam.    The cabin was the one place to which Gray Wolf would not follow him. At  all other times she was at his side. Now that she had become accustomed  to blindness, she even accompanied him on his hunts, until he struck  game, and began the chase. Then she would wait for him. Kazan usually  hunted the big snow-shoe rabbits. But one night he ran down and killed a  young doe. The kill was too heavy to drag to Gray Wolf, so he returned  to where she was waiting for him and guided her to the feast. In many  ways they became more and more inseparable as the summer lengthened,  until at last, through all the wilderness, their footprints were always  two by two and never one by one.    Then came the great fire.    Gray Wolf caught the scent of it when it was still two days to the west.  The sun that night went down in a lurid cloud. The moon, drifting into  the west, became blood red. When it dropped behind the wilderness in  this manner, the Indians called it the Bleeding Moon, and the air was  filled with omens.    All the next day Gray Wolf was nervous, and toward noon Kazan caught in  the air the warning that she had sensed many hours ahead of him.  Steadily the scent grew stronger, and by the middle of the afternoon the  sun was veiled by a film of smoke.    The flight of the wild things from the triangle of forest between the  junctions of the Pipestone and Cree Rivers would have begun then, but  the wind shifted. It was a fatal shift. The fire was raging from the  west and south. Then the wind swept straight eastward,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10114"],[0,"The Great Events (#14)"],[1,"its particular  glory from unshaken bearing up against misfortune: her power, her name,  her empire of Greeks over Greeks, are such as have never before been  seen; and if we choose to be great, we must take the consequence of that  temporary envy and hatred which is the necessary price of permanent  renown. Behave ye now in a manner worthy of that glory: display that  courage which is essential to protect you against disgrace at present,  as well as to guarantee your honor for the future. Send no further  embassy to Sparta, and bear your misfortunes without showing symptoms of  distress.\"    The irresistible reason, as well as the proud and resolute bearing of  this discourse, set forth with an eloquence which it was not possible  for Thucydides to reproduce--together with the age and character of  Pericles--carried the assent of the assembled people, who when in the  Pnyx, and engaged according to habit on public matters, would for a  moment forget their private sufferings in considerations of the safety  and grandeur of Athens. Possibly, indeed, those sufferings, though still  continuing, might become somewhat alleviated when the invaders quitted  Attica, and when it was no longer indispensable for all the population  to confine itself within the walls. Accordingly, the assembly resolved  that no further propositions should be made for peace, and that the war  should be prosecuted with vigor.    But though the public resolution thus adopted showed the ancient habit  of deference to the authority of Pericles, the sentiments of individuals  taken separately were still those of anger against him as the author of  that system which had brought them into so much distress. His political  opponents--Cleon, Simmias, or Lacratidas, perhaps all three in  conjunction--took care to provide an opportunity for this prevalent  irritation to manifest itself in act, by bringing an accusation against  him before the _dicastery_. The accusation is said to have been  preferred on the ground of pecuniary malversation, and ended by his  being sentenced to pay a considerable fine, the amount of which is  differently reported--fifteen, fifty, or eighty talents, by different  authors. The accusing party thus appeared to have carried their point,  and to have disgraced, as well as excluded from reelection, the veteran  statesman. The event, however, disappointed their expectations. The  imposition of the fine not only satiated all the irritation of the  people against him, but even occasioned a serious reaction in his favor,  and brought back as strongly as ever the ancient sentiment of esteem and  admiration. It was quickly found that those who had succeeded Pericles  as generals neither possessed nor deserved in an equal degree the public  confidence. He was accordingly soon reelected, with as much power and  influence as he had ever in his life enjoyed.    But that life, long, honorable, and useful, had already been prolonged  considerably beyond the sixtieth year, and there were but too many  circumstances, besides the recent fine, which tended to hasten as well  as to embitter its close. At the very moment when Pericles was preaching  to his countrymen, in a tone almost reproachful, the necessity of manful  and unabated devotion to the common country in the midst of private  suffering, he was himself among the greatest of sufferers, and most  hardly pressed to set the example of observing his own precepts. The  epidemic carried off not merely his two sons--the only two legitimate,  Xanthippus and Paralus--but also his sister, several other relatives,  and his best and most useful political friends. Amid this train of  domestic calamities, and in the funeral obsequies of so many of his  dearest friends, he remained master of his grief, and maintained his  habitual self-command, until the last misfortune--the death of his  favorite son Paralus, which left his house without any legitimate  representative to maintain the family and the hereditary sacred rites.  On this final blow, though he strove to command himself as before, yet  at the obsequies of the young man, when it became his duty to place a  wreath on the dead body, his grief became uncontrollable, and he burst  out, for the first time in his life, into profuse tears and sobbing.    In the midst of these several personal trials he received the  intimation, through Alcibiades and some other friends, of the restored  confidence of the people toward him, and of his reelection to the office  of strategus. But it was not without difficulty that he was persuaded to  present himself again at the public assembly and resume the direction of  affairs. The regret of the people was formally expressed to him for the  recent sentence--perhaps, indeed, the fine may have been repaid to him,  or some evasion of it permitted, saving the forms of law--in the present  temper of the city; which was further displayed toward him by the grant  of a remarkable exemption from a law of his own original proposition.    He had himself, some years before, been the author of that law whereby  the citizenship of Athens was restricted to persons born both of  Athenian fathers and Athenian mothers, under which restriction several  thousand persons, illegitimate on the mother's side, are said to have  been deprived of the citizenship, on occasion of a public distribution  of corn. Invidious as it appeared to grant, to Pericles singly, an  exemption from a law which had been strictly enforced against so many  others, the people were now moved not less by compassion than by anxiety  to redress their own previous severity. Without a legitimate heir, the  house of Pericles, one branch of the great Alcmaeonid gens by his  mother's side, would be left deserted, and the continuity of the family  sacred rites would be broken--a misfortune painfully felt by every  Athenian family, as calculated to wrong all the deceased members, and  provoke their posthumous displeasure toward the city. Accordingly,  permission was granted to Pericles to legitimize, and to inscribe in his  own gens and phratry, his natural son by Aspasia, who bore his own name.    It was thus that Pericles was reinstated in his post of strategus as  well as in his ascendency over the public counsels--seemingly about  August or September, B.C. 430. He lived about one year longer, and seems  to have maintained his influence as long as his health permitted. Yet we  hear nothing of him after this moment, and he fell a victim, not to the  violent symptoms of the epidemic, but to a slow and wearing fever, which  undermined his strength as well as his capacity. To a friend who came to  ask after him when in this disease, Pericles replied by showing a charm  or amulet which his female relations had hung about his neck--a proof  how low he was reduced, and how completely he had become a passive  subject in the hands of others.    And according to another anecdote which we read--yet more interesting  and equally illustrative of his character--it was during his last  moments, when he was lying apparently unconscious and insensible, that  the friends around his bed were passing in review the acts of his life,  and the nine trophies which he had erected at different times for so  many victories. He heard what they said, though they fancied that he was  past hearing, and interrupted them by remarking: \"What you praise in my  life belongs partly to good fortune--and is, at best, common to me with  many other generals. But the peculiarity of which I am most proud, you  have not noticed--no Athenian has ever put on mourning through any  action of mine.\"          DEFEAT OF THE ATHENIANS AT SYRACUSE    B.C. 413    SIR EDWARD SHEPHERD CREASY      (That great writer of the history of the Romans, Thomas Arnold, says of  the defeat of the Athenian fleet at Syracuse: \"The Romans knew not, and  could not know, how deeply the greatness of their own posterity, and the  fate of the whole western world, were involved in the destruction of the  fleet of Athens in the harbor of Syracuse. Had that great expedition  proved victorious, the energies of Greece during the next eventful  century would have found their field in the West no less than in the  East; Greece, and not Rome; might have conquered Carthage; Greek instead  of Latin might have been at this day the principal element of the  language of Spain, of France, and of Italy; and the laws of Athens,  rather than of Rome, might be the foundation of the law of the civilized  world.\"    The foregoing, the author's own selection, really sums up all that need  be said as to the importance of the great event so finely treated by  Creasy.)      Few cities have undergone more memorable sieges during ancient and  mediaeval times than has the city of Syracuse. Athenian, Carthaginian,  Roman, Vandal, Byzantine, Saracen, and Norman have in turns beleaguered  her walls; and the resistance which she successfully opposed to some of  her early assailants was of the deepest importance, not only to the  fortunes of the generations then in being, but to all the subsequent  current of human events. To adopt the eloquent expressions of Arnold  respecting the check which she gave to the Carthaginian arms, \"Syracuse  was a breakwater which God's providence raised up to protect the yet  immature strength of Rome.\" And her triumphant repulse of the great  Athenian expedition against her was of even more widespread and enduring  importance. It forms a decisive epoch in the strife for universal  empire, in which all the great states of antiquity successively engaged  and failed.    The present city of Syracuse is a place of little or no military  strength, as the fire of artillery from the neighboring heights would  almost completely command it. But in ancient warfare its position, and  the care bestowed on its walls, rendered it formidably strong against  the means of offence which were then employed by besieging armies.
