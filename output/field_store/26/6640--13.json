Both the Roman Catholic, therefore,  and the Buddhist may admit many of the marvels attributed to the relics  of each other's saints; though, in denying that these marvels prove the  accuracy of each other's religious doctrines, each should remember that  the same is true of his own.      (1) The subject is rather too technical to deal with here. I have  discussed it elsewhere; see \"Thermo-Dynamical Objections to the  Mechanical Theory of Life,\" _The Chemical News_, vol. cxii. pp. 271 _et  seq_. (3rd December 1915).    (2) For instance, the well-known physicist, Sir W. F. BARRETT, F.R.S.  (late Professor of Experimental Physics in The Royal College of Science  for Ireland). See his _On the Threshold of a New World of Thought_  (1908), SE 10.      In illustration of the real power of the imagination, I may instance the  Maori superstition of the Taboo. According to the Maories, anyone who  touches a tabooed object will assuredly die, the tabooed object being  a sort of \"anti-talisman\". Professor FRAZER(1) says: \"Cases have  been known of Maories dying of sheer fright on learning that they had  unwittingly eaten the remains of a chief's dinner or handled something  that belonged to him,\" since such objects were, _ipso facto_, tabooed.  He gives the following case on good authority: \"A woman, having partaken  of some fine peaches from a basket, was told that they had come from  a tabooed place. Immediately the basket dropped from her hands and she  cried out in agony that the atua or godhead of the chief, whose divinity  had been thus profaned, would kill her. That happened in the afternoon,  and next day by twelve o'clock she was dead.\" For us the power of the  taboo does not exist; for the Maori, who implicitly believes in it, it  is a very potent reality, but this power of the taboo resides not in  external objects but in his own mind.      (1) Professor J. G. FRAZER, D.C.L.: _Psyche's Task_ (1909), p. 7.      Dr HADDON(2) quotes a similar but still more remarkable story of a young  Congo negro which very strikingly shows the power of the imagination.  The young negro, \"being on a journey, lodged at a friend's house; the  latter got a wild hen for his breakfast, and the young man asked if it  were a wild hen. His host answered 'No.' Then he fell on heartily, and  afterwards proceeded on his journey. After four years these two met  together again, and his old friend asked him 'if he would eat a wild  hen,' to which he answered that it was tabooed to him. Hereat the host  began immediately to laugh, inquiring of him, 'What made him refuse it  now, when he had eaten one at his table about four years ago?' At the  hearing of this the negro immediately fell a-trembling, and suffered  himself to be so far possessed with the effects of imagination that he  died in less than twenty-four hours after.\"      (2) ALFRED C. HADDON, SC.D., F.R.S.: _Magic and Fetishism_ (1906), p.  56.      There are, of course, many stories about amulets, _etc_., which cannot  be thus explained. For example, ELIHU RICH gives the following:--    \"In 1568, we are told (Transl. of Salverte, p. 196) that the Prince of  Orange condemned a Spanish prisoner to be shot at Juliers. The soldiers  tied him to a tree and fired, but he was invulnerable. They then  stripped him to see what armour he wore, but they found only an amulet  bearing the figure of a lamb (the _Agnus Dei_, we presume). This was  taken from him, and he was then killed by the first shot. De Baros  relates that the Portuguese in like manner vainly attempted to destroy  a Malay, so long as he wore a bracelet containing a bone set in gold,  which rendered him proof against their swords. A similar marvel is  related in the travels of the veracious Marco Polo. 'In an attempt of  Kublai Khan to make a conquest of the island of Zipangu, a jealousy  arose between the two commanders of the expedition, which led to an  order for putting the whole garrison to the sword. In obedience to this  order, the heads of all were cut off excepting of eight persons, who  by the efficacy of a diabolical charm, consisting of a jewel or amulet  introduced into the right arm, between the skin and the flesh, were  rendered secure from the effects of iron, either to kill or wound. Upon  this discovery being made, they were beaten with a heavy wooden club,  and presently died.'\"    (1) I think, however, that these, and many similar stories, must be  taken _cum grano salis_.    In conclusion, mention must be made of a very interesting and suggestive  philosophical doctrine--the Law of Correspondences,--due in its explicit  form to the Swedish philosopher, who was both scientist and mystic,  EMANUEL SWEDENBORG. To deal in any way adequately with this important  topic is totally impossible within the confines of the present  discussion.(2) But, to put the matter as briefly as possible, it may be  said that SWEDENBORG maintains (and the conclusion, I think, is valid)  that all causation is from the spiritual world, physical causation being  but secondary, or apparent--that is to say, a mere reflection, as it  were, of the true process. He argues from this, thereby supplying a  philosophical basis for the unanimous belief of the nature-mystics, that  every natural object is the symbol (because the creation) of an idea or  spiritual verity in its widest sense. Thus, there are symbols which are  inherent in the nature of things, and symbols which are not. The  former are genuine, the latter merely artificial. Writing from the  transcendental point of view, ELIPHAS LEVI says: \"Ceremonies, vestments,  perfumes, characters and figures being...necessary to enlist the  imagination in the education of the will, the success of magical works  depends upon the faithful observance of all the rites, which are in  no sense fantastic or arbitrary, having been transmitted to us  by antiquity, and permanently subsisting by the essential laws of  analogical realisation and of the correspondence which inevitably  connects ideas and forms.\"(1b) Some scepticism, perhaps, may be  permitted as to the validity of the latter part of this statement, and  the former may be qualified by the proviso that such things are only of  value in the right education of the will, if they are, indeed, genuine,  and not merely artificial, symbols. But the writer, as I think will  be admitted, has grasped the essential point, and, to conclude our  excursion, as we began it, with a definition, I will say that _the power  of the talisman is the power of the mind (or imagination) brought into  activity by means of a suitable symbol_.      (1) ELIHU RICH: _The Occult Sciences_, p. 346.    (2) I may refer the reader to my _A Mathematical Theory of Spirit_  (1912), chap. i., for a more adequate statement.

CEREMONIAL MAGIC IN THEORY AND PRACTICE    THE word \"magic,\" if one may be permitted to say so, is itself almost  magical--magical in its power to conjure up visions in the human mind.  For some these are of bloody rites, pacts with the powers of darkness,  and the lascivious orgies of the Saturnalia or Witches' Sabbath; in  other minds it has pleasanter associations, serving to transport them  from the world of fact to the fairyland of fancy, where the purse of  FORTUNATUS, the lamp and ring of ALADDIN, fairies, gnomes, jinn, and  innumerable other strange beings flit across the scene in a marvellous  kaleidoscope of ever-changing wonders. To the study of the magical  beliefs of the past cannot be denied the interest and fascination which  the marvellous and wonderful ever has for so many minds, many of whom,  perhaps, cannot resist the temptation of thinking that there may be some  element of truth in these wonderful stories. But the study has a  greater claim to our attention; for, as I have intimated already, magic  represents a phase in the development of human thought, and the magic  of the past was the womb from which sprang the science of the present,  unlike its parent though it be.    What then is magic? According to the dictionary definition--and this  will serve us for the present--it is the (pretended) art of producing  marvellous results by the aid of spiritual beings or arcane spiritual  forces. Magic, therefore, is the practical complement of animism.  Wherever man has really believed in the existence of a spiritual world,  there do we find attempts to enter into communication with that world's  inhabitants and to utilise its forces.Professor LEUBA(1) and others  distinguish between propitiative behaviour towards the beings of  the spiritual world, as marking the religious attitude, and coercive  behaviour towards these beings as characteristic of the magical  attitude; but one form of behaviour merges by insensible degrees into  the other, and the distinction (though a useful one) may, for our  present purpose, be neglected.      (1) JAMES H. LEUBA: _The Psychological Origin and the Nature of  Religion_ (1909), chap. ii.      Animism, \"the Conception of Spirit everywhere\" as Mr EDWARD CLODD(2)  neatly calls it, and perhaps man's earliest view of natural phenomena,  persisted in a modified form, as I have pointed out in \"Some  Characteristics of Mediaeval Thought,\" throughout the Middle Ages.  A belief in magic persisted likewise. In the writings of the Greek  philosophers of the Neo-Platonic school, in that curious body of  esoteric Jewish lore known as the Kabala, and in the works of later  occult philosophers such as AGRIPPA and PARACELSUS, we find magic, or  rather the theory upon which magic as an art was based, presented in  its most philosophical"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12753"],[0,"The Legends of King Arthur and His Knights (#14)"],[1,"to Camelot, where  young Sir Galahad achieved it, as shall be told hereafter.          CHAPTER VI    _The Marriage of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere, and the Founding of the  Round Table--The Adventure of the Hart and Hound_      It befell upon a certain day, that King Arthur said to Merlin, \"My lords  and knights do daily pray me now to take a wife; but I will have none  without thy counsel, for thou hast ever helped me since I came first to  this crown.\"    \"It is well,\" said Merlin, \"that thou shouldst take a wife, for no man of  bounteous and noble nature should live without one; but is there any lady  whom thou lovest better than another?\"    \"Yea,\" said King Arthur, \"I love Guinevere, the daughter of King  Leodegrance, of Camelgard, who also holdeth in his house the Round Table  that he had from my father Uther; and as I think, that damsel is the  gentlest and the fairest lady living.\"    \"Sir,\" answered Merlin, \"as for her beauty, she is one of the fairest that  do live; but if ye had not loved her as ye do, I would fain have had ye  choose some other who was both fair and good. But where a man's heart is  set, he will be loath to leave.\" This Merlin said, knowing the misery  that should hereafter happen from this marriage.    Then King Arthur sent word to King Leodegrance that he mightily desired to  wed his daughter, and how that he had loved her since he saw her first,  when with Kings Ban and Bors he rescued Leodegrance from King Ryence of  North Wales.    When King Leodegrance heard the message, he cried out \"These be the best  tidings I have heard in all my life--so great and worshipful a prince to  seek my daughter for his wife! I would fain give him half my lands with  her straightway, but that he needeth none--and better will it please him  that I send him the Round Table of King Uther, his father, with a hundred  good knights towards the furnishing of it with guests, for he will soon  find means to gather more, and make the table full.\"    Then King Leodegrance delivered his daughter Guinevere to the messengers  of King Arthur, and also the Round Table with the hundred knights.    So they rode royally and freshly, sometimes by water and sometimes by  land, towards Camelot. And as they rode along in the spring weather, they  made full many sports and pastimes. And, in all those sports and games, a  young knight lately come to Arthur's court, Sir Lancelot by name, was  passing strong, and won praise from all, being full of grace and  hardihood; and Guinevere also ever looked on him with joy. And always in  the eventide, when the tents were set beside some stream or forest, many  minstrels came and sang before the knights and ladies as they sat in the  tent-doors, and many knights would tell adventures; and still Sir Lancelot  was foremost, and told the knightliest tales, and sang the goodliest  songs, of all the company.    And when they came to Camelot, King Arthur made great joy, and all the  city with him; and riding forth with a great retinue he met Guinevere and  her company, and led her through the streets all filled with people, and  in the midst of all their shoutings and the ringing of church bells, to a  palace hard by his own.    Then, in all haste, the king commanded to prepare the marriage and the  coronation with the stateliest and most honourable pomp that could be  made. And when the day was come, the archbishops led the king to the  cathedral, whereto he walked, clad in his royal robes, and having four  kings, bearing four golden swords, before him; a choir of passing sweet  music going also with him.    In another part, was the queen dressed in her richest ornaments, and led  by archbishops and bishops to the Chapel of the Virgins, the four queens  also of the four kings last mentioned walked before her, bearing four  white doves, according to ancient custom; and after her there followed  many damsels, singing and making every sign of joy.    And when the two processions were come to the churches, so wondrous was  the music and the singing, that all the knights and barons who were there  pressed on each other, as in the crowd of battle, to hear and see the most  they might.    When the king was crowned, he called together all the knights that came  with the Round Table from Camelgard, and twenty-eight others, great and  valiant men, chosen by Merlin out of all the realm, towards making up the  full number of the table. Then the Archbishop of Canterbury blessed the  seats of all the knights, and when they rose again therefrom to pay their  homage to King Arthur there was found upon the back of each knight's seat  his name, written in letters of gold. But upon one seat was found written,  \"This is the Siege Perilous, wherein if any man shall sit save him whom  Heaven hath chosen, he shall be devoured by fire.\"    Anon came young Gawain, the king's nephew, praying to be made a knight,  whom the king knighted then and there. Soon after came a poor man, leading  with him a tall fair lad of eighteen years of age, riding on a lean mare.  And falling at the king's feet, the poor man said, \"Lord, it was told me,  that at this time of thy marriage thou wouldst give to any man the gift he  asked for, so it were not unreasonable.\"    \"That is the truth,\" replied King Arthur, \"and I will make it good.\"    \"Thou sayest graciously and nobly,\" said the poor man. \"Lord, I ask  nothing else but that thou wilt make my son here a knight.\"    \"It is a great thing that thou askest,\" said the king. \"What is thy name?\"    \"Aries, the cowherd,\" answered he.    \"Cometh this prayer from thee or from thy son?\" inquired King Arthur.    \"Nay, lord, not from myself,\" said he, \"but from him only, for I have  thirteen other sons, and all of them will fall to any labour that I put  them to. But this one will do no such work for anything that I or my wife  may do, but is for ever shooting or fighting, and running to see knights  and joustings, and torments me both night and day that he be made a  knight.\"    \"What is thy name?\" said the king to the young man.    \"My name is Tor,\" said he.    Then the king, looking at him steadfastly, was well pleased with his face  and figure, and with his look of nobleness and strength.    \"Fetch all thy other sons before me,\" said the king to Aries. But when he  brought them, none of them resembled Tor in size or shape or feature.    Then the king knighted Tor, saying, \"Be thou to thy life's end a good  knight and a true, as I pray God thou mayest be; and if thou provest  worthy, and of prowess, one day thou shall be counted in the Round Table.\"  Then turning to Merlin, Arthur said, \"Prophesy now, O Merlin, shall Sir  Tor become a worthy knight, or not?\"    \"Yea, lord,\" said Merlin, \"so he ought to be, for he is the son of that  King Pellinore whom thou hast met, and proved to be one of the best  knights living. He is no cowherd's son.\"    Presently after came in King Pellinore, and when he saw Sir Tor he knew  him for his son, and was more pleased than words can tell to find him  knighted by the king. And Pellinore did homage to King Arthur, and was  gladly and graciously accepted of the king; and then was led by Merlin to  a high seat at the Table Round, near to the Perilous Seat.    But Sir Gawain was full of anger at the honour done King Pellinore, and  said to his brother Gaheris, \"He slew our father, King Lot, therefore will  I slay him.\"    \"Do it not yet,\" said he; \"wait till I also be a knight, then will I help  ye in it: it is best ye suffer him to go at this time, and not trouble  this high feast with bloodshed.\"    \"As ye will, be it,\" said Sir Gawain.    Then rose the king and spake to all the Table Round, and charged them to  be ever true and noble knights, to do neither outrage nor murder, nor any  unjust violence, and always to flee treason; also by no means ever to be  cruel, but give mercy unto him that asked for mercy, upon pain of  forfeiting the liberty of his court for evermore. Moreover, at all times,  on pain of death, to give all succour unto ladies and young damsels; and  lastly, never to take part in any wrongful quarrel, for reward or payment.  And to all this he swore them knight by knight.    Then he ordained that, every year at Pentecost, they should all come  before him, wheresoever he might appoint a place, and give account of all  their doings and adventures of the past twelvemonth. And so, with prayer  and blessing, and high words of cheer, he instituted the most noble order  of the Round Table, whereto the best and bravest knights in all the world  sought afterwards to find admission.    Then was the high feast made ready, and the king and queen sat side by  side, before the whole assembly; and great and royal was the banquet and  the pomp.    And as they sat, each man in his place, Merlin went round and said, \"Sit  still awhile, for ye shall see a strange and marvellous adventure.\"    So as they sat, there suddenly came running through the hall, a white  hart, with a white hound next after him, and thirty couple of black  running hounds, making full cry; and the hart made circuit of the Table  Round, and past the other tables; and suddenly the white hound flew upon  him and bit him fiercely, and tore out a piece from his haunch. Whereat  the hart sprang suddenly with a great leap, and overthrew a knight sitting  at the table, who rose forthwith, and, taking up the hound, mounted, and  rode fast away.    But no sooner had he left, than there came in a lady, mounted on a white  palfrey, who cried out to the king, \"Lord, suffer me not to have this  injury!--the hound is mine which that knight taketh.\" And as she spake, a  knight rode in all armed, on a great horse, and suddenly took up the lady  and rode away with her by force, although she greatly cried and moaned.    Then the king desired Sir Gawain, Sir Tor, and King Pellinore to mount and  follow this adventure to the uttermost; and told Sir Gawain to bring back  the hart, Sir Tor the "]]]
