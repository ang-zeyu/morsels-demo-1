In a moment Henry was worming his way, lying flat on  the ground, through grass and prickly-pears, toward his unsuspecting  victims. He had with him both my rifle and his own. He was soon out of  sight, and still the buffalo kept issuing into the valley. For a long  time all was silent. I sat holding his horse, and wondering what he was  about, when suddenly, in rapid succession, came the sharp reports of the  two rifles, and the whole line of buffalo, quickening their pace into  a clumsy trot, gradually disappeared over the ridge of the hill. Henry  rose to his feet, and stood looking after them.    \"You have missed them,\" said I.    \"Yes,\" said Henry; \"let us go.\" He descended into the ravine, loaded the  rifles, and mounted his horse.    We rode up the hill after the buffalo. The herd was out of sight when  we reached the top, but lying on the grass not far off, was one quite  lifeless, and another violently struggling in the death agony.    \"You see I miss him!\" remarked Henry. He had fired from a distance of  more than a hundred and fifty yards, and both balls had passed through  the lungs--the true mark in shooting buffalo.    The darkness increased, and a driving storm came on. Tying our horses  to the horns of the victims, Henry began the bloody work of dissection,  slashing away with the science of a connoisseur, while I vainly  endeavored to imitate him. Old Hendrick recoiled with horror and  indignation when I endeavored to tie the meat to the strings of raw  hide, always carried for this purpose, dangling at the back of the  saddle. After some difficulty we overcame his scruples; and heavily  burdened with the more eligible portions of the buffalo, we set out on  our return. Scarcely had we emerged from the labyrinth of gorges and  ravines, and issued upon the open prairie, when the pricking sleet came  driving, gust upon gust, directly in our faces. It was strangely  dark, though wanting still an hour of sunset. The freezing storm soon  penetrated to the skin, but the uneasy trot of our heavy-gaited horses  kept us warm enough, as we forced them unwillingly in the teeth of the  sleet and rain, by the powerful suasion of our Indian whips. The prairie  in this place was hard and level. A flourishing colony of prairie dogs  had burrowed into it in every direction, and the little mounds of  fresh earth around their holes were about as numerous as the hills in  a cornfield; but not a yelp was to be heard; not the nose of a single  citizen was visible; all had retired to the depths of their burrows,  and we envied them their dry and comfortable habitations. An hour's  hard riding showed us our tent dimly looming through the storm, one  side puffed out by the force of the wind, and the other collapsed in  proportion, while the disconsolate horses stood shivering close around,  and the wind kept up a dismal whistling in the boughs of three old  half-dead trees above. Shaw, like a patriarch, sat on his saddle in the  entrance, with a pipe in his mouth, and his arms folded, contemplating,  with cool satisfaction, the piles of meat that we flung on the ground  before him. A dark and dreary night succeeded; but the sun rose with  heat so sultry and languid that the captain excused himself on that  account from waylaying an old buffalo bull, who with stupid gravity was  walking over the prairie to drink at the river. So much for the climate  of the Platte!    But it was not the weather alone that had produced this sudden abatement  of the sportsmanlike zeal which the captain had always professed. He had  been out on the afternoon before, together with several members of his  party; but their hunting was attended with no other result than the  loss of one of their best horses, severely injured by Sorel, in vainly  chasing a wounded bull. The captain, whose ideas of hard riding were all  derived from transatlantic sources, expressed the utmost amazement at  the feats of Sorel, who went leaping ravines, and dashing at full speed  up and down the sides of precipitous hills, lashing his horse with  the recklessness of a Rocky Mountain rider. Unfortunately for the poor  animal he was the property of R., against whom Sorel entertained an  unbounded aversion. The captain himself, it seemed, had also attempted  to \"run\" a buffalo, but though a good and practiced horseman, he had  soon given over the attempt, being astonished and utterly disgusted at  the nature of the ground he was required to ride over.    Nothing unusual occurred on that day; but on the following morning Henry  Chatillon, looking over the oceanlike expanse, saw near the foot of the  distant hills something that looked like a band of buffalo. He was not  sure, he said, but at all events, if they were buffalo, there was a fine  chance for a race. Shaw and I at once determined to try the speed of our  horses.    \"Come, captain; we'll see which can ride hardest, a Yankee or an  Irishman.\"    But the captain maintained a grave and austere countenance. He mounted  his led horse, however, though very slowly; and we set out at a trot.  The game appeared about three miles distant. As we proceeded the captain  made various remarks of doubt and indecision; and at length declared he  would have nothing to do with such a breakneck business; protesting that  he had ridden plenty of steeple-chases in his day, but he never knew  what riding was till he found himself behind a band of buffalo day  before yesterday. \"I am convinced,\" said the captain, \"that, 'running'  is out of the question.* Take my advice now and don't attempt it. It's  dangerous, and of no use at all.\"         *The method of hunting called \"running\" consists in       attacking the buffalo on horseback and shooting him with       bullets or arrows when at full-speed.  In \"approaching,\" the       hunter conceals himself and crawls on the ground toward the       game, or lies in wait to kill them.    \"Then why did you come out with us? What do you mean to do?\"    \"I shall 'approach,'\" replied the captain.    \"You don't mean to 'approach' with your pistols, do you? We have all of  us left our rifles in the wagons.\"    The captain seemed staggered at the suggestion. In his characteristic  indecision, at setting out, pistols, rifles, \"running\" and \"approaching\"  were mingled in an inextricable medley in his brain. He trotted on in  silence between us for a while; but at length he dropped behind and  slowly walked his horse back to rejoin the party. Shaw and I kept on;  when lo! as we advanced, the band of buffalo were transformed into  certain clumps of tall bushes, dotting the prairie for a considerable  distance. At this ludicrous termination of our chase, we followed the  example of our late ally, and turned back toward the party. We  were skirting the brink of a deep ravine, when we saw Henry and the  broad-chested pony coming toward us at a gallop.    \"Here's old Papin and Frederic, down from Fort Laramie!\" shouted Henry,  long before he came up. We had for some days expected this encounter.  Papin was the bourgeois of Fort Laramie. He had come down the river  with the buffalo robes and the beaver, the produce of the last winter's  trading. I had among our baggage a letter which I wished to commit to  their hands; so requesting Henry to detain the boats if he could until  my return, I set out after the wagons. They were about four miles in  advance. In half an hour I overtook them, got the letter, trotted back  upon the trail, and looking carefully, as I rode, saw a patch of broken,  storm-blasted trees, and moving near them some little black specks like  men and horses. Arriving at the place, I found a strange assembly. The  boats, eleven in number, deep-laden with the skins, hugged close to  the shore, to escape being borne down by the swift current. The rowers,  swarthy ignoble Mexicans, turned their brutish faces upward to look, as  I reached the bank. Papin sat in the middle of one of the boats upon the  canvas covering that protected the robes. He was a stout, robust fellow,  with a little gray eye, that had a peculiarly sly twinkle. \"Frederic\"  also stretched his tall rawboned proportions close by the bourgeois,  and \"mountain-men\" completed the group; some lounging in the boats, some  strolling on shore; some attired in gayly painted buffalo robes, like  Indian dandies; some with hair saturated with red paint, and beplastered  with glue to their temples; and one bedaubed with vermilion upon his  forehead and each cheek. They were a mongrel race; yet the French blood  seemed to predominate; in a few, indeed, might be seen the black snaky  eye of the Indian half-breed, and one and all, they seemed to aim at  assimilating themselves to their savage associates.    I shook hands with the bourgeois, and delivered the letter; then the  boats swung round into the stream and floated away. They had reason  for haste, for already the voyage from Fort Laramie had occupied a full  month, and the river was growing daily more shallow. Fifty times a  day the boats had been aground, indeed; those who navigate the Platte  invariably spend half their time upon sand-bars. Two of these boats,  the property of private traders, afterward separating from the rest,  got hopelessly involved in the shallows, not very far from the Pawnee  villages, and were soon surrounded by a swarm of the inhabitants. They  carried off everything that they considered valuable, including most of  the robes; and amused themselves by tying up the men left on guard and  soundly whipping them with sticks.    We encamped that night upon the bank of the river. Among the emigrants  there was an overgrown boy, some eighteen years old, with a head as  round "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10163"],[0,"Mohammedanism (#14)"],[1,"out of three _qadhis_ two are destined to  Hell. Anecdotes of famous scholars who could not be prevailed upon  by imprisonment or castigation to accept the office of _qadhis_ are  innumerable. Those who succumbed to the temptation forfeited the respect of  the circle to which they had belonged.    I once witnessed a case of this kind, and the former friends of the _qadhi_  did not spare him their bitter reproaches. He remarked that the judge,  whose duty it was to maintain the divine law, verily held a noble office.  They refuted this by saying that this defence was admissible only for  earlier and better times, but not for \"the _qadhis_ of our time.\" To which  he cuttingly replied \"And ye, are ye canonists of the better, the ancient  time?\" In truth, the students of sacred science are just as much \"of our  time\" as the _qadhis_. Even in the eleventh century the great theologian  Ghazali counted them all equal.[1] Not a few of them give their  authoritative advice according to the wishes of the highest bidder or  of him who has the greatest influence, hustle for income from pious  institutions, and vie with each other in a revel of casuistic subtleties.  But among those scholars there are and always have been some who, in  poverty and simplicity, devote their life to the study of Allah's law with  the sole object of pleasing him; among the _qadhis_ such are not easily to  be found. Amongst the other state officials the title of _qadhi_ may count  as a spiritual one, and the public may to a certain extent share this  reverence; but in the eyes of the pious and of the canonists such glory is  only reflected from the clerical robe, in which the worldling disguises  himself.    [Footnote 1: Ghazali, _Ihya_, book i., ch. 6, quotes the words of a pious  scholar of the olden time: \"The 'ulama' will (on the Day of judgment)  be gathered amongst the prophets, but the _qadhis_ amongst the temporal  rulers.\" Ghazali adds \"alike with these _qadhis_ are all those canonists  who make use of their learning for worldly purposes.\"]    To the _mufti_ criticism is somewhat more favourable than to the _qadhi_. A  mufti is not necessarily an official; every canonist who, at the request of  a layman, expounds to him the meaning of the law on any particular point  and gives a _fatwa_, acts as a _mufti_. Be the question in reference to the  behaviour of the individual towards God or towards man, with regard to his  position in a matter of litigation, in criticism of a state regulation or  of a sentence of a judge, or out of pure love of knowledge, the scholar is  morally obliged to the best of his knowledge to enlighten the enquirer. He  ought to do this for the love of God; but he must live, and the enquirer is  expected to give him a suitable present for his trouble. This again gives  rise to the danger that he who offers most is attended to first; and that  for the liberal rich man a dish is prepared from the casuistic store, as  far as possible according to his taste. The temptation is by no means so  great as that to which the _qadhi_ is exposed; especially since the office  of judge has become an article of commerce, so that the very first step  towards the possession of it is in the direction of Hell. Moreover in  \"these degenerate times\"--which have existed for about ten centuries--the  acceptance of an appointment to the function of _qadhi_ is not regarded as  a duty, while a competent scholar may only refuse to give a _fatwa_ under  exceptional circumstances. Still, an unusually strong character is needed  by the _mufti_, if he is not to fall into the snares of the world.    Besides _qadhis_ who settle legal disputes of a certain kind according to  the revealed law, the state requires its own advisers who can explain  that law, i.e., official _muftis_. Firstly, the government itself may be  involved in a litigation; moreover in some government regulations it may be  necessary to avoid giving offence to canonists and their strict disciples.  In such cases it is better to be armed beforehand with an expert opinion  than to be exposed to dangerous criticism which might find an echo in a  wide circle. The official _mufti_ must therefore be somewhat pliable, to  say the least. Moreover, any private person has the right to put questions  to the state _mufti_; and the _qadhi_ court is bound to take his answers  into account in its decisions. In this way the _muftis_ have absorbed a  part of the duties of the _qadhis_, and so their office is dragged along in  the degradation that the unofficial canonists denounce unweariedly in their  writings and in their teaching.    The way in which the most important _mufti_ places are filled and above  all the position which the head-_mufti_ of the Turkish Empire, the  Sheikh-ul-Islam, holds at any particular period, may well serve as a  touchstone of the influence of the canonists on public life. If this is  great, then even the most powerful sultan has only the possibility of  choice between a few great scholars, put forward or at all events not  disapproved of by their own guild, strengthened by public opinion. If, on  the other hand, there is no keen interest felt in the Shari'ah (Divine  Law), then the temporal rulers can do pretty much what they like with these  representatives of the canon law. Under the tyrannical sway of Sultan  Abd-ul-Hamid, the Sheikh-ul-Islam was little more than a tool for him and  his palace clique, and for their own reasons, the members of the Committee  of Union and Progress, who rule at Constantinople since 1908, made no  change in this: each new ministry had its own Sheikh-ul-Islam, who had to  be, above everything, a faithful upholder of the constitutional theory  held by the Committee. The time is past when the Sultan and the Porte,  in framing even the most pressing reform, must first anxiously assure  themselves of the position that the _hojas, tolbas, softas_, the  theologians in a word, would take towards it, and of the influence that  the Sheikh-ul-Islam could use in opposition to their plans. The political  authority makes its deference to the canonists dependent upon their strict  obedience.    This important change is a natural consequence of the modernization of  Mohammedan political life, a movement through which the expounders of a  law which has endeavoured to remain stationary since the year 1000 must  necessarily get into straits. This explains also why the religious life of  Mohammedans is in some respects freer in countries under non-Mohammedan  authority, than under a Mohammedan government. Under English, Dutch, or  French rule the 'ulamas are less interfered with in their teaching, the  _muftis_ in their recommendations, and the _qadhis_ in their judgments of  questions of marriage and inheritance than in Turkey, where the life of  Islam, as state religion, lies under official control. In indirectly  governed \"native states\" the relation of Mohammedan \"Church and State\" may  much more resemble that in Turkey, and this is sometimes to the advantage  of the sovereign ruler. Under the direct government of a modern state, the  Mohammedan group is treated as a religious community, whose particular life  has just the same claim to independence as that of other denominations. The  only justifiable limitation is that the program of the forcible reduction  of the world to Mohammedan authority be kept within the scholastic walls as  a point of eschatology, and not considered as a body of prescriptions, the  execution of which must be prepared.    The extensive political program of Islam, developed during the first  centuries of astounding expansion, has yet not prevented millions of  Mohammedans from resigning themselves to reversed conditions in which at  the present time many more Mohammedans live under foreign authority than  under their own. The acceptance of this change was facilitated by the  historical pessimism of Islam, which makes the mind prepared for every  sort of decay, and by the true Moslim habit of resignation to painful  experiences, not through fatalism, but through reverence for Allah's  inscrutable will. At the same time, it would be a gross mistake to imagine  that the idea of universal conquest may be considered as obliterated. This  is the case with the intellectuals and with many practical commercial or  industrial men; but the canonists and the vulgar still live in the illusion  of the days of Islam's greatness.    The legists continue to ground their appreciation of every actual political  condition on the law of the holy war, which war ought never to be allowed  to cease entirely until all mankind is reduced to the authority of  Islam--the heathen by conversion, the adherents of acknowledged Scripture  by submission. Even if they admit the improbability of this at present,  they are comforted and encouraged by the recollection of the lengthy period  of humiliation that the Prophet himself had to suffer before Allah bestowed  victory upon his arms; and they fervently join with the Friday preacher,  when he pronounces the prayer, taken from the Qoran: \"And lay not on us, O  our Lord, that for which we have not strength, but blot out our sins and  forgive us and have pity upon us. Thou art our Master; grant us then to  conquer the unbelievers!\" And the common people are willingly taught by the  canonists and feed their hope of better days upon the innumerable legends  of the olden time and the equally innumerable apocalyptic prophecies about  the future. The political blows that fall upon Islam make less impression  upon their simple minds than the senseless stories about the power of  the Sultan of Stambul, that would instantly be revealed if he were not  surrounded by treacherous servants, and the fantastic tidings of the  miracles that Allah works in the Holy Cities of Arabia which are  inaccessible to the unfaithful.    The conception of the Khalifate still exercises a fascinating influence,  regarded in the light"]]]
