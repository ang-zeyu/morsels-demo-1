Of the former cycle probably one of the oldest versions is that he was a  son or descendant of Tezcatlipoca himself, under his name Camaxtli. This  was the account given to the chancellor Ramirez,[1] and it is said by  Torquemada to have been the canonical doctrine taught in the holy city of  Cholollan, the centre of the worship of Quetzalcoatl.[2] It is a  transparent metaphor, and could be paralleled by a hundred similar  expressions in the myths of other nations. The Night brings forth the Day,  the darkness leads on to the light, and though thus standing in the  relation of father and son, the struggle between them is forever  continued.    [Footnote 1: Ramirez de Fuen-leal, _Hist. de los Mexicanos_, cap. viii.]    [Footnote 2: _Monarquia Indiana_, Lib. vi, cap. xxiv. _Camaxtli_ is also  found in the form _Yoamaxtli_; this shows that it is a compound of  _maxtli_, covering, clothing, and _ca_, the substantive verb, or in the  latter instance, _yoalli_, night; hence it is, \"the Mantle,\" or, \"the garb  of night\" (\"la faja nocturna,\" _Anales del Museo Nacional_, Tom. ii, p.  363).]    Another myth represents him as the immediate son of the All-Father Tonaca  tecutli, under his title Citlallatonac, the Morning, by an earth-born  maiden in Tollan. In that city dwelt three sisters, one of whom, an  unspotted virgin, was named Chimalman. One day, as they were together, the  god appeared to them. Chimalman's two sisters were struck to death by  fright at his awful presence, but upon her he breathed the breath of life,  and straightway she conceived. The son she bore cost her life, but it was  the divine Quetzalcoatl, surnamed _Topiltcin_, Our Son, and, from the year  of his birth, _Ce Acatl_, One Reed. As soon as he was born he was  possessed of speech and reason and wisdom. As for his mother, having  perished on earth, she was transferred to the heavens, where she was given  the honored name Chalchihuitzli, the Precious Stone of Sacrifice.[1]    [Footnote 1: _Codex Vaticanus_, Tab. x; _Codex Telleriano-Remensis_, Pt.  ii, Lam. ii. The name is from _chalchihuitl_, jade, and _vitztli_, the  thorn used to pierce the tongue, ears and penis, in sacrifice.  _Chimalman_, more correctly, _Chimalmatl_, is from _chimalli_, shield, and  probably, _matlalin_, green.]    This, also, is evidently an ancient and simple figure of speech to express  that the breath of Morning announces the dawn which brings forth the sun  and disappears in the act.    The virgin mother Chimalman, in another legend, is said to have been  brought with child by swallowing a jade or precious green stone  (_chalchihuitl_);[1] while another averred that she was not a virgin, but  the wife of Camaxtli (Tezcatlipoca);[2] or again, that she was the second  wife of that venerable old man who was the father of the seven sons from  whom all tribes speaking the Nahuatl language, and several who did not  speak it (Otomies, Tarascos), were descended.[3] This latter will repay  analysis.    [Footnote 1: Mendieta, _Historia Eclesiastica Indiana_, Lib. ii, cap. vi.]    [Footnote 2: Ibid.]    [Footnote 3: Motolinia, _Historia de los Indios de Nueva Espana, Epistola  Proemial_, p. 10. The first wife was Ilancueitl, from _ilantli_, old  woman, and _cueitl_, skirt. Gomara, _Conquista de Mejico_, p. 432.]    All through Mexico and Central America this legend of the Seven Sons,  Seven Tribes, the Seven Caves whence they issued, or the Seven Cities  where they dwelt, constantly crops out. To that land the Aztecs referred  as their former dwelling place. It was located at some indefinite distance  to the north or northwest--in the same direction as Tollan. The name of  that land was significant. It was called the White or Bright Land,  _Aztlan_.[1] In its midst was situated the mountain or hill Colhuacan the  Divine, _Teoculhuacan_.[2] In the base of this hill were the Seven  Caverns, _Chicomoztoc_, whence the seven tribes with their respective gods  had issued, those gods including Quetzalcoatl, Huitzilopochtli and the  Tezcatlipocas. There continued to live their mother, awaiting their  return.    [Footnote 1: The derivation of Aztlan from _aztatl_, a heron, has been  rejected by Buschmann and the best Aztec scholars. It is from the same  root as _izlac_, white, with the local ending _tlan_, and means the White  or Bright Land. See the subject discussed in Buschmann, _Ueber die  Atzekischen Ortsnamen_. p. 612, and recently by Senor Orozco y Berra, in  _Anales del Museo Nacional_, Tom. ii, p. 56.]    [Footnote 2: Colhuacan, is a locative form. It is usually derived from  _coloa_, to curve, to round. Father Duran says it is another name for  Aztlan: \"Estas cuevas son en Teoculacan, _que por otro nombre_ se llama  Aztlan.\" _Historia de los Indios de Nueva Espana_, Lib. i, cap. i.]    _Teo_ is from _teotl_, god, deity. The description in the text of the  relations of land and water in this mythical land, is also from Duran's  work.    The lord of this land and the father of the seven sons is variously and  indistinctly named. One legend calls him the White Serpent of the Clouds,  or the White Cloud Twin, _Iztac Mixcoatl_.[1] Whoever he was we can hardly  mistake the mountain in which or upon which he dwelt. _Colhuacan_ means  the bent or curved mountain. It is none other than the Hill of Heaven,  curving down on all sides to the horizon; upon it in all times have dwelt  the gods, and from it they have come to aid the men they favor. Absolutely  the same name was applied by the Choctaws to the mythical hill from which  they say their ancestors first emerged into the light of day. They call it  _Nane Waiyah_, the Bent or Curved Hill[2]. Such identity of metaphorical  expression leaves little room for discussion.    [Footnote 1: Mendieta, _Historia Eclesiastica Indiana_, Lib. ii, cap.  xxxiii.]    [Footnote 2: See my work, _The Myths of the New World_, p. 242.]    If it did, the other myths which surround the mystic mountain would seem  to clear up doubt. Colhuacan, we are informed, continued to be the  residence of the great Mother of the Gods. On it she dwelt, awaiting their  return from earth. No one can entirely climb the mountain, for from its  middle distance to the summit it is of fine and slippery sand; but it has  this magical virtue, that whoever ascends it, however old he is, grows  young again, in proportion as he mounts, and is thus restored to pristine  vigor. The happy dwellers around it have, however, no need of its youth  restoring power; for in that land no one grows old, nor knows the outrage  of years.[1]    [Footnote 1: \"En esta tierra nunca envejecen los hombres. * * * Este cerro  tiene esta virtud, que el que ya viejo se quiere remozar, sube hasta donde  le parece, y vuelve de la edad que quiere.\" Duran, in Kingsborough, Vol.  viii, p. 201.]    When Quetzalcoatl, therefore, was alleged to be the son of the Lord of the  Seven Caves, it was nothing more than a variation of the legend that gave  him out as the son of the Lord of the High Heavens. They both mean the  same thing. Chimalman, who appears in both myths as his mother, binds the  two together, and stamps them as identical, while Mixcoatl is only another  name for Tezcatlipoca.    Such an interpretation, if correct, would lead to the dismissal from  history of the whole story of the Seven Cities or Caves, and the pretended  migration from them. In fact, the repeated endeavors of the chroniclers to  assign a location to these fabulous residences, have led to no result  other than most admired disorder and confusion. It is as vain to seek  their whereabouts, as it is that of the garden of Eden or the Isle of  Avalon. They have not, and never had a place on this sublunary sphere, but  belong in that ethereal world which the fancy creates and the imagination  paints.    A more prosaic account than any of the above, is given by the historian,  Alva Ixtlilxochitl, so prosaic that it is possible that it has some grains  of actual fact in it.[1] He tells us that a King of Tollan, Tecpancaltzin,  fell in love with the daughter of one of his subjects, a maiden by name  Xochitl, the Rose. Her father was the first to collect honey from the  maguey plant, and on pretence of buying this delicacy the king often sent  for Xochitl. He accomplished her seduction, and hid her in a rose garden  on a mountain, where she gave birth to an infant son, to the great anger  of the father. Casting the horoscope of the infant, the court astrologer  found all the signs that he should be the last King of Tollan, and should  witness the destruction of the Toltec monarchy. He was named _Meconetzin_,  the Son of the Maguey, and in due time became king, and the prediction was  accomplished.[2]    [Footnote 1: Ixtlilxochitl, _Relaciones Historicas_, p. 330, in  Kingsborough, Vol. ix.]    [Footnote 2: In the work of Ramirez de Fuen-leal (cap. viii), Tezcatlipoca  is said to have been the discoverer of pulque, the intoxicating wine of  the Maguey. In Meztitlan he was associated with the gods of this beverage  and of drunkenness. Hence it is probable that the name _Meconetzin_  applied to Quetzalcoatl in this myth meant to convey that he was the son  of Tezcatlipoca.]    In several points, however, this seemingly historic narrative has a  suspicious resemblance to a genuine myth preserved to us in a certain  Aztec manuscript known as the _Codex Telleriano-Remensis_. This document  tells how Quetzalcoatl, Tezcatlipoca and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11039"],[0,"A Woman's Journey Round the World (#14)"],[1,"ten years.  The leaf is long and  slightly serrated, the blossom white, while the fruit hangs down in  the same manner as a bunch of grapes, and resembles a longish  cherry, which is first green, then red, brown, and nearly black.  During the time it is red, the outer shell is soft, but ultimately  becomes perfectly hard, and resembles a wooden capsule.  Blossoms  and fruit in full maturity are found upon the trees at the same  time, and hence the harvest lasts nearly the whole year.  The latter  is conducted in two ways.  The berries are either gathered by hand,  or large straw mats are spread underneath, and the trees well  shaken.  The first method is the more troublesome, but, without  comparison, the better one.    Another novelty, which I saw here for the first time, were the  frequent burning forests, which had been set on fire to clear the  ground for cultivation.  In most cases I merely saw immense clouds  of smoke curling upwards in the distance, and desired nothing more  earnestly than to enjoy a nearer view of such a conflagration.  My  wish was destined to be fulfilled today, as my road lay between a  burning forest and a burning rost. {40}  The intervening space was  not, at the most, more than fifty paces broad, and was completely  enveloped in smoke.  I could hear the cracking of the fire, and  through the dense vapour perceive thick, forked columns of flame  shoot upwards towards the sky, while now and then loud reports, like  those of a cannon, announced the fall of the large trees.  On seeing  my guide enter this fiery gulf, I was, I must confess, rather  frightened; but I felt assured, on reflecting, that he would  certainly not foolishly risk his own life, and that he must know  from experience that such places were passable.    At the entrance sat two negroes, to point out the direction that  wayfarers had to follow, and to recommend them to make as much haste  as possible.  My guide translated for me what they said, and spurred  on his mule; I followed his example, and we both galloped at full  speed into the smoking pass.  The burning ashes now flew around us  in all directions, while the suffocating smoke was even more  oppressive than the heat; our beasts, too, seemed to have great  difficulty in drawing breath, and it was as much as we could do to  keep them in a gallop.  Fortunately we had not above 500 or 600  paces to ride, and consequently succeeded in making our way safely  through.    In the Brazils a conflagration of this kind never extends very far,  as the vegetation is too green and offers too much opposition.  The  wood has to be ignited in several places, and even then the fire  frequently goes out, and when most of the wood is burnt, many  patches are found unconsumed.  Soon after passing this dangerous  spot, we came to a magnificent rock, the sides of which must have  risen almost perpendicularly to a height of 600 or 800 feet.  A  number of detached fragments lay scattered about the road, forming  picturesque groups.    To my great astonishment, I learned from my guide that our lodging  for the night was near at hand; we had scarcely ridden twenty miles,  but he affirmed that the next venda where we could stop, was too far  distant.  I afterwards discovered that his sole object was to spin  out the journey, which was a very profitable one for him, since,  besides good living for himself, and fodder for his two mules, he  received four milreis (8s. 8d.) a-day.  We put up, therefore, at a  solitary venda, erected in the middle of the forest, and kept by  Herr Molasz.    During the day we had suffered greatly from the heat; the  thermometer standing, in the sun, at 119 degrees 75' Fah.    The circumstance which must strike a traveller most forcibly in the  habits of the colonists and inhabitants of the Brazils, is the  contrast between fear and courage.   On the one hand, every one you  meet upon the road is armed with pistols and long knives, as if the  whole country was overrun with robbers and murderers; while, on the  other, the proprietors live quite alone on their plantations, and  without the least apprehension, in the midst of their numerous  slaves.  The traveller, too, fearlessly passes the night in some  venda, situated in impenetrable woods, with neither shutters to the  windows nor good locks to the doors, besides which the owner's room  is a considerable distance from the chambers of the guests, and it  would be utterly impossible to obtain any assistance from the  servants, who are all slaves, as they live either in some corner of  the stable, or in the loft.  At first I felt very frightened at thus  passing the night alone, surrounded by the wild gloom of the forest,  and in a room that was only very insecurely fastened; but, as I was  everywhere assured that such a thing as a forcible entry into a  house had never been heard of, I soon dismissed my superfluous  anxiety, and enjoyed the most tranquil repose.    I know very few countries in Europe where I should like to traverse  vast forests, and pass the night in such awfully lonely houses,  accompanied by only a hired guide.    On the 7th of October, also, we made only a short day's journey of  twenty miles, to the small town of Canto Gallo.  The scenery was of  the usual description, consisting of narrow, circumscribed valleys  and mountains covered with endless forests.  If little fazendas, and  the remains of woods which had been set on fire, had not, every now  and then, reminded us of the hand of man, I should have thought that  I was wandering through some yet undiscovered part of Brazil.    The monotony of our journey was rather romantically interrupted by  our straying for a short distance from the right road.  In order to  reach it again, we were obliged to penetrate, by untrodden paths,  through the woods; a task presenting difficulties of which a  European can scarcely form an idea.  We dismounted from our mules,  and my guide threw back, on either side, the low-hanging branches,  and cut through the thick web of creepers; while, one moment, we  were obliged to climb over broken trunks, or squeeze ourselves  between others, at the next we sank knee-deep among endless  parasitical plants.  I began almost to despair of ever effecting a  passage, and, even up to the present day, am at a loss to understand  how we succeeded in escaping from this inextricable mass.    The little town of Canto Gallo is situated in a narrow valley, and  contains about eighty houses.  The venda stands apart, the town not  being visible from it.  The temperature here is warm as in Rio  Janeiro.    On my return to the venda, after a short walk to the town, I applied  to my landlady, in order to obtain a near and really correct idea of  a Brazilian household.  The good woman, however, gave herself very  little trouble, either in looking after the house or the kitchen; as  is the case in Italy, this was her husband's business.  A negress  and two young negroes cooked, the arrangements of the kitchen being  of the most primitive simplicity.  The salt was pressed fine with a  bottle; the potatoes, when boiled, underwent the same process--the  latter were also subsequently squeezed in the frying-pan with a  plate, to give them the form of a pancake; a pointed piece of wood  served for a fork, etc.  There was a large fire burning for every  dish.    Every one whose complexion was white, sat down with us at table.  All the dishes, consisting of cold roast beef, black beans with  boiled carna secca, {42} potatoes, rice, manioc flour, and boiled  manioc roots, were placed upon the table at the same time, and every  one helped himself as he pleased.  At the conclusion of our meal, we  had strong coffee without milk.  The slaves had beans, carna secca,  and manioc flour.    8th October.  Our goal today was the Fazenda Boa Esperanza, twenty-  four miles off.  Four miles beyond Canto Gallo, we crossed a small  waterfall, and then entered one of the most magnificent virgin  forests I had yet beheld.  A small path, on the bank of a little  brook conducted us through it.  Palms, with their majestic tops,  raised themselves proudly above the other trees, which, lovingly  interlaced together, formed the most beautiful bowers; orchids grew  in wanton luxuriance upon the branches and twigs; creepers and ferns  climbed up the trees, mingling with the boughs, and forming thick  walls of blossoms and flowers, which displayed the most brilliant  colours, and exhaled the sweetest perfume; delicate humming-birds  twittered around our heads; the pepper-pecker, with his brilliant  plumage, soared shyly upwards; parrots and parroquets were swinging  themselves in the branches, and numberless beautifully marked birds,  which I only knew from having seen specimens in the Museum,  inhabited this fairy grove.  It seemed as if I was riding in some  fairy park, and I expected, every moment, to see sylphs and nymphs  appear before me.    I was so happy, that I felt richly recompensed for all the fatigue  of my journey.  One thought only obscured this beautiful picture;  and that was, that weak man should dare to enter the lists with the  giant nature of the place, and make it bend before his will.  How  soon, perhaps, may this profound and holy tranquillity be disturbed  by the blows of some daring settler's axe, to make room for the  wants of men!    I saw no dangerous animals save a few dark green snakes, from five  to seven feet long; a dead ounce, that had been stripped of its  skin; and a lizard, three feet in length, which ran timidly across  our path.  I met with no apes; they appear to conceal themselves  deeper in the woods, where no human footstep is likely to disturb  them in their sports and gambols.    During the whole distance from Canto Gallo to the small village of  St. Ritta (sixteen miles), if it had not again been for a few coffee  plantations, I should have thought the place completely forgotten by  man.
