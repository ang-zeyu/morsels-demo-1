[Sidenote: A.D. 69 (a.u. 822)] [Sidenote:--4--] I shall relate also the  circumstances of his death. The soldiers in Germany under control of Rufus  became more and more excited because they could not obtain any favors from  Galba; and, having failed to secure the object of their desire through the  medium of Rufus, they sought to obtain it through somebody else. This they  did. With Aulus Vitellius, governor of Lower Germany, at their head they  revolted. All that they had in mind regarding him was the nobility of his  birth, and they paid no attention to the fact that he had been a favorite  of Tiberius and was a slave to the licentious habits of his former master;  or perhaps they thought that on this very account he would suit their  purpose all the better. Indeed, Vitellius himself deemed himself of so  little account that he made fun of the astrologers and used their  prediction as evidence against them, saying: \"Certainly they know nothing  who declare that I shall become emperor.\" Nero when he heard it also  laughed, and felt such contempt for the fellow that he did not try to  injure him.    [Sidenote:--5--] Galba on being informed of his defection adopted Lucius  Piso, a youth of good family, affable and prudent, and appointed him  Caesar. At the same time Marcus Salvius Otho, angry because _he_ had  not been adopted by Galba, brought about once more a beginning of  countless evils for the Romans. He was always held in honor by Galba, so  much so that on the day of the latter's death he was the only one of the  senators to attend him at the sacrifice. And to him most of all was the  catastrophe due. For when the diviner declared that Galba would be the  victim of conspiracy and therefore urged him by no means to go abroad  anywhere, Otho heard it, and hastening down immediately as if on some  other errand was admitted within the wall by some few soldiers who were in  the conspiracy with him. The next step was the winning over or rather the  buying up of the rest, who were displeased at Galba, by means of many  promises. From them he received the imperial office at once and later his  claim was acknowledged by the others. [Sidenote:--6--] Galba on learning  what was taking place thought he could bring the men into a better frame  of mind and sent some emissaries to the camp for this purpose. Meanwhile a  soldier holding aloft a bare blade covered with blood had approached him  and said: \"Be of good cheer, emperor: I have killed Otho, and no further  danger awaits you.\" Galba, believing this, said to him: \"And who ordered  you to do that?\" He himself started for the Capitol to offer sacrifice. As  he reached the middle of the Roman Forum, horsemen and footsoldiers met  him and then and there cut down in the presence of many senators and  crowds of plebeians the old man, their consul, high priest, Caesar,  emperor. After abusing his body in many ways they cut off his head and  stuck it on a pole.--So he was struck by a javelin hurled into the very  chair in which he was being carried, was wounded at the very moment he was  bending forward from it, and only said: \"Why, what harm have I done?\"  Sempronius Densus, a centurion, defended him as long as he was able, and  finally, when he could accomplish nothing, let himself be slain with his  sovereign. This is why I have included his name, for he richly deserves to  be mentioned. Piso also was killed and numerous others, but not in aiding  the emperor.    When the soldiers had done this, they cut off their heads, which they then  carried to Otho (who was in the camp) and also into the senate-house; and  the senators, though terror-stricken, affected to be glad.    Galba had lived seventy-two years and twenty-three days,  out of which he ruled nine months and thirteen days. Piso perished after  him, making this atonement for having been appointed Caesar.    [Sidenote:--7--] This was the end that befell Galba. But retribution was  destined full soon enough to seek out Otho in his turn, as he at once  learned. As he was offering his first sacrifice, the omens were seen to be  unfavorable, so that he repented of what had been done and said: \"What  need was there of my playing on the long flutes?\" This is a colloquial and  proverbial expression that has reference to those who do anything out of  their usual line. Later he was so disturbed in his sleep at night that he  fell out of the bed and alarmed the guards who slept at the door. They  rushed in and found him lying on the ground. Yet once he had entered upon  the imperial office he could not put it off; and he remained in it and  paid the penalty, in spite of many temperate acts intended to conciliate  people. It was not particularly his nature to behave that way, but since  on account of Vitellius his prospects were in a somewhat precarious state,  he did not wish to alienate the bulk of the population.    Just at this time, to be sure, he annulled the sentences against some  senators and granted various slight favors to others. By way of gaining  the public approval he constantly frequented the theatres: he bestowed  citizenship upon foreigners and made many other attractive announcements.  Yet he did not succeed in winning the attachment of any one save a certain  few, like himself. [For his restoration of the images of those under  accusation and] his life and habits, his keeping Sporus as a companion and  employing the rest of the Neronians, alarmed everybody.    [Sidenote:--8--] Moreover, the senate voted him all the privileges  pertaining to his office. He said that he had been forced to do as he did,  had been brought within the walls against his will, and had actually  risked his life after that by opposing the scheme. He regularly talked in  a considerate manner and assumed a kindly expression and attitude; he  threw kisses on his fingers to everybody and made many promises. But the  fact did not escape men that his rule was sure to be more licentious and  oppressive than Nero's. (Indeed, he had immediately applied to himself the  latter's name).    [Sidenote:--9--] They hated him most of all, however, because he had  demonstrated the fact that the imperial office was for sale and had put  the city in the power of the boldest spirits; likewise because he held the  senate and the people in slight esteem and had impressed upon the soldiers  also this idea,--that they could kill or again create a Caesar. Moreover,  he had brought the soldiers into such a daring and lawless condition by  his gifts and his immoderate attentions that one day they forced an  entrance just as they were into the palace while a number of the senators  were dining there with Otho. before departing they rushed into the  banquet-room itself, killing those that strove to bar their progress. And  they would have slaughtered everybody found there had not the guests  jumped up and hid themselves prior to their irruption. For this behavior  the men received money, it being assumed that their act was due to their  liking for Otho.    About this time also a man was caught pretending to be Nero. His name was  unknown to Dio. And at last he paid the penalty.    [Sidenote:--10--] Otho, not succeeding by frequent invitations in  persuading Vitellius to come and share the imperial office, eventually  plunged into open war against him. And he sent soldiers whom he put in  charge of several different leaders; this fact was largely responsible for  his reverses.    Valens was so eager for money and gathered it so assiduously from every  source that he put to death the decurion, who had concealed him and had  saved his life, on account of a thousand denarii which he thought had been  purloined from his possessions.    Otho declined battle, saying that he could not see a battle fought between  kindred, just as if he had become emperor in some legitimate fashion and  had not killed the consuls and the Caesar [Footnote: Piso and Galba are  meant.] and the emperor [Footnote: Piso and Galba are meant.] in Rome  itself. There fell in the battles which took place near Cremona four  myriads of men on both sides. Here, they say, various omens appeared  before the battle, most noteworthy being an unusual bird, such as men had  never before beheld, that was seen for a number of days.    [Sidenote:--11--] After the forces of Otho had been worsted, a certain  horseman brought word of the disaster to Otho. When the bystanders refused  to credit his report--it chanced that there were many gathered there--and  some set to calling him \"renegade\" and others \"enemy,\" he exclaimed:  \"Would that this news were false, Caesar: for most gladly would I have  died to secure thy victory. As it is, my demise is determined, that no one  may think I fled hither to secure my own safety. But do thou be assured  that the enemy will ere long arrive, and debate what must be done.\" Having  finished these words, he despatched himself. [Sidenote:--12--] This act  caused all to believe him, and they were ready to renew the conflict.  Those present formed a numerous body and there were not a few others at  hand from Pannonia. But the most important consideration, as usual in such  cases, was that they loved Otho and were quite devoted to him, not in word  but in their hearts. When, however, they besought him not to abandon  either himself or them, he waited until the rest, at report of the news,  had come running together, and then, after some muttered words to himself,  he delivered to the soldiers a speech, from which the following is a brief  excerpt:    [Sidenote:--13--] \"Enough, quite enough, has already been done. I hate a  civil war, even though I conquer: and I love all Romans, even though they  do not side with me. Let Vitellius be victor, since this has pleased the  gods; and let the lives of his soldiers also be spared, since this pleases  me. It is far better and more just that one should perish for all, rather  than many for one, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10891"],[0,"Algonquin Indian Tales (#14)"],[1,"better.    \"So the fire was much needed. But where it was, or how to get it, was the  question. Fortunately an old dreamer dreamed a dream about it. As the  council assembled to hear his dream he told them that the fire was  preserved in the heart of the earth by a magician called Sistinakoo, and  that it was kept very carefully surrounded by four walls, one within the  other, in each of which was a single door. At the first door a great snake  kept guard. At the second door a mountain lion or panther was the guardian.  A grizzly bear guarded the third door, and at the fourth and last door  Sistinakoo himself kept watchful care over the precious fire that smoldered  on a stone altar just inside this last wall.    \"When the council heard all this they were almost discouraged. They thought  it would be impossible for anyone to get by all of these guards and steal  the fire.    \"They first asked the fox to try, but he only reached the first door when  the great snake nearly made a meal of him. Thoroughly frightened, he rushed  back to the top of the earth and told of his narrow escape.    \"For a time nothing more was done to try and get the fire. The people  continued to suffer, for the earth kept getting colder and colder and ice  and snow were now to be found in lands that had previously been comfortably  warm. So the council was called again, and the question again raised as to  what could be done.    \"It happened that there came to the council a very old man who remembered a  tradition, handed down from his forefathers, which said that part of the  earth beneath us was hollow, and that some of the animals, even the great  buffaloes, had dwelt in those underground regions before they came to dwell  on the surface of the earth. He said that the coyote, the prairie wolf, was  the last one to leave, and that he was sure that he still remembered the  route to the very spot where Sistinakoo, the head chief of the regions,  guarded the fire so jealously.\"    \"Why should they so guard the fire, and be so careful about letting people  have it, when we know how good it is?\" asked Minnehaha.    \"Because,\" replied Kinnesasis, \"there was a tradition that at some time or  other the fire should get the mastery over men, and the whole world be  burned by it, and they thought that they would carefully guard it from  getting scattered about by careless people who might set the world on  fire.\"    \"Well, go on, Kinnesasis, and tell us the rest of the story,\" said the  impatient Sagastao.    \"So when the Indian council heard this story they sent for the king of the  coyotes and told him of their wish that he should return to that underworld  and bring up the fire for their use.    \"To their surprise and great delight the coyote said he would go, and he  immediately began his preparations for the journey. So greatly had the cold  increased that he found the dark mouth of the entrance under the mountains  almost surrounded by snow and ice. After traveling for some time in the  darkness he reached the outer wall, where he waited, a little distance from  the door, until the snake was taking his usual sleep. Then he quickly  stepped past him. Knowing the habits of the other animals, he waited until  they were asleep and then he noiselessly passed them all. Even Sistinakoo  himself was sound asleep. So the coyote crept silently up to the fire and  lighted the large brand or torch that was securely fastened to his tail.  The instant it began to blaze up, as the coyote rushed out through the  first door, Sistinakoo shouted, 'Who is there? Some one has been here and  has stolen the fire!'    [Illustration: \"The coyote was too quick for them all.\"]    \"He at once began to make a great row and loudly called to the different  keepers to close the doors in the walls. But the coyote was too quick for  them all, and ere the sleepers were wide enough awake to do anything he had  passed through all the doors and was far on his way to the top of the  ground. The fire was gladly received by the people, but after some time,  when some big prairies and forests had been burned up by it, the men got  fearful that the world might be destroyed and so they intrusted it to the  care of the old magician and his two daughters, with orders to be very  careful to whom they gave any. It was from them Nanahboozhoo stole it, to  scatter it once more freely among the people as we now have it.    \"But the tradition was still believed in the days of my grandfather that,  good as the fire was to warm us, and cook our food, it would yet become our  master, and do the world much harm.\"    Kinnesasis was thanked by all for his recital of this suggestive legend,  especially by his older listeners, who saw much in it that was in harmony  with the earlier beliefs of other nationalities.    By this time, however, the dogs in their trains were impatiently barking,  and longing to get back home for their suppers. So, after farewell  greetings to Kinnesasis and his wife, one cariole after another was loaded,  and away the happy ones sped over the icy expanse of the frozen lake.          CHAPTER X.      The Christmas Packet--The Distribution of Gifts--A Visit  by Dog Train, at Fifty-five Below Zero--Souwanas Tells  How the Indians first Learned to Make Maple Sugar.    How great the excitement was which attended the arrival of the Christmas  packet can hardly be realized by persons who have never been exposed to the  privations of a land which the mail reaches every six months, and where  they wait half a year for the daily paper. After this long waiting it is no  wonder that a great shout was raised when far away in the distance the  long-expected, heavily-loaded dog-trains were seen that for several hundred  miles had carried the precious messages of love and the tokens of good will  from dear ones far away.    This year an extra train well loaded with much-needed supplies for the  mission was among the arrivals. Its coming was hailed with special delight  by the children; for even in that Northland Santa Claus was not unexpected,  and it was surmised by some of the wee ones that possibly some of his gifts  would arrive about that time.    And they were not disappointed, for loved ones far away in more favored  lands had remembered these little ones in their Northern home, where the  Frost King reigns, and many and varied were the gifts which they now  received.    \"I am going to take Souwanas some of my candies,\" said Sagastao.    \"And I am going to give him a nice red silk handkerchief,\" said Minnehaha.    The children had by this time pretty well learned his weakness for these  things, and it was a pleasure now for them to think that they had it in  their power to make him happy.    The next morning was, as usual, bright and cloudless, but it was bitterly  cold. The mercury was frozen in one thermometer, and in the other one the  spirit indicated fifty-five below zero. Yet so impatient were these  spirited children to be off with their gifts to Souwanas, and with  something also for each member of the family, that their pleadings  prevailed. A cariole with plenty of fur robes was soon at the door, and  with old Kennedy as their driver they were soon speeding away behind a  train of dogs.    Indians are naturally alert and watchful, and so the merry jingle of the  silvery bells was heard while the cariole was still at some distance on the  trail. Cordially were they welcomed, and strong arms speedily carried them  into the cosy wigwam where, in the center, burned a great fire of dry  spruce and birch wood.    As the cold was so intense, and the children had permission to remain for  two hours, it was decided that Kennedy should return home at once with the  dogs, as it would have been cruel to have kept them out in the cold so  long.    The heavy wraps were soon removed and the children were comfortably seated  on the fur rugs provided for them. Then they very proudly opened their  parcels and distributed the contents--their own gifts as well as those  which had been sent to Souwanas and his family from the mission. Minnehaha  reserved her special gift for the last. When all of her others had been  bestowed she unfolded the beautiful red silk handkerchief and, going over  to Souwanas, she did her best to tie it nicely around his neck.    The old man, genuine Indian that he was, was much moved by her winsome ways  and handsome gift.    He said but little, but there was a soft, kindly look in his eyes that  showed his gratitude more than any words could have done. It meant a good  deal more than perhaps he would like to admit and those who saw it were  thankful that they had observed it, knowing that it meant so much.  Sagastao, who had already given him several presents, had held on to his  box of candies. He had learned that for such things the old man could be  coaxed to do almost anything, and now he held them out, and said:    \"Now, Souwanas, as all the presents have been passed around, I have got  some fine sweeties for you, but we must have a first-class Nanahboozhoo  story for them.\"    \"O yes!\" said Minnehaha. \"And as it is to be for sweeties let us have a  nice sweet story of Nanahboozhoo this time.\"    \"A sweet story you want? Well, before I begin let us fix up the fire and  all get comfortably seated around it.\"    Then, as they usually did, the two white children cuddled as close to the  inimitable story-teller as they could. Little cared they for the cold  without or even for the occasional puffs of smoke which seemed at times to  prefer to enter the eyes of the listeners rather than to go out at the  orifice at the top of the wigwam.    \"A sweet story,\" musingly said the old man, \"in this land of fish, and  bears, and wolves, and wildcats, and wolverines!\" Then he paused long  enough to fill his mouth again with the candies which he enjoyed so much.    \"A sweet story. Then it must be of a land, south of this, where for some  years I dwelt, many, many moons "]]]
