[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11553"],[0,"The Wonders of Prayer (#14)"],[1," illness, I thought of my hard bed and  prayed more earnest. One day my physician spoke of my hard bed. I told  him I was going to have a better one; I was praying for some springs.  And so I kept on. One day, a lady friend said something about my bed. I  did not say much. Somehow I felt I must not; I wanted to have it all the  Lord's doings, if I ever had any. One day my sister said a man was at  the door, who wanted to fit a set of springs to my bed. Why, I can't  tell how I felt; even after God had answered my simple prayers, and  honored my faith so many times, I was astonished at this. But she helped  me up, and the bed was fitted with nice, new springs. And they were  mine. The man could not tell anything about them. My sister says,  'Annie, did you order them?' I said, 'No.' 'Don't you know who sent  them?' I said, 'No.' 'Did you ask Mrs. W---- to order them?' I said, 'I  did not; I would lay here six years before I would do it. No, somebody  had a hand in it, but the Lord sent them, because I prayed for them all  the time.' A friend was present when my physician called. I told him  about the new springs. His kind face lit up grandly at this new evidence  that God did answer humble, faithful prayer, and he turned to my friend  with the words: 'I am glad they were just what she has been praying  for.' I do not think he had anything to do about them. But these springs  are only another proof of his love and power, in touching the hearts of  his children to help others. And they have their reward. Soon after  this, a lady sent me a white spread for my bed. Surely, God is good to  his little ones.\"      THE HEALING OF MARY THEOBALD.      The following incident is related by her pastor, at Woburn, Mass., who,  for three and a half years, was well acquainted with her physical  condition, and who testified, in _The Congregationalist_, that no  medicine, or physician's aid or advice, was of any avail:    \"From the first of my acquaintance to the last, she had an unswerving  confidence in her recovery. Many times has she said to me: 'I believe  that I shall be well. Jesus will raise me up. I shall hear you preach  some day.'    \"But, in common with the friends who were watching her case, and with  the physicians who had exhausted their skill upon her in vain, I had  little or no hope for her. It seemed to me that her life was to be one  of suffering; that God was keeping her with us that we might have a  heroic example of what His grace could enable one to bear and to become.    \"A few days ago, I received from her lips the following statement of the  origin and progress of her sickness: 'My first sickness occurred when I  was about sixteen years old. This illness lasted for a year. Indeed, I  was never well again. That sickness left me with a bad humor, which, for  two years, kept me covered with boils. When the boils disappeared, the  trouble was internal. Physicians feared a cancer. For ten years, I was  sick, more or less--sometimes able to work, sometimes utterly prostrate.    \"'My second severe illness began in the Autumn of 1871. I had been  failing for two years. Then I was obliged to give up. I was on the bed  five months. From this illness I never recovered so as to labor or walk  abroad. When not confined to my bed, I have been on the lounge, as you  have known me. No one can ever know the suffering which these years have  brought me.'    \"My acquaintance with her began in the Spring of 1873. Several times  since I have known her, she has been carried so low that we have thought  her release near at hand; and, indeed, the general tendency has been  downwards. I recently asked an intelligent physician, who had attended  her for a year or more, to give me the facts in her case. He replied:  'She is diseased throughout. Her system is thoroughly soured. It  responds to nothing. Almost every function is abnormal. There is no help  for her in medicine.' Other physicians had tried their skill with the  same result. It was generally admitted by doctors, friends and family,  that nothing more could be done for her. While all saw only suffering  and an early death in store for her, yet she confidently expected to be  well, and her faith never waned.    \"It was her custom to spend a few weeks each year in the family of one  of the sisters in the church. At her last visit, it was evident to this  lady that Mary was not so well as in former years. One day, when  conversation turned upon this topic, she felt constrained to express her  fears. But Mary was hopeful. A proposition was made, and arrangements  were perfected to visit Doctor Cullis, to secure the benefit of his  prayers. But her feebleness was so great that the plan was abandoned.  'If,' said Mrs. F., 'faith is to cure you, why go to Doctor Cullis, or  to any one? Let us go to God ourselves; and, Mary, if you have faith  that God can and will cure you sometime, why not believe that He will  _cure you now?_'    \"She felt herself cast on God alone. All hope of human help was at an  end. She had thought it, hitherto, enough patiently to wait His time.  She saw that, after all, she must not dishonor God by limiting His  power. Again her Bible opened to the familiar passages, '_the prayer of  faith shall save the sick_;' 'according to your faith be it unto you.'  She felt that the time for testing her faith had come. She would  dishonor the Lord no longer. Requesting the prayers of the family that  God would now grant healing and restoration, she tottered to her couch,  and, asking that in the morning she might be well, calmly closed her  eyes in the assurance that it would be so. _And according to her faith,  so it was. She came forth in the morning without a remnant of the pain  which had filled a decade of years with agony_. That Sabbath was to her,  indeed, 'a high day.' A week later the frequent prophecy that she should  hear me preach was fulfilled.    \"_Not a vestige of suffering remained_. So far as that is concerned,  there was not a hint left that she had been an invalid for almost a  score of years.    \"_She immediately took her place in the family as a well person._ Two  days after, I saw her. She came to meet me with a step light and strong,  and with a face written all over with thankfulness and joy. Since that  time all the abandoned duties of active life have been resumed. When  last I saw her, she was in bounding health and spirits, declaring that  she could not remember when she had felt so happy and well. That  night--one of the coldest of the winter, the roads at their iciest--she  walked more than half a mile to and from the prayer-meeting.    It is difficult for those who are not conversant with the case to  believe it, yet there is no illusion in it. _That she went to sleep a  suffering, feeble, shattered woman, and, awoke free from pain, and that  she has been gaining in strength ever since, are facts that cannot be  doubted_.\"      HOW PRAYER HELPED HIM TO KEEP THE PLEDGE.      In a rural district, in the North of England, lived a shoe-maker who had  signed the temperance pledge often, but never had strength to keep it.  After a while, he was able to keep it, and reformed entirely. A friend  was curious to learn how he had been able, at last, to win the victory,  and went to see him.    \"Well, William, how are you?\"    \"Oh, pretty well. I had only eighteen pence and an old hen when I  signed, and a few old scores; but now I have about ten pounds in the  bank, and my wife and I have lived through the summer without getting  into debt. But as I am only thirty weeks old yet (so he styled himself),  I cannot be so strong yet, my friend.\"    \"How is it you never signed before?\"    \"I did sign; but I keep it different now to what I did before, friend.\"    \"How is this?\"    \"Why, I _gae doon_ on my knees and pray.\"    Here was the _real strength of prayer_. His own resolves were of no  value; but when he called on God to help, then came new strength, and he  was kept by restraining grace. The bitter experience of those who pledge  and pledge over and over again, and never gain the victory, at last must  come to either of two ends--their utter destruction, or else to call on  God in prayer, to help them keep the pledge manfully, and make them  steadfast in their resolutions.      ONE WHO REFUSED THE HOLY SPIRIT.      The following incident is related by D.L. Moody, the Evangelist, which  contains a warning, how the Holy Spirit avenges itself to those who  refuse its admonitions. It is a remarkable instance of the control of an  overruling God, who alone knew that man's mind, and which alone could  bring that text so often to his memory:    \"There was a young man in my native village--he was not a young man when  I was talking to him--we were working on the farm together one day and  he was weeping; I asked him what he was weeping about, and he told me a  very strange story. When he left home his mother gave him the text:  '_Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these  things will be added unto you_.' He was ambitious to get rich, and  thought when he had got comfortable, that was the time to give his  attention to religion. He went from village to village, and got nothing  to do. Sunday came, and he went into the village church. _What was his  great surprise to hear the minister preach from that text_. It went down  into his heart--he thought that it was his mother's prayers that were  following him--he thought the whole sermon was for himself, and thought  he would like to get out. For days be could not get that text and sermon  out of his mind. He went on still, from village to village, and at last  he went into another church after weeks had rolled away. He went for  some Sundays to the church, and it wasn't a great while before the  minister _gave out this very text_. He thought surely it was God calling  him then, and he said, coolly and deliberately, _he would not seek the  Kingdom of God_. He went on in this "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11565"],[0,"Friends, though divided: A Tale of the Civil War (#14)"],[1,"no establishment of which you can be the head. In these days,  however, the distinctions of master and servant are less broad than  before, and in the field we shall be companions rather than master and  follower. So, if you like to cast in your fortunes with mine, here is my  hand on it. You have already proved your friendship to me as well as  your quickness and courage, and believe me, you will not find me or my  father ungrateful. But for you, I should now be in the cells, and your  old master in no slight danger of finding himself in prison, to say  nothing of the upset of the negotiations for which I came to London.  Therefore, you have deserved well, not only of me, but of the king, and  the adventure may not turn out so badly as it has begun. We had best  strike south, and go round by Tunbridge, and thence keeping west, into  Berkshire, and so to Oxford. In this way we shall miss the Parliament  men lying round London, and those facing the Royalists between Reading  and Oxford.\"    This order was carried out. The lads met with but few questioners, and  replying always that they were London apprentices upon their way home to  visit their friends for a short time, passed unsuspected. At first the  want of funds had troubled them, for Harry had forgotten the money sewn  up in his shoe. But presently, remembering this, and taking two gold  pieces out of their hiding-place, they went merrily along the road and  in five days from starting arrived at Oxford.          CHAPTER VII.    IN A HOT PLACE.      Making inquiries, Harry found that his father was living at a house in  the college of Brazenose, and thither he made his way. Not a little  surprised was the trooper, who was on guard before the door, to  recognize his master's son in one of the two lads who, in the clothes of  apprentices shrunk with water and stained with mud and travel, presented  themselves before him. Harry ascended at once to Sir Henry's room, and  the latter was delighted to see him again, for he had often feared that  be had acted rashly in sending him to London. Harry briefly told his  adventures, and introduced his friend Jacob to his father.    Sir Henry immediately sent for a clothier, and Harry was again made  presentable; while a suit of serviceable clothes adapted to the position  of a young gentleman of moderate means was obtained for Jacob. Then,  accompanied by his son, Sir Henry went to the king's chambers, and  informed his majesty of all that had happened. As, from the reports  which had reached the king of the temper of the people of London, he had  but small hope that anything would come of the attempt that was being  made, he felt but little disappointed at hearing of the sudden return of  his emissary. Harry was again asked in, and his majesty in a few words  expressed to him his satisfaction at the zeal and prudence which he had  shown, and at his safe return to court.    On leaving the king Harry awaited anxiously what his father would  determine concerning his future, and was delighted when Sir Henry said,  \"It is now a year once these troubles began, Harry, and you have so far  embarked upon them, that I fear you would find it difficult to return to  your studies. You have proved yourself possessed of qualities which will  enable you to make your way in the world, and I therefore think the time  has come when you can take your place in the ranks. I shall ask of the  king a commission for you as captain in my regiment, and as one of my  officers has been killed you will take his place, and will have the  command of a troop.\"    Harry was delighted at this intimation; and the following day received  the king's commission.    A few days afterward he had again to ride over to Furness Hall, which  was now shut up, to collect some rents, and as he returned through  Abingdon he saw Lucy Rippinghall walking in the streets. Rather proud of  his attire as a young cavalier in full arms, Harry dismounted and  courteously saluted her.    \"I should hardly have known you, Master Furness,\" she said. \"You look so  fierce in your iron harness, and so gay with your plumes and ribands. My  brother would be glad to see you. My father as you know, is away. Will  you not come in for a few minutes?\"    Harry, after a few moments' hesitation, assented. He longed to see his  old friend, and as the latter was still residing at Abingdon, while he  himself had already made his mark in the royal cause, he did not fear  that any misconstruction could be placed upon his visit to the Puritan's  abode. Herbert received him with a glad smile of welcome.    \"Ah, Harry,\" he said, \"so you have fairly taken to man's estate. Of  course, I think you have done wrong; but we need not argue on that now.  I am glad indeed to see you. Lucy,\" he said, \"let supper be served at  once.\"    It was a pleasant meal, and the old friends chatted of their schooldays  and boyish pastimes, no allusion being made to the events of the day,  save that Herbert said, \"I suppose that you know that my father is now a  captain in the force of the Commons, and that I am doing my best to keep  his business going during his absence.\"    \"I had heard as much,\" Harry answered. \"It is a heavy weight to be  placed on your shoulders, Herbert.\"    \"Yes,\" he said, \"I am growing learned in wools, and happily the business  is not falling off in my hands.\"    It was characteristic of the civil war in England that during the whole  time of its existence the affairs of the country went on as usual.  Business was conducted, life and property were safe, and the laws were  enforced just as before. The judges went their circuits undisturbed by  the turmoil of the times, acting under the authority alike of the Great  Seals of the King and Parliament. Thus evildoers were repressed, crime  put down, and the laws of the land administered just as usual, and as if  no hostile armies were marching and fighting on the fair fields of  England. In most countries during such troubled times, all laws have  been at an end, bands of robbers and disbanded soldiers have pillaged  and ruined the country, person and property alike have been unsafe,  private broils and enmities have broken forth, and each man has carried  his life in his hand. Thus, even in Abingdon, standing as it did halfway  between the stronghold of the crown at Oxford, and the Parliament army  at Reading, things remained quiet and tranquil. Its fairs and markets  were held as usual, and the course of business went on unchecked.    On his return to Oxford Harry learned that the king, with a portion of  the army, was to set out at once for Gloucester, to compel that city,  which had declared for the Commons, to open its gates. With a force of  thirteen thousand men the king moved upon Gloucester. When he arrived  outside its walls, on the 10th of August, he sent a summons to the town  to surrender, offering pardon to the inhabitants, and demanding an  answer within two hours. Clarendon has described how the answer was  returned. \"Within less than the time described, together with a  trumpeter, returned two citizens from the town with lean, pale, sharp,  and bad visages, indeed, faces so strange and unusual, and in such a  garb and posture, that at once made the most severe countenances merry,  and the most cheerful heart sad, for it was impossible such ambassadors  could bring less than a defiance. The men, without any circumstance of  duty or good manners, in a pert, shrill, undismayed accent, said that  they brought an answer from the godly city of Gloucester to the king,  and were so ready to give insolent and seditious answers to any  questions, as if their business were chiefly to provoke the king to  violate his own safe-conduct.\" The answers which these strange  messengers brought was that the inhabitants and soldiers kept the city  for the use of his majesty, but conceived themselves \"only bound to obey  the commands of his majesty signified by both houses of Parliament.\"  Setting fire to the houses outside their walls, the men of Gloucester  prepared for a resolute resistance. The walls were strong and well  defended, and the king did not possess artillery sufficient to make  breaches therein, and dreading the great loss which an assault upon the  walls would inflict upon his army, he determined to starve the city into  submission. The inhabitants, although reduced to sore straits, yet  relying upon assistance coming to them, held out, and their hopes were  not disappointed, as Essex, at the head of a great army, was sent from  London to relieve the place. Upon his approach, the king and his  councilors, deciding that a battle could not be fought with advantage,  drew off from the town, and gave up the siege.    Both armies now moved in the direction of London; but Prince Rupert,  hearing that a small body of Parliament horse were besieging the house  of Sir James Strangford, an adherent of the crown, took with him fifty  horse, and rode away to raise the siege, being ever fond of dashing  exploits in the fashion of the knights of old. The body which he chose  to accompany him was the troop commanded by Harry Furness, whose gayety  of manner and lightness of heart had rendered him a favorite with the  prince. The besieged house was situated near Hereford; and at the end of  a long day's march Prince Rupert, coming in sight of the Roundheads,  charged them with such fury that they were overthrown with scarce any  resistance, and fled in all directions. Having effected his object, the  prince now rode to Worcester, where he slept, and thence by a long day's  march to a village where he again halted for the night.    An hour after his arrival, a messenger came in from Lady Sidmouth, the  wife of Sir Henry Sidmouth, asking him to ride over and take up his  abode for the night at her house. Bidding Harry accompany him, the  prince rode off, leaving the troop under the charge of Harry's  lieutenant, Jacob, who had proved himself an"]]]
