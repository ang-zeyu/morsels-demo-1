The wedding party came to a halt at the foot of the tree and  some of them lay down to eat and the Raja got out of his palki and lay  down to sleep in the shade. After a time Kara got tired of holding the  tiger's paunch in his arms and whispered to Guja that he could hold it  no longer, Guja told him on no account to let it go but at last Kara  got so tired that he let it fall right on the top of the Raja; then  all the Raja's attendants raised a shout that the Raja's stomach had  burst and all ran away in a panic leaving everything they had under  the tree; but after they had gone a little distance they thought of  the goods they had left behind and how they could not continue the  journey without them, so they made their way back to the banyan tree.    But meanwhile Kara and Guja had climbed down and gathered together all  the fine clothes and everything valuable and taken them up into the  tree. And Kara took up a large drum which he found and in one end of  the drum he made a number of little holes: and he caught a number of  wild bees which had a nest in the tree and put them one by one into  the drum. When the Raja's attendants came back and saw that there  were two men in the tree, they called out: \"Why have you dishonoured  our Raja? We will kill you.\" Kara and Guja answered \"Come and see who  will do the killing.\" So they began to fight and the Raja's men fired  their guns at Kara and Guja till they were tired of shooting, and had  used up all their powder and shot, but they never hit them. Then Kara  and Guja called out \"Now it is our turn!\" And when the Raja's men saw  that Kara and Guja had nothing but a drum they said \"Yes, it is your  turn.\" So Kara and Guja beat the drum and called \"At them, my dears:  at them my dears.\" And the wild bees flew out of the drum and stung  the Raja's men and drove them right away. Then Kara and Guja took  all their belongings and went home and ever after were esteemed as  great Rajas because of the wealth which they had acquired.          XXI. The Magic Cow.    There was once a Raja who had an only son named Kara and in the  course of time the Raja fell into poverty and was little better than  a beggar. One day when Kara was old enough to work as a cowherd his  father called him and said \"My son, I am now poor but once I was  rich. I had a fine estate and herds of cattle and fine clothes; now  that is all gone and you have scarcely enough to eat. I am old and  like to die and before I leave you I wish to give you this advice:  there are many Rajas in the world, Raja above Raja; when I am dead  do you seek the protection of some powerful Raja.\" As there was not  enough to eat at home Kara had to take service as goat-herd under a  neighbouring Raja; by which he earned his food and clothes and two  rupees a year. Some time afterwards his father died and Kara went  to his master and asked for a loan of money with which to perform  his father's funeral ceremonies, and promised to continue in his  service until he had worked off the loan. So the Raja advanced him  five rupees and five rupees worth of rice, and with this money Kara  gave the funeral feast. Five or six days later his mother died, and  he again went to the Raja and asked for ten rupees more; at first the  Raja refused but Kara besought him and promised to serve him for his  whole life if he could not repay the loan. So at last the Raja lent  him ten rupees more, and he gave the funeral feast. But the Raja's  seven sons were very angry with their father because he had lent twenty  rupees to a man who had no chance of paying, and they used to threaten  and worry Kara because he had taken the money. Then Kara remembered  how his father had said that there were many Rajas in the world,  Raja above Raja, and he resolved to run away and seek service with  the greatest Raja in the world. So he ran away and after travelling  some distance he met a Raja being carried in a palki and going with a  large party to fetch a bride for his son; and when he heard who it was  he decided to follow the Raja; so he went along behind the palki and  at one place a she-jackal ran across the road; then the Raja got out  of his palki and made a salaam to the jackal. When Kara saw this he  thought \"This cannot be the greatest Raja in the world or why should  he salaam to the jackal. The jackal must be more powerful than the  Raja; I will follow the jackal.\" So he left the wedding party and  went after the jackal; now the jackal was hunting for food for her  young ones, and as Kara followed her wherever she went she could  find no opportunity of killing a goat or sheep; so at last she went  back to the cave in which she lived. Then her cubs came whining to  meet her and she told her husband that she had been able to catch  nothing that day because a man had followed her wherever she went,  and had come right up to their cave and was waiting outside.    Then the he-jackal told her to ask what the man wanted. So she went  out to Kara and asked him and Kara said \"I have come to place myself  under your protection;\" then she called the he-jackal and they said  to him, \"We are jackals and you are a man. How can you stay with us;  what could we give you to eat and what work could we find for you to  do?\" Kara said that he would not leave them as all his hopes lay in  them; and at last the jackals took pity on him and consulted together  and agreed to make him a gift as he had come to them so full of  hope; so they gave him a cow which was in the cave, and said to him:  \"As you have believed in us we have made up our minds to benefit  you; take this cow, she will supply you with everything you want;  if you address her as mother she will give you whatever you ask,  but do not ask her before people for they would take her from you;  and do not give her away whatever inducements are offered you.\"    Then Kara thanked them and called down blessings on their heads  and took the cow and led it away homewards. When he came to a tank  he thought he would bathe and eat; while he bathed he saw a woman  washing clothes at the other side of the tank but he thought that  she would not notice him, so he went up to the cow and said \"Mother,  give me a change of clothes.\" Thereupon the cow vomited up some nice  new clothes and he put them on and looked very fine. Then he asked  the cow for some plates and dishes and she gave them; then he asked  for some bread and some dried rice, and he ate all he wanted and  then asked the cow to keep the plates and dishes for him; and the  cow swallowed them up again.    Now the woman by the tank had seen all that had happened and ran  home and told her husband what she had seen and begged him to get  hold of the wonderful cow by some means or other. Her husband could  not believe her but agreed to put it to the test, so they both went  to Kara and asked where he was going and offered to give him supper,  and put him up for the night and give grass for his cow. He accepted  this invitation and went with them to their house and they gave him  the guest-room to sleep in and asked what he would have to eat, but he  said that he did not want any supper,--for he intended to get a meal  from the cow after every one was asleep. Then the man and his wife  made a plot and pretended to have a violent quarrel and after abusing  each other for some time the man flung out of the house in a passion  and pretended to run away; but after going a short distance he crept  back quietly to the guest-room. Hanging from the roof was the body of a  cart and he climbed up into that and hid himself, without Kara knowing  anything about it. When Kara thought that every one was asleep, he  asked his cow for some food and having made a good meal went to sleep.    The man watching up above saw everything and found that his wife had  spoken the truth; so in the middle of the night he climbed down and  led away Kara's magic cow and put in its place one of his own cows of  the same colour. Early the next morning Kara got up and unfastened the  cow and began to lead it away, but the cow would not follow him; then  he saw that it had been changed and he called his host and charged him  with the theft. The man denied it and told him to call any villagers  who had seen him bring his cow the day before; now no one had seen  him come but Kara insisted that the cow had been changed and went to  summon the village headman and the villagers to decide the matter:  but the thief managed to give a bribe of one hundred rupees to the  headman and one hundred rupees to the villagers and made them promise  to decide in his favour; so when they met together they told Kara  that he must take the cow which he had found tied up in the morning.    Kara protested and said that he would fetch the person from whom he  had got the cow and take whichever cow he pointed out. Telling them  that they were responsible for his cow while he was away, he hastened  off to the cave where the jackals lived. The jackals somehow knew  that he had been swindled out of the cow, and they met him saying  \"Well, man, have you lost your cow?\" And he answered that he had  come to fetch them to judge between himself and the villagers: so  the jackals went with him and he went straight to the headman and  told him to collect all the villagers; meanwhile the jackals spread  a mat under a peepul tree and sat on it chewing _pan_ and when the  villagers had assembled the jackal began to speak, and said: \"If a  judge takes a bribe his descendants for several generations shall eat  filth, in this world and the next; but if he make public confession,  then he shall escape this punishment. This is what our forefathers have  said; and the man who defrauds another shall be thrust down into hell;  this also they have said.

The senators had voted a general  thanksgiving, but, \"Thanksgiving!\" cried Cato, \"rather expiation!  Pray  the gods not to visit upon our armies the sin of a guilty general.  Give  up Caesar to the Germans, and let the foreigner know that Rome does not  enjoin perjury, and rejects with horror the fruit thereof!\"    Caesar had all the gifts, all the means of success and empire, that can  be possessed by man.  He was great in politics and in war; as active and  as full of resource amidst the intrigues of the Forum as amidst the  combinations and surprises of the battle-field, equally able to please  and to terrify.  He had a double pride, which gave him double confidence  in himself, the pride of a great noble and the pride of a great man.  He  was fond of saying, \"My aunt Julia is, maternally, the daughter of kings;  paternally, she is descended from the immortal gods; my family unites, to  the sacred character of kings who are the most powerful amongst men, the  awful majesty of the gods who have even kings in their keeping.\"  Thus,  by birth as well as nature, Caesar felt called to dominion; and at the  same time he was perfectly aware of the decadence of the Roman  patriciate, and of the necessity for being popular in order to become  master.  With this double instinct he undertook the conquest of the Gauls  as the surest means of achieving conquest at Rome.  But owing either to  his own vices or to the difficulties of the situation, he displayed in  his conduct and his work in Gaul so much violence and oppression, so much  iniquity and cruel indifference, that, even at that time, in the midst of  Roman harshness, pagan corruption, and Gallic or German barbarism, so  great an infliction of moral and material harm could not but be followed  by a formidable reaction.  Where there are strength and ability, the want  of foresight, the fears, the weaknesses, the dissensions of men, whether  individuals or peoples, may be for a long while calculated upon; but it  may be carried too far.  After six years' struggling Caesar was victor;  he had successively dealt with all the different populations of Gaul; he  had passed through and subjected them all, either by his own strong arm,  or thanks to their rivalries.  In the year of Rome 702 he was suddenly  informed in Italy, whither he had gone on his Roman business, that most  of the Gallic nations, united under a chieftain hitherto unknown, were  rising with one common impulse, and recommencing war.    The same perils and the same reverses, the same sufferings and the same  resentments, had stirred up amongst the Gauls, without distinction of  race and name, a sentiment to which they had hitherto been almost  strangers, the sentiment of Gallic nationality and the passion for  independence, not local any longer, but national.  This sentiment was  first manifested amongst the populace and under obscure chieftains; a  band of Carnutian peasants (people of Chartrain) rushed upon the town of  Genabum (Gies), roused the inhabitants, and massacred the Italian traders  and a Roman knight, C. Fusius Cita, whom Caesar had commissioned to buy  corn there.  In less than twenty-four hours the signal of insurrection  against Rome was borne across the country as far as the Arvernians,  amongst whom conspiracy had long ago been waiting and paving the way for  insurrection.  Amongst them lived a young Gaul whose real name has  remained unknown, and whom history has called Vercingetorix, that is,  chief over a hundred heads, chief-in-general.  He came of an ancient and  powerful family of Arvernians, and his father had been put to death in  his own city for attempting to make himself king.  Caesar knew him, and  had taken some pains to attach him to himself.  It does not appear that  the Arvernian aristocrat had absolutely declined the overtures; but when  the hope of national independence was aroused, Vercingetorix was its  representative and chief.  He descended with his followers from the  mountain, and seized Gergovia, the capital of his nation.  Thence his  messengers spread over the centre, north-west, and west of Gaul; the  greater part of the peoplets and cities of those regions pronounced from  the first moment for insurrection; the same sentiment was working amongst  others more compromised with Rome, who waited only for a breath of  success to break out.  Vercingetorix was immediately invested with the  chief command, and he made use of it with all the passion engendered by  patriotism and the possession of power; he regulated the movement,  demanded hostages, fixed the contingents of troops, imposed taxes,  inflicted summary punishment on the traitors, the dastards, and the  indifferent, and subjected those who turned a deaf ear to the appeal of  their common country to the same pains and the same mutilations that  Caesar inflicted on those who obstinately resisted the Roman yoke.    At the news of this great movement Caesar immediately left Italy, and  returned to Gaul.  He had one quality, rare even amongst the greatest  men: he remained cool amidst the very hottest alarms; necessity never  hurried him into precipitation, and he prepared for the struggle as if he  were always sure of arriving on the spot in time to sustain it.  He was  always quick, but never hasty; and his activity and patience were equally  admirable and efficacious.  Starting from Italy at the beginning of 702  A. U. C., he passed two months in traversing within Gaul the Roman  province and its neighborhood, in visiting the points threatened by the  insurrection, and the openings by which he might get at it, in assembling  his troops, in confirming his wavering allies; and it was not before the  early part of March that he moved with his whole army to Agendicum  (Sens), the very centre of revolt, and started thence to push on the war  with vigor.  In less than three months he had spread devastation  throughout the insurgent country; he had attacked and taken its principal  cities, Vellaunodunum (Trigueres), Genabum (Gien), Noviodunum (Sancerre),  and Avaricum (Bourges), delivering up everywhere country and city, lands  and inhabitants, to the rage of the Roman soldiery, maddened at having  again to conquer enemies so often conquered.  To strike a decisive blow,  he penetrated at last to the heart of the country of the Arvernians, and  laid siege to Gergovia, their capital and the birthplace of  Vercingetorix.    The firmness and the ability of the Gallic chieftain were not inferior to  such a struggle.  He understood from the outset that he could not cope in  the open field with Caesar and the Roman legions; he therefore exerted  himself in getting together a body of cavalry numerous enough to harass  the Romans during their movements, to attack their scattered detachments,  to bear his orders swiftly to all quarters, and to keep up the excitement  amongst the different peoplets with some hope of success.  His plan of  campaign, his repeated instructions, his passionate entreaties to the  confederates were to avoid any general action, to anticipate by their own  ravages those of the Romans, to destroy everywhere, at the approach of  the enemy, stores, springs, bridges, trees, and habitations: he wanted  Caesar to find in his front nothing but ruins and clouds of warriors  relentless in pursuing him without getting within reach.  Frequently he  succeeded in obtaining from the people those painful sacrifices in the  interest of the common safety; as when the Biturigians (inhabitants of  the district of Bourges) burned in one day twenty of their towns or  villages.  Vercingetorix adjured them also to burn Avaricum (Bourges),  their capital; but they refused, and the capture of Avaricum, though  gallantly defended, justified the urgency of Vercingetorix, seeing that  it was an important success for Caesar and a serious blow for the Gauls.  Out of forty thousand combatants within the walls, it is said, scarcely  eight hundred escaped the slaughter and succeeded in joining  Vercingetorix, who had hovered continually in the neighborhood without  being able to offer the besieged any effectual assistance.  Nor was it  only against the Romans that he had to struggle; he had to fight amongst  his own people, against rivalry, mistrust, impatience, and  discouragement; he was accused of desiring, beyond everything, the  mastery; he was even suspected of keeping up, with the view of assuring  his own future, secret relations with Caesar; he was called upon to  attack the enemy in front, and so bring the war to a decisive issue.  It  is all very fine to be summoned by the popular voice to accomplish a  great and arduous work; but you cannot be, with impunity, the most  far-sighted, the most able, and the most in danger, because the most  devoted.  Vercingetorix was bearing the burden of his superiority and  influence, until he should suffer the penalty and pay with his life for  his patriotism and his glory.  He was approaching the happiest moment of  his enterprise and his destiny.  In spite of reverses, in spite of  Caesar's presence and activity, the insurrection was gaining ground and  strength; in the north, west, south-west, on the banks of the Rhine, the  Seine, and the Loire, the idea of Gallic nationality and the hope of  independence were spreading amongst people far removed from the centre of  the movement, and were bringing to Vercingetorix declarations of sympathy  or material re-enforcements.  An event of more importance took place in  the centre itself.  The AEduans, the most ancient allies and clients the  Romans had in Gaul, being divided amongst themselves, and feeling,  besides, the national instinct, ended, after much hesitation,"]]]
