The files of the _Liberator_, Mr. Garrison's paper, which can be  found in a number of the principal public libraries of the country,  constitute a vast storehouse of information concerning the labors of  the American Anti-slavery Society, with which Douglass was identified  from 1843 to 1847, the latter being the year in which he gave up  his employment as agent of the society and established his paper  at Rochester. Many letters from Mr. Douglass's pen appeared in the  _Liberator_ during this period.

When Juan met the false friend again, the false friend asked him what  gift he had this time. \"It is only a stick that if I say, 'Boombye,  boomba,' will beat you to death,\" said Juan, and with that the stick  leaped from his hand and began to belabor the wicked man. \"Lintic na  cahoy ito ay! [14] Stop it and I will give you everything I stole from  you.\" Juan ordered the stick to stop, but made the man, bruised and  sore, carry the net, the pot, and the spoons, and lead the goat to  Juan's home. There the goat shook silver from his beard till Juan's  three brothers and his mother had all they could carry, and they dined  from the pot and the magic spoons until they were full to their mouths.    \"Now,\" said Juan, \"you have beaten me and called me a fool all my life,  but you are not ashamed to take good things when I get them. I will  show you something else. Boombye, boomba!\" and the stick began to  beat them all. Quickly they agreed that Juan was head of the house,  and he ordered the beating to stop.    Juan now became rich and respected, but he never trusted himself  far from his stick day or night. One night a hundred robbers came  to break into the house, to take all his goods, and kill him, but  he said to the stick, \"Boombye, boomba!\" and with the swiftness of  lightning the stick flew around, and all those struck fell dead till  there was not one left. Juan was never troubled again by robbers,  and in the end married a princess and lived happily ever after.      CHAPTER 7    The Aderna Bird.    There was once a king who greatly desired to obtain an aderna bird,  which is possessed of magical powers, has a wonderful song, and talks  like men. This king had a beautiful daughter, and he promised her to  any one who would bring him an aderna bird. Now the quest for the  aderna bird is very dangerous, because, if the heart is not pure,  the man who touches the bird becomes stone, and the bird escapes.    There were in that country three brothers, Juan, Diego, and Pedro,  and they all agreed to set out together to catch the aderna bird. Afar  in the mountains they saw him, and Diego, being the eldest, had first  chance, and he caught the aderna bird, but being of impure life he  became a stone, and the bird flew away over the mountains.    Juan and Pedro pursued it over the rocky way till at last they saw  it again, and Pedro, being the next eldest, essayed to catch it. He,  too, being a bad man, was turned into stone and the aderna bird flew  over another mountain, and Juan, undaunted, followed alone.    When at last he saw the aderna bird he made a trap with a mirror with  a snare in front and soon caught the bird. He made a cage for it and  started on his homeward journey. When he reached the stone which was  his brother Pedro, he begged the bird to undo its work and make him  a man again, and the bird did so. Then the two went on to where Diego  was, and again Juan entreated the bird to set the other brother free,  and the bird did so.    But Pedro and Diego, far from being grateful for what Juan had done  for them, bound him, choked him, beat him, and left him for dead far  from any road or any habitation, and went on their way to the king  with the aderna bird, expecting for one the hand of the princess and  for the other a rich reward.    But the aderna bird would not sing. Said the king, \"O Aderna Bird,  why do you not sing?\" The bird replied, \"O Mighty King, I sing only  for him who caught me.\" \"Did these men catch you?\" \"No, O King, Juan  caught me, and these men have beaten him and stolen me from him.\" So  the king had them punished, and waited for the coming of Juan.    Juan meanwhile had freed himself from his bonds, and wandered sore  and hungry and lame through the forest. At last he met an old man  who said to him, \"Juan, why do you not go to the king's house, for  there they want you very much?\" \"Alas,\" said Juan, \"I am not able  to walk so far from weakness, and I fear I shall die here in the  forest.\" \"Do not fear,\" said the old man, \"I have here a wonderful  hat that, should you but whisper to it where you wish to go, in a  moment you are transported there through the air.\"    So the old man gave him the hat, and Juan put it on and said, \"Hat,  if this be thy nature, carry me across the mountains to the king's  palace.\" And the hat carried him immediately into the presence of  the king. Then the aderna bird began to sing, and after a time Juan  married the princess, and all went well for the rest of their lives.      CHAPTER 8    The Story of Juan and the Monkey.    Juan was a farmer, a farmer so poor that he had only one shirt and  one pair of trousers. Juan was much annoyed by monkeys, who stole his  corn. So he set a trap and caught several of them. These he killed  with a club until he came to the last, which said to him, \"Juan,  don't kill me and I will be your servant all your life.\" \"But I will,\"  said Juan. \"You are a thief and do not deserve to live.\" \"Juan, let me  live, and I will bring you good fortune, and if you kill me you will  be poor all your life.\" The monkey talked so eloquently that Juan let  himself be persuaded, and took the monkey home with him. The monkey  was true to his word, and served Juan faithfully, cooking, washing,  and hunting food for him, and at night going to distant fields and  stealing maize and palay which he added to Juan's little store.    One day the monkey said to Juan, \"Juan, why do you not marry?\" Said  Juan, \"How can I marry? I have nothing to keep a wife.\" \"Take my  advice,\" said the monkey, \"and you can marry the king's daughter.\" Juan  took the monkey's advice and they set out for the king's palace. Juan  remained behind while the monkey went up to the palace alone. Outside  he called, as the custom is, \"Honorable people!\" and the king said,  \"Come in.\" The king said, \"Monkey, where do you walk?\" and the monkey  said, \"Mr. King, I wish to borrow your salop. My master wishes to  measure his money.\" The king lent him the salop (a measure of about  two quarts), and the monkey returned to Juan. After a few hours he  returned it with a large copper piece cunningly stuck to the bottom  with paste. The king saw it and called the monkey's attention to it,  but the monkey haughtily waved his hand, and told the king that a  single coin was of no consequence to his master.    The next day he borrowed the salop again and the coin stuck in the  bottom was half a peso, and the third day the coin was a peso, but  these he assured the king were of no more consequence to his master  than the copper. Then the king told the monkey to bring his master  to call, and the monkey promised that after a few days he would.    They went home, and as Juan's clothes must be washed, Juan went to  bed while the monkey washed and starched them, pulling, pressing,  and smoothing them with his hands because he had no iron.    Then they went to call on the king, and the king told Juan that he  should marry the princess as soon as he could show the king a large  house, with a hundred head of cattle, carabao, horses, sheep, and  goats. Juan was very despondent at this, though he was too brave to  let the king know his thoughts, he told his troubles to the monkey,  who assured him that the matter was very easy.    The next day they took a drum and a shovel and went into the mountains,  where there was a great enchanter who was a very wealthy man and also  an asuang. They dug a great hole and then Juan hid in the woods and  began to beat his drum, and the monkey rushed up to the enchanter's  house and told him the soldiers were coming, and that he would hide  him. So the enchanter went with the monkey to the hole and the monkey  pushed him in and began with hands and feet to cover him up. Juan  helped, and soon the enchanter was dead and buried. Then they went  to the house and at the first door they opened they liberated fifty  people who were being fattened for the enchanter's table. These  people were glad to help Juan convey all the money, cattle, and all  the enchanter's wealth to the town. Juan built a house on the plaza,  married the princess, and lived happily ever after, but his friend the  monkey, having so well earned his liberty, he sent back to the woods,  and their friendship still continued.        CHAPTER 9    Juan the Drunkard who Visited Heaven.    There was once a man named Juan, who was a drunkard. One day when  he was drunker than usual he decided to visit his dead friends in  heaven. He took no baggage except two long bamboo buckets full of tuba,  which he carried one over each shoulder. He walked and walked for at  least a week, until he came to a place where they sold tuba. There he  filled his buckets, promising to pay on his return, and set out again.    After walking a long time he came to a city with a wall around it,  and at the gate sat an old man with a long beard and with keys at his  girdle whom he knew at once as St. Peter. \"Good-morning, St. Peter,\"  said Juan. \"I would like to see some of my friends that I think are  here.\" \"Who are you?\" asked St. Peter, getting up angrily. \"I am Juan  and I have come a long way to see some of my friends. Won't you let me  look?\" \"No,\" said St. Peter, \"I won't. You are drunk.\" \"Well, then,  only be so good as to let me take just a little peep.\" So St. Peter  opened the gate just the least bit, but Juan was not satisfied, so he  said, \"Good St. Peter, open the gate just a little wider for me to  see with both eyes.\" Then he persuaded St. Peter to let him put his  head in, and then by a little firmness he slipped in, still carrying  his buckets of tuba.    St. Peter ordered him to come out, but he started down a street he  saw, or rather a road, for there were no houses there. \"Stop!\" said  St. Peter, \"that road won't take you to your friends. Go the other  way.\" And Juan did so.    After he had gone on for some time, he found that he was surrounded by  devils who began "]]]
