CHAPTER VII.          _The Mode of Trial by_ Ordeal _and_ Red Water _in Africa.--The  Wars of its  Inhabitants.--The State of Barbarism and Slavery considered.--The Condition  of the Africans will not be improved by a late Legislative Act, without  further Interference.--Salutary Measures must be adopted towards the  Negroes in the Colonies.--A System suggested to abolish Slavery in Africa,  and the Slave Trade in general, and to enlarge the intellectual Powers of  its Inhabitants.--The proper Positions to effect an Opening to the Interior  of Africa, and to display to the World its manifold Resources._      Trial by _ordeal_ in Africa is a punishment for petty thefts and  delinquincies. Trial by _red water_ is generally applied to crimes of  greater magnitude. After the usual ceremonial of calling a palaver, the  operation is performed by heating a piece of iron in the fire, the hand of  the accused is dipped into a viscous preparation, and the iron is  immediately drawn horizontally over the palm of the hand. If the judges  (one of whom is always the executioner) have previously determined, in  defiance of all the evidence, to prove the culprit guilty, the consequence  is that the flesh is seared; but if they are predisposed to acquit him, the  iron is dexterously applied so as to absorb the unctuous surface on the  hand without affecting it, and a sentence of not guilty is pronounced.    Trial by _red water_ consists in making the accused drink a quantity of  water, into which is infused the poisonous juice of the melley or  _gris-gris_ tree; this is prepared by these _equitable_  judges, and  applied upon the same fraudulent principles as in  the trial by the _ordeal  of fire_; it is, however, less resorted to. If the unhappy object of  suspicion is affected in such a manner as they consider as a proof of  guilt, his brains are knocked out upon the spot, or the body is so inflated  by the pernicious liquid that it bursts. In either of these catastrophes  all his family are sold for slaves. Some survive these diabolical  expedients of injustice, but the issue is uniformly slavery. When chiefs of  influence, guilty of atrocity and fraud, become objects of accusation, the  ingredient is of course qualified so as to remove its fatal tendency. Hence  justice seldom or ever in this country can punish powerful offenders, or  shield the innocence of the weak and unprotected.    The iniquity and oppression sanctioned by these trials, is a dreadful  consequence of their avarice and inhumanity, for it is a fact that slaves  are created thereby, and human sacrifices offered to that spirit, which  they consider as their tutelar guardian: it is a subject which humanity  should seriously contemplate in the relinquishment of the slave trade,  whether, by the hasty adoption of that measure, before the intellectual  powers of the people are improved by civilization, this barbarous evil may  not be increased. When I closely enquired of the chiefs and natives  relative to these savage customs, they uniformly admitted the fact, \"that  such live in their country,\" but with their characteristic dissimulation,  always denied having perpetrated these horrid acts, and shifted the  diabolical practice to some other nation or tribe, adding, \"that only bad  men do that thing.\"    Circumcision is practised among men, and a certain infliction on women,  not, however, from religious motives, but to guard against the consequences  of a disease not uncommon among them. The infliction upon women is the  result of infidelity, or a sacrifice of chastity to loose gratification. As  a preliminary, they retire to the _bunda_, or penitentiary, and are there  secluded from all sexual intercourse. When the season of penitence is over,  the operation is performed by the rude application of two stones, fashioned  and sharpened for the purpose; this obliterates all delinquincy, and on  their return to the world they are considered as restored to virgin purity.    Wars in Africa originate from a variety of causes; in forming a correct  estimate of these, it is necessary to consider its localities and  situation. The inhabitants of this quarter of the earth, more particularly  those of the district now under consideration, compose numerous tribes and  nations, whose various views and interests excite jealousies and  contentions, which, aided by the passions peculiar to a barbarous people,  inevitably produce hostilities, and the effusion of human blood.    What we have hitherto known of this country undoubtedly proves that wars  are carried on with the most sanguinary violence: their prisoners, by the  customs of the country, are consigned to massacre, slavery, and  sacrifice,[1] to gratify the avarice, vanity, and cruelty of their chiefs;  one of these passions must be predominant, and therefore the question is,  which of them is the least pregnant with evil? It cannot admit of a doubt  that those who are victims to avarice meet a more mild and humane fate, in  falling into the hands of Europeans, than the unhappy portion who are  sacrificed to vanity and cruelty; and it is equally true, that since the  interior nations have been enabled to exchange their slaves for European  merchandize, the number of victims to the latter passion has decreased. I  am far from being the advocate of slavery, but I am stating a fact, and  leave it to the reader to form his own conclusions. Where confirmed habits  and immemorial custom is to be supplanted, it is certainly requisite to be  well acquainted with the nature and character of the natives, which I have  not here introduced in an exaggerated shape, but infinitely within the  bounds of their savage ferocity.    From these sources alone have arisen the expedients attendant upon the  slave trade; kidnapping and petty warfare form a very unimportant branch of  the barbarism which governs the inhabitants of Africa, and their enslaved  condition.    Viewing this in the mass of moral evil which disgraces the character of  man, it will be found that it is even disproportioned to the estimated  population of Africa, which, from the best authority, has been stated at  upwards of 160 millions; and to apply the consideration to our own  situation, it will be found, that the number of executions and  transportations from the United Kingdom, in proportion to its population,  is infinitely greater than the number of slaves exported from the shores of  Africa, to its numerous inhabitants. Unquestionably the slave trade has  extricated a number of human beings from death, whom the horrible  sacrifices before described consigned to a barbarous exit, and has been a  cause, though an immoral one when applied to Britons, of extricating many  victims, who otherwise would have been annually sacrificed: humanity has,  therefore, some consolation in this polluted branch of our commerce, which  in its nature is barbarous and inhuman.    Theories become extremely dangerous when they are impracticable, or  misapplied, and are pernicious in their consequences from the fallacious  measures they establish. In Africa crimes are punished by forfeitures,  slavery, or death; they are however rare; but accusations are often used to  procure slaves, whether for domestic purposes, sale, or sacrifice to their  customs. Death, as a punishment, is seldom the penalty of condemnation; and  if the culprit is rich, he can purchase his security. The alleged crime of  witchcraft, or magic, is a common means by which the chiefs increase their  accusations; and, consequently, the number of slaves. Adultery, and other  violations of social order, are punished by fine, but absolution is to be  obtained by money.    The crimes by which the chiefs obtain the condemnation and disposal of  their subjects, are nearly all imaginary; for few exist which, under their  laws, are considered as acts of turpitude. The abuse of authority, the  action of violent passions, barbarous customs, ferocious habits, and  insatiate avarice among the chiefs, augment the number of captives and  victims, and the operation of these is much greater in the interior than in  the maritime districts; but this leads me to the next part of my subject,  namely, that a late legislative act will not, without farther interference,  improve the condition of the African.    By the hasty conclusion of that measure, the unhappy African is now  abandoned to his fate; and we have surrendered him into the hands of other  nations, less acquainted with his character and situation. Former acts of  parliament had adopted wise and humane measures to ameliorate the condition  of slaves on board British vessls, so that their wants, and even their  comforts, were administered with a liberal hand; and much more might have  been done to augment these comforts. Instead of now being the object of  matured and wise regulations, the captive is exposed to the rapacity of our  enemies, who will derive great advantages from our abandonment of the  trade, and those who are incompetent, from the want of local knowledge, to  ease his shackles, and sooth him in his state of bondage. The magnitude and  nature of the disease, required a comprehensive system of policy to  eradicate it; and although in its nature and tendency of great moral  turpitude, alteratives were required calculated to its inveterate character  and established habits. The condition of the African, the probable  advantages he was to derive by our abandonment, and the circumstances of  commerce, were all considerations of important consequence.    Even virtue itself must modify to its standard many considerations of moral  evil, more particularly in a political point of view, that it may the more  effectually establish its principles; nor can it, amidst the corruptions of  society, exercise at all times its functions with due effect; neither has  an instance occurred where its prudence and discretion was more imperiously  called upon, than in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12545"],[0,"Traditions of the Tinguian: a Study in Philippine Folk-Lore (#14)"],[1,"in Lisnayan so that no one would see her, but now someone has found  her.\" So Langa-an gave them the engagement present [141] and she  asked how much they must pay as the marriage price. \"You must fill the  _balaua_ nine times,\" they answered. So Langa-an filled the _balaua_  nine times with different kinds of valuable things. As soon as she  had paid the marriage price she went back home. When she arrived in  Kadalayapan and reached the top of the ladder of the house she laid  down and slept, for she was drunk. \"How strange you act, mother. Why  don't you tell us the news before you sleep?\" said Aponitolau, and  she said, \"The engagement and marriage gifts were accepted.\"    In the afternoon they began to make _Sayang_. [142] Not long after the  old woman Alokotan, who conducted the _Sayang_ and made them dance  _Da-eng_, [143] arrived and she began to perform the ceremony. When  it became morning, \"You people who live with us, come and pound  rice,\" said Aponibolinayen. So the people gathered and pounded rice  for them. As soon as they finished pounding rice she commanded her  _liblibayan_ [144] to go and get betel-nuts. When they arrived with  the betel-nuts, \"You betel-nuts come and oil yourselves and go to  invite all our relatives, for we are making _Sayang_. Invite all the  people except the old enemies,\" she said and when it became evening  they made _Libon_ [145]    Asibowan was anxious to chew betel-nut and she went to search for  one in the corner of her house and she found an oiled nut which was  covered with gold. When she tried to cut it in two it said to her. \"Do  not cut me, for I came to invite people to attend the _Sayang_ of  Aponitolau and Aponibolinayen.\" And Asibowan said, \"I cannot go.\" \"If  you do not come I will grow on your knee,\" said the betel-nut. \"No,  go on my big pig.\" So the betel-nut jumped on the head of her pig and  it grew very high, and the pig squealed. \"Get off from my pig and I  will come,\" said Asibowan. Late in the afternoon they saw her below  the _talagan_. [146] \"Asibowan is here now, Aponibolinayen, come and  see her,\" said Aponitolau. So Aponibolinayen came and she took her to  their house, and Iwaginan took two skirts and he made them dance. He  danced first with Asibowan before he made the others dance and his  wife Gimbagonan was jealous. When they finished dancing he gave the  skirts to Aponibalagen and Sinagayan. As soon as Aponibalagen had  finished Iwaginan made Aponitolau dance with Gimbagonan. While they  were dancing Gimbagonan danced to the sound of the jars which she  had about her neck and in her hair, i.e., she had necklaces of big  jars and they stuck together so she could not hear the _gansas_. Not  long after Asibowan wished to go back home. \"Now I am going home,  Aponibolinayen, for no one is watching my house,\" \"No, do not go yet,  for someone wants to marry your daughter Binaklingan.\" \"I must go  now, you take care of her.\" So she went back home and they did not  see her. As soon as the _Sayang_ was over Dina-ogan was engaged to  Binaklingan. Soon he paid the marriage price, and it was the _balaua_  filled nine times with valuable things.    Not long after all the people went back to their homes, and  Aponibalagen was left alone and he acted as if he was drunk, but he was  not drunk. He laid down in the _balaua_, and Aponibolinayen covered him  with blankets. Not long after Aponigawani went outdoors for she felt  hot, and Aponibalagen peeped at her. Not long after she went inside  of the house and went into the ninth room, and Aponibalagen watched  her. When it became night Aponibalagen went to the place where she  was and Aponitolau did not see him. So he looked for her in the ninth  room, and she was playing the pan pipe. While she was playing she saw  a firefly, and she tried to hit it with her pan pipe, and Aponibalagen  said \"Do not strike me or you will hit my headaxe,\" and he became a  man again. \"How did you get in here?\" said Aponigawani. \"I came,  because I saw you when I was lying in the _balaua_.\" He sat down  beside her and tried to cut a betel-nut for her to chew. \"We will  chew betel-nut so we can tell our names,\" said Aponibalagen. She  took the betel-nut and they chewed. \"You tell your name first, for  you live here.\" \"No it is not good for me to tell my name first,  for I am a woman. You are the first.\" \"My name is Aponibalagen who  is the brother of Aponibolinayen who is the son of Pagbokasan of  Kaodanan.\" \"My name is Aponigawani who is the sister of Aponitolau  who is the daughter of Pagatipanan and Langa-an.\"    When they had been in the room nine nights Aponitolau went to see  Aponigawani, and when he got to the room Aponibalagen was there. \"Why  are you here, brother-in-law?\" said Aponitolau. \"I am here, because  I wish to marry your sister,\" said Aponibalagen. \"If you want  to marry her you must engage her and you come another day to make  _pakalon_.\" [147] Not long after Aponibalagen went home and told his  father and mother that they would go next day to make the _pakalon_  so he could marry Aponigawani. Aponitolau and his father and mother  went to Kaodanan and took the marriage price before Aponibalagen and  his people made the _pakalon_. Aponibalagen paid the same as Aponitolau  did for Aponibolinayen. Not long after they returned to Kadalayapan  and the next day Aponibalagen went and got Aponigawani. They danced  for one month and then they took Aponigawani to Kaodanan, and all  the people went home. This is all.    (Told by Lagmani, a woman of Patok.)        5    \"Mother Dinawagan go and engage me to someone, for I want to  be married. I like the sister of Aponibalagen of Natpangan\" said  Gawigawen of Adasin. \"Yes,\" said his mother. So she took her hat which  looked like the moonbeam and she started to go and when she arrived in  Natpangan she said, \"Good morning, nephew Aponibalagen.\" \"What do you  want here, Aunt?\" he replied. \"What do you want, you say, and I want  to talk with you.\" \"Come up, Aunt, and we will hear what you have to  say.\" So he asked his mother Ebang to prepare food. As soon as Ebang  had prepared the food and called them to eat, Aponibalagen went to get  the _basi_ and they drank before they ate. And Ebang broke up the fish  stick and put it in the pot and it became fish. [148] Not long after  they ate, and when they had finished Aponibalagen said to Dinawagan,  \"Come and see this.\" \"No, I better stay here.\" When Aponibalagen  urged her she came in and he opened the _basi_ jar which was nine  times inherited and as soon as they had drank Dinawagan said that she  could not tarry for it was afternoon, \"I have something to tell you,  Aponibalagen.\" \"What is it?\" said Aponibalagen. \"My son Gawigawen of  Adasin wants to marry your sister.\" Aponibalagen agreed, so she gave  a golden cup which looked like the moon as an engagement present,  and they agreed on a day for _pakalon_. [149] Aponibalagen said,  \"Tomorrow will be the day for _pakalon_.\"    Dinawagan went home. \"Did they accept our golden cup which looks  like the moon, mother?\" asked Gawigawen. \"Yes. Tomorrow will be the  _pakalon_,\" said the mother. Not long after she said, \"All you people  who live in the same town with us, prepare to go to the _pakalon_ of  Gawigawen in Natpangan tomorrow afternoon.\" The people agreed and in  the morning they truly started and they went. \"You, my jar _bilibili_  which always salutes the visitors, go first; and you my jar _ginlasan_  follow, and you _malayo_ and _tadogan_ and you _gumtan_.\" [150] So  they went first to Natpangan, and Gawigawen and the people followed  them, and also eighteen young girls who were Gawigawen's concubines  went also.    Not long after they arrived in Natpangan and Iwaginan and the other  people went to attend the _pakalon_, and also many people from the  other towns. When all whom they had invited arrived they agreed how  much Gawigawen should pay for his wife. Aponibalagen told them to fill  the _balaua_ [151] eighteen times with valuable things. So the _balaua_  was filled. Not long after they ate and when they had finished they  went to the yard and they played on _gansas_ and danced. Iwaginan  took the skirts and gave one to Nagten-ngaeyan of Kapanikiyan and  they danced. [152] When she danced she looked like the spindle. She  did not go around, but always moving and the water from the river  went up into the town and the striped fishes bit her heels. Not long  after they stopped dancing and Gimbagonan was jealous and she said  \"Ala, give me the skirt and I will dance next.\" \"Do not say that  Gimbagonan, for it is shameful for us,\" he answered her. Not long  after he gave the cloth to Dakandokan of Pakapsowan. She danced with  Algaba of Dagala. Not long after they finished dancing and Iwaginan  made Aponibolinayen and Balogaygayan dance. He often went to fight in  the enemies towns. Not long after Aponibolinayen went down from the  house and the sunshine vanished when she appeared. She danced with  Balogaygayan and when she moved her feet the water from the river  went up again into the town and the fish bit at her heels as they did  before. After they stopped Iwaginan made his wife Gimbagonan dance and  she was happy when she danced with Aponibalagen. When they danced the  big jars around Gimbagonan's neck made more noise than the _gansas_  and the jars said \"Kitol, kitol, kanitol, inka, inka, inkantol.\"    As soon as they finished dancing the people said, \"The best thing to  do is to go home, for we have been here three months now.\" \"We will  take Aponibolinayen\" said Dinawagan to the people who lived in the  same town with her and she spoke to Aponibalagen. So they prepared  rice and coconut soaked together and wrapped in leaves, and a cake  made of rice flour and coconut shaped like a tongue, a rice cake,  which was fried for Aponibolinayen's provision on the road. \"You who  live in the other towns who were invited, do not go home yet for we  are going"]]]
