NOTE: Letter of Feb. 17, 1939, from Mr. B.A. Botkin to Dr. Corse states  that my ex-slave story, \"Mama Duck\" is marred by use of the question and  answer method. In order to make this material of use as American Folk  Stuff material, I have rewritten it, using the first person, as related  by the informant.      Personal History of Informant    [TR: Repetitive information removed.]    1. Ancestry: Negro.    2. Place and date of birth: Richard (probably Richmond), Va., about  1828.    3. Family: unknown.    4. Places lived in, with dates: Has lived in Tampa since about 1870.    5. Education, with dates: Illiterate.    6. Occupations and accomplishments, with dates: None. Informant was a  slave, and has always performed common labor.    7. Special skills and interests: none.    8. Community and religious activities: none.    9. Description of informant: Small, emaciated, slightly graying, very  thin kinky hair, tightly braided in small pigtails. Somewhat wrinkled,  toothless. Active for her age, does washing for a living.    10. Other points gained in interview: Strange inability of local Old Age  Pension officials to establish right of claimants to benefits.  Inexplainable causes of refusal of direct relief.      MAMA DUCK    Gwan away f'm here, Po'-Boy; dat gemmen ain't gwine feed you nuthin. You  keep yo' dirty paws offen his close.    Come in, suh. Take care you don't fall thoo dat ol' po'ch flo'; hit  'bout ready to go t' pieces, but I 'way behind on rent, so I cain't ask  'em to have hit fixed. Dis ol' house aint fitten fer nobody t' live in;  winder glass gone an' roof leaks. Young folks in dese parts done be'n  usin' it fer a co't house 'fore I come; you know--a place to do dey  courtin' in. Kep' a-comin' atter I done move in, an' I had to shoo 'em  away.    Dat young rascal comin' yondah, he one of 'em. I claiah to goodness, I  wisht I had a fence to keep folks outa my yahd. Reckon you don't know  what he be quackin' lak dat fer. Dat's 'cause my name's \"Mama Duck.\" He  doin' it jus' t' pester me. But dat don't worry me none; I done quit  worryin'.    I sho' had plenty chance to worry, though. Relief folks got me on dey  black list. Dey give rashuns to young folks what's wukkin' an' don't  give me nary a mouthful. Reason fer dat be 'cause dey wanted me t' go t'  de porehouse. I wanted t' take my trunk 'long, an' dey wouldn't lemme. I  got some things in dere I be'n havin' nigh onto a hunnert years. Got my  ol' blue-back Webster, onliest book I evah had, 'scusin' mah Bible.  Think I wanna th'ow dat away? No-o suh!    So dey black-list me, 'cause I won't kiss dey feets. I ain't kissin  _nobody's_, wouldn't kiss my own mammy's.    I nevah see my mammy. She put me in a hick'ry basket when I on'y a day  and a half old, with nuthin' on but mah belly band an' di'per. Took me  down in de cotton patch an' sot de basket on a stump in de bilin sun.  Didn't want me, 'cause I be black. All de otha youngins o' hers be  bright.    Gran'mammy done tol' me, many a time, how she heah me bawlin' an' go an'  git me, an' fotch me to mammy's house; but my own mammy, she say, tu'n  me down cold.    \"Dat you, Mammy\" she say, sweet as pie, when gran'mammy knock on de do'.    \"Dont you _nevah_ call me 'Mammy' no mo',\" gran'mammy tol' 'er. \"Any  woman what'd leave a po' li'l mite lak dat to perish to death ain't  fitten t' be no dotter o' mine.\"    So gran'mammy tuk me to raise, an' I ain't nevah wanted no mammy but  her. Nevah knowed who my daddy was, an' I reckon my mammy didn't know,  neithah. I bawn at Richard, Vahjinny. My sistah an' brothah be'n dead  too many years to count; I de las' o' de fam'ly.    I kin remember 'fore de fust war start. I had three chillen, boys,  taller'n me when freedom come. Mah fust mastah didn't make de li'l  chillen wuk none. All I done was play. W'en I be ol' enough t' wuk, dey  tuk us to Pelman, Jawjah. I never wukked in de fiel's none, not den. Dey  allus le me nuss de chillens.    Den I got married. Hit wa'nt no church weddin'; we got married in  gran'mammy's kitchen, den we go to our own log house. By an' by mah  mahster sol' me an' mah baby to de man what had de plantation nex' to  ours. His name was John Lee. He was good to me, an' let me see my  chillens.    I nevah got no beatin's. Onliest thing I evah got was a li'l slap on de  han', lak dat. Didn't hurt none. But I'se seen cullud men on de Bradley  plantation git tur'ble beatin's. De whippin' boss was Joe Sylvester, a  white man. He had pets mongst de wimmen folks, an' used t' let 'em off  easy, w'en dey desarved a good beatin'. Sometimes 'e jes' bop 'em crost  de ear wid a battlin' stick, or kick 'em in de beehind.    You don't know what's a battlin' stick? Well, dis here be one. You use  it fer washin' close. You lif's de close outa de wash pot wid dis here  battlin' stick; den you tote 'em to de battlin' block--dis here stump.  Den you beat de dirt out wid de battlin' stick.    De whippin' boss got pets 'mongst de mens, too, but dey got it a li'l  wusser'n de wimmens. Effen dey wan't _too_ mean, he jes' strap 'em  'crost de sharp side of a bar'l an' give 'em a few right smaht licks wid  a bull whip.    But dey be some niggahs he whip good an' hard. If dey sass back, er try  t' run away, he mek 'em cross dey han's lak dis; den he pull 'em up, so  dey toes jes' tetch de ground'; den he smack 'em crost de back an' rump  wid a big wood paddle, fixed full o' holes. Know what dem holes be for?  Ev'y hole mek a blister. Den he mek 'em lay down on de groun', whilst he  bus' all dem blisters wid a rawhide whip.    I nevah heard o' nobody dyin' f'm gittin' a beatin'. Some couldn't wuk  fer a day or so. Sometimes de whippin' boss th'ow salt brine on dey  backs, or smear on turpentine, to mek it well quicker.    I don't know, 'zackly, how old I is. Mebbe--wait a minute, I didn't show  you my pitcher what was in de paper. I cain't read, but somebody say dey  put down how old I is undah mah pitcher. Dar hit--don't dat say a  hunndrt an' nine? I reckon dat be right, seein' I had three growed-up  boys when freedom come.    Dey be on'y one sto' here when I come to Tampa. Hit b'long t' ol' man  Mugge. Dey be a big cotton patch where Plant City is now. I picked some  cotton dere, den I come to Tampa, an' atter a while I got a job nussin'  Mister Perry Wall's chillen. Cullud folks jes' mek out de bes' dey  could. Some of 'em lived in tents, till dey c'd cut logs an' build  houses wid stick-an'-dirt chimbleys.    Lotta folks ask me how I come to be called \"Mama Duck.\" Dat be jes' a  devil-ment o' mine. I named my own se'f dat. One day when I be 'bout  twelve year old, I come home an' say, \"Well, gran'mammy, here come yo'  li'l ducky home again.\" She hug me an' say, \"Bress mah li'l ducky.\" Den  she keep on callin' me dat, an' when I growed up, folks jes' put de  \"Mama\" on.    I reckon I a heap bettah off dem days as I is now. Allus had sumpin t'  eat an' a place t' stay. No sech thing ez gittin' on a black list dem  days. Mighty hard on a pusson ol' az me not t' git no rashuns an' not  have no reg'lar job.          FEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT  American Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)    Pearl Randolph, Field Worker  Madison, Florida  January 30, 1937    WILLIS DUKES      Born in Brooks County, Georgia, 83 years ago on February 24th,  Willie[TR:?] Dukes jovially declares that he is \"on the high road to  livin' a hund'ed years.\"    He was one of 40 slaves belonging to one John Dukes, who was only in  moderate circumstances. His parents were Amos and Mariah Dukes, both  born on this plantation, he thinks. As they were a healthy pair they  were required to work long hours in the fields, although the master was  not actually cruel to them.    On this plantation a variety of products was grown, cotton, corn,  potatoes, peas, rice and sugar cane. Nothing was thrown away and the  slaves had only coarse foods such as corn bread, collard greens, peas  and occasionally a little rice or white bread. Even the potatoes were  reserved for the white folk and \"house niggers.\"    As a child Willis was required to \"tote water and wood, help at milking  time and run errands.\" His clothing consisted of only a homespun shirt  that was made on the plantation. Nearly everything used was grown or  manufactured on the plantation. Candles were made in the big house by  the cook and a batch of slaves from the quarters, all of them being  required to bring fat and tallow that had been saved for this purpose.  These candles were for the use of the master and mistress, as the slaves  used fat lightwood torches for lighting purposes. Cotton was used for  making clothes, and it was spun and woven into cloth by the slave women,  then stored in the commisary for future use. Broggan shoes were made of  tanned leather held together by tacks made of maple wood. Lye soap was  made in large pots, cut into chunks and issued from the smoke house.  Potash was secured from the ashes of burnt oak wood and allowed to set  in a quantity of grease that had also been saved for the purpose, then  boiled into soap.    The cotton was gathered in bags of bear grass and deposited in baskets  woven with strips of white oak that had been dried in the sun.    Willis remembers the time when a slave on the plantation escaped and  went north to live. This man managed to communicate with his family  somehow, and it was whispered about that he was \"living very high\" and  actually saving money with which to buy his family. He was even going to  school. This fired all the slaves with an ambition to go north and this  made them more than usually interested in the outcome of the war between  the states. He was too young to fully understand the meaning of freedom  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12299"],[0,"The Mechanical Properties of Wood (#14)"],[1,"wood, because of the time in the life of the tree when it was  grown, may be inferior in hardness, strength, and toughness to  equally sound heartwood from the same log.    After exhaustive tests on a number of different woods the U.S.  Forest Service concludes as follows: \"Sapwood, except that from  old, overmature trees, is as strong as heartwood, other things  being equal, and so far as the mechanical properties go should  not be regarded as a defect.\"[22] Careful inspection of the  individual tests made in the investigation fails to reveal any  relation between the proportion of sapwood and the breaking  strength of timber.    [Footnote 22: Bul. 108: Tests of structural timber, p. 35.]    In the study of the hickories the conclusion was: \"There is an  unfounded prejudice against the heartwood. Specifications place  white hickory, or sapwood, in a higher grade than red hickory,  or heartwood, though there is no inherent difference in  strength. In fact, in the case of large and old hickory trees,  the sapwood nearest the bark is comparatively weak, and the best  wood is in the heart, though in young trees of thrifty growth  the best wood is in the sap.\"[23] The results of tests from  selected pieces lying side by side in the same tree, and also  the average values for heartwood and sapwood in shipments of the  commercial hickories without selection, show conclusively that  \"the transformation of sapwood into heartwood does not affect  either the strength or toughness of the wood.... It is true,  however, that sapwood is usually more free from latent defects  than heartwood.\"[24]    [Footnote 23: Bul. 80: The commercial hickories, p. 50.]    [Footnote 24: _Loc. cit._]    Specifications for paving blocks often require that longleaf  pine be 90 per cent heart. This is on the belief that sapwood is  not only more subject to decay, but is also weaker than  heartwood. In reality there is no sound basis for discrimination  against sapwood on account of strength, provided other  conditions are equal. It is true that sapwood will not resist  decay as long as heartwood, if both are untreated with  preservatives. It is especially so of woods with deep-colored  heartwood, and is due to infiltrations of tannins, oils, and  resins, which make the wood more or less obnoxious to  decay-producing fungi. If, however, the timbers are to be  treated, sapwood is not a defect; in fact, because of the  relative ease with which it can be impregnated with  preservatives it may be made more desirable than heartwood.[25]    [Footnote 25: Although the factor of heart or sapwood does not  influence the mechanical properties of the wood and there is  usually no difference in structure observable under the  microscope, nevertheless sapwood is generally decidedly  different from heartwood in its physical properties. It dries  better and more easily than heartwood, usually with less  shrinkage and little checking or honeycombing. This is  especially the case with the more refractory woods, such as  white oaks and _Eucalyptus globulus_ and _viminalis_. It is  usually much more permeable to air, even in green wood, notably  so in loblolly pine and even in white oak. As already stated, it  is much more subject to decay. The sapwood of white oak may be  impregnated with creosote with comparative ease, while the  heartwood is practically impenetrable. These facts indicate a  difference in its chemical nature.--H.D. Tiemann.]    In specifications for structural timbers reference is sometimes  made to \"boxheart,\" meaning the inclusion of the pith or centre  of the tree within a cross section of the timber. From numerous  experiments it appears that the position of the pith does not  bear any relation to the strength of the material. Since most  season checks, however, are radial, the position of the pith may  influence the resistance of a seasoned beam to horizontal shear,  being greatest when the pith is located in the middle half of  the section.[26]    [Footnote 26: Bul. 108, U.S. Forest Service, p. 36.]        WEIGHT, DENSITY, AND SPECIFIC GRAVITY      From data obtained from a large number of tests on the strength  of different woods it appears that, other things being equal,  the crushing strength parallel to the grain, fibre stress at  elastic limit in bending, and shearing strength along the grain  of wood vary in direct proportion to the weight of dry wood per  unit of volume when green. Other strength values follow  different laws. The hardness varies in a slightly greater ratio  than the square of the density. The work to the breaking point  increases even more rapidly than the cube of density. The  modulus of rupture in bending lies between the first power and  the square of the density. This, of course, is true only in case  the greater weight is due to increase in the amount of wood  substance. A wood heavy with resin or other infiltrated  substance is not necessarily stronger than a similar specimen  free from such materials. If differences in weight are due to  degree of seasoning, in other words, to the relative amounts of  water contained, the rules given above will of course not hold,  since strength increases with dryness. But of given specimens of  pine or of oak, for example, in the green condition, the  comparative strength may be inferred from the weight. It is not  permissible, however, to compare such widely different woods as  oak and pine on a basis of their weights.[27]    [Footnote 27: The oaks for some unknown reason fall below the  normal strength for weight, whereas the hickories rise above.  Certain other woods also are somewhat exceptional to the normal  relation of strength and density.]    The weight of wood substance, that is, the material which  composes the walls of the fibres and other cells, is practically  the same in all species, whether pine, hickory, or cottonwood,  being a little greater than half again as heavy as water. It  varies slightly from beech sapwood, 1.50, to Douglas fir  heartwood, 1.57, averaging about 1.55 at 30 deg. to 35 deg. C., in terms  of water at its greatest density 4 deg. C. The reason any wood  floats is that the air imprisoned in its cavities buoys it up.  When this is displaced by water the wood becomes water-logged  and sinks. Leaving out of consideration infiltrated substances,  the reason a cubic foot of one kind of dry wood is heavier than  that of another is because it contains a greater amount of wood  substance.  ~Density~ is merely the weight of a unit of volume,  as 35 pounds per cubic foot, or 0.56 grams per cubic centimetre.  ~Specific gravity~ or relative density is the ratio of the  density of any material to the density of distilled water at 4 deg.  C. (39.2 deg. F.). A cubic foot of distilled water at 4 deg. C. weighs  62.43 pounds. Hence the specific gravity of a piece of wood with  a density of 35 pounds is 35 / 62.43 = 0.561. To find the weight  per cubic foot when the specific gravity is given, simply  multiply by 62.43. Thus, 0.561 X 62.43 = 35. In the metric  system, since the weight of a cubic centimetre of pure water is  one gram, the density in grams per cubic centimetre has the same  numerical value as the specific gravity.    Since the amount of water in wood is extremely variable it  usually is not satisfactory to refer to the density of green  wood. For scientific purposes the density of \"oven-dry\" wood is  used; that is, the wood is dried in an oven at a temperature of  100 deg.C. (212 deg.F.) until a constant weight is attained. For  commercial purposes the weight or density of air-dry or  \"shipping-dry\" wood is used. This is usually expressed in pounds  per thousand board feet, a board foot being considered as  one-twelfth of a cubic foot.    Wood shrinks greatly in drying from the green to the oven-dry  condition. (See Table XIV.) Consequently a block of wood  measuring a cubic foot when green will measure considerably less  when oven-dry. It follows that the density of oven-dry wood does  not represent the weight of the dry wood substance in a cubic  foot of green wood. In other words, it is not the weight of a  cubic foot of green wood minus the weight of the water which it  contains. Since the latter is often a more convenient figure to  use and much easier to obtain than the weight of oven-dry wood,  it is commonly expressed in tables of \"specific gravity or  density of dry wood.\"    |----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  |                                 TABLE XIV                                  |  |----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  |            SPECIFIC GRAVITY, AND SHRINKAGE OF 51 AMERICAN WOODS            |  |                         (Forest Service Cir. 213)                          |  |----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  |                 |         |  Specific gravity  | Shrinkage from green to   |  |                 | Mois-   | oven-dry, based on | oven-dry condition        |  |   COMMON NAME   |  ture   |--------------------+---------------------------|  |   OF SPECIES    | content | Volume  |  Volume  | In     |        | Tangen- |  |                 |         |   when  |   when   | volume | Radial | tial    |  |                 |         |  green  | oven-dry |        |        |         |  |-----------------+---------+---------+----------+--------+--------+---------|  |                 |   Per   |         |          |  Per   |  Per   |   Per   |  |                 |   cent  |         |          |  cent  |  cent  |   cent  |  |                 |         |         |          |        |        |         |  |    Hardwoods    |         |         |          |        |        |         |  |                 |         |         |          |        |        |         |  | Ash, black      |     77  |  0.466  |          |        |        |         |  |   white         |     38  |   .550  |   0.640  |  12.6  |   4.3"]]]
