A border eleven inches wide  and a center ornament are worked out in diamonds. The pillow covers  are three feet by two feet six inches in size. For three years  the jewel merchants of India, and they are many, were searching  for the material for this extraordinary affair. It cost several  millions of dollars and was intended as a present for a Mohammedan  lady of doubtful reputation, who had fascinated His Highness.  The British Resident at his capital intervened and prohibited  the gift on the ground that the State of Baroda could not afford  to indulge its ruler in such generosity, and that the scandal  would reflect upon the administration of the Indian Empire. The  carpet still belongs to the State and may be seen by visitors  upon a permit from one of the higher authorities. It is kept at  Baroda in a safe place with the rest of the state jewels, which  are the richest in India and probably the most costly belonging  to any government in the world.    The regalia of the gaikwar intended for state occasions, which  was worn by him at the wedding, is valued at $15,000,000. He  appeared in it at the Delhi durbar in 1903. It consists of a  collar and shoulder pieces made of 500 diamonds, some of them as  large as walnuts. The smallest would be considered a treasure by  any lady in the land. The border of this collar is made of three  bands of emeralds, of graduated sizes, the outer row consisting  of jewels nearly an inch square. From the collar, as a pendant,  hangs one of the largest and most famous diamonds in the world,  known as the \"Star of the Deccan.\" Its history may be found in  any work on jewels. There is an aigrette to match the collar,  which His Highness wears in his turban.    This is only one of several sets to be found in the collection,  which altogether would make as brave a show as you can find at  Tiffany's. There are strings of pearls as large as marbles, and  a rope of pearls nearly four feet long braided of four strands.  Every pearl is said to be perfect and the size of a pea. The  rope is about an inch in diameter. Besides these are necklaces,  bracelets, brooches, rings and every conceivable ornament set  with jewels of every variety, which have been handed down from  generation to generation in this princely family for several  hundred years. One of the most interesting of the necklaces is  made of uncut rubies said to have been found in India. It has  been worn for more than a thousand years. These jewels are kept  in a treasure-room in the heart of the Nazar Bgah Palace, guarded  night and day by a battalion of soldiers. At night when the palace  is closed half a dozen huge cheetahs, savage beasts of the leopard  family, are released in the corridors, and, as you may imagine, they  are efficient watchmen. They would make a burglar very unhappy.  During the daytime they are allowed to wander about the palace  grounds, but are carefully muzzled.    Malhar Rao built a superb palace at a cost of $1,500,000 which  is considered the most perfect and beautiful example of the  Hindu-Saracenic order of architecture in existence, and its interior  finish and decoration are wonderful for their artistic beauty,  detail and variety. In front of the main entrance are two guns  of solid gold, weighing two hundred and eighty pounds each, and  the carriages, ammunition wagons and other accoutrements are made  of solid silver. The present Maharajah is said to have decided  to melt them down and have them coined into good money, with  which he desires to endow a technical school.    Behind the palace is a great walled arena in which previous rulers  of Baroda have had fights between elephants, tigers, lions and other  wild beasts for the amusement of their court and the population  generally. And they remind you of those we read about in the  Colosseum in the time of Nero and other Roman emperors. Baroda  has one of the finest zoological gardens in the world, but most of  the animals are native to India. It is surrounded by a botanical  garden, in which the late gaikwar, who was passionately fond of  plants and flowers, took a great deal of interest and spent a  great deal of money.    He built a temple at Dakar, a few miles from Baroda, which cost  an enormous sum of money, in honor of an ancient image of the Hindu  god, Krishna. It has been the resort of pilgrims for hundreds of  years, and is considered one of the most sacred idols of India.  In addition to the temple he constructed hospices for the shelter  and entertainment of pilgrims, who come nowadays in larger numbers  than ever, sometimes as many as a hundred thousand in a year, and  are all fed and cared for, furnished comfortable clothing and  medical attendance, bathed, healed and comforted at the expense  of His Highness, whose generosity and hospitality are not limited  to his own subjects. The throne of the idol Krishna in that temple  is a masterpiece of wood carving and bears $60,000 worth of gold  ornaments. Artists say that this temple, although entirely modern,  surpasses in the beauty of its detail, both in design and  workmanship, any of the old temples in India which people corne  thousands of miles to see.    Fate at last overtook the strange man who did all these things  and he came to grief. Indignant at Colonel Phayre, the British  Resident, for interfering with his wishes in regard to the pearl  carpet and some other little fancies, he attempted to poison  him in an imperial manner. He caused a lot of diamonds to be  ground up into powder and dropped into a cup of pomolo juice,  which he tried to induce his prudent adviser to drink. Ordinary  drug store poison was beneath him. When Malhar Rao committed a  crime he did it, as he did everything else, with royal splendor.  He had tried the same trick successfully upon his brother and  predecessor, Gaikwar Khande Rao, the man who built a beautiful  sailors' home at Bombay in 1870 to commemorate the visit of the  Duke of Edinburgh to India. Colonel Phayre suspected something  wrong, and declined to drink the toast His Highness offered. The  plot was soon afterward discovered and Viceroy Lord Northbrook,  who had tolerated his tyranny and fantastic performances as long  as possible, made an investigation and ordered him before a court  over which the chief justice of Bengal presided. The evidence  disclosed a most scandalous condition of affairs throughout the  entire province. Public offices were sold to the highest bidder;  demands for blackmail were enforced by torture; the wives and  daughters of his subjects were seized at his will and carried  to his palace whenever their beauty attracted his attention. The  condition of the people was desperate. In one district there was  open rebellion; discontent prevailed everywhere and the methods  of administration were infamous. It was shown that a previous  prime minister had been poisoned by direct orders of his chief  and that with his own hands the gaikwar had beaten one of his  own servants to death. Two Hindu judges of the court voted for  acquittal, but the remainder found him guilty. As the judgment  was not unanimous, Mahal Rao escaped the death penalty which he  deserved, and would have suffered but for the sympathy of his  judicial co-religionists. He was deposed and sent to prison,  and when an investigation of his finances was made, it was found  that during the last year of his reign he had wasted $3,500,000  in gifts to his favorites, in gratifying his whims and fancies,  and for personal pleasures. All of which was wrung from the people  by taxation.    After his conviction the widow of his brother and predecessor,  Khande Rao, whom he had poisoned, was allowed to exercise the  right of adoption, and her choice fell upon the present gaikwar,  then a lad of eleven, belonging to a collateral branch of the  family. He was provided with English tutors and afterward sent to  England to complete his education. He proved a brilliant scholar,  an industrious, earnest, practical man, and, as I have said,  Queen Victoria took a great personal interest in him. When he  came to the throne in 1874, he immediately applied himself with  energy and intelligence to the administration of the government  and surrounded himself with the best English advisers he could  get. Since his accession the condition of Baroda has entirely  changed and is in striking contrast with that which existed under  his predecessors. Many taxes have been abolished and more have  been reduced. Public works have been constructed everywhere;  schools, colleges, hospitals, asylums, markets, water works,  electric lighting plants, manufactories and sanitary improvements  have been introduced, competent courts have been established and  the province has become one of the most prosperous in India.    Baroda is called \"The Garden of India.\" It occupies a fine plain  with rich alluvial soil, well watered, and almost entirely under  cultivation. It produces luxurious crops of grain, cotton, sugar,  tobacco and other staples, and the greater part of them are turned  from raw material into the finished product in factories scattered  through the state. We were advised that Baroda is the best place  in India to study the native arts and fabrics. The manufacturing  is chiefly controlled by Parsees, descendants of Persian fugitives  who fled to India and settled in Baroda more than a thousand years  ago, and in their temple at Navasari, a thriving manufacturing  town, the sacred fire has been burning uninterruptedly for five  hundred years. The City of Baroda has about 125,000 population.  The principal streets are lined with houses of teakwood, whose  fronts are elaborately carved. Their like cannot be seen elsewhere.  The maharajah keeps up the elephant stables of his predecessor  in which are bred and kept the finest animals in India. He also  breeds the best oxen in the empire.

It is no objection against this doctrine to say, that when we feel our  sentiment of justice outraged, we are not thinking of society at large,  or of any collective interest, but only of the individual case. It is  common enough certainly, though the reverse of commendable, to feel  resentment merely because we have suffered pain; but a person whose  resentment is really a moral feeling, that is, who considers whether an  act is blameable before he allows himself to resent it--such a person,  though he may not say expressly to himself that he is standing up for  the interest of society, certainly does feel that he is asserting a rule  which is for the benefit of others as well as for his own. If he is not  feeling this--if he is regarding the act solely as it affects him  individually--he is not consciously just; he is not concerning himself  about the justice of his actions. This is admitted even by  anti-utilitarian moralists. When Kant (as before remarked) propounds as  the fundamental principle of morals, 'So act, that thy rule of conduct  might be adopted as a law by all rational beings,' he virtually  acknowledges that the interest of mankind collectively, or at least of  mankind indiscriminately, must be in the mind of the agent when  conscientiously deciding on the morality of the act. Otherwise he uses  words without a meaning: for, that a rule even of utter selfishness  could not _possibly_ be adopted by all rational beings--that there is  any insuperable obstacle in the nature of things to its adoption--cannot  be even plausibly maintained. To give any meaning to Kant's principle,  the sense put upon it must be, that we ought to shape our conduct by a  rule which all rational beings might adopt _with benefit to their  collective interest_.    To recapitulate: the idea of justice supposes two things; a rule of  conduct, and a sentiment which sanctions the rule. The first must be  supposed common to all mankind, and intended for their good. The other  (the sentiment) is a desire that punishment may be suffered by those who  infringe the rule. There is involved, in addition, the conception of  some definite person who suffers by the infringement; whose rights (to  use the expression appropriated to the case) are violated by it. And the  sentiment of justice appears to me to be, the animal desire to repel or  retaliate a hurt or damage to oneself, or to those with whom one  sympathizes, widened so as to include all persons, by the human capacity  of enlarged sympathy, and the human conception of intelligent  self-interest. From the latter elements, the feeling derives its  morality; from the former, its peculiar impressiveness, and energy of  self-assertion.    I have, throughout, treated the idea of a _right_ residing in the  injured person, and violated by the injury, not as a separate element in  the composition of the idea and sentiment, but as one of the forms in  which the other two elements clothe themselves. These elements are, a  hurt to some assignable person or persons on the one hand, and a demand  for punishment on the other. An examination of our own minds, I think,  will show, that these two things include all that we mean when we speak  of violation of a right. When we call anything a person's right, we mean  that he has a valid claim on society to protect him in the possession  of it, either by the force of law, or by that of education and opinion.  If he has what we consider a sufficient claim, on whatever account, to  have something guaranteed to him by society, we say that he has a right  to it. If we desire to prove that anything does not belong to him by  right, we think this done as soon as it is admitted that society ought  not to take measures for securing it to him, but should leave it to  chance, or to his own exertions. Thus, a person is said to have a right  to what he can earn in fair professional competition; because society  ought not to allow any other person to hinder him from endeavouring to  earn in that manner as much as he can. But he has not a right to three  hundred a-year, though he may happen to be earning it; because society  is not called on to provide that he shall earn that sum. On the  contrary, if he owns ten thousand pounds three per cent. stock, he _has_  a right to three hundred a-year; because society has come under an  obligation to provide him with an income of that amount.    To have a right, then, is, I conceive, to have something which society  ought to defend me in the possession of. If the objector goes on to ask  why it ought, I can give him no other reason than general utility. If  that expression does not seem to convey a sufficient feeling of the  strength of the obligation, nor to account for the peculiar energy of  the feeling, it is because there goes to the composition of the  sentiment, not a rational only but also an animal element, the thirst  for retaliation; and this thirst derives its intensity, as well as its  moral justification, from the extraordinarily important and impressive  kind of utility which is concerned. The interest involved is that of  security, to every one's feelings the most vital of all interests.  Nearly all other earthly benefits are needed by one person, not needed  by another; and many of them can, if necessary, be cheerfully foregone,  or replaced by something else; but security no human being can possibly  do without; on it we depend for all our immunity from evil, and for the  whole value of all and every good, beyond the passing moment; since  nothing but the gratification of the instant could be of any worth to  us, if we could be deprived of everything the next instant by whoever  was momentarily stronger than ourselves. Now this most indispensable of  all necessaries, after physical nutriment, cannot be had, unless the  machinery for providing it is kept unintermittedly in active play. Our  notion, therefore, of the claim we have on our fellow creatures to join  in making safe for us the very groundwork of our existence, gathers  feelings round it so much more intense than those concerned in any of  the more common cases of utility, that the difference in degree (as is  often the case in psychology) becomes a real difference in kind. The  claim assumes that character of absoluteness, that apparent infinity,  and incommensurability with all other considerations, which constitute  the distinction between the feeling of right and wrong and that of  ordinary expediency and inexpediency. The feelings concerned are so  powerful, and we count so positively on finding a responsive feeling in  others (all being alike interested), that _ought_ and _should_ grow into  _must_, and recognized indispensability becomes a moral necessity,  analogous to physical, and often not inferior to it in binding force.    If the preceding analysis, or something resembling it, be not the  correct account of the notion of justice; if justice be totally  independent of utility, and be a standard _per se_, which the mind can  recognize by simple introspection of itself; it is hard to understand  why that internal oracle is so ambiguous, and why so many things appear  either just or unjust, according to the light in which they are  regarded. We are continually informed that Utility is an uncertain  standard, which every different person interprets differently, and that  there is no safety but in the immutable, ineffaceable, and unmistakeable  dictates of Justice, which carry their evidence in themselves, and are  independent of the fluctuations of opinion. One would suppose from this  that on questions of justice there could be no controversy; that if we  take that for our rule, its application to any given case could leave us  in as little doubt as a mathematical demonstration. So far is this from  being the fact, that there is as much difference of opinion, and as  fierce discussion, about what is just, as about what is useful to  society. Not only have different nations and individuals different  notions of justice, but, in the mind of one and the same individual,  justice is not some one rule, principle, or maxim, but many, which do  not always coincide in their dictates, and in choosing between which, he  is guided either by some extraneous standard, or by his own personal  predilections.    For instance, there are some who say, that it is unjust to punish any  one for the sake of example to others; that punishment is just, only  when intended for the good of the sufferer himself. Others maintain the  extreme reverse, contending that to punish persons who have attained  years of discretion, for their own benefit, is despotism and injustice,  since if the matter at issue is solely their own good, no one has a  right to control their own judgment of it; but that they may justly be  punished to prevent evil to others, this being an exercise of the  legitimate right of self-defence. Mr. Owen, again, affirms that it is  unjust to punish at all; for the criminal did not make his own  character; his education, and the circumstances which surround him, have  made him a criminal, and for these he is not responsible. All these  opinions are extremely plausible; and so long as the question is argued  as one of justice simply, without going down to the principles which lie  under justice and are the source of its authority, I am unable to see  how any of these reasoners can be refuted. For, in truth, every one of  the three builds upon rules of justice confessedly true. The first  appeals to the acknowledged injustice of singling out an individual, and  making him a sacrifice,"]]]
