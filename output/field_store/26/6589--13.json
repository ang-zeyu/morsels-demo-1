Cuba was early in the field with a railway. In 1830, the United States  had only thirty-two miles of line, the beginning of its present enormous  system. Cuba's first railway was opened to traffic in November, 1837. It  was a forty-five mile line connecting Havana with the town of Guines,  southeast of the city. While official permission was, of course, necessary  before the work could be undertaken, it was in fact a Cuban enterprise, due  to the activity of the _Junta de Fomento_, or Society for Improvement. It  was built with capital obtained in London, the construction being in charge  of Mr. Alfred Cruger, an American engineer. Ten years later there were  nearly three hundred miles of line. At the beginning of the American  occupation, in 1899, there were about nine-hundred and fifty miles. There  are now more than 2,000 miles of public service line in operation, and in  addition there are many hundreds of miles of private lines on the sugar  estates. Several cities have trolley lines. For some years after the  American occupation, as before that experience, there was only a  water-and-rail connection, or an all-water route, between the eastern and  western sections of the island. The usual route from Havana to Santiago  was by rail to Batabano or to Cienfuegos, and thence by steamer. The  alternative was an all-water route, consuming several days, by steamer  along the north coast, with halts at different ports, and around the  eastern end of the island to the destination. It is now an all-rail run of  twenty-four hours. The project for a \"spinal railway\" from one end of  the island to the other had been under consideration for many years. The  configuration lent itself excellently to such a system, and not at all  well to any other. A railway map of such a system shows a line, generally,  through the middle of the island along its length, with numerous branch  lines running north and south to the various cities and ports on the coast.  The plan, broadly, is being carried out. A combination of existing lines  afforded a route to the city of Santa Clara. From these eastward, the Cuba  Company, commonly known as the Van Home road, completed a through line in  1902. In its beginning, it was a highly ambitious scheme, involving the  building of many towns along the way, the erection of many sugar mills, and  the creation of a commercial city, at Nipe Bay, that would leave Havana in  the back-number class. All that called for a sum of money not then and not  now available. But the \"spinal railroad\" was built, and from it a number of  radiating lines have been built, to Sancti Spiritus, Manzanillo, Nipe  Bay, and to Guantanamo. About the only places on the island, really worth  seeing, with the exception of Trinidad and Baracoa, can now be reached by a  fairly comfortable railway journey.    [Illustration: THE VOLANTE _Now quite rare_]    In most of the larger cities of the island, a half dozen or so of them, the  traveller is made fairly comfortable and is almost invariably well fed. But  any question of physical comfort in hotels, more particularly in country  hotels, raises a question of standards. As Touchstone remarked, when in the  forest of Arden, \"Travellers must be content.\" Those who are not ready to  make themselves so, no matter what the surroundings, should stay at home,  which, Touchstone also remarked, \"is a better place.\" If the standard is  the ostentatious structure of the larger cities of this country, with its  elaborate menu and its systematized service, there will doubtless be cause  for complaint. So will there be if the standard is the quiet, cleanly inn  of many towns in this country and in parts of Europe. The larger towns and  villages of the island have a _posada_ in which food and lodging may be  obtained; the smaller places may or may not have \"a place to stay.\" Cuba  is not a land in which commercial travellers swarm everywhere, demanding  comfort and willing to pay a reasonable price for it. However, few  travellers and fewer tourists have any inclination to depart from known  and beaten paths, or any reason for doing so. Nor does a fairly thorough  inspection of the island necessitate any halting in out-of-the-way places  where there is not even an imitation of an inn. All that one needs to see,  and all that most care to see, can be seen in little tours, for a day, from  the larger cities. Yet if one wants to wander a little in the by-paths, it  is easy enough to do so.    What one sees or does in Cuba will depend mainly upon the purpose of the  visit, and upon the violence of the individual mania for seeing as many  places as possible. If the object is merely an excursion or an escape from  the rigors of a northern winter, there is no occasion for wandering out of  sight of the capital city. There is more to see and more to do in Havana  than there is in all the rest of the island. Nor is there much to be seen  elsewhere that cannot be seen in the immediate vicinity of that city. This,  of course, does not cover the matter of scenery. There are no mountains,  no forest jungles in that neighborhood, but forests in Cuba are not  particularly interesting, and even the mountains of Oriente are no more  beautiful or majestic than are our own summits, our own White Hills of New  Hampshire, the Adirondacks, the Blue Ridge, the Alleghenies, the Rockies,  and the Sierras. The charm of Cuba, and it is extremely charming, is not  its special \"points of interest.\" It is rather a general impression, a  combination of soft and genial climate with varying lights and shades and  colors. Even after much experience there, I am not yet quite ready either  to admit or to deny that the island, taken as a whole, is either beautiful  or picturesque, and yet there is much of both. Attention is rarely  challenged by the sublime or the majestic, but is often arrested by  some play of light and shade. Cuban villages, with few exceptions, are  unattractive, although there is not infrequently some particular building,  usually a church, that calls for a second look or a careful examination.  Most of these little communities consist of a row of low and ungraceful  structures bordering the highway. They are usually extended by building on  at the ends. If the town street gets undesirably long, a second street or a  third will be made, on one or both sides of the main street, and thus the  town acquires breadth as well as length. The houses are built immediately  upon the roadside, and sidewalks are quite unusual. Nor, until the place  becomes a large town or a small city, is there, in most cases, any attempt  at decoration by means of shade trees. A tree may be left if there happened  to be one when the village was born, but rarely do the inhabitants turn  their streets into tree-shaded avenues. There would be an excellent  opportunity for the activities of Village Improvement Societies in Cuba, if  it were not for the fact that such tree-planting would involve pushing all  the houses ten or fifteen feet back from the roadside.    I have never studied the system of town building in the island, yet it is  presumable that there was some such system. In the larger places, there is  usually a central park around which are arranged the church, the public  buildings, and the stores. Whether these were so constructed from an  original plan, or whether they are an evolution, along a general plan, from  the long, single street, I do not know. I am inclined to believe that the  former was the case, and that it followed the location of a church. The  custom is, of course, of Spanish origin, and is common throughout the  greater part of Latin America. It finds a fair parallel in our own country  custom, by no means infrequent, of an open \"green\" or common in front  of the village church and the town hall. Tree-setting along the Cuban  highways, more particularly in the neighborhood of the cities, is not at  all unusual, and some of these shaded roads are exceedingly charming. Some  are entirely over-arched by laurel trees and the gorgeous _flamboyan_,  making long tunnels of shade \"through whose broken roof the sky looks in.\"  Evidently the Spanish authorities were too much interested in making money  and enjoying themselves in the cities to care very much for what happened  to the Cubans in the villages, as long as they paid the money that filled  the official pocket and paid for the official entertainment, and the Cubans  were too busy getting that money to have much time for village improvement.  The Spaniards, following their home custom, might decorate a military  highway to some extent, but the rough trail over which the peasant carried  his little crop did not concern them. That was quite the business of the  peasant who had neither the time nor money to do anything about it.    The question of good roads in Cuba is very much what it is in this country.  Cuba needs more good roads than its people can afford to build; so does the  United States. At the time of the American occupation, in 1899, there were  only 160 miles of improved highway in the entire island. Of this, 85 miles  were in Havana Province, and 75 miles in Pinar del Rio. The remainder of  the island had none. Some work was done during the First Intervention  and more was done under the Palma government. At the time of the Second  Intervention, there were about 380 miles. That is, the United States and  the Cuban Republic built, in six years, nearly 40 per cent, more highway  than the Spanish authorities built in four hundred years. During the Palma  regime, plans were drawn for an extensive road system, to be carried out  as rapidly as the financial resources permitted.

It  is also to be observed the dog did not stay to eat what he took upon the  spot, in which case some pieces or bones or fragments might be left, and  so it might be discovered to be a dog; but he made cleaner work, and when  he fastened upon a piece of meat he was sure to carry it quite away to  such retreats as he knew he could be safe in, and so feast upon it at  leisure.    It happened at last, as with most thieves it does, that the inn-keeper  was too cunning for him, and the poor dog was nabbed, taken in the fact,  and could make no defence.    Having found the thief and got him in custody, the master of the house, a  good-humoured fellow, and loth to disoblige the dog's master by executing  the criminal, as the dog law directs, mitigates his sentence, and handled  him as follows:--First, taking out his knife, he cut off both his ears;  and then, bringing him to the threshold, he chopped off his tail.  And  having thus effectually dishonoured the poor cur among his neighbours, he  tied a string about his neck, and a piece of paper to the string,  directed to his master, and with these witty West Country verses on it:--          \"To my honoured master, --- Esq.     \"Hail master a cham a' com hoam,     So cut as an ape, and tail have I noan,     For stealing of beef and pork out of the pail,     For thease they'v cut my ears, for th' wother my tail;     Nea measter, and us tell thee more nor that     And's come there again, my brains will be flat.\"    I could give many more accounts of the different dialects of the people  of this country, in some of which they are really not to be understood;  but the particulars have little or no diversion in them.  They carry it  such a length that we see their \"jouring\" speech even upon their  monuments and grave-stones; as, for example, even in some of the  churchyards of the city of Bristol I saw this excellent poetry after some  other lines:--       \"And when that thou doest hear of thick,     Think of the glass that runneth quick.\"    But I proceed into Devonshire.  From Yeovil we came to Crookorn, thence  to Chard, and from thence into the same road I was in before at Honiton.    This is a large and beautiful market-town, very populous and well built,  and is so very remarkably paved with small pebbles that on either side  the way a little channel is left shouldered up on the sides of it, so  that it holds a small stream of fine clear running water, with a little  square dipping-place left at every door; so that every family in the town  has a clear, clean running river (as it may be called) just at their own  door, and this so much finer, so much pleasanter, and agreeable to look  on than that at Salisbury (which they boast so much of), that, in my  opinion, there is no comparison.    Here we see the first of the great serge manufacture of Devonshire--a  trade too great to be described in miniature, as it must be if I  undertake it here, and which takes up this whole county, which is the  largest and most populous in England, Yorkshire excepted (which ought to  be esteemed three counties, and is, indeed, divided as such into the  East, West, and North Riding).  But Devonshire, one entire county, is so  full of great towns, and those towns so full of people, and those people  so universally employed in trade and manufactures, that not only it  cannot be equalled in England, but perhaps not in Europe.    In my travel through Dorsetshire I ought to have observed that the  biggest towns in that county sent no members to Parliament, and that the  smallest did--that is to say that Sherborne, Blandford, Wimborneminster,  Stourminster, and several other towns choose no members; whereas  Weymouth, Melcombe, and Bridport were all burgess towns.  But now we come  to Devonshire we find almost all the great towns, and some smaller,  choosing members also.  It is true there are some large populous towns  that do not choose, but then there are so many that do, that the county  seems to have no injustice, for they send up six-and-twenty members.    However, as I say above, there are several great towns which do not  choose Parliament men, of which Bideford is one, Crediton or Kirton  another, Ilfracombe a third; but, those excepted, the principal towns in  the county do all choose members of Parliament.    Honiton is one of those, and may pass not only for a pleasant good town,  as before, but stands in the best and pleasantest part of the whole  county, and I cannot but recommend it to any gentlemen that travel this  road, that if they please to observe the prospect for half a mile till  their coming down the hill and to the entrance into Honiton, the view of  the country is the most beautiful landscape in the world--a mere  picture--and I do not remember the like in any one place in England.  It  is observable that the market of this town was kept originally on the  Sunday, till it was changed by the direction of King John.    From Honiton the country is exceeding pleasant still, and on the road  they have a beautiful prospect almost all the way to Exeter (which is  twelve miles).  On the left-hand of this road lies that part of the  county which they call the South Hams, and which is famous for the best  cider in that part of England; also the town of St.-Mary-Ottery, commonly  called St. Mary Autree.  They tell us the name is derived from the River  Ottery, and that from the multitude of otters found always in that river,  which however, to me, seems fabulous.  Nor does there appear to be any  such great number of otters in that water, or in the county about, more  than is usual in other counties or in other parts of the county about  them.  They tell us they send twenty thousand hogsheads of cider hence  every year to London, and (which is still worse) that it is most of it  bought there by the merchants to mix with their wines--which, if true, is  not much to the reputation of the London vintners.  But that by-the-bye.    From hence we came to Exeter, a city famous for two things which we  seldom find unite in the same town--viz., that it is full of gentry and  good company, and yet full of trade and manufactures also.  The serge  market held here every week is very well worth a stranger's seeing, and  next to the Brigg Market at Leeds, in Yorkshire, is the greatest in  England.  The people assured me that at this market is generally sold  from sixty to seventy to eighty, and sometimes a hundred, thousand pounds  value in serges in a week.  I think it is kept on Mondays.    They have the River Esk here, a very considerable river, and principal in  the whole county; and within three miles, or thereabouts, it receives  ships of any ordinary burthen, the port there being called Topsham.  But  now by the application, and at the expense, of the citizens the channel  of the river is so widened, deepened, and cleansed from the shoal, which  would otherwise interrupt the navigation, that the ships come now quite  up to the city, and there with ease both deliver and take in their  lading.    This city drives a very great correspondence with Holland, as also  directly to Portugal, Spain, and Italy--shipping off vast quantities of  their woollen manufactures especially to Holland, the Dutch giving very  large commissions here for the buying of serges perpetuans, and such  goods; which are made not only in and about Exeter, but at Crediton,  Honiton, Culliton, St.-Mary-Ottery, Newton Bushel, Ashburton, and  especially at Tiverton, Cullompton, Bampton, and all the north-east part  of the county--which part of the county is, as it may be said, fully  employed, the people made rich, and the poor that are properly so called  well subsisted and employed by it.    Exeter is a large, rich, beautiful, populous, and was once a very strong  city; but as to the last, as the castle, the walls, and all the old works  are demolished, so, were they standing, the way of managing sieges and  attacks of towns is such now, and so altered from what it was in those  days, that Exeter in the utmost strength it could ever boast would not  now hold out five days open trenches--nay, would hardly put an army to  the trouble of opening trenches against it at all.  This city was famous  in the late civil unnatural war for its loyalty to the king, and for  being a sanctuary to the queen, where her Majesty resided for some time,  and here she was delivered of a daughter, being the Princess Henrietta  Maria, of whom our histories give a particular account, so I need say no  more of it here.    The cathedral church of this city is an ancient beauty, or, as it may be  said, it is beautiful for its antiquity; but it has been so fully and  often described that it would look like a mere copying from others to  mention it.  There is a good library kept in it, in which are some  manuscripts, and particularly an old missal or mass-book, the leaves of  vellum, and famous for its most exquisite writing.    This county, and this part of it in particular, has been famous for the  birth of several eminent men as well for learning as for arts and for  war, as particularly:--    1.  Sir William Petre, who the learned Dr. Wake (now Archbishop of  Canterbury, and author of the Additions to Mr. Camden) says was Secretary  of State and Privy Councillor to King Henry VIII., Edward VI., Queen  Mary, and Queen Elizabeth, and seven times sent ambassador into foreign  countries.    2.  Sir Thomas Bodley, famous and of grateful memory to all learned men  and lovers of letters for his collecting and establishing the best  library in Britain, which is now at Oxford, and is called, after his  name, the Bodleian Library to this day.    3.  Also Sir Francis Drake, born at Plymouth.    4.  Sir Walter Raleigh.  Of both those I need say nothing; fame publishes  their merit upon every mention of their names.    5.  That great patron of learning, Richard Hooker, author of "]]]
