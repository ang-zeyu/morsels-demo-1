From that time I did not hear any more of Crossbills in the Islands till  December, 1876, when Mr. Couch sent me a skin of one in reddish plumage,  writing at the same time to say--\"The Crossbill I sent from its being  so late in the season when it was shot--the 11th of December; there were  four of them in a tree by Haviland Hall. I happened to go into the  person's house who shot it, and his children had it playing with.\"    I do not know that there is any evidence of the Crossbill ever having  bred in the Islands, though it seems to have made its appearance there  at almost all times of year. Mr. MacCulloch mentions its feeding on the  apple-pips, and doing damage in the orchards accordingly, and I know it  is generally supposed to do so, and has in some places got the name of  \"Shell Apple\" in consequence, but though I have several times kept  Crossbills tame, and frequently tried to indulge them with apples and  pips, I have never found them care much about them; and a note of  Professor Newton's, in his edition of 'Yarrell,' seems to agree with  this. He says:--\"Of late it has not been often observed feeding on  apples, very possibly owing to the greatly-increased growth of firs, and  especially larches, throughout the country. In Germany it does not seem  ever to have been known as attacking fruit-trees.\"    The Crossbill is included in Professor Ansted's list, and only marked as  occurring in Guernsey and Sark. There is no specimen in the Museum.      73. COMMON STARLING. _Sturnus vulgaris_, Linnaeus. French, \"Etourneau  vulgaire.\"--The Starling is sometimes very numerous in the autumn, but  those remaining throughout the year and breeding in the Island are  certainly very few in number, as I have never seen the Starling in any  of my summer visits; and Mr. MacCulloch tells me \"the Starling may  possibly still breed here, but it certainly is not common in summer. A  century ago it used to nest in the garrets in the heart of the town.\" As  to its not being common in summer, that quite agrees with my own  experience, but a few certainly do breed in the Island still, or did so  within a very few years, as Miss C.B. Carey had eggs in her collection  taken in the Island in 1873 or 1874, and I have seen eggs in other  Guernsey collections, besides those in the Museum. When I was in  Guernsey in November, 1871, Starlings were certainly unusually  plentiful, even for the autumn, very large flocks making their  appearance in all parts of the Island, and in the evening very large  flocks might be seen flying and wheeling about in all directions before  going to roost. Many of these flocks I saw fly off in the direction of  Jersey and the French coast, and they certainly continued their flight  in that direction as long as I could follow them with my glass, but  whether they were only going to seek a roosting-place and to return in  the morning, or whether they continued their migration and their place  was supplied by other flocks during the night, I could not tell, but  certainly there never seemed to be any diminution in their numbers  during the whole time I was there from the 1st to the 16th of November.  I think it not at all improbable that many of these flocks only roosted  out of the Island and returned, as even here in Somerset they collect in  large flocks before going to roost, and fly long distances, sometimes  quite over the Quantock Hills, to some favourite roosting-place they  have selected, and return in the morning, and the distance would in many  places be nearly as great. These flocks of Starlings seem to have  continued in the Island quite into the winter, as Miss Carey notes, in  the 'Zoologist' for 1872, seeing a flock in the field before the house  at Candie close to the town as late as the 6th of December, 1871. At the  same time that there were so many in Guernsey, Starlings were reported  as unusually numerous in Alderney, but how long the migratory flocks  remained there I have not been able to ascertain.    The Starling is included in Professor Ansted's list, but marked as only  occurring in Guernsey and Sark. There are two specimens in the Museum  and some eggs.      74. CHOUGH. _Pyrrhocorax graculus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Crave.\"--The  Chough is a common resident in Guernsey, breeding amongst the high rocks  on the south and east part of the Island, and in the autumn and winter  spreading over the cultivated parts of the Island, sometimes in  considerable flocks, like Rooks.    As Jackdaws are by no means numerous in Guernsey, and as far as I have  been able to make out never breed there, the Choughs have it all their  own way, and quite keep up their numbers, even if they do not increase  them, which I think very doubtful, though I can see no reason why they  should not, as their eggs are always laid in holes in the cliffs, and  very difficult to get at, and at other times of year the birds are very  wary, and take good care of themselves, it being by no means easy to get  a shot at them, unless by stalking them up behind a hedge or rock; and  as they are not good eating, and will not sell in the market like  Fieldfares and Redwings, no Guernsey man thinks of expending powder and  shot on them; so though not included in the Guernsey Bird Act, the  Choughs on the whole have an easy time of it in Guernsey, and ought to  increase in numbers more than they apparently do. In Sark the Choughs  have by no means so easy a time, as the Jackdaws outnumber them about  the cliffs, and will probably eventually drive them out of the  Island--indeed, I am afraid they have done this in Alderney, as I did  not see any when there in the summer of 1876, nor in this last summer  (1878); and Captain Hubbach writes me word he has seen none in Alderney  himself this year (1878). I, however, saw some there in previous  visits, but now for some reason, probably the increase of Jackdaws, the  Choughs appear to me nearly, if not quite, to have deserted that Island.  In Herm and Jethou there are also a few Choughs, but Jackdaws are the  more numerous in both Islands. No Choughs appear to inhabit the small  rocky islets to the northward of Herm, though some of them appear to be  large enough to afford a breeding-place for either Choughs or Jackdaws,  but neither of these birds seem to have taken possession of them;  probably want of food is the occasion of this. Mr. Metivier, in his  'Rimes Guernseaise,' gives \"Cahouette\" as the local Guernsey-French name  of the Chough, though I suspect the name is equally applicable to the  Jackdaw.    The Chough is mentioned in Professor Ansted's list, but marked as only  occurring in Guernsey and Sark. There are two specimens in the Museum.      75. JACKDAW. _Corvus monedula_, Linnaeus. French, \"Choucas,\" \"Choucas  gris.\"--I am quite aware that many Guernsey people will tell you that  there are no Jackdaws in Guernsey, but that their place is entirely  taken by Choughs. Mr. MacCulloch seems to be nearly of this opinion, as  he writes me--\"I suppose you are right in saying there are a few  Jackdaws in Guernsey, but I do not remember ever to have seen one here;\"  and he adds--\"I believe they are common in Alderney,\" which is  certainly the case; as I said above, they have almost, if not quite,  supplanted the Choughs there. There are, however, certainly a few  Jackdaws in Guernsey, as I have seen them there on several occasions,  but I cannot say that any breed there, and I think they are only  occasional wanderers from the other Islands, Sark, Jethou, and Herm,  where they do breed. Mr. Gallienne's note to Professor Ansted's list  seems to agree very much with this, as he says--\"The Jackdaw, which is  a regular visitor to Alderney, is rarely seen in Guernsey.\" It is now,  however, resident in Alderney, as well as in Sark, Jethou, and Herm.    It is mentioned in Professor Ansted's list, but only marked as occurring  in Guernsey and Sark, nothing being said about Alderney and the other  Islands in spite of Mr. Gallienne's note. There is no specimen at  present in the Museum.      76. RAVEN. _Corvus corax_, Linnaeus. French, \"Corbeau,\" \"Corbeau  noir.\"--The Raven can now only be looked upon as an occasional  straggler. I do not think it breeds at present in any of the Islands, as  I have not seen it anywhere about in the breeding-season since 1866,  when I saw a pair near the cliffs on the south-end of the Island in  June; but as the Raven is a very early breeder, these may have only been  wanderers. It is probably getting scarcer in Guernsey, as I have not  seen any there since; and the last note I have of Ravens being seen in  the Island is in a letter from Mr. Couch, who wrote me word that two  Ravens had been seen and shot at several times, but not obtained, in  November, 1873. I have not seen a Raven in any of the other Islands, and  do not know of one having occurred there.    Professor Ansted includes it in his list, and marks it as only occurring  in Guernsey. There is no specimen at present in the Museum.      77. CROW. _Corvus corone_, Linnaeus. French, \"Corneille noire.\"--The  Crow is pretty common, and breeds in most of the Islands, and probably  at times commits considerable depredations amongst the eggs and young of  the Gulls and Shags--at all events it is by no means a welcome visitor  to the breeding stations of the Gulls, as in this summer (1878) I saw  four Crows about a small gullery near Petit Bo Bay, one of which flew  over the side of the cliff to have a look at the Gulls' eggs, probably  with ulterior intentions in regard to the eggs; but one of the Gulls saw  him, and immediately flew at him and knocked him over: what the end of  the fight was I could not tell, but probably the Crow got the worst of  it, as several other Gulls went off to join their companion as soon as  they heard the row; and the Crows trespassed no more on the domain of  the Gulls--at least"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14474"],[0,"The Chemical History of a Candle (#14)"],[1,"sure we have made our experiment correctly.    [Illustration: Fig. 26.]    It is balanced; so, you see, we can find out the weight of the extra  volumes of air forced in, in that way, and by that means we are able to  ascertain that a cubic foot of air weighs 1-1/5 ounce. But that small  experiment will by no means convey to your mind the whole literal truth of  this matter. It is wonderful how it accumulates when you come to larger  volumes. This bulk of air [a cubic foot] weighs 1-1/5 ounce. What do you  think of the contents of that box above there, which I have had made for  the purpose? The air which is within that box weighs one pound--a full  pound; and I have calculated the weight of the air in this room,--you  would hardly imagine it, but it is above a ton. So rapidly do the weights  rise up, and so important is the presence of the atmosphere, and of the  oxygen and the nitrogen in it, and the use it performs in conveying things  to and fro from place to place, and carrying bad vapours to places where  they will do good instead of harm.    Having given you that little illustration with respect to the weight of  the air, let me shew you certain consequences of it. You have a right to  them, because you would not understand so much without it. Do you remember  this kind of experiment? Have you ever seen it? Suppose I take a pump  somewhat similar to the one I had a little while ago to force air into the  bottle, and suppose I place it in such a manner that by certain  arrangements I can apply my hand to it: my hand moves about in the air so  easily that it seems to feel nothing, and I can hardly get velocity enough  by any motion of my own in the atmosphere to make sure that there is much  resistance to it.    [Illustration: Fig. 27.]    But, when I put my hand here [on the air-pump receiver, which was  afterwards exhausted], you see what happens. Why is my hand fastened to  this place, and why am I able to pull this pump about? And see! how is it  that I can hardly get my hand away? Why is this? It is the weight of the  air--the weight of the air that is above. I have another experiment here,  which I think will explain to you more about it. When the air is pumped  from underneath the bladder which is stretched over this glass, you will  see the effect in another shape: the top is quite flat at present, but I  will make a very little motion with the pump, and now look at it--see how  it has gone down, see how it is bent in. You will see the bladder go in  more and more, until at last I expect it will be driven in and broken by  the force of the atmosphere pressing upon it.    [Illustration: Fig. 28.]    [The bladder at last broke with a loud report.] Now, that was done  entirely by the weight of the air pressing on it, and you can easily  understand how that is. The particles that are piled up in the atmosphere  stand upon each other, as these five cubes do. You can easily conceive  that four of these five cubes are resting upon the bottom one, and if I  take that away, the others will all sink down. So it is with the  atmosphere: the air that is above is sustained by the air that is beneath;  and when the air is pumped away from beneath them, the change occurs which  you saw when I placed my hand on the air-pump, and which you saw in the  case of the bladder, and which you shall see better here. I have tied over  this jar a piece of sheet india-rubber, and I am now about to take away  the air from the inside of the jar; and if you will watch the  india-rubber--which acts as a partition between the air below and the air  above--you will see, when I pump, how the pressure shews itself. See where  it is going to--I can actually put my hand into the jar; and yet this  result is only caused by the great and powerful action of the air above.  How beautifully it shews this curious circumstance!    Here is something that you can have a pull at, when I have finished  to-day. It is a little apparatus of two hollow brass hemispheres, closely  fitted together, and having connected with it a pipe and a cock, through  which we can exhaust the air from the inside; and although the two halves  are so easily taken apart, while the air is left within, yet you will see,  when we exhaust it by-and-by, no power of any two of you will be able to  pull them apart. Every square inch of surface that is contained in the  area of that vessel sustains fifteen pounds by weight, or nearly so, when  the air is taken out; and you may try your strength presently in seeing  whether you can overcome that pressure of the atmosphere.    Here is another very pretty thing--the boys' sucker, only refined by the  philosopher. We young ones have a perfect right to take toys, and make  them into philosophy, inasmuch as now-a-days we are turning philosophy  into toys. Here is a sucker, only it is made of india-rubber: if I clap it  upon the table, you see at once it holds. Why does it hold? I can slip it  about, and yet if I try to pull it up, it seems as if it would pull the  table with it I can easily make it slip about from place to place; but  only when I bring it to the edge of the table can I get it off. It is only  kept down by the pressure of the atmosphere above. We have a couple of  them; and if you take these two and press them together, you will see how  firmly they stick. And, indeed, we may use them as they are proposed to be  used, to stick against windows, or against walls, where they will adhere  for an evening, and serve to hang anything on that you want. I think,  however, that you boys ought to be shewn experiments that you can make at  home; and so here is a very pretty experiment in illustration of the  pressure of the atmosphere. Here is a tumbler of water. Suppose I were to  ask you to turn that tumbler upside-down, so that the water should not  fall out, and yet not be kept in by your hand, but merely by using the  pressure of the atmosphere. Could you do that? Take a wine-glass, either  quite full or half-full of water, and put a flat card on the top, turn it  upside-down, and then see what becomes of the card and of the water. The  air cannot get in because the water by its capillary attraction round the  edge keeps it out.    I think this will give you a correct notion of what you may call the  materiality of the air; and when I tell you that the box holds a pound of  it, and this room more than a ton, you will begin to think that air is  something very serious. I will make another experiment, to convince you of  this positive resistance. There is that beautiful experiment of the  popgun, made so well and so easily, you know, out of a quill, or a tube,  or anything of that kind,--where we take a slice of potato, for instance,  or an apple, and take the tube and cut out a pellet, as I have now done,  and push it to one end. I have made that end tight; and now I take another  piece and put it in: it will confine the air that is within the tube  perfectly and completely for our purpose; and I shall now find it  absolutely impossible by any force of mine to drive that little pellet  close up to the other. It cannot be done. I may press the air to a certain  extent, but if I go on pressing, long before it comes to the second, the  confined air will drive the front one out with a force something like that  of gunpowder; for gunpowder is in part dependent upon the same action that  you see here exemplified.    I saw the other day an experiment which pleased me much, as I thought it  would serve our purpose here. (I ought to have held my tongue for four or  five minutes before beginning this experiment, because it depends upon my  lungs for success.) By the proper application of air I expect to be able  to drive this egg out of one cup into the other by the force of my breath;  but if I fail, it is in a good cause; and I do not promise success,  because I have been talking more than I ought to do to make the experiment  succeed.    [The Lecturer here tried the experiment, and succeeded in blowing the egg  from one egg-cup to the other.]    You see that the air which I blow goes downwards between the egg and the  cup, and makes a blast under the egg, and is thus able to lift a heavy  thing--for a full egg is a very heavy thing for air to lift. If you want  to make the experiment, you had better boil the egg quite hard first, and  then you may very safely try to blow it from one cup to the other, with a  little care.    I have now kept you long enough upon this property of the weight of the  air, but there is another thing I should like to mention. You saw the way  in which, in this popgun, I was able to drive the second piece of potato  half or two-thirds of an inch before the first piece started, by virtue of  the elasticity of the air--just as I pressed into the copper bottle the  particles of air by means of the pump. Now, this depends upon a wonderful  property in the air, namely, its elasticity; and I should like to give you  a good illustration of this. If I take anything that confines the air  properly, as this membrane, which also is able to contract and expand so  as to give us a measure of the elasticity of the air, and confine in this  bladder a certain portion of air; and then, if we take the atmosphere off  from the outside of it, just as in these cases we put the pressure on--if  we take the pressure off, you will see how it will then go on expanding  and expanding, larger and larger, until it will fill the whole of this  bell-jar, shewing you that wonderful property of the air, its elasticity,  its compressibility, and expansibility, to an exceedingly large extent,  and which is very essential for the purposes and services it performs in  the economy of creation.    We will now turn to another very important part of our subject,  remembering that we have examined the candle in its burning, and have  found that it gives rise to various products. We have the products, you  know, of soot, of water, and of"]]]
