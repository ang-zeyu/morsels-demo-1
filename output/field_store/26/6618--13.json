They took the  first stage out of the village that night on their return trip for New  York State.    But the mother's victory was short-lived and barren. Within three  years after the son's return, he failed in two business enterprises in  which his father started him. Nothing discouraged, his parents offered  him a third opportunity, it containing, however, a marriage condition.  But the voice of a siren, singing of flowery prairies and pecan groves  on the Salado, in which could be heard the music of hounds and the  clattering of horses' hoofs at full speed following, filled every  niche and corner of his heart, and he balked at the marriage offer.    When the son had passed his thirtieth year, his parents became  resigned and gave their consent to his return to Texas. Long before  parental consent was finally obtained, it was evident to his many  friends that the West had completely won him; and once the desire  of his heart was secured, the languid son beamed with energy in  outfitting for his return. He wrung the hands of old friends with a  new grip, and with boyish enthusiasm announced his early departure.    On the morning of leaving, quite a crowd of friends and relatives  gathered at the depot to see him off. But when a former college chum  attempted to remonstrate with him on the social sacrifice which he was  making, he turned to the group of friends, and smilingly said, \"That's  all right. You are honest in thinking that New York is God's country.  But out there in Texas also is, for it is just as God made it. Why,  I'm going to start a cattle ranch as soon as I get there and go back  to nature. Don't pity me. Rather let me pity you, who think, act, and  look as if turned out of the same mill. Any social sacrifices which  I make in leaving here will be repaid tenfold by the freedom and  advantages of the boundless West.\"          VI    THE DOUBLE TRAIL      Early in the summer of '78 we were rocking along with a herd of Laurel  Leaf cattle, going up the old Chisholm trail in the Indian Territory.  The cattle were in charge of Ike Inks as foreman, and had been sold  for delivery somewhere in the Strip.    There were thirty-one hundred head, straight \"twos,\" and in the single  ranch brand. We had been out about four months on the trail, and all  felt that a few weeks at the farthest would let us out, for the day  before we had crossed the Cimarron River, ninety miles south of the  state line of Kansas.    The foreman was simply killing time, waiting for orders concerning the  delivery of the cattle. All kinds of jokes were in order, for we all  felt that we would soon be set free. One of our men had been taken  sick, as we crossed Red River into the Nations, and not wanting to  cross this Indian country short-handed, Inks had picked up a young  fellow who evidently had never been over the trail before.    He gave the outfit his correct name, on joining us, but it proved  unpronounceable, and for convenience some one rechristened him Lucy,  as he had quite a feminine appearance. He was anxious to learn, and  was in evidence in everything that went on.    The trail from the Cimarron to Little Turkey Creek, where we were now  camped, had originally been to the east of the present one, skirting  a black-jack country. After being used several years it had been  abandoned, being sandy, and the new route followed up the bottoms  of Big Turkey, since it was firmer soil, affording better footing to  cattle. These two trails came together again at Little Turkey. At no  place were they over two or three miles apart, and from where they  separated to where they came together again was about seven miles.    It troubled Lucy not to know why this was thus. Why did these routes  separate and come together again? He was fruitful with inquiries as to  where this trail or that road led. The boss-man had a vein of humor in  his make-up, though it was not visible; so he told the young man that  he did not know, as he had been over this route but once before, but  he thought that Stubb, who was then on herd, could tell him how it  was; he had been over the trail every year since it was laid out.  This was sufficient to secure Stubb an interview, as soon as he was  relieved from duty and had returned to the wagon. So Ike posted one of  the men who was next on guard to tell Stubb what to expect, and to be  sure to tell it to him scary.    A brief description of Stubb necessarily intrudes, though this  nickname describes the man. Extremely short in stature, he was  inclined to be fleshy. In fact, a rear view of Stubb looked as though  some one had hollowed out a place to set his head between his ample  shoulders. But a front view revealed a face like a full moon. In  disposition he was very amiable. His laugh was enough to drive away  the worst case of the blues. It bubbled up from some inward source and  seemed perennial. His worst fault was his bar-room astronomy. If there  was any one thing that he shone in, it was rustling coffin varnish  during the early prohibition days along the Kansas border. His  patronage was limited only by his income, coupled with what credit he  enjoyed.    Once, about midnight, he tried to arouse a drug clerk who slept in the  store, and as he had worked this racket before, he coppered the play  to repeat. So he tapped gently on the window at the rear where the  clerk slept, calling him by name. This he repeated any number of  times. Finally, he threatened to have a fit; even this did not work  to his advantage. Then he pretended to be very angry, but there was  no response. After fifteen minutes had been fruitlessly spent, he went  back to the window, tapped on it once more, saying, \"Lon, lie still,  you little son-of-a-sheep-thief,\" which may not be what he said, and  walked away. A party who had forgotten his name was once inquiring  for him, describing him thus, \"He's a little short, fat fellow, sits  around the Maverick Hotel, talks cattle talk, and punishes a power of  whiskey.\"    So before Stubb had even time to unsaddle his horse, he was approached  to know the history of these two trails.    \"Well,\" said Stubb somewhat hesitatingly, \"I never like to refer to  it. You see, I killed a man the day that right-hand trail was made:  I'll tell you about it some other time.\"    \"But why not now?\" said Lucy, his curiosity aroused, as keen as a  woman's.    \"Some other day,\" said Stubb. \"But did you notice those three graves  on the last ridge of sand-hills to the right as we came out of the  Cimarron bottoms yesterday? You did? Their tenants were killed over  that trail; you see now why I hate to refer to it, don't you? I was  afraid to go back to Texas for three years afterward.\"    \"But why not tell me?\" said the young man.    \"Oh,\" said Stubb, as he knelt down to put a hobble on his horse, \"it  would injure my reputation as a peaceable citizen, and I don't mind  telling you that I expect to marry soon.\"    Having worked up the proper interest in his listener, besides exacting  a promise that he would not repeat the story where it might do  injury to him, he dragged his saddle up to the camp-fire. Making a  comfortable seat with it, he riveted his gaze on the fire, and with a  splendid sang-froid reluctantly told the history of the double trail.    \"You see,\" began Stubb, \"the Chisholm route had been used more or less  for ten years. This right-hand trail was made in '73. I bossed that  year from Van Zandt County, for old Andy Erath, who, by the way, was a  dead square cowman with not a hide-bound idea in his make-up. Son, it  was a pleasure to know old Andy. You can tell he was a good man, for  if he ever got a drink too much, though he would never mention her  otherwise, he always praised his wife. I've been with him up beyond  the Yellowstone, two thousand miles from home, and you always knew  when the old man was primed. He would praise his wife, and would call  on us boys to confirm the fact that Mary, his wife, was a good woman.    \"That year we had the better of twenty-nine hundred head, all steer  cattle, threes and up, a likely bunch, better than these we are  shadowing now. You see, my people are not driving this year, which is  the reason that I am making a common hand with Inks. If I was to lay  off a season, or go to the seacoast, I might forget the way. In those  days I always hired my own men. The year that this right-hand trail  was made, I had an outfit of men who would rather fight than eat; in  fact, I selected them on account of their special fitness in the use  of firearms. Why, Inks here couldn't have cooked for my outfit  that season, let alone rode. There was no particular incident worth  mentioning till we struck Red River, where we overtook five or six  herds that were laying over on account of a freshet in the river. I  wouldn't have a man those days who was not as good in the water as  out. When I rode up to the river, one or two of my men were with me.  It looked red and muddy and rolled just a trifle, but I ordered one  of the boys to hit it on his horse, to see what it was like. Well, he  never wet the seat of his saddle going or coming, though his horse was  in swimming water good sixty yards. All the other bosses rode up, and  each one examined his peg to see if the rise was falling. One fellow  named Bob Brown, boss-man for John Blocker, asked me what I thought  about the crossing. I said to him, 'If this ferryman can cross our  wagon for me, and you fellows will open out a little and let me in,  I'll show you all a crossing, and it'll be no miracle either.'    \"Well, the ferryman said he'd set the wagon over, so the men went back  to bring up the herd. They were delayed some little time, changing to  their swimming horses. It was nearly an hour before the herd came up,  the others opening out, so as to give us a clear field, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12288"],[0,"The Witchcraft Delusion in Colonial Connecticut (1647-1697) (#14)"],[1,"and  failable from ye easy deception of her senses & subtile devices of ye  devill, wherefore cannot think her a sufficient witnesse; yet we think  that her affliction being something strange it well deserves a farther  inquiry.    \"4.

The jury that brought her in guilty (which uerdict was the ground  of her condemnation) was not the same jury who were first charged with  this prisoners deliuerance and who had it in charg many weeks. Mr.  Knowles was on the jury first sworn to try this woman and he was at or  about York when the Court sate the second time and when the uerdict was  given, the jury was altered and another man sworn.    \"It is so inuiolable a practice in law that the indiudual jurors and  jury that is charged with the deliuerance of a prisoner in a capital  case and on whom the prisoner puts himself or herself to be tryed must  try it and they only that al the presidents in Old England and New  confirm it and not euer heard of til this time to be inouated. And yet  not only president but the nature of the thing inforces it for to these  juors the law gaue this power vested it in them they had it in right of  law and it is incompatible and impossible that it should be uested in  these and in others too for then two juries may haue the same power in  the same case one man altered the jury is altered.    \"Tis the birthright of the Kings' subjects so and no otherwise to be  tryed and they must not be despoyled of it.    \"Due form of law is that alone wherein the ualidity of verdicts and  judgments in such cases stands and if a real and apparent murtherer be  condemned and executed out of due form of law it is inditable against  them that do it for in such case the law is superseded by arbitrary  doings.    \"What the Court accepts and the prisoner accepts differing from the law  is nothing what the law admitts is al in the case.    \"If one jury may be changed two, ten, the whole may be so, and solemn  oathe made uain.    \"Wee durst not but dissent from and declare against such alterations by  our repreueing therefore the said prisoner when ye were informed of this  business about her jury, and we pray this honored Court to take heed  what they do in it now it is roled to their doore and that at least they  be well sattisfied from able lawyers that such a chang is in law  alowable ere this prisoner be executed least they bring themselues into  inextricable troubles and the whole country.

Stanly, level-headed men  of affairs, all friends of the court called upon for advice and  counsel--who gave it in full scriptural measure.[H]      [Footnote H: Mercy Disborough was pardoned, as the records show that she  was living in 1707.]          CHAPTER VIII    \"Old Matthew Maule was executed for the crime of witchcraft. He was one  of the martyrs to that terrible delusion, which should teach us, among  its other morals, that the influential classes, and those who take upon  themselves to be leaders of the people, are fully liable to all the  passionate error that has ever characterized the maddest mob.\"    \"Clergymen, judges, statesmen--the wisest, calmest, holiest persons of  their day--stood in the inner circle round about the gallows, loudest to  applaud the work of blood, latest to confess themselves miserably  deceived.\"    \"This old reprobate was one of the sufferers when Cotton Mather, and his  brother ministers, and the learned judges, and other wise men, and Sir  William Phipps, the sagacious governor, made such laudable efforts to  weaken the great enemy of souls by sending a multitude of his adherents  up the rocky pathway of Gallows Hill.\" _The House of the Seven Gables_  (20: 225), HAWTHORNE.    \"Then, too, the belief in witchcraft was general. Striking coincidences,  personal eccentricities, unusual events and mysterious diseases seemed  to find an easy explanation in an unholy compact with the devil. A  witticism attributed to Judge Sewall, one of the judges in these trials,  may help us to understand the common panic: 'We know who's who but not  which is witch.' That was the difficulty. At a time when every one  believed in witchcraft it was easy to suspect one's neighbor. It was a  characteristic superstition of the century and should be classed with  the barbarous punishments and religious intolerance of the age.\" _N.E.  Hist. Towns_.--LATIMER'S--_Salem_ (150).      Multiplication of these witchcraft testimonies, quaint and curious,  vulgar and commonplace, evil and pathetic, voices all of a strange  superstition, understandable only as through them alone can one gain a  clear perspective of the spirit of the time and place, would prove  wearisome. They may well remain in the ancient records until they find  publicity in detail in some accurate and complete history of the  beginnings of the commonwealth--including this strange chapter in its  unique history.    It will, however, serve a present necessary purpose, and lead to a more  exact conception of the reign of unreason, if glimpses be taken here and  there of a few of the statements made on oath in some of the other  cases.

Goodwife Seager upon the return of the parsnips  was much troubled and sent for her husband and sent him up to Goodm  Hosmer to know the reason why he would not reciue the parsnips, and he  told goodman Seager it was because An Coale at the fast at Mr. Willis  cryed out against his wife as being a witch and he would not receiue  the parsnips least he should be brought in hereaftr as a testimony  against his wife.
