[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13172"],[0,"True Stories of Crime From the District Attorney's Office (#14)"],[1," the stretch!\"    \"Satan wins by a nose--Peter second.\"    There was a deafening uproar, hats were tossed ceilingward, and great  wads of money were passed out by the \"trusted cashier\" to indifferent  millionaires. Felix wanted to rush in and bet at once on something--if  he waited it might be too late. Was it necessary to be introduced to the  cashier? No? Would he take the bet? All right, but--    At that moment a page elbowed his way among the money calling  plaintively for \"Felix! Mr. Felix.\" Shrinking at the thought of such  publicity in such distinguished company, Felix caught the boy's arm and  learned that he was wanted at the telephone booth in the hotel.    \"It must be 'Mac,'\" said Nelson. \"Now don't make any mistake!\" Felix  promised to use the utmost care.    It was \"Mac.\"    \"Is this Mr. Felix?--Yes? Well, be very careful now. I am going to give  you the result of the third race which has already been run. I will hold  back the news three minutes. This is merely to see if everything is  working right. Don't make any bet. If I give you the winners correctly,  you can put your money on the fourth race. The horse that won the last  is Col. Starbottle--Don Juan is second. Now just step back and see if I  am right.\"    Felix rushed back to the pool room. As he entered the man at the tape  was calling out that \"they\" were off. In due course \"they\" reached the  quarter and then the half. A terrific struggle was in progress between  Col. Starbottle and Don Juan. First one was ahead and then the other.  Finally they came thundering down to the stretch, Col. Starbottle  winning by a neck. \"Gates\" won $90,000, and several others pocketed wads  running anywhere from $20,000 to $60,000.    Felix hurried back to the telephone. \"Mac\" was at the other end.    \"Now write this down,\" admonished McPherson; \"we can't afford to have  any mistake. Old Stone has just won the fourth race, with Calvert  second. Play Old Stone to win at 5 to 1. We shall make $250,000--and Old  Stone is safe in the stable all the time and his jockey is smoking a  cigarette on the club house veranda. Good luck, old man.\"    Felix had some difficulty in getting near the \"trusted cashier\" so many  financiers were betting on Calvert. Felix smiled to himself. He'd show  them a thing or two.    Finally he managed to push his envelope containing the five  ten-thousand-dollar bills into the \"trusted cashier's\" hand. The latter  marked it \"Old Stone, 5 to 1 to win!\" and thrust it into his pocket.  Then \"Whitney\" or somebody bet $70,000 on Calvert.    \"They're off!\" shouted the man at the tape.    How he lived while they tore around the course Felix never knew. Neck  and neck Old Stone and Calvert passed the quarter, the half, and the  three-quarter post, and with the crowd yelling like demons came hurtling  down the stretch.    \"Old Stone wins!\" cried the \"booster\" at the tape in a voice husky with  excitement. \"Calvert a close second!\" Felix nearly fainted. His head  swam. He had won a quarter of a million. Then the voice of the \"booster\"  made itself audible above the confusion.    \"What! A mistake? Not possible!--Yes. Owing to some confusion at the  finish, both jockies wearing the same colors, the official returns now  read Calvert first; Old Stone second.\"    Among the zitherns Felix sat and wondered if he had been schvindled. He  had not returned to Wassermann Brothers. Had he done so he would have  found it empty five minutes after he had lost his money. The  millionaires were already streaming hilariously into Sharkey's. \"Gates\"  pledged \"Belmont\" and \"Keene\" pledged \"Whitney.\" Each had earned five  dollars by the sweat of his brow. The glorious army of wire-tappers had  won another victory and their generals had consummated a campaign of  months. Expenses (roughly), $600. Receipts, $50,000. Net profits,  $48,400. Share of each, $16,133.    A day or two later Felix wandered down to Police Headquarters, and in  the Rogue's Gallery identified the photograph of Nelson, whom he then  discovered to be none other than William Crane, alias John Lawson, alias  John Larsen, a well-known \"wire-tapper,\" arrested some dozen times  within a year or two for similar offences. McPherson turned out to be  Christopher Tracy, alias Charles J. Tracy, alias Charles Tompkins, alias  Topping, alias Toppin, etc., etc., arrested some eight or ten times for  \"wire-tapping.\" The \"trusted cashier\" materialized in the form of one  Wyatt, alias, Fred Williams, etc., a \"wire-tapper\" and pal of \"Chappie\"  Moran and \"Larry\" Summerfield. Detective Sergeants Fogarty and Mundy  were at once detailed upon the case and arrested within a short time  both Nelson and McPherson. The \"trusted cashier\" who had pocketed  Felix's $50,000 has never been caught. It is said that he is running a  first-class hostelry in a Western city. But that is another story.    When acting Inspector O'Brien ordered McPherson brought into his private  room, the latter unhesitatingly admitted that the three of them had  \"trimmed\" Felix of his $50,000, exactly as the latter had alleged. He  stated that Wyatt (alias Williams) was the one who had taken in the  money, that it was still in his possession, and still intact in its  original form. He denied, however, any knowledge of Wyatt's whereabouts.    The reason for this indifference became apparent when the two prisoners  were arraigned in the magistrate's court, and their counsel demanded  their instant discharge on the ground that they had committed no crime  for which they could be prosecuted. He cited an old New York case,  McCord _vs._ The People,[2] which seemed in a general way to sustain his  contention, and which had been followed by another and much more recent  decision. The People _vs._ Livingston.[3] The first of these cases had  gone to the Court of Appeals, and the general doctrine had been  annunciated that where a person parts with his money for an unlawful or  dishonest purpose, even though he is tricked into so doing by false  pretences, a prosecution for the crime of larceny cannot be maintained.    [Footnote 2: 46 New York 470.]    [Footnote 3: 47 App. Div. 283.]    In the McCord case, the defendant had falsely pretended to the  complainant, a man named Miller, that he was a police officer and held a  warrant for his arrest. By these means he had induced Miller to give him  a gold watch and a diamond ring as the price of his liberty. The  conviction in this case was reversed on the ground that Miller parted  with his property for an unlawful purpose; but there was a very strong  dissenting opinion from Mr. Justice Peckham, now a member of the bench  of the Supreme Court of the United States.    In the second case, that of Livingston, the complainant had been  defrauded out of $500 by means of the \"green goods\" game; but this  conviction was reversed by the Appellate Division of the Second  Department on the authority of the McCord case. The opinion in this case  was written by Mr. justice Cullen, now Chief Judge of the New York Court  of Appeals, who says in conclusion:    \"We very much regret being compelled to reverse this conviction. Even if  the prosecutor intended to deal in counterfeit money, that is no reason  why the appellant should go unwhipped of justice. We venture to suggest  that it might be Well for the Legislature to alter the rule laid down in  McCord _vs._ People.\"    Well might the judges regret being compelled to set a rogue at liberty  simply because he had been ingenious enough to invent a fraud (very  likely with the assistance of a shyster lawyer) which involved the  additional turpitude of seducing another into a criminal conspiracy.  Livingston was turned loose upon the community in spite of the fact that  he had swindled a man out of $500 because he had incidentally led the  latter to believe that in return he was to receive counterfeit money or  \"green goods,\" which might be put into circulation. Yet, because some  years before, the Judges of the Court of Appeals had, in the McCord  matter, adopted the rule followed in civil cases, to wit that as the  complaining witness was himself in fault and did not come into court  with clean hands he could have no standing before them, the Appellate  Division in the next case felt obliged to follow them and to rule  tantamount to saying that two wrongs could make a right and two knaves  one honest man. It may seem a trifle unfair to put it in just this way,  but when one realizes the iniquity of such a doctrine as applied to  criminal cases, it is hard to speak softly. Thus the broad and general  doctrine seemed to be established that so long as a thief could induce  his victim to believe that it was to his advantage to enter into a  dishonest transaction, he might defraud him to any extent in his power.  Immediately there sprang into being hordes of swindlers, who, aided by  adroit shyster lawyers, invented all sorts of schemes which involved  some sort of dishonesty upon the part of the person to be defrauded. The  \"wire-tappers,\" of whom \"Larry\" Summerfield was the Napoleon, the  \"gold-brick\" and \"green-goods\" men, and the \"sick engineers\" flocked to  New York, which, under the unwitting protection of the Court of Appeals,  became a veritable Mecca for persons of their ilk.    To readers unfamiliar with the cast of mind of professional criminals it  will be almost impossible to appreciate with what bold insouciance these  vultures now hovered over the metropolitan barnyard. Had not the Court  of Appeals itself recognized their profession? They had nothing to fear.  The law was on their side. They walked the streets flaunting their  immunity in the very face of the police. \"Wire-tapping\" became an  industry, a legalized industry with which the authorities might  interfere at their peril. Indeed, there is one instance in which a  \"wire-tapper\" successfully prosecuted his victim (after he had trimmed  him) upon a charge of grand larceny arising out of the same"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13177"],[0,"Chocolate and Cocoa Recipes and Home Made Candy Recipes (#14)"],[1,"gers, turn the edges towards the center;  continue this until the candy is cold enough to pull; pull over a hook  until cold; add the flavoring, a little at a time, during the pulling,  cut in short lengths and wrap in waxed paper.          WALTER BAKER & CO., Ltd.    ESTABLISHED 1780      This House has grown to be the largest of its kind in the world and it  has achieved that result by always maintaining the highest standard in  the quality of its cocoa and chocolate preparations and selling them at  the lowest price for which unadulterated articles of high grade can be  put upon the market. Under cover of a similarity in name, trade-mark,  label or wrapper, a number of unscrupulous concerns have, within recent  years, made attempts to get possession of the great market won by this  House, by trading on its good name--selling to unsuspecting consumers  goods of distinctly inferior quality by representing them to be the  products of the genuine \"Baker's.\" The quantity of goods sold in this  way is not so much of an injury to us as the discredit cast upon our  manufactures by leading some consumers to believe that these fraudulent  articles are of our manufacture and that we have lowered the high  standard maintained for so many years. It is difficult to bring the  fraud home to all consumers, as those who are making use of it seek  out-of-the-way places where deception will the more easily pass.    We have letters from housekeepers who have used the genuine Baker goods  for years, expressing their indignation at the attempts of unscrupulous  dealers to foist upon them inferior and adulterated articles by  fraudulently representing them to be of our manufacture.    Statements in the press and in the reports of the Pure Food  Commissioners show that there are on the market at this time many cocoas  and chocolates which have been treated with adulterants, more or less  injurious to health, for the purpose of cheapening the cost and giving a  fictitious appearance of richness and strength. The safest course for  consumers, therefore, is to buy goods bearing the name and trade-mark of  a well-known and reputable manufacturer, and to make sure by a careful  examination that they are getting what they order.         Our Cocoa and Chocolate Preparations are ABSOLUTELY PURE--free       from coloring matter, chemical solvents, or adulterants of any       kind, and are therefore in full conformity to the requirements of       all National and State Pure Food Laws.    We have behind us one hundred and twenty-nine years of successful  manufacture, and fifty-two highest awards from the great industrial  exhibitions in Europe and America.    We ask the cooperation of all consumers who want to get what they order  and what they pay for to help us--as much in their own interest as  ours--in checking these frauds.

The color of the case is  the same shade of deep blue heretofore used on the Baker packages, and  no change has been made in the color (yellow) and design of the label.  On the outside of the case, the name of the manufacturer is prominently  printed in white letters. On the back of every package a colored  lithograph of the trade-mark, \"La Belle Chocolatiere\" sometimes called  the Chocolate Girl, is printed.
