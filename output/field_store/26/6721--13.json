Finally, when one  thing is different from another, the things so conceived as distinct  cannot be identical. Therefore that which of its own nature is distinct  from the highest good is not itself the highest good--an impious thought  of Him than whom, 'tis plain, nothing can be more excellent. For  universally nothing can be better in nature than the source from which  it has come; therefore on most true grounds of reason would I conclude  that which is the source of all things to be in its own essence the  highest good.'    'And most justly,' said I.    'But the highest good has been admitted to be happiness.'    'Yes.'    'Then,' said she, 'it is necessary to acknowledge that God is very  happiness.'    'Yes,' said I; 'I cannot gainsay my former admissions, and I see clearly  that this is a necessary inference therefrom.'    'Reflect, also,' said she, 'whether the same conclusion is not further  confirmed by considering that there cannot be two supreme goods distinct  one from the other. For the goods which are different clearly cannot be  severally each what the other is: wherefore neither of the two can be  perfect, since to either the other is wanting; but since it is not  perfect, it cannot manifestly be the supreme good. By no means, then,  can goods which are supreme be different one from the other. But we have  concluded that both happiness and God are the supreme good; wherefore  that which is highest Divinity must also itself necessarily be supreme  happiness.'    'No conclusion,' said I, 'could be truer to fact, nor more soundly  reasoned out, nor more worthy of God.'    'Then, further,' said she, 'just as geometricians are wont to draw  inferences from their demonstrations to which they give the name  \"deductions,\" so will I add here a sort of corollary. For since men  become happy by the acquisition of happiness, while happiness is very  Godship, it is manifest that they become happy by the acquisition of  Godship. But as by the acquisition of justice men become just, and wise  by the acquisition of wisdom, so by parity of reasoning by acquiring  Godship they must of necessity become gods. So every man who is happy is  a god; and though in nature God is One only, yet there is nothing to  hinder that very many should be gods by participation in that nature.'    'A fair conclusion, and a precious,' said I, 'deduction or corollary, by  whichever name thou wilt call it.'    'And yet,' said she, 'not one whit fairer than this which reason  persuades us to add.'    'Why, what?' said I.    'Why, seeing happiness has many particulars included under it, should  all these be regarded as forming one body of happiness, as it were, made  up of various parts, or is there some one of them which forms the full  essence of happiness, while all the rest are relative to this?'    'I would thou wouldst unfold the whole matter to me at large.'    'We judge happiness to be good, do we not?'    'Yea, the supreme good.'    'And this superlative applies to all; for this same happiness is  adjudged to be the completest independence, the highest power,  reverence, renown, and pleasure.'    'What then?'    'Are all these goods--independence, power, and the rest--to be deemed  members of happiness, as it were, or are they all relative to good as to  their summit and crown?'    'I understand the problem, but I desire to hear how thou wouldst solve  it.'    'Well, then, listen to the determination of the matter. Were all these  members composing happiness, they would differ severally one from the  other. For this is the nature of parts--that by their difference they  compose one body. All these, however, have been proved to be the same;  therefore they cannot possibly be members, otherwise happiness will seem  to be built up out of one member, which cannot be.'    'There can be no doubt as to that,' said I; 'but I am impatient to hear  what remains.'    'Why, it is manifest that all the others are relative to the good. For  the very reason why independence is sought is that it is judged good,  and so power also, because it is believed to be good. The same, too, may  be supposed of reverence, of renown, and of pleasant delight. Good,  then, is the sum and source of all desirable things. That which has not  in itself any good, either in reality or in semblance, can in no wise be  desired. Contrariwise, even things which by nature are not good are  desired as if they were truly good, if they seem to be so. Whereby it  comes to pass that goodness is rightly believed to be the sum and hinge  and cause of all things desirable. Now, that for the sake of which  anything is desired itself seems to be most wished for. For instance, if  anyone wishes to ride for the sake of health, he does not so much wish  for the exercise of riding as the benefit of his health. Since, then,  all things are sought for the sake of the good, it is not these so much  as good itself that is sought by all. But that on account of which all  other things are wished for was, we agreed, happiness; wherefore thus  also it appears that it is happiness alone which is sought. From all  which it is transparently clear that the essence of absolute good and of  happiness is one and the same.'    'I cannot see how anyone can dissent from these conclusions.'    'But we have also proved that God and true happiness are one and the  same.'    'Yes,' said I.    'Then we can safely conclude, also, that God's essence is seated in  absolute good, and nowhere else.'        SONG X.    THE TRUE LIGHT.          Hither come, all ye whose minds      Lust with rosy fetters binds--      Lust to bondage hard compelling      Th' earthy souls that are his dwelling--      Here shall be your labour's close;      Here your haven of repose.      Come, to your one refuge press;      Wide it stands to all distress!        Not the glint of yellow gold      Down bright Hermus' current rolled;      Not the Tagus' precious sands,      Nor in far-off scorching lands      All the radiant gems that hide      Under Indus' storied tide--      Emerald green and glistering white--      Can illume our feeble sight;      But they rather leave the mind      In its native darkness blind.      For the fairest beams they shed      In earth's lowest depths were fed;      But the splendour that supplies      Strength and vigour to the skies,      And the universe controls,      Shunneth dark and ruined souls.      He who once hath seen _this_ light      Will not call the sunbeam bright.        XI.      'I quite agree,' said I, 'truly all thy reasonings hold admirably  together.'    Then said she: 'What value wouldst thou put upon the boon shouldst thou  come to the knowledge of the absolute good?'    'Oh, an infinite,' said I, 'if only I were so blest as to learn to know  God also who is the good.'    'Yet this will I make clear to thee on truest grounds of reason, if only  our recent conclusions stand fast.'    'They will.'    'Have we not shown that those things which most men desire are not true  and perfect good precisely for this cause--that they differ severally  one from another, and, seeing that one is wanting to another, they  cannot bestow full and absolute good; but that they become the true good  when they are gathered, as it were, into one form and agency, so that  that which is independence is likewise power, reverence, renown, and  pleasant delight, and unless they are all one and the same, they have no  claim to be counted among things desirable?'    'Yes; this was clearly proved, and cannot in any wise be doubted.'    'Now, when things are far from being good while they are different, but  become good as soon as they are one, is it not true that these become  good by acquiring unity?'    'It seems so,' said I.    'But dost not thou allow that all which is good is good by participation  in goodness?'    'It is.'    'Then, thou must on similar grounds admit that unity and goodness are  the same; for when the effects of things in their natural working differ  not, their essence is one and the same.'    'There is no denying it.'    'Now, dost thou know,' said she, 'that all which is abides and subsists  so long as it continues one, but so soon as it ceases to be one it  perishes and falls to pieces?'    'In what way?'    'Why, take animals, for example. When soul and body come together, and  continue in one, this is, we say, a living creature; but when this unity  is broken by the separation of these two, the creature dies, and is  clearly no longer living. The body also, while it remains in one form by  the joining together of its members, presents a human appearance; but if  the separation and dispersal of the parts break up the body's unity, it  ceases to be what it was. And if we extend our survey to all other  things, without doubt it will manifestly appear that each several thing  subsists while it is one, but when it ceases to be one perishes.'    'Yes; when I consider further, I see it to be even as thou sayest.'    'Well, is there aught,' said she, 'which, in so far as it acts  conformably to nature, abandons the wish for life, and desires to come  to death and corruption?'    'Looking to living creatures, which have some faults of choice, I find  none that, without external compulsion, forego the will to live, and of  their own accord hasten to destruction. For every creature diligently  pursues the end of self-preservation, and shuns death and destruction!  As to herbs and trees, and inanimate things generally, I am altogether  in doubt what to think.'    'And yet there is no possibility of question about this either, since  thou seest how herbs and trees grow in places suitable for them, where,  as far as their nature admits, they cannot quickly wither and die. Some  spring up in the plains, others in the mountains; some grow in marshes,  others cling to rocks; and others, again, find a fertile soil in the  barren sands; and if you "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14339"],[0,"Music Talks with Children (#14)"],[1,"he wrote and rewrote until they were  exactly as they should be. _It will do_ is a thought that never comes  into the head of a great artist. How do you imagine such a man was to  his friends? We are told that, \"he was in character at once great and  simple.\" And again it has been said that, \"his smile was like heaven.\"    We have seen Handel as the great composer, but he was not so busy in  this that his thoughts were not also dwelling upon other things. If  ever you go to London, you should of a Sunday morning hear the service  at the Foundling Hospital. You will see there many hundreds of boys  and girls grouped about the organ. Their singing will seem beautiful  to you, from its sweetness and from the simple faith in which it is  done. After the service you may go to the many rooms of this home for  so many otherwise homeless ones.    There are for you to visit: the playroom, the schoolroom, the long  halls with the pretty white cots, and the pleasant dining-room. Here  it will please you to see the little ones march into dinner, with  their similar dresses, and all looking as happy as possible. But the  picture you will, no doubt, longest keep, is that of the children  about the organ.    They will tell you there that it was Handel who gave this organ to the  chapel, and who, for the benefit of the children who might come here,  gave concerts, playing and conducting, which were so successful that  they had to be repeated. A \"fair copy\" of the \"Messiah\" will be shown  you as one of the precious possessions.    It will very plainly be present in your mind how the little boy sat  alone playing day after day in the garret, wishing no better pastime  than to express the feelings of his heart in tones. Perhaps you will  think of his words: \"Learn (of) all there is to learn, then choose  your own path.\" He will appeal to you as having possessed an \"early  completeness of character,\" which abided always with him. It is  evident in following the life of Handel, and it would be equally plain  with any other composer, that great talent is developed out of a small  beginning, and if small, is yet earnest and determined. From the first  days of a great man's life to the last we find constant effort. \"I  consider those live best who study best to become as good as  possible.\"[64] Music helps us to keep the upper windows open; that is  why it does so much for us even if we have but one talent.    To develop our one talent is a duty, just as it is a duty to develop  two or five talents. It is given to us to increase. And no one knows  how much joy may come to us and to others from the growing of that  talent. We gain much in power to give pleasure to others, if the  talent we have be made stronger by faithful effort. As we have seen  good come forth from the story of the man with many talents, we can  see how, similarly, he with one talent has also great power with which  he may add unto himself and others.    In all of our Talks it has been evident from what we have said, that  music is a beautiful art to us, even though we may have but little of  it. But equally we have learned, that for ever so little we must prove  ourselves worthy. We must honestly give something for all we get. This  is the law, and the purpose of all our Talks is to learn it.    We have, likewise, learned that true music, _out of the heart_, may  not at the first please us, but within it there is a great deal and we  must seek it. The history of all who have faithfully studied the works  of the great masters is, that for all the thought and time one spends  in studying master works a great gain comes. On the other hand,  everybody's experience with common music is, that while it may please  much at first and even captivate us, yet it soon tires us so that we  can scarcely listen patiently to it.    Still a further lesson is, that working with many talents or with one  is the same. Talents, one or many, are for increase and faithful  development. Handel's life was a determined struggle to make the most  of his power. It should be ours.          CHAPTER XXI.    LOVE FOR THE BEAUTIFUL.        \"Every color, every variety of form, has some purpose and    explanation.\"--_Sir John Lubbock_.[65]    Now, when we are almost at the end of the way we have traveled  together, it will be natural to look back upon the road over which we  have come. Not all of it will be visible, to be sure. We have  forgotten this pleasant scene and that; others, however, remain fresh  in our minds. And as the days pass and we think over our way there  will now and again come to us a scene, a remembrance, so full of  beauty and of pleasure that we shall feel rich in the possession of  it.    To me there is nothing we have learned together greater in value,  richer in truth and comfort than the thought that the beautiful in  music and in art is at the same time the good. Even if a person is not  at all times good, there is raised in him the feeling of it whenever  he consciously looks upon a beautiful object. We see in this how wise  it is for one to choose to have beautiful things, to surround others  with them, to love them, and to place reverent hands upon them.    We can never make a mistake about gentle hands. Once a lady said to a  boy:    \"You should touch all things with the same delicacy that one should  bestow upon a tender flower. It shows that deep within yourself you  are at rest, that you make your hands go forward to a task carefully  and with much thought. In the roughest games you play do not forget  this; then your hands shall be filled with all the thought you have  within yourself.\"    Sometimes, when I am in a great gallery, the thought is very strong in  me, that many (ever, and ever so many) people, in all countries and in  all times, have so loved the beautiful as to devote their lives to it.  Painters, who have made pictures to delight men for generations,  looked and looked and _prayed_ to find the beautiful. And we must  believe that one looks out of the heart to find the beautiful or he  finds only the common. And the sculptors who have loved marble for the  delight they have in beautiful forms, they, too, with eyes seeking  beauty, and hands so gentle upon the marble that it almost breathes  for them, they, too, have loved the beautiful.    But commoner ones have the tenderest love for what is sweet and fair  in life,--people who are neither painters nor sculptors. In their  little way--but it is a _true_ way--they have sunlight in their  hearts, and with it love for something.    Perhaps it is a flower. I have been told of a man--in fact I have seen  him--who could do the cruelest things; who was so bad that he could  not be permitted to go free among others, and yet he loved plants so  much that if they were put near him he would move quietly among them,  touching this one and that; gazing at them, and acting as if he were  in another world. As we said once before about the spring, so we may  say here about love for the beautiful: it may be covered up with every  thing that is able to keep it down, but _it is always there_.    It is always pleasanter to hear about people and their ways than to  heed advice. But people and their ways often set us good examples; and  we were curious, indeed, if we did not look sharply at ourselves to  see just what we are. From all we have been told about the beautiful  we can at least learn this: that it sweetens life; that it makes even  a common life bright; that if we have it in us it may be as golden  sunlight to some poor one who is in the darkness of ignorance, that is  the advantage and the beauty of all good things in our lives, namely,  the good it may be unto others. And the beautiful music we may sing or  play is not to show what we are or what we can do--it will, of course  do these things--but it is to be a blessing to those who listen. And  how are blessings bestowed? _Out of the heart._    Once there was a nobleman[66] with power and riches. He loved  everything. Learning and art and all had he partaken of. But the times  were troubled in his country, and for some reason he lost all he had  and was imprisoned. Then there was scarcely anything in his life. All  he had was the cell, the prison-yard, and, now and again, a word or  two with his keeper. The cell was small and gloomy, the keeper silent,  the yard confined and so closely paved with cobblestones that one  could scarcely see the earth between them.    Yes, indeed, it was a small world and a barren one into which they had  forced him. But he had his thoughts, and daily as he walked in his  confined yard, they were busy with the past, weaving, weaving. What  patterns they made, and he, poor one, was sometimes afraid of them!  But still they kept on weaving, weaving.    One day, as he walked in his yard, he noticed that between two of the  stones there seemed to be something and he looked at it. With the  greatest attention he studied it, then he knelt on the rude stones and  looked and looked again. His heart beat and his hands trembled, but  yet with a touch as gentle as any one could give, he moved a grain or  two of soil and there, beneath, was something which the poor captive  cried out for joy to see--a tiny plant. As if in a new world, and  certainly as if another man, he cared daily for the tender little  companion that had come to share his loneliness; he thought of it  first in the morning and last at night. He gave it of his supply of  water and, as a father, he watched over it.    And it grew so that one day he saw that his plant must either die or  have more room. And it could not have more room unless a cobblestone  were removed. Now this could only be done with the consent of the  Emperor. Well, let us not stop to hear about the way he found, but he  did get his request to the Emperor and, after a while, what happened  do you think? That the plant was given more room? Yes, that is partly  it, and the rest is this: the prisoner"]]]
