The commander at the fort refused to allow the ships to sail  out of the harbor until they had the necessary papers. The only way to  get rid of the tea was to destroy it. A party of patriots, dressed as  Indians, went on board of the ships as they lay at the wharf, broke open  the tea boxes, and threw the tea into the harbor.

Punishment of Massachusetts, 1774.--The British king, the  British government, and the mass of the British people were furious when  they found that the Boston people had made \"tea with salt water.\"  Parliament at once went to work passing acts to punish the colonists.  One act put an end to the constitution of Massachusetts. Another act  closed the port of Boston so tightly that the people could not bring hay  from Charlestown to give to their starving horses. A third act provided  that soldiers who fired on the people should be tried in England. And a  fourth act compelled the colonists to feed and shelter the soldiers  employed to punish them.    [Sidenote: The colonists aid Massachusetts. _Higginson_, 174-177.]    [Sidenote: George Washington.]    125. Sympathy with the Bostonians.--King George thought he could  punish the Massachusetts people as much as he wished without the people  of the other colonies objecting. It soon appeared that the people of the  other colonies sympathized most heartily with the Bostonians. They sent  them sheep and rice. They sent them clothes. George Washington was now a  rich man. He offered to raise a thousand men with his own money, march  with them to Boston, and rescue the oppressed people from their  oppressors. But the time for war had not yet come although it was  not far off.    [Sidenote: The Quebec Act, 1774.]    126. The Quebec Act, 1774.--In the same year that Parliament passed  the four acts to punish Massachusetts, it passed another act which  affected the people of other colonies as well as those of Massachusetts.  This was the Quebec Act. It provided that the land between the Ohio, the  Mississippi, and the Great Lakes should be added to the Province of  Quebec. Now this land was claimed by Massachusetts, Connecticut, New  York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. These colonies were to be deprived of  their rights to land in that region. The Quebec Act also provided for  the establishment of a very strong government in that province. This  seemed to be an attack on free institutions. All these things drove the  colonists to unite. They resolved to hold a congress where the leaders  of the several continental colonies might talk over matters and decide  what should be done.    [Sidenote: The First Continental Congress, 1774.]    127. The First Continental Congress, 1774.--The members of the  Continental Congress met in Carpenter's Hall, Philadelphia, in  September, 1774. Never, except in the Federal Convention (p. 137), have  so many great men met together. The greatest delegation was that from  Virginia. It included George Washington, Patrick Henry, and Richard  Henry Lee. From Massachusetts came the two Adamses, John and Samuel.  From New York came John Jay. From Pennsylvania came John Dickinson. Of  all the greatest Americans only Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin  were absent.    [Illustration: CARPENTER'S HALL, PHILADELPHIA.]    [Sidenote: The American Association, 1774.]    128. The American Association, 1774.--It soon became clear that the  members of the Congress were opposed to any hasty action. They were not  willing to begin war with Great Britain. Instead of so doing they  adopted a Declaration of Rights and formed the American Association. The  Declaration of Rights was of slight importance. But the Association was  of great importance, as the colonies joining it agreed to buy no more  British goods. This policy was to be carried out by the Committees of  Correspondence. Any colony refusing to join the Association should be  looked upon as hostile \"to the liberties of this country,\" and treated  as an enemy. The American Association was the real beginning of the  American Union.    [Sidenote: Resistance throughout the colonies 1774-75.]    129. The Association carried out, 1774-75.--It was soon evident  that Congress in forming the Association had done precisely what the  people wished to have done. For instance, in Virginia committees were  chosen in every county. They examined the merchants' books. They  summoned before them persons suspected of disobeying \"the laws of  Congress.\" Military companies were formed in every county and carried  out the orders of the committees. The ordinary courts were entirely  disregarded. In fact, the royal government had come to an end in the  Old Dominion.    [Sidenote: Parliament punishes Massachusetts, 1774-75.]    130. More Punishment for Massachusetts, 1774-75.--George III and  his ministers refused to see that the colonies were practically united.  On the contrary, they determined to punish the people of Massachusetts  still further. Parliament passed acts forbidding the Massachusetts  fishermen to catch fish and forbidding the Massachusetts traders to  trade with the people of Virginia, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and all  foreign countries. The Massachusetts colonists were rebels, they should  be treated as rebels. General Gage was given more soldiers and ordered  to crush the rebellion.    [Sidenote: General Gage.]    [Sidenote: Opposed by the Massachusetts people.]    131. Gage in Massachusetts, 1774-75.--General Gage found he had a  good deal to do before he could begin to crush the rebellion. He had to  find shelter for his soldiers. He also had to find food for them. The  Boston carpenters would not work for him. He had to bring carpenters  from Halifax and New York to do his work. The farmers of eastern  Massachusetts were as firm as the Boston carpenters. They would not sell  food to General Gage. So he had to bring food from England and from  Halifax. He managed to buy or seize wood to warm the soldiers and hay to  feed his horses. But the boats bringing these supplies to Boston were  constantly upset in a most unlooked-for way. The colonists, on their  part, elected a Provincial Congress to take the place of the regular  government. The militia was reorganized, and military stores  gathered together.

Lexington and Concord, April 19, 1775.--Gage had said that  with ten thousand men he could march all over Massachusetts. In April,  1775, he began to crush the rebellion by sending a strong force to  Concord to destroy stores which his spies told him had been collected  there. The soldiers began their march in the middle of the night. But  Paul Revere and William Dawes were before them. \"The regulars are  coming,\" was the cry. At Lexington, the British found a few militiamen  drawn up on the village green. Some one fired and a few Americans were  killed. On the British marched to Concord. By this time the militiamen  had gathered in large numbers. It was a hot day. The regulars were  tired. They stopped to rest. Some of the militiamen attacked the  regulars at Concord, and when the British started on their homeward  march, the fighting began in earnest. Behind every wall and bit of  rising ground were militiamen. One soldier after another was shot down  and left behind. At Lexington the British met reinforcements, or they  would all have been killed or captured. Soon they started again. Again  the fighting began. It continued until the survivors reached a place of  safety under the guns of the warships anchored off Charlestown. The  Americans camped for the night at Cambridge and began the siege  of Boston.      QUESTIONS AND TOPICS      CHAPTER 11    Sec. 103.--_a_.

If you are yourself the performer, bear in mind that in music, as in  speech, \"brevity is the soul of wit.\" Two verses of a song, or four  pages of a piece, are at all times enough to give pleasure. If your  audience desire more they will ask for more; and it is infinitely more  flattering to be encored than to receive the thanks of your hearers,  not so much in gratitude for what you have given them, but in relief  that you have left off. You should try to suit your music, like your  conversation, to your company. A solo of Beethoven's would be as much  out of place in some circles as a comic song at a Quakers' meeting.  To those who only care for the light popularities, of the season, give  Balfe and Verdi, Glover and Jullien. To connoisseurs, if you perform  well enough to venture, give such music as will be likely to meet the  exigences of a fine taste. Above all, attempt nothing that you cannot  execute with ease and precision.    In retiring from a crowded party it is unnecessary that you should  seek out the hostess for the purpose of bidding her a formal good  night. By doing this you would, perhaps, remind others that it was  getting late, and cause the party to break up.    If you meet the lady of the house on your way to the drawing-room  door, take your leave of her as unobtrusively as possible, and slip  away without attracting the attention of her other guests.

Pardon, price _sixpence_.]           *       *       *       *       *    X.--THE DINNER TABLE.      To be acquainted with every detail of the etiquette pertaining to this  subject is of the highest importance to every gentleman. Ease, _savoir  faire_, and good breeding are nowhere more indispensable than at the  dinner-table, and the absence of them are nowhere more apparent.  How to eat soup and what to do with a cherry-stone are weighty  considerations when taken as the index of social status; and it is not  too much to say, that a man who elected to take claret with his fish,  or ate peas with his knife, would justly risk the punishment of  being banished from good society. As this subject is one of the  most important of which we have to treat, we may be pardoned for  introducing an appropriate anecdote related by the French poet  Delille:--    Delille and Marmontel were dining together in the month of April,  1786, and the conversation happened to turn upon dinner-table customs.  Marmontel observed how many little things a well-bred man was obliged  to know, if he would avoid being ridiculous at the tables of his  friends.    \"They are, indeed, innumerable,\" said Delille; \"and the most annoying  fact of all is, that not all the wit and good sense in the world can  help one to divine them untaught. A little while ago, for instance,  the Abbe Cosson, who is Professor of Literature at the College  Mazarin, was describing to me a grand dinner to which he had been  invited at Versailles, and to which he had sat down in the company of  peers, princes, and marshals of France.    \"'I'll wager, now,' said I, 'that you committed a hundred blunders in  the etiquette of the table!'    \"'How so?' replied the Abbe, somewhat nettled. 'What blunders could I  make? It seems to me that I did precisely as others did.'    \"'And I, on the contrary, would stake my life that you did nothing as  others did. But let us begin at the beginning, and see which is right.  In the first place there was your table-napkin--what did you do with  that when you sat down at table?'    \"'What did I do with my table-napkin? Why, I did like the rest of the  guests: I shook it out of the folds, spread it before me, and fastened  one corner to my button-hole.'    \"'Very well, _mon cher_; you were the only person who did so. No one  shakes, spreads, and fastens a table-napkin in that manner. You should  have only laid it across your knees. What soup had you?'    \"'Turtle.'    \"'And how did you eat it?'    \"'Like every one else, I suppose. I took my spoon in one hand, and my  fork in the other--'    \"'Your fork! Good heavens! None but a savage eats soup with a fork.  But go on. What did you take next?'    \"'A boiled egg.'    \"'Good and what did you do with the shell?'    \"'Not eat it certainly. I left it, of course, in the egg-cup.'    \"'Without breaking it through with your spoon?'    \"'Without breaking it.'    \"'Then, my dear fellow, permit me to tell you that no one eats an egg  without breaking the shell and leaving the spoon standing in it. And  after your egg?'    \"'I asked for some _bouilli_.'    \"'For _boulli_! It is a term that no one uses. You should have asked  for beef--never for _boulli_. Well, and after the _bouilli_?'    \"'I asked the Abbe de Radonvillais for some fowl.'    \"'Wretched man! Fowl, indeed! You should have asked for chicken or  capon. The word \"fowl\" is never heard out of the kitchen. But all this  applies only to what you ate; tell me something of what you drank, and  how you asked for it.'    \"'I asked for champagne and bordeaux from those who had the bottles  before them.'    \"'Know then, my good friend, that only a waiter, who has no time or  breath to spare, asks for champagne or bordeaux. A gentleman asks for  _vin de Champagne_ and _vin de Bordeaux_. And now inform me how you  ate your bread?'    \"'Undoubtedly like all the rest of the world. I cut it up into small  square pieces with my knife.'    \"'Then let me tell you that no one cuts bread. You should always break  it. Let us go on to the coffee. How did you drink yours?'    \"'Pshaw! At least I could make no mistake in that. It was boiling hot,  so I poured it, a little at a time, in the saucer, and drank it as it  cooled.'    \"'_Eh bien_! then you assuredly acted as no other gentleman in the  room. Nothing can be more vulgar than to pour tea or coffee into a  saucer. You should have waited till it cooled, and then have drank it  from the cup. And now you see, my dear cousin, that, so far from doing  precisely as others did, you acted in no one respect according to the  laws prescribed by etiquette.'\"    An invitation to dine should be replied to immediately, and  unequivocally accepted or declined. Once accepted, nothing but  an event of the last importance should cause you to fail in your  engagement.    To be exactly punctual is the strictest politeness on these occasions.  If you are too early, you are in the way; if too late, you spoil the  dinner, annoy the hostess, and are hated by the rest of the guests.  Some authorities are even of opinion that in the question of a  dinner-party \"never\" is better than \"late;\" and one author has gone  so far as to say, if you do not reach the house till dinner is served,  you had better retire to a restaurateur's, and thence send an apology,  and not interrupt the harmony of the courses by awkward excuses and  cold acceptance.    When the party is assembled, the mistress or master of the house will  point out to each gentleman the lady whom he is to conduct to table.  If she be a stranger, you had better seek an introduction; if a  previous acquaintance, take care to be near her when the dinner is  announced, offer your arm, and go down according to precedence  of rank. This order of precedence must be arranged by the host or  hostess, as the guests are probably unacquainted, and cannot know each  other's social rank.    When the society is of a distinguished kind, the host will do well to  consult Debrett or Burke, before arranging his visitors.    When rank is not in question, other claims to precedence must be  considered. The lady who is the greatest stranger should be taken  down by the master of the house, and the gentleman who is the greatest  stranger should conduct the hostess. Married ladies take precedence of  single ladies, elder ladies of younger ones, and so forth.    When dinner is announced, the host offers his arm to the lady of most  distinction, invites the rest to follow by a few words or a bow,  and leads the way. The lady of the house should then follow with the  gentleman who is most entitled to that honour, and the visitors follow  in the order that the master of the house has previously arranged. The  lady of the house frequently remains, however, till the last, that she  may see her guests go down in their prescribed order; but the plan is  not a convenient one. It is much better that the hostess should be in  her place as the guests enter the dining-room, in order that she may  indicate their seats to them as they come in, and not find them all  crowded together in uncertainty when she arrives.    The number of guests at a dinner-party should always be determined  by the size of the table. When the party is too small, conversation  flags, and a general air of desolation pervades the table. When they  are too many, every one is inconvenienced. A space of two feet should  be allowed to each person. It is well to arrange a party in such wise  that the number of ladies and gentlemen be equal.    It requires some tact to distribute your guests so that each shall  find himself with a neighbour to his taste; but as much of the success  of a dinner will always depend on this matter, it is worth some  consideration. If you have a wit, or a particularly good talker, among  your visitors, it is well to place him near the centre of the table,  where he can be heard and talked to by all. It is obviously a bad plan  to place two such persons in close proximity. They extinguish each  other. Neither is it advisable to assign two neighbouring seats to  two gentlemen of the same profession, as they are likely to fall  into exclusive conversation and amuse no one but themselves. A little  consideration of the politics, religious "]]]
