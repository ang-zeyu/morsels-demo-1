Then he invites  the company to make an offer of rent for such a desirable property under  a five years' lease, and as Elzevir and I are the only company present,  the bidding is soon done; for Elzevir offers a rent of 12 a year, which  has always been the value of the Why Not? The clerk makes a note of  this; but the business is not over yet, for we must wait till the pin  drops out of the candle before the lease is finally made out. So the men  fell to smoking to pass the time, till there could not have been more  than ten minutes' candle to burn, and Mr. Bailiff, with a glass of Ararat  milk in his hand, was saying, 'Tis a curious and fine tap of Hollands you  keep here, Master Block,' when in walked Mr. Maskew.    A thunderbolt would not have astonished me so much as did his appearance,  and Elzevir's face grew black as night; but the bailiff and clerk showed  no surprise, not knowing the terms on which persons in our village stood  to one another, and thinking it natural that someone should come in to  see the pin drop, and the end of an ancient custom. Indeed, Maskew seemed  to know the bailiff, for he passed the time of day with him, and was then  for sitting down at the table without taking any notice of Elzevir or me.  But just as he began to seat himself, Block shouted out, 'You are no  welcome visitor in my house, and I would sooner see your back than see  your face, but sit at this table you shall not.' I knew what he meant;  for on that table they had laid out David's body, and with that he struck  his fist upon the board so smart as to make the bailiff jump and nearly  bring the pin out of the candle.    'Heyday, sirs,' says Mr. Bailiff, astonished, 'let us have no brawling  here, the more so as this worshipful gentleman is a magistrate and  something of a friend of mine.' Yet Maskew refrained from sitting, but  stood by the bailiff's chair, turning white, and not red, as he did with  Mr. Glennie; and muttered something, that he had as lief stand as sit,  and that it should soon be Block's turn to ask sitting-room of _him_.    I was wondering what possibly could have brought Maskew there, when the  bailiff, who was ill at ease, said--'Come, Mr. Clerk, the pin hath but  another minute's hold; rehearse what has been done, for I must get this  lease delivered and off to Bridport, where much business waits.'    So the clerk read in a singsong voice that the property of the duchy of  Cornwall, called the Mohune Arms, an inn or tavern, with all its land,  tenements, and appurtenances, situate in the Parish of St. Sebastian,  Moonfleet, having been offered on lease for five years, would be let to  Elzevir Block at a rent of 12 per annum, unless anyone offered a higher  rent before the pin fell from the candle.    There was no one to make another offer, and the bailiff said to Elzevir,  'Tell them to have the horses round, the pin will be out in a minute, and  'twill save time.' So Elzevir gave the order, and then we all stood round  in silence, waiting for the pin to fall. The grease had burnt down to the  mark, or almost below it, as it appeared; but just where the pin stuck in  there was a little lump of harder tallow that held bravely out, refusing  to be melted. The bailiff gave a stamp of impatience with his foot under  the table as though he hoped thus to shake out the pin, and then a little  dry voice came from Maskew, saying--    'I offer 13 a year for the inn.'    This fell upon us with so much surprise, that all looked round, seeking  as it were some other speaker, and never thinking that it could be  Maskew. Elzevir was the first, I believe, to fully understand 'twas he;  and without turning to look at bailiff or Maskew, but having his elbows  on the table, his face between his hands, and looking straight out to  sea said in a sturdy voice, 'I offer 20.'    The words were scarce out of his mouth when Maskew caps them with 21,  and so in less than a minute the rent of the Why Not? was near doubled.  Then the bailiff looked from one to the other, not knowing what to make  of it all, nor whether 'twas comedy or serious, and said--    'Kind sir, I warn ye not to trifle; I have no time to waste in April  fooling, and he who makes offers in sport will have to stand to them  in earnest.'    But there was no lack of earnest in one at least of the men that he had  before him, and the voice with which Elzevir said 30 was still sturdy.  Maskew called 31 and 41, and Elzevir 40 and 50, and then I looked at  the candle, and saw that the head of the pin was no longer level, it had  sunk a little--a very little. The clerk awoke from his indifference, and  was making notes of the bids with a squeaking quill, the bailiff frowned  as being puzzled, and thinking that none had a right to puzzle him. As  for me, I could not sit still, but got on my feet, if so I might better  bear the suspense; for I understood now that Maskew had made up his mind  to turn Elzevir out, and that Elzevir was fighting for his home. _His_  home, and had he not made it my home too, and were we both to be made  outcasts to please the spite of this mean little man?    There were some more bids, and then I knew that Maskew was saying 91,  and saw the head of the pin was lower; the hard lump of tallow in Aunt  Jane's candle was thawing. The bailiff struck in: 'Are ye mad, sirs, and  you, Master Block, save your breath, and spare your money; and if this  worshipful gentleman must become innkeeper at any price, let him have the  place in the Devil's name, and I will give thee the Mermaid, at Bridport,  with a snug parlour, and ten times the trade of this.'    Elzevir seemed not to hear what he said, but only called out 100, with  his face still looking out to sea, and the same sturdiness in his voice.  Then Maskew tried a spring, and went to 120, and Elzevir capped him with  130, and 140, 150, 160, 170 followed quick. My breath came so fast  that I was almost giddy, and I had to clench my hands to remind myself of  where I was, and what was going on. The bidders too were breathing hard,  Elzevir had taken his head from his hands, and the eyes of all were on  the pin. The lump of tallow was worn down now; it was hard to say why the  pin did not fall. Maskew gulped out 180, and Elzevir said 190, and then  the pin gave a lurch, and I thought the Why Not? was saved, though at the  price of ruin. No; the pin had not fallen, there was a film that held it  by the point, one second, only one second. Elzevir's breath, which was  ready to outbid whatever Maskew said, caught in his throat with the  catching pin, and Maskew sighed out 200, before the pin pattered on the  bottom of the brass candlestick.    The clerk forgot his master's presence and shut his notebook with a bang,  'Congratulate you, sir,' says he, quite pert to Maskew; 'you are the  landlord of the poorest pothouse in the Duchy at 200 a year.'    The bailiff paid no heed to what his man did, but took his periwig  off and wiped his head. 'Well, I'm hanged,' he said; and so the Why  Not? was lost.    Just as the last bid was given, Elzevir half-rose from his chair, and  for a moment I expected to see him spring like a wild beast on Maskew;  but he said nothing, and sat down again with the same stolid look on his  face. And, indeed, it was perhaps well that he thus thought better of  it, for Maskew stuck his hand into his bosom as the other rose; and  though he withdrew it again when Elzevir got back to his chair, yet the  front of his waistcoat was a little bulged, and, looking sideways, I saw  the silver-shod butt of a pistol nestling far down against his white  shirt. The bailiff was vexed, I think, that he had been betrayed into  such strong words; for he tried at once to put on as indifferent an air  as might be, saying in dry tones, 'Well, gentlemen, there seems to be  here some personal matter into which I shall not attempt to spy. Two  hundred pounds more or less is but a flea-bite to the Duchy; and if you,  sir,' turning to Maskew, 'wish later on to change your mind, and be quit  of the bargain, I shall not be the man to stand in your way. In any  case, I imagine 'twill be time enough to seal the lease if I send it  from London.'    I knew he said this, and hinted at delay as wishing to do Elzevir a good  turn; for his clerk had the lease already made out pat, and it only  wanted the name and rent filled in to be sealed and signed. But, 'No,'  says Maskew, 'business is business, Mr. Bailiff, and the post uncertain  to parts so distant from the capital as these; so I'll thank you to make  out the lease to me now, and on May Day place me in possession.'    'So be it then,' said the bailiff a little testily, 'but blame me not for  driving hard bargains; for the Duchy, whose servant I am,' and he raised  his hat, 'is no daughter of the horse-leech. Fill in the figures, Mr.  Scrutton, and let us away.'    So Mr. Scrutton, for that was Mr. Clerk's name, scratches a bit with his  quill on the parchment sheet to fill in the money, and then Maskew  scratches his name, and Mr. Bailiff scratches his name, and Mr. Clerk  scratches again to witness Mr. Bailiff's name, and then Mr. Bailiff takes  from his mails a little shagreen case, and out from the case comes  sealing-wax and the travelling seal of the Duchy.    There was my aunt's best winter-candle still burning away in the  daylight, for no one had taken any thought to put it out; and Mr. Bailiff  melts the wax at it, till a drop of sealing-wax falls into the grease and  makes a gutter down one side, and then there is a sweating of the  parchment under the hot wax, and at last on goes the seal. 'Signed,  sealed, and delivered,' says Mr. Clerk, rolling up the sheet and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10745"],[0,"The Story of the Champions of the Round Table (#14)"],[1,"to thee yesterday, and his name is Sir  Peris of the Forest Sauvage. Below that castle, where the road leads into  that woodland, there doth he lurk to seize upon wayfarers who come  thitherward. And indeed he is a very catiff knight, for, though he is  strong and powerful, he doth not often attack other knights, but only  ladies and demoiselles who come hither. For these he may take captive  without danger to himself. For I believe that though he is so big of frame  yet is he a coward in his heart.\"    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot advises Croisette what to do] Then Sir Launcelot  sat for a while and regarded that castle, and fell into thought; and he  said, \"Damsel, if so be this knight is such a coward as thou sayest,  meseems that if I travel with thee I shall have some ado to come upon him;  because, if he sees me with thee, he may keep himself hidden in the thicket  of the forest from my sight. Now I will have it this way; do thou ride  along the highway in plain sight of the castle, and I will keep within the  woodland skirts, where I may have thee in sight and still be hidden from  the sight of others. Then if this knight assail thee, as I think it likely  he may do, I will come out and do battle with him ere he escapes.\"    So it was arranged as Sir Launcelot said and they rode in that wise:  Croisette rode along the highway, and Sir Launcelot rode under the trees in  the outskirts of the forest, where he was hidden from the eyes of anyone  who might be looking that way. So they went on for a long pass until they  came pretty nigh to where the castle was.    [Sidenote: Sir Peris attacks Croisette] Then, as they came to a certain  part of the road that dipped down toward a small valley, they were suddenly  aware of a great noise, and immediately there issued out from the forest a  knight, large and strong of frame, and followed close behind by a squire  dressed altogether in scarlet from head to foot. This knight bore down with  great speed upon where Croisette was, and the esquire followed close behind  him. When these two had come near to Croisette, the esquire leaped from off  his horse and caught her palfrey by the bridle, and the knight came close  to her and catched her as though to drag her off from her horse.    With that Croisette shrieked very loud, and immediately Sir Launcelot broke  out from the woods and rode down upon where all this was toward with a  noise like to thunder. As he came he cried aloud in a great and terrible  voice: \"Sir Knight, let go that lady, and turn thou to me and defend  thyself!\"    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot overthrows Sir Peris] Then Sir Peris of the  Forest Sauvage looked this way and that with intent to escape, but he was  aware that he could not escape from Sir Launcelot, wherefore he took his  shield in hand and drew his sword and put himself into a position of  defence; for, whereas he could not escape, he was, perforce, minded to do  battle. Then Sir Launcelot threw aside his spear, and he set his shield  before him and he took his sword in his hand, and he drave his horse  against Sir Peris. And when he had come nigh to Sir Peris he raised himself  in his stirrups and struck him such a buffet that I believe nothing in the  world could withstand its force. For though Sir Peris raised his shield  against that blow, yet the sword of Sir Launcelot smote through the shield  and it smote down the arm that held the shield, and it smote with such a  terrible force upon the helm of Sir Peris that Sir Peris fell down from his  horse and lay in a swoon without any motion at all.    Then Sir Launcelot leaped down from his horse and rushed off the helm of  Sir Peris, and lifted his sword with intent to strike off his head.    Upon that the senses of Sir Peris came somewhat back to him, and he set his  palms together and he cried out, though in a very weak voice: \"Spare me,  Sir Knight! I yield myself to thee!\"    \"Why should I spare thee?\" said Sir Launcelot.    \"Sir,\" said Sir Peris, \"I beseech thee, by thy knighthood, to spare me.\"    \"Well,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"since thou hast besought me upon my knighthood  I cannot do else than spare thee. But if I do spare thee, thou shalt have  to endure such shame that any true knight in thy stead would rather die  than be spared in such a manner.\"    \"Sir Knight,\" said Sir Peris, \"I am content with anything thou mayst do, so  be that thou wilt spare my life.\"    Upon this Sir Launcelot bade Sir Peris rise. And he took the halter of Sir  Peris's horse, and he bound Sir Peris's arms behind his back, and when he  had done this he drove him up to his castle at the point of his lance. And  when they came to the castle he bade Sir Peris have open the castle; and  Sir Peris did so; and thereupon Sir Launcelot and Sir Peris entered the  castle and the damsel and the squire followed after them.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot liberates the captive ladies] In that castle were  fourteen ladies of high degree held captive for ransom; and some of these  had been there for a considerable time, to their great discomfort. All  these were filled with joy when they were aware that Sir Launcelot had set  them free. So they came to Sir Launcelot and paid their court to him and  gave him great thanks beyond measure.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot gives the castle treasure to the captive ladies]  Sir Launcelot and Croisette abode in that castle all that night, and when  the next morning had come Sir Launcelot made search all over that castle,  and he found a considerable treasure of silver and gold, which had been  gathered there by the ransom of the ladies and the damsels of degree whom  Sir Peris had made prisoner aforetime. All this treasure Sir Launcelot  divided among those ladies who were prisoners, and a share of the treasure  he gave to the damsel Croisette, because that they two were such good  friends and because Croisette had brought him thither to that adventure,  and thereof Croisette was very glad. But Sir Launcelot kept none of that  treasure for himself.    Then Croisette said: \"How is this, Sir Launcelot? You have not kept any of  this treasure for yourself, yet you won it by your own force of arms,  wherefore it is altogether yours to keep if you will to do so.\"    \"Croisette,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"I do not care for such things as this  treasure; for when I lived within that lake of which I have spoken to thee,  such things as this treasure were there as cheap as pebbles which you may  gather up at any river-bed, wherefore it has come to pass that such things  have no value to me.\"    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot makes Sir Peris a dishonored captive] Now, after  all this had been settled, Sir Launcelot had Sir Peris of the Forest  Sauvage haled before him, and Sir Launcelot said: \"Catiff Knight, now is it  time for thy shame to come upon thee.\" Therewith he had Sir Peris stripped  of all armor and raiment, even to his jerkin and his hose, and he had his  arms tied behind his back, and he had a halter set about his neck; and Sir  Launcelot tied the halter that was about the neck of Sir Peris to the horn  of the saddle of his own horse, so that when he rode away with Croisette  Sir Peris must needs follow behind him at whatever gait the horse of Sir  Launcelot might take.    [Sidenote: Sir Hilaire sendeth Sir Peris to King Arthur] So Sir Launcelot  and Croisette rode back to the manor of Sir Hilaire of the Dale with Sir  Peris running behind them, and when they had come there Sir Launcelot  delivered Sir Peris unto Sir Hilaire, and Sir Hilaire had Sir Peris bound  upon a horse's back with his feet underneath the belly of the horse; and  sent him to Camelot for King Arthur to deal with him as might seem to the  King to be fit.    But Sir Launcelot remained with Sir Hilaire of the Dale all the next day  and he was very well content to be in that pleasant place. And upon the day  after that, which was Sunday, he set forth at about the prime of the day to  go to that abbey of monks where he had appointed to meet the damsel Elouise  the Fair, as aforetold.    And now you shall hear how Sir Launcelot behaved at the tournament of King  Bagdemagus, if it please you to read that which herewith immediately  followeth.    [Illustration: Sir Launcelot and Elouise the Fair]          Chapter Sixth      _How Sir Launcelot Took Part in the Tournament Between King Bagdemagus and  the King of North Wales, and How He Won that Battle for King Bagdemagus._    [Sidenote: How Sir Launcelot rode to find Elouise the Fair] Sir Launcelot  rode by many highways and many byways at a very slow pace, stopping now and  then when it pleased him to do so, for he took great joy in being free in  the open air again. For the day was warm and that time the clouds were very  thick, drifting in great abundance across the sky. And anon there would  fall a sudden shower of rain, and anon the sun would shine forth again,  very warm and strong, so that all the world sparkled as with incredible  myriads of jewels. Then the cock crowed lustily because the shower was  past, and another cock answered him far away, and all the world suddenly  smiled, and the water trickled everywhere, and the little hills clapped  their hands for joy. So Sir Launcelot took great pleasure in the day and he  went his way at so easy a pace that it was night-time ere he reached that  abbey of monks where he was to meet Elouise the Fair.    Now that evening Elouise was sitting in a certain apartment of the abbey  overlooking the court-yard, and a maiden was reading to her by the light of  several waxen tapers from a book of painted pictures. And the maiden read  in a voice that was both high and clear; meanwhile, Elouise sat very still  and listened to what she read. Now while Elouise the Fair sat so, there was  of a sudden the sound of a great horse coming on the stone pavement of the  court below. Therewith Elouise arose hastily and ran to the window and  looked down into that court-yard. Then she saw who he was"]]]
