The night passed uneventfully enough, if one excepts the mosquitoes  which seemed to get through the nets, making life miserable for all.  And once Tom thought he heard gruntings in the bush back of the tent,  which noises might, he imagined, have been caused by a bear. Toward  morning he heard an unearthly screech in the woods, and one of the  Indians, tending the fire, grunted out a word which meant pumas.    \"I can see it isn't going to be dull here,\" Tom mused, as he turned  over and tried to sleep.    Breakfast made them all feel better, and they set off on the final  stage of their journey.    \"If all goes well we'll be at the tunnel entrance and camp to-night,\"  said the contractor. \"This second half of the trip is the roughest.\"    There was no need of saying that, for it was perfectly evident. The  trail was a most precarious one, and only a mule or llama could have  traveled it. The mules were most sure-footed, but, as it was, one  slipped, and came near falling over a cliff.    But no real accident occurred, and finally, about an hour before  sunset, the cavalcade turned down the slope and emerged on a level  plain, which ended against the face of a great cliff.    As Tom rode nearer the cliff he could make out around it groups of rude  buildings, covered with corrugated iron.  There was quite a settlement  it seemed.    Then, in the face of the cliff there showed something black--like a  blot of ink, though more regular in outline.    \"The mouth of the tunnel,\" said Mr. Titus to Tom. \"Come on over to the  office and I'll introduce you to my brother. I guess he will be glad  we've arrived.\"    Tom dismounted from his mule, an example followed by the others.  Professor Bumper gazed up at the great mountains and murmured:    \"I wonder if the lost city of Pelone lies among them?\"    Suddenly the silence of the evening was broken by a dull, rumbling  sound.    \"Bless my court plaster!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"What's that?\"    \"A blast,\" answered Mr. Titus. \"But I never knew them to set off one so  late before. I hope nothing is wrong!\"    And, as he spoke, panic-stricken men began running out of the mouth of  the tunnel, while those outside hastened toward them, shouting and  calling.          Chapter XIII    Tom's Explosive      \"Something has happened!\" cried Mr. Titus as he ran forward, followed  by Tom, Mr. Damon and Koku. Professor Bumper started with them, but on  the way he saw a curious bit of rock which he stopped to pick up and  examine.    At the entrance of the tunnel, from which came rushing dirt-stained and  powder-blackened men, Mr. Titus was met by a man who seemed to be in  authority.    \"Hello, Job!\" he cried. \"Glad you're back. We're in trouble!\"    \"What's the matter?\" was the question. \"This is my brother Walter,\" he  said. \"This is Tom Swift and Mr. Damon,\" thus hurriedly he introduced  them. \"What happened, Walter?\"    \"Premature blast. Third one this week. Somebody is working against us!\"    \"Never mind that now,\" cried Job Titus. \"We must see to the poor  fellows who are hurt.\" \"I guess there aren't many,\" his brother said.  \"They were on their way out when the charge went off. Some more of  Blakeson & Grinder's work, I'll wager!\"    They were rushing in to the smoke-filled tunnel now, followed by Tom,  Mr. Damon and Koku, who would follow his young master anywhere. Tom saw  that the tunnel was lighted with incandescent lamps, suspended here and  there from the rocky roof or sides. The electric lights were supplied  with current from a dynamo run by a gasoline engine.    \"Where is it, Serato? Where was the blast?\" asked Walter Titus, of a  tall Indian, who seemed to be in some authority.    \"Back at second turn,\" was the answer, in fairly good English. \"I go  get beds.\"    \"He means stretchers,\" translated Job. \"That's our Peruvian foreman. A  good fellow, but easily scared.\"    They ran on into the tunnel, Tom and Mr. Damon noticing that a small  narrow-gage railroad was laid on the floor, mules being the motive  power to bring out the small dump cars loaded with rock and dirt,  excavated from the big hole.    \"Mind the turn!\" called Job Titus, who was ahead of Tom and Mr. Damon.  \"It's rough here.\"    Tom found it so, for he slipped over some pieces of rock, and would  have fallen had not Koku held him up.    \"Thanks,\" gasped Tom, as on he ran.    A little later he came to a place where a cluster of electric lights  gave better illumination, and he could see it was there that the damage  had been done.    A number of men were lying on the dirt and rock floor of the tunnel,  and some of them were bleeding. Others were staggering about as though  shocked or stunned.    \"We must get the injured ones out of here!\" cried Walter Titus. \"Where  are the men with stretchers?\"    \"I sint that Spalapeen Serato for thim!\" broke in a voice, rich in  Irish brogue. \"But he's thot stupid he might think I was after sindin'  him fer wather!\"    \"No, Tim. Serato is after the stretchers all right,\" said Walter. \"We  passed him on the way.\"    \"That's Tim Sullivan, our Irish foreman, though he has only a few of  his own kind to boss,\" explained Job Titus in a whisper.    Some of the workmen (all of whom save the few Irish referred to were  Peruvian Indians) had now recovered from their shock, or fright, and  began to help the Titus brothers, Tom, Mr. Damon and Koku in looking  after the injured. Of these there were five, only two of whom were,  seemingly, seriously hurt.    \"Me take them out,\" said Koku, and placing one gently over his left  shoulder, and the other over his right, out of the tunnel he stalked  with them, not waiting for the stretchers.    And it was well he did so, for one man was in need of an immediate  operation, which was performed at the rude hospital the contractors  maintained at the tunnel mouth. The other man died as Koku was carrying  him out, but the giant had saved one life.    Serato, the Indian foreman, with some of his men now came in, and the  other injured were carried out on stretchers, being attended to by the  two doctors who formed part of the tunnel force. Among a large body of  men some were always falling ill or getting hurt, and in that wild  country a doctor had to be kept near at hand.    When the excitement had died down, and it was found that one death  would be the total toll of the accident and that the premature blast  had done no damage to the tunnel, the two Titus brothers began to  consider matters.    Tom, Mr. Damon and the two contractors sat in the main office and  talked things over. Koku was eating supper, though the others had  finished, but, naturally, it took Koku twice as long as any one else.  Professor Bumper was busy transcribing material in his note-book.    \"Well, I'm glad you've come back, Job,\" said his brother.  \"Things have  been going at sixes and sevens here since you went to get some new kind  of blasting powder. By the way, I hope you got it, for we are  practically at a standstill.\"    \"Oh, I got it all right--some of Tom Swift's best--specially made for  us. And, better still, I've brought Tom back with me.\"    \"So I see. Well, I'm glad he's here.\"    \"Now what about this accident to-day?\" went on Job.    \"Well, as I said, it's the third this week. All of them seemed to be  premature blasts. But I've sent for some of the fuses used. I'm going  to get at the bottom of this. Here is Sullivan with them now. Come in,  Tim,\" he called, as the Irishman knocked at the door.    \"Are they the fuses used in the blasts?\" Walter asked.    \"They are, sor. An' they mostly burn five minutes, which is plenty of  time fer all th' min t' git out of danger. Only this time th' fuse  didn't seem to burn more than a minute, an' I lit it meself.\"    \"Let's see how long they burn now,\" suggested Job.    One of the longer fuses was lighted. It spluttered and smoked, while  the contractors timed it with their watches.    \"Four minutes!\" exclaimed Job. \"That's queer, and they're the regular  ten minute length. I wonder what this means.    He took up another fuse, and examined it closely.    \"Why!\" he cried. \"These aren't our fuses at all. They're another make,  and much more rapid in burning. No wonder you've been having premature  blasts. They go off in about half the time they should.\"    \"I can't understhand thot!\" said Tim, thoughtfully. \"I keep all the  fuses locked up, and only take thim out when I need thim.\"    \"Then somebody has been at your box, Tim, and they took out our regular  fuses and put in these quicker ones. It's a game to make trouble for us  among our men, and to damage the tunnel.\"    \"Bless my rubber boots!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Who would do a thing like  that?\"    \"Our rivals, perhaps, though I do not like to accuse any man on such  small evidence,\" said Walter. \"But we must adopt new measures.\"    \"And be very careful of the fuses,\" said Job.    \"Thot's what I will!\" declared Tim. \"I'll put th' supply in a new  place. No wonder there was blasts before th' min could git out th' way!  Bad cess t' th' imps thot did this!\" and he banged his big fist down on  the table.    Since the trouble began a guard had been always posted around the  tunnel entrance and surrounding buildings, and this night the patrol  was doubled. Tom, Mr. Damon and the two Titus brothers sat up quite  late, talking over plans and ideas.    Professor Bumper went to bed early, as he said he was going to set off  before sunrise to make a search for the lost city.    \"I regard him as more or less of a visionary,\" said Mr. Job Titus; \"but  he seems a harmless gentleman, and we'll do all we can to help him.\"    \"Surely,\" agreed his brother.

The grippers also had a sort of clawlike arrangement on either end,  working on the principle of an \"orange-peel\" shovel, and these claws  were designed to grip the earth to prevent slipping.    The spanners would be pulled out from their sockets on the side of the  tank by means of steel cables, which were operated from within. They  would be run out across the gap and fastened in place. The tank was  designed to travel along them to the other side of the gap, and, once  there, to pick up the girders, slip them back into place on the sides,  and the engine of war would travel on.    \"You are mightily excited, Tom.    \"I admit it, Ned. You see, I have not tried the grippers out except on  a small model. They worked there, but whether they will work in  practice remains to be seen. Of course, at this stage, I'm willing to  stake my all on the results, but there is always a half-question until  the final try-out under practical conditions.\"    \"Well, we'll soon see,\" said one of the workmen. \"Are you ready, Mr.  Swift?\"    \"All ready,\" answered Tom.    Tank A, as she was officially known, had come to a stop, as has been  said, on the very edge of Tinkle Creek. The banks were fairly solid  here, and descended precipitously to the water ten feet below. The  shores were about twenty feet apart.    \"Suppose the spanners break when you're halfway over, Tom?\" asked his  chum.    \"I don't like to suppose anything of the sort. But if they do, we're  going down!\"    \"Can you get up again?\"    \"That remains to be seen,\" was the non-committal reply.  \"Well, here  goes, anyhow!\"    Going up into the observation tower, which was only slightly raised  above the roof of the highest part of the tank, Tom gave the signal for  the motors to start. There was a trembling throughout the whole of the  vast structure. Tom threw back a lever and Ned, peering from a side  observation slot, beheld a strange sight.    Like the main arm of some great steam shovel, two long, latticed  girders of steel shot out from the sides of the tank. They gave a half  turn, as they were pulled forward by the steel ropes, so that they lay  with their broader surfaces uppermost.    Straight across the stream they were pulled, their clawlike ends coming  to a rest on the opposite bank. Then they were tightened into place by  a backward pull on the operating cables, and Tom, with a sigh of  relief, announced:    \"Well, so far so good!\"    \"Do we go over now?\" inquired Ned.    \"Over the top--yes, I hope,\" answered Tom, with a laugh.  \"How about  you down there?\" he called to the engine room through a telephone which  could only be used when the machinery was not in action, there being  too much noise to permit the use of any but visual signals after that.    \"All right,\" came back the answer. \"We're ready when you are.\"    \"Then here we go!\" said Tom. \"Hold fast, Ned! Of course there's no real  telling what will happen, though I believe we'll come out of it alive.\"    \"Cheerful prospect,\" murmured Ned.    The grippers were now in place. It only remained for the tank to propel  herself over them, pick them up on the other side of Tinkle Creek, and  proceed on her course.    Tom Swift hesitated a moment, one hand on the starting lever and the  other on the steering wheel. Then, with a glance at Ned, half whimsical  and half resolute, Tom started Tank A on what might prove to be her  last journey.    Slowly the ponderous caterpillar belts moved around on the sprocket  wheels. They ground with a clash of steel on the surface of the  spanners. So long was the tank that the forward end, or the \"nose,\" was  halfway across the stream before the bottom part of the endless belts  gripped the latticed bridge.    \"If we fall, we'll span the creek, not fall into it,\" murmured Ned, as  he looked from the observation slot.    \"That's what I counted on,\" Tom said. \"We'll get out, even if we do  fall.\"    But Tank A was not destined to fall. In another moment her entire  weight rested on the novel and transportable bridge Tom Swift had  evolved. Then, as the gripping ends of the girders sank farther into  the soil, the tank went on her way.    Slowly, at half speed, she crawled over the steel beams, making  progress over the creek and as safely above the water as though on a  regularly constructed bridge.    On and on she went. Now her entire weight was over the middle of the  temporary structures. If they were going to give way at all, it would  be at this point. But they did not give. The latticed and triangular  steel, than which there is no stronger form of construction, held up  the immense weight of Tank A, and on this novel bridge she propelled  herself across Tinkle Creek.    \"Well, the worst is over,\" remarked Ned, as he saw the nose of the tank  project beyond the farthermost bank.    \"Yes, even if they collapse now nothing much can happen,\" Tom answered.  \"It won't be any worse than wallowing down into a trench and out again.  But I think the spanners will hold.\"    And hold they did! They held, giving way not a fraction of an inch,  until the tank was safely across, and then, after a little delay, due  to a jamming of one of the recovery cables, the spanners were picked  up, slid into the receiving sockets, and the great war engine was ready  to proceed again.    \"Hurrah!\" cried Ned. \"She did it, Tom, old man!\" and he clapped his  chum resoundingly on the back.    \"She certainly did!\" was the answer. \"But you needn't knock me apart  telling me that. Go easy!\"    \"Bless my apple pie!\" cried Mr. Damon, who was as much pleased as  either of the boys, \"this is what I call great!\"    \"Yes, she did all that I could have hoped for,\" said Tom.  \"Now for the  next test.\"    \"Bless my collar button! is there another?\"    \"Just down into a trench and out again.\" Tom said. \"This is  comparatively simple. It's only what she'll have to do every day in  Flanders.\"    The tank waddled on. A duck's sidewise walk is about the only kind of  motion that can be compared to it. The going was easier now, for it was  across a big field, and Tom told his friends that at the other end was  a deep, steep and rocky ravine in which he had decided to give the tank  another test.    \"We'll imagine that ravine is a trench,\" he said, \"and that we've got  to get on the other side of it. Of course, we won't be under fire, as  the tanks will be at the front, but aside from that the test will be  just as severe.\"    A little later Tank A brought her occupants to the edge of the \"trench.\"    \"Now, little girl,\" cried Tom exultingly, patting the rough steel side  of his tank, \"show them what you can do!\"    \"Bless my plum pudding!\" cried Mr. Damon, \"are you really going down  there, Tom Swift?\"    \"I am,\" answered the young inventor. \"It won't be dangerous. We'll  crawl down and crawl out. Hold fast!\"    He steered the machine straight for the edge of the ravine, and as the  nose slipped over and the broad steel belts bit into the earth the tank  tilted downward at a sickening angle.    She appeared to be making the descent safely, when there was a sudden  change. The earth seemed to slip out from under the broad caterpillar  belts, and then the tank moved more rapidly.    \"Tom, we're turning over!\" shouted Ned. \"We're capsizing!\"          Chapter XIV    The Ruined Factory      Only too true were the words Ned Newton shouted to his chum. Tank A was  really capsizing. She had advanced to the edge of the gully and started  down it, moving slowly on the caterpillar bands of steel. Then had come  a sudden lurch, caused, as they learned afterward, by the slipping off  of a great quantity of shale from an underlying shelf of rock.    This made unstable footing for the tank. One side sank lower than the  other, and before Tom could neutralize this by speeding up one motor  and slowing down the other the tank slowly turned over on its side.    \"But she isn't going to stop here!\" cried Ned, as he found himself  thrown about like a pill in a box. \"We're going all the way over!\"    \"Let her go over!\" cried Tom, not that he could stop the tank now. \"It  won't hurt her. She's built for just this sort of thing!\"    And over Tank A did go. Over and over she rolled, sidewise, tumbling  and sliding down the shale sides of the great gully.    \"Hold fast! Grab the rings!\" cried Tom to his two companions in the  tower with him. \"That's what they're for!\"    Ned and Mr. Damon understood. In fact, the latter had already done as  Tom suggested. The young inventor had read that the British tanks  frequently turned turtle, and he had this in mind when he made  provision in his own for the safety of passengers and crew.    As soon as he felt the tank careening, Tom had pressed the signal  ordering the motors stopped, and now only the force of gravity was  operating. But that was sufficient to carry the big machine to the  bottom of the gulch, whither she slid with a great cloud of sand, shale  and dust.    \"Bless my--bless my--\" Mr. Damon was murmuring, but he was so flopped  about, tossed from one side to the other, and it took so much of his  attention and strength to hold on to the safety ring, that he could not  properly give vent; to one of his favorite expressions.    But there comes an end to all things, even to the descent of a tank,  and Tom's big machine soon stopped rolling, sliding, and turning  improvised somersaults, and rested in a pile of soft shale at the  bottom of the gully. And the tank was resting on her back!    \"We've turned turtle!\" cried Ned, as he noted that he was standing on  what, before, had been the ceiling of the observation tower. But as  everything was of steel, and as there was no movable furniture, no  great harm was done. In fact, one could as well walk on the ceiling of  the tank as on the floor.    \"But how are you going to get her right side up?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"Oh, turning upside down is only one of the stunts of the game. I can  right her,\" was "]]]
