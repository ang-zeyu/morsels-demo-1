Why, she knows the color of your hair and eyes,  and she knows the pattern of that horsehair hat-band and the size of  your boots--she _admires_ a man whose feet haven't two or three inches  for every foot of his height--she says you wear fives, and you don't  lack much of being six feet tall, and--\"    \"Oh, for Heaven's sake!\" protested Billy, very red and uncomfortable.  \"What have I done to yuh that you throw it into me like that? My hands  are up--and they'll stay up if you'll only quit it.\"    Miss Bridger looked at him sidelong and laughed to herself. \"That's to  pay you for forgetting that you ever met Mama Joy,\" she asserted. \"I  shouldn't be surprised if next week you'll have forgotten that you  ever met _me_. And if you do, after that chicken stew--\"    \"You're a josher,\" said Billy helplessly, not being prepared to say  just all he thought about the possibility of his forgetting her. He  wished that he understood women better, so that he might the better  cope with the vagaries of this one; and so great was his ignorance  that he never dreamed that every man since Adam had wished the same  thing quite as futilely.    \"I'm not going to josh now,\" she promised, with a quick change of  manner. \"You haven't--I _know_ you haven't, but I'll give you a chance  to dissemble--you haven't a partner for the dance, have you?\"    \"No. Have you?\" Billy did have the courage to say that, though he  dared not say more.    \"Well, I--I could be persuaded,\" she hinted shamelessly.    \"Persuade nothing! Yuh belong to me, and if anybody tries to throw  his loop over your head, why--\" Billy looked dangerous; he meant the  Pilgrim.    \"Thank you.\" She seemed relieved, and it was plain she did not read  into his words any meaning beyond the dance, though Billy was secretly  hoping that she would. \"Do you know, I think you're perfectly lovely.  You're so--so _comfortable_. When I've known you a little longer  I expect I'll be calling you Charming Billy, or else Billy Boy. If  you'll stick close to me all through this dance and come every time I  lift my eyebrows this way\"--she came near getting kissed, right then,  but she never knew it--\"and say it's _your_ dance and that I promised  it to you before, I'll be--_awfully_ grateful and obliged.\"    \"I wisht,\" said Billy pensively, \"I had the nerve to take all this for  sudden admiration; but I savvy, all right. Some poor devil's going to  get it handed to him to-night.\"    For the first time Miss Bridger blushed consciously. \"I--well, you'll  be good and obliging and do just what I want, won't you?\"    \"Sure!\" said Billy, not trusting himself to say more. Indeed, he had  to set his teeth hard on that word to keep more from tumbling out.  Miss Bridger seemed all at once anxious over something.    \"You waltz and two-step and polka and schottische, don't you?\" Her  eyes, as she looked up at him, reminded Billy achingly of that time  in the line-camp when she asked him for a horse to ride home. They had  the same wistful, pleading look. Billy gritted his teeth.    \"Sure,\" he answered again.    Miss Bridger sighed contentedly. \"I know it's horribly mean and  selfish of me, but you're so good--and I'll make it up to you some  time. Really I will! At some other dance you needn't dance with me  once, or look at me, even--That will even things up, won't it?\"    \"Sure,\" said Billy for the third time.    They paced slowly, coming into view of the picnic crowd, hearing  the incoherent murmur of many voices. Miss Bridger looked at him  uncertainly, laughed a little and spoke impulsively. \"You needn't do  it, Mr. Boyle, unless you like. It's only a joke, anyway; I mean,  my throwing myself at you like that. Just a foolish joke; I'm often  foolish, you know. Of course, I know you wouldn't misunderstand or  anything like that, but it _is_ mean of me to drag you into it by the  hair of the head, almost, just to play a joke on some one--on Mama  Joy. You're too good-natured. You're a direct temptation to people who  haven't any conscience. Really and truly, you needn't do it at all.\"    \"Yuh haven't heard me raising any howl, have yuh?\" inquired Billy,  eying her slantwise. \"I'm playing big luck, if yuh ask me.\"    \"Well--if you _really_ don't mind, and haven't any one else--\"    \"I haven't,\" Billy assured her unsmilingly. \"And I really don't mind.  I think I--kinda like the prospect.\" He was trying to match her mood  and he was not at all sure that he was a success. \"There's one  thing. If yuh get tired uh having me under your feet all the time,  why--Dilly's a stranger and an awful fine fellow; I'd like to have  you--well, be kinda nice to him. I want him to have a good time, you  see, and you'll like him. You can't help it. And it will square up  anything yuh may feel yuh might owe me--\"    \"I'll be just lovely to Dilly,\" Miss Bridger promised him with  emphasis. \"It will be a fair bargain, then, and I won't feel so--so  small about asking you what I did. You can help me play a little joke,  and I'll dance with Duly. So,\" she finished in a tone of satisfaction,  \"we'll be even. I feel a great deal better now, because I can pay you  back.\"    Billy, on that night, was more keenly observant than usual and there  was much that he saw. He saw at once that Miss Bridger lifted her  eyebrows in the way she had demonstrated as _this way_, whenever the  Pilgrim approached her. He saw that the Pilgrim was looking extremely  bloodthirsty and went out frequently--Billy guessed shrewdly that his  steps led to where the drink was not water--and the sight cheered  him considerably. Yet it hurt him a little to observe that, when the  Pilgrim was absent or showed no sign of meaning to intrude upon her,  Miss Bridger did not lift her eyebrows consciously. Still, she was at  all times pleasant and friendly and he tried to be content.    \"Mr. Boyle, you've been awfully good,\" she rewarded him when it  was over. \"And I think Mr. Dill is fine! Do you know, he waltzes  beautifully. I'm sure it was easy to keep _my_ side of the bargain.\"    Billy noticed the slight, inquiring emphasis upon the word _my_, and  he smiled down reassuringly into her face. \"Uh course mine was pretty  hard,\" he teased, \"but I hope I made good, all right.\"    \"You,\" she said, looking steadily up at him, \"are just exactly what I  said you were. You are comfortable.\"    Billy did a good deal of thinking while he saddled Barney in the gray  of the morning, with Dill at a little distance, looking taller than  ever in the half light. When he gave the saddle its final, little  tentative shake and pulled the stirrup around so that he could stick  in his toe, he gave also a snort of dissatisfaction.    \"Hell!\" he said to himself. \"I don't know as I care about being too  _blame_ comfortable. There's a limit to that kinda thing--with _her!_\"    \"What's that?\" called Dill, who had heard his voice.    \"Aw, nothing,\" lied Billy, swinging up. \"I was just cussing my hoss.\"          CHAPTER XII.    _Dilly Hires a Cook._      It is rather distressful when one cannot recount all sorts of exciting  things as nicely fitted together as if they had been carefully planned  and rehearsed beforehand. It would have been extremely gratifying and  romantic if Charming Billy Boyle had dropped everything in the line of  work and had ridden indefatigably the trail which led to Bridger's;  it would have been exciting if he had sought out the Pilgrim and  precipitated trouble and flying lead. But Billy, though he might have  enjoyed it, did none of those things. He rode straight to the ranch  with Dill--rather silent, to be sure, but bearing none of the marks  of a lovelorn young man--drank three cups of strong coffee with four  heaping teaspoonfuls of sugar to each cup, pulled off his boots, lay  down upon the most convenient bed and slept until noon. When the smell  of dinner assailed his nostrils he sat up yawning and a good deal  tousled, drew on his boots and made him a cigarette. After that he ate  his dinner with relish, saddled and rode away to where the round-up  was camped, his manner utterly practical and lacking the faintest  tinge of romance. As to his thoughts--he kept them jealously to  himself.    He did not even glimpse Miss Bridger for three months or more. He was  full of the affairs of the Double-Crank; riding in great haste to the  ranch or to town, hurrying back to the round-up and working much as  he used to work, except that now he gave commands instead of receiving  them. For they were short-handed that summer and, as he explained to  Dill, he couldn't afford to ride around and look as important as he  felt.    \"Yuh wait, Dilly, till we get things running the way I want 'em,\"  he encouraged on one of his brief calls at the ranch. \"I was kinda  surprised to find things wasn't going as smooth as I used to think;  when yuh haven't got the whole responsibility on your own shoulders,  yuh don't realize what a lot of things need to be done. There's them  corrals, for instance: I helped mend and fix and toggle 'em, but  it never struck me how rotten they are till I looked 'em over this  spring. There's about a million things to do before snow flies, or we  won't be able to start out fresh in the spring with everything running  smooth. And if I was you, Dilly, I'd go on a still hunt for another  cook here at the ranch. This coffee's something fierce. I had my  doubts about Sandy when we hired him. He always did look to me like he  was built for herding sheep more than he was for cooking.\" This was in  August.    \"I have been thinking seriously of getting some one else in his  place,\" Dill answered, in his quiet way. \"There isn't very much to do  here; if some one came who would take an interest and cook just what  we wanted--I will own I have no taste for that peculiar mixture which  Sandy calls 'Mulligan,' and I have frequently told him so. Yet he  insists upon serving it twice a day. He says it uses up the scraps;  but since it is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12225"],[0,"Tales of lonely trails (#14)"],[1,"tallion. He doesn't look afraid,\"  said Jones, who never knew when he was beaten.    Emett gazed at Jones as if he had not heard right.    \"Go ahead, try the stallion. I like the way he looks.\"    No wonder! The big stallion looked a king of horses--just what he  would have been if Emett had not taken him, when a colt, from his wild  desert brothers. He scented the lions, and he held his proud head up,  his ears erect, and his large, dark eyes shone fiery and expressive.    \"I'll try to lead him in and let him see the lions. We can't fool  him,\" said Emett.    Marc showed no hesitation, nor anything we expected. He stood  stiff-legged, and looked as if he wanted to fight.    \"He's all right; he'll pack them,\" declared Jones.    The packsaddle being strapped on and the panniers hooked to the horns,  Jones and Jim lifted Tom and shoved him down into the left pannier  while Emett held the horse. A madder lion than Tom never lived. It was  cruel enough to be lassoed and disgrace enough to be \"hog-tied,\" as  Jim called it, but to be thrust down into a bag and packed on a horse  was adding insult to injury. Tom frothed at the mouth and seemed like  a fizzing torpedo about to explode. The lioness being considerably  longer and larger, was with difficulty gotten into the other pannier,  and her head and paws hung out. Both lions kept growling and snarling.    \"I look to see Marc bolt over the rim,\" said Emett, resignedly, as  Jones took up the end of the rope halter.    \"No siree!\" sang out that worthy. \"He's helping us out; he's proud to  show up the other nags.\"    Jones was always asserting strange traits in animals, and giving them  intelligence and reason. As to that, many incidents coming under my  observation while with him, and seen with his eyes, made me incline to  his claims, the fruit of a lifetime with animals.    Marc packed the lions to camp in short order, and, quoting Jones,  \"without turning a hair.\" We saw the Navajo's head protruding from a  tree. Emett yelled for him, and Jones and Jim \"hahaed\" derisively;  whereupon the black head vanished and did not reappear. Then they  unhooked one of the panniers and dumped out the lioness. Jones  fastened her chain to a small pine tree, and as she lay powerless he  pulled out the stick back of her canines. This allowed the wire muzzle  to fall off. She signalled this freedom with a roar that showed her  health to be still unimpaired. The last action in releasing her from  her painful bonds Jones performed with sleight-of-hand dexterity. He  slipped the loop fastening one paw, which loosened the rope, and in a  twinkling let her work all of her other paws free. Up she sprang, ears  flat, eyes ablaze, mouth wide, once more capable of defense, true to  her instinct and her name.    Before the men lowered Tom from Marc's back I stepped closer and put  my face within six inches of the lion's. He promptly spat on me. I had  to steel my nerve to keep so close. But I wanted to see a wild lion's  eyes at close range. They were exquisitely beautiful, their physical  properties as wonderful as their expression. Great half globes of  tawny amber, streaked with delicate wavy lines of black, surrounding  pupils of intense purple fire. Pictures shone and faded in the amber  light--the shaggy tipped plateau, the dark pines and smoky canyons,  the great dotted downward slopes, the yellow cliffs and crags. Deep in  those live pupils, changing, quickening with a thousand vibrations,  quivered the soul of this savage beast, the wildest of all wild  Nature, unquenchable love of life and freedom, flame of defiance and  hate.    Jones disposed of Tom in the same manner as he had the lioness,  chaining him to an adjoining small pine, where he leaped and wrestled.    Presently I saw Emett coming through the woods leading and dragging  the Indian. I felt sorry for the Navvy, for I felt that his fear was  not so much physical as spiritual. And it seemed no wonder to me that  the Navvy should hang back from this sacrilegious treatment of his  god. A natural wisdom, which I had in common with all human beings who  consider self preservation the first law of life, deterred me from  acquainting my august companions with my belief. At least I did not  want to break up the camp.    In the remorseless grasp of Emett, forced along, the Navajo dragged  his feet and held his face sidewise, though his dark eyes gleamed  at the lions. Terror predominated among the expressions of his  countenance. Emett drew him within fifteen feet and held him there,  and with voice, and gesticulating of his free hand, tried to show the  poor fellow that the lions would not hurt him.    Navvy stared and muttered to himself. Here Jim had some deviltry in  mind, for he edged up closer; but what it was never transpired, for  Emett suddenly pointed to the horses and said to the Indian:    \"_Chineago_ (feed).\"    It appeared when Navvy swung himself over Marc's broad back, that our  great stallion had laid aside his transiently noble disposition and  was himself again. Marc proceeded to show us how truly Jim had spoken:  \"Shore he ain't no use for the redskin.\" Before the Indian had fairly  gotten astride, Marc dropped his head, humped his shoulders, brought  his feet together and began to buck. Now the Navajo was a famous  breaker of wild mustangs, but Marc was a tougher proposition than the  wildest mustang that ever romped the desert. Not only was he unusually  vigorous; he was robust and heavy, yet exceedingly active. I had seen  him roll over in the dust three times each way, and do it easily--a  feat Emett declared he had never seen performed by another horse.    Navvy began to bounce. He showed his teeth and twisted his sinewy  hands in the horse's mane. Marc began to act like a demon; he plowed  the ground; apparently he bucked five feet straight up. As the Indian  had bounced he now began to shoot into the air. He rose the last time  with his heels over his head, to the full extent of his arms; and on  plunging down his hold broke. He spun around the horse, then went  hurtling to the ground some twenty feet away. He sat up, and seeing  Emett and Jones laughing, and Jim prostrated with joy, he showed his  white teeth in a smile and said:    \"No bueno dam.\"    I think all of us respected Navvy for his good humor, and especially  when he walked up to Marc, and with no show of the mean Indian,  patted the glossy neck and then nimbly remounted. Marc, not being so  difficult to please as Jim in the way of discomfiting the Navajo,  appeared satisfied for the present, and trotted off down the hollow,  with the string of horses ahead, their bells jingling.    Camp-fire tasks were a necessary wage in order to earn the full  enjoyment and benefit of the hunting trip; and looking for some task  with which to turn my hand, I helped Jim feed the hounds. To feed  ordinary dogs is a matter of throwing them a bone; however, our dogs  were not ordinary. It took time to feed them, and a prodigious amount  of meat. We had packed between three and four hundred pounds of  wild-horse meat, which had been cut into small pieces and strung on  the branches of a scrub oak near camp.    Don, as befitted a gentleman and the leader of the greatest pack in  the West, had to be fed by hand. I believe he would rather had starved  than have demeaned himself by fighting. Starved he certainly would  have, if Jim had thrown meat indiscriminately to the ground. Sounder  asserted his rights and preferred large portions at a time. Jude  begged with great solemn eyes but was no slouch at eating for all her  gentleness. Ranger, because of imperfectly developed teeth rendering  mastication difficult, had to have his share cut into very small  pieces. As for Moze--well, great dogs have their faults as do great  men--he never got enough meat; he would fight even poor crippled Jude,  and steal even from the pups; when he had gotten all Jim would give  him, and all he could snatch, he would growl away with bulging sides.    \"How about feeding the lions?\" asked Emett.    \"They'll drink to-night,\" replied Jones, \"but won't eat for days; then  we'll tempt them with fresh rabbits.\"    We made a hearty meal, succeeding which Jones and I walked through  the woods toward the rim. A yellow promontory, huge and glistening,  invited us westward, and after a detour of half a mile we reached it.  The points of the rim, striking out into the immense void, always drew  me irresistibly. We found the view from this rock one of startling  splendor. The corrugated rim-wall of the middle wing extended to the  west, at this moment apparently running into the setting sun. The gold  glare touching up the millions of facets of chiseled stone, created  color and brilliance too glorious and intense for the gaze of men. And  looking downward was like looking into the placid, blue, bottomless  depths of the Pacific.    \"Here, help me push off this stone,\" I said to Jones. We heaved a huge  round stone, and were encouraged to feel it move. Fortunately we had a  little slope; the boulder groaned, rocked and began to slide. Just as  it toppled over I glanced at the second hand of my watch. Then with  eyes over the rim we waited. The silence was the silence of the  canyon, dead and vast, intensified by our breathless earstrain. Ten  long palpitating seconds and no sound! I gave up. The distance was too  great for sound to reach us. Fifteen seconds--seventeen--eighteen--    With that a puff of air seemed to rise, and on it the most awful  bellow of thunderous roar. It rolled up and widened, deadened to burst  out and roll louder, then slowly, like mountains on wheels, rumbled  under the rim-walls, passing on and on, to roar back in echo from the  cliffs of the mesas. Roar and rumble--roar and rumble! for two long  moments the dull and hollow echoes rolled at us, to die away slowly in  the far-distant canyons.    \"That's a darned deep hole,\" commented Jones.    Twilight stole down on"]]]
