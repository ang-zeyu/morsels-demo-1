Quinby favoured me with a narrow though a sidelong look; the room was  very full, and in the general chit-chat, punctuated by the constant  clicking of the heavy balls, there was very little danger of our being  overheard. But Quinby was careful to lower his voice.    \"It's perfectly true,\" said he, \"if you mean about her being divorced.\"    \"Yes, that was what I heard; but who started the report?\"    \"Who started it. You may well ask! Who starts anything in a place like  this? Ah, good shot, Sir John, good shot!\"    \"Never mind the good shots, Quinby. I really rather want to talk to you  about this. I sha'n't keep you long.\"    \"Talk away, then. I am listening.\"    \"Mrs. Lascelles and I are rather friends.\"    \"So I can see.\"    \"Very well, then, I want to know who started all this. It may be  perfectly true, as you say, but who found it out? If you can't tell me  I must ask somebody else.\"    The ruddy Alpine colouring had suddenly become accentuated in the case  of Quinby.    \"As a matter of fact,\" said he, \"it was I who first heard of it, quite  by chance. You can't blame me for that, Clephane.\"    \"Of course not,\" said I encouragingly.    \"Well, unfortunately I let it out; and you know how things get about in  an hotel.\"    \"It was unfortunate,\" I agreed. \"But how on earth did you come to hear?\"    Quinby hummed and hawed; he had heard from a soldier friend, a man who  had known her in India, a man whom I knew myself, in fact Hamilton the  sapper, who had telegraphed to Quinby to secure me my room. I ought to  have been disarmed by the coincidence; but I recalled our initial  conversation, about India and Hamilton and Mrs. Lascelles, and I could  not consider it a coincidence at all.    \"You don't mean to tell me,\" said I, aping the surprise I might have  felt, \"that our friend wrote and gave Mrs. Lascelles away to you of his  own accord?\"    But Quinby did not vouchsafe an answer. \"Hard luck, Sir John!\" cried  he, as the judge missed an easy cannon, leaving his opponent a still  easier one, which lost him the game. I proceeded to press my question in  a somewhat stronger form, though still with all the suavity at my  command.    \"Surely,\" I urged, \"you must have written to ask him about her first?\"    \"That's my business, I fancy,\" said Quinby, with a peculiarly aggressive  specimen of the nasal snigger of which enough was made in a previous  chapter, but of which Quinby himself never tired.    \"Quite,\" I agreed; \"but do you also consider it your business to inquire  deliberately into the past life of a lady whom I believe you only know  by sight, and to spread the result of your inquiries broadcast in the  hotel? Is that your idea of chivalry? I shall ask Sir John Sankey  whether it is his,\" I added, as the judge joined us with genial  condescension, and I recollected that his proverbial harshness toward  the male offender was redeemed by an extraordinary sympathy with the  women. Thereupon I laid a general case before Sir John, asking him  point-blank whether he considered such conduct as Quinby's (but I did  not say whose the conduct was) either justifiable in itself or conducive  to the enjoyment of a holiday community like ours.    \"It depends,\" said the judge, cocking a critical eye on the now furious  Quinby. \"I am afraid we most of us enjoy our scandal, and for my part I  always like to see a humbug catch it hot. But if the scandal's about a  woman, and if it's an old scandal, and if she's a lonely woman, that  quite alters the case, and in my opinion the author of it deserves all  he gets.\"    At this Quinby burst out, with an unrestrained heat that did not lower  him in my estimation, though the whole of his tirade was directed  exclusively against me. I had been talking \"at\" him, he declared. I  might as well have been straightforward while I was about it. He, for  his part, was not afraid to take the responsibility for anything he  might have said. It was perfectly true, to begin with. The so-called  Mrs. Lascelles, who was such a friend of mine, had been the wife of a  German Jew in Lahore, who had divorced her on her elopement with a  Major Lascelles, whom she had left in his turn, and whose name she had  not the smallest right to bear. Quinby exercised some restraint in the  utterances of these calumnies, or the whole room must have heard them,  but even as it was we had more listeners than the judge when my turn  came.    \"I won't give you the lie, Quinby, because I am quite sure you don't  know you are telling one,\" said I; \"but as a matter of fact you are  giving currency to two. In the first place, this lady is Mrs. Lascelles,  for the major did marry her; in the second place, Major Lascelles is  dead.\"    \"And how do you know?\" inquired Quinby, with a touch of genuine surprise  to mitigate an insolent disbelief.    \"You forget,\" said I, \"that it was in India I knew your own informant. I  can only say that my information in all this matter is a good deal  better than his. I knew Mrs. Lascelles herself quite well out there; I  knew the other side of her case. It doesn't seem to have struck you,  Quinby, that such a woman must have suffered a good deal before, and  after, taking such a step. Or I don't suppose you would have spread  yourself to make her suffer a little more,\"    And I still consider that a charitable view of his behaviour; but Quinby  was of another opinion, which he expressed with his offensive little  laugh as he lifted his long body from the settee.    \"This is what one gets for securing a room for a man one doesn't know!\"  said he.    \"On the contrary,\" I retorted, \"I haven't forgotten that, and I have  saved you something because of it. I happen to have saved you no less  than a severe thrashing from a stronger man than myself, who is even  more indignant with you than I am, and who wanted to borrow one of my  sticks for the purpose!\"    \"And it would have served him perfectly right,\" was the old judge's  comment, when the mischief-maker had departed without returning my  parting shot. \"I suppose you meant young Evers, Captain Clephane?\"    \"I did indeed, Sir John. I had to tell him the truth in order to  restrain him.\"    The old judge raised his eyebrows.    \"Then you hadn't to tell him it before? You are certainly consistent,  and I rather admire your position as regards the lady. But I am not so  sure that it was altogether fair toward the lad. It is one thing to  stand up for the poor soul, my dear sir, but it would be another thing  to let a nice boy like that go and marry her!\"    So that was the opinion of this ripe old citizen of the world! It ought  not to have irritated me as it did. It would be Catherine's opinion, of  course; but a dispassionate view was not to be expected from her. I had  not hitherto thought otherwise, myself; but now I experienced a perverse  inclination to take the opposite side. Was it so utterly impossible for  a woman with this woman's record to make a good wife to some man yet? I  did not admit it for an instant; he would be a lucky man who won so  healthy and so good a heart; thus I argued to myself with Mrs. Lascelles  in my mind, and nobody else. But Bob Evers was not a man, I was not sure  that he was out of his teens, and to think of him was to think at once  with Sir John Sankey and all the rest. Yes, yes, it would be madness and  suicide in such a youth; there could be no two opinions about that; and  yet I felt indignant at the mildest expression of that which I myself  could not deny.    Such was my somewhat chaotic state of mind when I had fled the  billiard-room in my turn, and put on my overcoat and cap to commune with  myself outside. Nobody did justice to Mrs. Lascelles; it was terribly  hard to do her justice; those were perhaps the ideas that were oftenest  uppermost. I did not see how I was to be the exception and prove the  rule; my brief was for Bob, and there was an end of it. It was foolish  to worry, especially on such a night. The moon had waxed since my  arrival, and now hung almost round and altogether dazzling in the little  sky the mountains left us. Yet I had the terrace all to myself; the  magnificent voice of our latest celebrity had drawn everybody else in  doors, or under the open drawing-room windows through which it poured  out into the glorious night. And in the vivid moonlight the very  mountains seemed to have gathered about the little human hive upon their  heights, to be listening to the grand rich notes that had some right to  break their ancient silence.      \"If doughty deeds my lady please,      Right soon I'll mount my steed;    And strong his arm, and fast his seat,      That bears frae me the meed.    I'll wear thy colours in my cap,      Thy picture at my heart;    And he that bends not to thine eye      Shall rue it to his smart!\"    It was a brave new setting to brave old lines, as simple and direct as  themselves, studiously in keeping, passionate, virile, almost inspired;  and the whole so justly given that the great notes did not drown the  words as they often will, but all came clean to the ear. No wonder the  hotel held its breath! I was standing entranced myself, an outpost of  the audience underneath the windows, whose fringe I could just see round  the uttermost angle of the hotel, when Bob Evers ran down the steps, and  came toward me in such guise that I could not swear to him till the last  yard.    \"Don't say a word,\" he whispered excitedly. \"I'm just off!\"    \"Off where?\" I gasped, for he had changed into full mountaineering garb,  and there was his greased face beaming in the moonlight, and the blue  spectacles twinkling about his hat-band, at half-past nine at night.    \"Up the Matterhorn!\"    \"At this time of night?\"    \"It is a bit late, and that's why I want it kept quiet. I don't want any  fuss or advice. I've got a couple of excellent guides waiting for me  just below by the shoemaker's hut. I told you I was on their tracks.  Well,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11204"],[0,"Diseases of the Horse's Foot (#14)"],[1,"drams), and injected at  the seat of the lower operation of neurectomy.    It is advisable to first render aseptic the seat of operation, and to  sterilize both the needle and the syringe by boiling. A suitable point to  choose for the injection is exactly over the upper border of the lateral  faces of the two sesamoids, the needle being introduced behind the cord  formed by the nerve and accompanying vessels, and parallel with it.    It is possible that the vein or the artery may be wounded, but such  accident is of little importance. All that is necessary in that case is to  partly withdraw the needle and again insert it. It is advisable to use a  twitch.    When the needle is in position, the injection should be made slowly, and  at the same time the point of the needle should be made to describe a  semicircular sweep, so as to spread the solution over as wide an area as is  possible.    Anaesthesia ensues in from six to twenty minutes, and if the cause of the  lameness is below the point of injection the animal moves sound.    Regarding this method of diagnosis, Professor Udriski of Bucharest, after a  series of trials, sums up as follows:    1. For the diagnosis of lameness cocaine injections are of very  considerable value.    2. These injections should be made along the course of the nerves.    3. Solutions heated to 40 deg. or 50 deg. C. produced quicker, deeper, and longer  anaesthesia than equally strong cold solutions.    4. In the sale of horses cocaine injections conceal fraud.    Cocaine being an irritant, it must be remembered that after the anaesthesia  the lameness is somewhat more marked than before.    To the cocaine other practitioners add morphia in the following  proportions:      Cocaine hydrochlorate           2-1/2 grains.    Morphia                         1-1/2   \"    Aqua destil                     1-1/2 drams.    As a diagnostic this mixture of the two is said to be far superior to  either cocaine or morphia alone.    In connection with this subject, Professor Hobday has published, among  others, the following cases illustrating the practical value of this method  of diagnosis:[A]    [Footnote A: The _Journal of Comparative Pathology and Therapeutics_ vol.  viii., pp. 27, 43.]    CASE I.--Cab gelding. Seat of lameness somewhat obscure; navicular disease  suspected. Injected 2 grains of cocaine in aqueous solution on either side  of the limb, immediately over the metacarpal nerves.    _Five Minutes_.--Lameness perceptibly diminished.    _Ten Minutes_.--Lameness scarcely perceptible.    CASE II.--Mare. Obscure lameness; foot suspected. Injected 30 minims of a 5  per cent. solution on either side of the leg just above the fetlock.    _Ten Minutes_.--No lameness, thus proving that the seat of lameness was  below the point of injection.    CASE III.--Cab gelding, aged, free clinique; Messrs. Elme's and Moffat's  case. Obscure lameness; foot suspected of navicular disease; very lame.  Injected 30 minims of a 5 per cent. solution of cocaine on either side of  the leg over the metacarpal nerves.    _Six Minutes_.--Lameness perceptibly less; there was no response whatever  on the inside of the leg to the prick of a pin. On the outside, which had  not been injected so thoroughly, there was sensation, although not so much  as in a healthy foot.    _Ten Minutes_.--Lameness had almost disappeared; so much so, that the  opinion as to navicular disease was confirmed, and neurectomy was  performed. Immediately after this operation there was no lameness whatever.    The same author also reports numerous cases among horses and cattle, dogs  and cats, pointing out the toxic properties of the drug. The symptoms  following an overdose are interesting enough to relate here, and I select  the following case of Professor Hobday's as being fairly typical:[A]    [Footnote A: _Loc. cit_.]    CASE IV.--Cart gelding. Free clinique; navicular disease. Injected  subcutaneously over the metacarpal nerves on each side 6 grains of cocaine  in aqueous solution. During the operation the animal manifested no signs  of pain whatever, not even when the nerve was cut. This animal received  altogether 12 grains of cocaine (3 grains were given on either side first,  then fifteen minutes afterwards the same dose repeated). The effect was  manifested on the system in ten minutes after the second injection by  clonic spasms of the muscles of the limbs (the legs being involuntarily  jerked backwards and forwards at intervals of about twenty seconds), which  materially interfered with the performance of the operation. The animal was  also continually moving the jaws, and was very sensitive to sounds, moving  the ears backwards and forwards. This hyperaesthesia, as evinced by the  movement of the ears, lasted for some considerable time after the animal  had been allowed to get up.    Cocaine hydrochlorate solutions, if intended to be kept for any length of  time, should have added to them when freshly made 1/200 part of boric acid  in order to preserve them. Even then they are liable to spoil, and should,  for subcutaneous injection, be made up just before needed for use.        CHAPTER V    GENERAL REMARKS ON OPERATIONS ON THE FOOT      A. METHODS OF RESTRAINT.    Many of the simple operations on the foot, such as the probing of a sinus,  the paring out of corns, or the searching of pricks, may most suitably be  performed with the animal's leg held by the operator as a smith holds it  for shoeing. According to the temperament of the animal, even the operation  for the removal of a portion of the sole, or the injection of sinuses with  caustics, may be carried out with the animal simply twitched.    When the operation is still a simple one, casting inconvenient or  impossible, and the animal restive, the twitch must be supplemented by some  other method. The most simple and one of the most effective is the blind,  cap, or bluff (Fig. 38). With it the most vicious animal or the most  nervous is in many instances either cowed into submission or soothed into  quietness.    At the same time, more forcible means than the operator's own strength  must be taken to hold the animal's foot from the ground. If the foot is a  fore-foot, and the point desired to be operated on is to the outside, the  pastern should be firmly lashed to the forearm by means of a thin, short  cord, or a leather strap and buckle. Much may then be done in the way of  paring and probing that would otherwise be impossible.    [Illustration: Fig. 38--The BLIND.]    [Illustration: Fig. 39--THE SIDE-LINE.]    If the foot is a hind one, one of the many methods of using what is  termed by Liautard, in his 'Manual of Operative Veterinary Surgery,' the  plate-longe, must be adopted. This, in its most useful form, is a length of  closely-woven cotton webbing, from about 2 to 2-1/2 inches wide, and from 5  to 6 yards long, provided with a small loop formed on one of its ends, and  perhaps better known to English readers as a 'side-line.' If webbing be not  available, a length of soft cotton rope, or a rope plaited and sold for the  purpose, as Fig. 39, will serve equally well. One of the most convenient  methods of using the side-line for securing the hind-foot is depicted in  Figs. 40 and 41.    [Illustration: FIG. 40.--THE SIDE-LINE ADJUSTED PREPARATORY TO SECURING THE  NEAR HIND-FOOT.]    [Illustration: FIG. 41.--THE NEAR HIND-FOOT SECURED WITH THE SIDE-LINE.]    Here the side-line has formed upon it a loop sufficiently large to form a  collar. This is placed round the animal's neck, the free end of the line  run round the pastern of the desired foot, and the foot drawn forward, as  in Fig. 40.    The loose end of the line is then twisted once or twice round the tight  portion, and finally given to an assistant to hold (see Fig. 41). The foot  is thus held from the ground, and violent kicking movements prevented.    Where the operation is a major one, restraint of a distinctly more forcible  nature becomes imperative. Many of the more serious operations can most  advantageously be performed with the patient secured in some form or other  of stock or trevis, and the foot suitably fixed. It is not the good fortune  of every veterinary surgeon, however, to be the lucky possessor of one of  these useful aids to successful operating. Perforce, he must fall back on  casting with the hobbles (Fig. 42).    [Illustration: FIG. 42.--CASTING HOBBLES.]    With the use of these we will assume our readers to be conversant, and will  imagine the animal to be already cast. It remains, then, but to detail the  most suitable means for firmly fixing the foot to be operated on.    Here the side-line is again brought into use. Care should previously have  been taken when casting to throw the animal so that the portion of the foot  to be operated on, whether inside or outside, falls uppermost, and that the  buckle of the hobble on that particular foot is placed so that it also is  within easy reach when the animal is down.    In the case we are illustrating the point of operation was the outside of  the near hind coronet. We will, therefore, describe the mode of fixing the  near hind-foot upon the cannon of the near fore-limb.    [Illustration: FIG. 43.--PHOTOGRAPH ILLUSTRATING METHOD OF ADJUSTING THE  SIDE-LINE PREPARATORY TO FIXING THE HIND-LEG UPON THE FORE.]    The side-line is first adjusted as follows: It is fixed upon the cannon of  the near hind-leg (A) by means of its small loop. From there it is passed  under the forearm of the same limb, over the forearm, under the rope  running from A to B; from there over and under the thigh, to be finally  brought in front of the thigh, and below the portion of rope running from  arm to thigh. The loose end of the side-line is then given to an assistant  standing behind the animal's back, the buckle of the hobble restraining the  foot unloosed, and strong but steady traction brought to bear from behind  upon the line. The operator should now "]]]
