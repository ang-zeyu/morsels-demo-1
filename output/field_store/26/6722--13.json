[2]Mara dispatched three pleasure-girls from the north quarter to come  and tempt him.  Their names were Tanha, Rati and Ranga.  Fa Hian  (Beal), p. 120.            BOOK V.      Now mighty Mara, spirit of the air,    The prince of darkness, ruling worlds below,    Had watched for Buddha all these weary years,    Seeking to lead his steady steps astray    By many wiles his wicked wit devised,    Lest he at length should find the living light    And rescue millions from his dark domains.    Now, showing him the kingdoms of the world.    He offered him the Chakravartin's crown;    Now, opening seas of knowledge, shoreless, vast,    Knowledge of ages past and yet to come,    Knowledge of nature and the hidden laws    That guide her changes, guide the roiling spheres,    Sakwal on sakwal,[1] boundless, infinite,    Yet ever moving on in harmony,    He thought to puff his spirit up with pride    Till he should quite forget a suffering world,    In sin and sorrow groping blindly on.    But when he saw that lust of power moved not,    And thirst for knowledge turned him not aside    From earnest search after the living light,    From tender love for every living thing,    He sent the tempters Doubt and dark Despair.    And as he watched for final victory    He saw that light flash through the silent cave,    And heard the Buddha breathe that earnest prayer,    And fled amazed, nor dared to look behind.    For though to Buddha all his way seemed dark,    His wily enemy could see a Power,    A mighty Power, that ever hovered near,    A present help in every time of need,    When sinking souls seek earnestly for aid.    He fled, indeed, as flies the prowling wolf,    Alarmed at watch-dog's bark or shepherd's voice,    While seeking entrance to the slumbering fold,    But soon returns with soft and stealthy step,    With keenest scent snuffing the passing breeze,    With ears erect catching each slightest sound,    With glaring eyes watching each moving thing,    With hungry jaws, skulking about the fold    Till coming dawn drives him to seek his lair.    So Mara fled, and so he soon returned,    And thus he watched the Buddha's every step;    Saw him with gentleness quell haughty power;    Saw him with tenderness raise up the weak;    Heard him before the Brahmans and the king    Denounce those bloody rites ordained by him;    Heard him declare the deadly work of Sin,    His own prime minister and eldest-born;    Heard him proclaim the mighty power of Love    To cleanse the life and make the flinty heart    As soft as sinews of the new-born babe.    And when he saw whither he bent his steps,    He sent three wrinkled hags, deformed and foul,    The willing agents of his wicked will--    Life-wasting Idleness, the thief of time;    Lascivious Lust, whose very touch defiles,    Poisoning the blood, polluting all within;    And greedy Gluttony, most gross of all,    Whose ravening maw forever asks for more--    To that delightful garden near his way,    To tempt the Master, their true forms concealed--    For who so gross that such coarse hags could tempt?--    But clothed instead in youthful beauty's grace.    And now he saw him pass unmoved by lust,    Nor yet with cold, self-righteous pride puffed up,    But breathing pity from his inmost soul    E'en for the ministers of vice themselves.      Defeated, not discouraged, still he thought    To try one last device, for well he knew    That Buddha's steps approached the sacred tree    Where light would dawn and all his power would end.    Upon a seat beside the shaded path,    A seeming aged Brahman, Mara sat,    And when the prince approached, his tempter rose,    Saluting him with gentle stateliness,    Saluted in return with equal grace.      \"Whither away, my son?\" the tempter said,    \"If you to Gaya now direct your steps,    Perhaps your youth may cheer my lonely age.\"    \"I go to seek for light,\" the prince replied,    \"But where it matters not, so light be found.\"      But Mara answered him: \"Your search is vain.    Why seek to know more than the Vedas teach?    Why seek to learn more than the teachers know?    But such is youth; the rosy tints of dawn    Tinge all his thoughts.  'Excelsior!' he cries,    And fain would scale the unsubstantial clouds    To find a light that knows no night, no change;    We Brahmans chant our hymns in solemn wise,    The vulgar listen with profoundest awe;    But still our muffled heart-throbs beat the march    Onward, forever onward, to the grave,    When one ahead cries, 'Lo! I see a light!'    And others clutch his garments, following on.    Till all in starless darkness disappear,    There may be day beyond this starless night,    There may be life beyond this dark profound--    But who has ever seen that changeless day?    What steps have e'er retraced that silent road?    Fables there are, hallowed by hoary age,    Fables and ancient creeds, that men have made    To give them power with ignorance and fear;    Fables of gods with human passions filled:    Fables of men who walked and talked with gods;    Fables of kalpas passed, when Brahma slept    And all created things were wrapped in flames,    And then the floods descended, chaos reigned,    The world a waste of waters, and the heavens    A sunless void, until again he wakes,    And sun and moon and stars resume their rounds,    Oceans receding show the mountain-tops,    And then the hills and spreading plains--    Strange fables all, that crafty men have feigned.    Why waste your time pursuing such vain dreams--    As some benighted travelers chase false lights    To lose themselves in bogs and fens at last?    But read instead in Nature's open book    How light from darkness grew by slow degrees;    How crawling worms grew into light-winged birds,    Acquiring sweetest notes and gayest plumes;    How lowly ferns grew into lofty palms;    How men have made themselves from chattering apes;[2]    How, even from protoplasm to highest bard,    Selecting and rejecting, mind has grown,    Until at length all secrets are unlocked,    And man himself now stands pre-eminent,    Maker and master of his own great self,    To sneer at all his lisping childlike past    And laugh at all his fathers had revered.\"      The prince with gentle earnestness replied:    \"Full well I know how blindly we grope on    In doubt and fear and ignorance profound,    The wisdom of the past a book now sealed.    But why despise what ages have revered?    As some rude plowman casts on rubbish-heaps    The rusty casket that his share reveals,    Not knowing that within it are concealed    Most precious gems, to make him rich indeed,    The hand that hid them from the robber, cold,    The key that locked this rusty casket, lost.    The past was wise, else whence that wondrous tongue[3]    That we call sacred, which the learned speak,    Now passing out of use as too refined    For this rude age, too smooth for our rough tongues,    Too rich and delicate for our coarse thoughts.    Why should such men make fables so absurd    Unless within their rough outside is stored    Some precious truth from profanation hid?    Revere your own, revile no other faith,    Lest with the casket you reject the gems,    Or with rough hulls reject the living seed.    Doubtless in nature changes have been wrought    That speak of ages in the distant past,    Whose contemplation fills the mind with awe.    The smooth-worn pebbles on the highest hills    Speak of an ocean sweeping o'er their tops;    The giant palms, now changed to solid rocks,    Speak of the wonders of a buried world.    Why seek to solve the riddle nature puts,    Of whence and why, with theories and dreams?    The crawling worm proclaims its Maker's power;    The singing bird proclaims its Maker's skill;    The mind of man proclaims a greater Mind,    Whose will makes world, whose thoughts are living acts.    Our every heart-throb speaks of present power,    Preserving, recreating, day by day.    Better confess how little we can know,    Better with feet unshod and humble awe    Approach this living Power to ask for aid.\"    And as he spoke the devas filled the air,    Unseen, unheard of men, and sweetly sung:    \"Hail, prince of peace! hail, harbinger of day!    The darkness vanishes, the light appears.\"    But Mara heard, and silent slunk away,    The o'erwrought prince fell prostrate on the ground    And lay entranced, while devas hovered near,    Watching each heart-throb, breathing that sweet calm    Its guardian angel gives the sleeping child.      The night has passed, the day-star fades from sight,    And morning's softest tint of rose and gold    Tinges the east and tips the mountain-tops.    The silent village stirs with waking life,    The bleat of goats and low of distant herds,    The song of birds and crow of jungle-cocks    Breathe softest music through the dewy air.      And now two girls,[4] just grown to womanhood,    The lovely daughters of the village lord,    Trapusha one, and one Balika called,    Up with the dawn, trip lightly o'er the grass,    Bringing rich curds and rice picked grain by grain,    A willing offering to their guardian god--    Who dwelt, as all the simple folk believed,    Beneath an aged bodhi-tree that stood    Beside the path and near where Buddha lay--    To ask such husbands as their fancies paint,    Gentle and strong, and noble, true and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14366"],[0,"Argentina from a British Point of View, and Notes on Argentine Life (#14)"],[1,"and frying-pans, as they would only get  dirty again when next used, and the most she could be persuaded to do  was to rub them round inside with a bit of old newspaper or a handful of  grass. Needless to say, after a time I got tired of these methods, and  so we parted.    My next servant, Angelina, was one of the best I had, as she was clean,  which was a great consideration, and also she was quick to learn and  soon picked up the rudiments of cooking according to our ideas; her  great failing, however, was that she was anything but honest, and could  not refrain from petty pilfering; and another drawback to her was her  objection to wearing shoes or stockings in the hot weather; in spite of  being constantly told that she must not appear without them, she would  insist in doing so, and this was a continual cause of trouble.    After getting rid of No. 2 our real troubles began, and we had eight  changes in ten months. At the time we were living in wooden huts about  two miles from a village which was a summer resort for rich people from  Buenos Aires, and this caused a dearth of servants during the summer  months, as the place was full from the beginning of December to the end  of March, and people who came up for the summer and rented houses  usually were willing to pay anything to get servants, with the result  that we outside would get none, or only the cast-off ones. Nos. 3 and 4  stayed but a short time. My fifth attempt was a terrible girl, too dirty  for words; and though apparently willing to learn, too utterly lacking  in intelligence to ever learn anything. She used to get herself into the  most awful grimy condition, and one incident during her time with me is  worth mentioning. I had with great difficulty one day got her to  understand that a wood floor could not be properly cleaned with a grass  broom dipped in cold water and just swished about over it, and, by going  down on my knees with a scrubbing brush and hot water and soap, and  giving a practical demonstration of how a floor should be washed, had  started her away to clean it, and judged that I might safely leave her,  to attend to the other household duties in the kitchen. I must tell you  that the day previously I had given her a practical lesson in  black-leading a stove by doing it myself while she looked on. Well,  after an hour in the kitchen I returned to see how she was getting on,  when I found to my great pleasure that not content with scrubbing the  floor, she had also attacked the stove with hot water, soap, and  scrubbing brush, with the result that my hard work of the previous day  was all undone and the whole room well sprinkled with black specks and  the stove a mass of rust. Two weeks of similar experiences finished our  acquaintance, and she gave place to No. 6. After I had spent three weeks  teaching No. 6 cooking, she quietly informed me that she was leaving at  the end of the week to take up a place as cook in Rosario, as she now  knew enough cooking for the position; so I had not only wasted all my  time in teaching her, but had paid her into the bargain for learning  enough to leave me.    The next servant, No. 7, Alexandrina, was, I think, the worst. She was a  Spaniard from Barcelona. She was an awful individual, and would insist  on wearing clothes of so light and scanty a nature that she was not  decent to have about the house; also, whenever we happened to have a  joke of any sort to laugh over at meals, she used immediately to come in  from the kitchen to see what was going on, and I had the greatest  difficulty to get her to return to the kitchen. I had to get rid of her,  because her moral reputation was anything but good, and two days in the  week she refused to get out of bed, and told me to do my own dirty work,  as she was ill; so at the end of two weeks she had to go. No. 8, Maria,  was a girl direct from the sierras, and was very stupid and silly, and  did not a single thing. One day I was buying vegetables, and she asked  me why I wanted to buy roots, and when I told her they were to eat, she  said even poor people could afford to buy meat, and she would not eat  them. One day I took this girl out with me to do some shopping, and  called on some people who had a piano. It was twilight, and someone was  playing the piano, and she rushed in the room and out again, with her  face very white, and said someone was beating a big, black animal in the  corner of the room, and it was screaming dreadfully with the pain. This  girl's mother was a very talkative old lady, and would insist on coming  with three children every day and taking up her position in the kitchen,  and when once she commenced to talk, one could not get away from her. At  the end of the month she came for the girl's pay, and wanted me to pay  her more money, which I was not willing to do, as I had been unable to  teach her much; so she asked if her daughter might go away for the day  and night, as she had to bath. This I was only too willing to agree to,  and let her go; but they returned in the middle of the night, and  removed all her belongings. After a few days I managed to get No. 9, who  was a widow with two children: but she only stayed two weeks. Our tenth  and last attempt was made with No. 4 once more, as she was again able to  come to us. She stayed two months, when we went away for four weeks'  holiday. A week after our return I paid her in full for the month,  though she had never been near the house all that time, and she promptly  said she could not stay with us any longer, and left. We nearly got to  No. 11, as we engaged a girl to come at $20 a month to start with, and  she was to come the next morning at eight o'clock to begin work. She  arrived at 10 a.m., and informed me that, as we had paid our last  servant $25 the month, she could not come for less. I was so sick and  tired of my experiences that this finished me, and I decided to do  without any servant. Since then, for the last year, I have done the work  myself.          POLICE OF A BYGONE DAY.          POLICE OF A BYGONE DAY.      Yes, times have changed since I went to San Cristobal just twenty years  ago. For then the English were pioneers, so to speak; not in a country  of savagery, but of semi-savagery, a very different and much worse  matter. I wonder is A.J., the Chief of Police, still to the fore? Ye  gods, how that man tried to break my heart, and how nearly he succeeded!  I was a Mayor-domo then, and G. was my boss, standing in the place of  the owners to me. The boss had a mortal dread of the police and their  powers, seen and unseen. So that when the worthy Chief of Police  suddenly decided to add the trade of butchering to his many lucrative  businesses, I received orders to sell him cows at twenty-five per cent.  less price than I sold to any of his competitors. Thus, whereas I was  selling them at twenty dollars paper, then worth about one pound per  head, I had to sell him at fifteen shillings, with the inevitable result  that he almost immediately became master of the situation and the entire  local market became his, enabling him to charge what he liked for meat,  while I was forbidden to raise the price of the cows sold him.    Insatiable in his greed, he began to ask for cattle twice a week, always  taking from ten to twenty animals, until one day, after exceptionally  wet weather, I protested that it was not possible to round up the stock  in the then state of the camp and destroy so much grass for a small  bunch of cows. Unlucky thought and ill-judged protest! For when he urged  that the inhabitants of the town were starving, and that a small point  of half-breed heifers would do to go on with, I received orders to let  him part out from our best herd. Twenty fine half-bred Herefords did he  pick while I almost shed tears of blood, though all the time, of course,  I had to show a smiling face.    This sort of thing had been going on for some time, when one of the  boundary riders told me that the fence between the town and one of our  nearest paddocks had been cut during the night.    \"Then mend it up,\" said I.    \"Sir, it is mended already.\"    Not a week had passed before the same man brought me the same report. So  I determined to \"parar rodeo\" (round up the cattle) immediately, and  count them. Twenty heifers short in one square league, and in less than  a month! This thing had to stop. I told the Capataz to take the boundary  rider off that beat, without telling him why, and then the Capataz and I  patrolled the fence night after night for a week, during which it was  never cut.    We put a new boundary rider on, and three mornings later he came to see  me bright and early, saying that not only had the fence been cut, but  that there were distinct traces of cattle having passed out recently.    After assuring myself that there was no doubt about the matter, for I  found the hoof marks of what I calculated to be not less than twenty  animals, I went post haste to my friend the Chief of Police, never  doubting that after all the favours shown him he would prove a friend in  need. I was young then.    \"You don't say so, Don Ernesto!\" said his podgy, putty-faced little  Highness. \"Where was it? When was------ By heavens, somebody shall  suffer for this! Just let me or any of my soldiers catch the thieves,  and not one of them shall reach Santa Fe alive. Now, I'll tell you what.  Just leave it to me, and don't you worry nor think any more about the  matter, much less mention it to a soul. In less than two days I'll have  the thief or thieves here in the stocks.\"    I told him plainly that that was not my programme, and that, whatever he  did, I was not going to leave that fence unpatrolled until I could move  the stock out of the paddock.    \"Then this is what we'll do, Don Ernesto. You shall be one of us. You  come and dine with me at six o'clock this evening, and afterwards we'll  go out with the sergeant and five or six men and"]]]
