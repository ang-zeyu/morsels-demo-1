Utensils made from it  are light in weight, easily kept clean, and for most cooking purposes,  are far superior to those made from any other material.    What is termed \"galvanized iron\" is unsuitable for cooking utensils, it  being simply sheet iron coated with zinc, an exceedingly unsafe metal to  be used for cooking purposes.    Tin, which is simply thin sheet iron coated with tin by dipping several  times into vats of the melted metal, is largely employed in the  manufacture of cooking utensils. Tinware is acted upon by acids, and  when used for holding or cooking any acid foods, like sour milk, sour  fruits, tomatoes, etc., harmful substances are liable to be formed,  varying in quantity and harmfulness with the nature of the acid  contained in the food.    In these days of fraud and adulteration, nearly all the cheaper grades  of tinware contain a greater or less amount of lead in their  composition, which owing to its greater abundance and less price, is  used as an adulterant of tin. Lead is also used in the solder with which  the parts of tinware are united. The action of acids upon lead form very  poisonous compounds, and all lead-adulterated utensils should be wholly  discarded for cooking purposes.    _Test for Lead-Adulterated Tin._--Place upon the metal a small drop of  nitric acid, spreading it to the size of a dime, dry with gentle heat,  apply a drop of water, then add a small crystal of iodide of potash. If  lead is present, a yellowish color will be seen very soon after the  addition of the iodide. Lead glazing, which is frequently employed on  crockery and ironware in the manufacture of cooking utensils, may also  be detected in the same manner.    Cooking utensils made of copper are not to be recommended from the point  of healthfulness, although many cooks esteem them because copper is a  better conductor of heat than iron or tin. The acids of many fruits  combine with copper to form extremely poisonous substances. Fatty  substances, as well as salt and sugar, act upon copper to a greater or  less degree, also vegetables containing sulfur in their composition and  produce harmful compounds.    Utensils made of brass, which is a compound of copper and zinc, are not  safe to use for cooking purposes.          TABLE TOPICS.        Bad cooking diminishes happiness and shortens life.--_Wisdom of      Ages._        Says Mrs. Partington: \"Many a fair home has been desiccated by poor      cooking, and a man's table has been the rock on which his happiness      has split.\"        SIGNIFICANT FACT.--_Lady_--\"Have you had much experience as a cook?\"      _Applicant_--\"Oh, indeed I have. I was the cook of Mr. and Mrs.      Peterby for three years.\"        _L._--\"Why did you leave them?\"        _A._--\"I didn't leave them. They left me. They both died.\"        _L._--\"What of?\"        _A._--\"Dyspepsia.\"        Cooking is generally bad because people falling to routine; habit      dulls their appreciation, and they do not think about what they are      eating.--_Didsbury._        _Lilly_ (Secretary of the cooking class)--\"Now girls, we've learned      nine cakes, two kinds of angel food, and seven pies. What next?\"        _Susie_ (engaged)--\"Dick's father says I must learn to bake bread.\"        _Indignant chorus_--\"Bread? How absurd! What are bakers for?\"        It is told of Philip Hecgnet, a French, physician who lived in the      17th, century, that when calling upon his wealthy patients, he used      often to go to the kitchen and pantry, embrace the cooks and      butlers, and exhort them to do their duty well. \"I owe you so much      gratitude, my dear friends,\" he would say; \"you are so useful to us      doctors; for if you did not keep on poisoning the people, we should      all have to go to the poorhouse.\"        There are innumerable books of recipes for cooking, but unless the      cook is master of the principles of his art, and unless he knows the      why and the wherefore of its processes, he cannot choose a recipe      intelligently and execute it successfully.--_Richard Estcourt._        They who provide the food for the world, decide the health of the      world. You have only to go on some errands amid the taverns and      hotels of the United States and Great Britain, to appreciate the      fact that a vast multitude of the human race are slaughtered by      incompetent cookery. Though a young woman may have taken lessons in      music, and may have taken lessons in painting, and lessons in      astronomy, she is not well educated unless she has taken lessons in      dough!--_Talmage._          HOUSEHOLD WORKSHOP    It is a mistake to suppose that any room, however small and unpleasantly  situated, is \"good enough\" for a kitchen. This is the room where  housekeepers pass a great portion of their time, and it should be one of  the brightest and most convenient rooms in the house; for upon the  results of no other department of woman's domain depend so greatly the  health and comfort of the family as upon those involved in this  \"household workshop.\" The character of a person's work is more or less  dependent upon his surroundings, hence is it to be greatly wondered at  that a woman immured in a small, close, dimly-lighted room, whose only  outlook may be the back alley or the woodshed, supplies her household  with products far below the standard of health and housewifely skill?    Every kitchen should have windows on two sides of the room, and the sun  should have free entrance through them; the windows should open from the  top to allow a complete change of air, for light and fresh air are among  the chief essentials to success in all departments of the household.  Good drainage should also be provided, and the ventilation of the  kitchen ought to be even more carefully attended to than that of a  sleeping room. The ventilation of the kitchen should be so ample as to  thoroughly remove all gases and odors, which, together with steam from  boiling and other cooking processes, generally invade and render to some  degree unhealthful every other portion of the house. It is the steam  from the kitchen which gives a fusty odor to the parlor air and provides  a wet-sheet pack for the occupant of the \"spare bed.\" The only way of  wholly eradicating this evil, is the adoption of the suggestion of the  sanitary philosopher who places the kitchen at the top of the house.    To lessen to discomforts from heat, a ventilator may be placed above the  range, that shall carry out of the room all superfluous heat, and aid in  removing the steam and odors from cooking food. The simplest form of  such a ventilator this inverted hopper of sheet iron fitted above the  range, the upper and smaller end opening into a large flue adjacent to  the smoke flue for the range. Care must be taken, however, to provide an  ample ventilating shaft for this purpose, since a strong draft is  required to secure the desired results.    There should be ample space for tables, chairs, range, sink, and  cupboards, yet the room should not be so large as to necessitate too  many steps. A very good size for the ordinary dwelling is 16 x 18 feet.    Undoubtedly much of the distaste for, and neglect of, \"housework,\" so  often deplored in these days, arises from unpleasant surroundings. If  the kitchen be light, airy, and tidy, and the utensils bright and clean,  the work of compounding those articles of food which grace the table and  satisfy the appetite will be a pleasant task, and one entirely worthy of  the most intelligent and cultivated woman.    It is desirable, from a sanitary standpoint, that the kitchen floor be  made impervious to moisture; hence, concrete or tile floors are better  than wooden floors. If wooden floors are used, they should be  constructed of narrow boards of hard wood, carefully joined and  thoroughly saturated with hot linseed oil, well rubbed in to give polish  to the surface.    Cleanliness is the great _desideratum_, and this can be best attained  by having all woodwork in and about the kitchen coated with varnish;  substances which cause stain and grease spots, do not penetrate the wood  when varnished, and can be easily removed with a damp cloth. Paint is  preferable to whitewash or calcimine for the walls, since it is less  affected by steam, and can be more readily cleaned. A carpet on a  kitchen floor is as out of place as a kitchen sink would be in a parlor.    The elements of beauty should not be lacking in the kitchen. Pictures  and fancy articles are inappropriate; but a few pots of easily  cultivated flowers on the window ledge or arranged upon brackets about  the window in winter, and a window box arranged as a jardiniere, with  vines and blooming plants in summer, will greatly brighten the room, and  thus serve to lighten the task of those whose daily labor confines them  to the precincts of the kitchen.    THE KITCHEN FURNITURE.--The furniture for a kitchen should not be  cumbersome, and should be so made and dressed as to be easily cleaned.  There should be plenty of cupboards, and each for the sake of order,  should be devoted to a special purpose. Cupboards with sliding doors are  much superior to closets. They should be placed upon casters so as to be  easily moved, as they, are thus not only more convenient, but admit of  more thorough cleanliness.    Cupboards used for the storage of food should be well ventilated;  otherwise, they furnish choice conditions for the development of mold  and germs. Movable cupboards may be ventilated by means of openings in  the top, and doors covered with very fine wire gauze which will admit  the air but keep out flies and dust. All stationary cupboards and  closets should have a ventilating flue connected with the main shaft by  which the house is ventilated, or directly communicating with the outer  air.    No kitchen can"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12242"],[0,"Poems (#14)"],[1,"   Also many verses, written as such, were sent to friends in  letters; these were published in 1894, in the volumes of her  _Letters_. It has not been necessary, however, to include them in  this Series, and all have been omitted, except three or four  exceptionally strong ones, as \"A Book,\" and \"With Flowers.\"    There is internal evidence that many of the poems were simply  spontaneous flashes of insight, apparently unrelated to outward  circumstance. Others, however, had an obvious personal origin;  for example, the verses \"I had a Guinea golden,\" which seem to  have been sent to some friend travelling in Europe, as a dainty  reminder of letter-writing delinquencies. The surroundings in  which any of Emily Dickinson's verses are known to have been  written usually serve to explain them clearly; but in general the  present volume is full of thoughts needing no interpretation to  those who apprehend this scintillating spirit.                                            M. L. T.    AMHERST, _October_, 1896.          I. LIFE.      I.    REAL RICHES.    'T is little I could care for pearls    Who own the ample sea;  Or brooches, when the Emperor    With rubies pelteth me;    Or gold, who am the Prince of Mines;    Or diamonds, when I see  A diadem to fit a dome    Continual crowning me.            II.    SUPERIORITY TO FATE.    Superiority to fate    Is difficult to learn.  'T is not conferred by any,    But possible to earn    A pittance at a time,    Until, to her surprise,  The soul with strict economy    Subsists till Paradise.            III.    HOPE.    Hope is a subtle glutton;    He feeds upon the fair;  And yet, inspected closely,    What abstinence is there!    His is the halcyon table    That never seats but one,  And whatsoever is consumed    The same amounts remain.            IV.    FORBIDDEN FRUIT.    I.    Forbidden fruit a flavor has    That lawful orchards mocks;  How luscious lies the pea within    The pod that Duty locks!            V.    FORBIDDEN FRUIT.    II.    Heaven is what I cannot reach!    The apple on the tree,  Provided it do hopeless hang,    That 'heaven' is, to me.    The color on the cruising cloud,    The interdicted ground  Behind the hill, the house behind, --    There Paradise is found!            VI.    A WORD.    A word is dead  When it is said,    Some say.  I say it just  Begins to live    That day.            VII.    To venerate the simple days    Which lead the seasons by,  Needs but to remember    That from you or me  They may take the trifle    Termed mortality!    To invest existence with a stately air,  Needs but to remember    That the acorn there  Is the egg of forests    For the upper air!            VIII.    LIFE'S TRADES.    It's such a little thing to weep,    So short a thing to sigh;  And yet by trades the size of these    We men and women die!            IX.    Drowning is not so pitiful    As the attempt to rise.  Three times, 't is said, a sinking man    Comes up to face the skies,  And then declines forever    To that abhorred abode  Where hope and he part company, --    For he is grasped of God.  The Maker's cordial visage,    However good to see,  Is shunned, we must admit it,    Like an adversity.            X.    How still the bells in steeples stand,    Till, swollen with the sky,  They leap upon their silver feet    In frantic melody!            XI.    If the foolish call them 'flowers,'    Need the wiser tell?  If the savans 'classify' them,    It is just as well!    Those who read the Revelations    Must not criticise  Those who read the same edition    With beclouded eyes!    Could we stand with that old Moses    Canaan denied, --  Scan, like him, the stately landscape    On the other side, --    Doubtless we should deem superfluous    Many sciences  Not pursued by learned angels    In scholastic skies!    Low amid that glad _Belles lettres_    Grant that we may stand,  Stars, amid profound Galaxies,    At that grand 'Right hand'!            XII.    A SYLLABLE.    Could mortal lip divine    The undeveloped freight  Of a delivered syllable,    'T would crumble with the weight.            XIII.    PARTING.    My life closed twice before its close;    It yet remains to see  If Immortality unveil    A third event to me,    So huge, so hopeless to conceive,    As these that twice befell.  Parting is all we know of heaven,    And all we need of hell.            XIV.    ASPIRATION.    We never know how high we are    Till we are called to rise;  And then, if we are true to plan,    Our statures touch the skies.    The heroism we recite    Would be a daily thing,  Did not ourselves the cubits warp    For fear to be a king.            XV.    THE INEVITABLE.    While I was fearing it, it came,    But came with less of fear,  Because that fearing it so long    Had almost made it dear.  There is a fitting a dismay,    A fitting a despair.  'Tis harder knowing it is due,    Than knowing it is here.  The trying on the utmost,    The morning it is new,  Is terribler than wearing it    A whole existence through.            XVI.    A BOOK.    There is no frigate like a book    To take us lands away,  Nor any coursers like a page    Of prancing poetry.  This traverse may the poorest take    Without oppress of toll;  How frugal is the chariot    That bears a human soul!            XVII.    Who has not found the heaven below    Will fail of it above.  God's residence is next to mine,    His furniture is love.            XVIII.    A PORTRAIT.    A face devoid of love or grace,    A hateful, hard, successful face,  A face with which a stone    Would feel as thoroughly at ease  As were they old acquaintances, --    First time together thrown.            XIX.    I HAD A GUINEA GOLDEN.    I had a guinea golden;    I lost it in the sand,  And though the sum was simple,    And pounds were in the land,  Still had it such a value    Unto my frugal eye,  That when I could not find it    I sat me down to sigh.    I had a crimson robin    Who sang full many a day,  But when the woods were painted    He, too, did fly away.  Time brought me other robins, --    Their ballads were the same, --  Still for my missing troubadour    I kept the 'house at hame.'    I had a star in heaven;    One Pleiad was its name,  And when I was not heeding    It wandered from the same.  And though the skies are crowded,    And all the night ashine,  I do not care about it,    Since none of them are mine.    My story has a moral:    I have a missing friend, --  Pleiad its name, and robin,    And guinea in the sand, --  And when this mournful ditty,    Accompanied with tear,  Shall meet the eye of traitor    In country far from here,  Grant that repentance solemn    May seize upon his mind,  And he no consolation    Beneath the sun may find.    NOTE. -- This poem may have had, like many others, a  personal origin. It is more than probable that it was  sent to some friend travelling in Europe, a dainty  reminder of letter-writing delinquencies.            XX.    SATURDAY AFTERNOON.    From all the jails the boys and girls    Ecstatically leap, --  Beloved, only afternoon    That prison doesn't keep.    They storm the earth and stun the air,    A mob of solid bliss.  Alas! that frowns could lie in wait    For such a foe as this!              XXI.    Few get enough, -- enough is one;    To that ethereal throng  Have not each one of us the right    To stealthily belong?            XXII.    Upon the gallows hung a wretch,    Too sullied for the hell  To which the law entitled him.    As nature's curtain fell  The one who bore him tottered in,    For this was woman's son.  ''T was all I had,' she stricken gasped;    Oh, what a livid boon!            XXIII.    THE LOST THOUGHT.    I felt a clearing in my mind    As if my brain had split;  I tried to match it, seam by seam,    But could not make them fit.    The thought behind I strove to join    Unto the thought before,  But sequence ravelled out of reach    Like balls upon a floor.            XXIV.    RETICENCE.    The reticent volcano keeps    His never slumbering plan;  Confided are his projects pink    To no precarious man.    If nature will not tell the tale    Jehovah told to her,  Can human nature not survive    Without a listener?    Admonished by her buckled lips    Let every babbler be.  The only secret people keep    Is Immortality.            XXV.    WITH FLOWERS.    If recollecting were forgetting,    Then I remember not;  And if forgetting, recollecting,    How near I had forgot!  And if to miss were merry,    And if to mourn were gay,  How very blithe the fingers    That gathered these to-day!            XXVI.    The farthest thunder that I heard    Was nearer than the sky,  And rumbles still, though torrid noons    Have lain their missiles by.  The lightning that preceded it    Struck no one but myself,  But I would not exchange the bolt    For all the rest of life.  Indebtedness to oxygen    The chemist may repay,  But not the obligation    To electricity.  It founds the homes and decks the days,    And every clamor bright  Is but the gleam concomitant    Of that waylaying light.  The thought is quiet as a flake, --    A crash without a sound;  How life's reverberation    Its explanation found!            XXVII.    On the bleakness of my lot    Bloom I strove to raise.  Late, my acre of a rock    Yielded grape and maize.    Soil of flint if steadfast tilled    Will reward the hand;  Seed of palm by Lybian sun    Fructified in sand.            XXVIII.    CONTRAST.    A door just opened on a street --    I, lost, was passing by --  An instant's width of warmth disclosed,    And wealth, and company.    The door as sudden shut, and I,    I, lost, was passing by, --  Lost doubly, but by contrast most,    Enlightening misery.              XXIX.    FRIENDS.    Are friends delight or pain?    Could bounty but remain  Riches were good.    But if they only stay  Bolder to fly away,    Riches are sad.              XXX.    FIRE.    Ashes denote that "]]]
