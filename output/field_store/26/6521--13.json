Therefore  let us take the jaunt in an easy manner. I'm an old traveler and have  found that I never gain anything by being in a hurry. 'Take it easy' is  my motto. If you can't take it easy, take it as easy as you can.\"    After walking some distance over the road of yellow bricks Ojo said he  was hungry and would stop to eat some bread and cheese. He offered a  portion of the food to the Shaggy Man, who thanked him but refused it.    \"When I start out on my travels,\" said he, \"I carry along enough square  meals to last me several weeks. Think I'll indulge in one now, as long  as we're stopping anyway.\"    Saying this, he took a bottle from his pocket and shook from it a  tablet about the size of one of Ojo's finger-nails.    \"That,\" announced the Shaggy Man, \"is a square meal, in condensed form.  Invention of the great Professor Woggle-Bug, of the Royal College of  Athletics. It contains soup, fish, roast meat, salad, apple-dumplings,  ice cream and chocolate-drops, all boiled down to this small size, so  it can be conveniently carried and swallowed when you are hungry and  need a square meal.\"    \"I'm square,\" said the Woozy. \"Give me one, please.\"    So the Shaggy Man gave the Woozy a tablet from his bottle and the beast  ate it in a twinkling.    \"You have now had a six course dinner,\" declared the Shaggy Man.    \"Pshaw!\" said the Woozy, ungratefully, \"I want to taste something.  There's no fun in that sort of eating.\"    \"One should only eat to sustain life,\" replied the Shaggy Man, \"and  that tablet is equal to a peck of other food.\"    \"I don't care for it. I want something I can chew and taste,\" grumbled  the Woozy.    \"You are quite wrong, my poor beast,\" said the Shaggy Man in a tone of  pity. \"Think how tired your jaws would get chewing a square meal like  this, if it were not condensed to the size of a small tablet--which you  can swallow in a jiffy.\"    \"Chewing isn't tiresome; it's fun,\" maintained the Woozy. \"I always  chew the honey-bees when I catch them. Give me some bread and cheese,  Ojo.\"    \"No, no! You've already eaten a big dinner!\" protested the Shaggy Man.    \"May be,\" answered the Woozy; \"but I guess I'll fool myself by munching  some bread and cheese. I may not be hungry, having eaten all those  things you gave me, but I consider this eating business a matter of  taste, and I like to realize what's going into me.\"    Ojo gave the beast what he wanted, but the Shaggy Man shook his shaggy  head reproachfully and said there was no animal so obstinate or hard to  convince as a Woozy.    At this moment a patter of footsteps was heard, and looking up they saw  the live phonograph standing before them. It seemed to have passed  through many adventures since Ojo and his comrades last saw the  machine, for the varnish of its wooden case was all marred and dented  and scratched in a way that gave it an aged and disreputable appearance.    \"Dear me!\" exclaimed Ojo, staring hard. \"What has happened to you?\"    \"Nothing much,\" replied the phonograph in a sad and depressed voice.  \"I've had enough things thrown at me, since I left you, to stock a  department store and furnish half a dozen bargain-counters.\"    \"Are you so broken up that you can't play?\" asked Scraps.    \"No; I still am able to grind out delicious music. Just now I've a  record on tap that is really superb,\" said the phonograph, growing more  cheerful.    \"That is too bad,\" remarked Ojo. \"We've no objection to you as a  machine, you know; but as a music-maker we hate you.\"    \"Then why was I ever invented?\" demanded the machine, in a tone of  indignant protest.    They looked at one another inquiringly, but no one could answer such a  puzzling question. Finally the Shaggy Man said:    \"I'd like to hear the phonograph play.\"    Ojo sighed. \"We've been very happy since we met you, sir,\" he said.    \"I know. But a little misery, at times, makes one appreciate happiness  more. Tell me, Phony, what is this record like, which you say you have  on tap?\"    \"It's a popular song, sir. In all civilized lands the common people  have gone wild over it.\"    \"Makes civilized folks wild folks, eh? Then it's dangerous.\"    \"Wild with joy, I mean,\" explained the phonograph. \"Listen. This song  will prove a rare treat to you, I know. It made the author rich--for an  author. It is called 'My Lulu.'\"    Then the phonograph began to play. A strain of odd, jerky sounds was  followed by these words, sung by a man through his nose with great  vigor of expression:        \"Ah wants mah Lulu, mah coal-black Lulu;      Ah wants mah loo-loo, loo-loo, loo-loo, Lu!      Ah loves mah Lulu, mah coal-black Lulu,      There ain't nobody else loves loo-loo, Lu!\"      \"Here--shut that off!\" cried the Shaggy Man, springing to his feet.  \"What do you mean by such impertinence?\"    \"It's the latest popular song,\" declared the phonograph, speaking in a  sulky tone of voice.    \"A popular song?\"    \"Yes. One that the feeble-minded can remember the words of and those  ignorant of music can whistle or sing. That makes a popular song  popular, and the time is coming when it will take the place of all  other songs.\"    \"That time won't come to us, just yet,\" said the Shaggy Man, sternly:  \"I'm something of a singer myself, and I don't intend to be throttled  by any Lulus like your coal-black one. I shall take you all apart, Mr.  Phony, and scatter your pieces far and wide over the country, as a  matter of kindness to the people you might meet if allowed to run  around loose. Having performed this painful duty I shall--\"    But before he could say more the phonograph turned and dashed up the  road as fast as its four table-legs could carry it, and soon it had  entirely disappeared from their view.    The Shaggy Man sat down again and seemed well pleased. \"Some one else  will save me the trouble of scattering that phonograph,\" said he; \"for  it is not possible that such a music-maker can last long in the Land of  Oz. When you are rested, friends, let us go on our way.\"    During the afternoon the travelers found themselves in a lonely and  uninhabited part of the country. Even the fields were no longer  cultivated and the country began to resemble a wilderness. The road of  yellow bricks seemed to have been neglected and became uneven and more  difficult to walk upon. Scrubby under-brush grew on either side of the  way, while huge rocks were scattered around in abundance.    But this did not deter Ojo and his friends from trudging on, and they  beguiled the journey with jokes and cheerful conversation. Toward  evening they reached a crystal spring which gushed from a tall rock by  the roadside and near this spring stood a deserted cabin. Said the  Shaggy Man, halting here:    \"We may as well pass the night here, where there is shelter for our  heads and good water to drink. Road beyond here is pretty bad; worst we  shall have to travel; so let's wait until morning before we tackle it.\"    They agreed to this and Ojo found some brushwood in the cabin and made  a fire on the hearth. The fire delighted Scraps, who danced before it  until Ojo warned her she might set fire to herself and burn up. After  that the Patchwork Girl kept at a respectful distance from the darting  flames, but the Woozy lay down before the fire like a big dog and  seemed to enjoy its warmth.    For supper the Shaggy Man ate one of his tablets, but Ojo stuck to his  bread and cheese as the most satisfying food. He also gave a portion to  the Woozy.    When darkness came on and they sat in a circle on the cabin floor,  facing the firelight--there being no furniture of any sort in the  place--Ojo said to the Shaggy Man:    \"Won't you tell us a story?\"    \"I'm not good at stories,\" was the reply; \"but I sing like a bird.\"    \"Raven, or crow?\" asked the Glass Cat.    \"Like a song bird. I'll prove it. I'll sing a song I composed myself.  Don't tell anyone I'm a poet; they might want me to write a book. Don't  tell 'em I can sing, or they'd want me to make records for that awful  phonograph. Haven't time to be a public benefactor, so I'll just sing  you this little song for your own amusement.\"    They were glad enough to be entertained, and listened with interest  while the Shaggy Man chanted the following verses to a tune that was  not unpleasant:        \"I'll sing a song of Ozland, where wondrous creatures dwell      And fruits and flowers and shady bowers abound in every dell,      Where magic is a science and where no one shows surprise      If some amazing thing takes place before his very eyes.        Our Ruler's a bewitching girl whom fairies love to please;      She's always kept her magic sceptre to enforce decrees      To make her people happy, for her heart is kind and true      And to aid the needy and distressed is what she longs to do.        And then there's Princess Dorothy, as sweet as any rose,      A lass from Kansas, where they don't grow fairies, I suppose;      And there's the brainy Scarecrow, with a body stuffed with straw,      Who utters words of wisdom rare that fill us all with awe.        I'll not forget Nick Chopper, the Woodman made of Tin,      Whose tender heart thinks killing time is quite a dreadful sin,      Nor old Professor Woggle-Bug, who's highly magnified      And looks so big to everyone that he is filled with pride.        Jack Pumpkinhead's a dear old chum who might be called a chump,      But won renown by riding round upon a magic Gump;      The Sawhorse is a splendid steed and though he's made of wood      He does as many thrilling stunts as any meat horse could.        And now I'll introduce a beast that ev'ryone adores--      The Cowardly Lion shakes with fear 'most ev'ry time he roars,      And yet he does the bravest things that any lion might,      Because he knows that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/956"],[0,"Tik-Tok of Oz (#13)"],[1,"me-thing queer will hap-pen to the King of  the Nomes.\"    \"I wonder what 'twill be,\" said Betsy.    The Private Citizen--otherwise known as Tititi-Hoochoo, the Great  Jinjin--looked at the little girl steadily.    \"I will presently decide what is to happen to Ruggedo,\" said he in a  hard, stern voice. Then, turning to the throng of Kings and Queens, he  continued: \"Tik-Tok has spoken truly, for his machinery will not allow  him to lie, nor will it allow his thoughts to think falsely. Therefore  these people are not our enemies and must be treated with consideration  and justice. Take them to your palaces and entertain them as guests  until to-morrow, when I command that they be brought again to my  Residence. By then I shall have formed my plans.\"    No sooner had Tititi-Hoochoo spoken than he disappeared from sight.  Immediately after, most of the Kings and Queens likewise disappeared.  But several of them remained visible and approached the strangers with  great respect. One of the lovely Queens said to Betsy:    \"I trust you will honor me by being my guest. I am Erma, Queen of  Light.\"    \"May Hank come with me?\" asked the girl.    \"The King of Animals will care for your mule,\" was the reply. \"But do  not fear for him, for he will be treated royally. All of your party  will be reunited on the morrow.\"    \"I--I'd like to have _some_ one with me,\" said Betsy, pleadingly.    Queen Erma looked around and smiled upon Polychrome.    \"Will the Rainbow's Daughter be an agreeable companion?\" she asked.    \"Oh, yes!\" exclaimed the girl.    So Polychrome and Betsy became guests of the Queen of Light, while  other beautiful Kings and Queens took charge of the others of the party.    The two girls followed Erma out of the hall and through the gardens of  the Residence to a village of pretty dwellings. None of these was so  large or imposing as the castle of the Private Citizen, but all were  handsome enough to be called palaces--as, in fact, they really were.          Chapter Twelve    The Lovely Lady of Light      The palace of the Queen of Light stood on a little eminence and was a  mass of crystal windows, surmounted by a vast crystal dome. When they  entered the portals Erma was greeted by six lovely maidens, evidently  of high degree, who at once aroused Betsy's admiration. Each bore a  wand in her hand, tipped with an emblem of light, and their costumes  were also emblematic of the lights they represented. Erma introduced  them to her guests and each made a graceful and courteous  acknowledgment.    First was Sunlight, radiantly beautiful and very fair; the second was  Moonlight, a soft, dreamy damsel with nut-brown hair; next came  Starlight, equally lovely but inclined to be retiring and shy. These  three were dressed in shimmering robes of silvery white. The fourth was  Daylight, a brilliant damsel with laughing eyes and frank manners, who  wore a variety of colors. Then came Firelight, clothed in a fleecy  flame-colored robe that wavered around her shapely form in a very  attractive manner. The sixth maiden, Electra, was the most beautiful of  all, and Betsy thought from the first that both Sunlight and Daylight  regarded Electra with envy and were a little jealous of her.    But all were cordial in their greetings to the strangers and seemed to  regard the Queen of Light with much affection, for they fluttered  around her in a flashing, radiant group as she led the way to her regal  drawing-room.    This apartment was richly and cosily furnished, the upholstery being of  many tints, and both Betsy and Polychrome enjoyed resting themselves  upon the downy divans after their strenuous adventures of the day.    The Queen sat down to chat with her guests, who noticed that Daylight  was the only maiden now seated beside Erma. The others had retired to  another part of the room, where they sat modestly with entwined arms  and did not intrude themselves at all.    The Queen told the strangers all about this beautiful land, which is  one of the chief residences of fairies who minister to the needs of  mankind. So many important fairies lived there that, to avoid rivalry,  they had elected as their Ruler the only important personage in the  country who had no duties to mankind to perform and was, in effect, a  Private Citizen. This Ruler, or Jinjin, as was his title, bore the name  of Tititi-Hoochoo, and the most singular thing about him was that he  had no heart. But instead of this he possessed a high degree of Reason  and Justice and while he showed no mercy in his judgments he never  punished unjustly or without reason. To wrong-doers Tititi-Hoochoo was  as terrible as he was heartless, but those who were innocent of evil  had nothing to fear from him.    All the Kings and Queens of this fairyland paid reverence to Jinjin,  for as they expected to be obeyed by others they were willing to obey  the one in authority over them.    The inhabitants of the Land of Oz had heard many tales of this  fearfully just Jinjin, whose punishments were always equal to the  faults committed. Polychrome also knew of him, although this was the  first time she had ever seen him face to face. But to Betsy the story  was all new, and she was greatly interested in Tititi-Hoochoo, whom she  no longer feared.    Time sped swiftly during their talk and suddenly Betsy noticed that  Moonlight was sitting beside the Queen of Light, instead of Daylight.    \"But tell me, please,\" she pleaded, \"why do you all wear a dragon's  head embroidered on your gowns?\"    Erma's pleasant face became grave as she answered:    \"The Dragon, as you must know, was the first living creature ever made;  therefore the Dragon is the oldest and wisest of living things. By good  fortune the Original Dragon, who still lives, is a resident of this  land and supplies us with wisdom whenever we are in need of it. He is  old as the world and remembers everything that has happened since the  world was created.\"    \"Did he ever have any children?\" inquired the girl.    \"Yes, many of them. Some wandered into other lands, where men, not  understanding them, made war upon them; but many still reside in this  country. None, however, is as wise as the Original Dragon, for whom we  have great respect. As he was the first resident here, we wear the  emblem of the dragon's head to show that we are the favored people who  alone have the right to inhabit this fairyland, which in beauty almost  equals the Fairyland of Oz, and in power quite surpasses it.\"    \"I understand about the dragon, now,\" said Polychrome, nodding her  lovely head. Betsy did not quite understand, but she was at present  interested in observing the changing lights. As Daylight had given way  to Moonlight, so now Starlight sat at the right hand of Erma the Queen,  and with her coming a spirit of peace and content seemed to fill the  room. Polychrome, being herself a fairy, had many questions to ask  about the various Kings and Queens who lived in this far-away, secluded  place, and before Erma had finished answering them a rosy glow filled  the room and Firelight took her place beside the Queen.    Betsy liked Firelight, but to gaze upon her warm and glowing features  made the little girl sleepy, and presently she began to nod. Thereupon  Erma rose and took Betsy's hand gently in her own.    \"Come,\" said she; \"the feast time has arrived and the feast is spread.\"    \"That's nice,\" exclaimed the small mortal. \"Now that I think of it, I'm  awful hungry. But p'raps I can't eat your fairy food.\"    The Queen smiled and led her to a doorway. As she pushed aside a heavy  drapery a flood of silvery light greeted them, and Betsy saw before her  a splendid banquet hall, with a table spread with snowy linen and  crystal and silver. At one side was a broad, throne-like seat for Erma  and beside her now sat the brilliant maid Electra. Polychrome was  placed on the Queen's right hand and Betsy upon her left. The other  five messengers of light now waited upon them, and each person was  supplied with just the food she liked best. Polychrome found her dish  of dewdrops, all fresh and sparkling, while Betsy was so lavishly  served that she decided she had never in her life eaten a dinner half  so good.    \"I s'pose,\" she said to the Queen, \"that Miss Electra is the youngest  of all these girls.\"    \"Why do you suppose that?\" inquired Erma, with a smile.    \"'Cause electric'ty is the newest light we know of. Didn't Mr. Edison  discover it?\"    \"Perhaps he was the first mortal to discover it,\" replied the Queen.  \"But electricity was a part of the world from its creation, and  therefore my Electra is as old as Daylight or Moonlight, and equally  beneficent to mortals and fairies alike.\"    Betsy was thoughtful for a time. Then she remarked, as she looked at  the six messengers of light:    \"We couldn't very well do without any of 'em; could we?\"    Erma laughed softly. \"_I_ couldn't, I'm sure,\" she replied, \"and I think  mortals would miss any one of my maidens, as well. Daylight cannot take  the place of Sunlight, which gives us strength and energy. Moonlight is  of value when Daylight, worn out with her long watch, retires to rest.  If the moon in its course is hidden behind the earth's rim, and my  sweet Moonlight cannot cheer us, Starlight takes her place, for the  skies always lend her power. Without Firelight we should miss much of  our warmth and comfort, as well as much cheer when the walls of houses  encompass us. But always, when other lights forsake us, our glorious  Electra is ready to flood us with bright rays. As Queen of Light, I  love all my maidens, for I know them to be faithful and true.\"    \"I love 'em, too!\" declared Betsy. \"But sometimes, when I'm _real_  sleepy, I can get along without any light at all.\"    \"Are you sleepy now?\" inquired Erma, for the feast had ended.    \"A little,\" admitted the girl.    So Electra showed her to a pretty chamber where there was a soft, white  bed, and waited patiently until"]]]
