The  comparative silence of the Old Testament concerning immortality is one  of its most impressive mysteries. However dimly shadowed by Job and  David and Isaiah, it seems to have been brought to light only by the  gospel. There is more in the writings of Plato and Cicero about  immortality than in the whole of the Old Testament, And this fact is so  remarkable, that some trace to the sages of Greece and Egypt the  doctrine itself, as ordinarily understood; that is, a _necessary_  existence of the soul after death. And they fortify themselves with  those declarations of the apostles which represent a happy immortality  as the special gift of God,--not a necessary existence, but given only  to those who obey his laws. If immortality be not a gift, but a  necessary existence, as Socrates supposed, it seems strange that heathen  philosophers should have speculated more profoundly than the patriarchs  of the East on this mysterious subject. We cannot suppose that Plato was  more profoundly instructed on such a subject than Abraham and Moses. It  is to be noted, however, that God seems to have chosen different  races for various missions in the education of his children. As  Saint Paul puts it, \"There are diversities of gifts, but the same  Spirit,... diversities of workings, but the same God who worketh in  all.\" The Hebrew genius was that of discerning and declaring moral and  spiritual truth; while that of the Greeks was essentially philosophic  and speculative, searching into the reasons and causes of existing  phenomena. And it is possible, after all, that the loftiest of the Greek  philosophers derived their opinions from those who had been admitted to  the secret schools of Egypt, where it is probable that the traditions of  primitive ages were preserved, and only communicated to a chosen few;  for the ancient schools were esoteric and not popular. The great masters  of knowledge believed one thing and the people another. The popular  religion was always held in contempt by the wise in all countries,  although upheld by them in external rites and emblems and sacrifices,  from patriotic purposes. The last act of Socrates was to sacrifice a  cock to Esculapius, with a different meaning from that which was  understood by the people.    The social and civil code of Moses seems to have had primary reference  to the necessary isolation of the Jews, to keep them from the  abominations of other nations, and especially idolatry, and even to make  them repulsive and disagreeable to foreigners, in order to keep them a  peculiar people. The Jew wore an uncouth dress. When he visited  strangers he abstained from their customs, and even meats. When a  stranger visited the Jew he was compelled to submit to Jewish  restraints. So that the Jew ever seems uncourteous, narrow, obstinate,  and grotesque: even as others appeared to him to be pagan and unclean.  Moses lays down laws best calculated to keep the nation separated and  esoteric; but there is marvellous wisdom in those which were directed to  the development of national resources and general prosperity in an  isolated state. The nation was made strong for defence, not for  aggression. It must depend upon its militia, and not on horses and  chariots, which are designed for distant expeditions, for the pomp of  kings, for offensive war, and military aggrandizement. The legislation  of Moses recognized the peaceful virtues rather than the  warlike,--agricultural industry, the network of trades and professions,  manufacturing skill, production, not waste and destruction. He  discouraged commerce, not because it was in itself demoralizing, but  because it brought the Jews too much in contact with corrupt nations.  And he closely defined political power, and divided it among different  magistrates, instituting a wise balance which would do credit to modern  legislation. He gave dignity to the people by making them the ultimate  source of authority, next to the authority of God. He instituted  legislative assemblies to discuss peace and war, and elect the great  officers of state. While he made the Church support the State, and the  State the Church, yet he separated civil power from the religious, as  Calvin did at Geneva. The functions of the priest and the functions of  the magistrate were made forever distinct,--a radical change from the  polity of Egypt, where kings were priests, and priests were civil rulers  as well as a literary class; a predominating power to whom all vital  interests were intrusted. The kingly power among the Jews was checked  and hedged by other powers, so that an overgrown tyranny was difficult  and unusual. But above all kingly and priestly power was the power of  the Invisible King, to whom the judges and monarchs and supreme  magistrates were responsible, as simply His delegates and vicegerents.  Upon Him alone the Jews were to rely in all crises of danger; in Him  alone was help. And it is remarkable that whenever Jewish rulers relied  on chariots and horses and foreign allies, they were delivered into the  hands of their enemies. It was only when they fell back upon the  protecting arms of their Eternal Lord that they were rescued and saved.  The mightiest monarch ruled only with delegated powers from Him; and it  was the memorable loyalty of David to his King which kept him on the  throne, as it was self-reliance--the exhibition of independent  power--which caused the sceptre to depart from Saul.    I cannot dwell on the humanity and wisdom which marked the social  economy of the Jews, as given by Moses,--in the treatment of slaves  (emancipated every fifty years), in the sanctity of human life, in the  liberation of debtors every seven years, in kindness to the poor (who  were allowed to glean the fields), in the education of the people, in  the division of inherited property, in the inalienation of paternal  inheritances, in the discouragement of all luxury and extravagance, in  those regulations which made disproportionate fortunes difficult, the  vast accumulation of which was one of the main causes of the decline of  the Roman Empire, and is now one of the most threatening evils of modern  civilization. All the civil and social laws of the Jewish commonwealth  tended to the elevation of woman and the cultivation of domestic life.  What virtues were gradually developed among those sensual slaves whom  Moses led through the desert! In what ancient nation were seen such  respect to parents, such fidelity to husbands, such charming delights of  home, such beautiful simplicities, such ardent loves, such glorious  friendships, such regard to the happiness of others!    Such, in brief, was the great work which Moses performed, the marvellous  legislation which he gave to the Israelites, involving principles  accepted by the Christian world in every age of its history. Now,  whence had this man this wisdom? Was it the result of his studies and  reflections and experiences, or was it a wisdom supernaturally taught  him by the Almighty? On the solution of this inquiry into the divine  legation of Moses hang momentous issues. It is too grand and important  an inquiry to be disregarded by any one who studies the writings of  Moses; it is too suggestive a subject to be passed over even in a  literary discourse, for this age is grappling with it in most earnest  struggles. No matter whether or not Moses was gifted in a most  extraordinary degree to write his code. Nobody doubts his transcendent  genius; nobody doubts his wonderful preparation. If any uninspired man  could have written it, doubtless it was he. It was the most learned and  accomplished of the apostles who was selected to be the expounder of the  gospel among the Gentiles; so it was the ablest man born among the Jews  who was chosen to give them a national polity. Nor does it detract from  his fame as a man of genius that he did not originate the most profound  of his declarations. It was fame enough to be the oracle and prophet of  Jehovah. I would not dishonor the source of all wisdom, even to magnify  the abilities of a great man, fond as critics are of exalting the wisdom  of Moses as a triumph of human genius. It is natural to worship  strength, human or divine. We adore mind; we glorify oracles. But  neither written history nor philosophy will support the work of Moses as  a wonder of mere human intellect, without ignoring the declarations of  Moses himself and the settled belief of all Christian ages.    It is not my object to make an argument in defence of the divine  legation of Moses; nor is it my design to reply to the learned  criticisms of those who doubt or deny his statements. I would not run  a-tilt against modern science, which may hereafter explain and accept  what it now rejects. Science--whether physical or metaphysical--has its  great truths, and so has Revelation; the realm of each is distinct while  yet their processes are incomplete: and it is the hope and firm belief  of many God-fearing scientists that the patient, reverent searching of  to-day into God's works, of matter and of mind, as it collects the  myriad facts and classifies them into such orderly sequences as indicate  the laws of their being, will confirm to men's reason their faith in the  revealed Word. Certainly this is a consummation devoutly to be wished. I  am not scientist enough to judge of its probability, but it is within my  province to present a few deductions which can be fairly drawn from the  denial of the inspiration of the Mosaic Code. I wish to show to what  conclusions this denial logically leads.    We must remember that Moses himself"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10479"],[0,"Our Churches and Chapels: Their Parsons, Priests, & Congregations (#14)"],[1,"of oxygen and hydrogen, of nitrogen and  carbonic acid gas; they had read in scientific books that every  human being requires so many feet of breathing room; and after  deciding upon the number of worshippers which the meeting-house  should accommodate, they agreed to elevate its ceiling in the ratio  of their inspiring and expiring necessities. This was a very good,  salutary, Quakerly idea, and although it may have operated against  the internal appearance of the building it has guaranteed purity of  air to those attending it.    The meeting house is a quiet, secluded, well-made place; but it has  a poor entrance, which you would fancy led to nowhere. A stranger  passing along Friargate on an ordinary day, would never find the  Quakers' meeting house. He might notice at a certain point on the  north-eastern side of that undulating and bustling public  thoroughfare a grey looking gable, having a three-light-window  towards the head, with a large door below, and at its base two  washing pots and a long butter mug, belonging to an industrious  earthenware dealer next door; but he would never fancy that the  disciples of George Fox had a front entrance there to their meeting  house. Yet after passing through a dim broad passage here, and  mounting half a dozen substantial steps, you see a square, neat-  looking, five-windowed building, and this is the Quakers' meeting  house.    Over the passage there is a pretty large room, which is used by the  Friends for Sunday school purposes. The attendance at this school on  ordinary occasions is about 60; at special periods it is  considerably more. During the cotton famine, a few years ago, when  the Quakers were manifesting their proverbial charity--giving money,  food, and clothing--the attendance averaged 160; and if it was known  that they were going to give something extra tomorrow it would reach  that point again. Speaking of the charity of Quakers, it may not be  amiss to state that they keep all their own poor--do not allow any  one belonging their society ever to solicit aid from the parish, or  migrate in the dark hour of poverty to the workhouse. Reverting to  the meeting-house, we may observe that just within its front door  particular provision has been made for umbrellas. There is a long,  low stand, with a channel below it, and this will afford ample  accomodation for about 160 umbrellas. Taking into account the  average attendance at the meeting-house, we have come to the serious  conclusion that if every member carried two umbrellas on wet  Sundays, the said umbrellas could be legitimately provided for. It  is not a pleasant thing for a man to carry a couple of umbrellas,  and we believe it has been found very difficult for any one to put  up and use two at the same time; still it is satisfactory to know  that if ever the Friends of Preston decide upon such a course, there  will be plenty of provision for their umbrellas at the meeting  house.    The inside of the general building is severely plain. There is no  decoration of any description about it, and if the gas pipes running  along the side walls had not a slight Hogarthian line of beauty  touch in their form, everything would look absolutely horizontal and  perpendicular. The seats are plain and strong with open backs. A few  of them have got green cushions running the whole length of the  form. In some small cushions are dotted down here and there for  individual worshippers, who can at any time easily take them up, put  them under their arm, and move from one place to another if they  wish for a change of location. Over the front entrance there is a  gallery, but ordinarily it is empty. There is no pulpit in the  house, and no description of books--neither bibles, nor hymn-books,  nor prayer-books--can be seen anywhere. At the head of the place  there is an elevated strongly-fronted bench, running from one side  to the other, and below it an open form of similar length. The more  matured Quakers and Quakeresses generally gravitate hitherwards. The  males have separate places and so have the females. It is expected  that the former will always direct their steps to the seats on the  right-hand side; that the latter will occupy those on the left; and,  generally, you find them on opposite sides in strict accordance with  this idea. There is nothing to absolutely prevent an enraptured  swain from sitting at the elbow of his love, and basking in the  sunlight of her eyes, nor to stop an elderly man from nestling  peacefully under the wing of his spouse; but it is understood that  they will not do this, and will at least submit to a deed of  separation during hours of worship. In addition to the 70 actual  members of the society there are about 60 persons in Preston who pay  a sort of nominal homage at the shrine of George Fox.    They have two meetings every Sunday, morning and evening, and one  every Thursday--at half-past ten in the morning during winter  months, and at seven in the evening in summer. The average  attendance at each of the Sunday meetings is about 70. The character  of the services is quite unsettled. Throughout Christendom the rule  in religious edifices is to have a preliminary service, and then a  discourse; in Quaker meeting houses there is no such defined course  of action. Sometimes there is a prayer, then another, then an  \"exhortation\"--Quakers have no sermons; at other times an  exhortation without any prayer; now and then a prayer without any  exhortation; and occasionally they have neither the one nor the  other--they fall into a state of profound silence, keep  astonishingly quiet ever so long, with their eyes shut, and then  walk out. This is called silent meditation. If a pin drops whilst  this is going on you can hear it and tell in which part of the house  it is lying. You can feel the quietude, see the stillness; it is  \"tranquil and herd-like--as in the pasture--'forty feeding like  one;'\" it is sadly serene, placidly mysterous, like the  \"uncommunicating muteness of fishes;\" and you wonder how it is kept  up. To those who believe in solemn reticence--in motionless  communion with the \"inner light,\"--there is nothing curious in this;  it is, in fact, often a source of high spiritual ecstacy; but to an  unitiated spectator the business looks seriously funny, and its  continuance for any length of time causes the mind of such a one to  run in all kinds of dreadfully ludicrous grooves.    Quakers don't believe in singing, and have no faith in sacred music  of any kind. Neither the harp, nor the sackbut, nor the psaltery,  nor the dulcimer will they have; neither organs nor bass fiddles  will they countenance; neither vocalists nor instrumentalists, nor  tune forks of any size or weight, will they patronise. They permit  one another to enter and remain in their meeting house with the hat  on or off, and with the hands either in the pockets or out of them.  They have no regular ministers, and allow either men or women to  speak. None, except Quakers and Ranters--the two most extreme  sections of the religious community, so far as quietude and noise  are concerned--permit this; and it is a good thing for the world  that the system is not extended beyond their circles. If women were  allowed to speak at some places of worship they would all be talking  at once--all be growing eloquent, voluble, and strong minded in two  minutes--and an articulative mystification, much more chaotic than  that which once took place at Babel, would ensue. At the meeting  house in Friargate it is taken for granted that on Sundays the  morning service lasts for an hour and a half, and the evening one an  hour and a quarter; but practically the time is regulated by the  feelings of the worshippers--they come and go as they are \"moved,\"  and that is a liberal sort of measure harmonising well with human  nature and its varied requirements.    We have paid more than one visit to this meeting house. The other  Sunday evening we were there. The congregation at that time numbered  just thirty-two--fifteen men, twelve women, two boys, and three  girls. This was rather a small assemblage for a place which will  hold between 500 and 600 persons; but it might be gratifying to the  shades of its chemistry-loving, cubic-feet-of-air-admiring  designers, for they would at any rate have the lively satisfaction  of knowing that none of the famous 32 would suffer through want of  breathing space. The members of the congregation came in at various  times; four were there at half-past six; the remainder had got  safely seated, in every instance, by ten minutes to seven. All the  males made their appearance with their hats on; some pulled them off  the moment they got seated; two or three seemed to get their  convictions gradually intensified on the subject, and in about ten  minutes came to the conclusion that they could do without their  hats; some who had cast aside their castors at an early period  reinstated them; whilst odd ones kept on their head coverings during  the entire meeting. For 45 minutes, not the least effort in any  lingual direction was made; no one said a word for three-quarters of  an hour. There was a good deal of stirring on the forms, and  creaking sounds were periodically heard; the whole indicating that  the sitting posture had become uneasy, and that the paint, through  warmth, had got tenacious. There was, however, neither talking nor  whispering indulged in. The elderly Quakers, with their broad-  brimmed, substantial hats, and white neckcloths, kept their eyes  closed for a season, then opened them and looked ahead pensively,  then shut them serenely again,--just    As men of inward light are wont  To turn their optics to upon 't.    The Quakeresses on the other side followed a similar programme. We  saw only three of them in the olden dress--only three with narrow-  barrelled high crowned bonnets, made of brown silk and garnished  with white silk strings. The younger"]]]
