[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14555"],[0,"William Lloyd Garrison, the Abolitionist (#14)"],[1,".\" This  comprehensive and aggressive plan of campaign signalized the rise of an  Abolitionism wholly unlike the Abolitionism of any previous time in the  history of the country. It did in fact date the opening of a new era in  the slavery struggle in America.    With Northern indifference and apathy on the subject of emancipation,  Garrison's previous visit to the North had acquainted him. Their  existence he saw interposed the main obstacle to the success of his new  venture in journalism. \"The cause of this callous state of feeling,\" he  believed, \"was owing to their exceeding ignorance of the horrors of  slavery.\" He accordingly made up his mind to throw the light which he  possessed into the midst of this darkness. He had written in prison  three lectures on \"Slavery and Colonization.\" What better could he now  do than to deliver those lectures at the North? If the good people and  their religious leaders knew what he knew, they would presently feel as  he did on the question. He was loath to leave Baltimore without giving  this testimony against slavery. But unable to procure a room for this  purpose was finally compelled to content himself with the witness he had  already borne in the _Genius_ and in prison in behalf of the slave. In  Philadelphia he well-nigh failed to obtain a hall for his lectures, but  did finally succeed in getting the Franklin Institute, where, to small  audiences, he lifted up his voice against the iniquity of the times. He  repeated his lectures in New York, New Haven, and Hartford. But not many  came out to hear him. The nation, its churches, and politicians had  thrust their fingers in their ears to every cry coming up from the  slave. Why should they go to sup with a madman on horrors, with which as  patriotic people they were forbidden to concern themselves. And so for  the most part Garrison could do nothing with communities, which had  eyes, but obstinately refused to see with them upon any subject relating  to the abominations of slavery. In his own town of Newburyport, officers  of Christian churches not only refused to hear his message themselves,  but debarred others from listening to the woes and wrongs of  fellow-creatures in bondage. As Mr. Garrison truly said at the time: \"If  I had visited Newburyport to plead the cause of twenty white men in  chains, every hall and every meeting-house would have been thrown open,  and the fervor of my discourses anticipated and exceeded by my  fellow-townsmen. The fact that two millions of colored beings are  groaning in bondage, in this land of liberty, excites no interest nor  pity.\" If these damning facts are remembered sixty years after their  occurrence to the shame of the trustees of the two churches, viz., the  Presbyterian Church on Harris street and the Second Congregational  Church, it is also remembered to the honor of the two pastors, Rev. Dr.  Daniel Dana, and the Rev. Dr. Luther F. Dimmick, that they had thrown  open to the prophet the doors of their meeting-houses, which the  trustees afterward slammed in his face.    In Boston the same hard luck followed him. In all that city of Christian  churches he could not obtain the use of a single meeting-house, \"in  which to vindicate the rights of TWO MILLIONS of American citizens, who  are now groaning in servile chains in this boasted land of liberty; and  also to propose just, benevolent, and constitutional measures for their  relief.\" So ran an advertisement in the Boston _Courier_ of the sorely  tried soul. For two weeks he had gone up and down the town in search of  a room free of cost, in which to deliver his message. The door of every  sanctuary was locked against his cause. It was then, as a final  recourse, that he turned to the _Courier_, and made his last appeal to  the Christian charity of the city. The prayer of the prophet was  answered from an unexpected quarter. It was that ecclesiastical dragon  of the times, Abner Kneeland, and his society of \"blasphemers,\" who  proved afresh the truth of that scripture which says: \"Not every one  that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven;  but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.\" It was they  that gave to liberty a hearing, to the prophet of righteousness a chance  to deliver his message. It was in their meeting-house, in Julian Hall,  that Garrison gave his lectures, giving the first one on the evening of  October 15, 1830.    Samuel J. May, who was present, has preserved his impressions of the  lecture and lecturer. \"Never before,\" he records many years afterward,  \"was I so affected by the speech of man. When he had ceased speaking I  said to those around me: 'That is a providential man; he is a prophet;  he will shake our nation to its center, but he will shake slavery out of  it. We ought to know him, we ought to help him. Come, let us go and give  him our hands.' Mr. Sewall and Mr. Alcott went up with me and we  introduced each other. I said to him, 'Mr. Garrison, I am not sure that  I can indorse all you have said this evening. Much of it requires  careful consideration. But I am prepared to embrace you. I am sure you  are called to a great work, and I mean to help you.' Mr. Sewall  cordially assured him of his readiness also to cooperate with him. Mr.  Alcott invited him to his home. He went and we sat with him until twelve  that night, listening to his discourse, in which he showed plainly that  _immediate, unconditional emancipation, without expatriation, was the  right of every slave, and could not be withheld by his master an hour  without sin_. That night my soul was baptised in his spirit, and ever  since I have been a disciple and fellow-laborer of William Lloyd  Garrison.\" A new force had arisen in our history, and a new epoch had  broken bolts for humanity.            CHAPTER IV.        THE HOUR AND THE MAN.      The providential man was not yet twenty-five. In personal appearance he  was quite the reverse of his friend Lundy. Garrison was gifted with a  body that matched his mind, strong, straight, sound in every part, and  proportioned in every member. As he stood he was much above the medium  height. His dark hair had already partially left the crown of the high  dome-shaped head. His forehead combined height with breadth, which,  taken in connection with the brown eyes covered with the now habitual  glasses, lent to his countenance a striking air of moral serenity and  elevation. Force, firmness, no ordinary self-reliance and courage found  masterly expression in the rest of the face. There was through the whole  physical man a nice blending of strength and delicacy of structure. The  impression of fineness and finish was perhaps mainly owing to the  woman-like purity and freshness of skin and color, which overspread the  virile lines and features of the face from brow to chin. What one saw in  that face was the quality of justice made flesh, good-will to men  personified.    This characterization of the reformer's countenance may be considered  absurd by some readers. But absurd it is not. People who had read his  stern denunciations of slave-holding and slaveholders, and who had  formed their image of the man from his \"hard language\" and their own  prejudices could not recognize the original when they met him. His  manner was peculiarly winning and attractive, and in personal  intercourse almost instantly disarmed hostility. The even gentleness of  his rich voice, his unfailing courtesy and good temper, his quick eye  for harmless pleasantries, his hearty laugh, the Quaker-like calmness,  deliberateness, and meekness, with which he would meet objections and  argue the righteousness of his cause, his sweet reasonableness and  companionableness were in strange contrast to popular misconceptions and  caricatures of him. No one needed to be persuaded, who had once  conversed with him, that there was no hatred or vindictiveness in his  severities of language toward slaveholders. That he was no Jacobin, no  enemy of society, was perceived the moment one looked into his grave,  kind face, or caught the warm accents of his pacific tones, or listened  to the sedate intensity, and humanity of his discourses on the enormity  of American slavery as they fell from him in conversations between man  and man. Here is a case in point, a typical incident in the life of the  reformer; it occurred, it is true, when he was twenty-seven, but it  might have occurred at twenty-five quite as well; it is narrated by  Samuel J. May in his recollections of the anti-slavery conflict: On his  way from New York to Philadelphia with Garrison, Mr. May fell into a  discussion with a pro-slavery passenger on the vexed question of the  day. There was the common pro-slavery reasoning, which May answered as  well as he was able. Presently Mr. Garrison drew near the disputants,  whereupon May took the opportunity to shift the anti-slavery burden of  the contention to his leader's shoulders. All of his most radical and  unpopular Abolition doctrines Garrison immediately proceeded to expound  to his opponent. \"After a long conversation,\" says Mr. May, \"which  attracted as many as could get within hearing, the gentleman said,  courteously: 'I have been much interested, sir, in what you have said,  and in the exceedingly frank and temperate manner in which you have  treated the subject. If all Abolitionists were like you, there would be  much less opposition to your enterprise. But, sir, depend upon it, that  hair-brained, reckless, violent fanatic, Garrison, will damage, if he  does not shipwreck, any cause.' Stepping forward, I replied, 'Allow me,  sir, to introduce you to Mr. Garrison, of whom you entertain so bad an  opinion. The gentleman you have been talking with is he.'\"    Or take Harriet Martineau's first impressions on seeing him. \"His aspect  put to flight in an instant what prejudices his slanderers had raised in  me. I was wholly taken by surprise. It was a countenance"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14558"],[0,"Darwinism (1889) (#14)"],[1," Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1871. In this work exact measurements are  given of all the chief external parts of a large number of species of  common American birds, from twenty to sixty or more specimens of each  species being measured, so that we are able to determine with some  precision the nature and extent of the variation that usually occurs.  Mr. Allen says: \"The facts of the case show that a variation of from 15  to 20 per cent in general size, and an equal degree of variation in the  relative size of different parts, may be ordinarily expected among  specimens of the same species and sex, taken at the same locality, while  in some cases the variation is even greater than this.\" He then goes on  to show that each part varies to a considerable extent independently of  the other parts; so that when the size varies, the proportions of all  the parts vary, often to a much greater amount. The wing and tail, for  example, besides varying in length, vary in the proportionate length of  each feather, and this causes their outline to vary considerably in  shape. The bill also varies in length, width, depth, and curvature. The  tarsus varies in length, as does each toe separately and independently;  and all this not to a minute degree requiring very careful measurement  to detect it at all, but to an amount easily seen without any  measurement, as it averages one-sixth of the whole length and often  reaches one-fourth. In twelve species of common perching birds the wing  varied (in from twenty-five to thirty specimens) from 14 to 21 per cent  of the mean length, and the tail from 13.8 to 23.4 per cent. The  variation of the form of the wing can be very easily tested by noting  which feather is longest, which next in length, and so on, the  respective feathers being indicated by the numbers 1, 2, 3, etc.,  commencing with the outer one. As an example of the irregular variation  constantly met with, the following occurred among twenty-five specimens  of Dendroeca coronata. Numbers bracketed imply that the corresponding  feathers were of equal length.[20]          RELATIVE LENGTHS OF PRIMARY WING FEATHERS OF      DENDROECA CORONATA.      ---------+-----------+----------+-----------+----------+----------      Longest. | Second in | Third in | Fourth in | Fifth in | Sixth in               |  Length.  |  Length. |  Length.  |  Length. |  Length.      ---------+-----------+----------+-----------+----------+----------      2        |     3     |     1    |     4     |     5    |     6      3        |     2     |     4    |     1     |     5    |     6               |  /  2     |          |           |          |      3        | {         |     1    |     5     |     6    |     7               |  \\  4     |          |           |          |      2    \\   |           |          |           |          |            }  |     4     |     1    |     5     |     6    |     7      3    /   |           |          |           |          |      2    \\   |           |          |           |          |      1     |  |           |          |           |          |             } |     5     |     6    |     7     |     8    |     9      3     |  |           |          |           |          |      4    /   |           |          |           |          |      ---------+-----------+----------+-----------+----------+----------      Here we have five very distinct proportionate lengths of the wing  feathers, any one of which is often thought sufficient to characterise a  distinct species of bird; and though this is rather an extreme case, Mr.  Allen assures us that \"the comparison, extended in the table to only a  few species, has been carried to scores of others with similar results.\"    Along with this variation in size and proportions there occurs a large  amount of variation in colour and markings. \"The difference in intensity  of colour between the extremes of a series of fifty or one hundred  specimens of any species, collected at a single locality, and nearly at  the same season of the year, is often as great as occurs between truly  distinct species.\" But there is also a great amount of individual  variability in the markings of the same species. Birds having the  plumage varied with streaks and spots differ exceedingly in different  individuals of the same species in respect to the size, shape, and  number of these marks, and in the general aspect of the plumage  resulting from such variations. \"In the common song sparrow (Melospiza  melodia), the fox-coloured sparrow (Passerella iliaca), the swamp  sparrow (Melospiza palustris), the black and white creeper (Mniotilta  varia), the water-wagtail (Seiurus novaeboracencis), in Turdus  fuscescens and its allies, the difference in the size of the streaks is  often very considerable. In the song sparrow they vary to such an extent  that in some cases they are reduced to narrow lines; in others so  enlarged as to cover the greater part of the breast and sides of the  body, sometimes uniting on the middle of the breast into a nearly  continuous patch.\"    Mr. Allen then goes on to particularise several species in which such  variations occur, giving cases in which two specimens taken at the same  place on the same day exhibited the two extremes of coloration. Another  set of variations is thus described: \"The white markings so common on  the wings and tails of birds, as the bars formed by the white tips of  the greater wing-coverts, the white patch occasionally present at the  base of the primary quills, or the white band crossing them, and the  white patch near the end of the outer tail-feathers are also extremely  liable to variation in respect to their extent and the number of  feathers to which, in the same species, these markings extend.\" It is to  be especially noted that all these varieties are distinct from those  which depend on season, on age, or on sex, and that they are such as  have in many other species been considered to be of specific value.    These variations of colour could not be presented to the eye without a  series of carefully engraved plates, but in order to bring Mr. Allen's  _measurements_, illustrating variations of size and proportion, more  clearly before the reader, I have prepared a series of diagrams  illustrating the more important facts and their bearings on the  Darwinian theory.    The first of these is intended, mainly, to show the actual amount of the  variation, as it gives the true length of the wing and tail in the  extreme cases among thirty specimens of each of three species. The  shaded portion shows the minimum length, the unshaded portion the  additional length in the maximum. The point to be specially noted here  is, that in each of these common species there is about the same amount  of variation, and that it is so great as to be obvious at a glance.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Variation of Wings and Tail.]    There is here no question of \"minute\" or \"infinitesimal\" variation,  which many people suppose to be the only kind of variation that exists.  It cannot even be called small; yet from all the evidence we now possess  it seems to be the amount which characterises most of the common species  of birds.    It may be said, however, that these are the extreme variations, and only  occur in one or two individuals, while the great majority exhibit little  or no difference. Other diagrams will show that this is not the case;  but even if it were so, it would be no objection at all, because these  are the extremes among thirty specimens only. We may safely assume that  these thirty specimens, taken by chance, are not, in the case of all  these species, exceptional lots, and therefore we might expect at least  two similarly varying specimens in each additional thirty. But the  number of individuals, even in a very rare species, is probably thirty  thousand or more, and in a common species thirty, or even three hundred,  millions. Even one individual in each thirty, varying to the amount  shown in the diagram, would give at least a million in the total  population of any common bird, and among this million many would vary  much more than the extreme among thirty only. We should thus have a vast  body of individuals varying to a large extent in the length of the wings  and tail, and offering ample material for the modification of these  organs by natural selection. We will now proceed to show that other  parts of the body vary, simultaneously, but independently, to an equal  amount.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Dolichonyx oryzivorus. 20 Males.]    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Agelaeus phoeniceus. 40 Males.]    The first bird taken is the common Bob-o-link or Rice-bird (Dolichonyx  oryzivorus), and the Diagram, Fig. 4, exhibits the variations of seven  important characters in twenty male adult specimens.[21] These  characters are--the lengths of the body, wing, tail, tarsus, middle toe,  outer toe, and hind toe, being as many as can be conveniently exhibited  in one diagram. The length of the body is not given by Mr. Allen, but as  it forms a convenient standard of comparison, it has been obtained by  deducting the length of the tail from the total length of the birds as  given by him. The diagram has been constructed as follows:--The twenty  specimens are first arranged in a series according to the body-lengths  (which may be considered to give the size of the bird), from the  shortest to the longest, and the same number of vertical lines are  drawn, numbered from one to twenty. In this case (and wherever  practicable) the body-length is measured from the lower line of the  diagram, so that the actual length of the bird is exhibited as well as  the actual variations of length. These can be well estimated by means of  the horizontal line drawn at the mean between the two extremes, and it  will be seen that one-fifth of the total number of specimens taken on  either side exhibits a very large amount of variation, which would of  course be very much"]]]
