It was commonly reported that Maria, young  as she was, was the best bargainer in the land. She got her skins for  less than anybody else, and sold them for a higher price. With these  qualifications, she must, it was said, prove a jewel to Ivan, who was  not a close buyer nor a hard seller. But Ivan for some time remained  perfectly insensible both to these social advantages and the great  beauty of the lady. He met her often, and even roasted her more nuts  than any one else, which was a strong case of preference; but he did  not seem caught in the fair one's toils. He neither ate, nor slept,  nor amused himself one whit the less than when he first knew her. One  evening, however, as Maria handed him his tea, with a hot cake, Ivan,  whether owing to some peculiar smile on her face, or to the domestic  idea which the act suggested, seemed certainly very much struck, and  next day formally proposed. Maria laughed, and tossed her head, and  spoke a few good-natured words; and then, without either accepting  or rejecting him, hinted something about his youth, his want of  devotion to business, and his want of fortune. Ivan, a little warmly,  declared himself to be the best hunter in Yakoutsk, and hence the  most practically-experienced of any in the trade, and then gave the  sum-total of his possessions.    \"Just one quarter of what good old Vorotinska left me!\" replied the  prudent Maria.    \"But if I liked,\" replied Ivan, \"I could be the richest merchant in  Siberia.\"    \"How?\" asked Maria a little curiously, for the mere mention of wealth  was to her like powder to the war-horse.    \"Being almost the only Russian who has lived among the Yakoutas, I  know the secret of getting furs cheaper and easier than any one else.  Beside, if I chose to take a long journey, I could find ivory in vast  heaps. A tradition is current of an ivory mine in the north, which an  old Yakouta told me to be truth.\"    \"Very likely,\" said Maria, to whom the existence of the fossil ivory  of the mammoth in large masses was well known; \"but the _promich  lenicks_--trading companies--have long since stripped them.\"    \"Not this,\" cried Ivan; \"it is a virgin mine. It is away, away in  the Frozen Sea, and requires courage and enduring energy to find. Two  Yakoutas once discovered it. One was killed by the natives; the other  escaped, and is now an old man.\"    \"If you could find that,\" said Maria, \"you would be the first man in  Siberia, and the Czar himself would honor you.\"    \"And you?\" asked Ivan humbly.    \"Ivan Ivanovitch,\" replied Maria calmly, \"I like you better than any  man in Yakoutsk, but I should adore the great ivory merchant.\"    Ivan was delighted. He was a little puzzled by the character of the  lady, who, after marrying an old man for his fortune, seemed equally  desirous of reconciling her interest and her affections in a second  marriage. But very nice ideas are not those of the half-civilized, for  we owe every refinement both of mind and body to civilization, which  makes of the raw material man--full of undeveloped elements--what  cooking makes of the potato root. Civilization is the hot water  and fire which carry off the crudities, and bring forth the good  qualities.    However this maybe, Ivan nursed his idea. Apart from the sudden  passion which had invaded him, he had long allowed this fancy to  ferment in his brain. During his wandering evenings, a noted hunter  named Sakalar, claiming descent from the supposed Tartar founder  of the Yakoutas, had often narrated his perilous journey on sledges  across the Frozen Sea, his discovery of an ivory mine--that is, a vast  deposit of mammoths' tusks, generally found at considerable depth in  the earth, but here open to the grasp of all. He spoke of the thing  as a folly of his youth, which had cost the life of his dearest  friend, and never hinted at a renewed visit. But Ivan was resolved to  undertake the perilous adventure, and even to have Sakalar for his  guide.      II. THE YAKOUTA HUNTER.    Ivan slumbered not over his project. But a few days passed before  he was ready to start. He purchased the horses required, and packed  up all the varied articles necessary for his journey, and likely to  please his Yakouta friend, consisting of tea, rum, brandy, tobacco,  gunpowder, and other things of less moment. For himself he took a  couple of guns, a pair of pistols, some strong and warm clothes, an  iron pot for cooking, a kettle for his tea, with many minor articles  absolutely indispensable in the cold region he was about to visit. All  travelers in the north have found that ample food, and such drinks as  tea, are the most effectual protection against the climate; while oily  and fat meat is also an excellent preservative against cold. But Ivan  had no need to provide against this contingency. His Yakouta friend  knew the value of train-oil and grease, which are the staple luxuries  of Siberians, Kamschatkans, and Esquimaux alike.    The first part of Ivan's journey was necessarily to the _yourte_, or  wigwam of Sakalar, without whom all hopes of reaching the goal of his  wishes were vain. He had sufficient confidence in himself to venture  without a guide toward the plain of Mioure, where his Yakouta friend  dwelt. He started at early dawn, without warning of his departure any  one save Maria, and ventured courageously on the frozen plain which  reaches from Yakoutsk to the Polar Sea. The country is here composed  of marshes, vast downs, huge forests, and hills covered with snow in  the month of September, the time when he began his journey. He had  five horses, each tied to the tail of the one before him, while Ivan  himself was mounted on the first. He was compelled to ride slowly,  casting his eyes every now and then behind to see that all was right.  At night he stretched a bearskin under a bush, lit a huge fire, cooked  a savory mess, and piling clothes over himself, slept. At dawn he  rose, crammed his kettle full of clean snow, put it over the embers,  and made himself tea. With this warm beverage to rouse him, he again  arranged his little caravan, and proceeded on his way. Nothing more  painful than this journey can be conceived. There are scarcely any  marks to denote the road, while lakes, formed by recent inundations,  arrest the traveler every half hour, compelling him to take prodigious  rounds, equally annoying and perplexing.    On the morning of the third day Ivan felt a little puzzled about the  road. He knew the general direction from the distant mountains, and he  wished to avoid a vast morass. Before him was a frozen stream, and on  the other side a hillock. Leaving the others to feed as well as they  could, he mounted his best horse, and rode across. The ice bent under  him as he went, and he accordingly rode gently; but just as he reached  the middle, it cracked violently right across, and sank visibly under  him. Ivan looked hurriedly round him. The ice was everywhere split,  and the next minute his horse, plunging violently, fell through.  Instead, however, of falling into a stream of cold water, Ivan found  himself in a vast and chilly vault, with a small trickling stream in  the middle, and at once recollected a not unfrequent phenomenon. The  river had been frozen over when high with floods, but presently the  water sinking to its ordinary level, the upper crust of ice alone  remained. But Ivan had no desire to admire the gloomy, half-lit vault,  extending up and down out of sight; but standing on his horse's  back, clambered up as best he might upon the surface, leaving the  poor animal below. This done, he ran to the shore, and used the  well-remembered Yakouta device for extracting his steed: he broke a  hole in the ice near the bank, toward which the sagacious brute at  once hurried, and was drawn forth. Having thus fortunately escaped a  serious peril, he resumed his search on foot, and about midday pursued  his journey.    A few hours brought him to the curious plain of the Mioure, where he  expected to find the camp of his friend Sakalar. Leaving an almost  desert plain, he suddenly stood on the edge of a hollow, circular in  form and six miles across, fertile in the extreme, and dotted with  numerous well-stocked fish-ponds. The whole, as may plainly be seen,  was once a lake. Scattered over the soil were the yourtes of the  Yakoutas, while cattle and horses crowded together in vast flocks.  Ivan, who knew the place well, rode straight to a yourte or cabin  apart from the rest, where usually dwelt Sakalar. It was larger and  cleaner than most of them, thanks to the tuition of Ivan and the  subsequent care of a daughter, who, brought up by Ivan's mother while  the young man wandered, had acquired manners a little superior to  those of her tribe.    This was really needful, for the Yakoutas, a pastoral people of  Tartar origin, are singularly dirty, and even somewhat coarse and  unintellectual--like all savage nations, in fact, when judged by any  one but the poet or the poetic philosopher, who, on examination,  will find that ignorance, poverty, misery, and want of civilization,  produce similar results in the prairies of America and the wilds  of Siberia, in an Irish cabin, and in the wynds and closes of  our populous cities. But the chief defect of the Yakouta is dirt.  Otherwise he is rather a favorable specimen of a savage. Since his  assiduous connection with the Russians he has become even rich, having  flocks and herds, and at home plenty of koumise to drink and horse's  flesh to eat. He has great endurance, and can bear tremendous cold. He  travels in the snow, with his saddle for a pillow, his horse-cloth for  a bed, his cloak for a covering, and so sleeps. His power of fasting  is prodigious, and his eyesight is so keen that a Yakouta one day told  an eminent Russian traveler that he had seen a great blue"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13056"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 10 (#14)"],[1,"as  President-in-chief, and to whom he had not spoken till then. \"Sir,\"  said he, in a very loud and angry voice, \"if you belong to the Right,  then vote with the Right; if you belong to the Left, vote, in the----  name with the Left; but I require of my servants that they stand by  me, do you understand?\" Breathless silence, and P---- looked like a  duck in a thunder-storm. * * * It is right good that I did not take  the apartment on the Thiergarten; aside from the wet feet which my  angel would get in dirty and damp weather, the house has been broken  into seven times during the couple of years of its existence, a fact  of which sympathizing souls would surely have informed you; and, if on  some long winter evening I were not at home, you and the two girls and  baby would have shuddered mightily over it. The little old clock is  just clearing its throat to strike seven; I must to my work. Farewell,  dearest; and, above all things, come-mmmm quickly--in a hurry,  swiftly, instantly--to your dear little husbandkin. Most hearty  greetings to our parents.    Your most faithful v.B.      Erfurt, April 19, '50.    _My Beloved Nan_,--It is bad to live in such a small town, with three  hundred acquaintances. One is never sure of his life a single moment,  for calls. An hour ago I got rid of the last bores; then, during  supper, I walked up and down in my room, and annihilated almost the  whole fat sausage, which is very delicious, drank a stone mug of beer  from the Erfurt \"Felsenkeller,\" and now, while writing, I am eating  the second little box of Marchpane, which was, perhaps, intended for  Hans, who has not got any of the sausage even; in its place I will  leave him the little ham. During the last few days we have been  valiantly quarrelling in Parliament; but neither at the beginning nor  later could I obtain the floor for my principal speech; but I relieved  myself of some gall in minor skirmishes. * * * I am sick and tired of  life here; attending the sitting early in the morning, thence directly  to a screaming and chattering _table d'hote,_ then for coffee to the  Steiger, a most charming little mountain, a mile from the city, where  one can walk about through the pleasantest hours of the day with a  pretty view of Erfurt and the Thuringian woods; under magnificent  oaks, among the little light-green leaves of prickles and horn-beam;  from there to the abominable party caucus, which has never yet made me  any the wiser, so that one does not get home all day. If I do not  attend the caucus meetings, they all rail at me, for each one grudges  the others any escape from the tedium. * * * Good-by, my heart. May  God's hand be over you, and the children, and protect you from  sickness and worry, but particularly you, the apple of my eye, whom  Roeder envies me daily in the promenade, when the sunset makes him  sentimental, and he wishes he had such a \"good, dear, devout wife.\"  For the rest, my allowance suffices for my needs here, and I shall  still bring treasures home. Good-night, my darling. Many thanks for  your faithful letter, and write me again at once; I am always anxious  for news. Hans has just come in, and sends you sleepy greetings, after  sitting on the lounge for hardly ten seconds. Once more, good-night,  my Nan.    Your most faithful v.B.      Erfurt, April 23, '50.    _My Darling_,-- * * * We shall probably be released a week from today,  and then we have before us a quiet Schoenhausen summer, as the cry of  war is also dying. It is really going to be summer again, and on a  very long walk, from which I am returning home dead tired, I took much  pleasure in the small green leaves of the hazel and white beech, and  heard the cuckoo, who told me that we shall live together for eleven  years more; let us hope longer still. My hunt was extraordinary;  charming wild pine-woods on the ride out, sky-high, as in the  Erzgebirge; then, on the other side, steep valleys, like the Selke,  only the hills were much higher, with beeches and oaks. The night  before starting I had slept but four hours; then went to bed at nine  o'clock in Schleusingen on the south side of the Thuringian wood;  arose at midnight; that evening I had eaten freely of the trout and  had drunk weak beer with them; at one o'clock we rode to a forge in  the mountains, where ghostlike people poked the fire; then we climbed,  without stopping, until three o 'clock, in pouring rain, I wearing a  heavy overcoat; so steep that I had to help myself with my hands; so  dark in the fir thickets that I could touch the huntsman ahead of me  with my hand, but could not see him. Then, too, we were told there is  a precipice on the right, and the torrent sent up its roar from the  purple depths below; or that there is a pool on the left, and the path  was slippery. I had to halt three times; repeatedly I almost fainted  from weakness, lay down on the dripping heath, and let the rain pour  on me. But I was firmly resolved to see the grouse; and I did see  several, but could not shoot them, for reasons which one must be a  huntsman to understand. My companion shot one, and, if I had been  well, I might have shot two; I was too exhausted. After three it  cleared and became wonderfully fine, the horn-owl gave place to the  thrush, and at sunrise the bird-chorus became deafening; the  wood-pigeons singing bass, withal. At five I was down again, and, as  it began to pour once more, I abandoned further attempts, returned  hither, ate very heartily, after a twenty-four hours' fast, and drank  two glasses of champagne, then slept for fourteen hours, until  yesterday at one o'clock, noon, and now I am feeling much better than  before the excursion, and am glad of the good constitution which God  has given me, to get through it all. * * * I send you lots of love, my  heart, and will piously celebrate fast-day tomorrow at the Wermel  church. God preserve you. Love to mother and Melissa. Excuse my haste.  I had really left myself an hour of leisure, but that little old Mass  has his fourteenth child, just born. The only son of our poor  Eglofstein, of Arklitten, twenty-three-year-old lieutenant of  cuirassiers, has shot himself in hypochondria; I pity the father  extremely, a devout, honorable man.    Your most faithful    v.B.      Schoenhausen, Sunday Evening.    (Postmarked Jerichow, September 30, '50.)    _My Beloved Nan_,-- * * * I regained possession of my things in Berlin  at some cost, after twenty-four hours had elapsed; when I left, the  unfortunate Jew had not yet claimed his. Partly on my account and  partly on Hans', we had to stay in Berlin two days, but this time the  bill was more reasonable. * * * May the devil take politics! Here I  found everything as we left it, only the leaves show the rosiness of  autumn; flowers are almost more plentiful than in summer; Kahle has a  particular fondness for them, and on the terrace fabulous pumpkins are  suspended by their vines from the trees. The pretty plums are gone;  only a few blue ones still remain; of the vine, only the common green  variety is ripe; next week I shall send you some grapes. I have  devoured so many figs today that I was obliged to drink rum, but they  were the last. I am sorry you cannot see the Indian corn; it stands  closely packed, three feet higher than I can reach with my hand; the  colts' pasture looks from a distance like a fifteen-year-old pine  preserve. I am sitting here at your desk, a crackling fire behind me,  and Odin, rolled into a knot, by my side. * * * Mamsell received me in  pink, with a black dancing-jacket; the children in the village  ridicule her swaggering about her noble and rich relations. She has  cooked well again today, but, as to the feeding of the cattle, Bellin  laments bitterly that she understands nothing about it, and pays no  attention to it, and she is also said to be uncleanly; the Bellin  woman does not eat a mouthful prepared by her. Her father is a common  cottager and laborer; I can easily understand that she is out of place  there, with her grand airs and pink dresses. Up to this time the  garden, outside of Kahle's keep, has cost one hundred and three  rix-dollars this year, and between now and Christmas forty to fifty  will probably be added for digging and harvesting, besides the fuel.  The contents of the greenhouse I shall try to have care of in the  neighborhood; that is really the most difficult point, and still one  cannot continue keeping the place for the sake of the few oranges. I  am giving out that you will spend the winter in Berlin, that in the  summer-time we intend going to a watering-place again, and that,  therefore, we are giving up housekeeping for a year. * * * Hearty love  to our parents. I shall celebrate father's birthday with you, like a  Conservative, in the old style. May the merciful God, for His Son's  sake, preserve you and the children. Farewell, my dear Nan.    Your v.B.    Since leaving Reinfeld I no longer have heartburn; perhaps it is in my  heart, and my heart has remained with Nan.      Schoenhausen, October 1, '50.    _My Angel_,--I am so anxious that I can hardly endure being here; I  have the most decided inclination to inform the government at once of  my resignation, let the dike go, and proceed to Reinfeld. I expected  to have a letter from you today, but nothing except stupid police  matters. Do write very, very often, even if it takes one hundred  rix-dollars postage. I am always afraid that you are sick, and today I  am in such a mood that I should like to foot it to Pomerania. I long  for the children, for mammy and dad, and, most of all, for you, my  darling, so that I have no peace at all. Without you here, what is  Schoenhausen to me? The dreary bedroom, the empty cradles with the  little beds in them, all the absolute silence, like an autumn fog,  interrupted only by the ticking of the clock and the periodic falling  of the chestnuts--it is as though you all were dead. I always"]]]
