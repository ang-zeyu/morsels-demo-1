Take, for example, the power over commerce. According to the  Constitution, the Federal Government had plenary power over foreign  commerce and commerce _between_ the States, but the power over commerce  _within_ a State was reserved to State governments. This presupposed the  power of Government to divide commerce into two water-tight  compartments, or, at least, to regard the two spheres of power as  parallel lines that would never meet; whereas with the coming of the  railroad, steamship and the telegraph commerce has become so unified  that the parallel lines have become lines of interlacing zigzags. To  adapt the commerce clause of the Constitution to these changed  conditions has required, in the highest degree, the constructive genius  of the Supreme Court of the United States, and, in a series of very  remarkable decisions, which are contained in 256 volumes of the official  reports, that great tribunal has tried to draw a line between  inter-State and domestic commerce as nearly to the original plans of the  framers as it was possible; but obviously there has been so much  adaptation to make this possible that if Washington, Franklin, Madison  and Hamilton could revisit the nation they created they would not  recognize their own handiwork.    For the same reason, the dual system of government has been profoundly  modified by the great elemental forces of our mechanical age, so that  the scales, which try to hold in nice equipoise the Federal Government  on the one hand and the States on the other, have been greatly  disturbed. Originally, the States were the powerful political entities,  and the central government a mere agent for certain specific purposes;  but, in the development of the Constitution, the nation has naturally  become of overshadowing importance, while the States have relatively  steadily diminished in power and prestige.    These inevitable tendencies in American politics are called  \"centralization,\" and while for nearly a century a great political party  bitterly contested its steady progress, due to the centripetal  influences above indicated, yet the contest was long since abandoned as  a hopeless one, and the struggle to-day is rather to keep, so far as  possible, the inevitable tendency measurably in check.    Nevertheless, it would be erroneous to suggest that the dual system of  government is a failure. It still endures in providing a large measure  of authority to the States in their purely domestic concerns, and, in a  country that extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the  Lakes to the Gulf, whose northern border is not very far from the Arctic  Circle, and whose southern border is not many degrees from the Equator,  there are such differences in the habits, conventions, and ideals of the  people that without this dual form of government the Constitution would  long since have broken down. It is not too much to say that the success  with which the framers of the Constitution reconciled national supremacy  and efficiency with local self-government is one of the great  achievements in the history of mankind.        3.      _The third principle was the guaranty of individual liberty through  constitutional limitations._    This marked another great contribution of America to the science of  government. In all previous government building, the State was regarded  as a sovereign, which could grant to individuals or classes, out of its  plenary power, certain privileges or exemptions, which were called  \"liberties.\" Thus the liberties which the barons wrung from King John at  Runnymede were virtually exemptions from the power of government. Our  fathers did not believe in the sovereignty of the State in the sense of  absolute power, nor did they believe in the sovereignty of the people in  that sense. The word \"sovereignty\" will not be found in the Constitution  or the Declaration of Independence. They believed that each individual,  as a responsible moral being, had certain \"inalienable rights\" which  neither the State nor the people could rightfully take from him.    This conception of individualism, enforced in courts of law against  executives and legislatures, was wholly new and is the distinguishing  characteristic of American constitutionalism. As to such reserved  rights, guaranteed by Constitutional limitations, and largely by the  first ten amendments to the Constitution, a man, by virtue of his  inherent and God-given dignity as a human soul, has rights, such as  freedom of the Press, liberty of speech, property rights, and religious  freedom, which even one hundred millions of people cannot rightfully  take from him, without amending the Constitution. The framers did not  believe that the oil of anointing that was supposed to sanctify the  monarch and give him infallibility had fallen upon the \"multitudinous  tongue\" of the people to give it either infallibility or omnipotence.  They believed in individualism. They were animated by a sleepless  jealousy of governmental power. They believed that the greater such  power, the greater the danger of its abuse. They felt that the  individual could generally best work out his own salvation, and that his  constant prayer to Government was that of Diogenes to Alexander: \"Keep  out of my sunlight.\" The worth and dignity of the human soul, the free  competition of man and man, the nobility of labour, the right to work,  free from the tyranny of state or class, this was their gospel.  Socialism was to them abhorrent.    This theory of government gave a new dignity to manhood. It said to the  State: \"There is a limit to your power. Thus far and no further, and  here shall thy proud waves be stayed.\"        4.      _Closely allied to this doctrine of limited governmental powers, even by  a majority, is the fourth principle of an independent judiciary_.    It is the balance wheel of the Constitution, and to function it must be  beyond the possibility of attack and destruction. My country was founded  upon the rock of property rights and the sanctity of contracts. Both the  nation and the several States are forbidden to impair the obligation of  contracts, or take away life, liberty, or property \"without due process  of law.\" The guarantee is as old as Magna Charta; for \"due process of  law\" is but a paraphrase of \"the law of the land,\" without which no  freeman could be deprived of his liberties or possessions.    \"Due process of law\" means that there are certain fundamental principles  of liberty, not defined or even enumerated in the Constitution, but  having their sanction in the free and enlightened conscience of just  men, and that no man can be deprived of life, liberty, or property,  except in conformity with these fundamental decencies of liberty. To  protect these even against the will of a majority, however large, the  judiciary was given unprecedented powers. It threw about the individual  the solemn circle of the law. It made the judiciary the final conscience  of the nation. Your nation cherishes the same primal verities of  liberty, but with you, the people in Parliament, is the final judge. We,  however, are not content that a majority of the Legislature shall  override inviolable individual rights, about which the judiciary is  empowered to throw the solemn circle of the law.    This august power has won the admiration of the world, and by many is  regarded as a novel contribution to the science of government. The idea,  however, was not wholly novel. As previously shown, four Chief Justices  of England had declared that an Act of Parliament, if against common  right and reason, could be treated as null and void; while in France the  power of the judiciary to refuse efficacy to a law, unless sanctioned by  the judiciary, had been the cause of a long struggle for at least three  centuries between the French monarch and the courts of France. However,  in England the doctrine of the common law yielded to the later doctrine  of the omnipotence of Parliament, while in France the revisory power of  the judiciary was terminated by the French Revolution.    The United States, however, embodied it in its form of government and  thus made the judiciary, and especially the Supreme Court, the balance  wheel of the Constitution. Without such power the Constitution could  never have lasted, for neither executive officers nor legislatures are  good judges of the extent of their own powers.    Nothing more strikingly shows the spirit of unity which the Constitution  brought into being than the unbroken success with which the Supreme  Court has discharged this difficult and most delicate duty. The  President is the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and the Navy and can  call them to his aid. The legislature has almost unlimited power through  its control of the public purse. The States have their power reinforced  by armed forces, and some of them are as great in population and  resources as many of the nations of Europe. The Supreme Court, however,  has only one officer to execute its decrees, called the United States  Marshal; and yet, without sword or purse, and with only a high sheriff  to enforce its mandates, when the Supreme Court says to a President or  to a Congress or to the authorities of a great--and, in some respects,  sovereign--State that they must do this or must refrain from doing that,  the mandate is at once obeyed. Here, indeed, is the American ideal of \"a  government of laws and not of men\" most strikingly realized; and if the  American Constitution, as formulated and developed, had done nothing  else than to establish in this manner the supremacy of law, even as  against the overwhelming sentiment of the people, it would have  justified the well-known encomium of Mr."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10066"],[0,"Gunman's Reckoning (#14)"],[1,"the breast of his coat. Donnegan, who missed nothing, saw and  understood.    Interested? He was fascinated by this man because he recognized the  kinship which existed between them. They might almost have been blood  brothers, except for differences in the face. He knew, for instance,  just what each glance of the man in the linen coat meant, and how he was  weighing his antagonists. As for the others, they were cool players  themselves, but here they had met their master. It was the difference  between the amateur and the professional. They played good chancey  poker, but the man in the linen coat did more--he stacked the cards!    For the first moment Donnegan was not sure; it was not until there was a  slight faltering in the deal--an infinitely small hesitation which only  a practiced eye like that of Donnegan's could have noticed--that he was  sure. The winner was crooked. Yet the hand was interesting for all that.  He had done the master trick, not only giving himself the winning hand  but also giving each of the others a fine set of cards.    And the betting was wild on that historic pot! To begin with the  smallest hand was three of a kind; and after the draw the weakest was a  straight. And they bet furiously. The stranger had piqued them with his  consistent victories. Now they were out for blood. Chips having been  exhausted, solid gold was piled up on the table--a small fortune!    The man in the linen coat, in the middle of the hand, called for drinks.  They drank. They went on with the betting. And then at last came the  call.    Donnegan could have clapped his hands to applaud the smooth rascal. It  was not an affair of breaking the others who sat in. They were all  prosperous mine owners, and probably they had been carefully selected  according to the size of purse, in preparation for the sacrifice. But  the stakes were swept into the arms and then the canvas bag of the  winner. If it was not enough to ruin the miners it was at least enough  to clean them out of ready cash and discontinue the game on that basis.  They rose; they went to the bar for a drink; but while the winner led  the way, two of the losers dropped back a trifle and fell into earnest  conversation, frowning. Donnegan knew perfectly what the trouble was.  They had noticed that slight faltering in the deal; they were putting  their mental notes on the game together.    But the winner, apparently unconscious of suspicion, lined up his  victims at the bar. The first drink went hastily down; the second was on  the way--it was standing on the bar. And here he excused himself; he  broke off in the very middle of a story, and telling them that he would  be back any moment, stepped into a crowd of newcomers.    The moment he disappeared, Donnegan saw the other four put their heads  close together, and saw a sudden darkening of faces; but as for the  genial winner, he had no sooner passed to the other side of the crowd  and out of view, than he turned directly toward the door. His careless  saunter was exchanged for a brisk walk; and Donnegan, without making  himself conspicuous, was hard pressed to follow that pace.    At the door he found that the gambler, with his canvas sack under his  arm, had turned to the right toward the line of saddle horses which  stood in the shadow; and no sooner did he reach the gloom at the side of  the building than he broke into a soft, swift run. He darted down the  line of horses until he came to one which was already mounted. This  Donnegan saw as he followed somewhat more leisurely and closer to the  horses to avoid observance. He made out that the man already on  horseback was a big Negro and that he had turned his own mount and a  neighboring horse out from the rest of the horses, so that they were  both pointing down the street of The Corner. Donnegan saw the Negro  throw the lines of his lead horse into the air. In exchange he caught  the sack which the runner tossed to him, and then the gambler leaped  into his saddle.    It was a simple but effective plan. Suppose he were caught in the midst  of a cheat; his play would be to break away to the outside of the  building, shooting out the lights, if possible--trusting to the  confusion to help him--and there he would find his horse held ready for  him at a time when a second might be priceless. On this occasion no  doubt the clever rascal had sensed the suspicion of the others.    At any rate, he lost no time. He waited neither to find his stirrups nor  grip the reins firmly, but the same athletic leap which carried him into  the saddle set the horse in motion, and from a standing start the animal  broke into a headlong gallop. He received, however, an additional burden  at once.    For Donnegan, from the second time he saw the man of the linen coat, had  been revolving a daring plan, and during the poker game the plan had  slowly matured. The moment he made sure that the gambler was heading for  a horse, he increased his own speed. Ordinarily he would have been  noted, but now, no doubt, the gambler feared no pursuit except one  accompanied by a hue and cry. He did not hear the shadow-footed Donnegan  racing over the soft ground behind him; but when he had gained the  saddle, Donnegan was close behind with the impetus of his run to aid  him. It was comparatively simple, therefore, to spring high in the air,  and he struck fairly and squarely behind the saddle of the man in the  linen coat. When he landed his revolver was in his hand and the muzzle  jabbed into the back of the gambler.    The other made one frantic effort to twist around, then recognized the  pressure of the revolver and was still. The horses, checking their  gallops in unison, were softly dog-trotting down the street.    \"Call off your man!\" warned Donnegan, for the big Negro had reined back;  the gun already gleamed in his hand.    A gesture from the gambler sent the gun into obscurity, yet still the  fellow continued to fall back.    \"Tell him to ride ahead.\"    \"Keep in front, George.\"    \"And not too far.\"    \"Very well. And now?\"    \"We'll talk later. Go straight on, George, to the clump of trees beyond  the end of the street. And ride straight. No dodging!\"    \"It was a good hand you played,\" continued Donnegan; taking note that of  the many people who were now passing them none paid the slightest  attention to two men riding on one horse and chatting together as they  rode. \"It was a good hand, but a bad deal. Your thumb slipped on the  card, eh?\"    \"You saw, eh?\" muttered the other.    \"And two of the others saw it. But they weren't sure till afterward.\"    \"I know. The blockheads! But I spoiled their game for them. Are you one  of us, pal?\"    But Donnegan smiled to himself. For once at least the appeal of gambler  to gambler should fail.    \"Keep straight on,\" he said. \"We'll talk later on.\"          15      Before Donnegan gave the signal to halt in a clear space where the  starlight was least indistinct, they reached the center of the trees.    \"Now, George,\" he said, \"drop your gun to the ground.\"    There was a flash and faint thud.    \"Now the other gun.\"    \"They ain't any more, sir.\"    \"Your other gun,\" repeated Donnegan.    A little pause. \"Do what he tells you, George,\" said the gambler at  length, and a second weapon fell.    \"Now keep on your horse and keep a little off to the side,\" went on  Donnegan, \"and remember that if you try to give me the jump I might miss  you in this light, but I'd be sure to hit your horse. So don't take  chances, George. Now, sir, just hold your hands over your head and then  dismount.\"    He had already gone through the gambler and taken his weapons; he was  now obeyed. The man of the linen coat tossed up his arms, flung his  right leg over the horn of the saddle, and slipped to the ground.    Donnegan joined his captive. \"I warn you first,\" he said gently, \"that  I am quite expert with a revolver, and that it will be highly dangerous  to attempt to trick me. Lower your arms if you wish, but please be  careful of what you do with your hands. There are such things as knife  throwing, I know, but it takes a fast wrist to flip a knife faster than  a bullet. We understand each other?\"    \"Perfectly,\" agreed the other. \"By the way, my name is Godwin. And  suppose we become frank. You are in temporary distress. It was  impossible for you to make a loan at the moment and you are driven to  this forced--touch. Now, if half--\"    \"Hush,\" said Donnegan. \"You are too generous. But the present question  is not one of money. I have long since passed over that. The money is  now mine. Steady!\" This to George, who lurched in the saddle; but Godwin  was calm as stone. \"It is not the question of the money that troubles  me, but the question of the men. I could easily handle one of you. But I  fear to allow both of you to go free. You would return on my trail;  there are such things as waylayings by night, eh? And so, Mr. Godwin, I  think my best way out is to shoot you through the head. When your body  is found it will be taken for granted that the servant killed the master  for the sake of the money which he won by crooked card play. I think  that's simple. Put your hands up, George, or, by heck, I'll let the  starlight shine through you!\"    The huge arms of George were raised above his head; Godwin, in the  meantime, had not spoken.    \"I almost think you mean it,\" he said after a short pause.    \"Good,\" said Donnegan. \"I do not wish to kill you unprepared.\"    There was a strangled sound deep in the throat of Godwin; then he was  able to speak again, but now his voice was made into a horrible jumble  by fear.    \"Pal,\" he said, \"you're dead wrong. George here--he's a devil. If you  let him live he'll kill you--as sure as you're standing here. You don't  know him. He's George Green. He's got a record as long as my arm and as  bad as the devil's name. He--he's the man to get rid of. Me? Why, man,  you and I could team it together. But"]]]
