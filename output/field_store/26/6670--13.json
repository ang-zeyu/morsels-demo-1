An  instance occurred during my residence in Ceylon, in which two natives,  whose mimicry had mutually deceived them, crept so close together in the  jungle that one shot the other, supposing the cry to proceed from the  game.]    [Footnote 2: Axis maculata, _H. Smith_.]    [Footnote 3: Stylocerus muntjac, _Horss_.]    VII. PACHYDERMATA.--_The Elephant_.--The elephant, and the wild boar,  the Singhalese \"waloora,\"[1] are the only representatives of the  _pachydermatous_ order. The latter, which differs somewhat from the wild  boar of India, is found in droves in all parts of the island where  vegetation and water are abundant.    [Footnote 1: Mr. BLYTH of Calcutta has distinguished, from the hog,  common in India, a specimen sent to him from Ceylon, the skull of which  approaches in form, that of a species from Borneo, the _susbarbatus_ of  S. Mueller.]    The elephant, the lord paramount of the Ceylon forests, is to be met  with in every district, on the confines of the woods, in the depths of  which he finds concealment and shade during the hours when the sun is  high, and from which he emerges only at twilight to wend his way towards  the rivers and tanks, where he luxuriates till dawn, when he again seeks  the retirement of the deep forests. This noble animal fills so dignified  a place both in the zoology and oeconomy of Ceylon, and his habits in a  state of nature have been so much misunderstood, that I shall devote a  separate section to his defence from misrepresentation, and to an  exposition of what, from observation and experience, I believe to be his  genuine character when free in his native domains. But this seems the  proper place to allude to a recent discovery in connexion with the  elephant, which strikingly confirms a conjecture which I ventured to  make elsewhere[1], relative to the isolation of Ceylon and its  distinctness, in many remarkable particulars, from the great continent  of India. Every writer who previously treated of the island, including  the accomplished Dr. Davy and the erudite Lassen, was contented, by a  glance at its outline and a reference to its position on the map, to  assume that Ceylon was a fragment, which in a very remote age had been  torn from the adjacent mainland, by some convulsion of nature. Hence it  was taken for granted that the vegetation which covers and the races of  animals which inhabit it, must be identical with those of Hindustan; to  which Ceylon was alleged to bear the same relation as Sicily presents to  the peninsula of Italy. MALTE BRUN[2] and the geographers generally,  declared the larger animals of either to be common to both. I was led to  question the soundness of this dictum;--and from a closer examination of  its geological conformation and of its botanical and zoological  characteristics I came to the conclusion that not only is there an  absence of sameness between the formations of the two localities; but  that plants and animals, mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects exist in  Ceylon, which are not to be found in the flora and fauna of the Dekkan;  but which present a striking affinity, and occasionally an actual  identity, with those of the Malayan countries and some of the islands of  the Eastern Archipelago. Startling as this conclusion appeared to be, it  was strangely in unison with the legends of the Singhalese themselves,  that at an infinitely remote period Ceylon formed an integral portion of  a vast continent, known in the mythical epics of the Brahmans by the  designation of \"_Lanka_;\" so immense that its southern extremity fell  below the equator, whilst in breadth it was prolonged till its western  and eastern boundaries touch at once upon the shores of Africa and  China.    [Footnote 1: _Ceylon, &c._, by Sir J. EMERSON TENNENT, vol. i. pp. 7,  13, 85, 160, 183, n., 205, 270, &c.]    [Footnote 2: MALTE BRUN, _Geogr. Univ._, l. xlix.]    Dim as is this ancient tradition, it is in consistency with the  conclusions of modern geology, that at the commencement of the tertiary  period northern Asia and a considerable part of India were in all  probability covered by the sea but that south of India land extended  eastward and westward connecting Malacca with Arabia. PROFESSOR ANSTED  has propounded this view. His opinion is, that the Himalayas then  existed only as a chain of islands, and did not till a much later age  become elevated into mountain ranges,--a change which took place during  the same revolution that raised the great plains of Siberia and Tartary  and many parts of north-western Europe. At the same time the great  continent whose position between the tropics has been alluded to, and  whose previous existence is still indicated by the Coral islands, the  Laccadives, the Maldives, and the Chagos group, underwent simultaneous  depression by a counteracting movement.[1]    [Footnote 1: _The Ancient World_, by D.T. ANSTED, M.A., &c., pp.  322-324.]    But divested of oriental mystery and geologic conjecture, and brought to  the test of \"geographical distribution,\" this once prodigious continent  would appear to have connected the distant Islands of Ceylon and Sumatra  and possibly to have united both to the Malay peninsula, from which the  latter is now severed by the Straits of Malacca. The proofs of physical  affinity between these scattered localities are exceedingly curious.    A striking dissimilarity presents itself between some of the Mammalia of  Ceylon and those of the continent of India. In its general outline and  feature, this branch of the island fauna, no doubt, exhibits a general  resemblance to that of the mainland, although many of the larger animals  of the latter are unknown in Ceylon: but, on the other hand, some  species discovered there are peculiar to the island. A deer[1] as large  as the Axis, but differing from it in the number and arrangement of its  spots, has been described by Dr. Kelaart, to whose vigilance the natural  history of Ceylon is indebted, amongst others, for the identification of  two new species of monkeys[2], a number of curious shrews[3], and an  orange-coloured ichneumon[4], before unknown. There are also two  squirrels[5] that have not as yet been discovered elsewhere, (one of  them belonging to those equipped with a parachute[6],) as well as some  local varieties of the palm squirrel (Sciurus penicillatus, _Leach_).[7]    [Footnote 1: Cervus orizus, KELAART, _Prod. F. Zeyl.,_ p. 83.]    [Footnote 2: Presbytes ursinus, _Blyth_, and P. Thersites, _Elliot_.]    [Footnote 3: Sorex montanus, S. ferrugineus, and Feroculus macropus.]    [Footnote 4: Herpestes fulvescens, KELAART, _Prod. Faun. Zeylan_.. App.  p. 42.]    [Footnote 5: Sciurus Tennentii, _Layard_.]    [Footnote 6: Sciuropterus Layardi, _Kelaart_.]    [Footnote 7: There is a rat found only in the Cinnamon Gardens at  Colombo, Mus Ceylonus, _Kelaart_; and a mouse which Dr. Kelaart  discovered at Trincomalie, M. fulvidiventris, _Blyth_, both peculiar to  Ceylon. Dr. TEMPLETON has noticed a little shrew (Corsira purpurascens,  _Mag. Nat. Hist_. 1855, p. 238) at Neuera-ellia, not as yet observed  elsewhere.]    But the Ceylon Mammalia, besides wanting a number of minor animals found  in the Indian peninsula, cannot boast such a ruminant as the majestic  Gaur[1], which inhabits the great forests from Cape Comorin to the  Himalaya; and, providentially, the island is equally free of the  formidable tiger and the ferocious wolf of Hindustan. The Hyena and  Cheetah[2], common in Southern India, are unknown in Ceylon; and, though  abundant in deer, the island possesses no example of the Antelope or the  Gazelle.    [Footnote 1: Bos cavifrons, _Hodgs_.; B. frontalis, _Lamb_.]    [Footnote 2: Felis jubata, _Schreb_.]    Amongst the Birds of Ceylon, the same abnormity is apparent. About  thirty-eight species will be presently particularised[1], which,  although some of them may hereafter be discovered to have a wider  geographical range, are at present believed to be unknown in continental  India. I might further extend this enumeration, by including the Cheela  eagle of Ceylon, which, although I have placed it in my list as  identical with the _Hematornis cheela_ of the Dekkan, is, I have since  been assured, a different bird, and is most probably the _Falco bido_ of  Horsfield, known to us by specimens obtained from Java and Sumatra.    [Footnote 1: See Chapter on the Birds of Ceylon.]    As to the Fishes of Ceylon, they are of course less distinct; and  besides they have hitherto been very imperfectly compared. But the  Insects afford a remarkable confirmation of the view I have ventured to  propound; so much so that Mr. Walker, by whom the elaborate lists  appended to this work have been prepared, asserts that some of the  families have a less affinity to the entomology of India than to that of  Australia.[1]    [Footnote 1: See Chapter on the Insects of Ceylon.]    But more conclusive than all, is the discovery to which I have alluded,  in relation to the elephant of Ceylon. Down to a very recent period it  was universally believed that only two species of the elephant are now  in existence, the African and the Asiatic; distinguished by certain  peculiarities in the shape of the cranium, the size of the ears, the  ridges of the teeth, the number of vertebrae, and, according to Cuvier,  in the number of nails on the hind feet. The elephant of Ceylon was  believed to be identical with the elephant of India. But some few years  back, TEMMINCK, in his survey of the Dutch possessions in the Indian  Archipelago[1], announced the fact that the elephant which abounds in  Sumatra (although unknown in the adjacent island of Java), and which had  theretofore been regarded as the same species with the Indian one, has  been recently found to possess peculiarities, in which it differs as  much from the elephant of India, as the latter from its African  congener.

The east end of the present #Library# has in it five windows. Two  of the upper ones are built up, the central and higher one only being  glazed. In detail they are all of the same date as the walls they are  in. None has any tracery, and by this they show that this piece of  work was done at the same time as the chapel--now a vestry--on the  east side of the south end of the transept. The gable is a low slope  like the present roof, but the slope of the old gable and roof may be  seen upon the east wall of the transept. There is one buttress only on  the east side of the library. The north side is divided into two parts  in its length by a buttress. The parapet has a corbel course similar  to that on the two eastern bays of the presbytery aisle. The two small  pointed windows below it are built up, as now the apartment they once  lighted is a lumber-room, where the remnants of the old reredos are  stored. The larger windows below are of the same date, nearly, as  those two fifteenth-century ones in the north wall of the presbytery  aisle. The east one has three and the west four lights, with cusped  tracery in the heads.    The east wall of the north arm of the #Transept# has a buttress, as  is the case with the south arm. But early thirteenth-century pointed  windows take the place of the round-headed ones. There are, however,  three string-courses on this wall of the north arm which do not appear  on the south. One is the old twelfth-century string which evidently  once ran along above the old round-headed windows. The next is a  continuation of the abaci of the capitals. The other passes under the  sills of the windows. A comparison of this wall with that  corresponding to it in the south of the transept shows that for some  reason the windows here were totally changed and the others only  partially. This may suggest that at the time of the fire this part was  more damaged than the other. The parapet on this wall is unlike that  at the top of the presbytery and choir walls. It has no corbelling and  no arched and cusped work; it is merely a plain piece of walling,  slightly overhung with a weathered coping at the top and a moulded  string beneath.    The general features in the design of the north end of this transept  are similar to those of the south. The gable sets back from the face  of the lower wall as before, and in it is a rose window, also based on  the hexagon principle in design. It is later in character than either  of the other large rose windows in the south of the transept and the  east of the presbytery. Like the others, it has been much repaired.  The two irregular octagon turrets on each angle are of the same date  as those on the south, and, like them, have weathered and battlemented  parapets to the top of their side walls. The parapet of the north wall  between them is of the same design, detail, and date as that on the  north and south walls of the clerestory to the nave.    On the north-east angle are two buttresses; and on the north-west  angle there is a group of buttresses of a later type. On the west  there remains the old twelfth-century flat buttress, like those on the  south-west angle of the transept. Westward of this, and standing clear  of the wall, is a fine fourteenth-century flying-buttress. Projecting  northwards, but attached to the north-west angle, is a vertical  buttress of the same date as the flying one close to it.    On the west side, this part of the transept almost repeats what is to  be observed on the east; but the parapet here is the same as that on  the north end, and near the ground is one of the twelfth-century  windows. The arch-mould of its rounded head is the same in detail as  those in the priest-vicars' vestry and in the chamber above the  present library. It seems to be an example of that later work of the  twelfth century of which other specimens no doubt remained in the  walls of the lady-chapel before Bishop Gilbert transformed it into its  present state. Close to this window, and rising up just above the sill  of the clerestory windows, is a narrow, flat buttress, which is  probably of the same date as the window. Its upper half has an  attached shaft on each angle, with moulded bases and carved capitals  of the same period; but the weathering on its top appears to have been  changed in the thirteenth century.    Close by is the only part now remaining of the twelfth-century outer  wall of the nave aisle. The original corbel course of the parapet  remains, but not the upper part of the parapet. And it may be seen  here that the small windows that lighted the triforium gallery had  round arched heads in two orders, with a string-course at their sill.  Below this string is a thirteenth-century pointed window, with a  billet-moulded label cut in a twelfth-century manner of design.    [Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL FROM THE NORTH-EAST. _Photochrom Co.,  Ltd., photo_.]    The north side of the nave retains the seven twelfth-century  clerestory windows, the one next to the transept having been rebuilt  after the fall of the central tower and spire in 1861. There are no  remains of later insertions, as on the south side. The parapet is  later in design than those to the choir and lady-chapel; but it is of  the same date as that on the south wall of the nave. In the five  eastern bays it is of two tiers. The upper projects beyond the lower,  and so widens the span between the north and south clerestory walls.  It has been suggested that this was done in order to straighten the  north wall, which in the twelfth century had been built so that it  bent inwards towards the south.    The weathered and channelled backs of five of the buttresses are the  same date as those south of the nave; but the easternmost one has a  flat raking back like those to the north and south of the choir and  presbytery. The four western buttresses had pinnacles with  spirelets--now destroyed. The western one was square, the other three  octagonal. All these are earlier in date than the fifth one from the  west, this last one being probably the same in date, as it is in  detail, as those on the south side. The sixth one finishes plainly  with a square top. It may once have had a pinnacle, but none now  remains.    The parapet to the aisle chapels in the four western bays is plain,  with a weathered coping and string-course in which is some carved work  of late fourteenth-century date. The gables between the buttresses are  gone, as is the case on the south side; but traces of their old  copings remain. The four large three-light windows are the same in  design and detail, and were no doubt executed when the chapels  themselves were built. They have traceried heads with early types of  cusping of about the same date as, or a little later than, the rose  window in the east gable; but they are certainly thirty or forty years  earlier than those of the lady-chapel. The north window of the chapel  in the fifth bay is a modern insertion of the same character as in the  south aisle chapels of the nave. It probably, like them, contained a  fifteenth-century window, which was removed to satisfy the taste which  thought the present substitute the better thing. The detail of the two  orders of its outer arch is earlier than that of the windows west of  it. Above the point of this window is a small circular one, with a  cusped treatment of perhaps the same date as the ones in the east end  of the chapels at the end of the aisles of the presbytery.    The #North Porch# has a pointed outer arch in two orders. The  abaci to the capitals are square; but now there are no shafts or bases  in the jambs. The sub-arches appear to be about the same date as the  transept vaulting, as they have the dogtooth ornament in their  mouldings. On the west face of the buttress, close by, is a double  niche in very bad repair; but as a specimen of work it is well worth  studying. The parvise chamber above this porch is not lighted except  by the small cuttings in the form of a cross which pierce the wall.    The new north-west tower, or its north front, has imitations of  twelfth-century work throughout, except in the case of the coupled  openings in the top stage, which are like the thirteenth-century work  at the same level in the south-west tower. The lower part of the  north-east buttress incorporates the remains of the original  twelfth-century flat buttressing.    The #Central Tower# and #Spire#, although they were rebuilt  again after the disaster in 1861, are as nearly as possible an exact  reproduction of the originals.    The tower rises out of the substructure where the roofs of the nave  and transept intersect. It is not square in plan, but has an axis from  east to west, longer than that from north to south. Below the  string-course, under the weathered sills of the arcaded openings in  the belfry stage, are, on the north, south, and west, small wall  arcades. At each angle there is a turret. Three of these are  octagonal, but that at the south-west is circular till it reaches the  string course below the parapet; and excepting those on the north-west  and south-west they are used as staircases. Each of the four sides is  pierced by two groups of coupled openings under superior arches, the  several moulded members of which rise in four receding orders from the  square abaci of the capitals of the angle shafts. The space between  the pointed heads of the sub-arches on the east and west faces is  pierced by quatrefoils; those on the west are different in design from  those on the east.    The parapet of the tower has features in its design which indicate  that the original one W been added to the earlier tower during the  fifteenth century. The octagonal terminations to the four turrets were  of the same character and date as the parapet.    [Illustration: _Photochrom Co., Ltd., photo._ THE DETACHED  BELL-TOWER.]    The spire rises out of the supporting walls of the tower within the  parapet."]]]
