We will, in a future part of this enquiry, endeavour to show that many  of the particular articles of the popular belief respecting magic and  witchcraft were derived from the opinions which the ancient heathens  entertained as part of their religion. To recommend them, however, they  had principles lying deep in the human mind and heart of all times; the  tendency to belief in supernatural agencies is natural, and indeed seems  connected with and deduced from the invaluable conviction of the  certainty of a future state. Moreover, it is very possible that  particular stories of this class may have seemed undeniable in the dark  ages, though our better instructed period can explain them in a  satisfactory manner by the excited temperament of spectators, or the  influence of delusions produced by derangement of the intellect or  imperfect reports of the external senses. They obtained, however,  universal faith and credit; and the churchmen, either from craft or from  ignorance, favoured the progress of a belief which certainly contributed  in a most powerful manner to extend their own authority over the human  mind.    To pass from the pagans of antiquity--the Mahommedans, though their  profession of faith is exclusively unitarian, were accounted worshippers  of evil spirits, who were supposed to aid them in their continual  warfare against the Christians, or to protect and defend them in the  Holy Land, where their abode gave so much scandal and offence to the  devout. Romance, and even history, combined in representing all who were  out of the pale of the Church as the personal vassals of Satan, who  played his deceptions openly amongst them; and Mahound, Termagaunt, and  _Apollo_ were, in the opinion of the Western Crusaders, only so many  names of the arch-fiend and his principal angels. The most enormous  fictions spread abroad and believed through Christendom attested the  fact, that there were open displays of supernatural aid afforded by the  evil spirits to the Turks and Saracens; and fictitious reports were not  less liberal in assigning to the Christians extraordinary means of  defence through the direct protection of blessed saints and angels, or  of holy men yet in the flesh, but already anticipating the privileges  proper to a state of beatitude and glory, and possessing the power to  work miracles.    To show the extreme grossness of these legends, we may give an example  from the romance of \"Richard Coeur de Lion,\" premising at the same time  that, like other romances, it was written in what the author designed to  be the style of true history, and was addressed to hearers and readers,  not as a tale of fiction, but a real narrative of facts, so that the  legend is a proof of what the age esteemed credible and were disposed to  believe as much as if had been extracted from a graver chronicle.    The renowned Saladin, it is said, had dispatched an embassy to King  Richard, with the present of a colt recommended as a gallant war-horse,  challenging Coeur de Lion to meet him in single combat between the  armies, for the purpose of deciding at once their pretensions to the  land of Palestine, and the theological question whether the God of the  Christians, or Jupiter, the deity of the Saracens, should be the future  object of adoration by the subjects of both monarchs. Now, under this  seemingly chivalrous defiance was concealed a most unknightly stratagem,  and which we may at the same time call a very clumsy trick for the devil  to be concerned in. A Saracen clerk had conjured two devils into a mare  and her colt, with the instruction, that whenever the mare neighed, the  foal, which was a brute of uncommon size, should kneel down to suck his  dam. The enchanted foal was sent to King Richard in the belief that the  foal, obeying the signal of its dam as usual, the Soldan who mounted the  mare might get an easy advantage over him.    But the English king was warned by an angel in a dream of the intended  stratagem, and the colt was, by the celestial mandate, previously to the  combat, conjured in the holy name to be obedient to his rider during the  encounter. The fiend-horse intimated his submission by drooping his  head, but his word was not entirely credited. His ears were stopped with  wax. In this condition, Richard, armed at all points and with various  marks of his religious faith displayed on his weapons, rode forth to  meet Saladin, and the Soldan, confident of his stratagem, encountered  him boldly. The mare neighed till she shook the ground for miles around;  but the sucking devil, whom the wax prevented from hearing the summons,  could not obey the signal. Saladin was dismounted, and narrowly escaped  death, while his army were cut to pieces by the Christians. It is but an  awkward tale of wonder where a demon is worsted by a trick which could  hardly have cheated a common horse-jockey; but by such legends our  ancestors were amused and interested, till their belief respecting the  demons of the Holy Land seems to have been not very far different from  that expressed in the title of Ben Jonson's play, \"The Devil is an Ass.\"    One of the earliest maps ever published, which appeared at Rome in the  sixteenth century, intimates a similar belief in the connexion of the  heathen nations of the north of Europe with the demons of the spiritual  world. In Esthonia, Lithuania, Courland, and such districts, the chart,  for want, it may be supposed, of an accurate account of the country,  exhibits rude cuts of the fur-clad natives paying homage at the shrines  of demons, who make themselves visibly present to them; while at other  places they are displayed as doing battle with the Teutonic knights, or  other military associations formed for the conversion or expulsion of  the heathens in these parts. Amid the pagans, armed with scimitars and  dressed in caftans, the fiends are painted as assisting them, pourtrayed  in all the modern horrors of the cloven foot, or, as the Germans term  it, horse's foot, bat wings, saucer eyes, locks like serpents, and tail  like a dragon. These attributes, it may be cursorily noticed, themselves  intimate the connexion of modern demonology with the mythology of the  ancients. The cloven foot is the attribute of Pan--to whose talents for  inspiring terror we owe the word _panic_--the snaky tresses are borrowed  from the shield of Minerva, and the dragon train alone seems to be  connected with the Scriptural history.[5]    [Footnote 5: The chart alluded to is one of the _jac-similes_ of an  ancient planisphere, engraved in bronze about the end of the 15th  century, and called the Borgian Table, from its possessor, Cardinal  Stephen Borgia, and preserved in his museum at Veletri.]    Other heathen nations, whose creeds could not have directly contributed  to the system of demonology, because their manners and even their very  existence was unknown when it was adopted, were nevertheless involved,  so soon as Europeans became acquainted with them, in the same charge of  witchcraft and worship of demons brought by the Christians of the Middle  Ages against the heathens of northern Europe and the Mahommedans of the  East. We learn from the information of a Portuguese voyager that even  the native Christians (called those of St. Thomas), whom the discoverers  found in India when they first arrived there, fell under suspicion of  diabolical practices. It was almost in vain that the priests of one of  their chapels produced to the Portuguese officers and soldiers a holy  image, and called on them, as good Christians, to adore the Blessed  Virgin. The sculptor had been so little acquainted with his art, and the  hideous form which he had produced resembled an inhabitant of the  infernal regions so much more than Our Lady of Grace, that one of the  European officers, while, like his companions, he dropped on his knees,  added the loud protest, that if the image represented the Devil, he paid  his homage to the Holy Virgin.    In South America the Spaniards justified the unrelenting cruelties  exercised on the unhappy natives by reiterating, in all their accounts  of the countries which they discovered and conquered, that the Indians,  in their idol worship, were favoured by the demons with a direct  intercourse, and that their priests inculcated doctrines and rites the  foulest and most abhorrent to Christian ears. The great snake-god of  Mexico, and other idols worshipped with human sacrifices and bathed in  the gore of their prisoners, gave but too much probability to this  accusation; and if the images themselves were not actually tenanted by  evil spirits, the worship which the Mexicans paid to them was founded  upon such deadly cruelty and dark superstition as might easily be  believed to have been breathed into mortals by the agency of hell.    Even in North America, the first settlers in New England and other parts  of that immense continent uniformly agreed that they detected among the  inhabitants traces of an intimate connexion with Satan. It is scarce  necessary to remark that this opinion was founded exclusively upon the  tricks practised by the native powahs, or cunning men, to raise  themselves to influence among the chiefs, and to obtain esteem with the  people, which, possessed as they were professionally of some skill in  jugglery and the knowledge of some medical herbs and secrets, the  understanding of the colonists was unable to trace to their real  source--legerdemain and imposture. By the account, however, of the  Reverend Cotton"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14466"],[0,"South African Memories (#14)"],[1,"Dutch. He reiterated  they did not wish for education for themselves or for their children. If  the young people can read and write, they are considered very good  scholars. This gentleman also expressed great satisfaction at Sir Alfred  Milner and Mr. Chamberlain being at the head of affairs, which he said  was the only thing that gave the colonials confidence. Even now, so many  feared England would give way again in the end. I assured him of this  there was no possibility, and then he said: \"The Transvaal has been a  bad place for Englishmen to live these many years; but if Great Britain  fails us again, we must be off, for then it will be impossible.\" I was  given to understand that the Boers exhibited great curiosity as to who  Mr. Chamberlain was, and that they firmly believed he had made money in  Rand mining shares and gold companies; others fancied he was identical  with the maker of Chamberlain's Cough Syrup, which is advertised  everywhere in the colony.    Early in November we had a great surprise. Mr. Keeley himself turned up  from Mafeking, having been given leave from the town guard to look after  his wife and farm. He had to ride for his life to escape the Boers, who  were drawing much closer to the town, and the news he brought was not  altogether reassuring. True, he stated that the garrison were in  splendid spirits, and that they no longer troubled themselves about the  daily bombardments, as dug-out shelters had been constructed. The young  men, he said, vied with each other in begging for permission to join  scouting-parties at night, to pepper the Boers, often, as a result,  having a brush with the enemy and several casualties. All the same, they  would return at a gallop, laughing and joking. There had been, however,  several very severe fights, notably one on Canon Kopje, where two very  able officers and many men had been killed. In such a small garrison  this loss was a serious one, and the death-roll was growing apace, for,  besides the frequent attacks, the rifle fire in the streets was becoming  very unpleasant. Intelligence was also to hand of the Boers bringing up  one of the Pretoria siege guns, capable of firing a 94-pound shell. This  was to be dragged across the Transvaal at a snail's pace by a team of  twenty oxen, so secure were they against any interruption from the  South. Against these depressing items, he gave intelligence of an  incident that had greatly alarmed the Boers. It seemed that, to get rid  of two trucks of dynamite standing in the railway-station, which were  considered a danger, the same had been sent off to a siding some eight  miles north. The engine-driver unhitched them and made good his escape.  The Boers, thinking the trucks full of soldiers, immediately commenced  bombarding them, till they exploded with terrific force. This chance  affair gave the Boers the idea that Mafeking was full of dynamite, and  later, when I was in the laager, they told me one of the reasons why  they had never pressed an attack home was that they knew the whole town  was mined. Mr. Keeley also told us of a tragedy that had greatly  disturbed the little circle of defenders. The very evening that the  victims of the Canon Kopje fight were laid to rest, Lieutenant  Murchison,[29] of the Protectorate Regiment, had, in consequence of a  dispute, shot dead with his revolver at Dixon's Hotel the  war-correspondent of the London _Daily Chronicle_, a Mr. Parslow. I  afterwards learnt that the court-martial which sat on the former had  fourteen sessions in consequence of its only being able to deliberate  for half an hour at a time in the evening, when the firing was  practically over. The prisoner was ably defended by a Dutch lawyer named  De Koch, and, owing to his having done good service during the siege,  was strongly recommended to mercy, although sentenced to be shot. The  most satisfactory points we gleaned were the splendid behaviour of the  townspeople, and the fine stand made by the natives when the Boers  attacked their stadt, adjacent to the town. The number of Boer  field-guns Mr. Keeley stated to be nine, of the newest type, besides the  monster expected from Pretoria. He also said more expert gunners and  better ammunition had arrived. As to his own position, Mr. Keeley was by  no means sure that either his life or his property were safe, but he  relied on his influence with his neighbours, which was considerable, and  he thought he would be able to keep them quiet and on their farms.    One night, just as my maid was going to bed, she suddenly saw, in the  bright moonlight, a tall figure step out of the shadow of the fir-trees.  For an instant a marauding Boer--a daily bugbear for weeks--flashed  across her mind, but the next moment she recognized Sergeant Matthews  from Setlagoli. He had ridden over post-haste to tell us the Boers were  swarming there, and that he and his men had evacuated the barracks. He  also warned us the same commando was coming here on the morrow, and  advised that all the cattle on the farm should be driven to a place of  safety. This information did not conduce to a peaceful night, but,  anyway, it gave one something to think of besides Mafeking. I buried a  small jewel-case and my despatch-box in the garden, and then we went  calmly to bed to await these unwelcome visitors. Mr. Keeley had  fortunately left the day before on a business visit to a neighbouring  farmer, for his presence would rather have contributed to our danger  than to our safety. When we awoke all was peaceful, and there was every  indication of a piping hot day. Mrs. Keeley was very calm and sensible,  and did not anticipate any rudeness. We decided to receive the burghers  civilly and offer them coffee, trusting that the exodus of all the  cattle would not rouse their ire. Our elaborate preparations were  wasted, for the Boers did not come. The weary hours dragged on, the sun  crawled across the steely blue heavens, and finally sank, almost  grudgingly, it seemed, into the west, leaving the coast clear for the  glorious full moon; the stars came out one by one; the goats and kids  came wandering back to the homestead with loud bleatings; and presently  everything seemed to sleep--everything except our strained nerves and  aching eyes, which had looked all day for Boers, and above all for news,  and had looked in vain.    We still continued to have alarms. One day we saw a horseman wrapped in  a long cloak up to his chin, surmounted by a huge slouch hat, ride into  the yard. Mrs. Keeley exclaimed it was certainly a Boer, and that he had  no doubt come to arrest Mr. Keeley. I was positive the unknown was an  Englishman, but she was so shrewd that I really believed her, and kept  out of sight as she directed, while she sent her brother to question  him. It turned out that the rider was the same _Daily Mail_  correspondent who had cut his way out of Mafeking in order to send his  cables, and that he was now on his way back to the besieged town. The  growth of a two weeks' beard had given him such an unkempt appearance as  to make even sharp Mrs. Keeley mistake him for a Boer. He had had an  interesting if risky ride, which he appeared to have accomplished with  energy and dash, if perhaps with some imprudence.[30]    It was the continued dearth of news, not only concerning Mafeking, but  also of what was going on in the rest of South Africa, that made me at  length endeavour to get news from Vryburg. As a first step I lent Dop to  a young Dutchman named Brevel, who was anxious to go to that township to  sell some fat cattle. This youth, who belonged to a respectable Boer  family--of course heart and soul against the English--was overwhelmed  with gratitude for the loan of the horse, and in consequence I stood  high in their good graces. They little knew it was for my sake, not  theirs, that they had my pony. By this messenger we sent letters for the  English mail, and a note to the magistrate, begging him to forward us  newspapers and any reliable intelligence. I also enclosed a cheque to be  cashed, for I was running short of English gold wherewith to pay our  nigger letter-carriers. I must confess I hardly expected to find anyone  confiding enough to part with bullion, but Mr. Brevel duly returned in a  few days with the money, and said they were very pleased to get rid of  gold in exchange for a cheque on a London bank.    He also, however, brought back our letters, which had been refused at  the post-office, as they would take no letters except with Transvaal  stamps, and for ours, of course, we had used those of Cape Colony.    The magistrate wrote me a miserable letter, saying his office had been  seized by the Boers, who held a daily Kriegsraad there, and that he had  received a safe-conduct to depart. The striking part of the  communication was that a line had been put through \"On H.M. Service\" on  the top of the official envelope. I was really glad to find the young  man had done no good with his own business, having failed to dispose of  any of his cattle. He, a Dutchman, had returned with the feeling that no  property was safe for the moment, and much alarmed by the irresponsible  talk of those burghers who had nothing to lose and everything to gain by  this period of confusion and upheaval. He also greatly disturbed Mr.  Keeley by saying they meant to wreak vengeance on any who had fought for  the English, and by warning him that a commando would surely pass his  way. Further news which this young man proceeded to relate in his awful  jargon was that Oom Paul and all his grandchildren and nephews had gone  to Bulawayo; from there he meant to commence a triumphal march  southward; that Kimberley had capitulated; and that Joubert and his army  had taken possession of Ladysmith. To all this Mrs. Keeley had to listen  with polite attention. Luckily, I did not understand the import of what  he said till he had taken himself off, with an unusually deep bow of"]]]
