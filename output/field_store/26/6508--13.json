The new way of consciousness  substituted itself in him.    The rich suffusion of this state generally kept him happy, reaching its  culmination in the consuming passion for his wife. But at times the flow  would seem to be checked and thrown back. Then it would beat inside him  like a tangled sea, and he was tortured in the shattered chaos of his own  blood. He grew to dread this arrest, this throw-back, this chaos inside  himself, when he seemed merely at the mercy of his own powerful and  conflicting elements. How to get some measure of control or surety, this  was the question. And when the question rose maddening in him, he would  clench his fists as if he would _compel_ the whole universe to submit to  him. But it was in vain. He could not even compel himself.    Tonight, however, he was still serene, though little tremors of  unreasonable exasperation ran through him. He had to handle the razor  very carefully, as he shaved, for it was not at one with him, he was  afraid of it. His hearing also was too much sharpened. He heard the woman  lighting the lamps on the corridor, and attending to the fire in the  visitor's room. And then, as he went to his room he heard the trap  arrive. Then came Isabel's voice, lifted and calling, like a bell  ringing:    'Is it you, Bertie? Have you come?'    And a man's voice answered out of the wind:    'Hello, Isabell There you are.'    'Have you had a miserable drive? I'm so sorry we couldn't send a closed  carriage. I can't see you at all, you know.'    'I'm coming. No, I liked the drive--it was like Perthshire. Well, how are  you? You're looking fit as ever, as far as I can see.'    'Oh, yes,' said Isabel. 'I'm wonderfully well. How are you? Rather thin,  I think--'    'Worked to death--everybody's old cry. But I'm all right, Ciss. How's  Pervin?--isn't he here?'    'Oh, yes, he's upstairs changing. Yes, he's awfully well. Take off your  wet things; I'll send them to be dried.'    'And how are you both, in spirits? He doesn't fret?'    'No--no, not at all. No, on the contrary, really. We've been wonderfully  happy, incredibly. It's more than I can understand--so wonderful: the  nearness, and the peace--'    'Ah! Well, that's awfully good news--'    They moved away. Pervin heard no more. But a childish sense of desolation  had come over him, as he heard their brisk voices. He seemed shut  out--like a child that is left out. He was aimless and excluded, he did  not know what to do with himself. The helpless desolation came over him.  He fumbled nervously as he dressed himself, in a state almost of  childishness. He disliked the Scotch accent in Bertie's speech, and the  slight response it found on Isabel's tongue. He disliked the slight purr  of complacency in the Scottish speech. He disliked intensely the glib way  in which Isabel spoke of their happiness and nearness. It made him  recoil. He was fretful and beside himself like a child, he had almost a  childish nostalgia to be included in the life circle. And at the same  time he was a man, dark and powerful and infuriated by his own weakness.  By some fatal flaw, he could not be by himself, he had to depend on the  support of another. And this very dependence enraged him. He hated Bertie  Reid, and at the same time he knew the hatred was nonsense, he knew it  was the outcome of his own weakness.    He went downstairs. Isabel was alone in the dining-room. She watched him  enter, head erect, his feet tentative. He looked so strong-blooded and  healthy, and, at the same time, cancelled. Cancelled--that was the word  that flew across her mind. Perhaps it was his scars suggested it.    'You heard Bertie come, Maurice?' she said.    'Yes--isn't he here?'    'He's in his room. He looks very thin and worn.'    'I suppose he works himself to death.'    A woman came in with a tray--and after a few minutes Bertie came down. He  was a little dark man, with a very big forehead, thin, wispy hair, and  sad, large eyes. His expression was inordinately sad--almost funny. He  had odd, short legs.    Isabel watched him hesitate under the door, and glance nervously at her  husband. Pervin heard him and turned.    'Here you are, now,' said Isabel. 'Come, let us eat.'    Bertie went across to Maurice.    'How are you, Pervin,' he said, as he advanced.    The blind man stuck his hand out into space, and Bertie took it.    'Very fit. Glad you've come,' said Maurice.    Isabel glanced at them, and glanced away, as if she could not bear to see  them.    'Come,' she said. 'Come to table. Aren't you both awfully hungry? I am,  tremendously.'    'I'm afraid you waited for me,' said Bertie, as they sat down.    Maurice had a curious monolithic way of sitting in a chair, erect and  distant. Isabel's heart always beat when she caught sight of him thus.    'No,' she replied to Bertie. 'We're very little later than usual. We're  having a sort of high tea, not dinner. Do you mind? It gives us such a  nice long evening, uninterrupted.'    'I like it,' said Bertie.    Maurice was feeling, with curious little movements, almost like a cat  kneading her bed, for his place, his knife and fork, his napkin. He was  getting the whole geography of his cover into his consciousness. He sat  erect and inscrutable, remote-seeming Bertie watched the static figure of  the blind man, the delicate tactile discernment of the large, ruddy  hands, and the curious mindless silence of the brow, above the scar. With  difficulty he looked away, and without knowing what he did, picked up a  little crystal bowl of violets from the table, and held them to his nose.    'They are sweet-scented,' he said. 'Where do they come from?'    'From the garden--under the windows,' said Isabel.    'So late in the year--and so fragrant! Do you remember the violets under  Aunt Bell's south wall?'    The two friends looked at each other and exchanged a smile, Isabel's eyes  lighting up.    'Don't I?' she replied. '_Wasn't_ she queer!'    'A curious old girl,' laughed Bertie. 'There's a streak of freakishness  in the family, Isabel.'    'Ah--but not in you and me, Bertie,' said Isabel. 'Give them to Maurice,  will you?' she added, as Bertie was putting down the flowers. 'Have you  smelled the violets, dear? Do!--they are so scented.'    Maurice held out his hand, and Bertie placed the tiny bowl against his  large, warm-looking fingers. Maurice's hand closed over the thin white  fingers of the barrister. Bertie carefully extricated himself. Then the  two watched the blind man smelling the violets. He bent his head and  seemed to be thinking. Isabel waited.    'Aren't they sweet, Maurice?' she said at last, anxiously.    'Very,' he said. And he held out the bowl. Bertie took it. Both he and  Isabel were a little afraid, and deeply disturbed.    The meal continued. Isabel and Bertie chatted spasmodically. The blind  man was silent. He touched his food repeatedly, with quick, delicate  touches of his knife-point, then cut irregular bits. He could not bear to  be helped. Both Isabel and Bertie suffered: Isabel wondered why. She did  not suffer when she was alone with Maurice. Bertie made her conscious of  a strangeness.    After the meal the three drew their chairs to the fire, and sat down to  talk. The decanters were put on a table near at hand. Isabel knocked the  logs on the fire, and clouds of brilliant sparks went up the chimney.  Bertie noticed a slight weariness in her bearing.    'You will be glad when your child comes now, Isabel?' he said.    She looked up to him with a quick wan smile.    'Yes, I shall be glad,' she answered. 'It begins to seem long. Yes, I  shall be very glad. So will you, Maurice, won't you?' she added.    'Yes, I shall,' replied her husband.    'We are both looking forward so much to having it,' she said.    'Yes, of course,' said Bertie.    He was a bachelor, three or four years older than Isabel. He lived in  beautiful rooms overlooking the river, guarded by a faithful Scottish  man-servant. And he had his friends among the fair sex--not lovers,  friends. So long as he could avoid any danger of courtship or marriage,  he adored a few good women with constant and unfailing homage, and he was  chivalrously fond of quite a number. But if they seemed to encroach on  him, he withdrew and detested them.    Isabel knew him very well, knew his beautiful constancy, and kindness,  also his incurable weakness, which made him unable ever to enter into  close contact of any sort. He was ashamed of himself, because he could  not marry, could not approach women physically. He wanted to do so. But  he could not. At the centre of him he was afraid, helplessly and even  brutally afraid. He had given up hope, had ceased to expect any more that  he could escape his own weakness. Hence he was a brilliant and successful  barrister, also _litterateur_ of high repute, a rich man, and a great  social success. At the centre he felt himself neuter, nothing.    Isabel knew him well. She despised him even while she admired him. She  looked at his sad face, his little short legs, and felt contempt of him.  She looked at his dark grey eyes, with their uncanny, almost childlike  intuition, and she loved him. He understood amazingly--but she had no  fear of his understanding. As a man she patronized him.    And she turned to the impassive, silent figure of her husband. He sat  leaning back, with folded arms, and face a little uptilted. His knees  were straight and massive. She sighed, picked up the poker, and again  began to prod the fire, to rouse the clouds of soft, brilliant sparks.    'Isabel tells me,' Bertie began suddenly, 'that you have not suffered  unbearably from the loss of sight.'    Maurice straightened himself to attend, but kept his arms folded.    'No,' he said, 'not unbearably. Now and again one struggles against it,  you know. But there are compensations.'    'They say it is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8952"],[0,"Scientific American, Volume 22, No. 1, January 1, 1870 (#13)"],[1,"left the room on that account. This was unfortunate, as the lecture will  scarcely be exceeded in interest by any subsequent one of the course.  The speaker said that \"In all modern history, interference with science  in the supposed interest of religion--no matter how conscientious such  interference may have been--has resulted in the direst evils both to  religion and science, and _invariably_. And on the other hand all  untrammeled scientific investigation, no matter how dangerous to  religion some of its stages may have seemed, temporarily, to be, has  invariably resulted in the highest good of religion and science. I say  _invariably_--I mean exactly that. It is a rule to which history shows  not one exception. It would seem, logically, that this statement could  not be gainsaid. God's truth must agree, whether discovered by looking  within upon the soul or without upon the world. A truth written upon the  human heart to-day in its full play of emotions or passions, cannot be  at any real variance even with a truth written upon a fossil whose poor  life was gone millions of years ago. And this being so, it would also  seem a truth irrefragable; that the search for each of these kind of  truths must be followed out in its own lines, by its own methods, to its  own results, without any interference from investigators along other  lines by other methods. And it would also seem logically that we might  work on in absolute confidence that whatever, at any moment, might seem  to be the relative positions of the two different bands of workers, they  must at last come together, for truth is one. But logic is not history.  History is full of interferences which have cost the earth dear.  Strangest of all, some of the most direful of them have been made by  the best of men, actuated by the purest motives, seeking the noblest  results. These interferences and the struggle against them make up the  warfare of science. One statement more to clear the ground. You will not  understand me at all to say that religion has done nothing for science.  It has done much for it. The work of Christianity has been mighty  indeed. Through these 2,000 years it has undermined servitude, mitigated  tyranny, given hope to the hopeless, comfort to the afflicted, light to  the blind, bread to the starving, life to the dying, and all this  work continues. And its work for science, too, has been great. It has  fostered science often and developed it. It has given great minds to it,  and but for the fears of the timid its record in this respect would have  been as great as in the other. Unfortunately, religious men started  centuries ago with the idea that purely scientific investigation is  unsafe--that theology must intervene. So began this great modern war.\"    Professor White next reviewed the battle between science and theology  on the subjects of the \"earth's shape, surface, and relations,\" \"the  position of the earth among the heavenly bodies,\" in which Copernicus  and Galileo struggled so bravely and successfully for truth.    The lecturer said:    \"The principal weapons in the combat are worth examining. They are very  easily examined; you may pick them up on any of the battle-fields of  science; but on that field they were used with more effect than on  almost any other. These weapons were two epithets--the epithets  'Infidel' and 'Atheist.' These can hardly be classed with civilized  weapons; they are burning arrows; they set fire to great masses of  popular prejudices. Smoke rises to obscure the real questions. Fire  bursts out at times to destroy the attacked party. They are poisoned  weapons. They go to the heart of loving women; they alienate dear  children; they injure the man after life is ended, for they leave  poisoned wounds in the hearts of those who loved him best--fears for his  eternal happiness, dread of the Divine displeasure. The battle-fields  of science are thickly strewn with these. They have been used against  almost every man who has ever done anything for his fellow-men. The list  of those who have been denounced as Infidel and Atheist includes almost  all great men of science--general scholars, inventors, philanthropists.  The deepest Christian life, the most noble Christian character has not  availed to shield combatants. Christians like Isaac Newton and Pascal,  and John Locke and John Howard, have had these weapons hurled against  them. Nay, in these very times we have seen a noted champion hurl these  weapons against John Milton, and with it another missile which often  appears on these battle-fields--the epithets of 'blasphemer' and 'hater  of the Lord.' Of course, in these days these weapons though often  effective in disturbing the ease of good men and though often powerful  in scaring women, are somewhat blunted. Indeed, they do not infrequently  injure assailants more than assailed. So it was not in the days of  Galileo. These weapons were then in all their sharpness and venom.  The first champion who appears against him is Bellarmine, one of the  greatest of theologians and one of the poorest of scientists. He was  earnest, sincere, learned, but made the fearful mistake for the world  of applying direct literal interpretation of Scripture to science. The  consequences were sad, indeed. Could he with his vast powers have taken  a different course, humanity would have been spared the long and fearful  war which ensued, and religion would have saved to herself thousands  on thousands of the best and brightest men in after ages. The weapons,  which men of Bellarmine's stamp used, were theological. They held  up before the world the dreadful consequences which must result to  Christian theology were the doctrine to prevail that the heavenly bodies  revolve about the sun, and not about the earth.    \"The next great series of battles were fought on those great fields  occupied by such sciences as _Chemistry and Natural Philosophy_. Even  before these sciences were out of their childhood--while yet they were  tottering mainly towards, childish objects and by childish steps--the  champions of that same old mistaken conception of rigid Scriptural  interpretation began the war. The catalogue of chemists and physicists  persecuted or thwarted would fill volumes.\"    After alluding to many other battle-fields of science which might not  for want of time be dwelt upon at length the lecturer reviewed the  battle grounds of medicine and anatomy on which some of the severest  warfare has been waged.    The speaker here remarked that \"perhaps the most unfortunate thing that  has ever been done for Christianity is the tying it to forms of science  and systems of education, which are doomed and gradually sinking. Just  as in the time of Roger Bacon excellent but mistaken men devoted all  their energies to binding Christianity to Aristotle. Just as in the time  of Reuchlin and Erasmus they insisted on binding Christianity to Thomas  Aquinas, so in the time of Vesalius such men gave all efforts to linking  Christianity to Galen. The cry has been the same in all ages. It is the  same which we hear in this age against scientific studies--the cry  for what is called '_sound learning_.' Whether standing for Aristotle  against Bacon, or Aquinas against Erasmus, or Galen against Vesalius,  or making mechanical Greek verses at Eton, instead of studying the  handiwork of the Almighty, or reading Euripides with translations  instead of Leasing and Goethe in the original, the cry always is for  'sound learning.' The idea always is that these studies are _safe_.\"    The speaker next proceeded to show that not alone in Catholic countries,  has such warfare been waged, and that even now in Protestant America the  fight is going on.    One of the fields on which the severest warfare had raged in Protestant  countries was that of Geology. \"From the first lispings of investigators  in this science there was war. The early sound doctrine was that fossil  remains were _lusus naturae_--freaks of nature--and in 1517 Fracastor  was violently attacked because he thought them something more. No less a  man than Bernard Palissy followed up the contest, on the right side, in  France, but it required 150 years to carry the day fairly against this  single preposterous theory. The champion who dealt it the deadly blow  was Scilla, and his weapons were facts obtained by examination of  the fossils of Calabria, (1670). But the advocates of tampering with  scientific reasoning soon retired to a now position. It was strong, for  it was apparently based upon Scripture--though, as the whole world now  knows, an utterly exploded interpretation of Scripture. The new position  was that the fossils were produced by the deluge of Noah. In vain had  it been shown by such devoted Christians as Bernard Palissy that this  theory was utterly untenable; in vain did good men protest against the  injury sure to result to religion by tying it to a scientific theory  sure to be exploded--the doctrine that the fossils were remains of  animals drowned at the flood continued to be upheld by the great  majority as '_sound_' doctrine. It took 120 year for the searchers  of God's truth, as revealed in nature--such men as Buffon, Linnaeus,  Woodward, and Whitehurst--to run under these mighty fabrics of error,  and by statements which could not be resisted, to explode them.    \"Strange as it may at first seem, the war on geology was waged more  fiercely in Protestant countries than Catholic, and of all countries  England furnished the most bitter opponents. You have noted already that  there are generally two sorts of attacks on a new science. First,  there is the attack by pitting against science some great doctrine in  theology. You saw this in astronomy, when Bellarmine and others insisted  that the doctrine of the earth's revolving about the sun is contrary to  the doctrine of the Incarnation. So now against geology it was urged  that the scientific doctrine that "]]]
