Something in the young man's face expressed this opinion, for Gabriel  repeated what he had just said, more earnestly than before, and with  another glance towards Barnaby, again asked what like the man was.    'The night was so dark,' said Edward, 'the attack so sudden, and he so  wrapped and muffled up, that I can hardly say. It seems that--'    'Don't mention his name, sir,' returned the locksmith, following his  look towards Barnaby; 'I know HE saw him. I want to know what YOU saw.'    'All I remember is,' said Edward, 'that as he checked his horse his  hat was blown off. He caught it, and replaced it on his head, which  I observed was bound with a dark handkerchief. A stranger entered the  Maypole while I was there, whom I had not seen--for I had sat apart for  reasons of my own--and when I rose to leave the room and glanced round,  he was in the shadow of the chimney and hidden from my sight. But, if he  and the robber were two different persons, their voices were strangely  and most remarkably alike; for directly the man addressed me in the  road, I recognised his speech again.'    'It is as I feared. The very man was here to-night,' thought the  locksmith, changing colour. 'What dark history is this!'    'Halloa!' cried a hoarse voice in his ear. 'Halloa, halloa, halloa! Bow  wow wow. What's the matter here! Hal-loa!'    The speaker--who made the locksmith start as if he had been some  supernatural agent--was a large raven, who had perched upon the top of  the easy-chair, unseen by him and Edward, and listened with a polite  attention and a most extraordinary appearance of comprehending every  word, to all they had said up to this point; turning his head from one  to the other, as if his office were to judge between them, and it were  of the very last importance that he should not lose a word.    'Look at him!' said Varden, divided between admiration of the bird and a  kind of fear of him. 'Was there ever such a knowing imp as that! Oh he's  a dreadful fellow!'    The raven, with his head very much on one side, and his bright eye  shining like a diamond, preserved a thoughtful silence for a few  seconds, and then replied in a voice so hoarse and distant, that it  seemed to come through his thick feathers rather than out of his mouth.    'Halloa, halloa, halloa! What's the matter here! Keep up your spirits.  Never say die. Bow wow wow. I'm a devil, I'm a devil, I'm a devil.  Hurrah!'--And then, as if exulting in his infernal character, he began  to whistle.    'I more than half believe he speaks the truth. Upon my word I do,'  said Varden. 'Do you see how he looks at me, as if he knew what I was  saying?'    To which the bird, balancing himself on tiptoe, as it were, and moving  his body up and down in a sort of grave dance, rejoined, 'I'm a devil,  I'm a devil, I'm a devil,' and flapped his wings against his sides as  if he were bursting with laughter. Barnaby clapped his hands, and fairly  rolled upon the ground in an ecstasy of delight.    'Strange companions, sir,' said the locksmith, shaking his head, and  looking from one to the other. 'The bird has all the wit.'    'Strange indeed!' said Edward, holding out his forefinger to the raven,  who, in acknowledgment of the attention, made a dive at it immediately  with his iron bill. 'Is he old?'    'A mere boy, sir,' replied the locksmith. 'A hundred and twenty, or  thereabouts. Call him down, Barnaby, my man.'    'Call him!' echoed Barnaby, sitting upright upon the floor, and staring  vacantly at Gabriel, as he thrust his hair back from his face. 'But who  can make him come! He calls me, and makes me go where he will. He goes  on before, and I follow. He's the master, and I'm the man. Is that the  truth, Grip?'    The raven gave a short, comfortable, confidential kind of croak;--a most  expressive croak, which seemed to say, 'You needn't let these fellows  into our secrets. We understand each other. It's all right.'    'I make HIM come?' cried Barnaby, pointing to the bird. 'Him, who never  goes to sleep, or so much as winks!--Why, any time of night, you may see  his eyes in my dark room, shining like two sparks. And every night, and  all night too, he's broad awake, talking to himself, thinking what he  shall do to-morrow, where we shall go, and what he shall steal, and  hide, and bury. I make HIM come! Ha ha ha!'    On second thoughts, the bird appeared disposed to come of himself. After  a short survey of the ground, and a few sidelong looks at the ceiling  and at everybody present in turn, he fluttered to the floor, and went  to Barnaby--not in a hop, or walk, or run, but in a pace like that of  a very particular gentleman with exceedingly tight boots on, trying to  walk fast over loose pebbles. Then, stepping into his extended hand,  and condescending to be held out at arm's length, he gave vent to a  succession of sounds, not unlike the drawing of some eight or ten dozen  of long corks, and again asserted his brimstone birth and parentage with  great distinctness.    The locksmith shook his head--perhaps in some doubt of the creature's  being really nothing but a bird--perhaps in pity for Barnaby, who by  this time had him in his arms, and was rolling about, with him, on the  ground. As he raised his eyes from the poor fellow he encountered those  of his mother, who had entered the room, and was looking on in silence.    She was quite white in the face, even to her lips, but had wholly  subdued her emotion, and wore her usual quiet look. Varden fancied as he  glanced at her that she shrunk from his eye; and that she busied herself  about the wounded gentleman to avoid him the better.    It was time he went to bed, she said. He was to be removed to his own  home on the morrow, and he had already exceeded his time for sitting up,  by a full hour. Acting on this hint, the locksmith prepared to take his  leave.    'By the bye,' said Edward, as he shook him by the hand, and looked from  him to Mrs Rudge and back again, 'what noise was that below? I heard  your voice in the midst of it, and should have inquired before, but our  other conversation drove it from my memory. What was it?'    The locksmith looked towards her, and bit his lip. She leant against the  chair, and bent her eyes upon the ground. Barnaby too--he was listening.    --'Some mad or drunken fellow, sir,' Varden at length made answer,  looking steadily at the widow as he spoke. 'He mistook the house, and  tried to force an entrance.'    She breathed more freely, but stood quite motionless. As the locksmith  said 'Good night,' and Barnaby caught up the candle to light him down  the stairs, she took it from him, and charged him--with more haste and  earnestness than so slight an occasion appeared to warrant--not to stir.  The raven followed them to satisfy himself that all was right below,  and when they reached the street-door, stood on the bottom stair drawing  corks out of number.    With a trembling hand she unfastened the chain and bolts, and turned  the key. As she had her hand upon the latch, the locksmith said in a low  voice,    'I have told a lie to-night, for your sake, Mary, and for the sake of  bygone times and old acquaintance, when I would scorn to do so for my  own. I hope I may have done no harm, or led to none. I can't help the  suspicions you have forced upon me, and I am loth, I tell you plainly,  to leave Mr Edward here. Take care he comes to no hurt. I doubt the  safety of this roof, and am glad he leaves it so soon. Now, let me go.'    For a moment she hid her face in her hands and wept; but resisting the  strong impulse which evidently moved her to reply, opened the door--no  wider than was sufficient for the passage of his body--and motioned him  away. As the locksmith stood upon the step, it was chained and locked  behind him, and the raven, in furtherance of these precautions, barked  like a lusty house-dog.    'In league with that ill-looking figure that might have fallen from a  gibbet--he listening and hiding here--Barnaby first upon the spot last  night--can she who has always borne so fair a name be guilty of such  crimes in secret!' said the locksmith, musing. 'Heaven forgive me if I  am wrong, and send me just thoughts; but she is poor, the temptation  may be great, and we daily hear of things as strange.--Ay, bark away, my  friend. If there's any wickedness going on, that raven's in it, I'll be  sworn.'        Chapter 7      Mrs Varden was a lady of what is commonly called an uncertain temper--a  phrase which being interpreted signifies a temper tolerably certain to  make everybody more or less uncomfortable. Thus it generally happened,  that when other people were merry, Mrs Varden was dull; and that  when other people were dull, Mrs Varden was disposed to be amazingly  cheerful. Indeed the worthy housewife was of such a capricious nature,  that she not only attained a higher pitch of genius than Macbeth, in  respect of her ability to be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,  loyal and neutral in an instant, but would sometimes ring the changes  backwards and forwards on all possible moods and flights in one short  quarter of an hour; performing, as it were, a kind of triple bob major  on the peal of instruments in the female belfry, with a skilfulness and  rapidity of execution that astonished all who heard her.    It had been observed in this good lady (who did not want for personal  attractions, being plump and buxom to look at, though like her  fair daughter, somewhat short in stature) that this uncertainty of  disposition strengthened and increased with her temporal prosperity; and  divers wise men and matrons, on friendly terms with the locksmith and  his family, even went so far as to assert, that a tumble down some  half-dozen rounds in the world's ladder--such as the breaking of the  bank in which her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9172"],[0,"A Study of Association in Insanity (#13)"],[1,"hort--stature..........
