But Madariaga came to the defense of his grandson. \"Ah, the fine  cowboy!\" . . . Seeing him again on the ranch, he admired the dash of the  good looking youth, testing his muscles in order to convince himself  of their strength, and making him to recount his nightly escapades as  ringleader of a band of toughs in the Capital. He longed to go to Buenos  Aires himself, just to see the youngster in the midst of this gay, wild  life. But alas! he was not seventeen like his grandson; he had already  passed eighty.    \"Come here, you false prophet! Tell me how many children you have. . . .  You must have a great many children, you know!\"    \"Father!\" protested Chicha who was always hanging around, fearing her  parent's bad teachings.    \"Stop nagging at me!\" yelled the irate old fellow in a towering temper.  \"I know what I'm saying.\"    Paternity figured largely in all his amorous fancies. He was almost  blind, and the loss of his sight was accompanied by an increasing mental  upset. His crazy senility took on a lewd character, expressing itself in  language which scandalized or amused the community.    \"Oh, you rascal, what a pretty fellow you are!\" he said, leering at  Julio with eyes which could no longer distinguish things except in a  shadowy way. \"You are the living image of my poor dead wife. . . . Have  a good time, for Grandpa is always here with his money! If you could  only count on what your father gives you, you would live like a hermit.  These Frenchies are a close-fisted lot! But I am looking out for you.  Peoncito! Spend and enjoy yourself--that's what your Granddaddy has  piled up the silver for!\"    When the Desnoyers children returned to the Capital, he spent his  lonesome hours in going from ranch to ranch. A young half-breed would  set the water for his shrub-tea to boiling on the hearth, and the old  man would wonder confusedly if she were his daughter. Another, fifteen  years old, would offer him a gourd filled with the bitter liquid and a  silver pipe with which to sip it. . . . A grandchild, perhaps--he wasn't  sure. And so he passed the afternoons, silent and sluggish, drinking  gourd after gourd of shrub tea, surrounded by families who stared at him  with admiration and fear.    Every time he mounted his horse for these excursions, his older daughter  would protest. \"At eighty-four years! Would it not be better for him to  remain quietly at home. . . .\" Some day something terrible would happen.  . . . And the terrible thing did happen. One evening the Patron's  horse came slowly home without its rider. The old man had fallen on the  sloping highway, and when they found him, he was dead. Thus died the  centaur as he had lived, with the lash hanging from his wrist, with his  legs bowed by the saddle.    A Spanish notary, almost as old as he, produced the will. The family  was somewhat alarmed at seeing what a voluminous document it was. What  terrible bequests had Madariaga dictated? The reading of the first part  tranquilized Karl and Elena. The old father had left considerable more  to the wife of Desnoyers, but there still remained an enormous share for  the Romantica and her children. \"I do this,\" he said, \"in memory of my  poor dead wife, and so that people won't talk.\"    After this, came eighty-six legacies. Eighty-five dark-hued individuals  (women and men), who had lived on the ranch for many years as tenants  and retainers, were to receive the last paternal munificence of the old  patriarch. At the head of these was Celedonio whom Madariaga had greatly  enriched in his lifetime for no heavier work than listening to him and  repeating, \"That's so, Patron, that's true!\" More than a million dollars  were represented by these bequests in lands and herds. The one who  completed the list of beneficiaries was Julio Desnoyers. The grandfather  had made special mention of this namesake, leaving him a plantation \"to  meet his private expenses, making up for that which his father would not  give him.\"    \"But that represents hundreds of thousands of dollars!\" protested Karl,  who had been making himself almost obnoxious in his efforts to assure  himself that his wife had not been overlooked in the will.    The days following the reading of this will were very trying ones for  the family. Elena and her children kept looking at the other group as  though they had just waked up, contemplating them in an entirely new  light. They seemed to forget what they were going to receive in their  envy of the much larger share of their relatives.    Desnoyers, benevolent and conciliatory, had a plan. An expert in  administrative affairs, he realized that the distribution among the  heirs was going to double the expenses without increasing the income. He  was calculating, besides, the complications and disbursements necessary  for a judicial division of nine immense ranches, hundreds of thousands  of cattle, deposits in the banks, houses in the city, and debts to  collect. Would it not be better for them all to continue living as  before? . . . Had they not lived most peaceably as a united family? . . .    The German received this suggestion by drawing himself up haughtily.  No; to each one should be given what was his. Let each live in his own  sphere. He wished to establish himself in Europe, spending his wealth  freely there. It was necessary for him to return to \"his world.\"    As they looked squarely at each other, Desnoyers saw an unknown Karl,  a Karl whose existence he had never suspected when he was under his  protection, timid and servile. The Frenchman, too, was beginning to see  things in a new light.    \"Very well,\" he assented. \"Let each take his own. That seems fair to  me.\"        CHAPTER III    THE DESNOYERS FAMILY      The \"Madariagan succession,\" as it was called in the language of  the legal men interested in prolonging it in order to augment their  fees--was divided into two groups, separated by the ocean. The Desnoyers  moved to Buenos Aires. The Hartrotts moved to Berlin as soon as Karl  could sell all the legacy, to re-invest it in lands and industrial  enterprises in his own country.    Desnoyers no longer cared to live in the country. For twenty years,  now, he had been the head of an enormous agricultural and stock raising  business, overseeing hundreds of men in the various ranches. The  parcelling out of the old man's fortune among Elena and the other  legatees had considerably constricted the radius of his authority,  and it angered him to see established on the neighboring lands so many  foreigners, almost all Germans, who had bought of Karl. Furthermore,  he was getting old, his wife's inheritance amounted to about twenty  millions of dollars, and perhaps his brother-in-law was showing the  better judgment in returning to Europe.    So he leased some of the plantations, handed over the superintendence  of others to those mentioned in the will who considered themselves  left-handed members of the family--of which Desnoyers as the Patron  received their submissive allegiance--and moved to Buenos Aires.    By this move, he was able to keep an eye on his son who continued living  a dissipated life without making any headway in his engineering studies.  Then, too, Chichi was now almost a woman--her robust development making  her look older than she was--and it was not expedient to keep her on the  estate to become a rustic senorita like her mother.    Dona Luisa had also tired of ranch life, the social triumphs of her  sister making her a little restless. She was incapable of feeling  jealous, but material ambitions made her anxious that her children  should not bring up the rear of the procession in which the other  grandchildren were cutting such a dashing figure.    During the year, most wonderful reports from Germany were finding their  way to the Desnoyers home in the Capital. \"The aunt from Berlin,\" as the  children called her, kept sending long letters filled with accounts  of dances, dinners, hunting parties and titles--many high-sounding and  military titles;--\"our brother, the Colonel,\" \"our cousin, the Baron,\"  \"our uncle, the Intimate Councillor,\" \"our great-uncle, the Truly  Intimate.\" All the extravagances of the German social ladder, which  incessantly manufactures new titles in order to satisfy the thirst for  honors of a people divided into castes, were enumerated with delight by  the old Romantica. She even mentioned her husband's secretary (a nobody)  who, through working in the public offices, had acquired the title of  Rechnungarath, Councillor of Calculations. She also referred with much  pride to the retired Oberpedell which she had in her house, explaining  that that meant \"Superior Porter.\"    The news about her children was no less glorious. The oldest was the  wise one of the family. He was devoted to philology and the historical  sciences, but his sight was growing weaker all the time because of his  omnivorous reading. Soon he would be a Doctor, and before he was  thirty, a Herr Professor. The mother lamented that he had not military  aspirations, considering that his tastes had somewhat distorted the  lofty destinies of the family. Professorships, sciences and literature  were more properly the perquisites of the Jews, unable, because of their  race, to obtain preferment in the army; but she was trying to console  herself by keeping in mind that a celebrated professor could, in time,  acquire a social rank almost equal to that of a colonel.    Her other four sons would become officers. Their father was preparing  the ground so that they might enter the Guard or some aristocratic  regiment without any of the members being able to vote against their  admission. The two daughters would surely marry, when they had reached  a suitable age with officers of the Hussars whose names bore the magic  \"von\" of petty nobility, haughty and charming gentlemen about whom the  daughter of Misia Petrona waxed most enthusiastic.    The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1487"],[0,"The Perfect Wagnerite: A Commentary on the Niblung's Ring (#14)"],[1," panacea in Night Falls On  The Gods and in the last act of Siegfried is a survival of the first  crude operatic conception of the story, modified by an anticipation of  Wagner's later, though not latest, conception of love as the fulfiller  of our Will to Live and consequently our reconciler to night and death.          NOT LOVE, BUT LIFE    The only faith which any reasonable disciple can gain from The Ring is  not in love, but in life itself as a tireless power which is continually  driving onward and upward--not, please observe, being beckoned or drawn  by Das Ewig Weibliche or any other external sentimentality, but growing  from within, by its own inexplicable energy, into ever higher and  higher forms of organization, the strengths and the needs of which are  continually superseding the institutions which were made to fit our  former requirements. When your Bakoonins call out for the demolition of  all these venerable institutions, there is no need to fly into a panic  and lock them up in prison whilst your parliament is bit by bit doing  exactly what they advised you to do. When your Siegfrieds melt down the  old weapons into new ones, and with disrespectful words chop in twain  the antiquated constable's staves in the hands of their elders, the end  of the world is no nearer than it was before. If human nature, which  is the highest organization of life reached on this planet, is really  degenerating, then human society will decay; and no panic-begotten penal  measures can possibly save it: we must, like Prometheus, set to work to  make new men instead of vainly torturing old ones. On the other hand, if  the energy of life is still carrying human nature to higher and higher  levels, then the more young people shock their elders and deride and  discard their pet institutions the better for the hopes of the world,  since the apparent growth of anarchy is only the measure of the rate of  improvement. History, as far as we are capable of history (which is  not saying much as yet), shows that all changes from crudity of social  organization to complexity, and from mechanical agencies in government  to living ones, seem anarchic at first sight. No doubt it is natural  to a snail to think that any evolution which threatens to do away with  shells will result in general death from exposure. Nevertheless, the  most elaborately housed beings today are born not only without houses on  their backs but without even fur or feathers to clothe them.          ANARCHISM NO PANACEA    One word of warning to those who may find themselves attracted by  Siegfried's Anarchism, or, if they prefer a term with more respectable  associations, his neo-Protestantism. Anarchism, as a panacea, is just as  hopeless as any other panacea, and will still be so even if we breed  a race of perfectly benevolent men. It is true that in the sphere of  thought, Anarchism is an inevitable condition of progressive  evolution. A nation without Freethinkers--that is, without intellectual  Anarchists--will share the fate of China. It is also true that our  criminal law, based on a conception of crime and punishment which is  nothing but our vindictiveness and cruelty in a virtuous disguise, is  an unmitigated and abominable nuisance, bound to be beaten out of  us finally by the mere weight of our experience of its evil and  uselessness. But it will not be replaced by anarchy. Applied to the  industrial or political machinery of modern society, anarchy must always  reduce itself speedily to absurdity. Even the modified form of anarchy  on which modern civilization is based: that is, the abandonment  of industry, in the name of individual liberty, to the upshot of  competition for personal gain between private capitalists, is a  disastrous failure, and is, by the mere necessities of the case, giving  way to ordered Socialism. For the economic rationale of this, I must  refer disciples of Siegfried to a tract from my hand published by the  Fabian Society and entitled The Impossibilities of Anarchism, which  explains why, owing to the physical constitution of our globe, society  cannot effectively organize the production of its food, clothes and  housing, nor distribute them fairly and economically on any anarchic  plan: nay, that without concerting our social action to a much higher  degree than we do at present we can never get rid of the wasteful and  iniquitous welter of a little riches and a deal of poverty which current  political humbug calls our prosperity and civilization. Liberty is an  excellent thing; but it cannot begin until society has paid its daily  debt to Nature by first earning its living. There is no liberty before  that except the liberty to live at somebody else's expense, a liberty  much sought after nowadays, since it is the criterion of gentility, but  not wholesome from the point of view of the common weal.          SIEGFRIED CONCLUDED    In returning now to the adventures of Siegfried there is little more  to be described except the finale of an opera. Siegfried, having passed  unharmed through the fire, wakes Brynhild and goes through all the  fancies and ecstasies of love at first sight in a duet which ends with  an apostrophe to \"leuchtende Liebe, lachender Tod!\", which has been  romantically translated into \"Love that illumines, laughing at Death,\"  whereas it really identifies enlightening love and laughing death as  involving each other so closely as to be usually one and the same thing.          NIGHT FALLS ON THE GODS    PROLOGUE    Die Gotterdammerung begins with an elaborate prologue. The three Norns  sit in the night on Brynhild's mountain top spinning their thread of  destiny, and telling the story of Wotan's sacrifice of his eye, and  of his breaking off a bough from the World Ash to make a heft for his  spear, also how the tree withered after suffering that violence. They  have also some fresher news to discuss. Wotan, on the breaking of his  spear by Siegfried, has called all his heroes to cut down the withered  World Ash and stack its faggots in a mighty pyre about Valhalla. Then,  with his broken spear in his hand, he has seated himself in state in  the great hall, with the Gods and Heroes assembled about him as if  in council, solemnly waiting for the end. All this belongs to the old  legendary materials with which Wagner began The Ring.    The tale is broken by the thread snapping in the hands of the third  Norn; for the hour has arrived when man has taken his destiny in his  own hands to shape it for himself, and no longer bows to circumstance,  environment, necessity (which he now freely wills), and all the rest of  the inevitables. So the Norns recognize that the world has no further  use for them, and sink into the earth to return to the First Mother.  Then the day dawns; and Siegfried and Brynhild come, and have another  duet. He gives her his ring; and she gives him her horse. Away then he  goes in search of more adventures; and she watches him from her crag  until he disappears. The curtain falls; but we can still hear the  trolling of his horn, and the merry clatter of his horse's shoes  trotting gaily down the valley. The sound is lost in the grander rhythm  of the Rhine as he reaches its banks. We hear again an echo of the  lament of the Rhine maidens for the ravished gold; and then, finally, a  new strain, which does not surge like the mighty flood of the river, but  has an unmistakable tramp of hardy men and a strong land flavor about  it. And on this the opera curtain at last goes up--for please remember  that all that has gone before is only the overture.    The First Act    We now understand the new tramping strain. We are in the Rhineside hall  of the Gibichungs, in the presence of King Gunther, his sister Gutrune,  and Gunther's grim half brother Hagen, the villain of the piece. Gunther  is a fool, and has for Hagen's intelligence the respect a fool always  has for the brains of a scoundrel. Feebly fishing for compliments, he  appeals to Hagen to pronounce him a fine fellow and a glory to the  race of Gibich. Hagen declares that it is impossible to contemplate  him without envy, but thinks it a pity that he has not yet found a  wife glorious enough for him. Gunther doubts whether so extraordinary  a person can possibly exist. Hagen then tells him of Brynhild and her  rampart of fire; also of Siegfried. Gunther takes this rather in bad  part, since not only is he afraid of the fire, but Siegfried, according  to Hagen, is not, and will therefore achieve this desirable match  himself. But Hagen points out that since Siegfried is riding about  in quest of adventures, he will certainly pay an early visit to the  renowned chief of the Gibichungs. They can then give him a philtre which  will make him fall in love with Gutrune and forget every other woman he  has yet seen.    Gunther is transported with admiration of Hagen's cunning when he takes  in this plan; and he has hardly assented to it when Siegfried, with  operatic opportuneness, drops in just as Hagen expected, and is duly  drugged into the heartiest love for Gutrune and total oblivion of  Brynhild and his own past. When Gunther declares his longing for the  bride who lies inaccessible within a palisade of flame, Siegfried at  once offers to undertake the adventure for him. Hagen then explains  to both of them that Siegfried can, after braving the fire, appear to  Brynhild in the semblance of Gunther through the magic of the wishing  cap (or Tarnhelm, as it is called throughout The Ring), the use of which  Siegfried now learns for the first time. It is of course part of the  bargain that Gunther shall give his sister to Siegfried in marriage.  On that they swear blood-brotherhood; and at this opportunity the old  operatic leaven breaks out amusingly in Wagner. With tremendous exordium  of brass, the tenor and baritone go at it with a will, showing off  the power of their voices, following each other in canonic imitation,  singing"]]]
