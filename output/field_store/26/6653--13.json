With those of his allies who were Montagnais Indians from Tadoussac,  Champlain returned to that place. As they neared the shore the  Montagnais women undressed themselves, jumped into the river, and swam  to the prows of the canoes, from which they took the heads of the  slain Iroquois. These they hung about their necks as if they had been  some costly chain, singing and dancing meanwhile.    However, in spite of these and other horrors, Champlain had \"separated  from his Upper Canadian allies with loud protestations of mutual  friendship\", promising to go again into their country and assist them  with continued \"fraternal\" relations.    From this expedition Champlain learned much regarding the geography of  eastern North America, and he brought back with him to France, to  present to King Henry IV, two scarlet tanagers--one of the commonest  and most beautiful birds of the eastern United States--a girdle of  porcupine quills made from the Canadian porcupine, and the head of a  gar-pike caught in Lake Champlain.[23]    [Footnote 23: Unconsciously, no doubt, he brought away with him to the  King of France one of the most remarkable freshwater fish living on  the North-American continent, for the gar-pike belongs, together with  the sturgeon and its allies, to an ancient type of fish the  representatives of which are found in rock formations as ancient as  those of the Secondary and Early Tertiary periods. Champlain may be  said to have discovered this remarkable gar-pike (_Lepidosteus  osseus_), which is covered with bony scales \"so strong that a poniard  could not pierce them\". The colour he describes as silver-grey. The  head has a snout two feet and a half long, and the jaws possess double  rows of sharp and dangerous teeth. These teeth were used by the  natives as lancets with which to bleed themselves when they suffered  from inflammation or headache. Champlain declares that the gar-pike  often captures and eats water birds. It would swim in and among rushes  or reeds and then raise its snout out of the water and keep perfectly  still. Birds would mistake this snout for the stump of a tree and  would attempt to alight on it; whereupon the fish would seize them by  the legs and pull them down under the water.]    On Champlain's return from France in 1610 (he and other Frenchmen and  Englishmen of the time made surprisingly little fuss about crossing  the North Atlantic in small sailing vessels, in spite of the storms of  spring and autumn) he found the Iroquois question still agitating the  minds of the Algonkins, Montagnais, and Hurons. Representatives of  these tribes were ready to meet this great captain of the _Mistigosh_  or _Matigosh_[24] (as they called the French), and implored him to  keep his promise to take part in another attack on the dreaded enemy  of the Adirondak heights. Apparently the Iroquois (Mohawks) this time  had advanced to meet the attack, and were ensconced in a round  fortress of logs built near the Richelieu River.[25] The Algonkins and  their allies on this expedition were armed with clubs, swords, and  shields, as well as bows and arrows. The swords of copper(?) were  really knife blades attached to long sticks like billhooks. Before the  barricade, as usual, both parties commenced the fight by hurling  insults at each other till they were out of breath, and shouting \"till  one could not have heard it thunder\". The circular log barricade,  however, would never have been taken by the Algonkins and their  allies but for the assistance of Champlain and three or four  Frenchmen, who with their musketry fire at short range paralysed the  Iroquois. Champlain and one other Frenchman were wounded with arrows  in the neck and arm, but not seriously. The victory of the allies was  followed by the usual torture of prisoners, which Champlain made a  slight--only slight--attempt to prevent.    [Footnote 24: Spelt by Champlain with a \"ch\" instead of _sh_.]    [Footnote 25: Then called the Riviere des Iroquois.]    But results far more serious arose from these two skirmishes with the  Iroquois in 1609 and 1610. The Confederacy of the Five Nations  (afterwards six) realized that they had been attacked unprovoked by  the dominant white men of the St. Lawrence, called by the Montagnais  _Mistigosh_, and by the Iroquois _Adoreset[-u]i_ (\"men of iron\", from  their armour). They became the bitter enemies of the French, and  tendered help first to the Dutch to establish themselves in the valley  of the Hudson, and secondly to the English. In the great Colonial wars  of the early eighteenth century the Iroquois were invaluable allies to  the British forces, Colonial and Imperial, and counted for much in the  struggle which eventually cost France Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,  Maine, the two Canadas, and Louisiana. On the other hand, the French  alliance with the Hurons, Algonkins, and Montagnais, begun by this  brotherhood-in-arms with Champlain, secured for France and the French  such widespread liking among the tribes of Algonkin speech, and their  allies and friends, that the two Canadas and much of the Middle West,  together with Michigan, Wisconsin, and Illinois, became French in  sympathy without any war of conquest. When the French dominion over  North America fell, in 1759, with the capture of Quebec by Wolfe's  army, tribes of Amerindians went on fighting for five years afterwards  to uphold the banner and the rule of the beloved French king.    On Champlain's next visit to Canada, in 1610, he handed over to the  Algonkin Indians a French youth named Etienne Brule (see p. 88), to  be taught the Algonkin language (the use of which was spread far and  wide over north-east America), and, further, sent a Huron youth to  France to be taught French. Between 1611 and 1616 he had explored much  of the country between Montreal (the foundations of which city he may  be said to have laid on May 29, 1611, for his stockaded camp is now in  the centre of it) and Lakes Huron and Ontario, especially along the  Ottawa River, that convenient short cut (as a water route) between the  St. Lawrence at Sault St. Louis (Montreal) and Lakes Huron and  Superior. With short portages you can get in canoes from Montreal to  the waters of Hudson Bay, or to Lake Winnipeg and the base of the  Rocky Mountains.    In exploring this \"River of the Algonkins\" (as he called it),  Champlain was nearly drowned between two rocks, and much hurt, from  over bravery and want of knowledge of how to deal with a canoe on  troubled water; but on June 4, 1613, he stood on the site of the  modern city of Ottawa--the capital of the vast Canadian Dominion--and  gazed at the marvellous Rideau or Curtain Fall, where the Rideau River  enters the Ottawa. But the air was resonant with the sound of falling  water. Three miles above the falls of the Gatineau and the Rideau, the  main Ottawa River descended with a roar and a whirl of white foam and  rainbow-tinted mist into the chasm called the Chaudiere or Kettle. On  a later occasion he describes the way in which the Algonkins  propitiated the Spirit of the Chasm:    \"Continuing our way, we came to the Chaudiere Falls, where the savages  carried out their customary ceremony. After transporting their canoes  to the foot of the fall they assemble in one spot, where one of them  takes up a collection on a wooden platter, into which each person puts  a bit of tobacco. The collection having been made, the plate is placed  in the midst of the troop, and all dance about it, singing after  their style. Then one of the captains makes an harangue, setting forth  that for a long time they have been accustomed to make this offering,  by which means they are ensured protection against their enemies, that  otherwise misfortune would befall them from the evil spirit. This  done, the maker of the harangue takes the plate and throws the tobacco  into the midst of the cauldron (the chasm of foaming water), whereupon  they all together raise a loud cry. These poor people are so  superstitious, that they would not believe it possible for them to  make a prosperous journey without observing this ceremony at this  place; for sometimes their enemies (Iroquois) await them at this  portage, not venturing to go any farther on account of the difficulty  of the journey. Consequently they are occasionally surprised and  killed by the Iroquois at this place (the south bank of the Ottawa).\"    Above the Chaudiere Champlain met the Algonkin chief, Tessouat, and  thus described the burial places of his tribe:    \"On visiting the island I observed their cemeteries, and was struck  with wonder as I saw sepulchres of a shape like shrines, made of  pieces of wood fixed in the ground at a distance of about three feet  from each other, and intersecting at the upper end. On the  intersections above they place a large piece of wood, and in front  another upright piece on which is carved roughly, as would be  expected, the figure of the male or female interred. If it is a man,  they add a shield, a sword attached to a handle after their manner, a  mace, and bow and arrows. If it is a chief, there is a plume on his  head, and some other _matachia_ or embellishment. If it is a child,  they give it a bow and arrow, if a woman or girl, a boiler, an earthen  vessel, a wooden spoon, and an oar. The entire sepulchre is six or  seven feet long at most, and four wide; others are smaller. They are  painted yellow and red, with various ornaments as neatly done as the  carving. The deceased is buried with his dress of beaver or other  skins which he wore when living, and they lay by his side all his  possessions, as hatchets, knives, boilers, and awls, so that these  things may serve him in the land whither he goes; for they believe in  the immortality of the soul, as I have elsewhere observed. These  carved sepulchres are only made "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13015"],[0,"Tales of Old Japan (#14)"],[1,"Ronins, all resolute  fellows and well skilled in the arts of war, they all fled together to  a distant place called Sagara.    All this time Watanabe Kazuma had been brooding over his father's  death, and thinking how he should be revenged upon the murderer; so  when my Lord Kunaishoyu suddenly died, he went to the young Prince  who succeeded him and obtained leave of absence to go and seek out  his father's enemy. Now Kazuma's elder sister was married to a man  named Araki Matayemon, who at that time was famous as the first  swordsman in Japan. As Kazuma was but sixteen years of age, this  Matayemon, taking into consideration his near relationship as  son-in-law to the murdered man, determined to go forth with the lad,  as his guardian, and help him to seek out Matagoro; and two of  Matayemon's retainers, named Ishidome Busuke and Ikezoye Magohachi,  made up their minds, at all hazards, to follow their master. The  latter, when he heard their intention, thanked them, but refused the  offer, saying that as he was now about to engage in a vendetta in  which his life would be continually in jeopardy, and as it would be a  lasting grief to him should either of them receive a wound in such a  service, he must beg them to renounce their intention; but they  answered--    \"Master, this is a cruel speech of yours. All these years have we  received nought but kindness and favours at your hands; and now that  you are engaged in the pursuit of this murderer, we desire to follow  you, and, if needs must, to lay down our lives in your service.  Furthermore, we have heard that the friends of this Matagoro are no  fewer than thirty-six men; so, however bravely you may fight, you will  be in peril from the superior numbers of your enemy. However, if you  are pleased to persist in your refusal to take us, we have made up our  minds that there is no resource for us but to disembowel ourselves on  the spot.\"    When Matayemon and Kazuma heard these words, they wondered at these  faithful and brave men, and were moved to tears. Then Matayemon said--    \"The kindness of you two brave fellows is without precedent. Well,  then, I will accept your services gratefully.\"    Then the two men, having obtained their wish, cheerfully followed  their master; and the four set out together upon their journey to seek  out Matagoro, of whose whereabouts they were completely ignorant.    Matagoro in the meanwhile had made his way, with the old man Sakurai  Jiuzayemon and his thirty Ronins, to Osaka. But, strong as they were  in numbers, they travelled in great secrecy. The reason for this was  that the old man's younger brother, Sakurai Jinsuke, a fencing-master  by profession, had once had a fencing-match with Matayemon, Kazuma's  brother-in-law, and had been shamefully beaten; so that the party were  greatly afraid of Matayemon, and felt that, since he was taking up  Kazuma's cause and acting as his guardian, they might be worsted in  spite of their numbers: so they went on their way with great caution,  and, having reached Osaka, put up at an inn in a quarter called  Ikutama, and hid from Kazuma and Matayemon.    The latter also in good time reached Osaka, and spared no pains to  seek out Matagoro. One evening towards dusk, as Matayemon was walking  in the quarter where the enemy were staying, he saw a man, dressed as  a gentleman's servant, enter a cook-shop and order some buckwheat  porridge for thirty-six men, and looking attentively at the man, he  recognized him as the servant of Sakurai Jiuzayemon; so he hid himself  in a dark place and watched, and heard the fellow say--    \"My master, Sakurai Jiuzayemon, is about to start for Sagara to-morrow  morning, to return thanks to the gods for his recovery from a sickness  from which he has been suffering; so I am in a great hurry.\"    With these words the servant hastened away; and Matayemon, entering  the shop, called for some porridge, and as he ate it, made some  inquiries as to the man who had just given so large an order for  buckwheat porridge. The master of the shop answered that he was the  attendant of a party of thirty-six gentlemen who were staying at such  and such an inn. Then Matayemon, having found out all that he wanted  to know, went home and told Kazuma, who was delighted at the prospect  of carrying his revenge into execution on the morrow. That same  evening Matayemon sent one of his two faithful retainers as a spy to  the inn, to find out at what hour Matagoro was to set out on the  following morning; and he ascertained from the servants of the inn,  that the party was to start at daybreak for Sagara, stopping at Ise to  worship at the shrine of Tersho Daijin.[19]    [Footnote 19: Goddess of the sun, and ancestress of the Mikados.]    Matayemon made his preparations accordingly, and, with Kazuma and his  two retainers, started before dawn. Beyond Uyeno, in the province of  Iga, the castle-town of the Daimio Todo Idzumi no Kami, there is a  wide and lonely moor; and this was the place upon which they fixed for  the attack upon the enemy. When they had arrived at the spot,  Matayemon went into a tea-house by the roadside, and wrote a petition  to the governor of the Daimio's castle-town for permission to carry  out the vendetta within its precincts;[20] then he addressed Kazuma,  and said--    \"When we fall in with Matagoro and begin the fight, do you engage and  slay your father's murderer; attack him and him only, and I will keep  off his guard of Ronins;\" then turning to his two retainers, \"As for  you, keep close to Kazuma; and should the Ronins attempt to rescue  Matagoro, it will be your duty to prevent them, and succour Kazuma.\"  And having further laid down each man's duties with great minuteness,  they lay in wait for the arrival of the enemy. Whilst they were  resting in the tea-house, the governor of the castle-town arrived,  and, asking for Matayemou, said--    \"I have the honour to be the governor of the castle-town of Todo  Idzumi no Kami. My lord, having learnt your intention of slaying your  enemy within the precincts of his citadel, gives his consent; and as a  proof of his admiration of your fidelity and valour, he has further  sent you a detachment of infantry, one hundred strong, to guard the  place; so that should any of the thirty-six men attempt to escape, you  may set your mind at ease, for flight will be impossible.\"    [Footnote 20: \"In respect to revenging injury done to master or  father, it is granted by the wise and virtuous (Confucius) that you  and the injurer cannot live together under the canopy of heaven.    \"A person harbouring such vengeance shall notify the same in writing  to the Criminal Court; and although no check or hindrance may be  offered to his carrying out his desire within the period allowed for  that purpose, it is forbidden that the chastisement of an enemy be  attended with riot.    \"Fellows who neglect to give notice of their intended revenge are like  wolves of pretext, and their punishment or pardon should depend upon  the circumstances of the case.\"--_Legacy of Iyeyasu_, ut supra.]    When Matayemon and Kazurna had expressed their thanks for his  lordship's gracious kindness, the governor took his leave and returned  home. At last the enemy's train was seen in the distance. First came  Sakurai Jiuzayemon and his younger brother Jinsuke; and next to them  followed Kawai Matagoro and Takenouchi Gentan. These four men, who  were the bravest and the foremost of the band of Ronins, were riding  on pack-horses, and the remainder were marching on foot, keeping close  together.    As they drew near, Kazuma, who was impatient to avenge his father,  stepped boldly forward and shouted in a loud voice--    \"Here stand I, Kazuma, the son of Yukiye, whom you, Matagoro,  treacherously slew, determined to avenge my father's death. Come  forth, then, and do battle with me, and let us see which of us twain  is the better man.\"    And before the Ronins had recovered from their astonishment, Matayemon  said--    \"I, Arake Matayemon, the son-in-law of Yukiye, have come to second  Kazuma in his deed of vengeance. Win or lose, you must give us  battle.\"    When the thirty-six men heard the name of Matayemon, they were greatly  afraid; but Sakurai Jiuzayemon urged them to be upon their guard, and  leaped from his horse; and Matayemon, springing forward with his drawn  sword, cleft him from the shoulder to the nipple of his breast, so  that he fell dead. Sakurai Jinsuke, seeing his brother killed before  his eyes, grew furious, and shot an arrow at Matayemon, who deftly cut  the shaft in two with his dirk as it flew; and Jinsuke, amazed at this  feat, threw away his bow and attacked Matayemon, who, with his sword  in his right hand and his dirk in his left, fought with desperation.  The other Ronins attempted to rescue Jinsuke, and, in the struggle,  Kazuma, who had engaged Matagoro, became separated from Matayemon,  whose two retainers, Busuke and Magohachi, bearing in mind their  master's orders, killed five Ronins who had attacked Kazuma, but were  themselves badly wounded. In the meantime, Matayemon, who had killed  seven of the Ronins, and who the harder he was pressed the more  bravely he fought, soon cut down three more, and the remainder dared  not approach him. At this moment there came up one Kano Tozayemon, a  retainer of the lord of the castle-town, and an old friend of  Matayemon, who, when he heard that Matayemon was this day about to  avenge his father-in-law, had seized his spear and set out, for the  sake of the good-will between them, to help him, and act as his  second, and said--    \"Sir Matayemon, hearing of the perilous adventure in which you have  engaged, I have come out to offer myself as your second.\"    Matayemon, hearing this, was rejoiced, and fought with renewed vigour.  Then one of the Ronins, named Takenouchi Gentan, a very brave man,  leaving his companions to do battle with Matayemon, came to the rescue  "]]]
