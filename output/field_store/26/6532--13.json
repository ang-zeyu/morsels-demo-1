[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9886"],[0,"The Book of Delight and Other Papers (#13)"],[1,"thus fulfil the poet's  lines,      Thus shalt thou plant a garden round the tomb,    Where golden hopes may flower, and fruits immortal bloom.          THE SOLACE OF BOOKS      In the year 1190, Judah ibn Tibbon, a famous Provencal Jew, who had  migrated to Southern France from Granada, wrote in Hebrew as follows to his  son:    \"Avoid bad society: make thy books thy companions. Let thy bookcases and  shelves be thy gardens and pleasure grounds. Pluck the fruit that grows  therein; gather the roses, the spices, and the myrrh. If thy soul be  satiate and weary, change from garden to garden, from furrow to furrow,  from scene to scene. Then shall thy desire renew itself, and thy soul be  rich with manifold delight.\"    In this beautiful comparison of a library to a garden, there is one point  missing. The perfection of enjoyment is reached when the library, or at  least a portable part of it, is actually carried into the garden. When  Lightfoot was residing at Ashley (Staffordshire), he followed this course,  as we know from a letter of his biographer. \"There he built himself a small  house in the midst of a garden, containing two rooms below, viz. a study  and a withdrawing room, and a lodging chamber above; and there he studied  hard, and laid the foundations of his Rabbinic learning, and took great  delight, lodging there often, though [quaintly adds John Stype] he was then  a married man.\" Montaigne, whose great-grandfather, be it recalled, was a  Spanish Jew, did not possess a library built in the open air, but he had  the next best thing. He used the top story of a tower, whence, says he, \"I  behold under me my garden.\"    In ancient Athens, philosophers thought out their grandest ideas walking up  and down their groves. Nature sobers us. \"When I behold Thy heavens, the  work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars which Thou hast ordained; what  is man that Thou art mindful of him, and the son of man that Thou visitest  him?\" But if nature sobers, she also consoles. As the Psalmist continues:  \"Thou hast made him but little lower than the angels, and crownest him with  glory and honor. Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of Thy  hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet.\" Face to face with nature,  man realizes that he is greater than she. \"On earth there is nothing great  but man, in man there is nothing great but mind.\" So, no doubt, the  Athenian sages gained courage as well as modesty from the contact of mind  with nature. And not they only, for our own Jewish treasure, the Mishnah,  grew up, if not literally, at least metaphorically, in the open air, in the  vineyard of Jamnia. Standing in the sordid little village which to-day  occupies the site of ancient Jamnia, with the sea close at hand and the  plain of Sharon and the Judean lowlands at my feet, I could see Rabbi  Jochanan ben Zakkai and his comrades pacing to and fro, pondering those  great thoughts which live among us now, though the authors of them have  been in their graves for eighteen centuries.    It is curious how often this habit of movement goes with thinking.  Montaigne says: \"Every place of retirement requires a Walk. My thoughts  sleep if I sit still; my Fancy does not go by itself, as it goes when my  Legs move it.\" What Montaigne seems to mean is that we love rhythm. Body  and mind must move together in harmony. So it is with the Mohammedan over  the Koran, and the Rabbi over the Talmud. Jews sway at prayer for the same  reason. Movement of the body is not a mere mannerism; it is part of the  emotion, like the instrumental accompaniment to a song. The child cons his  lesson moving; we foolishly call it \"fidgeting.\" The child is never  receptive unless also active. But there is another of Montaigne's feelings,  with which I have no sympathy. He loved to think when on the move, but his  walk must be solitary. \"'Tis here,\" he says of his library, \"I am in my  kingdom, and I endeavor to make myself an absolute monarch. So I sequester  this one corner from all society--conjugal, filial, civil.\" This is a  detestable habit. It is the acme of selfishness, to shut yourself up with  your books. To write over your study door \"Let no one enter here!\" is to  proclaim your work divorced from life. Montaigne gloried in the  inaccessibility of his asylum. His house was perched upon an \"overpeering  hillock,\" so that in any part of it--still more in the round room of the  tower--he could \"the better seclude myself from company, and keep  encroachers from me.\" Yet some may work best when there are others beside  them. From the book the reader turns to the child that prattles near, and  realizes how much more the child can ask than the book can answer. The  presence of the young living soul corrects the vanity of the dead old  pedant. Books are most solacing when the limitations of bookish wisdom are  perceived. \"Literature,\" said Matthew Arnold, \"is a criticism of life.\"  This is true, despite the objections of Saintsbury, but I venture to add  that \"life is a criticism of literature.\"    Now, I am not going to convert a paper on the Solace of Books into a paper  in dispraise of books. I shall not be so untrue to my theme. But I give  fair warning that I shall make no attempt to scale the height or sound the  depth of the intellectual phases of this great subject. I invite my reader  only to dally desultorily on the gentler slopes of sentiment.    One of the most comforting qualities of books has been well expressed by  Richard of Bury in his famous Philobiblon, written in 1344. This is an  exquisite little volume on the Love of Books, which Mr. Israel Gollancz has  now edited in an exquisite edition, attainable for the sum of one shilling.  \"How safely,\" says Richard, \"we lay bare the poverty of human ignorance to  books, without feeling any shame.\"    Then he goes on to describe books as those silent teachers who \"instruct us  without rods or stripes; without taunts or anger; without gifts or money;  who are not asleep when we approach them, and do not deny us when we  question them; who do not chide us when we err, or laugh at us if we are  ignorant.\"    It is Richard of Bury's last phrase that I find so solacing. No one is ever  ashamed of turning to a book, but many hesitate to admit their ignorance to  an interlocutor. Your dictionary, your encyclopedia, and your other books,  are the recipients of many a silent confession of nescience which you would  never dream of making auricular. You go to these \"golden pots in which  manna is stored,\" and extract food exactly to your passing taste, without  needing to admit, as Esau did to Jacob, that you are hungry unto death.  This comparison of books to food is of itself solacing, for there is always  something attractive in metaphors drawn from the delights of the table. The  metaphor is very old.    \"Open thy mouth,\" said the Lord to Ezekiel, \"and eat that which I give  thee. And when I looked, a hand was put forth unto me, and, lo, a scroll of  a book was therein.... Then I did eat it, and it was in my mouth as honey  for sweetness.\"    What a quaint use does Richard of Bury make of this very passage!  Addressing the clergy, he says \"Eat the book with Ezekiel, that the belly  of your memory may be sweetened within, and thus, as with the panther  refreshed, to whose breath all beasts and cattle long to approach, the  sweet savor of the spices it has eaten may shed a perfume without.\"    Willing enough would I be to devote the whole of my paper to Richard of  Bury. I must, however, content myself with one other noble extract, which,  I hope, will whet my reader's appetite for more: \"Moses, the gentlest of  men, teaches us to make bookcases most neatly, wherein they [books] may be  protected from any injury. Take, he says, this book of the Law and put it  in the side of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God. O fitting  place and appropriate for a library, which was made of imperishable shittim  [i.e. acacia] wood, and was covered within and without with gold.\"    Still we must not push this idea of costly bookcases too far. Judah the  Pious wrote in the twelfth century, \"Books were made for use, not to be  hidden away.\" This reminds me that Richard of Bury is not the only medieval  book-lover with whom we might spend a pleasant evening. Judah ben Samuel  Sir Leon, surnamed the Pious, whom I have just quoted, wrote the \"Book of  the Pious\" in Hebrew, in 1190, and it has many excellent paragraphs about  books. Judah's subject is, however, the care of books rather than the  solace derivable from them. Still, he comes into my theme, for few people  can have enjoyed books more than he. He had no selfish love for them: he  not only possessed books, he lent them. He was a very prince of  book-lenders, for he did not object if the borrowers of his books re-lent  them in their turn. So, on dying, he advised his sons to lend his books  even to an enemy (par. 876). \"If a father dies,\" he says elsewhere (par.  919), \"and leaves a dog and a book to his sons, one shall not say to the  other, You take the dog, and I'll take the book,\" as though the two were  comparable in value. Poor, primitive Judah the Pious! We wiser moderns  should never dream of making the comparison between a dog and a book, but  for the opposite reason. Judah shrank from equalling a book to a dog, but  we know better than to undervalue a dog so far as to compare it with a  book. The kennel costs more than the bookcase, and love of dogs is a higher  solace than love of books. To those who think thus, what more convincing  condemnation of books could be formulated than the phrase coined by Gilbert  de Porre in praise of his library, \"It is a garden of immortal fruits,  without dog or dragon.\"    I meant to part with Richard of Bury, but I must ask permission to revert  to him. Some of the delight he felt in books arose from his preference of  reading to oral intercourse. \"The truth in speech perishes with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9897"],[0,"Introductory American History (#13)"],[1,"of his monastery, happened to be passing and asked who they were.    He was told they were Angles. \"Angels,\" he cried, \"yes, they have faces    like angels, and should become companions of the angels in heaven.\" When    this good abbot became pope, he sent missionaries to Angle-land and they    established themselves at Canterbury.      [Illustration: GREGORY AND THE LITTLE ENGLISH SLAVES]    MISSIONARIES TO THE GERMANS AND THE SLAVS. The conversion of the    English helped in the spread of Christianity on the Continent, for    Boniface, an English monk, was the greatest missionary to the Germans.    He won thousands from the worship of their ancient gods and founded many    churches. The Slavs, who lived east of the Germans, were taught by    missionaries from Constantinople instead of from Rome.    THE EDUCATED MEN OF THE MIDDLE AGES. The missionaries and teachers    of the Church had been educated like the older Romans. They read Roman    books, and tried to preserve the knowledge which both Greeks and Romans    had gathered. Influenced by them, the emigrants and conquerors from the    north also tried to be like the Romans. Educated men, and especially the    priests of the Church, used Latin as their language. In this way some    parts of the old Roman and Greek civilization were preserved, although    the Roman government had fallen and many beautiful cities were mere    heaps of ruins.    THE VIKINGS. The emigration of whole peoples from one part of    Europe to another did not stop when the Roman Empire was overrun. New    peoples appeared and sought to plunder or crowd out the tribes which had    already settled within its boundaries and were learning the ways of    civilization.      One of these peoples came from the regions now known as Norway, Sweden,    and Denmark. They were called Danes by the English, and Northmen or    Normans by other Europeans. They had another name, Vikings, which was    their word for sea-rovers.      It was their custom to sail the seas and rivers rather than march on the    land. They were a hardy and daring people, who liked nothing better than    to fight and conquer and rob in other countries. There was not a land in    western Europe, even as far south as Sicily, that they did not visit.    Wherever they went they plundered and burned and murdered, leaving a    blackened trail.    THE DANES IN ENGLAND. The Danes ravaged the eastern and southern    shores of England, and after they were tired of robbery, partly because    there was little left to take, they began to settle in the land. Alfred,    the greatest of the early English kings, was driven by them into the    swamps for a while, but in the year 878 A.D. he conquered an army of    them in battle and persuaded one of their kings to be baptized as a    Christian. Alfred was obliged to allow them to keep the eastern portion    of England, a region called Danelaw, because the law of the Danes was    obeyed there.      [Illustration: A VIKING SHIP AT SEA]    THE DANES BECOME NORMANS. No more Danes or Northmen came to trouble    England for a time, but instead they crossed the Channel to France and    rowed up the Seine and tried to capture Paris. A few years later a    Frankish king gave them the city of Rouen, further down the Seine, and    the region about it which was called Normandy. These Normans also    accepted Christianity.    THE VIKINGS BECOME DISCOVERERS. Before another hundred years had    passed the Northmen performed a feat more difficult than sailing up    rivers and burning towns. They were the first to venture far out of    sight of land, though their ships were no larger than our fishing boats.    These bold sailors visited the Orkney and the Shetland Islands, north of    Scotland, and finally reached Iceland. In Iceland their sheep and cattle    flourished, and a lively trade in fish, oil, butter, and skins sprang up    with the old homeland and with the British islands.      Before long one of the settlers, named Eric the Red, led a colony to    Greenland, the larger and more desolate island further west. He called    it Greenland because, he said, men would be more easily persuaded to go    there if the land had a good name. This was probably in the year 985.      [Illustration: LEIF ERICSON From the statue in Boston]    DISCOVERY OF VINLAND. Eric had a son, called Leif Ericson, or Leif    the Lucky, who visited Norway and was well received at the court of King    Olaf. Not long before missionaries had persuaded Olaf and his people to    give up their old gods and accept Christianity, and Leif followed their    example. Leif set out in the early summer of the year 1000 to carry the    new religion to his father, Eric the Red, to his father's people, and to    his neighbors. The voyage was a long one, lasting all the summer, for on    the way his ship was driven out of its course and came upon strange    lands where wild rice and grape-vines and large trees grew. The milder    climate and stories of large trees useful for building ships aroused the    curiosity of the Greenlanders.      They sent exploring expeditions, and found the coast of North America at    places which they called Helluland, that is, the land of flat stones;    Markland, the land of forests; and Vinland, where the grape-vines grow.    Helluland was probably on the coast of Labrador, Markland somewhere on    the shores of Newfoundland, and Vinland in Nova Scotia.    THE SETTLEMENT IN VINLAND. Thornfinn Karlsefni, a successful trader    between Iceland and Greenland, attempted to plant a colony in the new    lands. Karlsefni and his friends, to the number of one hundred and sixty    men and several women, set out in 1007 with three or four ships, loaded    with supplies and many cattle. They built huts and remained three or    four winters in Vinland, but all trace of any settlement    disappeared long ago.      They found, their stories tell us, swarthy, rough-looking Indians, with    coarse hair, large eyes, and broad cheeks, with whom they traded red    cloth for furs. Trouble broke out between the Northmen and the Indians,    who outnumbered them. So many Northmen were killed that the survivors    became alarmed and returned to Greenland.      [Illustration: DISCOVERIES OF THE NORTHMEN The American lands    they found are marked with diagonal lines]    VINLAND FORGOTTEN. The voyages to Vinland soon ceased and the    discoveries of Leif and his followers were only remembered in the songs    or \"sagas\" of the people. They thought of Vinland mainly as a land of    flat stones, great trees, and fierce natives. Nor did the wise men of    Europe who heard the Northmen's story guess that a New World had been    discovered. It was probably fortunate that five hundred years were to go    by before Europeans settled in America, for within that time they were    to learn a great deal and to find again many things which the Romans had    left but which in the year 1000 were hidden away, either in the ruins of    the ancient cities or in libraries and treasure-houses, where few knew    of them. The more Europeans possessed before they set out, the more    Americans would have to start with.      [Illustration: FACSIMILE OF A BIT OF AN OLD SAGA MANUSCRIPT]          QUESTIONS        1.

The Middle Ages, like Ancient Times, are    recalled by many interesting tales. Some of them, such as the stories of    King Arthur and his Knights, the story of Roland, and the Song of the    Niebelungs, are only tales and not history. Others tell us about great    kings, Charlemagne and St. Louis of France, Frederick the Redbeard of    Germany, or St. Stephen of Hungary. The hero-king for England was    Alfred, who fought bravely against the pirate Danes and finally    conquered and persuaded many of them to live quietly under his rule.
