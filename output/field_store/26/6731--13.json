Of the  hymns in the eighth book the second appears to be a later imitation of  the first, and the first appears, from several indications, to be of  comparatively recent origin.[72] In the seventh book (vii. 86-89) the  short final hymn contains a distinctly late trait in invoking Varuna  to cure dropsy; the one preceding this is _in majorem gloriam_ of the  poet Vasistha, fitly following the one that appears to be as new,  where not only the mysticism but the juggling with \"thrice-seven,\"  shows the character of the hymn to be recent.[73] In the first hymn of  this book the late doctrine of inherited sin stands prominently forth  (vii. 86. 5) as an indication of the time in which it was composed.  The fourth and sixth books have no separate hymns to Varuna. In the  fifth book the position of the one hymn to Varuna is one favorable to  spurious additions, but the hymn is not otherwise obnoxious to the  criticism of lateness. Of the two hymns in the second book, the first  is addressed only indirectly to Varuna, nor is he here very prominent;  the second (ii. 28) is the only song which stands on a par with the  hymn already translated. There remain the hymns cited above from the  first, not a family-book. It is, moreover, noteworthy that in ii. 28,  apart from the ascription of general greatness, almost all that is  said of Varuna is that he is a priest, that he causes rivers to flow,  and loosens the bond of sin.[74] The finest hymn to Varuna, from a  literary point of view, is the one translated above, and it is mainly  on the basis of this hymn that the lofty character of Varuna has been  interpreted by occidental writers. To our mind this hymn belongs to  the close of the first epoch of the three which the hymns represent.  That it cannot be very early is evident from the mention of the  intercalated month, not to speak of the image of Varuna eating the  sweet oblation 'like a priest.' Its elevated language is in sharp  contrast to that of almost all the other Varuna hymns. As these are  all the hymns where Varuna is praised alone by himself, it becomes of  chief importance to study him here, and not where, as in iii. 62, iv.  41, vi. 51, 67, 68, and elsewhere, he is lauded as part of a  combination of gods (Mitra or Indra united with Varuna). In the last  book of the Rig Veda there is no hymn to Varuna,[75] a time when  pantheistic monotheism was changing into pantheism, so that, in the  last stage of the Rig Veda, Varuna is descended from the height.  Thereafter he is god and husband of waters, and punisher of secret sin  (as in ii. 28). Important in contrast to the hymn translated above is  v. 85.      TO VARUNA.    \"I will sing forth unto the universal king a high deep prayer, dear to  renowned Varuna, who, as a butcher a hide, has struck earth apart  (from the sky) for the sun. Varuna has extended air in trees, strength  in horses, milk in cows, and has laid wisdom in hearts; fire in water;  the sun in the sky; _soma_ in the stone. Varuna has inverted his  water-barrel and let the two worlds with the space between flow (with  rain). With this (heavenly water-barrel) he, the king of every created  thing, wets the whole world, as a rain does a meadow. He wets the  world, both earth and heaven, when he, Varuna, chooses to milk out  (rain)--and then do the mountains clothe themselves with cloud, and  even the strongest men grow weak. Yet another great and marvellous  power of the renowned spirit (Asura) will I proclaim, this, that  standing in mid-air he has measured earth with the sun, as if with a  measuring rod. (It is due to) the marvellous power of the wisest god,  which none ever resisted, that into the one confluence run the rivers,  and pour into it, and fill it not. O Varuna, loosen whatever sin we  have committed to bosom-friend, comrade, or brother; to our own house,  or to the stranger; what (we) have sinned like gamblers at play, real  (sin), or what we have not known. Make loose, as it were, all these  things, O god Varuna, and may we be dear to thee hereafter.\"    In this hymn Varuna is a water-god, who stands in mid-air and directs  the rain; who, after the rain, reinstates the sun; who releases from  sin (as water does from dirt?). According to this conception it would  seem that Varuna were the 'coverer' rather than the 'encompasser.' It  might seem probable even that Varuna first stood to Dyaus as cloud and  rain and night to shining day, and that his counterpart, (Greek:  Hohyranhos), stood in the same relation to (Greek: Zehys); that were  connecte(Greek: Hohyranhos)d with (Greek: hyrheo) and Varuna with  _vari_, river, _v[=a]ri_, water.[76]    It is possible, but it is not provable. But no interpretation of  Varuna that ignores his rainy side can be correct. And this is fully  recognized by Hillebrandt. On account of his \"thousand spies,\" _i.e.,_  eyes, he has been looked upon by some as exclusively a night-god. But  this is too one-sided an interpretation, and passes over the  all-important, fact that it is only in conjunction with the sun  (Mitra), where there is a strong antithesis, that the night-side of  the god is exclusively displayed. Wholly a day-god he cannot be,  because he rules night and rain. He is _par excellence_ the Asura,  and, like Ahura Mazdao, has the sun for an eye, _i.e.,_ he is heaven.  But there is no Varuna in Iranian worship and Ahura is a sectarian  specialization. Without this name may one ascribe to India what is  found in Iran?[77] It has been suggested by Bergaigne that Varuna and  Vritra, the rain-holding demon, were developments from the same idea,  one revered as a god, the other, a demon; and that the word means  'restrainer,' rather than 'encompasser.'    From all this it will be evident that to claim an original monotheism  as still surviving in the person of Varuna, is impossible; and this is  the one point we would make. Every one must admire the fine hymn in  which he is praised, but what there is in it does not make it seem  very old, and the intercalated month is decisive evidence, for here  alone in the Rig Veda is mentioned this month, which implies the  five-year cyclus, but this belongs to the Brahmanic period (Weber,  _Vedische Beitraege_, p. 38). Every explanation of the original nature  of Varuna must take into consideration that he is a rain-god, a  day-god, and a night-god in turn, and that where he is praised in the  most elevated language the rain-side disappears, although it was  fundamental, as may be seen by comparing many passages, where Varuna  is exhorted to give rain, where his title is 'lord of streams,' his  position that of 'lord of waters.' The decrease of Varuna worship in  favor of Indra results partly from the more peaceful god of rain  appearing less admirable than the monsoon-god, who overpowers with  storm and lightning, as well as 'wets the earth.'    The most valuable contribution to the study of Varuna is Hillebrandt's  'Varuna and Mitra.' This author has succeeded in completely  overthrowing the old error that Varuna is exclusively a night-god.[78]  Quite as definitively he proves that Varuna is not exclusively a  day-god.    Bergaigne, on the other hand, claims an especially tenebrous character  for Varuna.[79] Much has been written on luminous deities by scholars  that fail to recognize the fact that the Hindus regard the night both  as light and as dark. But to the Vedic poet the night, star-illumined,  was bright. Even Hillebrandt speaks of \"the bright heaven\" of day as  \"opposed to the dark night-heaven in which Varuna also shows  himself.\"[80]    In the Rig Veda, as it stands, with all the different views of Varuna  side by side, Varuna is a universal encompasser, moral as well as  physical. As such his physical side is almost gone. But the conception  of him as a moral watcher and sole lord of the universe is in so sharp  contrast to the figure of the rain-god, who, like Parjanya, stands in  mid-air and upsets a water-barrel, that one must discriminate even  between the Vedic views in regard to him.[81]    It is Varuna who lets rivers flow; with Indra he is besought not to  let his weapons fall on the sinner; wind is his breath.[82]    On the other hand he is practically identified with the sun.[83] How  ill this last agrees with the image of a god who 'lives by the spring  of rivers,' 'covers earth as with a garment,' and 'rises like a secret  sea (in fog) to heaven'![84] Even when invoked with the sun, Mitra,  Varuna still gives rain: \"To whomsoever ye two are kindly disposed  comes sweet rain from heaven; we beseech you for rain ... you, the  thunderers who go through earth and heaven\" (v. 63),--a strange prayer  to be addressed to a monotheistic god of light: \"Ye make the lightning  flash, ye send the rain; ye hide the sky in cloud and rain\" (_ib_.).  In the hymn preceding we read: \"Ye make firm heaven and earth, ye give  growth to plants, milk to cows; O ye that give rain, pour down rain!\"  In the same group another short hymn declares: \"They are universal  kings, who have _ghee_ (rain) in their laps; they are lords of the  rain\" (v. 68). In the next hymn: \"Your clouds (cows) give nourishment,  your streams are sweet.\" Thus the twain keep the order of the seasons  (i. 2. 7-8) and protect men by the regular return of the rainy season.  Their weapons are always lightning (above, i. 152. 2, and elsewhere).  A short invocation in a family-book gives this prayer: \"O  Mitra-Varuna, wet our meadows with _ghee_; wet all places with the  sweet drink\" (iii. 62. 16).    The interpretation given above of the office of Varuna as regards the  sun's path, is supported by a verse where is made an allusion to the  time \"when they release the sun's horses,\" _i.e_., when after two or  three months of rain the sun shines again (v. 62. 1). In another verse  one reads: \"Ye direct the waters, sustenance of earth and heaven,  richly let come your rains\" (viii. 25. 6).

In some children we notice that months and even years  after an attack of whooping-cough, a slight bronchial catarrh may be  sufficient to bring back the characteristic cough. In laryngismus in  the same way we may suppose that the reflex path is made easy and the  resistance lowered by constant use. Fortunately the spasms are not  usually difficult to control. Calcium bromide, in doses of from two to  four grains, according to age, three times daily, is generally  successful with or without the addition of chloral hydrate in small  doses. At the same time we must endeavour in every way possible to  keep the child calm, by paying close attention to nursery management.  The child with spasmophilia is as a rule excitable and easily upset,  and although calcium bromide is a drug which offers powerful aid it is  not able to achieve its effect unless we are able at the same time to  guarantee a reasonable immunity from emotional upsets. It is for this  reason that I have included some description of laryngismus, although  its origin is undoubtedly very different from that of the other  disorders of conduct which we have examined.      MIGRAINE AND CYCLIC VOMITING    The aetiology of cyclic or periodic vomiting in childhood is not yet  completely understood. We do not know how far it is dependent upon  disturbance of the liver, and it is still disputed whether the  acidosis which accompanies it is the cause or the result of the  profuse vomiting. Into these difficult questions we need not at the  moment enter. It is enough in the present connection to recognise that  the great majority of children who suffer from cyclic vomiting are  sensitive, excitable, and nervous, and that every one is agreed that  the nervous system is intimately concerned in its causation.    A close association between cyclic vomiting in children and that form  of periodic headache known as migraine has often been observed. It is  sometimes found that one or both parents of a child with cyclic  vomiting suffer habitually from migraine. In a few instances the one  condition has been observed to be gradually replaced by the other, the  child with cyclic vomiting becoming in adult life a sufferer from  migraine. There is indeed much which is common to the two conditions.  The periodic nature of the seizure, often following a time when the  general health and vigour appear to have been at their optimum, the  extreme prostration, and the comparatively sudden recovery are found  in both. In the cyclic vomiting of children, it is true, little  complaint is made of headache, the visual aura is absent, and the  vomiting is invariably the most prominent symptom.    Cyclic vomiting seldom occurs before the fourth year. It is  characterised by sudden profuse and persistent vomiting and by very  great prostration. All food, it may be even water, is promptly  rejected. The vomited matter is generally stained with bile;  occasionally the violence of the vomiting causes haematemesis. In many  cases the temperature is raised; sometimes it may be as high as 103 deg.  F. The duration of an attack varies. In most cases it does not last  longer than forty-eight hours. On the other hand, attacks lasting as  long as a week are by no means unknown. Within a short time of the  onset the urine may be found to contain acetone bodies, the breath may  smell distinctly of acetone, and the child may become torpid and  drowsy or agitated and restless. At times there may be exaggerated and  deepened respiratory movements--the so-called air hunger. In many  cases, however, otherwise characteristic, these more severe  manifestations are absent or but little apparent. Recovery is usually  rapid and complete. The child asks for food, which is retained. A  fatal ending is very rare, though not unknown. The frequency of  attacks is very various. Sometimes months or even years may elapse  between successive seizures; in other cases a fortnightly or monthly  rhythm establishes itself.    It is clear that both the frequency and the severity of the attacks  are much influenced by the general state of the child's health. Like  migraine, cyclic vomiting appears to be a symptom of nervous  exhaustion. It affects, for the most part, children who are  intellectually alert, impressionable, and forward for their age, and  who, when well, throw themselves into work or play with a great  expenditure of nervous energy. Often their physical development is  unsatisfactory, and we must set ourselves to correct this as the first  step in prevention. It is highly important that children suffering in  this way should have free opportunities for exercise in the open  country, and that all the excretory organs--the skin, kidneys, and  bowels--should be acting freely and efficiently. The child should live  a life of ordered routine. Sleep should be sound and sufficient in  amount. The diet must not exceed the strict physiological needs. Many  of these children appear to have a lowered tolerance for fats of all  sorts, and it may be necessary to limit strictly the consumption of  milk, cream, butter, and so forth. A daily administration of a small  dose of alkali by the mouth is credited with preventing attacks. In  the present connection, however, we shall not do wrong to emphasise  the part played by the nervous system in the production of the  attacks. In all cases of cyclic vomiting it should be our endeavour to  recognise and remove the elements in the daily life of the child which  are proving too exhausting.    UNEXPLAINED PYREXIA    In nervous children we sometimes meet with inexplicable rises of  temperature. The pyrexia may have the same periodic character as that  just noted in cases of cyclic vomiting. At intervals of three, four,  or five weeks there may be a rise of temperature to 103 deg. F., or even  higher, which may last for two or three days before subsiding. In  other cases the chart shows a slight persistent rise over many weeks  or months. That in nervous children the temperature may be very  considerably elevated without our being able to detect much that is  amiss does not of course make it any the less necessary to be careful  to exclude organic disease. Pyelitis, tuberculosis, and latent otitis  media occur with nervous children as with others and must not be  overlooked. If, however, organic disease can be excluded, and if the  pyrexia is the only circumstance which prevents the decision that the  child is well and should be treated as well, then the thermometer may  be overruled and the pyrexia neglected.          CHAPTER VI    ENURESIS      I have dealt in previous chapters with certain common disorders of  conduct in childhood, which show clearly their origin in the  apprehensions of the grown-up people who have charge of the children,  and in the unwise suggestions which they convey to them. The same  forces are at work in the production of enuresis, or bed wetting,  although the matter is here often complicated by the development later  on of a sense of shame and unhappiness in the child. There comes a  time when the child passionately desires to regain control and is  miserable about her failure, until the concentration of her thoughts  on the subject becomes a veritable obsession. Every night she goes to  bed with this only in her mind. Every night she falls asleep,  miserably aware that she will wake to find the bed wetted. The  suggestion impressed in the first place on the mind of the tiny child  by injudicious management has become fixed by the growing sense of  shame and the complete loss of self-confidence.    It is usually taught that a great variety of causes is concerned in  producing enuresis. It is said to be due to a partial asphyxia during  sleep from adenoid vegetation. It is said to be caused by phimosis,  and to be cured by circumcision. It is said that the urine is often  too acid and so irritating that the bladder refuses to retain it for  the usual length of time. It is said that enuresis may be due to a  deficiency of the thyroid secretion, and that it can be cured by  thyroid extract. Such a number of rival causes may make us hesitate to  accept the claims of any one of them. Certainly I have not been able  to satisfy myself that any one of these conditions exercises any  influence at all or is commonly present in cases of enuresis. I think  that if we examine a large number of cases of bed wetting in children  we can come to no other conclusion than that the cause of the trouble  is due to just such a pervasion of suggestion as we have been  considering above.    There are certain points in the behaviour of a child with enuresis  which seem to point to this conclusion.    _(a)_ In the first place, the trouble is seldom serious or very well  developed in early childhood, and the reason for this, I take it, is  that an occasional lapse in a child of perhaps two or three years of  age is usually treated lightly and in the proper spirit of tolerance.  It is only with children a little older that nurses and parents become  distressed and begin unwittingly by urging the child to present the  suggestion to her mind, that the bed may or will be wetted. Hence the  usual history is that control was partially acquired in the second  year, but that, instead of later becoming complete, relapses began to  be more frequent, and that since that time all that can be done seems  only to make matters worse.    _(b)_ In the second place, the influence of suggestion is shown by the  behaviour of the child when removed to a hospital for observation. It  is the invariable experience that the enuresis then promptly stops. In  hospital the attitude of those around the child is entirely different.  She has the comfortable and consoling feeling that in wetting the bed  she is doing exactly what is expected of her. There is even a feeling  that otherwise she is showing herself to be something of a fraud, and  that she has then been"]]]
