They as a rule surrendered without any hesitation. We disarmed  them and told them to walk back toward Ana. Several times we had short  engagements with Turkish cavalry. As a general thing the ground was so  very broken up that it was impossible to manoeuvre. I was riding a good  deal of the time in the Ford tender that we had brought along with a few  supplies, and when one of the tires blew out I waited behind to replace  it. The armored cars had quite a start and we raced along to catch them.  In my hurry I failed to notice that they had left the road in pursuit of a  troop of cavalry, so when we sighted a large square building of the sort  the Turks use as barracks, I made sure that the cars had been there before  me. We drove up to the door and I jumped out and shoved it open. In the  yard were some infantry and a few cavalry. I had only my stick--my Webley  revolver was still in its holster. There was nothing to do but put on a  bold front, so I shouted in Arabic to the man I took to be the officer in  command, telling him to surrender, and trying to act as if our forces were  just outside. I think he must have been more surprised than I was, for he  did so immediately, turning over the post to me. Eldridge, the Ford  driver, had succeeded in disengaging the rifle that he had strapped in  beside him, and we made the rounds under the escort of our captive.    One wing of the post was used as a hospital, under the charge of an  intelligent little Armenian. He seemed well informed about the war, and  asked the question that was the universal wail of all the Armenians we  encountered: \"When would Great Britain free their country, and would she  make it an independent state?\" There was a definite limit to the number of  prisoners we could manage to carry back, but I offered the doctor to  include him. His answer was to go to his trunk and produce a picture of  his wife and little daughter. They were, he told me, in Constantinople,  and it was now two years since he had had leave, so that as his turn was  due, he would wait on the chance of seeing his family.    When the cars came up we set off again in pursuit of the elusive gold  convoy. We could get no accurate information concerning it. Some said it  was behind, others ahead. We never ran it down. It may well be that it was  concealed in a ravine near the road a few yards from where we passed. Just  short of a town called Abu Kemal we caught three Germans. They were in  terror when we took them, and afterward said that they had expected to be  shot. Under decent treatment they soon became so insolent that they had to  be brought up short.    [Illustration: A \"Red Crescent\" ambulance]    During the run back to Ana we picked up the more important of our  prisoners and took them with us. Twenty-two were all we could manage. I  was running one of the big cars. It was always a surprise to see how easy  they were to handle in spite of the weight of the armor-plate. We each  took great pride in the car in which we generally rode. All had names. In  the Fourteenth one section had \"Silver Dart\" and \"Silver Ghost\" and  another \"Gray Terror\" and \"Gray Knight.\" The car in which I rode a  great deal of the time met its fate only a few days before the armistice,  long after I had gone to France. Two direct hits from an Austrian  \"eighty-eight\" ended its career.    It was after midnight when we got back to our camp in a palm-garden in  Ana. Although we had not succeeded in capturing the gold convoy, we had  brought in a number of valuable prisoners, and among other things I had  found some papers belonging to a German political agent whom we had  captured. These contained much information about the Arab situation, and  through them it was all but proved that the German was the direct  instigator of the murder of the political officer at Nejef. An amusing  sidelight was thrown in the letters addressed by Arab sheiks through this  agent to the Kaiser thanking him for the iron crosses they had been  awarded. There must have been an underlying grim humor in distributing  crosses to the Mohammedan Arabs in recognition of their efforts to  withstand the advance into the Holy Land of the Christian invaders.    On our arrival at Ana we were told that orders had come through that the  town be evacuated on the following morning. Preparations were made to  blow up the ammunition dump, which was fortunately concentrated in a  series of buildings that joined each other. We warned the inhabitants and  advised them to hide in the caves along the hillsides. We ourselves went  back to the camp which we had occupied near the bridge the night before  entering Ana. During the afternoon Major Edye, a political officer, turned  up, travelling alone with an Arab attendant. He pitched his camp,  consisting of a saddle and blanket, close beside us. He was an  extraordinarily interesting man, with a great gift for languages. In the  course of a year or so's wandering in Abyssinia he had learned both  ancient and modern Abyssinian. There was a famous German Orientalist with  whom he corresponded in the pre-war days. He had mailed him a letter just  at the outbreak, which, written in ancient Abyssinian, must have been a  good deal of a puzzle to the censors.    The main explosion, taking place at the appointed time, was succeeded by  smaller ones, which continued at gradually lengthening intervals  throughout the night. General Cassels, who had commanded the cavalry  brigade so ably throughout the advance, wished to return to Ana on the  following morning in order to check up the thoroughness with which the  dump had been destroyed. He took an escort of armored cars, and as I was  the only one in the batteries who could speak Arabic, my services were  requisitioned. As we approached the town the rattle of the small-arms  ammunition sounded like a Fourth of July celebration. The general noticed  that I had a kodak and asked me to go out into the dump and take some  photographs. There was nothing to do but put on a bold front, but I have  spent happier moments than those in which I edged my way gingerly over the  smoking heaps to a ruined wall from which I could get a good view for my  camera. As I came back a large shell exploded and we hastily moved the  cars farther away.    I went to the mayor's house to find out how the town had fared. He was a  solemn old Arab, and showed me the damage done by the shells with an  absolutely expressionless face. The houses within a fair radius had been  riddled, but the natives had taken our warning and no one had been killed.  After a cup of coffee in a lovely garden on the river-bank, I came back  to the cars and we ran on through to Haditha. Here we were to remain for a  week or ten days to permit the evacuation of the captured supplies.    Thus far we had been having good luck with the weather, but it now began  to threaten rain. We crawled beneath the cars with our blankets and took  such precautions as were possible, but it availed us little when a  veritable hurricane blew up at midnight. I was washed out from under my  car, but before dark I had marked down a deserted hut, and thither I  groped my way. Although it was abandoned by the Arabs, living traces of  their occupancy remained. Still, even that was preferable to the rain, and  the roof proved unexpectedly water-tight.    All next day the storm continued. The Wadi Hauran, a large ravine reaching  back into the desert for a hundred and fifty miles, became a boiling  torrent. When we crossed over, it was as dry as a bone. A heavy lorry on  which an anti-aircraft gun was mounted had been swirled away and smashed  to bits. The ration question had been difficult all along, but now any  further supply was temporarily out of the question.    Oddly enough, I was the only member of the brigade occupying Haditha who  could speak enough Arabic to be of any use, so I was sent to look up the  local mayor to see whether there was any food to be purchased. The town is  built on a long island equidistant from either bank. We ferried across in  barges. The native method was simpler. They inflated goatskins, removed  their clothes, which they had fastened in a bundle on top of their heads,  and with one hand on the goatskin they paddled and drifted over. By  starting from the head of the island they could reach the shore opposite  the down-stream end. The bobbing heads of the dignified old graybeards of  the community looked most ludicrous. On landing they would solemnly don  their clothes, deflate the skins, and go their way.    The mayor proved both intelligent and agreeable. The food situation was  such that it was obviously impossible for him to offer us any serious  help. We held a conclave in the guest-house, sitting cross-legged among  the cushions. In the centre a servant roasted coffee-beans on the large  shovel-spoon that they use for that purpose. The representative village  worthies impressed me greatly. The desert Arabs are always held to be  vastly superior to their kinsmen of the town, and it is undoubtedly true  as a general rule; nevertheless, the elders of Haditha were an unusually  fine group of men. We got a few eggs, which were a most desirable luxury  after a steady diet of black unsweetened tea and canned beef. We happened  to have a sufficient supply of tea to permit us to make an appreciated  gift to the village.    My shoes had collapsed a few days before and I borrowed a pair from a Turk  who had no further use for them. These were several sizes too large and  fashioned in an oblong shape of mathematical exactness. Even in the motor  machine-gun service, there is little that exceeds one's shoes in  importance, and I was looking forward with almost equal eagerness to a  square meal and a pair of my own shoes. The supply of reading-matter had  fallen very low. I had only Disraeli's _Tancred_,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13670"],[0,"The Happy Family (#14)"],[1,"commands. Andy had jumped through blazing hoops and over  sagging bunting while he rode--and he was just a trifle ashamed of the  fact. Also--though it does not particularly matter--he had, later in  the performance, gone hurtling around the big tent dressed in the garb  of an ancient Roman and driving four deep-chested bays abreast. As has  been explained, he never boasted of his circus experience; though his  days in spangled tights probably had much to do with the inimitable  grace of him in the saddle. The Happy Family felt to a man that Andy  would win the purse and add honor to the Flying U in the winning. They  were enthusiastic over the prospect and willing to bet all they had on  the outcome.           *       *       *       *       *    The Happy Family, together with the aliens who swelled the crew to  round-up size, was foregathered at the largest Flying U corral,  watching a bunch of newly bought horses circle, with much snorting and  kicking up of dust, inside the fence. It was the interval between  beef-and calf-roundups, and the witchery of Indian Summer held the  range-land in thrall.    Andy, sizing up the bunch and the brands, lighted upon a rangy blue  roan that he knew--or thought he knew, and the eyes of him brightened  with desire. If he could get that roan in his string, he told himself,  he could go to sleep in the saddle on night-guard; for an easier horse  to ride he never had straddled. It was like sitting in grandma's pet  rocking chair when that roan loosened his muscles for a long, tireless  gallop over the prairie sod, and as a stayer Andy had never seen his  equal. It was not his turn to choose, however, and he held his breath  lest the rope of another should settle over the slatey-black ears  ahead of him.    Cal Emmett roped a plump little black and led him out, grinning  satisfaction; from the white saddle-marks back of the withers he knew  him for a \"broke\" horse, and he certainly was pretty to look at. Andy  gave him but a fleeting glance.    Happy Jack spread his loop and climbed down from the fence, almost at  Andy's elbow. It was his turn to choose. \"I betche that there blue  roan over there is a good one,\" he remarked. \"I'm going to tackle  him.\"    Andy took his cigarette from between his lips. \"Yuh better hobble your  stirrups, then,\" he discouraged artfully. \"I know that roan a heap  better than you do.\"    \"Aw, gwan!\" Happy, nevertheless, hesitated. \"He's got a kind eye in  his head; yuh can always go by a horse's eye.\"    \"Can yuh?\" Andy smiled indifferently. \"Go after him, then. And say,  Happy: if yuh ride that blue roan for five successive minutes, I'll  give yuh fifty dollars. I knew that hoss down on the Musselshell; he's  got a record that'd reach from here to Dry Lake and back.\" It was a  bluff, pure and simple, born of his covetousness, but it had the  desired effect--or nearly so.    Happy fumbled his rope and eyed the roan. \"Aw, I betche you're just  lying,\" he hazarded; but, like many another, when he did strike the  truth he failed to recognize it. \"I betche--\"    \"All right, rope him out and climb on, if yuh don't believe me.\" The  tone of Andy was tinged with injury. \"There's fifty dollars--yes, by  gracious, I'll give yuh a _hundred_ dollars if yuh ride him for five  minutes straight.\"    A conversation of that character, carried on near the top of two  full-lunged voices, never fails in the range land to bring an audience  of every male human within hearing. All other conversations and  interests were immediately suspended, and a dozen men trotted up to  see what it was all about. Andy remained roosting upon the top rail,  his rope coiled loosely and dangling from one arm while he smoked  imperturbably.    \"Oh, Happy was going to rope out a sure-enough bad one for his night  hoss, and out uh the goodness uh my heart, I put him wise to what he  was going up against,\" he explained carelessly.    \"He acts like he has some thoughts uh doubting my word, so I just  offered him a hundred dollars to ride him--that blue roan, over there  next that crooked post. GET_ a reserved seat right in front of the  grand stand where all the big acts take_ PLACE;\" he sung out suddenly,  in the regulation circus tone. \"GET-a-seat-right-in-front-where-Happy-Jack-  the-WILD-Man-rides-the-BUCKING-BRONCHO--Go on, Happy. Don't keep the  audience waiting. Aren't yuh going to earn that hundred dollars?\"    Happy Jack turned half a shade redder than was natural. \"Aw, gwan. I  never said I was going to do no broncho-busting ack. But I betche yuh  never seen that roan before he was unloaded in Dry Lake.\"    \"What'll yuh bet I don't know that hoss from a yearling colt?\" Andy  challenged, and Happy Jack walked away without replying, and cast his  loop sullenly over the first horse he came to--which was _not_ the  roan.    Chip, coming up to hear the last of it, turned and looked long at the  horse in question; a mild-mannered horse, standing by a crooked corral  post and flicking his ears at the flies. \"Do you know that roan?\" he  asked Andy, in the tone which brings truthful answer. Andy had one  good point: he never lied except in an irresponsible mood of pure  deviltry. For instance, he never had lied seriously, to an employer.    \"Sure, I know that hoss,\" he answered truthfully.    \"Did you ever ride him?\"    \"No,\" Andy admitted, still truthfully. \"I never rode him but once  myself, but I worked right with a Lazy 6 rep that had him in his  string, down at the U up-and-down, two years ago. I know the hoss, all  right; but I did lie when I told Happy I knowed him from a colt. I  spread it on a little bit thick, there.\" He smiled engagingly down at  Chip.    \"And he's a bad one, is he?\" Chip queried Over his shoulder, just as  he was about to walk away.    \"Well,\" Andy prevaricated--still clinging to the letter, if not to the  spirit of truth. \"He ain't a hoss I'd like to see Happy Jack go up  against. I ain't saying, though, that he can't be _rode_. I don't say  that about _any_ hoss.\"    \"Is he any worse than Glory, when Glory is feeling peevish?\" Weary  asked, when Chip was gone and while the men still lingered. Andy,  glancing to make sure that Chip was out of hearing, threw away his  cigarette and yielded to temptation. \"Glory?\" he snorted with a fine  contempt. \"Why, Glory's--a--_lamb_ beside that blue roan! Why, that  hoss throwed Buckskin Jimmy clean out of a corral--Did yuh ever see  Buckskin Jimmy ride? Well, say, yuh missed a pretty sight, then;  Jimmy's a sure-enough rider. About the only animal he ever failed to  connect with for keeps, is that same cow-backed hoss yuh see over  there. Happy says he's got a kind eye in his head--\" Andy stopped and  laughed till they all laughed with him. \"By gracious, Happy ought to  step up _on_ him, once, and see how _kind_ he is!\" He laughed again  until Happy, across the corral saddling the horse he had chosen,  muttered profanely at the derision he knew was pointed at himself.    \"Why, I've seen that hoss--\" Andy Green, once fairly started in the  fascinating path of romance, invented details for the pure joy of  creation. If he had written some of the tales he told, and had sold  the writing for many dollars, he would have been famous. Since he did  not write them for profit, but told them for fun, instead, he earned  merely the reputation of being a great liar. A significant mark of his  genius lay in the fact that his inventions never failed to convince;  not till afterward did his audience doubt.    That is why the blue roan was not chosen in any of the strings, but  was left always circling in the corral after a loop had settled. That  is why the Flying U boys looked at him askance as they passed him by.  That is why, when a certain Mr. Coleman, sent by the board of  directors to rake northern Montana for bad horses, looked with favor  upon the blue roan when he came to the Flying U ranch and heard the  tale of his exploits as interpreted--I should say created--by Andy  Green.    \"We've got to have him,\" he declared enthusiastically. \"If he's as bad  as all that, he'll be the star performer at the contest, and make that  two-hundred-dollar plum a hard one to pick. Some of these gay boys  have entered with the erroneous idea that that same plum is hanging  loose, and all they've got to do is lean up against the tree and it'll  drop in their mouths. We've got to have that roan. I'll pay you a good  price for him, Whitmore, if you won't let him go any other way. We've  got a reporter up there that can do him up brown in a special article,  and people will come in bunches to see a horse with that kind of a  pedigree. Is it Green, here, that knows the horse and what he'll do?  You're sure of him, are you, Green?\"    Andy took time to roll a cigarette. He had not expected any such  development as this, and he needed to think of the best way out. All  he had wanted or intended was to discourage the others from claiming  the blue roan; he wanted him in his own string. Afterwards, when they  had pestered him about the roan's record, he admitted to himself that  he had, maybe, overshot the mark and told it a bit too scarey, and too  convincingly. Under the spell of fancy he had done more than make the  roan unpopular as a roundup horse; he had made him a celebrity in the  way of outlaw horses. And they wanted him in the rough-riding contest!  Andy, perhaps, had never before been placed in just such a position.    \"Are you sure of what the horse will do?\" Mr. Coleman repeated, seeing  that Andy was taking a long time to reply.    Andy licked his cigarette, twisted an end and leaned backward while he  felt in his pocket for a match. From the look of his face you never  could have told how very uncomfortable he felt \"Naw,\" he drawled. \"I  ain't never sure of what _any_ hoss will do. I've had too much  dealings with 'em for any uh that brand uh foolishness.\" He lighted  the cigarette as if that were the only matter in which he took"]]]
