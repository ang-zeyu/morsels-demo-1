But elsewhere now l bid thee turn thy view;  So shalt thou many a famous spirit behold.\"  Mine eyes directing, as she will'd, I saw  A hundred little spheres, that fairer grew  By interchange of splendour.  I remain'd,  As one, who fearful of o'er-much presuming,  Abates in him the keenness of desire,  Nor dares to question, when amid those pearls,  One largest and most lustrous onward drew,  That it might yield contentment to my wish;  And from within it these the sounds I heard.    \"If thou, like me, beheldst the charity  That burns amongst us, what thy mind conceives,  Were utter'd.  But that, ere the lofty bound  Thou reach, expectance may not weary thee,  I will make answer even to the thought,  Which thou hast such respect of.  In old days,  That mountain, at whose side Cassino rests,  Was on its height frequented by a race  Deceived and ill dispos'd: and I it was,  Who thither carried first the name of Him,  Who brought the soul-subliming truth to man.  And such a speeding grace shone over me,  That from their impious worship I reclaim'd  The dwellers round about, who with the world  Were in delusion lost.  These other flames,  The spirits of men contemplative, were all  Enliven'd by that warmth, whose kindly force  Gives birth to flowers and fruits of holiness.  Here is Macarius; Romoaldo here:  And here my brethren, who their steps refrain'd  Within the cloisters, and held firm their heart.\"    I answ'ring, thus; \"Thy gentle words and kind,  And this the cheerful semblance, I behold  Not unobservant, beaming in ye all,  Have rais'd assurance in me, wakening it  Full-blossom'd in my bosom, as a rose  Before the sun, when the consummate flower  Has spread to utmost amplitude.  Of thee  Therefore entreat I, father! to declare  If I may gain such favour, as to gaze  Upon thine image, by no covering veil'd.\"    \"Brother!\"  he thus rejoin'd, \"in the last sphere  Expect completion of thy lofty aim,  For there on each desire completion waits,  And there on mine: where every aim is found  Perfect, entire, and for fulfillment ripe.  There all things are as they have ever been:  For space is none to bound, nor pole divides,  Our ladder reaches even to that clime,  And so at giddy distance mocks thy view.  Thither the Patriarch Jacob saw it stretch  Its topmost round, when it appear'd to him  With angels laden.  But to mount it now  None lifts his foot from earth: and hence my rule  Is left a profitless stain upon the leaves;  The walls, for abbey rear'd, turned into dens,  The cowls to sacks choak'd up with musty meal.  Foul usury doth not more lift itself  Against God's pleasure, than that fruit which makes  The hearts of monks so wanton: for whate'er  Is in the church's keeping, all pertains.  To such, as sue for heav'n's sweet sake, and not  To those who in respect of kindred claim,  Or on more vile allowance.  Mortal flesh  Is grown so dainty, good beginnings last not  From the oak's birth, unto the acorn's setting.  His convent Peter founded without gold  Or silver; I with pray'rs and fasting mine;  And Francis his in meek humility.  And if thou note the point, whence each proceeds,  Then look what it hath err'd to, thou shalt find  The white grown murky.  Jordan was turn'd back;  And a less wonder, then the refluent sea,  May at God's pleasure work amendment here.\"    So saying, to his assembly back he drew:  And they together cluster'd into one,  Then all roll'd upward like an eddying wind.    The sweet dame beckon'd me to follow them:  And, by that influence only, so prevail'd  Over my nature, that no natural motion,  Ascending or descending here below,  Had, as I mounted, with my pennon vied.    So, reader, as my hope is to return  Unto the holy triumph, for the which  I ofttimes wail my sins, and smite my breast,  Thou hadst been longer drawing out and thrusting  Thy finger in the fire, than I was, ere  The sign, that followeth Taurus, I beheld,  And enter'd its precinct.  O glorious stars!  O light impregnate with exceeding virtue!  To whom whate'er of genius lifteth me  Above the vulgar, grateful I refer;  With ye the parent of all mortal life  Arose and set, when I did first inhale  The Tuscan air; and afterward, when grace  Vouchsaf'd me entrance to the lofty wheel  That in its orb impels ye, fate decreed  My passage at your clime.  To you my soul  Devoutly sighs, for virtue even now  To meet the hard emprize that draws me on.    \"Thou art so near the sum of blessedness,\"  Said Beatrice, \"that behooves thy ken  Be vigilant and clear.  And, to this end,  Or even thou advance thee further, hence  Look downward, and contemplate, what a world  Already stretched under our feet there lies:  So as thy heart may, in its blithest mood,  Present itself to the triumphal throng,  Which through the' etherial concave comes rejoicing.\"    I straight obey'd; and with mine eye return'd  Through all the seven spheres, and saw this globe  So pitiful of semblance, that perforce  It moved my smiles: and him in truth I hold  For wisest, who esteems it least: whose thoughts  Elsewhere are fix'd, him worthiest call and best.  I saw the daughter of Latona shine  Without the shadow, whereof late I deem'd  That dense and rare were cause.  Here I sustain'd  The visage, Hyperion! of thy sun;  And mark'd, how near him with their circle, round  Move Maia and Dione; here discern'd  Jove's tempering 'twixt his sire and son; and hence  Their changes and their various aspects  Distinctly scann'd.  Nor might I not descry  Of all the seven, how bulky each, how swift;  Nor of their several distances not learn.  This petty area (o'er the which we stride  So fiercely), as along the eternal twins  I wound my way, appear'd before me all,  Forth from the havens stretch'd unto the hills.  Then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes return'd.          CANTO XXIII    E'en as the bird, who midst the leafy bower  Has, in her nest, sat darkling through the night,  With her sweet brood, impatient to descry  Their wished looks, and to bring home their food,  In the fond quest unconscious of her toil:  She, of the time prevenient, on the spray,  That overhangs their couch, with wakeful gaze  Expects the sun; nor ever, till the dawn,  Removeth from the east her eager ken;  So stood the dame erect, and bent her glance  Wistfully on that region, where the sun  Abateth most his speed; that, seeing her  Suspense and wand'ring, I became as one,  In whom desire is waken'd, and the hope  Of somewhat new to come fills with delight.    Short space ensued; I was not held, I say,  Long in expectance, when I saw the heav'n  Wax more and more resplendent; and, \"Behold,\"  Cried Beatrice, \"the triumphal hosts  Of Christ, and all the harvest reap'd at length  Of thy ascending up these spheres.\"  Meseem'd,  That, while she spake her image all did burn,  And in her eyes such fullness was of joy,  And I am fain to pass unconstrued by.    As in the calm full moon, when Trivia smiles,  In peerless beauty, 'mid th' eternal nympus,  That paint through all its gulfs the blue profound  In bright pre-eminence so saw I there,  O'er million lamps a sun, from whom all drew  Their radiance as from ours the starry train:  And through the living light so lustrous glow'd  The substance, that my ken endur'd it not.    O Beatrice! sweet and precious guide!  Who cheer'd me with her comfortable words!  \"Against the virtue, that o'erpow'reth thee,  Avails not to resist.  Here is the might,  And here the wisdom, which did open lay  The path, that had been yearned for so long,  Betwixt the heav'n and earth.\"  Like to the fire,  That, in a cloud imprison'd doth break out  Expansive, so that from its womb enlarg'd,  It falleth against nature to the ground;  Thus in that heav'nly banqueting my soul  Outgrew herself; and, in the transport lost.  Holds now remembrance none of what she was.    \"Ope thou thine eyes, and mark me: thou hast seen  Things, that empower thee to sustain my smile.\"    I was as one, when a forgotten dream  Doth come across him, and he strives in vain  To shape it in his fantasy again,  Whenas that gracious boon was proffer'd me,  Which never may be cancel'd from the book,  Wherein the past is written.  Now were all  Those tongues to sound, that have on sweetest milk  Of Polyhymnia and her sisters fed  And fatten'd, not with all their help to boot,  Unto the thousandth parcel of the truth,  My song might shadow forth that saintly smile,  flow merely in her saintly looks it wrought.  And with such figuring of Paradise  The sacred strain must leap, like one, that meets  A sudden interruption to his road.  But he, who thinks how ponderous the theme,  And that 't is lain upon a mortal shoulder,  May pardon, if it tremble with the burden.  The track, our ventrous keel must furrow, brooks  No unribb'd pinnace, no self-sparing pilot.    \"Why doth my face,\" said Beatrice, \"thus  Enamour thee, as that thou dost not turn  Unto the beautiful garden, blossoming  Beneath the rays of Christ?  Here is the rose,  Wherein the word divine was made incarnate;  And here the lilies, by whose odour known  The way of life was follow'd.\"  Prompt I heard  Her bidding, and encounter once again  The strife of aching vision.  As erewhile,  Through glance of sunlight, stream'd through broken cloud,  Mine eyes a flower-besprinkled mead have seen,  Though veil'd themselves in shade; so saw I there  Legions of splendours, on whom burning rays  Shed lightnings from above, yet saw I not  The fountain whence they flow'd.  O gracious virtue!  Thou, whose broad stamp is on them, higher up  Thou didst exalt thy glory to give room  To my o'erlabour'd sight: when at the name  Of that fair flower, whom duly I invoke  Both morn and eve, my soul, with all her might  Collected, on the goodliest ardour fix'd.  And, as the bright dimensions of the star  In heav'n excelling, as once here on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1008"],[0,"Divine Comedy, Cary's Translation, Complete (#14)"],[1," mouse had fall'n:  but Barbariccia cried,  Seizing him with both arms:  \"Stand thou apart,  While I do fix him on my prong transpierc'd.\"  Then added, turning to my guide his face,  \"Inquire of him, if more thou wish to learn,  Ere he again be rent.\"  My leader thus:  \"Then tell us of the partners in thy guilt;  Knowest thou any sprung of Latian land  Under the tar?\"--\"I parted,\" he replied,  \"But now from one, who sojourn'd not far thence;  So were I under shelter now with him!  Nor hook nor talon then should scare me more.\"--.       \"Too long we suffer,\" Libicocco cried,  Then, darting forth a prong, seiz'd on his arm,  And mangled bore away the sinewy part.  Him Draghinazzo by his thighs beneath  Would next have caught, whence angrily their chief,  Turning on all sides round, with threat'ning brow  Restrain'd them.  When their strife a little ceas'd,  Of him, who yet was gazing on his wound,  My teacher thus without delay inquir'd:  \"Who was the spirit, from whom by evil hap  Parting, as thou has told, thou cam'st to shore?\"--       \"It was the friar Gomita,\" he rejoin'd,  \"He of Gallura, vessel of all guile,  Who had his master's enemies in hand,  And us'd them so that they commend him well.  Money he took, and them at large dismiss'd.  So he reports:  and in each other charge  Committed to his keeping, play'd the part  Of barterer to the height:   with him doth herd  The chief of Logodoro, Michel Zanche.  Sardinia is a theme, whereof their tongue  Is never weary.  Out! alas! behold  That other, how he grins!  More would I say,  But tremble lest he mean to maul me sore.\"       Their captain then to Farfarello turning,  Who roll'd his moony eyes in act to strike,  Rebuk'd him thus:  \"Off! cursed bird! Avaunt!\"--       \"If ye desire to see or hear,\" he thus  Quaking with dread resum'd, \"or Tuscan spirits  Or Lombard, I will cause them to appear.  Meantime let these ill talons bate their fury,  So that no vengeance they may fear from them,  And I, remaining in this self-same place,  Will for myself but one, make sev'n appear,  When my shrill whistle shall be heard; for so  Our custom is to call each other up.\"       Cagnazzo at that word deriding grinn'd,  Then wagg'd the head and spake:  \"Hear his device,  Mischievous as he is, to plunge him down.\"       Whereto he thus, who fail'd not in rich store  Of nice-wove toils; \" Mischief forsooth extreme,  Meant only to procure myself more woe!\"       No longer Alichino then refrain'd,  But thus, the rest gainsaying, him bespake:  \"If thou do cast thee down, I not on foot  Will chase thee, but above the pitch will beat  My plumes.  Quit we the vantage ground, and let  The bank be as a shield, that we may see  If singly thou prevail against us all.\"       Now, reader, of new sport expect to hear!       They each one turn'd his eyes to the' other shore,  He first, who was the hardest to persuade.  The spirit of Navarre chose well his time,  Planted his feet on land, and at one leap  Escaping disappointed their resolve.       Them quick resentment stung, but him the most,  Who was the cause of failure; in pursuit  He therefore sped, exclaiming;  \"Thou art caught.\"       But little it avail'd:  terror outstripp'd  His following flight:  the other plung'd beneath,  And he with upward pinion rais'd his breast:  E'en thus the water-fowl, when she perceives  The falcon near, dives instant down, while he  Enrag'd and spent retires.  That mockery  In Calcabrina fury stirr'd, who flew  After him, with desire of strife inflam'd;  And, for the barterer had 'scap'd, so turn'd  His talons on his comrade. O'er the dyke  In grapple close they join'd; but the' other prov'd  A goshawk able to rend well his foe;  And in the boiling lake both fell.  The heat  Was umpire soon between them, but in vain  To lift themselves they strove, so fast were glued  Their pennons.  Barbariccia, as the rest,  That chance lamenting, four in flight dispatch'd  From the' other coast, with all their weapons arm'd.  They, to their post on each side speedily  Descending, stretch'd their hooks toward the fiends,  Who flounder'd, inly burning from their scars:  And we departing left them to that broil.        CANTO XXIII    IN silence and in solitude we went,  One first, the other following his steps,  As minor friars journeying on their road.       The present fray had turn'd my thoughts to muse  Upon old Aesop's fable, where he told  What fate unto the mouse and frog befell.  For language hath not sounds more like in sense,  Than are these chances, if the origin  And end of each be heedfully compar'd.  And as one thought bursts from another forth,  So afterward from that another sprang,  Which added doubly to my former fear.  For thus I reason'd:  \"These through us have been  So foil'd, with loss and mock'ry so complete,  As needs must sting them sore.  If anger then  Be to their evil will conjoin'd, more fell  They shall pursue us, than the savage hound  Snatches the leveret, panting 'twixt his jaws.\"       Already I perceiv'd my hair stand all  On end with terror, and look'd eager back.       \"Teacher,\" I thus began, \"if speedily  Thyself and me thou hide not, much I dread  Those evil talons.  Even now behind  They urge us:  quick imagination works  So forcibly, that I already feel them.''       He answer'd:  \"Were I form'd of leaded glass,  I should not sooner draw unto myself  Thy outward image, than I now imprint  That from within.  This moment came thy thoughts  Presented before mine, with similar act  And count'nance similar, so that from both  I one design have fram'd.  If the right coast  Incline so much, that we may thence descend  Into the other chasm, we shall escape  Secure from this imagined pursuit.\"       He had not spoke his purpose to the end,  When I from far beheld them with spread wings  Approach to take us.  Suddenly my guide  Caught me, ev'n as a mother that from sleep  Is by the noise arous'd, and near her sees  The climbing fires, who snatches up her babe  And flies ne'er pausing, careful more of him  Than of herself, that but a single vest  Clings round her limbs.  Down from the jutting beach  Supine he cast him, to that pendent rock,  Which closes on one part the other chasm.       Never ran water with such hurrying pace  Adown the tube to turn a landmill's wheel,  When nearest it approaches to the spokes,  As then along that edge my master ran,  Carrying me in his bosom, as a child,  Not a companion.  Scarcely had his feet  Reach'd to the lowest of the bed beneath,  When over us the steep they reach'd; but fear  In him was none; for that high Providence,  Which plac'd them ministers of the fifth foss,  Power of departing thence took from them all.       There in the depth we saw a painted tribe,  Who pac'd with tardy steps around, and wept,  Faint in appearance and o'ercome with toil.  Caps had they on, with hoods, that fell low down  Before their eyes, in fashion like to those  Worn by the monks in Cologne.  Their outside  Was overlaid with gold, dazzling to view,  But leaden all within, and of such weight,  That Frederick's compar'd to these were straw.  Oh, everlasting wearisome attire!       We yet once more with them together turn'd  To leftward, on their dismal moan intent.  But by the weight oppress'd, so slowly came  The fainting people, that our company  Was chang'd at every movement of the step.       Whence I my guide address'd:  \"See that thou find  Some spirit, whose name may by his deeds be known,  And to that end look round thee as thou go'st.\"       Then one, who understood the Tuscan voice,  Cried after us aloud:  \"Hold in your feet,  Ye who so swiftly speed through the dusk air.  Perchance from me thou shalt obtain thy wish.\"       Whereat my leader, turning, me bespake:  \"Pause, and then onward at their pace proceed.\"       I staid, and saw two Spirits in whose look  Impatient eagerness of mind was mark'd  To overtake me; but the load they bare  And narrow path retarded their approach.       Soon as arriv'd, they with an eye askance  Perus'd me, but spake not: then turning each  To other thus conferring said:  \"This one  Seems, by the action of his throat, alive.  And, be they dead, what privilege allows  They walk unmantled by the cumbrous stole?\"       Then thus to me:  \"Tuscan, who visitest  The college of the mourning hypocrites,  Disdain not to instruct us who thou art.\"       \"By Arno's pleasant stream,\" I thus replied,  \"In the great city I was bred and grew,  And wear the body I have ever worn.  but who are ye, from whom such mighty grief,  As now I witness, courseth down your cheeks?  What torment breaks forth in this bitter woe?\"  \"Our bonnets gleaming bright with orange hue,\"  One of them answer'd, \"are so leaden gross,  That with their weight they make the balances  To crack beneath them.  Joyous friars we were,  Bologna's natives, Catalano I,  He Loderingo nam'd, and by thy land  Together taken, as men used to take  A single and indifferent arbiter,  To reconcile their strifes.  How there we sped,  Gardingo's vicinage can best declare.\"       \"O friars!\"  I began, \"your miseries--\"  But there brake off, for one had caught my eye,  Fix'd to a cross with three stakes on the ground:  He, when he saw me, writh'd himself, throughout  Distorted, ruffling with deep sighs his beard.  And Catalano, who thereof was 'ware,  Thus spake:  \"That pierced spirit, whom intent  Thou view'st, was he who gave the Pharisees  Counsel, that it were fitting for one man  To suffer for the people.  He doth lie  Transverse; nor any passes, but him first  Behoves make feeling trial how each weighs.  In straits like this along the foss are plac'd  The father of his consort, and the rest  Partakers in that council, seed of ill  And sorrow to the Jews.\"  I noted then,  How Virgil gaz'd with wonder upon him,  Thus abjectly extended on the cross  In banishment eternal.  To the friar  He next his words address'd:  \"We pray ye tell,  If so be lawful, whether on our right  Lies"]]]
