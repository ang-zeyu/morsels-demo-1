Seven years have I been  waiting, and no one has come to milk me.\" But the girl said, \"No, I  can't milk you, I'm in a hurry,\" and went on faster. Then she came to  the apple-tree, and the apple-tree asked her to help shake the fruit.  \"No, I can't; another day p'raps I may,\" and went on till she came to  the witch's house. Well, it happened to her just the same as to the  other girl--she forgot what she was told, and one day when the witch was  out, looked up the chimney, and down fell a bag of money. Well, she  thought she would be off at once. When she reached the apple-tree, she  heard the witch coming after her, and she cried:         \"Apple-tree, apple-tree, hide me,        So the old witch can't find me;        If she does she'll break my bones,        And bury me under the marble stones.\"    But the tree didn't answer, and she ran on further. Presently the witch  came up and said:         \"Tree of mine, tree of mine,        Have you seen a girl,        With a willy-willy wag, and a long-tailed bag,        Who's stole my money, all I had?\"    The tree said, \"Yes, mother; she's gone down that way.\"    So the old witch went after her and caught her, she took all the money  away from her, beat her, and sent her off home just as she was.          The Three Wishes      Once upon a time, and be sure 't was a long time ago, there lived a poor  woodman in a great forest, and every day of his life he went out to fell  timber. So one day he started out, and the goodwife filled his wallet  and slung his bottle on his back, that he might have meat and drink in  the forest. He had marked out a huge old oak, which, thought he, would  furnish many and many a good plank. And when he was come to it, he took  his axe in his hand and swung it round his head as though he were minded  to fell the tree at one stroke. But he hadn't given one blow, when what  should he hear but the pitifullest entreating, and there stood before  him a fairy who prayed and beseeched him to spare the tree. He was  dazed, as you may fancy, with wonderment and affright, and he couldn't  open his mouth to utter a word. But he found his tongue at last, and,  \"Well,\" said he, \"I'll e'en do as thou wishest.\"    \"You've done better for yourself than you know,\" answered the fairy,  \"and to show I'm not ungrateful, I'll grant you your next three wishes,  be they what they may.\" And therewith the fairy was no more to be seen,  and the woodman slung his wallet over his shoulder and his bottle at his  side, and off he started home.    But the way was long, and the poor man was regularly dazed with the  wonderful thing that had befallen him, and when he got home there was  nothing in his noddle but the wish to sit down and rest. Maybe, too, 't  was a trick of the fairy's. Who can tell? Anyhow down he sat by the  blazing fire, and as he sat he waxed hungry, though it was a long way  off supper-time yet.    \"Hasn't thou naught for supper, dame?\" said he to his wife.    \"Nay, not for a couple of hours yet,\" said she.    \"Ah!\" groaned the woodman, \"I wish I'd a good link of black pudding here  before me.\"    No sooner had he said the word, when clatter, clatter, rustle, rustle,  what should come down the chimney but a link of the finest black pudding  the heart of man could wish for.    If the woodman stared, the goodwife stared three times as much. \"What's  all this?\" says she.    Then all the morning's work came back to the woodman, and he told his  tale right out, from beginning to end, and as he told it the goodwife  glowered and glowered, and when he had made an end of it she burst out,  \"Thou bee'st but a fool, Jan, thou bee'st but a fool; and I wish the  pudding were at thy nose, I do indeed.\"    And before you could say Jack Robinson, there the goodman sat and his  nose was the longer for a noble link of black pudding.    He gave a pull but it stuck, and she gave a pull but it stuck, and they  both pulled till they had nigh pulled the nose off, but it stuck and  stuck.    \"What's to be done now?\" said he.    \"'T isn't so very unsightly,\" said she, looking hard at him.    Then the woodman saw that if he wished, he must need wish in a hurry;  and wish he did, that the black pudding might come off his nose. Well!  there it lay in a dish on the table, and if the goodman and goodwife  didn't ride in a golden coach, or dress in silk and satin, why, they had  at least as fine a black pudding for their supper as the heart of man  could desire.          The Buried Moon      Long ago, in my grandmother's time, the Carland was all in bogs, great  pools of black water, and creeping trickles of green water, and squishy  mools which squirted when you stepped on them.    Well, granny used to say how long before her time the Moon herself was  once dead and buried in the marshes, and as she used to tell me, I'll  tell you all about it.    The Moon up yonder shone and shone, just as she does now, and when she  shone she lighted up the bog-pools, so that one could walk about almost  as safe as in the day.    But when she didn't shine, out came the Things that dwelt in the  darkness and went about seeking to do evil and harm; Bogles and Crawling  Horrors, all came out when the Moon didn't shine.    Well, the Moon heard of this, and being kind and good--as she surely is,  shining for us in the night instead of taking her natural rest--she was  main troubled. \"I'll see for myself, I will,\" said she, \"maybe it's not  so bad as folks make out.\"    Sure enough, at the month's end down she stept, wrapped up in a black  cloak, and a black hood over her yellow shining hair. Straight she went  to the bog edge and looked about her. Water here and water there; waving  tussocks and trembling mools, and great black snags all twisted and  bent. Before her all was dark--dark but for the glimmer of the stars in  the pools, and the light that came from her own white feet, stealing out  of her black cloak.    The Moon drew her cloak faster about and trembled, but she wouldn't go  back without seeing all there was to be seen; so on she went, stepping  as light as the wind in summer from tuft to tuft between the greedy  gurgling water holes. Just as she came near a big black pool her foot  slipped and she was nigh tumbling in. She grabbed with both hands at a  snag near by to steady herself with, but as she touched it, it twined  itself round her wrists, like a pair of handcuffs, and gript her so that  she couldn't move. She pulled and twisted and fought, but it was no  good. She was fast, and must stay fast.    Presently as she stood trembling in the dark, wondering if help would  come, she heard something calling in the distance, calling, calling, and  then dying away with a sob, till the marshes were full of this pitiful  crying sound; then she heard steps floundering along, squishing in the  mud and slipping on the tufts, and through the darkness she saw a white  face with great feared eyes.    'T was a man strayed in the bogs. Mazed with fear he struggled on toward  the flickering light that looked like help and safety. And when the  poor Moon saw that he was coming nigher and nigher to the deep hole,  further and further from the path, she was so mad and so sorry that she  struggled and fought and pulled harder than ever. And though she  couldn't get loose, she twisted and turned, till her black hood fell  back off her shining yellow hair, and the beautiful light that came from  it drove away the darkness.    Oh, but the man cried with joy to see the light again. And at once all  evil things fled back into the dark corners, for they cannot abide the  light. So he could see where he was, and where the path was, and how he  could get out of the marsh. And he was in such haste to get away from  the Quicks, and Bogles, and Things that dwelt there, that he scarce  looked at the brave light that came from the beautiful shining yellow  hair, streaming out over the black cloak and falling to the water at his  feet. And the Moon herself was so taken up with saving him, and with  rejoicing that he was back on the right path, that she clean forgot that  she needed help herself, and that she was held fast by the Black Snag.    So off he went; spent and gasping, and stumbling and sobbing with joy,  flying for his life out of the terrible bogs. Then it came over the  Moon, she would main like to go with him. So she pulled and fought as if  she were mad, till she fell on her knees, spent with tugging, at the  foot of the snag. And as she lay there, gasping for breath, the black  hood fell forward over her head. So out went the blessed light and back  came the darkness, with all its Evil Things, with a screech and a howl.  They came crowding round her, mocking and snatching and beating;  shrieking with rage and spite, and swearing and snarling, for they knew  her for their old enemy, that drove them back into the corners, and kept  them from working their wicked wills.    \"Drat thee!\" yelled the witch-bodies, \"thou 'st spoiled our spells this  year agone!\"    \"And us thou sent'st to brood in the corners!\" howled the Bogles.    And all the Things joined in with a great \"Ho, ho!\" till the very  tussocks shook and the water gurgled. And they began again.    \"We'll poison her--poison her!\" shrieked the witches.    And \"Ho, ho!\" howled the Things again.    \"We'll smother her--smother her!\" whispered the Crawling Horrors, and  twined themselves round her knees.    And \"Ho, ho!\" mocked the rest of them.    And again they all shouted with spite and ill-will. And the poor Moon  crouched down, and wished she was dead and done with.    And they fought and squabbled what they should do with her, till a pale  grey light began to come in the sky; and it drew nigh the dawning. And  when they saw that, they were feared lest they shouldn't have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14264"],[0,"The Practice and Science of Drawing (#14)"],[1,"ision. The method employed  to do this is somewhat similar to that adopted by a surveyor in drawing  the plan of a field. Assuming he had an irregular shaped one, such as is  drawn in Fig. X, page 87 [Transcribers Note: Diagram IV], he would  proceed to invest it with straight lines, taking advantage of any  straightness in the boundary, noting the length and the angles at which  these straight lines cut each other, and then reproducing them to scale  on his plan. Once having got this scaffolding accurately placed, he can  draw the irregularities of the shape in relation to these lines with  some certainty of getting them right.    You should proceed in very much the same way to block out the spaces  that the forms of your drawing are to occupy. I have produced these  blocking-out lines beyond what was necessary in the accompanying drawing  (page 87 [Transcribers Note: Diagram IV]), in order to show them more  clearly.    [Sidenote: How to observe the Shape of Curves.]    There is yet another method of construction useful in noting accurately  the shape of a curved line, which is illustrated in Fig. Y, page 87  [Transcribers Note: Diagram IV]. First of all, fix the positions of the  extremities of the line by means of the vertical and horizontal. And  also, as this is a double curve, the point at which the curvature  changes from one direction to the other: point C. By drawing lines CA,  CB and noting the distances your curves travel from these straight  lines, and particularly the relative position of the farthest points  reached, their curvature can be accurately observed and copied. In  noting the varying curvature of forms, this construction should always  be in your mind to enable you to observe them accurately. First note the  points at which the curvature begins and ends, and then the distances it  travels from a line joining these two points, holding up a pencil or  knitting-needle against the model if need be.    [Illustration: Plate XVIII.    STUDY ILLUSTRATING METHOD OF DRAWING    Note the different stages. 1st. Centre line and transverse lines for  settling position of salient points. 2nd. Blocking in, as shown in  further leg. 3rd. Drawing in the forms and shading, as shown in front  leg. 4th. Rubbing with fingers (giving a faint middle tone over the  whole), and picking out high lights with bread, as shown on back and  arms.]      [Sidenote: The Drawing proper.]    A drawing being blocked out in such a state as the further leg and foot  of our demonstration drawing (page 90 [Transcribers Note: Plate  XVIII]), it is time to begin the drawing proper. So far you have only  been pegging out the ground it is going to occupy. This initial  scaffolding, so necessary to train the eye, should be done as accurately  as possible, but don't let it interfere with your freedom in expressing  the forms afterwards. The work up to this point has been mechanical, but  it is time to consider the subject with some feeling for form. Here  knowledge of the structure of bones and muscles that underlie the skin  will help you to seize on those things that are significant and express  the form of the figure. And the student cannot do better than study the  excellent book by Sir Alfred D. Fripp on this subject, entitled Human  Anatomy for Art Students. Notice particularly the swing of the action,  such things as the pull occasioned by the arm resting on the farther  thigh, and the prominence given to the forms by the straining of the  skin at the shoulder. Also the firm lines of the bent back and the  crumpled forms of the front of the body. Notice the overlapping of the  contours, and where they are accentuated and where more lost, &c.,  drawing with as much feeling and conviction as you are capable of. You  will have for some time to work tentatively, feeling for the true shapes  that you do not yet rightly see, but as soon as you feel any confidence,  remember it should be your aim to express yourself freely and swiftly.    There is a tendency in some quarters to discourage this blocking in of  the forms in straight lines, and certainly it has been harmful to the  freedom of expression in the work of some students. They not only begin  the drawing with this mechanical blocking in, but continue it in the  same mechanical fashion, cutting up almost all their curves into  flatnesses, and never once breaking free from this scaffolding to  indulge in the enjoyment of free line expression. This, of course, is  bad, and yet the character of a curved line is hardly to be accurately  studied in any other way than by observing its relation to straight  lines. The inclination and length of straight lines can be observed with  certainty. But a curve has not this definiteness, and is a very unstable  thing to set about copying unaided. Who but the highly skilled  draughtsman could attempt to copy our random shape at Fig. X, page 87  [Transcribers Note: Diagram IV], without any guiding straight lines? And  even the highly skilled draughtsman would draw such straight lines  mentally. So that some blocking out of the curved forms, either done  practically or in imagination, must be adopted to rightly observe any  shapes. But do not forget that this is only a scaffolding, and should  always be regarded as such and kicked away as soon as real form  expression with any feeling begins.    But it will be some years before the beginner has got his eye trained  to such accuracy of observation that he can dispense with it.    [Sidenote: In Blocking-in observe Shape of the Background as much as the  Object.]    In the case of foreshortenings, the eye, unaided by this blocking out,  is always apt to be led astray. And here the observation of the shape of  the background against the object will be of great assistance. The  appearance of the foreshortened object is so unlike what you know it to  be as a solid thing, that much as it is as well to concentrate the  attention on the background rather than on the form in this blocking-out  process. And in fact, in blocking out any object, whether foreshortened  or not, the shape of the background should be observed as carefully as  any other shape. But in making the drawing proper, the forms must be  observed in their inner relations. That is to say, the lines bounding  one side of a form must be observed in relation to the lines bounding  the other side; as the true expression of form, which is the object of  drawing, depends on the true relationship of these boundaries. The  drawing of the two sides should be carried on simultaneously, so that  one may constantly compare them.    [Sidenote: Boundaries a series of Overlappings.]    The boundaries of forms with any complexity, such as the human figure,  are not continuous lines. One form overlaps another, like the lines of a  range of hills. And this overlapping should be sought for and carefully  expressed, the outlines being made up of a series of overlappings.    [Sidenote: Shading.]    In Line Drawing shading should only be used to aid the expression of  form. It is not advisable to aim at representing the true tone values.    In direct light it will be observed that a solid object has some  portion of its surface in light, while other portions, those turned away  from the light, are in shadow. Shadows are also cast on the ground and  surrounding objects, called cast shadows. The parts of an object  reflecting the most direct light are called the high lights. If the  object have a shiny surface these lights are clear and distinct; if a  dull surface, soft and diffused. In the case of a very shiny surface,  such as a glazed pot, the light may be reflected so completely that a  picture of the source of light, usually a window, will be seen.    In the diagram on page 95 [Transcribers Note: Diagram V], let A  represent the plan of a cone, B C the opening of a window, and D the eye  of the spectator, and E F G the wall of a room. Light travels in  straight lines from the window, strikes the surface of the cone, and is  reflected to the eye, making the angle of incidence equal to the angle  of reflection, the angle of incidence being that made by the light  striking an object, and the angle of reflection that made by the light  in leaving the surface.    It will be seen that the lines B1D, C2D are the limits of the direct  rays of light that come to the eye from the cone, and that therefore  between points 1 and 2 will be seen the highest light. If the cone have  a perfect reflecting surface, such as a looking-glass has, this would be  all the direct light that would be reflected from the cone to the eye.  But assuming it to have what is called a dull surface, light would be  reflected from other parts also, although not in so great a quantity. If  what is called a dull surface is looked at under a microscope it will be  found to be quite rough, _i.e._ made up of many facets which catch  light at different angles.    [Illustration: Diagram V.    PLAN OF CONE A, LIT BY WINDOW BC; POSITION OF EYE D. ILLUSTRATING  PRINCIPLES OF LIGHT AND SHADE]    Lines B4, C3 represent the extreme limits of light that can be received  by the cone, and therefore at points 3 and 4 the shadow will commence.  The fact that light is reflected to the eye right up to the point 3 does  not upset the theory that it can only be reflected from points where the  angle of incidence can equal the angle of reflection, as it would seem  to do, because the surface being rough presents facets at different  angles, from some of which it can be reflected to the eye right up to  point 3. The number of these facets that can so reflect is naturally  greatest near the high lights, and gets gradually less as the surface  turns more away; until the point is reached where the shadows begin, at  which point the surface positively turns away from the light and the  reflection of direct light ceases altogether. After point 3 there would  be no light coming to the eye from the object, were it not"]]]
