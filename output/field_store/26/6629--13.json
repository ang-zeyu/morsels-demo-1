The old dame who sat behind the stove opposite the clothes-press wore a  flowered dress of some old-fashioned material, which had been the bridal  robe of her departed mother. Her great-grandson, a fair-haired boy, with  flashing eyes, clad in a miner's dress, sat at her feet and counted the  flowers on her dress. It may be that she has narrated to him many a  story connected with that dress--many serious and pretty stories, which  the boy will not readily forget, which will often recur to him when he,  a grown-up man, works alone in the midnight galleries of the \"Caroline,\"  and which he in turn will narrate when the dear grandmother has long  been dead, and he himself, a silver-haired, tranquil old man, sits amid  the circle of _his_ grand-children behind the stove, opposite the great  clothes-press.    I lodged that night too in The Crown, where the Court Councilor B----,  of Goettingen, had arrived meanwhile, and I had the pleasure of paying my  respects to the old gentleman. After writing my name in the book of  arrivals, I turned over the leaves of the month of July and found  therein, among others, the much loved name of Adalbert von Chamisso, the  biographer of the immortal _Schlemihl_. The landlord remarked of  Chamisso that the gentleman had arrived during one terrible storm and  departed in another.    The next morning I had again to lighten my knapsack, and threw overboard  an extra pair of boots; then I arose and went on to Goslar, where I  arrived without knowing how. This much alone do I remember, that I  sauntered up hill and down dale, gazing upon many a lovely meadow vale;  silver waters rippled and murmured, sweet woodbirds sang, the bells of  the flocks tinkled, the many shaded green trees were gilded by the sun,  and, over all, the blue silk canopy of heaven was so transparent that  one could look through the depths even to the Holy of Holies, where  angels sit at the feet of God, studying thorough-bass in the features of  the eternal countenance. But I was all the time lost in a dream of the  previous night, which I could not banish from my thoughts. It was an  echo of the old legend--how a knight descended into a deep fountain  beneath which the fairest princess of the world lay buried in a  deathlike magic slumber. I myself was the knight, and the dark mine of  Clausthal was the fountain. Suddenly innumerable lights gleamed around  me, watchful dwarfs leapt from every cranny in the rocks, grimacing  angrily, cutting at me with their short swords, blowing shrilly on  horns, which summoned more and ever more of their comrades, and  frantically nodding their great heads. But as I hewed them down with my  sword the blood flowed, and I for the first time remarked that they were  not really dwarfs, but the red-blooming, long-bearded thistle-tops,  which I had the day before hewed down on the highway with my stick. At  last they all vanished, and I came to a splendid lighted hall, in the  midst of which stood my heart's loved one, veiled in white, and  immovable as a statue. I kissed her mouth, and then--O Heavens!--I felt  the blessed breath of her soul and the sweet tremor of her lovely lips.  It seemed that I heard the divine command, \"Let there be light!\" and a  dazzling flash of eternal light shot down, but at the same instant it  was again night, and all ran chaotically together into a wild turbulent  sea! A wild turbulent sea, indeed, over whose foaming waves the ghosts  of the departed madly chased one another, their white shrouds floating  in the wind, while behind all, goading them on with cracking whip, ran a  many-colored harlequin--and I was the harlequin! Suddenly from the black  waves the sea monsters raised their misshapen heads, snatched at me with  extended claws, and I awoke in terror.    Alas, how the finest fairy tales may be spoiled! The knight, in fact,  when he has found the sleeping princess, ought to cut a piece from her  priceless veil, and when, by his bravery, she has been awakened from her  magic sleep and is again seated on her golden throne in her palace, the  knight should approach her and say, \"My fairest princess, dost thou not  know me?\" Then she will answer, \"My bravest knight, I know thee not!\"  And then he shows her the piece cut from her veil, exactly fitting the  deficiency, and she knows that he is her deliverer, and both tenderly  embrace, and the trumpets sound, and the marriage is celebrated. It is  really a very peculiar misfortune that _my_ love-dreams so seldom have  so fine a conclusion.    [Illustration: OLD IMPERIAL PALACE, GOSLAR]    The name of Goslar rings so pleasantly, and there are so many very  ancient and imperial associations connected therewith, that I had hoped  to find an imposing and stately town. But it is always the same old  story when we examine celebrities too closely. I found a nest of houses,  drilled in every direction with narrow streets of labyrinthine  crookedness, and amid which a miserable stream, probably the Gose, winds  its sad and muddy way. The pavement of the town is as ragged as Berlin  hexameters. Only the antiquities which are imbedded in the frame or  mounting of the city--that is to say, its remnants of walls, towers, and  battlements--give the place a piquant look. One of these towers, known as  the \"Zwinger,\" or donjonkeep, has walls of such extraordinary thickness  that entire rooms are excavated therein. The open place before the town,  where the world-renowned shooting matches are held, is a beautiful large  plain surrounded by high mountains. The market is small, and in its  midst is a spring fountain, the waters from which pours into a great  metallic basin. When an alarm of fire is raised, they strike several  times on this cup-formed basin, which gives out a very loud vibration.  Nothing is known of the origin of this work. Some say that the devil  placed it once during the night on the spot where it stands. In those  days people were as yet fools, nor was the devil any wiser, and they  mutually exchanged gifts.    The town hall of Goslar is a whitewashed guard-room. The Guildhall, hard  by, has a somewhat better appearance. In this building, equidistant from  roof and ceiling, stands the statues of German emperors. Blackened with  smoke and partly gilded, in one hand the sceptre, and in the other the  globe, they look like roasted college beadles. One of the emperors holds  a sword instead of a sceptre. I cannot imagine the reason of this  variation from the established order, though it has doubtless some  occult signification, as Germans have the remarkable peculiarity of  meaning something in whatever they do.    In Gottschalk's _Handbook_ I had read much of the very ancient  cathedral, and of the far-famed imperial throne at Goslar. But when I  wished to see these curiosities, I was informed that the church had been  torn down, and that the throne had been carried to Berlin. We live in  deeply significant times, when millennial churches are destroyed and  imperial thrones are tumbled into the lumber-room.    A few memorials of the late cathedral of happy memory are still  preserved in the church of St. Stephen. These consist of stained glass  pictures of great beauty, a few indifferent paintings, including a Lucas  Cranach, a wooden Christ crucified, and a heathen altar of some unknown  metal. The latter resembles a long square coffer, and is upheld by  caryatides, which in a bowed position hold their hands above their heads  in support, and are making the most hideous grimaces. But far more  hideous is the adjacent large wooden crucifix of which I have just  spoken. This head of Christ, with its real hair and thorns and  blood-stained countenance, represents, in the most masterly manner, the  death of a _man_--but not of a divinely-born Savior. Nothing but physical  suffering is portrayed in this image--not the sublime poetry of pain.  Such a work would be more appropriately placed in a hall of anatomy than  in a house of the Lord.    The sacristan's wife--an artistic expert--who led me about, showed me a  special rarity. This was a many-cornered, well-planed blackboard covered  with white numerals, which hung like a lamp in the middle of the  building. Oh, how brilliantly does the spirit of invention manifest  itself in the Protestant Church! For who would think it! The numbers on  this board are those of the Psalms for the day, which are generally  chalked on a common black tablet, and have a very sobering effect on an  esthetic mind, but which, in the form above described, even ornament the  church and fully make up for the want of pictures by Raphael. Such  progress delights me infinitely, since I, as a Protestant and a  Lutheran, am ever deeply chagrined when Catholic opponents ridicule the  empty, God-forsaken appearance of Protestant churches.           *       *       *       *       *    The churchyard at Goslar did not appeal to me very strongly, but a  certain very pretty blonde-ringleted head which peeped smilingly from a  parterre window _did_. After dinner I again sought out this fascinating  window, but, instead of a maiden, I beheld a glass containing white  bellflowers. I clambered up, stole the flowers, put them quietly in my  cap, and descended, unheeding the gaping mouths, petrified noses, and  goggle eyes, with which the people in the street, and especially the old  women, regarded this qualified theft. As I, an hour later, passed by the  same house, the beauty stood by the window, and, as she saw the flowers  in my cap, she blushed like a ruby and started back. This time I had  seen the beautiful face to better advantage; it was a sweet, transparent  incarnation of summer-evening breeze, moonshine, nightingale notes, and  rose perfume. Later, in the twilight hour, she was standing at the door.  I came--I drew near--she slowly retreated into the dark entry."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12519"],[0,"The Virginia Housewife; Or, Methodical Cook (#14)"],[1,"wn; dry them a little before the fire, and dish them while quite hot.           *       *       *       *       *    OMELETTE SOUFFLE.    Break six eggs, beat the yelks and whites separately till very light,  then mix them, add four table spoonsful of powdered sugar, and a little  grated lemon peel; put a quarter of a pound of butter in a pan; when  melted, pour in the eggs and stir them; when they have absorbed the  butter, turn it on a plate previously buttered, sprinkle some powdered  sugar, set it in a hot Dutch oven, and when a little brown, serve it up  for a desert.           *       *       *       *       *    FONDUS.    Put a pint of water, and a lump of butter the size of an egg, into a  sauce pan; stir in as much flour as will make a thick batter, put it on  the fire, and stir it continually till it will not stick to the pan; put  it in a bowl, add three quarters of a pound of grated cheese, mix it  well, then break in two eggs, beat them well, then two more until you  put in six; when it looks very light, drop it in small lumps on buttered  paper, bake it in a quick oven till of a delicate brown; you may use  corn meal instead of flour for a change.           *       *       *       *       *    A NICE TWELVE O'CLOCK LUNCHEON.    Cut some slices of bread tolerably thick, and toast them slightly; bone  some anchovies, lay half of one on each toast, cover it well with grated  cheese and chopped parsley mixed; pour a little melted butter on, and  brown it with a salamander; it must be done on the dish you send it to  table in.           *       *       *       *       *    EGGS A-LA-CREME.    Boil twelve eggs just hard enough to allow you to cut them in  slices--cut some crusts of bread very thin, put them in the bottom and  round the sides of a moderately deep dish, place the eggs in, strewing  each layer with the stale bread grated, and some pepper and salt.           *       *       *       *       *    SAUCE A-LA-CREME, FOR THE EGGS.    Put a quarter of a pound of butter, with a large table-spoonful of flour  rubbed well into it in a sauce pan; add some chopped parsley, a little  onion, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and a gill of cream; stir it over the fire  until it begins to boil, then pour it over the eggs, cover the top with  grated bread, set it in a Dutch oven with a heated top, and when a light  brown, send it to table.           *       *       *       *       *    CABBAGE A-LA-CREME.    Take two good heads of cabbage, cut out the stalks, boil it tender, with  a little salt in the water--have ready one large spoonful of butter, and  a small one of flour rubbed into it, half a pint of milk, with pepper  and salt; make it hot, put the cabbage in after pressing out the water,  and stew it till quite tender.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE AN OMELETTE.    Break six or eight eggs in a dish, beat them a little, add parsley and  chives chopped small, with pepper and salt; mix all well together, put a  piece of butter in a pan, let it melt over a clear fire till nearly  brown; pour in the eggs, stir it in, and in a few minutes it will be  done sufficiently; double it, and dish it quite hot.           *       *       *       *       *    OMELETTE--ANOTHER WAY.    Break six eggs, leave out half the whites--beat them with a fork, and  add some salt and chopped parsley; take four ounces of fresh butter, cut  half of it in small pieces, put them in the omelette, put the other half  in a small frying pan; when melted, pour in the eggs; stir till it  begins to set, then turn it up round the edges; when done, put a plate  on and turn the pan up, that it may not break--the omelette must be  thick, and great care must be taken in frying; instead of parsley, you  may use any kind of sweet herb or onion chopped fine, anchovy minced,  rasped beef, ham or tongue.           *       *       *       *       *    GASPACHO--SPANISH    Put some soft biscuit or toasted bread in the bottom of a sallad bowl,  put in a layer of sliced tomatos with the skin taken off, and one of  sliced cucumbers, sprinkled with pepper, salt, and chopped onion; do  this until the bowl is full; stew some tomatos quite soft, strain the  juice, mix in some mustard, oil, and water, and pour over it; make it  two hours before it is eaten.           *       *       *       *       *    EGGS AND TOMATOS.    Peel the skins from a dozen large tomatos, put four ounces of butter in  a frying pan, add some salt, pepper, and a little chopped onion; fry  them a few minutes, add the tomatos, and chop them while frying; when  nearly done, break in six eggs, stir them quickly, and serve them up.           *       *       *       *       *    TO FRICASSEE EGGS.    Boil six eggs for five minutes, lay them in cold water, peel them  carefully, dredge them lightly with flour, beat one egg light, dip the  hard eggs in, roll them in bread crumbs, seasoned with pepper, salt, and  grated nutmeg; cover them well with this, and let them stand some time  to dry--fry them in boiling lard, and serve them up with any kind of  rich, well seasoned gravy, and garnish with crisped parsley.           *       *       *       *       *      SAUCES.      FISH SAUCE, TO KEEP A YEAR.    Chop twenty-four anchovies, bones and all, two shallots, a handful of  scraped horse radish, four blades of mace, one quart of white wine, one  pint of anchovy liquor, one pint of claret, twelve cloves, and twelve  pepper corns; boil them together till reduced to a quart, then strain it  off into a bottle for use Two spoonsful will be sufficient for a pound  of butter.           *       *       *       *       *    SAUCE FOR WILD FOWL.    Take a gill of claret, with as much water, some grated bread, three  heads of shallots, a little whole pepper, mace, grated nutmeg, and salt;  let them stew over the fire, then beat it up with butter, and put it  under the wild fowl, which being a little roasted, will afford gravy to  mix with this sauce.           *       *       *       *       *    SAUCE FOR BOILED RABBITS.    Boil the livers, and shred them very small, chop two eggs not boiled  very hard, a large spoonful of grated white bread, some broth, sweet  herbs, two spoonsful of white wine, one of vinegar, a little salt, and  some butter; stir all together, and take care the butter does not oil.           *       *       *       *       *    GRAVY.    Take a rasher or two of bacon, and lay it at the bottom of a stew pan,  putting either veal, mutton, or beef, cut in slices, over it; then add  some sliced onions, turnips, carrots, celery, a little thyme, and  alspice. Put in a little water, and set it on the fire, stewing till it  be brown at the bottom, which you will know from the pan's hissing; then  pour boiling water over it, and stew it an hour and a half; but the time  must be regulated by the quantity. Season it with salt and pepper.           *       *       *       *       *    FORCEMEAT BALLS.

If they are for the use of white sauce, do not fry them,  but put them in a sauce-pan of hot water and let them boil a few  minutes.           *       *       *       *       *    SAUCE FOR BOILED DUCKS OR RABBITS.    Pour boiled onions over your ducks, or rabbits, prepared in this manner:  peel some onions, and boil them in plenty of water; then change the  first water, and boil them two hours: take them up and put them in a  colander to drain, and afterwards chop them on a board; then put them in  a sauce-pan, sprinkle a little flour over them, and put in a large piece  of butter, with a little milk or cream. Set them over the fire, and when  the butter is melted, they will be done enough. This is a good sauce for  mutton also.           *       *       *       *       *    LOBSTER SAUCE.    Boil a little mace, and whole pepper, long enough to take out the strong  taste of the spice; then strain it off, and melt three quarters of a  pound of butter in it. Cut the lobster in very small pieces, and stew it  till it is tender.           *       *       *       *       *    SHRIMP SAUCE.    Wash half a pint of shrimps very clean--mince and put them in a  stew-pan, with a spoonful of anchovy liquor, and a pound of thick melted  butter; boil it up for five minutes, and squeeze in half a lemon. Toss  it up, and put it in a sauce-boat.           *       *       *       *       *    OYSTER SAUCE FOR FISH.    Scald a pint of oysters, and strain them through a sieve; then wash some  more in cold water, and take off their beards; put them in a stew-pan,  and pour the liquor over them; then add a large spoonful of anchovy  liquor, half a lemon, two blades of mace, and thicken it with butter  rolled in flour. Put in half a pound of butter, and boil it till it is  melted--take out the mace and lemon, and squeeze the lemon juice into  the sauce; boil it, and stir it all the time, and put it in a boat.           *       *       *       *       *    CELERY SAUCE.    Wash and pare a large bunch of celery very clean cut it into little  bits, and boil it softly till it is tender; add half a pint of cream,  some mace, nutmeg, and a small piece of butter rolled in flour; then  boil it gently. This is a good sauce for roasted or boiled fowls,  turkeys, partridges, or any other game.           *       *       *       *       *    MUSHROOM SAUCE.    Clean and wash one quart of fresh mushrooms, cut them in two, and put  them into a stew-pan, with a little salt, a blade of mace, and a little  butter; stew them gently for half an hour, and then add half a pint of  cream, and the yelks of two eggs beat very well--keep stirring it till  it "]]]
