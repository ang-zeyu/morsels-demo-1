The difference  between an acute angle and a right angle is termed the complement of  the angle, and between an angle and two right angles the supplement  of the angle. The generalized view of angles and their measurement is  treated in the article TRIGONOMETRY. A solid angle is definable as  the space contained by three or more planes intersecting in a common  point; it is familiarly represented by a corner. The angle between two  planes is termed dihedral, between three trihedral, between any number  more than three polyhedral. A spherical angle is a particular dihedral  angle; it is the angle between two intersecting arcs on a sphere, and  is measured by the angle between the planes containing the arcs and  the centre of the sphere.    [v.02 p.0015]    The angle between a line and a curve (mixed angle) or between two  curves (curvilinear angle) is measured by the angle between the line  and the tangent at the point of intersection, or between the tangents  to both curves at their common point. Various names (now rarely, if  ever, used) have been given to particular cases:--amphicyrtic (Gr.  [Greek: amphi], on both sides, [Greek: kyrtos], convex) or cissoidal  (Gr. [Greek: kissos], ivy), biconvex; xystroidal or sistroidal (Gr.  [Greek: xystris], a tool for scraping), concavo-convex; amphicoelic  (Gr. [Greek: koilae], a hollow) or _angulus lunularis_, biconcave.      [Illustration: The Angler (_Lophius piscatorius_).]      ANGLER, also sometimes called fishing-frog, frog-fish, sea-devil  (_Lophius piscatorius_), a fish well known off the coasts of Great  Britain and Europe generally, the grotesque shape of its body and its  singular habits having attracted the attention of naturalists of all  ages. To the North Sea fishermen this fish is known as the \"monk,\" a  name which more properly belongs to _Rhina squatina_, a fish allied to  the skates. Its head is of enormous size, broad, flat and depressed,  the remainder of the body appearing merely like an appendage. The wide  mouth extends all round the anterior circumference of the head;  and both jaws are armed with bands of long pointed teeth, which are  inclined inwards, and can be depressed so as to offer no impediment to  an object gliding towards the stomach, but to prevent its escape from  the mouth. The pectoral and ventral fins are so articulated as to  perform the functions of feet, the fish being enabled to move, or  rather to walk, on the bottom of the sea, where it generally hides  itself in the sand or amongst sea-weed. All round its head and also  along the body the skin bears fringed appendages resembling short  fronds of sea-weed, a structure which, combined with the extraordinary  faculty of assimilating the colour of the body to its surroundings,  assists this fish greatly in concealing itself in places which  it selects on account of the abundance of prey. To render the  organization of this creature perfect in relation to its wants, it is  provided with three long filaments inserted along the middle of the  head, which are, in fact, the detached and modified three first spines  of the anterior dorsal fin. The filament most important in the economy  of the angler is the first, which is the longest, terminates in a  lappet, and is movable in every direction. The angler is believed to  attract other fishes by means of its lure, and then to seize them  with its enormous jaws. It is probable enough that smaller fishes are  attracted in this way, but experiments have shown that the action  of the jaws is automatic and depends on contact of the prey with the  tentacle. Its stomach is distensible in an extraordinary degree, and  not rarely fishes have been taken out quite as large and heavy as  their destroyer. It grows to a length of more than 5 ft.; specimens  of 3 ft. are common. The spawn of the angler is very remarkable. It  consists of a thin sheet of transparent gelatinous material 2 or 3  ft. broad and 25 to 30 ft. in length. The eggs in this sheet are in a  single layer, each in its own little cavity. The spawn is free in the  sea. The larvae are free-swimming and have the pelvic fins elongated  into filaments. The British species is found all round the coasts of  Europe and western North America, but becomes scarce beyond 60 deg. N.  lat.; it occurs also on the coasts of the Cape of Good Hope. A second  species (_Lophius budegassa_) inhabits the Mediterranean, and a third  (_L. setigerus_) the coasts of China and Japan.        ANGLESEY, ARTHUR ANNESLEY, 1st EARL OF (1614-1686), British statesman,  son of the 1st Viscount Valentia (cr. 1621) and Baron Mountnorris (cr.  1628), and of Dorothy, daughter of Sir John Philipps of Picton Castle,  Pembrokeshire, was born at Dublin on the 10th of July 1614, was  educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, and was admitted to Lincoln's  Inn in 1634. Having made the grand tour he returned to Ireland; and  being employed by the parliament in a mission to the duke of Ormonde,  now reduced to the last extremities, he succeeded in concluding a  treaty with him on the 19th of June 1647, thus securing the country  from complete subjection to the rebels. In April 1647 he was  returned for Radnorshire to the House of Commons. He supported the  parliamentary as against the republican or army party, and appears  to have been one of the members excluded in 1648. He sat in Richard  Cromwell's parliament for Dublin city, and endeavoured to take his  seat in the restored Rump Parliament of 1659. He was made president of  the council in February 1660, and in the Convention Parliament sat for  Carmarthen borough. The anarchy of the last months of the commonwealth  converted him to royalism, and he showed great activity in bringing  about the Restoration. He used his influence in moderating measures of  revenge and violence, and while sitting in judgment on the regicides  was on the side of leniency. In November 1660 by his father's death  he had become Viscount Valentia and Baron Mountnorris in the Irish  peerage, and on the 20th April 1661 he was created Baron Annesley of  Newport Pagnell in Buckinghamshire and earl of Anglesey in the  peerage of Great Britain. He supported the king's administration in  parliament, but opposed strongly the unjust measure which, on the  abolition of the court of wards, placed the extra burden of  taxation thus rendered necessary on the excise. His services in the  administration of Ireland were especially valuable. He filled the  office of vice-treasurer from 1660 till 1667, served on the committee  for carrying out the declaration for the settlement of Ireland and on  the committee for Irish affairs, while later, in 1671 and 1672, he was  a leading member of various commissions appointed to investigate the  working of the Acts of Settlement. In February 1661 he had obtained a  captaincy of horse, and in 1667 he exchanged his vice-treasuryship of  Ireland for the treasuryship of the navy. His public career was marked  by great independence and fidelity to principle. On the 24th of July  1663 he alone signed a protest against the bill \"for the encouragement  of trade,\" on the plea that owing to the free export of coin and  bullion allowed by the act, and to the importation of foreign  commodities being greater than the export of home goods, \"it must  necessarily follow ... that our silver will also be carried away into  foreign parts and all trade fail for want of money.\"[1] He especially  disapproved of another clause in the same bill forbidding the  importation of Irish cattle into England, a mischievous measure  promoted by the duke of Buckingham, and he opposed again the bill  brought in with that object in January 1667. This same year his  naval accounts were subjected to an examination in consequence of his  indignant refusal to take part in the attack upon Ormonde;[2] and he  was suspended from his office in 1668, no charge, however, against him  being substantiated. He took a prominent part in the dispute in 1671  between the two Houses concerning the right of the Lords to amend  money bills, and wrote a learned pamphlet on the question entitled  _The Privileges of the House of Lords and Commons_ (1702), in which  the right of the Lords was asserted. In April 1673 he was appointed  lord privy seal, and was disappointed at not obtaining the great seal  the same year on the removal of Shaftesbury. In 1679 he was included  in Sir W. Temple's new-modelled council.    [v.02 p.0016]    In the bitter religious controversies of the time Anglesey showed  great moderation and toleration. In 1674 he is mentioned as  endeavouring to prevent the justices putting into force the laws  against the Roman Catholics and Nonconformists.[3] In the panic of the  \"Popish Plot\" in 1678 he exhibited a saner judgment than most of his  contemporaries and a conspicuous courage. On the 6th of December he  protested with three other peers against the measure sent up from the  Commons enforcing the disarming of all convicted recusants and taking  bail from them to keep the peace; he was the only peer to dissent  from the motion declaring the existence of an Irish plot; and though  believing in the guilt and voting for the death of Lord Stafford, he  interceded, according to his own account,[4] with the king for him as  well as for Langhorne and Plunket. His independent attitude drew  upon him an attack by Dangerfield, and in the Commons by the  attorney-general, Sir W. Jones, who accused him of endeavouring to  stifle the evidence against the Romanists. In March 1679 he protested  against the second reading of the bill for disabling Danby. In 1681  Anglesey wrote _A Letter from a Person of Honour in the Country_, as a  rejoinder to the earl of Castlehaven, who had published memoirs on  the Irish rebellion defending the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13602"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#14)"],[1,"and \"nigger-toes\", balls,  marbles, etc.    As for food, the slaves had, with the exception of \"fancy trimmins\",  about the same food that the whites ate. No darky in Harris County that  he ever heard of ever went hungry or suffered for clothes until after  freedom.    Every Saturday was a wash day. The clothes and bed linen of all Whites  and Blacks went into wash every Saturday. And \"Niggers\", whether they  liked it or not, had to \"scrub\" themselves every Saturday night.    The usual laundry and toilet soap was a homemade lye product, some of it  a soft-solid, and some as liquid as water. The latter was stored in jugs  and demijohns. Either would \"fetch the dirt, or take the hide off\"; in  short, when applied \"with rag and water, something had to come\".    Many of the Body slaves had wives and husbands living on other  plantations and belonging to other planters. As a courtesy to the  principals of such matrimonial alliances, their owners furnished the men  passes permitting them to visit their wives once or twice a week.  Children born to such unions were the property of the wife's owner; the  father's owner had no claim to them whatsoever.    \"Uncle\" Rias used to frequently come to Columbus with his master before  the war, where he often saw \"Niggers oxioned off\" at the old slave mart  which was located at what is now 1225 Broadway. Negroes to be offered  for sale were driven to Columbus in droves--like cattle--by \"Nawthon  speckulatahs\". And prospective buyers would visit the \"block\"  accompanied by doctors, who would feel of, thump, and examine the  \"Nigger\" to see if sound. A young or middle-aged Negro man, specially or  even well trained in some trade or out-of-the-ordinary line of work,  often sold for from $2000.00 to $4000.00 in gold. Women and \"runty  Nigger men\" commanded a price of from $600.00 up, each. A good \"breedin  oman\", though, says \"Uncle\" Rias, would sometimes sell for as high as  $1200.00.    Rias Body had twelve brothers, eight of whom were \"big buck Niggers,\"  and older than himself. The planters and \"patarolers\" accorded these  \"big Niggers\" unusual privileges--to the end that he estimates that they  \"wuz de daddies uv least a hunnert head o' chillun in Harris County  before de war broke out.\" Some of these children were \"scattered\" over a  wide area.    Sin, according to Rias Body, who voices the sentiment of the great  majority of aged Negroes, is that, or everything, which one does and  says \"not in the name of the Master\". The holy command, \"Whatever ye do,  do it in My name,\" is subjected to some very unorthodox interpretations  by many members of the colored race. Indeed, by their peculiar  interpretation of this command, it is established that \"two clean sheets  can't smut\", which means that a devout man and woman may indulge in the  primal passion without committing sin.    The old man rather boasts of the fact that he received a number of  whippings when a slave: says he now knows that he deserved them, \"an  thout 'em\", he would have no doubt \"been hung 'fore he wuz thutty years  ole.\"    Among the very old slaves whom he knew as a boy were quite a few whom  the Negroes looked up to, respected, and feared as witches, wizzards,  and magic-workers. These either brought their \"learnin\" with them from  Africa or absorbed it from their immediate African forebears. Mentally,  these people wern't brilliant, but highly sensitized, and Rias gave \"all  sich\" as wide a berth as opportunity permitted him, though he knows \"dat  dey had secret doins an carrying-ons\". In truth, had the Southern Whites  not curbed the mumbo-jumboism of his people, he is of the opinion that  it would not now be safe to step \"out his doe at night\".    Incidentally, Rias Body is more fond of rabbit than any other meat \"in  de wurrul\", and says that he could--if he were able to get them--eat  three rabbits a day, 365 days in the year, and two for breakfast on  Christmas morning. He also states that pork, though killed in the  hottest of July weather, will not spoil if it is packed down in shucked  corn-on-the-cob. This he learned in slavery days when, as a \"run-away\",  he \"knocked a shoat in the head\" one summer and tried it--proving it.          EX-SLAVE INTERVIEW    JAMES BOLTON  Athens, Georgia    Written by:  Mrs. Sarah H. Hall  Federal Writers' Project  Residency 4  Athens, Georgia    Edited by:  Miss Maude Barragan  Residency 13  Augusta, Georgia      \"It never was the same on our plantation atter we done laid Mistess  away,\" said James Bolton, 85 year old mulatto ex-slave. \"I ain't never  forget when Mistess died--she had been so good to every nigger on our  plantation. When we got sick, Mistess allus had us tended to. The  niggers on our plantation all walked to church to hear her funeral  sermon and then walked to the graveyard to the buryin'.\"    James, shrivelled and wrinkled, with his bright eyes taking in  everything on one of his rare visits to town, seemed glad of the chance  to talk about slavery days. He spoke of his owner as \"my employer\" and  hastily corrected himself by saying, \"I means, my marster.\"    \"My employer, I means my marster, and my mistess, they was sho' all  right white folkses,\" he continued. \"They lived in the big 'ouse. Hit  was all painted brown. I heard tell they was more'n 900 acres in our  plantation and lots of folkses lived on it. The biggest portion was  woods. My paw, he was name Whitfield Bolton and Liza Bolton was my maw.  Charlie, Edmund, Thomas and John Bolton was my brothers and I had one  sister, she was Rosa. We belonged to Marse Whitfield Bolton and we lived  on his plantation in Oglethorpe County near Lexington, not far from the  Wilkes County line.    \"We stayed in a one room log cabin with a dirt floor. A frame made  outen pine poles was fastened to the wall to hold up the mattresses. Our  mattresses was made outen cotton bagging stuffed with wheat straw. Our  kivers was quilts made outen old clothes. Slave 'omens too old to work  in the fields made the quilts.    \"Maw, she went up to the big house onc't a week to git the 'lowance or  vittles. They 'lowanced us a week's rations at a time. Hit were  generally hog meat, corn meal and sometimes a little flour. Maw, she  done our cookin' on the coals in the fireplace at our cabin. We had  plenty of 'possums and rabbits and fishes and sometimes we had wild  tukkeys and partidges. Slaves warn't spozen to go huntin' at night and  everybody know you can't ketch no 'possums 'ceppin' at night! Jus' the  same, we had plenty 'possums and nobody ax how we cotch 'em!\" James  laughed and nodded. \"Now, 'bout them rabbits! Slaves warn't 'lowed to  have no guns and no dogs of they own. All the dogs on our plantation  belonged to my employer--I means, to my marster, and he 'lowed us to use  his dogs to run down the rabbits. Nigger mens and boys 'ud go in crowds,  sometimes as many as twelve at one time, and a rabbit ain't got no  chance 'ginst a lot of niggers and dogs when they light out for to run  'im down!    \"What wild critters we wanted to eat and couldn't run down, we was right  smart 'bout ketchin' in traps. We cotch lots of wild tukkeys and  partidges in traps and nets. Long Crick runned through our plantation  and the river warn't no fur piece off. We sho' did ketch the fishes,  mostly cats, and perch and heaps and heaps of suckers. We cotch our  fishes mos'n generally with hook and line, but the carpenters on our  plantation knowed how to make basket traps that sho' nuff did lay in  the fishes! God only knows how long it's been since this old nigger  pulled a big shad out of the river. Ain't no shads been cotch in the  river round here in so long I disremembers when!    \"We didn' have no gardens of our own round our cabins. My employer--I  means, my marster--had one big gyarden for our whole plantation and all  his niggers had to work in it whensomever he wanted 'em to, then he give  'em all plenty good gyarden sass for theyselfs. They was collards and  cabbage and turnips and beets and english peas and beans and onions, and  they was allus some garlic for ailments. Garlic was mostly to cure wums  (worms). They roasted the garlic in the hot ashes and squez the juice  outen it and made the chilluns take it. Sometimes they made poultices  outen garlic for the pneumony.    \"We saved a heap of bark from wild cherry and poplar and black haw and  slippery ellum trees and we dried out mullein leaves. They was all mixed  and brewed to make bitters. Whensomever a nigger got sick, them bitters  was good for--well ma'am, they was good for what ailed 'em! We tuk 'em  for rheumatiz, for fever, and for the misery in the stummick and for  most all sorts of sickness. Red oak bark tea was good for sore throat.    \"I never seed no store bought clothes twel long atter freedom done come!  One slave 'oman done all the weavin' in a separate room called the 'loom  house.' The cloth was dyed with home-made coloring. They used indigo for  blue, red oak bark for brown, green husks offen warnicks (walnuts) for  black, and sumacs for red and they'd mix these colors to make other  colors. Other slave 'omans larned to sew and they made all the clothes.  Endurin' the summertime we jus' wore shirts and pants made outen plain  cotton cloth. They wove wool in with the cotton to make the cloth for  our winter clothes. The wool was raised right thar on our plantation. We  had our own shoemaker man--he was a slave named Buck Bolton and he made  all the shoes the niggers on our plantation wore.    \"I waren't nothin' but chillun when freedom come. In slavery-time  chilluns waren't 'lowed to do no wuk kazen the marsters wanted they  niggers to grow up big and strong and didn' want 'em stunted none.
