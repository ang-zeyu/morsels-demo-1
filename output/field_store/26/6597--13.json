When a tensile  stress of 2,174 lb., equivalent to 2,860 lb. per square inch of section,  was applied, the leather gave way, leaving the joint intact. Belts  fastened by a scarf joint with this glue are said to be of absolutely the  same thickness and pliability at the joint as in the main portion of the  belt, and thus insure freedom from noise and perfect steadiness. The  instructions for use are simple, and it requires only fifteen minutes for  the joint to set before being ready for use. From a rough chemical analysis  of the sample submitted to us, we find that it consists of gelatine, with  small amounts of mineral ingredients. Josef Horadam, some few years ago,  patented in Germany a process for preserving glues from decomposition, by  the addition of from 8 to 10 per cent. of magnesium or calcium chlorides.  The addition of these salts does not impair in any way the strength of the  glue, but prevents it from decomposing, and it may be that the \"Hercules  glue\" is preserved in a similar manner.    A cement of this nature, if thoroughly to be relied on, must be of great  value, although the great variation in the quality of leather, apart from  the difficulty hitherto experienced of securely connecting the ends  together, opens a wide field for a material of uniform composition, and  capable of being made in one piece in suitable lengths for driving belts  and other machine gear.--_Industries._           *       *       *       *       *          INAUGURATION OF THE STATUE OF DENIS PAPIN.      A large crowd was present recently at the inauguration of the statue of  Denis Papin, which took place in the court of the Conservatoire des Arts et  Metiers, under the presidency of Mr. Lockroy, Minister of Commerce and the  Industries.    [Illustration: DENIS PAPIN.]    In the large hall in which the addresses were made there were several  municipal counselors, the representatives of the Minister of War, Captains  Driant and Frocard, several members of the Institute, and others. A  delegation from the Syndical Chamber of Conductors, Enginemen, and Stokers,  which contributed through a subscription toward the erection of the statue,  was present at the ceremony with its banner. Mr. Lanssedat, superintendent  of the Conservatoire, received the guests, assisted by all the professors.  Mr. Lanssedat opened the proceedings by an address in which he paid homage  to the scientists who were persecuted while living, to Denis Papin, who did  for mechanics what Nicolas le Blanc did for chemistry, and to those men  whose entire life was devoted to the triumph of the cause of science.    After this, an address was delivered by Mr. Lockroy, who expatiated upon  the great services rendered by the master of all the sciences known at that  epoch, who was in turn physician, physicist, mechanician, and  mathematician, and who, in discovering the properties of steam, laid the  foundation of modern society, which, so to speak, arose from this  incomparable discovery.    Speeches were afterward made by Mr. Feray d'Essonnes, president of the  Syndical Chamber of Conductors, Enginemen, and Stokers, and by Prof.  Comberousse, of the Central School, who broadly outlined the life of Papin.    Along about four o'clock, the Minister of Commerce and the Industries,  followed by all the invited guests, repaired to the court, and the veil  that hid the statue was then lifted amid acclamation.    Papin is represented as standing and performing an experiment.    Upon the pedestal is the following inscription:        DENIS PAPIN      BORN IN 1647, DIED ABOUT 1714,      INVENTED THE STEAM ENGINE      IN 1690        NATIONAL SUBSCRIPTION, 1886.    The inauguration is due to the initiative of Mr. Lanssedat, for it was he  who in 1885 suggested the national subscription, which was quickly raised.    Denis Papin was born at Blois on the 22d of August, 1647. He was the son of  a physician. After the example of his father and of several of his  relatives, he studied medicine and took his degree; but his taste for  mathematics, and especially for experimental physics, soon led him to  abandon medicine.    It was in 1690 that he published in the _Actes_ of Leipsic the memoir which  will forever and irrevocably assign to him the priority in the invention of  steam engines and steamboats, and the title of which was: \"New method of  cheaply obtaining the greatest motive powers.\"    In 1704, Papin, poor and obliged to do everything for himself, finished his  first steamboat; but for want of money he was unable to make a trial of it  until August 15, 1707. The trial was made upon the Fulda and Wera,  affluents of the Weser.    The operation succeeded wonderfully, and, shortly afterward, Papin, being  desirous of rendering the experiment complete, put his boat on the Weser;  but the stupid boatmen of this river drew his craft ashore and broke it and  its engine in pieces.    This catastrophe ruined Papin, and annihilated all his hopes. The great  man, falling into shocking destitution, broken down and conquered by  adversity, returned to England in 1712 to seek aid and an asylum.    Everywhere repulsed, he returned to Cassel about 1714, sad and discouraged;  and the man to whom we owe that prodigy, the steam engine, that instrument  of universal welfare and riches, disappeared without leaving any trace of  his death.--_Le Monde Illustre._           *       *       *       *       *          DECORATION.    THE STUDY OF ORNAMENTS.    [Footnote: _Authorities consulted in preparing this paper:_ \"Analysis of  Ornament,\" Wornum; \"Truth, Beauty, and Power,\" Dresser; \"Lectures on Art.\"  F.W. Moody; \"Hopes and Fears for Art,\" Wm. Morris; \"Ornamental Art,\" Hulme;  \"Manuals of Art Education,\" Prang.]    By MISS MARIE R. GARESCHE, St. Louis High School.      Decoration is the science and art of beautifying objects and rendering them  more pleasing to the eye. As an art, individual taste and skill have much  to do with the perfection of the results; as a science, it is subject to  certain invariable laws and principles which cannot be violated, and a  study of which, added to familiarity with some of the best examples, will  enable any one to appreciate and understand it, even if lacking the skill  and power to create original and beautiful designs.    The study of decoration offers many advantages. It cultivates the  imagination and the taste; it develops our capacity for recognizing and  enjoying the beautiful in both nature and art; it adds to the pleasure and  refinement of life. Practically, its importance can hardly be  overestimated, as it enters into almost all the industrial pursuits. We can  think of but few classes of objects, even the most simple, in which some  attempt at ornamentation is not made.    Ornament is one of the principal means of enhancing the value of the raw  material. A piece of carved wood, or an artistically decorated porcelain  vase, worth perhaps many hundred dollars, if reduced to the commercial  value of the material of which they are composed would be valued at but a  few dollars or cents. The higher the ornamentation ranks, from an artistic  point of view, the greater becomes the value of the article to which it is  applied. Knowledge of good designs is thus evidently important, to the  purchaser of the object ornamented as well as to the designer who planned  it. This can only be attained by cultivation.    To know and appreciate the best ornament should be an aim set forth in any  scheme of general education. This knowledge and appreciation can be  obtained by studying the application of the laws and principles of  ornamental art as exemplified in the works of masters, and also by  endeavoring to apply these principles in designs of our own creation.      PRINCIPLES OF ORNAMENT.    We can only arrive at a knowledge of these principles by a consideration of  the object. In other words, nature and history must be studied. First,  _nature_, for she is the primary source and origin of all good ornament,  whether ancient or modern; and if, as in everything else, we would not  become servile imitators and weak copyists, we must go to the fountain  head. Second, _history_, for by the study of the ornament of past ages we  will not only become acquainted with the highest developments of which  ornamental art is capable, but will moreover broaden our views as to its  object and scope, and will stimulate our own imagination and invention, by  leading us to the contemplation of the myriad beautiful and protean forms  it has assumed, when surrounding conditions, such as religion, climate,  temperament, nationality, etc., have been different. Knowledge of historic  ornament will also prevent the imposition on the public, so common in our  day, of weak and unworthy productions which claim to be based on classic  originals, and which constitute a great stumbling block to the progress and  appreciation of good art. The result is somewhat analogous to that produced  upon conscientious but ill-informed minds, who make every effort to  appreciate and enjoy the spurious productions of a great author, not  knowing that they are not genuine.      POSITION AND SCOPE OF ORNAMENTAL OR DECORATIVE ART.    I. _Object of Ornamental Art._--The object or purpose of ornament, as in  the other fine arts, is to please. In music and poetry this enjoyment is  conveyed to the mind through the ear; in the decorative and pictorial arts,  through the eye. Generally, the meaning that we find in such productions,  the appeal that they make to the understanding or feelings, is as great a  source of interest to us as their intrinsic beauty. Poetry and vocal music  are greatly dependent for their effect upon the meaning they convey in  words; painting and sculpture, upon the ideas or sentiments they suggest.  In all four, however, and most decidedly in music"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1167"],[0,"A Strange Disappearance (#14)"],[1,"s, I will tell you why I, a member of the police force, dare  enter the house of such a man as you are, and put him the questions I  have concerning his domestic affairs. Mr. Blake, imagine yourself in  a detective's office. A woman comes in, the housekeeper of a respected  citizen, and informs us that a girl employed by her as seamstress has  disappeared in a very unaccountable way from her master's house  the night before; in fact been abducted as she thinks from certain  evidences, through the window. Her manner is agitated, her appeal for  assistance urgent, though she acknowledges no relationship to the girl  or expresses any especial cause for her interest beyond that of common  humanity. 'She must be found,' she declares, and hints that any sum  necessary will be forthcoming, though from what source after her own  pittance is expended she does not state. When asked if her master has  no interest in the matter, she changes color and puts us off. He never  noticed his servants, left all such concerns to her, etc.; but shows  fear when a proposition is made to consult him. Next imagine yourself  with the detectives in that gentleman's house. You enter the girl's  room; what is the first thing you observe? Why that it is not only one  of the best in the house, but that it is conspicuous for its comforts if  not for its elegancies. More than that, that there are books of poetry  and history lying around, showing that the woman who inhabited it was  above her station; a fact which the housekeeper is presently brought to  acknowledge. You notice also that the wild surmise of her abduction by  means of the window, has some ground in appearance, though the fact  that she went with entire unwillingness is not made so apparent. The  housekeeper, however, insists in a way that must have had some special  knowledge of the girl's character or circumstances to back it, that she  never went without compulsion; a statement which the torn curtains  and the track of blood over the roof of the extension, would seem to  emphasize. A few other facts are made known. First, a pen-knife is  picked up from the grass plot in the yard beneath, showing with what  instrument the wound was inflicted, whose drippings made those marks of  blood alluded to. It was a pearl-handled knife belonging to the writing  desk found open on her table, and its frail and dainty character proved  indisputably, that it was employed by the girl herself, and that against  manifest enemies; no man being likely to snatch up any such puny weapon  for the purpose either of offence or defence. That these enemies were  two and were both men, was insisted upon by Mrs. Daniels who overheard  their voices the night before.    \"Mr. Blake, such facts as these arouse curiosity, especially when  the master of the house being introduced upon the scene, he fails to  manifest common human interest, while his housekeeper betrays in every  involuntary gesture and expression she makes use of, her horror if not  her fear of his presence, and her relief at his departure. Yes,\" he  exclaimed, unheeding the sudden look here cast him by Mr. Blake, \"and  curiosity begets inquiry, and inquiry elucidated further facts such as  these, that the mysterious master of the house was in his garden at the  hour of the girl's departure, was even looking through the bars of his  gate when she, having evidently escaped from her captors, came back with  every apparent desire to reenter her home, but seeing him, betrayed an  unreasonable amount of fear and fled back even into the very arms of  the men she had endeavored to avoid. Did you speak sir?\" asked Mr. Gryce  suddenly stopping, with a sly look at his left boot tip.    Mr. Blake shook his head. \"No,\" said he shortly, \"go on.\" But that last  remark of Mr. Gryce had evidently made its impression.    \"Inquiry revealed, also, two or three other interesting facts. First,  that this gentleman qualified though he was to shine in ladies' society,  never obtruded himself there, but employed his leisure time instead, in  walking the lower streets of the city, where he was seen more than  once conversing with certain poor girls at street corners and in blind  alleys. The last one he talked with, believed from her characteristics  to be the same one that was abducted from his house--\"    \"Hold there,\" said Mr. Blake with some authority in his tone, \"there you  are mistaken; that is impossible.\"    \"Ah, and why?\"    \"The girl you allude to had bright golden hair, something which the  woman who lived in my house did not possess.\"    \"Indeed. I thought you had never noticed the woman who sewed for you,  sir,--did not know how she looked?\"    \"I should have noticed her if she had had such hair as the girl you  speak of.\"    Mr. Gryce smiled and opened his pocketbook.    \"There is a sample of her hair, sir,\" said he, taking out a thin strand  of brilliant hair and showing it to the gentleman before him. \"Bright  you see, and golden as that of the unfortunate creature you talked with  the other night.\"    Mr. Blake stooped forward and lifted it with a hand that visibly  trembled. \"Where did you get this?\" asked he at last, clenching it to  his breast with sudden passion.    \"From out of the comb which the girl had been using the night before.\"    The imperious man flung it hastily from him.    \"We waste our time,\" said he, looking Mr. Gryce intently in the face.  \"All that you have said does not account for your presence here nor the  tone you have used while addressing me. What are you keeping back? I am  not a man to be trifled with.\"    Mr. Gryce rose to his feet. \"You are right,\" said he, and he gave a  short glance in my direction. \"All that I have said would not perhaps  justify me in this intrusion, if--\" he looked again towards me. \"Do you  wish me to continue?\" he asked.    Mr. Blake's intent look deepened. \"I see no reason why you should not  utter the whole,\" said he. \"A good story loses nothing by being told  to the end. You wish to say something about my journey to Schoenmaker's  house, I suppose.\"    Mr. Gryce gravely shook his head.    \"What, you can let such a mystery as that go without a word?\"    \"I am not here to discuss mysteries that have no connection with the  sewing-girl in whose cause I am interested.\"    \"Then,\" said Mr. Blake, turning for the first time upon my superior with  all the dignified composure for which he was eminent, \"it is no  longer necessary for us to prolong this interview. I have allowed, nay  encouraged you to state in the plainest terms what it was you had or  imagined you had against me, knowing that my actions of late, seen by  those who did not possess the key to them, must have seemed a little  peculiar. But when you say you have no interest in any mystery  disconnected with the girl who has lived the last few months in  my house, I can with assurance say that it is time we quitted this  unprofitable conversation, as nothing which I have lately done, said or  thought here or elsewhere has in any way had even the remotest bearing  upon that individual; she having been a stranger to me while in my  house, and quite forgotten by me, after her unaccountable departure  hence.\"    Mr. Gryce's hand which had been stretched out towards the hitherto  untouched decanter before him, suddenly dropped. \"You deny then,\" said  he, \"all connection between yourself and the woman, lady or sewing-girl,  who occupied that room above our heads for eleven months previous to the  Sunday morning I first had the honor to make your acquaintance.\"    \"I am not in the habit of repeating my assertions,\" said Mr. Blake with  some severity, \"even when they relate to a less disagreeable matter than  the one under discussion.\"    Mr. Gryce bowed, and slowly reached out for his hat; I had never seen  him so disturbed. \"I am sorry,\" he began and stopped, fingering his  hat-brim nervously. Suddenly he laid his hat back, and drew up his form  into as near a semblance of dignity as its portliness would allow.    \"Mr. Blake,\" said he, \"I have too much respect for the man I believed  you to be when I entered this house to-night, to go with the thing  unsaid which is lying at present like a dead weight upon my lips. I dare  not leave you to the consequence of my silence; for duty will compel  me to speak some day and in some presence where you may not have  the opportunity which you can have here, to explain yourself with  satisfaction. Mr. Blake I cannot believe you when you say the girl who  lived in this house was a stranger to you.\"    Mr. Blake drew his proud form up in a disdain that was only held in  check by the very evident honesty of the man before him. \"You  are courageous at least,\" said he. \"I regret you are not equally  discriminating.\" And raising Mr. Gryce's hat he placed it in his hand.    \"Pardon me,\" said that gentleman, \"I would like to justify myself before  I go. Not with words,\" he proceeded as the other folded his arms with a  sarcastic bow. \"I am done with words; action accomplishes the rest. Mr.  Blake I believe you consider me an honest officer and a reliable man.  Will you accompany me to your private room for a moment? There is  something there which may convince you I was neither playing the fool  nor the bravado when I uttered the phrase I did an instant ago.\"    I expected to hear the haughty master of the house refuse a request so  peculiar. But he only bowed, though in a surprised way that showed  his curiosity if no more was aroused. \"My room and company are at your  disposal,\" said he, \"but you will find nothing there to justify you in  your assertions.\"    \"Let me at least make the effort,\" entreated my superior.    Mr. Blake smiling bitterly immediately led the way to the door. \"The  man may come,\" he remarked carelessly as Mr. Gryce waved his hand in my  direction. \"Your justification if not mine may need witnesses.\"    Rejoiced at the permission, for my curiosity was by this time raised to  fever pitch,"]]]
