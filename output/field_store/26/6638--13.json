The former  claimed the horns as his perquisite, as he had performed the office  of butcher, and Johnson disputed the claim. To settle the matter, Mr.  Park gave a horn to each of the litigants.    Leaving Konjour, and sleeping at a village called Malla, on the 8th  he arrived at Kolor, a considerable town, near the entrance into  which he saw hanging upon a tree, a sort of masquerade habit, made of  the bark of trees, which he was told belonged to Mumbo Jumbo. The  account of this personage is thus narrated by Mr. Park: \"This is a  strange bugbear, common to all the Mandingo towns, and much employed  by the pagan natives in keeping their women in subjection, for as the  kafirs are not restricted in the number of their wives, every one  marries as many as he can maintain, and, as it frequently happens,  that the ladies disagree among themselves, family quarrels rise  sometimes to such a height, that the husband can no longer preserve  peace in his household. In such cases, the interposition of Mumbo  Jumbo is called in, and is always decisive.\"    This strange minister of justice, who is supposed to be either the  husband himself, or some person instructed by him, disguised in the  dress before mentioned, and armed with his rod of public authority,  announces his coming by loud and continual screams in the woods near  the town. He begins the pantomime at the approach of night, and, as  soon as it is dark, enters the town, and proceeds to the bentang, at  which all the inhabitants immediately assemble.    This exhibition is not much relished by the women, for as the person  in disguise is unknown to them, every married female suspects the  visit may be intended for herself, but they dare not refuse to  appear, when they are summoned: and the ceremony commences with songs  and dances, which continue till midnight, when Mumbo fixes on the  offender. The victim, being immediately seized, is stripped naked,  tied to a post, and severely scourged with Mumbo's rod, amidst the  shouts and derisions of the assembly; and it is remarkable, that the  rest of the women are loudest in their exclamations against their  unhappy sister. Daylight puts an end to this indecent and unmanly  revel.    On the 9th of December, Park reached Tambacunda, leaving which the  next morning, he arrived in the evening at Kooniakary, a town of  nearly the same size and extent as Kolor. On the 11th he came to  Koojar, the frontier town of Woolli near Bondou.    King Jatta's guide being now to return, Park presented him with some  amber, and having been informed that it was not possible at all times  to procure water in the wilderness, he inquired for men, who would  serve both as guides and water-bearers, and he procured three  negroes, elephant hunters, for that service, paying them three bars  each in advance.    The inhabitants of Koojar beheld the white man with surprise and  veneration, and in the evening invited him to see a _neobering,_ or  wrestling match, in the bentang. This is an exercise very common in  all these countries. The spectators formed a ring round the  wrestlers, who were strong, active young men, full of emulation, and  accustomed to such contests. Being stripped to a short pair of  drawers, and having their skin anointed with oil or _Shea_ water, the  combatants approached, each on all fours, parrying for some time,  till at length one of them sprang forward, and caught his antagonist  by the knee. Great dexterity and judgment were now displayed, but the  combat was decided by strength. Few Europeans would have subdued the  conqueror. The wrestlers were animated by the sound of a drum.    After the wrestling, commenced a dance, in which many performers  assisted, provided with little bells fastened to their legs and arms,  and here also the drum assisted their movements. The drum likewise  keeps order among the spectators, by imitating the sound of certain  Mandingo sentences; for example, when the sport is about to begin,  the drummer strikes, which is understood to signify, _Ali boe si,_  \"sit all down,\" upon which the lookers-on immediately squat  themselves on the ground, and when the combatants are to begin, he  strikes, _Amuta, amuta,_ \"take hold, take hold.\"    In the morning of the 12th, he found that one of the elephant hunters  had absconded with the money he had received beforehand; and to  prevent the other two from following his example, Park made them  instantly fill their calabashes with water, and they entered the  wilderness that separates Woolli from Bondou. The attendants halted  to prepare a saphie or charm, to ensure a safe journey. This was done  by muttering a few sentences, and spitting upon a stone, thrown  before them on the road. Having repeated this operation three times,  the negroes proceeded with assurance off safety.    Riding along, they came to a large tree, called by the natives _neema  taba_. It was decorated with innumerable rags of cloth, which persons  travelling across the wilderness had at different times tied to the  branches, which was done, according to the opinion of Mr. Park, to  inform the traveller that water was to be found near it; but the  custom has been so sanctioned by time, that nobody now presumes to  pass without hanging up something. Park followed the example, and  suspended a handsome piece of cloth on one of the boughs; and being  informed that either a well or a pool of water was at no great  distance, he ordered the negroes to unload the asses, that they might  give them some corn, and regale themselves with the provisions,  which they had brought, meanwhile he sent one of the elephant hunters  to look for the well. A pool was found, but the water was thick and  muddy, and the negro discovered near it the remains of fire and  fragments of provisions, which showed that it had been lately  visited, either by travellers or banditti. The attendants,  apprehending the latter, and supposing that the robbers lurked at no  great distance, Mr. Park proceeded to another watering place. He  arrived there late in the, evening, fatigued with so long a day's  journey; and kindling a large fire, laid down, more than a gunshot  from any bush, the negroes agreeing to keep watch by turns, to  prevent surprise. The negroes were indeed very apprehensive of  banditti during the whole of the journey. As soon, therefore, as  daylight appeared, they filled their soofros and calabashes at the  pool, took their departure, and arrived at Tallika, the first town in  Bondou, on the 13th December. Mr. Park says, that he cannot take  leave of Woolli without observing, that he was every where well  received by the natives, and that the fatigues of the day were  generally alleviated by a hearty welcome at night.    Tallika, the frontier town of Bondou towards Woolli, is inhabited  chiefly by the Mohammedan Foulahs, who acquire no inconsiderable  affluence by furnishing provisions to the coffles or caravans, and by  the sale of ivory from hunting elephants. Here an officer constantly  resides, whose business it is to watch the arrival of the caravans,  which are taxed according to the number of loaded asses.    Mr. Park lodged with this officer, and was accompanied by him to  Fatteconda, the king's residence, for which he was paid five bars.  They halted for the first night at Ganado, where they partook of a  good supper, and were further exhilarated by an itinerant musician,  or singing man, who told a number of entertaining stories, and played  some sweet airs, by blowing his breath upon a bow-string, and  striking it at the same time with a stick.    At daybreak Mr. Park's fellow-travellers, the Serawoollies, took  their leave, with many prayers for his safety. A mile from Ganado  they crossed a branch of the Gambia, called Neriko, and in the  evening reached Koorkarany, a Mohammedan town, in which the  blacksmith had some relations. Koorkarany is surrounded by a high  wall, and is provided with a mosque. Here a number of Arabic  manuscripts were shown to Mr. Park, particularly a copy of the book  called _Al Sharra_. Leaving Koorkarany, they were joined by a young  man, who was travelling to Fatteconda for salt, and as night set in,  they reached Dooggi, a small village about three miles from  Koorkarany. There they purchased a bullock for six small stones of  amber.    Early in the morning of the 18th December, they departed from Dooggi,  joined by a party of Foulahs and others, in the evening arrived at a  village called Buggil, and passed the night in a miserable hut,  having no other bed than a bundle of corn stalks. The wells are here  dug with great ingenuity, and are very deep. From Buggil they  travelled along a dry, stony height, covered with mimosas, and  descended into a deep valley, in which, pursuing their course, they  came to a large village, where they intended to lodge. Many of the  natives were dressed in a thin French gauze, which they called  _byqui_; this being a dress calculated to show the shape of their  persons, was very fashionable among the women. These females were  extremely rude and troublesome; they took Mr. Park's cloak, cut the  buttons from the boy's clothes, and were proceeding to other  outrages, when he mounted his horse, and proceeded on his journey.  In the evening they reached Soobrudooka, and as the company were  numerous, they purchased a sheep and corn wherewith to regale  themselves, after which, they slept by their baggage. From  Soobrudooka they came to a large village on the banks of the Faleme,  which is here very rapid and rocky. The river abounds with a small  fish, of the size of sprats, which are prepared for sale by pounding  them in mortars, and exposing them to dry in the sun in large lumps.    An old moorish shereeff, who came to bestow his blessing on Mr. Park,  and beg some paper to write saphies upon, said that he had seen Major  Houghton in the kingdom of Kaarta, and that he died in the country of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12668"],[0,"An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales, Volume 2 (#14)"],[1,"as a voluntary  approver and partaker in the infamy.    It may be some relief to turn from the contemplation of such iniquity,  though it should be only to the transactions of savages, differing from  these wretches but in complexion.    On the 20th of this month the settlement were spectators of a severe  contest which took place between two parties of natives; one of which was  desirous of revenging the death of a friend, who had been killed by some  native of a part of the country from which a young man had just then  accidentally come amongst them. He was therefore immediately devoted to  their vengeance. Finding their determination, he most gallantly stood up,  and, being attacked by numbers, defended himself with the greatest  bravery and address, until, being wounded in several places, he fell. As  he lay upon the ground, several of his opponents treacherously rushed in  upon him, and stabbed him repeatedly with a pointed stick, which they  call a Doo-ul. In this situation he endeavoured to cover himself with his  shield, on which, having risen from the ground, and being again attacked,  he received their spears for some time with great dexterity, until some  one, less brave and more treacherous than the rest, took a station  unobserved on one side, and launched a spear, which went into his back  and there remained. Seeing this, they were proceeding a second time to  rush in upon him, when he had just strength enough left to make his  escape into an adjoining house, where he received shelter, and from the  severity of his wounds immediately fainted.    The spear was withdrawn, and his wounds dressed, by one of the surgeons  who happened to be present; and in a few days he was able to walk about  again. His brother, who had accompanied him to the field of battle, stood  up in his defence, and was wounded in the leg and thigh.    The principal sufferer in this affair was known in the settlement by the  name of William and Ann (corrupted by their pronunciation to  Wil-lam-an-nan) which he had adopted from a ship of the same name that  arrived here in the year 1791.    Several of their women attended upon this occasion, and, as is common  with them, howled and cried alternately during the most of the time; but  when they were enraged, which often happened, they danced, and beat their  sides with their arms; a certain proof of their passions being wrought up  to the highest pitch.    Shortly after this, these people again exhibited themselves to the notice  of the settlement, but in a very different point of view. On the 31st, an  open boat arrived from the Hawkesbury, with a cargo of Indian corn,  having been boarded in her passage down by a party of natives in canoes.  Assuming an appearance of friendship, they were suffered to come into the  boat, when, watching an opportunity, they threw off the mask, and made an  attempt to seize the small arms. This occasioned a struggle, in which the  boat's crew prevailed, but not before some of these unexpected pirates  had paid for their rashness with their lives.    It was now discovered, that a boat belonging to a settler, which had been  for some time missing, and was supposed to have been driven out to sea  and lost with her crew and cargo of Indian corn, had actually been taken  by the natives in the river, after murdering the men who were in her. The  boat, on searching, was afterwards found in the possession of some of  these people.    This was so novel a circumstance that it could scarcely be credited; but  it was no less true; and there was but little doubt, that the white  people who were living amongst them had been the unseen instigators of  this mischief.    During this month a strong and durable bridge, capable of sustaining any  weight which it might have occasion to bear, was erected over Duck river,  for the convenience of land carriage between the towns of Sydney and  Parramatta.    The military hospital which stood on the west side of the Cove was taken  to pieces; and, a stone foundation (it had been hitherto fixed on blocks  of wood) having been laid farther from the road side, it was removed  during this month, and put together again in its new situation.    The wheat every where wore the most promising appearance, and the weather  had been very favourable for bringing it to maturity.    Decreasing daily as did the number of working men in the employ of  government, yet the governor could not refuse granting certificates to  such convicts as had served their respective times of transportation; and  no less than 125 men were at this time certified by him to be free. Most  of these people had no other view in obtaining this certificate, than the  enabling them when an opportunity offered to quit the settlement, or  following their own pursuits until that time should arrive.    November.] There being a scarcity of wheat in the public stores, owing to  some local disappointments, the governor was obliged to make a reduction  in the weekly allowance of that article, until the present crops should  be gathered.    The facility with which the seizure of the _Cumberland_ had been  accomplished, and the subsequent escape of two parties of convicts.  induced 14 others to form a plan for taking away a boat, and making a  similar attempt at liberty. Having made a depot of all the stores which  they meant to carry with them, at a place convenient for the purpose, the  night was fixed for their departure; and they were on the point of  embarking, when, to their great surprise, they found themselves  surrounded by a party of magistrates and constables armed, who took them  and their property into custody. They had not proceeded with all the  caution necessary for such an enterprise, and a hint was given in time to  defeat the execution of their project.    The following day these unthinking people, instead of being at large on  the ocean, in possession of their fancied freedom, found themselves  severely punished, and sent up to Parramatta there to be set to hard  labour.    On the subject of these mad and hazardous schemes, the governor first  addressed the convicts in person, and afterwards published in order,  wherein he pointed out the risk that must ever attend such ill-judged  enterprises; into which, he was of opinion, a few weak and ignorant  people had been led by the deep and wicked designs of some who pretended  to a greater share of wisdom, and who would not hesitate to sacrifice any  that might be thought of less consequence to the general design, or less  capable of rendering themselves useful when embarked, by forcing them on  shore, if near the land, among a savage people where death must be  inevitable; or by throwing them overboard, if at sea, to lighten their  miserable vessel, and prevent, if possible, her drowning the whole.    The Irish convicts who arrived in the last ship manifesting daily a  propensity to desert from their work, a party of soldiers, under the  command of a sergeant, was sent up to Toongabbie, where they were to  remain during the harvest, which commenced in this month at that place  and at Constitution Hill.    On the 24th, an order was published, in which the people employed in  agriculture were reminded of the many accidents that happened last year  by fire; strongly recommending more attention to the security of their  present crops when taken off the ground, at the same time directing them  to seize and secure as early as possible all such vagrants as they might  meet with, who, being at large at this season, might do them much injury.    Nine hundred bushels of the last year's crop were brought round from the  Hawkesbury in the _Francis_, and deposited in the public store.  Nothing could promise better than the appearance of the wheat of this  season; but it had ripened suddenly, owing to some heavy rains having  been followed by very hot weather. In the want of sufficient strength the  military were hired to assist in reaping, it being absolutely necessary  that no time should be lost in securing the produce of this year.    Toward the latter end of the month, James Wilson, who had for some time  taken up his abode in the woods, and was one of those named in the  proclamation of the 13th of May last, surrendered himself to the  governor's clemency. He had been herding with the savages in different  parts of the country, and was obliged to submit to have his shoulders and  breast scarified after their manner; which he described to have been very  painful in the operation. He made his appearance with no other covering  than an apron formed of a Kangaroo's skin, which he had sufficient sense  of decency remaining to think was proper.    The governor, well knowing, from his former habits, that if he punished  and sent him to hard labour, he would quickly rejoin his late companions,  thought it more advisable to endeavour to make him useful even in the  mode of living which he seemed to prefer; he therefore pardoned him, and  proposed his attempting, with the assistance of his friends, to take some  of the convicts who were at large in the woods; two of whom had, just  before Wilson's appearance, stolen two mares, the property of private  individuals, but which were allowed to be kept during the night in a  stable belonging to government.    Wilson, among other articles of information, mentioned, that he had been  upwards of 100 miles in every direction round the settlement. In the  course of his travelling he had noticed several animals, which, from his  description, had not been seen in any of the districts; and to the  northwest of the head of the Hawkesbury, he came upon a very extensive  tract of open and well-watered country, where he had seen a bird of the  pheasant species, and a quadruped, which he said was larger than a dog,  having its hind parts thin, and bearing no proportion to the shoulders,  which were strong and large.    It is not improbable, that Wilson invented these circumstances in the  "]]]
