To kindle a  sense of physical beauty of form in every part, such as a sculptor  has, may be to start youth on the lowest round of the Platonic ladder  that leads up to the vision of ideal beauty of soul, if his ideal be  not excess of brawn, or mere brute strength, but the true proportion  represented by the classic or mean temperance balanced like justice  between all extremes. Hard, patient, regular work, with the right  dosage for this self-cultural end, has thus at the same time a unique  moral effect.    The dangers of this system are also obvious. Nature's intent can not  be too far thwarted; and as in mental training the question is always  pertinent, so here we may ask whether it be not best in all cases to  some extent, and in some cases almost exclusively, to develop in the  direction in which we most excel, to emphasize physical individuality  and even idiosyncrasy, rather than to strive for monotonous  uniformity. Weaknesses and parts that lag behind are the most easily  overworked to the point of reaction and perhaps permanent injury.  Again, work for curative purposes lacks the exuberance of free sports:  it is not inspiring to make up areas; and therapeutic exercises  imposed like a sentence for the shortcomings of our forebears bring a  whiff of the atmosphere of the hospital, if not of the prison, into  the gymnasium.    These four ideals, while so closely interrelated, are as yet far from  harmonized. Swedish, Turner, Sargent, and American systems are each,  most unfortunately, still too blind to the others' merits and too  conscious of the others' shortcomings. To some extent they are  prevented from getting together by narrow devotion to a single cult,  aided sometimes by a pecuniary interest in the sale of their own  apparatus and books or in the training of teachers according to one  set of rubrics. The real elephant is neither a fan, a rope, a tree nor  a log, as the blind men in the fable contended, each thinking the part  he had touched to be the whole. This inability of leaders to combine  causes uncertainty and lack of confidence in, and of enthusiastic  support for, any system on the part of the public. Even the radically  different needs of the sexes have failed of recognition from the same  partisanship. All together represent only a fraction of the nature and  needs of youth. The world now demands what this country has never had,  a man who, knowing the human body, gymnastic history, and the various  great athletic traditions of the past, shall study anew the whole  motor field, as a few great leaders early in the last century tried to  do; who shall gather and correlate the literature and experiences of  the past and present with a deep sense of responsibility to the  future; who shall examine martial training with all the inspirations,  warnings, and new demands; and who shall know how to revive the  inspiration of the past animated by the same spirit as the Turners,  who were almost inflamed by referring back to the hardy life of the  early Teutons and trying to reproduce its best features; who shall  catch the spirit of, and make due connections with, popular sports  past and present, study both industry and education to compensate  their debilitating effects, and be himself animated by a great ethical  and humanistic hope and faith in a better future. Such a man, if he  ever walks the earth, will be the idol of youth, will know their  physical secrets, will come almost as a savior to the bodies of men,  and will, like Jahn, feel his calling and work sacred, and his  institution a temple in which every physical act will be for the sake  of the soul. The world of adolescence, especially that part which sits  in closed spaces conning books, groans and travails all the more  grievously and yearningly, because unconsciously, waiting for a  redeemer for its body. Till he appears, our culture must remain for  most a little hollow, falsetto, and handicapped by school-bred  diseases. The modern gymnasium performs its chief service during  adolescence and is one of the most beneficent agencies of which not a  few, but every youth, should make large use. Its spirit should be  instinct with euphoria, where the joy of being alive reaches a point  of high, although not quite its highest, intensity. While the stimulus  of rivalry and even of records is not excluded, and social feelings  may be appealed to by unison exercises and by the club spirit, and  while competitions, tournaments, and the artificial motives of prizes  and exhibitions may be invoked, the culture is in fact largely  individual. And yet in this country the annual _Turnerfest_ brings  4,000 or 5,000 men from all parts of the Union, who sometimes all  deploy and go through some of the standard exercises together under  one leader. Instead of training a few athletes, the real problem now  presented is how to raise the general level of vitality so that  children and youth may be fitted to stand the strain of modern  civilization, resist zymotic diseases, and overcome the deleterious  influences of city life. The almost immediate effects of systematic  training are surprising and would hardly be inferred from the annual  increments tabled earlier in this chapter. Sandow was a rather weakly  boy and ascribes his development chiefly to systematic training.    We have space but for two reports believed to be typical. Enebuske  reports on the effects of seven months' training on young women  averaging 22.3 years. The figures are based on the 50 percentile  column.    ----------------+--------+----------------------------------+--------                  |        | Strength of                      |                  |Lung    |      |     |     |right  |left   |Total                  |capacity| legs |back |chest|forearm|forearm|Strength  ----------------+--------+------+-----+-----+-------+-------+--------  Before training |  2.65  |   93 |65.5 | 27  |  26   | 23    |  230  After six months|  2.87  |  120 |81.5 | 32  |  28   | 25    |  293  ----------------+--------+------+-----+-----+-------+-------+--------    By comparing records of what he deems standard normal growth with that  of 188 naval cadets from sixteen to twenty-one, who had special and  systematic training, just after the period of most rapid growth in  height, Beyer concluded that the effect of four years of this added a  little over an inch of stature, and that this gain as greatest at the  beginning. This increase was greatest for the youngest cadets. He  found also a marked increase in weight, nearly the same for each year  from seventeen to twenty one. This he thought more easily influenced  by exercise than height. A high vital index ratio of lung capacity to  weight is a very important attribute of good training. Beyer[1] found,  however, that the addition of lung area gained by exercise did not  keep up with the increase thus caused in muscular substance, and that  the vital index always became smaller in those who had gained weight  and strength by special physical training. How much gain in weight is  desirable beyond the point where the lung capacity increases at an  equal rate is unknown. If such measurements were applied to the  different gymnastic systems, we might be able to compare their  efficiency, which would be a great desideratum in view of the  unfortunate rivalry between them. Total strength, too, can be greatly  increased. Beyer thinks that from sixteen to twenty-one it may exceed  the average or normal increment fivefold, and he adds, \"I firmly  believe that the now so wonderful performances of most of our strong  men are well within the reach of the majority of healthy men, if such  performances were a serious enough part of their ambition  to make them do the exercises necessary to develop them.\" Power of the  organs to respond to good training by increased strength probably  reaches well into middle life.    It is not encouraging to learn that, according to a recent writer,[2]  we now have seventy times as many physicians in proportion to the  general population as there are physical directors, even for the  school population alone considered. We have twice as many physicians  per population as Great Britain, four times a many as Germany, or 2  physicians, 1.8 ministers, 1.4 lawyers per thousand of the general  population; while even if all male teachers of physical training  taught only males of the military age, we should have but 0.05 of a  teacher per thousand, or if the school population alone be considered,  20 teachers per million pupils. Hence, it is inferred that the need of  wise and classified teachers in this field is at present greater than  in any other. But fortunately while spontaneous, unsystematic exercise  in a well-equipped modern gymnasium may in rare cases do harm, so far  from sharing the prejudice often felt for it by professional trainers,  we believe that free access to it without control or direction is  unquestionably a boon to youth. Even if its use be sporadic and  occasional, as it is likely to be with equal opportunity for  out-of-door exercises and especially sports, practise is sometimes  hygienic almost inversely to its amount, while even lameness from  initial excess has its lessons, and the sense of manifoldness of  inferiorities brought home by experiences gives a wholesome  self-knowledge and stimulus.    In this country more than elsewhere, especially in high school and  college, gymnasium work has been brought into healthful connection  with field sports and record competitions for both teams and  individuals who aspire to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/92"],[0,"Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar (#13)"],[1,"the polished surface of the tiny  glass, the man's eyes shot back out of space to the mirror's face, and  in it he saw reflected the grim visage of Achmet Zek, framed in the  flaps of the tent doorway behind him.    Werper stifled a gasp of dismay.  With rare self-possession he let his  gaze drop, without appearing to have halted upon the mirror until it  rested again upon the gems.  Without haste, he replaced them in the  pouch, tucked the latter into his shirt, selected a cigaret from his  case, lighted it and rose.  Yawning, and stretching his arms above his  head, he turned slowly toward the opposite end of the tent.  The face  of Achmet Zek had disappeared from the opening.    To say that Albert Werper was terrified would be putting it mildly.  He  realized that he not only had sacrificed his treasure; but his life as  well.  Achmet Zek would never permit the wealth that he had discovered  to slip through his fingers, nor would he forgive the duplicity of a  lieutenant who had gained possession of such a treasure without  offering to share it with his chief.    Slowly the Belgian prepared for bed.  If he were being watched, he  could not know; but if so the watcher saw no indication of the nervous  excitement which the European strove to conceal.  When ready for his  blankets, the man crossed to the little table and extinguished the  light.    It was two hours later that the flaps at the front of the tent  separated silently and gave entrance to a dark-robed figure, which  passed noiselessly from the darkness without to the darkness within.  Cautiously the prowler crossed the interior.  In one hand was a long  knife.  He came at last to the pile of blankets spread upon several  rugs close to one of the tent walls.    Lightly, his fingers sought and found the bulk beneath the  blankets--the bulk that should be Albert Werper.  They traced out the  figure of a man, and then an arm shot upward, poised for an instant and  descended.  Again and again it rose and fell, and each time the long  blade of the knife buried itself in the thing beneath the blankets.  But there was an initial lifelessness in the silent bulk that gave the  assassin momentary wonder.  Feverishly he threw back the coverlets, and  searched with nervous hands for the pouch of jewels which he expected  to find concealed upon his victim's body.    An instant later he rose with a curse upon his lips.  It was Achmet  Zek, and he cursed because he had discovered beneath the blankets of  his lieutenant only a pile of discarded clothing arranged in the form  and semblance of a sleeping man--Albert Werper had fled.    Out into the village ran the chief, calling in angry tones to the  sleepy Arabs, who tumbled from their tents in answer to his voice.  But  though they searched the village again and again they found no trace of  the Belgian.  Foaming with anger, Achmet Zek called his followers to  horse, and though the night was pitchy black they set out to scour the  adjoining forest for their quarry.    As they galloped from the open gates, Mugambi, hiding in a nearby bush,  slipped, unseen, within the palisade.  A score of blacks crowded about  the entrance to watch the searchers depart, and as the last of them  passed out of the village the blacks seized the portals and drew them  to, and Mugambi lent a hand in the work as though the best of his life  had been spent among the raiders.    In the darkness he passed, unchallenged, as one of their number, and as  they returned from the gates to their respective tents and huts,  Mugambi melted into the shadows and disappeared.    For an hour he crept about in the rear of the various huts and tents in  an effort to locate that in which his master's mate was imprisoned.  One there was which he was reasonably assured contained her, for it was  the only hut before the door of which a sentry had been posted.  Mugambi was crouching in the shadow of this structure, just around the  corner from the unsuspecting guard, when another approached to relieve  his comrade.    \"The prisoner is safe within?\" asked the newcomer.    \"She is,\" replied the other, \"for none has passed this doorway since I  came.\"    The new sentry squatted beside the door, while he whom he had relieved  made his way to his own hut.  Mugambi slunk closer to the corner of the  building.  In one powerful hand he gripped a heavy knob-stick.  No sign  of elation disturbed his phlegmatic calm, yet inwardly he was aroused  to joy by the proof he had just heard that \"Lady\" really was within.    The sentry's back was toward the corner of the hut which hid the giant  black.  The fellow did not see the huge form which silently loomed  behind him.  The knob-stick swung upward in a curve, and downward  again.  There was the sound of a dull thud, the crushing of heavy bone,  and the sentry slumped into a silent, inanimate lump of clay.    A moment later Mugambi was searching the interior of the hut.  At first  slowly, calling, \"Lady!\" in a low whisper, and finally with almost  frantic haste, until the truth presently dawned upon him--the hut was  empty!          11    Tarzan Becomes a Beast Again      For a moment Werper had stood above the sleeping ape-man, his murderous  knife poised for the fatal thrust; but fear stayed his hand.  What if  the first blow should fail to drive the point to his victim's heart?  Werper shuddered in contemplation of the disastrous consequences to  himself.  Awakened, and even with a few moments of life remaining, the  giant could literally tear his assailant to pieces should he choose,  and the Belgian had no doubt but that Tarzan would so choose.    Again came the soft sound of padded footsteps in the reeds--closer this  time.  Werper abandoned his design.  Before him stretched the wide  plain and escape.  The jewels were in his possession.  To remain longer  was to risk death at the hands of Tarzan, or the jaws of the hunter  creeping ever nearer.  Turning, he slunk away through the night, toward  the distant forest.    Tarzan slept on.  Where were those uncanny, guardian powers that had  formerly rendered him immune from the dangers of surprise?  Could this  dull sleeper be the alert, sensitive Tarzan of old?    Perhaps the blow upon his head had numbed his senses, temporarily--who  may say?  Closer crept the stealthy creature through the reeds.  The  rustling curtain of vegetation parted a few paces from where the  sleeper lay, and the massive head of a lion appeared.  The beast  surveyed the ape-man intently for a moment, then he crouched, his hind  feet drawn well beneath him, his tail lashing from side to side.    It was the beating of the beast's tail against the reeds which awakened  Tarzan.  Jungle folk do not awaken slowly--instantly, full  consciousness and full command of their every faculty returns to them  from the depth of profound slumber.    Even as Tarzan opened his eyes he was upon his feet, his spear grasped  firmly in his hand and ready for attack.  Again was he Tarzan of the  Apes, sentient, vigilant, ready.    No two lions have identical characteristics, nor does the same lion  invariably act similarly under like circumstances.  Whether it was  surprise, fear or caution which prompted the lion crouching ready to  spring upon the man, is immaterial--the fact remains that he did not  carry out his original design, he did not spring at the man at all,  but, instead, wheeled and sprang back into the reeds as Tarzan arose  and confronted him.    The ape-man shrugged his broad shoulders and looked about for his  companion.  Werper was nowhere to be seen.  At first Tarzan suspected  that the man had been seized and dragged off by another lion, but upon  examination of the ground he soon discovered that the Belgian had gone  away alone out into the plain.    For a moment he was puzzled; but presently came to the conclusion that  Werper had been frightened by the approach of the lion, and had sneaked  off in terror.  A sneer touched Tarzan's lips as he pondered the man's  act--the desertion of a comrade in time of danger, and without warning.  Well, if that was the sort of creature Werper was, Tarzan wished  nothing more of him.  He had gone, and for all the ape-man cared, he  might remain away--Tarzan would not search for him.    A hundred yards from where he stood grew a large tree, alone upon the  edge of the reedy jungle.  Tarzan made his way to it, clambered into  it, and finding a comfortable crotch among its branches, reposed  himself for uninterrupted sleep until morning.    And when morning came Tarzan slept on long after the sun had risen.  His mind, reverted to the primitive, was untroubled by any more serious  obligations than those of providing sustenance, and safeguarding his  life.  Therefore, there was nothing to awaken for until danger  threatened, or the pangs of hunger assailed.  It was the latter which  eventually aroused him.    Opening his eyes, he stretched his giant thews, yawned, rose and gazed  about him through the leafy foliage of his retreat.  Across the wasted  meadowlands and fields of John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, Tarzan of the  Apes looked, as a stranger, upon the moving figures of Basuli and his  braves as they prepared their morning meal and made ready to set out  upon the expedition which Basuli had planned after discovering the  havoc and disaster which had befallen the estate of his dead master.    The ape-man eyed the blacks with curiosity.  In the back of his brain  loitered a fleeting sense of familiarity with all that he saw, yet he  could not connect any of the various forms of life, animate and  inanimate, which had fallen within the range of his vision since he had  emerged from the darkness of the pits of Opar, with any particular  event of the past.    Hazily he recalled a grim and hideous form, hairy, ferocious.  A vague  tenderness dominated his savage sentiments as this phantom memory  struggled for recognition.  His mind had reverted to his childhood"]]]
