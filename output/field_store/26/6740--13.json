But they did not agree to introduce slavery in regions  where it did not previously exist. On the contrary, they said by their  example and teachings that they did not deem it expedient--did not  consider it right--to do so; and it is wise and right to do just as they  did about it [Voices: \"Good!\"], and that is what we propose--not to  interfere with slavery where it exists (we have never tried to do it),  and to give them a reasonable and efficient fugitive slave law. [A  voice: \"No!\"] I say YES! [Applause.] It was part of the bargain, and I'm  for living up to it; but I go no further; I'm not bound to do more, and  I won't agree any further. [Great applause.]    We, here in Illinois, should feel especially proud of the provision of  the Missouri Compromise excluding slavery from what is now Kansas; for  an Illinois man, Jesse B. Thomas, was its father. Henry Clay, who is  credited with the authorship of the Compromise in general terms, did not  even vote for that provision, but only advocated the ultimate admission  by a second compromise; and, Thomas was, beyond all controversy, the  real author of the \"slavery restriction\" branch of the Compromise. To  show the generosity of the Northern members toward the Southern side; on  a test vote to exclude slavery from Missouri, ninety voted not to  exclude, and eighty-seven to exclude, every vote from the slave States  being ranged with the former and fourteen votes from the free States,  of whom seven were from New England alone; while on a vote to exclude  slavery from what is now Kansas, the vote was one hundred and  thirty-four _for_ to forty-two _against_. The scheme, as a whole, was,  of course, a Southern triumph. It is idle to contend otherwise, as is  now being done by the Nebraskaites; it was so shown by the votes and  quite as emphatically by the expressions of representative men. Mr.  Lowndes of South Carolina was never known to commit a political mistake;  his was the great judgment of that section; and he declared that this  measure \"would restore tranquillity to the country--a result demanded by  every consideration of discretion, of moderation, of wisdom, and of  virtue.\" When the measure came before President Monroe for his approval,  he put to each member of his cabinet this question: \"Has Congress the  constitutional power to prohibit slavery in a territory?\" And John C.  Calhoun and William H. Crawford from the South, equally with John Quincy  Adams, Benjamin Rush, and Smith Thompson from the North, alike answered,  \"_Yes!_\" without qualification or equivocation; and this measure, of so  great consequence to the South, was passed; and Missouri was, by means  of it, finally enabled to knock at the door of the Republic for an open  passage to its brood of slaves. And, in spite of this, Freedom's share  is about to be taken by violence--by the force of misrepresentative  votes, not called for by the popular will. What name can I, in common  decency, give to this wicked transaction? [Sensation.]    But even then the contest was not over; for when the Missouri  constitution came before Congress for its approval, it forbade any free  negro or mulatto from entering the State. In short, our Illinois \"black  laws\" were hidden away in their constitution [Laughter], and the  controversy was thus revived. Then it was that Mr. Clay's talents shone  out conspicuously, and the controversy that shook the Union to its  foundation was finally settled to the satisfaction of the conservative  parties on both sides of the line, though not to the extremists on  either, and Missouri was admitted by the small majority of six in the  lower House. How great a majority, do you think, would have been given  had Kansas also been secured for slavery? [A voice: \"A majority the  other way.\"] \"A majority the other way,\" is answered. Do you think it  would have been safe for a Northern man to have confronted his  constituents after having voted to consign both Missouri and Kansas to  hopeless slavery? And yet this man Douglas, who misrepresents his  constituents, and who has exerted his highest talents in that direction,  will be carried in triumph through the State, and hailed with honour  while applauding that act. [Three groans for \"_Dug_!\"] And this shows  whither we are tending. This thing of slavery is more powerful than its  supporters--even than the high priests that minister at its altar. It  debauches even our greatest men. It gathers strength, like a rolling  snow-ball, by its own infamy. Monstrous crimes are committed in its name  by persons collectively which they would not dare to commit as  individuals. Its aggressions and encroachments almost surpass belief. In  a despotism, one might not wonder to see slavery advance steadily and  remorselessly into new dominions; but is it not wonderful, is it not  even alarming, to see its steady advance in a land dedicated to the  proposition that \"all men are created equal\"? [Sensation.]    It yields nothing itself; it keeps all it has, and gets all it can  besides. It really came dangerously near securing Illinois in 1824; it  did get Missouri in 1821. The first proposition was to admit what is now  Arkansas _and_ Missouri as one slave State. But the territory was  divided, and Arkansas came in, without serious question, as a slave  State; and afterward Missouri, not as a sort of equality, _free_, but  also as a slave State. Then we had Florida and Texas; and now Kansas is  about to be forced into the dismal procession. [Sensation.] And so it is  wherever you look. We have not forgotten--it is but six years since--how  dangerously near California came to being a slave State. Texas is a  slave State, and four other slave States may be carved from its vast  domain. And yet, in the year 1829, slavery was abolished throughout  that vast region by a royal decree of the then sovereign of Mexico. Will  you please tell me by what _right_ slavery exists in Texas to-day? By  the same right as, and no higher or greater than, slavery is seeking  dominion in Kansas: by political force--peaceful, if that will suffice;  by the torch (as in Kansas) and the bludgeon (as in the Senate chamber),  if required. And so history repeats itself; and even as slavery has kept  its course by craft, intimidation, and violence in the past, so it will  persist, in my judgment, until met and dominated by the will of a people  bent on its restriction.    We have, this very afternoon, heard bitter denunciations of Brooks in  Washington, and Titus, Stringfellow, Atchison, Jones, and Shannon in  Kansas--the battle-ground of slavery. I certainly am not going to  advocate or shield them; but they and their acts are but the necessary  outcome of the Nebraska law. We should reserve our highest censure for  the authors of the mischief, and not for the catspaws which they use. I  believe it was Shakespeare who said, \"Where the offence lies, there let  the axe fall;\" and, in my opinion, this man Douglas and the Northern men  in Congress who advocate \"Nebraska\" are more guilty than a thousand  Joneses and Stringfellows, with all their murderous practices, can be.  [Applause.]    We have made a good beginning here to-day. As our Methodist friends  would say, \"I feel it is good to be here.\" While extremists may find  some fault with the moderation of our platform, they should recollect  that \"the battle is not always to the strong, nor the race to the  swift.\" In grave emergencies, moderation is generally safer than  radicalism: and as this struggle is likely to be long and earnest, we  must not, by our action, repel any who are in sympathy with us in the  main, but rather win all that we can to our standard. We must not  belittle nor overlook the facts of our condition--that we are new and  comparatively weak, while our enemies are entrenched and relatively  strong. They have the administration and the political power; and, right  or wrong, at present they have the numbers. Our friends who urge an  appeal to arms with so much force and eloquence, should recollect that  the government is arrayed against us, and that the numbers are now  arrayed against us as well; or, to state it nearer to the truth, they  are not yet expressly and affirmatively for us; and we should repel  friends rather than gain them by anything savouring of revolutionary  methods. As it now stands, we must appeal to the sober sense and  patriotism of the people. We will make converts day by day; we will grow  strong by calmness and moderation; we will grow strong by the violence  and injustice of our adversaries. And, unless truth be a mockery and  justice a hollow lie, we will be in the majority after a while, and then  the revolution which we will accomplish will be none the less radical  from being the result of pacific measures. The battle of freedom is to  be fought out on principle. Slavery is a violation of the eternal right.  We have temporized with it from the necessities of our condition; but  _as sure as God reigns and school children read_, THAT BLACK FOUL LIE  CAN NEVER BE CONSECRATED INTO GOD'S HALLOWED TRUTH! [Immense applause  lasting some time.] One of our greatest difficulties is, that men who  _know_ that slavery is a detestable crime and ruinous to the nation, are  compelled, by our peculiar condition and other circumstances, to  advocate it concretely, though damning it in the raw. Henry Clay was a  brilliant example of this tendency; others of our purest statesmen are  compelled to do so; and thus slavery secures actual support from those  who detest it at heart. Yet Henry Clay perfected and forced through the  Compromise which secured to slavery a great State as well as a political  advantage. Not that he hated slavery less, but that he loved the whole  Union more. As long as slavery profited by his great Compromise, the  hosts of pro-slavery could not sufficiently cover him with praise; but  now that this Compromise stands in their way--         "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14742"],[0,"Vanishing England (#14)"],[1,"\"Paradise  Regained,\" and that the draft of the latter poem was written upon a  great oak table which may be seen in one of the low-pitched rooms on  the ground floor. I fancy that Milton must have beautified and  repaired the cottage at the period of his tenancy. The mantelpiece  with its classic ogee moulding belongs certainly to his day, and some  other minor details may also be noticed which support this inference.  It is not difficult to imagine that one who was accustomed to  metropolitan comforts would be dissatisfied with the open hearth  common to country cottages of that poet's time, and have it enclosed  in the manner in which we now see it. Outside the garden is brilliant  with old-fashioned flowers, such as the poet loved. A stone scutcheon  may be seen peeping through the shrubbery which covers the front of  the cottage, but the arms which it displays are those of the  Fleetwoods, one time owners of these tenements. Between the years 1709  and 1807 the house was used as an inn. Milton's cottage is one of our  national treasures, which (though not actually belonging to the  nation) has successfully resisted purchase by our American cousins and  transportation across the Atlantic.    [Illustration: A Portsmouth \"Row\"]    The entrance to the churchyard in Chalfont St. Giles is through a  wonderfully picturesque turnstile or lich-gate under an ancient house  in the High Street. The gate formerly closed itself mechanically by  means of a pulley to which was attached a heavy weight. Unfortunately  this weight was not boxed in--as in the somewhat similar example at  Hayes, in Middlesex--and an accident which happened to some children  resulted in its removal.    [Illustration: Lich-gate, Chalfont St. Giles, Bucks]    A good many picturesque old houses remain in the village, among them  being one called Stonewall Farm, a structure of the fifteenth century  with an original billet-moulded porch and Gothic barge-boards.    There is a certain similarity about the villages that dot the Vale of  Aylesbury. The old Market House is usually a feature of the High  Street--where it has not been spoilt as at Wendover. Groups of  picturesque timber cottages, thickest round the church, and shouldered  here and there by their more respectable and severe Georgian brethren,  are common to all, and vary but little in their general aspect and  colouring. Memories and legends haunt every hamlet, the very names of  which have an ancient sound carrying us vaguely back to former days.  Prince's Risborough, once a manor of the Black Prince; Wendover, the  birthplace of Roger of Wendover, the medieval historian, and author of  the Chronicle _Flores Historiarum, or History of the World from the  Creation to the year 1235_, in modern language a somewhat \"large  order\"; Hampden, identified to all time with the patriot of that name;  and so on indefinitely. At Monk's Risborough, another hamlet with an  ancient-sounding name, but possessing no special history, is a church  of the Perpendicular period containing some features of exceptional  interest, and internally one of the most charmingly picturesque of its  kind. The carved tie-beams of the porch with their masks and tracery  and the great stone stoup which appears in one corner have an  _unrestored_ appearance which is quite delightful in these days of  over-restoration. The massive oak door has some curious iron fittings,  and the interior of the church itself displays such treasures as a  magnificent early Tudor roof and an elegant fifteenth-century  chancel-screen, on the latter of which some remains of ancient  painting exist.[15]      [15] The rood-loft has unfortunately disappeared.    [Illustration: Fifteenth-century Handle on Church Door, Monk's  Risborough, Bucks]    Thame, just across the Oxfordshire border, is another town of the  greatest interest. The noble parish church here contains a number of  fine brasses and tombs, including the recumbent effigies of Lord John  Williams of Thame and his wife, who flourished in the reign of Queen  Mary. The chancel-screen is of uncommon character, the base being  richly decorated with linen panelling, while above rises an arcade in  which Gothic form mingles freely with the grotesqueness of the  Renaissance. The choir-stalls are also lavishly ornamented with the  linen-fold decoration.    The centre of Thame's broad High Street is narrowed by an island of  houses, once termed Middle Row, and above the jumble of tiled roofs  here rises like a watch-tower a most curious and interesting medieval  house known as the \"Bird Cage Inn.\" About this structure little is  known; it is, however, referred to in an old document as the \"tenement  called the Cage, demised to James Rosse by indenture for the term of  100 years, yielding therefor by the year 8s.,\" and appears to have  been a farm-house. The document in question is a grant of Edward IV to  Sir John William of the Charity or Guild of St. Christopher in Thame,  founded by Richard Quartemayne, _Squier_, who died in the year 1460.  This house, though in some respects adapted during later years from  its original plan, is structurally but little altered, and should be  taken in hand and _intelligently_ restored as an object of local  attraction and interest. The choicest oaks of a small forest must have  supplied its framework, which stands firm as the day when it was  built. The fine corner-posts (now enclosed) should be exposed to view,  and the mullioned windows which jut out over a narrow passage should  be opened up. If this could be done--and not overdone--the \"Bird Cage\"  would hardly be surpassed as a miniature specimen of medieval timber  architecture in the county. A stone doorway of Gothic form and a kind  of almery or safe exist in its cellars.    A school was founded at Thame by Lord John Williams, whose recumbent  effigy exists in the church, and amongst the students there during the  second quarter of the seventeenth century was Anthony Wood, the Oxford  antiquary. Thame about this time was the centre of military operations  between the King's forces and the rebels, and was continually being  beaten up by one side or the other. Wood, though but a boy at the  time, has left on record in his narrative some vivid impressions of  the conflicts which he personally witnessed, and which bring the  disjointed times before us in a vision of strange and absolute  reality.    He tells of Colonel Blagge, the Governor of Wallingford Castle, who  was on a marauding expedition, being chased through the streets of  Thame by Colonel Crafford, who commanded the Parliamentary garrison at  Aylesbury, and how one man fell from his horse, and the Colonel \"held  a pistol to him, but the trooper cried 'Quarter!' and the rebels came  up and rifled him and took him and his horse away with them.\" On  another occasion, just as a company of Roundhead soldiers were sitting  down to dinner, a Cavalier force appeared \"to beat up their quarters,\"  and the Roundheads retired in a hurry, leaving \"A.W. and the  schoolboyes, sojourners in the house,\" to enjoy their venison pasties.    He tells also of certain doings at the Nag's Head, a house that still  exists--a very ancient hostelry, though not nearly so old a building  as the Bird Cage Inn. The sign is no longer there, but some  interesting features remain, among them the huge strap hinges on the  outer door, fashioned at their extremities in the form of  fleurs-de-lis. We should like to linger long at Thame and describe the  wonders at Thame Park, with its remains of a Cistercian abbey and the  fine Tudor buildings of Robert King, last abbot and afterward the  first Bishop of Oxford. The three fine oriel windows and stair-turret,  the noble Gothic dining-hall and abbot's parlour panelled with oak in  the style of the linen pattern, are some of the finest Tudor work in  the country. The Prebendal house and chapel built by Grossetete are  also worthy of the closest attention. The chapel is an architectural  gem of Early English design, and the rest of the house with its later  Perpendicular windows is admirable. Not far away is the interesting  village of Long Crendon, once a market-town, with its fine church and  its many picturesque houses, including Staple Hall, near the church,  with its noble hall, used for more than five centuries as a manorial  court-house on behalf of various lords of the manor, including Queen  Katherine, widow of Henry V. It has now fortunately passed into the  care of the National Trust, and its future is secured for the benefit  of the nation. The house is a beautiful half-timbered structure, and  was in a terribly dilapidated condition. It is interesting both  historically and architecturally, and is note-worthy as illustrating  the continuity of English life, that the three owners from whom the  Trust received the building, Lady Kinloss, All Souls' College, and the  Ecclesiastical Commissioners, are the successors in title of three  daughters of an Earl of Pembroke in the thirteenth century. It is  fortunate that the old house has fallen into such good hands. The  village has a Tudor manor-house which has been restored.    Another court-house, that at Udimore, in Sussex, near Rye, has, we  believe, been saved by the Trust, though the owner has retained  possession. It is a picturesque half-timbered building of two storeys  with modern wings projecting at right angles at each end. The older  portion is all that remains of a larger house which appears to have  been built in the fifteenth century. The manor belonged to the Crown,  and it is said that both Edward I and Edward III visited it. The  building was in a very dilapidated condition, and the owner intended  to destroy it and replace it with modern cottages. We hope that this  scheme has now been abandoned, and that the old house is safe for many  years to come.
