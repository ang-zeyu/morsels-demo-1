Consequently, seventy trials were required for the solution of the  problem. This number is in marked contrast with Skirrl's one hundred and  thirty-two trials.    Immediately following the first perfect series, Sobke was given two  series of control tests on April 28. Conditions were unfavorable, since  the day was stormy and the rain pattering on the sheet-iron roof made a  great din. Nevertheless, he worked steadily and well up to the sixth  trial, which was preceded by a slight delay because of the necessity of  refilling some of the food boxes. After this interruption, wrong choices  occurred in trial 6. And again after trial 9, there was brief  interruption, followed by wrong choices in trial 10. The ratio of right  to wrong choices for this first control series was therefore 1 to .25.

From the results of these two control series, it is  evident that Sobke's solution of problem 1 is reasonably adequate. He is  easily diverted or disturbed in his work by any unusual circumstances,  but so long as everything goes smoothly, he chooses with ease and  certainty. Whether it is fair to describe the behavior as involving an  idea of the relation of the right box to the other members of the group  would be difficult to decide. I hesitate to infer definite ideation from  the available evidence, but I strongly suspect the presence of images  and relatively ineffective or inadequate ideation.    It is perfectly evident that Sobke is much more intelligent than Skirrl.  In practically every respect, he adapted himself more quickly to the  experimental procedure and progressed more steadily toward the solution  of the problem than did Skirrl. The contrast in the learning processes  of the two monkeys could scarcely be better exhibited than by the curves  of learning which are presented in figure 18. The first, that for Sobke,  is surprisingly regular; the second, that for Skirrl, is quite as  surprisingly irregular. These results correlate perfectly with the  steadiness and predictability of the former's responses and the  irregularity and erraticness of the latter's.      _Problem 2. Second from the Right End_    On the completion of problem 1 Sobke was in perfect condition, as to  health and training, for experimental work. He had come to work quietly,  fairly deliberately, and very steadily. His timidity had diminished and  he would readily come to the experimenter for food, although still he  was somewhat distrustful at times and became timid when anything unusual  occurred in the apparatus.    As preparation for problem 2, a break in regular experimentation  covering four days followed the control series of problem 1. On each of  these four days the monkey was allowed to get food once from each of the  nine boxes, both doors of a given box being open for the trial and all  other doors closed. For this feeding experiment, the doors were opened  in irregular order, and this order was changed from day to day.    Systematic work with problem 2 began on May 3, with punishment of thirty  seconds for mistakes and a liberal reward of food for each success.  Early in the series of trials it was discovered that Sobke was likely to  become discouraged and waste a great deal of time unless certain aid  were given by the experimenter. On this account, after the first two  trials, the method was adopted of punishing the animal by confinement  for the first ten mistakes in a trial, and of then, if need be,  indicating the right box by slightly and momentarily raising the exit  door. Every trial in which aid was thus given by the experimenter is  indicated in table 5 by an asterisk following the last choice. In the  first series of trials for this problem, aid had to be given in seven of  the ten trials, and even so the series occupied seventy-one minutes. It  is possible that had no aid been given, the work might have been  continued successfully with a smaller number of trials than ten per day.  But under the circumstances it seemed wiser to avoid the risk of  discouraging and thus spoiling the animal for use in the experiment. It  should be stated, also, that it proved impossible to adhere to the  period of thirty seconds as punishment in this series. For the majority  of the wrong choices confinement of not more than ten seconds was used.    For the second series, given on May 4, the conditions were unfavorable  in that it was dark and rainy, and the noise of the rain on the roof  frightened Sobke. He refused to work after the fourth trial, and the  series had to be completed on the following day. The total time required  for this series was seventy-eight minutes.    The work on May 6 was distinctly better, and the animal's behavior  indicated, in a number of trials, definite recognition of the right  door. He might, for example, make a number of incorrect choices, then  pause for a few seconds to look steadily at the doors, and having  apparently found some cue, run directly to the right box. No aid from  the experimenter was needed in this series.    On the following day improvement continued and the animal's method of  choosing became definite and fairly precise. He was deliberate, quiet,  and extremely business-like. The time for the series was thirty-one  minutes.    The period of punishment was increased on May 12 "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10852"],[0,"Hardy Ornamental Flowering Trees and Shrubs (#14)"],[1,"these are scarce. Usually  the flowering time is in August, but frequently in the first weeks of  October the pretty flowers are still full of beauty. It is of bushy  habit, from 4 feet to 5 feet high, with oblong leaflets, in number from  twenty to thirty-five, which are Pea-green above and downy on the under  sides. Flowers bright red, and produced in axillary racemes. It is  perfectly hardy, and grows freely in porous decomposed leaf-soil.      HELIANTHEMUM.    HELIANTHEMUM HALIMIFOLIUM.--Spain, 1656. This species is of erect habit,  3 feet or 4 feet high, and with leaves reminding one of those of the Sea  Purslane. It is an evergreen, and has large bright yellow flowers,  slightly spotted at the base of the petals.    H. LAEVIPES (_syn Cistus laevipes_).--South-western Europe. A dwarf  shrub, with Heath-like leaves, and yellow flowers that are produced in  great abundance.    H. LASIANTHUM (_syns H. formosum_ and _Cistus formosus_).--Spain and  Portugal, 1780. This is a beautiful species, but not hardy unless in the  South and West. It has large, bright yellow flowers, with a deep  reddish-purple blotch at the base of each petal.    H. LAVENDULAEFOLIUM has lavender-like leaves, with the under surface  hoary, and yellow flowers. A native of the Mediterranean regions.    H. LIBONATES.--This species bears dark green Rosemary-like leaves, and  yellow flowers that are produced very abundantly. South Europe.    H. PILOSUM.--South of France, 1831. This bears white flowers that are of  good substance, and about an inch across.    H. POLIFOLIUM (_syn H. pulverulentum_).--Europe (Britain), and North  Africa. This is a neat-growing shrub, of very dwarf growth, with hairy  leaves and yellow flowers; and H. polifolium roseum, has pretty rosy-red  flowers.    H. UMBELLATUM.--South Europe, 1731. A neat, small-growing species, with  white flowers and glossy-green leaves covered with a rusty-white  tomentum beneath.    H. VULGARE.--Common Rock Rose. Europe (Britain), North Africa, and West  Asia. A widely distributed native plant, of dwarf growth, with  linear-oblong, hairy leaves, and usually yellow flowers. H. vulgare  nummularium differs in having the leaves green and sub-orbicular, with  yellow flowers. H. vulgare barbaturn is of erect habit, with silky,  hairy, oval leaves. H. vulgare mutabile bears pale rose flowers, marked  with yellow at the base. H. vulgare grandiflorum is remarkable for the  large, bright yellow flowers, and is one of the most beautiful and  worthy varieties. H. vulgare ovalifolium (_syn H. serpyllifolium_) bears  yellow flowers and ovate leaves, with the margins revolute. H. vulgare  hyssopifolium bears reddish flowers, but the colouring varies  considerably, and saffron is not uncommon.    The Rockroses are very valuable plants, in that they will succeed on  poor, gravelly banks where few other plants could eke out an existence.  They cannot withstand stiff soil, nor that at all inclined to be damp,  their favourite resorts being exposed, rocky ground, and dry, gravelly  banks. Being readily increased from cuttings, which take root well under  a hand glass or in a cool house, it is advisable, at least with the more  tender forms, to have at hand a stock, so that blanks in the shrubbery  may be filled up.      HIBISCUS.    HIBISCUS SYRIACUS (_syn Althaea frutex_).--Syrian Mallow. Syria, 1596.  An old occupant of our gardens, and one that cannot be too freely  cultivated. When favourably situated, it often reaches 6 feet in height,  with three-lobed, neatly-toothed leaves, and with large, showy blossoms  that are borne towards the end of summer. The typical species has  purplish flowers, with a crimson spot at the base of each petal, but  others, varying in colour from snow-white to purple and blue, are common  in cultivation. H. syriacus coelestis bears bright blue flowers, while  H. syriacus variegatus has beautifully variegated foliage. Of the  double-flowered forms, there are several beautiful and worthy plants,  the following list containing some of the best varieties of this popular  shrub:--    H. syriacus albo-pleno.      \"       amaranthus.      \"       amplissima.      \"       ardens.      \"       caerulea plena.      \"       carnea plena.      \"       De la Veuve.      \"       elegantissimum.      \"       fastuosa.      \"       Lady Stanley.      \"       Leopoldii.      \"       lilacina plena.      \"       paeoniaeflora.      \"       puniceus plenus.      \"       rosea plena.      \"       rubra plena.      \"       spectabilis plena.      \"       violacea.      HIPPOPHAE.    HIPPOPHAE RHAMNOIDES.--Sea Buckthorn, or Sallow Thorn. Though generally  considered as a sea-side shrub, the Sea Buckthorn is by no means  exclusively so, thriving well, and attaining to large dimensions, in  many inland situations. The flowers are not at all conspicuous, but this  is amply compensated for by the beautiful silvery-like leaves and wealth  of fruit borne by the shrub. In not a few instances, for fully a foot in  length, the branches are smothered with crowded clusters of bright  orange berries, and which render the shrub during November and December  both distinct and effective. It does best in sandy soil, and is readily  increased from suckers, which are usually plentifully produced by old  plants. For sea-side planting it is one of our most valuable shrubs,  succeeding, as it does, well down even to high water mark, and where the  foliage is lashed with the salt spray.      HOLBOELLIA.    HOLBOELLIA LATIFOLIA (_syn Stauntonia latifolia_).--Himalayas, 1840. An  evergreen climbing shrub that is more often found under glass than out  of doors. In the South of England, however, it is quite hardy against a  sunny wall. It grows 12 feet high, with shining green leathery leaves,  and fragrant purplish-green flowers. H. latifolia angustifolia has  decidedly narrower leaves than the species, but is in no other way  different.      HYDRANGEA.    HYDRANGEA ARBORESCENS.--North America, 1736. This is a plant of large  growth, but the flowers are greenish-white, and by no means conspicuous.    H. HORTENSIS (_syn Hortensia opuloides_).--China, 1790. This is an  old-fashioned garden shrub that is only hardy in the south and west of  these islands and in the vicinity of the sea. In some of the forms  nearly all the flowers are sterile, the calyx-lobes being greatly  expanded, and in others the outer flowers only are sterile. According to  the nature of the soil the flowers vary much in colour, some being pure  white, others pink, and others of varying shades of blue. There are some  very beautiful and distinct varieties, such as H. hortensis japonica; H.  hortensis Otaksa, with large panicles of sterile blue flowers; H.  hortensis rosea-alba, with large rosy flowers; H. hortensis Thomas Hogg,  a very free-flowering and welcome form; H. hortensis mandschurica, and  H. hortensis stellata flore-pleno, with partially double flowers, are  worthy of attention.    H. PANICULATA.--Japan, 1874. This is one of the most distinct species,  in which the flower-heads are elongated, not flat, as in most other  species, and from which the finest form in cultivation has been  obtained. This is H. paniculata grandiflora, in which the flowers are  sterile and pure white, forming large panicles often a foot in length.  It is a magnificent variety, and, being perfectly hardy, should be  extensively planted for ornament. The flowers are produced in late  summer, but remain in good form for fully two months, dying off a rich  reddish hue.    H. QUERCIFOLIA.--Oak-leaved Hydrangea. Florida, 1803. This species has  neatly lobed leaves, and terminal panicles of pinky-white, but partially  barren, flowers.    H. SCANDENS.--Climbing Hydrangea. Japan, 1879. This is not very hardy,  but with the protection of a sunny wall it grows freely.    The Hydrangeas require a rich, loamy soil, and, unless in maritime  districts, a warm and sheltered situation. They are readily propagated  by means of cuttings.      HYMENANTHERA.    HYMENANTHERA CRASSIFOLIA.--A curious New Zealand shrub with rigid  ashy-coloured branches, and small leathery leaves. The flowers are  violet-like in colour, but by no means conspicuous. The small white  berries which succeed the flowers are, in autumn, particularly  attractive, and very ornamental. It is perfectly hardy and of free  growth in light peaty earth.      HYPERICUM.    HYPERICUM ANDROSAEMUM.--Tutsan, or Sweet Amber. Europe (Britain). A  pretty native species, growing about 2 feet high, with ovate leaves  having glandular dots and terminal clustered cymes of yellow flowers.    H. AUREUM.--South Carolina and Georgia, 1882. This soon forms a neat and  handsome plant. The flowers are unusually large, and remarkable for the  tufts of golden-yellow stamens with which they are furnished.    H. CALYCINUM.--Aaron's Beard, or Rose of Sharon. South-east Europe. This  is a well-known native species of shrubby growth, bearing large yellow  flowers from 3 inches to 4 inches in diameter. It is a prostrate plant,  with coriaceous glossy leaves with small pellucid dots, and of great  value for planting in the shade.    H. ELATUM is a spreading species from North America (1762), growing to  fully 4 feet in height, and bearing terminal corymbs of large, bright  yellow flowers in July and August. Leaves rather large, oblong-ovate,  and revolute. On account of its spreading rapidly from the root, this  species requires to be planted where it will have plenty of room.    H. HIRCINUM.--Goat-scented St. John's Wort. Mediterranean region, 1640.  A small-growing and slender species, with oblong-lanceolate leaves 2  inches long, and producing small yellow flowers in terminal heads. There  is a smaller growing form known as H. hircinum minus. The plant emits a  peculiar goat-like odour.    H. MOSERIANUM is a beautiful hybrid form with red anthers.    H. OBLONGIFOLIUM (_syns H. Hookerianum_ and _H. nepalensis_).--Nepaul,  1823. An"]]]
