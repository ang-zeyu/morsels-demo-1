Pleading indisposition, which was fully  justified by her pallid features, she soon after withdrew.    When on the following day Giovanna'a servant announced the Counts  Selka and Roszynski, a peculiar smile played on her lips, and when  they entered, she received the latter with the cold and formal  politeness of a stranger. Controlling the feelings of her heart,  she schooled her features to an expression of indifference. It was  manifest from Leon's manner, that without the remotest recognition, an  indefinable presentiment regarding her possessed him. The Counts had  called to know if Giovanna had recovered from her indisposition. Leon  begged to be permitted to call again.    Where was his wife? why did he never mention her? Giovanna continually  asked herself these questions when they had departed.    A few nights after, the Count Leon arrived sad and thoughtful. He  prevailed on Giovanna to sing one of her Polish melodies; which she  told him had been taught, when a child, by her muse. Roszynski, unable  to restrain the expression of an intense admiration he had long felt,  frantically seized her hand, and exclaimed, \"I love you!\"    She withdrew it from his grasp, remained silent for a few minutes,  and then said slowly, distinctly, and ironically, \"But I do not love  _you_, Count Roszynski.\"    Leon rose from his seat. He pressed his hands to his brow, and was  silent. Giovanna remained calm and tranquil. \"It is a penalty from  Heaven,\" continued Leon, as if speaking to himself, \"for not having  fulfilled my duty as a husband toward one whom I chose voluntarily,  but without reflection. I wronged her, and am punished.\"    Giovanna turned her eyes upon him. Leon continued, \"Young, and with  a heart untouched, I married a princess about ten years older than  myself, of eccentric habits and bad temper. She treated me as an  inferior. She dissipated the fortune hoarded up with so much care by  my parents, and yet was ashamed on account of my origin to be called  by my name. Happily for me, she was fond of visiting and amusements.  Otherwise, to escape from her, I might have become a gambler, or  worse; but, to avoid meeting her, I remained at home--for there she  seldom was. At first from ennui, but afterward from real delight in  the occupation, I gave myself up to study. Reading formed my mind and  heart. I became a changed being. Some months ago my father died, my  sister went to Lithuania, whilst my mother, in her old age, and with  her ideas, was quite incapable of understanding my sorrow. So when my  wife went to the baths for the benefit of her ruined health, I came  here in the hope of meeting with some of my former friends--I saw  you--\"    Giovanna blushed like one detected; but speedily recovering herself,  asked with calm pleasantry, \"Surely you do not number _me_ among your  former friends?\"    \"I know not. I have been bewildered. It is strange; but from the  moment that I saw you at Count Selka's, a powerful instinct of love  overcame me; not a new feeling; but as if some latent, long-hid,  undeveloped sentiment had suddenly burst forth into an uncontrollable  passion. I love, I adore you. I--\"    The Prima Donna interrupted him--not with speech, but with a look  which awed, which chilled him. Pride, scorn, irony sat in her smile.  Satire darted from her eyes. After a pause, she repeated slowly and  pointedly, \"Love _me_, Count Roszynski?\"    \"Such is my destiny,\" he replied. \"Nor, despite your scorn, will I  struggle against it. I feel it is my fate ever to love you; I fear it  is my fate never to be loved by you. It is dreadful.\"    Giovanna witnessed the Count's emotion with sadness. \"To have,\" she  said mournfully, \"one's first, pure, ardent, passionate affection  unrequited, scorned, made a jest of, is indeed a bitterness, almost  equal to that of death.\"    She made a strong effort to conceal her emotion. Indeed she controlled  it so well as to speak the rest with a sort of gayety.    \"You have at least been candid, Count Roszynski; I will imitate you  by telling a little history that occurred in your country. There was  a poor girl born and bred a serf to her wealthy lord and master. When  scarcely fifteen years old, she was torn from a state of happy rustic  freedom--the freedom of humility and content--to be one of the courtly  slaves of the Palace. Those who did not laugh at her, scolded her.  One kind word was vouchsafed to her, and that came from the lord's  son. She nursed it and treasured it; till, from long concealing and  restraining her feelings, she at last found that gratitude had changed  into a sincere affection. But what does a man of the world care for  the love of a serf? It does not even flatter his vanity. The young  nobleman did not understand the source of her tears and her grief, and  he made a present of her, as he would have done of some animal, to his  betrothed.\"    Leon, agitated and somewhat enlightened, would have interrupted her;  but Giovanna said, \"Allow me to finish my tale. Providence did not  abandon this poor orphan, but permitted her to rise to distinction by  the talent with which she was endowed by nature. The wretched serf  of Pobereze became a celebrated Italian cantatrice. _Then_ her former  lord meeting her in society, and seeing her admired and courted by all  the world, without knowing who she really was, was afflicted, as if by  the dictates of Heaven, with a love for this same girl,--with a guilty  love\"--    And Giovanna rose, as she said this, to remove herself further from  her admirer.    \"No, no!\" he replied earnestly; \"with a pure and holy passion.\"    \"Impossible!\" returned Giovanna. \"Are you not married?\"    Roszynski vehemently tore a letter from his vest, and handed it to  Giovanna. It was sealed with black, for it announced the death of his  wife at the baths. It had only arrived that morning.    \"You have lost no time,\" said the cantatrice, endeavoring to conceal  her feelings under an iron mask of reproach.    There was a pause. Each dared not speak. The Count knew--but without  actually and practically believing what seemed incredible--that  Anielka and Giovanna were the same person--_his slave_. That terrible  relationship checked him. Anielka, too, had played her part to the end  of endurance. The long cherished tenderness, the faithful love of her  life could not longer be wholly mastered. Hitherto they had spoken in  Italian. She now said, in Polish,    \"You have a right, my Lord Roszynski, to that poor Anielka who escaped  from the service of your wife in Florence; you can force her back to  your palace, to its meanest work; but\"--    \"Have mercy on me!\" cried Leon.    \"But,\" continued the serf of Pobereze, firmly, \"you cannot force me to  love you.\"    \"Do not mock--do not torture me more; you are sufficiently revenged.  I will not offend you by importunity. You must indeed hate me! But  remember that we Poles wished to give freedom to our serfs; and for  that very reason our country was invaded and dismembered by despotic  powers. We must therefore continue to suffer slavery as it exists in  Russia; but, soul and body, we are averse to it; and when our country  once more becomes free, be assured no shadow of slavery will remain in  the land. Curse then our enemies, and pity us that we stand in such  a desperate position between Russian bayonets and Siberia, and the  hatred of our serfs.\"    So saying, and without waiting for a reply, Leon rushed from the room.  The door was closed. Giovanna listened to the sounds of his rapid  footsteps till they died in the street. She would have followed, but  dared not. She ran to the window. Roszynski's carriage was rolling  rapidly away, and she exclaimed vainly, \"I love you, Leon; I loved you  always!\"    Her tortures were unendurable. To relieve them she hastened to her  desk, and wrote these words:    \"Dearest Leon, forgive me; let the past be forever forgotten. Return  to your Anielka. She always has been, ever will be, yours!\"    She dispatched the missive. Was it too late, or would it bring him  back? In the latter hope she retired to her chamber, to execute a  little project.    Leon was in despair. He saw he had been premature in so soon declaring  his passion after the news of his wife's death, and vowed he would  not see Anielka again for several months. To calm his agitation, he  had ridden some miles into the country. When he returned to his hotel  after some hours, he found her note. With the wild delight it had  darted into his soul, he flew back to her.    On regaining her saloon a new and terrible vicissitude seemed  to sport with his passion--she was nowhere to be seen. Had the  Italian cantatrice fled? Again he was in despair-stupefied with  disappointment. As he stood uncertain how to act, in the midst of  the floor, he heard, as from a distance, an Ave Maria poured forth  in tones he half recognized. The sounds brought back to him a host  of recollections: a weeping serf--the garden of his own palace. In a  state of new rapture he followed the voice. He traced it to an inner  chamber, and he there beheld the lovely singer kneeling in the costume  of a Polish serf. She rose, greeted Leon with a touching smile, and  stepped forward with serious bashfulness. Leon extended his arms; she  sank into them; and in that fond embrace all past wrongs and sorrows  were forgotten! Anielka drew from her bosom a little purse, and took  from it a piece of silver, It was the rouble. Now, Leon did not smile  at it. He comprehended the sacredness of this little gift, and some  tears of repentance fell on Anielka's hand.    A few months after, Leon wrote to the steward of Olgogrod to prepare  everything splendidly for the reception of his second wife. He  concluded his letter with these words:    \"I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13650"],[0,"Nonsense Books (#14)"],[1,"to me by a valued friend, as a form of verse  lending itself to limitless variety for rhymes and pictures; and  thenceforth the greater part of the original drawings and verses for the  first \"Book of Nonsense\" were struck off with a pen, no assistance ever  having been given me in any way but that of uproarious delight and welcome  at the appearance of every new absurdity.    Most of these Drawings and Rhymes were transferred to lithographic stones  in the year 1846, and were then first published by Mr. Thomas McLean, of  the Haymarket. But that edition having been soon exhausted, and the call  for the \"Book of Nonsense\" continuing, I added a considerable number of  subjects to those previously-published, and having caused the whole to be  carefully reproduced in woodcuts by Messrs. Dalzell, I disposed of the  copyright to Messrs. Routledge and Warne, by whom the volume was published  in 1843.                                                                EDWARD LEAR.
