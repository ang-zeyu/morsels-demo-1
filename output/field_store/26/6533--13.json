This  much thieves and murderers had done for him; what would the good men of  the world do? How would they meet him halfway?    He went into the kitchen. They had forgotten nothing. There was a  quantity of \"chuck,\" flour, bacon, salt, coffee, a frying pan, a cup,  a canteen.    It brought a lump in his throat. He cast open the back door, and,  standing in the little pasture, he saw only one horse remaining. It was  a fine, young chestnut gelding with a Roman nose and long, mulish ears.  His head was not beautiful to see from any angle, but every detail of  the body spelled speed, and speed meant safety.    What wonder, then, that Andrew began to see the world through a bright  mist? What wonder that when he had finished his breakfast he sang while  he roped the chestnut, built the pack behind the saddle, and filled the  saddlebags. When he was in the saddle, the gelding took at once the  cattle path with a long and easy canter.    With his head cleared by sleep, his muscles and nerves relaxed, Andrew  began to plan his escape with more calm deliberation than before.    The first goal was the big blue cloud on the northern horizon--a good  week's journey ahead of him--the Little Canover Mountains. Among the  foothills lay the cordon of small towns which it would be his chief  difficulty to pass. For, if the printed notices describing him were  circulated among them, the countryside would be up in arms, prepared to  intercept his flight. Otherwise, there would be nothing but telephoned  and telegraphed descriptions of him, which, at best, could only come to  the ears of a few, and these few would be necessarily put out by the  slightest difference between him and the description. Such a vital  difference, for instance, as the fact that he now rode a chestnut, while  the instructions called for a man on a pinto.    Moreover, it was by no means certain that Hal Dozier, great trailer  though he was, would know that the fugitive was making for the northern  mountains. With all these things in mind, in spite of the pessimism of  Henry Allister, Andrew felt that he had far more than a fighting chance  to break out of the mountain desert and into the comparative safety of  the crowded country beyond.    He made one mistake in the beginning. He pushed the chestnut too hard  the first and second days, so that on the third day he was forced to  give the gelding his head and go at a jarring trot most of the day. On  the fourth and fifth days, however, he had the reward for his caution.  The chestnut's ribs were beginning to show painfully, but he kept  doggedly at his work with no sign of faltering. The sixth day brought  Andrew Lanning in close view of the lower hills. And on the seventh day  he put his fortune boldly to the touch and jogged into the first little  town before him.          CHAPTER 16      It was just after the hot hour of the afternoon. The shadows from the  hills to the west were beginning to drop across the village; people who  had kept to their houses during the early afternoon now appeared on  their porches. Small boys and girls, returning from school, were  beginning to play. Their mothers were at the open doors exchanging  shouted pieces of news and greetings, and Andrew picked his way with  care along the street. It was a town flung down in the throat of a  ravine without care or pattern. There was not even one street, but  rather a collection of straggling paths which met about a sort of open  square, on the sides of which were the stores and the inevitable saloons  and hotel.    But the narrow path along which Andrew rode was a gantlet to him. For  all he knew, the placards might be already out, one of the least of  those he passed might have recognized him. He noticed that one or two  women, in their front door, stopped in the midst of a word to watch him  curiously. It seemed to Andrew that a buzz of comment and warning  preceded him and closed behind him. He felt sure that the children stood  and gaped at him from behind, but he dared not turn in his saddle to  look back.    And he kept on, reining in the gelding, and probing every face with one  swift, resistless glance that went to the heart. He found himself  literally taking the brains and hearts of men into the palm of his hand  and weighing them. Yonder old man, so quiet, with the bony fingers  clasped around the bowl of his corncob, sitting under the awning by the  watering trough--that would be an ill man to cross in a pinch--that hand  would be steady as a rock on the barrel of a gun. But the big, square  man with the big, square face who talked so loudly on the porch of  yonder store--there was a bag of wind that could be punctured by one  threat and turned into a figure of tallow by the sight of a gun.    Andrew went on with his lightning summary of the things he passed. But  when he came to the main square, the heart of the town, it was quite  empty. He went across to the hotel, tied the gelding at the rack, and  sat down on the veranda. He wanted with all his might to go inside, to  get a room, to be alone and away from this battery of searching eyes.  But he dared not. He must mingle with these people and learn what  they knew.    He went in and sought the bar. It should be there, if anywhere, the  poster with the announcement of Andrew Lanning's outlawry and the  picture of him. What picture would they take? The old snapshot of the  year before, which Jasper had taken? No doubt that would be the one. But  much as he yearned to do so, he dared not search the wall. He stood up  to the bar and faced the bartender. The latter favored him with one  searching glance, and then pushed across the whisky bottle.    \"Do you know me?\" asked Andrew with surprise. And then he could have  cursed his careless tongue.    \"I know you need a drink,\" said the bartender, looking at Andrew again.  Suddenly he grinned. \"When a man's been dry that long he gets a hungry  look around the eyes that I know. Hit her hard, boy.\"    Andrew brimmed his glass and tossed off the drink. And to his  astonishment there was none of the shocking effect of his first drink  of whisky. It was like a drop of water tossed on a huge blotter. To his  tired nerves the alcohol was a mere nothing. Besides, he dared not let  it affect him. He filled a second glass, pushing across the bar one of  the gold pieces of Henry Allister. Then, turning casually, he glanced  along the wall. There were other notices up--many written ones--but not  a single face looked back at him. All at once he grew weak with relief.  But in the meantime he must talk to this fellow.    \"What's the news?\"    \"What kind of news?\"    \"Any kind. I've been talkin' more to coyotes than to men for a long  spell.\"    Should he have said that? Was not that a suspicious speech? Did it not  expose him utterly?    \"Nothin' to talk about here much more excitin' than a coyote's yap. Not  a damn thing. Which way you come from?\"    \"South. The last I heard of excitin' news was this stuff about Lanning,  the outlaw.\"    It was out, and he was glad of it. He had taken the bull by the horns.    \"Lanning? Lanning? Never heard of him. Oh, yes, the gent that bumped off  Bill Dozier. Between you and me, they won't be any sobbin' for that.  Bill had it comin'. But they've outlawed Lanning, have they?\"    \"That's what I hear.\"    But sweet beyond words had been this speech from the bartender. They had  barely heard of Andrew Lanning in this town; they did not even know that  he was outlawed. Andrew felt hysterical laughter bubbling in his throat.  Now for one long sleep; then he would make the ride across the mountains  and into safety.    He went out of the barroom, put the gelding away in the stables behind  the hotel, and got a room. In ten minutes, pausing only to tear the  boots from his feet, he was sound asleep under the very gates  of freedom.    And while he slept the gates were closing and barring the way. If he had  wakened even an hour sooner, all would have been well and, though he  might have dusted the skirts of danger, they could never have blocked  his way. But, with seven days of exhausting travel behind him, he slept  like one drugged, the clock around and more. It was morning,  mid-morning, when he wakened.    Even then he was too late, but he wasted priceless minutes eating his  breakfast, for it was delightful beyond words to have food served to him  which he had not cooked with his own hands. And so, sauntering out onto  the veranda of the hotel, he saw a compact crowd on the other side of  the square and the crowd focused on a man who was tacking up a sign.  Andrew, still sauntering, joined the crowd, and looking over their  heads, he found his own face staring back at him; and, under the picture  of that lean, serious face, in huge black type, five thousand dollars  reward for the capture, dead or alive--    The rest of the notice blurred before his eyes.    Some one was speaking. \"You made a quick trip, Mr. Dozier, and I expect  if you send word up to Hallowell in the mountains they can--\"    So Hal Dozier had brought the notices himself.    Andrew, in that moment, became perfectly calm. He went back to the  hotel, and, resting one elbow on the desk, he looked calmly into the  face of the clerk and the proprietor. Instantly he saw that the men did  not suspect--as yet.    \"I hear Mr. Dozier's here?\" he asked.    \"Room seventeen,\" said the clerk. \"Hold on. He's out in the square now.\"    \"'S all right. I'll wait in his room.\" He went to room seventeen. The  door was unlocked. And drawing a chair into the farthest corner, Andrew  sat down, rolled a cigarette, drew his revolver, and waited.          CHAPTER 17      He waited an eternity; in actual time it was exactly ten minutes. Then a  cavalcade tramped down the hall. He heard their voices, and Hal Dozier  was among them.

They are the mediums of common forms combined  and arranged into a common standard. The ideal beauty of the Helen of  Zeuxis was the combined medium of the real beauty of the virgins of  Crotona.      MR HILARY    But to make ideal beauty the shadow in the water, and, like the dog in  the fable, to throw away the substance in catching at the shadow, is  scarcely the characteristic of wisdom, whatever it may be of genius.  To reconcile man as he is to the world as it is, to preserve and  improve all that is good, and destroy or alleviate all that is evil,  in physical and moral nature--have been the hope and aim of the  greatest teachers and ornaments of our species. I will say, too,  that the highest wisdom and the highest genius have been invariably  accompanied with cheerfulness. We have sufficient proofs on record  that Shakspeare and Socrates were the most festive of companions. But  now the little wisdom and genius we have seem to be entering into a  conspiracy against cheerfulness.      MR TOOBAD    How can we be cheerful with the devil among us!      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    How can we be cheerful when our nerves are shattered?      MR FLOSKY    How can we be cheerful when we are surrounded by a _reading public_,  that is growing too wise for its betters?      SCYTHROP    How can we be cheerful when our great general designs are crossed  every moment by our little particular passions?      MR CYPRESS    How can we be cheerful in the midst of disappointment and despair?      MR GLOWRY    Let us all be unhappy together.      MR HILARY    Let us sing a catch.      MR GLOWRY    No: a nice tragical ballad. The Norfolk Tragedy to the tune of the  Hundredth Psalm.      MR HILARY    I say a catch.      MR GLOWRY    I say no. A song from Mr Cypress.      ALL    A song from Mr Cypress.      MR CYPRESS _sung_--      There is a fever of the spirit,    The brand of Cain's unresting doom,    Which in the lone dark souls that bear it    Glows like the lamp in Tullia's tomb:    Unlike that lamp, its subtle fire    Burns, blasts, consumes its cell, the heart,    Till, one by one, hope, joy, desire,    Like dreams of shadowy smoke depart.      When hope, love, life itself, are only    Dust--spectral memories--dead and cold--    The unfed fire burns bright and lonely,    Like that undying lamp of old:    And by that drear illumination,    Till time its clay-built home has rent,    Thought broods on feeling's desolation--    The soul is its own monument.      MR GLOWRY    Admirable. Let us all be unhappy together.      MR HILARY    Now, I say again, a catch.      THE REVEREND MR LARYNX    I am for you.      ME HILARY    'Seamen three.'      THE REVEREND MR LARYNX    Agreed. I'll be Harry Gill, with the voice of three. Begin      MR HILARY AND THE REVEREND MR LARYNX      Seamen three! I What men be ye?    Gotham's three wise men we be.    Whither in your bowl so free?    To rake the moon from out the sea.    The bowl goes trim. The moon doth shine.    And our ballast is old wine;    And your ballast is old wine.      Who art thou, so fast adrift?    I am he they call Old Care.    Here on board we will thee lift.    No: I may not enter there.    Wherefore so? 'Tis Jove's decree,    In a bowl Care may not be;    In a bowl Care may not be.      Hear ye not the waves that roll?    No: in charmed bowl we swim.    What the charm that floats the bowl?    Water may not pass the brim.    The bowl goes trim. The moon doth shine.    And our ballast is old wine;    And your ballast is old wine.      This catch was so well executed by the spirit and science of Mr  Hilary, and the deep tri-une voice of the reverend gentleman, that the  whole party, in spite of themselves, caught the contagion, and joined  in chorus at the conclusion, each raising a bumper to his lips:      The bowl goes trim: the moon doth shine:    And our ballast is old wine.    Mr Cypress, having his ballast on board, stepped, the same evening,  into his bowl, or travelling chariot, and departed to rake seas and  rivers, lakes and canals, for the moon of ideal beauty.           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER XII      It was the custom of the Honourable Mr Listless, on adjourning from  the bottle to the ladies, to retire for a few moments to make a second  toilette, that he might present himself in becoming taste. Fatout,  attending as usual, appeared with a countenance of great dismay, and  informed his master that he had just ascertained that the abbey was  haunted. Mrs Hilary's _gentlewoman_, for whom Fatout had lately  conceived a _tendresse_, had been, as she expressed it, 'fritted out  of her seventeen senses' the preceding night, as she was retiring to  her bedchamber, by a ghastly figure which she had met stalking along  one of the galleries, wrapped in a white shroud, with a bloody turban  on its head. She had fainted away with fear; and, when she  recovered, she found herself in the dark, and the figure was gone.  '_Sacre--cochon--bleu_!' exclaimed Fatout, giving very deliberate  emphasis to every portion of his terrible oath--'I vould not meet de  _revenant_, de ghost--_non_--not for all de _bowl-de-ponch_ in de  vorld.'    'Fatout,' said the Honourable Mr Listless, 'did I ever see a ghost?'    '_Jamais_, monsieur, never.'    'Then I hope I never shall, for, in the present shattered state of my  nerves, I am afraid it would be too much for me. There--loosen the  lace of my stays a little, for really this plebeian practice of  eating--Not too loose--consider my shape. That will do. And I desire  that you bring me no more stories of ghosts; for, though I do not  believe in such things, yet, when one is awake in the night, one is  apt, if one thinks of them, to have fancies that give one a kind of a  chill, particularly if one opens one's eyes suddenly on one's dressing  gown, hanging in the moonlight, between the bed and the window.'    The Honourable Mr Listless, though he had prohibited Fatout from  bringing him any more stories of ghosts, could not help thinking of  that which Fatout had already brought; and, as it was uppermost in his  mind, when he descended to the tea and coffee cups, and the rest of  the company in the library, he almost involuntarily asked Mr Flosky,  whom he looked up to as a most oraculous personage, whether any story  of any ghost that had ever appeared to any one, was entitled to any  degree of belief?      MR FLOSKY    By far the greater number, to a very great degree.      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    Really, that is very alarming!      MR FLOSKY    _Sunt geminoe somni portoe_. There are two gates through which ghosts  find their way to the upper air: fraud and self-delusion. In the  latter case, a ghost is a _deceptio visus_, an ocular spectrum, an  idea with the force of a sensation. I have seen many ghosts myself. I  dare say there are few in this company who have not seen a ghost.      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    I am happy to say, I never have, for one.      THE REVEREND MR LARYNX    We have such high authority for ghosts, that it is rank scepticism to  disbelieve them. Job saw a ghost, which came for the express purpose  of asking a question, and did not wait for an answer.      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    Because Job was too frightened to give one.      THE REVEREND MR LARYNX    Spectres appeared to the Egyptians during the darkness with which  Moses covered Egypt. The witch of Endor raised the ghost of Samuel.  Moses and Elias appeared on Mount Tabor. An evil spirit was sent into  the army of Sennacherib, and exterminated it in a single night.      MR TOOBAD    Saying, The devil is come among you, having great wrath.      MR FLOSKY    Saint Macarius interrogated a skull, which was found in the desert,  and made it relate, in presence of several witnesses, what was going  forward in hell. Saint Martin of Tours, being jealous of a pretended  martyr, who was the rival saint of his neighbourhood, called up his  ghost, and made him confess that he was damned. Saint Germain, being  on his travels, turned out of an inn a large party of ghosts, who had  every night taken possession of the _table d'hote_, and consumed a  copious supper.      MR HILARY    Jolly ghosts, and no doubt all friars. A similar party took possession  of the cellar of M. Swebach, the painter, in Paris, drank his wine,  and threw the empty bottles at his head.      THE REVEREND MR LARYNX    An atrocious act.      MR FLOSKY    Pausanias relates, that the neighing of horses and the tumult of  combatants were heard every night on the field of Marathon: that those  who went purposely to hear these sounds suffered severely for their  curiosity; but those who heard them by accident passed with impunity.      THE REVEREND MR LARYNX    I once saw a ghost myself, in my study, which is the last place where  any one but a ghost would look for me. I had not been into it for  three months, and was going to consult Tillotson, when, on opening the  door, I saw a venerable figure in a flannel dressing gown, sitting in  my arm-chair, and reading my Jeremy Taylor. It vanished in a moment,  and so did I; and what it was or what it wanted I have never been able  to ascertain.      MR FLOSKY    It was an idea with the force of a sensation. It is seldom that ghosts  appeal to two senses at once; but, when I was in Devonshire, the  following story was well attested to me. A young woman, whose lover  was at sea, returning one evening over some solitary fields, saw  her lover sitting on a stile over which she was to pass. Her first  emotions were surprise and joy, but there was a paleness and  seriousness in his face that made them give place to alarm. She  advanced towards him, and he said to her, in a solemn voice, 'The eye  that hath seen me shall see me no more. Thine eye is upon me, but I am  not.' And with these words he vanished; and on that very day and hour,  as it afterwards appeared, he had "]]]
