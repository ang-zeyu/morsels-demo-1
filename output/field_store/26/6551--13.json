Then rising to go, the youth holds out a right hand. \"Grasp my hand once  firmly before I go, Hoye. Pray tell me, will you wait and watch for my  return?\"    Tusee only nods assent, for mere words are vain.    At early dawn the round camp-ground awakes into song. Men and women sing  of bravery and of triumph. They inspire the swelling breasts of the  painted warriors mounted on prancing ponies bedecked with the green  branches of trees.    Riding slowly around the great ring of cone-shaped tepees, here and  there, a loud-singing warrior swears to avenge a former wrong, and  thrusts a bare brown arm against the purple east, calling the Great  Spirit to hear his vow. All having made the circuit, the singing war  party gallops away southward.    Astride their ponies laden with food and deerskins, brave elderly women  follow after their warriors. Among the foremost rides a young woman in  elaborately beaded buckskin dress. Proudly mounted, she curbs with the  single rawhide loop a wild-eyed pony.    It is Tusee on her father's warhorse. Thus the war party of Indian men  and their faithful women vanish beyond the southern skyline.    A day's journey brings them very near the enemy's borderland. Nightfall  finds a pair of twin tepees nestled in a deep ravine. Within one lounge  the painted warriors, smoking their pipes and telling weird stories by  the firelight, while in the other watchful women crouch uneasily about  their center fire.    By the first gray light in the east the tepees are banished. They are  gone. The warriors are in the enemy's camp, breaking dreams with their  tomahawks. The women are hid away in secret places in the long thicketed  ravine.    The day is far spent, the red sun is low over the west.    At length straggling warriors return, one by one, to the deep hollow. In  the twilight they number their men. Three are missing. Of these absent  ones two are dead; but the third one, a young man, is a captive to the  foe.    \"He-he!\" lament the warriors, taking food in haste.    In silence each woman, with long strides, hurries to and fro, tying  large bundles on her pony's back. Under cover of night the war party  must hasten homeward. Motionless, with bowed head, sits a woman in her  hiding-place. She grieves for her lover.    In bitterness of spirit she hears the warriors' murmuring words. With  set teeth she plans to cheat the hated enemy of their captive. In the  meanwhile low signals are given, and the war party, unaware of Tusee's  absence, steal quietly away. The soft thud of pony-hoofs grows fainter  and fainter. The gradual hush of the empty ravine whirrs noisily in the  ear of the young woman. Alert for any sound of footfalls nigh, she holds  her breath to listen. Her right hand rests on a long knife in her belt.  Ah, yes, she knows where her pony is hid, but not yet has she need of  him. Satisfied that no danger is nigh, she prowls forth from her place  of hiding. With a panther's tread and pace she climbs the high ridge  beyond the low ravine. From thence she spies the enemy's camp-fires.    Rooted to the barren bluff the slender woman's figure stands on the  pinnacle of night, outlined against a starry sky. The cool night breeze  wafts to her burning ear snatches of song and drum. With desperate hate  she bites her teeth.    Tusee beckons the stars to witness. With impassioned voice and uplifted  face she pleads:    \"Great Spirit, speed me to my lover's rescue! Give me swift cunning for  a weapon this night! All-powerful Spirit, grant me my warrior-father's  heart, strong to slay a foe and mighty to save a friend!\"    In the midst of the enemy's camp-ground, underneath a temporary  dance-house, are men and women in gala-day dress. It is late in the  night, but the merry warriors bend and bow their nude, painted bodies  before a bright center fire. To the lusty men's voices and the rhythmic  throbbing drum, they leap and rebound with feathered headgears waving.    Women with red-painted cheeks and long, braided hair sit in a large  half-circle against the willow railing. They, too, join in the singing,  and rise to dance with their victorious warriors.    Amid this circular dance arena stands a prisoner bound to a post,  haggard with shame and sorrow. He hangs his disheveled head.    He stares with unseeing eyes upon the bare earth at his feet. With jeers  and smirking faces the dancers mock the Dakota captive. Rowdy braves and  small boys hoot and yell in derision.    Silent among the noisy mob, a tall woman, leaning both elbows on the  round willow railing, peers into the lighted arena. The dancing center  fire shines bright into her handsome face, intensifying the night in her  dark eyes. It breaks into myriad points upon her beaded dress. Unmindful  of the surging throng jostling her at either side, she glares in upon  the hateful, scoffing men. Suddenly she turns her head. Tittering maids  whisper near her ear:    \"There! There! See him now, sneering in the captive's face. 'Tis he who  sprang upon the young man and dragged him by his long hair to yonder  post. See! He is handsome! How gracefully he dances!\"    The silent young woman looks toward the bound captive. She sees a  warrior, scarce older than the captive, flourishing a tomahawk in the  Dakota's face. A burning rage darts forth from her eyes and brands him  for a victim of revenge. Her heart mutters within her breast, \"Come, I  wish to meet you, vile foe, who captured my lover and tortures him now  with a living death.\"    Here the singers hush their voices, and the dancers scatter to their  various resting-places along the willow ring. The victor gives a  reluctant last twirl of his tomahawk, then, like the others, he leaves  the center ground. With head and shoulders swaying from side to side, he  carries a high-pointing chin toward the willow railing. Sitting down  upon the ground with crossed legs, he fans himself with an outspread  turkey wing.    Now and then he stops his haughty blinking to peep out of the corners of  his eyes. He hears some one clearing her throat gently. It is  unmistakably for his ear. The wing-fan swings irregularly to and fro. At  length he turns a proud face over a bare shoulder and beholds a handsome  woman smiling.    \"Ah, she would speak to a hero!\" thumps his heart wildly.    The singers raise their voices in unison. The music is irresistible.  Again lunges the victor into the open arena. Again he leers into the  captive's face. At every interval between the songs he returns to his  resting-place. Here the young woman awaits him. As he approaches she  smiles boldly into his eyes. He is pleased with her face and her smile.    Waving his wing-fan spasmodically in front of his face, he sits with his  ears pricked up. He catches a low whisper. A hand taps him lightly on  the shoulder. The handsome woman speaks to him in his own tongue. \"Come  out into the night. I wish to tell you who I am.\"    He must know what sweet words of praise the handsome woman has for him.  With both hands he spreads the meshes of the loosely woven willows, and  crawls out unnoticed into the dark.    Before him stands the young woman. Beckoning him with a slender hand,  she steps backward, away from the light and the restless throng of  onlookers. He follows with impatient strides. She quickens her pace. He  lengthens his strides. Then suddenly the woman turns from him and darts  away with amazing speed. Clinching his fists and biting his lower lip,  the young man runs after the fleeing woman. In his maddened pursuit he  forgets the dance arena.    Beside a cluster of low bushes the woman halts. The young man, panting  for breath and plunging headlong forward, whispers loud, \"Pray tell me,  are you a woman or an evil spirit to lure me away?\"    Turning on heels firmly planted in the earth, the woman gives a wild  spring forward, like a panther for its prey. In a husky voice she hissed  between her teeth, \"I am a Dakota woman!\"    From her unerring long knife the enemy falls heavily at her feet. The  Great Spirit heard Tusee's prayer on the hilltop. He gave her a  warrior's strong heart to lessen the foe by one.    A bent old woman's figure, with a bundle like a grandchild slung on her  back, walks round and round the dance-house. The wearied onlookers are  leaving in twos and threes. The tired dancers creep out of the willow  railing, and some go out at the entrance way, till the singers, too,  rise from the drum and are trudging drowsily homeward. Within the arena  the center fire lies broken in red embers. The night no longer lingers  about the willow railing, but, hovering into the dance-house, covers  here and there a snoring man whom sleep has overpowered where he sat.    The captive in his tight-binding rawhide ropes hangs in hopeless  despair. Close about him the gloom of night is slowly crouching. Yet the  last red, crackling embers cast a faint light upon his long black hair,  and, shining through the thick mats, caress his wan face with undying  hope.    Still about the dance-house the old woman prowls. Now the embers are  gray with ashes.    The old bent woman appears at the entrance way. With a cautious, groping  foot she enters. Whispering between her teeth a lullaby for her sleeping  child in her blanket, she searches for something forgotten.    Noisily snored the dreaming men in the darkest parts. As the lisping old  woman draws nigh, the captive again opens his eyes.    A forefinger she presses to her lip. The young man arouses himself from  his stupor. His senses belie him. Before his wide-open eyes the old bent  figure straightens into its youthful stature. Tusee herself is beside  him. With a stroke upward and downward she severs the cruel cords with  her sharp blade. Dropping her blanket from her shoulders, so that it  hangs from her girdled waist like a skirt, she shakes the large bundle  into a light shawl for her lover."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10380"],[0,"Bible Stories and Religious Classics (#14)"],[1,"which was born to him in his old age,  whose brother of the same mother is dead, and he is an only son whom the  father loveth tenderly. Thou saidst to us thy servants: Bring him hither  to me that I may see. We told to thee my lord for truth: our father may  not forego the child, if he forego him certainly he shall die. And thou  saidst to us, thy servants: But if ye bring him not with you, ye shall  no more see my visage. Then when we came to our father and told him all  these things, and our father bade us to return and buy more corn. To  whom we said: We may not go thither but if our youngest brother go with  us, for if he be absent we dare not approach, ne come to the presence of  the man; and he answered to us: Ye know well that my wife brought to me  forth but two sons, that one went out, and ye said that wild beasts had  devoured him, and yet I heard never of him ne he appeared not. If now  ye should take this my son and anything happened to him in the way ye  should bring my hoar hair with sorrow to hell. Therefore if I should  come home to my father and bring not the child with me, sith the soul  and health of my father dependeth of this child, and see that he is not  come with us, he shall die and we thy servants should lead his old age  with wailing and sorrow to hell. I myself shall be thy proper servant  which have received him upon my faith and have promised for him, saying  to my father: If I bring him not again I shall be guilty of the sin to  my father ever after. I shall abide and continue thy servant for the  child in the ministry and service of thee my lord. I may not depart, the  child being absent, lest I be witness of the sorrow that my father shall  take. Wherefore I beseech thee to suffer this child to go to his father  and receive me into thy service. Thus said Judah, with much more; as  Josephus, Antiquitatum, rehearseth more piteously, and saith moreover  that the cause why he did do hide the cup in Benjamin's sack, was to  know whether they loved Benjamin or hated him as they did him, what time  they sold him to the Ishmaelites.    Then this request made, Joseph might no longer forbear, but commanded  them that stood by to withdraw them, and when all men were gone out sauf  he and his brethren, he began to say to them weeping: I am Joseph your  brother, liveth yet my father? The brethren were so afeard that they  could not speak ne answer to him. Then he debonairly said to them: Come  hither to me; and when they came near him he said: I am Joseph your  brother that ye sold into Egypt; be ye not afeard nor think not hard  unto you that ye sold me into these regions. God hath sent me tofore you  into Egypt for your health. It is two years since the famine began, and  yet been five years to come in which men may not ear, sow, ne reap. God  hath sent me tofore you that ye should be reserved on the earth, and  that ye may have meat to live by. It is not by your counsel that I was  sent hither, but by the will of God, which hath ordained me father of  Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and prince in all the land of Egypt.  Hie you, and go to my father, and say ye to him: This word sendeth thee  thy son Joseph: God hath made me lord of the universal land of Egypt,  come to me lest thou die, and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen.  Thou shalt be next me, thou and thy sons and the sons of thy sons, and I  shall feed thy sheep, thy beasts and all that thou hast in possession.  Yet rest five year to come of famine, therefore come lest thou perish,  thy house, and all that thou owest. Lo! your eyes and the eyes of my  brother Benjamin see that my mouth speaketh these words to you. Show ye  to my father all my glory and all that ye have seen in Egypt. Hie ye and  bring him to me. This said, he embraced his brother Benjamin about his  neck and wept upon each of them. After this they durst better speak to  him. Anon it was told and known all about in the King's hall that  Joseph's brethren were come. And Pharaoh was joyful and glad thereof and  all his household. And Pharaoh said to Joseph that he should say to his  brethren: Lade ye your beasts and go into the land of Canaan, and bring  from thence your father and kindred, and come to me, and I shall give  you all the goods of Egypt, that ye may eat the marrow of the earth.  Command ye also that they take carriages of this land of Egypt, for the  carriage of their children and wives, and say to them: Take your father  and come as soon as ye may, and leave nothing behind you, for all the  best things shall be yours. The sons of Israel did as they were  commanded. To whom Joseph gave carriages after the commandment of  Pharaoh, and meat to eat by the way. He commanded to give to every each  two garments. To Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, with  five garments of the best, and also he sent clothing to his father,  adding to them ten asses which were laden with all riches of Egypt, and  as many asses laden and bearing bread and victual to spend by the way.  And thus he let his brethren depart from him saying: Be ye not wroth in  the way. Then they thus departing came into the land of Canaan to their  father, and showed all this to their father, and said: Joseph thy son  liveth and he lordeth in all the land of Egypt.    When Jacob heard this he awoke as a man had been awaked suddenly out of  his sleep, yet nevertheless he believed them not, and they told to him  all the order of the matter. When he saw the carriage and all that he  had sent, his spirit revived and said: It sufficeth to me if Joseph my  son yet live, I shall go and see him ere I die. Then Israel went forth  with all that he had and came to the pit where tofore he had sworn to  God; and slew there beasts to make sacrifices to the God of Isaac his  father. He heard God by a vision that same night saying to him: Jacob,  Jacob, to whom he answered: I am here all ready. God said to him: I am  strongest God of thy father Isaac, dread thee not, but descend down into  Egypt. I shall make thee to grow there into great people. I shall  descend with thee thither, and I shall bring thee again when thou  returnest. Joseph soothly shall put his hands upon thine eyes. Jacob  then arose on the morn early, and his sons took him with their children  and wives and set them on the carriages that Pharaoh had sent to bring  him and all that he had into the land of Canaan. And so came into Egypt  with all his progeny, sons and children, etc.    These be the names of the sons of Israel that entered with him into  Egypt. The first begotten Reuben with his children four. Simeon with his  seven sons. Levi with his three sons. Judah and his sons three. Issachar  and his four sons. Zebulon and his sons three. These were sons of Leah  that Jacob gat in Mesopotamia, and Dinah his daughter. All these sons  and daughters were thirty-three. Gad also entered with his children  seven. Asher with his children five and of his children's children two.  These were sons of Zilpah, in number sixteen. The sons of Rachel were  Joseph and Benjamin. Joseph had two sons in the land of Egypt by his  wife Asenath, Manasseh and Ephraim. The sons of Benjamin were ten. All  these children that came of Rachel were in number fourteen. Dan entered  with one son, and Naphtali with four sons. These were the children of  Bilhah; they were in number seven. All the souls that were issued of his  seed that entered into Egypt with him, without the wives of his sons,  were sixty-six. The sons of Joseph that were born in Egypt twain. Summa  of all the souls of the house of Jacob that entered into Egypt were in  all seventy.    Jacob sent them tofore him Judah unto Joseph, to show to him his coming.  And he came to Joseph in Goshen, and anon Joseph ascended his chariot  and went for to meet his father, and when he saw him, he embraced him  meekly and wept. And his father received him joyously and embraced also  him. Then said the father to Joseph: Now shall I die joyously because I  have seen thy visage. Then said Joseph to his brethren and to all the  house of his father: I shall go and ascend to Pharaoh and shall say to  him, that my brethren and the house of my father that were in the land  of Canaan be come to me, and be men keeping sheep, and can the manner  well for to keep the flocks of sheep, and that they have brought with  them their beasts, and all that ever they had. When he shall call you  and ask you of what occupation ye be, ye shall say: We be shepherds, thy  servants, from our childhood unto now, and our fathers also. This shall  ye say that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen, for the Egyptians have  spite unto herdmen of sheep. Then Joseph entered tofore Pharaoh and said  to him: My father, my brethren, their sheep and beasts be come from the  land of Canaan, and be in the land of Goshen. And he brought five of his  brethren tofore the king, whom he demanded of what occupation they were  of. They answered: We be keepers of sheep, thy servants, we and our  fathers, we be come to dwell in thy land, for there is no grass for the  flocks of sheep of us thy servants, the famine is so great in the land  of Canaan. We beseech thee that thou command us thy servants to dwell in  the land of Goshen. Then said the king to Joseph: Thy father and thy  brethren be come to thee, the land of Egypt is at thy commandment, make  thou them to dwell in the best place, and deliver to them the land of  Goshen. And if thou know them for conning, ordain they to be masters of  my beasts. After this Joseph brought his father in, and made him stand  tofore the king which blessed him, and was demanded of the king how old  he was. He answered: The days of the pilgrimage of my life be an hundred  and thirty years, small and evil, and yet I am not come unto the days of  my fathers that they have lived. And he blessed the king and went out.  Then Joseph gave to his father and brethren possession in Egypt in the  best soil of Rameses"]]]
