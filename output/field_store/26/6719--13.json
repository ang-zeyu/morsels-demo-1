No sooner had they gone than Imogen awoke, and not  knowing how she came there, nor where she was, went wandering through  the wood.    Now while Imogen had been living in the cave, the Romans had decided to  attack Britain, and their army had come over, and with them Leonatus,  who had grown sorry for his wickedness against Imogen, so had come  back, not to fight with the Romans against Britain, but with the Britons  against Rome. So as Imogen wandered alone, she met with Lucius, the  Roman General, and took service with him as his page.    When the battle was fought between the Romans and Britons, Bellarius and  his two boys fought for their own country, and Leonatus, disguised as  a British peasant, fought beside them. The Romans had taken Cymbeline  prisoner, and old Bellarius, with his sons and Leonatus, bravely rescued  the King. Then the Britons won the battle, and among the prisoners  brought before the King were Lucius, with Imogen, Iachimo, and Leonatus,  who had put on the uniform of a Roman soldier. He was tired of his life  since he had cruelly ordered his wife to be killed, and he hoped that,  as a Roman soldier, he would be put to death.    When they were brought before the King, Lucius spoke out--    \"A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer,\" he said. \"If I must die, so  be it. This one thing only will I entreat. My boy, a Briton born, let  him be ransomed. Never master had a page so kind, so duteous, diligent,  true. He has done no Briton harm, though he has served a Roman. Save  him, Sir.\"    Then Cymbeline looked on the page, who was his own daughter, Imogen, in  disguise, and though he did not recognize her, he felt such a kindness  that he not only spared the boy's life, but he said--    \"He shall have any boon he likes to ask of me, even though he ask a  prisoner, the noblest taken.\"    Then Imogen said, \"The boon I ask is that this gentleman shall say from  whom he got the ring he has on his finger,\" and she pointed to Iachimo.    \"Speak,\" said Cymbeline, \"how did you get that diamond?\"    Then Iachimo told the whole truth of his villainy. At this, Leonatus was  unable to contain himself, and casting aside all thought of disguise, he  came forward, cursing himself for his folly in having believed Iachimo's  lying story, and calling again and again on his wife whom he believed  dead.    \"Oh, Imogen, my love, my life!\" he cried. \"Oh, Imogen!    Then Imogen, forgetting she was disguised, cried out, \"Peace, my  lord--here, here!\"    Leonatus turned to strike the forward page who thus interfered in his  great trouble, and then he saw that it was his wife, Imogen, and they  fell into each other's arms.    The King was so glad to see his dear daughter again, and so grateful to  the man who had rescued him (whom he now found to be Leonatus), that he  gave his blessing on their marriage, and then he turned to Bellarius,  and the two boys. Now Bellarius spoke--    \"I am your old servant, Bellarius. You accused me of treason when I had  only been loyal to you, and to be doubted, made me disloyal. So I stole  your two sons, and see,--they are here!\" And he brought forward the two  boys, who had sworn to be brothers to Imogen when they thought she was a  boy like themselves.    The wicked Queen was dead of some of her own poisons, and the King, with  his three children about him, lived to a happy old age.    So the wicked were punished, and the good and true lived happy ever  after. So may the wicked suffer, and honest folk prosper till the  world's end.          MACBETH        When a person is asked to tell the story of Macbeth, he can tell two  stories. One is of a man called Macbeth who came to the throne of  Scotland by a crime in the year of our Lord 1039, and reigned justly  and well, on the whole, for fifteen years or more. This story is part  of Scottish history. The other story issues from a place called  Imagination; it is gloomy and wonderful, and you shall hear it.    A year or two before Edward the Confessor began to rule England, a  battle was won in Scotland against a Norwegian King by two generals  named Macbeth and Banquo. After the battle, the generals walked together  towards Forres, in Elginshire, where Duncan, King of Scotland, was  awaiting them.    While they were crossing a lonely heath, they saw three bearded women,  sisters, hand in hand, withered in appearance and wild in their attire.    \"Speak, who are you?\" demanded Macbeth.    \"Hail, Macbeth, chieftain of Glamis,\" said the first woman.    \"Hail, Macbeth, chieftain of Cawdor,\" said the second woman.    \"Hail, Macbeth, King that is to be,\" said the third woman.    Then Banquo asked, \"What of me?\" and the third woman replied, \"Thou  shalt be the father of kings.\"    \"Tell me more,\" said Macbeth. \"By my father's death I am chieftain of  Glamis, but the chieftain of Cawdor lives, and the King lives, and his  children live. Speak, I charge you!\"    The women replied only by vanishing, as though suddenly mixed with the  air.    Banquo and Macbeth knew then that they had been addressed by witches,  and were discussing their prophecies when two nobles approached. One of  them thanked Macbeth, in the King's name, for his military services, and  the other said, \"He bade me call you chieftain of Cawdor.\"    Macbeth then learned that the man who had yesterday borne that title  was to die for treason, and he could not help thinking, \"The third witch  called me, 'King that is to be.'\"    \"Banquo,\" he said, \"you see that the witches spoke truth concerning me.  Do you not believe, therefore, that your child and grandchild will be  kings?\"    Banquo frowned. Duncan had two sons, Malcolm and Donalbain, and he  deemed it disloyal to hope that his son Fleance should rule Scotland.  He told Macbeth that the witches might have intended to tempt them  both into villainy by their prophecies concerning the throne. Macbeth,  however, thought the prophecy that he should be King too pleasant to  keep to himself, and he mentioned it to his wife in a letter.    Lady Macbeth was the grand-daughter of a King of Scotland who had died  in defending his crown against the King who preceded Duncan, and by  whose order her only brother was slain. To her, Duncan was a reminder  of bitter wrongs. Her husband had royal blood in his veins, and when she  read his letter, she was determined that he should be King.    When a messenger arrived to inform her that Duncan would pass a night in  Macbeth's castle, she nerved herself for a very base action.    She told Macbeth almost as soon as she saw him that Duncan must spend  a sunless morrow. She meant that Duncan must die, and that the dead are  blind. \"We will speak further,\" said Macbeth uneasily, and at night,  with his memory full of Duncan's kind words, he would fain have spared  his guest.    \"Would you live a coward?\" demanded Lady Macbeth, who seems to have  thought that morality and cowardice were the same.    \"I dare do all that may become a man,\" replied Macbeth; \"who dare do  more is none.\"    \"Why did you write that letter to me?\" she inquired fiercely, and with  bitter words she egged him on to murder, and with cunning words she  showed him how to do it.    After supper Duncan went to bed, and two grooms were placed on guard at  his bedroom door. Lady Macbeth caused them to drink wine till they were  stupefied. She then took their daggers and would have killed the King  herself if his sleeping face had not looked like her father's.    Macbeth came later, and found the daggers lying by the grooms; and soon  with red hands he appeared before his wife, saying, \"Methought I heard a  voice cry, 'Sleep no more! Macbeth destroys the sleeping.'\"    \"Wash your hands,\" said she. \"Why did you not leave the daggers by the  grooms? Take them back, and smear the grooms with blood.\"    \"I dare not,\" said Macbeth.    His wife dared, and she returned to him with hands red as his own, but a  heart less white, she proudly told him, for she scorned his fear.    The murderers heard a knocking, and Macbeth wished it was a knocking  which could wake the dead. It was the knocking of Macduff, the chieftain  of Fife, who had been told by Duncan to visit him early. Macbeth went to  him, and showed him the door of the King's room.    Macduff entered, and came out again crying, \"O horror! horror! horror!\"    Macbeth appeared as horror-stricken as Macduff, and pretending that he  could not bear to see life in Duncan's murderers, he slew the two grooms  with their own daggers before they could proclaim their innocence.    These murders did not shriek out, and Macbeth was crowned at Scone.  One of Duncan's sons went to Ireland, the other to England. Macbeth was  King. But he was discontented. The prophecy concerning Banquo oppressed  his mind. If Fleance were to rule, a son of Macbeth would not rule.  Macbeth determined, therefore, to murder both Banquo and his son. He  hired two ruffians, who slew Banquo one night when he was on his way  with Fleance to a banquet which Macbeth was giving to his nobles.  Fleance escaped.    Meanwhile Macbeth and his Queen received their guests very graciously,  and he expressed a wish for them which has been uttered thousands of  times since his day--\"Now good digestion wait on appetite, and health on  both.\"    \"We pray your Majesty to sit with us,\" said Lennox, a Scotch noble; but  ere Macbeth could reply, the ghost of Banquo entered the banqueting hall  and sat in Macbeth's place.    Not noticing the ghost, Macbeth observed that, if Banquo were present,  he could say that he had collected under his roof the choicest chivalry  of Scotland. Macduff, however, had curtly declined his invitation.    The King was again pressed to take a seat, and Lennox, to whom Banquo's  ghost was invisible, showed him the chair where it sat.    But Macbeth, with his eyes of genius, saw the ghost. He saw it like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14300"],[0,"The Life of Napoleon I (Complete) (#14)"],[1,"its wonted  channels. Gay equipages were seen in the streets; theatres, prosperous  even during the Terror, were now filled to overflowing; gambling,  whether in money or in stocks and _assignats_, was now permeating all  grades of society; and men who had grown rich by amassing the  confiscated State lands now vied with bankers, stock-jobbers, and  forestallers of grain in vulgar ostentation. As for the poor, they  were meeting their match in the gilded youth of Paris, who with  clubbed sticks asserted the right of the rich to be merry. If the  _sansculottes_ attempted to restore the days of the Terror, the  National Guards of Paris were ready to sweep them back into the slums.  Such was their fate on May 20th, shortly after Buonaparte's arrival at  Paris. Any dreams which he may have harboured of restoring the  Jacobins to power were dissipated, for Paris now plunged into the  gaieties of the _ancien regime_. The Terror was remembered only as a  horrible nightmare, which served to add zest to the pleasures of the  present. In some circles no one was received who had not lost a  relative by the guillotine. With a ghastly merriment characteristic of  the time, \"victim balls\" were given, to which those alone were  admitted who could produce the death warrant of some family  connection: these secured the pleasure of dancing in costumes which  recalled those of the scaffold, and of beckoning ever and anon to  their partners with nods that simulated the fall of the severed head.  It was for this, then, that the amiable Louis, the majestic Marie  Antoinette, the Minerva-like Madame Roland, the Girondins vowed to the  utter quest of liberty, the tyrant-quelling Danton, the incorruptible  Robespierre himself, had felt the fatal axe; in order that the mimicry  of their death agonies might tickle jaded appetites, and help to weave  anew the old Circean spells. So it seemed to the few who cared to  think of the frightful sacrifices of the past, and to measure them  against the seemingly hopeless degradation of the present.    Some such thoughts seem to have flitted across the mind of Buonaparte  in those months of forced inactivity. It was a time of disillusionment.  Rarely do we find thenceforth in his correspondence any gleams of  faith respecting the higher possibilities of the human race. The  golden visions of youth now vanish along with the _bonnet rouge_ and  the jargon of the Terror. His bent had ever been for the material and  practical: and now that faith in the Jacobinical creed was vanishing,  it was more than ever desirable to grapple that errant balloon to  substantial facts. Evidently, the Revolution must now trust to the  clinging of the peasant proprietors to the recently confiscated lands  of the Church and of the emigrant nobles. If all else was vain and  transitory, here surely was a solid basis of material interests to  which the best part of the manhood of France would tenaciously adhere,  defying alike the plots of reactionaries and the forces of monarchical  Europe. Of these interests Buonaparte was to be the determined  guarantor. Amidst much that was visionary in his later policy he never  wavered in his championship of the new peasant proprietors. He was  ever the peasants' General, the peasants' Consul, the peasants'  Emperor.    The transition of the Revolution to an ordinary form of polity was  also being furthered by its unparalleled series of military triumphs.  When Buonaparte's name was as yet unknown, except in Corsica and  Provence, France practically gained her \"natural boundaries,\" the  Rhine and the Alps. In the campaigns of 1793-4, the soldiers of  Pichegru, Kleber, Hoche, and Moreau overran the whole of the Low  Countries and chased the Germans beyond the Rhine; the Piedmontese  were thrust behind the Alps; the Spaniards behind the Pyrenees. In  quick succession State after State sued for peace: Tuscany in  February, 1795; Prussia in April; Hanover, Westphalia, and Saxony in  May; Spain and Hesse-Cassel in July; Switzerland and Denmark in  August.    Such was the state of France when Buonaparte came to seek his  fortunes in the Sphinx-like capital. His artillery command had been  commuted to a corresponding rank in the infantry--a step that deeply  incensed him. He attributed it to malevolent intriguers; but all his  efforts to obtain redress were in vain. Lacking money and patronage,  known only as an able officer and facile intriguer of the bankrupt  Jacobinical party, he might well have despaired. He was now almost  alone. Marmont had gone off to the Army of the Rhine; but Junot was  still with him, allured perhaps by Madame Permon's daughter, whom he  subsequently married. At the house of this amiable hostess, an old  friend of his family, Buonaparte found occasional relief from the  gloom of his existence. The future Madame Junot has described him as  at this time untidy, unkempt, sickly, remarkable for his extreme  thinness and the almost yellow tint of his visage, which was, however,  lit up by \"two eyes sparkling with keenness and will-power\"--evidently  a Corsican falcon, pining for action, and fretting its soaring spirit  in that vapid town life. Action Buonaparte might have had, but only of  a kind that he loathed. He might have commanded the troops destined to  crush the brave royalist peasants of La Vendee. But, whether from  scorn of such vulture-work, or from an instinct that a nobler quarry  might be started at Paris, he refused to proceed to the Army of the  West, and on the plea of ill-health remained in the capital. There he  spent his time deeply pondering on politics and strategy. He designed  a history of the last two years, and drafted a plan of campaign for  the Army of Italy, which, later on, was to bear him to fortune.  Probably the geographical insight which it displayed may have led to  his appointment (August 20th, 1795) to the topographical bureau of the  Committee of Public Safety. His first thought on hearing of this  important advancement was that it opened up an opportunity for  proceeding to Turkey to organize the artillery of the Sultan; and in a  few days he sent in a formal request to that effect--the first  tangible proof of that yearning after the Orient which haunted him all  through life. But, while straining his gaze eastwards, he experienced  a sharp rebuff. The Committee was on the point of granting his  request, when an examination of his recent conduct proved him guilty  of a breach of discipline in not proceeding to his Vendean command. On  the very day when one department of the Committee empowered him to  proceed to Constantinople, the Central Committee erased his name from  the list of general officers (September 15th).    This time the blow seemed fatal. But Fortune appeared to compass his  falls only in order that he might the more brilliantly tower aloft.  Within three weeks he was hailed as the saviour of the new republican  constitution. The cause of this almost magical change in his prospects  is to be sought in the political unrest of France, to which we must  now briefly advert.    All through this summer of 1795 there were conflicts between Jacobins  and royalists. In the south the latter party had signally avenged  itself for the agonies of the preceding years, and the ardour of the  French temperament seemed about to drive that hapless people from the  \"Red Terror\" to a veritable \"White Terror,\" when two disasters checked  the course of the reaction. An attempt of a large force of emigrant  French nobles, backed up by British money and ships, to rouse Brittany  against the Convention was utterly crushed by the able young Hoche;  and nearly seven hundred prisoners were afterwards shot down in cold  blood (July). Shortly before this blow, the little prince styled Louis  XVII. succumbed to the brutal treatment of his gaolers at the Temple  in Paris; and the hopes of the royalists now rested on the unpopular  Comte de Provence. Nevertheless, the political outlook in the summer  of 1795 was not reassuring to the republicans; and the Commission of  Eleven, empowered by the Convention to draft new organic laws, drew up  an instrument of government, which, though republican in form, seemed  to offer all the stability of the most firmly rooted oligarchy. Some  such compromise was perhaps necessary; for the Commonwealth was  confronted by three dangers, anarchy resulting from the pressure of  the mob, an excessive centralization of power in the hands of two  committees, and the possibility of a _coup d'etat_ by some pretender  or adventurer. Indeed, the student of French history cannot fail to  see that this is the problem which is ever before the people of  France. It has presented itself in acute though diverse phases in  1797,1799,1814, 1830, 1848, 1851, and in 1871. Who can say that the  problem has yet found its complete solution?    In some respects the constitution which the Convention voted in  August, 1795, was skilfully adapted to meet the needs of the time.  Though democratic in spirit, it granted a vote only to those citizens  who had resided for a year in some dwelling and had paid taxes, thus  excluding the rabble who had proved to be dangerous to any settled  government. It also checked the hasty legislation which had brought  ridicule on successive National Assemblies. In order to moderate the  zeal for the manufacture of decrees, which had often exceeded one  hundred a month, a second or revising chamber was now to be formed on  the basis of age; for it had been found that the younger the deputies  the faster came forth the fluttering flocks of decrees, that often  came home to roost in the guise of curses. A senatorial guillotine, it  was now proposed, should thin out the fledglings before they flew  abroad at all. Of the seven hundred and fifty deputies of France, the  two hundred and fifty oldest men were to form the Council of Ancients,  having powers to amend or reject the proposals emanating from the"]]]
