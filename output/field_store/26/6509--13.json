Amázonibus, dative after the compound verb.    19. 1. persuásit. Notice that this verb governs the same construction  that we have already found used with _imperó_ and _mandó_.    2. sécum. See the note on 12, 19.    5. appulit. Supply _návem_.    6. docéret. A clause of purpose is frequently introduced by a relative.  Translate like the _ut_-clause of purpose, here 'to make known,'  literally 'who was to make known.'    14. mágnó interválló, ablative of degree of difference.    16. nón mágna. The effect of the position of these words may be  reproduced by translating 'but not a large one.'    neutrí. The plural is used because the reference is to two parties, each  composed of several individuals. 'Neither' of two individuals would be  _neuter_.    17. volébant, dedit. Consider the tenses. Each army waited for some time  for the other to cross; finally Hercules gave the signal.    22. occíderint. The perfect subjunctive is sometimes used in result  clauses after a past tense in the principal clause. This is contrary to  the general principle of the sequence of tenses, which requires the  imperfect or pluperfect subjunctive after a past tense, the present or  perfect subjunctive after a present or future tense.    23. Virí. Compare this with _hominibus_, 12, 2.    24. praestábant. Compare the tense with praestitérunt, line 21.    27. neu. As _neque_ or _nec_ is used for 'and not,' so _néve_ or _neu_  for 'and that not' in an object-clause or a clause of purpose.    20. 1. quibus, 'and by these,' The relative is much used in Latin to  connect a new sentence with the one preceding. When so used, it is  generally best rendered by 'and' or 'but' and a demonstrative or personal  pronoun.    ita ... ut. See the note on 17, 9.    2. essent, most easily explained as the subjunctive of attraction. By  this is meant that the verb is attracted into the mood of the clause upon  which it depends.    4. púgnátum est, 'the battle raged' or 'they fought,' literally 'it was  fought,' Intransitive verbs are often thus used impersonally in the  passive, with the subject implied in the verb itself, as púgnátum  est = _púgna púgnáta est_.    11. aestátis, partitive genitive. Notice that multum is used as a noun.    13. nactus. The perfect active participle is wanting in Latin, but the  perfect participle of deponent verbs is active in meaning.    24. specié horribilí. See the note on 4, 14.    26. timóre perterrití. See the note on 14, 11.    continébantur, 'kept themselves shut up.' This is the so-called reflexive  use of the passive, in which the subject is represented as acting upon  itself.    pecora. This word is used of herds of cattle, pecudés (line 25) of single  animals, especially sheep.    28. commótus cónsuluit. See the note on 18, 4.    21. 3. líberáret. See the note on 16, 27.    óráculó. Notice that párére is intransitive and has the dative of  indirect object, while 'obey' is transitive. It may help to understand  the Latin construction if you translate such verbs as _páreó_ by  intransitives, here 'to submit to.'    4. sacrifició. See the note on 10, 11.    5. ipsó temporis punctó quó, 'at the very moment when.'    8. égressus. See the note on 20, 13.    dé rébus ... factus est, 'was informed of the state of things,' literally  'was made more certain about the things which were being done.' In what  gender, number, person, and case is quae? Give a reason for each.    11. posset. The subjunctive is used because the words of the king are  quoted indirectly. He said _sí potes_, 'if you can.'    19. Ipse. Notice the use of this word in contrasts, frequently, as here,  of a person with that which belongs to him or with his subordinates.    20. inter sé, 'to one another.'    22. esset, subjunctive in an indirect question. The direct form would be  _Quantum perículum est_? ('How great is the danger?'). multás terrás,  just as we say 'many lands,'    23. Európae. Compare _Thébánís_, 10, 21.    24. in utróque lítore, 'on each shore,' 'on both shores.'    25. columnás. The ancients believed that the Rock of Gibraltar was the  pillar set up by Hercules on the European side.    22. 4. tantum, an adverb.    5. dederit. See the note on 19, 22.    9. quó in locó. See the note on 11, 25. essent. See the note on 21, 22.    10. sibi, the indirect reflexive.    12. et ... et, 'both ... and.'    18. prógredí, 'from proceeding.'    19. prohibébant, 'attempted to prevent,' imperfect of attempted action.  Notice that the use of the imperfect to express customary, repeated, or  attempted action follows naturally from its use to denote action going on  in past time. The present, the tense which denotes action going on in  present time, has the same special uses.    20. barbarí. This word was used by the Greeks of all other peoples; by  the Romans it was used of all but the Greeks and themselves.    24. cecidérunt. Let the quantity of the _i_ tell you whether this comes  from _cadó_ or _caedó_. Is occíderint a compound of _cadó_ or _caedó_?    25. in tálibus rébus, _i.e_. when a god intervenes in behalf of his  favorite.    26. nihil incommodí, 'no harm,' literally 'nothing of harm'; incommodí is  partitive genitive.    23. 2. quam celerrimé, 'as rapidly as possible.' _Quam_ with the  superlative expresses the highest possible degree.    3. Necesse, predicate adjective with erat, the subject being hás  tránsíre.    5. citerióre. The Romans called upper Italy _Gallia Citerior_, 'Hither  Gaul,' because it was occupied by Gallic tribes.    6. perenní. Learn the derivation of this word. The meaning of a word may  often be seen most easily and remembered most surely by noticing its  derivation,    téctí, used as predicate adjective.    9. cópiam. Notice carefully the meaning of this word. In what sense have  we found the plural _cópiae_ used?    10. rébus, 'preparations.' See the note on _rés_, 13, 8.    cónsúmpserat. See the note on 14, 3.    11. omnium opíniónem. Hitherto we have had _opíniónem omnium_, but here  _omnium_ is made emphatic by being placed first.    15. itinere, ablative of cause.    fessus, 'since he was weary.' Notice that a Latin adjective or participle  must often be expanded into a clause in the translation.    16. Haud = _nón_. It modifies a single word, usually an adjective or  adverb.    19. modo. See the note on 18, 10.    ingentí mágnitúdine. Compare _ingentis mágnitúdinis_, 16, 7.    23. boum. Learn the declension of this word from the vocabulary.    24. né. A negative clause of purpose is introduced by _né_.    24. 2. omnibus locís. _Locus_ modified by an adjective is often used  without _in_ in the ablative of place.    3. núsquam. We say 'could not find anywhere,' but Latin prefers to  combine the negative with another word.    6. reliquís. See the note on _reliquós centaurós_, 14, 26.    7. é bóbus. Compare _boum_, 23, 23. With únus the ablative with _ex_ or  _dé_ is commonly used instead of the partitive genitive.    16. neque quicquam. See the note on 10, 4.    21. móre suó, 'according to his custom.'    turbátus, 'was confused ... and.' See the note on _íra ... interfécit_,  18, 4.    22. in. See the note on _in átrium_, 7, 3.    25. respírandí. See the note on 12, 26.    25. 2. quam quós, for _quam eós quós_.    11. cui. See the note on _cui erant_, 13, 5.    12. Herculí imperáverat, 'had enjoined upon Hercules.'    17. Eurystheó. See the note on _óráculó_, 21, 3.    19. quaesíverat. With this verb the person of whom the question is asked  is expressed in the ablative with _ab, dé_, or _ex_.    23. orbis terrárum, 'of the world,' literally 'of the circle of lands.'    26. umerís suís, ablative of means, but we say 'on his shoulders.'    né. See the note on 23, 24.    décideret. Notice the force of the prefix _dé_.    27. mírátus, 'wondering at.' The perfect participle of deponent verbs is  often best rendered into English by a present participle.    26. 3. Herculí, dative with pródesse.    ille. See the note on _Perseus_, 4, 4.    4. certó, the adverb.    6. vénisset. What would the form be in the direct question?    inquit. See the note on 14, 28.    7. fíliábus. To avoid confusion with the corresponding forms of  _deus_ and _fílius_, the dative and ablative plural of _dea_ and _fília_  sometimes end in _ábus_.    sponte. This noun is practically confined to the ablative singular, in  prose usually with _meá, tuá_, or _suá_, 'of my, your, his own accord.'    9. posset, subjunctive because indirect. The thought of Hercules was _sí  potest_.    11. abesset. This also is indirect, quoting _absum_.    12. umerís. See the note on 25, 26.    17. pauca mília. Extent of space, like duration of time, is expressed by  the accusative,    passuum. See the note on 16, 6.    21. ita ut, 'as'    accépissent. Hitherto we have found the indicative in causal clauses  introduced by quod. The subjunctive indicates that the reason is quoted;  the Hesperides said _quod accépimus_.    28. grátiás égit. See the note on 6, 16.    27. 2. é labóribus. See the note on 24, 7.    3. Herculí praecéperat = _Herculí imperáverat_, 25, 12.    5. posset, subjunctive because it quotes the thought of Eurystheus,  _poterit_.    6. ut ... traheret. This clause is not itself the object of dedit, but in  apposition with the object (Negótium).    7. omnium, partitive genitive.    11. nárrámus. The present is sometimes used with antequam to express  future action, as in English with 'before.' See the note on 15, 1.    aliénum, predicate adjective, the subject of vidétur being pauca ...  própónere. In the passive _videó_ may mean 'be seen,' but it usually  means 'seem.'    13. qui ídem, 'which also,' literally 'which the same.'    14. Ut, 'when.'    15. dédúcébantur, customary action.    19. Stygis flúminis. We say 'river Styx,' but 'Mississippi River.'    quó, ablative of means.    20. necesse. See the note on 23, 3.    possent. The subjunctive is used with antequam to denote"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8998"],[0,"Paris as It Was and as It Is (#13)"],[1," further  mention till I conduct you to one of its public sittings.    At the period to which I revert, there existed in the _Louvre_ a  hall, called the _Salle des Antiques_, where, besides, some original  statues by French artists, were assembled models in plaster of the  most celebrated master-pieces of sculpture in Italy, together with a  small number of antiques. In another apartment, forming part of those  assigned to the Academy of Painting, and called the _Galérie  d'Apollon_, were seen several pictures, chiefly of the French school;  and it was intended that the Great Gallery should be formed into a  Museum, containing a collection of the finest pictures and statues at  the disposal of the crown.    This plan, which had partly been carried into execution under the old  _régime_, is now completed, but in a manner infinitely more  magnificent than could possibly have been effected without the  advantages of conquest. The _Great Gallery_ and _Saloon_ of the  _Louvre_ are solely appropriated to the exhibition of pictures of the  old masters of the Italian, Flemish, and French schools; and the  _Gallery of Apollo_ to that of their drawings; while a suite of lofty  apartments has been purposely fitted up in this palace for the  reception of original antiques, in lieu of those copies of them  before-mentioned. In other rooms, adjoining to the Great Gallery, are  exhibited, as formerly, that is during one month every year, the  productions of living painters, sculptors, architects, and  draughtsmen.    These different exhibitions are placed under the superintendance of a  board of management, or an administration, (as the French term it),  composed of a number of antiquaries, artists, and men of science,  inferior to none in Europe in skill, judgment, taste, or erudition.  The whole of this grand establishment bears the general title of    CENTRAL MUSEUM OF THE ARTS.    The treasures of painting and sculpture which the French nation have  acquired by the success of their arms, or by express conditions in  treaties of alliance or neutrality, are so immense as to enable them,  not only to render this CENTRAL MUSEUM the grandest collection of  master-pieces in the world, but also to establish fifteen  departmental Museums in fifteen of the principal towns of France.  This measure, evidently intended to favour the progress of the fine  arts, will case Paris of a great number of the pictures, statues, &c.  amassed here from different parts of France, Germany, Belgium,  Holland, Italy, Piedmont, Savoy, and the States of. Venice.    If you cast your eye on the annexed _Plan of Paris_, and suppose  yourself near the exterior south-west angle of the _Louvre_, or, as  it is more emphatically styled, the NATIONAL PALACE OF ARTS AND  SCIENCES, you will be in the right-hand corner of the _Place du Vieux  Louvre_, in which quarter is the present entrance to the CENTRAL  MUSEUM OF THE ARTS. Here, after passing through a court, you enter a  vestibule, on the left of which is the Hall of the Administration of  the Museum. On the ground-floor, facing the door of this vestibule,  is the entrance to the    GALLERY OF ANTIQUES.    In this gallery, which was, for the first time, opened to the public  on the 18th of Brumaire, year ix. of the French republic, (9th of  November 1800), are now distributed no less than one hundred and  forty-six statues, busts, and bas-reliefs. It consists of several  handsome apartments, bearing appropriate denominations, according to  the principal subjects which each contains. Six only are at present  completely arranged for public inspection: but many others are in a  state of preparation.    The greater part of the statues here exhibited, are the fruit of the  conquests of the army of Italy. Conformably to the treaty of  Tolentino, they were selected at Rome, from the Capitol and the  Vatican, by BARTHÉLEMY, BERTHOLET, MOITTE, MONGE, THOUIN, and TINET,  who were appointed, by the French government, commissioners for the  research of objects appertaining to the Arts and Sciences.    In the vestibule, for the moderate price of fifteen _sous_, is sold a  catalogue, which is not merely a barren index, but a perspicuous and  satisfactory explanation of the different objects that strike the eye  of the admiring spectator as he traverses the GALLERY OF ANTIQUES. It  is by no means my intention to transcribe this catalogue, or to  mention every statue; but, assisted by the valuable observations with  which I was favoured by the learned antiquary, VISCONTI, long  distinguished for his profound knowledge of the fine arts, I shall  describe the most remarkable only, and such as would fix the  attention of the connoisseur.    On entering the gallery, you might, perhaps, be tempted to stop in  the first hall; but we will visit them all in regular succession, and  proceed to that which is now the furthest on the left hand. The  ceiling of this apartment, painted by ROMANELLI, represents the four  seasons; whence it is called the    HALL OF THE SEASONS.    In consequence, among other antiques, here are placed the statues of  the rustic divinities, and those relating to the Seasons. Of the  whole, I shall distinguish the following:      N° 210. DIANA.    Diana, habited as a huntress, in a short tunic without sleeves, is  holding her bow in one hand; while, with the other, she is drawing an  arrow from her quiver, which is suspended at her shoulder. Her legs  are bare, and her feet are adorned with rich sandals. The goddess,  with a look expressive of indignation, appears to be defending the  fabulous hind from the pursuit of Hercules, who, in obedience to the  oracle of Apollo, was pursuing it, in order to carry it alive to  Eurystheus; a task imposed on him by the latter as one of his twelve  labours.    To say that, in the opinion of the first-rate connoisseurs, this  statue might serve as a companion to the _Apollo of Belvedere_, is  sufficient to convey an idea of its perfection; and, in fact, it is  reckoned the finest representation of Diana in existence. It is of  Parian marble, and, according to historians, has been in France ever  since the reign of Henry IV. It was the most perfect of the antiques  which adorned the Gallery of Versailles. The parts wanting have been  recently restored with such skill as to claim particular admiration.      214. ROME.    In this bust, the city of Rome is personified as an Amazon. The  helmet of the female warrior is adorned with a representation of the  she-wolf, suckling the children of Mars.    This antique, of Parian marble, is of a perfect Greek style, and in  admirable preservation. It formerly belonged to the Gallery of  Richelieu-Castle.      51. ADOLESCENS SPINAM AVELLENS.    This bronze figure represents a young man seated, who seems employed  in extracting a thorn from his left foot.    It is a production of the flourishing period of the art, but,  according to appearance, anterior to the reign of Alexander the  Great. It partakes a little of the meagre style of the old Greek  school; but, at the same time, is finished with astonishing truth,  and exhibits a graceful simplicity of expression. In what place it  was originally discovered is not known. It was taken from the  Capitol, where it was seen in the _Palazzo dei Conservatori_.      50. A FAUN, _in a resting posture_.    This young faun, with no other covering than a deer's skin thrown  over his shoulders, is standing with his legs crossed, and leaning on  the trunk of a tree, as if resting himself.    The grace and finished execution that reign throughout this figure,  as well as the immense number of copies still existing of it, and all  antiques, occasion it to be considered as the copy of the Faun in  bronze, (or Satyr as it is termed by the Greeks), of Praxiteles. That  statue was so celebrated, that the epithet of [Greek: perizoætos], or  the famous, became its distinctive appellation throughout Greece.    This Faun is of Pentelic marble: it was found in 1701, near _Civita  Lavinia_, and placed in the Capitol by Benedict XIV.      59. ARIADNE, _known by the name of_ CLEOPATRA.    In this beautiful figure, Ariadne is represented asleep on a rock in  the Isle of Naxos, abandoned by the faithless Theseus, and at the  moment when Bacchus became enamoured of her, as described by several  ancient poets.    It is astonishing how the expression of sleep could be mistaken for  that of death, and cause this figure to be called _Cleopatra_. The  serpent on the upper part of the left arm is evidently a bracelet, of  that figure which the Greek women called [Greek: opidion], or the  little serpent.    For three successive centuries, this statue of Parian marble  constituted one of the principal ornaments of the Belvedere of the  Vatican, where it was placed by Julius II.      190. AUGUSTUS.    This head of Augustus, adorned with the civic crown of oak leaves, is  one of the fine portraits of that emperor. It is executed in Parian  marble, and comes from Verona, where it was admired in the  _Bevilacqua_ cabinet.           *       *       *       *       *    On quitting the HALL OF THE SEASONS, we return to that through which  we first passed to reach it. This apartment, from being ornamented  with the statues of ZENO, TRAJAN, DEMOSTHENES, and PHOCION, is  denominated the    HALL OF ILLUSTRIOUS MEN.    It is decorated with eight antique granite pillars brought from  _Aix-la-Chapelle_, where they stood in the nave of the church, which  contained the tomb of Charlemagne.    Among the antiques placed in it, I shall particularize      N° 75. MENANDER.    This figure represents the poet, honoured by the Greeks with the  title of _Prince of the New Comedy_, sitting on a hemi-cycle, or  semicircular seat, and resting after his literary labours. He is clad  in the Grecian tunic and _pallium_.      76. POSIDIPPUS.    The dress of Posidippus, who was reckoned among the Greeks one of the  best authors of what was called"]]]
