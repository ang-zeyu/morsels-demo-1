This I have not only endeavoured to avoid, but also have  used a method for the contrary purpose. The design of this novel  is obvious, after the first meeting of Aurelian and Hippolito, with  Incognita, and Leonora; the difficulty is in bringing it to pass,  maugre all apparent obstacles within the compass of two days. How many  probable casualties intervene, in opposition to the main design, viz.  of marrying two couple so oddly engaged in an intricate amour, I leave  the reader at his leisure to consider; as also whether every obstacle  does not, in the progress of the story, act as subservient to that  purpose, which at first it seems to oppose. In a comedy this would  be called the unity of action, here it may pretend to no more than  an unity of contrivance. The scene is continued in Florence from the  commencement of the amour, and the time from first to last, is but  three days.'    Soon after Mr. Congreve's return to England, he amused himself, during  a slow recovery from a fit of sickness, with writing a comedy. Captain  Southern, in conjunction with Mr. Dryden, and Arthur Manwayring, esq;  revised this performance, which was the Old Batchelor; of which Mr.  Dryden said, he never saw such a first play in his life, adding, that  the author not being acquainted with the stage, or the town, it would  be pity to have it miscarry for want of a little assistance. Mr.  Thomas Davenant, who had then the direction of the Theatre-Royal in  Drury-Lane, had so high a sense of the merit of the piece, and was  so charmed with the author's conversation, that he granted him the  freedom of the house before his play came on, which, according to  the maxims of theatrical government, was not only an unusual, but an  unprecedented favour. In 1693 the Old Batchelor was acted before a  numerous, and polite audience. The play was received with such general  applause, that Mr. Congreve was then considered as a prop to the  declining stage, and a rising genius in dramatic poetry. It was this  play, and the singular success which attended it upon the stage, that  introduced our author to the acquaintance of the earl of Hallifax, who  was then the professed patron of men of wit; and who, being desirous  to raise a man of so promising a genius, above the necessity of too  hasty productions, made him one of the commissioners for licensing  Hackney coaches. The earl bestowed upon him soon after a place in the  Pipe-Office, and gave him likewise a post in the Custom-House, to the  value of 600 l. per annum.    In the following year Mr. Congreve brought upon the stage the Double  Dealer, which met not with so good a reception as the former.    Mr. Congreve has informed us in the dedication of this play, to  Charles Montague, esq; that he was very assiduous to learn from the  critics what objections could be found to it; but, says he, 'I have  heard nothing to provoke an answer. That which looks most like an  objection, does not relate in particular to this play, but to all; or  most that ever have been written, and that is soliloquy; therefore  I will answer it, not only for my own sake, but to save others the  trouble to whom it may be hereafter objected. I grant, that for a man  to talk to himself, appears absurd, and unnatural, and indeed it is  so in most cases, but the circumstances which may attend the occasion,  makes great alteration. It often happens to a man to have designs,  which require him to himself, and in their nature cannot admit of  a confident. Such for certain is all villainy, and other less  mischievous intentions may be very improper to be communicated to a  second person. In such a case, therefore the audience must observe,  whether the person upon the stage takes any notice of them at all, or  no: for if he supposes any one to be by,[C] when he talks to himself,  it is monstrous and ridiculous to the last degree; nay not only  in this case, but in any part of a play, if there is expressed any  knowledge of an audience it is insufferable. But otherwise, when a man  in a soliloquy reasons with himself, and pro's and con's, and weighs  all his designs, we ought not to imagine that this man either talks to  us, or to himself; he is only thinking, and thinking such matter,  as it were inexcusable folly in him to speak. But, because we are  concealed spectators of the plot in agitation, and the poet finds it  necessary to let us know the whole mystery of his contrivance, he is  willing to inform us of this person's thoughts, and to that end is  forced to make use of the expedient of speech, no other, or better way  being yet invented for the communication of thought.'    Towards the close of the same year Queen Mary died. Upon that occasion  Mr. Congreve produced an elegiac Pastoral, a composition which the  admirers of this poet have extolled in the most lavish terms of  admiration, but which seems not to merit the incense it obtained.    When Mr. Betterton opened the new house at Lincoln's-Inn, Congreve  took part with him, and gave him his celebrated comedy of Love for  Love, then introduced upon the stage, with the most extraordinary  success. This comedy, with some more of our author's, was smartly  criticised by the ingenious Mr. Collier, as containing lessons of  immorality, and a representation of loose characters, which can never,  in his opinion, appear on a stage without corrupting the audience.    Messrs. Congreve, Dennis, and Dryden, engaged in a vigorous defence  of the English stage, and endeavoured to shew the necessity of such  characters being introduced in order to be exposed, and laughed at. To  all their defences Mr. Collier replied, and managed the point with so  much learning, wit, and keenness, that in the opinion of many, he had  the better of his antagonists, especially Mr. Congrove, whose  comedies it must be owned, though they are admirably written, and the  characters strongly marked, are so loose, that they have given great  offence: and surely we pay too dear for pleasure, when we have it at  the expence of morality.    The same year he distinguished himself in another kind of poetry, viz.  an irregular Ode on the taking Namure, which the critics have allowed  to contain fine sentiments, gracefully expressed. His reputation as  a comic poet being sufficiently established, he was desirous of  extending his fame, by producing a tragedy. It has been alledged, that  some, who were jealous of his growing reputation, put him upon this  task, in order, as they imagined, to diminish it, for he seemed to be  of too gay and lively a disposition for tragedy, and in all likelihood  would miscarry in the attempt. However,    In 1697, after the expectation of the town had been much raised, the  Mourning Bride appeared on the New Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields:  few plays ever excited so great an ardour of expectation as this,  and very few ever succeeded to such an extravagant degree. There is  something new in the management of the plot; after moving the passions  of the audience to the greatest commiseration, he brings off his  principal characters, punishes the guilty, and makes the play conclude  happily.    The controversy we have just now mentioned, was thought to have  occasioned a dislike in Mr. Congreve towards the stage; yet he  afterwards produced another comedy called The Way of the World, which  was so just a picture of the world, that, as an author prettily says,      The world could not bear it.    The reception this play met with, compleated our author's disgust to  the theatre; upon which Mr. Dennis, who was a warm friend to Congreve,  made this fine observation, 'that Mr. Congreve quitted the stage  early, and that comedy left it with him.'    It is said that when Congreve found his play met with but indifferent  success, he came in a passion on the stage, and desired the audience  to save themselves the trouble of shewing their dislike; for he never  intended to write again for the Theatre, nor submit his works to the  censure of impotent critics. In this particular he kept his word with  them, and as if he had foreseen the fate of his play, he took an ample  revenge, in his Epilogue, of the race of Little Snarlers, who excited  by envy, and supported by false ideas of their own importance, dared  to constitute themselves judges of wit, without any just pretensions  to it. This play has long ago triumphed over its enemies, and is now  in great esteem amongst the best judges of Theatrical Entertainments.    Though Mr. Congreve quitted the stage, yet did not he give up the  cause of poetry; for on the death of the marquis of Blandford, the  only son of the duke of Marlborough, which happened in 1705, we find  him composing a pastoral to soften the grief of that illustrious  family, which he addressed to the lord treasurer Godolphin.    About the same time, the extraordinary success of the duke of  Marlborough's arms, furnished him with materials for an Ode to Queen  Anne. In another Pindaric Ode he celebrates the lord Godolphin; taking  occasion from that nobleman's delight in horse-racing to imitate  the Greek Poet in his favourite manner of writing, by an elegant  digression; to which he added a criticism on that species of poetry.    As in the early part of his life, Mr. Congreve had received favours  from people of a less exalted station, so of these he was highly  sensible, and never let slip any opportunity of shewing his gratitude.  He wrote an Epilogue to his old friend Southern's Tragedy of Oroonoko;  and Mr. Dryden has acknowledged his assistance in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12019"],[0,"Queen Hortense: A Life Picture of the Napoleonic Era (#14)"],[1,"her grief upon her sunken cheeks. She had torn this love from her  heart, and she rebuked herself that it had left a wound. She laid claim  to happiness no more; but her youth, her proud self-respect, revolted at  the idea of continuing to be the slave of misfortune henceforth, and so  she formed her firm resolve, saying to herself, with a melancholy smile,  \"I must manage to be happy, without happiness. Let me try!\"    And she did try. She once more arrayed herself in smiles, and again took  part in the festivities which now were filling the halls of St. Cloud,  Malmaison, and the Tuileries, and which, too, were but the dying lay of  the swan of the republic, or, if you will, the cradle-song of  reviving monarchy.    For things were daily sweeping nearer and nearer to that great  turning-point, at which the French people would have to choose between a  seeming republic and a real monarchy. France was already a republic but  in name; the new, approaching monarchy was, indeed, but a new-born,  naked infant as yet, but only a bold hand was wanting, that should  possess the determined courage to clothe it with ermine and purple, in  order to transform the helpless babe into a proud, triumphant man.    That courage Bonaparte possessed; but he had, also, the higher courage  to advance carefully and slowly. He let the infant of monarchy, that lay  there naked and helpless at his feet, shiver there a little longer; but,  lest it should freeze altogether, he threw over it, for the time being,  the mantle of his \"consulship for life.\" Beneath it, the babe could  slumber comfortably a few weeks longer, while waiting for its  purple robes.    Bonaparte was now, by the will of the French people, consul for life. He  stood close to the steps of a throne, and it depended only upon himself  whether he would mount those steps, or whether, like General Monk, he  would recall the fugitive king, and restore to him the sceptre of his  forefathers. The brothers of Bonaparte desired the first; Josephine  implored Heaven for the latter alternative. She was too completely a  loving woman only, to long for the chilly joys of mere ambition; she was  too entirely occupied with her personal happiness, not to fear every  danger that menaced it. Should Bonaparte place a crown upon his head, he  would also have to think of becoming the founder of a dynasty; and in  order to strengthen and fortify his position, he would have to place a  legitimate heir by his side. Josephine had borne her husband no  children; and she knew that his brothers had, more than once, proposed  to him to dissolve his childless union, and replace it with the presence  of a young wife. Hence, Bonaparte's assumption of royal dignity meant a  separation from her; and Josephine still loved him too well, and too  much with a young wife's love, to take so great a sacrifice upon her.    Moreover, Josephine was at heart a royalist, and considered the Count de  Lille, who, after so many agitations and wanderings, had found an asylum  at Hartwell, in England, the legitimate King of France.    The letters which the Count de Lille (afterward King Louis XVIII.) had  written to Bonaparte, had filled Josephine's heart with emotion, and,  with a kind of apprehensive foreboding, she had conjured her husband to,  at least, give the brother of the beheaded king a mild and considerate  answer. Yes, she had even ventured to beseech Bonaparte to comply with  the request that Louis had made, and give him back the throne of his  ancestors. But Bonaparte had laughed at this suggestion, as he would at  some childish joke; for it had never entered into his head that any one  could seriously ask him to lay his laurels and his trophies at the foot  of a throne, which not he, but a member of that Bourbon family whom  France had banished forever, should ascend.    Louis had written to Bonaparte: \"I cannot believe that the victor at  Lodi, Castiglione, and Arcola--the conqueror of Italy and Egypt--would  not prefer real glory to mere empty celebrity. Meanwhile, you are losing  precious time. _We_ can secure the glory of France; I say _we_, because  I have need of Bonaparte in the work, and because he cannot complete it  without me.\"    But Bonaparte already felt strong enough to say, not \"we,\" but \"I,\" and  to complete his work alone. Therefore, he replied to the Count de Lille:  \"You cannot desire your return to France, for you would have to enter it  over a hundred thousand corpses; sacrifice your personal interests to  the tranquillity and happiness of France. History will pay you a  grateful acknowledgment.\"    Louis had said in his letter to Bonaparte, \"Choose your own position,  and mark out what you want for your friends.\" And Bonaparte did choose  his position; but unfortunately for the Count de Lille, it was the very  one which the latter had wished to reserve for himself.    Josephine would have been glad to vacate the king's place for him, could  she but have retained her husband by so doing. She had no longings for a  diadem which, by-the-way, her beautiful head did not require in order to  command admiration.    \"You cannot avoid being a queen or an empress, one of these days,\" said  Bourrienne to her, on a certain occasion.    Josephine replied, with tears: \"_Mon Dieu_! I am far from cherishing any  such ambition. So long as I live, to be the wife of Bonaparte--of the  first consul--is the sum total of my wishes! Tell him so; conjure him  not to make himself king[12].\"    [Footnote 12: Bourrienne, vol. v., p. 47.]    But Josephine did not content herself with requesting Bourrienne to tell  her husband this; she had the courage to say so to him herself.    One day she went into Napoleon's cabinet, and found him at breakfast,  and unusually cheerful and good-humored. She had entered without having  been announced, and crept up on tiptoe to her husband, who sat with his  back turned toward her, and had not yet noticed her. Lightly throwing  her arm around his neck, and letting herself sink upon his breast, and  then stroking his pale cheeks and glossy brown hair, with an expression  of unutterable love and tenderness, she said:    \"I implore you, Bonaparte, do not mount the throne. Your wicked brother  Lucien will urge you to it, but do not listen to him.\"    Bonaparte laughed. \"You are a little goose, poor Josephine,\" he said.  \"It's the old dowagers of the Faubourg St. Germain, and your La  Rochefoucauld, more than all the rest, who tell you these wonderful  stories; but you worry me to death with them. Come, now, don't bother me  about them any more!\"    Bonaparte had put off Josephine with a laugh and a jesting word, but he  nevertheless conversed earnestly and seriously with his most intimate  personal friends on the subject of his assuming the crown. In the course  of one of these interviews, Bourrienne said to him:    \"As first consul, you are the leading and most famous man in all Europe;  whereas, if you place the crown upon your head, you will be only the  youngest in date of all the kings, and will have to yield precedence  to them.\"    Bonaparte's eyes blazed up with fiercer fire, and, with that daring and  imposing look which was peculiar to him in great and decisive moments,  he responded:    \"The youngest of the kings! Well, then, I will drive _all_ the kings  from their thrones, and found a new dynasty: then, they will have to  recognize me as the oldest prince of all.\"        CHAPTER IV.    THE CALUMNY.    The union of Hortense with Bonaparte's brother had not been followed by  such good results for her as Josephine had anticipated. She had made a  most unfortunate selection, for Louis Bonaparte was, of all the first  consul's brothers, the one who concerned himself the least about  politics, and was the least likely to engage in any intrigue. Besides,  this alliance had materially diminished the affection which Louis had  always previously manifested for Josephine. He blamed her, in the depths  of his noble and upright heart, for having been so egotistic as to  sacrifice the happiness of her daughter to her own personal welfare; he  blamed her, too, for having forced him into a marriage which love had  not concluded, and, although he never sided with her enemies, Josephine  had, at least, lost a friend in him.    The wedded life of this young couple was something unusually strange.  They had openly confessed the repulsion they felt for each other, and  reciprocally made no secret of the fact that they had been driven into  this union against their own wishes. In this singular interchange of  confidence, they went so far as to commiserate each other, and to  condole with one another as friends, over the wretchedness they endured  in their married bondage.    They said frankly to each other that they could never love; that they  detested one another: but they so keenly felt a mutual compassion, that  out of that very compassion--that very hatred itself--love might  possibly spring into being.    Louis could already sit for hours together beside his wife, busied with  the effort to divert her with amusing remarks, and to drive away the  clouds that obscured her brow; already, too, Hortense had come to regard  it as her holiest and sweetest duty to endeavor to compensate her  husband, by her kindly deportment toward him, and the delicate and  attentive respect that distinguished her bearing, for the unhappiness he  felt beside her; already had both, in fine, begun to console each other  with the reflection that the child which Hortense now bore beneath her  heart would, one day, be to them a compensation for their ill-starred  marriage and their lost freedom.    \"When I present you with a son,\" said Hortense, smiling, \"and when he  calls you by the sweet name of 'father,' you will forgive me for being  his mother.\"    \"And when you press that son to your heart--when you feel that you love  him with boundless affection,\" said Louis, \"you will pardon me for being  your"]]]
