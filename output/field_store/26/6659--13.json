[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13111"],[0,"The Brain and the Voice in Speech and Song (#14)"],[1,"  the brain are unified in their action by association fibres _A'_ in the  great bridge connecting the two hemispheres (Corpus Callosum). On each side  of the centre for phonation are represented association fibres _H_ which  come from the centre of hearing; these fibres convey the guiding mental  images of sounds and determine exactly the liberation of innervation  currents from the centre of phonation to the lower centres by which the  required alterations in tension of the laryngeal muscles for the production  of the corresponding sounds are effected. Arrows are represented passing  from the centre of phonation to the lower centres in the medulla which  preside over the muscles of the jaw, tongue, lips, and larynx. Arrows  indicate also the passage of innervation currents from the centres in the  brain which preside over voluntary breathing. It will be observed that the  innervation currents which proceed from the brain pass over to the opposite  side of the spinal cord and are not represented as coming into relation  with the respiratory centre _R_. This centre, as we have seen, acts  automatically, and exercises especially its influence upon the diaphragm,  which is less under the control of the will than the elevators of the ribs  and the abdominal muscles.    The diagram also indicates why these actions of voluntary breathing and  phonation can be initiated in either hemisphere; it is because they are  always bilaterally associated in their action; consequently both the higher  centres in the brain and the lower centres in the medulla oblongata and  spinal cord are united by bridges of association fibres, the result being  that even if there is a destruction of the brain at _a-b_, still the mind  and will can act through both centres, although not so efficiently.  Likewise, if there is a destruction of the fibres proceeding from the brain  centres to the lower medullary and spinal centres, the will is still able  to act upon the muscles of phonation and breathing of both sides of the  body because of the intimate connection of the lower medullary and spinal  centres by association fibres.]    Experiments on animals and observations on human beings show that the  centres presiding over the muscles of the larynx are situated one in each  hemisphere, at the lower end of the ascending frontal convolution in close  association with that of the tongue, lips, and jaw. This is as we should  expect, for they form a part of the whole cerebral mechanism which presides  over the voice in speech and song. But because the muscles of the tongue,  the lower face muscles, and even the muscles of the jaw do not necessarily  and always work synchronously and similarly on the two sides, there is more  independence in their representation in the cerebral cortex. Consequently a  destruction of this region of the brain or the fibres which proceed from it  to the lower executive bulbar and spinal centres is followed by paralysis  of the muscles of the opposite side. Likewise stimulation with an  interrupted electric current applied to this region of the brain in monkeys  by suitable electrodes produces movements of the muscles of the lips,  tongue, and jaw of the opposite side only. Not so, however, stimulation of  the region which presides over the movements of the muscles of the larynx,  for then _both_ vocal cords are drawn together and made tense as in  phonation. It is therefore not surprising if removal or destruction of this  portion of the brain _on one side_ does not produce paralysis of the  muscles of phonation, which, always bilaterally associated in their  actions, are represented as a bilateral group in both halves of the brain.  These centres may be regarded as a part of the physiological mechanism, but  the brain acts as a whole in the psychic mechanism of speech and song. From  these facts it appears that there is: (1) An automatic mechanism for  respiration and elemental phonation (the cry) in the medulla oblongata  which can act independently of the higher centres in the brain and even  without them (_vide_ p. 18). (2) A cerebral conscious voluntary mechanism  which controls phonation either alone or associated with articulation. The  opening of the glottis by contraction of the abductor (posterior  ring-pyramid muscles) is especially associated with descent of the  diaphragm in inspiration in ordinary breathing; whereas the voluntary  breathing in singing is associated with contraction of the adductor and  tensor muscles of the vocal cords.    A perfect psychic mechanism is as necessary as the physiological mechanism  for the production of perfect vocalisation, especially for dramatic  singing. A person, on the one hand, may be endowed with a grand vocal  organ, but be a failure as a singer on account of incorrect intonation, of  uncertain rhythm or imperfect diction; on the other hand, a person only  endowed with a comparatively poor vocal instrument, but knowing how to use  it to the best advantage, is able to charm his audience; incapable of  vigorous sound production, he makes up for lack of power by correct  phrasing and emotional expression. We see then that the combination of a  perfect physiological and psychological mechanism is essential for  successful dramatic singing, the chief attributes of which are: (1) Control  of the breath, adequate volume, sustaining power, equality in the force of  expulsion of air to avoid an unpleasant vibrato, and capability of  producing and sustaining loud or soft tones throughout the register. (2)  Compass or range of voice of not less than two octaves with adequate  control by mental perception of the sounds of the necessary variation in  tension of the laryngeal muscles for correct intonation. (3) Rich quality  or timbre, due partly to the construction of the resonator, but in great  measure to its proper use under the control of the will. Something is  lacking in a performance, however perfect the vocalisation as regards  intonation and quality, if it fails to arouse enthusiasm or to stir up the  feelings of an audience by the expression of passion or sentiment through  the mentality of the singer.    The general public are becoming educated in music and are beginning to  realise that shouting two or three high-pitched chest notes does not  constitute dramatic singing--\"a short _beau moment_ does not compensate for  a _mauvais quart d'heure_.\" It would be hard to describe or define the  qualities that make a voice appeal to the multitude. Different singers with  a similar timbre of voice and register may sing the same song correctly in  time, rhythm, and phrasing, and yet only one of them may produce that  sympathetic quality necessary to awaken not only the intellectual but the  affective side of the mind of the hearers. Undoubtedly the effects produced  upon the mind by dramatic song largely depend upon circumstances and  surroundings, also upon the association of ideas. Thus I was never more  stirred emotionally by the human voice than upon hearing a mad Frenchman  sing at my request the Marseillaise. Previously, when talking to him his  eyes had lacked lustre and his physiognomy was expressionless; but when  this broad-chested, six foot, burly, black-bearded maniac rolled out in a  magnificent full-chested baritone voice the song that has stirred the  emotions and passions of millions to their deepest depth, and aroused in  some hope, in others despair, as he made the building ring with \"Aux armes,  citoyens, formez vos bataillons\" I felt an emotional thrill down the spine  and a gulp in the throat, while the heart and respirations for an instant  stayed in their rhythmical course. Not only was I stirred by the effect of  the sounds heard, but by the change in the personality of the singer. It  awakened in my mind the scenes in the French Revolution so vividly  described by Carlyle. The man's facial expression and whole personality  suddenly appeared changed; he planted his foot firmly forward on the  ground, striking the attitude of a man carrying a musket, a flag, or a  pike; his eyes gleamed with fire and the lack-lustre expression had changed  to one of delirious excitement. A pike in his hand and a red cap on his  head would have completed the picture of a _sans culotte_. Dramatic song  therefore that does not evoke an emotional response is _vox et praeterea  nihil_.

They usually  rear two broods.    They build, so far as I know, always in holes, in trees, rocks, and  walls, preferentially in the latter. Their nests involve generally two  different kinds of work--the working up of the true nests on which the  eggs repose, and the preliminary closing in and making comfortable the  cavity in which the former is placed. For this latter work they use  almost exclusively moss. Sometimes very little filling-in is  required; sometimes the mass of moss used to level and close in an  awkward-shaped recess is surprisingly great. A pair breed every year  in a terrace-wall of my garden at Simla; elevation about 7800 feet.  One year they selected an opening a foot high and 6 inches wide, and  they closed up the whole of this, leaving an entrance not 2 inches in  diameter. Some years ago I disturbed them there, and found nearly half  a cubic foot of dry green moss. Now they build in a cavity behind one  of the stones, the entrance to which is barely an inch wide, and in  this, as far as I can see, they have no moss at all.    The nests are nothing but larger or smaller pads of closely felted  wool and fur; sometimes a little moss, and sometimes a little  vegetable down, is mingled in the moss, but the great body of the  material is always wool and fur. They vary very much in size: you  may meet with them fully 5 inches in diameter and 2 inches thick,  comparatively loosely and coarsely massed together; and you may meet  with them shallow saucers 3 inches in diameter and barely half an inch  in thickness anywhere, as closely felted as if manufactured by human  agency.    Six to eight is considered the full complement of eggs, but the  number is very variable, and I have taken three, four, and five  well-incubated eggs.    Captain Beavan, to judge from his description, seems to have found  a regular cup-shaped nest such, as I have never seen. He says:--\"At  Simla, April 20th, 1866, I found a nest of this species with young  ones in it in an old wall in the garden. I secured the old bird for  identification, and then released her. The nest contained seven young  ones, and was large in proportion. The outside and bottom consists of  the softest moss, the nest being carefully built between two stones,  about a foot inside the wall; the rest of it is composed of the finest  grey wool or fur. Diameter inside 2.5; outside about 5 inches. Depth  inside nearly 3 inches; outside 3.6.\"    Captain Cock told me that he \"found several nests in May and June in  Cashmere. The first nest I found was in a natural cavity high up in a  tree, containing three eggs, which I unfortunately broke while taking  them out of the nest. The interior of the cavity was thickly lined  with fur from some small animal, such as a hare or rat. I found my  second nest close to my tent in a cleft of a pine, quite low down,  only 3 feet from the ground. I cut it out and it contained five  eggs of the usual type--broad, blunt little eggs, white, with rusty  blotches.\"    Colonel G.F.L. Marshall writes:--\"I have only found two nests of this  species in Naini Tal, both had young (two in one nest, in the other  I could not count) on the 25th April; they were at about 7000 feet  elevation, built in holes in walls, the entrance in both cases being  very small, having nothing to distinguish it from other tiny crevices,  and nothing to lead any one to suppose that there was a nest inside.  It was only by seeing the parent birds go in that the nest was  discovered.\"    The eggs of this species are moderately broad ovals, with a very  slight gloss. The ground-colour is a slightly pinkish white, and they  are richly blotched and spotted, and more or less speckled (chiefly  towards the larger end), with bright, somewhat brownish red.    The markings very commonly form a dense, almost confluent zone or cap  about the large end, and they are generally more thinly scattered  elsewhere, but the amount of the markings varies much in different  eggs. In some, although they are thicker in the zone, they are still  pretty thickly set over the entire surface, while in others they are  almost confined to one end of the egg, generally the broad end.    These eggs vary much in size and in density of marking. The ordinary  dimensions are about 0.61 by 0.47, but in a large series they vary in  length from 0.57 to 0.72, and in breadth from 0.43 to 0.54. The  very large eggs, however, indicated by these _maxima_ are rare and  abnormal.      47. Lophophanes rufinuchalis (Bl.). _The Simla Black Tit_.    Lophophanes rufinuchalis (_Bl.). Jerd. B. Ind._ ii. p. 274.    Mr. Brooks informs us that this Tit is common at Derali and other  places of similar elevation. \"I found a nest under a large stone in  the middle of a hill foot-path, up and down which people and cattle  were constantly passing; the nest contained newly-hatched young. This  was the middle of May.\"    Dr. Scully, writing of the Gilgit district, tells us that this Tit is  a denizen of the pine-forests, where it breeds.    Finally Captain Wardlaw Ramsay, writing in the 'Ibis,' states that  this Tit was breeding in Afghanistan in May.          Subfamily PARADOXORNITHINAE.      50.

A nest of the Red-billed Crow-Tit was sent me from Native Sikhim,  where it was found at an elevation of about 10,000 feet, in a cluster  of the small Ringal bamboo. It contained three eggs, two of which were  broken in blowing them.    The nest is a very regular and perfect hemisphere, both externally and  internally. It is very compactly made, externally of coarse grass and  strips of bamboo-leaves, and internally very thickly lined with stiff  but very fine grass-stems, about the thickness of an ordinary pin,  very carefully curved to the shape of the nest. The coarser exterior  grass appears to have been used when dry; but the fine grass, with  which the interior is so densely lined, is still green. It is the most  perfectly hemispherical nest I ever saw. Exteriorly it is exactly 6  inches in diameter and 3 in height; internally the cavity measures 4.5  in diameter and 2.25 in depth.    The egg is a regular moderately elongated oval, slightly compressed  towards the smaller end. The shell is fine and thin, and has only a  faint gloss. The ground-colour is a dull white, and it is sparsely  blotched, streaked, and smudged with pale yellowish brown, besides  which, about the large end, there are a number of small pale inky  purple spots and clouds, looking as if they were beneath the surface  of the shell.    The single egg preserved measures 1.11 by 0.8.    A nest sent me by Mr. Mandelli was found, he says, in May, in Native  Sikhim, in a cluster of Ringal (hill-bamboo) at an elevation of nearly  10,000 feet. It is a large, rather broad and shallow cup, the great  bulk of the nest composed of extremely fine hair-like grass-stems,  obviously used when green, and coated thinly exteriorly with coarse  blades of grass, giving the outside a ragged and untidy appearance.  The greatest external diameter is 5.5, the height 3.2, but the cavity  is 4.5 in diameter and 2.2 in depth, so that, though owing to the  fine material used throughout except in the outer coating the nest is  extremely firm and compact, it is not at all a massive-looking one.      60. Scaeorhynchus ruficeps (Bl.). _The Larger Red-headed Crow-Tit_.    Paradoxornis ruficeps, _Bl., Jerd. B. Ind._ ii, p. 5.    Mr. Gammie writes from Sikhim:--\"In May, at 2000 feet elevation, I  took a nest of this bird, which appears to have been rarely, if ever,  taken by any European, and is not described in your Rough Draft of  'Nests and Eggs.' It was seated among, and fastened to, the spray of  a bamboo near its top, and is a deep, compactly built cap, measuring  externally 3.5 inches wide and the same in depth; internally 2.7 wide  by 1.9 deep. The material used is particularly clean and new-looking,  and has none of the secondhand appearance of much of the  building-stuffs of many birds. The outer layer is of strips torn off  large grass-stalks and a very few cobwebs; the lining, of fine fibrous  strips, or rather threads, of bamboo-stems. There were three eggs,  which were ready for hatching-off. They averaged 0.83 in. by 0.63 in.  I send you the nest and two of the eggs.    \"Both Jerdon and Tickell say they found this bird feeding on grain  and other seeds, but those I examined had all confined their diet to  different sorts of insects, such as would be found about the  flowers of bamboo, buckwheat, &c. Probably they do eat a few seeds  occasionally, but their principal food is certainly insects.  Very usually, in winter especially, they feed in company with  _Gampsorhynchus rufulus_. Rather curious that the two Red-heads should  affect each other's society.\"    The eggs are broad ovals, rather cylindrical, very blunt at both ends.  The shell fine, with a slight gloss. The ground is white, and it  is rather thinly and irregularly spotted, blotched, and smeared in  patches with a dingy yellowish brown, chiefly about the larger end, to  which also are nearly confined the secondary markings, which are pale  greyish lilac or purplish grey.      61.

A nest sent me by Mr. Mandelli as belonging to this species was found,  he tells me, at an elevation of 8000 feet in Native Sikhim on the 17th  May. It was placed in a fork amongst the branches of a medium-sized  tree at a height of about 30 feet from the ground. The nest is a  very massive cup, composed of soft grass-blades, none of them much  exceeding .1 inch in width, wound round and round together very  closely and compactly, and then"]]]
