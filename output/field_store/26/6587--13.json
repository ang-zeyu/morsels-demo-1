Yet only a little gastric and bowel disturbance followed, and  from this all recovered in a few days. Pereira says that the dose of  chloride of tin as an antispasmodic and stimulant is from 1/16 to 1/2 a  grain repeated two or three times daily. Probably no article of canned  food, not even the most acid fruit, if in a condition in which it can be  eaten, has ever contained, in an ordinary table portion, as much of a  soluble salt of tin as would amount to a harmless or useful medicinal  dose.    Metallic particles of tin are without any effect on man. A thousand  times the quantity ever found in a can of tinned food would do no harm.    Food as acid as say ordinary pickles would dissolve tin. Some  manufacturers once proposed using tin stoppers to their bottles of  pickles. But the tin was slowly dissolved by the acid of the vinegar.  These pickles, however, had a distinctly nasty \"metallic\" flavor. The  idea was abandoned. Probably any article of food containing enough tin  to disagree with the system would be too nasty to eat. Purchasers of  food may rest assured that the action taken by this firm would be that  usually followed. It is not to the interest of manufacturers or other  venders to offend the senses of purchasers, still less to do them actual  harm, even if no higher motive comes into force.    In the early days of canning, it is just possible that the use of  \"spirits of salt\" in soldering may have resulted in the presence of a  little stannous, plumbous, or other chloride in canned food; but such a  fault would soon be detected and corrected, and as a matter of fact,  resin-soldering is to my knowledge more generally employed--indeed, for  anything I know to the contrary, is exclusively employed--in canning  food. Any resin that trained access would be perfectly harmless. It is  just possible, also, that formerly the tin itself may have contained  lead, but I have not found any lead in the sheet tin used for canning of  late years.    In conclusion: 1. I have never been able to satisfy myself that a can of  ordinary tinned food contains even a useful medicinal dose of such a  true soluble _compound_ of tin as is likely to have any effect on man.  2. As for the metal itself, that is the filings or actual metallic  particles or fragments, one ounce is a common dose as a vermifuge;  harmless even in that quantity to man, and not always so harmful as  could be desired to the parasites for whose disestablishment it is  administered. One ounce might be contained in about four hundredweight  of canned food. 3. If a possibly harmful quantity of a soluble compound,  of tin be placed in a portion of canned food, the latter will be so  nasty and so unlike any ordinary nasty flavor, so \"metallic,\" in fact,  that no sane person will eat it. 4. Respecting the globules of solder  (lead and tin) that are occasionally met with in canned food, I believe  most persons detect them in the mouth and remove them, as they would  shots in game. But if swallowed, they do no harm. Pereira says that  metallic lead is probably inert, and that nearly a quarter of a pound  has been administered to a dog without any obvious effects. He goes on  to say that as it becomes oxidized it occasionally acquires activity,  quoting Paulini's statement that colic was produced in a patient who had  swallowed a leaden bullet. To allay alarm in the minds of those who fear  they might swallow pellets of solder, I may add that Pereira cites  Proust for the assurance that an alloy of tin and lead is less easily  oxidized than pure lead. 5. Unsoundness in meat does not appear to  promote the corrosion or solution of tin. I have kept salmon in cans  till it was putrid, testing it occasionally for tin. No trace of tin was  detected. Nevertheless, food should not be allowed to remain for a few  days, or even hours, in saucepans, metal baking pans, or opened tins or  cans, otherwise it _may_ taste metallic. 6. Unsound food, canned or  uncanned, may, of course, injure health, and where canned food really  has done harm, the harm has in all probability been due to the food and  not to the can. 7. What has been termed idiosyncrasy must also be borne  in mind. I know a man to whom oatmeal is a poison. Some people cannot  eat lobsters, either fresh or tinned. Serious results have followed the  eating of not only oatmeal or shell fish, but salmon and mutton;  _hydrate_ (misreported _nitrate_) of tin being gratuitously suggested as  being contained in the salmon in one case. Possibly there were cases of  idiosyncrasy in the eater, possibly the food was unsound, possibly other  causes altogether led to the results, but certainly, to my mind, the tin  had nothing whatever to do with the matter.    In my opinion, given after well weighing all evidence hitherto  forthcoming, the public have not the faintest cause for alarm respecting  the occurrence of tin, lead, or any other metal in canned foods.--_Phar.  Jour, and Trans., March 8, 1884, p. 719_.    [In reference to Prof. Attfield's statement contained in the closing  paragraph, we remark: It is well known that mercury is an ingredient of  the solder used in some canning concerns, as it makes an easier melting  and flowing solder. In THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN for May 27, 1876, in a  report of the proceedings of the New York Academy of Science, will be  seen the statement of Prof. Falke, who found metallic mercury in a can  of preserved corn beef, together with a considerable quantity of  albuminate of mercury.--EDS.

If there is one point more than another in which the exuberant youth and  vitality of the American nation is visible it is in that of education,  the provision for which is on a most generous scale, carried out with a  determination at which the older countries of the Eastern Hemisphere  have only arrived by slow degrees and painful experience. Of course the  Americans, being young, and having come to the fore, so to speak,  full-fledged, have been able to profit by the lessons which they have  derived from their neighbors--though it is none the less to their credit  that they have profited so well and so quickly. Technical and industrial  education has received a more general recognition, and been developed  more rapidly, than the general education of the country, partly for the  reason that there is no uniform system of the latter throughout the  States, but that each individual State and Territory does that which is  right in its own eyes. The principal reason, however, is that to possess  the knowledge, how to work is the first creed of the American, who  considers that the right to obtain that knowledge is the birthright of  every citizen, and especially when the manual labor has to be  supplemented by a vigorous use of brains. The Americans as a rule do not  like heavy or coarse manual labor, thinking it beneath them; and,  indeed, when they can get Irish and Chinese to do it for them, perhaps  they are not far wrong. But the idea of idleness and loafing is very far  from the spirit of the country, and this is why we see the necessity for  industrial education so vigorously recognized, both as a national duty,  and by private individuals or communities of individuals.    From whatever source it is provided, technical education in the United  States comes mainly within the scope of two classes of institutions,  viz., agricultural and mechanical colleges; although the two are, as  often as not, combined under one establishment, and particularly it  forms the subject of a national grant. Indeed, it may be said that the  scope of industrial education embraces three classes: the farmer, the  mechanic, and the housekeeper; and in the far West we find that  provision is made for the education of these three classes in the same  schools, it being an accepted idea in the newer States that man and  woman (the housekeeper) are coworkers, and are, therefore, entitled to  equal and similar educational privileges. On the other hand, in the more  conservative East and South, we find that the sexes are educated  distinct from each other. In the East, there is generally, also, a  separation of subjects. In Massachusetts, for instance, the colleges of  agriculture and mechanics are separate affairs, the students being  taught in different institutions, viz., the agricultural college and the  institute of technology. In Missouri the separation is less defined, the  School of Mines and Metallurgy being the, only part that is distinct  from the other departments of the University.    One of the chief reasons for the necessity for hastening the extension  of technical education in America was the almost entire disappearance of  the apprenticeship system, which, in itself, is mainly due to the  subdivision of labor so prevalent in the manufacture of everything, from  pins to locomotives. The increased use of machinery, the character of  which is such as often to put an end to small enterprises, has promoted  this subdivision by accumulating workmen in large groups. The beginner,  confining himself to one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11414"],[0,"In the Claws of the German Eagle (#14)"],[1,"to a casual  passerby, he suddenly subsided. The only other comment I could  drag out of him was that of a German officer who had told him that  \"one Belgian could fight as good as four Germans.\" My request for  a lodging-place met with the same evasion from him as from the  others.          Chapter VIII    Thirty-Seven Miles In A Day        \"Death if you try to cross the line after nightfall.\" Thus my soldier  friends picketing the Holland-Belgium frontier had warned me in  the morning. That rendezvous with death was not a roseate  prospect; but there was something just as omnious about the  situation in Liege. To cover the sixteen miles back to the Dutch  border before dark was a big task to tackle with blistered feet. I  knew the sentries along the way returning, but I knew not the  pitfalls for me if I remained in Liege. This drove me to a prompt  decision and straightway I made for the bridge.    It was no prophetically favorable sight that greeted me at the  outset. A Belgian, a mere stripling of twenty or thereabouts, had  just been shot, and the soldiers, rolling him on a stretcher, were  carrying him off. I made so bold as to approach a sentry and ask:  \"What has he been doing?\" For an answer the sentry pointed to a  nearby notice. In four languages it announced that any one caught  near a telegraph pole or wire in any manner that looked suspicious  to the authorities would be summarily dealt with. They were  carrying him away, poor lad, and the crowd passed on in heedless  fashion, as though already grown accustomed to death.    When the troops at the front are taking lives by the thousands,  those guarding the lines at the rear catch the contagion of killing.  Knowing that this was the temper of some of the sentries, I  speeded along at a rapid rate, daring to make one cut across a  field, and so came to Jupilles without challenge. Stopping to get a  drink there, I realized what a protest my feet were making against  the strain to which I was putting them. Luckily, a peasant's  vegetable cart was passing, and, jumping on, I was congratulating  myself on the relief, when after a few hundred yards the cart  turned up a lane, leaving me on the road again with one franc less  in my pocket.    There were so few soldiers along this stretch that I drove myself  along at a furious pace, slowing up only when I sighted a soldier. I  was very hot, and felt my face blazing red as the natives gazed  after me stalking so fiercely past them. But the great automobiles  plunging by flung up such clouds of dust that my face was being  continually covered by this gray powder. What I most feared was  lest, growing dizzy, I should lose my head and make incoherent  answers.    Faint with the heat I dragged myself into a little wayside place.  Everything wore a dingy air of poverty except the gracious keeper  of the inn. I pointed to my throat. She understood at once my signs  of thirst and quickly produced water and coffee, of which I drank  until I was ashamed.    \"How much!\" I asked.    She shook her head negatively. I pushed a franc or two across the  table.    \"No,\" she said smilingly but with resolution.    \"I can't take it. You need it on your journey. We are all just friends  together now.\"    So my dust and distress had their compensations. They had  brought me inclusion in that deeper Belgian community of sorrow.    It was apparent that the Germans were going to make this rich  region a great center for their operations and a permanent base of  supply. There must have been ten thousand clean-looking cattle  on the opposite bank of the river; they were raising a great noise  as the soldiers drove their wagons among them, throwing down  the hay and grain. Otherwise, the army had settled down from the  hustling activities of the morning, and the guards had been posted  for the oncoming evening. I knew now that I was progressing at a  good pace because near Wandre I noticed a peasant's wagon  ahead, and soon overtook it. It was carrying eight or nine Belgian  farm-hands, and the horse was making fair time under constant  pressure from the driver.    I did not wish to add an extra burden to the overloaded animal, but  it was no time for the exercise of sentiment. So I held up a two-  franc piece to the driver. He looked at the coin, then he looked at  the horse, and then, picking out the meekest and the most  inoffensive of his free passengers, he bade him get off and  motioned me to take the vacated seat at my right as a first-class  paying passenger. Two francs was the fare, and he seemed highly  gratified with the sum, little realizing that he could just as well have  had two hundred francs for that seat. We stopped once more to  hitch on a small wood-cart, and with that bumping behind us, we  trailed along fearfully slowly. Gladly would I have offered a  generous bounty to have him urge his horse along, but I feared to  excite suspicion by too lavish an outlay of money. So I sat tight  and let my feet dangle off the side, glad of the relief, but feeling  them slowly swelling beneath me.    I was saving my head as well as my feet, for the perpetual  matching of one's wits in encounters with the guards was  continually nerve-frazzling. But now as the cart joggled past, the  guard made a casual survey of us all, taking it for granted that I  was one of the local inhabitants. For this respite from constant  inquisition I was indebted to the dust, grime and sweat that  covered me. It blurred out all distinction between myself and the  peasants, forming a perfect protective coloration.    To slide past so many guards so easily was a net gain indeed.  However, the end of such easy passing came at the edge of  Charrate, where the driver turned into his yard, and I was dumped  down into an encampment of soldiers. Acting on the militarists'  dictum that the best defensive is a strong offensive I pushed my  way boldly into the midst of a group gathered round a pump and  made signs that I desired a drink. At first they did not understand,  or, thinking that I was a native Belgian, they were rather taken  aback by such impertinence; but one soldier handed me his cup  and another pumped it full. I drank it, and, thanking them, started  off. This calm assurance gained me passage past the guard, who  had stood by watching the procedure. In the next six hundred  yards I was brought to a standstill by a sudden \"Halt!\" At one of the  posts some soldiers were ringed around a prisoner garbed in the  long black regulation cassock of a priest. Though he wore a white  handkerchief around his arm as a badge of a peaceful attitude, he  was held as a spy. His hands and his eyes were twitching  nervously. He seemed to be glad to welcome the addition of my  company into the ranks of the suspects, but he was doomed to  disappointment, for I was passed along. The next guard took me  to his superior officer directly. But the superior officer was the  incarnation of good humor and he was more interested in a little  repast that was being made ready for him than in entering into the  questions involved in my case.    \"Search him for weapons,\" he said casually, while he himself  made a few perfunctory passes over my pockets. No weapons  being found, he said, \"Let him go. We've done damage here  enough.\"    These interruptions were getting to be distressingly frequent. I had  journeyed but a few hundred yards farther when a surly fellow  sprang out from behind a wagon and in a raucous voice bade me  \"Stand by.\" He had an evil glint in his eye, and was ready to go out  of his way hunting trouble. Totally dissatisfied with any answer I  could make, he kept roaring louder and louder. There was no  doubt that he was venting his spleen upon an unprotected and  humble civilian, and that he was thoroughly enjoying seeing me  cringe under his bulldozing. It flashed upon me that he might be a  self-appointed guardian of the way. So when he began to wax still  more arrogant, I simply said, \"Take me to your superior officer.\"    He softened down like a child, and, standing aside, motioned me  along.    I would put nothing past a bully of that stripe. He was capable of  committing any kind of an atrocity. And his sort undoubtedly did.  But what else can one expect from a conscript army, which, as it  puts every man on its roster, must necessarily contain the worst as  well as the best? Draft 1,000 men out of any community in any  country and along with the decent citizens there will be a certain  number of cowards, braggarts and brutes. When occasion offers  they will rob, rape and murder. To such a vicious strain this fellow  belonged.    The soldier whom next I encountered is really typical of the  Gemutlichheit of the men who, on the 20th of August, were  encamped along the Meuse River. I was moving along fast now  under the cover of a hedge which paralleled the road when a voice  called out \"Halt!\" In a step or two I came to a stop. A large fellow  climbed over the hedge, and, coming on the road, fell, or rather  stumbled over himself, into the ditch. I was afraid he was drunk,  and that this tumble would add vexation to his spirits; but he was  only tired and over-weighted, carrying a big knapsack and a gun, a  number of articles girdled around his waist, along with too much  avoirdupois. It seems that even in this conquered territory the  Germans never relaxed their vigilance. Fully a thousand men  stood guarding the pontoon bridge, and this man, who had gone  out foraging and was returning with a bottle of milk, carried his full  fighting equipment with him, as did all the others. I gave him a  hand and pulled him to his feet, offering to help carry something,  as he was breathing heavily; but he refused my aid. As we walked  along together I gave him my last stick of chocolate, and, being  assured by my demeanor that I was a friend, he showed a real  kindly, fatherly interest in me.    \"A bunch of robbers, that's what these Belgians are,\" he"]]]
