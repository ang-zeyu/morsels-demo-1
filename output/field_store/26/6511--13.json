[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9069"],[0,"Saint Augustin (#13)"],[1,"of Africa was no less  considerable than the old metropolis of the Hanno and Barcine factions.  With a population almost as large as that of Rome, it had almost as great  a circumference. It must further be recalled that as it had no ramparts  till the Vandal invasion, the city overflowed into the country. With its  gardens, villas, and burial-places of the dead, it covered nearly the  entire peninsula, to-day depopulated.    Carthage, as well as Rome, had her Capitol and Palatine upon Mount Byrsa,  where rose no doubt a temple consecrated to the Capitolean triune deities,  Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, not far from the great temple of AEsculapius, a  modern transformation of the old Punic Eschmoum. Hard by these sanctuaries,  the Proconsul's palace dominated Carthage from the height of the acclivity  of the Acropolis. The Forum was at the foot of the hill, probably in the  neighbourhood of the ports--a Forum built and arranged in the Roman way,  with its shops of bankers and money-changers placed under the circular  galleries, with the traditional image of Marsyas, and a number of statues  of local celebrities. Apuleius no doubt had his there. Further off was the  Harbour Square, where gathered foreigners recently landed and the idlers of  the city in search of news, and where the booksellers offered the new books  and pamphlets. There was to be seen one of the curiosities of Carthage--a  mosaic representing fabulous monsters, men without heads, and men with only  one leg and one foot--a huge foot under which, lying upon their backs, they  sheltered from the sun, as under a parasol. On account of this feature they  were called the _sciapodes_. Augustin, who like everybody else had paused  before these grotesque figures, recalls them somewhere to his readers....  Beside the sea, in the lower town and upon the two near hills of the  Acropolis, were a number of detached buildings that the old authors have  preserved the names of and briefly described. Thanks to the zeal of  archaeologists, it is now become impossible to tell where they stood.    The pagan sanctuaries were numerous. That of the goddess Coelestis, the  great patroness of Carthage, occupied a space of five thousand feet. It  comprised, besides the actual [Greek: hieron], where stood the image of the  goddess, gardens, sacred groves, and courts surrounded with columns. The  ancient Phoenician Moloch had also his temple under the name of Saturn.  They called him _The Old One_, so Augustin tells us, and his worshippers  were falling away. On the other hand, Carthage had another sanctuary which  was very fashionable, a _Serapeum_ as at Alexandria, where were manifested  the pomps of the Egyptian ritual, celebrated by Apuleius. Neighbouring  the holy places, came the places of amusement: the theatre, the Odeum,  circus, stadium, and amphitheatre--this last, of equal dimensions with  the Colosseum at Rome, its gallery rising upon gallery, and its realistic  sculptures of animals and artisans. Then there were the buildings for the  public service: the immense cisterns of the East and the Malga, the great  aqueduct, which, after being carried along a distance of fifty-five miles,  emptied the water of the Zaghouan into the reservoirs at Carthage. Finally,  there were the Baths, some of which we know--those of Antoninus and of  Maximianus, and those of Gargilius, where one of the most important  Councils known to the history of the African Church assembled. There were  likewise many Christian basilicas at the time of Augustin. The authors  mention seventeen: it is likely there were more. That of Damous-el-Karita,  the only one of which considerable traces have been found, was vast and  richly decorated, and was perhaps the cathedral of Carthage.    What other buildings there were are utterly lost to history. It  may be conjectured, however, that Carthage, as well as Rome, had a  _septizonium_--a decorative building with peristyles one above the other  which surrounded a reservoir. In fact, it is claimed that the one at  Rome was copied from Carthage. Straight streets paved with large flags  intersected around these buildings, forming a network of long avenues, very  bright and ventilated. Some of them were celebrated in the ancient world  either for their beauty or the animation of their trade: the street of the  Jewellers, the street of Health, of Saturn, of Coelestis, too, or of Juno.  The fig and vegetable markets and the public granaries were also some of  the main centres of Carthaginian life.    It is unquestionable that Carthage, with its buildings and statues, its  squares, avenues and public gardens, looked like a large capital, and was  a perfect example of that ideal of rather brutal magnificence and strength  which the Romans obtruded everywhere.    And even while it dazzled the young provincial from Thagaste, the African  Rome shewed him the virtue of order--social and political order. Carthage,  the metropolis of Western Africa, maintained an army of officials who  handled the government in its smallest details. First of all, there  were the representatives of the central power, the imperial rulers--the  Proconsul, a sort of vice-emperor, who was surrounded by a full court, a  civil and military staff, a privy council, an _officium_ which included a  crowd of dignitaries and subaltern clerks. Then there was the Propraetor  of Africa who, being in control of the government of the whole African  province, had an _officium_ still larger perhaps than the Proconsul's.  After them came the city magistrates, who were aided in their functions by  the Council of the Decurions--the Senate of Carthage. These Carthaginian  senators cut a considerable figure: for them their colleagues at Rome  were full of airs and graces, and the Emperors endeavoured to keep them  in a good-humour. All the details of city government came under their  supervision: the slaughter-houses, buildings, the gathering of municipal  taxes, and the police, which comprised even the guardians of the Forum.  Then there were the army and navy. The home port of a grain-carrying fleet  which conveyed the African cereals to Ostia, Carthage could starve Rome  if she liked. The grain and oil of all countries lay in her docks--the  storehouses of the state provisions, which were in charge of a special  prefect who had under his orders a whole corporation of overseers and  clerks.    Augustin must have heard a good deal of grumbling at Carthage against this  excess of officialism. But, all the same, so well-governed a city was a  very good school for a young man who was to combine later the duties of  bishop, judge, and governor. The blessings of order, of what was called  \"the Roman peace\" no doubt impressed him the more, as he himself came from  a turbulent district often turned upside down by the quarrels of religious  sects and by the depredations of the nomads--a boundary-land of the Sahara  regions where it was much harder to bring the central government into  play than in Carthage and the coast-towns. To appreciate the beauty of  government, there is nothing like living in a country where all is at the  mercy of force or the first-comer's will. Such of the Barbarians who came  in contact with Roman civilization were overcome with admiration for the  good order that it established. But what astonished them more than anything  else was that the Empire was everywhere.    No man, whatever his race or country, could help feeling proud to belong to  the Roman city. He was at home in all the countries in the world subject  to Rome. Our Europe, split into nationalities, can hardly understand now  this feeling of pride, so different from our narrow patriotisms. The way to  feel something of it is to go to the colonies: out there the least of us  may believe himself a sovereign, simply from the fact that he is a subject  of the governing country. This feeling was very strong in the old world.  Carthage, where the striking effect of the Empire appeared in all its  brilliancy, would increase it in Augustin. He had only to look around him  to value the extent of the privilege conferred by Rome on her citizens. Men  coming from all countries, without exception of race, were, so to speak,  made partners of the Empire and collaborated in the grandeur of the Roman  scheme. If the Proconsul who then occupied the Byrsa palace, the celebrated  Symmachus, belonged to an old Italian family, he whom he represented,  the Emperor Valentinian, was the son of a Pannonian soldier. The Count  Theodosius, the general who suppressed the insurrection of Firmus in  Mauretania, was a Spaniard, and the army he led into Africa was made up,  for the most part, of Gauls. Later on, under Arcadius, another Gaul,  Rufinus, shall be master of the whole of the East.    An active mind like Augustin's could not remain indifferent before this  spectacle of the world thrown open by Rome to all men of talent. He had the  soul of a poet, quick to enthusiasm; the sight of the Eagles planted on  the Acropolis at Carthage moved him in a way he never forgot. He acquired  the habit of seeing big, and began to cast off race prejudices and all the  petty narrowness of a local spirit. When he became a Christian he did not  close himself up, like the Donatists, within the African Church. His dream  was that Christ's Empire upon earth should equal the Empire of the Caesars.    Still, it is desirable not to fall into error upon this Roman unity.  Behind the imposing front it shewed from one end to the other of the  Mediterranean, the variety of peoples, with their manners, traditions,  special religions, was always there, and in Africa more than elsewhere.  The population of Carthage was astonishingly mixed. The hybrid character  of this country without unity was illustrated by the streaks found in the  Carthaginian crowds.

XXXVI. Ac primo congressu eminus certabatur simul constantia, simul arte  Britanni ingentibus gladiis et brevibus cetris missilia nostrorum vitare  vel excutere, atque ipsi magnam vim telorum superfundere: donec Agricola  Batavorum cohortes ac Tungrorum duas cohortatus est, ut rem ad mucrones  ac manus adducerent: quod et ipsis vetustate militiae exercitatum, et  hostibus inhabile parva scuta et enormes gladios gerentibus: nam  Britannorum gladii sine mucrone complexum armorum et in aperto pugnam non  tolerabant. Igitur, ut Batavi miscere ictus, ferire umbonibus, ora  foedare, et stratis qui in aequo obstiterant, erigere in colles aciem  coepere, ceterae cohortes, aemulatione et impetu commistae, proximos  quosque caedere; ac plerique semineces aut integri festinatione victoriae  relinquebantur. Interim equitum turmae fugere, covinarii peditum se  proelio miscuere: et, quanquam recentem terrorem intulerant, densis tamen  hostium agminibus et inaequalibus locis haerebant: minimeque equestris ea  pugnae facies erat, cum aegre diu stantes simul equorum corporibus  impellerentur, ac saepe vagi currus, exterriti sine rectoribus equi, ut  quemque formido tulerat, transversos aut obvios incursabant.    XXXVII. Et Britanni, qui adhuc pugnae expertes summa collium insederant  et paucitatem nostrorum vacui spernebant, degredi paulatim et circumire  terga vincentium coeperant: ni id ipsum veritus Agricola, quatuor equitum  alas, ad subita belli retentas, venientibus opposuisset, quantoque  ferocius accurrerant, tanto acrius pulsos in fugam disjecisset. Ita  consilium Britannorum in ipsos versum: transvectaeque praecepto ducis a  fronte pugnantium alae, aversam hostium aciem invasere. Tum vero  patentibus locis grande et atrox spectaculum: sequi, vulnerare, capere  atque eosdem, oblatis aliis, trucidare. Jam hostium, prout cuique  ingenium erat, catervae armatorum paucioribus terga praestare, quidam  inermes ultro ruere ac se morti offerre; passim arma et corpora et laceri  artus et cruenta humus: et aliquando etiam victis ira virtusque; postquam  silvis appropinquarunt, collecti primos sequentium incautos et locorum  ignaros circumveniebant. Quod ni frequens ubique Agricola validas et  expeditas cohortes indaginis modo, et, sicubi arctiora erant, partem  equitum dimissis equis, simul rariores silvas equitem persultare  jussisset, acceptum aliquod vulnus per nimiam fiduciam foret. Ceterum,  ubi compositos firmis ordinibus sequi rursus videre, in fugam versi, non  agminibus, ut prius, nec alius alium respectantes, rari et vitabundi  invicem, longinqua atque avia petiere. Finis sequendi nox et satietas  fuit: caesa hostium ad decem millia: nostrorum trecenti sexaginta  cecidere: in quis Aulus Atticus praefectus cohortis, juvenili ardore et  ferocia equi hostibus illatus.    XXXVIII. Et nox quidem gaudio praedaque laeta victoribus: Britanni  palantes, mixtoque virorum mulierumque ploratu, trahere vulneratos,  vocare integros, deserere domos ac per iram ultro incendere: eligere  latebras et statim relinquere: miscere invicem consilia aliqua, dein  separare: aliquando frangi aspectu pignorum suorum, saepius concitari:  satisque constabat, saevisse quosdam in conjuges ac liberos, tanquam  misererentur. Proximus dies faciem victoriae latius aperuit: vastum  ubique silentium, secreti colles, fumantia procul tecta, nemo  exploratoribus obvius: quibus in omnem partem dimissis, ubi incerta fugae  vestigia neque usquam conglobari hostes compertum et exacta jam aestate  spargi bellum nequibat, in fines Horestorum exercitum deducit. Ibi  acceptis obsidibus, praefecto classis circumvehi Britanniam praecepit.  Datae ad id vires, et praecesserat terror. Ipse peditem atque equites  lento itinere, quo novarum gentium animi ipsa transitus mora terrerentur,  in hibernis locavit. Et simul classis secunda tempestate ac fama  Trutulensem portum tenuit, unde proximo latere Britanniae lecto omni  redierat.    XXXIX. Hunc rerum cursum, quanquam nulla verborum jactantia epistolis  Agricolae actum, ut Domitiano moris erat, fronte laetus, pectore anxius  excepit. Inerat conscientia derisui fuisse nuper falsum e Germania  triumphum, emptis per commercia, quorum habitus et crines in captivorum  speciem formarentur: at nunc veram magnamque victoriam, tot millibus  hostium caesis, ingenti fama celebrari. Id sibi maxime formidolosum,  privati hominis nomen supra principis attolli: frustra studia fori et  civilium artium decus in silentium acta, si militarem gloriam alius  occuparet: et cetera utcumque facilius dissimulari: ducis boni  imperatoriam virtutem esse. Talibus curis exercitus, quodque saevae  cogitationis indicium erat, secreto suo satiatus, optimum in praesentia  statuit reponere odium, donec impetus famae et favor exercitus  languesceret: nam etiam tum Agricola Britanniam obtinebat.    XL. Igitur triumphalia ornamenta et illustris statuae honorem et quidquid  pro triumpho datur, multo verborum honore cumulata, decerni in senatu  jubet; addique insuper opinionem, Syriam provinciam Agricolae destinari,  vacuam tum morte Atilii Rufi consularis et majoribus reservatam.  Credidere plerique libertum ex secretioribus ministeriis missum ad  Agricolam codicillos, quibus ei Syria dabatur, tulisse cum praecepto, ut,  si in Britannia foret, traderentur: eumque libertum in ipso freto Oceani  obvium Agricolae, ne appellato quidem eo, ad Domitianum remeasse: sive  verum istud, sive ex ingenio principis fictum ac compositum est.  Tradiderat interim Agricola successori suo provinciam quietam tutamque.  Ac, ne notabilis celebritate et frequentia occurrentium introitus esset,  vitato amicorum officio, noctu in urbem, noctu in palatium, ita ut  praeceptum erat, venit: exceptusque brevi osculo et nullo sermone turbae  servientium immixtus est. Ceterum, ut militare nomen, grave inter  otiosos, aliis virtutibus temperaret, tranquillitatem atque otium penitus  auxit, cultu modicus, sermone facilis, uno aut altero amicorum comitatus;  adeo ut plerique quibus magnos viros per ambitionem aestimare mos est,  viso aspectoque Agricola, quaererent famam, pauci interpretarentur.    XLI. Crebro per eos dies apud Domitianum absens accusatus, absens  absolutus est. Causa periculi non crimen ullum aut querela laesi  cujusquam, sed infensus virtutibus princeps et gloria viri ac pessimum  inimicorum genus, laudantes. Et ea insecuta sunt reipublicae tempora,  quae sileri Agricolam non sinerent: tot exercitus in Moesia Daciaque et  Germania Pannoniaque, temeritate aut per ignaviam ducum amissi: tot  militares viri cum tot cohortibus expugnati et capti: nec jam de limite  imperii et ripa, sed de hibernis legionum et possessione dubitatum. Ita,  cum damna damnis continuarentur atque omnis annus funeribus et cladibus  insigniretur, poscebatur ore vulgi dux Agricola: comparantibus cunctis  vigorem, constantiam et expertum bellis animum cum inertia et formidine  ceterorum. Quibus sermonibus satis constat Domitiani quoque aures  verberatas, dum optimus quisque libertorum amore et fide, pessimi  malignitate et livore, pronum deterioribus principem exstimulabant. Sic  Agricola simul suis virtutibus, simul vitiis aliorum, in ipsam gloriam  praeceps agebatur.    XLII. Aderat jam annus, quo proconsulatum Asiae et Africae sortiretur, et  occiso Civica nuper nec Agricolae consilium deerat, nec Domitiano  exemplum. Accessere quidam cogitationum principis periti, qui, iturusne  esset in provinciam, ultro Agricolam interrogarent: ac primo occultius  quietem et otium laudare, mox operam suam in approbanda excusatione  offerre: postremo non jam obscuri, suadentes simul terrentesque,  pertraxere ad Domitianum; qui paratus simulatione, in arrogantiam  compositus, et audiit preces excusantis, et, cum annuisset, agi sibi  gratias passus est: nec erubuit beneficii invidia. Salarium tamen,  proconsulari solitum offerri et quibusdam a se ipso concessum, Agricolae  non dedit: sive offensus non petitum, sive ex conscientia, ne, quod  vetuerat, videretur emisse. Proprium humani ingenii est, odisse quem  laeseris: Domitiani vero natura praeceps in iram, et quo obscurior, eo  irrevocabilior, moderatione tamen prudentiaque Agricolae leniebatur: quia  non contumacia neque inani jactatione libertatis famam fatumque  provocabat. Sciant. quibus moris illicita mirari, posse etiam sub malis  principibus magnos viros esse: obsequiumque ac modestiam, si industria ac  vigor adsint, eo laudis excedere, quo plerique per abrupta, sed in nullum  reipublicae usum, ambitiosa morte inclaruerunt.    XLIII. Finis vitae ejus nobis luctuosus, amicis tristis, extraneis etiam  ignotisque non sine cura fuit. Vulgus quoque et hic aliud agens populus  et ventitavere ad domum, et per fora et circulos locuti sunt: nec  quisquam audita morte Agricolae aut laetatus est aut statim oblitus.  Augebat miserationem constans rumor, veneno interceptum. Nobis nihil  comperti affirmare ausim: ceterum per omnem valetudinem ejus, crebrius  quam ex more principatus per nuntios visentis, et libertorum primi et  medicorum intimi venere: sive cura illud sive inquisitio erat. Supremo  quidem die, momenta deficientis per dispositos cursores nuntiata  constabat, nullo credente sic accelerari, quae tristis audiret. Speciem  tamen doloris animo vultuque prae se tulit, securus jam odii, et qui  facilius dissimularet gaudium, quam metum. Satis constabat, lecto  testamento Agricolae, quo cohaeredem optimae uxori et piissimae filiae  Domitianum scripsit, laetatum eum velut honore judicioque: tam caeca et  corrupta mens assiduis adulationibus erat, ut nesciret a bono patre non  scribi haeredem, nisi malum principem.    XLIV. Natus erat Agricola, Caio Caesare tertium consule, Idibus Juniis:  excessit sexto et quinquagesimo anno, decimo Kalendas Septembris, Collega  Priscoque consulibus. Quod si habitum quoque ejus posteri noscere velint,  decentior quam sublimior fuit; nihil metus in vultu, gratia oris"]]]
