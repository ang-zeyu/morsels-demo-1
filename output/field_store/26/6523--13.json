It  is much nicer to be free, even though I still bear the enchanted form  of a Canary-Bird.\"    \"Do you think we shall ever be able to get our proper forms back  again?\" asked the Green Monkey earnestly.    Polychrome did not make reply at once to this important question, but  after a period of thoughtfulness she said:    \"I have been taught to believe that there is an antidote for every  magic charm, yet Mrs. Yoop insists that no power can alter her  transformations. I realize that my own fairy magic cannot do it,  although I have thought that we Sky Fairies have more power than is  accorded to Earth Fairies. The yookoohoo magic is admitted to be very  strange in its workings and different from the magic usually practiced,  but perhaps Glinda or Ozma may understand it better than I. In them  lies our only hope. Unless they can help us, we must remain forever as  we are.\"    \"A Canary-Bird on a Rainbow wouldn't be so bad,\" asserted the Tin Owl,  winking and blinking with his round tin eyes, \"so if you can manage to  find your Rainbow again you need have little to worry about.\"    \"That's nonsense, Friend Chopper,\" exclaimed Woot. \"I know just how  Polychrome feels. A beautiful girl is much superior to a little yellow  bird, and a boy--such as I was--far better than a Green Monkey. Neither  of us can be happy again unless we recover our rightful forms.\"    \"I feel the same way,\" announced the stuffed Bear. \"What do you suppose  my friend the Patchwork Girl would think of me, if she saw me wearing  this beastly shape?\"    \"She'd laugh till she cried,\" admitted the Tin Owl. \"For my part, I'll  have to give up the notion of marrying Nimmie Amee, but I'll try not to  let that make me unhappy. If it's my duty, I'd like to do my duty, but  if magic prevents my getting married I'll flutter along all by myself  and be just as contented.\"    Their serious misfortunes made them all silent for a time, and as their  thoughts were busy in dwelling upon the evils with which fate had  burdened them, none noticed that Jinjur had suddenly appeared in the  doorway and was looking at them in astonishment. The next moment her  astonishment changed to anger, for there, in her best rocking-chair,  sat a Green Monkey. A great shiny Owl perched upon another chair and a  Brown Bear squatted upon her parlor rug. Jinjur did not notice the  Canary, but she caught up a broomstick and dashed into the room,  shouting as she came:    \"Get out of here, you wild creatures!  How dare you enter my house?\"    With a blow of her broom she knocked the Brown Bear over, and the Tin  Owl tried to fly out of her reach and made a great clatter with his tin  wings. The Green Monkey was so startled by the sudden attack that he  sprang into the fireplace--where there was fortunately no fire--and  tried to escape by climbing up the chimney. But he found the opening  too small, and so was forced to drop down again. Then he crouched  trembling in the fireplace, his pretty green hair all blackened with  soot and covered with ashes. From this position Woot watched to see  what would happen next.    \"Stop, Jinjur--stop!\" cried the Brown Bear, when the broom again  threatened him. \"Don't you know me? I'm your old friend the Scarecrow?\"    \"You're trying to deceive me, you naughty beast! I can see plainly that  you are a bear, and a mighty poor specimen of a bear, too,\" retorted  the girl.    \"That's because I'm not properly stuffed,\" he assured her. \"When Mrs.  Yoop transformed me, she didn't realize I should have more stuffing.\"    \"Who is Mrs. Yoop?\" inquired Jinjur, pausing with the broom still  upraised.    \"A Giantess in the Gillikin Country.\"    \"Oh; I begin to understand. And Mrs. Yoop transformed you? You are  really the famous Scarecrow of Oz.\"    \"I was, Jinjur. Just now I'm as you see me--a miserable little Brown  Bear with a poor quality of stuffing. That Tin Owl is none other than  our dear Tin Woodman--Nick Chopper, the Emperor of the Winkies--while  this Green Monkey is a nice little boy we recently became acquainted  with, Woot the Wanderer.\"    \"And I,\" said the Canary, flying close to Jinjur, \"am Polychrome, the  Daughter of the Rainbow, in the form of a bird.\"    \"Goodness me!\" cried Jinjur, amazed; \"that Giantess must be a powerful  Sorceress, and as wicked as she is powerful.\"    \"She's a yookoohoo,\" said Polychrome. \"Fortunately, we managed to  escape from her castle, and we are now on our way to Glinda the Good to  see if she possesses the power to restore us to our former shapes.\"    \"Then I must beg your pardons; all of you must forgive me,\" said  Jinjur, putting away the broom. \"I took you to be a lot of wild,  unmannerly animals, as was quite natural. You are very welcome to my  home and I'm sorry I haven't the power to help you out of your  troubles. Please use my house and all that I have, as if it were your  own.\"    At this declaration of peace, the Bear got upon his feet and the Owl  resumed his perch upon the chair and the Monkey crept out of the  fireplace. Jinjur looked at Woot critically, and scowled.    \"For a Green Monkey,\" said she, \"you're the blackest creature I ever  saw. And you'll get my nice clean room all dirty with soot and ashes.  Whatever possessed you to jump up the chimney?\"    \"I--I was scared,\" explained Woot, somewhat ashamed.    \"Well, you need renovating, and that's what will happen to you, right  away. Come with me!\" she commanded.    \"What are you going to do?\" asked Woot.    \"Give you a good scrubbing,\" said Jinjur.    Now, neither boys nor monkeys relish being scrubbed, so Woot shrank  away from the energetic girl, trembling fearfully. But Jinjur grabbed  him by his paw and dragged him out to the back yard, where, in spite of  his whines and struggles, she plunged him into a tub of cold water and  began to scrub him with a stiff brush and a cake of yellow soap.    This was the hardest trial that Woot had endured since he became a  monkey, but no protest had any influence with Jinjur, who lathered and  scrubbed him in a business-like manner and afterward dried him with a  coarse towel.    The Bear and the Owl gravely watched this operation and nodded approval  when Woot's silky green fur shone clear and bright in the afternoon  sun. The Canary seemed much amused and laughed a silvery ripple of  laughter as she said:    \"Very well done, my good Jinjur; I admire your energy and judgment. But  I had no idea a monkey could look so comical as this monkey did while  he was being bathed.\"    \"I'm not a monkey!\" declared Woot, resentfully; \"I'm just a boy in a  monkey's shape, that's all.\"    \"If you can explain to me the difference,\" said Jinjur, \"I'll agree not  to wash you again--that is, unless you foolishly get into the  fireplace. All persons are usually judged by the shapes in which they  appear to the eyes of others. Look at me, Woot; what am I?\"    Woot looked at her.    \"You're as pretty a girl as I've ever seen,\" he replied.    Jinjur frowned. That is, she tried hard to frown.    \"Come out into the garden with me,\" she said, \"and I'll give you some  of the most delicious caramels you ever ate. They're a new variety,  that no one can grow but me, and they have a heliotrope flavor.\"          Chapter Twelve    Ozma and Dorothy      In her magnificent palace in the Emerald City, the beautiful girl Ruler  of all the wonderful Land of Oz sat in her dainty boudoir with her  friend Princess Dorothy beside her. Ozma was studying a roll of  manuscript which she had taken from the Royal Library, while Dorothy  worked at her embroidery and at times stooped to pat a shaggy little  black dog that lay at her feet. The little dog's name was Toto, and he  was Dorothy's faithful companion.    To judge Ozma of Oz by the standards of our world, you would think her  very young--perhaps fourteen or fifteen years of age--yet for years she  had ruled the Land of Oz and had never seemed a bit older. Dorothy  appeared much younger than Ozma. She had been a little girl when first  she came to the Land of Oz, and she was a little girl still, and would  never seem to be a day older while she lived in this wonderful  fairyland.    Oz was not always a fairyland, I am told. Once it was much like other  lands, except it was shut in by a dreadful desert of sandy wastes that  lay all around it, thus preventing its people from all contact with the  rest of the world. Seeing this isolation, the fairy band of Queen  Lurline, passing over Oz while on a journey, enchanted the country and  so made it a Fairyland. And Queen Lurline left one of her fairies to  rule this enchanted Land of Oz, and then passed on and forgot all about  it.    From that moment no one in Oz ever died. Those who were old remained  old; those who were young and strong did not change as years passed  them by; the children remained children always, and played and romped  to their hearts' content, while all the babies lived in their cradles  and were tenderly cared for and never grew up. So people in Oz stopped  counting how old they were in years, for years made no difference in  their appearance and could not alter their station. They did not get  sick, so there were no doctors among them. Accidents might happen to  some, on rare occasions, it is true, and while no one could die  naturally, as other people do, it was possible that one might be  totally destroyed. Such incidents, however, were very unusual, and so  seldom was there anything to worry over that the Oz"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/961"],[0,"Glinda of Oz (#13)"],[1," oiled and moved smoothly. He  carried a gleaming axe to prove he was a woodman, but seldom had cause  to use it because he lived in a magnificent tin castle in the Winkie  Country of Oz and was the Emperor of all the Winkies. The Tin Woodman's  name was Nick Chopper. He had a very good mind, but his heart was not  of much account, so he was very careful to do nothing unkind or to hurt  anyone's feelings.    Another counsellor was Scraps, the Patchwork Girl of Oz, who was made  of a gaudy patchwork quilt, cut into shape and stuffed with cotton.  This Patchwork Girl was very intelligent, but so full of fun and mad  pranks that a lot of more stupid folks thought she must be crazy.  Scraps was jolly under all conditions, however grave they might be, but  her laughter and good spirits were of value in cheering others and in  her seemingly careless remarks much wisdom could often be found.    Then there was the Shaggy Man--shaggy from head to foot, hair and  whiskers, clothes and shoes--but very kind and gentle and one of Ozma's  most loyal supporters.    Tik-Tok was there, a copper man with machinery inside him, so cleverly  constructed that he moved, spoke and thought by three separate  clock-works. Tik-Tok was very reliable because he always did exactly  what he was wound up to do, but his machinery was liable to run down at  times and then he was quite helpless until wound up again.    A different sort of person was Jack Pumpkinhead, one of Ozma's oldest  friends and her companion on many adventures. Jack's body was very  crude and awkward, being formed of limbs of trees of different sizes,  jointed with wooden pegs. But it was a substantial body and not likely  to break or wear out, and when it was dressed the clothes covered much  of its roughness. The head of Jack Pumpkinhead was, as you have  guessed, a ripe pumpkin, with the eyes, nose and mouth carved upon one  side. The pumpkin was stuck on Jack's wooden neck and was liable to get  turned sidewise or backward and then he would have to straighten it  with his wooden hands.    The worst thing about this sort of a head was that it did not keep well  and was sure to spoil sooner or later. So Jack's main business was to  grow a field of fine pumpkins each year, and always before his old head  spoiled he would select a fresh pumpkin from the field and carve the  features on it very neatly, and have it ready to replace the old head  whenever it became necessary. He didn't always carve it the same way,  so his friends never knew exactly what sort of an expression they would  find on his face. But there was no mistaking him, because he was the  only pumpkin-headed man alive in the Land of Oz.    A one-legged sailor-man was a member of Ozma's council. His name was  Cap'n Bill and he had come to the Land of Oz with Trot, and had been  made welcome on account of his cleverness, honesty and good nature. He  wore a wooden leg to replace the one he had lost and was a great friend  of all the children in Oz because he could whittle all sorts of toys  out of wood with his big jack-knife.    Professor H. M. Wogglebug, T. E., was another member of the council.  The \"H. M.\" meant Highly Magnified, for the Professor was once a little  bug, who became magnified to the size of a man and always remained so.  The \"T. E.\" meant that he was Thoroughly Educated. He was at the head  of Princess Ozma's Royal Athletic College, and so that the students  would not have to study and so lose much time that could be devoted to  athletic sports, such as football, baseball and the like, Professor  Wogglebug had invented the famous Educational Pills. If one of the  college students took a Geography Pill after breakfast, he knew his  geography lesson in an instant; if he took a Spelling Pill he at once  knew his spelling lesson, and an Arithmetic Pill enabled the student to  do any kind of sum without having to think about it.    These useful pills made the college very popular and taught the boys  and girls of Oz their lessons in the easiest possible way. In spite of  this, Professor Wogglebug was not a favorite outside his college, for  he was very conceited and admired himself so much and displayed his  cleverness and learning so constantly, that no one cared to associate  with him. Ozma found him of value in her councils, nevertheless.    Perhaps the most splendidly dressed of all those present was a great  frog as large as a man, called the Frogman, who was noted for his wise  sayings. He had come to the Emerald City from the Yip Country of Oz and  was a guest of honor. His long-tailed coat was of velvet, his vest of  satin and his trousers of finest silk. There were diamond buckles on  his shoes and he carried a gold-headed cane and a high silk hat. All of  the bright colors were represented in his rich attire, so it tired  one's eyes to look at him for long, until one became used to his  splendor.    The best farmer in all Oz was Uncle Henry, who was Dorothy's own uncle,  and who now lived near the Emerald City with his wife Aunt Em. Uncle  Henry taught the Oz people how to grow the finest vegetables and fruits  and grains and was of much use to Ozma in keeping the Royal Storehouses  well filled. He, too, was a counsellor.    The reason I mention the little Wizard of Oz last is because he was the  most important man in the Land of Oz. He wasn't a big man in size but  he was a man in power and intelligence and second only to Glinda the  Good in all the mystic arts of magic. Glinda had taught him, and the  Wizard and the Sorceress were the only ones in Oz permitted by law to  practice wizardry and sorcery, which they applied only to good uses and  for the benefit of the people.    The Wizard wasn't exactly handsome but he was pleasant to look at. His  bald head was as shiny as if it had been varnished; there was always a  merry twinkle in his eyes and he was as spry as a schoolboy.  Dorothy  says the reason the Wizard is not as powerful as Glinda is because  Glinda didn't teach him all she knows, but what the Wizard knows he  knows very well and so he performs some very remarkable magic. The ten  I have mentioned assembled, with the Scarecrow and Glinda, in Ozma's  throne room, right after dinner that evening, and the Sorceress told  them all she knew of the plight of Ozma and Dorothy.    \"Of course we must rescue them,\" she continued, \"and the sooner they  are rescued the better pleased they will be; but what we must now  determine is how they can be saved. That is why I have called you  together in council.\"    \"The easiest way,\" remarked the Shaggy Man, \"is to raise the sunken  island of the Skeezers to the top of the water again.\"    \"Tell me how?\" said Glinda.    \"I don't know how, your Highness, for I have never raised a sunken  island.\"    \"We might all get under it and lift,\" suggested Professor Wogglebug.    \"How can we get under it when it rests on the bottom of the lake?\"  asked the Sorceress.    \"Couldn't we throw a rope around it and pull it ashore?\" inquired Jack  Pumpkinhead.    \"Why not pump the water out of the lake?\" suggested the Patchwork Girl  with a laugh.    \"Do be sensible!\" pleaded Glinda. \"This is a serious matter, and we  must give it serious thought.\"    \"How big is the lake and how big is the island?\" was the Frogman's  question.    \"None of us can tell, for we have not been there.\"    \"In that case,\" said the Scarecrow, \"it appears to me we ought to go to  the Skeezer country and examine it carefully.\"    \"Quite right,\" agreed the Tin Woodman.    \"We-will-have-to-go-there-any-how,\" remarked Tik-Tok in his jerky  machine voice.    \"The question is which of us shall go, and how many of us?\" said the  Wizard.    \"I shall go of course,\" declared the Scarecrow.    \"And I,\" said Scraps.    \"It is my duty to Ozma to go,\" asserted the Tin Woodman.    \"I could not stay away, knowing our loved Princess is in danger,\" said  the Wizard.    \"We all feel like that,\" Uncle Henry said.    Finally one and all present decided to go to the Skeezer country, with  Glinda and the little Wizard to lead them. Magic must meet magic in  order to conquer it, so these two skillful magic-workers were necessary  to insure the success of the expedition.    They were all ready to start at a moment's notice, for none had any  affairs of importance to attend to. Jack was wearing a newly made  Pumpkin-head and the Scarecrow had recently been stuffed with fresh  straw. Tik-Tok's machinery was in good running order and the Tin  Woodman always was well oiled.    \"It is quite a long journey,\" said Glinda, \"and while I might travel  quickly to the Skeezer country by means of my stork chariot the rest of  you will be obliged to walk. So, as we must keep together, I will send  my chariot back to my castle and we will plan to leave the Emerald City  at sunrise to-morrow.\"          Chapter Fifteen    The Great Sorceress      Betsy and Trot, when they heard of the rescue expedition, begged the  Wizard to permit them to join it and he consented. The Glass Cat,  overhearing the conversation, wanted to go also and to this the Wizard  made no objection.    This Glass Cat was one of the real curiosities of Oz. It had been made  and brought to life by a clever magician named Dr. Pipt, who was not  now permitted to work magic and was an ordinary citizen of the Emerald  City. The cat was of transparent glass, through which one could plainly  see its ruby heart beating and its pink brains whirling around in the  top of the head.    The Glass Cat's eyes were emeralds; its fluffy tail was of spun glass  and very beautiful. The ruby heart, while pretty to look at, was hard  and cold and the Glass Cat's disposition was not pleasant at all times.  It scorned to catch mice, did not eat, and was extremely lazy. If you  complimented the remarkable cat on her beauty, she would be very  friendly, for she loved admiration above everything. The pink brains  were always working and their owner was indeed more intelligent"]]]
