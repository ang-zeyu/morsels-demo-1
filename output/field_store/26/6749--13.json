Not one  of the dogs that has been brought here since I had charge has been  vicious. Those that seemed dangerous at first grew gentle and kind as  soon as they found no one would hurt them.\"    \"Of course, we know how you feel about them, but the City hires you to  kill the dogs if their owners do not claim or want them. People complain  that you keep the dogs and feed them at the public expense. We can't  have that, you know.\"    Captain Smith rose, and the hand he held out suddenly toward the two men  was trembling. \"I don't know who told you that,\" he said earnestly, \"and  I don't believe that whoever did say it meant to tell an untruth, but  the only dogs that are fed at public cost are those for which I am  allowed money. After any dog has been with me for more than a week, I  pay for his food myself.\"    The two strange men looked at each other and were silent a few minutes.  Finally one of them spoke again,    \"I'm sorry, Smith, but you will have to get rid of the dogs. The pound  is not a boarding place for stray dogs, and the fact that you pay for  their feed after a certain time does not change matters.\"    The old man sat down in his chair as though he were very tired, and  stared at the floor until he felt Jan's nose, and then he looked into  the dog's sympathetic eyes. The wrinkled hand twitched, but the old  man's kindly face turned to the other man.    \"I know you can't change the law,\" he said slowly, \"but if you could let  me have a little more time, I can find homes for all the dogs that are  here now. There are only ten, beside Prince Jan, and he belongs to me.  See\"--he pushed aside the thick hair on the dog's neck--\"I bought a  collar and a license for him, and he has never eaten a mouthful of food  except what I have paid for myself.\"    \"Too many people have complained,\" was the reply. \"The dogs are noisy,  and no one is allowed to have so many dogs inside the city limits. You  know it is against the law, Smith. That settles it.\"    Both men rose to their feet and looked at the old man, but at the door  they stopped and talked together in low voices. Then one of them turned  and said, \"We don't want to be too hard on you, for we know you love  dogs, so we will give you two days to find places for them. After that,  the dogs that are still here must be killed, or you will have to resign  your position as poundmaster.\"    Smith watched them go down the pathway to the front gate, then with low  drooping head and slow steps he went back to the little room. Jan  pressed closely against him as the old man sank into his chair. Cheepsie  flew from his cage and perched on the captain's shoulder, singing  loudly, and Hippity-Hop, not to be left from the little family group,  limped across the room and rubbed, purring, against the old  poundmaster's leg. They knew that he was troubled, and all of them tried  to make him understand they were sorry for him and loved him.    \"We've got to do something for those poor dogs,\" he said to Jan, at  last. \"Even if I do give up my job it won't help them, now. I can't find  homes for them all in such a short time, Jan. Nearly every one I know  here has a dog already, and some of them have two. Folks have been  mighty good taking my dogs.\"    Cheepsie sang an answer, Hippity-Hop purred her reply, and Prince Jan's  tail, thumping the floor, said very plainly that he agreed with his  master. The captain smiled at them all, for he understood their  languages. \"It's bound to work out right, somehow,\" he asserted  cheerfully, and again his three dumb friends answered him.    The next morning Captain Smith left Jan and Hippity-Hop in the front  yard. It was the first time the old man had ever carried his violin with  him, and he trudged briskly down the street, only stopping when he  reached a corner to wave his hand back where Jan and the kitten stood  with noses pushed between the pickets of the fence. Jan was worried  because it was the first time the captain had gone away from the house  without him.    So, while Hippity-Hop climbed trees, chased butterflies, and washed her  face and paws many times, the dog kept perfectly quiet, watching for his  master's return. A big bark welcomed the captain home as Jan ran down  the street to meet him.    \"Come along, Jan,\" the old man was smiling, and the dog trotted beside  him into the pound, where the other dogs pulled on their ropes and  greeted them noisily.    The poundmaster stopped in front of each dog and fastened a small metal  tag to its collar, then he took them all into his own back yard, where  they crowded and leaped about him or chased each other in play. One dog  was so happy that he kept turning around and around after his own short  tail until he was too dizzy to stand up.    \"It's a pretty good-sized family, Jan,\" laughed the old man, as he sat  in a chair on the back porch, smoking his pipe and watching the dogs'  antics. \"They've all got licenses now, so no one can order any of 'em  killed for a year. I guess we can find homes for all of them before that  time is up.\"    So, when the two men came again, Captain Smith took them into the back  yard and showed the license on each dog's collar, as he said, \"I have  found homes for five of them already, and to-morrow I'll take the others  to a friend in the country. He will look out for them until we have good  places for all.\"    He smiled happily at the dogs, then looked up at the two men, but his  smile faded at their next words.    \"Well, what do you intend doing with the next bunch you collect?\"    \"Why, I'll get homes for them, like these others.\"    \"That won't do, Smith. Either you've got to take care of the work as  you are ordered, or else let some other man have your place. What are  you going to do about it?\"    Smith's hand rumpled the fur on Jan's back. The eyes of the dog and the  old man met, then the poundmaster lifted his head and said quietly, \"I  will give up the place. I thought when I took this work that it would  give me a chance to make some poor dumb brutes a little happier and more  comfortable, but I never intended to shoot one of them. Why, I couldn't  do that. They're all my friends!\"    \"All right,\" was the answer. \"Suit yourself. We'll have another man take  charge to-morrow morning.\"    Without further words the men left, and the captain, followed by Jan,  went into the back yard where the ten dogs rushed to meet them. Barking,  leaping, tumbling over each other, they struggled to get close to the  old man who stood smiling and patting them, while he said softly, \"The  best friends a man ever had, Jan.\"    Prince Jan looked at the bunch of dogs, little dogs, big dogs, curs, and  dogs of high breeding. No matter where they had come from, they had  found a protector in the old poundmaster, but they did not know that he  had given up his position because he would not kill them. Even Jan did  not know what his master was writing that evening. It took some time to  get the letter just right, then it was folded, placed in an envelope,  sealed and stamped, and Jan walked with the captain to the letter-box  several blocks away.    When they were home again, the old man sat smoking his pipe and nodding,  then he got up and wound the clock, for it was Saturday night. As he put  the key on top of the clock, he said, \"Well, Jan, we'll have to hunt for  another job on Monday, but I don't think it will take long for us to  find something we can do.\"    Monday morning people came for the dogs, and the captain patted each of  his four-footed friends, before it went to its new home. A man from a  ranch brought an automobile, and into this the five dogs which had not  yet found permanent homes were lifted. Then the captain took out his  worn pocketbook and counted money, which he handed to the rancher.    \"Take good care of them for me,\" said the old man, \"and I'll pay for  their food until we find homes for them all.\"    \"All right, Smith,\" the man answered, and then he drove away with the  yelping dogs.    It was very quiet in the house and back yard, but Hippity-Hop was glad  of it. She had not enjoyed herself while there were so many dogs in the  back of the house. After lunch was over, the captain dressed himself in  his best clothes, put on his hat, and with Jan at his side, went to many  big buildings where he talked earnestly with several men.    They were very kind to him, patted Jan, and promised they would let the  captain know if they saw any work he could do. Jan saw that his old  friend seemed tired after they had been to several places, and when the  dog thrust his nose into the captain's hand, the faded eyes would smile  bravely, as the captain said, \"It's bound to work out right in the end,  Jan.\"    Day after day, they made these trips, and at night Jan lay watching the  face of his master, but the smile was not seen very often now. One  evening the old man was more despondent than ever, so even Jan's wistful  sympathy failed to rouse him, though the hand caressed the dog. Jan's  heart ached, and unable to stand it longer, he pushed his head on the  captain's knee and gave a low whimper.    Captain Smith leaned down and lifted the dog's head between his hands  and looking into his puzzled eyes, he said slowly, \"We're up against it,  Jan. My money is gone, and there does not seem to be any work for me to  do. Every one is very kind, and all promise to send for me, but it is  just because they are sorry. If I were younger, it would be easy to find  plenty to do.\"    Jan licked the gnarled hand and tried to show that he wished he could  help, but the only thing he could do was to show the love and sympathy  that filled his loyal heart. That night when the light was out and  everything was quiet, Jan lay wide awake trying to puzzle out what it  all meant, and then he heard a faint"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14900"],[0,"The Black Man's Place in South Africa (#14)"],[1,"standards of society brought about  by war and revolution, as in those parts of Germany that were recently  garrisoned by coloured soldiers.    Nature having cast upon the male the duty of winning and holding the  females of his species it is easy to see why the racial feelings of  jealousy and ill-will are more positive and more active in the man than  in the woman, and this explains, as far as these things can be  explained, why white men will allow themselves to cohabit freely with  black women to whom they feel naturally attracted but will \"see red\" and  commit murder as soon as they find a black man attempting to gain the  favour of a woman of their own colour. \"Un adolescent aime toutes les  femmes\" say the French, and it is generally accepted that man is by  nature more inclined to polygamy than woman is towards polyandry, still  man and woman are both swayed and motived by the same elemental jealousy  that is born of fear of losing something valued; the emotion which  Descartes has so well defined as \"une espece de crainte qui se rapport  au desir qu'on a de se conserver la possession de quelque bien.\"    It is, no doubt, true that the thinking white woman, no less than the  thinking white man, is led to feel dismay and even resentment against  the Natives by apprehension of the possibility of danger to white  civilisation through fusion of white and black, but this is a feeling  caused by intelligent appreciation rather than by instinctive  apprehension, and as such liable to be dispelled by argument tending to  show that no real danger threatens. During a recent agitation against  miscegenation in Rhodesia a number of letters written by white women  appeared in the press from which it was easy to gather that the chief  concern of the writers was not the possible degradation of the whites,  though this was not overlooked, but rather the simple fact that some  white men were cohabiting with black women to the prejudice of the  matrimonial chances of eligible women of their own race.    But it is unwise to dogmatise in the realms of social and racial  psychology; we have not yet discovered the means for analysing with  precision the subtle elements of the human soul. I have used the word  instinct here in the sense given to it by William James, who defines it  as \"the faculty of acting in such a way as to produce certain ends  without foresight of the ends, and without previous education in the  performance,\" but when we reflect upon the transitoriness of human  instincts, as compared with those of animals, and recognise that the  human instincts are, as James also says, implanted in us for the sake of  giving rise to habits, and then to fade away, we see how difficult it is  to draw a line between the instinctive and the acquired or habitual mood  or feeling.    If we believe that racial antipathy is caused by the feeling of jealousy  that arises instinctively, so to speak, from man's inner nature, then it  is safe to say that it will last as long as the substance from which it  springs, and as long as the racial difference which provokes it remains,  but this belief is not firmly established in the general mind. The  whites, as a whole, feel far from sure about the permanence of their  cherished pride and prejudice of race; they are, more or less  consciously afraid that the antipathy upon which they rely may become  weakened and eventually dissipated by close contact of the two races in  places where economic pressure has reduced both to the same level of  life. We shall do well to remember the words of Renan when we try to  estimate the truth of this matter, \"La verite consiste dans les  nuances,\" for both estimates may be true; the racial instinct may have  to yield here and there to the superior force of economic pressure, and  may yet in the main prove powerful enough to prevent the contact that  tends to render it of no effect.    The racial feeling which we are considering is undoubtedly much stronger  at present in the whites than in the Bantu, but there is reason to  believe that the awakening desire for racial self-assertion which we  call pride of race will grow and increase in the Bantu as it has done  in the Negroes in the Southern States of America, and elsewhere. General  education, so far from hindering the growth of nationalism and racialism  seems in some sort to subserve and foster that growth; witness the  strident self-assertion of the newly-constituted little nations in  Europe, and the cult of \"Nationalism\" in South Africa to-day. It is  natural for birds of feather to flock together and screech together, and  in the same way throughout mankind particular groups of people tend  naturally to keep together and to marry among themselves separately from  the rest of the community by which they happen to be surrounded, and  this ethnic instinct, if so it may be called, is seen to operate even  where, as among the Italian immigrants in America, there is no great  racial difference between them and the Native-born inhabitants, and,  much more markedly, in the Southern States of America where, according  to a recent observer, the present tendency is not towards but away from  miscegenation, so that the ultimate blending of colour is not likely to  take place there in the course of nature.[23]    The normal Native man does not hanker after white women, and the normal  Native woman is not, as a rule, anxious to mate with a white man, but  this normal disposition is apt to be disturbed by the familiarity which  is bred by the close contact that occurs in towns and other centres. It  is not, therefore, safe to deny the possibility that with advancing  industrialism in congested areas there will be some white women ready to  marry or cohabit with Native men who are either in positions of relative  superiority or in possession of more money than their white  fellow-workers or neighbours, making it possible for them to outbid  these in the providing of comparative ease and luxury, which things have  always appealed strongly to women of all races. Yet I think that those  who prophesy the speedy merging of the two races in South Africa do not  give sufficient weight to the fact of the collective consciousness of a  racial entity which, being strongly established in the European section,  is also being fostered and increased in the Natives by the civilisation  which is now spreading among them, so that it seems reasonable to expect  that the European aversion from racial blending will be reciprocated  from the Native side more and more as time goes on, and that this  reciprocal feeling will go far towards keeping the two races  biologically intact. I think, therefore, that despite the conditions  that conduce to miscegenation, the factor of the growing and reciprocal  desire in both races to remain ethnically separate will gain the day.    Many people think that the coloured people in South Africa, who are most  numerous in the vicinity of Cape Town, but are also scattered all over  the country, will form, as it were, a bridge between the two sections of  the population for their eventual coalescence. But when this conclusion  is closely examined it is seen to rest on debatable premises, for it is  admitted that by far the greater part of the miscegenation that is now  going on is between white men and coloured or black women and not  between coloured or black men and white women, from which it follows, as  has been pointed out by Boas,[24] that, as the numbers of children born  does not depend upon the numbers of men but upon the numbers of women,  the result will be a bleaching of the black element, here and there,  and not a darkening of the whites in South Africa.    Statistics have, indeed, been quoted which show that between the year  1904 and the year 1911 the coloured population increased in the Cape  Province by fifteen per cent, while the total population increased by  only six and a half per cent., but these figures do not show how much of  the coloured increase is due to propagation among coloured people  themselves and how much to unions between white men and coloured women.  When it is noted that in the year 1911 the European increase over the  year 1904 in the whole Union of South Africa was 14.28 per cent., and  that of all non-European elements only 15.12 per cent., it will be seen  that although the black increase is on a larger basis it hardly  justifies alarm over an imagined flood of overwhelming coloured numbers.    If the coloured increase is due chiefly to propagation among the  coloured people themselves then it forms a good argument against those  who assert that the half-caste is relatively inclined to sterility,  while if the increase is found to be due to cohabitation of white men  with coloured women then it is a fair illation that the coloured section  is in process of absorption by the whites. This assumed process of  absorption will, no doubt, entail the presence of a certain, even a  large, number of coloured people for many generations to come, but this  number will grow smaller, and not greater, as time goes on because there  is no reason to doubt that the white women of South Africa, as a whole,  will refrain in the future as they have refrained in the past from  cohabiting with black men, so that the observed tendency towards the  diffusion of the coloured element back into the parent streams will be  allowed to continue.    But let us for a moment look calmly, and as far as possible without  prejudice, at the people who in South Africa are said to furnish the  awful example of the alleged evil of the crossing of white and black.  The fact that the denunciation of these people is based on opposite and  contradictory arguments shows that it is not the result of clear  thinking. On the one side it is vehemently asserted that the coloured  man is a physiological misfit, a sort of hybrid unfit for the society  of either white or black and an alleged"]]]
