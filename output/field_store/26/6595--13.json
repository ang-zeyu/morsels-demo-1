[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11615"],[0,"The Grammar of English Grammars (#14)"],[1," have in some way or other departed from it, even while they were  pretending to record its dictates. But it is not to be concealed, that in  every living language, it is a matter of much inherent difficulty, to reach  the standard of propriety, where usage is various; and to ascertain with  clearness the decisions of custom, when we descend to minute details. Here  is a field in which whatsoever is achieved by the pioneers of literature,  can be appreciated only by thorough scholars; for the progress of  improvement in any art or science, can be known only to those who can  clearly compare its ruder with its more refined stages; and it often  happens that what is effected with much labour, may be presented in a very  small compass.    5. But the knowledge of grammar may _retrograde_; for whatever loses the  vital principle of renovation and growth, tends to decay. And if mere  copyists, compilers, abridgers, and modifiers, be encouraged as they now  are, it surely will not advance. Style is liable to be antiquated by time,  corrupted by innovation, debased by ignorance, perverted by conceit,  impaired by negligence, and vitiated by caprice. And nothing but the living  spirit of true authorship, and the application of just criticism, can  counteract the natural tendency of these causes. English grammar is still  in its infancy; and even bears, to the imagination of some, the appearance  of a deformed and ugly dwarf among the liberal arts. Treatises are  multiplied almost innumerably, but still the old errors survive. Names are  rapidly added to our list of authors, while little or nothing is done for  the science. Nay, while new blunders have been committed in every new book,  old ones have been allowed to stand as by prescriptive right;. and  positions that were never true, and sentences that were never good English,  have been published and republished under different names, till in our  language grammar has become the most ungrammatical of all studies!  \"Imitators generally copy their originals in an inverse ratio of their  merits; that is, by adding as much to their faults, as they lose of their  merits.\"--KNIGHT, _on the Greek Alphabet_, p. 117.       \"Who to the life an exact piece would make,      Must not from others' work a copy take.\"--_Cowley_.    6. All science is laid in the nature of things; and he only who seeks it  there, can rightly guide others in the paths of knowledge. He alone can  know whether his predecessors went right or wrong, who is capable of a  judgement independent of theirs. But with what shameful servility have many  false or faulty definitions and rules been copied and copied from one  grammar to another, as if authority had canonized their errors, or none had  eyes to see them! Whatsoever is dignified and fair, is also modest and  reasonable; but modesty does not consist in having no opinion of one's own,  nor reason in following with blind partiality the footsteps of others.  Grammar unsupported by authority, is indeed mere fiction. But what apology  is this, for that authorship which has produced so many grammars without  originality? Shall he who cannot write for himself, improve upon him who  can? Shall he who cannot paint, retouch the canvass of Guido? Shall modest  ingenuity be allowed only to imitators and to thieves? How many a prefatory  argument issues virtually in this! It is not deference to merit, but  impudent pretence, practising on the credulity of ignorance! Commonness  alone exempts it from scrutiny, and the success it has, is but the wages of  its own worthlessness! To read and be informed, is to make a proper use of  books for the advancement of learning; but to assume to be an author by  editing mere commonplaces and stolen criticisms, is equally beneath the  ambition of a scholar and the honesty of a man.       \"'T is true, the ancients we may rob with ease;      But who with that mean shift himself can please?\"              _Sheffield, Duke of Buckingham_.    7. Grammar being a practical art, with the principles of which every  intelligent person is more or less acquainted, it might be expected that a  book written professedly on the subject, should exhibit some evidence of  its author's skill. But it would seem that a multitude of bad or  indifferent writers have judged themselves qualified to teach the art of  speaking and writing well; so that correctness of language and neatness of  style are as rarely to be found in grammars as in other books. Nay, I have  before suggested that in no other science are the principles of good  writing so frequently and so shamefully violated. The code of false grammar  embraced in the following work, will go far to sustain this opinion. There  have been, however, several excellent scholars, who have thought it an  object not unworthy of their talents, to prescribe and elucidate the  principles of English Grammar. But these, with scarcely any exception, have  executed their inadequate designs, not as men engaged in their proper  calling, but as mere literary almoners, descending for a day from their  loftier purposes, to perform a service, needful indeed, and therefore  approved, but very far from supplying all the aid that is requisite to a  thorough knowledge of the subject. Even the most meritorious have left  ample room for improvement, though some have evinced an ability which does  honour to themselves, while it gives cause to regret their lack of an  inducement to greater labour. The mere grammarian can neither aspire to  praise, nor stipulate for a reward; and to those who were best qualified to  write, the subject could offer no adequate motive for diligence.    8. Unlearned men, who neither make, nor can make, any pretensions to a  knowledge of grammar as a study, if they show themselves modest in what  they profess, are by no means to be despised or undervalued for the want of  such knowledge. They are subject to no criticism, till they turn authors  and write for the public. And even then they are to be treated gently, if  they have any thing to communicate, which is worthy to be accepted in a  homely dress. Grammatical inaccuracies are to be kindly excused, in all  those from whom nothing better can be expected; for people are often under  a necessity of appearing as speakers or writers, before they can have  learned to write or speak grammatically. The body is more to be regarded  than raiment; and the substance of an interesting message, may make the  manner of it a little thing. Men of high purposes naturally spurn all that  is comparatively low; or all that may seem nice, overwrought, ostentatious,  or finical. Hence St. Paul, in writing to the Corinthians, suggests that  the design of his preaching might have been defeated, had he affected the  orator, and turned his attention to mere \"excellency of speech,\" or \"wisdom  of words.\" But this view of things presents no more ground for neglecting  grammar, and making coarse and vulgar example our model of speech, than for  neglecting dress, and making baize and rags the fashionable costume. The  same apostle exhorts Timothy to \"hold fast the form of sound _words_,\"  which he himself had taught him. Nor can it be denied that there is an  obligation resting upon all men, to use speech fairly and understandingly.  But let it be remembered, that all those upon whose opinions or practices I  am disposed to animadvert, are either professed grammarians and  philosophers, or authors who, by extraordinary pretensions, have laid  themselves under special obligations to be accurate in the use of language.  \"The _wise in heart_ shall be called prudent; and _the sweetness of the  lips_ increaseth learning.\"--_Prov._, xvi, 21. \"The words of a man's mouth  are as deep waters, and the well-spring of wisdom [is] as a flowing  brook.\"--_Ib._, xviii, 4. \"A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips  are the snare of his soul.\"--_Ib._, xviii, 7.    9. The old maxim recorded by Bacon, \"_Loquendum ut vulgus, sentiendum ut  sapientes_,\"--\"We should speak as the vulgar, but think as the wise,\" is  not to be taken without some limitation. For whoever literally speaks as  the vulgar, shall offend vastly too much with his tongue, to have either  the understanding of the wise or the purity of the good. In all untrained  and vulgar minds, the ambition of speaking well is but a dormant or very  weak principle. Hence the great mass of uneducated people are lamentably  careless of what they utter, both as to the matter and the manner; and no  few seem naturally prone to the constant imitation of low example, and  some, to the practice of every abuse of which language is susceptible.  Hence, as every scholar knows, the least scrupulous of our lexicographers  notice many terms but to censure them as \"_low_,\" and omit many more as  being beneath their notice. Vulgarity of language, then, ever has been, and  ever must be, repudiated by grammarians. Yet we have had pretenders to  grammar, who could court the favour of the vulgar, though at the expense of  all the daughters of Mnemosyne.    10. Hence the enormous insult to learning and the learned, conveyed in the  following scornful quotations: \"Grammarians, go to your _tailors_ and  _shoemakers_, and learn from them the _rational_ art of constructing your  grammars!\"--_Neef's Method of Education_, p. 62. \"From a labyrinth without  a clew, in which the _most enlightened scholars_ of Europe have mazed  themselves and misguided others, the author ventures to turn  aside.\"--_Cardell's Gram._, 12mo, p. 15. Again: \"The _nations_ of  _unlettered men_ so adapted their language to philosophic truth, that all  physical and intellectual research can find no essential rule to reject or  change.\"--_Ibid._, p. 91. I have shown that \"the nations of unlettered men\"  are among that portion of the earth's population, upon whose language the  genius of grammar has never yet condescended to look down!

I bet you were often kissed when that youngster's age.  I bet my boots now that you can't count the times you did the same thing  yourself. Now, confess.\"    Grannie's face melted in a smile as she commenced a little anecdote,  with that pathetic beginning, \"When I was young.\"    Aunt Helen sent me inside lest I should catch cold, and I stationed  myself immediately inside the window so that I should not miss the  conversation. \"I should think your niece is very excitable,\" Mr Grey was  saying to aunt Helen.    \"Oh, very.\"    \"Yes; I have never seen any but very highly strung temperaments have  that transparent brilliance of expression.\"    \"She is very variable--one moment all joy, and the next the reverse.\"    \"She has a very striking face. I don't know what it is that makes it  so.\"    \"It may be her complexion,\" said aunt Helen; \"her skin is whiter than  the fairest blonde, and her eyebrows and lashes very dark. Be very  careful you do not say anything that would let her know you think her  not nice looking. She broods over her appearance in such a morbid  manner. It is a weak point with her, so be careful not to sting her  sensitiveness in that respect.\"    \"Plain-looking! Why, I think she has one of the most fascinating faces  I've seen for some time, and her eyes are simply magnificent. What  colour are they?\"    \"The grass is not bad about Sydney. I think I will send a truck of fat  wethers away next week,\" said uncle Jay-Jay to grannie.    \"It is getting quite dark. Let's get in to dinner at once,\" said  grannie.    During the meal I took an opportunity of studying the appearance of  Everard Grey. He had a typically aristocratic English face, even to the  cold rather heartless expression, which is as established a point of an  English blue blood as an arched neck is of a thoroughbred horse.    A ringer, whose wife had been unexpectedly confined, came for grannie  when dinner was over, and the rest of us had a delightful musical  evening. Uncle Jay-Jay bawled \"The Vicar of Bray\" and \"Drink, Puppy,  Drink\" in a stentorian bass voice, holding me on his knee, pinching,  tickling, pulling my hair, and shaking me up and down between whiles. Mr  Hawden favoured us by rendering \"The Holy City\". Everard Grey sang  several new songs, which was a great treat, as he had a well-trained and  musical baritone voice. He was a veritable carpet knight, and though not  a fop, was exquisitely dressed in full evening costume, and showed his  long pedigreed blood in every line of his clean-shaven face and tall  slight figure. He was quite a champion on the piano, and played aunt  Helen's accompaniments while he made her sing song after song. When she  was weary uncle Jay-Jay said to me, \"Now it's your turn, me fine lady.  We've all done something to keep things rolling but you. Can you sing?\"    \"No,\"    \"Can this youngster sing, Helen?\"    \"She sings very nicely to herself sometimes, but I do not know how she  would manage before company. Will you try something, Sybylla?\"    Uncle Jay-Jay waited to hear no more, but carrying me to the  music-stool, and depositing me thereon, warned me not to attempt to  leave it before singing something.    To get away to myself, where I was sure no one could bear me, and sing  and sing till I made the echoes ring, was one of the chief joys of my  existence, but I had never made a success in singing to company. Besides  losing all nerve, I had a very queer voice, which every one remarked.  However, tonight I made an effort in my old favourite, \"Three Fishers  Went Sailing\". The beauty of the full-toned Ronisch piano, and Everard's  clever and sympathetic accompanying, caused me to forget my audience,  and sing as though to myself alone, forgetting that my voice was odd.    When the song ceased Mr Grey wheeled abruptly on the stool and said, \"Do  you know that you have one of the most wonderful natural voices I have  heard. Why, there is a fortune in such a voice if it were, trained! Such  chest-notes, such feeling, such rarity of tone!\"    \"Don't be sarcastic, Mr Grey,\" I said shortly.    \"Upon my word as a man, I mean every word I say,\" he returned  enthusiastically.    Everard Grey's opinion on artistic matters was considered worth having.  He dabbled in all the arts--writing, music, acting, and sketching, and  went to every good concert and play in Sydney. Though he was clever at  law, it was whispered by some that he would wind up on the stage, as he  had a great leaning that way.    I walked away from the piano treading on air. Would I really make a  singer? I with the voice which had often been ridiculed; I who had often  blasphemously said that I would sell my soul to be able to sing just  passably. Everard Grey's opinion gave me an intoxicated sensation of  joy.    \"Can you recite?\" he inquired.    \"Yes,\" I answered firmly.    \"Give us something,\" said uncle Jay-Jay.    I recited Longfellow's \"The Slave's Dream\". Everard Grey was quite as  enthusiastic over this as he had been about my singing.    \"Such a voice! Such depth and width! Why, she could fill the Centennial  Hall without an effort. All she requires is training.\"    \"By George, she's a regular dab! But I wish she would give us something  not quite so glum,\" said uncle Jay-Jay.    I let myself go. Carried away by I don't know what sort of a spirit, I  exclaimed, \"Very well, I will, if you will wait till I make up, and will  help me.\"    I disappeared for a few minutes, and returned made up as a fat old Irish  woman, with a smudge of dirt on my face. There was a general laugh.    Would Mr Hawden assist me? Of course he was only too delighted, and  flattered that I had called upon him in preference to the others. What  would he do?    I sat him on a footstool, so that I might with facility put my hand on  his sandy hair, and turning to uncle, commenced:    \"Shure, sir, seeing it was a good bhoy yez were afther to run errants,  it's meself that has brought this youngsther for yer inspection. It's a  jool ye'll have in him. Shure I rared him meself, and he says his  prayers every morning. Kape sthill, honey! Faith, ye're not afraid of  yer poor old mammy pullin' yer beautiful cur-r-rls?\"    Uncle Jay-Jay was laughing like fun; even aunt Helen deigned to smile;  and Everard was looking on with critical interest.    \"Go on,\" said uncle. But Mr Hawden got huffy at the ridicule which he  suspected I was calling down upon him, and jumped up looking fit to eat  me.    I acted several more impromptu scenes with the other occupants of the  drawing-room. Mr Hawden emitted \"Humph!\" from the corner where he  grumpily sat, but Mr Grey was full of praise.    \"Splendid! splendid!\" he exclaimed. \"You say you have not had an hour's  training, and never saw a play. Such versatility. Your fortune would be  made on the stage. It is a sin to have such exceptional talent wasting  in the bush. I must take her to Sydney and put her under a good master.\"    \"Indeed, you'll do no such thing,\" said uncle. \"I'll keep her here to  liven up the old barracks. You've got enough puppets on the stage  without a niece of mine ever being there.\"    I went to bed that night greatly elated. Flattery is sweet to youth. I  felt pleased with myself, and imagined, as I peeped in the  looking-glass, that I was not half bad-looking after all.          CHAPTER ELEVEN    Yah!      \"Bah, you hideous animal! Ha ha! Your peerless conceit does you credit.  So you actually imagined that by one or two out of every hundred you  might be considered passable. You are the most uninteresting person in  the world. You are small and nasty and bad, and every other thing that's  abominable. That's what you are.\"    This address I delivered to my reflection in the glass next morning. My  elation of the previous night was as flat as a pancake. Dear, oh dear,  what a fool I had been to softly swallow the flattery of Mr Grey without  a single snub in return! To make up for my laxity, if he continued to  amuse himself by plastering my vanity with the ointment of flattery, I  determined to serve up my replies to him red-hot and well seasoned with  pepper.    I finished my toilet, and in a very what's-the-good-o'-anything mood  took a last glance in the glass to say, \"You're ugly, you're ugly and  useless; so don't forget that and make a fool of yourself again.\"    I was in the habit of doing this; it had long ago taken the place of a  morning prayer. I said this, that by familiarity it might lose a little  of its sting when I heard it from other lips, but somehow it failed in  efficacy.    I was late for breakfast that morning. All the others were half through  the meal when I sat down.    Grannie had not come home till after twelve, but was looking as brisk as  usual.    \"Come, Sybylla, I suppose this comes of sitting up too late, as I was  not here to hunt you to bed. You are always very lively at night, but  it's a different tune in the morning,\" she said, when giving me the  usual morning hug.    \"When I was a nipper of your age, if I didn't turn out like greased  lightning every morning, I was assisted by a little strap oil,\" remarked  uncle Jay-Jay.    \"Sybylla should be excused this morning,\" interposed Mr Grey. \"She  entertained us for hours last night. Little wonder if she feels languid  this morning.\"    \"Entertained you I What did she do?\" queried grannie.    \"Many things. Do you know, gran, that you are robbing the world of an  artist by keeping Sybylla hidden away in the bush? I must persuade you  to let me take her to Sydney and have her put under the best masters in  Sydney.\"    \"Under masters for what?\"    \"Elocution and singing.\"    \"I couldn't afford it.\"    \"But I'd bear the expense myself. It would only be returning a trifle of  all you have done for me.\"    \"What nonsense! What would you have her do when she was taught?\"    \"Go on the stage, of course. With her talent and hair she would "]]]
