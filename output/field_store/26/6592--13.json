I was married when I was 21 to Henry  Miller and lived with him 51 years and ten months; he died from old age  and hard work. We had two chillun, both girls. One of them lives here  with me in that other room. Mamma said the Yankees told the Negroes when  they got em freed they'd give em a mule and a farm or maybe a part of  the plantation they'd been working on for their white folks. She thought  they just told em that to make them dissatisfied and to get more of them  'to join up with em' and they were dressed in pretty blue clothes and  had nice horses and that made lots of the Negro men go with them. None  of em ever got anything but what their white folks give em, and just  lots and lots of em never come back after the war cause the Yankees put  them in front where the shooting was and they was killed. My husband  Henry Miller died four years ago. He followed public work and made  plenty of money but he had lots of friends and his money went easy too.

My parents was  Marther and Burl Miller.    \"They told me their owners come here from North Carolina in 1820. They  owned lots of slaves and lots of land. Mother was medium light--about my  color. See, I'm mixed. My hair is white. I heard mother say she never  worked in the field. Father was a blacksmith on the place. He wasn't a  slave. His grandfather willed him free at ten years of age. It was tried  in the Supreme Court. They set him free. Said they couldn't break the  dead man's will.    \"My father was a real bright colored man. It caused some disturbance.  Father went back and forth to Kansas. They tried to make him leave if he  was a free man. They said I would have to be a slave several years or  leave the State. Freedom settled that for me.    \"My great grandmother on my mother's side belong to Thomas Jefferson. He  was good to her. She used to tell me stories on her lap. She come from  Virginia to Tennessee. They all cried to go back to Virginia and their  master got mad and sold them. He was a meaner man. Her name was Sarah  Jefferson. Mariah was her daughter and Marther was my mother. They was  real dark folks but mother was my color, or a shade darker.    \"Grandmother said she picked cotton from the seed all day till her  fingers nearly bled. That was fore gin day.

My memory ain't so good about things when I was little, away  back yonder, but I sure members dem Ku Klux Klans and de militia. They  used to ketch people and take em out and whup em.    \"Don't rickolleck any of de old songs but one or two--oh, yes, dey used  to sing 'Old time religion's good enough for me' and songs like dat.    \"De young people! Lawzy, I jest dunno how to take em. Can't understand  em at all. Dey too much for me!\"      NOTE: The old fellow chuckled and shook his head but said very little  more. He could have told much but for his faulty memory, no doubt. He  was almost non-committal as to facts of slavery days, the War between  the States, and Reconstruction period. Has the sense of humor that seems  to be a characteristic of most of the old-time Negroes, but aside from a  whimsical chuckle shows little of the interest that is usually  associated with the old generation of Negroes.          Interviewer: Miss Irene Robertson  Person interviewed: W.D. Miller, West Memphis, Arkansas  Age: 65?      \"Grandpa was sold twice in Raleigh, North Carolina. He was sold twice to  the same people, from the Millers to the Robertsons (Robersons,  Robinsons, etc.?). He said the Robertsons were not so very good to him  but the Millers were. Grandma was washing when a Yank come and told them  they had been sot free. They quit washing and went from house to house  rejoicing. My parents' names was Jesse and Mary Miller, and Grandma  Agnes and Grandpa Peter Miller. The Robertsons was hill wheat farmers.  The Millers had a cloth factory. Dan Miller owned it and he raised  wheat. Mama was a puny woman and they worked her in the factory. She  made cloth and yarn.    \"I was born in Raleigh, North Carolina or close by there. My father's  uncle John House brought about one hundred families from North Carolina  to Quittenden County, Mississippi. I was seven years old. He said they  rode mules to pick cotton, it growed up like trees. We come in car  boxes. I came to Heath and Helena eleven years ago.

Interviewer: Miss Irene Robertson  Person interviewed: Gip Minton, Des Arc, Arkansas  Age: 84      \"I was born at Jackson, Alabama on the Tennessee River. It was sho a  putty river. I never did know my grandfolks. I think my father was a  soldier. My master was a soldier, I think. He was in de war. I do  remember the Civil War. I remember the last battle at Scottsboro. There  was several but one big battle and they got to Belfontain. That is where  it seemed they were trying to go. I don't recollect who won the battle.  I heard them fighting and saw the smoke and after they went on saw the  bodies dead and all that was left was like a cyclone had swept by. There  was a big regiment stationed at Scottsboro. It was just like any war  fought with guns and they lived in tents. They took everything they  could find. Looked like starvation was upon de land.    \"I had two sisters and one brother and my mother died when I was a baby.  I come out here to Arkansas with my mothers old master and mistress and  never did see nor hear of none of them. No I never did hear from none of  them.

Useless now  my bravery, for here I must stay and die. The widows will still mourn; and  in their old age who will take care of my father and my mother? Pity me  now, oh Sun! Help me, oh great Above Medicine Person! Look down on your  wounded and suffering child. Help me to survive!\"    What was that crackling in the brush near by? Was it the Snakes on his  trail? Mik-a'pi strung his bow and drew out his arrows. No; it was not a  Snake. It was a bear. There he stood, a big grizzly bear, looking down at  the wounded man. \"What does my brother here?\" he said. \"Why does he pray  to survive?\"    \"Look at my leg,\" said Mik-a'pi, \"swollen and sore. Look at my wounded  arm. I can hardly draw the bow. Far the home of my people, and my strength  is gone. Surely here I must die, for I cannot travel and I have no food.\"    \"Now courage, my brother,\" said the bear. \"Now not faint heart, my brother,  for I will help you, and you shall survive.\"    When he had said this, he lifted Mik-a'pi and carried him to a place of  thick mud; and here he took great handfuls[1] of the mud and plastered the  wounds, and he sung a medicine song while putting on the mud. Then he  carried Mik-a'pi to a place where were many sarvis berries, and broke off  great branches of the fruit, and gave them to him, saying, \"Eat, my  brother, eat!\" and he broke off more branches, full of large ripe berries,  for him; but already Mik-a'pi was satisfied and could eat no more. Then  said the bear, \"Lie down, now, on my back, and hold tight by my hair, and  we will travel on.\" And when Mik-a'pi had got on and was ready, he started  off on a long swinging trot.    [Footnote 1: The bear's paws are called _O-kits-iks,_ the term also for a  person's hands. The animal itself is regarded as almost human.]    All through the night he travelled on without stopping. When morning came,  they rested awhile, and ate more berries; and again the bear plastered his  wounds with mud. In this way they travelled on, until, on the fourth day,  they came close to the lodges of the Pik[)u]n'i; and the people saw them  coming and wondered.    \"Get off, my brother, get off,\" said the bear. \"There are your people. I  must leave you.\" And without another word, he turned and went off up the  mountain.    All the people came out to meet the warrior, and they carried him to the  lodge of his father. He untied the three scalps from his belt and gave them  to the widows, saying: \"You are revenged. I wipe away your tears.\" And  every one rejoiced. All his female relations went through the camp,  shouting his name and singing, and every one prepared for the scalp dance.    First came the widows. Their faces were painted black, and they carried the  scalps tied on poles. Then came the medicine men, with their medicine pipes  unwrapped; then the bands of the _I-kun-uh'-kah-tsi_, all dressed in war  costume; then came the old men; and last the women and children. They all  sang the war song and danced. They went all through the village in single  file, stopping here and there to dance, and Mik-a'pi sat outside the lodge,  and saw all the people dance by him. He forgot his pain and was proud, and  although he could not dance, he sang with them.    Soon they made the Medicine Lodge, and, first of all the warriors, Mik-a'pi  was chosen to cut the raw-hide which binds the poles, and as he cut the  strands, he counted the _coups_ he had made. He told of the enemies he had  killed, and all the people shouted his name and praised him. The father of  those two young sisters gave them to him. He was glad to have such a  son-in-law. Long lived Mik-a'pi. Of all the great chiefs who have lived and  died, he was the greatest. He did many other great and daring things. It  must be true, as the old men have said, that he was helped by the ghosts,  for no one can do such things without help from those fearful and unknown  persons.        HEAVY COLLAR AND THE GHOST WOMAN      The Blood camp was on Old Man's River, where Fort McLeod now stands. A  party of seven men started to war toward the Cypress Hills. Heavy Collar  was the leader. They went around the Cypress Mountains, but found no  enemies and started back toward their camp. On their homeward way, Heavy  Collar used to take the lead. He would go out far ahead on the high hills,  and look over the country, acting as scout for the party. At length they  came to the south branch of the Saskatchewan River, above Seven Persons'  Creek. In those days there were many war parties about, and this party  travelled concealed as much as possible in the coulees and low places.    As they were following up the river, they saw at a distance three old bulls  lying down close to a cut bank. Heavy Collar left his party, and went out  to kill one of these bulls, and when he had come close to them, he shot one  and killed it right there. He cut it up, and, as he was hungry, he went  down into a ravine below him, to roast a piece of meat; for he had left his  party a long way behind, and night was now coming on. As he was roasting  the meat, he thought,--for he was very tired,--\"It is a pity I did not  bring one of my young men with me. He could go up on that hill and get some  hair from that bull's head, and I could wipe out my gun.\" While he sat  there thinking this, and talking to himself, a bunch of this hair came over  him through the air, and fell on the ground right in front of him. When  this happened, it frightened him a little; for he thought that perhaps some  of his enemies were close by, and had thrown the bunch of hair at  him. After a little while, he took the hair, and cleaned his gun and loaded  it, and then sat and watched for a time. He was uneasy, and at length  decided that he would go on further up the river, to see what he could  discover. He went on, up the stream, until he came to the mouth of the  St. Mary's River. It was now very late in the night, and he was very tired,  so he crept into a large bunch of rye-grass to hide and sleep for the  night.    The summer before this, the Blackfeet _(Sik-si-kau)_ had been camped on  this bottom, and a woman had been killed in this same patch of rye-grass  where Heavy Collar had lain down to rest. He did not know this, but still  he seemed to be troubled that night. He could not sleep. He could always  hear something, but what it was he could not make out. He tried to go to  sleep, but as soon as he dozed off he kept thinking he heard something in  the distance. He spent the night there, and in the morning when it became  light, there he saw right beside him the skeleton of the woman who had been  killed the summer before.    That morning he went on, following up the stream to Belly River. All day  long as he was travelling, he kept thinking about his having slept by this  woman's bones. It troubled him. He could not forget it. At the same time he  was very tired, because he had walked so far and had slept so little. As  night came on, he crossed over to an island, and determined to camp for the  night. At the upper end of the island was a large tree that had drifted  down and lodged, and in a fork of this tree he built his fire, and got in a  crotch of one of the forks, and sat with his back to the fire, warming  himself, but all the time he was thinking about the woman he had slept  beside the night before. As he sat there, all at once he heard over beyond  the tree, on the other side of the fire, a sound as if something were being  dragged toward him along the ground. It sounded as if a piece of a lodge  were being dragged over the grass. It came closer and closer.    Heavy Collar was scared. He was afraid to turn his head and look back to  see what it was that was coming. He heard the noise come up to the tree in  which his fire was built, and then it stopped, and all at once he heard  some one whistling a tune. He turned around and looked toward the sound,  and there, sitting on the other fork of the tree, right opposite to him,  was the pile of bones by which he had slept, only now all together in the  shape of a skeleton. This ghost had on it a lodge covering. The string,  which is tied to the pole, was fastened about the ghost's neck; the wings  of the lodge stood out on either side of its head, and behind it the lodge  could be seen, stretched out and fading away into the darkness. The ghost  sat on the old dead limb and whistled its tune, and as it whistled, it  swung its legs in time to the tune.    When Heavy Collar saw this, his heart almost melted away. At length he  mustered up courage, and said: \"Oh ghost, go away, and do not trouble me. I  am very tired; I want to rest.\" The ghost paid no attention to him, but  kept on whistling, swinging its legs in time to the tune. Four times he  prayed to her, saying: \"Oh ghost, take pity on me! Go away and leave me  alone. I am tired; I want to rest.\" The more he prayed, the more the ghost  whistled and seemed pleased, swinging her legs, and turning her head from  side to side, sometimes looking down at him, and sometimes up at the stars,  and all the time whistling.    When he saw that she took no notice of what he said, Heavy Collar got angry  at heart, and said, \"Well, ghost, you do not listen to my prayers, and I  shall have to shoot you to drive you away.\" With that he seized his gun,  and throwing it to his shoulder, shot right at the ghost. When he shot at  her, she fell over backward into the darkness, screaming out: \"Oh Heavy  Collar, you have shot me, you have killed me! You dog, Heavy Collar! there  is no place on this earth where you can go that I will not find you; no  place where you can hide that I will not come.\"    As she fell back and said this, Heavy Collar sprang to his feet, and ran  away as fast as"]]]
