Charlotte and the Captain observed this, and exchanged many a quiet  smile at it; but they were both taken by surprise at another symptom, in  which Ottilie's latent feeling accidentally displayed itself.    One evening, which had been partly spoilt for them by a tedious visit,  Edward proposed that they should not separate so early--he felt inclined  for music--he would take his flute, which he had not done for many days  past. Charlotte looked for the sonatas which they generally played  together, and they were not to be found. Ottilie, with some hesitation,  said that they were in her room--she had taken them there to copy them.    \"And you can, you will, accompany me on the piano?\" cried Edward, his  eyes sparkling with pleasure. \"I think perhaps I can,\" Ottilie answered.  She brought the music and sat down to the instrument. The others  listened, and were sufficiently surprised to hear how perfectly Ottilie  had taught herself the piece--but far more surprised were they at the  way in which she contrived to adapt herself to Edward's style of  playing. Adapt herself, is not the right expression--Charlotte's skill  and power enabled her, in order to please her husband, to keep up with  him when he went too fast, and hold in for him if he hesitated; but  Ottilie, who had several times heard them play the sonata together,  seemed to have learnt it according to the idea in which they accompanied  each other--she had so completely made his defects her own, that a kind  of living whole resulted from it, which did not move indeed according to  exact rule, but the effect of which was in the highest degree pleasant  and delightful. The composer himself would have been pleased to hear his  work disfigured in a manner so charming.    Charlotte and the Captain watched this strange unexpected occurrence in  silence, with the kind of feeling with which we often observe the  actions of children--unable exactly to approve of them, from the serious  consequences which may follow, and yet without being able to find fault,  perhaps with a kind of envy. For, indeed, the regard of these two for  one another was growing also, as well as that of the others--and it was  perhaps only the more perilous because they were both stronger, more  certain of themselves, and better able to restrain themselves.    The Captain had already begun to feel that a habit which he could not  resist was threatening to bind him to Charlotte. He forced himself to  stay away at the hour when she commonly used to be at the works; by  getting up very early in the morning he contrived to finish there  whatever he had to do, and went back to the castle to his work in his  own room. The first day or two Charlotte thought it was an accident--she  looked for him in every place where she thought he could possibly be.  Then she thought she understood him--and admired him all the more.    Avoiding, as the Captain now did, being alone with Charlotte, the more  industriously did he labor to hurry forward the preparations for keeping  her rapidly-approaching birthday with all splendor. While he was  bringing up the new road from below behind the village, he made the men,  under pretence that he wanted stones, begin working at the top as well,  and work down, to meet the others; and he had calculated his  arrangements so that the two should exactly meet on the eve of the day.  The excavations for the new house were already done; the rock was blown  away with gunpowder; and a fair foundation-stone had been hewn, with a  hollow chamber, and a flat slab adjusted to cover it.    This outward activity, these little mysterious purposes of friendship,  prompted by feelings which more or less they were obliged to repress,  rather prevented the little party when together from being as lively as  usual. Edward, who felt that there was a sort of void, one evening  called upon the Captain to fetch his violin--Charlotte should play the  piano, and he should accompany her. The Captain was unable to refuse the  general request, and they executed together one of the most difficult  pieces of music with an ease, and freedom, and feeling, which could not  but afford themselves, and the two who were listening to them, the  greatest delight. They promised themselves a frequent repetition of it,  as well as further practice together. \"They do it better than we,  Ottilie,\" said Edward; \"we will admire them--but we can enjoy ourselves  together too.\"          CHAPTER IX      The birthday was come, and everything was ready. The wall was all  complete which protected the raised village road against the water, and  so was the walk; passing the church, for a short time it followed the  path which had been laid out by Charlotte, and then winding upward among  the rocks, inclined first under the summer-house to the right, and then,  after a wide sweep, passed back above it to the right again, and so by  degrees out on to the summit. A large party had assembled for the  occasion. They went first to church, where they found the whole  congregation assembled in their holiday dresses. After service, they  filed out in order; first the boys, then the young men, then the old;  after them came the party from the castle, with their visitors and  retinue; and the village maidens, young girls, and women, brought up the  rear.    At the turn of the walk, a raised stone seat had been contrived, where  the Captain made Charlotte and the visitors stop and rest. From here  they could see over the whole distance from the beginning to the  end--the troops of men who had gone up before them, the file of women  following, and now drawing up to where they were. It was lovely weather,  and the whole effect was singularly beautiful. Charlotte was taken by  surprise, she was touched, and she pressed the Captain's hand warmly.    They followed the crowd who had slowly ascended, and were now forming a  circle round the spot where the future house was to stand. The lord of  the castle, his family, and the principal strangers were now invited to  descend into the vault, where the foundation-stone, supported on one  side, lay ready to be let down. A well-dressed mason, a trowel in one  hand and a hammer in the other, came forward, and with much grace spoke  an address in verse, of which in prose we can give but an imperfect  rendering.    \"Three things,\" he began, \"are to be looked to in a building--that it  stand on the right spot; that it be securely founded; that it be  successfully executed. The first is the business of the master of the  house--his and his only. As in the city the prince and the council alone  determine where a building shall be, so in the country it is the right  of the lord of the soil that he shall say, 'Here my dwelling shall  stand; here, and nowhere else.'\"    Edward and Ottilie were standing opposite one another, as these words  were spoken; but they did not venture to look up and exchange glances.    \"To the third, the execution, there is neither art nor handicraft which  must not in some way contribute. But the second, the founding, is the  province of the mason; and, boldly to speak it out, it is the head and  front of all the undertaking--a solemn thing it is--and our bidding you  descend hither is full of meaning. You are celebrating your Festival in  the deep of the earth. Here within this small hollow spot, you show us  the honor of appearing as witnesses of our mysterious craft. Presently  we shall lower down this carefully-hewn stone into its place; and soon  these earth-walls, now ornamented with fair and worthy persons, will be  no more accessible--but will be closed in forever!    \"This foundation-stone, which with its angles typifies the just angles  of the building, with the sharpness of its molding, the regularity of  it, and with the truth of its lines to the horizontal and perpendicular,  the uprightness and equal height of all the walls, we might now without  more ado let down--it would rest in its place with its own weight. But  even here there shall not fail of lime and means to bind it. For as  human beings who may be well inclined to each other by nature, yet hold  more firmly together when the law cements them, so are stones also,  whose forms may already fit together, united far better by these binding  forces. It is not seemly to be idle among the working, and here you will  not refuse to be our fellow-laborer;\" with these words he reached the  trowel to Charlotte, who threw mortar with it under the stone--several  of the others were then desired to do the same, and then it was at once  let fall. Upon which the hammer was placed next in Charlotte's, and then  in the others' hands, to strike three times with it, and conclude, in  this expression, the wedlock of the stone with the earth.    \"The work of the mason,\" went on the speaker, \"now under the free sky as  we are, if it be not done in concealment, yet must pass into  concealment--the soil will be laid smoothly in, and thrown over this  stone, and with the walls which we rear into the daylight we in the end  are seldom remembered. The works of the stone-cutter and the carver  remain under the eyes; but for us it is not to complain when the  plasterer blots out the last trace of our hands, and appropriates our  work to himself; when he overlays it, and smooths it, and colors it.    \"Not from regard for the opinion of others, but from respect for  himself, the mason will be faithful in his calling. There is none who  has more need to feel in himself the consciousness of what he is.

In any case, its cavalry gave the feudal state of Chao a military  advantage for a short time. Soon the other northern states copied it one  after another--especially Ch'in, in north-west China. The introduction  of cavalry brought a change in clothing all over China, for the former  long skirt-like garb could not be worn on horseback. Trousers and the  riding-cap were introduced from the north.    The new technique of war made it important for every state to possess as  many soldiers as possible, and where it could to reduce the enemy's  numbers. One result of this was that wars became much more sanguinary;  another was that men in other countries were induced to immigrate and  settle as peasants, so that the taxes they paid should provide the means  for further recruitment of soldiers. In the state of Ch'in, especially,  the practice soon started of using the whole of the peasantry  simultaneously as a rough soldiery. Hence that state was particularly  anxious to attract peasants in large numbers.    2 _Economic changes_    In the course of the wars much land of former noblemen had become free.  Often the former serfs had then silently become landowners. Others had  started to cultivate empty land in the area inhabited by the indigenous  population and regarded this land, which they themselves had made  fertile, as their private family property. There was, in spite of the  growth of the population, still much cultivable land available.  Victorious feudal lords induced farmers to come to their territory and  to cultivate the wasteland. This is a period of great migrations,  internal and external. It seems that from this period on not only  merchants but also farmers began to migrate southward into the area of  the present provinces of Kwangtung and Kwangsi and as far as Tonking.    As long as the idea that all land belonged to the great clans of the  Chou prevailed, sale of land was inconceivable; but when individual  family heads acquired land or cultivated new land, they regarded it as  their natural right to dispose of the land as they wished. From now on  until the end of the medieval period, the family head as representative  of the family could sell or buy land. However, the land belonged to the  family and not to him as a person. This development was favoured by the  spread of money. In time land in general became an asset with a market  value and could be bought and sold.    Another important change can be seen from this time on. Under the feudal  system of the Chou strict primogeniture among the nobility existed: the  fief went to the oldest son by the main wife. The younger sons were  given independent pieces of land with its inhabitants as new, secondary  fiefs. With the increase in population there was no more such land that  could be set up as a new fief. From now on, primogeniture was retained  in the field of ritual and religion down to the present time: only the  oldest son of the main wife represents the family in the ancestor  worship ceremonies; only the oldest son of the emperor could become his  successor. But the landed property from now on was equally divided among  all sons. Occasionally the oldest son was given some extra land to  enable him to pay the expenses for the family ancestral worship. Mobile  property, on the other side, was not so strictly regulated and often the  oldest son was given preferential treatment in the inheritance.    The technique of cultivation underwent some significant changes. The  animal-drawn plough seems to have been invented during this period, and  from now on, some metal agricultural implements like iron sickles and  iron plough-shares became more common. A fallow system was introduced so  that cultivation became more intensive. Manuring of fields was already  known in Shang time. It seems that the consumption of meat decreased  from this period on: less mutton and beef were eaten. Pig and dog  became the main sources of meat, and higher consumption of beans made  up for the loss of proteins. All this indicates a strong population  increase. We have no statistics for this period, but by 400 B.C. it is  conceivable that the population under the control of the various  individual states comprised something around twenty-five millions. The  eastern plains emerge more and more as centres of production.    The increased use of metal and the invention of coins greatly stimulated  trade. Iron which now became quite common, was produced mainly in  Shansi, other metals in South China. But what were the traders to do  with their profits? Even later in China, and almost down to recent  times, it was never possible to hoard large quantities of money.  Normally the money was of copper, and a considerable capital in the form  of copper coin took up a good deal of room and was not easy to conceal.  If anyone had much money, everyone in his village knew it. No one dared  to hoard to any extent for fear of attracting bandits and creating  lasting insecurity. On the other hand the merchants wanted to attain the  standard of living which the nobles, the landowners, used to have. Thus  they began to invest their money in land. This was all the easier for  them since it often happened that one of the lesser nobles or a peasant  fell deeply into debt to a merchant and found himself compelled to give  up his land in payment of the debt.    Soon the merchants took over another function. So long as there had been  many small feudal states, and the feudal lords had created lesser lords  with small fiefs, it had been a simple matter for the taxes to be  collected, in the form of grain, from the peasants through the agents of  the lesser lords. Now that there were only a few great states in  existence, the old system was no longer effectual. This gave the  merchants their opportunity. The rulers of the various states entrusted  the merchants with the collection of taxes, and this had great  advantages for the ruler: he could obtain part of the taxes at once, as  the merchant usually had grain in stock, or was himself a landowner and  could make advances at any time. Through having to pay the taxes to the  merchant, the village population became dependent on him. Thus the  merchants developed into the first administrative officials in the  provinces.    In connection with the growth of business, the cities kept on growing.  It is estimated that at the beginning of the third century, the city of  Lin-chin, near the present Chi-nan in Shantung, had a population of  210,000 persons. Each of its walls had a length of 4,000 metres; thus,  it was even somewhat larger than the famous city of Loyang, capital of  China during the Later Han dynasty, in the second century A.D. Several  other cities of this period have been recently excavated and must have  had populations far above 10,000 persons. There were two types of  cities: the rectangular, planned city of the Chou conquerors, a seat of  administration; and the irregularly shaped city which grew out of a  market place and became only later an administrative centre. We do not  know much about the organization and administration of these cities, but  they seem to have had considerable independence because some of them  issued their own city coins.    When these cities grew, the food produced in the neighbourhood of the  towns no longer sufficed for their inhabitants. This led to the building  of roads, which also facilitated the transport of supplies for great  armies. These roads mainly radiated from the centre of consumption into  the surrounding country, and they were less in use for communication  between one administrative centre and another. For long journeys the  rivers were of more importance, since transport by wagon was always  expensive owing to the shortage of draught animals. Thus we see in this  period the first important construction of canals and a development of  communications. With the canal construction was connected the  construction of irrigation and drainage systems, which further promoted  agricultural production. The cities were places in which often great  luxury developed; music, dance, and other refinements were cultivated;  but the cities also seem to have harboured considerable industries.  Expensive and technically superior silks were woven; painters decorated  the walls of temples and palaces; blacksmiths and bronze-smiths produced  beautiful vessels and implements. It seems certain that the art of  casting iron and the beginnings of the production of steel were already  known at this time. The life of the commoners in these cities was  regulated by laws; the first codes are mentioned in 536 B.C. By the end  of the fourth century B.C. a large body of criminal law existed,  supposedly collected by Li K'uei, which became the foundation of all  later Chinese law. It seems that in this period the states of China  moved quickly towards a money economy, and an observer to whom the later  Chinese history was not known could have predicted the eventual  development of a capitalistic society out of the apparent tendencies.    So far nothing has been said in these chapters about China's foreign  policy. Since the central ruling house was completely powerless, and the  feudal lords were virtually independent rulers, little can be said, of  course, about any \"Chinese\" foreign policy. There is less than ever to  be said about it for this period of the \"Contending States\". Chinese  merchants penetrated southward, and soon settlers moved in increasing  numbers into the plains of the south-east. In the north, there were  continual struggles with Turkish and Mongol tribes, and about 300 B.C.  the name of the Hsiung-nu (who are often described as \"The Huns of the  Far East\") makes its first"]]]
