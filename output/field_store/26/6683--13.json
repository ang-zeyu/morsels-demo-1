The natives of Torres Straits were carefully examined by Dr. C.S.      Myers with regard to their olfactory acuteness and olfactory      preferences. It was found that acuteness was, if anything,      slightly greater than among Europeans. This appeared to be      largely due to the careful attention they pay to odors. The      resemblances which they detected among different odorous      substances were frequently found to rest on real chemical      affinities. The odors they were observed to dislike most      frequently were asafoetida, valerianic acid, and civet, the last      being regarded as most repulsive of all on account of its      resemblance to faecal odor, which these people regard with intense      disgust. Their favorite odors were musk, thyme, and especially      violet. (_Report of the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to      Torres Straits_, vol. ii, Part II, 1903.)        In Australia Lumholtz (_Among Cannibals_, p. 115) found that the      blacks had a keener sense of smell than he possessed.        In New Zealand the Maoris, as W. Colenso shows, possessed,      formerly at all events, a very keen sense of smell or else were      very attentive to smell, and their taste as regarded agreeable      and disagreeable odors corresponded very closely to European      taste, although it must be added that some of their common      articles of food possessed a very offensive odor. They are not      only sensitive to European perfumes, but possessed various      perfumes of their own, derived from plants and possessing a      pleasant, powerful, and lasting odor; the choicest and rarest was      the gum of the _taramea_ (_Aciphylla Colensoi_), which was      gathered by virgins after the use of prayers and charms. Sir      Joseph Banks noted that Maori chiefs wore little bundles of      perfumes around their necks, and Cook made the same observation      concerning the young women. References to the four chief Maori      perfumes are contained in a stanza which is still often hummed to      express satisfaction, and sung by a mother to her  child:--            \"My little neck-satchel of sweet-scented moss,          My little neck-satchel of fragrant fern,          My little neck-satchel of odoriferous gum,          My sweet-smelling neck-locket of sharp-pointed _taramea_.\"        In the summer season the sleeping houses of Maori chiefs were      often strewed with a large, sweet-scented, flowering grass of      powerful odor. (W. Colenso, _Transactions of the New Zealand      Institute_, vol. xxiv, reprinted in _Nature_, November 10, 1892.)        Javanese women rub themselves with a mixture of chalk and strong      essence which, when rubbed off, leaves a distinct perfume on the      body. (Stratz, _Die Frauenkleidung_, p. 84.)        The Samoans, Friedlaender states (_Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie_,      1899, p. 52), are very fond of fragrant and aromatic odors. He      gives a list of some twenty odorous plants which they use, more      especially as garlands for the head and neck, including      ylang-ylang and gardenia; he remarks that of one of these plants      (cordyline) he could not himself detect the odor.        The Nicobarese, Man remarks (_Journal of the Anthropological      Institute_, 1889, p. 377), like the natives of New Zealand,      particularly dislike the smell of carbolic acid. Both young men      and women are very partial to scents; the former say they find      their use a certain passport to the favor of their wives, and      they bring home from the jungle the scented leaves of a certain      creeper to their sweethearts and wives.        Swahili women devote much attention to perfuming themselves. When      a woman wishes to make herself desirable she anoints herself all      over with fragrant ointments, sprinkles herself with rose-water,      puts perfume into her clothes, strews jasmine flowers on her bed      as well as binding them round her neck and waist, and smokes      _udi_, the perfumed wood of the aloe; \"every man is glad when his      wife smells of _udi_\" (Velten, _Sitten und Gebraueche der      Suaheli_, pp. 212-214).

During the eighteenth century a great impetus was given to the  physiological and psychological study of the senses by the philosophical  doctrines of Locke and the English school generally which then prevailed  in Europe. These thinkers had emphasized the immense importance of the  information derived through the senses in building up the intellect, so  that the study of all the sensory channels assumed a significance which it  had never possessed before. The olfactory sense fully shared in the  impetus thus given to sensory investigation. At the beginning of the  nineteenth century a distinguished French physician, Hippolyte Cloquet, a  disciple of Cabanis, devoted himself more especially to this subject.  After publishing in 1815 a preliminary work, he issued in 1821 his  _Osphresiologie, ou Traite des odeurs, du sens et des organes de  l'Olfaction_, a complete monograph on the anatomy, physiology, psychology,  and pathology of the olfactory organ and its functions, and a work that  may still be consulted with profit, if indeed it can even yet be said to  be at every point superseded. After Cloquet's time the study of the sense  of smell seems to have fallen into some degree of discredit. For more than  half a century no important progress was made in this field. Serious  investigators seemed to have become shy of the primitive senses generally,  and the subject of smell was mainly left to those interested in \"curious\"  subjects. Many interesting observations were, however, incidentally made;  thus Laycock, who was a pioneer in so many by-paths of psychology and  anthropology, showed a special interest in the olfactory sense, and  frequently touched on it in his _Nervous Diseases of Women_ and  elsewhere. The writer who more than any other has in recent years restored  the study of the sense of smell from a by-path to its proper position as a  highway for investigation is without doubt Professor Zwaardemaker, of  Utrecht. The invention of his first olfactometer in 1888 and the  appearance in 1895 of his great work _Die Physiologie des Geruchs_ have  served to give the physiology of the sense of smell an assured status and  to open the way anew for much fruitful investigation, while a number of  inquirers in many countries have had their attention directed to the  elucidation of this sense.    Notwithstanding, however, the amount of work which has been done in this  field during recent years, it cannot be said that the body of assured  conclusions so far reached is large. The most fundamental principles of  olfactory physiology and psychology are still somewhat vague and  uncertain. Although sensations of smell are numerous and varied, in this  respect approaching the sensations of vision and hearing, smell still  remains close to touch in the vagueness of its messages (while the most  sensitive of the senses, remarks Passy, it is the least precise), the  difficulty of classifying them, the impossibility of so controlling them  as to found upon them any art. It seems better, therefore, not to attempt  to force the present study of a special aspect of olfaction into any  general scheme which may possibly not be really valid.        The earliest and most general tendency in regard to the theory of      smell was to regard it as a kind of chemical sense directly      stimulated by minute particles of solid substance. A vibratory      theory of smell, however, making it somewhat analogous to      hearing, easily presents itself. When I first began the study of      physiology in 1881, a speculation of this kind presented itself      to my mind. Long before Philipp von Walther, a professor at      Landshut, had put forward a dynamic theory of olfaction      (_Physiologie des Menschen_, 1807-8, vol. ii, p. 278). \"It is a      purely dynamic operation of the odorous substance in the      olfactory organ,\" he stated. Odor is conveyed by the air, he      believed, in the same way as heat. It must be added that his      reasons for this theory will not always bear examination. More      recently a similar theory has been seriously put forward in      various quarters. Sir William Ramsay tentatively suggested such a      theory (_Nature_, vol. xxv, p. 187) in analogy with light and      sound. Haycraft (_Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh_,      1883-87, and _Brain_, 1887-88), largely starting from      Mendelieff's law of periodicity, similarly sought to bring smell      into line with the higher senses, arguing that molecules with the      same vibration have the same smell. Rutherford (_Nature_, August      11, 1892, p. 343), attaching importance to the evidence brought      forward by von Brunn showing that the olfactory cells terminate      in very delicate short hairs, also stated his belief that the      different qualities of smell result from differences in the      frequency and form of the vibrations initiated by the action of      the chemical molecules on these olfactory cells, though he      admitted that such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13614"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 5 (#14)"],[1,"seq.    [14] _Memoires_, vol. i, Chapter VII.    [15] Among leading English novelists Hardy shows an unusual but by no  means predominant interest in the feet and shoes of his heroines; see,  e.g., the observations of the cobbler in _Under the Greenwood Tree_,  Chapter III. A chapter in Goethe's _Wahlverwandtschaften_ (Part I, Chapter  II) contains an episode involving the charm of the foot and the kissing of  the beloved's shoe.    [16] Schinz, \"Philosophie des Conventions Sociales,\" _Revue  Philosophique_, June, 1903, p. 626. Mirabeau mentions in his _Erotika  Biblion_ that modern Greek women sometimes use their feet to provoke  orgasm in their lovers. I may add that simultaneous mutual masturbation by  means of the feet is not unknown to-day, and I have been told by an  English shoe-fetichist that he at one time was accustomed to practice this  with a married lady (Brazilian)--she with slippers on and he without--who  derived gratification equal to his own.    [17] Jacoby (loc. cit. pp. 796-7) gives a large number of references to  Ovid's works bearing on this point. \"In reading him,\" he remarks, \"one is  inclined to say that the psychology of the Romans was closely allied to  that of the Chinese.\"    [18] R. Kleinpaul, _Sprache ohne Worte_, p. 308. See also Moll, _Kontraere  Sexualempfindung_, third edition, pp. 306-308. Bloch brings together many  interesting references bearing on the ancient sexual and religious  symbolism of the shoe, _Beitraege zur AEtiologie der Psychopathia,  Sexualis_, Teil II, p. 324.    [19] Jacoby (loc. cit. p. 797) appears to regard shoe-fetichism as a true  atavism: \"The sexual adoration of feminine foot-gear,\" he concludes,  \"perhaps the most enigmatic and certainly the most singular of  degenerative insanities, is thus merely a form of atavism, the return of  the degenerate to the very ancient and primitive psychology which we no  longer understand and are no longer capable of feeling.\"    [20] Moll has reported in detail (_Untersuchungen ueber die Libido  Sexualis_, bd. i, Teil II, pp. 320-324) a case which both he and  Krafft-Ebing regard as illustrative of the connection between  boot-fetichism and masochism. It is essentially a case of masochism,  though manifesting itself almost exclusively in the desire to perform  humiliating acts in connection with the attractive person's boots.    [21] Krafft-Ebing goes so far as to assert (_Psychopathia Sexualis_,  English translation of tenth edition, p. 174) that \"when in cases of  shoe-fetichism the female shoe appears alone as the excitant of sexual  desire one is justified in presuming that masochistic motives have  remained latent.... Latent masochism may always be assumed as the  unconscious motive.\" In this way he hopelessly misinterprets some of his  own cases.    [22] Krafft-Ebing goes so far as to assert (_Psychopathia Sexualis_,  English translation, pp. 159 and 174). Yet some of the cases he brings  forward (e.g., Coxe's as quoted by Hammond) show no sign of masochism,  since, according to Krafft-Ebing's own definition (p. 116), the idea of  subjugation by the opposite sex is of the essence of masochism.    [23] Her actions suggest that there is often a latent sexual consciousness  in regard to the feet in women, atavistic or pseudo-atavistic, and  corresponding to the sexual attraction which the feet formerly aroused,  almost normally, in men. This is also suggested by the case, referred to  by Shufeldt, of an unmarried woman, belonging to a family exhibiting in a  high degree both erotic and neurotic traits, who had \"a certain  uncontrollable fascination for shoes. She delights in new shoes, and  changes her shoes all day long at regular intervals of three hours each.  She keeps this row of shoes out in plain sight in her apartment.\" (R.W.  Shufeldt, \"On a Case of Female Impotency,\" 1896, p. 10.)          III.

We meet with another group of erotic symbolisms--alike symbolisms of  object and of act--in connection with the two functions adjoining the  anatomical sexual focus: the urinary and alvine excretory functions. These  are sometimes termed the scatalogical group, with the two subdivisions of  urolagnia and Coprolagnia.[24] _Inter faeces et urinam nascimur_ is an  ancient text which has served the ascetic preachers of old for many  discourses on the littleness of man and the meanness of that reproductive  power which plays so large a part in man's life. \"The stupid bungle of  Nature,\" a correspondent writes, \"whereby the generative organs serve as a  means of relieving the bladder, is doubtless responsible for much of the  disgust which those organs excite in some minds.\"    At the same time, it is necessary to point out, such reflex influence may  act not in one direction only, but also in the reverse direction. From  the standpoint of ascetic contemplation eager to belittle humanity, the  excretory centers may cast dishonor upon the genital center which they  adjoin. From the more ecstatic standpoint of the impassioned lover, eager  to magnify the charm of the woman he worships, it is not impossible for  the excretory centers to take on some charm from the irradiating center of  sex which they enclose.    Even normally such a process is traceable. The normal lover may not  idealize the excretory functions of his mistress, but the fact that he  finds no repulsion in the most intimate contacts and feels no disgust at  the proximity of the excretory orifices or the existence of their  functions, indicates that the idealization of love has exerted at all  events a neutralizing influence; indeed, the presence of an acute  sensibility to the disturbing influence of this proximity of the excretory  orifices and their functions must be considered abnormal; Swift's  \"Strephon and Chloe\"--with the conviction underlying it that it is an easy  matter for the excretory functions to drown the possibilities of  love--could only have proceeded from a morbidly sensitive brain.[25]    A more than mere neutralizing influence, a positively idealizing influence  of the sexual focus on the excretory processes adjoining it, may take  place in the lover's mind without the normal variations of sexual  attraction being over-passed, and even without the creation of an  excretory fetichism.        Reflections of this attitude may be found in the poets. In the      _Song of Songs_ the lover says of his mistress, \"Thy navel is      like a round goblet, wherein no mingled wine is wanting;\" in his      lyric \"To Dianeme,\" Herrick says with clear reference to the      mons veneris:--            \"Show me that hill where smiling love doth sit,          Having a living fountain under it;\"        and in the very numerous poems in various languages which have      more or less obscurely dealt with the rose as the emblem of the      feminine pudenda there are occasional references to the stream      which guards or presides over the rose. It may, indeed, be      recalled that even in the name _nymphae_ anatomists commonly apply      to the _labia minora_ there is generally believed to be a poetic      allusion to the Nymphs who presided over streams, since the      _labia minora_ exert an influence on the direction of the urinary      stream.        In _Wilhelm Meister_ (Part I, Chapter XV), Goethe, on the basis      of his own personal experiences, describes his hero's emotions in      the humble surroundings of Marianne's little room as compared      with the stateliness and order of his own home. \"It seemed to him      when he had here to remove her stays in order to reach the      harpsichord, there to lay her skirt on the bed before he could      seat himself, when she herself with unembarrassed frankness would      make no attempt to conceal from him many natural acts which      people are accustomed to hide from others out of decency--it      seemed to him, I say, that he became bound to her by invisible      bands.\" We are told of Wordsworth (Findlay's _Recollections of De      Quincey_, p. 36) that he read _Wilhelm Meister_ till \"he came to      the scene where the hero, in his mistress's bedroom, becomes      sentimental over her dirty towels, etc., which struck him with      such disgust that he flung the book out of his hand, would never      look at it again, and declared that surely no English lady would      ever read such a work.\" I have, however, heard a woman of high      intellectual distinction refer to the peculiar truth and beauty      of this very passage.        In one of his latest novels, _Les Rencontres de M. de Breot_,      Henri de Regnier, one of the most notable of recent French      novelists, narrates an episode bearing on the matter before us. A      personage of the story is sitting for a moment in a dark grotto      during a night fete in a nobleman's park, when two ladies enter      and laughingly proceed to raise their garments and accomplish a      natural necessity. The man in the background, suddenly overcome      by a sexual impulse, starts forward; one lady runs away, the      other, whom he detains, offers little resistance to his advances."]]]
