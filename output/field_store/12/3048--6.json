John Greenleaf Whittier was born near Haverhill, Mass., in 1807, and died  at Hampton Falls, N.H., in 1892. His boyhood was passed on a farm, and he  never received a classical education. In 1829 he edited a newspaper in  Boston. In the following year he removed to Hartford, Conn., to assume a  similar position. In 1836 he edited an antislavery paper in Philadelphia.  In 1840 he removed to Amesbury, Mass. Mr. Whittier's parents were Friends,  and he always held to the same faith. He wrote extensively both in prose  and verse. As a poet, he ranked among those most highly esteemed and  honored by his countrymen. \"Snow Bound\" is one of the longest and best of  his poems.    1. Our bachelor uncle who lived with us was a quiet, genial man, much  given to hunting and fishing; and it was one of the pleasures of our young  life to accompany him on his expeditions to Great Hill, Brandy-brow Woods,  the Pond, and, best of all, to the Country Brook. We were quite willing to  work hard in the cornfield or the haying lot to finish the necessary day's  labor in season for an afternoon stroll through the woods and along the  brookside.    2. I remember my first fishing excursion as if it were but yesterday. I  have been happy many times in my life, but never more intensely so than  when I received that first fishing pole from my uncle's hand, and trudged  off with him through the woods and meadows. It was a still, sweet day of  early summer; the long afternoon shadows of the trees lay cool across our  path; the leaves seemed greener, the flowers brighter, the birds merrier,  than ever before.    3. My uncle, who knew by long experience where were the best haunts of  pickerel, considerately placed me at the most favorable point. I threw out  my line as I had so often seen others, and waited anxiously for a bite,  moving the bait in rapid jerks on the surface of the water in imitation of  the leap of a frog. Nothing came of it. \"Try again,\" said my uncle.  Suddenly the bait sank out of sight. \"Now for it,\" thought I; \"here is a  fish at last.\"    4. I made a strong pull, and brought up a tangle of weeds. Again and again  I cast out my line with aching arms, and drew it back empty. I looked at  my uncle appealingly. \"Try once more,\" he said; \"we fishermen must have  patience.\"    5. Suddenly something tugged at my line, and swept off with it into deep  water. Jerking it up, I saw a fine pickerel wriggling in the sun. \"Uncle!\"  I cried, looking back in uncontrollable excitement, \"I've got a fish!\"  \"Not yet,\" said my uncle. As he spoke there was a plash in the water; I  caught the arrowy gleam of a scared fish shooting into the middle of the  stream, my hook hung empty from the line. I had lost my prize.    6. We are apt to speak of the sorrows of childhood as trifles in  comparison with those of grown-up people; but we may depend upon it the  young folks don't agree with us. Our griefs, modified and restrained by  reason, experience and self-respect, keep the proprieties, and, if  possible, avoid a scene; but the sorrow of childhood, unreasoning and  all-absorbing, is a complete abandonment to the passion. The doll's nose  is broken, and the world breaks up with it; the marble rolls out of sight,  and the solid globe rolls off with the marble.    7. So, overcome with my great and bitter disappointment, I sat down on the  nearest hassock, and for a time refused to be comforted, even by my  uncle's assurance that there were more fish in the brook. He refitted my  bait, and, putting the pole again in my hands, told me to try my luck once  more.    8. \"But remember, boy,\" he said, with his shrewd smile, \"never brag of  catching a fish until he is on dry ground. I've seen older folks doing  that in more ways than one, and so making fools of themselves. It's no use  to boast of anything until it's done, nor then, either, for it speaks for  itself.\"    9. How often since I have been reminded of the fish that I did not catch.  When I hear people boasting of a work as yet undone, and trying to  anticipate the credit which belongs only to actual achievement, I call to  mind that scene by the brookside, and the wise caution of my uncle in that  particular instance takes the form of a proverb of universal application:  \"NEVER BRAG OF YOUR FISH BEFORE YOU CATCH HIM.\"      DEFINITIONS.--1. Gen'ial, cheerful. 3. Haunts, places frequently visited.  Con-sid'er-ate-ly, with due regard to others, kindly thoughtful. 4.  Ap-peal'ing-ly, as though asking for aid. 6. Mod'i-fied, qualified,  lessened. Pro-pri'e-ties, fixed customs or rules of conduct. Ab-sorb'ing,  engaging the attention entirely. 7, Has'sock, a raised mound of turf. 9.  An-tic'i-pate, to take before the proper time. A-chieve'ment, performance,  deed.        XII. IT SNOWS.    Sarah Josepha Hale (b. 1788?, d.1879) was born in Newport, N.H. Her maiden  name was Buell. In 1814 she married David Hale, an eminent lawyer, who  died in 1822. Left with five children to support, she turned her attention  to literature. In 1828 she became editor of the \"Ladies' Magazine.\" In  1837 this periodical was united with \"Godey's Lady's Book,\" of which Mrs.  Hale was literary editor for more than forty years.    1. \"It snows!\" cries the Schoolboy, \"Hurrah!\" and his shout       Is ringing through parlor and hall,     While swift as the wing of a swallow, he's out,       And his playmates have answered his call;     It makes the heart leap but to witness their joy;       Proud wealth has no pleasures, I trow,     Like the rapture that throbs in the pulse of the boy       As he gathers his treasures of snow;     Then lay not the trappings of gold on thine heirs,       While health and the riches of nature are theirs.    2. \"It snows!\" sighs the Imbecile, \"Ah!\" and his breath       Comes heavy, as clogged with a weight;     While, from the pale aspect of nature in death,       He turns to the blaze of his grate;     And nearer and nearer, his soft-cushioned chair       Is wheeled toward the life-giving flame;     He dreads a chill puff of the snow-burdened air,       Lest it wither his delicate frame;     Oh! small is the pleasure existence can give,       When the fear we shall die only proves that we live!    3. \"It snows!\" cries the Traveler, \"Ho!\" and the word       Has quickened his steed's lagging pace;     The wind rushes by, but its howl is unheard,       Unfelt the sharp drift in his face;     For bright through the tempest his own home appeared,       Ay, though leagues intervened, he can see:     There's the clear, glowing hearth, and the table prepared,       And his wife with her babes at her knee;     Blest thought! how it lightens the grief-laden hour,       That those we love dearest are safe from its power!    4. \"It snows!\" cries the Belle, \"Dear, how lucky!\" and turns       From her mirror to watch the flakes fall,     Like the first rose of summer, her dimpled cheek burns!       While musing on sleigh ride and ball:     There are visions of conquests, of splendor, and mirth,       Floating over each drear winter's day;     But the tintings of Hope, on this storm-beaten earth,       Will melt like the snowflakes away.     Turn, then thee to Heaven, fair maiden, for bliss;       That world has a pure fount ne'er opened in this.    5. \"It snows!\" cries the Widow, \"O God!\" and her sighs       Have stifled the voice of her prayer;     Its burden ye'll read in her tear-swollen eyes,       On her cheek sunk with fasting and care.     'T is night, and her fatherless ask her for bread,       But \"He gives the young ravens their food,\"     And she trusts till her dark hearth adds horror to dread.,       And she lays on her last chip of wood.     Poor sufferer! that sorrow thy God only knows;       'T is a most bitter lot to be poor when it snows.       DEFINITIONS.--1. Trow, to think, to believe. Trap'pings, ornanents. 2.   Im'be-cile, one who is feeble either in body or mind. 3. In-ter-vened',   were situated between. 4. Mus'ing, thinking in an absent-minded way.   Con'quests, triumphs, successes. Tint'ings slight colorings. 5. Sti'fled,   choked, suppressed.    REMARK.--Avoid reading this piece in a monotonous style. Try to express  the actual feeling of each quotation; and enter into the descriptions with  spirit.        XIII. RESPECT FOR THE SABBATH REWARDED.    1. In the city of Bath, not many years since, lived a barber who made a  practice of following his ordinary occupation on the Lord's day. As he was  on the way to his morning's employment, he happened to look into some  place of worship just as the minister was giving out his text--\"Remember  the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.\" He listened long enough to be convinced  that he was constantly breaking the laws of God and man by shaving and  dressing his customers on the Lord's day. He became uneasy, and went with  a heavy heart to his Sabbath task.    2. At length he took courage, and opened his mind to his minister, who  advised him to give up Sabbath work, and worship God. He replied that  beggary would be the consequence. He had a flourishing trade, but it would  almost all be lost. At length, after many a sleepless night spent in  weeping and praying, he was determined to cast all his care upon God, as  the more he reflected, the more his duty became apparent.    3. He discontinued his Sabbath work, went constantly and early to the  public services of religion, and soon enjoyed that satisfaction of mind  which is one of the rewards of doing our duty, and that peace which the  world can neither give nor take away. The consequences he foresaw actually  followed. His genteel customers left him, and he was nicknamed \"Puritan\"  or \"Methodist.\" He was obliged to give up his fashionable shop, and, in  the course of years, became so "]]]
