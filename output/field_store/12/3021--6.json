Then I heard her gentle voice, like the first tone of the organ, which  wakens us from our dreamy devotion, and she said:    \"Thus I desire you to love me, and thus the old Hofrath loves me, and  thus in one way or another we should all love and believe in each  other.  But the world, although I scarcely know it, does not seem to  understand this love and faith, and, on this earth, where we could have  lived so happily, men have made existence very wretched.    \"It must have been otherwise of old, else how could Homer have created  the lovely, wholesome, tender picture of Nausikaa?  Nausikaa loves  Ulysses at the first glance.  She says at once to her female friends:  'Oh, that I could call such a man my spouse, and that it were his  destiny to remain here.'  She was even too modest to appear in public  at the same time with him, and she says, in his presence, that if she  should bring such a handsome and majestic stranger home, the people  would say, she may have taken him for a husband.  How simple and  natural all this is!  But when she heard that he was going home to his  wife and children, no murmur escaped her.  She disappears from our  sight, and we feel that she carried the picture of the handsome and  majestic stranger a long time afterward in her breast, with silent and  joyful admiration.  Why do not our poets know this love--this joyful  acknowledgment, this calm abnegation?  A later poet would have made a  womanish Werter out of Nausikaa, for the reason that love with us is  nothing more than the prelude to the comedy, or the tragedy, of  marriage.  Is it true there is no longer any other love?  Has the  fountain of this pure happiness wholly dried up?  Are men only  acquainted with the intoxicating draught, and no longer with the  invigorating well-spring of love?\"    At these words the English poet occurred to me, who also thus complains:      From heaven if this belief be sent,      If such be nature's holy plan,    Have I not reason to lament      What man has made of man.    \"Yet, how happy the poets are,\" said she.  \"Their words call the  deepest feelings into existence in thousands of mute souls, and how  often their songs have become a confession of the sweetest secrets!  Their heart beats in the breasts of the poor and the rich.  The happy  sing with them, and the sad weep with them.  But I cannot feel any poet  so completely my own as Wordsworth.  I know many of my friends do not  like him.  They say he is not a poet.  But that is exactly why I like  him; he avoids all the hackneyed poetical catch-words, all  exaggeration, and everything comprehended in Pegasus-flights.  He is  true--and does not everything lie in this one word?  He opens our eyes  to the beauty which lies under our feet like the daisy in the meadow.  He calls everything by its true name.  He never intends to startle,  deceive, or dazzle any one.  He seeks no admiration for himself.  He  only shows mankind how beautiful everything is which man's hand has not  yet spoiled or broken.  Is not a dew-drop on a blade of grass more  beautiful than a pearl set in gold?  Is not a living spring, which  gushes up before us, we know not whence, more beautiful than all the  fountains of Versailles?  Is not his Highland Girl a lovelier and truer  expression of real beauty than Goethe's Helena, or Byron's Haidee?  And  then the plainness of his language, and the purity of his thoughts!  Is  it not a pity that we have never had such a poet?  Schiller could have  been our Wordsworth, had he had more faith in himself than in the old  Greeks and Romans.  Our Ruckert would come the nearest to him, had he  not also sought consolation and home under Eastern roses, away from his  poor Fatherland.  Few poets have the courage to be just what they are.  Wordsworth had it; and as we gladly listen to great men, even in those  moments when they are not inspired, but, like other mortals, quietly  cherish their thoughts, and patiently wait the moment that will  disclose new glimpses into the infinite, so have I also listened gladly  to Wordsworth himself, in his poems, which contain nothing more than  any one might have said.  The greatest poets allow themselves rest.  In  Homer we often read a hundred verses without a single beauty, and just  so in Dante; while Pindar, whom all admire so much, drives me to  distraction with his ecstacies.  What would I not give to spend one  summer on the lakes; visit with Wordsworth all the places to which he  has given names; greet all the trees which he has saved from the axe;  and only once watch a far-off sunset with him, which he describes as  only Turner could have painted.\"    It was a peculiarity of hers that her voice never dropped at the close  of her talk, as with most people; on the contrary, it rose and always  ended, as it were, in the broken seventh chord.  She always talked up,  never down, to people.  The melody of her sentences resembled that of  the child when it says: \"Can't I, father?\"  There was something  beseeching in her tones, and it was well-nigh impossible to gainsay her.    \"Wordsworth,\" said I, \"is a dear poet, and a still dearer man to me,  and as one often has a more beautiful, wide-spread, and stirring  outlook from a little hill which he ascends without effort, than when  he has clambered up Mont Blanc with difficulty and weariness, so it  seems to me with Wordsworth's poetry.  At first, he often appeared  commonplace to me, and I have frequently laid down his poems unable to  understand how the best minds of England to-day can cherish such an  admiration for him.  The conviction has grown upon me that no poet whom  his nation, or the intellectual aristocracy of his people, recognize as  a poet, should remain unenjoyed by us, whatever his language.  Admiration is an art which we must learn.  Many Germans say Racine does  not please them.  The Englishman says, 'I do not understand Goethe.'  The Frenchman says Shakespeare is a boor.  What does all this amount  to?  Nothing more than the child who says it likes a waltz better than  a symphony of Beethoven's.  The art consists in discovering and  understanding what each nation admires in its great men.  He who seeks  beauty will eventually find it, and discover that the Persians are not  entirely deceived in their Hafiz, nor the Hindoos in their Kalidasa.  We cannot understand a great man all at once.  It takes strength,  effort, and perseverance, and it is singular that what pleases us at  first sight seldom captivates us any length of time.    \"And yet,\" she continued, \"there is something common to all great  poets, to all true artists, to all the world's heroes, be they Persian  or Hindoo, heathen or Christian, Roman or German; it is--I hardly know  what to call it--it is the Infinite which seems to lie behind them, a  far away glance into the Eternal, an apotheosis of the most trifling  and transitory things.  Goethe, the grand heathen, knew the sweet peace  which comes from Heaven; and when he sings:        \"On every mountain-height        Is rest.      O'er each summit white        Thou feelest      Scarcely a breath.    The bird songs are still from each bough;    Only wait, soon shalt thou      Rest too, in death.    \"does not an endless distance, a repose which earth cannot give,  disclose itself to him above the fir-clad summits?  This background is  never wanting with Wordsworth.  Let the carpers say what they will, it  is nevertheless only the super-earthly, be it ever so obscure, which  charms and quiets the human heart.  Who has better understood this  earthly beauty than Michel Angelo?--but he understood it, because it  was to him a reflection of superearthly beauty.  You know his sonnet:      [\"La forza d'un bel volto al ciel mi sprona    (Ch'altro in terra non e che mi diletti),    E vivo ascendo tra gli spirti eletti;    Grazia ch'ad uom mortal raro si dona.    Si ben col suo Fattor l'opra consuona,    Ch'a lui mi levo per divin concetti;    E quivi informo i pensier tutti e i detti;    Ardendo, amando per gentil persona.    Onde, se mai da due begli occhi il guardo    Torcer non so, conosco in lor la luce    Che mi mostra la via, ch'a Dio mi guide;    E se nel lume loro acceso io ardo,    Nel nobil foco mio dolce riluce    La gioja che nel cielo eterna ride.\"]      \"The might of one fair face sublimes my love,    For it hath weaned my heart from low desires;    Nor death I heed nor purgatorial fires.    Thy beauty, antepast of joys above    Instructs me in the bliss that saints approve;    For, Oh! how good, how beautiful must be    The God that made so good a thing as thee,    So fair an image of the Heavenly Dove.    Forgive me if I cannot turn away    From those sweet eyes that are my earthly heaven,    For they are guiding stars, benignly given    To tempt my footsteps to the upward way;    And if I dwell too fondly in thy sight,    I live and love in God's peculiar light.\"    She was exhausted and silent, and how could I disturb that silence?  When human hearts, after friendly interchange of thoughts feel calmed  and quieted, it is as if an angel had flown through the room and we  heard the gentle flutter of wings over our heads.  As my gaze rested  upon her, her lovely form seemed illuminated in the twilight of the  summer evening, and her hand, which I held in mine, alone gave me the  consciousness of her real presence.  Then suddenly a bright refulgence  spread over her countenance.  She felt it, opened her eyes and looked  upon me wonderingly.  The wonderful brightness of her eyes, which the  half-closed eyelids covered as with a veil, shone like the lightning.  I looked around and at last saw that the moon had arisen in full  splendor between two peaks opposite the castle, and brightened the lake  and the village with its friendly smiles.  Never had I seen Nature,  never had I seen her dear face so beautiful, never had such holy rest  settled down upon my soul.  \"Marie,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14555"],[0,"William Lloyd Garrison, the Abolitionist (#11)"],[1,"\" He had not  apparently, so much as dreamed of any other than gradual emancipation.  \"The emancipation of all the slaves of this generation is most assuredly  out of the question,\" he said; \"the fabric which now towers above the  Alps, must be taken away brick by brick, and foot by foot, till it is  reduced so low that it may be overturned without burying the nation in  its ruins. Years may elapse before the completion of the achievement;  generations of blacks may go down to the grave, manacled and lacerated,  without a hope for their children.\" He was on the Fourth of July a firm  and earnest believer in the equity and efficacy of gradualism. But after  that day, and some time before his departure for Baltimore, he began to  think on this subject. The more he thought the less did gradualism seem  defensible on moral grounds. John Wesley had said that slavery was the  \"sum of all villainies\"; it was indeed the sin of sins, and as such  ought to be abandoned not gradually but immediately. Slave-holding was  sin and slaveholders were sinners. The sin and sinner should both be  denounced as such and the latter called to instant repentance, and the  duty of making immediate restitution of the stolen liberties of their  slaves. This was the tone ministers of religion held every where toward  sin and sinners, and this should be the tone held by the preachers of  Abolition toward slavery, and slaveholders. To admit the principle of  gradualism was for Abolition to emasculate itself of its most virile  quality. Garrison, consequently rejected gradualism as a weapon, and  took up instead the great and quickening doctrine of immediatism. Lundy  did not know of this change in the convictions of his coadjutor until  his arrival in Baltimore. Then Garrison frankly unburdened himself and  declared his decision to conduct his campaign against the national  iniquity along the lines of immediate and unconditional emancipation.  The two on this new radicalism did not see eye to eye. But Lundy with  sententious shrewdness and liberality suggested to the young radical:  \"Thee may put thy initials to thy articles and I will put my initials to  mine, and each will bear his own burden.\" And the arrangement pleased  the young radical, for it enabled him to free his soul of the necessity  which was then sitting heavily upon it. The precise state of his mind in  respect of the question at this juncture in its history and in his own  is made plain enough in his salutatory address in _The Genius of  Universal Emancipation_. The vow made in Bennington ten months before to  devote his life to philanthrophy, and the dedication of himself made six  months afterward to the extirpation of American slavery, he solemnly  renews and reseals in Baltimore. He does not hate intemperance and war  less, but slavery more, and those, therefore, he formally relegates  thenceforth to a place of secondary importance in the endeavors of the  future. It is obvious that the colonization scheme has no strong hold  upon his intelligence. He does not conceal his respect for it as an  instrument of freedom, but he puts no high value on its utility. \"It may  pluck a few leaves,\" he remarks, \"from the Bohon Upas, but can neither  extract its roots nor destroy its withering properties. Viewed as an  auxiliary, it deserves encouragement; but as a remedy it is altogether  inadequate.\" But this was not all. As a remedy, colonization was not  only altogether inadequate, its influence was indirectly pernicious, in  that it lulled the popular mind into \"a belief that the monster has  received his mortal wound.\" He perceived that this resultant  indifference and apathy operated to the advantage of slavery, and to the  injury of freedom. Small, therefore, as was the good which the  Colonization Society was able to achieve, it was mixed with no little  ill. Although Garrison has not yet begun to think on the subject, to  examine into the motives and purposes of the society, it does not take a  prophet to foresee that some day he will. He had already arrived at  conclusions in respect of the rights of the colored people \"to choose  their own dwelling place,\" and against the iniquity of their  expatriation, which cut directly at the roots of the colonization  scheme. Later the pro-slavery character of the society will be wholly  revealed to him. But truth in the breast of a reformer as of others must  needs follow the great law of moral growth, first the blade, then the  ear, and then the full corn in the ear. It is enough that he has made  the tremendous step from gradual to immediate and unconditional  emancipation on the soil.    At this period he tested the disposition of slaveholders to manumit  their slaves. The Colonization Society had given it out that there was  no little desire on the part of many masters to set their slaves free.  All that was wanted for a practical demonstration in this direction was  the assurance of free transportation out of the country for the  emancipated slaves. Lundy had made arrangement for the transportation of  fifty slaves to Hayti and their settlement in that country. So he and  Garrison advertised this fact in the _Genius_, but they waited in vain  for a favorable response from the South--notwithstanding the following  humane inducement which this advertisement offered: \"THE PRICE OF  PASSAGE WILL BE ADVANCED, and everything furnished of which they may  stand in need, until they shall have time to prepare their houses and  set in to work.\" No master was moved to take advantage of the  opportunity. This was discouraging to the believers in the efficacy of  colonization as a potent anti-slavery instrument. But Garrison was no  such believer. With unerring moral instinct he had from the start placed  his reliance \"on nothing but the eternal principles of justice for the  speedy overthrow of slavery.\"    He obtained at this period an intimate personal knowledge of the free  colored people. He saw that they were not essentially unlike other  races--that there was nothing morally or intellectually peculiar about  them, and that the evil or the good which they manifested was the common  property of mankind in similar circumstances. He forthwith became their  brave defender against the common slanders of the times. \"There is a  prevalent disposition among all classes to traduce the habits and morals  of our free blacks,\" he remarked in the _Genius_. \"The most scandalous  exaggerations in regard to their condition are circulated by a thousand  mischievous tongues, and no reproach seems to them too deep or  unmerited. Vile and malignant indeed is this practice, and culpable are  they who follow it. We do not pretend to say that crime, intemperance,  and suffering, to a considerable extent, cannot be found among the free  blacks; but we do assert that they are as moral, peaceable, and  industrious as that class of the whites who are, like them, in indigent  circumstances--and far less intemperate than the great body of foreign  immigrants who infest and corrupt our shores.\" This idea of the natural  equality of the races he presented in the _Genius_ a few weeks before  with Darwinian breadth in the following admirable sentences: \"I deny the  postulate that God has made, by an irreversible decree, or any inherent  qualities, one portion of the human race superior to another. No matter  how many breeds are amalgamated--no matter how many shades of color  intervene between tribes or nations give them the same chances to  improve, and a fair start at the same time, and the result will be  equally brilliant, equally productive, equally grand.\"    At the same time that he was making active, personal acquaintance with  the free colored people, he was making actual personal acquaintance with  the barbarism of slavery also. \"The distinct application of a whip, and  the shrieks of anguish\" of the slave, his residence in Baltimore had  taught him was \"nothing uncommon\" in that city. Such an instance had  come to him while in the street where the office of the _Genius_ was  located. It was what was occurring at almost all hours of the day and in  almost all parts of the town. He had not been in Baltimore a month when  he saw a specimen of the brutality of slavery on the person of a negro,  who had been mercilessly flogged. On his back were thirty-seven gashes  made with a cowskin, while on his head were many bruises besides. It was  a Sunday morning, fresh from his terrible punishment, that the poor  fellow had found the editors of the _Genius_, who, with the compassion  of brothers, took him in, dressed his wounds, and cared for him for two  days. Such an experience was no new horror to Lundy, but it was  doubtless Garrison's first lesson in that line, and it sank many fathoms  deep into his heart.    Maryland was one of the slave-breeding States and Baltimore a slave  emporium. There was enacted the whole business of slavery as a  commercial enterprise. Here the human chattels were brought and here  warehoused in jails and other places of storage and detention. Here they  were put up at public auction, and knocked down to the highest bidder,  and from here they were shipped to New Orleans, the great distributing  center for such merchandise. He heard what Lundy had years before heard,  the wail of captive mothers and fathers, wives, husbands and children,  torn from each other; like Lundy, \"he felt their pang of distress; and  the iron entered his soul.\" He could not hold his peace in the midst of  such abominations, but boldly exposed and denounced them. His  indignation grew hot when he saw that Northern vessels were largely  engaged in the coastwise slave-trade; and when, to his amazement, he  learned that the ship _Francis_, owned by Francis Todd, a Newburyport  merchant, had sailed for New Orleans with a gang of seventy-five slaves,  his indignation burst into blaze. He blazoned the act and the name of  Francis Todd in the _Genius_, and did verily "]]]
