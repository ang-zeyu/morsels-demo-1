And the child reacts to  feeling equally intense. These are normal reactions to stimuli--normal,  under the circumstances.      THE NORMAL MIND    The normal mind reasons clearly with the best data at hand to results  that will stand the test of conformity to reality; the normal mind uses  reason and feeling, guided by reasonable attitude; in the normal mind  _reason_ advises action and _will_ brings it about; in the normal mind  _feeling_ proportionate to the circumstances accompanies every thought  and every action. And in the well-balanced man or woman every function  of the mind leads to action as its final end.    But man only approximates the normal. The perfectly balanced man or  woman is so rare as to be a marked person. The average intelligent  individual only in general approximates this standard. He goes beyond it  in spurts of untrammeled genius, to wrench lightning from the heavens,  and to send his trains through the air; or he allows his feelings to  dictate to his reason, and much of the time so exaggerates or  depreciates the simple facts of life that the results of his reasoning  no longer conform sufficiently to reality as to be thoroughly  dependable.          CHAPTER VII    PSYCHOLOGY AND HEALTH      In the use of its functions the mind manifests certain powers and  certain modes of expression which can act as powerful allies or as  damaging enemies of health. We speak of man as adaptable, but also as a  being of habits. We speak of him as \"feeling\" when we wish to express  the fact that his emotions influence his body. We expect of the average  man a certain amount of suggestibility. We say that he is tremendously  affected by his environment, which simply means that his attention,  naturally centered chiefly on the things at hand, largely determines  what he is. But we recognize that a man of trained mind can choose and  will to substitute for his present surroundings thoughts upon more  constructive things from past experience, or from future possibilities,  or from within the mind's own storehouse. His ability to largely modify  his life by his will, we recognize as man's greatest power.  _Adaptability_, emotional response, _suggestibility_, _attention_,  _thought-substitution_, _habit-formation_, and _will_ can minister  vitally to health, or can prove damaging avenues of disease.      NECESSITY OF ADAPTABILITY    Adaptability is as essential to life of mind as to life of body; and  health of mind as well as health of body is determined by the individual  ability to adjust himself to environment.    There are dreamers who have lived in their ideal world so long that they  cannot meet the stern realities of life when they come. The shock is too  great for the mind that has accepted only the fantastic, the real as the  dreamer would have it; and he lets go altogether his hold on the actual,  accepting the would-be world as present fact. And we call him insane.  Other visionaries wakened rudely to life as it is, accept it as  unchangeable fate, lose all their true ideals and become cynical, or  victims of utter depression for whom life holds nothing that matters.  Still others go on through the years self-satisfied and serene because  they simply refuse to believe unpleasant truths; they \"pretend\" that  their wishes are realities, and acknowledge as facts only the pleasant  things of existence. The first two groups have failed to adapt self to  life as it is, and the mind is lost or so damaged as to no longer serve  its body properly. The \"pretenders\" have adjusted themselves, and so  long as they can remain happily self-deceived all goes well for them,  though they complicate living for others. However, they have made an  adaptation, a defective one, it is true, but one through which the mind  may survive. Some of this class, however, finally build up a more and  more elaborate system of self-deception until they, too, are insane.    The practically adaptable man can dream dreams, but always recognizes  them as dreams, and can stop at will; can vision a beautiful ideal, but  comprehends that it is not yet reality, though it may some time become  so if he learns and fulfils the laws leading to its realization. The  adaptable man or woman recognizes the real as fact, desirable or  otherwise, the fantastic as unreal and only to be indulged in as a  pastime, and the ideal as the possible, a thing for which to work and  sacrifice. So perfect adaptability would mean perfect mental poise.    It is for the nurse to realize that the greater number of her patients  do not belong to any of these classes absolutely, but that some of them  have tendencies leading in these various directions. And it is her  privilege to recognize the trend of her sick patient's mental workings,  and to so deftly and unobtrusively encourage the recognition of facts as  things which are to be used--not as stumbling-blocks--that her mental  nursing, as her physical, shall be directed toward health. She can  help her patient to accept illness and suffering as realities to be  faced, and treatment as a means, whether pleasant or not, of making it  possible for health to replace them. The understanding nurse can  actively help her charge one step at a time toward adaptation to the new  environment, remembering that many of the sick, particularly the  depressed, cannot be encouraged or incited to effort by having future  health held out to them. They are capable only of living in the present  and doubting all the future.    _There Can Be No Neurosis Without a Psychosis._--If the brain is the  organ of the mind, then what affects the brain must perforce be at  least registered by mind. So every physical shock, accident, toxic  condition, infection--even the ordinary cold--rouses the mind at least  to awareness, usually to discomfort. For the nerve-cells and  fibers--those inseparable parts of the body mechanism--speedily report  the fact that they are being tampered with. In the toxicity of the  infections these very delicate tissues are nourished by toxic fluids;  in accidents they carry all the messages from the injured part. Then  the brain--that center of all man's reactions and the organ of all his  consciousness--receives the report of the disturbance and translates  it into terms of more or less disability. The neurosis has become a  psychosis. The physical condition has become a mental discomfort.  Normally this ensuing mind state should be in accordance with the  extent of the injury to the nerve-cells and fibers. But under  long-continued discipline, or influenced by emotion, the conscious  mind may not recognize the neurosis; whereas, in the hypersuggestible,  consciousness will translate it into entirely disproportionate  suffering.    A great problem of nervous education is what the mind will do with  discomfort or pain. Will it put all its attention there and respond with  nervousness, irritability, demand for sympathy; or will it relegate all  the minor pains to their own little places, accepted as facts but to be  disregarded except in so far as actual treatment is needed? Will it turn  to attend to the host of other more desirable objects? Or in case of  acute suffering, will it take it as a challenge to endurance? Will it  use it as a means to strengthen volition, as a stepping-stone to  self-mastery?    Realizing the force of the law--no neurosis without a psychosis--the  nurse will try to eliminate unnecessary irritations to physical comfort,  while she helps the patient to adjust himself to the ones which are  inevitable. It is the doctor's problem rather than hers, except as she  carefully fulfils orders, to eliminate the toxic causes of psychosis. It  is hers to help the patient to meet adequately the effects of the  infections or toxins, and to prevent as far as possible the surrender to  uncontrolled nervousness. Her object is to have him face the psychosis  as one of the simple facts of science, then turn the sick mind's  attention to more important things; she would encourage _will_ to force  endurance; she would stimulate the feeling life to the forward look of  confidence and faith, or to acceptance of life's suffering as a  challenge. The nurse knows that pains beyond the power of endurance the  doctor will lighten. And the patient's reaction to discomfort and  suffering, the understanding nurse, without any preaching, can very  largely influence.      THE POWER OF SUGGESTION    One almost universal condition found in illness is  _hypersuggestability_. Here is the nurse's despair and her hope.  Suggestion may come from without or from within. When from within, we  call it autosuggestion.    Many of the sick are temporarily resting their reasoning faculties and  their judgment. The sick body is causing a feeling of \"jangling nerves,\"  and the mind, too, is strongly tempted to be sick. So every harsh sound,  every jolt, almost every sentence spoken in their hearing suggests  immediate nervous reactions. The mind does not wait to weigh them. The  nervous system reacts to them the second the impression is registered.  The whole self is oversensitive, and the very inflection of a voice has  enormous significance. Let the nurse remember that her way of giving a  treatment, her expression, or her very presence becomes a potent  stimulus on the second, one to which the patient's mind responds like a  flash-light when the button is pressed.    The nurse must comprehend the principle of the nervous effect on the  patient of all that is done and said, and realize her tremendous  privilege in making those stimuli wholesome. The nurse who has a  sympathetic insight, with unswerving loyalty to orders, can carry them  out with the average patient, unpleasant though they may be to him, in  such a way that his wholesome emotional response will be called forth, a  response of co-operation, or of faith or of good breeding, or of  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18845"],[0,"Seeing Europe with Famous Authors, Volume 7 (#11)"],[1,"wing, its two upper floors divided into a great  number of small but complete suites of apartments, occupied permanently,  or occasionally, by persons attached to the Court.    During conclave these are allotted, literally so, to the cardinals, each  of whom lives apart, with his attendants. His food is brought daily from  his own house, and is examined, and delivered to him in the shape of  \"broken victuals,\" by the watchful guardians of the turns and lattices,  through which alone anything, even conversation, can penetrate into the  seclusion of that sacred retreat. For a few hours, the first evening,  the doors are left open, and the nobility, the diplomatic body, and in  fact all presentable persons, may roam from cell to cell, paying a brief  compliment to their occupants, perhaps speaking the same good wishes to  fifty, which they know can be accomplished in only one.    After that all is closed; a wicket is left accessible for the entrance  of any cardinal who is not yet arrived; but every aperture is jealously  guarded by faithful janitors, judges and prelates of various tribunals,  who relieve one another. Every letter even is opened and read, that no  communications may be held with the outer world. The very street on  which the wing of the conclave looks is barricaded and guarded by a  picket at each end; and as, fortunately, there are no private residences  opposite, and all the buildings have access from the back, no  inconvenience is thereby created.    While conclave lasts, the administrative power rests in the hands of the  Cardinal Chamberlain, who strikes his own coins during its continuance;  and he is assisted by three cardinals, called the \"Heads of Orders,\"  because they represent the three orders in the sacred college, of  bishops, priests and deacons. The ambassadors of the great powers  receive fresh credentials to the conclave, and proceed in state, to  present them to this delegation, at the grille. An address, carefully  prepared, is delivered by the envoy, and receives a well-pondered reply  from the presiding cardinal.    Twice a day the cardinals meet in the chapel contained within the  palace, and there, on tickets so arranged that the voter's name can not  be seen, write the name of him for whom they give their suffrage. These  papers are examined in their presence, and if the number of votes given  to any one do not constitute the majority, they are burned, in such a  manner that the smoke, issuing through a flue, is visible to the crowd  usually assembled in the square outside.    Some day, instead of this usual signal to disperse, the sound of pick  and hammer is heard, and a small opening is seen in the wall which had  temporarily blocked up the great window over the palace gateway. At last  the masons of the conclave have opened a rude door, through which steps  out on the balcony the first Cardinal Deacon, and proclaims to the many,  or to the few, who may happen to be waiting, that they again possess a  sovereign and a Pontiff.          AN AUDIENCE WITH PIUS X[19]    BY MARY EMOGENE HAZELTINE      We arrived in Rome at three in the afternoon, with letters which ensured  us an audience with the Pope. A friend, long resident in Rome, who  advised us to present them at once, accompanied us to the Vatican.  Passing through an interesting part of the city, including the St.  Angelo Bridge across the Tiber, we soon found ourselves in the  world-famous Colonnade of St. Peter's. Ascending the steps leading to  the Vatican, we passed the Swiss Guard in their famous uniforms designed  by Michelangelo, and climbed what seemed like endless stairs, passing  guards at almost every turn, who pointed out the way indicated by the  address on our credentials.    Arriving at an anteroom, a priestly secretary, speaking excellent  English, read our letter with what seemed to us, from the expression of  his face, great interest and evident approval. Why should this not have  been? Our letter was from the Apostolic Delegate then in Washington--the  Pope's own representative in America. It was in Italian, in the highest  official form, and conveyed the intelligence that we were traveling in  Italy for a brief vacation, mentioned all four of us by name, and said  that, while we were not Catholics, we respected the faith and would  carefully observe all the forms prescribed for an audience. The  monseigneur whom we were to see was at that time engaged with several  bishops. Because of this, we were asked to present ourselves at the same  hour on Saturday, meanwhile leaving our letter.    Promptly at the hour I was again at the door of the major domo,  Monseigneur Bisleti, to be received again by the priestly secretary, by  whom I was taken into the palatial rooms of the monseigneur. A moment  here was sufficient to explain my errand and receive from the  monseigneur the long-coveted permission, which I found had already been  made out in due form for four persons. Our cards entitled us to  admission on the following day, which made necessary unexpected haste in  arranging for the official costume of black. Fortunately we had all  brought black veils and some of us either gowns or skirts. With help  from others, we secured one or two necessary waists, and from our  hostess obtained the rosaries I wished to have blest by the Pope. Our  hostess then gave us a dress rehearsal, in order that we might fully  understand what to us would be an imposing ceremony. An audience is a  great function and the procedure accordingly is rigid.    On reaching the Vatican next day, we were directed by the Swiss Guard,  not to the major domo's apartments as before, but through a court and  thence up the grandest of staircases in three long flights, the walls  lined with beautiful marbles more wonderful than many pictures, the  light coming through magnificent stained-glass windows. In every sense  here was a palatial, an imperial, entrance. At the head of the stairway  we were met by gorgeous chamberlains, the body servants of the Pope,  clad in superb magenta brocaded velvet, with knee breeches, magenta silk  stockings, and great silver buckles on their shoes. Streamers hanging  from their arms at the back, added to the official appearance of these  men in their gorgeous uniforms.    We were shown through a magnificent antechamber, and then into a series  of reception rooms, through which we were motioned on, until we came to  the fourth, where were just four chairs which seemed to be waiting for  us four. Swiss guards patrolled the rooms, and others--chamberlains, I  suppose. We had a full half hour in which to wait here, but we could use  it to advantage, in watching the gathering company, and viewing the  magnificent room, hung as it was with rich red moire silk, as were all  others of the suite. The ladies in black garb became very effective  figures in this brilliant setting. There were many beautiful tapestries  in the rooms, one room having a tapestried frieze. The furniture was  massive, either of inlaid wood or heavy gilt, and the floors of  beautiful inlaid marble. It is not possible to give any adequate idea of  these stately rooms, nor of their exquisite appointments; nor yet of the  gathering company, for many high officials of the church passed before  us and through to rooms beyond, which added to the interest of the  occasion and the splendor of the scene.    We learned soon that this was to be no ordinary audience, but a special  one granted to alumni of the American College in Rome. A few days before  we left New York, a large company of American priests, graduates of the  American College, had sailed on a chartered steamer to celebrate the  fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the college, from which they had  received holy orders. This audience had been specially arranged for  them. We were therefore more than favored in having an audience at the  same time, a fact due probably to the credentials with which we had come  provided. We now understood that the officials of the church who had  entered this room were our own American bishops. With them had however  come others of high rank. Over their priestly robes of black they wore  rich purple silk capes, falling to the floor, and purple sashes. (There  are, of course, technical terms for these garments, but I do not know  them.) The special body guard of the Pope, three men chosen from the  Palatine guard, and in soldier's uniform, now passed through the room  with a noble guard of the Knights of Malta and Count Moroni, also in  uniform, with chapeau, feathered with plumes of black and white.    At exactly half after eleven, Monseigneur Bisleti, watch in hand,  bustled through, followed by bishops and priests. We were at once on our  knees, for His Holiness was seen to be approaching from rooms beyond. As  he advanced we could see his small figure, clad in white, surrounded by  court attendants, American bishops, an archbishop, the Palatine guard,  Monseigneur Bisleti, and the Knight of Malta. Between us and the doorway  through which he approached, stood a girl of twelve, in white garments  and veil. She had come from her first communion. Near her was a  Franciscan monk, who evidently had just returned from some mission  field, for he was bronzed, and haggard, and worn as to his garments. As  the Pope passed he gave a special word of blessing to the monk, and a  smile to the child.    The ceremony of the audience itself was simple. The Pope walked past the  kneeling people, giving to each his hand. This each one took, kissing  his ring. Filling the center of the room, as we were kneeling around the  sides, were the priestly courtiers, the Papal delegate, in gray robes, a  prominent figure among them. The Pope passed on through several rooms  filled with waiting priests. We were then all bidden to follow to the  throne room, for a special ceremony. An audience generally ends when the  Pope leaves the room in which he receives you,"]]]
