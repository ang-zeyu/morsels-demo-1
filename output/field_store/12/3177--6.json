The Danish people opened their arms in  welcome and gave us of their best with both hands. Every one went out of  their way to be good to us, from the manager of the delightful Hotel  Cosmopolite, where we were staying, to the utter strangers who sent us  flowers, fruit, sweets, illustrated papers and invitations to every  possible meal in such profusion.    Miss Jessen, the secretary of the Danish Council of Nurses, called at  once and arranged a most delightful programme for every day of our stay  in Copenhagen, bringing us invitations to see over the most important  hospitals, and the Finsen Light Institute, the old Guildhall, the  picture gallery, and anything else any of us wanted to see.    [Illustration: MAP OF OUR NORTHERN JOURNEY]    The president, Madame Tscherning, and the members of the same council,  arranged a most delightful afternoon reception for us at the Palace  Hotel, at which Dr. Norman Hansen welcomed us in the name of Denmark,  and read us a poem which he had written in our honour.         TO THE BRITISH SURGEONS AND NURSES PASSING COPENHAGEN ON THEIR WAY       FROM BELGIUM        Silent, we bid you welcome, in silence you answer'd our greeting      Because our lips must be closed, and your teeth are set                                Against the gale.      Our mouths are mute, our minds are open--      We shall greet you farewell in silence;      Sowers of good-will on fields where hate is sown--                                Fare ye well.         C. NORMAN HANSEN, M.D.    That evening at dinner we all found a beautiful bunch of violets tied up  with the Danish colours on our plates, and a pretty Danish medal with  the inscription \"Our God--our Land--our Honour\" which had been issued to  raise a fund for the Danish Red Cross Society. This was a little  surprise for us on the part of the manager of the hotel, who, like  every one else, simply overwhelmed us with kindness. One simply felt  dreadfully ashamed of oneself for not having done more to deserve all  this.    On the first day of our arrival in Denmark came the news of the downfall  of Antwerp, and through all these delightful invitations and receptions  there was a feeling in my heart that I was not free yet to enjoy myself.  The downfall of Antwerp seemed almost like a personal loss. We had been  so close to it, had shared our Belgian friends' hopes and fears, had  watched the big German howitzers going out on the Antwerp road, had  heard the bombardment of the forts, on our long journey through Belgium  had seen the enormous reinforcements being sent up to take it. And now  it had gone, and the Germans were marching on Ostend. What was the end  of all this going to be? We _must_ win in the end--but they are so  strong and well organized--so _dreadfully_ strong.    In that same paper I read an account from a Russian correspondent,  telling of the distress in Poland, which they described as the \"Belgium  of Russia.\" It stated that the news just then was not good; the Germans  were approaching Warsaw, and that the people in many of the villages  were almost starving, as the Germans had eaten up almost everything.  (How well I could believe that!) The paper went on to say that the  troops were suffering severely from cholera and from typhoid fever and  that there was a great scarcity of trained nurses. That gave me the clue  for which I was unconsciously seeking--we had been turned out of  Belgium, and now, perhaps, our work was to be in that other Belgium of  Russia.    Three other Sisters wished to join me, and I telegraphed to St. John's  to ask permission to offer our services to the Russian Red Cross. The  answer was delayed, and as we could not go to Russia without permission  from headquarters, we most reluctantly prepared to go back to England  with all the others.    On the last morning our luggage, labelled Christiania-Bergen-Newcastle,  had already gone down to the station when the expected telegram arrived:  \"You and three Sisters named may volunteer Russian Red Cross.\" We flew  down to the station and by dint of many tips and great exertions we got  our luggage out again. I should have been sorry to have lost my little  all for the second time.    This permission to serve with the Russian Red Cross was confirmed later  by a most kind letter from Sir Claude Macdonald, chairman of the St.  John's Committee, so we felt quite happy about our enterprise.    We could not start for Russia for another ten days. We were to be  inoculated against cholera for one thing, and then there were passports  and vises to get and arrangements for the journey to be made. The  ordinary route was by Aboe, Stockholm and Helsingfors, but we were very  strongly advised not to go this way, first, because of the possibility  of mines in the Baltic, and, secondly, because a steamer, recently  crossing that way, had been actually boarded, and some English people  taken off by the Germans. And we had no desire to be caught a second  time.    So it was decided to my great joy that we should travel all the way  round by land, through Sweden, through a little bit of Lapland, just  touching the Arctic Circle, through Finland and so to Petrograd. The  thought of the places we had to go through thrilled me to the  core--Karungi, Haparanda, Lapptrask, Torneo--the very names are as  honey to the lips.           *       *       *       *       *    One might have expected that all the kindness and hospitality would  cease on the departure of the majority of the party, but it was not so.  Invitations of all kinds were showered on us. Lunches were the chief  form of entertainment and very interesting and delightful they were.  There was a lunch at the British Legation, one at the French Legation,  one at the Belgian Legation where the minister was so pathetically glad  of any crumbs of news of his beloved country; a delightful dinner to  meet Prince Gustav of Denmark, an invitation to meet Princess Mary of  Greece, another lunch with Madame Tscherning, the president of the  Danish Council of Nurses, and the \"Florence Nightingale of Denmark.\"  Altogether we should have been thoroughly spoilt if it had lasted any  longer! One of the most delightful invitations was to stay at Vidbek for  the remainder of our time, a dear little seaside place with beautiful  woods, just then in their full glory of autumnal colouring. It was  within easy reach of Copenhagen and we went in almost every day, for  one reason or another, and grew very fond of the beautiful old city.    The time came for us to say good-bye. I was very sorry indeed to leave  dear little Denmark where we had had such a warm welcome. Denmark is, of  course, officially, absolutely neutral, but she cannot forget the ties  of blood and friendship that bind the two island countries together.  They are indeed a splendid people to be kin to, tall and fair and  strong, as becomes an ancient race of sea-kings. I only hope that it may  be my good fortune, some day, to be able to repay in some small measure  all the wealth of kindness so freely poured out for us.    On Saturday, October 24, at 7 P. M. we started for Lapland! Many  of our very kind friends came down to the station to give us a good  send-off and with last presents of flowers, fruit, chocolates and  papers. We crossed first to Malmoe on the ferry, which took about an hour  and a half. It was very calm and clear, and we watched the little  twinkling lights of Denmark gradually disappear and the lights of Sweden  gradually emerge in exchange. At Malmoe there was a customs examination  which was not very severe, as our things were all marked with a huge Red  Cross, and then we got into a funny little horse tram that conveyed us  to the station.    When morning broke we were speeding along towards Stockholm. The country  was very different from Denmark, much wilder, with rocks and trees and  sand and an occasional glimpse of lake. At that time Sweden was supposed  to bear little good-will towards England, and certainly our reception in  that land was distinctly a chilly one. We drove on arrival to a hotel  which had been recommended to us and asked the concierge if there were  rooms. He said there were, so we had our luggage taken down and  dismissed the cab. The concierge then looked at us suspiciously, and  said, \"You are English?\" \"Yes, we are English.\" He then went and  confabbed for some minutes with the manageress, and returned. \"There are  people still in the rooms, they will not be ready for twenty minutes.\"  \"Then we will have breakfast now and go to our rooms after.\" Another  long conversation with the manageress, and then he returned again.  \"There are no rooms.\" \"But you said there were rooms.\" \"There are no  rooms.\" Evidently there were none for English travellers anyway, so we  went to another hotel opposite the station, where they were civil, but  no more. We had to stay in Stockholm twenty-four hours and simply hated  it. I had heard much of this \"Venice of the North,\" but the physical  atmosphere was as chilly and unfriendly as the mental one.    The recollection stamped on my memory is of a grey, cheerless town where  it rained hard almost the whole time, and a bitter wind blowing over the  quays which moaned and sobbed like a lost banshee.    I was asked to luncheon at the British Legation, and this proved a very  fortunate occurrence for us all, as the minister was so kind as to go to  great trouble in getting us a special permit from the Swedish Foreign  Office to sleep at Boden. Boden is a fortified frontier town and no  foreigners are, as a rule, allowed to stay the night there, but have to  go on to Lulea, and return to Boden the next morning. We started off on  the next lap of our northern journey that evening, and again through  the minister's kind intervention were lucky in getting a carriage to  ourselves in a very full train, and arrived twenty-four"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17594"],[0,"Lectures on Language, as Particularly Connected with English Grammar. (#11)"],[1,"_government_. Now let a  scholar parse correctly the example given. \"_Father's_\" is a common  noun, third person, singular number, masculine gender, and _governed_ by  house:\" Rule, \"One noun _governs_ another,\" &c. Then my father does not  govern his own house, but his house him! What must be the conduct and  condition of the family, if they have usurped the government of their  head? \"John Jones, hatter, keeps constantly for sale all kinds of _boy's  hats_. Parse boy's. It is a noun, possessive case, _governed_ by hats.\"  What is the possessive case? It \"signifies the _relation of property or  possession_.\" Do the hats belong to the boys? Oh no. Are they the  _property_ or in the _possession_ of the boys? Certainly not. Then what  relation is there of property or possession? None at all. They belong to  John Jones, were made by him, are his property, and by him are  advertised for sale. He has used the word _boy's_ to distinguish their  size, quality, and fitness for boy's use.    \"The master's slave.\" Master's is in the possessive case, and _governed_  by slave! If grammars are true there can be no need of abolition  societies, unless it is to look after the master and see that he is not  abused. The rider's horse; the captain's ship; the general's army; the  governor's cat; the king's subject. How false it would be to teach  scholars the idea of _property_ and _government_ in such cases. The  _teacher's scholars_ should never learn that by virtue of their  grammars, or the _apostrophe_ and letter _s_, they have a right to  _govern_ their teachers; nor the mother's son, to govern his mother. Our  merchants would dislike exceedingly to have the _ladies_ understand them  to signify by their advertisements that the \"ladies' merino shawls, the  ladies's bonnets and lace wrought veils, the ladies' gloves and elegant  Thibet, silk and challa dresses, were the _property_ of the ladies; for  in that case they might claim or _possess_ themselves of their  _property_, and no longer trouble the merchant with the care of it.    \"Peter's wife's mother lay sick of a fever.\" \"_His_ physician said that  _his_ disease would require _his_ utmost skill to defeat _its_ progress  in _his_ limbs.\" Phrases like these are constantly occurring, which can  not be explained intelligibly by the existing grammars. In fact, the  words said to be nouns in the possessive case, have changed their  character, by use, from nouns to adjectives, or definitive words, and  should thus be classed. Russia iron, Holland gin, China ware, American  people, the Washington tavern, Lafayette house, Astor house, Hudson  river, (formerly Hudson's,) Baffin's bay, Van Dieman's land, John  street, Harper's ferry, Hill's bridge, a paper book, a bound book, a red  book, John's book--one which John is known to use, it may be a borrowed  one, but generally known as some way connected with him,--Rev. Mr.  Smith's church, St. John's church, Grace church, Murray's grammar; not  the property nor in the possession of Lindley Murray, neither does it  _govern him_; for he has gone to speak a purer language than he taught  on earth. It is mine. I bought it, have possessed it these ten years;  but, thank fortune, am little _governed_ by it. But more on this point  when we come to the proper place. What I have said, will serve as a  hint, which will enable you to see the impropriety of adopting the  \"possessive case.\"    It may be said that more cases are employed in other languages. That is  a poor reason why we should break the barriers of natural language.  Beside, I know not how we should decide by that rule, for none of them  have a _case_ that will compare with the English possessive. The  genitive of the French, Latin, or Greek, will apply in only a few  respects. The former has _three_, the latter five, and the Latin six  cases, neither of which correspond with the possessive, as explained by  Murray and his satellites. We should be slow to adopt into our language  an idiom which does not belong to it, and compel learners to make  distinctions where none exist. It is an easy matter to tell children  that the apostrophe and letter _s_ marks the possessive case; but when  they ask the difference in the meaning between the use of the noun and  those which all admit are adjectives, it will be no indifferent task to  satisfy them. What is the difference in the construction of language or  the sense conveyed, between Hudson'_s_ river, and _Hudson_ river?  Davis's straits, or Bass straits? St. John's church, or Episcopal  church? the sun's beams, or sun shine? In all cases these words are used  to define the succeeding noun. They regard \"property or possession,\"  only when attending circumstances, altogether foreign from any quality  in the form or meaning of the word itself, are so combined as to give it  that import. And in such cases, we retain these words as adjectives,  long after the property has passed from the hands of the persons who  gave it a name. _Field's_ point, _Fuller's_ rocks, _Fisher's_ island,  _Fulton's_ invention, will long be retained after those whose names were  given to distinguish these things, have slept with their fathers and  been forgotten. Blannerhassett's Island, long since ceased to be his  property or tranquil possession, by confiscation; but it will retain its  specific name, till the inundations of the Ohio's waters shall have  washed it away and left not a wreck behind.    The distinctions I have made in the positions of nouns, will be clearly  understood when we come to the verbs. A few remarks upon pronouns will  close the present lecture.      PRONOUNS.    Pronouns are such as the word indicates. _Pro_ is the latin word _for_;  pro-nomen, _for nouns_. They are words, originally nouns, used  specifically _for_ other nouns, to avoid the too frequent repetition of  the same words; as, Washington was the father of his country; _he_ was a  valiant officer. _We_ ought to respect _him_. The word _we_, stands for  the speaker and all present, and saves the trouble of naming them; _he_  and _him_, stand for Washington, to avoid the monotony which would be  produced by a recurrence of his name.    Pronouns are all of one kind, and few in number. I will give you a list  of them in their respective positions.                            _Agents._      _Objects._              { 1st person,  I,             me,              { 2d    \"      thou,          thee,  _Singular_  { 3d    \"  mas. { he,         him,              {       \"  fem. { she,        her,              {              it,            it.                { 1st person,  we,            us,   _Plural_   { 2d    \"      ye, or you,    you,              { 3d    \"      they,          them,                             who,           whom.    The two last may be used in either person, number, or gender.    The frequent use of these words render them very important, in the  elegant and rapid use of language. They are so short, and their sound so  soft and easy, that the frequency of their recurrence does not mar the  beauty of a sentence, but saves us from the redundancy of other words.  They are substituted only when there is little danger of mistaking the  nouns for which they stand. They are, however, sometimes used in a very  broad sense; as, \"_they say_ it is so;\" meaning no particular persons,  but the general sentiment. _It_ frequently takes the lead of a sentence,  and the thing represented by it comes after; as, \"It is currently  reported, that things were thus and so.\" Here _it_ represents the single  idea which is afterward stated at length. \"_It_ is so.\" \"_It_ may be  that the nations will be destroyed by wars, earthquakes, and famines.\"  But more of this when we come to speak of the composition of sentences.    The words now classed as pronouns were originally _names_ of things, but  in this character they have long been obsolete. They are now used only  in their secondary character as the representatives of other words. The  word _he_, for instance, signified originally _to breathe_. It was  applied to the living beings who inhaled air. It occurs with little  change in the various languages of Europe, ancient and modern, till at  length it is applied to the male agent which lives and acts. The word  _her_ means _light_, but is specifically applied to females which are  the objects of action.    Was it in accordance with the design of these lectures, it would give me  pleasure to go into a minute examination of the origin, changes and  meaning of these words till they came to be applied as specific words of  exceeding limited character. Most of them might be traced thro all the  languages of Europe; the Arabic, Persic, Arminian, Chaldean, Hebrew,  and, for ought I know, all the languages of Asia. But as they are now  admitted a peculiar position in the expression of thought from which  they never vary; and as we are contending about philosophic principles  rather than verbal criticisms, I shall forbear a further consideration  of these words.    In the proper place I shall consider those words formerly called  \"Adjective Pronouns,\" \"Pronoun Adjectives,\" or \"Pronominal Adjectives,\"  to suit the varying whims of those grammar makers, who desired to show  off a speck of improvement in their \"simplifying\" works without ever  having a new idea to express. It is a query in some minds whether the  seventy-two \"simplifiers\" and \"improvers\" of Murray's grammar ever had  any distinct notions in their heads which they did not obtain from the  very man, who, it would seem by their conduct, was unable to explain his  own meaning.
