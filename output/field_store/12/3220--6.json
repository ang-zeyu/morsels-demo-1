Therefore to believe is by no means  meritorious.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (Heb. 11:33) that the saints \"by  faith . . . obtained promises,\" which would not be the case if they  did not merit by believing. Therefore to believe is meritorious.    _I answer that,_ As stated above (I-II, Q. 114, AA. 3, 4), our  actions are meritorious in so far as they proceed from the free-will  moved with grace by God. Therefore every human act proceeding from  the free-will, if it be referred to God, can be meritorious. Now the  act of believing is an act of the intellect assenting to the Divine  truth at the command of the will moved by the grace of God, so that  it is subject to the free-will in relation to God; and consequently  the act of faith can be meritorious.    Reply Obj. 1: Nature is compared to charity which is the principle of  merit, as matter to form: whereas faith is compared to charity as the  disposition which precedes the ultimate form. Now it is evident that  the subject or the matter cannot act save by virtue of the form, nor  can a preceding disposition, before the advent of the form: but after  the advent of the form, both the subject and the preceding  disposition act by virtue of the form, which is the chief principle  of action, even as the heat of fire acts by virtue of the substantial  form of fire. Accordingly neither nature nor faith can, without  charity, produce a meritorious act; but, when accompanied by charity,  the act of faith is made meritorious thereby, even as an act of  nature, and a natural act of the free-will.    Reply Obj. 2: Two things may be considered in science: namely the  scientist's assent to a scientific fact and his consideration of that  fact. Now the assent of science is not subject to free-will, because  the scientist is obliged to assent by force of the demonstration,  wherefore scientific assent is not meritorious. But the actual  consideration of what a man knows scientifically is subject to his  free-will, for it is in his power to consider or not to consider.  Hence scientific consideration may be meritorious if it be referred  to the end of charity, i.e. to the honor of God or the good of our  neighbor. On the other hand, in the case of faith, both these things  are subject to the free-will so that in both respects the act of  faith can be meritorious: whereas in the case of opinion, there is no  firm assent, since it is weak and infirm, as the Philosopher observes  (Poster. i, 33), so that it does not seem to proceed from a perfect  act of the will: and for this reason, as regards the assent, it does  not appear to be very meritorious, though it can be as regards the  actual consideration.    Reply Obj. 3: The believer has sufficient motive for believing, for  he is moved by the authority of Divine teaching confirmed by  miracles, and, what is more, by the inward instinct of the Divine  invitation: hence he does not believe lightly. He has not, however,  sufficient reason for scientific knowledge, hence he does not lose  the merit.  _______________________    TENTH ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 2, Art. 10]    Whether Reasons in Support of What We Believe Lessen the Merit of  Faith?    Objection 1: It would seem that reasons in support of what we believe  lessen the merit of faith. For Gregory says (Hom. xxvi in Evang.)  that \"there is no merit in believing what is shown by reason.\" If,  therefore, human reason provides sufficient proof, the merit of faith  is altogether taken away. Therefore it seems that any kind of human  reasoning in support of matters of faith, diminishes the merit of  believing.    Obj. 2: Further, whatever lessens the measure of virtue, lessens  the amount of merit, since \"happiness is the reward of virtue,\" as  the Philosopher states (Ethic. i, 9). Now human reasoning seems to  diminish the measure of the virtue of faith, since it is essential  to faith to be about the unseen, as stated above (Q. 1, AA. 4, 5).  Now the more a thing is supported by reasons the less is it unseen.  Therefore human reasons in support of matters of faith diminish the  merit of faith.    Obj. 3: Further, contrary things have contrary causes. Now an  inducement in opposition to faith increases the merit of faith whether  it consist in persecution inflicted by one who endeavors to force a  man to renounce his faith, or in an argument persuading him to do so.  Therefore reasons in support of faith diminish the merit of faith.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (1 Pet. 3:15): \"Being ready always to  satisfy every one that asketh you a reason of that faith [*Vulg.: 'Of  that hope which is in you.' St. Thomas' reading is apparently taken  from Bede.] and hope which is in you.\" Now the Apostle would not give  this advice, if it would imply a diminution in the merit of faith.  Therefore reason does not diminish the merit of faith.    _I answer that,_ As stated above (A. 9), the act of faith can be  meritorious, in so far as it is subject to the will, not only as to  the use, but also as to the assent. Now human reason in support of  what we believe, may stand in a twofold relation to the will of the  believer. First, as preceding the act of the will; as, for instance,  when a man either has not the will, or not a prompt will, to believe,  unless he be moved by human reasons: and in this way human reason  diminishes the merit of faith. In this sense it has been said above  (I-II, Q. 24, A. 3, ad 1; Q. 77, A. 6, ad 2) that, in moral virtues,  a passion which precedes choice makes the virtuous act less  praiseworthy. For just as a man ought to perform acts of moral  virtue, on account of the judgment of his reason, and not on account  of a passion, so ought he to believe matters of faith, not on account  of human reason, but on account of the Divine authority. Secondly,  human reasons may be consequent to the will of the believer. For when  a man's will is ready to believe, he loves the truth he believes, he  thinks out and takes to heart whatever reasons he can find in support  thereof; and in this way human reason does not exclude the merit of  faith but is a sign of greater merit. Thus again, in moral virtues a  consequent passion is the sign of a more prompt will, as stated above  (I-II, Q. 24, A. 3, ad 1). We have an indication of this in the words  of the Samaritans to the woman, who is a type of human reason: \"We  now believe, not for thy saying\" (John 4:42).    Reply Obj. 1: Gregory is referring to the case of a man who has no  will to believe what is of faith, unless he be induced by reasons.  But when a man has the will to believe what is of faith on the  authority of God alone, although he may have reasons in demonstration  of some of them, e.g. of the existence of God, the merit of his faith  is not, for that reason, lost or diminished.    Reply Obj. 2: The reasons which are brought forward in support of  the authority of faith, are not demonstrations which can bring  intellectual vision to the human intellect, wherefore they do not  cease to be unseen. But they remove obstacles to faith, by showing  that what faith proposes is not impossible; wherefore such reasons do  not diminish the merit or the measure of faith. On the other hand,  though demonstrative reasons in support of the preambles of faith  [*The Leonine Edition reads: 'in support of matters of faith which  are however, preambles to the articles of faith, diminish,' etc.],  but not of the articles of faith, diminish the measure of faith,  since they make the thing believed to be seen, yet they do not  diminish the measure of charity, which makes the will ready to  believe them, even if they were unseen; and so the measure of merit  is not diminished.    Reply Obj. 3: Whatever is in opposition to faith, whether it consist  in a man's thoughts, or in outward persecution, increases the merit  of faith, in so far as the will is shown to be more prompt and firm  in believing. Hence the martyrs had more merit of faith, through not  renouncing faith on account of persecution; and even the wise have  greater merit of faith, through not renouncing their faith on account  of the reasons brought forward by philosophers or heretics in  opposition to faith. On the other hand things that are favorable to  faith, do not always diminish the promptness of the will to believe,  and therefore they do not always diminish the merit of faith.  _______________________    QUESTION 3    OF THE OUTWARD ACT OF FAITH  (In Two Articles)    We must now consider the outward act, viz. the confession of faith:  under which head there are two points of inquiry:    (1) Whether confession is an act of faith?    (2) Whether confession of faith is necessary for salvation?  _______________________    FIRST ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 3, Art. 1]    Whether Confession Is an Act of Faith?    Objection 1: It would seem that confession is not an act of faith.  For the same act does not belong to different virtues. Now confession  belongs to penance of which it is a part. Therefore it is not an act  of faith.    Obj. 2: Further, man is sometimes deterred by fear or some kind of  confusion, from confessing his faith: wherefore the Apostle (Eph.  6:19) asks for prayers that it may be granted him \"with confidence,  to make known the mystery of the gospel.\" Now it belongs to  fortitude, which moderates daring and fear, not to be deterred from  doing good on account of confusion or fear. Therefore it seems that  confession is not an act of faith, but rather of fortitude or  constancy.    Obj. 3: Further, just as the ardor of faith makes one confess one's  faith outwardly, so does it make one do other external good works,  for it is written (Gal. 5:6) that \"faith . . . worketh by charity.\"  But"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18757"],[0,"Prince Henry the Navigator, the Hero of Portugal and of Modern Discovery, (#11)"],[1,"a cliff.\" Its  embankments, its canals, and even its crocodiles, \"not so large as  ravenous,\" are all described, and Arculf, returning home by  Constantinople, concludes with an account of the capital of Christendom,  \"beyond doubt the metropolis of the Roman Empire, and by far the  greatest city therein\"; lastly, as the pilgrim sails by Sicily he sees  the \"isle of Vulcan vomiting smoke by day and flame by night, with a  noise like thunder, which is always fiercer on Fridays and Saturdays.\"    Willibald, a nephew of St. Boniface and related through his mother to  King Ina of Wessex, started for the East about 721, passed ten years in  travel, and on his return followed his countrymen to mission work and to  death among the heathen of Upper Germany. He went out by Southampton and  Rouen, by Lucca and the Alps, to Naples and Catania, \"where is Mount  Etna; and when this volcano casts itself out they take St. Agatha's veil  and hold it towards the fire, which ceases at once.\" Thence by Samos and  Cyprus to Antaradus and Emesda, \"in the region of the Saracens,\" where  the whole party, who had escaped the Moslem brigands of Southern Gaul,  were thrown into prison on suspicion of being spies. A Spaniard made  intercession for them and got their release; but Willibald went up  country one hundred miles, and cleared himself of all suspicion before  the Caliph at Damascus. \"We have come from the West, where the sun has  his setting, and we know of no land beyond--nothing but water.\" This was  too far for spies, he pleaded, and the Caliph agreed, and gave him a  pass for all the sites of Palestine, with which he traversed the length  and breadth of the Holy Land four times, finding the same trouble in  leaving as he had found in entering. Like Arculf, he saw the fountains  of Jor-Dan, the \"glorious church\" of Helena at Bethlehem, the tombs of  the Patriarchs at Hebron, the wonders of Jerusalem. Especially was he  moved at the sight of the columns in the Church of the Ascension on  Olivet, \"for that man who can creep between those columns and the wall  is freed from all his sins.\" Tyre and Sidon he passed again and again  \"on the coast of the Adriatic Sea (as he calls the Levant), _six_ miles  from one another\"; at last he got away to Constantinople, with some  safely smuggled trophies of pilgrimage, and some \"balsam in a calabash,  covered with petroleum,\" but the customs officers would have killed all  of them if the fraud had been found out--so Willibald believed. After  two years of close intercourse with the Greek Christians of New Rome,  living in a \"cell hollowed out of the side of a church\" (possibly Saint  Sophia), the first of English-born travellers returned to Old Rome, as  Arculf had done, by sea, noticing, like him, \"Theodoric's Hell\" in the  Liparis. He could not get up the mountain, though curious to see \"what  sort of a hell it was\" where the Gothic \"Tyrant\" was damned for the  murder of Boeethius and Symmachus, and for his own impenitent Arianism.  But though he could not be seen or heard, all the pilgrims remarked how  the \"pumice that writers use was thrown up by the flame from the hell,  and fell into the sea, and so was cast upon the shore and gathered up.\"    Such was the philosophy of Catholicism about the countries of the known  world in the eighth century, for Willibald's account was published with  the imprimatur of Gregory III., and, with Arculf's, took rank as a  satisfactory comment on the old Bordeaux Itinerary of four hundred years  ago.    Again, the impression given by our two chief Guide-Books, Arculf and  Willibald, is confirmed by the monk Fidelis, who travelled in Egypt  about 750, and by Bernard the Wise of Mont St. Michel, who went over all  the pilgrim ground a century later (867). Fidelis, sailing up the Nile,  was astonished at the sight of the \"Seven Barns of Joseph, (the  Pyramids) looking like mountains, but all of stone, square at the base,  rounded in the upper part and twisted at the summit like a spire. On  measuring a side of one of them, it was found to be four hundred feet.\"  From the Nile Fidelis sailed by the freshwater canal of Necho, Hadrian,  and Amrou, not finally blocked up till 767, direct to the Red Sea, \"near  where Moses crossed with the Israelites.\" The pilgrim wanted to go and  look for Pharaoh's chariot-wheels, but the sailors were obstinate, and  took him round the Peninsula of Sinai, down one arm of the sea and up  another, to Eziongeber and Edom.    Bernard, \"the French Monk\" of Mont St. Michel, took the straight route  overland by Rome to Bari, then a Saracen city, whose Emir forwarded the  pilgrims in a fleet of transports carrying some nine thousand Christian  slaves to Alexandria. Here, like Willibald, Bernard found himself  \"suspect\"--thrown into prison till Backsheesh had been paid, then only  allowed to move stage by stage as fees were prompt and sufficient, for a  traveller must pay, as an infidel, not only the ordinary tribute of the  subject Christians of Egypt, but the \"money of the road\" as well. Islam  has always made of strangers a fair mark for extortion.    Safe at last in Jerusalem, the party (Bernard himself and two friends,  one a Spaniard, the other a monk of Beneventum) were lodged \"in the  Hostel of the glorious Emperor Charles, founded for all the pilgrims who  speak the Roman tongue,\" and after making the ordinary visits of  devotion, and giving us their account of the Easter Miracle of the Holy  Fire at the Church of the Sepulchre, they took ship for Italy, and  landed at Rome after sixty days of misery at sea.    Bernard's account closes with the Roman churches--the Lateran, where the  \"keys of the whole city are given every night into the hands of the  Apostolic Pope,\" and St. Peter's on the \"West side of Rome, that for  size has no rival in the world.\"    At the same time, or a little earlier than the Breton traveller (_c._  808-850), another Latin had written a short tract _On the Houses of God  in Jerusalem_, which, with Bernard's note-book, is our last geographical  record before the age of the Northmen.    A new time was coming--a time not of timid creeping pilgrims only, but  of sea-kings and seamen, who made the ocean their home, and, for the  North of Europe at least, broke the tradition of land journeys and  coasting voyages.    But the early pilgrims after all have their place. It is of no use  insisting that the mental outlook of these men is infantile;--that is  best proved by their own words, their own scale of things; but it is  necessary to insist that in these travellers we have comparatively  enlarged experience and knowledge; and as comparison is the only test of  any age, or of any man therein, the very blunders and limitations of the  past, as we see them to be, have a constant, as well as an historical,  value to us. That is, we are always being reminded, first, how we have  come to the present mastery over nature, over ourselves, over all being;  and, secondly, how imperfect, how futile, our work is still, and seems  always doomed to be, if judged from a really final standpoint, or rather  from our own dreams of the ultimately possible.    So if in the case of our mediaeval travellers their interests are the  very reverse of ours; if they take delight in brooding over thoughts  which to us do not seem worth the thinking; if their minds seem to rest  as much on fable implicitly accepted as on the little amount of  experienced fact necessary for a working life, it will not be for us to  judge, or to pity, or to despise the men who were making our world for  us, and through whose work we live.    [Illustration: THE MAPPE-MONDE OF ST. SEVER. (SEE LIST OF MAPS)]    Especially we cannot afford to forget this as we reach the lowest point  of the fortunes, the mental and material work and position and  outlook, of Europe and Christendom. A half-barbarised world had entered  upon the inheritance of a splendid past, but it took centuries before  that inheritance was realised by the so altered present. In this time of  change we have men writing in the language of Caesar and Augustine, of  Alexander and Plato and Aristotle, who had been themselves, or whose  fathers had been, pirates, brigands, nomades,--\"wolves of the land or of  the sea\"--to Greeks or Romans of the South; who had been even to the  Romanised provincials of the North, as in Britain, mere \"dogs,\" \"whelps  from the kennel of barbarism,\" the destroyers of the order of the world.  The boundless credulity and servile terror, the superstition and feudal  tyranny of the earlier Middle Ages, mark the first stage of the  reconstruction of society, when savage strong men who had conquered were  set down beside the overworked and outworn masters of the Western world,  to learn of them, and to make of them a more enduring race.          CHAPTER II.    VIKINGS OR NORTHMEN.    CIRCA 787-1066.      The discoveries and conquests and colonies of the Norse Vikings, from  the White Sea to North America, are the first glimpses of light on the  sea of darkness round the little island of the known world that made up  Christendom. And from the needs of the time these were the natural, the  only natural beginnings of European expansion. From the rise of Islam,  Saracens controlled the great trade-routes of the South and East. It was  only on the West and North that the coast was clear--of all but natural  dangers.    In the Moslem Caliphate men were now busy in following up the old lines  of trade, the immemorial traditions of the East, or as in southern  Africa, extending the sphere of commercial activity and so of  civilisation; men of science were commenting on the ancient texts of  Greeks and Latins, or adapting them to enlarged knowledge.    But in Christendom, in the atrophy both of mental and physical  activity, broken for short periods and in certain lands by the revivals  of Charles the Great, of the Isaurian Emperors, of Otto I., of Alfred  and his House,"]]]
