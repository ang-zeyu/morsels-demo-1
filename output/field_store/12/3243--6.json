[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19164"],[0,"Lectures on Art, Delivered Before the University of Oxford in Hilary Term, 1870 (#11)"],[1,"art?\" Then it is a right feeling. Could it not be sung at  all, or only sung ludicrously? It is a base one. And that is so in all  the arts; so that with mathematical precision, subject to no error or  exception, the art of a nation, so far as it exists, is an exponent of  its ethical state.      68. An exponent, observe, and exalting influence; but not the root or  cause. You cannot paint or sing yourselves into being good men; you must  be good men before you can either paint or sing, and then the colour and  sound will complete in you all that is best.    And this it was that I called upon you to hear, saying, \"listen to me at  least now,\" in the first lecture, namely, that no art-teaching could be  of use to you, but would rather be harmful, unless it was grafted on  something deeper than all art. For indeed not only with this, of which  it is my function to show you the laws, but much more with the art of  all men, which you came here chiefly to learn, that of language, the  chief vices of education have arisen from the one great fallacy of  supposing that noble language is a communicable trick of grammar and  accent, instead of simply the careful expression of right thought. All  the virtues of language are, in their roots, moral; it becomes accurate  if the speaker desires to be true; clear, if he speaks with sympathy and  a desire to be intelligible; powerful, if he has earnestness; pleasant,  if he has sense of rhythm and order. There are no other virtues of  language producible by art than these: but let me mark more deeply for  an instant the significance of one of them. Language, I said, is only  clear when it is sympathetic. You can, in truth, understand a man's word  only by understanding his temper. Your own word is also as of an unknown  tongue to him unless he understands yours. And it is this which makes  the art of language, if any one is to be chosen separately from the  rest, that which is fittest for the instrument of a gentleman's  education. To teach the meaning of a word thoroughly, is to teach the  nature of the spirit that coined it; the secret of language is the  secret of sympathy, and its full charm is possible only to the gentle.  And thus the principles of beautiful speech have all been fixed by  sincere and kindly speech. On the laws which have been determined by  sincerity, false speech, apparently beautiful, may afterwards be  constructed; but all such utterance, whether in oration or poetry, is  not only without permanent power, but it is destructive of the  principles it has usurped. So long as no words are uttered but in  faithfulness, so long the art of language goes on exalting itself; but  the moment it is shaped and chiselled on external principles, it falls  into frivolity, and perishes. And this truth would have been long ago  manifest, had it not been that in periods of advanced academical science  there is always a tendency to deny the sincerity of the first masters of  language. Once learn to write gracefully in the manner of an ancient  author, and we are apt to think that he also wrote in the manner of some  one else. But no noble nor right style was ever yet founded but out of a  sincere heart.    No man is worth reading to form your style, who does not mean what he  says; nor was any great style ever invented but by some man who meant  what he said. Find out the beginner of a great manner of writing, and  you have also found the declarer of some true facts or sincere passions:  and your whole method of reading will thus be quickened, for, being sure  that your author really meant what he said, you will be much more  careful to ascertain what it is that he means.      69. And of yet greater importance is it deeply to know that every beauty  possessed by the language of a nation is significant of the innermost  laws of its being. Keep the temper of the people stern and manly; make  their associations grave, courteous, and for worthy objects; occupy them  in just deeds; and their tongue must needs be a grand one. Nor is it  possible, therefore--observe the necessary reflected action--that any  tongue should be a noble one, of which the words are not so many  trumpet-calls to action. All great languages invariably utter great  things, and command them; they cannot be mimicked but by obedience; the  breath of them is inspiration because it is not only vocal, but vital;  and you can only learn to speak as these men spoke, by becoming what  these men were.      70. Now for direct confirmation of this, I want you to think over the  relation of expression to character in two great masters of the absolute  art of language, Virgil and Pope. You are perhaps surprised at the last  name; and indeed you have in English much higher grasp and melody of  language from more passionate minds, but you have nothing else, in its  range, so perfect. I name, therefore, these two men, because they are  the two most accomplished _Artists_, merely as such, whom I know in  literature; and because I think you will be afterwards interested in  investigating how the infinite grace in the words of the one, and the  severity in those of the other, and the precision in those of both,  arise wholly out of the moral elements of their minds:--out of the deep  tenderness in Virgil which enabled him to write the stories of Nisus and  Lausus; and the serene and just benevolence which placed Pope, in his  theology, two centuries in advance of his time, and enabled him to sum  the law of noble life in two lines which, so far as I know, are the most  complete, the most concise, and the most lofty expression of moral  temper existing in English words:--        _\"Never elated, while one man's oppress'd;_      _Never dejected, while another's bless'd.\"_    I wish you also to remember these lines of Pope, and to make yourselves  entirely masters of his system of ethics; because, putting Shakespeare  aside as rather the world's than ours, I hold Pope to be the most  perfect representative we have, since Chaucer, of the true English mind;  and I think the Dunciad is the most absolutely chiselled and monumental  work \"exacted\" in our country. You will find, as you study Pope, that  he has expressed for you, in the strictest language and within the  briefest limits, every law of art, of criticism, of economy, of policy,  and, finally, of a benevolence, humble, rational, and resigned,  contented with its allotted share of life, and trusting the problem of  its salvation to Him in whose hand lies that of the universe.      71. And now I pass to the arts with which I have special concern, in  which, though the facts are exactly the same, I shall have more  difficulty in proving my assertion, because very few of us are as  cognizant of the merit of painting as we are of that of language; and I  can only show you whence that merit springs, after having thoroughly  shown you in what it consists. But, in the meantime, I have simply to  tell you, that the manual arts are as accurate exponents of ethical  state, as other modes of expression; first, with absolute precision, of  that of the workman; and then with precision, disguised by many  distorting influences, of that of the nation to which it belongs.    And, first, they are a perfect exponent of the mind of the workman: but,  being so, remember, if the mind be great or complex, the art is not an  easy book to read; for we must ourselves possess all the mental  characters of which we are to read the signs. No man can read the  evidence of labour who is not himself laborious, for he does not know  what the work cost: nor can he read the evidence of true passion if he  is not passionate; nor of gentleness if he is not gentle: and the most  subtle signs of fault and weakness of character he can only judge by  having had the same faults to fight with. I myself, for instance, know  impatient work, and tired work, better than most critics, because I am  myself always impatient, and often tired:--so also, the patient and  indefatigable touch of a mighty master becomes more wonderful to me than  to others. Yet, wonderful in no mean measure it will be to you all, when  I make it manifest,--and as soon as we begin our real work, and you have  learned what it is to draw a true line, I shall be able to make manifest  to you,--and indisputably so,--that the day's work of a man like  Mantegna or Paul Veronese consists of an unfaltering, uninterrupted  succession of movements of the hand more precise than those of the  finest fencer: the pencil leaving one point and arriving at another, not  only with unerring precision at the extremity of the line, but with an  unerring and yet varied course--sometimes over spaces a foot or more in  extent--yet a course so determined everywhere, that either of these men  could, and Veronese often does, draw a finished profile, or any other  portion of the contour of the face, with one line, not afterwards  changed. Try, first, to realise to yourselves the muscular precision of  that action, and the intellectual strain of it; for the movement of a  fencer is perfect in practised monotony; but the movement of the hand of  a great painter is at every instant governed by a direct and new  intention. Then imagine that muscular firmness and subtlety, and the  instantaneously selective and ordinant energy of the brain, sustained  all day long, not only without fatigue, but with a visible joy in the  exertion, like that which an eagle seems to take in the wave of his  wings; and this all life long, and through long life, not only without  failure of power, but with visible increase of it, until the actually  organic changes of old age. And then consider, so far as you know  anything of physiology, what sort of an ethical state of body and mind  that means! ethic through ages past! what fineness of race there must be  to get it, what exquisite balance and symmetry of the vital powers!

She yawned, looked at her watch again, found that she had spent exactly  six minutes in meditating upon her immediate surroundings, and fell to  wondering why it was that the real West was so terribly commonplace.  Why, yesterday she had been brought to such a pass of sheer loneliness  that she had actually been driven to reading an old horse-doctor book!  She had learned the symptoms of epizooetic--whatever that was--and  poll-evil and stringhalt, and had gone from that to making a shopping  tour through a Montgomery Ward catalogue. There was nothing else in the  house to read, except a half dozen old copies of the _Boise News_.    There was nothing to do, nothing to see, no one to talk to. Her dad and  the big, heavy-set man whom he called Frank, seemed uncomfortably aware  of their deficiencies and were pitiably anxious to make her feel  welcome,--and failed. They called her \"Raine.\" The other two men did not  call her anything at all. They were both sandy-complexioned and they  both chewed tobacco quite noticeably, and when they sat down in their  shirt sleeves to eat, Lorraine had seen irregular humps in their hip  pockets which must be six-guns; though why they should carry them in  their pockets instead of in holster belts buckled properly around their  bodies and sagging savagely down at one side and swinging ferociously  when they walked, Lorraine could not imagine. They did not wear chaps,  either, and their spurs were just spurs, without so much as a silver  concho anywhere. Cowboys in overalls and blue gingham shirts and faded  old coats whose lapels lay in wrinkles and whose pockets were torn down  at the corners! If Lorraine had not been positive that this was actually  a cattle ranch in Idaho, she never would have believed that they were  anything but day laborers.    \"It's a comedy part for the cattle-queen's daughter,\" she admitted,  putting out a hand to stroke the lean, gray cat that jumped upon her bed  from the open window. \"Ket, it's a _scream_! I'll take my West before  the camera, thank you; or I would, if I hadn't jumped right into the  middle of this trick West before I knew what I was doing. Ket, what do  you do to pass away the time? I don't see how you can have the nerve to  live in an empty space like this and purr!\"    She got up then, looked into the kitchen and saw the paper on the table.  This was new and vaguely promised some sort of break in the deadly  monotony which she saw stretching endlessly before her. Carrying the  nameless cat in her arms, Lorraine went in her bare feet across the  grimy, bare floor to the table and picked up the note. It read simply:         \"Your brekfast is in the oven we wont be back till dark maby. Don't       leave the ranch today. Yr loveing father.\"    Lorraine hugged the cat so violently that she choked off a purr in the  middle. \"'Don't leave the ranch to-day!' Ket, I believe it's going to be  dangerous or something, after all.\"    She dressed quickly and went outside into the sunlight, the cat at her  heels, the thrill of that one command filling the gray monotone of the  hills with wonderful possibilities of adventure. Her father had made no  objection before when she went for a ride. He had merely instructed her  to keep to the trails, and if she didn't know the way home, to let the  reins lie loose on Yellowjacket's neck and he would bring her to the  gate.    Yellowjacket's instinct for direction had not been working that day,  however. Lorraine had no sooner left the ranch out of sight behind her  than she pretended that she was lost. Yellowjacket had thereupon walked  a few rods farther and stopped, patiently indifferent to the location of  his oats box. Lorraine had waited until his head began to droop lower  and lower, and his switching at flies had become purely automatic.  Yellowjacket was going to sleep without making any effort to find the  way home. But since Lorraine had not told her father anything about it,  his injunction could not have anything to do with the unreliability of  the horse.    \"Now,\" she said to the cat, \"if three or four bandits would appear on  the ridge, over there, and come tearing down into the immediate  foreground, jump the gate and surround the house, I'd know this was the  real thing. They'd want to make me tell where dad kept his gold or  whatever it was they wanted, and they'd have me tied to a chair--and  then, cut to Lone Morgan (that's a perfectly _wonderful_ name for the  lead!) hearing shots and coming on a dead run to the rescue.\" She  picked up the cat and walked slowly down the hard-trodden path to the  stable. \"But there aren't any bandits, and dad hasn't any gold or  anything else worth stealing--Ket, if dad isn't a miser, he's _poor_!  And Lone Morgan is merely ashamed of the way I talked to him, and afraid  I'll queer myself with the neighbors. No Western lead that _I_ ever saw  would act like that. Why, he didn't even want to ride home with me, that  day.    \"And Bob Warfield and his Ford are incidents of the past, and not one  soul at the Sawtooth seems to give a darn whether I'm in the country or  out of it. Soon as they found out where I belonged, they brought me over  here and dropped me and forgot all about me. And that, I suppose, is  what they call in fiction the Western spirit!    \"Dad looked exactly as if he'd opened the door to a book agent when I  came. He--he _tolerates_ my presence, Ket! And Frank Johnson's pipe  smells to high heaven, and I hate him in the house and 'the boys'--hmhm!  The _boys_--Ket, it would be terribly funny, if I didn't have to stay  here.\"    She had reached the corral and stood balancing the cat on a warped top  rail, staring disconsolately at Yellowjacket, who stood in a far corner  switching at flies and shamelessly displaying all the angularity of his  bones under a yellowish hide with roughened hair that was shedding  dreadfully, as Lorraine had discovered to her dismay when she removed  her green corduroy skirt after riding him. Yellowjacket's lower lip  sagged with senility or lack of spirit, Lorraine could not tell which.    \"You look like the frontispiece in that horse-doctor book,\" she  remarked, eyeing him with disfavor. \"I can't say that comedy hide you've  got improves your appearance. You'd be better peeled, I believe.\"    She heard a chuckle behind her and turned quickly, palm up to shield her  eyes from the straight, bright rays of the sun. Now here was a live man,  after all, with his hat tilted down over his forehead, a cigarette in  one hand and his reins in the other, looking at her and smiling.    \"Why don't you peel him, just on a chance?\" His smile broadened to a  grin, but when Lorraine continued to look at him with a neutral  expression in her eyes, he threw away his cigarette and abandoned with  it his free-and-easy manner.    \"You're Miss Hunter, aren't you? I rode over to see your father. Thought  I'd find him somewhere around the corral, maybe.\"    \"You won't, because he's gone for the day. No, I don't know where.\"    \"I--see. Is Mr. Johnson anywhere about?\"    \"No, I don't believe any one is anywhere about. They were all gone when  I got up, a little while ago.\" Then, remembering that she did not know  this man, and that she was a long way from neighbors, she added, \"If  you'll leave a message I can tell dad when he comes home.\"    \"No-o--I'll ride over to-morrow or next day. I'm the man at Whisper. You  can tell him I called, and that I'll call again.\"    Still he did not go, and Lorraine waited. Some instinct warned her that  the man had not yet stated his real reason for coming, and she wondered  a little what it could be. He seemed to be watching her covertly, yet  she failed to catch any telltale admiration for her in his scrutiny. She  decided that his forehead was too narrow to please her, and that his  eyes were too close together, and that the lines around his mouth were  cruel lines and gave the lie to his smile, which was pleasant enough if  you just looked at the smile and paid no attention to anything else in  his face.    \"You had quite an experience getting out here, they tell me,\" he  observed carelessly; too carelessly, thought Lorraine, who was well  schooled in the circumlocutions of delinquent tenants, agents of various  sorts and those who crave small gossip of their neighbors. \"Heard you  were lost up in Rock City all night.\"    Lorraine looked up at him, startled. \"I caught a terrible cold,\" she  said, laughing nervously. \"I'm not used to the climate,\" she added  guardedly.    The man fumbled in his pocket and produced smoking material. \"Do you  mind if I smoke?\" he asked perfunctorily.    \"Why, no. It doesn't concern me in the slightest degree.\" Why, she  thought confusedly, must she _always_ be reminded of that horrible place  of rocks? What was it to this man where she had been lost?    \"You must of got there about the time the storm broke,\" the man hazarded  after a silence. \"It's sure a bad place in a thunderstorm. Them rocks  draw lightning. Pretty bad, wasn't it?\"    \"Lightning is always bad, isn't it?\" Lorraine tried to hold her voice  steady. \"I don't know much about it. We don't have thunderstorms to  amount to anything, in Los Angeles. It sometimes does thunder there in  the winter, but it is very mild.\"    With hands that trembled she picked the cat off the rail and started  toward the house. \"I'll tell dad what you said,\" she told him, glancing  back over her shoulder. When she saw that he had turned his horse and  was frankly following her to the house, her heart jumped wildly into her  throat,--judging by the feel of it.    \"I'm plumb out of matches. I wonder if you can let me have some,\" he  said, still speaking too carelessly to reassure her. \"So you stuck it  out in Rock City all through that storm! That's more than what I'd want  to do.\"    She did "]]]
