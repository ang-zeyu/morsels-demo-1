The Porte supported  Ismail Bey, who retained the post of Governor of the Metropolis (Sheikh  el-Beled) until the terrible plague of 1790, in which he perished.    His former rivals, Ibrahim and Murad, now returned; and eight years  later were still in the leadership when the news was brought to Egypt  that a fleet carrying thirty thousand men, under Bonaparte, had arrived  at Alexandria on an expedition of conquest.    [Illustration: 080.jpg]      [Illustration: 081.jpg PAGE IMAGE]          CHAPTER II.--THE FRENCH IN EGYPT      _Napoleon's campaign: Battles of the Pyramids and of Abukir: Siege of  Acre: Kleber's administration: The evacuation of Egypt._      At the close of the eighteenth century Egypt's destiny passed into the  hands of the French. Napoleon's descent upon Egypt was part of his  vast strategic plan for the overthrow of Great Britain. He first of all  notified the Directory of this design in September, 1797, in a letter  sent from Italy. Late in the same year and during 1798 vast preparations  had been in progress for the invasion of England. Napoleon then visited  all the seaports in the north of France and Holland, and found that a  direct invasion of England was a practical impossibility because the  British held command over the sea. The suggested invasion of Egypt was  now seriously considered. By the conquest of Egypt, it was contended,  England would be cut off from the possession of India, and France,  through Egypt, would dominate the trade to the Orient. From Egypt  Napoleon could gather an army of Orientals and conquer the whole of the  East, including India itself. On his return, England would prove to be  too exhausted to withstand the French army at home and would fall a  prey to the ambitions of the First Consul. The Directory assented to  Bonaparte's plans the more readily because they were anxious to keep  so popular a leader, the idol of the army, at a great distance from the  centre of government. While the preparations were in process, no one  in England knew of this undertaking. The French fleet lay in various  squadrons in ports of Italy, from which thirty thousand men were  embarked.    Bonaparte arrived at Toulon on May 9, 1798. His presence rejoiced the  army, which had begun to murmur and to fear that he would not be at the  head of the expedition. It was the old army of Italy, rich and covered  with glory, and hence had much less zeal for making war; it required all  the enthusiasm with which the general inspired his soldiers to induce  them to embark and proceed to an unknown destination. On seeing him at  Toulon, they were inflamed with ardour. Bonaparte, without acquainting  them with their destination, exhorted the soldiers, telling them that  they had great destinies to fulfil, and that \"the genius of liberty,  which had made the republic from her birth the arbitress of Europe,  decreed that she should be so to the most remote seas and nations.\"    [Illustration: 083 BEDOUINS IN THE DESERT]    The squadron of Admiral Brueys consisted of thirteen sail of the line,  and carried about forty thousand men of all arms and ten thousand  seamen. It had water for one month and provisions for two. It sailed on  the 19th of May, amid the thunders of the cannons and the cheers of the  whole army. Violent gales did some damage to a frigate on leaving the  port, and Nelson, who was cruising with three sail of the line in search  of the French fleet, suffered so severely from the same gales that he  was obliged to bear up for the islands of St. Pierre to refit. He was  thus kept at a distance from the French fleet, and did not see it pass.  It steered first towards Genoa to join the convoy collected in that  port, under the command of General Baraguay d'Hilliers. It then sailed  for Corsica, to call for the convoy at Ajaccio commanded by Vaubois, and  afterwards proceeded to the sea of Sicily to join the division of Civita  Vecchia, under the command of Desaix.    Bonaparte's intention was to stop at Malta, and there to make by the  way a bold attempt, the success of which he had long since prepared by  secret intrigues. He meant to take possession of that island, which,  commanding the navigation of the Mediterranean, became important to  Egypt and could not fail soon to fall into the hands of the English,  unless they were anticipated.    Bonaparte made great efforts to join the division from Civita Vecchia;  but this he could not accomplish until he was off Malta. The five  hundred French sail came in sight of the island on June 9th, twenty-two  days after leaving Toulon. This sight filled the city of Malta with  consternation. The following day (June 10th) the French troops landed  on the island, and completely invested Valetta, which contained a  population of nearly thirty thousand souls, and was even then one of  the strongest fortresses in Europe. The inhabitants were dismayed and  clamoured for surrender, and the grand master, who possessed little  energy, and recollected the generosity of the conqueror of Rivoli at  Mantua, hoping to save his interest from shipwreck, released one of  the French knights, whom he had thrown into prison when they refused to  fight against their countrymen, and sent him to Bonaparte to negotiate.  A treaty was soon concluded, by which the Knights of Malta gave up to  France the sovereignty of Malta and the dependent islands. Thus France  gained possession of the best harbour in the Mediterranean, and one of  the strongest in the world. It required the ascendency of Bonaparte to  obtain it without fighting; and it necessitated also the risk of losing  some precious days, with the English in pursuit of him.    The French fleet weighed anchor on the 19th of June, after a stay of  ten days. The essential point now was not to fall in with the English.  Nelson, having refitted at the islands of St. Pierre, had returned on  June 1st to Toulon, but the French squadron had been gone twelve days.  He had run from Toulon to the roads of Taglia-mon, and from the roads  of Tagliamon to Naples, where he had arrived on June 20th, at the very  moment when Bonaparte was leaving Malta. Learning that the French had  been seen off Malta, he followed, determined to attack them, if he  could overtake them. At one moment, the English squadron was only a few  leagues distant from the immense French convoy, and neither party was  aware of it. Nelson, supposing that the French were bound for Egypt,  made sail for Alexandria, and arrived there before them; at not finding  them, he flew to the Dardanelles to seek them there. By a singular fate,  it was not till two days afterwards that the French expedition came in  sight of Alexandria, on the 1st of July, which was very nearly six weeks  since it sailed from Toulon. Bonaparte immediately sent on shore for the  French consul. He learned that the English had made their appearance  two days before, and, supposing them to be not far off, he resolved that  very moment to attempt a landing. It was impossible to enter the harbour  of Alexandria, for the place appeared disposed to defend itself;  it became necessary, therefore, to land at some distance on the  neighbouring coast, at an inlet called the Creek of the Marabou. The  wind blew violently and the sea broke with fury over the reefs on the  shore. It was near the close of the day, but Bonaparte gave the signal  and resolved to go on shore immediately. He was the first to disembark,  and, with great difficulty, four or five thousand men were landed in  the course of the evening and the following night. Bonaparte resolved  to march forthwith for Alexandria, in order to surprise the place and  to prevent the Turks from making preparations for defence. The troops  instantly commenced their march. Not a horse was yet landed: the staff  of Bonaparte, and Caffarelli himself, notwithstanding his wooden leg,  had to walk four or five leagues over the sands, and came at daybreak  within sight of Alexandria.    That ancient city no longer possessed its magnificent edifices, its  innumerable houses, and its immense population. Three-fourths of it was  in ruins. The Turks, the wealthy Egyptians, the European merchants dwelt  in the modern town, which was the only part preserved. A few Arabs lived  among the ruins of the ancient city: an old wall, flanked by towers,  enclosed the new and the old town, and all around extended those sands  which in Egypt are sure to advance wherever civilisation recedes. The  four thousand French led by Bonaparte arrived there at daybreak. Upon  this sandy beach they met with Arabs only, who, after firing a few  musket-shots, fled to the desert. Napoleon divided his men into three  columns. Bon, with the first column, marched on the right towards the  Rosetta gate; Kleber, with the second, marched in the centre towards the  gate of the Catacombs.    The Arabs and the Turks, excellent soldiers behind a wall, kept up a  steady fire, but the French mounted with ladders and got over the old  wall. Kleber was the first who fell, seriously wounded on the forehead.  The Arabs were driven from ruin to ruin, as far as the new town, and  the combat seemed likely to be continued from street to street, and  to become sanguinary, when a Turkish captain served as a mediator for  negotiating an arrangement. Bonaparte declared that he had not come to  ravage the country, or to wrest it from its ruler, but merely to deliver  it from the domination of the Mamluks, and to revenge the outrages which  they had committed against France. He promised that the authorities of  the country should be upheld; that the ceremonies of religion should  continue to be performed as before; that property should be respected.  On these conditions, the resistance ceased, and the French were masters  of Alexandria. Meanwhile, the remainder of the army had landed. It  was immediately necessary to decide where to place the squadron  safely--whether in the harbour or in one of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17354"],[0,"Cave Regions of the Ozarks and Black Hills (#11)"],[1," of a rock which seems to have been built into  the wall. In front it is five feet high and nine feet across, with  artistic corners approximately alike, and at the back ornamental carving  extends upward towards the ceiling with an opening through the wall at  the center. This opening is divided by a short column down which water  trickles to supply the bowl. The ceiling here is about thirty-five feet  high and most of the exposed surface is a blue-gray limestone. Only one  portion of Gentry Cave has received a deposit of dripstone and even that  is of limited extent, and located at the end of a narrow slippery  passage between high, slippery walls.    The fine entrance is of grey limestone in undisturbed horizontal strata,  and this is so plainly marked in the roof-supporting pillars as to give  them the appearance of having been prepared by skillful hands, in  several blocks, and afterwards arranged in place without the aid of  mortar. Unfortunately, all efforts to photograph this wonderful portico  have failed to give satisfaction--its position above the river being  such as to afford no point for the proper placing of the camera; but a  second visit made for the purpose of trying was far from being a loss,  and part of the reward consisted of finding among the sheltered rocks,  scarcely three feet above the floor, two humming birds' nests with their  treasure of small eggs, and our little companion who discovered them was  pleased to leave them untouched.      SUGAR TREE HOLLOW CAVE.    The name of this cave is due to the fact that the approach is through a  \"hollow\" well wooded with sugar maple trees. It is two miles from Galena  and the drive a beautiful one, as much of the way is through the forest  without a road, but with a charming little rushing, crooked stream of  clear, cold water: and in places the green slopes give way to mural  bluffs of grey limestone in undisturbed strata.    The entrance to the cave is through a hole about two feet high by three  in width, into which we went feet first and wiggled slowly down an  incline covered with broken rock, for a distance of fifteen feet, where  a standing depth is reached. A flat, straight, level ceiling extends  over the whole cave without any perceptible variation, and this is  bordered around its entire length and breadth with a heavy cornice of  dripstone, made very ornamental by the forms it assumes, and the  multitude of depending stalactites that fall as a fringe around the  walls. The line of contact between the cornice and ceiling is as clear  and strong as if both had been finished separately before the cornice  was put in place by skillful hands.    Dripstone covers the walls, which vary in height from one foot to twenty  feet, according to the irregularities of the floor, just as the width of  this one-room cave varies with the curves of the walls, which are  sweeping and graceful, the average being twenty-nine feet, but is much  greater at the entrance where the entire slope extends out beyond the  body of the cave. The length, from north to south, measures two hundred  and thirty-three feet exclusive of an inaccessible extension.    The south end of the cave rises by a steep slope to within a foot of the  ceiling with which it is connected by short but heavy columns of  dripstone, and another line of pillars of graduated height meets this  at right angles near the middle and ends in an immense stalagmite that  stands at the foot of the slope like a grand newel post.    There is no standing water in the cave, but everything is wet with drip,  and consequently the formation of onyx is actively progressing and the  south slope already mentioned shows a curious succession of changes in  cave affairs. By the slow action of acidulated waters, the grey  limestone deteriorated into a yellowish clay-bank, and now its particles  are being re-united into solid rock by the deposit of calcium carbonate  from the drip.    A careful test of the temperature of the atmosphere showed it to be  fifty-eight degrees.      PINE RUN CAVE.    This also is a small cave easily visited from Galena, being less than  two miles distant on the Marionville road. The entrance faces the road  and is on the same level, consequently it is one of the easiest to  visit. Just within is seen an opening in the ceiling, which we are told  is one of the two ways to an upper chamber whose chief attraction is a  dripstone piano, and the means of ascending is at hand in the form of a  Spanish ladder; but an attempt of that sort might even cause the new  woman to hesitate, and who hesitates is lost. The ascent was not made.  We advanced on a level with the road for a distance of perhaps twenty  feet, when the direction of the cave changed with a right angular turn  and we were in a straight gallery about two hundred and fifty feet long  and fifteen feet in width, the height gradually decreasing to about  three feet towards the upper end, where it widened out into a low but  broad chamber. The floor of this chamber is most beautiful. It is  composed of a series of connected calcite bowls whose beautifully fluted  rims are of regular and uniform height, and all are equally filled with  clear, still water. A great number of these basins are said to have been  destroyed by an ax in the hands of a poor witless creature for the  gratification of a burst of temper, and a magnificent stalagmitic  column, too heavy for one man to lift, lay detached and broken, in proof  that his body did not share the feebleness of his mind.    Beyond these basins is a low passage through which is found the second  entrance to the upper chamber, but the basins must be crossed in order  to reach it, and this is not an easy undertaking even when their water  supply is low, but in the early summer they are almost full.    There are said to be more than one hundred caves in Stone County, one of  which is supposed to be fully as large as Marble Cave, if not larger,  and is located in the southern part of the county but has not been  explored.    Mill Cave is in the northeast of the county, and at the entrance is a  saw mill which receives its working power from the cave stream. Inside  the cave there is a lake.    Hermit's Cave is a few miles from Galena, and is so named on account of  having been used as a dwelling by its former owner, who kept a coffin in  which he intended to place himself before the final summons, but was  overtaken by death in the forest and it was never used. He wrote sermons  on the rocks in his cave and one of these was afterwards removed.    Wolf's Den is also near Galena, and has been utilized as a sheep fold.    Wild Man's Cave is near Galena, and on account of the stories with which  people have been frightened, can only be visited by permission and with  a guard stationed at the entrance.    Reynard's Cave is four miles west of Galena on the farm of Dr. Fox, but  is so nearly filled up with dripstone that only crawling room remains.  The doctor's place is a fine locality for the collection of fossils.    At a distance of twelve miles from Galena there is said to be a fine  natural bridge, well worth a visit and sufficiently near Mill Cave for  both to be seen on the same trip.    In Bread Tray Mountain there is supposed to be a cave through which a  torrent rushes at times, that being the only way in which to explain the  strange thundering, roaring noise always heard after a storm, and never  at other times.    Besides being a wonderful cave region, and rich in the great abundance  and variety of native fruits and fine timber, Stone County has a vast  amount of mineral wealth, the heaviest deposits being zinc, lead and  iron, with some indications of silver, gold and copper, which have been  found but not in paying quantity. Already since the summer of 1896  several exceptionally pure bodies of zinc have been discovered, the  white ore of one recently opened deposit giving highly gratifying  indications as to extent. Prospecting may be said to have only commenced  in this very far from over-crowded region.          CHAPTER VI.    OREGON COUNTY CAVES.      GREER SPRING.    Oregon County is also at the extreme southern limit of the State of  Missouri and was visited, not because its caves are supposed to be  either finer or more numerous than those of all the other Ozark  counties, but on account of remarkable attractions associated with them  that are not known to be equaled, or even subject to rivalry, by any  similar works of nature in any portion of the world.    The most convenient railway point is Thayer; the station hotel affords  comfortable accommodations for headquarters, and the last days of  September proved a charming time. The foliage was in full summer glory,  refreshed by a gentle and copious rain, and the insinuating tick had  already retired from active business until the following season.    The carriage having been ordered on condition of its being a clear day,  we left Thayer at eight o'clock on a perfect morning to visit Greer  Spring, and were soon in the depth of the beautiful Ozark forest, from  which we did not once emerge until Alton, the county seat, was reached,  the distance traveled being sixteen miles. Here we stopped for dinner at  the small hotel kept by one of the old-time early settlers who came to  the region before the war. The dinner was a surprise, and received the  highest commendation possible to a dinner, the hearty appreciation of a  boy. A young nephew, Arthur J. Owen, having been invited to act as  escort on the trip, found all the varied experience in cave hunting  fully equal to the pictured joys of anticipation. After a large bell  suspended somewhere outside had notified the business public that dinner  was ready to be served, we were invited to the dining-room, where on a  long table was the abundance of vegetables afforded by the season and  soil of an almost tropical state, and cooked as the white-capped chef of  the great hotel,"]]]
