Not knowing where we were, I proposed to Captain  Elliott we should go to the banks of the Vaal, and follow the river  till we came to the proper punt. After travelling all Monday,  Tuesday, and up till Wednesday about 1 p.m., when we found ourselves  four hours, or twenty-five miles, from Spencer's punt, we were  suddenly stopped by two armed Boers, who handed us an official  letter, which was opened, and found to be from the Secretary to the  Republican Government, stating that the members were surprised that,  as officers and gentlemen, we had broken our _parole d'honneur_, and  refused to leave the Transvaal; that if we did not do so immediately  by the nearest drift, which the bearers would show us, we must  return as prisoners of war; that as through our ignorance of the  language of the country there might be some misunderstanding, they  were loth to think we had willingly broken our promise. We explained  that we should reply to the letter, and request them to take it to  their Government, and were prepared to go with them at once. They  took us back to a farmhouse, where we were told to wait until they  fetched their commandant, who arrived about 6 p.m., and repeated to  us the same that was contained in our letter of that day. We told  him we were ready to explain matters, and requested him to take our  answer back to camp. He then ordered us to start at once for the  drift. I asked him, as it was then getting dark, if we could start  early next morning, but he refused. So we started, he having said we  should cross at Spencer's, being closest. As we left the farmhouse,  I pointed out to him that we were going in the wrong direction; but  he said, 'Never mind; come on across a drift close at hand.' When we  got opposite it, he kept straight on; I called to him, and said that  this was where we were to cross. His reply was, 'Come on!' I then  said to Captain Elliott, 'They intend taking us back to Pretoria,'  distant some forty miles. Suddenly the escort (which had all at once  increased from two to eight men, which Captain Elliott pointed out  to me; and I replied, 'I suppose they are determined we shall not  escape, which they need not be afraid of, as we are too keen to get  over the border') wheeled sharp down to the river, stopped, and,  pointing to the banks, said, 'There is the drift--cross!' I drove my  horses into the river, when they immediately fell; lifted them, and  drove on about five or six yards, when we fell into a hole. Got them  out with difficulty, and advanced another yard, when we got stuck  against a rock. The current was now so strong and drift deep, my  cart was turned over on to its side, and water rushed over the seat.  I called out to the commandant on the bank that we were stuck and to  send assistance, or might we return, to which he replied, 'If you  do, we will shoot you.' I then tried, but failed, to get the horses  to move. Turning to Captain Elliott, who was sitting beside me, I  said, 'We must swim for it'; and asked could he swim, to which he  replied, 'Yes.' I said, 'If you can't, I will stick to you, for I  can.' While we were holding this conversation, a volley from the  bank, ten or fifteen yards off, was fired into us, the bullets  passing through the tent of my cart, one of which must have mortally  wounded poor Elliott, who only uttered the single word 'Oh!' and  fell headlong into the river from the carriage. I immediately sprang  in after him, but was swept down the river under the current some  yards. On gaining the surface of the water, I could see nothing of  Elliott, but I called out his name twice, but received no reply.  Immediately another volley was fired at me, making the water hiss  around where the bullets struck. I now struck out for the opposite  bank, which I reached with difficulty in about ten minutes; but as  it was deep, black mud, on landing I stuck fast, but eventually  reached the top of the bank, and ran for about two hundred yards  under a heavy fire the whole while.    The Boers then invaded Natal and took up a position on Laing's Nek,  four miles inside the Natal border, from which, on January 28, Sir  George Colley endeavoured to oust them with a mounted force of 70 men  and some 500 men of the 58th Regiment. The position is one difficult  enough to climb unencumbered by military accoutrements, but the  disposition of the little mounted force covered the approach. By some  unexplained mistake, however, half of the mounted infantry charged  and carried the Boer position before the 58th had climbed the hill,  but were too weak to hold it and retired, leaving the 58th uncovered  in a terrible ascent. But few of the exhausted men reached the top of  the hill, and those, led by Colonel Deane, only to be shot down. Of  the mounted men, 17 were killed and wounded; of the 58th, 73 were  killed and 100 wounded. The result was absolute defeat of the British  forces. The number of Boers engaged is not known, but the force  behind the Nek consisted of several thousands, and no doubt a fair  proportion engaged in the fight.    On February 8 General Colley made a demonstration in force on the  Ingogo Heights. The force consisted of under 300 men, with 4 guns and  38 mounted men. On the Boer side there were about 1,000 men, and the  fight lasted from morning until after dark. It was a drawn fight, in  which both parties left the battlefield at night. There cannot be any  doubt, however, that the balance of advantage was with the Boers,  since the loss on the British side was very severe: 76 men were  killed and 69 wounded.    On February 27 came Majuba, when Sir George Colley designed to  retrieve his fortunes and strike an effective blow without the aid of  his second-in-command, Sir Evelyn Wood, whom he had sent to hurry up  reinforcements. The scaling of the mountain at night was a fine  performance. The neglect to take the rocket apparatus or mountain  guns, or to fortify the position in any way, or even to acquaint the  members of the force with the nature of the position which they had  taken up in the dark, and the failure to use the bayonets, were the  principal causes of disaster. The Boers attacked in force a position  which should have been absolutely impregnable, held as it was by a  force of 554 soldiers. The Boer force is not known, but probably  consisted of upwards of 1,000 men, since Christian Joubert after the  fight offered to take a portion of the men, numbering, as he said,  some 500, to attack a small British laager on one of the spurs of  the mountain. The splendid feat of taking the hill-top, however, was  accomplished by a small storming party of less than 200 men, the  balance of the Boer forces covering the approach of their comrades  by an accurate and incessant long-range fire. The result, as is  known, was terrible disaster: 92 killed and 134 wounded, and a  number taken prisoners, represented the British loss, whilst the  Boers lost 1 killed and 5 wounded. No attempt had been made to  occupy positions below the crown of the hill which commanded the  approaches, and the Boers were able to creep up under good cover  from place to place by the exercise of their admirable tactics. It  is impossible to detract from the performance of the Boers, and a  glance at the position leaves one more astonished than ever that a  successful attack could ever have been made upon it. The Boers  displayed on this day the finest fighting qualities. The generalship  of their fighting Commandant, Nikolas Smit, was of the highest  order. The cleverness of the attack, and the personal bravery and  audacity of the storming party are beyond praise.    By the time Sir Evelyn Wood had ranged his forces for an effective  and extended attack on the Boers, and by the time Sir Frederick  Roberts with the command of about 10,000 men had reached South  Africa, the administration of Mr. Gladstone had awakened to the fact  that the war was an unjust--not to say costly--one. An armistice was  arranged and peace made without another blow.    The terms of the settlement proposed by the Liberal Government fitly  illustrate the generosity of their motives. They proposed doing  'simple justice' to the Boers, but at the same time retaining the  districts of Lydenburg, Middelburg, Wakkerstroom, and Utrecht, not to  mention handing back Zoutpansberg to the original native occupants.  So anxious were the Boer leaders to effect a peaceful settlement, so  fearful were they of the actions of their followers, that when they  arranged the long armistice they did not announce to their party the  intentions of the British Government regarding the above districts.  General Joubert did not communicate to his army the terms of peace,  but simply stated that a Royal Commission was to settle everything.  A month later, when some inkling of the terms reached the Boers, a  solemn protest and warning was issued, and when the Royal Commission  actually sat, the British representatives were informed that any  such curtailment of the territories would be followed by a  resumption of hostilities. Needless to say the proposals were  abandoned and the Boers got their way. So ended the war.    Ingogo has been called a drawn battle. Bronkhorst Spruit was--such as  it was. At Laing's Nek and Majuba the Boers beat us, as Mr. Carter  fairly puts it, 'when they were on the top of the hill and we were at  the bottom, and when we were on the top of the hill and they were at  the bottom.' The narrative of these events is about as humiliating a  one as an Englishman can read. Here and there it is redeemed by the  heroic conduct of individuals in the midst of general disaster. In  the smaller affairs, such as the particularly gallant defences of  Standerton, Potchefstroom, and Rustenberg, where little garrisons  held their own with conspicuous ability and courage, there is  something to cheer the disheartened"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16523"],[0,"The Kitáb-i-Aqdas (#11)"],[1," of all is come. The  Kingdom is God's, the omnipotent Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Worship  none but God, and, with radiant hearts, lift up your faces unto your Lord,  the Lord of all names. This is a Revelation to which whatever ye possess  can never be compared, could ye but know it.    79 We see you rejoicing in that which ye have amassed for others and  shutting out yourselves from the worlds which naught except My guarded  Tablet can reckon. The treasures ye have laid up have drawn you far away  from your ultimate objective. This ill beseemeth you, could ye but  understand it. Wash from your hearts all earthly defilements, and hasten  to enter the Kingdom of your Lord, the Creator of earth and heaven, Who  caused the world to tremble and all its peoples to wail, except them that  have renounced all things and clung to that which the Hidden Tablet hath  ordained.    80 This is the Day in which He Who held converse with God hath attained  the light of the Ancient of Days, and quaffed the pure waters of reunion  from this Cup that hath caused the seas to swell. Say: By the one true  God! Sinai is circling round the Dayspring of Revelation, while from the  heights of the Kingdom the Voice of the Spirit of God is heard  proclaiming: \"Bestir yourselves, ye proud ones of the earth, and hasten ye  unto Him.\" Carmel hath, in this Day, hastened in longing adoration to  attain His court, whilst from the heart of Zion there cometh the cry: \"The  promise is fulfilled. That which had been announced in the holy Writ of  God, the Most Exalted, the Almighty, the Best-Beloved, is made manifest.\"    81 O kings of the earth! The Most Great Law hath been revealed in this  Spot, this scene of transcendent splendour. Every hidden thing hath been  brought to light by virtue of the Will of the Supreme Ordainer, He Who  hath ushered in the Last Hour, through Whom the Moon hath been cleft, and  every irrevocable decree expounded.    82 Ye are but vassals, O kings of the earth! He Who is the King of Kings  hath appeared, arrayed in His most wondrous glory, and is summoning you  unto Himself, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Take heed lest pride  deter you from recognizing the Source of Revelation, lest the things of  this world shut you out as by a veil from Him Who is the Creator of  heaven. Arise, and serve Him Who is the Desire of all nations, Who hath  created you through a word from Him, and ordained you to be, for all time,  the emblems of His sovereignty.    83 By the righteousness of God! It is not Our wish to lay hands on your  kingdoms. Our mission is to seize and possess the hearts of men. Upon them  the eyes of Baha are fastened. To this testifieth the Kingdom of Names,  could ye but comprehend it. Whoso followeth his Lord will renounce the  world and all that is therein; how much greater, then, must be the  detachment of Him Who holdeth so august a station! Forsake your palaces,  and haste ye to gain admittance into His Kingdom. This, indeed, will  profit you both in this world and in the next. To this testifieth the Lord  of the realm on high, did ye but know it.    84 How great the blessedness that awaiteth the king who will arise to aid  My Cause in My kingdom, who will detach himself from all else but Me! Such  a king is numbered with the companions of the Crimson Ark--the Ark which  God hath prepared for the people of Baha. All must glorify his name, must  reverence his station, and aid him to unlock the cities with the keys of  My Name, the omnipotent Protector of all that inhabit the visible and  invisible kingdoms. Such a king is the very eye of mankind, the luminous  ornament on the brow of creation, the fountainhead of blessings unto the  whole world. Offer up, O people of Baha, your substance, nay your very  lives, for his assistance.    85 O Emperor of Austria! He Who is the Dayspring of God's Light dwelt in  the prison of Akka at the time when thou didst set forth to visit the Aqsa  Mosque. Thou passed Him by, and inquired not about Him by Whom every house  is exalted and every lofty gate unlocked. We, verily, made it a place  whereunto the world should turn, that they might remember Me, and yet thou  hast rejected Him Who is the Object of this remembrance, when He appeared  with the Kingdom of God, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds. We have been  with thee at all times, and found thee clinging unto the Branch and  heedless of the Root. Thy Lord, verily, is a witness unto what I say. We  grieved to see thee circle round Our Name, whilst unaware of Us, though We  were before thy face. Open thine eyes, that thou mayest behold this  glorious Vision, and recognize Him Whom thou invokest in the daytime and  in the night season, and gaze on the Light that shineth above this  luminous Horizon.    86 Say: O King of Berlin! Give ear unto the Voice calling from this  manifest Temple: \"Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Everlasting,  the Peerless, the Ancient of Days.\" Take heed lest pride debar thee from  recognizing the Dayspring of Divine Revelation, lest earthly desires shut  thee out, as by a veil, from the Lord of the Throne above and of the earth  below. Thus counselleth thee the Pen of the Most High. He, verily, is the  Most Gracious, the All-Bountiful. Do thou remember the one(1) whose power  transcended thy power, and whose station excelled thy station. Where is  he? Whither are gone the things he possessed? Take warning, and be not of  them that are fast asleep. He it was who cast the Tablet of God behind him  when We made known unto him what the hosts of tyranny had caused Us to  suffer. Wherefore, disgrace assailed him from all sides, and he went down  to dust in great loss. Think deeply, O King, concerning him, and  concerning them who, like unto thee, have conquered cities and ruled over  men. The All-Merciful brought them down from their palaces to their  graves. Be warned, be of them who reflect.    87 We have asked nothing from you. For the sake of God We, verily, exhort  you, and will be patient as We have been patient in that which hath  befallen Us at your hands, O concourse of kings!    88 Hearken ye, O Rulers of America and the Presidents of the Republics  therein, unto that which the Dove is warbling on the Branch of Eternity:  \"There is none other God but Me, the Ever-Abiding, the Forgiving, the  All-Bountiful.\" Adorn ye the temple of dominion with the ornament of  justice and of the fear of God, and its head with the crown of the  remembrance of your Lord, the Creator of the heavens. Thus counselleth you  He Who is the Dayspring of Names, as bidden by Him Who is the All-Knowing,  the All-Wise. The Promised One hatthe Tablet ofh appeared in this  glorified Station, whereat all beings, both seen and unseen, have  rejoiced. Take ye advantage of the Day of God. Verily, to meet Him is  better for you than all that whereon the sun shineth, could ye but know  it. O concourse of rulers! Give ear unto that which hath been raised from  the Dayspring of Grandeur: \"Verily, there is none other God but Me, the  Lord of Utterance, the All-Knowing.\" Bind ye the broken with the hands of  justice, and crush the oppressor who flourisheth with the rod of the  commandments of your Lord, the Ordainer, the All-Wise.    89 O people of Constantinople! Lo, from your midst We hear the baleful  hooting of the owl. Hath the drunkenness of passion laid hold upon you, or  is it that ye are sunk in heedlessness? O Spot that art situate on the  shores of the two seas! The throne of tyranny hath, verily, been  established upon thee, and the flame of hatred hath been kindled within  thy bosom, in such wise that the Concourse on high and they who circle  around the Exalted Throne have wailed and lamented. We behold in thee the  foolish ruling over the wise, and darkness vaunting itself against the  light. Thou art indeed filled with manifest pride. Hath thine outward  splendour made thee vainglorious? By Him Who is the Lord of mankind! It  shall soon perish, and thy daughters and thy widows and all the kindreds  that dwell within thee shall lament. Thus informeth thee the All-Knowing,  the All-Wise.    90 O banks of the Rhine! We have seen you covered with gore, inasmuch as  the swords of retribution were drawn against you; and you shall have  another turn. And We hear the lamentations of Berlin, though she be today  in conspicuous glory.    91 Let nothing grieve thee, O Land of Ta,(2) for God hath chosen thee to  be the source of the joy of all mankind. He shall, if it be His Will,  bless thy throne with one who will rule with justice, who will gather  together the flock of God which the wolves have scattered. Such a ruler  will, with joy and gladness, turn his face towards, and extend his favours  unto, the people of Baha. He indeed is accounted in the sight of God as a  jewel among men. Upon him rest forever the glory of God and the glory of  all that dwell in the kingdom of His revelation.    92 Rejoice with great joy, for God hath made thee \"the Dayspring of His  light\", inasmuch as within thee was born the Manifestation of His Glory.  Be thou glad for this name that hath been conferred upon thee--a name  through which the Day-Star of grace hath shed its splendour, through which  both earth and heaven have been illumined.    93 Erelong will the state of affairs within thee be changed, and the reins  of power fall into the hands of the people. Verily, thy Lord is the  All-Knowing. His authority embraceth all things. Rest thou assured in the  gracious favour of thy Lord. The eye of His loving-kindness shall  everlastingly be directed towards thee. The day is approaching when thy  agitation will have been transmuted into peace and quiet calm. Thus hath  it been decreed in the wondrous Book.    94 O Land of K{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}a!(3) We hear from thee the voice of heroes, raised in  glorification of thy Lord, the All-Possessing, the Most Exalted.
