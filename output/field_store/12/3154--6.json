Perhaps the chances are, however, considering  how skulls of the neolithic period prove to be anything but uniform,  and suggest crossings between different stocks, that we may claim  kinship to some extent with the more good-looking of the two main types  of palaeolithic man--always supposing that head-form can be taken as  a guide. But can it? The Pygmies of the Congo region have medium heads;  the Bushmen of South Africa, usually regarded as akin in race, have  long heads. The American Indians, generally supposed to be all, or  nearly all, of one racial type, show considerable differences of  head-form; and so on. It need not be repeated that any race-mark is  liable to deceive.           *       *       *       *       *    We have sufficiently considered the use to which the particular  race-mark of head-form has been put in the attempted classification  of the very early men who have left their bones behind them. Let us  now turn to another race-mark, namely colour; because, though it may  really be less satisfactory than others, for instance hair, that is  the one to which ordinary people naturally turn when they seek to  classify by races the present inhabitants of the earth.    When Linnaeus in pre-Darwinian days distinguished four varieties of  man, the white European, the red American, the yellow Asiatic, and  the black African, he did not dream of providing the basis of anything  more than an artificial classification. He probably would have agreed  with Buffon in saying that in every case it was one and the same kind  of man, only dyed differently by the different climates. But the  Darwinian is searching for a natural classification. He wants to  distinguish men according to their actual descent. Now race and descent  mean for him the same thing. Hence a race-mark, if one is to be found,  must stand for, by co-existing with, the whole mass of properties that  form the inheritance. Can colour serve for a race-mark in this profound  sense? That is the only question here.    First of all, what is the use of being coloured one way or the other?  Does it make any difference? Is it something, like the heart-line of  the hand, that may go along with useful qualities, but in itself seems  to be a meaningless accident? Well, as some unfortunate people will  be able to tell you, colour is still a formidable handicap in the  struggle for existence. Not to consider the colour-prejudice in other  aspects, there is no gainsaying the part it plays in sexual selection  at this hour. The lower animals appear to be guided in the choice of  a mate by externals of a striking and obvious sort. And men and women  to this day marry more with their eyes than with their heads.    The coloration of man, however, though it may have come to subserve  the purposes of mating, does not seem in its origin to have been like  the bright coloration of the male bird. It was not something wholly  useless save as a means of sexual attraction, though in such a capacity  useful because a mark of vital vigour. Colour almost certainly  developed in strict relation to climate. Right away in the back ages  we must place what Bagehot has called the race-making epoch, when the  chief bodily differences, including differences of colour, arose  amongst men. In those days, we may suppose, natural selection acted  largely on the body, because mind had not yet become the prime condition  of survival. The rest is a question of pre-historic geography. Within  the tropics, the habitat of the man-like apes, and presumably of the  earliest men, a black skin protects against sunlight. A white skin,  on the other hand--though this is more doubtful--perhaps economizes  sun-heat in colder latitudes. Brown, yellow and the so-called red are  intermediate tints suitable to intermediate regions. It is not hard  to plot out in the pre-historic map of the world geographical provinces,  or \"areas of characterization,\" where races of different shades  corresponding to differences in the climate might develop, in an  isolation more or less complete, such as must tend to reinforce the  process of differentiation.    Let it not be forgotten, however, that individual plasticity plays  its part too in the determination of human colour. The Anglo-Indian  planter is apt to return from a long sojourn in the East with his skin  charged with a dark pigment which no amount of Pears' soap will remove  during the rest of his life. It would be interesting to conduct  experiments, on the lines of those of Professor Boas already mentioned,  with the object of discovering in what degree the same capacity for  amassing protective pigment declares itself in children of European  parentage born in the tropics or transplanted thither during infancy.  Correspondingly, the tendency of dark stocks to bleach in cold  countries needs to be studied. In the background, too, lurks the  question whether such effects of individual plasticity can be  transmitted to offspring, and become part of the inheritance.    One more remark upon the subject of colour. Now-a-days civilized  peoples, as well as many of the ruder races that the former govern,  wear clothes. In other words they have dodged the sun, by developing,  with the aid of mind, a complex society that includes the makers of  white drill suits and solar helmets. But, under such conditions, the  colour of one's skin becomes more or less of a luxury. Protective  pigment, at any rate now-a-days, counts for little as compared with  capacity for social service. Colour, in short, is rapidly losing its  vital function. Will it therefore tend to disappear? In the long run,  it would seem--perhaps only in the very long run--it will become  dissociated from that general fitness to survive under particular  climatic conditions of which it was once the innate mark. Be this as  it may, race-prejudice, that is so largely founded on sheer  considerations of colour, is bound to decay, if and when the races  of darker colour succeed in displaying, on the average, such qualities  of mind as will enable them to compete with the whites on equal terms,  in a world which is coming more and more to include all climates.           *       *       *       *       *    Thus we are led on to discuss race in its mental aspect. Here, more  than ever, we are all at sea, for want of a proper criterion. What  is to be the test of mind? Indeed, mind and plasticity are almost the  same thing. Race, therefore, as being the stiffening in the evolution  of life, might seem by its very nature opposed to mind as a limiting  or obstructing force. Are we, then, going to return to the old  pre-scientific notion of soul as something alien to body, and thereby  simply clogged, thwarted and dragged down? That would never do. Body  and soul are, for the working purposes of science, to be conceived  as in perfect accord, as co-helpers in the work of life, and as such  subject to a common development. Heredity, then, must be assumed to  apply to both equally. In proportion as there is plastic mind there  will be plastic body.    Unfortunately, the most plastic part of body is likewise the hardest  to observe, at any rate whilst it is alive, namely, the brain. No  certain criterion of heredity, then, is likely to be available from  this quarter. You will see it stated, for instance, that the size of  the brain cavity will serve to mark off one race from another. This  is extremely doubtful, to put it mildly. No doubt the average European  shows some advantage in this respect as compared, say, with the Bushman.  But then you have to write off so much for their respective types of  body, a bigger body going in general with a bigger head, that in the  end you find yourself comparing mere abstractions. Again, the European  may be the first to cry off on the ground that comparisons are odious;  for some specimens of Neanderthal man in sheer size of the brain cavity  are said to give points to any of our modern poets and politicians.  Clearly, then, something is wrong with this test. Nor, if the brain  itself be examined after death, and the form and number of its  convolutions compared, is this criterion of hereditary brain-power  any more satisfactory. It might be possible in this way to detect the  difference between an idiot and a person of normal intelligence, but  not the difference between a fool and a genius.    We cross the uncertain line that divides the bodily from the mental  when we subject the same problem of hereditary mental endowment to  the methods of what is known as experimental psychology. Thus acuteness  of sight, hearing, taste, smell and feeling are measured by various  ingenious devices. Seeing what stories travellers bring back with them  about the hawk-like vision of hunting races, one might suppose that  such comparisons would be all in their favour. The Cambridge Expedition  to Torres Straits, however, of which Dr. Haddon was the leader,  included several well-trained psychologists, who devoted special  attention to this subject; and their results show that the sensory  powers of these rude folk were on the average much the same as those  of Europeans. It is the hunter's experience only that enables him to  sight the game at an immense distance. There are a great many more  complicated tests of the same type designed to estimate the force of  memory, attention, association, reasoning and other faculties that  most people would regard as purely mental; whilst another set of such  tests deals with reaction to stimulus, co-ordination between hand and  eye, fatigue, tremor, and, most ingenious perhaps of all, emotional  excitement as shown through the respiration--phenomena which are, as  it were, mental and bodily at once and together. Unfortunately,  psychology cannot distinguish in such cases between the effects of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17287"],[0,"History of France (#11)"],[1,"of France, and the burghers  of the chief southern cities were mostly Huguenot. The war had been from  the first a very horrible one; there had been savage slaughter, and  still more savage reprisals on each side. The young nobles had been  trained into making a fashion of ferocity, and practising graceful ways  of striking death-blows. Whole districts had been laid waste, churches  and abbeys destroyed, tombs rifled, and the whole population accustomed  to every sort of horror and suffering; while nobody but Henry IV.  himself, and the Duke of Sully, had any notion either of statesmanship  or of religious toleration.      11. Henry's Plans.--Just as the reign of Louis XI. had been a period  of rest and recovery from the English wars, so that of Henry IV. was one  of restoration from the ravages of thirty years of intermittent civil  war. The king himself not only had bright and engaging manners, but was  a man of large heart and mind; and Sully did much for the welfare of the  country. Roads, canals, bridges, postal communications, manufactures,  extended commerce, all owed their promotion to him, and brought  prosperity to the burgher class; and the king was especially endeared to  the peasantry by his saying that he hoped for the time when no cottage  would be without a good fowl in its pot. The great silk manufactories of  southern France chiefly arose under his encouragement, and there was  prosperity of every kind. The Church itself was in a far better state  than before. Some of the best men of any time were then living--in  especial Vincent de Paul, who did much to improve the training of the  parochial clergy, and who founded the order of Sisters of Charity, who  prevented the misery of the streets of Paris from ever being so  frightful as in those days when deserted children became the prey of  wolves, dogs, and pigs. The nobles, who had grown into insolence during  the wars, either as favourites of Henry III. or as zealous supporters of  the Huguenot cause, were subdued and tamed. The most noted of these were  the Duke of Bouillon, the owner of the small principality of Sedan, who  was reduced to obedience by the sight of Sully's formidable train of  artillery; and the Marshal Duke of Biron, who, thinking that Henry had  not sufficiently rewarded his services, intrigued with Spain and Savoy,  and was beheaded for his treason. Hatred to the house of Austria in  Spain and Germany was as keen as ever in France; and in 1610 Henry IV.  was prepared for another war on the plea of a disputed succession to the  duchy of Cleves. The old fanaticism still lingered in Paris, and Henry  had been advised to beware of pageants there; but it was necessary that  his second wife, Mary de' Medici, should be crowned before he went to  the war, as she was to be left regent. Two days after the coronation, as  Henry was going to the arsenal to visit his old friend Sully, he was  stabbed to the heart in his coach, in the streets of Paris, by a fanatic  named Ravaillac. The French call him Le Grand Monarque; and he was one  of the most attractive and benevolent of men, winning the hearts of all  who approached him, but the immorality of his life did much to confirm  the already low standard that prevailed among princes and nobles in  France.      12. The States-General of 1614.--Henry's second wife, Mary de' Medici,  became regent, for her son, _Louis XIII._, was only ten years old, and  indeed his character was so weak that his whole reign was only one long  minority. Mary de' Medici was entirely under the dominion of an Italian  favourite named Concini, and his wife, and their whole endeavour was to  amass riches for themselves and keep the young king in helpless  ignorance, while they undid all that Sully had effected, and took bribes  shamelessly. The Prince of Conde tried to overthrow them, and, in hopes  of strengthening herself, in 1614 Mary summoned together the  States-General. There came 464 members, 132 for the nobles, 140 for the  clergy, and 192 for the third estate, _i.e._ the burghers, and these,  being mostly lawyers and magistrates from the provinces, were resolved  to make their voices heard. Taxation was growing worse and worse. Not  only was it confined to the burgher and peasant class, exempting the  clergy and the nobles, among which last were included their families to  the remotest generation, but it had become the court custom to multiply  offices, in order to pension the nobles, and keep them quiet; and this,  together with the expenses of the army, made the weight of taxation  ruinous. Moreover, the presentation to the civil offices held by  lawyers was made hereditary in their families, on payment of a sum down,  and of fees at the death of each holder. All these abuses were  complained of; and one of the deputies even told the nobility that if  they did not learn to treat the despised classes below them as younger  brothers, they would lay up a terrible store of retribution for  themselves. A petition to the king was drawn up, and was received, but  never answered. The doors of the house of assembly were closed--the  members were told it was by order of the king--and the States-General  never met again for 177 years, when the storm was just ready to fall.      13. The Siege of Rochelle.--The rottenness of the State was chiefly  owing to the nobility, who, as long as they were allowed to grind down  their peasants and shine at court, had no sense of duty or public  spirit, and hated the burghers and lawyers far too much to make common  cause with them against the constantly increasing power of the throne.  They only intrigued and struggled for personal advantages and rivalries,  and never thought of the good of the State. They bitterly hated Concini,  the Marshal d'Ancre, as he had been created, but he remained in power  till 1614, when one of the king's gentlemen, Albert de Luynes, plotted  with the king himself and a few of his guards for his deliverance.  Nothing could be easier than the execution. The king ordered the  captain of the guards to arrest Concini, and kill him if he resisted;  and this was done. Concini was cut down on the steps of the Louvre, and  Louis exclaimed, \"At last I am a king.\" But it was not in him to be a  king, and he never was one all his life. He only passed under the  dominion of De Luynes, who was a high-spirited young noble. The  Huguenots had been holding assemblies, which were considered more  political than religious, and their towns of security were a grievance  to royalty. War broke out again, and Louis himself went with De Luynes  to besiege Montauban. The place was taken, but disease broke out in the  army, and De Luynes died. There was a fresh struggle for power between  the queen-mother and the Prince of Conde, ending in both being set aside  by the queen's almoner, Armand de Richelieu, Bishop of Lucon, and  afterwards a cardinal, the ablest statesman then in Europe, who gained  complete dominion over the king and country, and ruled them both with a  rod of iron. The Huguenots were gradually driven out of all their  strongholds, till only Rochelle remained to them. This city was bravely  and patiently defended by the magistrates and the Duke of Rohan, with  hopes of succour from England, until these being disconcerted by the  murder of the Duke of Buckingham, they were forced to surrender, after  having held out for more than a year. Louis XIII. entered in triumph,  deprived the city of all its privileges, and thus in 1628 concluded the  war that had begun by the attack of the Guisards on the congregation at  Vassy, in 1561. The lives and properties of the Huguenots were still  secure, but all favour was closed against them, and every encouragement  held out to them to join the Church. Many of the worst scandals had been  removed, and the clergy were much improved; and, from whatever motive it  might be, many of the more influential Huguenots began to conform to the  State religion.          CHAPTER VI.    POWER OF THE CROWN.      1. Richelieu's Administration.--Cardinal de Richelieu's whole idea of  statesmanship consisted in making the King of France the greatest of  princes at home and abroad. To make anything great of Louis XIII., who  was feeble alike in mind and body, was beyond any one's power, and  Richelieu kept him in absolute subjection, allowing him a favourite with  whom to hunt, talk, and amuse himself, but if the friend attempted to  rouse the king to shake off the yoke, crushing him ruthlessly. It was  the crown rather than the king that the cardinal exalted, putting down  whatever resisted. Gaston, Duke of Orleans, the king's only brother,  made a futile struggle for power, and freedom of choice in marriage, but  was soon overcome. He was spared, as being the only heir to the kingdom,  but the Duke of Montmorency, who had been led into his rebellion, was  brought to the block, amid the pity and terror of all France. Whoever  seemed dangerous to the State, or showed any spirit of independence,  was marked by the cardinal, and suffered a hopeless imprisonment, if  nothing worse; but at the same time his government was intelligent and  able, and promoted prosperity, as far as was possible where there was  such a crushing of individual spirit and enterprise. Richelieu's plan,  in fact, was to found a despotism, though a wise and well-ordered  despotism, at home, while he made France great by conquests abroad. And  at this time the ambition of France found a favourable field in the  state both of Germany and of Spain.      2. The War in Flanders and Italy.--The Thirty Years' War had been  raging in Germany for many years, and France had taken no part in it,  beyond encouraging the Swedes and the Protestant Germans, as the enemies  of the Emperor. But the policy of Richelieu required that the disunion  between its Catholic and Protestant states should be maintained, and  when things began to tend towards peace from mutual exhaustion,"]]]
