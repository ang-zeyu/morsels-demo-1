I suppose you are quite prepared,\" he added,  drawing up a chair for her, and glancing at a pile of books lying on the  table.    \"No,\" she said, coloring and dropping her eyes with a slightly mortified  air. \"I meant to be, but so many things happened to interfere. I had a  letter to write, then some ladies called, and then----\"    \"Well?\" he said interrogatively, as she paused, coloring still more  deeply.    \"I wanted to finish the book I was reading last night. I really couldn't  fix my thoughts on stupid lessons until I knew what became of the  heroine.\"    Edward, standing by her side and looking down at her, shook his head  gravely. \"Duties should be attended to first, Zoe, pleasures indulged in  afterward.\"    \"You are talking to me as if I were nothing but a child!\" she cried  indignantly, her cheeks growing hot.    \"The dearest, most lovable child in the world,\" he said, bending down to  stroke her hair and look into her face with laughing eyes.    \"No, sir, I'm your wife. What did you marry me for if you considered me  such a child?\" she cried with a half pout on her lip, but love-light in  the eyes lifted to his.    \"Because I loved you and wanted the right to take care of you, my bonny  belle,\" he said, repeating his caress.    \"And you do, the best care in the world, you dear boy!\" she exclaimed  impulsively, throwing her arms about his neck. \"And if it will please you,  I'll set to work at the lessons now.\"    \"Then do, love; I have letters to write, and we will sit here and work  side by side.\"    Both worked diligently for an hour or more; they had a merry time over the  recitations, then drove together to the nearest village to post Edward's  letters and get the afternoon mail for Ion.    Violet was made happy by a long letter from her husband.    She had barely time to glance over it, learning when and where it was  written, and that he was well at the time of writing, when the tea-bell  rang.    She slipped the precious missive into her pocket with a little sigh of  satisfaction, and joined the others at the table with a very bright and  happy face.    She had not been the only fortunate one; her mother had cheering news from  Herbert and Harold, Mrs. Dinsmore some sprightly, gossipy letters from her  sisters Adelaide and May, whose contents furnished topics of lively  discourse, in which Violet took part.    She had not mentioned her own letter, but at length Edward, noting the  brightness of her countenance, asked, \"Good news from the captain, Vi?\"    \"Yes, thank you,\" she said; \"he was well and seemingly in excellent  spirits at the time of writing, though he says he misses wife and children  sorely.\"    All three of his children turned toward her with eager, questioning looks,  Max and Lulu asking, \"Didn't papa write to us, too?\"    \"He sends you a message, dears,\" Violet said. \"I have not really read the  letter yet, but shall do so after supper, and you shall all surely have  your share of it.\"    On leaving the table they followed her to the door of her boudoir.    \"May we come in, Mamma Vi?\" Max asked, with a wistful look.    \"Certainly,\" she answered in a pleasant tone, though longing to be quite  alone while giving her precious letter its first perusal; \"I would have  you feel as free to come into my apartments as I always have felt to go  into mamma's. Sit down and make yourselves comfortable, dears, and you  shall hear presently what your papa says.    \"The letter was written on shipboard, brought into New York by another  vessel and there mailed to me.\"    Max politely drew up a chair near the light for Violet, another for Lulu,  placed Gracie's own little rocker close to her mamma's side, then stood  behind it prepared to give close attention to the reading of his father's  letter.    Violet omitted a little here and there--expressions of tender affection  for herself, or something else evidently intended for her eye alone. The  captain wrote delightful letters; at least they were such in the esteem of  his wife and children. This one provoked to both laughter and tears, he  had so amusing a way of relating trivial incidents, and some passages were  so tenderly affectionate.    But something near the close brought an anxious, troubled look to Max's  face, a frown to Lulu's brow.    It was this: \"Tell Max and Lulu I wish each of them to keep a diary for my  inspection, writing down every evening what have been the doings and  happenings of the day as regards themselves--their studies, their  pleasures, their conduct also. Max telling of himself, Lulu of herself,  just as they would if sitting on my knee and answering the questions,  'What have you been busy about to-day? Have you been attentive to your  studies, respectful and obedient to those in charge of you? Have you tried  to do your duty toward God and man?'    \"They need not show any one at Ion what they write. I shall trust to their  truthfulness and honesty not to represent themselves as better than they  are, not to hide their faults from the father who cares to know of them,  only that he may help his dear children to live right and be happy. Ah, if  they but knew how I love them! and how it grieves and troubles me when  they go astray!\"    Max's face brightened at those closing sentences, Lulu's softened for a  moment, but then, as Violet folded the letter, \"I don't want to!\" she  burst out. \"Why does papa say we must do such things?\"    \"He tells you, dear; did you not notice?\" said Violet. \"He says he wishes  to know your faults in order to help you to correct them. And don't you  think it will help you to avoid wrongdoing? to resist temptation? the  remembrance that it must be confessed to your dear father and will grieve  him very much? Is it not kind in him to be willing to bear that pain for  the sake of doing you good?\"    Lulu did not answer, but Max said, \"Yes, indeed, Mamma Vi! and oh, I hope  I'll never have to make his heart ache over my wrongdoings! But I don't  know how to keep a diary.\"    \"Nor I either,\" added Lulu.    \"But you can learn, dears,\" Violet said. \"I will help you at the start.  You can each give a very good report of to-day's conduct, I am sure.    \"The keeping of a diary will be very improving to you in a literary way,  teaching you to express your thoughts readily in writing, and that, I  presume, is one thing your father has in view.\"    \"But it will be just like writing compositions; and that I always did  _hate_!\" cried Lulu vehemently.    \"No, not exactly,\" said Max; \"because you don't have to make up anything,  only to tell real happenings and doings that you haven't had time to  forget.\"    \"And I think you will soon find it making the writing of compositions  easier,\" remarked Violet, with an encouraging smile.    \"It'll be just the same as having to write a composition every day,\"  grumbled Lulu. \"I wish papa wouldn't be so hard on us. I have to study  lessons a whole hour every evening, and then it'll take ever so long to  write that, and I shall not have a bit of time to play.\"    \"I wish I could write,\" little Gracie said, with a half sigh. \"If I could,  I'd like to talk that way to papa.\"    \"You shall learn, darling,\" Violet said, caressing her with gentle  fondness. \"Would you like to begin now?\"    \"Oh, yes, mamma!\" cried the child eagerly.    \"Then bring me your slate, and I will set you a copy. Max and Lulu, would  you like to bring your writing-desks in here, and let me give you any help  you may need?\"    Both assented to the proposal with thanks, and were presently seated near  her, each with open desk, a fresh sheet of paper spread out upon it, and  pen in hand.    \"I think that until you are a little used to the business, it would be  well to compose first with a pencil, then copy in ink,\" remarked Violet.  \"And here,\" taking it from a drawer in her writing-desk, as she spoke,  \"is some printing paper which takes pencil mark much better than the more  highly glazed paper which we use ordinarily in writing letters.\"    She gave each of them a pile of neatly cut sheets and a nicely sharpened  pencil.    They thanked her, and Max set to work at once.    Lulu sat playing with her pencil, her eyes on the carpet. \"I don't know  how to begin!\" she exclaimed presently in an impatient tone. \"What shall I  say first, Mamma Vi?\"    \"Write down the date and then--Suppose you dictate to me, if that will be  any easier.\"    \"Thank you, ma'am, I think it would till I get into the way of it,\" Lulu  said, handing over her paper and pencil with a sigh of relief.    \"Now,\" said Violet, encouragingly, \"just imagine that you are sitting on  your papa's knee and answering the question, 'What have you been doing all  day?'\"    \"As soon as I was dressed and ready for breakfast, I went to Grandma  Elsie's dressing-room, along with Rosie and the others, to say Bible  verses, and hear Grandma Elsie talk about them and pray. Will that do,  Mamma Vi?\"    \"Very nicely, dear; it is just what your papa wants, I think.\"    Lulu's brow cleared, and she went on stating briefly the doings of the now  closing day in the due order of their succession, Violet's pen nearly  keeping pace with her tongue.    \"And here we are--Max and Gracie and I--sitting with Mamma Vi in her  boudoir, and she is writing for me the words I tell her, and I'm to copy  them off to-morrow,\" was the concluding sentence of this first entry in  the little girl's diary.    \"Will you hear mine, Mamma Vi, and tell me if it will do?\" asked Max; and  receiving permission read it aloud.    \"It is very good indeed, Max,\" Violet said; \"a good and true report, and  well expressed. Now, if you and Lulu choose you may bring your books here  and study your lessons for to-morrow, and if you need help from me I shall  give it with pleasure.\"    \"But, Mamma Vi, it will be very dull for you to stay up here with us while  the rest of the grown-up people are having a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14916"],[0,"Fairy Tales Every Child Should Know (#11)"],[1," it to him till he was out of the cave. The African magician,  provoked at this obstinate refusal, flew into a passion, threw a little  of his incense into the fire, and pronounced two magical words, when the  stone which had closed the mouth of the staircase moved into its place,  with the earth over it in the same manner as it lay at the arrival of  the magician and Aladdin.    This action of the magician plainly revealed to Aladdin that he was no  uncle of his, but one who designed him evil. The truth was that he had  learnt from his magic books the secret and the value of this wonderful  lamp, the owner of which would be made richer than any earthly ruler,  and hence his journey to China. His art had also told him that he was  not permitted to take it himself, but must receive it as a voluntary  gift from the hands of another person. Hence he employed young Aladdin,  and hoped by a mixture of kindness and authority to make him obedient to  his word and will. When he found that his attempt had failed, he set out  to return to Africa, but avoided the town, lest any person who had seen  him leave in company with Aladdin should make inquiries after the youth.  Aladdin being suddenly enveloped in darkness, cried, and called out to  his uncle to tell him he was ready to give him the lamp; but in vain,  since his cries could not be heard. He descended to the bottom of the  steps, with a design to get into the palace, but the door, which was  opened before by enchantment, was now shut by the same means. He then  redoubled his cries and tears, sat down on the steps without any hopes  of ever seeing light again, and in an expectation of passing from the  present darkness to a speedy death. In this great emergency he said,  \"There is no strength or power but in the great and high God\"; and in  joining his hands to pray he rubbed the ring which the magician had put  on his finger. Immediately a genie of frightful aspect appeared, and  said, \"What wouldst thou have? I am ready to obey thee. I serve him who  possesses the ring on thy finger; I, and the other slaves of that ring.\"          At another time Aladdin would have been frightened at the sight of so  extraordinary a figure, but the danger he was in made him answer without  hesitation, \"Whoever thou art, deliver me from this place.\" He had no  sooner spoken these words, than he found himself on the very spot where  the magician had last left him, and no sign of cave or opening, nor  disturbance of the earth. Returning God thanks to find himself once more  in the world, he made the best of his way home. When he got within his  mother's door, the joy to see her and his weakness for want of  sustenance made him so faint that he remained for a long time as dead.  As soon as he recovered, he related to his mother all that had happened  to him, and they were both very vehement in their complaints of the  cruel magician. Aladdin slept very soundly till late the next morning,  when the first thing he said to his mother was, that he wanted something  to eat, and wished she would give him his breakfast. \"Alas! child,\" said  she, \"I have not a bit of bread to give you; you ate up all the  provisions I had in the house yesterday; but I have a little cotton  which I have spun; I will go and sell it, and buy bread and something  for our dinner.\" \"Mother,\" replied Aladdin, \"keep your cotton for  another time, and give me the lamp I brought home with me yesterday; I  will go and sell it, and the money I shall get for it will serve both  for breakfast and dinner, and perhaps supper too.\"    Aladdin's mother took the lamp and said to her son, \"Here it is, but it  is very dirty; if it were a little cleaner I believe it would bring  something more.\" She took some fine sand and water to clean it; but had  no sooner begun to rub it, than in an instant a hideous genie of  gigantic size appeared before her, and said to her in a voice of  thunder, \"What wouldst thou have? I am ready to obey thee as thy slave,  and the slave of all those who have that lamp in their hands; I and the  other slaves of the lamp.\"    Aladdin's mother, terrified at the sight of the genie, fainted; when  Aladdin, who had seen such a phantom in the cavern, snatched the lamp  out of his mother's hand, and said to the genie boldly, \"I am hungry,  bring me something to eat.\" The genie disappeared immediately, and in an  instant returned with a large silver tray, holding twelve covered dishes  of the same metal, which contained the most delicious viands; six large  white bread cakes on two plates, two flagons of wine, and two silver  cups. All these he placed upon a carpet and disappeared; this was done  before Aladdin's mother recovered from her swoon.    Aladdin had fetched some water, and sprinkled it in her face to recover  her. Whether that or the smell of the meat effected her cure, it was not  long before she came to herself. \"Mother,\" said Aladdin, \"be not afraid:  get up and eat; here is what will put you in heart, and at the same time  satisfy my extreme hunger.\"    His mother was much surprised to see the great tray, twelve dishes, six  loaves, the two flagons and cups, and to smell the savoury odour which  exhaled from the dishes. \"Child,\" said she, \"to whom are we obliged for  this great plenty and liberality? Has the sultan been made acquainted  with our poverty, and had compassion on us?\" \"It is no matter, mother,\"  said Aladdin, \"let us sit down and eat; for you have almost as much need  of a good breakfast as myself; when we have done, I will tell you.\"  Accordingly, both mother and son sat down and ate with the better relish  as the table was so well furnished. But all the time Aladdin's mother  could not forbear looking at and admiring the tray and dishes, though  she could not judge whether they were silver or any other metal, and the  novelty more than the value attracted her attention.    The mother and son sat at breakfast till it was dinner-time, and then  they thought it would be best to put the two meals together; yet, after  this they found they should have enough left for supper, and two meals  for the next day.    When Aladdin's mother had taken away and set by what was left, she went  and sat down by her son on the sofa, saying, \"I expect now that you  should satisfy my impatience, and tell me exactly what passed between  the genie and you while I was in a swoon\"; which he readily complied  with.    She was in as great amazement at what her son told her, as at the  appearance of the genie; and said to him, \"But, son, what have we to do  with genies? I never heard that any of my acquaintance had ever seen  one. How came that vile genie to address himself to me, and not to you,  to whom he had appeared before in the cave?\" \"Mother,\" answered Aladdin,  \"the genie you saw is not the one who appeared to me. If you remember,  he that I first saw called himself the slave of the ring on my finger;  and this you saw, called himself the slave of the lamp you had in your  hand; but I believe you did not hear him, for I think you fainted as  soon as he began to speak.\"    \"What!\" cried the mother, \"was your lamp then the occasion of that  cursed genie's addressing himself rather to me than to you? Ah! my son,  take it out of my sight, and put it where you please. I had rather you  would sell it than run the hazard of being frightened to death again by  touching it; and if you would take my advice, you would part also with  the ring, and not have anything to do with genies, who, as our prophet  has told us, are only devils.\"    \"With your leave, mother,\" replied Aladdin, \"I shall now take care how I  sell a lamp which may be so serviceable both to you and me. That false  and wicked magician would not have undertaken so long a journey to  secure this wonderful lamp if he had not known its value to exceed that  of gold and silver. And since we have honestly come by it, let us make a  profitable use of it, without making any great show, and exciting the  envy and jealousy of our neighbours. However, since the genies frighten  you so much, I will take it out of your sight, and put it where I may  find it when I want it. The ring I cannot resolve to part with; for  without that you had never seen me again; and though I am alive now,  perhaps, if it were gone, I might not be so some moments hence;  therefore, I hope you will give me leave to keep it, and to wear it  always on my finger.\" Aladdin's mother replied that he might do what he  pleased; for her part, she would have nothing to do with genies, and  never say anything more about them.    By the next night they had eaten all the provisions the genie had  brought; and the next day Aladdin, who could not bear the thoughts of  hunger, putting one of the silver dishes tinder his vest, went out early  to sell it, and addressing himself to a Jew whom he met in the streets,  took him aside, and pulling out the plate, asked him if he would buy it.  The cunning Jew took the dish, examined it, and as soon as he found that  it was good silver, asked Aladdin at how much he valued it. Aladdin, who  had never been used to such traffic, told him he would trust to his  judgment and honour. The Jew was somewhat confounded at this plain  dealing; and doubting whether Aladdin understood the material or the  full value of what he offered to sell, took a piece of gold out of his  purse and gave it him, though it was but the sixtieth part of the worth  of the plate. Aladdin, taking the money very eagerly, retired with so  much haste, that the Jew, not content with the exorbitancy of his  profit, was vexed he had not penetrated into his ignorance, and was  going to run after him, to endeavour to get some change out of the piece  of gold; but he ran so fast, and had got so far, that it would have been  impossible for him to overtake him.    Before Aladdin went home, he called at a baker's, bought some cakes of  bread, changed his money, and on his return gave the rest to"]]]
