Therefore, if you would be strong and healthy, have nothing to do with  alcoholic liquors; for                   ALCOHOL POISONS  The stomach,     The liver,       The blood,  The heart,       The lungs,       The brain,  The bones,       The muscles,     The skin,           And every part of the body.           *       *       *       *       *    IN THE STOMACH.    Children who have learned the Lesson on Digestion, and know about the coats  of the stomach, about mastication and chyme-making, are easily made to  understand why anything which has alcohol in it is unfit to go into the  stomach.    If we touch a drop of alcohol to the eye, it will make it sore; so alcohol  in the stomach irritates its coats and makes them sore.    Alcohol poisons the gastric juice. If we get some of this juice from the  stomach of a calf which has just been killed, and mix alcohol with it, the  alcohol will separate the watery part from the _pepsin_ or white part. This  is what alcohol does in the stomach. It takes up water from the gastric  juice, which prevents the pepsin from mixing well with the food, and  hinders the change of the food into chyme, which cannot take place without  pepsin.    The children have already learned that alcohol keeps meat from decaying, or  going to pieces. We explain that food in the stomach must go to pieces to  prepare it to make blood; when mixed with alcohol, it is preserved, and the  gastric juice cannot melt or dissolve it. Thus the stomach is hindered from  doing its work until it gets rid of the alcohol.    A true story we have read will help you to remember how troublesome alcohol  is to the stomach. Some men in Edinburgh were paid their wages, one  Saturday, soon after they had eaten their dinner. They got drunk and  remained so till the next day at noon. When they became sober they had a  headache and were so ill that they sent for a doctor; he gave them some  medicine which brought up their Saturday's dinner just as it had gone down  into the stomach. The poor stomach could do nothing with dinner mixed with  whiskey or rum, because these liquors are half alcohol.    You have already learned that the stomach hurries to drive out the alcohol  into the liver; the liver sends it with the blood into the heart; the heart  pours it into the lungs; the lungs breathe it out through the nose and  mouth, and tell that some kind of alcoholic liquor has been taken into the  stomach.    Remember, that the alcohol which comes out in the breath is a part of that  which _went into the mouth_. It could not be changed. It did nothing but  mischief in its journey, which shows that it is not food, but poison. God,  who created the body, has not given any part of it power to change alcohol  into blood.    People sometimes take ale or wine because they think it gives them an  appetite. This is a great mistake. When any alcoholic liquor goes into the  stomach, there is such hard work to get it out that the pain of hunger is  not felt; when it is out, the stomach is tired and does not tell the brain  that it is hungry. When alcohol is poured into it, day after day, it loses  its desire for good, wholesome food, _and wants more and more alcoholic  liquor_. It has an appetite for alcohol.    Alcohol makes the stomach sore and full of disease; people who take much of  it in liquors always suffer much from dyspepsia.    So, if the stomach could speak, it would say: \"Don't pour any alcohol into  me, though you mix it and call it ale, cider, wine, or any other name that  makes folks think it will do me no harm. You cannot deceive me. I know  alcohol as soon as it comes down, and it always makes me suffer.\"           *       *       *       *       *    BLACKBOARD OUTLINE.    ALCOHOL--        Burns or inflames the coats of the stomach.        Spoils the gastric juice.        Makes the food hard to be dissolved.        Makes the stomach tired and weak.        Takes away the appetite for wholesome food.        Makes an appetite for alcoholic liquors.        Causes disease in the stomach and other digestive organs.           *       *       *       *       *    QUESTION ON BLACKBOARD OUTLINE.    What harm does alcohol do in the stomach?           *       *       *       *       *    TO THE BONES, MUSCLES, AND SKIN.    _TO THE BONES._--You have already learned that the bones require to be  supplied with good blood to make them strong and healthy, and that alcohol  does not make good blood, so we need spend no time in deciding that  alcoholic liquors do injury to the bones, and that the bones of those who  drink these liquors are less likely to heal, when broken, than those of  persons whose blood has not been poisoned by alcohol.    _TO THE MUSCLES._--The muscles, as you know, cover and move the bones; good  blood makes them grow, and keeps them healthy and strong. People like to  have plenty of good muscle, for this not only gives them strength, but  makes them look plump and well.    Alcohol poisons the blood by killing many of the very little, round, red  parts in it, called by a long name, which you can learn if you try. This  hard name is _corpuscles_ [kor'pussls]; _corpuscle_ means _a little body_.    These little bodies float in the fluid portion of the blood, and go to  every part of the body to help keep it alive and healthy. When alcohol  hurts them, they turn into a poor kind of fat, like suet, and cannot do any  good. They stay in different parts and do much harm. Sometimes they lodge  between the muscles, and make a person look strong because plump; but he is  not strong, for his muscles are filled with fat.    Sometimes the liver or the heart, which are only large muscles, become so  heavy and soft with fat that they cannot do their work properly; they  become weak and diseased, wear out, and cause the death of their owner, who  has poisoned them with ale, wine, or other alcoholic drink.    _TO THE SKIN._--Alcohol hurts the skin also, by feeding it with poisoned  blood, by giving the pores extra work in carrying off some of the alcohol  in the perspiration, and by making the little blood-vessels larger than  they should be in a way you will learn more about by and by. These little  blood-vessels become very full of blood, and cause the red face and blue  nose which mark the drinker of alcoholic liquors. This redness of the skin  tells of the mischief which alcohol is doing inside of the body. It is the  danger-signal which warns against the use of the fiery poison.                              ALCOHOL HURTS  THE BONES,              THE MUSCLES,            THE SKIN,  By supplying them with  By supplying them with  By supplying it with  bad blood.              bad blood;              bad blood;                          By loading them with    By over-working the                          fat which makes them    perspiratory pores.                          weak.           *       *       *       *       *    TO THE BLOOD, THE LUNGS, AND THE HEART.    _TO THE BLOOD._--The wonderful fluid which is the life of the body consists  of a water-like liquid in which floats millions of the very little,  circle-shaped, red particles which you have been taught to call  _corpuscles_. You have also been told that alcohol kills these little  bodies, and thus takes some of the life out of the blood, and fills it with  useless, suet-like fat.    The blood, you know, flows everywhere through the body, giving its goodness  to make every part grow and live, and carrying away the worn-out particles  it meets. Blood, when poisoned with alcohol, goes through the body, giving  disease and death instead of health and life. So, if you want good, red  blood, do not let alcohol get into it.    _TO THE HEART._--When alcohol comes with the blood from the liver, the  heart begins to beat fast to get rid of the firewater; this makes it very  tired, for it always has enough to do in carrying bad blood to the lungs,  and pumping good blood into the arteries, without having the extra trouble  of driving out alcohol. Wise people will not give it this extra work to do.    Besides, we told you, in the talk about the harm done by alcohol to the  muscles, that the heart,--which is only a large muscle, or rather many  muscles fastened together so as to make a pear-shaped organ about the size  of your fist,--is hurt in another way by alcohol. It gets too much of the  poor kind of fat from the blood, which fills between the muscles, and after  awhile makes the walls of the heart so soft and weak, that we could almost  push through them with a finger, if we could get at them.    Very often the tired, overworked, weakened heart suddenly stops beating,  and the person who would keep on drinking beer, wine, brandy, or rum falls  down dead. \"Died from heart disease,\" people say, when the truth is, _died  from drinking alcoholic liquors_.    _TO THE LUNGS._--What are the lungs?--\"The breathing-machines of the body.\"  What do they throw out?--\"Bad air.\" What do they take in?--\"Fresh air.\" In  pure air there is a good kind of gas which is necessary to keep us alive;  this gas is called _oxygen_.    When air is taken into the lungs, the oxygen mixes with the blood in them  and makes it pure. If alcohol is in the lungs, it hardens the walls of  their air-cells, and keeps out the oxygen or good gas; at the same time it  keeps in the impure gas, called _nitrogen_, which ought to come out through  the nose and mouth into the air. Thus the blood in the lungs cannot be  properly purified, and goes back to the heart impure blood which is unfit  to be used.    The lungs are also obliged to work faster when alcohol is in them, because  with the heart they are striving to drive out the enemy. This makes the  lungs tired, sore, and inflamed. They are not as strong to do their work,  and are more likely to breathe in any contagious disease than are the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15446"],[0,"Vocal Mastery (#11)"],[1,"nts. At such moments the  listener is impressed with the belief that power and depth of tone are  limitless; that the singer can never come to the end of her resources,  no matter how deeply she may draw on them. There are such moments of  tragic intensity, in her impersonation of the heroine in _Jewels of the  Madonna_, in _Sister Angelica_, in _Norma_, as the avenging priestess,  in which role she has recently created such a remarkable impression.    [Illustration: Rosa Raisa]      A PRIMA DONNA AT HOME    If one has pictured to one's self that because the Russian prima donna  can show herself a whirlwind of dynamic passion on the stage, therefore  she must show some of these qualities in private life, one would quickly  become disabused of such an impression when face to face with the  artist. One would then meet a slender, graceful young woman, of gentle  presence and with the simplest manners in the world. The dark, liquid  eyes look at one with frankness and sincerity; the wide, low brow, from  which the dark hair is softly drawn away, is the brow of a madonna. In  repose the features might easily belong to one of Raphael's saints.  However, they light up genially when their owner speaks.    Mme. Raisa stood in the doorway of her New York apartment, ready to  greet us as we were shown the way to her. Her figure, clad in  close-fitting black velvet, looked especially slender; her manner was  kind and gracious, and we were soon seated in her large, comfortable  salon, deep in conference. Before we had really begun, the singer's pet  dog came bounding to greet us from another room. The tiny creature, a  Mexican terrier, was most affectionate, yet very gentle withal, and  content to quietly cuddle down and listen to the conversation.    \"I will speak somewhat softly,\" began Mme. Raisa, \"since speaking seems  to tire me much more than singing, for what reason I do not know. We  singers must think a little of our physical well being, you see. This  means keeping regular hours, living very simply and taking a moderate  amount of exercise.    \"Yes, I always loved to sing; even as a little child I was constantly  singing. And so I began to have singing lessons when I was eight years  old. Later on I went to Italy and lived there for a number of years,  until I began to travel. I now make my home in Naples. My teacher there  was Madame Marchesio, who was a remarkable singer, musician and  teacher--all three. Even when she reached the advanced age of eighty,  she could still sing wonderfully well. She had the real _bel canto_,  understood the voice, how to use it and the best way to preserve it. I  owe so much to her careful, artistic training; almost everything, I may  say.      THE SINGER'S LIFE    \"One cannot expect to succeed in the profession of music without giving  one's best time and thought to the work of vocal training and all the  other subjects that go with it. A man in business gives his day, or the  most of it, to his office. My time is devoted to my art, and indeed I  have not any too much time to study all the necessary sides of it.    \"During the season, I do regular vocal practice each day and keep the  various roles in review. During the summer I study new parts, for then I  have the time and the quiet. That is what the singer needs--quiet. I  always return to Naples for the vacation, unless I go to South America  and sing there. Then I must have a little rest too, that I may be ready  for the labors of the following season.      VOCAL TRAINING    \"Even during the busiest days technic practice is never neglected.  Vocalizes, scales, terzetta--what you call them--broken thirds, yes, and  long, slow tones in _mezza di voce_, that is, beginning softly, swelling  to loud then gradually diminishing to soft, are part of the daily  regime. One cannot omit these things if one would always keep in  condition and readiness. When at work in daily study, I sing softly, or  with medium tone quality; I do not use full voice except occasionally,  when I am going through a part and wish to try out certain effects.      \"ONE VOICE\"    \"I was trained first as a coloratura and taught to do all the old  Italian operas of Bellini, Rosini, Donizetti and the rest of the florid  Italian school. This gives the singer a thorough, solid training--the  sort of training that requires eight or ten years to accomplish. But  this is not too much time to give, if one wishes to be thoroughly  prepared to sing all styles of music. In former days, when singers  realized the necessity of being prepared in this way, there existed I  might say--_one voice;_ for the soprano voice was trained to sing both  florid and dramatic music. But in these days sopranos are divided into  High, Lyric, Coloratura and Dramatic; singers choose which of these  lines seems to suit best their voice and temperament.      COLORATURA AND DRAMATIC    \"It is of advantage to the singer to be trained in both these arts. In  the smaller opera houses of Italy, a soprano, if thus trained, can sing  _Lucia_ one night and _Norma_ the next; _Traviata_ one night and  _Trovatore_ the next.    \"Modern Italian opera calls for the dramatic soprano. She must be an  actress just as well as a singer. She must be able to express in both  voice and gesture intense passion and emotion. It is the period of storm  and stress. Coloratura voices have not so much opportunity at the  present time, unless they are quite out of the ordinary. And yet, for  me, a singer who has mastery of the beautiful art of _bel canto,_ is a  great joy. Galli-Curci's art is the highest I know of. For me she is the  greatest singer. Melba also is wonderful. I have heard her often--she  has been very kind to me. When I hear her sing an old Italian air, with  those pure, bell-like tones of hers, I am lifted far up; I feel myself  above the sky.      DO NOT YIELD TO DISCOURAGEMENT    \"The younger singer need not yield to discouragement, for she must know  from the start, that the mastery of a great art like singing is a long  and arduous task. If the work seems too difficult at times, do not give  up or say 'I cannot.' If I had done that, I should have really given up  many times. Instead I say; 'I can do it, and not only I can but I will!'      MUSICIANSHIP    \"There are so many sides to the singer's equipment, besides singing  itself\"; and Mme. Raisa lifted dark eyes and spread out her graceful  hands as though to indicate the bigness of the subject. \"Yes, there is  the piano, for instance; the singer is much handicapped without a  knowledge of that instrument, for it not only provides accompaniment but  cultivates the musical sense. Of course I have learned the piano and I  consider it necessary for the singer.    \"Then there are languages. Be not content with your own, though that  language must be perfectly learned and expressed, but learn others.\"    \"You of course speak several languages?\" questioned the listener.    \"Yes, I speak eight,\" she answered modestly. \"Russian, of course, for I  am Russian; then French, Italian, German, Spanish, Polish, Roumanian and  English. Besides these I am familiar with a few dialects.      HAVE PATIENCE    \"So many young singers are so impatient; they want to prepare themselves  in three or four years for a career,\" and Madame frowned her  disapproval. \"Perhaps they may come before the public after that length  of time spent in study; but they will only know a part--a little of all  they ought to know. With a longer time, conscientiously used, they would  be far better equipped. The singer who spends nine or ten years in  preparation, who is trained to sing florid parts as well as those which  are dramatic--she indeed can sing anything, the music of the old school  as well as of the new. In Rome I gave a recital of old music, assisted  by members of the Sistine Chapel choir. We gave much old music, some of  it dating from the sixth century.    \"Do I always feel the emotions I express when singing a role? Yes, I can  say that I endeavor to throw myself absolutely into the part I am  portraying; but that I always do so with equal success cannot be  expected. So many unforeseen occurrences may interfere, which the  audience can never know or consider. One may not be exactly in the mood,  or in the best of voice; the house may not be a congenial space, or the  audience is unsympathetic. But if all is propitious and the audience  with you--then you are lifted up and carry every one with you. Then you  are inspired and petty annoyances are quite forgotten.      VOCAL MASTERY    \"You ask a very difficult question when you ask of what vocal mastery  consists. If I have developed perfect control throughout the two and a  half octaves of my voice, can make each tone with pure quality and  perfect evenness in the different degrees of loud and soft, and if I  have perfect breath control as well, I then have an equipment that may  serve all purposes of interpretation.    \"Together with vocal mastery must go the art of interpretation, in which  all the mastery of the vocal equipment may find expression. In order to  interpret adequately one ought to possess a perfect instrument,  perfectly trained. When this is the case one can forget mechanism,  because confident of the ability to express whatever emotion is  desired.\"    \"Have you a message which may be carried to the young singers?\" she was  asked.    \"Tell them to have patience--patience to work and patience to wait for  results. Vocal mastery is not a thing that can be quickly accomplished;  it is not the work of weeks and months, but of years of consistent,  constant effort. It cannot be hurried, but must grow with one's growth,  both mentally and physically. But the reward of earnest effort is sure  to come!\"        X    =LOUISE HOMER=    THE REQUIREMENTS OF A MUSICAL CAREER      Madame Louise Homer is a native artist to whom every loyal American can  point with pardonable pride.
