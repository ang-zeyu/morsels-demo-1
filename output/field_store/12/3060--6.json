Descubrio desde      alli los cuerpos de los Santos marterizados en los patibulos y      atravesados con los palos, mando los quemasen todos paraque no      quedase reliquia cumpliose luego la ordsa; pero aquel impio      probo bien presto los rigores de la venganza divina que volvia      por la sangre derramada de sus Santos. Improvisamente se le      pego la lengua al paladar y fauces: cerrossle la boca, y no      pudo pronunciar una palabra, ni dar un gemido. Conduxeronle,      sus criados a la cama, murio aguella misma noche, y antes de      apagarse las hoqueras en que ardian los santos cuerpos, entro      la infeliz alma de Abderramen en los etemos fuegos del      infierno.\"    He was succeeded by Mohammed I. (852-886), a less capable and more  bigoted ruler than his father. No sooner was he on the throne than  Emila, a deacon, and Jeremiah a priest of St Cyprian's church, near  Cordova, following in the footsteps of so many predecessors, came  before the Kadi, and reviled Mohammed,--the former being enabled to do  this with the more point and effect, as he was to a remarkable degree  master of the Arabic language.[1] Emila and Jeremiah won the prize they  coveted, and were put to death (September 15, 852). The customary  prodigy occurred after the execution, in describing which the pious  Eulogius breaks into metre, saying, \"Athletas cecidisse pios elementa  fatentur.\"    On the following day occurred an outrage which the most bigoted  partizans of the martyrs must have blushed to record. Two eunuchs,  Rogel, a monk of Parapanda, near Elvira, and Servio Deo, a eunuch of  foreign extraction, forced their way into a mosque, and by way of  preaching--as they said--to the assembled worshippers, they reviled  their Prophet and their religion. [2] Being set upon and nearly torn in  pieces by the infuriated congregation, they were rescued by the Kadi,  who imprisoned them till such time as their sentence should be declared.  They were condemned to have their hands and feet cut off, and be  beheaded; which sentence was carried into effect.[3]        [1] Eulog., \"Mem. Sanct,\" ii. c. xii. Arabic boasts a larger      vocabulary of abuse than most languages: see the account of      Prof. Palmer's death in his Life by Besant.        [2] _Ibid._, c. xiii. secs. 1, 2.        [3] Eul. (1.1), adds: \"Et ipsa gentilitas tali spectaculo      stupefacta nescio quid de Christianismo indulgentius      sentiebat.\"    Upon this fresh provocation the fury and apprehension of the king knew  no bounds. He might well be pardoned for thinking that this defiance of  the laws, and religious fanaticism, could only mean a widespread  disaffection and conspiracy against the Moslem rule. In fact, as we  shall see, the Christians of Toledo raised the banner of revolt in  favour of their Cordovan brethren at this very time. Mohammed therefore  seems to have meditated a real persecution, such as should extirpate  Christianity in his dominions.[1] He is said even to have given orders  for a general massacre of the males among the Christians, and for the  slavery, or worse, of the women, if they did not apostatize.[2] But the  dispassionate advice of his councillors saved the king from this crime.  They pointed out that no men of any intelligence, education, or rank  among the Christians had taken part in the doings of the zealots, and  that the whole body of Christians ought not to be cut off, since their  actions were not directed by any individual leader. Other advisers seem  to have diverted the king from his project of a wholesale massacre by  encouraging him to proceed legally against the Christians with the  utmost rigour, and by this means to cow them into submission.[3]    These strong measures apparently produced some effect, for no other  executions are recorded for a period of nine months; when Fandila, a  priest of Tabanos,[4] and chosen by the monks of St Salvator's monastery  to be one of their spiritual overseers, came forward and reviled the  Prophet: whereupon he was imprisoned and subsequently beheaded (June 13,  853). His fate awakened the dormant fanaticism of Anastasius,[5] a  priest of St Acislus' church; of Felix, a Gaetulian monk of Alcala de  Henares; and of Digna, a virgin of St Elizabeth's nunnery at Tabanos  (the latter being strengthened in her resolve by a celestial vision),  who, pursuing the usual plan, are beheaded the following day; their  example being followed by Benildis, a matron (June 15).[6]        [1] Eulog., \"Mem. Sanct,\" ii. c. xii. \"Non iam solummodo de      mortibus resistentium sibi excogitare coepenint, verum etiam      totam extirpare ecclesiam ruminarunt. Quoniam nimio terrore tot      hominim recurrentium ad martyrium concussa gentilitas regni sui      arbitrabatur imminere excidium, cum tali etiam praecinctos      virtute parvulos videret.\" A similar project is attributed      (mistakenly, without doubt) to Abdurrahman.        [2] _Ibid._, iii. c. vii. sec. 4. \"Iusserat enim omnes      Christianos generali sententia perdere, feminasque publico      distractu disperdere.\" Cp. also Alvar, Life of Eul., iv. 12.      \"Rex Mahomad incredibili rabie et effrenata sententia      Christicolum genus del ere funditus cogitabat.\"        [3] _Ibid._ \"Multi insaniam modificare nitentes per trucem      voluntatis iniquae officium diversis et exquisitis occasionibus      gregem Christi impetere tentaverunt.\"        [4] _Ibid._ iii. c. vii. secs. 1, 2. Fleury, v. 520, says he      was a monk of Guadix.        [5] _Ibid._, ch. viii. secs. 1, 2.        [6] Eulog., \"Mem. Sanct.,\" iii. ch. ix.    The cloisters of Tabanos had furnished so many fanatics that the  Government now suppressed the place, removing the nuns and shutting them  up to prevent others giving themselves up.[1] One of these however,  Columba,[2] sister of Elizabeth and of the abbot Martin, contrived to  escape. This Columba had persisted in remaining a virgin, in spite of  her mother's efforts to make her marry, which only ceased when the  mother died. She now gave herself up and was beheaded (September 17).    Just one month later Pomposa,[3] from the monastery of St Salvator,  Pegnamellar, suffered the same fate. Then there was a pause in these  executions, which was not broken till July 11th of the following year,  when Abundius, a priest, was martyred. He seems to have really deserved  the name of martyr, for he was given up to the authorities by the  treachery of others,[4] and did not seek martyrdom.    Another similar period elapsed before Amator, a priest of Tucci  (Tejada); Peter, a monk of Cordova; and Ludovic, a brother of Paul, the  deacon, beheaded four years before, shared the same fate (April 30,  855).[5]    After nearly a year Witesindus, a repentant renegade; Elias, an old  priest of Lusitania; and Paul and Isidore, young monks, gave themselves  up to execution[6] (April 17, 856.) In June of that year a more  venerable victim was, like Abundius, betrayed to his destruction. This  was Argimirus, an old monk, once Censor of Cordova (June 28).[7] Exactly  one month later Aurea, a virgin and sister of the brothers John and  Adulphus, whose martyrdom has been already mentioned, was brought before  the magistrate. Descended from one of the noblest Arab families,[8] she  had long been left unmolested, though her apostasy to Christianity was  well known. She was now frightened into temporary submission; but soon  repenting of her compliance, and avowing herself truly a Christian, she  gained a martyr's crown (July 29).

Ruderic,[1] a priest, whose brother was a Moslem, unadvisedly intervened  as a peacemaker, in a quarrel, in which his brother was engaged. With  the usual fate of peacemakers, he was set upon by both parties, and  nearly killed. In fact his brother supposed him to be quite dead, and  had the body carried through the town, proclaiming that his brother had  become a Mussulman before his death.[2] However, Ruderic recovered, and  made his escape, but being obliged to return to Cordova, met his  brother, who immediately brought him before the Kadi on a charge of  apostasy. His life and liberty were promised to him if he would only  acknowledge that Christ was merely man, and that Mohammed was the  messenger of God. On refusing, he is imprisoned, and finds in prison a  certain Salomon, also charged with apostasy from Islam. The two  fellow-prisoners contract a great friendship and are consequently  separated. After a third exhortation, they are condemned to death, but  not before the judge had done his best to bribe them to forego their  purpose by offers of honour and rewards.[3] They were executed March 13,  857, and their bodies thrown into the river--even the stones sprinkled  with their blood being taken up and cast into the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15263"],[0,"The Underground Railroad (#11)"],[1,"are somewhat uneasy because the  goods did not come safe to hand on Monday evening, as you  expected--consigned from Harrisburg to you.

LETTER FROM \"WM. PENN\" (OF THE BAR).      WASHINGTON, D.C., Dec. 9th, 1856.    DEAR SIR:--I was unavoidably prevented yesterday, from replying to yours  of 6th instant, and although I have made inquiries, I am unable  _to-day_, to answer your questions satisfactorily. Although I know some  of the residents of Loudon county, and have often visited there, still I  have not practiced much in the Courts of that county. There are several  of my acquaintances here, who have lived in that county, and _possibly_,  through my assistance, your commissions might be executed. If a better  way shall not suggest itself to you, and you see fit to give me the  _facts_ in the case, I can better judge of my ability to help you; _but  I know not the man resident there, whom I would trust with an important  suit_. I think it is now some four or five weeks since, that some  packages left this vicinity, said to be from fifteen to twenty in  number, and as I suppose, went through your hands. It was at a time of  uncommon vigilance here, and to me it was a matter of extreme wonder,  _how and through whom_, such a work was accomplished. Can you tell me?  It is _needful_ that I should know! Not for curiosity merely, but for  the good of others. An enclosed slip contains the _marks_ of one of the  packages, which you will read and then _immediately burn_.    If you can give me any light that will _benefit others_, I am sure you  will do so.    A traveler here, _very reliable_, and who knows his business, has  determined not to leave home again till spring, at least not without  extraordinary temptations.    I think, however, he or others, might be tempted to travel in Virginia.    Yours,    WM. P.        LETTER FROM MISS THEODOCIA GILBERT.            SKANEATELES (GLEN HAVEN) CHUY., 1851.        WILLIAM STILL:--_Dear Friend and Brother_--A thousand thanks for      your good, generous letter!        It was so kind of you to have in mind my intense interest and      anxiety in the success and fate of poor Concklin! That he      desired and intended to hazard an attempt of the kind, I well      understood; but what particular one, or that he had actually      embarked in the enterprise, I had not been able to learn.        His memory will ever be among the sacredly cherished with me. He      certainly displayed more real disinterestedness, more earnest,      unassuming devotedness, than those who _claim_ to be the      sincerest friends of the slave can often boast. What more      _Saviour_-like than the _willing_ sacrifice he has rendered!        Never shall I forget that night of our extremest peril (as we      supposed), when he came and so heartily proffered his services      at the hazard of his liberty, of life even, in behalf of William      L. Chaplin.        _Such_ generosity! at _such_ a moment! The emotions it awakened      no words can bespeak! They are to be sought but in the inner      chambers of one's own soul! He as earnestly devised the means,      as calmly counted the cost, and as unshrinkingly turned him to      the task, as if it were his own freedom he would have won.        Through his homely features, and humble garb, the intrepidity of      soul came out in all its lustre! Heroism, in its native majesty,      _commanded_ one's admiration and love!        Most truly can I enter into your sorrows, and painfully      appreciate the pang of disappointment which must have followed      this sad intelligence. But so inadequate are words to the      consoling of such griefs, it were almost cruel to attempt to      syllable one's sympathies.        I cannot bear to believe, that Concklin has been actually      murdered, and yet I hardly dare hope it is otherwise.        And the poor slaves, for whom he periled so much, into what      depths of hopelessness and woe are they again plunged! But the      deeper and blacker for the loss of their dearly sought and      new-found freedom. How long must wrongs like these go      unredressed? \"_How long, O God, how long_?\"        Very truly yours,        THEODOCIA GILBERT.          WILLIAM PEEL, ALIAS WILLIAM BOX PEEL JONES.      ARRIVED PER ERRICSON LINE OF STEAMERS, WRAPPED IN STRAW AND BOXED UP,      APRIL, 1859.      William is twenty-five years of age, unmistakably colored, good-looking,  rather under the medium size, and of pleasing manners. William had  himself boxed up by a near relative and forwarded by the Erricson line  of steamers. He gave the slip to Robert H. Carr, his owner (a grocer and  commission merchant), after this wise, and for the following reasons:  For some time previous his master had been selling off his slaves every  now and then, the same as other groceries, and this admonished William  that he was liable to be in the market any day; consequently, he  preferred the box to the auction-block.    He did not complain of having been treated very badly by Carr, but felt  that no man was safe while owned by another. In fact, he \"hated the very  name of slaveholder.\" The limit of the box not admitting of  straightening himself out he was taken with the cramp on the road,  suffered indescribable misery, and had his faith taxed to the  utmost,--indeed was brought to the very verge of \"screaming aloud\" ere  relief came. However, he controlled himself, though only for a short  season, for before a great while an excessive faintness came over him.  Here nature became quite exhausted. He thought he must \"die;\" but his  time had not yet come. After a severe struggle he revived, but only to  encounter a third ordeal no less painful than the one through which he  had just passed. Next a very \"cold chill\" came over him, which seemed  almost to freeze the very blood in his veins and gave him intense agony,  from which he only found relief on awaking, having actually fallen  asleep in that condition. Finally, however, he arrived at Philadelphia,  on a steamer, Sabbath morning. A devoted friend of his, expecting him,  engaged a carriage and repaired to the wharf for the box. The bill of  lading and the receipt he had with him, and likewise knew where the box  was located on the boat. Although he well knew freight was not usually  delivered on Sunday, yet his deep solicitude for the safety of his  friend determined him to do all that lay in his power to rescue him from  his perilous situation. Handing his bill of lading to the proper officer  of the boat, he asked if he could get the freight that it called for.  The officer looked at the bill and said, \"No, we do not deliver freight  on Sunday;\" but, noticing the anxiety of the man, he asked him if he  would know it if he were"]]]
