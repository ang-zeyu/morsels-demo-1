Women were  weeping, men were cursing, and the magistrates were sitting in Council  over what was to be done. But none could suggest a plan. Then Jack,  blithe and gay, went up to the magistrates, and with a fine  courtesy--for he was ever polite--asked them what reward would be given  to him who killed the giant Cormoran.    \"The treasures of the Giant's Cave,\" quoth they.    \"Every whit of it?\" quoth Jack, who was never to be done.    \"To the last farthing,\" quoth they.    \"Then will I undertake the task,\" said Jack, and forthwith set about the  business.    It was winter-time, and having got himself a horn, a pickaxe, and a  shovel, he went over to the Mount in the dark evening, set to work, and  before dawn he had dug a pit, no less than twenty-two feet deep and nigh  as big across. This he covered with long thin sticks and straw,  sprinkling a little loose mould over all to make it look like solid  ground. So, just as dawn was breaking, he planted himself fair and  square on the side of the pit that was farthest from the giant's cave,  raised the horn to his lips, and with full blast sounded:                        \"Tantivy! Tantivy! Tantivy!\"    just as he would have done had he been hunting a fox.    Of course this woke the giant, who rushed in a rage out of his cave, and  seeing little Jack, fair and square blowing away at his horn, as calm  and cool as may be, he became still more angry, and made for the  disturber of his rest, bawling out, \"I'll teach you to wake a giant, you  little whipper-snapper. You shall pay dearly for your tantivys, I'll  take you and broil you whole for break--\"    He had only got as far as this when crash--he fell into the pit! So  there was a break indeed; such an one that it caused the very  foundations of the Mount to shake.    But Jack shook with laughter. \"Ho, ho!\" he cried, \"how about breakfast  now, Sir Giant? Will you have me broiled or baked? And will no diet  serve you but poor little Jack? Faith! I've got you in Lob's pound now!  You're in the stocks for bad behaviour, and I'll plague you as I like.  Would I had rotten eggs; but this will do as well.\" And with that he up  with his pickaxe and dealt the giant Cormoran such a most weighty knock  on the very crown of his head, that he killed him on the spot.    Whereupon Jack calmly filled up the pit with earth again and went to  search the cave, where he found much treasure.    Now when the magistrates heard of Jack's great exploit, they proclaimed  that henceforth he should be known as--    JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.    And they presented him with a sword and belt, on which these words were  embroidered in gold:      Here's the valiant Cornishman    Who slew the giant Cormoran.      II    Of course the news of Jack's victory soon spread over all England, so  that another giant named Blunderbore who lived to the north, hearing of  it, vowed if ever he came across Jack he would be revenged upon him. Now  this giant Blunderbore was lord of an enchanted castle that stood in the  middle of a lonesome forest.    It so happened that Jack, about four months after he had killed  Cormoran, had occasion to journey into Wales, and on the road he passed  this forest. Weary with walking, and finding a pleasant fountain by the  wayside, he lay down to rest and was soon fast asleep.    Now the giant Blunderbore, coming to the well for water, found Jack  sleeping, and knew by the lines embroidered on his belt that here was  the far-famed giant-killer. Rejoiced at his luck, the giant, without  more ado, lifted Jack to his shoulder and began to carry him through the  wood to the enchanted castle.    But the rustling of the boughs awakened Jack, who, finding himself  already in the clutches of the giant, was terrified; nor was his alarm  decreased by seeing the courtyard of the castle all strewn with men's  bones.    \"Yours will be with them ere long,\" said Blunderbore as he locked poor  Jack into an immense chamber above the castle gateway. It had a  high-pitched, beamed roof, and one window that looked down the road.  Here poor Jack was to stay while Blunderbore went to fetch his  brother-giant, who lived in the same wood, that he might share in the  feast.    Now, after a time, Jack, watching through the window, saw the two giants  tramping hastily down the road, eager for their dinner.    \"Now,\" quoth Jack to himself, \"my death or my deliverance is at hand.\"  For he had thought out a plan. In one corner of the room he had seen two  strong cords. These he took, and making a cunning noose at the end of  each, he hung them out of the window, and, as the giants were unlocking  the iron door of the gate, managed to slip them over their heads without  their noticing it. Then, quick as thought, he tied the other ends to a  beam, so that as the giants moved on the nooses tightened and throttled  them until they grew black in the face. Seeing this, Jack slid down the  ropes, and drawing his sword, slew them both.    So, taking the keys of the castle, he unlocked all the doors and set  free three beauteous ladies who, tied by the hair of their heads, he  found almost starved to death. \"Sweet ladies,\" quoth Jack, kneeling on  one knee--for he was ever polite--\"here are the keys of this enchanted  castle. I have destroyed the giant Blunderbore and his brutish brother,  and thus have restored to you your liberty. These keys should bring you  all else you require.\"    So saying he proceeded on his journey to Wales.      III    He travelled as fast as he could; perhaps too fast, for, losing his way,  he found himself benighted and far from any habitation. He wandered on  always in hopes, until on entering a narrow valley he came on a very  large, dreary-looking house standing alone. Being anxious for shelter he  went up to the door and knocked. You may imagine his surprise and alarm  when the summons was answered by a giant with two heads. But though this  monster's look was exceedingly fierce, his manners were quite polite;  the truth being that he was a Welsh giant, and as such double-faced and  smooth, given to gaining his malicious ends by a show of false  friendship.    So he welcomed Jack heartily in a strong Welsh accent, and prepared a  bedroom for him, where he was left with kind wishes for a good rest.  Jack, however, was too tired to sleep well, and as he lay awake, he  overheard his host muttering to himself in the next room. Having very  keen ears he was able to make out these words, or something like them:      \"Though here you lodge with me this night,     You shall not see the morning light.     My club shall dash your brains outright.\"    \"Say'st thou so!\" quoth Jack to himself, starting up at once, \"So that  is your Welsh trick, is it? But I will be even with you.\" Then, leaving  his bed, he laid a big billet of wood among the blankets, and taking one  of these to keep himself warm, made himself snug in a corner of the  room, pretending to snore, so as to make Mr. Giant think he was asleep.    And sure enough, after a little time, in came the monster on tiptoe as  if treading on eggs, and carrying a big club. Then--      WHACK! WHACK! WHACK!    Jack could hear the bed being belaboured until the Giant, thinking every  bone of his guest's skin must be broken, stole out of the room again;  whereupon Jack went calmly to bed once more and slept soundly! Next  morning the giant couldn't believe his eyes when he saw Jack coming down  the stairs fresh and hearty.    \"Odds splutter hur nails!\" he cried, astonished. \"Did she sleep well?  Was there not nothing felt in the night?\"    \"Oh,\" replied Jack, laughing in his sleeve, \"I think a rat did come and  give me two or three flaps of his tail.\"    [Illustration: Taking the keys of the castle, Jack unlocked all the doors]    [Illustration: \"Odds splutter hur nails!\" cried the giant, not to be  outdone. \"Hur can do that hurself!\"]    On this the giant was dumbfoundered, and led Jack to breakfast, bringing  him a bowl which held at least four gallons of hasty-pudding, and  bidding him, as a man of such mettle, eat the lot. Now Jack when  travelling wore under his cloak a leathern bag to carry his things  withal; so, quick as thought, he hitched this round in front with the  opening just under his chin; thus, as he ate, he could slip the best  part of the pudding into it without the giant's being any the wiser. So  they sate down to breakfast, the giant gobbling down his own measure of  hasty-pudding, while Jack made away with his.    \"See,\" says crafty Jack when he had finished. \"I'll show you a trick  worth two of yours,\" and with that he up with a carving-knife and,  ripping up the leathern bag, out fell all the hasty-pudding on the  floor!    \"Odds splutter hur nails!\" cried the giant, not to be outdone. \"Hur can  do that hurself!\" Whereupon he seized the carving-knife, and ripping  open his own belly fell down dead.    Thus was Jack quit of the Welsh giant.      IV    Now it so happened that in those days, when gallant knights were always  seeking adventures, King Arthur's only son, a very valiant Prince,  begged of his father a large sum of money to enable him to journey to  Wales, and there strive to set free a certain beautiful lady who was  possessed by seven evil spirits. In vain the King denied him; so at last  he gave way and the Prince set out with two horses, one of which he  rode, the other laden with gold pieces. Now after some days' journey the  Prince came to a market-town in Wales where there was a great commotion.  On asking the reason for it he was told that, according to law, the  corpse of a very generous man had been arrested on its way to the grave,  because, in life, it had owed large sums to the money-lenders.    \"That is a cruel law,\" said the young Prince. \"Go, bury the dead in  peace, and let the creditors come to my lodgings; I will pay the debts  of the dead."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17071"],[0,"Folk-Lore and Legends: Scotland (#11)"],[1," Jock carried them a' day, and got a sock, which he  stuck in his bonnet.  On the way hame, Jock was dry, and gaed away to  take a drink out o' the burn; and wi' the weight o' the sock, his bonnet  fell into the river, and gaed out o' sight.  He gaed hame, and his mither  says, \"Weel, Jock, what hae you been doing a' day?\"  And then he tells  her.  \"Hout,\" quo' she, \"you should hae tied the string to it, and  trailed it behind you.\"  \"Weel,\" quo' Jock, \"I'll mind that again.\"    Awa' he sets, and he fa's in wi' a flesher.  \"Weel,\" says the flesher,  \"if ye'll be my servant a' day, I'll gie ye a leg o' mutton at night.\"  \"I'll be that,\" quo' Jock.  He got a leg o' mutton at night.  He ties a  string to it, and trails it behind him the hale road hame.  \"What hae ye  been doing?\" said his mither.  He tells her.  \"Hout, you fool, ye should  hae carried it on your shouther.\"  \"I'll mind that again,\" quo' Jock.    Awa' he gaes next day, and meets a horse-dealer.  He says, \"If you will  help me wi' my horses a' day, I'll give you ane to yoursel' at night.\"  \"I'll do that,\" quo' Jock.  So he served him, and got his horse, and he  ties its feet; but as he was not able to carry it on his back, he left it  lying on the roadside.  Hame he comes, and tells his mither.  \"Hout, ye  daft gowk, ye'll ne'er turn wise!  Could ye no hae loupen on it, and  ridden it?\"  \"I'll mind that again,\" quo' Jock.    Aweel, there was a grand gentleman, wha had a daughter wha was very  subject to melancholy; and her father gae out that whaever should mak'  her laugh would get her in marriage.  So it happened that she was sitting  at the window ae day, musing in her melancholy state, when Jock,  according to the advice o' his mither, cam' flying up on a cow's back,  wi' the tail over his shouther.  And she burst out into a fit o'  laughter.  When they made inquiry wha made her laugh, it was found to be  Jock riding on the cow.  Accordingly, Jock was sent for to get his bride.  Weel, Jock was married to her, and there was a great supper prepared.  Amongst the rest o' the things, there was some honey, which Jock was very  fond o'.  After supper, they all retired, and the auld priest that  married them sat up a' night by the kitchen fireside.  So Jock waukens in  the night-time, and says, \"Oh, wad ye gie me some o' yon nice sweet honey  that we got to our supper last night?\"  \"Oh ay,\" says his wife, \"rise and  gang into the press, and ye'll get a pig fou o 't.\"  Jock rose, and  thrust his hand into the honey-pig for a nievefu' o 't, and he could not  get it out.  So he cam' awa' wi' the pig in his hand, like a mason's  mell, and says, \"Oh, I canna get my hand out.\"  \"Hoot,\" quo' she, \"gang  awa' and break it on the cheek-stane.\"  By this time, the fire was dark,  and the auld priest was lying snoring wi' his head against the chimney-  piece, wi' a huge white wig on.  Jock gaes awa', and gae him a whack wi'  the honey-pig on the head, thinking it was the cheek-stane, and knocks it  a' in bits.  The auld priest roars out, \"Murder!\"  Jock tak's doun the  stair as hard as he could bicker, and hides himsel' amang the bees'  skeps.    That night, as luck wad have it, some thieves cam' to steal the bees'  skeps, and in the hurry o' tumbling them into a large grey plaid, they  tumbled Jock in alang wi' them.  So aff they set, wi' Jock and the skeps  on their backs.  On the way, they had to cross the burn where Jock lost  his bonnet.  Ane o' the thieves cries, \"Oh, I hae fand a bonnet!\" and  Jock, on hearing that, cries out, \"Oh, that's mine!\"  They thocht they  had got the deil on their backs.  So they let a' fa' in the burn; and  Jock, being tied in the plaid, couldna get out; so he and the bees were  a' drowned thegither.    If a' tales be true, that's nae lee.          SAINT COLUMBA.      Soon after Saint Columba established his residence in Iona, tradition  says that he paid a visit to a great seminary of Druids, then in the  vicinity, at a place called Camusnan Ceul, or Bay of Cells, in the  district of Ardnamurchan.  Several remains of Druidical circles are still  to be seen there, and on that bay and the neighbourhood many places are  still named after their rites and ceremonies; such as _Ardintibert_, the  Mount of Sacrifice, and others.  The fame of the Saint had been for some  time well known to the people, and his intention of instructing them in  the doctrines of Christianity was announced to them.  The ancient  priesthood made every exertion to dissuade the inhabitants from hearing  the powerful eloquence of Columba, and in this they were seconded by the  principal man then in that country, whose name was Donald, a son of  Connal.    The Saint had no sooner made his appearance, however, than he was  surrounded by a vast multitude, anxious to hear so celebrated a preacher;  and after the sermon was ended, many persons expressed a desire to be  baptized, in spite of the remonstrances of the Druids.  Columba had made  choice of an eminence centrally situated for performing worship; but  there was no water near the spot, and the son of Connal threatened with  punishment any who should dare to procure it for his purpose.  The Saint  stood with his back leaning on a rock; after a short prayer, he struck  the rock with his foot, and a stream of water issued forth in great  abundance.  The miracle had a powerful effect on the minds of his  hearers, and many became converts to the new religion.  This fountain is  still distinguished by the name of Columba, and is considered of superior  efficacy in the cure of diseases.  When the Catholic form of worship  prevailed in that country it was greatly resorted to, and old persons yet  remember to have seen offerings left at the fountain in gratitude for  benefits received from the benignant influence of the Saint's blessing on  the water.  At length it is said that a daughter of Donald, the son of  Connal, expressed a wish to be baptized, and the father restrained her by  violence.  He also, with the aid of the Druids, forced Columba to take  refuge in his boat, and the holy man departed for Iona, after warning the  inhospitable Caledonian to prepare for another world, as his life would  soon terminate.    The Saint was at sea during the whole night, which was stormy; and when  approaching the shores of his own sacred island the following morning, a  vast number of ravens were observed flying over the boat, chasing another  of extraordinary large size.  The croaking of the ravens awoke the Saint,  who had been sleeping; and he instantly exclaimed that the son of Connal  had just expired, which was afterwards ascertained to be true.    A very large Christian establishment appears to have been afterwards  formed in the Bay of Cells; and the remains of a chapel, dedicated to  Saint Kiaran, are still to be seen there.  It is the favourite place of  interment among the Catholics of this day.  Indeed, Columba and many of  his successors seem to have adopted the policy of engrafting their  institutions on those which had formerly existed in the country.  Of this  there are innumerable instances, at least we observe the ruins of both  still visible in many places; even in Iona we find the burying-ground of  the Druids known at the present day.  This practice may have had  advantages at the time, but it must have been ultimately productive of  many corruptions; and, in a great measure, accounts for many  superstitious and absurd customs which prevailed among that people to a  very recent period, and which are not yet entirely extinct.  In a very  ancient family in that country two round balls of coarse glass have been  carefully preserved from time immemorial, and to these have been ascribed  many virtues--amongst others, the cure of any extraordinary disease among  cattle.  The balls were immersed in cold water for three days and nights,  and the water was afterwards sprinkled over all the cattle; this was  expected to cure those affected, and to prevent the disease in the rest.  From the names and appearance of these balls, there is no doubt that they  had been symbols used by the Archdruids.    Within a short distance of the Bay of Cells there is a cave very  remarkable in its appearance, and still more so from the purposes to  which it has been appropriated.  Saint Columba, on one of his many  voyages among the Hebrides, was benighted on this rocky coast, and the  mariners were alarmed for their own safety.  The Saint assured them that  neither he nor his crew would ever be drowned.  They unexpectedly  discovered a light at no great distance, and to that they directed their  course.  Columba's boat consisted of a frame of osiers, which was covered  with hides of leather, and it was received into a very narrow creek close  to this cave.  After returning thanks for their escape, the Saint and his  people had great difficulty in climbing up to the cave, which is elevated  considerably above sea.  They at length got sight of the fire which had  first attracted their attention.  Several persons sat around it, and  their appearance was not much calculated to please the holy man.  Their  aspects were fierce, and they had on the fire some flesh roasting over  the coals.  The Saint gave them his benediction; and he was invited to  sit down among them and to share their hurried repast, with which he  gladly complied.  They were freebooters, who lived by plunder and  robbery, and this Columba soon discovered.  He advised them to forsake  that course, and to be converted to his doctrines, to which they all  assented, and in the morning they accompanied the Saint on his voyage  homeward.  This circumstance created a high veneration for the cave among  the disciples and successors of Columba, and that veneration still  continues, in some degree.  In one side of it there was a cleft of the  rock, where lay the water with which the freebooters had been baptized;  and this was afterwards formed by art into a basin, which is"]]]
