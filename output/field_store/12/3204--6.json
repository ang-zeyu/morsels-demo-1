When on the farther side of the sun--i.e., in conjunction with  the sun as seen from the earth--Mars's average distance from us is about  235,000,000 miles. In consequence of these great changes in its  distance, Mars is sometimes a very conspicuous object in the sky, and at  other times inconspicuous.    The similarity in the inclination of the axis of the two planets results  in a close resemblance between the seasons on Mars and on the earth,  although, owing to the greater length of its year, Mars's seasons are  much longer than ours. Winter and summer visit in succession its  northern and southern hemispheres just as occurs on the planet that we  inhabit, and the torrid, temperate, and frigid zones on its surface have  nearly the same angular width as on the earth. In this respect Mars is  the first of the foreign planets we have studied to resemble the earth.    Around each of its poles appears a circular white patch, which visibly  expands when winter prevails upon it, and rapidly contracts, sometimes  almost completely disappearing, under a summer sun. From the time of  Sir William Herschel the almost universal belief among astronomers has  been that these gleaming polar patches on Mars are composed of snow and  ice, like the similar glacial caps of the earth, and no one can look at  them with a telescope and not feel the liveliest interest in the planet  to which they belong, for they impart to it an appearance of likeness to  our globe which at first glance is all but irresistible.    To watch one of them apparently melting, becoming perceptibly smaller  week after week, while the general surface of the corresponding  hemisphere of the planet deepens in color, and displays a constantly  increasing wealth of details as summer advances across it, is an  experience of the most memorable kind, whose effect upon the mind of the  observer is indescribable.    Early in the history of the telescope it became known that, in addition  to the polar caps, Mars presented a number of distinct surface features,  and gradually, as instruments increased in power and observers in  skill, charts of the planet were produced showing a surface diversified  somewhat in the manner that characterizes the face of the earth,  although the permanent forms do not closely resemble those of our  planet.    Two principal colors exist on the disk of Mars--dark, bluish gray or  greenish gray, characterizing areas which have generally been regarded  as seas, and light yellowish red, overspreading broad regions looked  upon as continents. It was early observed that if the dark regions  really are seas, the proportion of water to land upon Mars is much  smaller than upon the earth.    For two especial reasons Mars has generally been regarded as an older or  more advanced planet than the earth. The first reason is that, accepting  Laplace's theory of the origin of the planetary system from a series of  rings left off at the periphery of the contracting solar nebula, Mars  must have come into existence earlier than the earth, because, being  more distant from the center of the system, the ring from which it was  formed would have been separated sooner than the terrestrial ring. The  second reason is that Mars being smaller and less massive than the earth  has run through its developments a cooling globe more rapidly. The  bearing of these things upon the problems of life on Mars will be  considered hereafter.    And now, once more, Schiaparelli appears as the discoverer of surprising  facts about one of the most interesting worlds of the solar system.  During the exceptionally favorable opposition of Mars in 1877, when an  American astronomer, Asaph Hall, discovered the planet's two minute  satellites, and again during the opposition of 1879, the Italian  observer caught sight of an astonishing network of narrow dark lines  intersecting the so-called continental regions of the planet and  crossing one another in every direction. Schiaparelli did not see the  little moons that Hall discovered, and Hall did not perceive the  enigmatical lines that Schiaparelli detected. Hall had by far the larger  and more powerful telescope; Schiaparelli had much the more steady and  favorable atmosphere for astronomical observation. Yet these differences  in equipment and circumstances do not clearly explain why each observer  should have seen what the other did not.    There may be a partial explanation in the fact that an observer having  made a remarkable discovery is naturally inclined to confine his  attention to it, to the neglect of other things. But it was soon found  that Schiaparelli's lines--to which he gave the name \"canals,\" merely on  account of their shape and appearance, and without any intention to  define their real nature--were excessively difficult telescopic objects.  Eight or nine years elapsed before any other observer corroborated  Schiaparelli's observations, and notwithstanding the \"sensation\" which  the discovery of the canals produced they were for many years regarded  by the majority of astronomers as an illusion.    But they were no illusion, and in 1881 Schiaparelli added to the  astonishment created by his original discovery, and furnished additional  grounds for skepticism, by announcing that, at certain times, many of  the canals geminated, or became double! He continued his observations at  each subsequent opposition, adding to the number of the canals observed,  and charting them with classical names upon a detailed map of the  planet's surface.    At length in 1886 Perrotin, at Nice, detected many of Schiaparelli's  canals, and later they were seen by others. In 1888 Schiaparelli greatly  extended his observations, and in 1892 and 1894 some of the canals were  studied with the 36-inch telescope of the Lick Observatory, and in the  last-named year a very elaborate series of observations upon them was  made by Percival Lowell and his associates, Prof. William C. Pickering  and Mr. A.E. Douglass, at Flagstaff, Arizona. Mr. Lowell's charts of the  planet are the most complete yet produced, containing 184 canals to  which separate names have been given, besides more than a hundred other  markings also designated by individual appellations.    It should not be inferred from the fact that Schiaparelli's discovery  in 1877 excited so much surprise and incredulity that no glimpse of the  peculiar canal-like markings on Mars had been obtained earlier than  that. At least as long ago as 1864 Mr. Dawes, in England, had seen and  sketched half a dozen of the larger canals, or at least the broader  parts of them, especially where they connect with the dark regions known  as seas, but Dawes did not see them in their full extent, did not  recognize their peculiar character, and entirely failed to catch sight  of the narrower and more numerous ones which constitute the wonderful  network discovered by the Italian astronomer. Schiaparelli found no less  than sixty canals during his first series of observations in 1877.    Let us note some of the more striking facts about the canals which  Schiaparelli has described. We can not do better than quote his own  words:    \"There are on this planet, traversing the continents, long dark lines  which may be designated as _canals_, although we do not yet know what  they are. These lines run from one to another of the somber spots that  are regarded as seas, and form, over the lighter, or continental,  regions a well-defined network. Their arrangement appears to be  invariable and permanent; at least, as far as I can judge from four and  a half years of observation. Nevertheless, their aspect and their degree  of visibility are not always the same, and depend upon circumstances  which the present state of our knowledge does not yet permit us to  explain with certainty. In 1879 a great number were seen which were not  visible in 1877, and in 1882 all those which had been seen at former  oppositions were found again, together with new ones. Sometimes these  canals present themselves in the form of shadowy and vague lines, while  on other occasions they are clear and precise, like a trace drawn with a  pen. In general they are traced upon the sphere like the lines of great  circles; a few show a sensible lateral curvature. They cross one another  obliquely, or at right angles. They have a breadth of two degrees, or  120 kilometres [74 miles], and several extend over a length of eighty  degrees, or 4,800 kilometres [nearly 3,000 miles]. Their tint is very  nearly the same as that of the seas, usually a little lighter. Every  canal terminates at both its extremities in a sea, or in another canal;  there is not a single example of one coming to an end in the midst of  dry land.    \"This is not all. In certain seasons these canals become double. This  phenomenon seems to appear at a determinate epoch, and to be produced  simultaneously over the entire surface of the planet's continents. There  was no indication of it in 1877, during the weeks that preceded and  followed the summer solstice of that world. A single isolated case  presented itself in 1879. On the 26th of December, this year--a little  before the spring equinox, which occurred on Mars on the 21st of  January, 1880--I noticed the doubling of the Nile [a canal thus named]  between the Lakes of the Moon and the Ceraunic Gulf. These two regular,  equal, and parallel lines caused me, I confess, a profound surprise,  the more so because a few days earlier, on the 23d and the 24th of  December, I had carefully observed that very region without discovering  anything of the kind.    \"I awaited with curiosity the return of the planet in 1881, to see if an  analogous phenomenon would present itself in the same place, and I saw  the same thing reappear on the 11th of January, 1882, one month after  the spring equinox--which occurred on the 8th of December, 1881.
