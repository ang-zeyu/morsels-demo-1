The cheeky-looking  villa, with its superabundance of ornament, is a monument in masonry to the  successful mining jobber on a small scale. The solemn-looking, solid  dwelling, standing in its own grounds, where every flower bush has its  individual prop, where the lawn is trimmed with mathematical exactitude,  and not one vagrant leaf is allowed to stray, speaks with a kind of  brick-and-mortar eloquence of virtue that has never grasped the sublime  fulness of the Scriptural text which saith: \"The way of transgressors is  hard!\" That is the home of the middle-aged Churchman, whose feet from  infancy have fallen amidst roses. He has never erred, because he has never  known enough of human sympathy and human toil and struggle to feel  temptation. The coy little cottage further on, surrounded by climbing roses  and sweet-smelling herbs, where the gate is left just a little bit open, as  if inviting a welcome, seems to advertise itself as the home of two maiden  sisters, who, though past the giddy girlhood stage, still have hopes of  being somebody's darling by-and-by.    But in a Boer town most of the piety is knocked out of a man. You stare at  the houses, and they stare back at you dumbly. There is nothing pretentious  or rakish about any of them; no matter how riotous a man's imagination  might be, he could never conjure up a \"wink\" from a Boer house, though I  have seen houses in other parts of the world that seemed to \"cock an eye\"  at a passing traveller and invite him to try the door.    They have only two styles of roofing their dwellings--either the  old-fashioned gable roof, or the still older kind of \"lean-to,\" the latter  being nothing but a flat top, high at the front and running lower towards  the back, in order that the rain water may carry off rapidly. They paint  their doors and windows a sober reddish brown, for your true Boer has an  utter contempt for anything gaudy or gay. He leaves that sort of thing to  his nigger servants, who make up for their master's lack of appreciation in  the matter of colour by rigging themselves out in anything that is  startling in the way of contrasts, for if the white master is a Puritan in  such things, the nigger servant, male and female, is a perfect sybarite.    Right opposite where I am sitting a family group, or all that is left of  the family, is sitting, as the custom is at evening, out on the stoep. On  the side nearest me is a young widow. I have made inquiries concerning her.  Her husband was killed fighting against our troops at Graspan. She, poor  thing, is dressed in deepest mourning. Her dress is made of some heavy  black material, and has no touch of white or any colour anywhere to relieve  its sombre shades. On her head she wears a jet black cap, which rises high  and wide, and falls around her neck and shoulders. The cap is fashioned  much after the style of the sun bonnets worn by the peasant women of  Normandy, but hers is black, black as the grave. She has rather a nice  face, a good woman's face, pale and refined by suffering. No one looking at  her can doubt that she has suffered, and suffered as only such women can,  through this brutal, bloody war. I thought of the widows away in our own  land as I looked at her sitting there, so silently and sadly, with her thin  white hands clasped on the black folds of her lap. On one hand I plainly  saw the gold circle shining, which a few months ago had meant so much to  her; now, alas! only the outward and visible sign of all she had been and  of all that she had lost. Behind her the snow-white wall of the house,  sparkling in the red rays of the setting sun; at her feet only the white  slate of the stoep. And well enough I knew that under the proud Empire flag  many a widow as young and as heart-broken as this Dutch girl would watch  the sun go down as hopelessly as she, and I could not help the thought  which sprang to my soul--God's bitter curse rest on the head of the man, be  he Boer or Briton, who brought about this cruel war.    On the street in front of the house where the widow sat I noticed a group  of niggers. Some of them were merely local \"boys,\" who worked for the  townspeople. They were dressed in the usual nigger fashion, in old store  clothing, patched or ventilated according to the wearer's taste. One fellow  had on a pair of pants that had at some former stage belonged to a man  about four times his size. The portion of those pants which is usually  hidden when a man is sitting in the saddle had been worn into a huge hole,  which the nigger had picturesquely filled by tacking on a scarlet shawl. As  the pants were made of navy blue serge the effect was unquestionably  artistic, especially as the amateur tailor had done his sewing with string,  most of the stitches running from an inch to an inch and a half in length.  Still, he was only one of many in similar case, so that he did not feel in  the least degree lonely. There were other niggers there--\"boys\" belonging  to the mule-drivers of the army. These \"boys\" nearly all sported a military  jacket and some sort of field service cap, which they had picked up somehow  in camp. The \"side\" these niggers put on when they get inside odds and ends  of military wearing apparel is something appalling. They swagger around  amongst the civilian niggers, and treat them as beings of a very inferior  mould, whilst the lies they tell concerning their individual acts of  heroism would set the author of \"Deadwood Dick\" blushing out of simple  envy.    The nigger girls cluster round these black veterans like flies around a  western water hole in midsummer, and their shrill laughter makes the air  fairly vibrate as they bandy jests with the cheeky herds. The girls are  rather pleasing in appearance, though far from being pretty. As a rule,  they wear clean print dresses and white aprons; they never wear hats of any  kind, but coil a showy kerchief around their heads in coquettish fashion.  They are not particular as to colour, red, blue, yellow, or pink, anything  will do as long as it is brilliant. The skins of the girls are almost as  varied as the headgear. The Kaffir girl is very dark, almost black. The  bushman's daughter is dirty yellow, like river water in flood time. Some of  the other tribes are as black as the record of a first-class burglar, but  they have bright black eyes, which they roll about as a kitten rolls a ball  of wool in playtime.    But whether they are black, brown, or coffee-coloured, they are all alike  in one respect--every daughter of them has a mouth that is as boundless as  a mother's blessing, and as limitless as the imagination of a spring poet  in love. When they are vexed they purse that mouth up into a bunch until it  looks like a crumpled saddle-flap hanging on a hedge. When they are pleased  the mouth opens and expands like an indiarubber portmanteau ready for  packing; that is when they smile, but when they laugh their ears have to  shift to give the mouth a chance to get comfortably to its destination.  They have beautiful teeth, the white ivory showing against the black  foreground like fresh tombstones in an old cemetery on a dark night. It is  amusing to watch them flirting with the soldier niggers. They try to look  coy, but soon fall victims to the skilful blandishments of the  vain-glorious warriors, and after a little manoeuvring they put out their  lips to be kissed, a sight which might well make even a Scotch Covenanter  grin. They suck their lips in with a sharp hissing breath; then push them  out suddenly, ready for the osculatory seance, the lips moving as if they  were pushed from the inside by a pole. The \"boys\" enjoy the picnic  immensely. As a matter of fact, these \"boys\" always seem to me to be doing  one of four things. They are either eating, smoking, sleeping, or making  love; and they do enough love-making in twenty-four hours to last an  ordinary everyday sort of white man four months, even if he puts in a  little overtime. One of the most charming things noticeable about a Boer  town is the plenitude of trees in the streets. They are often ornamental,  always useful for purposes of shade. There is no regularity about their  distribution; they seem to have been planted spasmodically at odd times and  at odd positions. There is little about them to lead one to the belief that  they receive over much care after they have been put into the soil. I have  found a very creditable library in pretty nearly every Boer town that I  have visited, and it is a noteworthy fact that all of our most cherished  authors find a place on their book-shelves. One other thing I have also  noticed, which, though a small thing in itself, is yet very significant. In  nearly every hotel, and in many of the public places, portraits of our  Queen and members of the Royal Family have been hanging side by side with  portraits of notable men, such as Mr. Gladstone, Lord Salisbury, Mr.  Chamberlain, and Mr. Rhodes. During the course of the war all kinds and  conditions of Boers have had free access to the rooms where those portraits  were to be seen, but now I find that no damage has been done to any of  those pictures, excepting those of Mr. Rhodes and Mr. Chamberlain. This has  not been an oversight on the part of the Boers, for I defy any person to  find a solitary picture of the two last-named gentlemen that has not been  hacked with knives. But the Queen and Royal Family photos have in every  case been treated with respect.                                         BEHIND THE SCENES.                                                                     STORMBERG.      I am writing this from Stormberg, a tremendously important military  position, which was taken on Monday, the 5th, by General Gatacre, without a  blow, the enemy falling back cowed by the British general's tactics. Had "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16140"],[0,"The Curious Book of Birds (#11)"],[1," Magpie became a restless, noisy, black-and-white  bird as we know her to this day, having lost all her brilliant beauty  through the wickedness of her heart. But the pious Robin still wears  upon his breast the beautiful feathers stained red with his Master's  blood. And all that the Saviour foretold of him has come true. He is the  blessed bird whom children everywhere love and of whom they still repeat  these old verses:--        \"The Robin and the Redbreast,         The Robin and the Wren,      If ye take out of the nest         Ye'll never thrive again.      The Robin and the Redbreast,         The Martin and the Swallow,      If ye touch one of their eggs         Bad luck is sure to follow.\"          THE ROBIN WHO WAS AN INDIAN      The name of Robin makes us think at once of the jolliest and most  sociable of all our little brother birds. In every land the name is a  favorite, and wherever he goes he brings happiness and kind feeling.    The American Robin is not the same bird as his English cousin, though  both have red breasts.    It was in a different manner that our little American friend came to  have the ruddy waistcoat which we know so well.    There was a time, so the Indians say, a very early time, long, long  before Columbus discovered America,--even before histories began to be  written,--when there were no Robins.    In those days in the land of the Ojibways, which is far in the north of  the cold country, there lived an old Indian chief who had one son, named  Iadilla. Now among the Ojibways, when a boy was almost big enough to  become a warrior, before he could go out with the other braves to the  hunt or to war, there was a great trial which he must undergo. Other  lands and peoples have known similar customs. You remember how, in  early Christian times, long, long ago, Galahad and other boys had to  fast and watch by their armor during the long night hours before they  could become knights, to wear spurs and shield and sword? In just the  same way a brown Ojibway lad had to make a long fast in order to win the  love of his Guardian Spirit, who would after that watch over him to make  him brave and strong. It was a very important event in a boy's life,  like graduation from school or college nowadays. For this meant the  graduation from boyhood into manhood, the winning of a warrior's  diploma.    The father of Iadilla was a brave warrior, a famous chief. But he wished  his son to become even better, wiser, greater than he had been. He  resolved that the boy should fast longer and harder than ever a lad had  fasted before. For he believed that this was the way to make him the  noblest of his race. Iadilla was a fine handsome lad, but he was the  youngest one who had ever made the trial, and there were many bigger  boys than he who were not yet warriors. The other chiefs said that he  was not yet old and strong enough.    But Iadilla's father declared that it was time, and bade his son gather  courage and pride for the ordeal. \"For,\" he said, \"it will be no easy  matter, my son, to become the greatest chief of the Ojibways.\"    \"My father,\" replied Iadilla, humbly, \"I will do as you wish. I will do  what I can. But my strength is not the strength of the bigger boys; and  I think it is yet early to talk of my becoming greatest of the Ojibways.  Yet make trial of me, if you wish.\"    The father of Iadilla had made a little tent of skins where the boy was  to live during his fasting time; where he was to lie without food or  drink for twelve long days, waiting for a message from the Guardian  Spirit whose love was to be the reward of such a trial.    When the time came, the old man led Iadilla to the lodge and bade him  lie down on the bed of skins which had been prepared for him. And  Iadilla did as he was bid, for he was a brave and obedient lad.    The days crept by, the long, long days of waiting, while Iadilla lay in  the lodge bearing hunger and thirst such as no Ojibway lad had ever  before known. All day and all night he lay still and spoke never a word.  But a dreadful fear was in his heart lest he should not be able to  endure the fast for the twelve days which his father had set.    Every morning his father came to the lodge to praise and to encourage  him, and to rejoice in one more day checked from the long time of  fasting. So eight days passed, and the old man was proud and happy.  Already his dear son had done more than any Ojibway lad, and the whole  tribe was praising Iadilla, saying what a great chief he would be in the  days to come.    But on the ninth morning, when the father peeped into the lodge to see  how bravely his son was faring, the boy turned his head toward the door  and spoke for the first time in all those long days. He was very thin  and pale, and his voice sounded weak.    \"My father,\" he said, \"I have slept, and my dreams were sad. I have  slept, and my dreams were of failure and weakness. The time does not  please my Guardian Spirit. It is not now that I can become a warrior. I  am not yet strong and old enough. O my father, I cannot bear the fast  longer! I am so hungry, so thirsty, so faint! Let me break my fast, and  try again in another year.\"    But the father sternly refused, for he was ambitious. \"Nay, lad,\" he  cried, frowningly. \"Would you fail me now? Think of the glory, think of  being the greatest of Ojibways. It is but a few short days now. Courage,  Iadilla, be a man in strength and patience.\"    Iadilla said no more. He wrapped himself closer in his blanket and drew  his belt tighter about his slender waist, trying to stifle the hunger  gnawing there. So he lay silently until the eleventh day. That morning  his father came to the lodge, beaming proudly.    \"Bravo, my Iadilla!\" he cried. \"Only one day more, and you will be  released from your fast.\" But Iadilla clasped his hands beseechingly.    \"My father,\" gasped the poor boy. \"I cannot bear it another day. I am  not fit to be a great chief. I have failed. Give me food, or I die!\"    But again the father refused. \"It is but a day now,\" he said, \"but a few  short hours. Bear a little longer, Iadilla. To-morrow I myself will  bring you the finest breakfast that ever a lad ate. Courage, boy, for  the few hours that remain.\"    Iadilla was too weak to answer. He lay motionless, with only a gentle  heaving of his breast to show that he still lived. His father left him  for the last time, and went to prepare the morrow's goodly breakfast,  while the tribe planned a fine festival in honor of the young hero.    Early on the morrow came Iadilla's father to the tent, proudly bearing  the breakfast for his brave boy, and smiling to think how gladly he  would be received. But he stopped outside the tent door surprised to  hear some one talking within. Stooping to a little hole in the skin of  the tent he peeped in to find who the speaker might be. Imagine his  surprise to find Iadilla standing upright in the middle of the tent  painting his breast a brilliant red, as Indians do in war time. And as  he daubed on the colors he talked to himself. He spoke softly, yet not  with the weak voice of a starving lad; and his face was very beautiful  to see, despite its pale thinness.    \"My father has ended my Indian life,\" he said. \"My father, too  ambitious, has put upon me more than my strength could bear. He would  not listen to my prayer of weakness. But I knew, I knew! And my kind  Guardian Spirit knew also that it was more than I could bear. He has  shown pity, seeing that I was obedient to my father and did my best to  please him. Now I am to be no longer an Indian boy. I must take the  shape which the Spirit has given me, and go away.\"    At these strange words the father broke into the tent, exclaiming in  terror,--    \"My son, my dear son! Do not leave me!\"    But, even as he spoke, Iadilla changed into a beautiful Robin Redbreast  with soft feathers and strong, firm wings. And, fluttering up to the  ridgepole of the tent, he looked down with pity and tenderness upon the  heart-broken chief.    \"Do not grieve, father,\" he sang. \"I shall be so much happier as a bird,  free from human pain and sorrow. I will cheer you with my merry songs.  Oh, I have been hungry; but now I shall get my food so easily, so  pleasantly on mountains and in the fields. Oh, once I was thirsty; but  now the dew is mine and the little springs. Once I traced my way  painfully by forest paths through bog and brake and tangled brier. But  now my pathways are in the bright, clear air, where never thorn can tear  nor beast can follow. Farewell, dear father! I am so happy!\"    He stretched his brown wings as easily as if he had worn them all his  life, and, singing a sweet song, fluttered away to the neighboring  woods, where he built his nest, and lived happily ever after.    And since that day the glad little Robins have lived as that first one  promised, close by the homes of men, and have done all they could to  cheer us and make us happy. For they remember how, once upon a time,  their ancestor was a human boy.          THE INQUISITIVE WOMAN      There was once a woman who was so very inquisitive that she wished to  know everything. She was never happy unless she was poking her nose into  some mystery, and the less a matter concerned her the more curious she  was about it.    One day the Lord gathered together all the insects in the world, all the  beetles, bugs, bees, mosquitoes, ants, locusts, grasshoppers, and other  creatures who fly or hop or crawl, and shut them up in a huge sack well  tied at the end. What a queer, squirming, muffled-buzzing bundle it  made, to be sure!    Then the Lord called the woman to him and said, \"Woman, I would have you  take this sack and throw it into the sea. But be sure and do not untie  the end of it to look inside; for the sack must on no account be opened,  even for a single minute.\"    The woman took the sack, wondering very much at the queer size and shape  and feeling of it, and"]]]
