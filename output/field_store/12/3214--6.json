They seldom had any money, but lay in wait for any liberal stranger,  in the hope of securing a free drink.    \"Where did you see him, Hooker?\" asked Tim Bolton, with sudden  interest.    \"Selling papers down by the Astor House.\"    \"Think of that, colonel!\" said Tim, disgusted. \"Becomin' a common  newsboy, when he might be in a genteel employment! Did you speak to  him, Hooker?\"    \"Yes, I asked him if he had left you.\"    \"What did he say?\"    \"That he had left you for good--that he was going to grow up  respectable!\"    \"Think of that!\" said Tim, with renewed disgust. \"Did he say where he  lived?\"    \"No.\"    \"Did he ask after me?\"    \"No, except he said that you were no relation of his. He said he  expected you stole him when he was a kid, and he hoped some time to  find his relations.\"    Tim Bolton's face changed color, and he was evidently disturbed. Could  the boy have heard anything? he wondered, for his suspicions were very  near the truth.    \"It's all nonsense!\" he said, roughly. \"Next time you see him, Hooker,  foller him home, and find out where he lives.\"    \"All right, Tim. It ought to be worth something,\" he insinuated, with  a husky cough.    \"That's so. What'll you take?\"    \"Whiskey,\" answered Hooker, with a look of pleased anticipation.    \"You're a gentleman, Tim,\" he said, as he gulped down the contents of  a glass without winking.    Briggs, his dilapidated companion, had been looking on in thirsty  envy.    \"I'll help Hooker to look for Dodger,\" he said.    \"Very well, Briggs.\"    \"Couldn't you stand a glass for me, too, Tim?\" asked Briggs, eagerly.    \"No,\" answered Bolton, irritably. \"I've been at enough expense for  that young rascal already.\"    But the colonel noticed the pathetic look of disappointment on the  face of Briggs, and he was stirred to compassion.    \"Drink with me, sir,\" he said, turning to the overjoyed Briggs.    \"Thank you, colonel. You're a gentleman!\"    \"Two glasses, Tim.\"    So the colonel drained a second glass, and Briggs, pouring out with  trembling fingers as much as he dared, followed suit.    When the last drop was drunk, he breathed a deep sigh of measureless  enjoyment.    \"If either of you bring that boy in here,\" said Tim, \"I'll stand a  couple of glasses for both.\"    \"We're your men, Tim,\" said Hooker. \"Ain't we, Briggs?\"    \"That's so, Hooker. Shake!\"    And the poor victims of drink shook hands energetically. Long since  they had sunk their manhood in the intoxicating cup, and henceforth  lived only to gratify their unnatural craving for what would sooner or  later bring them to a drunkard's grave.    As they left the saloon, the colonel turned to Tim, and said:    \"I like whiskey, sir; but I'll be hanged if I can respect such men as  those.\"    \"They're bums, colonel, that's what they are!\"    \"How do they live?\"    \"Don't know. They're in here about every day.\"    \"If it's drink that's brought them where they are, I'm half inclined  to give it up; but, after all, it isn't necessary to make a beast of  yourself. I always drink like a gentleman, sir.\"    \"So you do, colonel.\"    At that moment a poor woman, in a faded calico dress with a thin shawl  over her shoulders, descended the steps that led into the saloon, and  walked up to the bar.    \"Has my husband been here to-night?\" she asked.    Tim Bolton frowned.    \"Who's your husband?\" he asked, roughly.    \"Wilson.\"    \"No, Bill Wilson hasn't been here to-night. Even if he had you have no  business to come after him. I don't want any sniveling women here.\"    \"I couldn't help it, Mr. Bolton,\" said the woman, putting her apron to  her eyes. \"If Bill comes in, won't you tell him to come home? The  baby's dead, and we haven't a cent in the house!\"    Even Tim was moved by this.    \"I'll tell him,\" he said. \"Take a drink yourself; you don't look  strong. It shan't cost you a cent.\"    \"No,\" said the woman, \"not a drop! It has ruined my happiness, and  broken up our home! Not a drop!\"    \"Here, my good lady,\" said the colonel, with chivalrous deference,  \"you have no money. Take this,\" and he handed the astonished woman a  five-dollar bill.    \"Heaven bless you, sir!\" she exclaimed, fervently.    \"Allow me to see you to the street,\" and the gallant Southern  gentleman escorted her up to the sidewalk.    \"I'd like to horsewhip that woman's husband. Don't you sell him  another drop!\" he said, when he returned.          Chapter XIV.  The Missing Will.      An hour after the depart of the colonel there was an unexpected  arrival.    A well-dressed gentleman descended the stairs gingerly, looked about  him with fastidious disdain, and walked up to the bar.    Tim Bolton was filling an order, and did not immediately observe him.    When at length he turned around he exclaimed, in some surprise:    \"Mr. Waring!\"    \"Yes, Bolton, I have found my way here.\"    \"I have been expecting you.\"    \"I came to you for some information.\"    \"Well, ask your questions: I don't know whether I can answer them.\"    \"First, where is my Cousin Florence?\"    \"How should I know? She wasn't likely to place herself under my  protection.\"    \"She's with that boy of yours--Dodger, I believe you call him. Where  is he?\"    \"Run away,\" answered Bolton, briefly.    \"Do you mean that you don't know where he is?\"    \"Yes, I do mean that. I haven't set my eyes on him since that night.\"    \"What do you mean by such negligence? Do you remember who he is?\"    \"Certainly I do.\"    \"Then why do you let him get of your reach?\"    \"How could I help it? Here I am tied down to this bar day and night!  I'm nearly dead for want of sleep.\"    \"It would be better to close up your place for a week and look after  him.\"    \"Couldn't do it. I should lose all my trade. People would say I was  closed up.\"    \"And have you done nothing toward his recovery?\"    \"Yes, I have sent out two men in search of him.\"    \"Have you any idea where he is, or what he is doing?\"    \"Yes, he has been seen in front of the Astor House, selling papers. I  have authorized my agent, if he sees him again, to follow him home,  and find out where he lives.\"    \"That is good! Astor House? I may see him myself.\"    \"But why do you want to see him? Do you want to restore him to his  rights?\"    \"Hush!\" said Curtis, glancing around him apprehensively. \"What we say  may be overheard and excite suspicion. One thing may be secured by  finding him--the knowledge of Florence's whereabouts.\"    \"What makes you think she and the boy are together?\"    \"He came for her trunk. I was away from home, or I would not have let  it go----\"    \"It is strange that they two are together, considering their  relationship.\"    \"That is what I am afraid they will find out. She may tell him of the  mysterious disappearance of her cousin, and he----\"    \"That reminds me,\" interrupted Bolton. \"He told Hooker--Hooker was the  man that saw him in front of the Astor House--that he didn't believe I  was his father. He said he thought I must have stolen him when he was  a young kid.\"    \"Did he say that?\" asked Curtis, in evident alarm.    \"Yes, so Hooker says.\"    \"If he has that idea in his head, he may put two and two together, and  guess that he is the long-lost cousin of Florence. Tim, the boy must  be got rid of.\"    \"If you mean what I think you do, Mr. Waring, I'm not with you. I  won't consent to harm the boy.\"    \"You said that before. I don't mean anything that will shock your  tender heart, Bolton,\" said Curtis, with a sneer. \"I mean carried to a  distance--Europe or Australia, for instance. All I want is to keep him  out of New York till my uncle is dead. After that I don't care what  becomes of him.\"    \"That's better. I've no objection to that. How is the old gentleman?\"    \"He grieved so much at first over the girl's loss, that I feared he  would insist on her being recalled at once. I soothed him by telling  him that he had only to remain firm, and she would come around, and  yield to his wishes.\"    \"Do you think she will?\" asked Tim, doubtfully.    \"I intend she shall!\" said Curtis, significantly. \"Bolton, I love the  girl all the more for her obstinate refusal to wed me. I have made up  my mind to marry her with her consent, or without it.\"    \"I thought it was only the estate you were after?\"    \"I want the estate and her with it. Mark my words, Bolton, I will have  both!\"    \"You will have the estate, no doubt; Mr. Linden has made his will in  your favor, has he not?\" and Bolton looked intently in the face of his  visitor.    \"Hark you, Bolton, there is a mystery I cannot fathom. My uncle made  two wills. In the earlier, he left the estate to Florence and myself,  if we married; otherwise, to me alone.\"    \"That is satisfactory.\"    \"Yes, but there was another, in which the estate goes to the son, if  living. That will has disappeared.\"    \"Is it possible?\" asked Bolton, in astonishment. \"When was it missed?\"    \"On the night of the burglary.\"    \"Then you think----\"    \"That the boy, Dodger, has it. Good Heavens! if he only knew that by  this will the estate goes to him!\" and Waring wiped the perspiration  from his brow.    \"You are sure he did not give you the will?\" he demanded, eying Bolton  sharply.    \"I have not seen him since the night of the robbery.\"    \"If he has read the will, it may lead to dangerous suspicions.\"    \"He would give it to your cousin, Florence, would he not?\"    \"Perhaps so. Bolton, you must get the boy back, and take the will from  him, if you can.\"    \"I will do my best; but you must remember that Dodger is no longer a  small kid. He is a boy of eighteen, strong and well grown. He wouldn't  be easy to manage. Besides, as long as he doesn't know that he has any  interest in the will, his holding it won't do any harm. Is the old  gentleman likely to live long?\"    \"I don't know. I sometimes hope---- Pshaw! why should I play the  hypocrite when speaking to you?"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1860"],[0,"Westward Ho! Or, The Voyages and Adventures of Sir Amyas Leigh, Knight, of (#11)"],[1,"for awhile by all young dames, and most young gentlemen: and  his mother heaved a deep sigh, which Lady Bath overhearing--    \"What? in the dumps, good madam, while all are rejoicing in your joy?  Are you afraid that we court-dames shall turn your Adonis's brain for  him?\"    \"I do, indeed, fear lest your condescension should make him forget that  he is only a poor squire's orphan.\"    \"I will warrant him never to forget aught that he should recollect,\"  said my Lady Bath.    And she spoke truly. But soon Frank's silver voice was heard calling  out--    \"Room there, good people, for the gallant 'prentice lads!\"    And on they came, headed by a giant of buckram and pasteboard armor,  forth of whose stomach looked, like a clock-face in a steeple, a human  visage, to be greeted, as was the fashion then, by a volley of quips and  puns from high and low.    Young Mr. William Cary, of Clovelly, who was the wit of those parts,  opened the fire by asking him whether he were Goliath, Gogmagog, or  Grantorto in the romance; for giants' names always began with a G. To  which the giant's stomach answered pretty surlily--    \"Mine don't; I begin with an O.\"    \"Then thou criest out before thou art hurt, O cowardly giant!\"    \"Let me out, lads,\" quoth the irascible visage, struggling in his  buckram prison, \"and I soon show him whether I be a coward.\"    \"Nay, if thou gettest out of thyself, thou wouldst be beside thyself,  and so wert but a mad giant.\"    \"And that were pity,\" said Lady Bath; \"for by the romances, giants have  never overmuch wit to spare.\"    \"Mercy, dear lady!\" said Frank, \"and let the giant begin with an O.\"    \"A ----\"    \"A false start, giant! you were to begin with an O.\"    \"I'll make you end with an O, Mr. William Cary!\" roared the testy tower  of buckram.    \"And so I do, for I end with 'Fico!'\"    \"Be mollified, sweet giant,\" said Frank, \"and spare the rash youth of  yon foolish knight. Shall elephants catch flies, or Hurlo-Thrumbo stain  his club with brains of Dagonet the jester? Be mollified; leave thy  caverned grumblings, like Etna when its windy wrath is past, and  discourse eloquence from thy central omphalos, like Pythoness  ventriloquizing.\"    \"If you do begin laughing at me too, Mr. Leigh ----\" said the giant's  clock-face, in a piteous tone.    \"I laugh not. Art thou not Ordulf the earl, and I thy humblest squire?  Speak up, my lord; your cousin, my Lady Bath, commands you.\"    And at last the giant began:--         \"A giant I, Earl Ordulf men me call,--       'Gainst Paynim foes Devonia's champion tall;       In single fight six thousand Turks I slew;       Pull'd off a lion's head, and ate it too:       With one shrewd blow, to let St. Edward in,       I smote the gates of Exeter in twain;       Till aged grown, by angels warn'd in dream,       I built an abbey fair by Tavy stream.       But treacherous time hath tripped my glories up,       The stanch old hound must yield to stancher pup;       Here's one so tall as I, and twice so bold,       Where I took only cuffs, takes good red gold.       From pole to pole resound his wondrous works,       Who slew more Spaniards than I e'er slew Turks;       I strode across the Tavy stream: but he       Strode round the world and back; and here 'a be!\"    \"Oh, bathos!\" said Lady Bath, while the 'prentices shouted applause. \"Is  this hedge-bantling to be fathered on you, Mr. Frank?\"    \"It is necessary, by all laws of the drama, madam,\" said Frank, with a  sly smile, \"that the speech and the speaker shall fit each other. Pass  on, Earl Ordulf; a more learned worthy waits.\"    Whereon, up came a fresh member of the procession; namely, no less  a person than Vindex Brimblecombe, the ancient schoolmaster, with  five-and-forty boys at his heels, who halting, pulled out his  spectacles, and thus signified his forgiveness of his whilom broken  head:--    \"That the world should have been circumnavigated, ladies and gentles,  were matter enough of jubilation to the student of Herodotus and Plato,  Plinius and ---- ahem! much more when the circumnavigators are Britons;  more, again, when Damnonians.\"    \"Don't swear, master,\" said young Will Cary.    \"Gulielme Cary, Gulielme Cary, hast thou forgotten thy--\"    \"Whippings? Never, old lad! Go on; but let not the license of the  scholar overtop the modesty of the Christian.\"    \"More again, as I said, when, incolae, inhabitants of Devon; but,  most of all, men of Bideford school. Oh renowned school! Oh schoolboys  ennobled by fellowship with him! Oh most happy pedagogue, to whom it has  befallen to have chastised a circumnavigator, and, like another Chiron,  trained another Hercules: yet more than Hercules, for he placed  his pillars on the ocean shore, and then returned; but my scholar's  voyage--\"    \"Hark how the old fox is praising himself all along on the sly,\" said  Cary.    \"Mr. William, Mr. William, peace;--silentium, my graceless pupil. Urge  the foaming steed, and strike terror into the rapid stag, but meddle not  with matters too high for thee.\"    \"He has given you the dor now, sir,\" said Lady Bath; \"let the old man  say his say.\"    \"I bring, therefore, as my small contribution to this day's feast; first  a Latin epigram, as thus--\"    \"Latin? Let us hear it forthwith,\" cried my lady.    And the old pedant mouthed out--         \"Torriguiam Tamaris ne spernat; Leighius addet       Mox terras terris, inclyte Drake, tuis.\"    \"Neat, i' faith, la!\" Whereon all the rest, as in duty bound, approved  also.    \"This for the erudite: for vulgar ears the vernacular is more consonant,  sympathetic, instructive; as thus:--         \"Famed Argo ship, that noble chip, by doughty Jason's steering,       Brought back to Greece the golden fleece, from Colchis home            careering;       But now her fame is put to shame, while new Devonian Argo,       Round earth doth run in wake of sun, and brings wealthier cargo.\"    \"Runs with a right fa-lal-la,\" observed Cary; \"and would go nobly to a  fiddle and a big drum.\"         \"Ye Spaniards, quake! our doughty Drake a royal swan is tested,       On wing and oar, from shore to shore, the raging main who            breasted:--       But never needs to chant his deeds, like swan that lies a-dying,       So far his name, by trump of fame, around the sphere is flying.\"    \"Hillo ho! schoolmaster!\" shouted a voice from behind; \"move on, and  make way for Father Neptune!\" Whereon a whole storm of raillery fell  upon the hapless pedagogue.    \"We waited for the parson's alligator, but we wain't for yourn.\"    \"Allegory! my children, allegory!\" shrieked the man of letters.    \"What do ye call he an alligator for? He is but a poor little starved  evat!\"    \"Out of the road, old Custis! March on, Don Palmado!\"    These allusions to the usual instrument of torture in West-country  schools made the old gentleman wince; especially when they were followed  home by--    \"Who stole Admiral Grenville's brooms, because birch rods were dear?\"    But proudly he shook his bald head, as a bull shakes off the flies, and  returned to the charge once more.      \"Great Alexander, famed commander, wept and made a pother, At conquering  only half the world, but Drake had conquer'd t'other; And Hercules to  brink of seas!--\"      \"Oh--!\"    And clapping both hands to the back of his neck, the schoolmaster began  dancing frantically about, while his boys broke out tittering, \"O! the  ochidore! look to the blue ochidore! Who've put ochidore to maister's  poll!\"    It was too true: neatly inserted, as he stooped forward, between his  neck and his collar, was a large live shore-crab, holding on tight with  both hands.    \"Gentles! good Christians! save me! I am mare-rode! Incubo, vel ab  incubo, opprimor! Satanas has me by the poll! Help! he tears my jugular;  he wrings my neck, as he does to Dr. Faustus in the play. Confiteor!--I  confess! Satan, I defy thee! Good people, I confess! [Greek text]! The  truth will out. Mr. Francis Leigh wrote the epigram!\" And diving through  the crowd, the pedagogue vanished howling, while Father Neptune, crowned  with sea-weeds, a trident in one hand, and a live dog-fish in the other,  swaggered up the street surrounded by a tall bodyguard of mariners, and  followed by a great banner, on which was depicted a globe, with Drake's  ship sailing thereon upside down, and overwritten--         \"See every man the Pelican,          Which round the world did go,       While her stern-post was uppermost,          And topmasts down below.       And by the way she lost a day,          Out of her log was stole:       But Neptune kind, with favoring wind,          Hath brought her safe and whole.\"    \"Now, lads!\" cried Neptune; \"hand me my parable that's writ for me, and  here goeth!\"    And at the top of his bull-voice, he began roaring--         \"I am King Neptune bold,         The ruler of the seas       I don't understand much singing upon land,         But I hope what I say will please.         \"Here be five Bideford men,         Which have sail'd the world around,       And I watch'd them well, as they all can tell,         And brought them home safe and sound.         \"For it is the men of Devon.         To see them I take delight,       Both to tack and to hull, and to heave and to pull,         And to prove themselves in fight.         \"Where be those Spaniards proud,         That make their valiant boasts;       And think for to keep the poor Indians for their sheep,         And to farm my golden coasts?         \"'Twas the devil and the Pope gave them         My kingdom for their own:       But my nephew Francis Drake, he caused them to quake,         And he pick'd them to the bone.         \"For the sea my realm it is,         As good Queen Bess's is the land;       So freely come again, all merry Devon men,         And there's old Neptune's hand.\"    \"Holla, boys! holla! Blow up, Triton, and bring forward the freedom of  the seas.\"    Triton, roaring"]]]
