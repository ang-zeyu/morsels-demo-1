The reader should be informed, that just at this time, no less a person  than the King of Spain was expected hourly to depart this life, an event  in which the minister of Great Britain was particularly concerned; and the  Duke of Newcastle, on the very night that the proprietor of the decisive  vote arrived at his door, had sat up anxiously expecting dispatches from  Madrid. Wearied by official business and agitated spirits, he retired to  rest, having previously given particular instructions to his porter not to  go to bed, as he expected every minute a messenger with advices of the  greatest importance, and desired that he might be shown upstairs, the  moment of his arrival.    His grace was sound asleep; and the porter, settled for the night in his  armchair, had already commenced a sonorous nap, when the vigorous arm of  the Cornish voter roused him from his slumbers. To his first question, \"Is  the Duke at home?\" the porter replied, \"Yes, and in bed; but has left  particular orders that, come when you will, you are to go up to him  directly.\"    \"Bless him, for a worthy and honest gentleman,\" cried our applicant for  the vacant post, smiling and nodding with approbation at the prime  minister's kindness, \"how punctual his grace is; I knew he would not  deceive me; let me hear no more of lords and dukes not keeping their  words; I verily believe they are as honest, and mean as well as any other  folks.\" Having ascended the stairs as he was speaking, he was ushered into  the Duke's bedchamber.    \"Is he dead?\" exclaimed his grace, rubbing his eyes, and scarcely awakened  from dreaming of the King of Spain, \"Is he dead?\"    \"Yes, my lord,\" replied the eager expectant, delighted to find the  election promise, with all its circumstances, so fresh in the nobleman's  memory.    \"When did he die?\"    \"The day before yesterday, exactly at half past one o'clock, after being  confined three weeks to his bed, and taking a power of doctor's stuff; and  I hope your grace will be as good as your word, and let my son-in-law  succeed him.\"    The Duke, by this time perfectly awake, was staggered at the impossibility  of receiving intelligence from Madrid in so short a space of time; and  perplexed at the absurdity of a king's messenger applying for his  son-in-law to succeed the King of Spain: \"Is the man drunk, or mad? Where  are your dispatches?\" exclaimed his grace, hastily drawing back his  curtain; where, instead of a royal courier, he recognized at the bedside,  the fat, good-humored countenance of his friend from Cornwall, making low  bows, with hat in hand, and \"hoping my lord would not forget the gracious  promise he was so good as to make, in favor of his son-in-law, at the last  election.\"    Vexed at so untimely a disturbance, and disappointed of news from Spain,  the Duke frowned for a moment; but chagrin soon gave way to mirth, at so  singular and ridiculous a combination of circumstances, and, yielding to  the impulse, he sunk upon the bed in a violent fit of laughter, which was  communicated in a moment to the attendants.    The relater of this little narrative, concludes, with observing, \"Although  the Duke of Newcastle could not place the relative of his old acquaintance  on the throne of His Catholic Majesty, he advanced him to a post not less  honorable--he made him an exciseman.\"                                                     --Blackwood's Magazine.

(67)    The gay belles of fashion may boast of excelling    In waltz or cotillon, at whist or quadrille;  And seek admiration by vauntingly telling    Of drawing, and painting, and musical skill:  But give me the fair one, in country or city,    Whose home and its duties are dear to her heart,  Who cheerfully warbles some rustical ditty,    While plying the needle with exquisite art:  The bright little needle, the swift-flying needle,    The needle directed by beauty and art.    If Love have a potent, a magical token,    A talisman, ever resistless and true,  A charm that is never evaded or broken,    A witchery certain the heart to subdue,  'T is this; and his armory never has furnished    So keen and unerring, or polished a dart;  Let beauty direct it, so polished and burnished,    And oh! it is certain of touching the heart:  The bright little needle, the swift-flying needle,    The needle directed by beauty and art.    Be wise, then, ye maidens, nor seek admiration,    By dressing for conquest, and flirting with all;  You never, whate'er be your fortune or station,    Appear half so lovely at rout or at ball,  As gayly convened at the work-covered table,    Each cheerfully active, playing her part,  Beguiling the task with a song or a fable,    And plying the needle with exquisite art:  The bright little needle, the swift-flying needle,    The needle directed by beauty and art.                                          --Samuel Woodworth.        III. DAWN. (68)    Edward Everett, 1794-1865. He was born at Dorchester, Mass., now a part of  Boston, and graduated from Harvard College with the highest honors of his  class, at the age of seventeen. While yet in college, he had quite a  reputation as a brilliant writer. Before he was twenty years of age, he  was settled as pastor over the Brattle Street Church, in Boston, and at  once became famous as an eloquent preacher. In 1814, he was elected  Professor of Greek Literature in his Alma Mater; and, in order to prepare  himself for the duties of his office, he entered on an extended course of  travel in Europe. He edited the \"North American Review,\" in addition to  the labors of his professorship, after he returned to America.    In 1825, Mr. Everett was elected to Congress, and held his seat in the  House for ten years. He was Governor of his native state from 1835 to  1839. In 1841, he was appointed Minister to England. On his return, in  1846, he was chosen President of Harvard University, and held the office  for three years. In 1852, he was appointed Secretary of State. February  22, 1856, he delivered, in Boston, his celebrated lecture on Washington.  This lecture was afterwards delivered in most of the principal cities and  towns in the United States. The proceeds were devoted to the purchase of  Mt. Vernon. In 1860, he was a candidate for the Vice Presidency of the  United States, He is celebrated as an elegant and forcible writer, and a  chaste orator.    This extract, a wonderful piece of word painting, is a portion of an  address on the \"Uses of Astronomy,\" delivered at the inauguration of the  Dudley Observatory, at Albany, N, Y, Note the careful use of words, and  the strong figures in the third and fourth paragraphs.  ###      I had occasion, a few weeks since, to take the early train from Providence  to Boston; and for this purpose rose at two o'clock in the morning.  Everything around was wrapped in darkness and hushed in silence, broken  only by what seemed at that hour the unearthly clank and rush of the  train. It was a mild, serene, midsummer's night,--the sky was without a  cloud, the winds were whist. The moon, then in the last quarter, had just  risen, and the stars shone with a spectral luster but little affected by  her presence.    Jupiter, two hours high, was the herald of the day; the Pleiades, just  above the horizon, shed their sweet influence in the east; Lyra sparkled  near the zenith; Andromeda veiled her newly-discovered glories from the  naked eye in the south; the steady Pointers, far beneath the pole, looked  meekly up from the depths of the north to their sovereign.    Such was the glorious spectacle as I entered the train. As we proceeded,  the timid approach of twilight became more perceptible; the intense blue  of the sky began to soften; the smaller stars, like little children, went  first to rest; the sister beams of the Pleiades soon melted together; but  the bright constellations of the west and north remained unchanged.  Steadily the wondrous transfiguration went on. Hands of angels, hidden  from mortal eyes, shifted the scenery of the heavens; the glories of night  dissolved into the glories of the dawn.    The blue sky now turned more softly gray; the great watch stars shut up  their holy eyes; the east began to kindle. Faint streaks of purple soon  blushed along the sky; the whole celestial concave was filled with the  inflowing tides of the morning light, which came pouring down from above  in one great ocean of radiance; till at length, as we reached the Blue  Hills, a flash of purple fire blazed out from above the horizon, and  turned the dewy teardrops of flower and leaf into rubies and diamonds. In  a few seconds, the everlasting gates of the morning were thrown wide open,  and the lord of day, arrayed in glories too severe for the gaze of man,  began his state.    I do not wonder at the superstition of the ancient Magians, who, in the  morning of the world, went up to the hilltops of Central Asia, and,  ignorant of the true God, adored the most glorious work of his hand. But I  am filled with amazement, when I am told, that, in this enlightened age  and in the heart of the Christian world, there are persons who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16767"],[0,"Half-hours with the Telescope (#11)"],[1,"point  above the horizon towards east-south-east. This part of the Milky Way is  well worth observing, being marked by singular variations of brilliancy.  Near Arided (the principal star of Cygnus, and now lying due east--some  twenty-five degrees from the zenith) there is seen a straight dark rift,  and near this space is another larger cavity, which has been termed the  northern Coal-sack. The space between [gamma], [delta], and [beta] Cygni  is covered by a large oval mass, exceedingly rich and brilliant. The  neighbouring branch, extending from [epsilon] Cygni, is far less  conspicuous here, but near Sagitta becomes brighter than the other,  which in this neighbourhood suddenly loses its brilliancy and fading  gradually beyond this point becomes invisible near [beta] Ophiuchi.  The continuous stream becomes patchy--in parts very brilliant--where it  crosses Aquila and Clypeus. In this neighbourhood the other stream  reappears, passing over a region very rich in stars. We see now the  greatest extent of the Milky Way, towards this part of its length, ever  visible in our latitudes--just as in spring we see its greatest extent  towards Monoceros and Argo.    [Illustration: PLATE IV.]    I may note here in passing that Sir John Herschel's delineation of the  northern portion of the Milky Way, though a great improvement on the  views given in former works, seems to require revision, and especially  as respects the very remarkable patches and streaks which characterise  the portion extending over Cepheus and Cygnus. It seems to me, also,  that the evidence on which it has been urged that the stars composing  the Milky Way are (on an average) comparable in magnitude to our own  sun, or to stars of the leading magnitudes, is imperfect. I believe, for  instance, that the brilliant oval of milky light in Cygnus comes from  stars intimately associated with the leading stars in that  constellation, and not far removed in space (proportionately) beyond  them. Of course, if this be the case, the stars, whose combined light  forms the patch of milky light, must be far smaller than the leading  brilliants of Cygnus. However, this is not the place to enter on  speculations of this sort; I return therefore to the business we have  more immediately in hand.    Towards the east is the square of Pegasus low down towards the horizon.  Towards the south is Scorpio, distinguished by the red and brilliant  Antares, and by a train of conspicuous stars. Towards the west is  Bootes, his leading brilliant--the ruddy Arcturus--lying somewhat nearer  the horizon than the zenith, and slightly south of west. Bootes as a  constellation is easily found if we remember that he is delineated as  chasing away the Greater Bear. Thus at present he is seen in a slightly  inclined position, his head (marked by the third-magnitude star [beta])  lying due west, some thirty degrees from the zenith. It has always  appeared to me, by the way, that Bootes originally had nobler  proportions than astronomers now assign to him. It is known that Canes  Venatici now occupy the place of an upraised arm of Bootes, and I  imagine that Corona Borealis, though undoubtedly a very ancient  constellation, occupies the place of his other arm. Giving to the  constellation the extent thus implied, it exhibits (better than most  constellations) the character assigned to it. One can readily picture to  oneself the figure of a Herdsman with upraised arms driving Ursa Major  before him. This view is confirmed, I think, by the fact that the Arabs  called this constellation the Vociferator.    Bootes contains many beautiful objects. Partly on this account, and  partly because this is a constellation with which the observer should be  specially familiar, a map of it is given in Plate 4.    Arcturus has a distant pale lilac companion, and is in other respects a  remarkable and interesting object. It is of a ruddy yellow colour.  Schmidt, indeed, considers that the star has changed colour of late  years, and that whereas it was once very red it is now a yellow star.  This opinion does not seem well grounded, however. The star _may_ have  been more ruddy once than now, though no other observer has noticed such  a peculiarity; but it is certainly not a pure yellow star at present (at  any rate as seen in our latitude). Owing probably to the difference of  colour between Vega, Capella and Arcturus, photometricians have not been  perfectly agreed as to the relative brilliancy of these objects. Some  consider Vega the most brilliant star in the northern heavens, while  others assign the superiority to Capella. The majority, however,  consider Arcturus the leading northern brilliant, and in the whole  heavens place three only before him, viz., Sirius, Canopus, and [alpha]  Centauri. Arcturus is remarkable in other respects. His proper motion is  very considerable, so great in fact that since the time of Ptolemy the  southerly motion (alone) of Arcturus has carried him over a space nearly  half as great again as the moon's apparent diameter. One might expect  that so brilliant a star, apparently travelling at a rate so great  compared with the average proper motions of the stars, must be  comparatively near to us. This, however, has not been found to be the  case. Arcturus is, indeed, one of the stars whose distance it has been  found possible to estimate roughly. But he is found to be some three  times as far from us as the small star 61 Cygni, and more than seven  times as far from us as [alpha] Centauri.    The star [delta] Bootis is a wide and unequal double, the smaller  component being only of the ninth magnitude.    Above Alkaid the last star in the tail of the Greater Bear, there will  be noticed three small stars. These are [theta], [iota], and [kappa]  Bootis, and are usually placed in star-maps near the upraised hand of  the Herdsman. The two which lie next to Alkaid, [iota] and [kappa], are  interesting doubles. The former is a wide double (see Plate 5), the  magnitudes of components 4 and 8, their colours yellow and white. The  larger star of this pair is itself double. The star [kappa] Bootis is  not so wide a double (see Plate 5), the magnitudes of the components 5  and 8, their colours white and faint blue--a beautiful object.    The star [xi] Bootis is an exceedingly interesting object. It is  double, the colours of the components being orange-yellow and ruddy  purple, their magnitudes 3-1/2 and 6-1/2. When this star was first  observed by Herschel in 1780 the position of the components was quite  different from that presented in Plate 5. They were also much closer,  being separated by a distance of less than 3-1/2 seconds. Since that  time the smaller component has traversed nearly a full quadrant, its  distance from its primary first increasing, till in 1831 the stars were  nearly 7-1/2 seconds apart, and thence slowly diminishing, so that at  present the stars are less than 5 seconds apart. The period usually  assigned to the revolution of this binary system is 117 years, and the  period of peri-astral passage is said to be 1779. It appears to me,  however, that the period should be about 108 years, the epoch of last  peri-astral passage 1777 and of next peri-astral passage, therefore,  1885. The angular motion of the secondary round the primary is now  rapidly increasing, and the distance between the components is rapidly  diminishing, so that in a few years a powerful telescope will be  required to separate the pair.    Not far from [xi] is [pi] Bootis, represented in Plate 5 as a somewhat  closer double, but in reality--now at any rate--a slightly wider pair,  since the distance between the components of [xi] has greatly diminished  of late. Both the components of [pi] are white, and their magnitudes are  3-1/2 and 6.    We shall next turn to an exceedingly beautiful and delicate object, the  double star [epsilon] Bootis, known also as Mirac and, on account of its  extreme beauty, called Pulcherrima by Admiral Smyth. The components of  this beautiful double are of the third and seventh magnitude, the  primary orange, the secondary sea-green. The distance separating the  components is about 3 seconds, perhaps more; it appears to have been  slowly increasing during the past ten or twelve years. Smyth assigns to  this system a period of revolution of 980 years, but there can be little  doubt that the true period is largely in excess of this estimate.  Observers in southern latitudes consider that the colours of the  components are yellow and blue, not orange and green as most of our  northern observers have estimated them.    A little beyond the lower left-hand corner of the map is the star  [delta] Serpentis, in the position shown in the Frontispiece, Map 3.  This is the star which at the hour and season depicted in Map 2 formed  the uppermost of a vertical row of stars, which has now assumed an  almost horizontal position. The components of [delta] Serpentis are  about 3-1/2 seconds apart, their magnitudes 3 and 5, both white.    The stars [theta]^{1} and [theta]^{2} Serpentis form a wide double, the  distance between the components being 21-1/2 seconds. They are nearly  equal in magnitude, the primary being 4-1/2, the secondary 5. Both are  yellow, the primary being of a paler yellow colour than the smaller  star. But the observer may not know where to look for [theta] Serpentis,  since it falls in a part of the constellation quite separated from that  part in which [delta] Serpentis lies. In fact [theta] lies on the  extreme easterly verge of the eastern half of the constellation. It is  to be looked for at about the same elevation as the brilliant Altair,  and (as to azimuth) about midway between Altair and the south.    The stars [alpha]^{1} and [alpha]^{2} Librae form a wide double, perhaps  just separable by the naked eye in very favourable weather. The larger  component is of the third, the smaller of the sixth magnitude, the  former yellow the"]]]
