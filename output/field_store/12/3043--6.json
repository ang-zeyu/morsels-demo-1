THE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE INFANTILE SEXUALITY    For reasons which we shall discuss later we will take as a model of the  infantile sexual manifestations thumbsucking (pleasure-sucking), to  which the Hungarian pediatrist, Lindner, has devoted an excellent  essay.[9]    *Thumbsucking.*--Thumbsucking, which manifests itself in the nursing  baby and which may be continued till maturity or throughout life,  consists in a rhythmic repetition of sucking contact with the mouth (the  lips), wherein the purpose of taking nourishment is excluded. A part of  the lip itself, the tongue, which is another preferable skin region  within reach, and even the big toe--may be taken as objects for sucking.  Simultaneously, there is also a desire to grasp things, which manifests  itself in a rhythmical pulling of the ear lobe and which may cause the  child to grasp a part of another person (generally the ear) for the same  purpose. The pleasure-sucking is connected with an entire exhaustion of  attention and leads to sleep or even to a motor reaction in the form of  an orgasm.[10] Pleasure-sucking is often combined with a rubbing contact  with certain sensitive parts of the body, such as the breast and  external genitals. It is by this road that many children go from  thumb-sucking to masturbation.    Lindner himself has recognized the sexual nature of this action and  openly emphasized it. In the nursery thumbsucking is often treated in  the same way as any other sexual \"naughtiness\" of the child. A very  strong objection was raised against this view by many pediatrists and  neurologists which in part is certainly due to the confusion of the  terms \"sexual\" and \"genital.\" This contradiction raises the difficult  question, which cannot be rejected, namely, in what general traits do we  wish to recognize the sexual manifestations of the child. I believe that  the association of the manifestations into which we gained an insight  through psychoanalytic investigation justify us in claiming thumbsucking  as a sexual activity and in studying through it the essential features  of the infantile sexual activity.    *Autoerotism.*--It is our duty here to arrange this state of affairs  differently. Let us insist that the most striking character of this  sexual activity is that the impulse is not directed against other  persons but that it gratifies itself on its own body; to use the happy  term invented by Havelock Ellis, we will say that it is autoerotic.[11]    It is, moreover, clear that the action of the thumbsucking child is  determined by the fact that it seeks a pleasure which has already been  experienced and is now remembered. Through the rhythmic sucking on a  portion of the skin or mucous membrane it finds the gratification in the  simplest way. It is also easy to conjecture on what occasions the child  first experienced this pleasure which it now strives to renew. The first  and most important activity in the child's life, the sucking from the  mother's breast (or its substitute), must have acquainted it with this  pleasure. We would say that the child's lips behaved like an _erogenous  zone_, and that the excitement through the warm stream of milk was  really the cause of the pleasurable sensation. To be sure, the  gratification of the erogenous zone was at first united with the  gratification of taking nourishment. He who sees a satiated child sink  back from the mother's breast, and fall asleep with reddened cheeks and  blissful smile, will have to admit that this picture remains as typical  of the expression of sexual gratification in later life. But the desire  for repetition of the sexual gratification is separated from the desire  for taking nourishment; a separation which becomes unavoidable with the  appearance of the teeth when the nourishment is no longer sucked in but  chewed. The child does not make use of a strange object for sucking but  prefers its own skin because it is more convenient, because it thus  makes itself independent of the outer world which it cannot yet control,  and because in this way it creates for itself, as it were, a second,  even if an inferior, erogenous zone. The inferiority of this second  region urges it later to seek the same parts, the lips of another  person. (\"It is a pity that I cannot kiss myself,\" might be attributed  to it.)    Not all children suck their thumbs. It may be assumed that it is found  only in children in whom the erogenous significance of the lip-zone is  constitutionally reenforced. Children in whom this is retained are  habitual kissers as adults and show a tendency to perverse kissing, or  as men they have a marked desire for drinking and smoking. But if  repression comes into play they experience disgust for eating and evince  hysterical vomiting. By virtue of the community of the lip-zone the  repression encroaches upon the impulse of nourishment. Many of my female  patients showing disturbances in eating, such as hysterical globus,  choking sensations, and vomiting, have been energetic thumbsuckers  during infancy.    In the thumbsucking or pleasure-sucking we have already been able to  observe the three essential characters of an infantile sexual  manifestation. The latter has its origin in conjunction with a bodily  function which is very important for life, it does not yet know any  sexual object, it is _autoerotic_ and its sexual aim is under the  control of an _erogenous zone_. Let us assume for the present that these  characters also hold true for most of the other activities of the  infantile sexual impulse.      THE SEXUAL AIM OF THE INFANTILE SEXUALITY    *The Characters of the Erogenous Zones.*--From the example of  thumbsucking we may gather a great many points useful for the  distinguishing of an erogenous zone. It is a portion of skin or mucous  membrane in which the stimuli produce a feeling of pleasure of definite  quality. There is no doubt that the pleasure-producing stimuli are  governed by special determinants which we do not know. The rhythmic  characters must play some part in them and this strongly suggests an  analogy to tickling. It does not, however, appear so certain whether the  character of the pleasurable feeling evoked by the stimulus can be  designated as \"peculiar,\" and in what part of this peculiarity the  sexual factor exists. Psychology is still groping in the dark when it  concerns matters of pleasure and pain, and the most cautious assumption  is therefore the most advisable. We may perhaps later come upon reasons  which seem to support the peculiar quality of the sensation of pleasure.    The erogenous quality may adhere most notably to definite regions of the  body. As is shown by the example of thumbsucking, there are predestined  erogenous zones. But the same example also shows that any other region  of skin or mucous membrane may assume the function of an erogenous zone;  it must therefore carry along a certain adaptability. The production of  the sensation of pleasure therefore depends more on the quality of the  stimulus than on the nature of the bodily region. The thumbsucking child  looks around on his body and selects any portion of it for  pleasure-sucking, and becoming accustomed to it, he then prefers it. If  he accidentally strikes upon a predestined region, such as breast,  nipple or genitals, it naturally has the preference. A quite analogous  tendency to displacement is again found in the symptomatology of  hysteria. In this neurosis the repression mostly concerns the genital  zones proper; these in turn transmit their excitation to the other  erogenous zones, usually dormant in mature life, which then behave  exactly like genitals. But besides this, just as in thumbsucking, any  other region of the body may become endowed with the excitation of the  genitals and raised to an erogenous zone. Erogenous and hysterogenous  zones show the same characters.[12]    *The Infantile Sexual Aim.*--The sexual aim of the infantile impulse  consists in the production of gratification through the proper  excitation of this or that selected erogenous zone. In order to leave a  desire for its repetition this gratification must have been previously  experienced, and we may be sure that nature has devised definite means  so as not to leave this occurrence to mere chance. The arrangement which  has fulfilled this purpose for the lip-zone we have already discussed;  it is the simultaneous connection of this part of the body with the  taking of nourishment. We shall also meet other similar mechanisms as  sources of sexuality. The state of desire for repetition of  gratification can be recognized through a peculiar feeling of tension  which in itself is rather of a painful character, and through a  centrally-determined feeling of itching or sensitiveness which is  projected into the peripheral erogenous zone. The sexual aim may  therefore be formulated as follows: the chief object is to substitute  for the projected feeling of sensitiveness in the erogenous zone that  outer stimulus which removes the feeling of sensitiveness by evoking the  feeling of gratification. This external stimulus consists usually in a  manipulation which is analogous to sucking.    It is in full accord with our physiological knowledge if the desire  happens to be awakened also peripherally through an actual change in the  erogenous zone. The action is puzzling only to some extent as one  stimulus for its suppression seems to want another applied to the same  place.      THE MASTURBATIC SEXUAL MANIFESTATIONS[13]    It is a matter of great satisfaction to know that there is nothing  further of greater importance to learn about the sexual activity of the  child after the impulse of one erogenous zone has become comprehensible  to us. The most pronounced differences are found in the action necessary  for the gratification, which consists in sucking for the lip zone and  which must be replaced by other muscular actions according to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14970"],[0,"Academica (#11)"],[1," villa, at which the scene was now  laid, was close to the Lucrine lake[292]. With regard to the feigned date  of the discourse, we may observe that at the very outset of the work it is  shown to be not far distant from the actual time of composition[293]. Many  allusions are made to recent events, such as the utter overthrow of the  Pompeian party, the death of Tullia[294], and the publication of the  _Hortensius_[295]. Between the date of Tullia's death and the writing of  the _Academica_, it can be shown that Varro, Cicero and Atticus could not  have met together at Cumae. Cicero therefore for once admits into his works  an impossibility in fact. This impossibility would at once occur to Varro,  and Cicero anticipates his wonder in the letter of dedication[296].    For the main facts of Varro's life the student must be referred to the  ordinary sources of information. A short account of the points of contact  between his life and that of Cicero, with a few words about his  philosophical opinions, are alone needed here. The first mention we have of  Varro in any of Cicero's writings is in itself sufficient to show his  character and the impossibility of anything like friendship between the  two. Varro had done the orator some service in the trying time which came  before the exile. In writing to Atticus Cicero had eulogised Varro; and in  the letter to which I refer he begs Atticus to send Varro the eulogy to  read, adding \"_Mirabiliter moratus est, sicut nosti,_ [Greek: elikta kai  ouden][297].\" All the references to Varro in the letters to Atticus are in  the same strain. Cicero had to be pressed to write Varro a letter of thanks  for supposed exertions in his behalf, during his exile[298]. Several  passages show that Cicero refused to believe in Varro's zeal, as reported  by Atticus[299]. On Cicero's return from exile, he and Varro remained in  the same semi-friendly state. About the year 54 B.C., as we have already  seen, Atticus in vain urged his friend to dedicate some work to the great  polymath. After the fall of the Pompeian cause, Cicero and Varro do seem to  have been drawn a little closer together. Eight letters, written mostly in  the year before the _Academica_ was published, testify to this  approximation[300]. Still they are all cold, forced and artificial; very  different from the letters Cicero addressed to his real intimates, such for  instance as Sulpicius, Caelius, Paetus, Plancus, and Trebatius. They all  show a fear of giving offence to the harsh temper of Varro, and a humility  in presence of his vast learning which is by no means natural to Cicero.  The negotiations between Atticus and Cicero with respect to the dedication  of the second edition, as detailed already, show sufficiently that this  slight increase in cordiality did not lead to friendship[301].    The philosophical views of Varro can be gathered with tolerable accuracy  from Augustine, who quotes considerably from, the work of Varro _De  Philosophia_[302]. Beyond doubt he was a follower of Antiochus and the  so-called Old Academy. How he selected this school from, among the 288  philosophies which he considered possible, by an elaborate and pedantic  process of exhaustion, may be read by the curious in Augustine. My notes on  the _Academica Posteriora_ will show that there is no reason for accusing  Cicero of having mistaken Varro's philosophical views. This supposition  owes its currency to Mueller, who, from Stoic phrases in the _De Lingua  Latina_, concluded that Varro had passed over to the Stoics before that  work was written. All that was Stoic in Varro came from Antiochus[303].    The exact specification of the changes in the arrangement of the  subject-matter, necessitated by the dedication to Varro, will be more  conveniently deferred till we come to the fragments of the second edition  preserved by Nonius and others. Roughly speaking, the following were the  contents of the four books. Book I.: the historico-philosophical exposition  of Antiochus' views, formerly given by Hortensius, now by Varro; then the  historical justification of the Philonian position, which Cicero had given  in the first edition as an answer to Hortensius[304]. Book II.: an  exposition by Cicero of Carneades' positive teaching, practically the same  as that given by Catulus in ed. I.; to this was appended, probably, that  foretaste of the negative arguments against dogmatism, which in ed. 1. had  formed part of the answer made by Cicero to Hortensius. Book III.: a speech  of Varro in reply to Cicero, closely corresponding to that of Lucullus in  ed. 1. Book IV.: Cicero's answer, substantially the same as in ed. 1.  Atticus must have been almost a [Greek: kophon prosopon].    I may here notice a fact which might puzzle the student. In some old  editions the _Lucullus_ is marked throughout as _Academicorum liber IV_.  This is an entire mistake, which arose from a wrong view of Nonius'  quotations, which are always from the _second_ edition, and can tell us  nothing about the constitution of the _first_. One other thing is worth  remark. Halm (as many before him had done) places the _Academica Priora_  before the _Posteriora_. This seems to me an unnatural arrangement; the  subject-matter of the _Varro_ is certainly prior, logically, to that of the  _Lucullus_.           *       *       *       *       *    M.

Varrone, venisse eum Roma pridie vesperi et, nisi de via fessus esset,  continuo ad nos venturum fuisse. Quod cum audissemus, nullam moram  interponendam putavimus quin videremus hominem nobiscum et studiis isdem et  vetustate amicitiae coniunctum. Itaque confestim ad eum ire perreximus,  paulumque cum _ab_ eius villa abessemus, ipsum ad nos venientem vidimus:  atque ilium complexi, ut mos amicorum est, satis eum longo intervallo ad  suam villam reduximus. 2. Hic pauca primo, atque ea percontantibus nobis,  ecquid forte Roma novi, Atticus: Omitte ista, quae nec percontari nec  audire sine molestia possumus, quaeso, inquit, et quaere potius ecquid ipse  novi. Silent enim diutius Musae Varronis quam solebant, nec tamen istum  cessare, sed celare quae scribat existimo. Minime vero, inquit ille:  intemperantis enim arbitror esse scribere quod occultari velit: sed habeo  opus magnum in manibus, idque iam pridem: ad hunc enim ipsum--me autem  dicebat--quaedam institui, quae et sunt magna sane et limantur a me  politius. 3. Et ego: Ista quidem, inquam, Varro, iam diu exspectans, non  audeo tamen flagitare: audivi enim e Libone nostro, cuius nosti  studium--nihil enim eius modi celare possumus--non te ea intermittere, sed  accuratius tractare nec de manibus umquam deponere. Illud autem mihi ante  hoc tempus numquam in mentem venit a te requirere: sed nunc, postea quam  sum ingressus res eas, quas tecum simul didici, mandare monumentis  philosophiamque veterem illam a Socrate ortam Latinis litteris illustrare,  quaero quid sit cur, cum multa scribas, genus hoc praetermittas, praesertim  cum et ipse in eo excellas et id studium totaque ea res longe ceteris et  studiis et artibus antecedat.    II. 4. Tum ille: Rem a me saepe deliberatam et multum agitatam requiris.  Itaque non haesitans respondebo, sed ea dicam, quae mihi sunt in promptu,  quod ista ipsa de re multum, ut dixi, et diu cogitavi. Nam cum philosophiam  viderem diligentissime Graecis litteris explicatam, existimavi, si qui de  nostris eius studio tenerentur, si essent Graecis doctrinis eruditi, Graeca  potius quam nostra lecturos: sin a Graecorum artibus et disciplinis  abhorrerent, ne haec quidem curaturos, quae sine eruditione Graeca  intellegi non possunt: itaque ea nolui scribere, quae nec indocti  intellegere possent nec docti legere curarent. 5. Vides autem--eadem enim  ipse didicisti--non posse nos Amafinii aut Rabirii similis esse, qui nulla  arte adhibita de rebus ante oculos positis volgari sermone disputant, nihil  definiunt, nihil partiuntur, nihil apta interrogatione concludunt, nullam  denique artem esse nec dicendi nec disserendi putant. Nos autem praeceptis  dialecticorum et oratorum etiam, quoniam utramque vim virtutem esse nostri  putant, sic parentes, ut legibus, verbis quoque novis cogimur uti, quae  docti, ut dixi, a Graecis petere malent, indocti ne a nobis quidem  accipient, ut frustra omnis suscipiatur _labor_. 6. Iam vero physica, si  Epicurum, id est, si Democritum probarem, possem scribere ita plane, ut  Amafinius. Quid est enim magnum, cum causas rerum efficientium sustuleris,  de corpusculorum--ita enim appellat atomos--concursione fortuita loqui?  Nostra tu physica nosti, quae cum contineantur ex effectione et ex materia  ea, quam fingit et format effectio, adhibenda etiam geometria est, quam  quibusnam quisquam enuntiare verbis aut quem ad intellegendum poterit  adducere? _Quid_, haec ipsa de vita et moribus, et de expetendis  fugiendisque rebus? Illi enim simpliciter pecudis et hominis idem bonum  esse censent: apud nostros autem non ignoras quae sit et quanta subtilitas.  7. Sive enim Zenonem sequare, magnum est efficere ut quis intelligat quid  sit illud verum et simplex bonum, quod non possit ab honestate seiungi:  quod bonum quale sit negat omnino Epicurus sine voluptatibus sensum  moventibus ne suspicari _quidem_. Si vero Academiam veterem persequamur,  quam nos, ut scis, probamus, quam erit illa acute explicanda nobis! quam  argute, quam obscure etiam contra Stoicos disserendum! Totum igitur illud  philosophiae studium mihi quidem ipse sumo et ad vitae constantiam quantum  possum et ad delectationem animi, nec ullum arbitror, ut apud Platonem est,  maius aut melius a dis datum munus homini. 8. Sed meos amicos, in quibus  est studium, in Graeciam mitto, id est, ad Graecos ire iubeo, ut ea a  fontibus potius hauriant quam rivulos consectentur. Quae autem nemo"]]]
