He was an enormous frog, dull green with a  yellowish vest--which showed that he was a male--but with the most  brilliant ear drums I had ever seen. They fairly glowed with  iridescent color, each in its ring of bright yellow. When I tried to  catch him (very quietly, for the bear was somewhere just above on the  ridge) in order to examine these drums, he dived under the canoe and  watched me from a distance.    In front of me, in the shallow water along shore, four more large  frogs were sunning themselves among the lily pads. I watched them  carelessly while waiting for the bear. After an hour or two I noticed  that three of these frogs changed their positions slightly, turning  from time to time so as to warm the entire body at nature's fireplace.  But the fourth was more deliberate and philosophical, thinking  evidently that if he simply sat still long enough the sun would do the  turning. When I came, about eleven o'clock, he was sitting on the  shore by a green stone, his fore feet lapped by tiny ripples, the sun  full on his back. For three hours, while I watched there, he never  moved a muscle. Then the bear came, and I left him for more exciting  things.    Late in the afternoon I came back to get some of the big frogs for  breakfast. Chigwooltz, he with the ear drums, was the first to see me,  and came pushing his way among the lily pads toward the canoe. But  when I dangled a red ibis fly in front of him, he dived promptly, and  I saw his head come up by a black root, where he sat, thinking himself  invisible, and watched me.    Chigwooltz the second, he of the green stone and the patient  disposition, was still sitting in the same place. The sun had turned  round; it was now warming his other side. His all-day sun bath  surprised me so that I let him alone, to see how long he would sit  still, and went fishing for other frogs.    Two big ones showed their heads among the pads some twenty feet apart.  Pushing up so as to make a triangle with my canoe, I dangled a red  ibis impartially between them. For two or three long minutes neither  moved so much as an eyelid. Then one seemed to wake suddenly from a  trance, or to be touched by an electric wire, for he came scrambling  in a desperate hurry over the lily pads. Swimming was too slow; he  jumped fiercely out of water at the red challenge, making a great  splash and commotion.    Fishing for big frogs, by the way, is no tame sport. The red seems to  excite them tremendously, and they take the fly like a black salmon.    But the moment the first frog started, frog number two waked up and  darted forward, making less noise but coming more swiftly. The first  frog had jumped once for the fly and missed it, when the other leaped  upon him savagely, and a fight began, while the ibis lay neglected on  a lily pad. They pawed and bit each other fiercely for several  minutes; then the second frog, a little smaller than the other, got  the grip he wanted and held it. He clasped his fore legs tight about  his rival's neck and began to strangle him slowly. I knew well how  strong Chigwooltz is in his forearms, and that his fightings and  wrestlings are desperate affairs; but I did not know till then how  savage he can be. He had gripped from behind by a clever dive, so as  to use his weight when the right moment came. Tighter and tighter he  hugged; the big frog's eyes seemed bursting from his head, and his  mouth was forced slowly open. Then his savage opponent lunged upon him  with his weight, and forced his head under water to finish him.    The whole thing seemed scarcely more startling to the luckless big  frog than to the watcher in the canoe. It was all so brutal, so  deliberately planned! The smaller frog, knowing that he was no match  for the other in strength, had waited cunningly till he was all  absorbed in the red fly, and then stole upon him, intending to finish  him first and the little red thing afterwards. He would have done it  too; for the big frog was at his last gasp, when I interfered and put  them both in my net.    Meanwhile a third frog had come _walloping_ over the lily pads from  somewhere out of sight, and grabbed the fly while the other two were  fighting about it. It was he who first showed me a curious frog trick.  When I lifted him from the water on the end of my line, he raised his  hands above his head, as if he had been a man, and grasped the line,  and tried to lift himself, hand over hand, so as to take the strain  from his mouth.--And I could never catch another frog like that.    Next morning, as I went to the early fishing, Chigwooltz, the  patient, sat by the same stone, his fore feet at the edge of the same  bronze lily leaf. At noon he was still there; in twenty-four hours at  least he had not moved a muscle.    At twilight I was following a bear along the shore. It was the  restless season, when bears are moving constantly; scarcely a twilight  passed that I did not meet one or more on their wanderings. This one  was heading for the upper end of the lake, traveling in the shallow  water near shore; and I was just behind him, stealing along in my  canoe to see what queer thing he would do. He was in no hurry, as most  other bears were, but went nosing along shore, acting much as a fat  pig would in the same place. As he approached the alder point he  stopped suddenly, and twisted his head a bit, and set his ears, as a  dog does that sees something very interesting. Then he began to steal  forward. Could it be--I shot my canoe forward--yes, it was Chigwooltz,  still sitting by the green stone, with his eye, like Bunsby's, on the  coast of Greenland. In thirty-two hours, to my knowledge, he had not  stirred.    Mooween the bear crept nearer; he was crouching now like a cat,  stealing along in the soft mud behind Chigwooltz so as to surprise  him. I saw him raise one paw slowly, cautiously, high above his head.  Down it came, _souse_! sending up a shower of mud and water. And  Chigwooltz the restful, who could sit still thirty-two hours without  getting stiff in the joints, and then dodge the sweep of Mooween's  paw, went splashing away _hippety-ippety_ over the lily pads to some  water grass, where he said _K'tung!_ and disappeared for good.    A few days later Simmo and I moved camp to a grove of birches just  above the alder point. From behind my tent an old game path led down  to the bay where the big frogs lived. There were scores of them there;  the chorus at night, with its multitude of voices running from a  whistling treble to deep, deep bass, was at times tremendous. It was  here that I had the first good opportunity of watching frogs feeding.    Chigwooltz, I found, is a perfect gourmand and a cannibal, eating,  besides his regular diet of flies and beetles and water snails, young  frogs, and crawfish, and turtles, and fish of every kind. But few have  ever seen him at his hunting, for he is active only at night or on  dark days.    I used to watch them from the shore or from my canoe at twilight. Just  outside the lily pads a shoal of minnows would be playing at the  surface, or small trout would be rising freely for the night insects.  Then, if you watched sharply, you would see gleaming points of light,  the eyes of Chigwooltz, stealing out, with barely a ripple, to the  edge of the pads. And then, when some big feeding trout drove the  minnows or small fry close in, there would be a heavy plunge from the  shadow of the pads; and you would hear Chigwooltz splashing if the  fish were a larger one than he expected.    That is why small frogs are so deadly afraid if you take them outside  the fringe of lily pads. They know that big hungry trout feed in from  the deeps, and that big frogs, savage cannibals every one, watch out  from the shadowy fringe of water plants. If you drop a little frog  there, in clear water, he will shoot in as fast as his frightened legs  will drive him, swimming first on top to avoid fish, diving deep as he  reaches the pads to avoid his hungry relatives; and so in to shallow  water and thick stems, where he can dodge about and the big frogs  cannot follow.    All sorts and conditions of frogs lived in that little bay. There was  one inquisitive fellow, who always came out of the pads and swam as  near as he could get whenever I appeared on the shore. Another would  sit in his favorite spot, under a stranded log, and let me come as  close as I would; but the moment I dangled the red ibis fly in front  of him, he would disappear like a wink, and not show himself again.  Another would follow the fly in a wild kangaroo dance over the lily  pads, going round and round the canoe as if bewitched, and would do  his best to climb in after the bit of color when I pulled it up slowly  over the bark. He afforded me so much good fun that I could not eat  him; though I always stopped to give him another dance, whenever I  went fishing for other frogs just like him. Further along shore lived  another, a perfect savage, so wild that I could never catch him, which  strangled or drowned two big frogs in a week, to my certain knowledge.  And then, one night when I was trying to find my canoe which I had  lost in the darkness, I came upon a frog migration, dozens and dozens  of them, all hopping briskly in the same direction. They had left the  stream, driven by some strange instinct, just like rats or squirrels,  and were going through the woods to the unknown destination that  beckoned them so strongly that they could not but follow.    The most curious and interesting bit of their strange life came out at  night, when they were fascinated by my light. I used sometimes to set  a candle on a piece of board for a float, and place it in the water  close to shore, where the ripples would set it dancing gently. Then I  would place a little screen of bark at the shore end of the float,  and sit down behind it in darkness.

Many witches are said to have been  burned: perhaps the only such case before the Reformation.  However it  fell out--all is obscure--Mar died in prison; while Albany, also a  prisoner on charges of treasonable intrigues with the inveterate Earl of  Douglas, in the English interest, escaped to France.    Douglas (1482) brought him to England, where he swore allegiance to  Edward IV., under whom, like Edward Balliol, he would hold Scotland if  crowned.  He was advancing on the Border with Edward's support and with  the Duke of Gloucester (Richard III.), and James had gone to Lauder to  encounter him, when the Earl of Angus headed a conspiracy of nobles, such  as Huntly, Lennox, and Buchan, seized Cochrane and other favourites of  James, and hanged them over Lauder Bridge.  The most tangible grievance  was the increasing debasement of the coinage.  James was immured at  Edinburgh, but, by a compromise, Albany was restored to rank and estates.  Meanwhile Gloucester captured Berwick, never to be recovered by Scotland.  In 1483 Albany renewed, with many of the nobles, his intrigues with  Edward for the betrayal of Scotland.  In some unknown way James separated  Albany from his confederates Atholl, Buchan, and Angus; Albany went to  England, betrayed the Castle of Dunbar to England, and was only checked  in his treasons by the death of Edward IV. (April 9, 1483), after which a  full Parliament (July 7, 1483) condemned him and forfeited him in his  absence.  On July 22, 1484, he invaded Scotland with his ally, Douglas;  they were routed at Lochmaben, Douglas was taken, and, by singular  clemency, was merely placed in seclusion in the Monastery of Lindores,  while Albany, escaping to France, perished in a tournament, leaving a  descendant, who later, in the minority of James V., makes a figure in  history.    The death of Richard III. (August 18, 1485) and the accession of the  prudent Henry VII. gave James a moment of safety.  He turned his  attention to the Church, and determined to prosecute for treason such  Scottish clerics as purchased benefices through Rome.  He negotiated for  three English marriages, including that of his son James, Duke of  Rothesay, to a daughter of Edward IV.; he also negotiated for the  recovery of Berwick, taken by Gloucester during Albany's invasion of  1482.  After his death, and before it, James was accused, for these  reasons, of disloyal dealings with England; and such nobles as Angus, up  to the neck as they were in treason and rebellion, raised a party against  him on the score that he was acting as they did.  The almost aimless  treachery of the Douglases, Red or Black, endured for centuries from the  reign of David II. to that of James VI.  Many nobles had received no  amnesty for the outrage of Lauder Bridge; their hopes turned to the heir  of the Crown, James, Duke of Rothesay.  We see them offering peace for an  indemnity in a Parliament of October 1487; the Estates refused all such  pardons for a space of seven years; the king's party was manifestly the  stronger.  He was not to be intimidated; he offended Home and the Humes  by annexing the Priory of Coldingham (which they regarded as their own)  to the Royal Chapel at Stirling.  The inveterate Angus, with others,  induced Prince James to join them under arms.  James took the  Chancellorship from Argyll and sent envoys to England.    The rebels, proclaiming the prince as king, intrigued with Henry VII.;  James was driven across the Forth, and was supported in the north by his  uncle, Atholl, and by Huntly, Crawford, and Lord Lindsay of the Byres,  Errol, Glamis, Forbes, and Tullibardine, and the chivalry of Angus and  Strathtay.  Attempts at pacification failed; Stirling Castle was betrayed  to the rebels, and James's host, swollen by the loyal burgesses of the  towns, met the Border spears of Home and Hepburn, the Galloway men, and  the levies of Angus at Sauchie Burn, near Bannockburn.    In some way not understood, James, riding without a single knight or  squire, fell from his horse, which had apparently run away with him, at  Beaton's Mill, and was slain in bed, it was rumoured, by a priest,  feigned or false, who heard his confession.  The obscurity of his reign  hangs darkest over his death, and the virulent Buchanan slandered him in  his grave.  Under his reign, Henryson, the greatest of the Chaucerian  school in Scotland, produced his admirable poems.  Many other poets whose  works are lost were flourishing; and _The Wallace_, that elaborate  plagiarism from Barbour's 'The Brus,' was composed, and attributed to  Blind Harry, a paid minstrel about the Court. {71}          CHAPTER XIV.  JAMES IV.      The new king, with Angus for his Governor, Argyll for his Chancellor, and  with the Kers and Hepburns in office, was crowned at Scone about June 25,  1488.  He was nearly seventeen, no child, but energetic in business as in  pleasure, though lifelong remorse for his rebellion gnawed at his heart.  He promptly put down a rebellion of the late king's friends and of the  late king's foe, Lennox, then strong in the possession of Dumbarton  Castle, which, as it commands the sea-entrance by Clyde, is of great  importance in the reign of Mary and James VI.  James III. must have paid  attention to the navy, which, under Sir Andrew Wood, already faced  English pirates triumphantly.  James IV. spent much money on his fleet,  buying timber from France, for he was determined to make Scotland a power  of weight in Europe.  But at the pinch his navy vanished like a mist.    Spanish envoys and envoys from the Duchess of Burgundy visited James in  1488-1489; he was in close relations with France and Denmark, and caused  anxieties to the first Tudor king, Henry VII., who kept up the Douglas  alliance with Angus, and bought over Scottish politicians.  While James,  as his account-books show, was playing cards with Angus, that traitor was  also negotiating the sale of Hermitage Castle, the main hold of the  Middle Border, to England.  He was detected, and the castle was intrusted  to a Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell; it was still held by Queen Mary's  Bothwell in 1567.  The Hepburns rose to the earldom of Bothwell on the  death of Ramsay, a favourite of James III., who (1491) had arranged to  kidnap James IV. with his brother, and hand them over to Henry VII., for  277 pounds, 13s. 4d.!  Nothing came of this, and a truce with England was  arranged in 1491.  Through four reigns, till James VI. came to the  English throne, the Tudor policy was to buy Scottish traitors, and  attempt to secure the person of the Scottish monarch.    Meanwhile, the Church was rent by jealousies between the holder of the  newly-created Archbishop of Glasgow (1491) and the Archbishop of St  Andrews, and disturbed by the Lollards, in the region which was later the  centre of the fiercest Covenanters,--Kyle in Ayrshire.  But James laughed  away the charges against the heretics (1494), whose views were, on many  points, those of John Knox.  In 1493-1495 James dealt in the usual way  with the Highlanders and \"the wicked blood of the Isles\": some were  hanged, some imprisoned, some became sureties for the peacefulness of  their clans.  In 1495, by way of tit-for-tat against English schemes,  James began to back the claims of Perkin Warbeck, pretending to be  Richard, Duke of York, escaped from the assassins employed by Richard  III.  Perkin, whoever he was, had probably been intriguing between  Ireland and Burgundy since 1488.  He was welcomed by James at Stirling in  November 1495, and was wedded to the king's cousin, Catherine Gordon,  daughter of the Earl of Huntly, now supreme in the north.  Rejecting a  daughter of England, and Spanish efforts at pacification, James prepared  to invade England in Perkin's cause; the scheme was sold by Ramsay, the  would-be kidnapper, and came to no more than a useless raid of September  1496, followed by a futile attempt and a retreat in July 1497.  The  Spanish envoy, de Ayala, negotiated a seven-years' truce in September,  after Perkin had failed and been taken at Taunton.    The Celts had again risen while James was busy in the Border; he put them  down, and made Argyll Lieutenant of the Isles.  Between the Campbells and  the Huntly Gordons, as custodians of the peace, the fighting clans were  expected to be more orderly.  On the other hand, a son of Angus Og,  himself usually reckoned a bastard of the Lord of the Isles, gave much  trouble.  Angus had married a daughter of the Argyll of his day; their  son, Donald Dubh, was kidnapped (or, rather, his mother was kidnapped  before his birth) for Argyll; he now escaped, and in 1503, found allies  among the chiefs, did much scathe, was taken in 1506, but was as active  as ever forty years later.    The central source of these endless Highland feuds was the family of the  Macdonalds, Lords of the Isles, claiming the earldom of Ross, resisting  the Lowland influences and those of the Gordons and Campbells (Huntly and  Argyll), and seeking aid from England.  With the capture of Donald Dubh  (1506) the Highlanders became for the while comparatively quiescent;  under Lennox and Argyll they suffered in the defeat of Flodden.    From 1497 to 1503 Henry VII. was negotiating for the marriage of James to  his daughter Margaret Tudor; the marriage was celebrated on August 8,  1503, and a century later the great grandson of Margaret, James VI. came  to the English throne.  But marriage does not make friendship.  There had  existed since 1491 a secret alliance by which Scotland was bound to  defend France if attacked by England.  Henry's negotiations for the  kidnapping of James were of April of the same year.  Margaret, the young  queen, after her marriage, was soon involved in bitter quarrels over her  dowry with her own family; the slaying of a Sir Robert Ker,"]]]
