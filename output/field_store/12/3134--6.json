P: Your Allah is One Allah; there is no God save Him, the Beneficent,  the Merciful.    S: And your Allah is one Allah! there is no god but He; He is the  Beneficent, the Merciful.    002.164  Y: Behold! in the creation of the heavens and the earth; in the  alternation of the night and the day; in the sailing of the ships  through the ocean for the profit of mankind; in the rain which Allah  Sends down from the skies, and the life which He gives therewith to an  earth that is dead; in the beasts of all kinds that He scatters through  the earth; in the change of the winds, and the clouds which they Trail  like their slaves between the sky and the earth;- (Here) indeed are  Signs for a people that are wise.    P: Lo! In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the difference  of night and day, and the ships which run upon the sea with that which  is of use to men, and the water which Allah sendeth down from the sky,  thereby reviving the earth after its death, and dispersing all kinds of  beasts therein, and (in) the ordinance of the winds, and the clouds  obedient between heaven and earth: are signs (of Allah's Sovereignty)  for people who have sense.    S: Most surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the  alternation of the night and the day, and the ships that run in the sea  with that which profits men, and the water that Allah sends down from  the cloud, then gives life with it to the earth after its death and  spreads in it all (kinds of) animals, and the changing of the winds and  the clouds made subservient between the heaven and the earth, there are  signs for a people who understand.    002.165  Y: Yet there are men who take (for worship) others besides Allah, as  equal (with Allah): They love them as they should love Allah. But those  of Faith are overflowing in their love for Allah. If only the  unrighteous could see, behold, they would see the penalty: that to  Allah belongs all power, and Allah will strongly enforce the penalty.    P: Yet of mankind are some who take unto themselves (objects of worship  which they set as) rivals to Allah, loving them with a love like (that  which is the due) of Allah (only) - those who believe are stauncher in  their love for Allah - Oh, that those who do evil had but known, (on  the day) when they behold the doom, that power belongeth wholly to  Allah, and that Allah is severe in punishment!    S: And there are some among men who take for themselves objects of  worship besides Allah, whom they love as they love Allah, and those who  believe are stronger in love for Allah and O, that those who are unjust  had seen, when they see the chastisement, that the power is wholly  Allah's and that Allah is severe in requiting (evil).    002.166  Y: Then would those who are followed clear themselves of those who  follow (them): They would see the penalty, and all relations between  them would be cut off.    P: (On the day) when those who were followed disown those who followed  (them), and they behold the doom, and all their aims collapse with  them.    S: When those who were followed shall renounce those who followed  (them), and they see the chastisement and their ties are cut asunder.    002.167  Y: And those who followed would say: \"If only We had one more chance, We  would clear ourselves of them, as they have cleared themselves of us.\"  Thus will Allah show them (The fruits of) their deeds as (nothing but)  regrets. Nor will there be a way for them out of the Fire.    P: And those who were but followers will say: If a return were possible  for us, we would disown them even as they have disowned us. Thus will  Allah show them their own deeds as anguish for them, and they will not  emerge from the Fire.    S: And those who followed shall say: Had there been for us a return,  then we would renounce them as they have renounced us. Thus will Allah  show them their deeds to be intense regret to them, and they shall not  come forth from the fire.    002.168  Y: O ye people! Eat of what is on earth, Lawful and good; and do not  follow the footsteps of the evil one, for he is to you an avowed enemy.    P: O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and wholesome in the earth,  and follow not the footsteps of the devil. Lo! he is an open enemy for  you.    S: O men! eat the lawful and good things out of what is in the earth,  and do not follow the footsteps of the Shaitan; surely he is your open  enemy.    002.169  Y: For he commands you what is evil and shameful, and that ye should say  of Allah that of which ye have no knowledge.    P: He enjoineth upon you only the evil and the foul, and that ye should  tell concerning Allah that which ye know not.    S: He only enjoins you evil and indecency, and that you may speak  against Allah what you do not know.    002.170  Y: When it is said to them: \"Follow what Allah hath revealed:\" They say:  \"Nay! we shall follow the ways of our fathers.\" What! even though their  fathers Were void of wisdom and guidance?    P: And when it is said unto them: Follow that which Allah hath revealed,  they say: We follow that wherein we found our fathers. What! Even  though their fathers were wholly unintelligent and had no guidance?    S: And when it is said to them, Follow what Allah has revealed, they  say: Nay! we follow what we found our fathers upon. What! and though  their fathers had no sense at all, nor did they follow the right way.    002.171  Y: The parable of those who reject Faith is as if one were to shout Like  a goat-herd, to things that listen to nothing but calls and cries:  Deaf, dumb, and blind, they are void of wisdom.    P: The likeness of those who disbelieve (in relation to the messenger)  is as the likeness of one who calleth unto that which heareth naught  except a shout and cry. Deaf, dumb, blind, therefore they have no  sense.    S: And the parable of those who disbelieve is as the parable of one who  calls out to that which hears no more than a call and a cry; deaf, dumb  (and) blind, so they do not understand.    002.172  Y: O ye who believe! Eat of the good things that We have provided for  you, and be grateful to Allah, if it is Him ye worship.    P: O ye who believe! Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided  you, and render thanks to Allah if it is (indeed) He Whom ye worship.    S: O you who believe! eat of the good things that We have provided you  with, and give thanks to Allah if Him it is that you serve.    002.173  Y: He hath only forbidden you dead meat, and blood, and the flesh of  swine, and that on which any other name hath been invoked besides that  of Allah. But if one is forced by necessity, without wilful  disobedience, nor transgressing due limits,- then is he guiltless. For  Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.    P: He hath forbidden you only carrion, and blood, and swineflesh, and  that which hath been immolated to (the name of) any other than Allah.  But he who is driven by necessity, neither craving nor transgressing,  it is no sin for him. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.    S: He has only forbidden you what dies of itself, and blood, and flesh  of swine, and that over which any other (name) than (that of) Allah has  been invoked; but whoever is driven to necessity, not desiring, nor  exceeding the limit, no sin shall be upon him; surely Allah is  Forgiving, Merciful.    002.174  Y: Those who conceal Allah's revelations in the Book, and purchase for  them a miserable profit,- they swallow into themselves naught but Fire;  Allah will not address them on the Day of Resurrection. Nor purify  them: Grievous will be their penalty.    P: Lo! those who hide aught of the Scripture which Allah hath revealed  and purchase a small gain therewith, they eat into their bellies  nothing else than fire. Allah will not speak to them on the Day of  Resurrection, nor will He make them grow. Theirs will be a painful  doom.    S: Surely those who conceal any part of the Book that Allah has revealed  and take for it a small price, they eat nothing but fire into their  bellies, and Allah will not speak to them on the day of resurrection,  nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful chastisement.    002.175  Y: They are the ones who buy Error in place of Guidance and Torment in  place of Forgiveness. Ah! what boldness (They show) for the Fire!    P: Those are they who purchase error at the price of guidance, and  torment at the price of pardon. How constant are they in their strife  to reach the Fire!    S: These are they who buy error for the right direction and chastisement  for forgiveness; how bold they are to encounter fire.    002.176  Y: (Their doom is) because Allah sent down the Book in truth but those  who seek causes of dispute in the Book are in a schism Far (from the  purpose).    P: That is because Allah hath revealed the Scripture with the truth. Lo!  those who find (a cause of) disagreement in the Scripture are in open  schism.    S: This is because Allah has revealed the Book with the truth; and  surely those who go against the Book are in a great opposition.    002.177  Y: It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces Towards east or West;  but it is righteousness- to believe in Allah and the Last Day, and the  Angels, and the Book, and the Messengers; to spend of your substance,  out of love for Him, for your kin, for orphans, for the needy, for the  wayfarer, for those who ask, and for the ransom of slaves; to be  steadfast in prayer, and practice regular charity; to fulfil the  contracts which ye have made; and to be firm and patient, in pain (or  suffering) and adversity, and throughout all periods of panic. Such are  the people of truth, the Allah-fearing.    P: It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces to the East and the  West; but righteous is he who believeth in Allah and the Last Day and  the angels and the Scripture and the prophets; and giveth wealth, for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16957"],[0,"Mr. Sponge's Sporting Tour (#11)"],[1," the road, or--'    'Aye, aye,' interrupted Waffles, 'I know all that; but what I want to know  is, whether we can make sure of a run. We want to give this great  metropolitan swell a benefit. You know who I mean?'    'The gen'leman as is com'd to the Brunswick, I 'spose,' replied Tom; 'at  least as _is_ comin', for I've not heard that he's com'd yet.'    'Oh, but he _has_,' replied Mr. Waffles, 'and I make no doubt will be out  to-morrow.'    'S--o--o,' observed Tom, in a long drawled note.    'Well, now! do you think you can engage to give us a run?' asked Mr.  Waffles, seeing his huntsman did not seem inclined to help him to his  point.    'I'll do my best,' replied Tom, cautiously running the many contingencies  through his mind.    'Take another drop of something,' said Mr. Waffles, again raising the Fox's  head. 'What'll you have?'    'Port, if you please,' replied Tom.    'There,' said Mr. Waffles, handing him another bumper; 'drink Fox-hunting.'    'Fox-huntin',' said old Tom, quaffing off the measure, as before. A flush  of life came into his weather-beaten face, just as a glow of heat enlivens  a blacksmith's hearth, after a touch of the bellows.    'You must never let this bumptious cock beat us,' observed Mr. Waffles.    'No--o--o,' replied Tom, adding, 'there's no fear of that.'    'But he swears he _will_!' exclaimed Mr. Caingey Thornton. 'He swears there  isn't a man shall come within a field of him.'    'Indeed,' observed Tom, with a twinkle of his little bright eyes.    'I tell you what, Tom,' observed Mr. Waffles, 'we must sarve him out,  somehow.'    'Oh! he'll sarve hissel' out, in all probability,' replied Tom; carelessly  adding, 'these boastin' chaps always do.'    'Couldn't we contrive something,' asked Mr. Waffles, 'to draw him out?'    Tom was silent. He was a hunting huntsman, not a riding one.    'Have a glass of something,' said Mr. Waffles, again appealing to the Fox's  head.    'Thank you, sir, I've had a glass,' replied Tom, sinking the second one.    'What will you have?' asked Mr. Waffles.    'Port, if you please,' replied Tom.    'Here it is,' rejoined Mr. Waffles, again handing him the measure.    Up went the cup, over went the contents; but Tom set it down with a less  satisfied face than before. He had had enough. The left leg prop, too, gave  way, and he was nearly toppling on the table.    Having got a chair for the dilapidated old man, they again essayed to get  him into their line, with better success than before. Having plied him well  with port, they now plied him well with the stranger, and what with the one  and the other, and a glass or two of brandy-and-water, Tom became very  tractable, and it was ultimately arranged that they should have a drag over  the very stiffest parts of the country, wherein all who liked should take  part, but that Mr. Caingey Thornton and Mr. Spareneck should be especially  deputed to wait upon Mr. Sponge, and lead him into mischief. Of course it  was to be a 'profound secret,' and equally, of course, it stood a good  chance of being kept, seeing how many were in it, the additional number it  would have to be communicated to before it could be carried out, and the  happy state old Tom was in for arranging matters. Nevertheless, our friends  at the 'Imperial' congratulated themselves on their success; and after a  few minutes spent in discussing old Tom on his withdrawal, the party broke  up, to array themselves in the splendid dress uniform of the 'Hunt,' to  meet again at Miss Jumpheavy's ball.          CHAPTER IX    THE MEET--THE FIND, AND THE FINISH      [Illustration]    Early to bed and early to rise being among Mr. Sponge's maxims, he was  enjoying the view of the pantiles at the back of his hotel shortly after  daylight the next morning, a time about as difficult to fix in a November  day as the age of a lady of a 'certain age.' It takes even an expeditious  dresser ten minutes or a quarter of an hour extra the first time he has to  deal with boots and breeches; and Mr. Sponge being quite a pattern card in  his peculiar line, of course took a good deal more to get himself 'up'.    An accustomed eye could see a more than ordinary stir in the streets that  morning. Riding-masters and their assistants might be seen going along with  strings of saddled and side-saddled screws; flys began to roll at an  earlier hour, and natty tigers to kick about in buckskins prior to  departing with hunters, good, bad, and indifferent.    Each man had told his partner at Miss Jumpheavy's ball of the capital trick  they were going to play the stranger; and a desire to see the stranger, far  more than a desire to see the trick, caused many fair ones to forsake their  downy couches who had much better have kept them.    The world is generally very complaisant with regard to strangers, so long  as they _are_ strangers, generally making them out to be a good deal better  than they really are, and Mr. Sponge came in for his full share of stranger  credit. They not only brought all the twenty horses Leather said he had  scattered about to Laverick Wells, but made him out to have a house in  Eaton Square, a yacht at Cowes, and a first-rate moor in Scotland, and  some said a peerage in expectancy. No wonder that he 'drew,' as theatrical  people say.    Let us now suppose him breakfasted, and ready for a start.    He was 'got up' with uncommon care in the most complete style of the severe  order of sporting costume. It being now the commencement of the legitimate  hunting season--the first week in November--he availed himself of the  privileged period for turning out in everything new. Rejecting the now  generally worn cap, he adhered to the heavy, close-napped hat, described in  our opening chapter, whose connexion with his head, or back, if it came  off, was secured by a small black silk cord, hooked through the band by a  fox's tooth, and anchored to a button inside the haven of his low  coat-collar. His neck was enveloped in the ample folds of a large white  silk cravat, tied in a pointing diamond tie, and secured with a large  silver horse-shoe pin, the shoe being almost large enough for the foot of a  young donkey.    His low, narrow-collared coat was of the infinitesimal order; that is to  say, a coat, and yet as little of a coat as possible--very near a jacket,  in fact. The seams, of course, were outside, and were it not for the  extreme strength and evenness of the sewing and the evident intention of  the thing, an ignorant person might have supposed that he had had his coat  turned. A double layer of cloth extended the full length of the outside of  the sleeves, much in the fashion of the stage-coachmen's greatcoats in  former times; and instead of cuffs, the sleeves were carried out to the  ends of the fingers, leaving it to the fancy of the wearer to sport a long  cuff or a short cuff, or no cuff at all--just as the weather dictated.  Though the coat was single-breasted, he had a hole made on the button side,  to enable him to keep it together by means of a miniature snaffle, instead  of a button. The snaffle passed across his chest, from whence the coatee,  flowing easily back, displayed the broad ridge and furrow of a white cord  waistcoat, with a low step collar, the vest reaching low down his figure,  with large flap pockets and a nick out in front, like a coachman's.  Instead of buttons, the waistcoat was secured with foxes' tusks and catgut  loops, while a heavy curb chain, passing from one pocket to the other,  raised the impression that there was a watch in one and a bunch of seals in  the other. The waistcoat was broadly bound with white binding, and, like  the coat, evinced great strength and powers of resistance. His breeches  were of a still broader furrow than the waistcoat, looking as if the  ploughman had laid two ridges into one. They came low down the leg, and  were met by a pair of well-made, well put on, very brown topped boots, a  colour then unknown at Laverick Wells. His spurs were bright and heavy,  with formidable necks and rowels, whose slightest touch would make a horse  wince, and put him on his good behaviour.    Nor did the great slapping brown horse, Hercules, turn out less imposingly  than his master. Leather, though not the man to work himself, had a very  good idea of work, and right manfully he made the helpers at the Eclipse  livery and bait stables strap and groom his horses. Hercules was a fine  animal. It did not require a man to be a great judge of a horse to see  that. Even the ladies, though perhaps they would rather have had him a  white or a cream colour, could not but admire his nut-brown muzzle, his  glossy coat, his silky mane, and the elegant way in which he carried his  flowing tail. His step was delightful to look at--so free, so accurate, and  so easy. And that reminds us that we may as well be getting Mr. Sponge  up--a feat of no easy accomplishment. Few hack hunters are without their  little peculiarities. Some are runaways--some kick--some bite--some go tail  first on the road--some go tail first at their fences--some rush as if they  were going to eat them, others baulk them altogether--and few, very few,  give satisfaction. Those that do, generally retire from the public stud to  the private one. But to our particular quadruped, 'Hercules.'    Mr. Sponge was not without his misgivings that, regardless of being on his  preferment, the horse might exhibit more of his peculiarity than would  forward his master's interests, and, independently of the disagreeableness  of being kicked off at the cover side, not being always compensated for by  falling soft, Mr. Sponge thought, as the meet was not far off, and he did  not sport a cover hack, it would look quite as well to ride his horse  quietly on as go in a fly, provided always he could accomplish the  mount--the mount--like the man walking with his head under his arm--being  the first step to everything.    Accordingly, Mr. Leather had the"]]]
