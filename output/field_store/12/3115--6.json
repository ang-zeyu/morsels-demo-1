But he had brought the clergy  unwittingly into trouble. The law of _Praemunire_ forbade a man to  accept the office of papal legate in England, or the clergy to  recognise him. Wolsey had obtained a patent under the Great Seal to  exercise legatine authority, and for fifteen years no objection had  been taken. When he was indicted for the infringement of the law,  he refused to plead royal permission, fearing to incur yet greater  displeasure of the King. So judgment went by default. And now the  clergy were likewise impeached. They met in St. Paul's Chapter House,  and in their terror offered L100,000 fine, under the advice of the  Bishop. The King refused to accept this unless they recognised him  as \"supreme head of the Church.\" Three days' discussion of this  proposition followed, then, on the proposal of Archbishop Warham, they  agreed to the following:--\"of which Church and clergy we acknowledge  his Majesty to be the chief protector, the only supreme lord, and,  as far as the law of Christ will allow, the supreme head.\" Such a  compromise meant nothing, for it did not attempt to define what  the law of Christ on the subject was. But it was evident that the  Reformation had begun in earnest. Though nineteen Anabaptists were  condemned in St. Paul's to be burned, and on fourteen of them the  sentence was carried out, Paul's Cross echoed with renunciation of the  Pope's authority. The miraculous rood of Bexley, in Kent, having been  exposed as a fraud there, was brought up to Paul's Cross, February,  1538, and the mechanism having been shown to the indignant audience,  it was committed to the flames.    A more significant indication of the coming change was witnessed in  1541. In May of the previous year, King Henry issued a proclamation  that every parish in England should provide itself with a copy of the  English Bible by All-hallow-tide next, under a penalty of 40_s._ He  explains that the object is that \"the power, wisdom, and goodness of  God may be perceived hereby,\" but the people are not to expound it,  nor to read it while Mass is going on, but are to \"read it meekly,  humbly, and reverently for their instruction, edification, and  amendment.\" Accordingly, Bishop Bonner had six of these great Bibles  chained to pillars in different parts of St. Paul's, as well as an  \"advertisement\" fixed at the same places, \"admonishing all that came  thither to read that they should lay aside vain-glory, hypocrisy, and  all other corrupt affections, and bring with them discretion, good  intention, charity, reverence, and a quiet behaviour, for the  edification of their own souls; but not to draw multitudes about them,  nor to make exposition of what they read, nor to read aloud in time of  divine service, nor enter into disputes concerning it.\"    There was no mistake as to the eagerness of the people to take  advantage of the opportunity. They assembled in crowds to hear such as  could read, and even, so says Burnet, sent their children to school  that they might carry them with them and hear them read.    It is not to be wondered at that Bonner soon found that his  Advertisement was powerless to check what he dreaded. Not only did  expounders dwell upon such words as \"Drink ye all of it,\" but they  compared the clergy to the Scribes and Pharisees, and identified them  with the generation of vipers, and with priests of Baal. Accordingly,  he put forth a fresh advertisement, in which he said that \"diverse,  wilful, and unlearned persons, contrary to all good order and honest  behaviour, have read the Scriptures especially and chiefly at the time  of divine service in this right honourable Catholic church, yea, in  the time of the sermon and declaration of the Word of God, in such  sort as was both to the evil and lewd example of the rest of the  multitude, and also to the high dishonour of the Word of God, over and  beside the great disturbance and unquietness of the people repairing  hither for honest purposes.\" And he declares that if this friendly  admonition be not attended to he will have the Bibles removed, but  that he shall do so very unwillingly, seeing that he \"will be, by  God's grace, right glad that the Scripture and Word of God should be  well known.\"    There is a painful story in \"Foxe's Martyrs,\" that one John Porter was  thrown into Newgate by Bonner for thus \"expounding,\" and that he died  there of the ill-treatment he received.    In the short reign of Edward VI., great destruction was wrought in the  structure and ornamentation of St. Paul's, and no thanks are due to  the \"Protector\" that the mischief was not greater. There was no sign  for a month or two. Edward ascended the throne on January 28, 1547,  and just two months later the French king, Francis I., died. On that  occasion, Cranmer, attended by eight bishops, sang a Requiem Mass in  Latin at St. Paul's, and Gardiner preached a funeral sermon before the  Lord Mayor and Aldermen, eulogising this persecutor of the Reformed  Faith. But now came unmistakable signs of change. Ridley, then Master  of Pembroke College, Cambridge, soon to be Bishop of London, preached  a somewhat violent sermon at Paul's Cross against the adoration of  saints, the use of holy water, and the reverence done to pictures and  images. We may note that on the day of the King's Coronation, amid all  the splendid pageantry and decorations, a cable was fastened to the  top of St. Paul's steeple, the other end attached to an anchor by the  Deanery door, and a sailor descended \"swift as an arrow from the bow.\"    It was in September following that the order from the Council  commanded the destruction of images in churches and the discontinuance  of all processions. The Bishop, Bonner, protested against the  alterations and was sent to the Fleet for contumacy, made submission,  and was released after eight days, during which the alterations were  made. The images were all pulled down, as were the rood, the crucifix,  and its attendants, St. Mary and St. John.    The \"Grey Friars Chronicle\"[1] (published by the Camden Society),  describes all this, and takes care to note that two of the men engaged  in the sacrilegious work were killed. The almsboxes shared the general  confiscation, and doubtless not only the services of the church, but  the poor who came for food, suffered thereby.    Protector Somerset had wide ideas. He aspired to build himself a  magnificent palace and to attach a park to it along the banks of the  Thames. The palace was on the site of the present Somerset House; the  park was to extend from it to St. Paul's. The cloister and chapel in  Pardon Churchyard were destroyed, and five hundred tons of bones were  carted away to Finsbury Fields (it is said there were more than a  thousand cartloads) and piled up into a mound, which got the name of  the \"Bone Hill,\" and this has come in our day to \"Bunhill.\" On this  hill three windmills were erected. The mound has long since been  trodden down, and the windmills are gone, but the name \"Windmill  Street\" remains. The chapter house and the small cloister round it, of  which we have already spoken, were also destroyed, and the materials  were used for the new Somerset House. Within the last few years the  bases of parts of this cloister have been uncovered under the skilful  supervision of Mr. Penrose, and may be seen on the south side of the  present cathedral.    As our subject is only the cathedral itself, we pass by the  controversies and changes in creed and practice which the reign of  Edward VI. witnessed. The Protector Somerset fell the victim of his  own inordinate covetousness, and died on the scaffold, January 22nd,  1552, to the great satisfaction of the \"Grey Friar\" chronicler. But  the Reformation went on; Bonner was imprisoned all through the reign,  Ridley was made Bishop of London (1550), and the sacrament was  administered according to the Reformed use. Rood-loft, altars,  crucifixes, images, all disappeared. The Dean, William May, gave  orders for the removal of the organ, but they were not carried out. It  pealed out the _Te Deum_ on the accession of Mary, July 6th, 1553. The  nation certainly rejoiced at this change. Not merely the rapacity of  the ruling powers at court had alienated public sympathy, but the  people at large at this time resented the loss of their ancient  worship, and had not as yet learned the greater spirituality and  reality of the Reformed service. We may note that in the exuberance of  popular delight in London whilst the cathedral bells were ringing, a  Dutchman went to the very top of the lofty steeple, waved a flag, and  kindled a blaze of torches.    But a fierce contest was inevitable. Paul's Cross for a little while  gave forth most conflicting views. Before the year was out the mass  was re-established in St. Paul's. On St. Catharine's Day there were  splendid processions and stately ceremonial, with special thought of  the Queen's mother, Catharine of Aragon. In a word, it was in St.  Paul's Cathedral that the recovery of Roman Catholicism was specially  manifested in England. William May was deprived of the Deanery, he  being a hearty supporter of the Reformed doctrines, and Feckenham  succeeded him, but in 1556 was made Abbot of Westminster. He was so  holy and kindly a man that he won great respect, though he was an  uncompromising Papist. He is said to have so exerted himself with  Queen Mary to procure the liberation of her sister Elizabeth as to  offend the Queen, and it is further said (Fuller) that Elizabeth  on her accession sent for him and offered him the Archbishopric of  Canterbury if he would conform to the Reformed Faith. He refused, and  was deprived, and went into retirement, and at St. Paul's May was  restored to the Deanery.    At the time of his deprivation, as I have said, St. Paul's at once  furnished proof of the restoration of the Roman faith.

[Illustration: THE KIRTLAND TEMPLE.]    During the meetings many glorious blessings were received. Angels were seen  by many of the Saints, Brigham Young spoke in tongues, others prophesied,  and many saw glorious visions. At the evening meeting George A. Smith arose  and prophesied, when a noise was heard like the sound of a mighty wind  which filled the temple. All the people arose at once and the Prophet  Joseph told the Saints that the temple was filled with angels, as he could  see them. The people living near the temple, seeing a bright light resting  on the building and hearing a strange sound within, came rushing up to see  what was the matter.    Nearly every day there were meetings held in the temple. The next Sunday  after the dedication, Joseph and Oliver were praying in the sacred house  when the Lord Jesus Christ appeared unto them. He stood on the breastwork  of the pulpit, and Joseph describes Him as a most glorious personage. Jesus  told them that He had accepted the temple and promised them great blessings  if they would continue to keep his commandments.    After this vision had closed, Moses, Elias, and Elijah appeared unto them  and each of them gave to Joseph and Oliver many blessings concerning the  gospel.    You would think that after all these blessings from the Lord the Saints  would never turn away from the truth; but sad to say this was not the case.  During the years 1837 and 1838 many of the brethren in Kirtland began to  buy and sell land and set up stores and banks for the purpose of making  money. Now, there would have been nothing wrong in all this if they had  done all their business honestly; but the trouble was that many wanted to  get rich so fast that oftimes they would cheat each other. This of course  was inspired by the evil one, who did his best to stop the progress of the  Church. It was a very hard trial for Joseph and those of his brethren who  stood by him to see so many leading men fall away into wickedness.    Again, you may also wonder how men who have been in the company of the  Prophet and who have seen angels and heavenly visions can deny the faith,  but the fact is they sometimes do. The whole secret is this:    No matter how much a person has seen or how much he knows, if he sins and  does not repent, the Spirit of God will leave him, and he will be in the  dark. It then becomes an easy matter for him to fall away from the Church.    During the two years named above, four of the Twelve Apostles and many of  the leading men apostatized; and then, not satisfied with so doing, they  began to join the mobs who persecuted Joseph and the Saints. This led the  Church leaders to remove to Missouri, and soon after nearly all the Saints  followed them to the land of Zion.    Topics.--1. The calling of the Twelve Apostles. 2.

In the year 1837, when the evil one was trying with all his might to  overthrow the Church both at Kirtland and in Missouri, the Lord told Joseph  that the time had come for \"something new\" to be done. This was to send  missionaries to England and open the gospel door to that people.    Elder Heber C. Kimball was chosen to take the lead of this mission, and  with him went Orson Hyde, Willard Richards, Joseph Fielding, John Goodson,  Isaac Russell, and John Snider.    This was the first mission to any foreign country, and in those days of  slow travel, a trip to Europe was no small matter. The brethren set out on  their journey without purse or scrip, but the Lord opened up their way, and  at last they landed in Liverpool, England, July 20, 1837.    They were in a strange country, had no money, no friends.    [Illustration: PRESIDENT HEBER C. KIMBALL]    \"Go to Preston,\" said the Spirit of the Lord to them. Preston is a city  thirty miles from Liverpool, and there they went. Joseph Fielding had a  brother living in the city, who was a preacher, and on his invitation the  missionaries held their first meeting in his chapel. This was the first  Sunday after their arrival. The people listened eagerly to what the elders  said, for it seems that a great many honest souls had been waiting for just  such a message.    After the third meeting, the Rev. Mr. Fielding would not let the elders use  his church, as he was afraid they would take away his congregation. From  that time he opposed the missionaries, and was soon joined in this by other  preachers.    However, the people had received a taste of the gospel and they wanted  more, so meetings were held in private houses. On the eighth day after the  arrival of the elders in England, nine persons were baptized into the  Church by Elder Kimball.    Thus was the door opened, and the gospel soon spread in a wonderful manner.  The elders now separated and went to different towns, preaching, baptizing,  and organizing branches of the Church. Great crowds came out to hear them,  especially in and around the city of Preston. It was a most glorious time  and full of interesting events which this little book cannot tell you  about; but here is a sample:    One day Elder Kimball told some of the brethren that he thought of going to  a place called Chatburn, to hold meetings. He was told that it would do no  good, as it was a very wicked place, and the people there would have  nothing to do with preachers. Elder Kimball went, however, and large crowds  came out to hear him. While teaching the people the need of repenting of  their evil doings and being baptized for the remission of their sins,  Brother Kimball felt someone pulling at his coat:    \"Please sir, will you baptize me?\" asked one.    \"And me, and me!\" exclaimed a dozen voices.    So Elder Kimball went down into the water and baptized twenty-five persons.  As the elders were walking out of the village, the young folks of the place  ran to meet them, the older people stood in their doors to greet and bless  them, while the children ran ahead, hand in hand, singing their songs of  gladness.    At a conference held in Preston, April 8, 1838, there were reports from  twenty-six branches of the Church. The total number of souls in the Church  was reported to be about two thousand; and all this was done in the short  space of eight months.    The next day Elders Kimball, Hyde, and Russell left for home, leaving  Willard Richards to preside over the mission. Many were the sad partings  these brethren had with the Saints, for a great love grows up between the  Saints in the world and the elders who have brought them the gospel.    January 11, 1840, Elders John Taylor and Wilford Woodruff landed in  England. Brother Woodruff was led by the Spirit to go into a part of  England called Herefordshire. Here he found a religious body of people  called United Brethren. They had withdrawn from the Church of England, and  were now praying that the Lord would send them more light. These people  heard Elder Woodruff gladly, and with joy they received the gospel. Within  one month he baptized all their preachers, forty-five in number, and one  hundred and sixty of their members. In eight months time Elder Woodruff  brought eighteen hundred souls into the Church, including all the six  hundred United Brethren, save one.    At one time just as Elder Woodruff was about to begin a meeting, a  constable came to arrest him for preaching. The officer was asked to take a  seat, and was told that after the meeting Elder Woodruff would be at his  service. The constable was very much interested in the sermon. At the close  of the meeting seven persons asked for baptism, and the constable was one  of the number. After this, two clerks of the Church of England were sent as  spies to find out what the Mormon elders preached. Both of these men  believed and joined the Church.    Now came others of the Apostles to England to roll on the work. Brigham  Young, Heber C. Kimball, Parley P. Pratt, Orson Pratt, and George A. Smith  arrived on April 6, 1840. At a conference held in Preston on the 14th,  Willard Richards was ordained an Apostle, so that now there were eight of  the Twelve together. At this meeting it was decided to print a paper to be  called _The Latter-day Saints' Millennial Star_. This paper has been  published from that day to this, it being the oldest publication in the  Church.    The Church now grew rapidly. Branches were organized in Scotland, Ireland,  Wales, and in many of the large cities in England. At a conference held in  the city of Manchester, April 6, 1841, it was found that there were about  six thousand members of the Church in Great Britain. Eight hundred Saints  had emigrated to America during the year. At this conference, nine of the  Twelve were present, Orson Hyde having arrived on his way to Palestine,  where he was going to dedicate that land for the gathering of the Jews.    Shortly after this conference, the apostles left England to return home,  leaving Parley P. Pratt in charge of the mission. From that time the work  has continued in Great Britain, and many honest souls have come to the  knowledge of the gospel.    Topics.--1. The first mission to England. 2.
