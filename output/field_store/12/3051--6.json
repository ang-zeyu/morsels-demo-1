It was impossible after this to  hesitate concerning the choice of a situation; and orders were  accordingly issued for the removal of the whole fleet to Port Jackson.    That Botany Bay should have appeared to Captain Cook in a more  advantageous light than to Governor Phillip, is not by any means  extraordinary. Their objects were very different; the one required only  shelter and refreshment for a small vessel, and during but a short time:  the other had great numbers to provide for, and was necessitated to find  a place wherein ships of very considerable burthen might approach the  shore with ease, and lie at all times in perfect security. The appearance  of the place is picturesque and pleasing, and the ample harvest it  afforded, of botanical acquisitions, made it interesting to the  philosophical gentlemen engaged in that expedition; but something more  essential than beauty of appearance, and more necessary than  philosophical riches, must be sought in a place where the permanent  residence of multitudes is to be established.      Chapter VII.    January 1788    Removal from Botany Bay--Arrival of two French ships--Account of  them--Preparations for encampment--Difficulties--Scurvy breaks out--Account  of the red and yellow gum trees.    24 January 1788    Preparations for a general removal were now made with all convenient  expedition: but on the morning of the 24th the greatest astonishment was  spread throughout the fleet by the appearance of two ships, under French  colours. In this remote region visitors from Europe were very little  expected, and their arrival, while the cause of it remained unknown,  produced in some minds a temporary apprehension, accompanied by a  multiplicity of conjectures, many of them sufficiently ridiculous.  Governor Phillip was the first to recollect that two ships had been sent  out some time before from France for the purpose of discovery, and  rightly concluded these to be the same. But as the opposition of the  wind, and a strong current prevented them at present from working into  the harbour, and even drove them out of sight again to the south, he did  not think proper to delay his departure for the sake of making further  enquiry.    25 January 1788    On the 25th of January therefore, seven days after the arrival of the  Supply, Governor Phillip quitted Botany Bay in the same ship, and sailed  to Port Jackson. The rest of the fleet, under convoy of the Sirius, was  ordered to follow, as soon as the abatement of the wind, which then blew  a strong gale, should facilitate its working out of the Bay. The Supply  was scarcely out of sight when the French ships again appeared off the  mouth of the harbour, and a boat was immediately sent to them, with  offers of every kind of information and assistance their situation could  require. It was now learnt that these were, as the Governor had supposed,  the Boussole and the Astrolabe, on a voyage of discovery, under the  conduct of Monsieur La Perouse.    26 January 1788    On the 26th, the transports and store ships, attended by the Sirius,  finally evacuated Botany Bay; and in a very short time they were all  assembled in Sydney Cove, the place now destined for their port, and for  the reception of the new settlement. The French ships had come to anchor  in Botany Bay just before the departure of the Sirius; and during the  intercourse which then took place, M. la Perouse had expressed a strong  desire of having some letters conveyed to Europe. Governor Phillip was no  sooner informed of this, than he dispatched an officer to him with full  information of the time when it was probable our ships would sail, and  with assurances that his letters should be punctually transmitted. By  this officer the following intelligence was brought back concerning the  voyage of the Astrolabe and Boussole.    These vessels had sailed from France in June 1785. They had touched at  the Isle of Santa Catharina on the coast of Brasil, from thence had gone  by the extremity of South America into the Pacific Ocean, where they had  run along by the coasts of Chili and California. They had afterwards  visited Easter Island, Nootka Sound, Cook's River, Kamschatka, Manilla,  the Isles des Navigateurs, Sandwich and the Friendly Islands. M. la  Perouse had also anchored off Norfolk Island, but could not land, on  account of the surf. In this long voyage he had not lost any of his  people by sickness; but two boats crews had unfortunately perished in a  surf on the north-west coast of America; and at Masuna, one of the Isles  des Navigateurs, M. L'Angle, Captain of the Astrolabe, had met with a  fate still more unfortunate. That officer had gone ashore with two long  boats for the purpose of filling some water casks. His party amounted to  forty men, and the natives, from whom the French had received abundance  of refreshments, and with whom they had been uniformly on the best terms,  did not on their landing show any signs of a change of disposition.  Malice unprovoked, and treachery without a motive, seem inconsistent even  with the manners of savages; the French officers therefore, confiding in  this unbroken state of amity, had suffered their boats to lie aground.  But whether it were that the friendly behaviour of the natives had  proceeded only from fear, or that some unknown offence had been given,  they seized the moment when the men were busied in getting out the boats,  to make an attack equally furious and unexpected. The assault was made  with stones, of which prodigious numbers were thrown with extraordinary  force and accuracy of direction. To this treachery M. L'Angle fell a  sacrifice, and with him twelve of his party, officers and men, the  long-boats were destroyed, and the remainder of those who had gone ashore  escaped with difficulty in their small boats. The ships in the mean time  were under sail, and having passed a point of land that intercepted the  view, knew nothing of this melancholy and unaccountable affray till the  boats returned. This fatal result from too implicit a confidence, may,  perhaps very properly, increase the caution of Europeans in their  commerce with savages, but ought not to excite suspicion. The resentments  of such people are sudden and sanguinary, and, where the intercourse of  language is wanting, may easily be awakened by misapprehension: but it  seems possible to treat them with sufficient marks of confidence, without  abandoning the guards of prudence. Offence is often given by the men,  while the officers are most studious to preserve harmony, and against the  transports of rage which arise on such occasions, it is always necessary  to be prepared. Perhaps, also, a degree of awe should always be kept up,  even to preserve their friendship. It has been uniformly remarked by our  people, that defenceless stragglers are generally ill-treated by the  natives of New South Wales, while towards parties armed and on their  guard, they behave in the most amicable manner.    The debarkation was now made at Sydney Cove, and the work of clearing the  ground for the encampment, as well as for the storehouses and other  buildings, was begun without loss of time. But the labour which attended  this necessary operation was greater than can easily be imagined by those  who were not spectators of it. The coast, as well as the neighbouring  country in general, is covered with wood; and though in this spot the  trees stood more apart, and were less incumbered with underwood than in  many other places, yet their magnitude was such as to render not only the  felling, but the removal of them afterwards, a task of no small  difficulty. By the habitual indolence of the convicts, and the want of  proper overseers to keep them to their duty, their labour was rendered  less efficient than it might have been.    26 January 1788    In the evening of the 26th the colours were displayed on shore,  and the Governor, with several of his principal officers and others,  assembled round the flag-staff, drank the king's health, and success  to the settlement, with all that display of form which on such occasions  is esteemed propitious, because it enlivens the spirits, and fills  the imagination with pleasing presages. From this time to the end  of the first week in February all was hurry and exertion. They who  gave orders and they who received them were equally occupied; nor  is it easy to conceive a busier scene than this part of the coast  exhibited during the continuance of these first efforts towards  establishment. The plan of the encampment was quickly formed, and places  were marked out for every different purpose, so as to introduce, as much  as possible, strict order and regularity. The materials and frame work to  construct a slight temporary habitation for the Governor, had been  brought out from England ready formed: these were landed and put together  with as much expedition as the circumstances would allow. Hospital tents  were also without delay erected, for which there was soon but too much  occasion. In the passage from the Cape there had been but little  sickness, nor had many died even among the convicts; but soon after  landing, a dysentery prevailed, which in several instances proved fatal,  and the scurvy began to rage with a virulence which kept the hospital  tents generally supplied with patients. For those afflicted with this  disorder, the advantage of fish or other fresh provisions could but  rarely be procured; nor were esculent vegetables often obtained in  sufficient plenty to produce any material alleviation of the complaint.  In the dysentery, the red gum of the tree which principally abounds on  this coast, was found a very powerful remedy. The yellow gum has been  discovered to possess the same property, but in an inferior degree.    The tree which yields the former kind of gum"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15106"],[0,"Origin of the Anglo-Boer War Revealed (2nd ed.) (#11)"],[1,"contrary were always  indignantly and stoutly repelled. The Afrikaner Bond was averred to  include nothing to clash with loyal sentiments, no severance from  England, but, on the contrary, that its principal objects were to  strengthen the lines of amity and joint solidarity in view of a general  federation of South Africa upon Imperial bases. In support of such  sentiments one of the first acts of the Bond party when recently come  into power was a vote of L30,000 per year towards British naval outlays,  and in grateful recognition of naval protection; it was at the same time  mooted, in fact almost pledged, that the Transvaal would similarly offer  L12,000 as well.    The sequel has proven these to be Athenian gifts, for no sooner had the  Republican commandoes invaded the Cape Colonies in November last than  those identical men enthusiastically welcomed the Queen's enemies as  their friends and deliverers from hateful English dominion. There they  stood--self-avowed and unmasked traitors. Members of the Legislative  Assembly met those Boer invaders with addresses and speeches, assuring  them of their own and of every other true Afrikaner's aid and fidelity  in their common cause. \"The star of liberty,\" they said, \"had arisen at  last--it had been the nation's desire and prayers during the past  fifteen years.\" \"He could thank God with tears of joy for having granted  those prayers.\" Such were the words of Mr. van der Walt, M.L.A., uttered  at Colesberg. Mr. de Wet, M.L.A., Mr. van den Heever, M.L.A., and other  colonial notables were spokesmen in similar terms of enthusiasm on other  occasions as the invasion advanced. All this is sadly notorious, but  still it seems a hard task to convince people who prefer to remain blind  or only see a presumptuous adversary in any one who seeks to enlighten  them upon this glaring and premeditated treachery.    October and November were months of unrestrained exultation to the Boer  party, to judge from letters and articles which appeared in the  _Standard and Diggers' News_, Johannesburg, dated 22nd November, 1899,  and in the Pretoria _Volksstem_, dated 20th November, 1899.[10] There  one sees the mask off, in language of defiant insult and of scurrilous  mendacity against all that is English, avowing that the present  Anglo-Boer War has been the outcome of preparations during the past  thirty years. That letter is not all suitable reading for the tender  sex, but should serve as evidence to the still unconvinced sceptic that  the Boers are fighting for something more than their mere independence  and liberty, viz., for conquest and the domination of Afrikanerdom. His  Excellency Dr. Leyds may deny all those too previous intentions with  his placid effrontery of assumed innocent calm. He may denounce Mr.  Chamberlain, Rhodes, Jameson, and even the Prince of Wales, and he may  use the old device of posing as innocent by accusing others. The  detected robber, however, does not always escape with his booty by  running off himself, whilst shouting \"Stop, thief!\"    Something refreshingly analogous to such attempts of screening and  exculpation has been extemporized in Cape journals of late. There, in an  ingeniously pretended dissertation, it is invented how ill founded the  aspersions are against Mr. Premier Schreiner, and that the acts, upon  which he was so wrongly suspected as an amphibious helmsman, are really  attributable to another person--by the way, to one at a safe distance,  viz., to Mr. F.W. Reitz, the Transvaal State Secretary; whilst this  gentleman again, when lecturing at Johannesburg in July last, naively  deplored the confusion of people's ideas who see anything wrong in the  Afrikaner Bond, adding: \"Lord, forgive them, for they know not what they  do or talk about.\"    \"The peace of South Africa is only possible under Boer supremacy,\" is  the Bond shibboleth. The end justifies the means, even to sedition, to a  war of conquest and the wholesale plunder of investors.    Many of the younger Boers in the Cape Colony and Natal had shown a  singular ardour in joining the several volunteer corps. They were  equipped with uniforms and best weapons, were drilled into efficiency,  received pay, and all went on well until the oath of allegiance was to  be tendered. This they refused, preferring to resign and to provide arms  from other sources--Mauser rifles by preference. This happened some  considerable time before the outbreak of the war.      Boer Arguments Denying Uitlanders' Complaints    Many plausible arguments are proffered to prove that Uitlanders'  grievances and irritations are purely fictitious, but few, I venture to  say, will bear examination. Taxation, for example, is stoutly averred to  fall alike upon burgher and Uitlander, but a glance at the long rubric  of articles specially taxed will show that the selection is contrived to  hit the latter and to spare, or even to protect and benefit, the burgher  section.    The gold industry is not charged with a royalty as is customary in other  gold-producing countries, but with 5 per cent. only upon the net  profits; but here an intolerant and corrupt domination proves much more  prejudicial than a heavy royalty would be.    Proper representation would be the remedy and afford contentment, even  with higher taxation, but that is refused upon Bond principles.    The Anglo-Boer War is attributed to base motives on the part of the  British Government, operating in collusion with capitalism--to England's  passion for annexation, her rapacious greed for the Transvaal gold, her  inordinate ambition to universal commercial supremacy, etc. What a  confusion of assertions and of self-refuting contradictions!    Would England really acquire the Transvaal gold by the annexation of  that State, seeing that its mines are already capitalized and as good as  expropriated in favour of the host of shareholders, some of whom are  English, but the greater portion German, French, and of other nations?    What advantage would accrue to shareholders? Would England, in case of  forcible annexation, not be under the necessity of incurring a heavy  charge in the increase of her South African garrisons, and so be  justified in levying a considerable royalty upon the output, which would  materially reduce the dividends? What advantage would arise to England  by substituting an unproductive and costly war in South Africa for  conditions of peace and prosperity, which alone can yield her commerce  profit? England can only derive profit from wars waged between other  peoples. And as to the incentive of commercial supremacy, England, while  possessing that to a large extent already, freely and voluntarily allows  all comers from other nationalities to share the benefits with her by  her principle of free trade.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 10: Extract from Pretoria _Volksstem_, 20th November, 1899,  from a long letter averred to have appeared in the London _Times_, dated  12th October, 1899, said to have been signed by a well-known Cape Boer,  then in England:--    \"We have desired delay, and we have had it, and we are now practically  masters of South Africa from the Zambesi to the Cape. All the Afrikaners  in the Cape Colony have been working for years past for this end.    \"For thirty years the Cape Dutch have been waiting their chance, and now  their day has come; they will throw off their mask and their yoke at the  same instant, and 200,000 Dutch heroes will trample you tinder foot. We  can afford to tell you the truth now, and in this letter you have got  it.\"]          PORTUGUESE TERRITORY--TRANSVAAL LOW VELDT--MALARIA--HORSE SICKNESS      Between the north-eastern borders of the Transvaal and the coast lies  the Portuguese colony Mozambique. Its frontier railway station, Ressario  Garcia, is near that of the Transvaal, viz., Komati poort, which is 53  miles from Delagoa Bay. A low-lying country extends from the coast about  100 to 200 miles inland, and is tropical. Except some elevated spots,  the whole of it is almost uninhabitable in summer by whites on account  of malaria. During some specially bad seasons natives even succumb to  that malady. The only comparatively safe months are from June to  November. Marshy localities, and wherever there is shaded rank  vegetation in low-lying parts, are dangerous all the year round; in such  places the water is deadly at all times unless first boiled.    This malarial poison is distinct from that which produces yellow fever  in America, and is so far unlike it as it is not contagious. The theory  is that the poison is produced below the surface by decaying vegetable  matter in low and dank parts during the more inactive but still warm and  sunny winter season and during the hot months preceding the summer  rainfall. Upon the first rains the malarial poison escapes through the  then softened crust in the shape of vapoury miasms. This happens during  the night, after the surface of the earth has been cooled off. Those  miasms are dissipated or neutralised by the action of the sun. The dewy  grass retains the poison until it is thoroughly dried to the root. All  surface water is liable to that poisonous impregnation. Malarial  manifestations occur all over South Africa, but in progressive degrees  of virulence with the advance to warmer latitudes, and with the descent  from the high table-lands to the coast levels. On the Transvaal high  veldt, for example, a mild form is developed which, in midsummer, to a  small extent, affects and kills sheep. It is called _blaauwtong_, and  does not affect horses. Descending further, this danger to sheep  increases and begins earlier. Below 5,000 feet altitude in the Transvaal  the summer season is dangerous to sheep, and horses and mules are  subject to horse sickness; whilst lower still the same malaria attains  sufficient virulence to attack human beings, and becomes very deadly  upon levels nearing the coast.
