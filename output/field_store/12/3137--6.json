Deny not, moreover, Thy servants the sweet fragrance of the breath which  hath been wafted through Thy love.    Thou seest, O Thou Who art my All-Glorious Beloved, the restless waves  that surge within the ocean of my heart, in my love and yearning towards  Thee. I implore Thee, by the signs of Thy majesty and the evidences of Thy  sovereignty, to subdue Thy servants by this Name Which Thou hast made to  be the King of all names in the kingdom of Thy creation. Potent art Thou  to rule as Thou pleasest. No God is there but Thee, the All-Glorious, the  All-Bountiful.    Do Thou ordain, moreover, for every one who hath turned towards Thee what  will make him steadfast in Thy Cause, in such wise that neither the vain  imaginations of the infidels among Thy creatures, nor the idle talk of the  froward amidst Thy servants will have the power to shut him out from Thee.  Thou, verily, art the Help in Peril, the Almighty, the Most Powerful.            XLVIII: \"UNTO THEE BE PRAISE, O LORD MY GOD! I BESEECH...\"      Unto Thee be praise, O Lord my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name  Who hath been shut up in the prison-town of Akka, and Who--as Thou  beholdest, O my God--hath fallen into the hands of His enemies, and is  threatened by the swords of the wicked doers, to make me steadfast in His  Cause, and to direct mine eyes continually towards His court, in such wise  that nothing whatsoever will have the power to turn me back from Him.    I testify, O my Lord, that He hath surrendered His life in Thy path, and  hath wished for Himself nothing but tribulation in the love He beareth to  Thee. He hath endured all manner of vexations that He may manifest Thy  sovereignty unto Thy servants, and exalt Thy word amidst Thy creatures. As  the adversities deepened, and the troubles sent down by Thee compassed Him  on every side, He became so impassioned by His thought of Thee, that the  hosts of all them that had disbelieved in Thee and repudiated Thy signs  ceased to affright Him.    I implore Thee, O my Lord, by Him and by whatsoever pertaineth unto Him,  to set my affections upon Him even as He hath set His own affections upon  Thyself. I testify that His love is Thy love, and His self Thy self, and  His beauty Thy beauty, and His Cause Thy Cause.    Deny me not, O my Lord, what is with Thee, and suffer me not to be  forgetful of what Thou didst desire in Thy days. Thou art, verily, the  Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, the All-Wise.            XLIX: \"LAUDED BE THY NAME, O LORD MY GOD! I ENTREAT...\"      Lauded be Thy name, O Lord my God! I entreat Thee by Thy Name through  which the Hour hath struck, and the Resurrection came to pass, and fear  and trembling seized all that are in heaven and all that are on earth, to  rain down, out of the heaven of Thy mercy and the clouds of Thy tender  compassion, what will gladden the hearts of Thy servants, who have turned  towards Thee and helped Thy Cause.    Keep safe Thy servants and Thy handmaidens, O my Lord, from the darts of  idle fancy and vain imaginings, and give them from the hands of Thy grace  a draught of the soft-flowing waters of Thy knowledge.    Thou, truly, art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Ever-Forgiving, the  Most Generous.            L: \"GLORY BE TO THEE, O MY GOD! THOU HEAREST THINE...\"      Glory be to Thee, O my God! Thou hearest Thine ardent lovers lamenting in  their separation from Thee, and such as have recognized Thee wailing  because of their remoteness from Thy presence. Open Thou outwardly to  their faces, O my Lord, the gates of Thy grace, that they may enter them  by Thy leave and in conformity with Thy will, and may stand before the  throne of Thy majesty, and catch the accents of Thy voice, and be  illumined with the splendors of the light of Thy face.    Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. None can withstand the power of  Thy sovereign might. From everlasting Thou wert alone, with none to equal  Thee, and wilt unto everlasting remain far above all thought and every  description of Thee. Have mercy, then, upon Thy servants by Thy grace and  bounty, and suffer them not to be kept back from the shores of the ocean  of Thy nearness. If Thou abandonest them, who is there to befriend them;  and if Thou puttest them far from Thee, who is he that can favor them?  They have none other Lord beside Thee, none to adore except Thyself. Deal  Thou generously with them by Thy bountiful grace.    Thou, in truth, art the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Compassionate.            LI: \"THOU DOST WITNESS, O MY GOD, HOW HE WHO IS...\"      Thou dost witness, O my God, how He Who is Thy splendor calleth Thee to  remembrance, notwithstanding the manifold troubles that have touched Him,  troubles which none except Thee can number. Thou beholdest how, in His  prison-house, He recounteth Thy wondrous praises with which Thou didst  inspire Him. Such is His fervor that His enemies are powerless to deter  Him from mentioning Thee, O Thou Who art the Possessor of all names!    Praised be Thou that Thou hast so strengthened Him with Thy strength, and  endowed Him by Thine almighty power with such potency, that aught save  Thee is in His estimation but a handful of dust. The lights of unfading  splendor have so enveloped Him that all else but Thee is in His eyes but a  shadow.    And when Thine irresistible summons reached me, I arose, fortified by Thy  strength, and called all that are in Thy heaven and all that are on Thy  earth to turn in the direction of Thy favors and the horizon of Thy  bounties. Some caviled at me, and determined to hurt me and slay me.  Others drank to the full of the wine of Thy grace, and hastened towards  the habitation of Thy throne.    I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the Creator of earth and heaven and the  Source of all things, to attract Thy servants through the fragrances of  the Robe of Thine Inspiration and Thy Revelation, and to help them attain  the Tabernacle of Thy behest and power. From eternity Thou wert by Thy  transcendent might supreme over all things, and Thou wilt be exalted unto  eternity in Thy Godhead and surpassing sovereignty.    Let Thy mercy, then, be upon Thy servants and Thy creatures. Thou art, in  truth, the Almighty, the Inaccessible, the All-Glorious, the  Unconditioned.            LII: \"LAUDED BE THY NAME, O MY GOD! I ENTREAT THEE...\"      Lauded be Thy name, O my God! I entreat Thee by the fragrances of the  Raiment of Thy grace which at Thy bidding and in conformity with Thy  desire were diffused throughout the entire creation, and by the Day-Star  of Thy will that hath shone brightly, through the power of Thy might and  of Thy sovereignty, above the horizon of Thy mercy, to blot out from my  heart all idle fancies and vain imaginings, that with all my affections I  may turn unto Thee, O Thou Lord of all mankind!    I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant, O my God! I have laid hold on  the handle of Thy grace, and clung to the cord of Thy tender mercy. Ordain  for me the good things that are with Thee, and nourish me from the Table  Thou didst send down out of the clouds of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy  favor.    Thou, in very truth, art the Lord of the worlds, and the God of all that  are in heaven and all that are on earth.            LIII: \"I KNOW NOT, O MY GOD, WHAT THE FIRE IS WHICH...\"      I know not, O my God, what the Fire is which Thou didst kindle in Thy  land. Earth can never cloud its splendor, nor water quench its flame. All  the peoples of the world are powerless to resist its force. Great is the  blessedness of him that hath drawn nigh unto it, and heard its roaring.    Some, O my God, Thou didst, through Thy strengthening grace, enable to  approach it, while others Thou didst keep back by reason of what their  hands have wrought in Thy days. Whoso hath hasted towards it and attained  unto it hath, in his eagerness to gaze on Thy beauty, yielded his life in  Thy path, and ascended unto Thee, wholly detached from aught else except  Thyself.    I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by this Fire which blazeth and rageth in the  world of creation, to rend asunder the veils that have hindered me from  appearing before the throne of Thy majesty, and from standing at the door  of Thy gate. Do Thou ordain for me, O my Lord, every good thing Thou didst  send down in Thy Book, and suffer me not to be far removed from the  shelter of Thy mercy.    Powerful art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. Thou art, verily, the  All-Powerful, the Most Generous.            LIV: \"LAUDED BE THY NAME, O MY GOD! AID THOU BY...\"      Lauded be Thy name, O my God! Aid Thou by Thy strengthening grace Thy  servants and Thy handmaidens to recount Thy virtues and to be steadfast in  their love towards Thee. How many the leaves which the tempests of trials  have caused to fall, and how many, too, are those which, clinging  tenaciously to the tree of Thy Cause, have remained unshaken by the tests  that have assailed them, O Thou Who art our Lord, the Most Merciful!    I render Thee thanks that Thou hast made known unto me such servants as  have utterly abolished, by the power of Thy might and of Thy sovereignty,  the idols of their corrupt desires, and were not kept back by the things  which are possessed by Thy creatures from turning in the direction of Thy  grace. These have so vehemently rent the veils asunder that the dwellers  of the cities of self have wept, and fear and trembling seized the people  of envy and wickedness who, adorning their heads and their bodies with the  emblems of knowledge, have proudly rejected Thee and turned away from Thy  beauty.    I implore Thee, O my Lord, by Thy surpassing majesty and Thine Ancient  Name, to enable Thy loved ones to assist Thee. Direct, then, continually  their faces towards Thy face, and write down for them what will cause all  hearts to exult and all eyes to be gladdened.   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16985"],[0,"The Proclamation of Bahá'u'lláh (#11)"],[1," all eyes have stared up with terror, and the hearts of all  who are in the heavens and on the earth have trembled, except them whom  the breath of the verses of God hath quickened, and who have detached  themselves from all things.    This is the Day whereon the earth shall tell out her tidings. The workers  of iniquity are her burdens, could ye but perceive it. The moon of idle  fancy hath been cleft, and the heaven hath given out a palpable smoke. We  see the people laid low, awed with the dread of thy Lord, the Almighty,  the Most Powerful. The Crier hath cried out, and men have been torn away,  so great hath been the fury of His wrath. The people of the left hand sigh  and bemoan. The people of the right abide in noble habitations: they quaff  the Wine that is life indeed, from the hands of the All-Merciful, and are,  verily, the blissful.    The earth hath been shaken, and the mountains have passed away, and the  angels have appeared, rank on rank, before Us. Most of the people are  bewildered in their drunkenness and wear on their faces the evidences of  anger. Thus have We gathered together the workers of iniquity. We see them  rushing on towards their idol. Say: None shall be secure this Day from the  decree of God. This indeed is a grievous Day. We point out to them those  that led them astray. They see them, and yet recognize them not. Their  eyes are drunken; they are indeed a blind people. Their proofs are the  calumnies they uttered; condemned are their calumnies by God, the Help in  Peril, the Self-Subsisting. The Evil One hath stirred up mischief in their  hearts, and they are afflicted with a torment that none can avert. They  hasten to the wicked, bearing the register of the workers of iniquity.  Such are their doings.    Say: The heavens have been folded together, and the earth is held within  His grasp, and the corrupt doers have been held by their forelock, and  still they understand not. They drink of the tainted water, and know it  not. Say: The shout hath been raised, and the people have come forth from  their graves, and arising are gazing around them. Some have made haste to  attain the court of the God of Mercy, others have fallen down on their  faces in the fire of Hell, while still others are lost in bewilderment.  The verses of God have been revealed, and yet they have turned away from  them. His proof hath been manifested and yet they are unaware of it. And  when they behold the face of the All-Merciful, their own faces are  saddened, while they are disporting themselves. They hasten forward to  Hell Fire, and mistake it for light. Far from God be what they fondly  imagine! Say: Whether ye rejoice or whether ye burst for fury, the heavens  are cleft asunder, and God hath come down, invested with radiant  sovereignty. All created things are heard exclaiming: 'The Kingdom is  God's, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.'          \"O CONCOURSE of Persian divines! In My name ye have...\"      O CONCOURSE of Persian divines! In My name ye have seized the reins of  men, and occupy the seats of honour by reason of your relation to Me. When  I revealed Myself, however, ye turned aside, and committed what hath  caused the tears of such as have recognized Me to flow. Erelong will all  that ye possess perish, and your glory be turned into the most wretched  abasement, and ye shall behold the punishment for what ye have wrought, as  decreed by God, the Ordainer, the All-Wise.          \"O YE divines of the City! We came to you with the...\"      O YE divines of the City! We came to you with the truth, whilst ye were  heedless of it. Methinks ye are as dead, wrapt in the coverings of your  own selves. Ye sought not Our presence, when so to do would have been  better for you than all your doings.... Know ye, that had your leaders, to  whom ye owe allegiance, and on whom ye pride yourselves, and whom ye  mention by day and by night, and from whose traces ye seek guidance--had  they lived in these days, they would have circled around Me, and would not  have separated themselves from Me, whether at eventide or at morn. Ye,  however, did not turn your faces towards My face, for even less than a  moment, and waxed proud, and were careless of this Wronged One, Who hath  been so afflicted by men that they dealt with Him as they pleased. Ye  failed to inquire about My condition, nor did ye inform yourselves of the  things which befell Me. Thereby have ye withheld from yourselves the winds  of holiness, and the breezes of bounty, that blow from this luminous and  perspicuous Spot. Methinks ye have clung to outward things, and forgotten  the inner things, and say that which ye do not. Ye are lovers of names,  and appear to have given yourselves up to them. For this reason make ye  mention of the names of your leaders. And should any one like them, or  superior unto them, come unto you, ye would flee him. Through their names  ye have exalted yourselves, and have secured your positions, and live and  prosper. And were your leaders to reappear, ye would not renounce your  leadership, nor would ye turn in their direction, nor set your faces  towards them. We found you, as We found most men, worshipping names which  they mention during the days of their life, and with which they occupy  themselves. No sooner do the Bearers of these names appear, however, than  they repudiate them, and turn upon their heels.... Know ye that God will  not, in this day, accept your thoughts, nor your remembrance of Him, nor  your turning towards Him, nor your devotions, nor your vigilance, unless  ye be made new in the estimation of this Servant, could ye but perceive  it.          \"BECAUSE of you the Apostle (Muhammad) lamented,...\"      BECAUSE of you the Apostle (Muhammad) lamented, and the Chaste One  (Fatimihs) cried out, and the countries were laid waste, and darkness fell  upon all regions. O concourse of divines! Because of you the people were  abased, and the banner of Islam was hauled down, and its mighty throne  subverted. Every time a man of discernment hath sought to hold fast unto  that which would exalt Islam, you raised a clamour, and thereby was He  deterred from achieving His purpose, while the land remained fallen in  clear ruin.          \"OF all the peoples of the world, they that have suffered...\"      OF all the peoples of the world, they that have suffered the greatest loss  have been, and are still, the people of Persia. I swear by the Day Star of  Utterance which shineth upon the world in its meridian glory! The  lamentations of the pulpits, in that country, are being raised  continually. In the early days such lamentations were heard in the Land of  Ta (Tihran), for pulpits, erected for the purpose of remembering the True  One--exalted be His glory--have now, in Persia, become places wherefrom  blasphemies are uttered against Him Who is the Desire of the worlds.          \"IN this day the world is redolent with the fragrances of the...\"      IN this day the world is redolent with the fragrances of the robe of the  Revelation of the Ancient King ... and yet, they (divines) have gathered  together, and established themselves upon their seats, and have spoken  that which would put an animal to shame, how much more man himself! Were  they to become aware of one of their acts, and perceive the mischief it  hath wrought, they would, with their own hands, dispatch themselves to  their final abode.          \"O CONCOURSE of divines!... Lay aside that which ye...\"      O CONCOURSE of divines!... Lay aside that which ye possess, and hold your  peace, and give ear, then, unto that which the Tongue of Grandeur and  Majesty speaketh. How many the veiled handmaidens who turned unto Me, and  believed, and how numerous the wearers of the turban who were debarred  from Me, and followed in the footsteps of bygone generations!          \"O HIGH priests! Ears have been given you that they may...\"      O HIGH priests! Ears have been given you that they may hearken unto the  mystery of Him Who is the Self-Dependent, and eyes that they may behold  Him. Wherefore flee ye? The Incomparable Friend is manifest. He speaketh  that wherein lieth salvation. Were ye, O high priests, to discover the  perfume of the rose-garden of understanding, ye would seek none other but  Him, and would recognize, in His new vesture, the All-Wise and Peerless  One, and would turn your eyes from the world and all who seek it, and  would arise to help Him.          \"WHATSOEVER hath been announced in the Books hath...\"      WHATSOEVER hath been announced in the Books hath been revealed and made  clear. From every direction the signs have been manifested. The Omnipotent  One is calling, in this Day, and announcing the appearance of the Supreme  Heaven.          \"THIS is not the day whereon the high priests can command...\"      THIS is not the day whereon the high priests can command and exercise  their authority. In your Book it is stated that the high priests will, on  that Day, lead men far astray, and will prevent them from drawing nigh  unto Him. He indeed is a high priest who hath seen the light and hastened  unto the way leading to the Beloved.          \"O HIGH priests! The Hand of Omnipotence is stretched...\"      O HIGH priests! The Hand of Omnipotence is stretched forth from behind the  clouds; behold ye it with new eyes. The tokens of His majesty and  greatness are unveiled; gaze ye on them with pure eyes.... Say, O high  priests! Ye are held in reverence because of My Name, and yet ye flee Me!  Ye are the high priests of the Temple. Had ye been the high priests of the  Omnipotent One, ye would have been united with Him, and would have  recognized Him.... Say, O high priests! No man's acts shall be acceptable,  in this Day, unless he forsaketh mankind and all that men possess, and  setteth his face towards the Omnipotent One.
