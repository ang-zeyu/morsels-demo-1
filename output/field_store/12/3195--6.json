[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18187"],[0,"Hebrew Life and Times (#11)"],[1,"      SISERA AND DEBORAH    In this disorganized state they would have been an easy prey to any  strong enemy; and before long, an enemy came. In the fertile plain of  Esdraelon, which cuts across Palestine just north of the central  highland, there was a group of Canaanite towns which the Hebrews had  not as yet conquered. These were organized into a kingdom by a warrior  named Sisera, who at once began to reconquer those parts of the  country which now belonged to the Hebrews. It was a bitter time for  the tribes that were settled around the Plain of Esdraelon. Those  villages which were perched on the mountain sides held out for a time,  but the inhabitants dared not go down into the valleys. They could not  take their grain to the market. The valley roads were all deserted  except for bands of Sisera's troopers. Each year Sisera grew stronger,  and more of the Hebrews submitted to him. In a little while there  would have been none left to call themselves Hebrews and to keep up  the noble traditions and hopes of Moses and Abraham.    =A wise and patriotic woman.=--If only the more distant tribes had  come to the help of those that bordered on Sisera's kingdom, if only  all the Hebrews had stood together, they could easily have defended  themselves. But no one seemed to see this, or had faith enough to try  to accomplish anything in this way \"until Deborah arose.\" One day  there came up through the sheepfolds of the Reubenites this remarkable  woman whose name was Deborah. \"Come to the help of your brethren  across the river,\" she said, as she told her story. \"Come to the help  of Jehovah, by helping his people.\"    At first the Reubenites seemed greatly moved by Deborah's words.  Certainly, they would come, whenever Deborah and her friends were  ready. So the brave woman was encouraged and went to other tribes, to  all of them one after another. But not everywhere was she successful.  Many said: \"Why should we go up and help your people? Suppose Sisera  wins, he will come and punish us. We will stay here where we are  safe.\" Even the Reubenites, whose first resolves had been so brave,  changed their minds, and \"stayed in their sheepfolds, listening to the  pipings of the flocks.\"    =The battle by the Kishon River.=--After many weeks of tramping,  however, Deborah was able to get a few of the tribes really organized.  Ephraim, Benjamin, Naphtali, Zebulun, Issachar, and some smaller clans  all promised to send troops and did send them. An army was gathered  under a captain named Barak. The Canaanites under Sisera came out to  fight them, and the battle took place on the flat fields of the Plain  of Esdraelon. It looked like a victory for Sisera. He had charioteers  as well as foot soldiers--troops of men in heavy war carts, from the  axles of which extended sharp blades like scythes.    But Deborah had called to her people in the name of Jehovah. And  Jehovah seemed, indeed, to be on their side. We may well believe that  it was the spirit of God that put it into the hearts of Deborah and  Barak to delay the battle until there should be a rainy day. When the  clash finally came there was a heavy downpour. The flat plain became a  swamp. The war chariots sank into the mud and were helpless. The  Canaanites became panic-stricken and fled in terror. Many of them were  drowned in the attempt to cross the Kishon, which is usually a shallow  creek, but on that day was a deep and swiftly flowing torrent.  Sisera, himself in flight, was killed by a woman in whose tent he  tried to take refuge. The battle was won for Jehovah's people. The  Hebrews could still be free and independent, and they had learned a  valuable lesson--the necessity for cooperation.      STUDY TOPICS    1. Read chapters 4 and 5 of the book of Judges.    2. With the help of a map showing the location of the various tribes  in Canaan, find the ones which were most in danger from Sisera, whose  kingdom was in the Plain of Esdraelon.    3. With the help of the map, explain why it was not easy for Deborah  to persuade the Reubenites and the Gileadites to enter this war.    4. What arguments would you have used to persuade them?    5. Could you use the same arguments in favor of the League of Nations  and our membership in it, as a nation?          CHAPTER XII    EXPERIMENTS IN GOVERNMENT      After Sisera was conquered, the Hebrew tribes which had combined  against him immediately fell apart, relapsing into the same state of  disunion and disorganization as before. And very soon other enemies  took advantage of it to plunder and kill.    =The Midianites.=--Among the most harassing of these enemies for a  time were the Midianites, who lived as nomads, roaming over the  deserts just as the Hebrews themselves had done except that they made  their living chiefly by robbery. Every spring just after the wheat and  barley had begun to sprout, covering all the fields with a carpet of  the brightest green, bands of these nomads would drive their flocks  across the Jordan and turn them loose on the young grain while the men  stood guard in armed bands. In the summer and fall after what was left  of the grain had been harvested and beaten out on the threshing floors  they would come again and steal the threshed grain, taking it away in  bags on the backs of camels.    Sometimes the Hebrews would keep the wheat and barley unthreshed with  the sheaves piled up in grain ricks and would thresh it out, a little  at a time, in the low, half-concealed wine presses, which were dug in  the rock. No one's life was safe where these marauders were in the  habit of coming, and no family could be sure of food to carry them  over the winter months.      GIDEON, THE ABIEZRITE    In the tribe of Manasseh there was a little clan called Abiezer. One  night a band of Midianites came on camels and raided the villages of  this clan, killing some of the people, and carrying away whatever they  found of value. They then fled back across the Jordan River to the  desert before enough Hebrew men could get together to resist them.    =The counter-raid.=--In the heart of one young man, the brother of  some who were killed, God planted a sudden determination to put a stop  to these murders and robberies. He called for volunteers to pursue  this band across the river, and when some three hundred had responded  they set out in hot haste, down the hillsides into the plain of the  Jordan, up the slopes on the eastern side, and out onto the plains  where the Midianites supposed they were safe. It was hard to track  them over these solitary wastes; and they had their swift camels. But  Gideon trailed them; stealing up at night, he surprised them. They  fled in terror leaving much spoil, and for many years the Hebrews were  not molested by this particular tribe of desert wanderers.    =The kingdom of Gideon.=--Out of this experience the Hebrews in  central Canaan gained another lesson in cooperation; and they made up  their minds to profit by it. Here is a man, they said to themselves,  who can lead us to victory against our foes. If we all agree to do as  he says we can all stand together, each for all and all for each. So  they came to Gideon, and asked him to be their ruler. He refused at  first, but it is clear that he finally accepted and really became king  over some of the tribes and clans of central Canaan. One of his sons,  a certain Abimelech, seized the kingdom after Gideon's death and  proved to be a selfish tyrant. He was killed by his enemies, and that  was the end of the dynasty of Gideon. \"How can we have unity and  cooperation under a strong leader,\" the Hebrews asked themselves, \"and  not at the same time be in danger of slavery under a ruthless tyrant?\"  That was a difficult question.      THE PHILISTINES    Meanwhile a national enemy far more dangerous than any previously  mentioned had begun to threaten their existence as a people. About the  same time that the Hebrews settled in Canaan there had landed from  ships on the southwestern coast some newcomers of another race,  perhaps akin to the Greeks; they were called Philistines. They quickly  became a rich and powerful nation, holding the coast towns of Gath,  Askelon, Gaza, Ashdod, and Ekron. They were ambitious to become  masters of the whole land of Canaan. Their soldiers, in well-trained  bands, built forts and established garrisons here and there, in the  leading towns, and compelled the Hebrews to pay tribute.    At the same time they did not protect the country from other enemies.  For example, there were the Amalekites on the southern border, who  were robber-nomads, just like the Midianites on the east. There were  the people of Ammon, a town east of the Jordan. From these and other  petty enemies the Hebrews suffered much, and the Philistines did  nothing to help them. All they cared about was the tribute. \"O for a  leader like Deborah and Gideon!\" the Hebrews once again began to cry.    =The messengers with the raw meat.=--One day messengers came hurrying  through the towns and villages of central Canaan bearing sacks or  baskets of raw beef chopped into small squares. To the leading men of  each village, they handed a piece of the bloody flesh with this  message: \"This piece of ox flesh is from Saul, the son of Kish, of  Gibeah in Benjamin. As this flesh is cut into small pieces so will the  flesh of the men of your village be chopped up if you do not come at  once, armed for battle, to help our brothers in Jabesh in Gilead east  of the Jordan, which is besieged by the Ammonites.\" \"Who is Saul?\"  many asked, and few could answer. Some perhaps were able to explain  that he was a brave and able young farmer, a friend of a prophet named  Samuel, in the tribe of Benjamin. But it was the raw meat that  persuaded them to obey the summons. Here is a real leader, they said,  a man who means what he says. And two or three nights later an army of  Hebrews, with Saul in the lead, came dashing in among the tents of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18193"],[0,"Ways of Wood Folk (#11)"],[1,"till I saw both birds fly to the nest, each with  some long threads. This was repeated; and then curiosity got the  better of consideration. While the orioles were weaving the last  threads into their nest, I ran round the house, crept a long way  behind the old wall, and so to a safe hiding place near the  crab-apple.    The orioles had solved their problem; the bit of cloth was fastened  there securely among the thorns. Soon the birds came back and, seizing  some threads by the ends, raveled them out without difficulty. It was  the work of but a moment to gather as much material as they could use  at one weaving. For an hour or more I watched them working  industriously between the crab-apple and the old elm, where the nest  was growing rapidly to a beautiful depth. Several times the bit of  cloth slipped from the thorns as the birds pulled upon it; but as  often as it did they carried it back and fastened it more securely,  till at last it grew so snarled that they could get no more long  threads, when they left it for good.    That same day I carried out some bright-colored bits of worsted and  ribbon, and scattered them on the grass. The birds soon found them and  used them in completing their nest. For a while a gayer little  dwelling was never seen in a tree. The bright bits of color in the  soft gray of the walls gave the nest always a holiday appearance, in  good keeping with the high spirits of the orioles. But by the time the  young had chipped the shell, and the joyousness of nest-building had  given place to the constant duties of filling hungry little mouths,  the rains and the sun of summer had bleached the bright colors to a  uniform sober gray.    That was a happy family from beginning to end. No accident ever befell  it; no enemy disturbed its peace. And when the young birds had flown  away to the South, I took down the nest which I had helped to build,  and hung it in my study as a souvenir of my bright little neighbors.          VI. THE BUILDERS.      [Illustration]    A curious bit of wild life came to me at dusk one day in the  wilderness. It was midwinter, and the snow lay deep. I was sitting  alone on a fallen tree, waiting for the moon to rise so that I could  follow the faint snowshoe track across a barren, three miles, then  through a mile of forest to another trail that led to camp. I had  followed a caribou too far that day, and this was the result--feeling  along my own track by moonlight, with the thermometer sinking rapidly  to the twenty-below-zero point.    There is scarcely any twilight in the woods; in ten minutes it would  be quite dark; and I was wishing that I had blankets and an axe, so  that I could camp where I was, when a big gray shadow came stealing  towards me through the trees. It was a Canada lynx. My fingers gripped  the rifle hard, and the right mitten seemed to slip off of itself as I  caught the glare of his fierce yellow eyes.    But the eyes were not looking at me at all. Indeed, he had not noticed  me. He was stealing along, crouched low in the snow, his ears back,  his stub tail twitching nervously, his whole attention fixed tensely  on something beyond me out on the barren. I wanted his beautiful skin;  but I wanted more to find out what he was after; so I kept still and  watched.    At the edge of the barren he crouched under a dwarf spruce, settled  himself deeper in the snow by a wriggle or two till his feet were well  under him and his balance perfect, and the red fire blazed in his eyes  and his big muscles quivered. Then he hurled himself forward--one,  two, a dozen mighty bounds through flying snow, and he landed with a  screech on the dome of a beaver house. There he jumped about, shaking  an imaginary beaver like a fury, and gave another screech that made  one's spine tingle. That over, he stood very still, looking off over  the beaver roofs that dotted the shore of a little pond there. The  blaze died out of his eyes; a different look crept into them. He put  his nose down to a tiny hole in the mound, the beavers' ventilator,  and took a long sniff, while his whole body seemed to distend with the  warm rich odor that poured up into his hungry nostrils. Then he rolled  his head sadly, and went away.    Now all that was pure acting. A lynx likes beaver meat better than  anything else; and this fellow had caught some of the colony, no  doubt, in the well-fed autumn days, as they worked on their dam and  houses. Sharp hunger made him remember them as he came through the  wood on his nightly hunt after hares. He knew well that the beavers  were safe; that months of intense cold had made their two-foot mud  walls like granite. But he came, nevertheless, just to pretend he had  caught one, and to remember how good his last full meal smelled when  he ate it in October.    It was all so boylike, so unexpected there in the heart of the  wilderness, that I quite forgot that I wanted the lynx's skin. I was  hungry too, and went out for a sniff at the ventilator; and it smelled  good. I remembered the time once when I had eaten beaver, and was glad  to get it. I walked about among the houses. On every dome there were  lynx tracks, old and new, and the prints of a blunt nose in the snow.  Evidently he came often to dine on the smell of good dinners. I looked  the way he had gone, and began to be sorry for him. But there were the  beavers, safe and warm and fearless within two feet of me, listening  undoubtedly to the strange steps without. And that was good; for they  are the most interesting creatures in all the wilderness.    Most of us know the beaver chiefly in a simile. \"Working like a  beaver,\" or \"busy as a beaver,\" is one of those proverbial  expressions that people accept without comment or curiosity. It is  about one-third true, which is a generous proportion of truth for a  proverb. In winter, for five long months at least, he does nothing but  sleep and eat and keep warm. \"Lazy as a beaver\" is then a good figure.  And summer time--ah! that's just one long holiday, and the beavers are  jolly as grigs, with never a thought of work from morning till night.  When the snow is gone, and the streams are clear, and the twitter of  bird songs meets the beaver's ear as he rises from the dark passage  under water that leads to his house, then he forgets all settled  habits and joins in the general heyday of nature. The well built house  that sheltered him from storm and cold, and defied even the wolverine  to dig its owner out, is deserted for any otter's den or chance hole  in the bank where he may sleep away the sunlight in peace. The great  dam, upon which he toiled so many nights, is left to the mercy of the  freshet or the canoeman's axe; and no plash of falling water through a  break--that sound which in autumn or winter brings the beaver like a  flash--will trouble his wise little head for a moment.    All the long summer he belongs to the tribe of Ishmael, wandering  through lakes and streams wherever fancy leads him. It is as if he  were bound to see the world after being cooped up in his narrow  quarters all winter. Even the strong family ties, one of the most  characteristic and interesting things in beaver life, are for the time  loosened. Every family group when it breaks up housekeeping in the  spring represents five generations. First, there are the two old  beavers, heads of the family and absolute rulers, who first engineered  the big dam and houses, and have directed repairs for nobody knows how  long. Next in importance are the baby beavers, no bigger than  musquashes, with fur like silk velvet, and eyes always wide open at  the wonders of the first season out; then the one-and two-year-olds,  frisky as boys let loose from school, always in mischief and having to  be looked after, and occasionally nipped; then the three-year-olds,  who presently leave the group and go their separate happy ways in  search of mates. So the long days go by in a kind of careless summer  excursion; and when one sometimes finds their camping ground in his  own summer roving through the wilderness, he looks upon it with  curious sympathy. Fellow campers are they, pitching their tents by  sunny lakes and alder-fringed, trout-haunted brooks, always close to  Nature's heart, and loving the wild, free life much as he does  himself.    But when the days grow short and chill, and the twitter of warblers  gives place to the _honk_ of passing geese, and wild ducks gather in  the lakes, then the heart of the beaver goes back to his home; and  presently he follows his heart. September finds them gathered about  the old dam again, the older heads filled with plans of repair and new  houses and winter food and many other things. The grown-up males have  brought their mates back to the old home; the females have found their  places in other family groups. It is then that the beaver begins to be  busy.    His first concern is for a stout dam across the stream that will give  him a good-sized pond and plenty of deep water. To understand this,  one must remember that the beaver intends to shut himself in a kind of  prison all winter. He knows well that he is not safe on land a moment  after the snow falls; that some prowling lucivee or wolverine would  find his tracks and follow him, and that his escape to water would be  cut off by thick ice. So he plans a big claw-proof house with no  entrance save a tunnel in the middle, which leads through the bank to  the bottom of his artificial pond. Once this is frozen over, he cannot  get out till the spring sun sets him free. But he likes a big pond,  that he may exercise a bit under water when he comes down for his  dinner; and a deep pond, that he may feel sure the hardest winter will  never freeze down to his doorway and shut him in. Still more  important, the beaver's food is stored on the bottom; and it would  never do to trust it to shallow water, else some severe winter it  would get frozen into the ice, and the beavers"]]]
