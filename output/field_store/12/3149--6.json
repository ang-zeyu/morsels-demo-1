The  crowds in the streets of Berlin went wild with joy over the news of the  two ultimatums. There were cries of \"On to Paris\" and \"On to St.  Petersburg.\" The Kaiser addressed his people from the balcony of his  palace. In the course of his speech, he said, \"The sword is being forced  into our hand.\" The government of Germany had decided to make its people  believe that they were about to fight in self-defense.    Russia would not demobilize her armies under a German threat.  Consequently the next day, August 1, Germany declared war upon Russia.  Two days later, August 3, Germany declared war on France because that  country had refused to desert her ally in this time of danger. The  greatest war of all history had begun.    GREAT BRITAIN ENTERS THE WAR.--The German military leaders felt sure  that Great Britain would remain neutral in case of a general European  war. They based this belief on the peaceful temper of the English  people, upon the serious domestic problems she was facing, such as the  question of woman suffrage, Irish Home Rule, and the threatening labor  situation. Germany regarded England as a nation of shopkeepers who would  not fight unless they were attacked. After Germany had made herself  supreme on the Continent England's turn would come.    Great Britain's agreement with France and Russia, the other members of  the Triple Entente, did not go so far as to require her to join them in  case they should be involved in war. It is difficult to say whether or  not Great Britain would have decided to enter the conflict at this time  if a new element had not been introduced into the question by Germany's  invasion of Belgium. Of this invasion more will be said in the following  chapter. All that need be mentioned here is that Germany, in spite of a  long-standing treaty to observe Belgium's neutrality, had decided on  marching through that country as the best route to Paris. Great Britain,  as one of the nations which had promised to protect the neutrality of  Belgium, immediately demanded of the German government that it withdraw  its plan of invasion. Germany refused, and on August 4 Great Britain  declared war. So one week after Austria's declaration of war against  Serbia all the powers of the Triple Entente--commonly called the  Allies--were in arms against Germany and Austria. Italy, the third  member of the Triple Alliance, on August 1 declared herself neutral,  much to the disappointment and anger of the Central Powers, her former  allies. Her treaty with them provided that she should come to their aid  only in case they were attacked, and so did not apply to the present  war, in which Germany and Austria were the aggressors.

CHAPTER VIII    THE WAR IN 1914      GERMAN PLAN OF ATTACK.--As soon as the German leaders had determined  upon war, their military machine was set in motion. The plan was first  to attack France and crush her armies before the slow-moving Russians  could get a force together; and then, after the defeat of France, to  turn to the east and subdue Russia. The success of the plan was  dependent upon the swift overthrow of France; and this in turn hinged  upon the question as to whether German armies could invade France before  the French were ready. Speed was the essential thing, and in order to  gain speed Germany committed one of the greatest crimes in modern  history.    From the nearest point on the German boundary to Paris is only one  hundred and seventy miles. But no rapid invasion of France could be made  in this direction for two reasons: first, because of the very strong  forts which protected the French frontier; and second, on account of the  nature of the land, which presents to the east a series of five easily  defended ridges, each of which would have to be stormed by an invader. A  German attack directly across the French frontier could move but slowly  past these natural and military obstacles; and the French nation would  have ample time to mobilize its forces.    Consequently the German military leaders determined to attack France  from the northeast. Here a comparatively level plain stretched from  Germany through Belgium and France up to Paris itself. Many good roads  and railways traversed the land. Few natural barriers existed to aid the  defenders, and France, trusting to the neutrality of Belgium, had no  strong fortifications on her northeastern frontier. One obstacle to  German invasion existed; it was what the German Chancellor once[2]  called \"a scrap of paper\"--a promise to respect the neutrality of  Belgium, which Prussia, France, and England had agreed to by formal  treaties. Similar treaties guaranteed the neutrality of Luxemburg, a  small country east of Belgium. Upon these promises France had depended  for the protection of her northeastern border; for the German Empire had  accepted all the rights and all the duties of the treaties made by  Prussia. But now, under the plea of necessity which \"knows no law,\" the  German rulers determined to break their promises, violate the neutrality  of Belgium and Luxemburg, and crush France before an aroused and alarmed  world could interfere.    BELGIUM BLOCKS THE GERMAN PLAN.--The invasion of Belgium had two  results which the Germans had not foreseen. In the first place, it  brought Great Britain immediately into the war to the aid of Belgium  and France. In the second place, the Belgian king and people refused to  be bought off with a promise of compensation; they made the high  decision to defend their country as long as possible against the  terrible German army-machine. Said the Belgian king: \"A country which  defends itself commands the respect of all; that country cannot perish.\"  This action of Belgium disarranged the German army plans; instead of  reaching Paris according to schedule, the Germans were delayed in  Belgium for ten days. These ten days were full of horror and suffering  and defeat for the brave Belgians; but they are precious days in the  light of history. They gave time for the French to mobilize their armies  and bring them up to the northeast; and they enabled Great Britain to  send across the English Channel her first hundred thousand troops. In  this way Paris was saved from capture, and France from conquest; and  probably the whole world from German domination. The German plans for  world conquest met their first defeat at the hands of brave little  Belgium. The would-be conquerors had forgotten to include in their  time-table the elements of honor, patriotism, and self-sacrifice.    [Illustration: THE WESTERN FRONT 1914]    THE GERMAN ADVANCE.--Luxemburg was occupied without resistance, for  that little country had no army. On August 4, 1914, the German armies  attacked the Belgian fortress of Liege (lee-[)e]zh'), and within  twenty-three days Belgium was overrun, its capital taken, and all the  important places except Antwerp captured. After the delay in Belgium,  the main German armies advanced into France. Here they were met (August  21-23) by French and British troops; but the defenders were not yet  strong enough to stop the German advance. For twelve days they fell back  toward Paris, fighting continually, until the invaders were within  twenty miles of the city. The French government and archives were  withdrawn from Paris to Bordeaux in the southwest, so imminent seemed  the capture of the capital. The battle line now extended for one hundred  and seventy-five miles eastward from near Paris to the fortress of  Verdun.    THE FIRST BATTLE OF THE MARNE.--In the meantime the French commander,  General Joffre (zhofr), had secretly been collecting another army with  which to attack the invaders on the flank from the west. At the right  moment he hurled this army upon the German flank, while the men on the  main battle line were commanded to \"face about and accept death rather  than surrender.\" On September 6-10 took place the first great battle of  the Marne, during which the Germans, under these new attacks, were  compelled to retreat fifty miles from their most advanced position. The  French armies had rescued Paris in the nick of time. The French  government once more returned to its capital. \"France had saved herself  and Europe.\"    THE RACE TO THE COAST.--On reaching the river Aisne (an) the German  armies had time to entrench themselves and thus beat off the heavy  attacks of the French and British (September 12-17). The Allied armies  in turn began to entrench opposite the German positions. But both armies  turned toward the north in a race to reach the North Sea and outflank  the enemy. The Germans were particularly anxious to reach Calais  (ca-l[)e]') and cut the direct line of communication between England and  France. Antwerp surrendered to the Germans on October 9; Lille (leel) on  the 13th. In tremendous massed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17212"],[0,"Michelangelo (#11)"],[1,"of inaction.    [Illustration: LORENZO DE' MEDICI. _Church of S. Lorenzo, Florence._]    His mood is not that of a dreamer lost to his present surroundings.  Rather he seems to be keenly aware of what is going on; his  meditations have to do with the present. It is as if, having given an  order, he awaits its execution, his mind still intent upon his  purposes, satisfied with his decision, and calmly expectant of its  success. His affair is one of serious importance; no trifling matter  absorbs the thought of this grave man. \"A king sits in this attitude  when, in the midst of his army, he orders the execution of some  judicial act, like the destruction of a city. Frederic Barbarossa must  have appeared thus when he caused Milan to be ploughed up.\"[30]    [Footnote 30: Taine, _Travels in Italy_.]    The lack of resemblance in the statue to the original duke Lorenzo  made it for a long time doubtful whether it was intended to be his  tomb. The Florentines, in their poetic way, fell into the habit of  calling it _Il Pensiero_, that is, Thought, or Meditation, sometimes  _Il Pensieroso_, The Thinker. These are, after all, the best names for  the statue, which is allegorical rather than historical in its  intention. The great English poet Milton has written a poem, which is  like a companion piece to the statue, fitting it as words sometimes  fit music. It begins in this way, in words which _Il Pensieroso_  himself might speak:--        \"Hence, vain deluding Joys,      The brood of Folly, without father bred!      How little you bested,      Or fill the fixed mind with all your toys!      Dwell in some idle brain,      And fancies fond with gaudy shape possess,      As thick and numberless      As the gay motes that people the sunbeams,      Or likest hovering dreams,      The fickle pensioners of Morpheus' train.      But hail! thou Goddess sage and holy,      Hail, divinest Melancholy!\"    Lorenzo's statue stands in a niche above the sarcophagus, or stone  coffin, in which his body was laid. On the top of the sarcophagus are  two reclining figures called Dawn and Twilight. The tomb itself is in  a chapel, or sacristy, called the New Sacristy (to distinguish it from  one still older), in the Church of S. Lorenzo, Florence. The entire  sacristy is devoted to the memory of the Medici family, who had for  several generations been benefactors of this church.    Now Michelangelo had a great deal to do with this family first and  last, and his work on the tomb has an additional interest on this  account. It was to Lorenzo the Magnificent that he owed his first  start as a sculptor in an academy founded by this prince. He so  pleased his patron that he was received into the duke's own household,  and treated almost like a son. Years passed; Lorenzo had long been  dead, when, one after another, two members of the same family came to  the papal throne, and they desired to honor their name by employing  the greatest sculptor of Italy in this monumental work.    So Michelangelo began designs for the sacristy, the entire decoration  of which was intrusted to him. The walls of the rooms were panelled  with marble, set with niches, in the form of windows, in which the  statues were to be placed.    As the work proceeded, it was interrupted by some strange incidents,  of which we shall hear later. The whole plan was never fully carried  out, but in spite of incompleteness the chapel is a grand and  impressive place.          XIV    THE TOMB OF GIULIANO DE' MEDICI      The tomb of Giuliano de' Medici is the companion to the tomb of  Lorenzo, and stands on the opposite side of the altar which separates  them. Our illustration shows the entire work, the statue being in the  niche above, and the sarcophagus standing below with two reclining  figures on it.    Giuliano de' Medici, duke of Nemours, was the youngest son of Lorenzo  the Magnificent, and consequently the uncle of the younger Lorenzo. In  reality he was greatly superior to his nephew, but curiously enough  his appearance in Michelangelo's statue is more commonplace, though  his attitude is graceful. He was a thoughtful man, somewhat melancholy  in disposition, and the author of a poem on suicide. He wears the  costume of a Roman general, but his small head and slender throat are  not those of a warrior.    You will notice that the attitude of the duke Giuliano is somewhat  similar to that of Moses. Both sit with left foot drawn back and right  knee extended. Both turn the head in profile, looking intently toward  the left. In either case it is easy to imagine the figure suddenly  springing up.    Now this fact emphasizes the difference we have already noted between  the sculpture of Michelangelo and that of the Greeks. The leading idea  in Greek sculpture was that of repose, while, as we have seen in the  David and the Cupid, Michelangelo chose for his figures a moment of  action. To give this suggestion of motion to a seated figure is even  more remarkable than in the case of one standing, for the sitting  posture naturally has an effect of stability.    The reclining figures on the sarcophagus of the Duke Giuliano  represent Night and Day, and are supposed to be symbolic of death and  resurrection. Night is a woman lying with head sunk upon the breast in  a deep sleep. She is crowned with a crescent moon and star, and an owl  is placed at her feet. The mask beneath her pillow symbolizes the body  from which the spirit has departed. Though the figure is not beautiful  in the Greek sense, it is grand and queenly. Opposite is Day, an  unfinished captive, his head half freed from the stone, the arms  rigid, the body contorted.    These two figures, together with Dawn and Twilight on Lorenzo's tomb,  have an allegorical meaning which must be read in the light of  Michelangelo's own life history. \"Life is a dream between two  slumbers; sleep is death's twin-brother; night is the shadow of death;  death is the gate of life--such is the mysterious mythology wrought by  the sculptor.\"[31]    [Footnote 31: Symonds, in _Renaissance in Italy: the Fine Arts_.]    The work on the Medicean tombs covered a period of about twelve years.  During this time the Medici family passed through varying fortunes,  and in consequence the fate of the tombs, and indeed that of the  sculptor himself, hung in the balance. Florence became weary of  tyranny and rose in a revolution which drove the Medici from the city  in 1527.    [Illustration: TOMB OF GIULIANO DE' MEDICI. _Church of S. Lorenzo,  Florence._]    Success was of short duration: the republic soon \"found herself  standing out against a world of foes,\" the Pope, Clement VII. (himself  a Medici), \"threatening fire and flame,\" and all the Medici family  \"getting ready to return in double force.\" The Florentines prepared to  fight for their liberty, and Michelangelo was found among the  patriots. No sense of personal gratitude to the Medici could shake his  love of liberty. He forsook the monuments and turned his skill to the  fortification of the city.    For eleven months Florence was besieged, and in the end the city was  captured. The Medici returned conquerors. Mercenaries now broke into  the houses, killing the best citizens. Had not Michelangelo been in  hiding, he too would have perished. But the Pope could not afford to  lose his best sculptor, and, calling him forth from his hiding-place,  again set him to work in the Medici chapel. It is not strange that the  sculptor's proud spirit rebelled at having to work on that which was  to honor the enemies of his beloved Florence.    Thus it was that his sculpture told the story of \"the tragedy of  Florence: how hope had departed, how life had become a desert, and how  it was hard to struggle with waking consciousness, but good to sleep  and forget--nay, best of all, to be stone and feel no more.\"    The old writer Vasari, who was once a pupil of Michelangelo, and tells  us many anecdotes of the sculptor, relates that when the statue of  Night was first shown to the public, it called forth a verse from a  contemporary poet (Giovan Battista Strozzi). This is the verse:--        \"Night in so sweet an attitude beheld      Asleep, was by an angel sculptured      In this stone; and sleeping, is alive;      Waken her, doubter; she will speak to thee.\"[32]    To this Michelangelo replied in the following lines:[33]--        \"Welcome is sleep, more welcome sleep of stone      Whilst crime and shame continue in the land;      My happy fortune not to see or hear;      Waken me not;--in mercy whisper low.\"[32]    The artist's verse may be taken as a keynote to the solemn tragedy of  the work. In fact, the monuments are not really to Lorenzo and  Giuliano, but to Florence, to \"the great city which had struggled and  erred so long, which had gone astray and repented, and suffered and  erred again, but always mightily, with full tide of life in her veins  and consciousness in her heart, until now the time had come when she  was dead and past, chained down by icy oppression in a living  grave.\"[34]    [Footnote 32: Both translations are from Horners' _Walks in Florence_.  Symonds has also translated the verses, but less literally.]    [Footnote 33: Swinburne in his lines, \"In San Lorenzo,\" answers these  lines, \"Is thine hour come to waken, slumbering Night?\"]    [Footnote 34: This and the preceding quotations are from Mrs.  Oliphant's _Makers of Florence_.]          XV    CENTRAL FIGURES IN THE LAST JUDGMENT      There are in the Bible certain references to a great day when the Son  of Man shall be seen \"coming in the clouds with great power and  glory.\" \"And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet,  and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one  end of heaven to the other.\"[35] St. Paul, in a letter which he wrote  to the Christians in Corinth, speaks of this as a \"mystery,\" and  says:[36] \"We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a"]]]
