Those who hold that the influence of the Church of Rome in the dark  ages was, on the whole, beneficial to mankind, may yet with perfect  consistency regard the Reformation as an inestimable blessing. The  leading strings, which preserve and uphold the infant, would impede the  fullgrown man. And so the very means by which the human mind is, in one  stage of its progress, supported and propelled, may, in another stage,  be mere hindrances. There is a season in the life both of an individual  and of a society, at which submission and faith, such as at a later  period would be justly called servility and credulity, are useful  qualities. The child who teachably and undoubtingly listens to the  instructions of his elders is likely to improve rapidly. But the man who  should receive with childlike docility every assertion and dogma uttered  by another man no wiser than himself would become contemptible. It is  the same with communities. The childhood of the European nations  was passed under the tutelage of the clergy. The ascendancy of the  sacerdotal order was long the ascendancy which naturally and properly  belongs to intellectual superiority. The priests, with all their faults,  were by far the wisest portion of society. It was, therefore, on the  whole, good that they should be respected and obeyed. The encroachments  of the ecclesiastical power on the province of the civil power produced  much more happiness than misery, while the ecclesiastical power was in  the hands of the only class that had studied history, philosophy, and  public law, and while the civil power was in the hands of savage chiefs,  who could not read their own grants and edicts. But a change took place.  Knowledge gradually spread among laymen. At the commencement of the  sixteenth century many of them were in every intellectual attainment  fully equal to the most enlightened of their spiritual pastors.  Thenceforward that dominion, which, during the dark ages, had been, in  spite of many abuses, a legitimate and salutary guardianship, became an  unjust and noxious tyranny.    From the time when the barbarians overran the Western Empire to the time  of the revival of letters, the influence of the Church of Rome had been  generally favourable to science to civilisation, and to good government.  But, during the last three centuries, to stunt the growth of the human  mind has been her chief object. Throughout Christendom, whatever advance  has been made in knowledge, in freedom, in wealth, and in the arts of  life, has been made in spite of her, and has everywhere been in inverse  proportion to her power. The loveliest and most fertile provinces  of Europe have, under her rule, been sunk in poverty, in political  servitude, and in intellectual torpor, while Protestant countries, once  proverbial for sterility and barbarism, have been turned by skill  and industry into gardens, and can boast of a long list of heroes and  statesmen, philosophers and poets. Whoever, knowing what Italy and  Scotland naturally are, and what, four hundred years ago, they actually  were, shall now compare the country round Rome with the country round  Edinburgh, will be able to form some judgment as to the tendency of  Papal domination. The descent of Spain, once the first among monarchies,  to the lowest depths of degradation, the elevation of Holland, in spite  of many natural disadvantages, to a position such as no commonwealth so  small has ever reached, teach the same lesson. Whoever passes in Germany  from a Roman Catholic to a Protestant principality, in Switzerland  from a Roman Catholic to a Protestant canton, in Ireland from a Roman  Catholic to a Protestant county, finds that he has passed from a lower  to a higher grade of civilisation. On the other side of the Atlantic the  same law prevails. The Protestants of the United States have left far  behind them the Roman Catholics of Mexico, Peru, and Brazil. The Roman  Catholics of Lower Canada remain inert, while the whole continent round  them is in a ferment with Protestant activity and enterprise. The French  have doubtless shown an energy and an intelligence which, even when  misdirected, have justly entitled them to be called a great people. But  this apparent exception, when examined, will be found to confirm the  rule; for in no country that is called Roman Catholic, has the Roman  Catholic Church, during several generations, possessed so little  authority as in France. The literature of France is justly held in high  esteem throughout the world. But if we deduct from that literature all  that belongs to four parties which have been, on different grounds,  in rebellion against the Papal domination, all that belongs to  the Protestants, all that belongs to the assertors of the Gallican  liberties, all that belongs to the Jansenists, and all that belongs to  the philosophers, how much will be left?    It is difficult to say whether England owes more to the Roman Catholic  religion or to the Reformation. For the amalgamation of races and for  the abolition of villenage, she is chiefly indebted to the influence  which the priesthood in the middle ages exercised over the laity. For  political and intellectual freedom, and for all the blessings which  political and intellectual freedom have brought in their train, she  is chiefly indebted to the great rebellion of the laity against the  priesthood.    The struggle between the old and the new theology in our country was  long, and the event sometimes seemed doubtful. There were two extreme  parties, prepared to act with violence or to suffer with stubborn  resolution. Between them lay, during a considerable time, a middle  party, which blended, very illogically, but by no means unnaturally,  lessons learned in the nursery with the sermons of the modern  evangelists, and, while clinging with fondness to all observances, yet  detested abuses with which those observances were closely connected. Men  in such a frame of mind were willing to obey, almost with thankfulness,  the dictation of an able ruler who spared them the trouble of judging  for themselves, and, raising a firm and commanding voice above the  uproar of controversy, told them how to worship and what to believe.  It is not strange, therefore, that the Tudors should have been able to  exercise a great influence on ecclesiastical affairs; nor is it strange  that their influence should, for the most part, have been exercised with  a view to their own interest.    Henry the Eighth attempted to constitute an Anglican Church differing  from the Roman Catholic Church on the point of the supremacy, and on  that point alone. His success in this attempt was extraordinary. The  force of his character, the singularly favourable situation in which  he stood with respect to foreign powers, the immense wealth which the  spoliation of the abbeys placed at his disposal, and the support of  that class which still halted between two Opinions, enabled him to bid  defiance to both the extreme parties, to burn as heretics those who  avowed the tenets of the Reformers, and to hang as traitors those who  owned the authority of the Pope. But Henry's system died with him. Had  his life been prolonged, he would have found it difficult to maintain a  position assailed with equal fury by all who were zealous either for  the new or for the old opinions. The ministers who held the royal  prerogatives in trust for his infant son could not venture to persist in  so hazardous a policy; nor could Elizabeth venture to return to it. It  was necessary to make a choice. The government must either submit to  Rome, or must obtain the aid of the Protestants. The government and the  Protestants had only one thing in common, hatred of the Papal power.  The English Reformers were eager to go as far as their brethren on the  Continent. They unanimously condemned as Antichristian numerous dogmas  and practices to which Henry had stubbornly adhered, and which Elizabeth  reluctantly abandoned. Many felt a strong repugnance even to things  indifferent which had formed part of the polity or ritual of the  mystical Babylon. Thus Bishop Hooper, who died manfully at Gloucester  for his religion, long refused to wear the episcopal vestments. Bishop  Ridley, a martyr of still greater renown, pulled down the ancient altars  of his diocese, and ordered the Eucharist to be administered in the  middle of churches, at tables which the Papists irreverently termed  oyster boards. Bishop Jewel pronounced the clerical garb to be a stage  dress, a fool's coat, a relique of the Amorites, and promised that  he would spare no labour to extirpate such degrading absurdities.  Archbishop Grindal long hesitated about accepting a mitre from dislike  of what he regarded as the mummery of consecration. Bishop Parkhurst  uttered a fervent prayer that the Church of England would propose to  herself the Church of Zurich as the absolute pattern of a Christian  community. Bishop Ponet was of opinion that the word Bishop should be  abandoned to the Papists, and that the chief officers of the purified  church should be called Superintendents. When it is considered that  none of these prelates belonged to the extreme section of the Protestant  party, it cannot be doubted that, if the general sense of that party  had been followed, the work of reform would have been carried on as  unsparingly in England as in Scotland.    But, as the government needed the support of the protestants, so the  Protestants needed the protection of the government. Much was therefore  given up on both sides: an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1470"],[0,"The Fall of the Moghul Empire of Hindustan (#11)"],[1,"myself with either  party.\" The blunt counsel pleased the Shah. \"You are right,  Najib,\" said Ahmad, \"and the Nawab is misled by the impulses of  youth. I disbelieve in the Mahratta penitence, and I am not going  to throw you over whom I have all along regarded as the manager  of this affair. Though in my position I must hear every one, yet  I promise never to act against your advice.\"    While these things were passing in the Moslem camp, the  Mahrattas, having exhausted their last resource by the plunder of  the town of Panipat, sent all their chiefs on the same evening to  meet in the great durbar-tent. It was now the 6th of January, and  we may fancy the shivering, starving Southerners crouched on the  ground and discussing their griefs by the wild torchlight. They  represented that they had not tasted food for two days, and were  ready to die fighting, but not to die of hunger. Pan was  distributed, and all swore to go out an hour before daybreak and  drive away the invaders or perish in the attempt.    As a supreme effort, the Bhao, whose outward bearing at durbar  had been gallant and dignified, had despatched a short note to  our Pandit, who gives the exact text. \"The cup is full to the  brim, and cannot hold another drop. If anything can be done, do  it. If not, let me know plainly and at once; for afterwards there  will be no time for writing, or for speech.\" The Pandit was with  Shujaa, by the time this note arrived Â— the hour was 3 A.M. Â— and  he handed it to his master, who began to examine the messenger.  While he was so doing, his spies ran in with the intelligence  that the Mahrattas had left their lines. Shujaa, at once hastened  to the Shah's tent.    Ahmad had lain down to rest, but his horse was held ready saddled  at the entry. He rose from his couch and asked, \"What news?\" The  Nawab told him what he had heard. The Shah immediately mounted  and sent for the Pandit. While the latter was corroborating the  tidings brought by his master, Ahmad, sitting on his horse, was  smoking a Persian pipe and peering into the darkness. All at once  the Mahratta cannon opened fire, on which the Shah, handing his  pipe to an orderly, said calmly to the Nawab, \"Your follower's  news was very true I see.\" Then summoning his prime minister,  Shah Wali, and Shah Pasand the chief of his staff, he made his  dispositions for a general engagement when the light of day came.    Yes, the news was true. Soon after the despatch of the Bhao's  note, the Mahratta troops broke their fast with the last  remaining grain in camp, and prepared for a mortal combat; coming  forth from their lines with turbans dishevelled and  turmeric-smeared faces, like devotees of death. They marched in  an oblique line, with their left in front, preceded by their  guns, small and great. The Bhao, with the Peshwa's son and the  household troops, was in the centre. The left wing consisted of  the gardis under Ibrahim Khan; Holkar and Sindhia were on the  extreme right.    On the other side the Afghans formed a somewhat similar line,  their left being formed by Najib's Rohillas, and their right by  two brigades of Persian troops. Their left centre was led by the  two vazirs, Shujaa-ud-daulah and Shah Wali. The right centre  consisted of Rohillas, under the well-known Hafiz Rahmat and  other chiefs of the Indian Pathans. Day broke, but the Afghan  artillery for the most part kept silence, while that of the  enemy, losing range in its constant advance, threw away its  ammunition over the heads of the enemy and dropped its shot a  mile to their rear. Shah Pasand Khan covered the left wing with a  choice body of mailed Afghan horsemen, and in this order the army  moved forward, leaving the Shah at his usual post in the little  tent, which was now in rear of the line, from whence he could  watch and direct the battle.    On the other side no great precautions seem to have been taken,  except indeed by the gardis and their vigilant leader, who  advanced in silence and without firing a shot, with two  battalions of infantry bent back to their left flank, to cover  their advance from the attack of the Persian cavalry forming the  extreme right of the enemy's line. The valiant veteran soon  showed the worth of French discipline, and another division such  as his would have probably gained the day. Well mounted and  armed, and carrying in his own hand the colours of his own  personal command, he led his men against the Rohilkhand columns  with fixed bayonets, and to so much effect that nearly 8,000 were  put hors de combat. For three hours the gardis remained in  unchallenged possession of that part of the field.  Shujaa-ud-daulah, with his small but compact force, remained  stationary, neither fighting nor flying, and the Mahrattas  forebore to attack him. The corps between this and the Pathans  was that of the Daurani Vazir, and it suffered severely from the  shock of an attack delivered upon them by the Bhao himself at the  head of the household troops. The Pandit, being sent through the  dust to inform Shujaa of what was going on, found Shah Wali  vainly trying to rally the courage of his followers, of whom many  were in full retreat. \"Whither would you run, friends,\" cried the  Vazir, \"your country is far from here.\"    Meanwhile, on the left of the Mohamadan line, the prudent Najib  had masked his advance by a series of breastworks, under cover of  which he had gradually approached the hostile force. \"I have the  highest stake to-day,\" he said, \"and cannot afford to make any  mistakes.\" The part of the enemy's force immediately opposed to  him was commanded by the then head of the Sindhia house, who was  Najib's personal enemy. Till noon Najib remained on the  defensive, keeping off all close attacks upon his earthworks by  continuous discharges of rockets. But so far the fortune of the  day was evidently inclined towards the Mahrattas. The Mohamadans'  left still held their own under the two Vazirs and Najib; but the  centre was cut in two, and the right was almost destroyed.  Victory seemed to await the Mahrattas.    Of the circumstances which turned the tide and gave the crisis to  the Moslems, but one account necessarily exists. Hitherto we have  had the guidance of Grant-Duff for the Mahratta side of the  affair, but now the whole movement was to be from the other side,  and we cannot do better than trust the Pandit. Dow, the only  other contemporary author of importance Â— if we except Gholam  Hosain, who wrote at a very remote place Â— is most irremediably  inaccurate and vague about all these transactions. The Pandit,  then, informs us that, during those earlier hours of the  conflict, the Shah had watched the fortunes of the battle from  his tent, guarded by the still unbroken forces on his left. But  now, hearing that his right was reeling and his centre was  defeated, he felt that the moment was come for a final effort. In  front of him the Hindu cries of Har! Har! Jai Mahadeo! were  maintaining an equal and dreadful concert with those of Allah!  Allah! Din! Din! from his own side. The battle wavered to and fro  like that of Flodden as described by Scott. The Shah saw the  critical moment in the very act of passing. He therefore sent 500  of his own body-guard with orders to arise all able-bodied men  out of camp, and send them to the front at any cost. 1,500 more  he sent to encounter those who were flying, and slay without pity  any who would not return to the fight. These, with 4,000 of his  reserve troops, went to support the broken ranks of the Rohilla  Pathans on the right. The remainder of the reserve, 10,000  strong, were sent to the aid of Shah Wali, still labouring  unequally against the Bhao in the centre of the field. The Shah's  orders were clear. These mailed warriors were to charge with the  Vazir in close order, and at full gallop. As often as they  charged the enemy in front, the chief of the staff and Najib were  directed to fall upon either flank. These orders were immediately  carried out.    The forward movement of the Moslems began at 1 P.M. The fight was  close and obstinate, men fighting with swords, spears, axes, and  even with daggers. Between 2 and 3 P.M. the Peshwa's son was  wounded, and, having fallen from his horse, was placed upon an  elephant. The last thing seen of the Bhao was his dismounting  from another elephant, and getting on his Arab charger. Soon  after the young chief was slain. The next moment Holkar and the  Gaikwar left the field. In that instant resistance ceased, and  the Mahrattas all at once became helpless victims of butchery.  Thousands were cut down; other thousands were drowned in  escaping, or were slaughtered by the country people whom they had  so long pillaged. The Shah and his principal commanders then  retired to camp, leaving the pursuit to be completed by  subordinate officers. Forty thousand prisoners are said to have  been slain. Among the prisoners was Ibrahim, the valiant and  skilful leader of the gardis. Though severely wounded, he was  taken care of in Shujaa's tents, where his wounds received  surgical attention. Shujaa also endeavoured to extend protection  to the head of the house of Sindhia. A subordinate member of the  clan, the afterwards celebrated Madhoji Â— who was to become in  his turn master of the whole country Â— fled from the field; and  the late Colonel Skinner used to describe how this chief Â— in  whose service he at one time was Â— would relate the mental  agonies he endured on his light Deccanee mare from the lobbing  paces and roaring breath of a big Northern horse, on which he was  pursued for many miles by an Afghan, greedy of blood and booty.    Jankoji, the then head of the family, was killed next day, a  victim to the enmity of Najib, whose policy included  relentlessness. Ibrahim Gardi was taken from Shujaa by a mixture  of force and fraud. He was put into the charge of the Afghan  Vazir, and died in that charge a week after. A headless body,  "]]]
