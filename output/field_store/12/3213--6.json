Even the Genius, though rather vaguely,  passes over to the state and we hear of the _Genius populi Romani_ or  the _Genius urbis Romae_, with regard to which Servius quotes from an  inscription on a shield the characteristic addition, _sive mas sive  femina_: in much later times we find the exact counterpart of the  domestic worship of the Genius of the _pater familias_ in the cult of  the Genius of the Emperor--the foundation of the whole of the imperial  worship.    We have observed already how the cults of the fields were taken over by  the state and their counterparts established in the great festivals of  the Calendar. Naturally enough most of the deities concerned, existing  only for the part they played in these festivals, retained their  original character without further development. But with a few it was  different: it was their fate to acquire new characteristics and new  functions, and, developing with the needs of the community, to become  the great gods of the state: of these we must give some brief account.    =Iuppiter.=--We have known Iuppiter hitherto either in connection with  certain very primitive survivals, or in the genuine Roman period as a  sky-_numen_, concerned with the grape-harvest in the two Vinalia and  the Meditrinalia, and the recipient at the family meal of a _daps_ as a  general propitiation before the beginning of the sowing. As sky-god he  passes to the state: _Lucetius_ (_lux_) is his title in the song of the  Salii and to him are sacred the Ides of every month--the time of the  full moon, when there is most light in the heavens by night as well as  day. In his agricultural connection he has his wine-festivals in the  state as in the country, and the household _daps_ becomes the more  elaborate _epulum Iovis_, in which the whole community, as it were,  entertained him at a banquet. As a sky-deity, too, he is particularly  concerned with the thunderbolt and the lightning-flash (_Iuppiter  Fulmen_, _Fulgur_), and to him are sacred the always ominous spots  which had been struck by lightning (_bidentalia_): with the more  alarming occurrence of lightning by night he has a special connection  under the cult-title _Iuppiter Summanus_. But as the little community  grew, and especially perhaps after the union of the two settlements,  the worship of Iuppiter Feretrius, associated with the sacred oak upon  the Capitol--the hill between Palatine and Quirinal--comes more and  more into prominence as a bond of union and the central point of the  state's religious life: it tends indeed to take the place of priority,  which had previously been occupied by Ianus. The community goes to war  with its neighbours, and after a signal victory the _spolia opima_ must  be dedicated on the sacred oak: indeed Iuppiter is in a special sense  with them in the battle and must now be worshipped as the 'stayer of  rout' (_Stator_) and the 'giver of victory' (_Victor_). War is a new  province of the state's activity, but, characteristically enough, it  does not evolve its own _numen_, but enlarges the sphere of the  somewhat elastic spirits already existing. So too in the internal  organisation of the state there is felt the need of a religious  sanction for public morality, and Iuppiter--though vaguely at  first--takes on him the character of a deity of justice. In this  connection he is primarily the god of oaths: we have seen how his  sacred _silex_ was used in the oath of treaty: it is also the most  solemn witness to the oath of the citizen. Iuppiter Lapis becomes  specially the Dius Fidius, a cult-title which subsequently sets up for  itself and produces a further offshoot in the abstract Fides. Finally,  towards the end of our period the Iuppiter of the Capitol emerges  triumphant, as it were, from his struggle with his rivals and, with the  new title of Iuppiter Optimus Maximus,--the 'best and greatest,' that  is, of all the Iuppiters--takes his place as the supreme deity of the  Roman state and the personification of the greatness and majesty of  Rome itself. To his temple hereafter the Roman youth will come to make  his offering when he takes the dress of manhood; here the magistrates  will do sacrifice before entering on their year of office: here the  victorious general will pass in procession with the spoils of his  victory: on the walls shall be suspended treaties with foreign nations  and offerings sent by subject princes and states from all quarters of  the world: all that Rome is to be, will be, as it were, embodied in the  sky-spirit of the sacred oak, the god of justice and of victory in war.    =Iuno.=--Iuppiter carries with him into the state-worship his female  counterpart, Iuno, with his own characteristics, in a certain degree,  and his own privileges. She is Lucina and Fulgura as he is Lucetius and  Fulgur: white cows are her offerings as white steers are his: as the  Ides are sacred to Iuppiter, so--though they are not a festival--are  the Calends to Iuno. But from the first she shows a certain  independence and develops on lines of her own. In the curious ceremony  of the fixing of the Nones (the first quarter of the month), held on  the Calends in the _curia Calabra_, she seems to appear as a  moon-goddess: the _rex sacrorum_, after a report from a _pontifex_ as  to the appearance of the new moon, announces the result in the formula:  'I summon thee for five (or seven) days, hollow Iuno' (_dies te  quinque_ [_septem_] _kalo, Iuno Covella_: hence the name _Kalendae_).  But far more prominently--either as a female divinity herself, or, as  some think, owing to the supposed influence of the moon on female  life--does Iuno figure as the deity of women, and especially in  association with childbirth and marriage. As _Lucina_ she is, as we  have seen, the presiding deity of childbirth, and her festival on the  1st of March, though not in the Calendars (because confined to women  and not therefore a festival of the whole people), attained immense  popularity under the title of the Matronalia. She has too a general  superintendence of the rites of marriage, and the various little  _numina_, who play so prominent a part in the ceremonies, tend to  attach themselves to her as cult-titles. The festival of the  servant-maids in honour of Iuno Caprotina on the 7th of July shows the  same notion of Iuno as the women's goddess, which appears again in  common parlance when women speak of their Iuno, just as men do of their  Genius. Later on Iuno acquires the characteristics of majesty  (_Regina_) and protection in war (_Curitis_, _Sospita_), partly no  doubt as Iuppiter's counterpart, but more directly through the  introduction of cults from neighbouring Italian towns.    =Mars.=--We have seen reason to believe that in the earlier stages of  Roman religion Mars was a _numen_ of vegetation, but though the  Ambarvalia was duly taken over into the state-cult and attained a very  high degree of importance, yet there can be no doubt that in the  state-religion Mars was pre-eminently associated with war. Iuppiter  might help at need in averting defeat and awarding victory, but it was  with Mars that the general conduct of war rested. His sacred animal is  the warlike wolf, his symbols the spears and the sacred shields  (_ancilia_), which during his own month (_Martius_)--the 1st of which  is his special festival--his priests (_Salii_) wearing the full  war-dress (_trabea_ and _tunica picta_) carry with sacred dance and  song round the city. His altar is in the Campus Martius, outside the  city-walls and therefore within the sphere of the _imperium militiae_,  and the other festivals associated with him are of a warlike character:  the races of the war-horse (Equirria) on March 14 and February 27, and  the great race on the Ides of October, when the winner was solemnly  slain: the lustration of the arms at the Quinquatrus on March 19 and  the Armilustrium of October 19--at the beginning and end of the  campaigning season: and the lustration of the war-trumpets on the 23rd  of March and the 23rd of May. But above all in honour of Mars is held  the great quinquennial _lustrum_ associated with the census, when the  people are drawn up in military array around his altar in the Campus  Martius and the solemn offering of the _suovetaurilia_ (is this a faint  relic of his agricultural character?) after being carried three times  round the gathered host, is offered on his altar in prayer for the  military future of the state. Hardly any god in the state-cult has his  character so clearly marked, and we may regard Mars as a deity who,  taking on new functions to suit the needs of the times, almost entirely  lost the traces of his original nature.    =Quirinus.=--Iuppiter and Mars then became the great state-deities of  the developed community and to them is added, as the contribution of  the Colline settlement, their own particular deity, Quirinus. He, like  them, has his own _flamen_; like Mars he has his _Salii_, and his  festival finds its place in the Calendars on February the 17th. But of  his ritual and character we know practically nothing: the ritual was  obscured because his festival coincided with the much more popular  festival of the _curiae_, the _stultorum feriae_: of his character, we  can only conjecture that he was to the Colline settlement what Mars was  to the Palatine, whereas later after the complete amalgamation he seems  to have been distinguished from Mars as representing 'armed peace'  rather than war--an idea which is borne out by the associations of the  closely allied word _Quirites_. Be that as it may, we have in Iuppiter,  Mars, and Quirinus the great state-triad of the synoecismus, who held  their own until at the beginning of the next epoch they were supplanted  by the new Etruscan triad of the Capitol, Iuppiter, Iuno and Minerva.    =2.

Then the men began to divide into factions,  of which the women were the cause; and those who were without wives,  endeavored to seize upon the wives of those who were married, whence the  greatest trouble arose. Snorri, Karlsefni's son, was born the first  autumn, and he was three winters old when they took their departure. When  they sailed away from Wineland, they had a southerly wind, and so came  upon Markland, where they found five Skrellings,[41-2] of whom one was  bearded, two were women, and two were children. Karlsefni and his people  took the boys, but the others escaped, and these Skrellings sank down  into the earth. They bore the lads away with them, and taught them to  speak, and they were baptized. They said, that their mother's name was  Vaetilldi, and their father's Uvaegi. They said, that kings governed the  Skrellings, one of whom was called Avalldamon, and the other  Valldidida.[41-3] They stated, that there were no houses there, and that  the people lived in caves or holes. They said, that there was a land on  the other side over against their country, which was inhabited by people  who wore white garments, and yelled loudly, and carried poles before  them, to which rags were attached;[42-1] and people believe that this  must have been Hvitramanna-land [White-men's-land], or Ireland the  Great.[42-2] Now they arrived in Greenland, and remained during the  winter with Eric the Red.    Biarni, Grimolf's son, and his companions were driven out into the  Atlantic,[42-3] and came into a sea, which was filled with worms, and  their ship began to sink beneath them. They had a boat, which had been  coated with seal-tar; this the sea-worm does not penetrate. They took  their places in this boat, and then discovered that it would not hold  them all. Then said Biarni: \"Since the boat will not hold more than half  of our men, it is my advice, that the men who are to go in the boat, be  chosen by lot, for this selection must not be made according to rank.\"  This seemed to them all such a manly offer, that no one opposed it. So  they adopted this plan, the men casting lots; and it fell to Biarni to go  in the boat, and half of the men with him, for it would not hold more.  But when the men were come into the boat, an Icelander, who was in the  ship, and who had accompanied Biarni from Iceland, said: \"Dost thou  intend, Biarni, to forsake me here?\" \"It must be even so,\" answers  Biarni. \"Not such was the promise thou gavest my father,\" he answers,  \"when I left Iceland with thee, that thou wouldst thus part with me, when  thou saidst, that we should both share the same fate.\" \"So be it, it  shall not rest thus,\" answers Biarni; \"do thou come hither, and I will go  to the ship, for I see that thou art eager for life.\" Biarni thereupon  boarded the ship, and this man entered the boat, and they went their way,  until they came to Dublin in Ireland, and there they told this tale; now  it is the belief of most people, that Biarni and his companions perished  in the maggot-sea, for they were never heard of afterward.    _Karlsefni and his Wife Thurid's Issue._--The following summer Karlsefni  sailed to Iceland and Gudrid with him, and he went home to Reyniness. His  mother believed that he had made a poor match, and she was not at home  the first winter. However, when she became convinced that Gudrid was a  very superior woman, she returned to her home, and they lived happily  together. Hallfrid was a daughter of Snorri, Karlsefni's son, she was the  mother of Bishop Thorlak,[43-1] Runolf's son. They had a son named  Thorbiorn, whose daughter's name was Thorunn, [she was] Bishop  Biorn's[43-2] mother. Thorgeir was the name of a son of Snorri,  Karlsefni's son, [he was] the father of Ingveld, mother of Bishop Brand  the Elder. Steinunn was a daughter of Snorri, Karlsefni's son, who  married Einar, a son of Grundar-Ketil, a son of Thorvald Crook, a son of  Thori of Espihol. Their son was Thorstein the Unjust, he was the father  of Gudrun, who married Jorund of Keldur. Their daughter was Halla, the  mother of Flosi, the father of Valgerd, the mother of Herra Erlend the  Stout, the father of Herra Hauk the Lawman. Another daughter of Flosi was  Thordis, the mother of Fru Ingigerd the Mighty. Her daughter was Fru  Hallbera, Abbess of Reyniness at Stad. Many other great people in Iceland  are descended from Karlsefni and Thurid, who are not mentioned here. God  be with us, Amen!    FOOTNOTES:    [14-1] The translation that follows, by Arthur Middleton Reeves, is based  on the text of Hauk's Book, No. 544 of the Arna-Magnaean Collection,  collated with No. 557 of the same collection. In _Origines Islandicae_,  II. 610, this saga is called \"The Story of Thorfinn Carlsemne.\"    [14-2] The rubrics here given in italics are found in the original  manuscript.    [14-3] In eastern Norway.    [14-4] From 853 to 871.    [15-1] A blank in the original manuscript.    [15-2] This introductory paragraph, giving at the end the ancestry of  Gudrid, the daughter of Thorbiorn Vifilson and a prominent figure in the  Vinland voyages, seems to come first on account of the earlier historical  allusions that it contains. The account of Gudrid is continued in the  third paragraph.    [15-3] In southwestern Norway.    [16-1] Movable planks used in constructing the lock-beds of the sleeping  apartment. They were often beautifully carved, and hence valuable.    [16-2] An island midway between Iceland and Greenland, discovered in the  latter part of the ninth century. Gunnbiorn was a Norwegian. This island  is no longer above the surface. See Fiske, _The Discovery of America_, p.  242.    [17-1] This should read _Eastern_ Settlement, evidently a clerical error  in an original manuscript, as both Hauk's Book and AM. 557 reproduce it.  There were two settlements in Greenland, the Eastern and Western, both,  however, to the westward of Cape Farewell, and between that cape on the  south and Disco Island on the north. Ericsey (_i.e._, Eric's Island) was  at the mouth of Ericsfirth, near the present Julianshaab. For further  details on the geography of these settlements, see Reeves, _The Finding  of Wineland the Good_, p. 166, (25), and Fiske, _The Discovery of  America_, I. 158, note.    [17-2] On the western coast of Greenland, about 70 deg. N. Lat.    [17-3] The saga up to this point is taken from Landnama-bok, the great  Icelandic authority on early genealogy and history. It might well have  included one more paragraph (the succeeding one), which gives an  approximate date to the colonization of Greenland: \"Ari, Thorgil's son,  says that that summer twenty-five ships sailed to Greenland out of  Borgfirth and Broadfirth; but fourteen only reached their destination;  some were driven back, and some were lost. This was sixteen [S: fifteen]  winters before Christianity was legally adopted in Iceland.\" That is, in  about 985, as Christianity was accepted in 1000 (or 1001). There is a  possible variation of a year in the usually accepted date. See _Origines  Islandicae_, I. 369.    [20-1] \"Winter-night-tide\" was about the middle of October.    [23-1] The home of Eric the Red, in the Eastern Settlement.    [24-1] This was evidently the first time that the voyage from Greenland  to Norway was accomplished without going by way of Iceland, and was a  remarkable achievement. The aim was evidently to avoid the dangerous  passage between Greenland and Iceland.    [24-2] A reference to some strange happenings in the winter of 1000-1001  at the Icelandic farmstead Froda, as related in the Eyrbyggja Saga.    [25-1] Of the year 999. See next note.    [25-2] King Olaf ruled from 995 to 1000. He fell at the battle of Svolder  (in the Baltic) in September, 1000. It was in the same year that Leif  started out as the King's missionary to Greenland. See p. 43, note 1.    [25-3] A wild cereal of some sort. Fiske is convinced that it was Indian  corn, while Storm thinks it was wild rice, contending with much force  that Indian corn was a product entirely unknown to the explorers, and  that they could not by any possibility have confused it with wheat, even  if they had found it. There is, moreover, no indication in this saga that  they found cultivated fields. Storm cites Sir William Alexander,  _Encouragement to Colonies_ (1624), who, in speaking of the products of  Nova Scotia, refers, among other things, to \"some eares of wheate, barly  and rie growing there wild.\" He also cites Jacques Cartier, who, in 1534,  found in New Brunswick \"wild grain like rye, which looked as though it  had been sowed and cultivated.\" See Reeves, p. 174, (50).    [25-4] Supposed to be maple.    [26-1] Also called Thorhild.    [27-1] That is, were near Ireland.    [28-1] The display of an axe seems to have been thought efficacious in  laying fetches. See Reeves, p. 171, (39), citing a passage from another  saga.    [30-1] Thorfinn Karlsefni, the explorer of the Vinland expeditions, was  of excellent family. His lineage is given at greater length in the  _Landnama-bok_ (Book of Settlements).    [31-1] Usually called Gudrid.    [32-1] There is doubt as to why the expedition sailed northwest to the  Western Settlement. Possibly Thorfinn desired to make a different start  than Thorstein, whose expedition was a failure. See Reeves, p. 172, (45).    [32-2] _Doegr_ was a period of twelve hours. Reeves quotes the following  from an old Icelandic work: \"In the day there are two _doegr_; in the  _doegr_ twelve hours.\" A _doegr's_ sailing is estimated to have been  about one hundred miles. There is evidently a clerical error in this  passage after the number of days' sailing. The words for \"two\" and  \"seven\" are very similar"]]]
