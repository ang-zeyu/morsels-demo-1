So I hope none of you ever bite one. And  they won't bite you if you don't bother them.    So as soon as Uncle Wiggily saw that it was Mr. Hedgehog who was speaking  he wasn't a bit afraid, for he knew him.    \"Oh, it's you, is it?\" asked the rabbit. \"I'm real glad to see you. I was  going to travel on, but----\"    \"Don't say another word!\" cried the hedgehog heartily. \"You can stay in my  cave all night. I have two beds, and it's a good thing I have, for if you  slept with me you might get full of my stickery-stickers.\"    \"Yes, I guess I had better sleep alone,\" said Uncle Wiggily, with a laugh.  \"But it seems to me, Mr. Hedgehog, that you are not looking well.\"    \"I'm not,\" answered the porcupine, as he shivered so that several of his  quills fell out on the grass. \"I'm suffering for some cherry pie. Oh,  cherry pie! If I only had some I know I'd feel better at once. I just love  it!\"    \"Why don't you make some yourself?\" asked Uncle Wiggily.    \"I have tried,\" replied the hedgehog. \"I've tried and tried again, but,  somehow, it never comes out right. Here, I'll show you. I made a cherry  pie just before I looked out of the door and saw you. I'll show it to  you.\"    He went into his little stone house, and Uncle Wiggily went with him.    \"There's the pie--it's no good!\" cried the porcupine, as he pointed to  something on the table. Well, as soon as Uncle Wiggily saw it he laughed  so hard that his ears waved back and forth.    \"What's the matter? I don't see anything funny,\" asked Mr. Hedgehog,  shivering so that more quills fell out.    \"Why, you've gone and put the cherry pits into the pie instead of the  cherries,\" said the rabbit. \"That's no way to do. You must take out the  stones from inside the cherries and put the outside part of them inside  the pie, and throw the inside or stony part of the cherries away.\"    \"Oh, good land!\" cried the hedgehog, \"no wonder I couldn't eat the pie.  You see, I thought cherries were like peanuts. For you know you throw away  the outside part of the peanut, and eat the inside.\"    \"Yes, and cherries are just the opposite,\" said the rabbit, laughing  again. \"For you eat the outside of a cherry and throw away the pit or  stone that is inside. Now, I'll make you a cherry pie.\"    \"I wish you would,\" said the porcupine. \"I'll go get the cherries.\"    So he went out in the orchard, and he shot his sharp stickery quills, like  little arrows at the cherries on the tree, and they fell down, so he  could pick them up in a basket. I mean the cherries fell down, though of  course the quills did also though the hedgehog didn't pick them up.    And while he was doing that Uncle Wiggily was making the pie crust. He  took flour and lard and water, and mixed them together, and then he put in  other things--Oh, well, you just ask your mamma or the cook what they  were, for I might get it wrong--and soon the pie crust was ready. Then  Uncle Wiggily built a hot fire in the stove, and he waited for Mr.  Hedgehog to come in with the cherries.    And pretty soon the porcupine came back with his basket full, and he and  Uncle Wiggily shelled the peanuts--I mean the cherries--taking out the  pits.    \"Now I'll put them in the pie, and put sugar on them, bake it in the oven,  and soon it will be done, and we can eat it,\" said the rabbit.    \"Oh, joy!\" cried the hedgehog. \"That will be fine!\"    So Uncle Wiggily put the cherries in the pie, and threw the pits away, and  he put the pie in the oven, and then he and Mr. Hedgehog sat down to wait  for it to bake. And oh, how delicious and scrumptious it did smell! if you  will excuse me for saying so.    Well, in a little while, the pie was baked, and Uncle Wiggily took it from  the oven.    \"I can hardly wait to eat it!\" cried the hedgehog, and just then there  came a terribly loud knock on the door.    \"Oh, maybe it's that bad fox come for some of my pie!\" exclaimed the  hedgehog. \"If it is, I'll stick him full of stickery-stickers.\" But when  he went to the door there stood old Percival, the circus dog, and he was  crying as hard as he could cry.    \"Come in,\" invited Uncle Wiggily. \"Come in, and have some cherry pie, and  you'll feel better.\" So Percival came in, and they all three sat down, and  ate the cherry pie all up, and sure enough Percival did feel better, and  stopped crying.    Then the circus dog and Uncle Wiggily stayed all night with Mr. Hedgehog,  and they had more cherry pie next day, and it was very fine and sweet.    Now, if our cook makes some nice watermelon sandwiches, with maple syrup  on them, for supper, I'll tell you in the next story about Uncle Wiggily  and old dog Percival, and why Percival cried.          STORY XVI    UNCLE WIGGILY AND PERCIVAL      Now I'm going to tell you, before I forget it, why old dog Percival was  crying that time when he came to the little stone house where the hedgehog  lived, and where Uncle Wiggily gave him some cherry pie. And the reason  Percival was crying, was because he had stepped on a sharp stone, and hurt  his foot.    \"But I don't in the least mind now,\" said Percival, after he had eaten  about sixty-'leven pieces of the pie. \"My foot is all better.\"    \"I should think that cherry pie would make almost any one better,\" said  the hedgehog, laughing with joy, for he felt better, too. \"I know some bad  boys to whom I'm going to give some cherry pie, and I hope it makes them  better. And to think I threw away the good part of the cherries and cooked  the stones in the pie. Oh, excuse me while I laugh again!\"    And the hedgehog laughed so hard that he spilled some of the red cherry  pie juice on his shirt front, but he didn't care, for he had another  shirt.    Well, Uncle Wiggily and Percival, the old circus dog, stayed for some days  at the home of the hedgehog, and they had cherry pie, or fritters with  maple syrup, at almost every meal. Then, finally, Uncle Wiggily said:    \"Well, I guess I must travel on. I can't find my fortune here. I must  start off to-morrow.\"    \"And I'll go with you,\" spoke Percival. \"We'll go together, and see what  we can find.\"    Well, he and Uncle Wiggily went on together for some time, and nothing  happened, except that they met a poor pussy cat without any tail, and  Uncle Wiggily gave her some of the pie. And the next day they met a cat  and seven little kittens, and they all had tails, so they had to have some  pie, too.    But one night, after Percival and Uncle Wiggily had been traveling all  day, they came to a deep, dark, dismal woods.    \"Oh, have we got to go through that forest?\" asked the old gentleman  rabbit, wrinkling up his ears--I mean his nose.    \"I guess we have,\" replied the circus dog. \"We may find our fortunes in  there.\"    \"It is a pretty dark spot to look for money, or fortunes,\" said the  rabbit. \"The best thing we can do is to look for a place to sleep, and in  the morning we will hurry out of the woods.\"    Well, the two animal friends started into the grove of trees, and they  hadn't gone very far before it got so dark that they couldn't see to go  any farther. Oh, but it was black and lonesome and sort of scary-like! and  Uncle Wiggily said:    \"Let's stay here, Percival. We'll make a little bed under the trees to  sleep in, and we'll build a fire to keep us warm, and cook a little  supper.\"    So Percival thought that would be nice, and soon he and the rabbit had a  cheerful little fire blazing, and then it wasn't quite so lonely. Only  there was a big owl in a tree, and he kept hollering \"Who? Who? Who?\" and  Percival thought it meant him, and Uncle Wiggily thought it meant him, and  they were rather frightened, so they didn't either of them answer the owl,  who kept on calling \"Who? Who? Who?\"    They were just cooking their supper, and cutting up the cherry pie, and  putting it on some oak leaves for plates, and they had picked out a nice  smooth stump for a table, when, all of a sudden, they heard a voice  saying:    \"Now you make a jump and grab the rabbit and I'll take the dog. Then we  can carry them off to our dens, and that will be the last of them. Get  ready now!\"    \"Did you hear that?\" asked Uncle Wiggily of the circus dog.    \"Indeed I did,\" replied Percival. \"I wonder if it can be those owls?\"    \"It doesn't sound like them,\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"I think it is a bad  fox, or maybe two of them.\"    And just then they looked off through the woods, and by the light of the  fire they saw two big, savage, ugly wolves. Oh, how their sharp teeth  gleamed in the dancing flames, and how red their tongues were!    \"Come on! Grab 'em both!\" cried one savage wolf. \"Grab the rabbit and the  dog!\"    \"Sure! I'm with you!\" growled the other savage wolf.    \"Oh, what shall we do, Uncle Wiggily?\" asked Percival. \"They'll eat us up!    \"Let me think a minute,\" said the rabbit. So he thought for maybe half a  minute, and then exclaimed: \"Oh! I know a good thing to do.\"    \"What?\" asked Percival. \"Say it quickly, Uncle Wiggily, for those wolves  are creeping up on us, and it's so dark we can't see to run away.\"    And surely enough, those wolves were sneaking up, with their red tongues  hanging out longer than ever, for all the world just as if they had eaten  cherry pie.    \"We must do some funny tricks!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. \"You know how,  Percival, for you were once in a circus, and I learned some when I was  with the monkey, and with Fido Flip-Flop. Do some tricks, and maybe these  wolves will feel so good-natured that they won't bite us.\"    So brave Uncle Wiggily stood up on one ear and waved his feet in the air.  Then he stood on his nose and turned a somersault. Next he went around and  around as fast as a pinwheel, and he whistled a funny tune about a little  rubber ball that flew into the air, and when it landed on the ground it  would not stay"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15293"],[0,"Influences of Geographic Environment (#11)"],[1,"s.[36] [See map page  101.]    [Sidenote: Stature and environment]    Darwin holds that many slight changes in animals and plants, such as  size, color, thickness of skin and hair, have been produced through food  supply and climate from the external conditions under which the forms  lived.[37] Paul Ehrenreich, while regarding the chief race distinctions  as permanent forms, not to be explained by external conditions,  nevertheless concedes the slight and slow variation of the sub-race  under changing conditions of food and climate as beyond doubt.[38]  Stature is partly a matter of feeding and hence of geographic condition.  In mountain regions, where the food resources are scant, the varieties  of wild animals are characterized by smaller size in general than are  corresponding species in the lowlands. It is a noticeable fact that  dwarfed horses or ponies have originated in islands, in Iceland, the  Shetlands, Corsica and Sardinia. This is due either to scanty and  unvaried food or to excessive inbreeding, or probably to both. The  horses introduced into the Falkland Islands in 1764 have deteriorated so  in size and strength in a few generations that they are in a fair way to  develop a Falkland variety of pony.[39] On the other hand, Mr. Homer  Davenport states that the pure-bred Arabian horses raised on his New  Jersey stock farm are in the third generation a hand higher than their  grandsires imported from Arabia, and of more angular build. The result  is due to more abundant and nutritious food and the elimination of long  desert journeys.    The low stature of the natives prevailing in certain \"misery spots\" of  Europe, as in the Auvergne Plateau of southern France, is due in part to  race, in part to a disastrous artificial selection by the emigration of  the taller and more robust individuals, but in considerable part to the  harsh climate and starvation food-yield of that sterile soil; for the  children of the region, if removed to the more fertile valleys of the  Loire and Garonne, grow to average stature.[40] The effect of a scant and  uncertain food supply is especially clear in savages, who have erected  fewer buffers between themselves and the pressure of environment. The  Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert are shorter than their Hottentot kindred  who pasture their flocks and herds in the neighboring grasslands.[41]  Samoyedes, Lapps, and other hyperborean races of Eurasia are shorter  than their more southern neighbors, the physical record of an immemorial  struggle against cold and hunger. The stunted forms and wretched aspect  of the Snake Indians inhabiting the Rocky Mountain deserts distinguished  these clans from the tall buffalo-hunting tribes of the plains.[42] Any  feature of geographic environment tending to affect directly the  physical vigor and strength of a people cannot fail to prove a potent  factor in their history.    [Sidenote: Physical effects of dominant activities.]    Oftentimes environment modifies the physique of a people indirectly by  imposing upon them certain predominant activities, which may develop one  part of the body almost to the point of deformity. This is the effect of  increased use or disuse which Darwin discusses. He attributes the thin  legs and thick arms of the Payaguas Indians living along the Paraguay  River to generations of lives spent in canoes, with the lower  extremities motionless and the arm and chest muscles in constant  exercise.[43] Livingstone found these same characteristics of broad  chests and shoulders with ill-developed legs among the Barotse of the  upper Zambesi;[44] and they have been observed in pronounced form,  coupled with distinctly impaired powers of locomotion, among the  Tlingit, Tsimshean, and Haida Indians of the southern Alaskan and  British Columbia coast, where the geographic conditions of a mountainous  and almost strandless shore interdicted agriculture and necessitated  sea-faring activities.[45] An identical environment has produced a like  physical effect upon the canoemen of Tierra del Fuego[46] and the  Aleutian Islanders, who often sit in their boats twenty hours at a  time.[47] These special adaptations are temporary in their nature and  tend to disappear with change of occupation, as, for instance, among the  Tlingit Indians, who develop improved leg muscles when employed as  laborers in the salmon canneries of British Columbia.    [Sidenote: Effects of climate.]    Both the direct and indirect physical effects of environment thus far  instanced are obvious in themselves and easily explained. Far different  is it with the majority of physical effects, especially those of  climate, whose mode of operation is much more obscure than was once  supposed. The modern geographer does not indulge in the naive hypothesis  of the last century, which assumed a prompt and direct effect of  environment upon the form and features of man. Carl Ritter regarded the  small, slit eyes and swollen lids of the Turkoman as \"an obvious effect  of the desert upon the organism.\" Stanhope Smith ascribed the high  shoulders and short neck of the Tartars of Mongolia to their habit of  raising their shoulders to protect the neck against the cold; their  small, squinting eyes, overhanging brows, broad faces and high cheek  bones, to the effect of the bitter, driving winds and the glare of the  snow, till, he says, \"every feature by the action of the cold is harsh  and distorted.\"[48] These profound influences of a severe climate upon  physiognomy he finds also among the Lapps, northern Mongolians,  Samoyedes and Eskimo.    [Sidenote: Acclimatization]    Most of these problems are only secondarily grist for the geographer's  mill. For instance, when the Aryans descended to the enervating lowlands  of tropical India, and in that debilitating climate lost the qualities  which first gave them supremacy, the change which they underwent was  primarily a physiological one. It can be scientifically described and  explained therefore only by physiologists and physico-chemists; and upon  their investigations the geographer must wait before he approaches the  problem from the standpoint of geographical distribution. Into this  sub-class of physical effects come all questions of acclimatization.[49]  These are important to the anthropo-geographer, just as they are to  colonial governments like England or France, because they affect the  power of national or racial expansion, and fix the historical fate of  tropical lands. The present populations of the earth represent physical  adaptation to their environments. The intense heat and humidity of most  tropical lands prevent any permanent occupation by a native-born  population of pure whites. The catarrhal zone north of the fortieth  parallel in America soon exterminates the negroes.[50]    The Indians of South America, though all fundamentally of the same  ethnic stock, are variously acclimated to the warm, damp, forested  plains of the Amazon; to the hot, dry, treeless coasts of Peru; and to  the cold, arid heights of the Andes. The habitat that bred them tends to  hold them, by restricting the range of climate which they can endure. In  the zone of the Andean slope lying between 4,000 and 6,000 feet of  altitude, which produces the best flavored coffee and which must be  cultivated, the imported Indians from the high plateaus and from the low  Amazon plains alike sicken and die after a short time; so that they take  employment on these coffee plantations for only three or five months,  and then return to their own homes. Labor becomes nomadic on these  slopes, and in the intervals these farm lands of intensive agriculture  show the anomaly of a sparse population only of resident managers.[51]  Similarly in the high, dry Himalayan valley of the upper Indus, over  10,000 feet above sea level, the natives of Ladak are restricted to a  habitat that yields them little margin of food for natural growth of  population but forbids them to emigrate in search of more,--applies at  the same time the lash to drive and the leash to hold, for these  highlanders soon die when they reach the plains.[52] Here are two  antagonistic geographic influences at work from the same environment,  one physical and the other social-economic. The Ladaki have reached an  interesting resolution of these two forces by the institution of  polyandry, which keeps population practically stationary.    [Sidenote: Pigmentation and climate.]    The relation of pigmentation to climate has long interested geographers  as a question of environment; but their speculations on the subject have  been barren, because the preliminary investigations of the physiologist,  physicist and chemist are still incomplete. The general fact of  increasing nigrescence from temperate towards equatorial regions is  conspicuous enough, despite some irregularity of the shading.[53] This  fact points strongly to some direct relation between climate and  pigmentation, but gives no hint how the pigmental processes are  affected. The physiologist finds that in the case of the negro, the dark  skin is associated with a dense cuticle, diminished perspiration,  smaller chests and less respiratory power, a lower temperature and more  rapid pulse,[54] all which variations may enter into the problem of the  negroes coloring. The question is therefore by no means simple.    Yet it is generally conceded by scientists that pigment is a protective  device of nature. The negro's skin is comparatively insensitive to a sun  heat that blisters a white man. Livingstone found the bodies of albino  negroes in Bechuana Land always blistered on exposure to the sun,[55]  and a like effect has been observed among albino Polynesians, and  Melanesians of Fiji.[56] Paul Ehrenreich finds that the degree of  coloration depends less upon annual temperature than upon the direct  effect of the sun's rays; and that therefore a people dwelling in a  cool, dry climate, but exposed to the sun may be"]]]
