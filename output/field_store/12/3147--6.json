[Illustration: \"In a small boat filled with some of his trusty men, he  rowed quietly into the port.\"--p. 77.]    Roc was very successful, in his enterprises, and took a great deal of  valuable merchandise to Jamaica, but although he and his crew were  always rich men when they went on shore, they did not remain in that  condition very long. The buccaneers of that day were all very  extravagant, and, moreover, they were great gamblers, and it was not  uncommon for them to lose everything they possessed before they had been  on shore a week. Then there was nothing for them to do but to go on  board their vessels and put out to sea in search of some fresh prize. So  far Roc's career had been very much like that of many other Companions  of the Coast, differing from them only in respect to intensity and  force, but he was a clever man with ideas, and was able to adapt himself  to circumstances.    He was cruising about Campeachy without seeing any craft that was worth  capturing, when he thought that it would be very well for him to go out  on a sort of marine scouting expedition and find out whether or not  there were any Spanish vessels in the bay which were well laden and  which were likely soon to come out. So, with a small boat filled with  some of his trusty men, he rowed quietly into the port to see what he  could discover. If he had had Esquemeling with him, and had sent that  mild-mannered observer into the harbor to investigate into the state of  affairs, and come back with a report, it would have been a great deal  better for the pirate captain, but he chose to go himself, and he came  to grief. No sooner did the people on the ships lying in the harbor  behold a boat approaching with a big-browed, broad-jawed mariner sitting  in the stern, and with a good many more broad-backed, hairy mariners  than were necessary, pulling at the oars, than they gave the alarm. The  well-known pirate was recognized, and it was not long before he was  captured. Roc must have had a great deal of confidence in his own  powers, or perhaps he relied somewhat upon the fear which his very  presence evoked. But he made a mistake this time; he had run into the  lion's jaw, and the lion had closed his teeth upon him.    When the pirate captain and his companions were brought before the  Governor, he made no pretence of putting them to trial. Buccaneers were  outlawed by the Spanish, and were considered as wild beasts to be killed  without mercy wherever caught. Consequently Roc and his men were thrown  into a dungeon and condemned to be executed. If, however, the Spanish  Governor had known what was good for himself, he would have had them  killed that night.    During the time that preparations were going on for making examples of  these impertinent pirates, who had dared to enter the port of Campeachy,  Roc was racking his brains to find some method of getting out of the  terrible scrape into which he had fallen. This was a branch of the  business in which a capable pirate was obliged to be proficient; if he  could not get himself out of scrapes, he could not expect to be  successful. In this case there was no chance of cutting down sentinels,  or jumping overboard with a couple of wine-jars for a life-preserver, or  of doing any of those ordinary things which pirates were in the habit of  doing when escaping from their captors. Roc and his men were in a  dungeon on land, inside of a fortress, and if they escaped from this,  they would find themselves unarmed in the midst of a body of Spanish  soldiers. Their stout arms and their stout hearts were of no use to them  now, and they were obliged to depend upon their wits if they had any.  Roc had plenty of wit, and he used it well. There was a slave, probably  not a negro nor a native, but most likely some European who had been  made prisoner, who came in to bring him food and drink, and by the means  of this man the pirate hoped to play a trick upon the Governor. He  promised the slave that if he would help him,--and he told him it would  be very easy to do so,--he would give him money enough to buy his  freedom and to return to his friends, and this, of course, was a great  inducement to the poor fellow, who may have been an Englishman or a  Frenchman in good circumstances at home. The slave agreed to the  proposals, and the first thing he did was to bring some  writing-materials to Roc, who thereupon began the composition of a  letter upon which he based all his hopes of life and freedom.    When he was coming into the bay, Roc had noticed a large French vessel  that was lying at some distance from the town, and he wrote his letter  as if it had come from the captain of this ship. In the character of  this French captain he addressed his letter to the Governor of the town,  and in it he stated that he had understood that certain Companions of  the Coast, for whom he had great sympathy,--for the French and the  buccaneers were always good friends,--had been captured by the Governor,  who, he heard, had threatened to execute them. Then the French captain,  by the hand of Roc, went on to say that if any harm should come to these  brave men, who had been taken and imprisoned when they were doing no  harm to anybody, he would swear, in his most solemn manner, that never,  for the rest of his life, would he give quarter to any Spaniard who  might fall into his hands, and he, moreover, threatened that any kind of  vengeance which should become possible for the buccaneers and French  united, to inflict upon the Spanish ships, or upon the town of  Campeachy, should be taken as soon as possible after he should hear of  any injury that might be inflicted upon the unfortunate men who were  then lying imprisoned in the fortress.    When the slave came back to Roc, the letter was given to him with very  particular directions as to what he was to do with it. He was to  disguise himself as much as possible, so that he should not be  recognized by the people of the place, and then in the night he was to  make his way out of the town, and early in the morning he was to return  as if he had been walking along the shore of the harbor, when he was to  state that he had been put on shore from the French vessel in the  offing, with a letter which he was to present to the Governor.    The slave performed his part of the business very well. The next day,  wet and bedraggled, from making his way through the weeds and mud of the  coast, he presented himself at the fortress with his letter, and when he  was allowed to take it to the Governor, no one suspected that he was a  person employed about the place. Having fulfilled his mission, he  departed, and when seen again he was the same servant whose business it  was to carry food to the prisoners.    The Governor read the letter with a disquieted mind; he knew that the  French ship which was lying outside the harbor was a powerful vessel and  he did not like French ships, anyway. The town had once been taken and  very badly treated by a little fleet of French and English buccaneers,  and he was very anxious that nothing of the kind should happen again.  There was no great Spanish force in the harbor at that time, and he did  not know how many buccaneering vessels might be able to gather together  in the bay if it should become known that the great pirate Roc had been  put to death in Campeachy. It was an unusual thing for a prisoner to  have such powerful friends so near by, and the Governor took Roc's case  into most earnest consideration. A few hours' reflection was sufficient  to convince him that it would be very unsafe to tamper with such a  dangerous prize as the pirate Roc, and he determined to get rid of him  as soon as possible. He felt himself in the position of a man who has  stolen a baby-bear, and who hears the roar of an approaching parent  through the woods; to throw away the cub and walk off as though he had  no idea there were any bears in that forest would be the inclination of  a man so situated, and to get rid of the great pirate without provoking  the vengeance of his friends was the natural inclination of the  Governor.    Now Roc and his men were treated well, and having been brought before  the Governor, were told that in consequence of their having committed no  overt act of disorder they would be set at liberty and shipped to  England, upon the single condition that they would abandon piracy and  agree to become quiet citizens in whatever respectable vocation they  might select.    To these terms Roc and his men agreed without argument. They declared  that they would retire from the buccaneering business, and that nothing  would suit them better than to return to the ways of civilization and  virtue. There was a ship about to depart for Spain, and on this the  Governor gave Roc and his men free passage to the other side of the  ocean. There is no doubt that our buccaneers would have much preferred  to have been put on board the French vessel; but as the Spanish Governor  had started his prisoners on the road to reform, he did not wish to  throw them into the way of temptation by allowing them to associate with  such wicked companions as Frenchmen, and Roc made no suggestion of the  kind, knowing very well how greatly astonished the French captain would  be if the Governor were to communicate with him on the subject.    On the voyage to Spain Roc was on his good behavior, and he was a man  who knew how to behave very well when it was absolutely necessary: no  doubt there must have been many dull days on board ship when he would  have been delighted to gamble, to get drunk, and to run \"amuck\" up and  down the deck. But he carefully abstained from all these recreations,  and showed himself to be such an able-bodied and willing sailor that the  captain allowed him to serve as one of the crew. Roc knew how to do a  great many things; not only could he murder and rob, but he knew how to  turn an honest penny"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/172"],[0,"The Haunted Bookshop (#11)"],[1,"when I am  reading Dickens I get a vision of rare sirloin with floury boiled  potatoes and plenty of horse-radish, set on a shining cloth not far  from a blaze of English coal----\"    \"He's an incorrigible visionary,\" said Mrs. Mifflin.  \"To hear him talk  you might think no one had had a square meal since Dickens died.  You  might think that all landladies died with Mrs. Lirriper.\"    \"Very ungrateful of him,\" said Titania.  \"I'm sure I couldn't ask for  better potatoes, or a nicer hostess, than I've found in Brooklyn.\"    \"Well, well,\" said Roger.  \"You are right, of course.  And yet  something went out of the world when Victorian England vanished,  something that will never come again.  Take the stagecoach drivers, for  instance.  What a racy, human type they were!  And what have we now to  compare with them?  Subway guards?  Taxicab drivers?  I have hung  around many an all-night lunchroom to hear the chauffeurs talk.  But  they are too much on the move, you can't get the picture of them the  way Dickens could of his types.  You can't catch that sort of thing in  a snapshot, you know:  you have to have a time exposure.  I'll grant  you, though, that lunchroom food is mighty good.  The best place to eat  is always a counter where the chauffeurs congregate.  They get awfully  hungry, you see, driving round in the cold, and when they want food  they want it hot and tasty.  There's a little hash-alley called  Frank's, up on Broadway near 77th, where I guess the ham and eggs and  French fried is as good as any Mr. Pickwick ever ate.\"    \"I must get Edwards to take me there,\" said Titania.  \"Edwards is our  chauffeur.  I've been to the Ansonia for tea, that's near there.\"    \"Better keep away,\" said Helen.  \"When Roger comes home from those  places he smells so strong of onions it brings tears to my eyes.\"    \"We've just been talking about an assistant chef,\" said Roger; \"that  suggests that I read you Somebody's Luggage, which is all about a head  waiter.  I have often wished I could get a job as a waiter or a bus  boy, just to learn if there really are any such head waiters nowadays.  You know there are all sorts of jobs I'd like to have, just to fructify  my knowledge of human nature and find out whether life is really as  good as literature.  I'd love to be a waiter, a barber, a  floorwalker----\"    \"Roger, my dear,\" said Helen, \"why don't you get on with the reading?\"    Roger knocked out his pipe, turned Bock out of his chair, and sat down  with infinite relish to read the memorable character sketch of  Christopher, the head waiter, which is dear to every lover of taverns.  \"The writer of these humble lines being a Waiter,\" he began.  The  knitting needles flashed with diligence, and the dog by the fender  stretched himself out in the luxuriant vacancy of mind only known to  dogs surrounded by a happy group of their friends.  And Roger, enjoying  himself enormously, and particularly pleased by the chuckles of his  audience, was approaching the ever-delightful items of the coffee-room  bill which is to be found about ten pages on in the first chapter--how  sad it is that hotel bills are not so rendered in these times--when the  bell in the shop clanged.  Picking up his pipe and matchbox, and  grumbling \"It's always the way,\" he hurried out of the room.    He was agreeably surprised to find that his caller was the young  advertising man, Aubrey Gilbert.    \"Hullo!\" he said.  \"I've been saving something for you.  It's a  quotation from Joseph Conrad about advertising.\"    \"Good enough,\" said Aubrey.  \"And I've got something for you.  You were  so nice to me the other evening I took the liberty of bringing you  round some tobacco.  Here's a tin of Blue-Eyed Mixture, it's my  favourite.  I hope you'll like it.\"    \"Bully for you.  Perhaps I ought to let you off the Conrad quotation  since you're so kind.\"    \"Not a bit.  I suppose it's a knock.  Shoot!\"  The bookseller led the  way back to his desk, where he rummaged among the litter and finally  found a scrap of paper on which he had written:      Being myself animated by feelings of affection toward my fellowmen, I  am saddened by the modern system of advertising.  Whatever evidence it  offers of enterprise, ingenuity, impudence, and resource in certain  individuals, it proves to my mind the wide prevalence of that form of  mental degradation which is called gullibility.                                               JOSEPH CONRAD.      \"What do you think of that?\" said Roger.  \"You'll find that in the  story called The Anarchist.\"    \"I think less than nothing of it,\" said Aubrey.  \"As your friend Don  Marquis observed the other evening, an idea isn't always to be blamed  for the people who believe in it.  Mr. Conrad has been reading some  quack ads, that's all.  Because there are fake ads, that doesn't  condemn the principle of Publicity.  But look here, what I really came  round to see you for is to show you this.  It was in the Times this  morning.\"    He pulled out of his pocket a clipping of the LOST insertion to which  Roger's attention had already been drawn.    \"Yes, I've just seen it,\" said Roger.  \"I missed the book from my  shelves, and I believe someone must have stolen it.\"    \"Well, now, I want to tell you something,\" said Aubrey.  \"To-night I  had dinner at the Octagon with Mr. Chapman.\"  \"Is that so?\" said Roger.  \"You know his daughter's here now.\"    \"So he told me.  It's rather interesting how it all works out.  You  see, after you told me the other day that Miss Chapman was coming to  work for you, that gave me an idea.  I knew her father would be  specially interested in Brooklyn, on that account, and it suggested to  me an idea for a window-display campaign here in Brooklyn for the  Daintybits Products.  You know we handle all his sales promotion  campaigns.  Of course I didn't let on that I knew about his daughter  coming over here, but he told me about it himself in the course of our  talk.  Well, here's what I'm getting at.  We had dinner in the  Czecho-Slovak Grill, up on the fourteenth floor, and going up in the  elevator I saw a man in a chef's uniform carrying a book.  I looked  over his shoulder to see what it was.  I thought of course it would be  a cook-book.  It was a copy of Oliver Cromwell.\"    \"So he found it again, eh?  I must go and have a talk with that chap.  If he's a Carlyle fan I'd like to know him.\"    \"Wait a minute.  I had seen the LOST ad in the paper this morning,  because I always look over that column.  Often it gives me ideas for  advertising stunts.  If you keep an eye on the things people are  anxious to get back, you know what they really prize, and if you know  what they prize you can get a line on what goods ought to be advertised  more extensively.  This was the first time I had ever noticed a LOST ad  for a book, so I thought to myself \"the book business is coming up.\"  Well, when I saw the chef with the book in his hand, I said to him  jokingly, \"I see you found it again.\" He was a foreign-looking fellow,  with a big beard, which is unusual for a chef, because I suppose it's  likely to get in the soup.  He looked at me as though I'd run a carving  knife into him, almost scared me the way he looked.  \"Yes, yes,\" he  said, and shoved the book out of sight under his arm.  He seemed half  angry and half frightened, so I thought maybe he had no right to be  riding in the passenger elevator and was scared someone would report  him to the manager.  Just as we were getting to the fourteenth floor I  said to him in a whisper, \"It's all right, old chap, I'm not going to  report you.\" I give you my word he looked more scared than before.  He  went quite white.  I got off at the fourteenth, and he followed me out.  I thought he was going to speak to me, but Mr. Chapman was there in the  lobby, and he didn't have a chance.  But I noticed that he watched me  into the grill room as though I was his last chance of salvation.\"    \"I guess the poor devil was scared you'd report him to the police for  stealing the book,\" said Roger.  \"Never mind, let him have it.\"    \"Did he steal it?\"    \"I haven't a notion.  But somebody did, because it disappeared from  here.\"    \"Well, now, wait a minute.  Here's the queer part of it.  I didn't  think anything more about it, except that it was a funny coincidence my  seeing him after having noticed that ad in the paper.  I had a long  talk with Mr. Chapman, and we discussed some plans for a prune and  Saratoga chip campaign, and I showed him some suggested copy I had  prepared.  Then he told me about his daughter, and I let on that I knew  you.  I left the Octagon about eight o'clock, and I thought I'd run  over here on the subway just to show you the LOST notice and give you  this tobacco.  And when I got off the subway at Atlantic Avenue, who  should I see but friend chef again.  He got off the same train I did.  He had on civilian clothes then, of course, and when he was out of his  white uniform and pancake hat I recognized him right off.  Who do you  suppose it was?\"    \"Can't imagine,\" said Roger, highly interested by this time.    \"Why, the professor-looking guy who came in to ask for the book the  first night I was here.\"    \"Humph!  Well, he must be keen about Carlyle, because he was horribly  disappointed that evening when he asked for the book and I couldn't  find it.  I remember how he insisted that I MUST have it, and I hunted  all through the History shelves to make sure it hadn't got misplaced.  He said that some friend of his had seen it here, and he had come right  round to buy it.  I told him he could certainly get a copy at the  Public Library, and he said that wouldn't do at all.\"    \"Well, I think he's nuts,\" said Aubrey, \"because I'm damn sure he  followed me down the street after I left the subway.  I stopped in at  the drug store on the corner to get some matches, and when I came out,  there he was underneath the lamp-post.\"    \"If it was a modern author,"]]]
