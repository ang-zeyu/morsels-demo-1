CHAPTER VII    PUPAE AND THEIR MODIFICATIONS      The pupal stage is characteristic of the life-story of those insects  whose larvae have wing-rudiments in the form of inpushed imaginal discs,  and in all these insects there is, as we have seen, considerable  divergence in form between larva and imago. In the pupa the wings and  other characteristically adult structures are, for the first time,  visible outwardly; it is the instar which marks the great crisis in  transformation. The pupa rests, as a rule, in a quiescent condition, and  during the early period of this stage the needful internal changes, the  breaking down of many larval tissues, and their replacement by imaginal  organs, go on. Both outwardly and inwardly therefore, the insect  undergoes, at the pupal stage, a reconstruction necessitated by the  differences in form and often in habit, between the larva and the winged  adult; and the greater these differences, the more profound must be the  changes that mark the pupal stage.    From the prominence of imaginal structures in the pupa, it is at once  seen that the pupa of any insect must resemble the adult more nearly  than it resembles the larva. But in different groups of insects we find  different degrees of likeness between pupa and imago. In a beetle pupa  (see fig. 16 _c_), the appendages--feelers, jaws, legs, wings--stand out  from the body as do those of the perfect insect. This type is called a  _free_ pupa. The pupal cuticle has to be shed for the emergence of the  imago, but the pupa is already a somewhat reduced model of the final  instar, with abbreviated wings and doubled-up legs. A free pupa is  characteristic of the Coleoptera, Neuroptera, Trichoptera, Hymenoptera  and many Diptera. In some cases the pupa requires to be specially  adapted for a peculiar mode of life; for example, a special arrangement  of breathing organs may be necessary for life under water, and there  must needs be temporary pupal structures, not represented in the imago.    On the other hand, in the pupae of most Lepidoptera and of some Diptera,  there is more or less coalescence between the cuticle of the appendages  and the cuticle of the body generally, so that the appendages do not  stand out, but being, as it were, glued down to the body, are somewhat  masked (see fig. 1 _e_ and fig. 23). Consequently the _obtect_ pupa, as  this type is called, does not resemble its imago as fully as a free pupa  does. The outline of the wings for example in a butterfly's pupa can in  some cases be traced only with difficulty. T.A. Chapman has shown (1893)  that the completely obtect pupa characterises the more highly developed  families of Lepidoptera, while in the more primitive families the pupa  is incompletely obtect. If the pupa of a butterfly or moth be lifted and  held in the hand, a bending or wriggling motion of the abdomen can be  observed. In the incompletely obtect pupa, this motion is evident in a  greater number of segments than in the completely obtect, the number  concerned varying from five to two in different families. In the  nymphalid butterflies, the pupa is often called a 'chrysalis' on  account of the golden hue displayed by the cuticle, and the term  'chrysalis' is sometimes bestowed indiscriminately on any kind of pupa.  It has been shown by Poulton (1892) and others, that the colour of a  butterfly pupa is to some extent affected by the surroundings of the  caterpillar just before its last moult.    Reference has been made (p. 58) to the power of spinning silk possessed  by many larvae; often the principal use of this silk is to form some  protection for the pupa, the larva before its last moult constructing a  _cocoon_ within which the pupa may rest safely. Many larvae bury  themselves in the earth, and the pupa lies in an earthen chamber, the  lining particles of soil fastened together by fine silken threads.  Larvae that feed in wood, like the caterpillar of the Goat-moth (Cossus)  make a cocoon of splinters spun together, while hairy caterpillars, such  as those of the Tiger-moths, work some of their hairs in with the silk  to make a firm cocoon (fig. 17 _b_). On the other hand, those  caterpillars known as 'silkworms' make a dense cocoon of pure silk,  consisting of two layers, the outer of coarse and the inner of fine  threads. Silken cocoons very similar in appearance are spun by the  larvae of small Ichneumon-flies. Many pupae lie in a loose cocoon formed  of a few interlacing threads, as for example the conspicuous black and  yellow banded pupa of the Magpie-moth (_Abraxas grossulariata_) and the  pupae of various leaf-beetles. Others again spin together the edges of  leaves with connecting silken threads. The grubs of bees and wasps which  are reared in the comb-chambers of their nests seal up the opening of  the chamber with a lid, partly silk (fig. 18 _co_) and partly excretion,  when ready to pass into the pupal state. An additional external  'capping' may be also supplied by the workers.    The pupae of butterflies are especially interesting, as illustrating the  extreme reduction of the silken cocoon. The pupa of a 'swallowtail'  (Papilionid) or a 'white' (Pierid) butterfly (fig. 23) may be found  attached to a twig of its food-plant or to a wall, in an upright  position, its tail fastened to a pad of silk and a slender silken girdle  encircling its thorax. The pupa of a 'Tortoiseshell' or 'Admiral'  (Nymphalid) butterfly hangs head downwards from a twig, supported only  by the tail-pad of silk, which, useless as a shelter, serves only for  attachment. The pupa is fastened to this pad by a spiny hook or process,  the _cremaster_ (fig. 23 _cr_), on the last abdominal segment. The  cremaster is a characteristic structure in the pupa of a moth or  butterfly. C.V. Riley (1880) and W. Hatchett-Jackson (1890) have shown  that it corresponds with a spiny area, the suranal plate, which lies  above the opening of the caterpillar's intestine. The means by which the  suspended pupa of a nymphalid butterfly attaches its cremaster to the  silken pad which the larva has spun in preparation for pupation, is  worthy of brief attention. The caterpillar, hanging head downwards, is  attached to the silken pad by its hindmost pair of pro-legs or claspers  and by the suranal plate, and the cuticle is slowly worked off from  before backwards, so as to expose the pupa. Were the process of moulting  to be simply completed while the insect hangs by the claspers, the pupa  would of course fall to the ground. But there is enough adhesion between  the pupal and larval cuticles at the hinder end of the body, especially  by means of the everted lining of the hind-gut, for the pupa to be  supported while it jerks its cremaster out of the larval cuticle and  works it into the meshes of the silken pad. The moult is thus completed  and the pupa hangs securely all the time. In the numerous cases where  the pupa is enclosed in a cocoon, the cremaster serves to fix the pupa  to the surrounding silk. Chapman (1893) has drawn attention to the fact  that among the more highly organised moths the pupa remains in the  cocoon, the emergence being entirely left to the imago, while the pupae  of the more primitive moths work their way partly out of the cocoon  before the final moult begins. In the latter case, the cremaster is  anchored by a strand of silk which allows a certain degree of emergence,  and the pupa has rows of spines on its abdominal segments, of which a  greater number retain the power of mutual motion than in those pupae  which do not come out of their cocoons.

In part after Hatchett-Jackson, _Trans.  Linn. Soc._ 1900, and Tutt's _British Butterflies_.]    While the pupa on the whole resembles the imago that is to emerge from  it, there are not a few cases in which a special structure necessary for  some contingency in pupal life is retained or adopted in this stage. A  butterfly pupa, like the imago, has no mandibles, but in the case of the  Caddis-flies (Trichoptera) and two families of small moths, the most  primitive of all Lepidoptera, the pupa, like the larva, has  well-developed mandibles. These enable the caddis pupa to bite its way  out of the shortened larval case in which it has pupated, and then to  swim upwards through the water ready for the caddis-fly's emergence into  the air. Pupae that are submerged require special breathing-organs. In  the previous chapter (p. 77) mention was made of the gnat's aquatic  larva with its tail-spiracles adapted for procuring atmospheric air  through the surface-film. The pupa of the gnat[10] also has 'respiratory  trumpets' serving the same purpose, but these are a pair of processes on  the prothorax, so that the pupa, which is fairly active, hangs from the  surface-film with its abdomen pointing downwards through the water. This  change of position is correlated with the necessity for the imago to  emerge into the air; were the pupa to hang head downwards as the larva  does, the gnat would perforce have to dive into the water. With the  beautifully adapted transfer of the functional spiracles, their position  is appropriately arranged for the gnat's emergence at the surface, and  the empty pupal cuticle floats serving the insect as a raft. On this it  rests securely and the crumpled wings have opportunity to expand and  harden before the insect takes to flight.    [10] See _Frontispiece_, B.    The aquatic pupae of other Diptera, many species of the midges  Chironomus and Simulium for example, breathe dissolved air by means of  tufts of thread-like gills, which arise on either side of the prothorax.  The pupae of Simulium rest in their curious little cup-like dwellings,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16435"],[0,"The Atlantic Book of Modern Plays (#11)"],[1,"stronger than all that.    HILDA. So we mustn't blame him. You won't blame him?    WHITE. He fears I will?    HILDA. He has always feared you a little, though he loves you  deeply. You mustn't oppose him, dear. You won't?    WHITE (_wearily_). Is there any use opposing anybody or anything  these days?    HILDA. We must wait till the storm passes.    WHITE. That's never been my way.    HILDA. No. You've fought all your life. But now we must sit  silent together and wait; wait for our boy to come back. Will,  think of it; we are going to have a boy \"over there,\" too.    WHITE. Hilda, hasn't it ever struck you that we may have been all  wrong? (_She looks at him, as she holds his hand._) What could  these frail hands do? How could we poor little King Canutes halt  this tide that has swept over the world? Isn't it better, after  all, that men should fight themselves out; bring such desolation  upon themselves that they will be forced to see the futility of  war? May it not become so terrible that men--the workers, I  mean--will throw down their worn-out weapons of their own accord?  Won't permanent peace come through bitter experience rather than  talk--talk--talk?    HILDA (_touching the torn pages of his speech and smiling_). Here  is your answer to your own question.    WHITE. Oh, that was all theory. We're in now. You say yourself we  can't oppose it. Isn't it better if we try to direct the current  to our own ends rather than sink by trying to swim against it?    HILDA. Oh, yes; it would be easier for one who _could_  compromise.    WHITE. But haven't we radicals been too intolerant of compromise?    HILDA. That has been _your_ strength. And it is your  strength I'm relying on now that Wallace--Shall I call him?    WHITE (_significantly_). No; wait.    HILDA (_apprehensive at his turn_). Oh, yes. Before he came you  said there was something--(_The phone rings. They both look at  it._) That's for you.    WHITE (_not moving_). Yes.    HILDA _hardly believing his attititde_). Is--is it private?    WHITE. No. Perhaps it will be easier this way. (_He hesitates,  then goes to phone as she stands expectant._) Yes. Yes. Long  Distance? Washington? (_Her lips repeat the word._) Yes. This is  William White. Hello. Yes. Is this the Secretary speaking? Oh, I  appreciate the honor of having you confirm it personally. Senator  Bough is chairman? At his request? Ah, yes; war makes strange  bedfellows. Yes. The passport and credentials? Oh, I'll be ready.  Yes. Good-bye.    (_He hangs up the receiver and looks at her._)    HILDA. You, too!    WHITE. I've been trying to tell you these last weeks; but I  couldn't somehow.    HILDA. You were ashamed?    WHITE. No, dear; only I knew it would hurt you.    HILDA. I'm not thinking of myself but of you. You are going to be  part of this war?    WHITE. I'm going to do what I can to help finish it.    HILDA. By compromising with the beliefs of a lifetime?    WHITE. No, dear; not that. I've accepted the appointment on this  commission because I'm going to accept facts.    HILDA. Have the facts of war changed, or is it you?    WHITE. Neither has changed; but I'm going to act differently. I'm  going to be part of it. Yes. I'm going to help direct the  current.    HILDA. I can't believe what I am hearing. Is it you, William  White, speaking? You who, for twenty years, have stood against  all war!    WHITE. Yes.    HILDA. And now, when the test comes, you are going to lend  yourself to it! You of all men!    WHITE. Hilda, dear; I didn't expect you to accept it easily; but  I think I can make you see if you will let me.    HILDA (_poignantly_). If I will let you! Why, Will, I must  understand; I must.    WHITE. Perhaps it will be difficult at first--with your  standards.    HILDA. But my standards were yours, Will. You gave them to me.  You taught me. You took a young girl who loved you. You showed  her the truth, and she followed you and has followed you gladly  through hard years of struggle and poverty because of those  ideals. And now you talk of my standards! Will, don't you see, I  must understand?    WHITE. Dear, standards are relative things; they differ with  circumstance.    HILDA. Have your ideals only been old clothes you change to suit  the weather?    WHITE. It's the end we must keep in mind. I haven't changed or  compromised one bit in that. I'm working in changed conditions,  that's all; working with all my heart to do away with all war.    HILDA. By fighting one?    WHITE (_with eloquence_). Yes. Because it is necessary. I've come  to see we can't argue war out of the world with words. We've got  to beat it out of the world. It can't be done with our hands  lifted up in prayer; it can only be done with iron hands crushing  it down. War is the mood of the world. Well, I'm going to fight  in my fashion. And when it is over, I'm going to keep on  fighting; for the next war will be greater than this. It will be  economic revolution. It will be the war of capital and labor. And  I mean to be ready.    HILDA (_listening incredulously_). And to get ready you are willing  to link arms now with Senator Bough--a man you once called the  lackey of Wall Street--a man who has always opposed every  democratic principle.    WHITE. Yes. Don't you see the Government is beginning to realize  it can't do without us? Don't you see my appointment is an  acknowledgment of the rising tide of radicalism in the world?  Don't you see, with the prestige that will come to me from this  appointment, I will have greater power after the war; power to  bring about the realization of all our dreams; power to  demand--even at the Peace table itself, perhaps--that all wars  must end?    HILDA. Do you actually believe you will have any power with your  _own_ people when you have compromised them for a temporary  expediency?    WHITE (_with a gesture_). The leader must be wiser than the people  who follow.    HILDA. So, contempt for your people is the first thing your new  power has brought you! (_He makes a gesture of denial._) You feel  you are above them--not of them. Do you believe for a moment that  Senator Bough has anything but contempt for you, too?    WHITE (_confidently_). He needs me.    HILDA. Needs you? Don't you understand why he had you appointed  on that committee? He wanted to get you out of the way.    WHITE. Isn't that an acknowledgment of my power?    HILDA. Yes. You're a great asset now. You're a \"reformed\"  radical. Why, Will, he'll use you in the capitals of Europe to  advertise his liberalism; just as the prohibitionist exhibits a  reformed drunkard.    WHITE. And I tell you, Hilda, after the war I shall be stronger  than he is, stronger than any of them.    HILDA. No man is strong unless he does what he feels is right.  No, no, Will; you've convicted yourself with your own eloquence.  You've wanted to do this for some reason. But it isn't the one  you've told me. No; no.    WHITE (_angrily_). You doubt my sincerity?    HILDA. No; only the way you have read yourself.    WHITE. Well, if you think I've tried to make it easy for myself  you are mistaken. Is it easy to pull out of the rut and habit of  years? Easy to know my friends will jeer and say I've sold out?  Easy to have you misunderstand? (_Goes to her._) Hilda, I'm doing  this for their good. I'm doing it--just as Wallace is--because I  feel it's right.    HILDA. No; you shouldn't say that. You are not doing this for the  same reason Wallace is. He believes in this war. He has accepted  it all simply without a question. If you had seen the look in his  eyes, you would have known he was a dedicated spirit; there was  no shadow, no doubt; it was pure flame. But you! You believe  differently! You can't hush the mind that for twenty years has  thought no war ever could henceforth be justified. You can't give  yourself to this war without tricking yourself with phrases. You  see power in it and profit for yourself. (_He protests._) That's  your own confession. You are only doing what is expedient--not  what is right. Oh, Will, don't compare your motives with those of  our son. I sent him forth, without a word of protest, because he  wishes to die for his own ideals: you are killing your own ideals  for the ideals of others! (_She turns away._) Oh, Will, that's what  hurts. If you were only like him, I--I could stand it.    WHITE (_quietly, after a pause_). I can't be angry at you--even  when you say such things. You've been too much a part of my life,  and work, and I love you, Hilda. You know that, don't you, dear?  (_He sits beside her and takes her hand._) I knew it would be  difficult to make you understand. Only once have I lacked  courage, and that was when I felt myself being drawn into this  and they offered me the appointment. For then I saw I must tell  you. You know I never have wanted to cause you pain. But when you  asked me to let Wallace go, I thought you would understand my  going, too.--Oh, perhaps our motives are different; he is young;  war has caught his imagination; but, I, too, see a duty, a way to  accomplish my ideals.    HILDA. Let's leave ideals out of this now. It's like bitter  enemies praying to the same God as they kill each other.    WHITE. Yes. War is full of ironies. I see that: Wallace can't.  It's so full of mixed motives, good and bad. Yes. I'll grant all  that. Only, America has gone in. The whole tide was against us,  dear. It is sweeping over the world: a brown tide of khaki  sweeping everything before it. All my life I've fought against  the current. (_Wearily_) And now that I've gone in, too, my arms  seem less tired. Yes; and except for the pain I've caused you,  I've never in all my life felt so--so happy.    (_Then she understands. She slowly turns to him, with tenderness  in her eyes._)    HILDA. Oh, now, Will, I do understand. Now I see the real reason  for what you've done.    WHITE (_defensively_). I've given the real reason.    HILDA (_her heart going out to him_). You poor tired man."]]]
