Counting up the vote for captains took longer than that for major, but  soon the captain had his statement ready and the cadets listened in  silence as he proceeded to make his announcement:    \"Whole number of votes cast, 288.    \"Richard Rover has 82.    \"Fred Garrison has 67.    \"Mark Romer has 59.    \"The next highest student has 28.    \"Richard Rover is elected captain of Company A, Frederick Garrison  captain of Company B, and Mark Romer captain of Company C, for this  term and during the annual encampment.\"    \"Hurrah for Dick Rover!\"    \"Hurrah for Fred Garrison and Mark Romer!\"    And then the students cheered as wildly as ever, while Captain Putnam  once more offered his congratulations.    \"Captain Rover, my hand,\" said Larry, coming up.    \"Thank you, Major Colby,\" answered Dick, and then both gave a grip that  meant a good deal.    \"We seem to be right in it,\" observed the newly elected major.    \"That's true,\" answered Dick.    \"We shall now proceed to the election of six lieutenants,\" went on  Captain Putnam, and once more the slips went the rounds, and the boys  did a lot of writing and speculating as each put down the six names  required.    This vote was rather a long one, and Captain Putnam had two teachers  help him in tabulating the result.    \"This contest must make Flapp feel sick,\" whispered Powell to Dick,  while the students were taking it easy on the parade ground.    \"Well, he brought it on himself,\" was the brief reply.    \"I'll wager he tries to square up with us, especially if he thinks we  told on him.\"    A bugle sounded, calling the cadets together, and once more Captain  Putnam read the result:    \"Whole number of votes cast, 576.    \"John Powell has 83.    \"William Merrick has 76.    \"Walter Durham has 71.    \"Thomas Rover has 68.    \"George Granbury has 51.    \"Raymond Hollbrook has 43.    \"The next highest cadet has 38.    \"John Powell is declared first lieutenant of Company A, William Merrick  first lieutenant of Company B, Walter Durham first lieutenant of  Company C, Thomas Rover second lieutenant of Company A, George Granbury  second lieutenant of Company B, and Raymond Hollbrook second lieutenant  of Company C, for this term and during the annual encampment.\"    As this announcement was made there was a breathless silence. Then came  a rousing cheer and the various successful ones were congratulated by  the captain and their friends.    \"Well, Songbird, it seems you are to be my first lieutenant,\" said Dick  as he shook hands with Powell. \"That suits me first-rate.\"    \"And I am to be second lieutenant,\" said Tom, coming up. \"With Sam in  the company as private this begins to look like a family affair.\"    \"Oh, I'm going to make you fellows toe the mark now,\" laughed Dick. \"No  more skylarking, if you please, Lieutenant Rover.\"    \"All right, Captain Rover,\" replied Tom, with a stiff salute that was  side-splitting.    Taking it all the way through the election was declared to be a popular  success. Of course some of the defeated candidates were bitterly  disappointed, but they did their best to hide their true feelings.  William Philander Tubbs had declined to vote and Lew Flapp and Gus  Pender had kept entirely out of sight while the voting was going on.  The two cronies took themselves to the gymnasium and there declared  their hatred of Dick Rover.    \"He is responsible for this,\" muttered Flapp, clenching his fists and  grating his teeth. \"But for him I might at this minute be major of the  battalion, or one of the captains. Oh, but won't I square up some day!\"    \"What will you do?\" questioned Pender. \"Remember, I'm just as down on  him as you are.\"    \"I don't know yet, Gus. But I'll do something.\"    \"All right; when you are ready to act, let me know, and I'll help you  all I can,\" answered Gus Pender.          CHAPTER XIII    THE FIGHT AT THE BOATHOUSE      Inside of a week the newly-elected officers felt perfectly at home in  their various positions. Captain Putnam's idea of allowing only such  cadets to be candidates as could fill the positions properly had borne  good fruit, and the battalion was now in better condition than ever  before.    Contrary to general expectations, Larry Colby, as major, proved a  strict disciplinarian when on parade. In the playground he was as  \"chummy\" as ever, but this was cast aside when he buckled on his sword  and took command.    \"This is as it should be,\" was Captain Putnam's comment. \"And it is the  same throughout life: play is play and business is business.\"    As a captain Dick was equally successful and Tom also made a good  second lieutenant. Company A was speedily voted superior to the others,  when drilling and when on the march, and consequently became the flag  bearer for the term.    \"This is splendid!\" said Dick, when the announcement was made. And then  he went at Company A, to make the cadets drill and march better than  ever.    But though the students gave considerable time to military matters,  they were not permitted to neglect their regular studies, and to their  honor be it said that the three Rover boys pitched in with a will.    \"If I can't be an officer I'm going to be a high grade student anyway,\"  said Sam, and kept his word. Books suited him better than did military  glories, and soon he was at the top of his class in almost every branch  of learning.    Many of the cadets were anxious to know where the annual encampment  would be held, but for the time being Captain Putnam declined to  discuss the subject.    \"We will talk about that as soon as lessons are done for the term,\"  said he.    \"I don't believe we'll go to Brierroot Grove again,\" said Powell to  Dick. \"A farmer has built a house up there and is clearing off the land  as fast as he can.\"    \"I wish we could go to some place at a distance,\" returned Dick. \"All  of us know this territory pretty well. I like to visit new localities.\"    \"So do I.\"    During those days the Rover boys received a letter from their father  which proved unusually interesting. Anderson Rover wrote, in part, as  follows:    \"You will be surprised to learn, at this late day, that something had  been heard about Arnold Baxter. A man who knows him fairly well met him  a few nights ago in Owego. The news was telegraphed to me at once, and  the local police were informed, but since that time nothing more has  been seen or heard of the rascal. The man said he was well dressed and  had been stopping at a leading hotel. Evidently he is using what was  stolen.\"    \"In Owego!\" cried Sam. \"Why, that city isn't over fifty miles from  here.\"    \"This is his old stamping ground,\" put in Tom. \"For all we know he may  now be hanging around Ithaca or Cedarville.\"    \"I don't believe he'll come here,\" said Dick. \"He is too well known.\"    \"Oh, if only we could lay hands on him, Dick!\"    \"Wish we could, Tom. But Arnold Baxter knows enough to keep out of our  clutches.\"    \"Wonder if he knows what became of Dan?\"    \"Like as not our story was in all the newspapers, and they mentioned  Dan too.\"    \"If that is so, it's more than likely he thinks we are responsible for  Dan being left behind on the island.\"    \"I'm not going to bother my head about Arnold Baxter,\" put in Sam. \"If  he shows himself I'll have him arrested, that's all.\"    One day after another slipped by and all of the boys continued to study  with a will. Once they received long letters from Dora Stanhope and  Nellie and Grace Laning, and sent long letters in return.    \"Wish the girls were back here,\" said Dick. But this could not be, as  they had decided to remain in California for a while longer, and the  boys had to content themselves by sending the girls keepsakes by which  to be remembered.    On the Friday afternoon preceding the final week of the term Tom and  Sam walked down to the lake, intending to go out in a boat for a short  row.    As they drew close to the boathouse they heard loud talking and then a  cry of pain.    \"Please don't,\" came in the voice of a young cadet. \"Please, please  don't, Flapp!\"    \"But I just will, you little imp!\" came in Lew Flapp's harsh voice.  \"I'll teach you to play the sneak!\"    \"But I--I didn't mean to do anything, really I didn't,\" answered the  other. \"But I felt so sick, and I--\"    \"Oh, I know you, Moss. For two pins I'd break your head for you!\" And  then came the sounds of several blows in quick succession.    \"It's Flapp!\" cried Sam. \"He is beating somebody most shamefully.\"    \"It's little Harry Moss,\" returned Tom, leaping to the front. \"The big  bully! Why can't he take a fellow of his own size?\"    He rushed around the corner of the boathouse and there beheld a scene  that aroused his warmest indignation. Harry Moss was crowded into a  corner and over him stood Lew Flapp, beating him with a heavy boat  chain.    Flapp had just raised the chain for another blow when Tom ran in and  caught his arm.    \"Stop!\" he cried. \"You let Harry Moss alone!\"    Startled at the interruption Lew Flapp turned. When he saw both Tom and  Sam his face fell.    \"What do you want here?\" he asked sulkily.    \"I want you to leave Harry Moss "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15803"],[0,"Crime and Its Causes (#11)"],[1,"g,  then, that what holds good for Surrey is equally valid for the rest of  England, the conclusion is forced upon us that the augmentation of  crime in summer does not arise from an increase of vagrants and others  arrested and convicted under the Vagrancy Acts while in search of work  or pretending to be in search of it. The assumption that such is the  case is quite unwarranted by the facts so far as they are obtainable,  and another explanation must be sought of the greater prevalence of  crime in summer as compared with winter.    An economic cause of an opposite character to vagrancy has by some  been considered as accounting for the facts now under consideration.  In the summer months, work as a rule is more easily procured; people  in consequence have more money to spend; drunkenness becomes more  common, and the high prison population of summer is to be attributed  to drink. That there is a greater consumption of drink when work  becomes more plentiful is a perfectly correct statement which has been  verified over and over again, and it is also equally correct to say  that drinking leads its victims to the police court. But it has to be  remembered that in almost all cases of drunkenness the magistrate  allows the alternative of a fine. A much larger percentage of fines  is paid in summer than in winter, the result being that the increase  of drunkenness in summer does not disproportionally increase the size  of the prison population. In July, 1888, as compared with January,  1889, cases of felony and assault, followed by imprisonment, increased  in the county of Surrey 20 and 28 per cent. respectively, while  drunkenness on the other hand only increased 18 per cent. The reason  of this relatively small increase of imprisonment for drunkenness does  not arise from the fact that there is less drunkenness in proportion  to the other forms of crime; it is owing to the greater facility with  which this offence can be purged by the payment of a fine. It is  more easily purged in this fashion in summer than in winter, because  people have more money in their pockets. Money, in short, acts in two  capacities which neutralise each other; on the one hand it brings more  persons before the magistrates on charges of drunkenness; on the other  hand, it enables more persons to escape with the simple penalty of a  fine. The prison population is, therefore, not unduly swollen in  summer by the undoubted increase in drinking during that season of the  year; drinking has, in fact, less to do with that increase than any  other cause.    The preceding observations on vagrancy and drinking will suffice to  show that as far as these two factors are concerned, the rise of the  prison population in the warm weather cannot be explained on economic  grounds. Are there any social habits which will account for it? Change  of seasons has a notable effect on social habits. In the cold days of  winter, the great mass of the population live as much as possible  within the shelter of their own home; as long as the short days and  the cheerless and dismal weather continue, there is little to tempt  them out of doors and to bring them into contact with each other. But  with the advance of spring this condition of things is changed; the  lengthening days, the milder atmosphere, the more abundant sunshine  offer increased facilities for social intercourse. Crowds of people  are thrown together, quarrelling and disorders arise, which call for  the interference of the police to be followed shortly after by a  sentence of imprisonment. The growth of international intercourse is  said to make for peace; the growth of social intercourse, admirable as  it is in many respects, has the unfortunate drawback of mating for  black eyes and broken heads. Admitting the truth of this serious  indictment against our social instincts, and no one can deny that it  does contain a considerable amount of truth, the fact still remains  that weather is indirectly if not directly the source from which the  increase of crime in summer proceeds. It is the good weather that  multiplies occasions for human intercourse; the multiplication of  these facilities augments the volume of crime; and thus it comes to  pass, that the conduct of society is, at least, indirectly affected by  changes of season and the oscillations of temperature.    But it is also directly affected by these causes, as I shall now  proceed to show. In one of the principal London prisons the average  prison population during the months of June, July and August for the  five years ended August, 1889 was 1,061, and the daily average number  of punishments amounted to 9 and a fraction per thousand. The average  population during the winter months of December, January, February,  for the five years ended February, 1890, was 1009, and the daily  average number of punishments amounted to 7 and a fraction per  thousand. According to these statistics, we have an increase of 2  punishments per day, or 12 per week (omitting Sundays) to every  thousand prisoners in the three summer months as compared with the  three winter months. In other words, there is a greater tendency among  the inmates of prisons to commit offences against prison regulations  in summer than in winter. In what way is this manifest tendency to be  accounted for? If prisoners were free men living under a variety of  conditions, and subject to a host of complex influences, it would be  possible to adduce all sorts of causes for the existence of such a  phenomenon, and it would be by no means a difficult matter to find  plausible arguments in support of each and all of them. But the almost  absolute similarity of conditions under which imprisoned men live  excludes at one stroke an enormous mass of complicating factors, and  reduces the question to its simplest elements. Here are a thousand men  living in the same place under the same rules of discipline, occupied  in the same way, fed on the same materials, with the same amount of  exercise, the same hours of sleep; in fact, with similarity of life  brought almost to the point of absolute identity; no alteration takes  place in these conditions in summer as compared with winter, yet we  find that there are more offences committed by them in the hotter  season than in the colder. In what way, except on the ground of  temperature, is this difference to be explained. The economic and  social factors discussed by us in connection with the increase of  crime do not here come into play. All persons in prison are living  under the same social and economic conditions in hot weather as well  as in cold. The only changes to which they are subjected are cosmical;  cosmical causes are accordingly the only ones which will account  adequately for the facts. Of these cosmical causes, temperature is by  far the most conspicuous, and it may therefore be concluded that the  increase of prison offences in summer is attributable to the greater  heat.    Seeing, then, that temperature produces these effects inside prison  walls, it is only reasonable to infer that it produces similar effects  on the outside world. The larger number of offences against prison  discipline which take place in the hot weather have their counterpart  in the larger number of offences committed against the criminal law  during the same season of the year. The conclusions arrived at with  respect to the action of season are supported by the conclusions  already reached with respect to the action of climate. In fact, both  sets of conclusions support each other; both of them point to the  operation of the same cause.    To any one who may still feel reluctant to admit the intimate relation  between cosmical conditions and crime I would point out that  suicide--a somewhat similar disorder in the social organism--likewise  increases and diminishes under the influences of temperature. \"We  cannot help acknowledging,\" says Dr. Morselli, in his work on  \"Suicide,\" \"that through the whole of Europe the greater number of  suicides happen in the two warm seasons. This regularity in the annual  distribution of suicide is too great to be attributed to chance or to  the human will. As the number of violent deaths can be predicted from  year to year with extreme probability in any particular country, so  can the average of every season also be foreseen; in fact, these  averages are so constant from one period to another as to have almost  the specific character of a given statistical series.\" Professor von  Oettingen in his valuable work, \"Die Moralstatistik,\" comes to the  very same conclusions as Morselli, although his point of view is  entirely different. After mentioning several of the principal States  of Europe, the statistics of which he had examined, Von Oettingen goes  on to say that it may be accepted as a general law that the prevalence  of suicide in the different months of the year rises and falls with  the sun--in June and July it is most rampant; in November, December  and January it descends to a minimum. In London there are many more  suicides in the sunny month of June than in the gloomy month of  November, and throughout the whole of England the cold months do not  demand nearly so many victims as the hot. In the face of these  indisputable facts Von Oettingen, while rejecting the idea that there  is any inexorable fatality, as Buckle believed, connected with their  recurrence, is obliged to admit that the hot weather exercises a  propelling influence on suicidal tendencies, and that the cold weather  on the other hand acts in an opposite direction[18].
