That served for a sheet.    Zebbie was beside himself with joy. The hounds sprang upon him and  expressed their joy unmistakably. He went at once to the corrals to see  the \"critters,\" and every one of them was safely penned for the night.  \"Old Sime,\" an old ram (goodness knows _how_ old!), promptly butted him  over, but he just beamed with pleasure. \"Sime knows me, dinged if he  don't!\" was his happy exclamation. We went into the cabin and left him  fondling the \"critters.\"    Gavotte did himself proud getting supper. We had trout and the most  delicious biscuit. Each of us had a crisp, tender head of lettuce with  a spoonful of potato salad in the center. We had preserves made from  canned peaches, and the firmest yellow butter. Soon it was quite dark  and we had a tiny brass lamp which gave but a feeble light, but it was  quite cool so we had a blazing fire which made it light enough.    When supper was over, Zebbie called us out and asked us if we could  hear anything. We could hear the most peculiar, long-drawn, sighing  wail that steadily grew louder and nearer. I was really frightened, but  he said it was the forerunner of the windstorm that would soon strike  us. He said it was wind coming down Crag Canon, and in just a few  minutes it struck us like a cold wave and rushed, sighing, on down the  canon. We could hear it after it had passed us, and it was perfectly  still around the cabin. Soon we heard the deep roaring of the coming  storm, and Zebbie called the hounds in and secured the door. The sparks  began to fly up the chimney. Jerrine lay on a bearskin before the  fire, and Mrs. O'Shaughnessy and I sat on the old blue \"settle\" at one  side. Gavotte lay on the other side of the fire on the floor, his hands  under his head. Zebbie got out his beloved old fiddle, tuned up, and  began playing. Outside the storm was raging, growing worse all the  time. Zebbie played and played. The worse the tumult, the harder the  storm, the harder he played. I remember I was holding my breath,  expecting the house to be blown away every moment, and Zebbie was  playing what he called \"Bonaparte's Retreat.\" It all seemed to flash  before me--I could see those poor, suffering soldiers staggering along  in the snow, sacrifices to one man's unholy ambition. I verily believe  we were all bewitched. I shouldn't have been surprised to have seen  witches and gnomes come tumbling down the chimney or flying in at the  door, riding on the crest of the storm. I glanced at Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy. She sat with her chin in her hand, gazing with unseeing  eyes into the fire. Zebbie seemed possessed; he couldn't tire.    It seemed like hours had passed and the tumult had not diminished. I  felt like shrieking, but I gathered Jerrine up into my arms and carried  her in to bed. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy came with us. She touched my elbow  and said, \"Child, don't look toward the window, the banshees are out  to-night.\" We knelt together beside the bed and said our beads; then,  without undressing save pulling off our shoes, we crawled under our  blankets and lay on the sweet, clean pine. We were both perfectly worn  out, but we could not sleep. There seemed to be hundreds of different  noises of the storm, for there are so many canons, so many crooks and  turns, and the great forest too. The wind was shrieking, howling, and  roaring all at once. A deep boom announced the fall of some giant of  the forest. I finally dozed off even in that terrible din, but Zebbie  was not so frenzied as he had been. He was playing \"Annie Laurie,\" and  that song has always been a favorite of mine. The storm began gradually  to die away and \"Annie Laurie\" sounded so beautiful. I was thinking of  Pauline and, I know, to Zebbie, Annie Laurie and Pauline Gorley are one  and the same.    I knew no more until I heard Zebbie call out, \"Ho, you sleepy-heads,  it's day.\" Mrs. O'Shaughnessy turned over and said she was still  sleepy. My former visit had taught me what beauty the early morning  would spread before me, so I dressed hastily and went outdoors. Zebbie  called me to go for a little walk. The amber light of the new day was  chasing the violet and amethyst shadows down the canons. It was all  more beautiful than I can tell you. On one side the canon-walls were  almost straight up. It looked as if we might step off into a very world  of mountains. Soon Old Baldy wore a crown of gleaming gold. The sun was  up. We walked on and soon came to a brook. We were washing our faces  in its icy waters when we heard twigs breaking, so we stood perfectly  still. From out the undergrowth of birch and willows came a deer with  two fawns. They stopped to drink, and nibbled the bushes. But soon they  scented strangers, and, looking about with their beautiful, startled  eyes, they saw us and away they went like the wind. We saw many great  trees uptorn by the storm. High up on the cliffs Zebbie showed me where  the eagles built every year.... We turned homeward and sat down upon  the trunk of a fallen pine to rest and take another look at the  magnificent view. Zebbie was silent, but presently he threw a handful  of pebbles down the canon wall. \"I am not sorry Pauline is dead. I have  never shed a tear. I know you think that is odd, but I have never  wanted to mourn. I am glad that it is as it is. I am happy and at peace  because I know she is mine. The little breeze is Pauline's own voice;  she had a little caressing way just like the gentlest breeze when it  stirs your hair. There is something in everything that brings back  Pauline: the beauty of the morning, the song of a bird or the flash of  its wings. The flowers look like she did. So I have not lost her, she  is mine more than ever. I have always felt so, but was never quite sure  until I went back and saw where they laid her. I know people think I am  crazy, but I don't care for that. I shall not hate to die. When you get  to be as old as I am, child, everything will have a new meaning to  you.\"    At last we slowly walked back to the cabin, and at breakfast Zebbie  told of the damage the storm had done. He was so common-place that no  one ever would have guessed his strange fancy....    I shall never forget Zebbie as I last saw him. It was the morning we  started home. After we left the bench that Zebbie lives on, our road  wound down into a deeper canon. Zebbie had followed us to where a turn  in the canon should hide us from view. I looked back and saw him  standing on the cliffs, high above us, the early morning sun turning  his snowy hair to gold, the breeze-fingers of Pauline tossing the  scanty locks. I shall always remember him so, a living monument to a  dead past.      ELINORE STEWART.          XII    A CONTENTED COUPLE           _October 6, 1911._    DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    ... I once \"heared\" Sedalia Lane telling some of her experiences, and  she said she \"surreptitiously stole along.\" One day, when I thought the  coast was clear, I was surreptitiously examining the contents of the  tool-chest with a view toward securing to myself such hammers, saws,  and what else I might need in doing some carpentry work I had planned.  The tool-chest is kept in the granary; both it and the granary are  usually kept locked. Now the \"gude mon\" has an idea that a \"wooman\"  needs no tools, and the use and misuse of his tools have led to numbers  of inter-household wars. I was gloating over my opportunity, and also  making the best of it, when a medley of burring Scotch voices brought  me to a quick realization that discretion is the better part of valor.  So I went into seclusion behind a tall oat-bin. It seemed that two  neighbors whom I had never seen were preparing to go to town, and had  come to get some tools and to see if the Stewart would lend them each a  team. Now Mr. Stewart must be very righteous, because he certainly  regardeth his beast, although he doesn't always love his neighbor as  himself. He was willing, however, for friends Tam Campbell and Archie  McEttrick to use his teams, but he himself would take a lighter rig and  go along, so as to see that his horses were properly cared for, and to  help out in case of need.    They made their plans, set the day, and went their ways. As soon as I  could, I made myself scarce about the granary and very busy about the  house, and, like Josiah Allen, I was in a very \"happyfied\" state of  mind. There is nothing Mr. Stewart likes better than to catch me  unprepared for something. I had been wanting to go to town, and he had  said I might go with him next time he went, if I was ready when he was.  I knew I would not hear one word about the proposed trip, but that only  added to the fun. I had plenty of time to make all preparations; so the  day before they were to start found me with all in readiness. It was  quite early in the spring and the evenings were quite chilly. We had  just finished supper, when we heard a great rumbling, and I knew  neighbors Campbell and McEttrick had arrived on their way to town; so I  began to prepare supper for them. I hadn't expected a woman, and was  surprised when I saw the largest, most ungainly person I have ever met  come shambling toward me.    She was Aggie McEttrick. She is tall and raw-boned, she walks with her  toes turned out, she has a most peculiar lurching gait like a camel's.  She has skin the color of a new saddle, and the oddest straggly  straw-colored hair. She never wears corsets and never makes her waists  long enough, so there is always a streak of gray undershirt visible  about her waist. Her skirts are never long enough either, and she knits  her own stockings. Those inclined can always get a good glimpse of  blue-and-white striped hose. She said, \"I guess you are the Missus.\"  And that was every word she said until I had supper on the table. The  men were busy with their teams, and she sat with her feet in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16643"],[0,"Essays (#11)"],[1,"that thing but something else is obtained, and  that it is impossible to get anything without its price,--is not less  sublime in the columns of a ledger than in the budgets of states, in  the laws of light and darkness, in all the action and reaction of  nature. I cannot doubt that the high laws which each man sees  implicated in those processes with which he is conversant, the stern  ethics which sparkle on his chisel edge, which are measured out by his  plumb and foot rule, which stand as manifest in the footing of the  shop bill as in the history of a state,--do recommend to him his  trade, and though seldom named, exalt his business to his imagination.    The league between virtue and nature engages all things to assume a  hostile front to vice. The beautiful laws and substances of the world  persecute and whip the traitor. He finds that things are arranged for  truth and benefit, but there is no den in the wide world to hide a  rogue. Commit a crime,[134] and the earth is made of glass. Commit a  crime, and it seems as if a coat of snow fell on the ground, such as  reveals in the woods the track of every partridge and fox and squirrel  and mole. You cannot recall the spoken word,[135] you cannot wipe out  the foot-track, you cannot draw up the ladder, so as to leave no inlet  or clew. Some damning circumstance always transpires. The laws and  substances of nature--water, snow, wind, gravitation--become penalties  to the thief.    On the other hand, the law holds with equal sureness for all right  action. Love, and you shall be loved. All love is mathematically just,  as much as the two sides of an algebraic equation. The good man has  absolute good, which like fire turns everything to its own nature, so  that you cannot do him any harm; but as the royal armies sent against  Napoleon, when he approached, cast down their colors and from enemies  became friends, so disasters of all kinds, as sickness, offense,  poverty, prove benefactors:--                  \"Winds blow and waters roll      Strength to the brave, and power and deity,      Yet in themselves are nothing.\"    The good are befriended even by weakness and defect. As no man had  ever a point of pride that was not injurious to him, so no man had  ever a defect that was not somewhere made useful to him. The stag in  the fable[136] admired his horns and blamed his feet, but when the  hunter came, his feet saved him, and afterwards, caught in the  thicket, his horns destroyed him. Every man in his lifetime needs to  thank his faults. As no man thoroughly understands a truth until he  has contended against it, so no man has a thorough acquaintance with  the hindrances or talents of men, until he has suffered from the one,  and seen the triumph of the other over his own want of the same. Has  he a defect of temper that unfits him to live in society? Thereby he  is driven to entertain himself alone, and acquire habits of self-help;  and thus, like the wounded oyster, he mends his shell with pearl.    Our strength grows out of our weakness. The indignation which arms  itself with secret forces does not awaken until we are pricked and  stung and sorely assailed. A great man is always willing to be little.  Whilst he sits on the cushion of advantages, he goes to sleep. When he  is punished, tormented, defeated, he has a chance to learn something;  he has been put on his wits, on his manhood; he has gained facts;  learns his ignorance; is cured of the insanity of conceit; has got  moderation and real skill. The wise man throws himself on the side of  his assailants. It is more his interest than it is theirs to find his  weak point. The wound cicatrizes and falls off from him like a dead  skin, and when they would triumph, lo! he has passed on invulnerable.  Blame is safer than praise. I hate to be defended in a newspaper. As  long as all that is said is said against me, I feel a certain  assurance of success. But as soon as honeyed words of praise are  spoken for me, I feel as one that lies unprotected before his enemies.  In general, every evil to which we do not succumb is a benefactor. As  the Sandwich Islander believes that the strength and valor of the  enemy he kills passes into himself, so we gain the strength of the  temptation we resist.    The same guards which protect us from disaster, defect, and enmity,  defend us, if we will, from selfishness and fraud. Bolts and bars are  not the best of our institutions, nor is shrewdness in trade a mark of  wisdom. Men suffer all their life long, under the foolish superstition  that they can be cheated. But it is as impossible for a man to be  cheated by anyone but himself,[137] as for a thing to be and not to be  at the same time. There is a third silent party to all our bargains.  The nature and soul of things takes on itself the guaranty of the  fulfillment of every contract, so that honest service cannot come to  loss. If you serve an ungrateful master, serve him the more. Put God  in your debt. Every stroke shall be repaid. The longer the payment is  withholden,[138] the better for you; for compound interest on compound  interest is the rate and usage of this exchequer.    The history of persecution is a history of endeavors to cheat nature,  to make water run up hill, to twist a rope of sand. It makes no  difference whether the actors be many or one, a tyrant or a mob. A  mob[139] is a society of bodies voluntarily bereaving themselves of  reason, and traversing its work. The mob is man voluntarily descending  to the nature of the beast. Its fit hour of activity is night. Its  actions are insane like its whole constitution; it persecutes a  principle; it would whip a right; it would tar and feather justice, by  inflicting fire and outrage upon the houses and persons of those who  have these. It resembles the prank of boys, who run with fire engines  to put out the ruddy aurora streaming to the stars. The inviolate  spirit turns their spite against the wrongdoers. The martyr cannot be  dishonored. Every lash inflicted is a tongue of fame; every prison, a  more illustrious abode; every burned book or house enlightens the  world; every suppressed or expunged word reverberates through the  earth from side to side. Hours of sanity and consideration are always  arriving to communities, as to individuals, when the truth is seen,  and the martyrs are justified.    Thus do all things preach the indifferency of circumstances. The man  is all. Everything has two sides, a good and an evil. Every advantage  has its tax. I learn to be content. But the doctrine of compensation  is not the doctrine of indifferency. The thoughtless say, on hearing  these representations, What boots it to do well? there is one event to  good and evil; if I gain any good, I must pay for it; if I lose any  good, I gain some other; all actions are indifferent.    There is a deeper fact in the soul than compensation, to wit, its own  nature. The soul is not a compensation, but a life. The soul _is_.  Under all this running sea of circumstance, whose waters ebb and flow  with perfect balance, lies the aboriginal abyss of real Being.  Essence, or God, is not a relation, or a part, but the whole. Being is  the vast affirmative, excluding negation, self-balanced, and  swallowing up all relations, parts, and times within itself. Nature,  truth, virtue, are the influx from thence. Vice is the absence or  departure of the same. Nothing, Falsehood, may indeed stand as the  great Night or shade, on which, as a background, the living universe  paints itself forth, but no fact is begotten by it; it cannot work,  for it is not. It cannot work any good; it cannot work any harm. It is  harm inasmuch as it is worse not to be than to be.    We feel defrauded of the retribution due to evil acts, because the  criminal adheres to his vice and contumacy, and does not come to a  crisis or judgment anywhere in visible nature. There is no stunning  confutation of his nonsense before men and angels. Has he therefore  outwitted the law? Inasmuch as he carries the malignity and the lie  with him, he so far deceases from nature. In some manner there will be  a demonstration of the wrong to the understanding also; but should we  not see it, this deadly deduction makes square the eternal account.    Neither can it be said, on the other hand, that the gain of rectitude  must be bought by any loss. There is no penalty to virtue; no penalty  to wisdom; they are proper additions of being. In a virtuous action, I  properly _am_; in a virtuous act, I add to the world; I plant into  deserts conquered from Chaos and Nothing, and see the darkness  receding on the limits of the horizon. There can be no excess to love;  none to knowledge; none to beauty, when these attributes are  considered in the purest sense. The soul refuses limits, and always  affirms an Optimism,[140] never a Pessimism.    Man's life is a progress, and not a station. His instinct is trust.  Our instinct uses \"more\" and \"less\" in application to man, of the  _presence of the soul_, and not of its absence; the brave man is  greater than the coward; the true, the benevolent, the wise, is more a  man, and not less, than the fool and knave. There is no tax on the  good of virtue; for that is the incoming of God himself, or absolute  existence without any comparative. Material good has its tax, and if  it came without desert or sweat, has no root in me, and the next wind  will blow it away. But all the good of nature is the soul's, and may  be had, if paid for in nature's lawful coin, that is, by labor which  the heart and the head allow. I no longer wish to meet a good I do not  earn; for example, to find a pot of buried gold, knowing that it  brings with it new burdens. I do not wish more external  goods,--neither possessions, nor honors, nor powers, nor persons. The  gain is apparent; the tax is certain. But there is no tax on the  knowledge that the compensation exists, and that it is not desirable  to dig "]]]
