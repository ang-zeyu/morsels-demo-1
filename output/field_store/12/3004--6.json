[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14264"],[0,"The Practice and Science of Drawing (#11)"],[1," perhaps the chief mistake in Art Schools has been that they have too  largely confined themselves to training students mechanically to observe  and portray the thing set before them to copy, an antique figure, a  still-life group, a living model sitting as still and lifeless as he  can. Now this is all very well as far as it goes, but the real matter of  art is not necessarily in all this. And if the real matter of art is  neglected too long the student may find it difficult to get in touch  with it again.    These accurate, painstaking school studies are very necessary indeed as  a training for the eye in observing accurately, and the hand in  reproducing the appearances of things, because it is through the  reproduction of natural appearances and the knowledge of form and colour  derived from such study that the student will afterwards find the means  of giving expression to his feelings. But when valuable prizes and  scholarships are given for them, and _not_ for really artistic work,  they do tend to become the end instead of the means.    It is of course improbable that even school studies done with the sole  idea of accuracy by a young artist will in all cases be devoid of  artistic feeling; it will creep in, if he has the artistic instinct. But  it is not enough #encouraged#, and the prize is generally given to the  drawing that is most complete and like the model in a commonplace way.  If a student, moved by a strong feeling for form, lets himself go and  does a fine thing, probably only remotely like the model to the average  eye, the authorities are puzzled and don't usually know what to make of  it.    There are schools where the most artistic qualities are encouraged, but  they generally neglect the academic side; and the student leaves them  poorly equipped for fine work. Surely it would be possible to make a  distinction, giving prizes for academic drawings which should be as  thoroughly accurate in a mechanical way as industry and application can  make them, and also for artistic drawings, in which the student should  be encouraged to follow his bent, striving for the expression of any  qualities that delight him, and troubling less about mechanical  accuracy. The use of drawing as an expression of something felt is so  often left until after the school training is done that many students  fail to achieve it altogether. And rows of lifeless pictures, made up of  models copied in different attitudes, with studio properties around  them, are the result, and pass for art in many quarters. Such pictures  often display considerable ability, for as Burne-Jones says in one of  his letters, \"It is very difficult to paint even a bad picture.\" But had  the ability been differently directed, the pictures might have been  good.    [Illustration: Plate XIV.    DRAWING IN RED CHALK BY ERNEST COLE    Example of unacademic drawing made in the author's class at the  Goldsmiths College School of Art.]    It is difficult to explain what is wrong with an academic drawing, and  what is the difference between it and fa fine drawing. But perhaps this  difference can be brought home a little more clearly if you will pardon  a rather fanciful simile. I am told that if you construct a perfectly  fitted engine--the piston fitting the cylinder with absolute accuracy  and the axles their sockets with no space between, &c.--it #will not  work#, but be a lifeless mass of iron. There must be enough play between  the vital parts to allow of some movement; \"dither\" is, I believe, the  Scotch word for it. The piston must be allowed some play in the opening  of the cylinder through which it passes, or it will not be able to move  and show any life. And the axles of the wheels in their sockets, and, in  fact, all parts of the machine where life and movement are to occur,  must have this play, this \"dither.\" It has always seemed to me that the  accurately fitting engine was like a good academic drawing, in a way a  perfect piece of workmanship, but lifeless. Imperfectly perfect, because  there was no room left for the play of life. And to carry the simile  further, if you allow too great a play between the parts, so that they  fit one over the other too loosely, the engine will lose power and  become a poor rickety thing. There must be the smallest amount of play  that will allow of its working. And the more perfectly made the engine,  the less will the amount of this \"dither\" be.    The word \"dither\" will be a useful name to give that elusive quality,  that play on mechanical accuracy, existing in all vital art. #It is this  vital quality that has not yet received much attention in art training.#    It is here that the photograph fails, it can only at best give  mechanical accuracy, whereas art gives the impression of a live,  individual consciousness. Where the recording instrument is a live  individual, there is no mechanical standard of accuracy possible, as  every recording instrument is a different personality. And it is the  subtle differences in the individual renderings of nature that are the  life-blood of art. The photograph, on account of its being chained to  mechanical accuracy, has none of this play of life to give it charm. It  only approaches artistic conditions when it is blurred, vague, and  indefinite, as in so-called artistic photography, for then only can some  amount of this vitalising play, this \"dither\" be imagined to exist.    It is this perfect accuracy, this lack of play, of variety, that makes  the machine-made article so lifeless. Wherever there is life there is  variety, and the substitution of the machine-made for the hand-made  article has impoverished the world to a greater extent than we are  probably yet aware of. Whereas formerly, before the advent of machinery,  the commonest article you could pick up had a life and warmth which gave  it individual interest, now everything is turned out to such a  perfection of deadness that one is driven to pick up and collect, in  sheer desperation, the commonest rubbish still surviving from the  earlier period.    But to return to our drawings. If the variations from strict accuracy  made under the influence of feeling are too great, the result will be  a caricature. The variations in a beautiful drawing are so subtle as  often to defy detection. The studies of Ingres are an instance of what I  mean. How true and instinct with life are his lines, and how easily one  might assume that they were merely accurate. But no merely accurate work  would have the impelling quality these drawings possess. If the writer  may venture an opinion on so great an artist, the subtle difference we  are talking about was sometimes missed by even Ingres himself, when he  transferred his drawings to the canvas; and the pictures have in some  cases become academic and lifeless. Without the stimulus of nature  before him it was difficult to preserve the \"dither\" in the drawing, and  the life has escaped. This is the great difficulty of working from  studies; it is so easy to lose those little points in your drawing that  make for vitality of expression, in the process of copying in cold  blood.    [Illustration: Plate XV.    FROM A PENCIL DRAWING BY INGRES    _Photo Bulloz_]    The fact is: it is only the academic that can be taught. And it is no  small thing if this is well done in a school. The qualities that give  vitality and distinction to drawing must be appreciated by the student  himself, and may often assert themselves in his drawing without his  being aware that he is doing aught but honestly copying. And if he has  trained himself thoroughly he will not find much difficulty when he is  moved to vital expression. All the master can do is to stand by and  encourage whenever he sees evidence of the real thing. But there is  undoubtedly this danger of the school studies becoming the end instead  of the means.    A drawing is not necessarily academic because it is thorough, but only  because it is dead. Neither is a drawing necessarily academic because  it is done in what is called a conventional style, any more than it is  good because it is done in an unconventional style. The test is whether  it has life and conveys genuine feeling.           *       *       *       *       *    There is much foolish talk about conventional art, as if art could ever  get away from conventions, if it would. The convention will be more  natural or more abstract according to the nature of the thing to be  conveyed and the medium employed to express it. But naturalism is just  as much a convention as any of the other isms that art has lately been  so assailed with. For a really unconventional art there is Madame  Tussaud's Waxworks. There, even the convention of a frame and flat  surface are done away with, besides the painted symbols to represent  things. They have real natural chairs, tables, and floors, real clothes,  and even real hair. Realism everywhere, but no life. And we all know the  result. There is more expression of life in a few lines scribbled on  paper by a good artist than in all the reality of the popular show.    It would seem that, after a certain point, the nearer your picture  approaches the actual illusion of natural appearance, the further you  are from the expression of life. One can never hope to surpass the  illusionary appearance of a #tableau vivant#. There you have real,  living people. But what an awful deathlike stillness is felt when the  curtain is drawn aside. The nearer you approach the actual in all its  completeness, the more evident is the lack of that #movement# which  always accompanies life. You cannot express life by copying laboriously  natural appearances. Those things in the appearance that convey vital  expression and are capable of being translated into the medium he is  working with, have to be sought by the artist, and the painted symbols  of his picture made accordingly. This lack of the movement of life is  never noticed in a good picture,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1429"],[0,"The Garden Party, and Other Stories (#11)"],[1,"yourself, darling,\" said she. \"Run down just as you are. No,  wait, take the arum lilies too. People of that class are so impressed by  arum lilies.\"    \"The stems will ruin her lace frock,\" said practical Jose.    So they would. Just in time. \"Only the basket, then. And, Laura!\"--her  mother followed her out of the marquee--\"don't on any account--\"    \"What mother?\"    No, better not put such ideas into the child's head! \"Nothing! Run  along.\"    It was just growing dusky as Laura shut their garden gates. A big dog  ran by like a shadow. The road gleamed white, and down below in the  hollow the little cottages were in deep shade. How quiet it seemed after  the afternoon. Here she was going down the hill to somewhere where a man  lay dead, and she couldn't realize it. Why couldn't she? She stopped  a minute. And it seemed to her that kisses, voices, tinkling spoons,  laughter, the smell of crushed grass were somehow inside her. She had no  room for anything else. How strange! She looked up at the pale sky, and  all she thought was, \"Yes, it was the most successful party.\"    Now the broad road was crossed. The lane began, smoky and dark. Women in  shawls and men's tweed caps hurried by. Men hung over the palings; the  children played in the doorways. A low hum came from the mean little  cottages. In some of them there was a flicker of light, and a shadow,  crab-like, moved across the window. Laura bent her head and hurried on.  She wished now she had put on a coat. How her frock shone! And the  big hat with the velvet streamer--if only it was another hat! Were the  people looking at her? They must be. It was a mistake to have come; she  knew all along it was a mistake. Should she go back even now?    No, too late. This was the house. It must be. A dark knot of people  stood outside. Beside the gate an old, old woman with a crutch sat in a  chair, watching. She had her feet on a newspaper. The voices stopped as  Laura drew near. The group parted. It was as though she was expected, as  though they had known she was coming here.    Laura was terribly nervous. Tossing the velvet ribbon over her shoulder,  she said to a woman standing by, \"Is this Mrs. Scott's house?\" and the  woman, smiling queerly, said, \"It is, my lass.\"    Oh, to be away from this! She actually said, \"Help me, God,\" as she  walked up the tiny path and knocked. To be away from those staring eyes,  or to be covered up in anything, one of those women's shawls even. I'll  just leave the basket and go, she decided. I shan't even wait for it to  be emptied.    Then the door opened. A little woman in black showed in the gloom.    Laura said, \"Are you Mrs. Scott?\" But to her horror the woman answered,  \"Walk in please, miss,\" and she was shut in the passage.    \"No,\" said Laura, \"I don't want to come in. I only want to leave this  basket. Mother sent--\"    The little woman in the gloomy passage seemed not to have heard her.  \"Step this way, please, miss,\" she said in an oily voice, and Laura  followed her.    She found herself in a wretched little low kitchen, lighted by a smoky  lamp. There was a woman sitting before the fire.    \"Em,\" said the little creature who had let her in. \"Em! It's a young  lady.\" She turned to Laura. She said meaningly, \"I'm 'er sister, miss.  You'll excuse 'er, won't you?\"    \"Oh, but of course!\" said Laura. \"Please, please don't disturb her. I--I  only want to leave--\"    But at that moment the woman at the fire turned round. Her face, puffed  up, red, with swollen eyes and swollen lips, looked terrible. She seemed  as though she couldn't understand why Laura was there. What did it mean?  Why was this stranger standing in the kitchen with a basket? What was it  all about? And the poor face puckered up again.    \"All right, my dear,\" said the other. \"I'll thenk the young lady.\"    And again she began, \"You'll excuse her, miss, I'm sure,\" and her face,  swollen too, tried an oily smile.    Laura only wanted to get out, to get away. She was back in the passage.  The door opened. She walked straight through into the bedroom, where the  dead man was lying.    \"You'd like a look at 'im, wouldn't you?\" said Em's sister, and she  brushed past Laura over to the bed. \"Don't be afraid, my lass,\"--and now  her voice sounded fond and sly, and fondly she drew down the sheet--\"'e  looks a picture. There's nothing to show. Come along, my dear.\"    Laura came.    There lay a young man, fast asleep--sleeping so soundly, so deeply, that  he was far, far away from them both. Oh, so remote, so peaceful. He was  dreaming. Never wake him up again. His head was sunk in the pillow, his  eyes were closed; they were blind under the closed eyelids. He was given  up to his dream. What did garden-parties and baskets and lace frocks  matter to him? He was far from all those things. He was wonderful,  beautiful. While they were laughing and while the band was playing,  this marvel had come to the lane. Happy... happy... All is well, said that  sleeping face. This is just as it should be. I am content.    But all the same you had to cry, and she couldn't go out of the room  without saying something to him. Laura gave a loud childish sob.    \"Forgive my hat,\" she said.    And this time she didn't wait for Em's sister. She found her way out of  the door, down the path, past all those dark people. At the corner of  the lane she met Laurie.    He stepped out of the shadow. \"Is that you, Laura?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Mother was getting anxious. Was it all right?\"    \"Yes, quite. Oh, Laurie!\" She took his arm, she pressed up against him.    \"I say, you're not crying, are you?\" asked her brother.    Laura shook her head. She was.    Laurie put his arm round her shoulder. \"Don't cry,\" he said in his warm,  loving voice. \"Was it awful?\"    \"No,\" sobbed Laura. \"It was simply marvellous. But Laurie--\" She  stopped, she looked at her brother. \"Isn't life,\" she stammered, \"isn't  life--\" But what life was she couldn't explain. No matter. He quite  understood.    \"Isn't it, darling?\" said Laurie.          3. THE DAUGHTERS OF THE LATE COLONEL.    Chapter 3.I.    The week after was one of the busiest weeks of their lives. Even when  they went to bed it was only their bodies that lay down and rested;  their minds went on, thinking things out, talking things over,  wondering, deciding, trying to remember where...    Constantia lay like a statue, her hands by her sides, her feet just  overlapping each other, the sheet up to her chin. She stared at the  ceiling.    \"Do you think father would mind if we gave his top-hat to the porter?\"    \"The porter?\" snapped Josephine. \"Why ever the porter? What a very  extraordinary idea!\"    \"Because,\" said Constantia slowly, \"he must often have to go to  funerals. And I noticed at--at the cemetery that he only had a bowler.\"  She paused. \"I thought then how very much he'd appreciate a top-hat. We  ought to give him a present, too. He was always very nice to father.\"    \"But,\" cried Josephine, flouncing on her pillow and staring across the  dark at Constantia, \"father's head!\" And suddenly, for one awful moment,  she nearly giggled. Not, of course, that she felt in the least like  giggling. It must have been habit. Years ago, when they had stayed awake  at night talking, their beds had simply heaved. And now the porter's  head, disappearing, popped out, like a candle, under father's hat... The  giggle mounted, mounted; she clenched her hands; she fought it down; she  frowned fiercely at the dark and said \"Remember\" terribly sternly.    \"We can decide to-morrow,\" she said.    Constantia had noticed nothing; she sighed.    \"Do you think we ought to have our dressing-gowns dyed as well?\"    \"Black?\" almost shrieked Josephine.    \"Well, what else?\" said Constantia. \"I was thinking--it doesn't seem  quite sincere, in a way, to wear black out of doors and when we're fully  dressed, and then when we're at home--\"    \"But nobody sees us,\" said Josephine. She gave the bedclothes such a  twitch that both her feet became uncovered, and she had to creep up the  pillows to get them well under again.    \"Kate does,\" said Constantia. \"And the postman very well might.\"    Josephine thought of her dark-red slippers, which matched her  dressing-gown, and of Constantia's favourite indefinite green ones which  went with hers. Black! Two black dressing-gowns and two pairs of black  woolly slippers, creeping off to the bathroom like black cats.    \"I don't think it's absolutely necessary,\" said she.    Silence. Then Constantia said, \"We shall have to post the papers with  the notice in them to-morrow to catch the Ceylon mail... How many letters  have we had up till now?\"    \"Twenty-three.\"    Josephine had replied to them all, and twenty-three times when she came  to \"We miss our dear father so much\" she had broken down and had to use  her handkerchief, and on some of them even to soak up a very light-blue  tear with an edge of blotting-paper. Strange! She couldn't have put  it on--but twenty-three times. Even now, though, when she said over to  herself sadly \"We miss our dear father so much,\" she could have cried if  she'd wanted to.    \"Have you got enough stamps?\" came from Constantia.    \"Oh, how can I tell?\" said Josephine crossly. \"What's the good of asking  me that now?\"    \"I was just wondering,\" said Constantia mildly.    Silence again. There came a little rustle, a scurry, a hop.    \"A mouse,\" said Constantia.    \"It can't be a mouse because there aren't any crumbs,\" said Josephine.    \"But it doesn't know there aren't,\" said Constantia.    A spasm of pity squeezed her heart. Poor little thing! She wished she'd  left a tiny piece of biscuit on the dressing-table. It was awful to  think of it not finding anything. What would it do?    \"I can't think how they manage to live at all,\" she said slowly.    \"Who?\" demanded Josephine.    And Constantia said more loudly than she meant to, \"Mice.\"    Josephine was furious. \"Oh, what nonsense, Con!\" she said. \"What"]]]
