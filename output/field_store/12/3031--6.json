[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14772"],[0,"Acton's Feud: A Public School Story (#11)"],[1,"Jack Bourne engaged in a desperate  fight with a young yokel. There was a small crowd of loafers, who were  delighted at this little turn up, and were loud in their advice to the  fellow to give \"the young swell a good hiding.\"    This little crowd, as I said, caught Acton's eye, and when he perceived  that one of the fighters was a St. Amory fellow, he hurried up to see  what was the little game.    Young Bourne was getting the worst of it. The yokel was a year or two  older, was taller, and stones heavier. It was an unequal fight. Bourne  was standing up to his man pluckily, and, thanks to the \"agricultural\"  style of the clodhopper, was not taking nearly so much harm as he should  have done. He was, however, pretty low down in the mouth, for there was  not a friendly eye to encourage him, nor a friendly shout to back him up.  On the contrary, the mob howled with delight as their man got \"home,\" and  encouraged him: \"Gow it, Dick! Knock the stuffin' out of 'im!\"    Acton had not been noticed, but he thrust himself into the mob, and  said, \"Stand back, you little beggars, or I'll massacre the lot of you.  Give the boy room, you filthy pigs!\" The \"pigs\" scuttled back, and for  the first time Bourne really had fair play.    Acton took out his watch and assumed the direction of the fight.    \"Time!\" he shouted out. \"You fellow, that's your corner, and if you stir  out of it before I give the word I'll thrash you within an inch of your  life. This will be ours, Bourne.\" He strode in between the two, and  pushed the yokel among his friends, whilst he dragged Bourne a little  apart.    \"Thanks awfully, Acton. That beast knocked me off the path into the  snow-heap when he saw I was one of the school. I struck him, but he's a  big handful.\"    \"Don't talk, Bourne,\" said Acton, grimly. \"It's only wasting breath. Keep  cool, man, and you will pull it off yet.\"    Thanks to Acton's encouragement, young Bourne worked along ever so much  better, so that when time was called he had taken no damage practically,  but had scored a little on his own account.    \"Sit down on my coat. You're doing famously. Whatever you do, don't let  him swing you one in the face. You'll be snuffed out if you do. Keep him  out at any cost, and try an upper cut after he swings. Waste no time  after he's missed.\"    But although young Bourne scored no end in the next few rounds by  following Acton's advice, his good efforts seemed wasted. The lout's face  was as hard as a butcher's block. Acton saw that Bourne was visibly  tiring, and that it was an almost foregone conclusion that in the end he  would be beaten. He could hardly stall off the fellow's attack.    After the seventh round Acton saw that he must put all to the touch, or  Bourne would lose. \"Listen carefully, young 'un. You're jolly game, and  that's a fact, but there's no good hammering on the fool's face--he can't  feel. You must try another trick. It's the last in your box, too, Bourne,  so make no mistake. St. Amory's for ever! When he swings, duck. Don't try  to ward him off--he'll beat you down. Then, for all you're worth, drive  home with your left on the jaw. On the jaw for all you're worth. You've  seen the sergeant do it dozens of times in the gym. Keep cool, and look  when you hit--on the very peak. Understand?\"    \"Rather!\" said Jack, coolly but wearily.    \"Time!\"    The yokel came on in all the pride of his beefy strength, for ha knew  that he was going to finish the \"swell\" this round. He swung. Bourne  ducked, and then, quick as lightning, the lad closed in, and, with the  last ounce he had in him, drove his left on the jaw. He was true to a  hair.    \"_Habet!_\" shouted Acton. \"Don't give him time, Jack. Send him down  if you can.\"    Bourne's \"point\" had the usual effect; the lout's head swam, he felt sick  and sorry, and could not even ward off Jack's blows. He backed, Jack  scoring like mad all the time, and when Acton finally called \"time!\" he  dropped on to the ground blubbing. The fellow's eye was visibly swelling,  his lips were cut, and his nose bled villainously.    [Illustration: ACTON THREW HIM INTO THE SNOW-HEAP.]    \"The pig bleeds,\" said Acton, cheerfully. \"You have him now, Bourne; he's  too sick to have an ounce of fight left in him. Time!\"    The next round wasn't a round really; it was a procession, with Bourne,  as fresh as paint from his success, following up the other blubbing with  rage, pain, and sickness. Before Acton called, the fellow dropped to the  ground and howled dismally.    \"Get your coat, Jack, and then come here. He's done. Stand back, you  others.\"    Jack came back.    \"Now, you pig, get up and apologize to this gentleman for having knocked  him into the snow-heap. I suppose your pig's eyes couldn't see he was  only half your size.\" Acton got hold of the fellow by the collar and  jerked him to his feet. \"Apologize.\"    The fellow would not understand; he snivelled obstinately, and struggled  aimlessly in Acton's grasp.    \"Apologize.\"    \"I wown't.\"    \"Good,\" said Acton, grimly. With his flat hand he gave the fellow a  thundering cuff which sent him sprawling. Acton then caught him by the  scruff of his neck and threw him headlong into the snow-heap.    \"Come along, Bourne,\" he said, with a smile. \"You have fought a good  fight this day, and no mistake. That fellow will have a fit the next and  every time he sees the smallest St. Amory's fag's cap.\"    \"I say, Acton, you're an awful brick to back me up like that.\"    \"Don't mention it, Bourne. Come and have some tea with me, and I'll pour  oil into your wounds, or at any rate, I'll paint 'em.\"    So young Bourne had tea with Acton, and his host went out afterwards to  Dann's the chemist's and brought back a camel's-hair brush and some  lotion. Thanks to this, Jack's scars appeared as very honourable wounds  indeed.    From that day Jack thought Acton the finest fellow in St. Amory's.    \"He did not spread-eagle that fool,\" he said to himself, \"but let me have  the glory of pounding the ugly brute into jelly, and made me go in and  win when I was ready to give in to the cad. Why did not Phil give him his  cap? There's something rotten somewhere.\"    As for Acton, as I said before, he regarded this little incident as a  treasure trove upon which he could draw almost unlimitedly in his  campaign against Bourne. \"I'll strike at Bourne, senr., through his young  brother. I'll train him up in the way he should go, and when our  unspeakable prig of a Philip sees what a beautiful article young Jack  finally emerges, he'll wish he'd left me alone. Jack, my boy, I'm sorry,  but I'm going to make you a bad boy, just to give your elder brother  something to think about. You're going to become a terrible monster of  iniquity, just to shock your reverend brother.\"    Acton took not the smallest interest in the usual Easter Term games.  Footer was only played occasionally, but there was one blessing, the  fellows need not play the usual Thursday Old Game. As for cross-country  running, paper chases, _et hoc genus omne_, Acton refused to have  anything to do with them. \"That sort,\" he said to Dick Worcester, \"isn't  in the same street with footer.\"    \"Why not try and lift the Public School Heavy at Aldershot?\" suggested  Worcester.    \"There's Hodgson in for it, Dick.\"    \"A good man; but if you would only apply yourself seriously to the  business I'd back you. You're a good weight, and got a longer reach than  Hodgson.\"    \"There's Bourne, too.\"    \"Personally, I believe Phil is only pacing Hodgson to take him along  quicker.\"    \"It's an awful fag, and I believe Eton have got the Heavy safe and sure  this year. A cousin of mine there says that their pet, Jarvis, would walk  right through the best man we've ever turned out.\"    \"Oh, that's their usual brag!\"    \"Personally, I don't think so. They have got a young Bermondsey  professor--who is up to all the latest dodges--to coach. Our sergeant is  a bit old-fashioned--good, but old-fashioned. Does not do enough with his  right.\"    \"I'm quite an amateur,\" said Dick. \"Don't understand the finer shades of  the arts. Should have thought the sergeant good enough.\"    \"_Dubito!_ Anyhow, Dick, I'll think it over; and if I think I can  make a decent show I'll have a shot. When does it come off?\"    \"At Aldershot? Oh!--last week in March.\"    \"That gives me nearly two months. One can turn round in two months; and  if I'm satisfied as to my coaching I'll certainly try at Aldershot. But  what has a fellow to do on the half-holidays now? No footer, and one  might do enough practice after tea for the Heavy. I wish Kipling would  write a book every week. He is the only fellow in England who can write.\"    So Acton, on the half-holidays, prepared to read his novels by his  fireside. Not that he was particularly fond of toasting himself, but  because, for him, it was all he could do.    But Corker came to his rescue. The old man, after having had his back to  the wall for an age, consented to monitors being allowed to cycle by  themselves, and even to be _chaperon_ to any fags who cared to run  with them, and--important _proviso_--whom the monitors did not  object to. Otherwise the old rule of no cycling _sans_ house-master  was in force.    Acton thereupon invested in a swell machine, and he and young Bourne, or  Grim, or Wilson on the hired article, would cover no end of country  between dinner and roll call.    By-and-by Phil noticed that his brother was getting pretty thick with  Acton.    \"Rather thick with Acton, Jack? I don't think he'll do you any good.\"    \"He has, anyhow, Phil.\"    \"How?\"    Jack explained.    \"I'm glad you licked the animal, young 'un; but, all the same, I wish  some other fellow had seen you through.\"    \"I don't!\" said Jack, hotly.    \"I wonder,\" said Phil, dryly, \"what is the great attraction which a Sixth  Form fellow sees in a fag? Above all, a fag of the name of Bourne?\"    \"Fact is, I don't see it myself,\" said Jack,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14776"],[0,"The Arabian Art of Taming and Training Wild & Vicious Horses (#11)"],[1,"interest with which I have ever perused the most       brilliant romance.
