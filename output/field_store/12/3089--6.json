The young  Hebrew asked him to go on; but Homer said that the passage which  followed was mere narrative, from a long narrative poem. David looked  surprised that his new friend had not pointed a moral as he sang; and  said simply, \"We sing that thus:--        \"As for man, his days are as grass;      As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth;      For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone,      And the place thereof shall know it no more.           But the mercy of the Lord           Is from everlasting to everlasting              Of them that fear him;      And his righteousness          Unto children's children,            To such as keep his covenant,      As remember his commandments to do them!\"    Homer's face flashed delighted. \"I, like you, 'keep his covenant,'\" he  cried; and then without a lyre, for his was still in David's hands, he  sang, in clear tone:--        \"Thou bid'st me birds obey;--I scorn their flight,      If on the left they rise, or on the right!      Heed them who may, the will of Jove I own,      Who mortals and immortals rules alone!\"[E]    \"That is more in David's key,\" said the young Philistine harper, seeing  that the poets had fallen to talk together again. \"But how would it  sound in one of the hymns on one of our feast-days?\"        \"Who mortals and immortals rules alone.\"    \"How, indeed?\" cried one of his young companions. \"There would be more  sense in what the priests say and sing, if each were not quarrelling for  his own,--Dagon against Astarte, and Astarte against Dagon.\"    The old captain bent over, that the poets might not hear him, and  whispered: \"There it is that the Hebrews have so much more heart than we  in such things. Miserable fellows though they are, so many of them, yet,  when I have gone through their whole land with the caravans, the chances  have been that any serious-minded man spoke of no God but this '_He_'  of David's.\"    \"What is his name?\"    \"They do not know themselves, I believe.\"    \"Well, as I said an hour ago, God's man or Dagon's man,--for those are  good names enough for me,--I care little; but I should like to sing as  that young fellow does.\"    \"My boy,\" said the old man, \"have not you heard him enough to see that  it is not _he_ that sings, near as much as this love of his for a Spirit  he does not name? It is that spirited heart of his that sings.\"    \"_You_ sing like him? Find his life, boy; and perhaps it may sing for  you.\"    \"We should be more manly men, if he sang to us every night.\"    \"Or if the other did,\" said an Ionian sailor.    \"Yes,\" said the chief. \"And yet, I think, if your countryman sang every  night to me, he would make me want the other. Whether David's singing  would send me to his, I do not feel sure. But how silly to compare them!  As well compare the temple in Accho with the roar of a whirlwind--\"    \"Or the point of my lance with the flight of an eagle. The men are in  two worlds.\"    \"O, no! that is saying too much. You said that one could paint  pictures--\"    \"--Into which the other puts life. Yes, I did say so. We are fortunate  that we have them together.\"    \"For this man sings of men quite as well as the other does; and to have  the other sing of God--'    \"--Why, it completes the song. Between them they bring the two worlds  together.\"    \"He bows the heavens, and comes down,\" said the boy of the olive-harp,  trying to hum David's air.    \"Let us ask them--\"    And just then there rang along the valley the sound of a distant  conch-shell. The soldiers groaned, roused up, and each looked for his  own side-arms and his own skin.    But the poets talked on unheeding.    The old chief knocked down a stack of lances; but the crash did not  rouse them. He was obliged himself to interrupt their eager converse.    \"I am sorry to break in; but the night-horn has sounded to rest, and the  guard will be round to inspect the posts. I am sorry to hurry you away,  sir,\" he said to David.    David thanked him courteously.    \"Welcome the coming, speed the parting guest,\" said Homer, with a smile.    \"We will all meet to-morrow. And may to-night's dreams be good omens!\"    \"If we dream at all,\" said Homer again:--        \"Without a sign his sword the brave man draws,      And asks no omen but his country's cause.\"    They were all standing together, as he made this careless reply to the  captain; and one of the young men drew him aside, and whispered that  David was in arms against his country.    Homer was troubled that he had spoken as he did, But the young Jew  looked little as if he needed sympathy. He saw the doubt and regret  which hung over their kindly faces; told them not to fear for him;  singing, as he bade them good night, and with one of the Carmel-men  walked home to his own outpost:--        \"The Lord who delivered me from the paw of the lion,      The Lord who delivered me from the paw of the bear,        He will deliver me.\"    And he smiled to think how his Carmelite companion would start, if he  knew when first he used those words.    So they parted, as men who should meet on the morrow.    But God disposes.    David had left to-morrow's dangers for to-morrow to care for. It seemed  to promise him that he must be in arms against Saul. But, unlike us in  our eagerness to anticipate our conflicts of duty, David _waited_.    And the Lord delivered him. While they were singing by the brookside,  the proud noblemen of the Philistine army had forced an interview with  their king; and, in true native Philistine arrogance, insisted that  \"this Hebrew\" and his men should be sent away.    With the light of morning the king sent for the minstrel, and  courteously dismissed him, because \"the princes of the Philistines have  said, 'He shall not go up with us to the battle.'\"    So David marched his men to Ziklag.    And David and Homer never met on earth again.        NOTE.--This will be a proper place to print the following note,      which I was obliged to write to a second cousin of Miss Dryasdust      after she had read the MS. of the article above:--        \"DEAR MADAM:--I thank you for your kind suggestion, in returning      my paper, that it involves a piece of impossible history. You      inform me, that, according to the nomenclatured formulas and      homophonic analogies of Professor Gouraud, of      never-to-be-forgotten memory, \"A NEEDLE is less useful for curing      a DEAF HEAD, than for putting ear-rings into a _Miss's      lily-ears_\"; and that this shows that the second king of Judah,      named David (or Deaf-head) began to reign in 1055 B.C., and died      1040 B.C.'; and further, that, according to the same authority,      '_Homer flourished_ when the Greeks were fond of his POETRY';      which, being interpreted, signifies that he flourished in 914      B.C., and, consequently, could have had no more to do with David      than to plant ivy over his grave, in some of his voyages to      Phoenicia.        \"I thank you for the suggestion. I knew the unforgetting      professor; and I do not doubt that he remembered David and Homer      as his near friends. But, of course, to such a memory, a century      or two might easily slip aside.        \"Now, did you look up Clement? And did you not forget the      Arundelian Marbles? For, if you will take the long estimates, you      will find that some folks think Homer lived as long ago as the      year 1150, and some that it was as 'short ago' as 850. And some      set David as long ago as 1170, and some bring him down to a      hundred and fifty years later. These are the long measures and the      short measures. So the long and short of it is, that you can keep      the two poets 320 years apart, while I have rather more than a      century which I can select any night of, for a bivouac scene, in      which to bring them together. Believe me, my dear Miss D., always      yours, &c.        \"Confess that you forgot the Arundelian Marbles!\"          THE SOUTH AMERICAN EDITOR      [I am tempted to include this little burlesque in this collection simply  in memory of the Boston Miscellany, the magazine in which it was  published, which won for itself a brilliant reputation in its short  career. There was not a large staff of writers for the Miscellany, but  many of the names then unknown have since won distinction. To quote them  in the accidental order in which I find them in the table of contents,  where they are arranged by the alphabetical order of the several papers,  the Miscellany contributors were Edward Everett, George Lunt, Nathan  Hale, Jr., Nathaniel Hawthorne, N.P. Willis, W.W. Story, J.R. Lowell,  C.N. Emerson, Alexander H. Everett, Sarah P. Hale, W.A. Jones, Cornelius  Matthews, Mrs. Kirkland, J.W. Ingraham, H.T. Tuckerman, Evart A.  Duyckinck, Francis A. Durivage, Mrs. J. Webb, Charles F. Powell, Charles  W. Storey, Lucretia P. Hale, Charles F. Briggs, William E. Channing,  Charles Lanman, G.H. Hastings, and Elizabeth B. Barrett, now Mrs.  Browning, some of whose earliest poems were published in this magazine.  These are all the contributors whose names appear, excepting the writers  of a few verses. They furnished nine tenths of the contents of the  magazine. The two Everetts, Powell, William Story, and my brother, who  was the editor, were the principal contributors. And I am tempted to say  that I think they all put some of their best work upon this magazine.    The misfortune of the Miscellany, I suppose, was that its publishers had  no capital. They had to resort to the claptraps of fashion-plates and  other engravings, in the hope of forcing an immediate sale upon persons  who, caring for fashion-plates, did not care for the literary character  of the enterprise. It gave a very happy escape-pipe, however, for the  high spirits of some of us who had just left college, and, through my  brother's kindness,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15869"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World Volume 2 (#11)"],[1," unarmed. In short, every thing conspired to make  us believe they meant to attack us as soon as we should be on shore; the  consequence of which was easily supposed; many of them must have been  killed and wounded, and we should hardly have escaped unhurt; two things I  equally wished to prevent. Since, therefore, they would not give us the  room required, I thought it was better to frighten them into it, than to  oblige them by the deadly effect of our fire-arms. I accordingly ordered a  musquet to be fired over the party on our right, which was by far the  strongest body; but the alarm it gave them was momentary. In an instant  they recovered themselves and began to display their weapons. One fellow  shewed us his backside, in a manner which plainly conveyed his meaning.    After this I ordered three or four more musquets to be fired. This was the  signal for the ship to fire a few great guns, which presently dispersed  them; and then we landed, and marked out the limits, on the right and left,  by a line. Our old friend stood his ground, though deserted by his two  companions, and I rewarded his confidence with a present. The natives came  gradually to us, seemingly in a more friendly manner; some even without  their weapons, but by far the greatest part brought them; and when we made  signs to lay them down, they gave us to understand that we must lay down  ours first. Thus all parties stood armed. The presents I made to the old  people, and to such as seemed to be of consequence, had little effect on  their conduct. They indeed climbed the cocoa-nut trees, and threw us down  the nuts, without requiring any thing for them; but I took care that they  should always have somewhat in return. I observed that many were afraid to  touch what belonged to us; and they seemed to have no notion of exchanging  one thing for another. I took the old man (whose name we now found to be  Paowang) to the woods, and made him understand, I wanted to cut down some  trees to take on board the ship; cutting some down at the same time, which  we put into one of our boats, together with a few small casks of water,  with a view of letting the people see what it was we chiefly wanted.  Paowang very readily gave his consent to cut wood; nor was there any one  who made the least objection. He only desired the cocoa-nut trees might not  be cut down. Matters being thus settled, we embarked and returned on board  to dinner, and, immediately after, they all dispersed. I never learnt that  any one was hurt by our shot, either on this or the preceding day; which  was a very happy circumstance. In the afternoon having landed again, we  loaded the launch with water, and having made three hauls with the seine,  caught upwards of three hundred pounds of mullet and other fish. It was  some time before any of the natives appeared, and not above twenty or  thirty at last, amongst whom was our trusty friend Paowang, who made us a  present of a small pig, which was the only one we got at this isle, or that  was offered to us.    During the night the volcano, which was about four miles to the west of us,  vomited up vast quantities of fire and smoke, as it had also done the night  before; and the flames were seen to rise above the hill which lay between  us and it. At every eruption it made a long rumbling noise like that of  thunder, or the blowing up of large mines. A heavy shower of rain, which  fell at this time, seemed to increase it; and the wind blowing from the  same quarter, the air was loaded with its ashes, which fell so thick that  every thing was covered with the dust. It was a kind of fine sand, or  stone, ground or burnt to powder, and was exceedingly troublesome to the  eyes.    Early in the morning of the 7th, the natives began again to assemble near  the watering-place, armed as usual, but not in such numbers as at first.  After breakfast, we landed, in order to cut wood and fill water. I found  many of the islanders much inclined to be friends with us, especially the  old people; on the other hand, most of the younger were daring and  insolent, and obliged us to keep to our arms. I staid till I saw no  disturbance was like to happen, and then returned to the ship, leaving the  party under the command of Lieutenants Clerke and Edgcumbe. When they came  on board to dinner, they informed me that the people continued to behave in  the same inconsistent manner as in the morning; but more especially one  man, whom Mr Edgcumbe was obliged to fire at, and believed he had struck  with a swan shot. After that the others behaved with more discretion; and  as soon as our people embarked they all retired. While we were sitting at  dinner an old man came on board, looked into many parts of the ship, and  then went ashore again.    In the afternoon, only a few of those who lived in the neighbourhood, with  whom we were now upon a tolerable footing, made their appearance at the  watering-place. Paowang brought us an axe which had been left by our  people, either in the woods or on the beach, and found by some of the  natives. A few other articles were afterwards returned to us, which either  they had stolen, or we had lost by our negligence, so careful were they now  not to offend us in this respect.    Early the next morning, I sent the launch, protected by a party of marines  in another boat, to take in ballast, which was wanted. This work was done  before breakfast; and after it, she was sent for wood and water, and with  her the people employed in this service, under the protection of a  serjeant's guard, which was now thought sufficient, as the natives seemed  to be pretty well reconciled to us. I was told, that they asked our people  to go home with them, on condition they stripped naked as they were. This  shews that they had no design to rob them, whatever other they might  have.    On the 9th, I sent the launch for more ballast, and the guard and wooders  to the usual place. With these I went myself, and found a good many of the  natives collected together, whose behaviour, though armed, was courteous  and obliging; so that there was no longer any occasion to mark out the  limits by a line; they observed them without this precaution. As it was  necessary for Mr Wales's instruments to remain on shore all the middle of  the day, the guard did not return to dinner, as they had done before, till  relieved by others. When I came off, I prevailed on a young man, whose name  was Wha-a-gou, to accompany me. Before dinner I shewed him every part of  the ship; but did not observe that any thing fixed his attention a moment,  or caused in him the least surprise. He had no knowledge of goats, dogs, or  cats, calling them all hogs (_Booga_ or _Boogas_). I made him a  present of a dog and a bitch, as he shewed a liking to that kind of animal.  Soon after he came on board, some of his friends followed in a canoe, and  enquired for him, probably doubtful of his safety. He looked out of the  quarter gallery, and having spoken to them, they went ashore, and quickly  returned with a cock, a little sugar-cane, and a few cocoa-nuts, as a  present to me. Though he sat down with us, he did but just taste our salt  pork, but eat pretty heartily of yam, and drank a glass of wine. After  dinner I made him presents, and then conducted him, ashore.    As soon as we landed, the youth and some of his friends took me by the  hand, with a view, as I understood, to conduct me to their habitations. We  had not gone far, before some of them, for what reason I know not, were  unwilling I should proceed; in consequence of which the whole company  stopped; and, if I was not mistaken, a person was dispatched for something  or other to give me; for I was desired to sit down and wait, which I  accordingly did. During this interval, several of our gentlemen passed us,  at which they shewed great uneasiness, and importuned me so much to order  them back, that I was at last obliged to comply. They were jealous of our  going up the country, or even along the shore of the harbour. While I was  waiting here, our friend Paowang came with a present of fruit and roots,  carried by about twenty men; in order, as I supposed, to make it appear the  greater. One had a small bunch of plantains, another a yam, a third a  cocoa-nut, etc.; but two men might have carried the whole with ease. This  present was in return for something I had given him in the morning;  however, I thought the least I could do now, was to pay the porters.    After I had dispatched Paowang, I returned to Wha-a-gou and his friends,  who were still for detaining me. They seemed to wait with great impatience  for something, and to be unwilling and ashamed to take away the two dogs,  without making me a return. As night was approaching, I pressed to be gone;  with which they complied, and so we parted.    The preceding day, Mr Forster learnt from the people the proper name of the  island, which they call Tanna; and this day I learnt from them the names of  those in the neighbourhood. The one we touched at last is called Erromango;  the small isle, which we discovered the morning we landed here, Immer; the  Table island to the east, discovered at the same time, Erronan or Footoona;  and an island which lies to the S.E. Annattom. All these islands are to be  seen from Tanna.    They gave us to understand, in a manner which I thought admitted of no  doubt, that they eat human flesh, and that circumcision was practised among  them. They began the subject of eating human flesh, of their own accord, by  asking us if we did; otherwise I should never have thought of asking them  such a question. I have heard people argue, that no nation could be  cannibals, if they had other flesh to eat, or did not want food; thus  deriving the custom from necessity. The people of this island can be under  no such necessity; they have fine pork and fowls, and plenty of roots and  fruits. But since we have not actually seen them eat human flesh, "]]]
