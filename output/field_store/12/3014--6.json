Bah, I will be a hand of wrath to fall on thee in after days.    LEADER.    Not so, if God in after days shall guide Orestes home again!    AIGISTHOS.    I know how men in exile feed on dreams...and know such food is vain.    LEADER.    Go forward and wax fat! Defile the right for this thy little hour!    AIGISTHOS.    I spare thee now.

P. 2, l. 28, Women's triumph cry.]--This cry of the women recurs several  times in the play: cf. p. 26, ll. 587 ff., p. 55, l. 1234. It is  conventionally represented by \"ololu\"; as the cry to Apollo, Paian is  \"I-e,\" l. 146, and Cassandra's sob is \"ototoi\" or \"otototoi,\" p. 47.    Pp. 3 f., ll. 40 ff.]--With this silent scene of Clytemnestra's, compare  the long silence of Cassandra below, and the silence of Prometheus in that  play until his torturers have left him. See the criticism of Aeschylus in  Aristophanes, _Frogs_, ll. 911-920, pp. 68, 69 in my translation.    P. 5, l. 104, Sign of the War-Way.]--i.e. an ominous sign seen by the army  as it started on its journey. In Homer, Iliad, ll. 305-329, it is a snake  which eats the nine young of a mother bird and then the mother, and is  turned into stone afterwards.--All through this chorus the language of the  prophet Calchas is intentionally obscure and riddling--the style of  prophesy.    P. 7, l. 146, But I-e, i-e.]--(Pronounce _Ee-ay_.) Calchas, catching sight  in his vision of the further consequences which Artemis will exact if she  fulfils the sign, calls on Apollo Paian, the Healer, to check her.    P. 7, l. 160, Zeus, whate'er He be.]--This conception of Zeus is expressed  also in Aeschylus' _Suppliant Women_, and was probably developed in the  Prometheus Trilogy. See my _Rise of the Greek Epic_, p. 291 (Ed. 2).    It is connected with the common Greek conception of the _Tritos Soter_--  the Saviour Third. First, He who sins; next, He who avenges; third, He who  saves. In vegetation worship it is the Old Year who has committed Hubris,  the sin of pride, in summer; the Winter who slays him; the New Year which  shall save. In mythology the three successive Rulers of Heaven are given  by Hesiod as Ouranos, Kronos, Zeus (cf. _Prometheus_, 965 ff.), but we  cannot tell if Aeschylus accepted the Hesiodic story. Cf. note on l. 246,  and Clytemnestra's blasphemy at l. 1387, p. 63.    P. 9, l. 192, Winds from Strymon.]--From the great river gorge of  Thrace, NNE; cf. below, l. 1418.    P. 9, l. 201, Artemis.]--Her name was terrible, because of its  suggestion. She demanded the sacrifice of Agamemnon's daughter, Iphigenia.  (See Euripides' two plays, _Iphigenia in Tauris_ and _Iphigenia in  Aulis_.) In other poets Agamemnon has generally committed some definite  sin against Artemis, but in Aeschylus the death of Iphigenia seems to be  merely one of the results of his acceptance of the Sign.    P. 10, l. 215, 'Tis a Rite of old.]--Literally \"it is Themis.\" Human  sacrifice had had a place in the primitive religion of Greece; hence  Agamemnon could not reject the demand of the soldiers as an obvious crime.  See _Rise of Greek Epic_, pp. 150-157.    P. 11, l. 246, The Third Cup.]--Regularly poured to Zeus Soter, the  Saviour, and accompanied by a paean or cry of joy.    P. 11, l. 256, This Heart of Argos, this frail Tower:]--i.e. themselves.    P. 11, l. 264, Glad-voiced.]--Clytemnestra is in extreme suspense, as  the return of Agamemnon will mean either her destruction or her  deliverance. At such a moment there must be no ill-omened word, so she  challenges fate.    P. 12, l. 276, A word within that hovereth without wings.]--i.e. a  presentiment. \"Winged words\" are words spoken, which fly from speaker to  hearer. A 'wingless' word is unspoken. The phrase occurs in Homer.    Pp. 13 ff., ll. 281 ff.]--Beacon Speech. There is no need to inquire  curiously into the practical possibility of this chain of beacons. Greek  tragedies do not care to be exact about this kind of detail. There may  well have been a tradition that Agamemnon, like the Great King of Persia,  used a chain of beacons across the Aegean.--Note how vividly  Clytemnestra's imagination is working in her excitement. She seems to see  before her every leaping light in the chain, just as in the next speech  she imagines the scene in Troy almost with the intensity of a vision.    P. 14, l. 314, Victory in the first as in the last.]--All are Victory  beacons; the spirit of Victory infects them all equally. Cf. l. 854 below,  where Agamemnon prays that the Victory which is now with him, or in him,  may abide.    P. 15, l. 348, A woman's word.]--Her hatred and fear of Agamemnon, making  her feel vividly the horrors of the sack and the peril overhanging the  conquerors, have carried her dangerously far. She checks herself and  apologizes for her womanlike anxiety. Cf. l. 1661, p. 77.    P. 18, ll. 409 ff., Seers they saw visions.]--A difficult and uncertain  passage. I think the seers attached to the royal household  (cf. _Libation-Bearers,_ l. 37, where they are summoned to read a dream)  were rather like what we call clairvoyants. Being consulted, they look  into some pool of liquid or the like; there they see gradually emerging  the palace, the injured King, the deserted room, and at last a wraith of  Helen herself, haunting the place.    P. 21, l. 487.]--This break in the action, covering a space of several  days, was first pointed out by Dr. Walter Headlam. Incidentally it removes  the gravest of the difficulties raised by Dr. Verrall in his famous essay  upon the plot of the _Agamemnon_.    P. 21, l. 495, Dry dust, own brother to the mire of war.]--i.e. \"I can see  by the state of his clothes, caked with dry dust which was once the mire  of battle, that he comes straight from the war and can speak with  knowledge.\" The Herald is probably (though perhaps not quite consistently)  conceived as having rushed post-haste with his news.    Pp. 22 ff., HERALD.]--The Herald bursts in overcome with excitement and  delight, full of love for his home and everything he sees. A marked  contrast to Agamemnon, ll. 810 ff. Note that his first speech confirms all  the worst fears suggested by Clytemnestra. Agamemnon has committed all the  sins she prayed against, and more. The terrible lines 527 ff., \"Till her  Gods' Houses, etc.,\" are very like a passage in the _Persae_, 811 ff.,  where exactly the same acts by the Persian invaders of Greece make their  future punishment inevitable.    P. 22, l. 509, Pythian Lord.]--Apollo is often a sinister figure in  tragedy. Cf. Sophocles _Oedipus_ , ll. 915 ff., pp. 52 ff., and the  similar scene, _Electra_, 655 ff. Here it is a shock to the Herald to come  suddenly on the god who was the chief enemy of the Greeks at Troy. One  feels Apollo an evil presence also in the Cassandra scene, 11. 1071 ff.,  pp. 47 ff.    P. 23, l. 530, Happy among men.]--The crown of his triumph! Early Greek  thought was always asking the question, What is human happiness? To the  Herald Agamemnon has achieved happiness if any one ever did. Cf. the  well-known story of Croesus asking Solon who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14426"],[0,"London to Ladysmith via Pretoria (#11)"],[1,"in order to be free to work at the wreckage. What  then? There was a wire fence between me and the horseman. Should I  continue to fly? The idea of another shot at such a short range decided  me. Death stood before me, grim sullen Death without his light-hearted  companion, Chance. So I held up my hand, and like Mr. Jorrocks's foxes,  cried 'Capivy.' Then I was herded with the other prisoners in a  miserable group, and about the same time I noticed that my hand was  bleeding, and it began to pour with rain.    Two days before I had written to an officer in high command at home,  whose friendship I have the honour to enjoy: 'There has been a great  deal too much surrendering in this war, and I hope people who do so will  not be encouraged.' Fate had intervened, yet though her tone was full of  irony she seemed to say, as I think Ruskin once said, 'It matters very  little whether your judgments of people are true or untrue, and very  much whether they are kind or unkind,' and repeating that I will make an  end.          CHAPTER VIII    PRISONERS OF WAR      Pretoria: November 24, 1899.    The position of a prisoner of war is painful and humiliating. A man  tries his best to kill another, and finding that he cannot succeed asks  his enemy for mercy. The laws of war demand that this should be  accorded, but it is impossible not to feel a sense of humbling  obligation to the captor from whose hand we take our lives. All military  pride, all independence of spirit must be put aside. These may be  carried to the grave, but not into captivity. We must prepare ourselves  to submit, to obey, to endure. Certain things--sufficient food and water  and protection during good behaviour--the victor must supply or be a  savage, but beyond these all else is favour. Favours must be accepted  from those with whom we have a long and bitter quarrel, from those who  feel fiercely that we seek to do them cruel injustice. The dog who has  been whipped must be thankful for the bone that is flung to him.    When the prisoners captured after the destruction of the armoured train  had been disarmed and collected in a group we found that there were  fifty-six unwounded or slightly wounded men, besides the more serious  cases lying on the scene of the fight. The Boers crowded round, looking  curiously at their prize, and we ate a little chocolate that by good  fortune--for we had had no breakfast--was in our pockets, and sat down  on the muddy ground to think. The rain streamed down from a dark leaden  sky, and the coats of the horses steamed in the damp. 'Voorwaerts,' said  a voice, and, forming in a miserable procession, two wretched officers,  a bare-headed, tattered Correspondent, four sailors with straw hats and  'H.M.S. Tartar' in gold letters on the ribbons--ill-timed  jauntiness--some fifty soldiers and volunteers, and two or three  railwaymen, we started, surrounded by the active Boer horsemen. Yet, as  we climbed the low hills that surrounded the place of combat I looked  back and saw the engine steaming swiftly away beyond Frere Station.  Something at least was saved from the ruin; information would be carried  to the troops at Estcourt, a good many of the troops and some of the  wounded would escape, the locomotive was itself of value, and perhaps in  saving all these things some little honour had been saved as well.    'You need not walk fast,' said a Boer in excellent English; 'take your  time.' Then another, seeing me hatless in the downpour, threw me a  soldier's cap--one of the Irish Fusilier caps, taken, probably, near  Ladysmith. So they were not cruel men, these enemy. That was a great  surprise to me, for I had read much of the literature of this land of  lies, and fully expected every hardship and indignity. At length we  reached the guns which had played on us for so many minutes--two  strangely long barrels sitting very low on carriages of four wheels,  like a break in which horses are exercised. They looked offensively  modern, and I wondered why our Army had not got field artillery with  fixed ammunition and 8,000 yards range. Some officers and men of the  Staats Artillerie, dressed in a drab uniform with blue facings,  approached us. The commander, Adjutant Roos--as he introduced  himself--made a polite salute. He regretted the unfortunate  circumstances of our meeting; he complimented the officers on their  defence--of course, it was hopeless from the first; he trusted his fire  had not annoyed us; we should, he thought, understand the necessity for  them to continue; above all he wanted to know how the engine had been  able to get away, and how the line could have been cleared of wreckage  under his guns. In fact, he behaved as a good professional soldier  should, and his manner impressed me.    We waited here near the guns for half an hour, and meanwhile the Boers  searched amid the wreckage for dead and wounded. A few of the wounded  were brought to where we were, and laid on the ground, but most of them  were placed in the shelter of one of the overturned trucks. As I write I  do not know with any certainty what the total losses were, but the Boers  say that they buried five dead, sent ten seriously wounded into  Ladysmith, and kept three severely wounded in their field ambulances.  Besides this, we are told that sixteen severely wounded escaped on the  engine, and we have with the prisoners seven men, including myself,  slightly wounded by splinters or injured in the derailment. If this be  approximately correct, it seems that the casualties in the hour and a  half of fighting were between thirty-five and forty: not many, perhaps,  considering the fire, but out of 120 enough at least.    After a while we were ordered to march on, and looking over the crest of  the hill a strange and impressive sight met the eye. Only about 300 men  had attacked the train, and I had thought that this was the enterprise  of a separate detachment, but as the view extended I saw that this was  only a small part of a large, powerful force marching south, under the  personal direction of General Joubert, to attack Estcourt. Behind every  hill, thinly veiled by the driving rain, masses of mounted men, arranged  in an orderly disorder, were halted, and from the rear long columns of  horsemen rode steadily forward. Certainly I did not see less than 3,000,  and I did not see nearly all. Evidently an important operation was in  progress, and a collision either at Estcourt or Mooi River impended.  This was the long expected advance: worse late than never.    Our captors conducted us to a rough tent which had been set up in a  hollow in one of the hills, and which we concluded was General Joubert's  headquarters. Here we were formed in a line, and soon surrounded by a  bearded crowd of Boers cloaked in mackintosh. I explained that I was a  Special Correspondent, and asked to see General Joubert. But in the  throng it was impossible to tell who were the superiors. My credentials  were taken from me by a man who said he was a Field Cornet, and who  promised that they should be laid before the General forthwith.  Meanwhile we waited in the rain, and the Boers questioned us. My  certificate as a correspondent bore a name better known than liked in  the Transvaal. Moreover, some of the private soldiers had been talking.  'You are the son of Lord Randolph Churchill?' said a Scottish Boer,  abruptly. I did not deny the fact. Immediately there was much talking,  and all crowded round me, looking and pointing, while I heard my name  repeated on every side. 'I am a newspaper correspondent,' I said, 'and  you ought not to hold me prisoner.' The Scottish Boer laughed. 'Oh,' he  said, 'we do not catch lords' sons every day.' Whereat they all  chuckled, and began to explain that I should be allowed to play football  at Pretoria.    All this time I was expecting to be brought before General Joubert, from  whom I had some hopes I should obtain assurances that my character as a  press correspondent would be respected. But suddenly a mounted man rode  up and ordered the prisoners to march away towards Colenso. The escort,  twenty horsemen, closed round us. I addressed their leader, and  demanded either that I should be taken before the General, or that my  credentials should be given back. But the so-called Field Cornet was not  to be seen. The only response was, 'Voorwaerts,' and as it seemed  useless, undignified, and even dangerous to discuss the matter further  with these people, I turned and marched off with the rest.    We tramped for six hours across sloppy fields and along tracks deep and  slippery with mud, while the rain fell in a steady downpour and soaked  everyone to the skin. The Boer escort told us several times not to hurry  and to go our own pace, and once they allowed us to halt for a few  moments. But we had had neither food nor water, and it was with a  feeling of utter weariness that I saw the tin roofs of Colenso rise in  the distance. We were put into a corrugated iron shed near the station,  the floors of which were four inches deep with torn railway forms and  account books. Here we flung ourselves down exhausted, and what with the  shame, the disappointment, the excitement of the morning, the misery of  the present, and physical weakness, it seemed that love of life was  gone, and I thought almost with envy of a soldier I had seen during the  fight lying quite still on the embankment, secure in the calm philosophy  of death from 'the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.'    After the Boers had lit two fires they opened one of the doors of the  shed and told us we might come forth and dry ourselves. A newly  slaughtered ox lay on the ground, and strips of his flesh were given to  us. These we toasted on sticks over the fire and ate greedily, though  since the animal had been alive five minutes before one felt a kind of  cannibal. Other Boers not of our escort who were occupying Colenso came  to look at us. With two of "]]]
