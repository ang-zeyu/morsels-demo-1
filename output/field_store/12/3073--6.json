But to be massacred in bed,  knifed, in the dark, shot in the back, ambushed in any manner--not one  of these miserable ends must be the last record of Vaughn Steele.    He promised me in a way that made me wonder if he would ever sleep again  or turn his back on anyone--made me wonder too, at the menace in his  voice. Steele seemed likely to be torn two ways, and already there was a  hint of future desperation.    It was agreed that I make cautious advances to Hoden and Morton, and  when I could satisfy myself of their trustworthiness reveal my identity  to them. Through this I was to cultivate Zimmer, and then other ranchers  whom we should decide could be let into the secret.    It was not only imperative that we learn through them clues by which we  might eventually fix guilt on the rustler gang, but also just as  imperative that we develop a band of deputies to help us when the fight  began.    Steele, now that he was back in Linrock, would have the center of the  stage, with all eyes upon him. We agreed, moreover, that the bolder the  front now the better the chance of ultimate success. The more nerve he  showed the less danger of being ambushed, the less peril in facing  vicious men.    But we needed a jail. Prisoners had to be corraled after arrest, or the  work would be useless, almost a farce, and there was no possibility of  repeating trips to Del Rio.    We could not use an adobe house for a jail, because that could be easily  cut out of or torn down.    Finally I remembered an old stone house near the end of the main street;  it had one window and one door, and had been long in disuse. Steele  would rent it, hire men to guard and feed his prisoners; and if these  prisoners bribed or fought their way to freedom, that would not injure  the great principle for which he stood.    Both Steele and I simultaneously, from different angles of reasoning,  had arrived at a conviction of Sampson's guilt. It was not so strong as  realization; rather a divination.    Long experience in detecting, in feeling the hidden guilt of men, had  sharpened our senses for that particular thing. Steele acknowledged a  few mistakes in his day; but I, allowing for the same strength of  conviction, had never made a single mistake.    But conviction was one thing and proof vastly another. Furthermore, when  proof was secured, then came the crowning task--that of taking desperate  men in a wild country they dominated.    Verily, Steele and I had our work cut out for us. However, we were  prepared to go at it with infinite patience and implacable resolve.  Steele and I differed only in the driving incentive; of course, outside  of that one binding vow to save the Ranger Service.    He had a strange passion, almost an obsession, to represent the law of  Texas, and by so doing render something of safety and happiness to the  honest pioneers.    Beside Steele I knew I shrunk to a shadow. I was not exactly a heathen,  and certainly I wanted to help harassed people, especially women and  children; but mainly with me it was the zest, the thrill, the hazard,  the matching of wits--in a word, the adventure of the game.    Next morning I rode with the young ladies. In the light of Sally's  persistently flagrant advances, to which I was apparently blind, I saw  that my hard-won victory over self was likely to be short-lived.    That possibility made me outwardly like ice. I was an attentive,  careful, reliable, and respectful attendant, seeing to the safety of my  charges; but the one-time gay and debonair cowboy was a thing of the  past.    Sally, womanlike, had been a little--a very little--repentant; she had  showed it, my indifference had piqued her; she had made advances and  then my coldness had roused her spirit. She was the kind of girl to  value most what she had lost, and to throw consequences to the winds in  winning it back.    When I divined this I saw my revenge. To be sure, when I thought of it  I had no reason to want revenge. She had been most gracious to me.    But there was the catty thing she had said about being kissed again by  her admirers. Then, in all seriousness, sentiment aside, I dared not  make up with her.    So the cold and indifferent part I played was imperative.    We halted out on the ridge and dismounted for the usual little rest.  Mine I took in the shade of a scrubby mesquite. The girls strolled away  out of sight. It was a drowsy day, and I nearly fell asleep.    Something aroused me--a patter of footsteps or a rustle of skirts. Then  a soft thud behind me gave me at once a start and a thrill. First I saw  Sally's little brown hands on my shoulders. Then her head, with hair all  shiny and flying and fragrant, came round over my shoulder, softly  smoothing my cheek, until her sweet, saucy, heated face was right under  my eyes.    \"Russ, don't you love me any more?\" she whispered.          Chapter 4    STEELE BREAKS UP THE PARTY      That night, I saw Steele at our meeting place, and we compared notes and  pondered details of our problem.    Steele had rented the stone house to be used as a jail. While the  blacksmith was putting up a door and window calculated to withstand many  onslaughts, all the idlers and strangers in town went to see the sight.  Manifestly it was an occasion for Linrock. When Steele let it be known  that he wanted to hire a jailer and a guard this caustically humorous  element offered itself _en masse_. The men made a joke out of it.    When Steele and I were about to separate I remembered a party that was  to be given by Miss Sampson, and I told him about it. He shook his head  sadly, almost doubtfully.    Was it possible that Sampson could be a deep eyed, cunning scoundrel,  the true leader of the cattle rustlers, yet keep that beautiful and  innocent girl out on the frontier and let her give parties to sons and  daughters of a community he had robbed? To any but remorseless Rangers  the idea was incredible.    Thursday evening came in spite of what the girls must have regarded as  an interminably dragging day.    It was easy to differentiate their attitudes toward this party. Sally  wanted to look beautiful, to excell all the young ladies who were to  attend, to attach to her train all the young men, and have them fighting  to dance with her. Miss Sampson had an earnest desire to open her  father's house to the people of Linrock, to show that a daughter had  come into his long cheerless home, to make the evening one of pleasure  and entertainment.    I happened to be present in the parlor, was carrying in some flowers for  final decoration, when Miss Sampson learned that her father had just  ridden off with three horsemen whom Dick, who brought the news, had not  recognized.    In her keen disappointment she scarcely heard Dick's concluding remark  about the hurry of the colonel. My sharp ears, however, took this in and  it was thought-provoking. Sampson was known to ride off at all hours,  yet this incident seemed unusual.    At eight o'clock the house and porch and patio were ablaze with lights.  Every lantern and lamp on the place, together with all that could be  bought and borrowed, had been brought into requisition.    The cowboys arrived first, all dressed in their best, clean shaven, red  faced, bright eyed, eager for the fun to commence. Then the young people  from town, and a good sprinkling of older people, came in a steady  stream.    Miss Sampson received them graciously, excused her father's absence, and  bade them be at home.    The music, or the discordance that went by that name, was furnished by  two cowboys with banjos and an antediluvian gentleman with a fiddle.  Nevertheless, it was music that could be danced to, and there was no  lack of enthusiasm.    I went from porch to parlor and thence to patio, watching and amused.  The lights and the decorations of flowers, the bright dresses and the  flashy scarfs of the cowboys furnished a gay enough scene to a man of  lonesome and stern life like mine. During the dance there was a steady,  continuous shuffling tramp of boots, and during the interval following a  steady, low hum of merry talk and laughter.    My wandering from place to place, apart from my usual careful  observation, was an unobtrusive but, to me, a sneaking pursuit of Sally  Langdon.    She had on a white dress I had never seen with a low neck and short  sleeves, and she looked so sweet, so dainty, so altogether desirable,  that I groaned a hundred times in my jealousy. Because, manifestly,  Sally did not intend to run any risk of my not seeing her in her glory,  no matter where my eyes looked.    A couple of times in promenading I passed her on the arm of some proud  cowboy or gallant young buck from town, and on these occasions she  favored her escort with a languishing glance that probably did as much  damage to him as to me.    Presently she caught me red-handed in my careless, sauntering pursuit of  her, and then, whether by intent or from indifference, she apparently  deigned me no more notice. But, quick to feel a difference in her, I  marked that from that moment her gaiety gradually merged into  coquettishness, and soon into flirtation.    Then, just to see how far she would go, perhaps desperately hoping she  would make me hate her, I followed her shamelessly from patio to parlor,  porch to court, even to the waltz.    To her credit, she always weakened when some young fellow got her in a  corner and tried to push the flirting to extremes. Young Waters was the  only one lucky enough to kiss her, and there was more of strength in his  conquest of her than any decent fellow could be proud of.    When George Wright sought Sally out there was added to my jealousy a  real anxiety. I had brushed against Wright more than once that evening.  He was not drunk, yet under the influence of liquor.    Sally, however, evidently did not discover that, because, knowing her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15586"],[0,"India, Old and New (#11)"],[1,"ever breaking up.          CHAPTER III    MAHOMEDAN DOMINATION      Of all the great religions that have shaped and are still shaping the  destinies of the human race, Islam alone was borne forth into the world  on a great wave of forceful conquest. Out of the sun-scorched deserts of  Arabia, with the Koran in the one hand and the sword in the other, the  followers of Mahomed swept eastward to the confines of China, northward  through Asia Minor into Eastern Europe, and westward through Africa into  Spain, and even into the heart of medieval France. But it was not till  the beginning of the eleventh century that the Mahomedan flood began to  roll down into India from the north with the overwhelming momentum of  fierce fanaticism and primitive cupidity behind it--at first mere short  but furious irruptions, like the seventeen raids of Mahmud of Ghazni  between 1001 and 1026, then a more settled tide of conquest, now and  again checked for a time by dissensions amongst the conquerors quite as  much as by some brilliant rally of Hindu religious and patriotic  fervour, but sweeping on again with a fresh impetus until the flood had  spread itself over the whole of the vast peninsula, except the extreme  south. For three centuries one wave of invasion followed another, one  dynasty of conquerors displaced another, but whether under Turki or  Afghan rulers, under Slave kings or under the house of Tughluk, there  was seldom a pause in the consolidation of Mahomedan power, seldom a  break in the long-drawn tale of plunder and carnage, cruelty and lust,  unfolded in the annals of the earlier Mahomedan dynasties that ruled at  Delhi. One notable victory Prithvi Raja, the forlorn hope of Hindu  chivalry, won at Thanesvar in 1192 over the Afghan hordes that had  already driven the last of the Ghaznis from Lahore and were sweeping  down upon Delhi, but in the following year the gallant young Rajput was  crushingly defeated, captured, and done to death by a ruthless foe. Then  Delhi fell, and Kutub-ed-Din, in turn the favourite slave, the trusted  lieutenant and the deputed viceroy of the Afghan conqueror, growing  tired of serving an absent master, within a few years threw off his  allegiance. In 1206 he proclaimed himself Emperor of Delhi. That the  Slave Dynasty which he founded was in one respect at least not unworthy  of empire, in spite of the stigma attaching to its worse than servile  origin, the Kutub Minar and the splendid mosque of which it forms part  are there to show. The great minaret, which was begun by Kutub-ed-Din  himself, upon whose name it has conferred an enduring lustre not  otherwise deserved, is beyond comparison the loftiest and the noblest  from which the Musulman call to prayer has ever gone forth, nor  is the mosque which it overlooks unworthy to have been called  _Kuwwet-el-Islam_, the Might of Islam. To make room for it the Hindu  temples, erected by the Rajput builders of the Red Fort, were torn down,  and the half-effaced figures on the columns of the mosque, and many  other conventional designs peculiar to Hindu architecture, betray  clearly the origin of the materials used in its construction. But the  general conception, and especially the grand lines of the screen of  arches on the western side, are essentially and admirably Mahomedan. On  a slighter scale, but profusely decorated and of exquisite workmanship,  is the tomb of Altamsh, Kutub-ed-Din's successor, and like him  originally a mere favourite slave.    It had been well for these Slave kings had no other record survived of  them than those which they have left in stone and marble. Great  builders and mighty warriors they were in the cause of Allah and his  Prophet, but their depravity was only exceeded by their cruelty. The  story of the whole dynasty is a long-drawn tale of horrors until the  wretched Kaikobad, having turned Delhi for a short three years into a  house of ill-fame, was dragged out of his bed and flung into the Jumna,  his infant child murdered, and the house of Khilji set up where the  Slave kings had reigned. It was the second of these Khilji princes,  Ala-ud-Din, who built, alongside of Kutub-ed-Din's mosque, the Alai  Darwazah, the monumental gateway which is not only an exceptionally  beautiful specimen of external polychromatic decoration, but, to quote  Fergusson, \"displays the Pathan style at its period of greatest  perfection, when the Hindu masons had learned to fit their exquisite  style of ornamentation to the forms of their foreign masters.\" Yet the  atrocities of his twenty years' reign, which was one of almost unbroken  conquest and plunder, wellnigh surpass those of the Slave kings. He had  seized the throne by murdering his old uncle in the act of clasping his  hand, and his own death was, it is said, hastened by poison administered  to him by his favourite eunuch and trusted lieutenant, K[=a]fur, who had  ministered to his most ignoble passions. To the Khiljis succeeded the  Tughluks, and the white marble dome of Tughluk Shah's tomb still stands  out conspicuous beyond the broken line of grim grey walls which were  once Tughlukabad. The Khiljis had been overthrown, but the curse of a  Mahomedan saint, Sidi Dervish, whose fame has endured to the present  day, still rested upon the Delhi in which they had dwelt. So Mahomed  Tughluk built unto himself a new and stronger city, but he did nothing  else to avert the curse. Indeed, he invented a form of man-hunt which  for sheer devilish cruelty has been only once matched in the West by the  _cani del duca_ when the crazy Gian Maria ruled in Milan. Well may his  milder successor, Firuz Shah, have removed to yet another new capital.  Well may he have sought to disarm the wrath to come by pious deeds and  lavish charities. The record he kept of them is not without a certain  naive pathos:         Under the guidance of the Almighty, I arranged that the heirs of       those persons who had been slain in the reign of my late Lord and       Patron, Sultan Mahomed Shah, and those who had been deprived of a       limb, nose, eye, hand, or foot, should be reconciled to the late       Sultan and appeased by gifts, so that they executed deeds declaring       their satisfaction, duly attested by witnesses. These deeds were       put into a chest, which was placed at the head of the late Sultan's       grave in the hope that God in his great mercy would show his       clemency to my late friend and patron and make those persons feel       reconciled to him.    The curse fell upon Delhi in the reign of the next Tughluk, Sultan  Mahmud. Timur, with his Mongolian horsemen, swooped down through the  northern passes upon Delhi, slaying Mahomedans and Hindus alike and  plundering and burning on all sides as he came. Opposite to the famous  ridge, where four and a half centuries later England was to nail her  flag to the mast, he forded the Jumna, having previously slain all  captives with his army to the number of 100,000. Mahmud's army, with its  125 elephants, could not withstand the shock. Timur entered Delhi, which  for five whole days was given over to slaughter and pillage. Then,  having celebrated his victory by a great carouse, he proceeded to the  marble mosque which Firuz Tughluk's piety had erected in atonement of  his grim predecessor's sins, and solemnly offered up a \"sincere and  humble tribute of praise\" to God. Within a year he disappeared in the  same whirl-wind of destruction through the northern passes into his  native wilds of Central Asia, leaving desolation and chaos behind him.    From so terrific a blow Delhi was slow to recover. A group of  picturesque domes marks the resting-place of some of the Seyyid and Lodi  kings who in turn ruled or misruled the shrunken dominions which still  owned allegiance to Delhi. The achievement of a centralised Mahomedan  empire was delayed for nearly two centuries. But the aggressive vitality  of Islam had not been arrested, and out of the anarchy which followed  Timur's meteoric raid Mahomedan soldiers of fortune built up for  themselves independent kingdoms and principalities and founded dynasties  which each had their own brief moment of power and magnificence. In all  these states, which spread right across Middle India from the Arabian  Sea to the Gulf of Bengal, Islam remained the dominant power; but, even  whilst trampling upon Hinduism, it did not escape altogether the  inevitable results of increasing contact with an older and more refined  civilisation. Amidst rapine and bloodshed and the constant clash of  arms, it was a period of intense artistic activity which, as usual in  the countries conquered by Islam, expressed itself chiefly in terms of  stone and marble, and though Hinduism never triumphed as classical  paganism, for instance, triumphed for a time in Papal Rome, the steady  and all-pervading revival of its influence can be traced from capital to  capital, wherever these Mahomedan _podestas_ established their seat of  government during that Indian _Cinque Cento_, which corresponds in time  with, and recalls in many ways, though at best distantly, the Italian  _Cinque Cento_, with its strange blend of refined luxury and cruelty, of  high artistic achievement and moral depravity.    To the present day almost all those cities--some of them now mere cities  of the dead, such as Golconda and Gaur and Mandu, some, such as Bijapur  and Bidar and Ahmednagar and Ahmedabad, still living and even  flourishing--bear witness to the genius of their makers. From motives of  political expediency, the Mahomedan rulers of those days, whether  Bahmanis or Ahmed Shahis or Adil Shahis or whatever else they were  called, were fain to reckon with their Hindu subjects. Wholesale  conversions to the creed of the conquerors, whether spontaneous or  compulsory, introduced new elements into the ruling race itself; for  converted Hindus, even when they rose to high positions of trust,  retained many of their own"]]]
