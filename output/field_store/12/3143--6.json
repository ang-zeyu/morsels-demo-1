Champlain then resumed his colonization work, and had an interview with  de Monts, in order to induce him to take some action in his favour.  Although the profits to be realized from the enterprise were not  certain, it seemed probable that fur-trading, and developing the  resources of the country, might become advantageous. The expenses of the  undertaking were also small: a few barrels of biscuits, of pease and  cider would be found sufficient to sustain the fifteen or twenty men who  formed the nucleus of the colony. From year to year Champlain hoped to  be able to monopolize the fur trade, not for himself, but for the  company of de Monts.    The vessels which were equipped for the expedition were ready to sail on  March 1st, 1611. The passage was very rough, and when about eight  leagues distant from the Great Banks of Newfoundland, the vessels were  in great danger through the number of icebergs which were encountered.  The cold was so intense that it was found difficult to navigate the  vessel. While in the vicinity of Newfoundland, they communicated with a  French ship, on board of which was Biencourt, son of Poutrincourt, who  was bound for Port Royal to meet his father. He had left France three  months previously, and had been unable to find his way to the Acadian  coast.    After having sighted Gaspe, Champlain arrived at Tadousac on May 13th,  where he found all the country covered with snow. The savages were  informed of Champlain's arrival by cannon shot, and they soon made their  appearance. They stated that three or four trading vessels had arrived  within the last eight days, but that their business had been a failure  on account of the scarcity of furs.    Champlain proceeded at once to Quebec, where he found everything in good  order, and neither du Parc nor his companions had suffered from any  sickness. Game had been abundant during the whole winter. Champlain  intended to visit Three Rivers, but Batiscan said that he would not be  prepared to conduct him there until next year. As he was unable to carry  out his designs, Champlain took with him Savignon and one Frenchman, and  visited the great fall. He made a careful examination of the country,  and says:--    \"But in all that I saw I found no place more favourable than a little  spot to which barques and shallops can easily ascend with the help of a  strong wind, or by taking a winding course, in consequence of the  strong current. But above this place, which we named _La Place Royale_,  at the distance of a league from Mont Royal, there are a great many  little rocks and shoals which are very dangerous.... Formerly savages  tilled these lands.... There is a large number of other fine pastures,  where any number of cattle can graze.... After a careful examination, we  found this place one of the finest on this river. I accordingly gave  orders to cut down and clear up the woods in the Place Royale, so as to  level it and prepare it for building.\"    This was the beginning of Montreal, the wealthiest city of Canada.    Champlain constructed a wall four feet thick, three or four feet high,  and thirty feet long. This fort was placed on an elevation twelve feet  higher than the level of the soil, so that it was safe from inundation.  Champlain named the island Ste. Helene, in honour of his wife, and he  found that a strong town could be built there. To-day this island is a  favourite resort for the inhabitants of Montreal, and it is an ornament  to the harbour of the large city.    On June 13th two hundred Hurons arrived at Sault St. Louis, so called  from a young Frenchman named Louis, who was drowned in the rapids a few  days before. The Hurons were under the command of Ochateguin, Iroquet  and Tregouaroti. The latter was a brother of Savignon, the young Huron  whom Champlain had taken with him to France. The interview, which  lasted some time, was most cordial. The Indians said that they felt  somewhat uneasy on seeing so many Frenchmen who were not specially  united, and that they had desired to see Champlain alone, towards whom  they were as kindly disposed as towards their own children.    Champlain questioned them on the sources of the great river, and on  their own country. Four of them declared that they had seen a large sea  at a great distance from their village. After exchanging their peltry  with Champlain's consent, some of the Hurons left to follow the  war-path, while others returned to their own country. This interview  occurred on July 18th, 1611. On the same day Champlain set out for  Quebec, where he arrived on the nineteenth. Here he found that certain  necessary repairs had to be made. He also planted some rose bushes, and  caused some oak wood to be placed on board a vessel for shipment to  France, as a specimen of the wood of the new colony, which he considered  suitable not only for marine wainscoting, but also for windows and  doors.    Champlain sailed from Quebec on July 20th, and arrived at La Rochelle on  September 16th. De Monts was at Pons, in Saintonge, at this time, and it  was here that he received a visit from Champlain. After listening to  Champlain's narrative of his proceedings, de Monts decided to proceed to  court to arrange matters. He held a conference with the merchants at  Fontainebleau, but he found that they were unwilling to continue to  support the enterprise. He concluded a bargain with them for what  remained in the Quebec settlement by the payment of a certain sum of  money, and from that date de Monts' company ceased to exist. There was  only one man who had faith in the future of the colony, and who remained  staunch to its interests under all difficulties; this man was Champlain.    De Monts had shown great energy in opposing the impediments to the  undertaking which were offered by the merchants of Rouen, St. Malo and  La Rochelle, and as he hoped to regain the money which he had already  expended, he considered that it was time to receive assistance from the  king. Louis XIII listened attentively to de Monts' requests, but he did  not accede to them. De Monts, therefore, informed Champlain that he was  compelled to abandon the enterprise. This was the last interview between  these two men.    Champlain was now left to his own resources for continuing his work. His  personal means were small, and far too slender to enable him to support  a colony in its infancy. The thought of abandoning the settlement was  repugnant to him, not only on account of the years of labour he had  bestowed upon it, but also because he felt that there was every chance  of success with the aid of rich and powerful men.    At the commencement of his description of his first voyage to Canada,  Champlain enumerates the reasons which induced him to continue his work  of discovery: \"The desire which I have always had of making new  discoveries in New France, for the good, profit and glory of the French  name, and at the same time to lead the poor natives to the knowledge of  God, has led me to seek more and more for the greater facility of this  undertaking, which can only be secured by means of good regulations.\"    Then he drew up a statement,[14] which he handed to President Jeannin,  whom he knew to be well disposed.    The president encouraged Champlain, but in order that he might not be  deceived, he thought it better that Champlain should act under the  authority of some man whose influence would be sufficient to protect him  against the jealousy of the merchants. Champlain, therefore, addressed  himself through M. de Beaulieu, councillor and almoner in ordinary to  the king, to Charles de Bourbon, Comte de Soissons, then governor of  Dauphine and Normandy. He urged upon the count the importance of the  undertaking, and explained the best means of regulating it, claiming  that the disorders which had hitherto existed threatened to ruin the  enterprise, and to bring dishonour to the name of the French.    After having examined the map of the country, and studied the details of  the scheme, Soissons promised, under the sanction of the king, to assume  the protectorate of the undertaking. Louis XIII listened favourably to  the petition of his loyal subject, and granted the direction and control  of the settlement to the count, who in due course honoured Champlain  with the lieutenancy. Soon after this event, however, the count died,  and His Majesty committed the direction of affairs to Monseigneur Le  Prince de Conde, who retained Champlain as his lieutenant.    After having caused his commission to be posted in all the ports of  Normandy, Champlain sailed from France on March 6th, in the vessel of  Pont-Grave, and arrived at Pointe aux Vaches, near Tadousac, on April  24th, 1613.    The savages came on board the vessel and inquired for Champlain. Some  one replied that he had remained in France. On hearing this, an old man  approached Champlain, who was walking in a corner of the vessel, and  examined the scar on his ear, which was caused by an arrow wound while  fighting for the Indians. On seeing this, the old man recognized  Champlain, and expressed his feelings by shouts of delight, in which he  was joined by his companions, who said, \"Your people are awaiting you in  the harbour of Tadousac.\"    On arriving at Tadousac, Champlain found that these Indians were almost  dying of hunger, and after having affixed the arms and commission of His  Majesty to a post in the port, he proceeded to Quebec, which he reached  on May 7th. The people of the settlement were all in good health, and  the winter having been less severe than usual, the river had not frozen  once. The leaves were beginning to appear on the trees, and the fields  were already decked with flowers.    On the 13th of the month Champlain left for the Falls of St. Louis,  which he reached eight days afterwards. Here he met a number of the  Algonquins, who informed him that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17144"],[0,"The House of the Vampire (#11)"],[1,"between us no further  community of interest; henceforth, I knew, our lives must move in  totally different spheres. You remember that day when we said good-bye?\"    \"You mean that day when I lay before you on my knees,\" she corrected  him.    \"That day I buried my last dream of personal happiness. I would have  gladly raised you from the floor, but love was utterly gone. If I am  tenderer to-day than I am wont to be, it is because you mean so much to  me as the symbol of my renunciation. When I realised that I could not  even save the thing I loved from myself, I became hardened and cruel to  others. Not that I know no kindly feeling, but no qualms of conscience  lay their prostrate forms across my path. There is nothing in life for  me but my mission.\"    His face was bathed in ecstasy. The pupils were luminous, large and  threatening. He had the look of a madman or a prophet.    After a while Ethel remarked: \"But you have grown into one of the  master-figures of the age. Why not be content with that? Is there no  limit to your ambition?\"    Reginald smiled: \"Ambition! Shakespeare stopped when he had reached his  full growth, when he had exhausted the capacity of his contemporaries. I  am not yet ready to lay down my pen and rest.\"    \"And will you always continue in this criminal course, a murderer of  other lives?\"    He looked her calmly in the face. \"I do not know.\"    \"Are you the slave of your unknown god?\"    \"We are all slaves, wire-pulled marionettes: You, Ernest, I. There is  no freedom on the face of the earth nor above. The tiger that tears a  lamb is not free, I am not free, you are not free. All that happens must  happen; no word that is said is said in vain, in vain is raised no  hand.\"    \"Then,\" Ethel retorted, eagerly, \"if I attempted to wrest your victim  from you, I should also be the tool of your god?\"    \"Assuredly. But I am his chosen.\"    \"Can you--can you not set him free?\"    \"I need him--a little longer. Then he is yours.\"    \"But can you not, if I beg you again on my knees, at least loosen his  chains before he is utterly ruined?\"    \"It is beyond my power. If I could not rescue you, whom I loved, what in  heaven or on earth can save him from his fate? Besides, he will not be  utterly ruined. It is only a part of him that I absorb. In his soul are  chords that I have not touched. They may vibrate one day, when he has  gathered new strength. You, too, would have spared yourself much pain  had you striven to attain success in different fields--not where I had  garnered the harvest of a lifetime. It is only a portion of his talent  that I take from him. The rest I cannot harm. Why should he bury that  remainder?\"    His eyes strayed through the window to the firmament, as if to say that  words could no more bend his indomitable will than alter the changeless  course of the stars.    Ethel had half-forgotten the wrong she herself had suffered at his  hands. He could not be measured by ordinary standards, this dazzling  madman, whose diseased will-power had assumed such uncanny proportions.  But here a young life was at stake. In her mind's eye she saw Reginald  crush between his relentless hands the delicate soul of Ernest Fielding,  as a magnificent carnivorous flower might close its glorious petals upon  a fly.    Love, all conquering love, welled up in her. She would fight for Ernest  as a tiger cat fights for its young. She would place herself in the way  of the awful force that had shattered her own aspirations, and save, at  any cost, the brilliant boy who did not love her.          XXII      The last rays of the late afternoon sun fell slanting through Ernest's  window. He was lying on his couch, in a leaden, death-like slumber that,  for the moment at least, was not even perturbed by the presence of  Reginald Clarke.    The latter was standing at the boy's bedside, calm, unmoved as ever. The  excitement of his conversation with Ethel had left no trace on the  chiselled contour of his forehead. Smilingly fastening an orchid of an  indefinable purple tint in his evening coat, radiant, buoyant with life,  he looked down upon the sleeper. Then he passed his hand over Ernest's  forehead, as if to wipe off beads of sweat. At the touch of his hand the  boy stirred uneasily. When it was not withdrawn his countenance twitched  in pain. He moaned as men moan under the influence of some anaesthetic,  without possessing the power to break through the narrow partition that  separates them from death on the one side and from consciousness on the  other. At last a sigh struggled to his seemingly paralysed lips, then  another. Finally the babbling became articulate.    \"For God's sake,\" he cried, in his sleep, \"take that hand away!\"    And all at once the benignant smile on Reginald's features was changed  to a look of savage fierceness. He no longer resembled the man of  culture, but a disappointed, snarling beast of prey. He took his hand  from Ernest's forehead and retired cautiously through the half-open  door.    Hardly had he disappeared when Ernest awoke. For a moment he looked  around, like a hunted animal, then sighed with relief and buried his  head in his hand. At that moment a knock at the door was heard, and  Reginald re-entered, calm as before.    \"I declare,\" he exclaimed, \"you have certainly been sleeping the sleep  of the just.\"    \"It isn't laziness,\" Ernest replied, looking up rather pleased at the  interruption. \"But I've a splitting headache.\"    \"Perhaps those naps are not good for your health.\"    \"Probably. But of late I have frequently found it necessary to exact  from the day-hours the sleep which the night refuses me. I suppose it is  all due to indigestion, as you have suggested. The stomach is the source  of all evil.\"    \"It is also the source of all good. The Greeks made it the seat of the  soul. I have always claimed that the most important item in a great  poet's biography is an exact reproduction of his menu.\"    \"True, a man who eats a heavy beefsteak for breakfast in the morning is  incapable of writing a sonnet in the afternoon.\"    \"Yes,\" Reginald added, \"we are what we eat and what our forefathers have  eaten before us. I ascribe the staleness of American poetry to the  griddle-cakes of our Puritan ancestors. I am sorry we cannot go deeper  into the subject at present. But I have an invitation to dinner where I  shall study, experimentally, the influence of French sauces on my  versification.\"    \"Good-bye.\"    \"Au revoir.\" And, with a wave of the hand, Reginald left the room.    When the door had closed behind him, Ernest's thoughts took a more  serious turn. The tone of light bantering in which the preceding  conversation had taken place had been assumed on his part. For the last  few weeks evil dreams had tortured his sleep and cast their shadow upon  his waking hours. They had ever increased in reality, in intensity and  in hideousness. Even now he could see the long, tapering fingers that  every night were groping in the windings of his brain. It was a  well-formed, manicured hand that seemed to reach under his skull,  carefully feeling its way through the myriad convolutions where thought  resides.    And, oh, the agony of it all! A human mind is not a thing of stone, but  alive, horribly alive to pain. What was it those fingers sought, what  mysterious treasures, what jewels hidden in the under-layer of his  consciousness? His brain was like a human gold-mine, quaking under the  blow of the pick and the tread of the miner. The miner! Ah, the miner!  Ceaselessly, thoroughly, relentlessly, he opened vein after vein and  wrested untold riches from the quivering ground; but each vein was a  live vein and each nugget of gold a thought!    No wonder the boy was a nervous wreck. Whenever a tremulous nascent idea  was formulating itself, the dream-hand clutched it and took it away,  brutally severing the fine threads that bind thought to thought. And  when the morning came, how his head ached! It was not an acute pain, but  dull, heavy, incessant.    These sensations, Ernest frequently told himself, were morbid fancies.  But then, the monomaniac who imagines that his arms have been mangled or  cut from his body, might as well be without arms. Mind can annihilate  obstacles. It can also create them. Psychology was no unfamiliar ground  to Ernest, and it was not difficult for him to seek in some casual  suggestion an explanation for his delusion, the fixed notion that  haunted him day and night. But he also realized that to explain a  phenomenon is not to explain it away. The man who analyses his emotions  cannot wholly escape them, and the shadow of fear--primal, inexplicable  fear--may darken at moments of weakness the life of the subtlest  psychologist and the clearest thinker.    He had never spoken to Reginald of his terrible nightmares. Coming on  the heel of the fancy that he, Ernest, had written \"The Princess With  the Yellow Veil,\" a fancy that, by the way, had again possessed him of  late, this new delusion would certainly arouse suspicion as to his  sanity in Reginald's mind. He would probably send him to a sanitarium;  he certainly would not keep him in the house. Beneficence itself in all  other things, his host was not to be trifled with in any matter that  interfered with his work. He would act swiftly and without mercy.    For the first time in many days Ernest thought of Abel Felton. Poor boy!  What had become of him after he had been turned from the house? He would  not wait for any one to tell him to pack his bundle. But then, that was  impossible; Reginald was fond of him.    Suddenly Ernest's meditations were interrupted by a noise at the outer  door. A key was turned in the lock. It must be he--but why so soon? What  could have brought him back at this hour? He opened the door and went  out into the hall to see what had happened. The figure that he beheld  was certainly not the person expected, but a woman, from whose shoulders  a"]]]
