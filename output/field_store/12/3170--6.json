D. Alfonso, notary.    [Illustration: Fig. 81.--Disturbance at signing of Neapolitan marriage  contract.]    [Illustration: Fig. 82.]    Cecca tries to pick a quarrel with Peppino, and declares that  the contract shall not be signed. He reminds her of her promise,  and accuses her of breach of faith. In her passion she calls  on her daughter to repudiate her lover, and casting her arms  around her, commands her to make the sign of breaking off  friendship--\"_scocchiare_\"--which, she has herself made to Peppino,  and which consists in extending the hand with the joined ends of  finger and thumb before described, see Fig. 66, and then separating  them, thus breaking the union. This the latter reluctantly pretends  to do with one hand, yet with the other, which is concealed from her  irate mother's sight, shows her constancy by continuing with emphatic  pressure the sign of _love_. According to the gesture vocabulary, on  the sign _scocchiare_ being made to a person who is willing to accept  the breach of former affection, he replies in the same manner, or  still more forcibly by inserting the index of the other hand between  the index and thumb of the first, thus showing the separation by the  presence of a material obstacle. Simply refraining from holding out  the hand in any responsive gesture is sufficient to indicate that  the breach is not accepted, but that the party addressed desires to  continue in friendship instead of resolving into enmity. This weak  and inactive negative, however, does not suit Peppino's vivacity, who,  placing his left hand on his bosom, makes, with his right, one of the  signs for emphatic negation. This consists of the palm turned to the  person addressed with the index somewhat extended and separated from  the other fingers, the whole hand being oscillated from right to left.  This gesture appears on ancient Greek vases, and is compound, the  index being demonstrative and the negation shown by the horizontal  oscillation, the whole being translatable as, \"That thing I want not,  won't have, reject.\" The sign is virtually the same as that made by  Arapaho and Cheyenne Indians (see EXTRACTS FROM DICTIONARY, page 440,  _infra_.). The conception of oscillation to show negation also appears  with different execution in the sign of the Jicarilla Apaches and the  Pai-Utes, Fig. 82. The same sign is reported from Japan, in the same  sense.    [Illustration: Fig. 83.--Coming home of Neapolitan bride.]    Tonno, in hopes that the quarrel is definitive, to do his part in  stopping the ceremony, proceeds to blow out the three lighted candles,  which are an important traditional feature of the rite. The good old  man Pasquale, with his hands extended, raised in surprised displeasure  and directed toward the insolent youth, stops his attempt. The veteran  notary, familiar with such quarrels in his experience, smiles at this  one, and, continuing in his quiet attitude, extends his right hand  placidly to Peppino with the sign of _adagio_, before described, see  Fig. 68, advising him not to get excited, but to persist quietly, and  all would be well.           *       *       *       *       *    Fig. 83 portrays the first entrance of a bride to her husband's  house. She comes in with a tender and languid mien, her pendent  arms indicating soft yielding, and the right hand loosely holds a  handkerchief, ready to apply in case of overpowering emotion. She is,  or feigns to be, so timid and embarrassed as to require support by  the arm of a friend who introduces her. She is followed by a male  friend of the family, whose joyful face is turned toward supposed  by-standers, right hand pointing to the new acquisition, while with  his left he makes the sign of horns before described, see Fig. 79,  which in this connection is to wish prosperity and avert misfortune,  and is equivalent to the words in the Neapolitan dialect,  \"_Mal'uocchie non nce pozzano_\"--may evil eyes never have power over  her.    [Illustration: Fig. 84.]    The female confidant, who supports and guides her embarrassed  friend with her right arm, brings her left hand into the sign of  _beautiful_--\"See what a beauty she is!\" This sign is made by the  thumb and index open and severally lightly touching each side of the  lower cheek, the other fingers open. It is given on a larger scale and  slightly varied in Fig. 84, evidently referring to a fat and rounded  visage. Almost the same sign is made by the Ojibwas of Lake Superior,  and a mere variant of it is made by the Dakotas--stroking the cheeks  alternately down to the tip of the chin with the palm or surface of  the extended fingers.    [Illustration: Fig. 85.]    The mother-in-law greets the bride by making the sign _mano in fica_  with her right hand. This sign, made with the hand clenched and  the point of the thumb between and projecting beyond the fore and  middle fingers, is more distinctly shown in Fig. 85. It has a very  ancient origin, being found on Greek antiques that have escaped the  destruction of time, more particularly in bronzes, and undoubtedly  refers to the _pudendum muliebre_. It is used offensively and  ironically, but also--which is doubtless the case in this instance--as  an invocation or prayer against evil, being more forcible than the  horn-shaped gesture before described. With this sign the Indian sign  for _female_, see Fig. 132, page 357, _infra_, may be compared.    The mother-in-law also places her left hand hollowed in front of her  abdomen, drawing with it her gown slightly forward, thereby making a  pantomimic representation of the state in which \"women wish to be who  love their lords\"; the idea being plainly an expressed hope that the  household will be blessed with a new generation.    [Illustration: Fig. 86.]    [Illustration: Fig. 87.]    Next to her is a hunchback, who is present as a familiar clown or  merrymaker, and dances and laughs to please the company, at the same  time snapping his fingers. Two other illustrations of this action, the  middle finger in one leaving and in the other having left the thumb  and passed to its base, are seen in Figs. 86, 87. This gesture by  itself has, like others mentioned, a great variety of significations,  but here means _joy_ and acclamation. It is frequently used among us  for subdued applause, less violent than clapping the two hands, but  still oftener to express negation with disdain, and also carelessness.  Both these uses of it are common in Naples, and appear in Etruscan  vases and Pompeian paintings, as well as in the classic authors. The  significance of the action in the hand of the contemporary statue of  Sardanapalus at Anchiale is clearly _worthlessness_, as shown by the  inscription in Assyrian, \"Sardanapalus, the son of Anacyndaraxes,  built in one day Anchiale and Tarsus. Eat, drink, play; the rest is  not worth _that_!\"    [Illustration: Fig. 88.]    The bridegroom has left his mother to do the honors to the bride, and  himself attends to the rest of the company, inviting one of them to  drink some wine by a sign, enlarged in Fig. 88, which is not merely  pointing to the mouth with the thumb, but the hand with the incurved  fingers represents the body of the common glass flask which the  Neapolitans use, the extended thumb being its neck; the invitation is  therefore specially to drink wine. The guest, however, responds by  a very obvious gesture that he don't wish anything to drink, but he  would like to eat some macaroni, the fingers being disposed as if  handling that comestible in the fashion of vulgar Italians. If the  idea were only to eat generally, it would have been expressed by the  fingers and thumb united in a point and moved several times near and  toward the mouth, not raised above it, as is necessary for suspending  the strings of macaroni.    [Illustration: Fig. 89.--Quarrel between Neapolitan women.]    In Fig. 89 the female in the left of the group is much disgusted at  seeing one of her former acquaintances, who has met with good fortune,  promenade in a fine costume with her husband. Overcome with jealousy,  she spreads out her dress derisively on both sides, in imitation of  the hoop-skirts once worn by women of rank, as if to say \"So you are  playing the great lady!\" The insulted woman, in resentment, makes with  both hands, for double effect, the sign of horns, before described,  which in this case is done obviously in menace and imprecation. The  husband is a pacific fellow who is not willing to get into a woman's  quarrel, and is very easily held back by a woman and small boy who  happen to join the group. He contents himself with pretending to be in  a great passion and biting his finger, which gesture may be collated  with the emotional clinching of the teeth and biting the lips in  anger, common to all mankind.    [Illustration: Fig. 90.--The cheating Neapolitan chestnut huckster.]    [Illustration: Fig. 91.]    In Fig. 90 a contadina, or woman from the country, who has come to the  city to sell eggs (shown to be such by her head-dress, and the form of  the basket which she has deposited on the ground), accosts a vender of  roast chestnuts and asks for a measure of them. The chestnut huckster  says they are very fine and asks a price beyond that of the market;  but a boy sees that the rustic woman is not sharp in worldly matters  and desires to warn her against the cheat. He therefore, at the moment  when he can catch her eye, pretending to lean upon his basket, and  moving thus a little behind the huckster, so as not to be seen, points  him out with his index finger, and lays his left forefinger under his  eye, pulling down the skin slightly, so as to deform the regularity  of the lower eyelid. This is a _warning against a cheat_, shown more  clearly in Fig. 91. This sign primarily indicates a squinting person,  and metaphorically one whose looks cannot be trusted, even as in  a squinting person you cannot be certain in which direction he "]]]
