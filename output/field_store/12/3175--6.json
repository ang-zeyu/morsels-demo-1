Therefore she fought as few wasps have  probably fought before or since, and they are pretty expert exponents,  and scarcely backward ones, of warfare.    The battle that followed was awful.    Almost at the start the two insects, grappling, fell headlong to the  excavation the queen had made below the city, and there, rolling over  and over, continued the struggle in the dark among the refuse, the  queen eternally feeling with her poison-dagger for a space to drive  home her death-blow between the other's smooth, shining armor-plates;  the cricket eternally endeavoring to behead the queen between its awful  jaws.    It was a fight to the death, as most insect duels are, and it could not  last long.  It was too tense, too fiendish, too shockingly wicked for  that.    Suddenly the queen's body shot out like a spring.  The opening she had  been feeling for had appeared, and she had driven her death-blow home.  At the same instant, with a supreme effort, she bent double and shot  herself free, the last convulsive, shearing crush of her foe's laws  clashing to so close above her head that they actually caught in their  death-grip, and held, till she pulled them out by the roots, two  bristles of her neck.    And then--well, then the queen hurried back up to her city, just in  time to help out of its cell the first of her children--and citizens at  last--the first limp, clambering, damp, newly painted, freshly bedecked  young worker-wasp, perfect from feeler to sting, from wing to claw.    Quickly they broke out now from the cocoons, and the queen bustled from  one to the other, assisting, cleaning, encouraging; for it is a tricky  job for an insect to come out of its chrysalis-case.  The queen's work,  however, was really done; for, though for a day or two, till their  cuirasses and wings hardened, these new young worker-wasps only did  light labor, acting as nurses to the others that were following, and so  on, they quickly took upon their own shoulders the whole of the work of  the city: the nursing and feeding of the young, the hunting, the  building, the scavenging, and the waiting upon and feeding the  queen-mother herself completely, so that she should henceforth labor  not, nor fight, nor waste herself in the chase, but should keep at home  and lay countless eggs, and eggs, and always nothing but eggs, for the  workers to rear for the benefit of the State.          *      *      *      *      *      *    To-day that city has a population of nearly 60,000, and contains over  11,000 cells; and the queen is still there, laying eggs, eggs, and  again eggs, till--          IV    NINE POINTS OF THE LAW        Sharp's the word with her.--SWIFT.    Some people never know when they are well off.  It is a complaint which  afflicts cats, you may have noticed, and gets them into much trouble  that their contemptuous temper might otherwise leave them free from.  The silver tabby would have done better if she had remained asleep upon  Miss Somebody's arm-chair, instead of squatting, still as marble, out  in a damp field on a damp night, watching a rabbits' \"stop\"--which is  vernacular for a bunnies' nursery--and thinking how nice raw, pink  baby-rabbit would taste if she got the chance to sample it.  She  didn't.  At least, she hadn't for an hour and a half; but, then, what's  an hour and a half to a cat?  Apparently the silver tabby could wait,  just like that, utterly inert, till the crack of doom--or dawn.    Mind you, she was not alone.  She had company.  One always has in the  wild at night, or nearly always.  You couldn't see that company, but I  don't know whether the silver tabby could.  Who can tell how much a cat  sees, anyway?  Nor do I think the company could see her, she being  still, and wild eyes not being good at picking out the still form.  Neither could they hear her, for she said nothing; neither did she  purr.  They must have smelt her, though.  Anyway, she seemed to be a  little island in the mist--the faint, faint, ethereal dew-mist--where  nobody walked.  You could hear them--a rustle here, a squeak there, a  thud somewhere else, a displaced leaf, a cracked twig--this only  once--a drumming, a patter, a sniff, a snuffle, a sigh; but they all  passed by on the other side, so to say, and gave the silver tabby room  to think.  Apparently cats are not considered good company in the wild;  lonely creatures, they are best left alone.    No mother-rabbit came to the \"stop\"--which the cat knew to be there--to  feed her babies, which the cat, thanks to her nose, knew to be there,  too.  No baby-rabbits came out to be fed--or to feed the cat either.  \"Stops\" are secrets, kept from the rest of rabbitdom by the wise  mothers, and, they hope, from other inquisitive people also.  The  little short holes in the middle of the field are plugged up by the old  does with grass and fur when they are away, which is pretty often.    Then the silver tabby heard a thump come out of the night--a thud,  hollow, resounding, and noticeable.  It was repeated after an interval,  and again repeated.  There was a certain note of insistence about  it--like a signal.  And if the cat had been a wild creature she would  have thrown up the sponge, or gone away, and returned secretly later,  or, anyway, not persisted in crouching there; for those thuds were a  signal, and they meant that the game was up.  In other words, some wily  old mother circling the approach, or some wandering back-eddy of wind,  had given the cat away; she had been scented, and rabbit after rabbit,  squatting invisible in the night, was thumping the ground with its feet  to say so and warn all off whom it might concern.  The silver tabby,  however, neither wild nor satisfied to be tame, did not know.  She sat  on, and in doing so wondered, perhaps, at the scarcity of rabbits  thereabouts.    She sat, or hunched, or crouched, or couched, or whatever you call that  precise position of cats, which is neither lying down nor sitting up,  for some time longer--for another twenty minutes, to be precise; and  all the while the thuds of mystery serenaded her from nowhere in  particular out of the dark--and from down-wind.    Then she must have come to the conclusion that she was being made a  fool of, for she got up, stretched herself lazily, with arched back and  bared claws, and yawned a bored feline yawn.  And even as she did so  she was aware of a sudden final flourish of thuds, and then  dead-silence.  Next moment, in that same dead-silence, she distinctly  heard something coming towards her, and that something was taking no  pains to conceal the fact.    Now, in the wild it is not the custom to go towards anything and take  no pains to conceal the fact.  The unhealth of such a procedure is  swiftly borne in upon such rash ones as make the experiment, and they  seldom live long enough to pass their folly on.  Only the mighty can  afford not to walk circumspectly, and they are very few, and, with man  about, even they have learnt wisdom.  That is why the wild is so  guarded, and why self-effacement becomes almost a religion therein.    Even the cat knew this, I fancy.  Anyway, she looked surprised as she  crouched again, and quickly.    Now, of all the wild-people, probably one of the most brazen is the  pig; it is also one of the bravest.  I mean, the wild pig.  And it  would seem that he, or she, who came that way was a pig, only a  precious little one.  You know the ways of a pig?  How you can hear him  coming long before he comes; how he must snuffle, and grunt, and poke  dead leaves, and snort, and tread on things, and snore.  Very good.  So  it was here; and these things did this new-comer, who approached  through the mist--only all in a dwarfed way, as if they were done by a  tiny grown-up pig.  Its gruntings were almost to itself; its snortings,  snorings, and sniffings quite small; and its snorts little miniature  ones.  Only, in the profound silence of the night, and in comparison  with the furtive noises of all the rest of the night-wild, they sounded  quite loud.    The cat, as she crouched, passed from supercilious surprise to  amazement.  You could tell that by the roundness of her eyes.  She had  no knowledge of pigs, and had never met any of the wild-folk gone mad;  yet it seemed that one must have done so now, and that one--to her  growing uneasiness--was coming straight towards her.  I fancy that in  that moment she thought of the warm fire, the singing kettle, the  saucer of milk, and Miss Somebody's best arm-chair.    The thing, whatever it was, came straight on in a more or less zigzag  line, till the cat could make it out dimly in the moonlight, a  blotched, roughly egg-shaped form, less than a foot long, so low to the  ground that it appeared to be running on wheels, and covered all over  with prickles, like a Rugby ball into which tin tacks had been driven  head first, the sharp ends pointing outwards and backwards.  Its head  was the small end, and much lower than its back.  Its eyes, little and  pig-like, set in a black cowl, gleamed red in the tired moonlight; and  its face was the face of a pig, nothing else--just pure pig; insolent,  cunning, vulgar, and blatant.  Occasionally men name a wild beast  correctly, and this little beast could only have one name--hedgehog: It  was obvious on the face of it.    But the cat, being a cat and an aristocrat, knew, as has been said,  nothing about pigs, real or only so called.  She had killed a shrew  once, and spat it out for tasting abominably and smelling worse; and  shrews are cousins of the hedgehogs, of the same great clan,  Insectivora--far removed from the pigs, really--and that is the nearest  she had got.    She had never heard of hedgehogs, and never, never met a beast that  walked through the wild as if he owned it.  And, more,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17571"],[0,"Piano Tuning: A Simple and Accurate Method for Amateurs (#11)"],[1,"the square piano  does not, as a rule, admit of as fine tuning as the upright.        [C] The three strings composing the trio or unison are numbered 1st,      2d or middle, and 3d, from left to right.    It is presumed that you are now familiar with the succession of tones  and intervals used in setting the temperament. Fix these things in  your mind and the system is easy to understand and remember. Keep  within the bounds of the two octaves laid out in Lesson X. Tune all  fifths upward; that is, tune all fifths by their fundamentals. For  example, starting on 1C, use it as fundamental, and by it, tune its  fifth, which is G; then, having G tuned, use it as fundamental, and by  it tune its fifth, which is D, and so on through. After tuning a  fifth, always tune its octave either above or below, whichever way it  lies within the bounds of the two octaves. After going through one or  two experiments in setting temperament you will see the simplicity of  this system and will, perhaps, not be obliged to refer to the diagram  any more.    For various reasons, it is better to try your experiments on an  upright piano, and the better the piano, the more satisfactory will be  the result of the experiment. You should have no hesitancy or timidity  in taking hold of a good piano, as you cannot damage it if you use  good judgment, follow instructions, and work carefully. The first  caution is, be very careful that you draw a string but slightly  sharper than it is to be left. Rest the heel of the hand against some  stationary part of the piano and pull very slowly, and in a direct  right angle with the tuning pin so as to avoid any tendency to bend or  spring the pin. We would advise now that you find an upright piano  that is badly out of tune, if you have none of your own, and proceed  to set a temperament.    The following instructions will suffice for your first experiments,  and by them you may be able to get fairly good results; however, the  theory of temperament, which is more thoroughly entered into in Lesson  XII, must be studied before you can have a thorough understanding of  the causes and effects.    After deciding, as per instructions on pitch which C you will tune  first, place the tuning hammer (using the star head if pins are  square) on the pin with the handle extending upwards or inclined  slightly to the right. (The star head, which will fit the pin at eight  different angles, enables the tuner to select the most favorable  position.) To raise the pitch, you will, of course, pull the hammer to  the right. In order to make a string stand in tune, it is well to draw  it very slightly above the pitch at which it is to remain, and settle  it back by striking the key repeatedly and strongly, and at the same  time bearing gently to the left on the tuning hammer. The exact amount  of over-tension must be learned by practice; but it should be so  slight as to be barely perceptible. Aim to get the string tuned with  the least possible turning of the hammer. The tension of the string  should be evenly distributed over its entire length; that is, over its  vibrating middle and its \"dead ends\" beyond the bridges. Therefore it  is necessary to strike the key strongly while tuning so as to make the  string draw through the bridges. By practice, you will gain control of  the hammer and become so expert that you can feel the strings draw  through the bridges and the pins turn in the block.    Having now tuned your three Cs, you will take 1C as a starting point,  and by it, tune 1G a perfect fifth above. Tune it perfect by drawing  it gradually up or down until all pulsations disappear. Now after  making sure you have it perfect, flatten it until you can hear slow,  almost imperceptible waves; less rapid than one per second. This  flattening of the fifth is called tempering, and from it comes the  word \"temperament.\" The fact that the fifth must always be tuned a  little flatter than perfect, is a matter which always causes some  astonishment when first learned. It seems, to the uninitiated, that  every interval should be made perfect; but it is impossible to make  them so, and get a correct scale, as we shall see later on.    Now tune 2G by the 1G just tuned, to a perfect octave. Remember that  all octaves should be left perfect--all waves tuned out. Now try 2G  with 2C. If your octaves are perfect, this upper fifth will beat a  little faster than the lower one, but the dissonance should not be so  great as to be disagreeable. Proceed to your next fifth, which is 2D,  then its octave, 1D, then its fifth and so on as per directions on the  system card. You can make no chord trials until you have tuned E, an  interval of a major third from C.    Having tuned 2E, you can now make your first trial: the chord of C. If  you have tempered your fifths correctly, this chord will come out in  pleasing harmony, and yet the E will be somewhat sharper than a  perfect major third to C. Now, just for experiment, lower 2E until all  waves disappear when sounded with 2C. You now have a perfect major  third. Upon sounding the chord, you will find it more pleasing than  before; but you cannot leave your thirds perfect. Draw it up again to  its proper temperament with A, and you will notice it has very  pronounced beats when sounded with C. Proceed with the next step,  which is that of tuning 1B, fifth to 1E. When tuned, try it as a major  third in the chord of G. At each step from this on, try the note just  tuned as a major third in its proper chord. Remember, the third always  sounds better if lower than you dare to leave it; but, on the other  hand, it must not be left so sharp as to be at all unpleasant when  heard in the chord. As to the position of the chord for these trials,  the second position, that is, with the third the highest, is the most  favorable, as in this position you can more easily discern excessive  sharpness of the third, which is the most common occurrence. When you  have gone through the entire system and arrived at the last fifth,  1F-2C, you should find it nearly as perfect as the rest, but you will  hardly be able to do so in your first efforts. Even old tuners  frequently have to go over their work a second or third time before  all fifths are properly tempered. By this system, however, you cannot  go far wrong if you test each step as directed, and your first chord  comes up right. If the first test, G-C-E, proves that there is a false  member in the chord, do not proceed with the system, but go over the  first seven steps until you find the offending members and rectify.  Do not be discouraged on account of failures. No one ever set a  correct temperament at the first attempt.      QUESTIONS ON LESSON IX.        1. Define the terms, \"International Pitch,\" and \"Concert Pitch.\"        2. How would you arrive at the most favorable pitch at which to      tune a piano, if the owner did not suggest any certain pitch?        3. What is the advantage in using the continuous mute?        4. Tell what is necessary in the tuning of a string to insure it      to stand well?        5. What would result in the major third C-E, if all the fifths, up      to E, were tuned perfect?          LESSON X.    ~THEORY OF THE TEMPERAMENT.~      The instructions given in Lessons VIII and IX cover the subject of  temperament pretty thoroughly in a way, and by them alone, the student  might learn to set a temperament satisfactorily; but the student who  is ambitious and enthusiastic is not content with a mere knowledge of  how to do a thing; he wants to know why he does it; why certain causes  produce certain effects; why this and that is necessary, etc. In the  following lessons we set forth a comprehensive demonstration of the  theory of Temperament, requirements of the correct scale and the  essentials of its mathematics.    ~Equal Temperament.~--Equal temperament is one in which the twelve  fixed tones of the chromatic scale[D] are equidistant. Any chord will  be as harmonious in one key as in another.        [D] The chromatic scale is a succession of all the half steps in the      compass of one octave. Counting the octave tone, it contains      thirteen tones, but we speak of twelve, as there are only twelve      which differ in name.    ~Unequal Temperament.~--Unequal temperament was practiced in olden  times when music did not wander far from a few keys which were favored  in the tuning. You will see, presently, how a temperament could be set  in such a way as to favor a certain key (family of tones) and also  those keys which are nearly related to it; but, that in favoring these  keys, our scale must be constructed greatly to the detriment of the  \"remote\" keys. While a chord or progression of chords would sound  extremely harmonious in the favored keys, they would be so unbalanced  in the remote keys as to render them extremely unpleasant and almost  unfit to be used. In this day, when piano and organ music is written  and played in all the keys, the unequal temperament is, of course, out  of the question. But, strange to say, it is only within the last half  century that the system of equal temperament has been universally  adopted, and some tuners, even now, will try to favor the flat keys  because they are used more by the mass of players who play little but  popular music, which is mostly written in keys having flats in the  signature.    Upon the system table you will notice that the first five tones tuned  (not counting the octaves) are C, G, D, A and E; it being necessary  to go over these fifths before we can make any tests of the complete  major chord or even the major third. Now, just for a proof of what has  been said about the necessity of flattening the fifths, try tuning all  these fifths perfect. Tune them so that there are absolutely no waves  in any of them and you will find that, on trying the chord G-C-E, or  the major third C-E, the E will be very much too sharp. Now, let your  E down until"]]]
