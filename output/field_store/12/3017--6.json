And  so this modern Pharaoh kept us all on tenterhooks. The drilling and  exercising of the newly recruited troops were the excitements of the  day. Soon Colonel Plumer[16] arrived, and assumed command of one of the  regiments, which was encamped on the racecourse just outside the town;  the other regiment had its headquarters at Mafeking. Colonel  Baden-Powell and his Staff used to dash up and down between the two  towns. Nearly all the business men in Bulawayo enlisted, and amongst the  officers were some experienced soldiers, who had seen all the  Matabeleland fighting, and some of whom had even participated in the  Raid. Others who used to drop in for a game of bridge were Lord Timmy  Paulet,[17] Mr. Geoffrey Glyn, and Dr. Jameson. To while away the time,  I took a course of ambulance lessons, learning how to bandage by  experiments on the lanky arms and legs of a little black boy. We also  made expeditions to the various mining districts. I was always struck  with the hospitality shown us in these out-of-the-way localities, and  with the cosiness of the houses belonging to the married mine-managers.  Only Kaffirs were available as servants, but, in spite of this, an  excellent repast was always produced, and the dwellings were full of  their home treasures. Prints of the present King and Queen abounded, and  among the portraits of beautiful Englishwomen, either photographs or  merely reproductions cut out of an illustrated newspaper, I found those  of Lady de Grey,[18] Georgiana, Lady Dudley, and Mrs. Langtry,[19] most  frequently adorning the walls of those lonely homes.    At last, at the end of September, a wire informed us that hostilities  were expected to begin in Natal the following week, and I left for  Mafeking, intending to proceed to Cape Town and home. On arrival at  Mafeking everyone told us an attack on the town was imminent, and we  found the inhabitants in a state of serious alarm. However,  Baden-Powell's advent reassured them, and preparations for war proceeded  apace; the townspeople flocked in to be enrolled in the town guard,  spending the days in being drilled; the soldiers were busy throwing up  such fortifications as were possible under the circumstances. On October  3 the armoured train arrived from the South, and took its first trip on  the rails, which had been hastily flung down round the circumference of  the town. This train proved afterwards to be absolutely useless when the  Boers brought up their artillery. Night alarms occurred frequently;  bells would ring, and the inhabitants, who mostly slept in their  clothes, had to rush to their various stations. I must admit that these  nocturnal incidents were somewhat unpleasant. Still war was not  declared, and the large body of Boers, rumoured as awaiting the signal  to advance on Mafeking, gave no sign of approaching any nearer.    We were, indeed, as jolly as the proverbial sandboys during those few  days in Mafeking before the war commenced. If Colonel Baden-Powell had  forebodings, he kept them to himself. Next to him in importance came  Lord Edward Cecil, Grenadier Guards, C.S.O. I have often heard it said  that if Lord Edward had been a member of any other family but that of  the gifted Cecils he would have been marked as a genius, and that if he  had not been a soldier he would surely have been a politician of note.  Then there was Major Hanbury Tracy, Royal Horse Guards, who occupied the  position of Director of Military Intelligence. This officer was always  devising some amusing if wild-cat schemes, which were to annihilate or  checkmate the Boers, and prove eventually the source of fame to himself.  Mr. Ronald Moncrieff,[20] an extra A.D.C., was, as usual, not blest  with a superabundance of this world's goods, but had an unending supply  of animal spirits, and he was looking forward to a siege as a means of  economizing. Another of our circle was Major Hamilton Gould Adams,[21]  Resident Commissioner of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, who commanded  the town guard, representing the civil as opposed to the military  interests. In contrast to the usual practice, these departments worked  perfectly smoothly together at Mafeking.    Colonel Baden-Powell did not look on my presence with great favour,  neither did he order me to leave, and I had a sort of presentiment that  I might be useful, considering that there were but three trained nurses  in the Victoria Hospital to minister to the needs of the whole garrison.  Therefore, though I talked of going South every day by one of the  overcrowded trains to Cape Town, in which the Government was offering  free tickets to any who wished to avail themselves of the opportunity, I  secretly hoped to be allowed to remain. We had taken a tiny cottage in  the town, and we had all our meals at Dixon's Hotel, where the food was  weird, but where certainly no depression of spirits reigned. I even  bought a white pony, called Dop,[22] from a Johannesburg polo-player,  and this pony, one of the best I have ever ridden, had later on some  curious experiences. One day Dr. Jameson arrived on his way to Rhodesia,  but he was hustled away with more haste than courtesy by General  Baden-Powell, who bluntly told him that if he meant to stay in the town  a battery of artillery would be required to defend it; and of  field-guns, in spite of urgent representations, not one had reached us  from Cape Town. We used to ride morning and evening on the flat country  which surrounds Mafeking, where no tree or hill obscures the view for  miles; and one then realized what a tiny place the seat of government of  the Bechuanaland Protectorate really was, a mere speck of corrugated  iron roofs on the brown expanse of the burnt-up veldt, far away from  everywhere. I think it was this very isolation that created the interest  in the siege at home, and one of the reasons why the Boers were so  anxious to reduce it was that this town was practically the jumping-off  place for the Jameson Raid. So passed the days till October 13, and then  the sword, which had been suspended by a hair, suddenly fell.    On that day Major Gould Adams received a wire from the High Commissioner  at Cape Town to the effect that the South African Republic had sent an  ultimatum to Her Majesty's Government, in which it demanded the removal  of all troops from the Transvaal borders, fixing five o'clock the  following evening as a limit for their withdrawal. I had delayed my  departure too long; it was extremely doubtful whether another train  would be allowed to pass South, and, even when started, it would stand a  great chance of being wrecked by the Boers tearing up the rails. Under  these circumstances I was allotted comparatively safe quarters at the  house of Mr. Benjamin Weil, of the firm of the well-known South African  merchants. His residence stood in the centre of the little town,  adjacent to the railway-station. At that time bomb-proof underground  shelters, with which Mafeking afterwards abounded, had not been thought  of, or time had not sufficed for their construction. On all sides one  heard reproaches levelled at the Cape Government, and especially at  General Sir William Butler, until lately commanding the troops in Cape  Colony, for having so long withheld the modest reinforcements which had  been persistently asked for, and, above all, the very necessary  artillery.    At that date the Mafeking garrison consisted of about seven or eight  hundred trained troops. The artillery, under Major Panzera, comprised  four old muzzle-loading seven-pounder guns with a short range, a  one-pound Hotchkiss, one Nordenfeldt, and about seven ^{.}303 Maxims--in  fact, no large modern pieces whatever. The town guard, hastily  enrolled, amounted to 441 defenders, among whom nationalities were  curiously mixed, as the following table shows:         British            378       Germans              4       Americans            4       Russians             6       Dutch               27       Norwegians           5       Swedes               2       Arabs and Indians   15                         ____               Total        441[23]    This force did not appear sufficiently strong to resist the three or  four thousand Boers, with field-guns, who were advancing to its attack  under one of their best Generals--namely Cronje--but everyone remained  wonderfully calm, and the townspeople rose to the occasion in a most  creditable manner.    Very late that same evening, just as I was going to bed, I received a  message from Colonel Baden-Powell, through one of his Staff, to say he  had just been informed, on trustworthy authority, that no less than  8,000 burghers composed the force likely to arrive on the morrow, that  it was probable they would rush the town, and that the garrison would be  obliged to fight its way out. He concluded by begging me to leave at  once by road for the nearest point of safety. Naturally I had to obey. I  shall never forget that night: it was cold and gusty after a hot day,  with frequent clouds obscuring the moon, as we walked round to Major  Gould Adams's house to secure a Cape cart and some Government mules, in  order that I might depart at dawn. At first I was ordered to Kanya, a  mission-station some seventy miles away, an oasis in the Kalahari  Desert. This plan gave rise to a paragraph which I afterwards saw in  some of the daily papers, that I had left Mafeking under the escort of a  missionary, and some cheery spirit made a sketch of my supposed  departure as reproduced here. Later on, however, it was thought  provisions might run short in that secluded spot, so I was told to  proceed to Setlagoli, a tiny store, or hotel as we should call it, with  a shop attached, thirty-five miles south in Bechuanaland, on the main  road to Kimberley, from which quarter eventually succour was expected.

And thus my good angel turns her back to me in anger! And now,  politics, thou witch, I am irretrievably in thy power!    [_Exit quickly through centre door._]    _Enter_ PIEPENBRINK, MRS. PIEPENBRINK, BERTHA _escorted by_ FRITZ  KLEINMICHEL, _and_ KLEINMICHEL _through centre door. Quadrille behind  the scenes._    PIEPENBRINK. Thank Heaven, we are out of this crowd!    MRS. PIEPENBRINK. It is very hot.    KLEINMICHEL. And the music is too loud. There are too many trumpets  and I hate trumpets.    PIEPENBRINK. Here's a quiet spot; we'll sit down here.    FRITZ. Bertha would prefer staying in the ball-room. Might I not go  back with her?    PIEPENBRINK. I have no objection to you young people going back into  the ball-room, but I prefer your staying here with us. I like to keep  my whole party together.    MRS. PIEPENBRINK. Stay with your parents, my child!    PIEPENBRINK. Sit down! (_To his wife._) You sit at the corner, Fritz  comes next to me. You take Bertha between you, neighbors. Her place  will soon be at your table, anyway.    [_They seat themselves at the table on the right--at the left corner_  MRS. PIEPENBRINK, _then he himself_, FRITZ, BERTHA, KLEINMICHEL.]    FRITZ. When will \"soon\" be, godfather? You have been saying that this  long time, but you put off the wedding day further and further.    PIEPENBRINK. That is no concern of yours.    FRITZ. I should think it is, godfather! Am I not the man that wants  to marry Bertha?    PIEPENBRINK. That's a fine argument! Any one can want that. But it's I  who am to give her to you, which is more to the point, young man; for  it is going to be hard enough for me to let the little wag-tail leave  my nest. So you wait. You shall have her, but wait!    KLEINMICHEL. He will wait, neighbor.    PIEPENBRINK. Well, I should strongly advise him to do so. Hey! Waiter,  waiter!    [Illustration: _Permission F. Bruckman, A.-G. Munich_ ON THE TERRACE  ADOLF VON MENZEL]    MRS. PIEPENBRINK. What poor service one gets in such places!    PIEPENBRINK. Waiter!    [_Waiter comes._]    My name is Piepenbrink. I brought along six bottles of my own wine.  The restaurant-keeper has them. I should like them here.    [_While the waiter is bringing the bottles and glasses_ BOLZ _and_  KAeMPE _appear. Waiter from time to time in the background._]    BOLZ (_aside to_ KAeMPE). Which one is it?    KAeMPE. The one with his back to us, the broad-shouldered one.    BOLZ. And what kind of a business does he carry on?    KAeMPE. Chiefly red wines.    BOLZ. Good! (_Aloud._) Waiter, a table and two chairs here! A bottle  of red wine!    [_Waiter brings what has been ordered to the front, on the left._]    MRS. PIEPENBRINK. What are those people doing here?    PIEPENBRINK. That is the trouble with such promiscuous assemblies,  that one never can be alone.    KLEINMICHEL. They seem respectable gentlemen; I think I have seen one  of them before.    PIEPENBRINK (_decisively_). Respectable or not, they are in our way.    KLEINMICHEL. Yes, to be sure, so they are.    BOLZ (_seating himself with_ KAeMPE). Here, my friend, we can sit  quietly before a bottle of red wine. I hardly dare to pour it out, for  the wine at such restaurants is nearly always abominable. What sort of  stuff do you suppose this will be?    PIEPENBRINK (_irritated_). Indeed? Just listen to that!    KAeMPE. Let's try it.    [_Pours out; in a low voice._]    There is a double P. on the seal; that might mean Piepenbrink.    PIEPENBRINK. Well, I am curious to know what these greenhorns will  have to say against the wine.    MRS. PIEPENBRINK. Be quiet, Philip, they can hear you over there.    BOLZ (_in a low tone_). I'm sure you are right. The restaurant takes  its wine from him. That's his very reason for coming.    PIEPENBRINK. They don't seem to be thirsty; they are not drinking.    BOLZ (_tastes it; aloud_). Not bad!    PIEPENBRINK (_ironically_). Indeed?    BOLZ (_takes another sip_). A good, pure wine.    PIEPENBRINK (_relieved_). The fellow's judgment is not so bad.    BOLZ. But it does not compare with a similar wine that I recently  drank at a friend's house.    PIEPENBRINK. Indeed?    BOLZ. I learned then that there is only one man in town from whom a  sensible wine-drinker should take his red wine.    KAeMPE. And that is?    PIEPENBRINK (_ironically_). I really should like to know.    BOLZ. It's a certain Piepenbrink.    PIEPENBRINK (_nodding his head contentedly_). Good!    KAeMPE. Yes, it is well known to be a very reliable firm.    PIEPENBRINK. They don't know that their own wine, too, is from my  cellars. Ha! Ha! Ha!    BOLZ (_turning to him_). Are you laughing at us, Sir?    PIEPENBRINK. Ha! Ha! Ha! No offense. I merely heard you talking about  the wine. So you like Piepenbrink's wine better than this here? Ha!  Ha! Ha!    BOLZ (_slightly indignant_). Sir, I must request you to find my  expressions less comical. I do not know Mr. Piepenbrink, but I have  the pleasure of knowing his wine; and so I repeat the assertion that  Piepenbrink has better wine in his cellar than this here. What do you  find to laugh at in that? You do not know Piepenbrink's wines and have  no right to judge of them.    PIEPENBRINK. I do not know Piepenbrink's wines, I do not know Philip  Piepenbrink either, I never saw his wife--do you hear that,  Lottie?--And when his daughter Bertha meets me I ask, \"Who is that  little black-head?\" That is a funny story. Isn't it, Kleinmichel?    KLEINMICHEL. It is very funny! [_Laughs._]    BOLZ (_rising with dignity_). Sir, I am a stranger to you and have  never insulted you. You look honorable and I find you in the society  of charming ladies. For that reason I cannot imagine that you came  here to mock at strangers. As man to man, therefore, I request you to  explain why you find my harmless words so astonishing. If you don't  like Mr. Piepenbrink why do you visit it on us?    PIEPENBRINK _(rising_). Don't get too excited, Sir. Now, see here! The  wine you are now drinking is also from Piepenbrink's cellar, and I  myself am the Philip Piepenbrink for whose sake you are pitching into  me. Now, do you see why I laugh?    BOLZ. Ah, is that the way things stand? You yourself are Mr.  Piepenbrink? Then I am really glad to make your acquaintance. No  offense, honored Sir!    PIEPENBRINK. No, no offense. Everything is all right.    BOLZ. Since you were so kind as to tell us your name, the next thing  in order is for you to learn ours. I'm Bolz, Doctor of Philosophy, and  my friend here is Mr. Kaempe.    PIEPENBRINK. Pleased to meet you.    BOLZ. We are comparative strangers in this company and had withdrawn  to this side room as one feels slightly embarrassed among so many new  faces. But we should be very sorry if by our presence we in any way  disturbed the enjoyment of the ladies and the conversation of so  estimable a company. Tell us frankly if we are in the way, and we will  find another place.    PIEPENBRINK. You seem to me a jolly fellow and are not in the least in  my way, Doctor Bolz--that was the name, was it not?    MRS. PIEPENBRINK. We, too, are strangers here and had only just sat  down. Piepenbrink!    [_Nudges him slightly._]    PIEPENBRINK. I tell you what, Doctor, as you are already acquainted  with the yellow-seal from my cellar and have passed a very sensible  verdict upon it, how would it be for you to give it another trial  here? Sit down with us if you have nothing better to do, and we will  have a good talk together.    BOLZ (_with dignity, as throughout this whole scene, during which both  he and KAeMPE must not seem to be in any way pushing_). That is a very  kind invitation, and we accept it with pleasure. Be good enough, dear  Sir, to present us to your company.    PIEPENBRINK. This here is my wife.    BOLZ. Do not be vexed at our breaking in upon you, Madam. We promise  to behave ourselves and to be as good company as lies in the power of  two shy bachelors.    PIEPENBRINK. Here is my daughter.    BOLZ (_to_ MRS. PIEPENBRINK). One could have known that from the  likeness.    PIEPENBRINK. This is my friend, Mr. Kleinmichel, and this, Fritz  Kleinmichel, my daughter's fiance.    BOLZ. I congratulate you, gentlemen, on such delightful society. (_To_  PIEPENBRINK.) Permit me to sit next to the lady of the house. Kaempe, I  thought you would sit next to Mr. Kleinmichel.    [_They sit down_.]    Now we alternate! Waiter!    [_Waiter comes to him_.]    Two bottles of this!    PIEPENBRINK. Hold on! You won't find that wine here. I brought my own  kind. You're to drink with me.    BOLZ. But Mr. Piepenbrink----    PIEPENBRINK. No remonstrances! You drink with me. And when I ask any  one to drink with me, Sir, I don't mean to sip, as women do, but to  drink out and fill up. You must make up your mind to that.    BOLZ. Well, I am content. We as gratefully accept your hospitality as  it is heartily offered. But you must then let me have my revenge. Next  Sunday you are all to be my guests, will you? Say yes, my kind host!  Punctually at seven, informal supper. I am single, so it will be in a  quiet, respectable hotel. Give your consent, my dear Madam. Shake  hands on it, Mr. Piepenbrink.--You, too, Mr. Kleinmichel and Mr.  Fritz!    [_Holds out his hand to each of them_.]    PIEPENBRINK. If my wife is satisfied it will suit me all right.    BOLZ. Done! Agreed! And now the first toast. To the good spirit who  brought us together today, long may he live!--[_Questioning those  about him_.] What's the spirit's name?    FRITZ KLEINMICHEL. Chance.    BOLZ. No, he has a yellow cap.    PIEPENBRINK. Yellow-seal is his name.    BOLZ. Correct! Here's his health! We hope the gentleman may last a  long time, as the cat said to the bird when she bit its head off.    KLEINMICHEL. We wish him long life just as we are putting an end to  him.    BOLZ. Well said! Long life!    PIEPENBRINK. Long life!    [_They touch glasses_. PIEPENBRINK _to his wife_.]    It is going to turn out"]]]
