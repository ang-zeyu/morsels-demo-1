The third  sort are those produced by distillation, but of a different kind in an  open vessel, and without the help of water. They are likewise divided  into _vegetable_ oils, _animal_ oils, and _mineral_ oils; which last  are those drawn from amber, and a few other substances partaking both  of the vegetable and mineral natures, as Petroleum, commonly known as  kerosene or coal oil.         _Alembic_, a chemical vessel used in distilling. It consists       of a vessel placed over a fire, containing the substance to       be distilled; the upper part, which receives and condenses       the steam, is called the head; the beak of this is fitted to       a vessel called a receiver.         _Volatile_, easily escaping, quickly flying off.      Whence is the word Oil derived?    From the Latin _oleum_, formed from _olea, olive-tree_, the fruit of  which abounds in oil.      What immense fish is it that furnishes us with a quantity of _animal_  oil?    The Whale, the largest and noblest inhabitant of the waters. It is  protected from the cold by a case or coating of blubber, that is, a  thick oily fat from which the oil is made; numbers of them are caught  for the sake of that. Ambergris, highly prized in perfumery, is a  product of the sperm whale.      In what seas are they found?    Chiefly in the Northern Seas: extensive whale fisheries are carried on  by the Americans, English, Dutch, &c., and numbers of vessels are sent  out for the purpose of taking the fish: they usually sail in the  latter end of March, and begin fishing about May. The whale fishery  continues generally from that time till the latter end of June or  July. There are also other fishes and animals which afford us oils of  different kinds, which are used for various purposes in medicine and  the arts.      Is the oil called _castor_, which is so much used in medicine, the  product of an animal or a plant?    Castor oil is expressed from a West Indian shrub, called Palma  Christi; and especially from the ripe seeds, which are full of this  oil. It is prepared by collecting these ripe seeds, and freeing them  from the husks; then bruising and beating them into a paste; they are  next boiled in water, when the oil rising to the surface is skimmed  off as it continues to appear. The Castor-oil plant is found growing  abundantly in Sumatra, particularly near the sea-shore.      Where is Sumatra situated?    In the Oriental Archipelago, off the south eastern part of the  continent of Asia.      In what other countries is this plant found?    In some parts of Africa, Syria, and Egypt. It was anciently cultivated  in the two last-mentioned countries in large quantities, the seeds  being used for the oil they yielded, which was burnt in lamps.    [Illustration: BEAVERS BUILDING THEIR HUTS.]      Is not the Palma Christi much affected by soil and situation?    Greatly so. In some places it attains the stature of a tree, and is  not a biennial plant, but endures for many years, as in the warm  plains of Irak, Arabia, and some parts of Africa.         _Biennial_, lasting for the space of two years only.      What are Melons?    A species of the Cucumis, a genus of plants to which the cucumber  belongs. There are great varieties of this fruit cultivated in  different parts of the world; that sort called the Cantaleup (so named  from being cultivated at a place of that name in the neighborhood of  Rome, whither it was brought from Armenia,) is a species of  musk-melon; the mature fruit is juicy, and delicately flavored.      Where is Armenia situated?    Armenia is a large country situated in Asiatic Turkey, to the west of  the Caspian Sea.      What species of Melon is that which almost makes up for a scarcity of  good water in hot countries?    The water-melon, which affords a cool, refreshing juice, and quenches  the thirst produced by the excessive heats. It requires a dry, sandy  soil, and a warm climate; the pulp of the fruit is remarkably rich and  delicious.      What are Tamarinds?    The fruit of the Tamarind Tree, a native of both the Indies, Asia,  Africa, &c. It is of a roundish form, and composed of two pods  inclosed one within the other, between which is a soft pulpy  substance, of a tart but agreeable taste; the inner pod contains the  seeds or stones.         _Tart_, sharp, acid.      For what are they used?    We use them only as medicine; but the Africans, and many of the  Oriental nations, with whom they are common, make them into a kind of  preserve with sugar, which they eat as a delicacy, and which cools  them in the violent heats of their climate.      From what nation was the knowledge of their use in medicine obtained?    From the Arabians.      What does the word Oriental signify?    Belonging to the East; therefore those countries of the globe situated  in the East are called Oriental, those in the West, Occidental, from  _Oriens_, signifying East, and _Occidens_, West.      What are Dates?    The fruit of the Palm, a beautiful and graceful tree, peculiar to the  warmer regions of the globe; the growth of the palm is extremely  singular, for although some species attain to the height of the  largest forest trees, their structure differs materially from that of  a tree, properly so called. The leaves of the young plant arise  directly from the surface of the ground, and there is no appearance of  any stem for several years; this stem once formed, never increases in  size, the growth of the plant being always upward, so that the stem  itself is formed by the prior growth of the green portions of the  palm.         _Structure_, the manner of formation.      How often does this tree cast its circle of leaves?    Every year; so that the number of years a palm has existed is known by  the scars which are left by their falling off. The palm is an  evergreen.      What are the uses of this Tree?    The Palm is of the utmost importance to the inhabitants of the  tropical regions; the fruit and sap providing them with food, the  fibrous parts with clothing, and the leaves forming the greater part  of their slightly-constructed huts; the leaves of some species are  formed into fans, hats, and parasols; others are written on, in the  same manner that we write on paper; artificial flowers are made of  the pith of some; the light and supple rattan walking-cane is the  slender shoot of another kind; and solid and useful utensils are made  of the shell of the cocoa-nut. The fibres of the Date Palm are formed  into ropes and twine; a liquor is drawn from the trunk, called palm  wine; the trunks of the old trees furnish a hard and durable wood; and  even the nuts or stones of the fruit are useful for feeding cattle; a  wholesome flour is also made of the fruit, when dried and reduced to  powder.         _Constructed_, put together.      Whence is its name derived?    From the Latin word _palma_, a hand, given to these productions of the  vegetable world, from the supposed resemblance of their broad leaves  to the human hand. The Date, the fruit of the Date Palm, derives its  name from the Greek _dactylus_, a finger, from its mode of growing in  clusters spreading out like the fingers of the hand. The Palm  sometimes forms impenetrable forests; but more frequently is found in  small groups of two or three, or even singly, beside springs and  fountains of water, affording a kindly shade to the thirsty traveller.         _Impenetrable_, not easily penetrated or got through.      From what countries are Dates brought?    From Egypt, Syria, Persia, Africa, and the Indies. Among the Egyptians  and Africans, they make a principal article of food. Dates, when ripe,  are of a bright coral red, of an oblong form, and possess a sharp  biting taste: they are usually gathered in autumn, before being  perfectly ripe.          CHAPTER IX.    HATS, STOCKINGS, SHOES, GLOVES, LEATHER, FURS, AND INK.      Of what are Hats made?    Of felt and wool. Dress hats for men's wear, were formerly made of  beaver-fur, but the increasing scarcity of this article led to the  introduction of silk plush as a substitute, and the result is that  beaver is entirely superseded, and plush is used altogether. They  possess many advantages over the beaver hat, as they are light,  glossy, and durable. Hats are also made of straw, plaited and sewed  together.      When did Hats come into general use?    The first mention made of hats is about the time of the Saxons, but  they were not worn except by the rich. Hats for men were invented at  Paris, by a Swiss, in 1404. About the year 1510, they were first  manufactured in London, by Spaniards. Before that time both men and  women in England commonly wore close, knitted, woollen caps. They  appear to have become more common in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. It  is related, that when Charles the Second made his public entry into  Rouen, in 1449, he wore a hat lined with red velvet, surmounted with a  plume or tuft of feathers; from which entry, or at least during his  reign, the use of hats and caps is to be dated; and from that time  they took the place of chaperons and hoods, that had been worn before  in France.      Where is Rouen?    In the province of Lower Seine, in France; it was formerly the capital  of Normandy.      Describe the Castor, or Beaver, and its habits.    The Beaver has a broad, flat tail, covered with scales, serving as a  rudder to direct its motion in the water; the toes of its hind feet  are furnished with membranes, after the manner of water-fowl; the fore  feet supply the place of hands, like those of the squirrel. The  Beaver has two kinds of hair, of a light brown color, one long and  coarse, the other short and silky. The teeth resemble those of a rat  or squirrel, but are longer, and admirably adapted for cutting timber  or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16737"],[0,"International Language, Past, Present & Future (#11)"],[1,"engine, the typewriter, shorthand, the semaphore, and all     kinds of signals. What are the philosophical _differentia_ that make     Esperanto a toy, and natural language God's handiwork? Apparently     the fact that Esperanto is 'artificial,' i.e. consciously produced     by art. If this is the criterion, beware lest you damn man's works     wholesale. If this is not the criterion, what is?          \"'An Englishman who knows French and German would do much better     to devote any extra time at his disposal to the study of his own     language.' Yes--if his object is to qualify as an artist in language.     No--if his object is to save time and trouble in communicating with     foreigners. You must compare like with like. It is unscientific     and a confusion of thought to change the subject-matter of a     man's employment of his time on grounds other than those fairly     intercomparable. You have dictated as to how a man should employ     his time by changing his object in employing his time. This makes     the whole discussion irrelevant, in so far as it deals with the     comparative advantage of studying one language or the other.          \"Time's up! I have missed my after-lunch walk, and I expect only     hardened your heart.                                                             \"Yours,                                                                 \"----.\"    And I had!                                        XII         WILL AN INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE DISCOURAGE THE STUDY OF MODERN          LANGUAGES, AND THUS BE DETRIMENTAL TO CULTURE?--PARALLEL                   WITH THE QUESTION OF COMPULSORY GREEK    There is a broad, twofold distinction in the aims with which the study  of foreign languages is organized and undertaken.    It serves: first, purely utilitarian ends, and is a means; secondly, the  purposes of culture, and is an end in itself.    An international auxiliary language aims at supplanting the first type  of study completely, and, as it claims, with profit to the students. The  second type it hopes to leave wholly intact, and disclaims any attempt  to interfere with it in any way. How far is this possible?    The answer depends mainly upon the efficiency of the alternative offered  by the new-comer in each case as a possible substitute.    Firstly, if it is true that a great portion of the human race,  especially in the big polyglot empires and the smaller states of Europe,  are groaning under the incubus of the language difficulty, and have to  spend years on the study of mere words before they can fit themselves  for an active career, then the abolition of this heavy handicap on  due preparation for each man's proper business in life will liberate  much time for more profitable studies. It is certain that the majority  of mankind are non-linguistic by nature and inclination rather than  linguistic--i.e. that the best chance of developing their natural  capacities to the utmost and making them useful and agreeable members of  society does not lie in making all alike swallow an overdose of foreign  languages during the acquisitive years of youth. By doing so, vast waste  is caused, taking the world round. As to the attainment of the object  of this first type of language study, not only is it as efficiently  secured by a single universal language, but far more so. _Ex hypothesi_  the object is utilitarian; the language is a means. Well, a universal  language is a better means than a national one--first, because, being  universal, it is a means to more; secondly, because, being easy and  one, it is a means that more people can grasp and employ. In fact, it  is in this field an efficient substitute; it saves much, without losing  anything.    For the second type of language-study, on the other hand, where the  end is culture and the language is studied for itself and in no wise  as an indifferent means, a universal artificial language offers no  substitute at all. This end is not on its programme. Why, then, should  any language-study that is organized in view of culture be given up on  its account?    It may, of course, be said that the time given to it by those who pursue  culture in language will be taken from the time devoted to more worthy  linguistic study, and will therefore prejudice the learning of other  languages. This is a point of technical pedagogics or psychology. There  is very good reason, from the standpoint of these sciences, to believe  that a study of a simple _type-tongue_ would, on the contrary, pay for  itself in increased facility in learning other languages. But this is  more fully discussed in the chapter for teachers (see pp. 145-55) [Part  III, Chapter I].    The question, however, is not in reality quite so simple as this.  There is no water-tight partition between utilitarian and cultural  language-study. They act and react upon each other. There really is some  ground for anxiety, lest the provision of facilities for learning an  easy artificial language at your door may prevent people from going out  of their way to learn national ones, which would have awakened scholarly  instincts in them. The cause of culture would thus sustain some real  hurt.    The question is another phase--a wider and lower-grade phase--of the  great compulsory Greek question at Oxford and Cambridge. It affects the  masses, whereas the Greek controversy affects the few at the top; but  otherwise the issue at stake is essentially the same.    In both cases the bedrock of the problem is this, Can we afford to put  the many through a grind, which is on the whole unprofitable to them and  does not attain its object of conferring culture, in order to uphold  the traditional system in the interests of the few? In neither case do  the reformers desire to suppress the study of the old culture-giving  language; rather it is hoped that the interests of scholarly and liberal  learning will benefit by being freed from the dead weight of grammar  grinders, whose mechanical performance and monkey antics are merely a  dodge to catch a copper from the examiners.    When Greek is no longer bolstered up by the protection of compulsion,  some of the present bounty-fed (i.e. compulsion-fed) facilities for its  study will no doubt disappear from the schools which are at present  forced to provide them. With them will be lost some recruits who would  have been led by the facilities to study Greek, and would have studied  it to their profit. On the other hand, the university will be open to  numbers of students who are at present shut out by the Greek tariff.  Another barrier against modernity will go down, and democracy make  another step out of the proverbial gutter towards the university.    Similarly, the possession of a universally understood medium of  communication will in some cases deter people from making the effort to  study real language, with all the treasures of original literature to  which it is the key.                \"Tis true, 'tis pity; and pity 'tis, 'tis true.    But--and this is the great point--it will open the cosmopolitan outlook  to countless thousands who could never hope to grapple successfully with  even one national language. This cannot be a small gain.    It all comes back to this--you cannot eat your cake and have it too.  _Il faut souffrir pour être belle._ The international language has the  defects of its qualities. But then its qualities are great, and the  world is their sphere of utility.                                        XIII                 OBJECTION TO AN INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE ON THE              GROUND THAT IT WILL SOON SPLIT UP INTO DIALECTS    This is a particularly unfortunate objection, because it displays a  radical ignorance of the history of language, and of the conditions  under which it develops.    In the first place, the whole tendency of language in the modern world  is towards disappearance of local dialects, and their absorption into  a uniform literary language. The dialects of England are almost dead  before the onset of universal education, and the great work of Dr.  Wright was only just in time to rescue them from oblivion. Even one  generation hence it will be impossible to collect much of the local  speech recorded in his dictionary. It is the same in Germany and  everywhere, though, of course, all countries are not equally advanced  in this respect. A standard form of words and grammar is fixed by print  for the literary language, and when every one can read and write, it is  all up with national evolution of language, such as has produced all  national languages. A gradual change of the phonetic value given to the  written symbols there may be. This has been pre-eminently the case in  England, though even this will now be arrested by universal education.  But a change of forms or of grammar can only be indefinitely slight  and gradual. When it takes place, it reflects a common advance of the  literary language, and not local or dialectical variation (though the  common advance may have originally spread from one locality).    In the second place, dialects are variations that spring up under the  stress of local circumstance in the familiar every-day unconscious use  of a common mother tongue among people of the same race and inhabiting  the same district. Now, these are the very circumstances in which an  auxiliary international language never can, and never will, be used. The  only exception is the case of people meeting together for the conscious  practice of the language or using it in jest.    There are no occasions when an international language would be naturally  used when any variation from standard usage would not be a distinct  disadvantage as tending to unintelligibility. In short, a neutral  language consciously learned as a means of communication with strangers  is not on an equal footing with, or exposed to the same influences as, a  mother tongue used by people every day under like conditions.
