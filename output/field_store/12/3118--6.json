On December 24 the Germans showed their Christian spirit in an  inauguration of the birthday of Christ by the first air raid over  England. The latter part of the year 1914 saw no important action by the  United States excepting a proclamation by the president of the  neutrality of the Panama canal zone.    The events of 1915 and succeeding years became of great importance to  the United States and it is with a record of those having the greatest  bearing on our country that this account principally will deal.    On January 20 Secretary of State Bryan found it necessary to explain and  defend our policy of neutrality. January 28 the American merchantman  William P. Frye was sunk by the German cruiser Prinz Eitel Friedrich. On  February 10 the United States dispatched a note to the German government  holding it to a \"strict accountability if any merchant vessel of the  United States is destroyed or any American citizens lose their lives.\"  Germany replied February 16 stating that her \"war zone\" act was an act  of self-defense against illegal methods employed by Great Britain in  preventing commerce between Germany and neutral countries. Two days  later the German official blockade of Great Britain commenced and the  German submarines began their campaign of piracy and pillage.    The United States on February 20 sent an identic note to Germany and  Great Britain suggesting an agreement between them respecting the  conduct of naval warfare. The British steamship Falaba was sunk by a  submarine March 28, with a loss of 111 lives, one of which was an  American. April 8 the steamer Harpalyce, in the service of the American  commission for the aid of Belgium, was torpedoed with a loss of 15  lives. On April 22 the German embassy in America sent out a warning  against embarkation on vessels belonging to Great Britain. The American  vessel Cushing was attacked by a German aeroplane April 28. On May 1 the  American steamship Gullflight was sunk by a German submarine and two  Americans were lost. That day the warning of the German embassy was  published in the daily papers. The Lusitania sailed at 12:20 noon.    Five days later occurred the crime which almost brought America into the  second year of the war. The Cunard line steamship Lusitania was sunk by  a German submarine with a loss of 1,154 lives, of which 114 were  Americans. After the policy of frightfulness put into effect by the  Germans in Belgium and other invaded territories, the massacres of  civilians, the violation of women and killing of children; burning,  looting and pillage; the destruction of whole towns, acts for which no  military necessity could be pleaded, civilization should have been  prepared for the Lusitania crime. But it seems it was not. The burst of  indignation throughout the United States was terrible. Here was where  the terms German and Hun became synonomous, having in mind the methods  and ravages of the barbaric scourge Attilla, king of the Huns, who in  the fifth century sacked a considerable portion of Europe and introduced  some refinements in cruelty which have never been excelled.    The Lusitania went down twenty-one minutes after the attack. The Berlin  government pleaded in extenuation of the sinking that the ship was  armed, and German agents in New York procured testimony which was  subsequently proven in court to have been perjured, to bolster up the  falsehood. In further justification, the German government adduced the  fact that the ship was carrying ammunition which it said was \"destined  for the destruction of brave German soldiers.\" This contention our  government rightly brushed aside as irrelevant.    The essence of the case was stated by our government in its note of June  9 as follows:         \"Whatever be the other facts regarding the Lusitania, the principal       fact is that a great steamer, primarily and chiefly a conveyance       for passengers, and carrying more than a thousand souls who had no       part or lot in the conduct of the war, was sunk without so much as       a challenge or a warning, and that men, women and children were       sent to their death in circumstances unparalleled in modern       warfare.\"    Three notes were written to Germany regarding the Lusitania sinking. The  first dated May 13 advanced the idea that it was impossible to conduct  submarine warfare conformably with international law. In the second  dated June 9 occurs the statement that \"the government of the United  States is contending for something much greater than mere rights of  property or privileges of commerce. It is contending for nothing less  high and sacred than the rights of humanity.\" In the third note dated  July 21, it is asserted that \"the events of the past two months have  clearly indicated that it is possible and practicable to conduct  submarine operations within the so-called war zone in substantial accord  with the accepted practices of regulated warfare.\" The temper of the  American people and the president's notes had succeeded in securing a  modification of the submarine campaign.    It required cool statesmanship to prevent a rushing into war over the  Lusitania incident and events which had preceeded it. There was a well  developed movement in favor of it, but the people were not unanimous on  the point. It would have lacked that cooperation necessary for  effectiveness; besides our country was but poorly prepared for engaging  in hostilities. It was our state of unpreparedness continuing for a long  time afterwards, which contributed, no doubt, to German arrogance. They  thought we would not fight.    But the United States had become thoroughly awakened and the authorities  must have felt that if the conflict was to be unduly prolonged, we must  eventually be drawn into it. This is reflected in the modified  construction which the president and others began to place on the  Monroe Doctrine. The great underlying idea of the doctrine remained  vital, but in a message to congress delivered December 7, 1915, the  president said:    \"In the day in whose light we now stand there is no claim of  guardianship, but a full and honorable association as of partners  between ourselves and our neighbors in the interests of America.\"  Speaking before the League to Enforce Peace at Washington, May 27, 1916,  he said: \"What affects mankind is inevitably our affair, as well as the  affair of the nations of Europe and of Asia.\" In his address to the  senate of January 22, 1917, he said: \"I am proposing, as it were, that  the nations should with one accord adopt the doctrine of President  Monroe as the doctrine of the world--that no nation should seek to  extend its policy over any other nation or people, but that every people  should be left free to determine its own policy, its own way of  development, unhindered, unthreatened, unafraid, the little along with  the great and powerful.\" This was a modifying and enlarging of the  doctrine, as well as a departure from Washington's warning against  becoming entangled with the affairs of Europe.          CHAPTER V    HUNS SWEEPING WESTWARD      TOWARD SHORES OF ATLANTIC--SPREAD RUIN AND DEVASTATION--CAPITALS OF  CIVILIZATION ALARMED--ACTIVITIES OF SPIES--APOLOGIES AND LIES--GERMAN  ARMS WINNING--GAIN TIME TO FORGE NEW WEAPONS--FEW VICTORIES FOR  ALLIES--ROUMANIA CRUSHED--INCIDENT OF U-53.      The powerful thrusts of the German armies toward the English channel and  the Atlantic ocean, the pitiless submarine policy, and the fact that  Germany and Austria had allied with them Bulgaria and Turkey, began to  spread alarm in the non-belligerent nations of the world.    That Germany was playing a Machiavellian policy against the United  States soon became evident. After each submarine outrage would come an  apology, frequently a promise of reparation and an agreement not to  repeat the offense, with no intention, however, of keeping faith in any  respect. As a mask for their duplicity, the Germans even sent a message  of sympathy for the loss of American lives through the sinking of the  Lusitania; which but intensified the state of mind in this country.    Less than three weeks after the Lusitania outrage the American steamship  Nebraskan was attacked (May 25) by a submarine. The American steamship  Leelanaw was sunk by submarines July 25. The White Star liner Arabic was  sunk by a submarine August 19; sixteen victims, two American.    Our government received August 24 a note from the German ambassador  regarding the sinking of the Arabic. It stated that the loss of American  lives was contrary to the intention of the German government and was  deeply regretted. On September 1 Ambassador von Bernstorff supplemented  the note with a letter to Secretary Lansing giving assurance that German  submarines would sink no more liners.    The Allan liner Hesperian was sunk September 4 by a German submarine; 26  lives lost, one American.    On October 5 the German government sent a communication regretting again  and disavowing the sinking of the Arabic, and stating its willingness to  pay indemnities.    Meanwhile depression existed among the Allies and alarm among nations  outside the war over the German conquest of Russian Poland. They  captured Lublin, July 31; Warsaw, August 4; Ivangorod, August 5; Kovno,  August 17; Novogeorgievsk, August 19; Brest-Litovsk, August 25, and  Vilna, September 18.    Activities of spies and plottings within the United States began to  divide attention with the war in Europe and the submarine situation. Dr.  Constantin Dumba, who was Austro-Hungarian ambassador to the United  States, in a letter to the Austrian minister of foreign affairs, dated  August 20, recommended \"most warmly\" to the favorable consideration of  the foreign office \"proposals with respect to the preparation of  disturbances in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1662"],[0,"The 1997 CIA World Factbook (#11)"],[1,"the pollution of rivers and coastal waters; Mediterranean Sea, in  particular, becoming polluted from oil wastes, soil erosion, and  fertilizer runoff; inadequate supplies of potable water    Environment - international agreements:  party to : Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered  Species, Environmental Modification, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer  Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands  signed, but not ratified: Nuclear Test Ban    Geography - note: second-largest country in Africa (after Sudan)    @Algeria:People    Population: 29,830,370 (July 1997 est.)

Algiers' efforts  to reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the Arab  world began after the 1986 collapse of world oil prices plunged the  country into a severe recession. In 1989, the government launched a  comprehensive, IMF-supported program to achieve economic stabilization  and to introduce market mechanisms into the economy. Despite  substantial progress toward economic adjustment, in 1992 the reform  drive stalled as Algiers became embroiled in political turmoil. In  September 1993, a new government was formed, and one priority was the  resumption and acceleration of the structural adjustment process.  Buffeted by the slump in world oil prices and burdened with a heavy  foreign debt, Algiers concluded a one-year standby arrangement with  the IMF in April 1994. Following a Paris Club debt rescheduling in  1995, a robust harvest, and elevated oil prices, the economy  experienced a strong recovery and key economic improvements. Recent  and planned investments in developing hydrocarbon resources are likely  to increase growth and export earnings.    GDP: purchasing power parity - $115.9 billion (1996 est.)
