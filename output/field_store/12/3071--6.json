The Professor's  pupils were supposed to have been sufficiently advanced in the technic  necessary for them to profit by his wonderful lessons in  interpretation. Yet there were all sorts of technical _finesses_ which  he had up his sleeve, any number of fine, subtle points in playing as  well as interpretation which he would disclose to his pupils. And the  more interest and ability the pupil showed, the more the Professor gave  him of himself! He is a very great teacher! Bowing, the true art of  bowing, is one of the greatest things in Professor Auer's teaching. I  know when I first came to the Professor, he showed me things in bowing I  had never learned in Vilna. It is hard to describe in words (Mr. Heifetz  illustrated with some of those natural, unstrained movements of arm and  wrist which his concert appearances have made so familiar), but bowing  as Professor Auer teaches it is a very special thing; the movements of  the bow become more easy, graceful, less stiff.    \"In class there were usually from twenty-five to thirty pupils. Aside  from what we each gained individually from the Professor's criticism and  correction, it was interesting to hear the others who played before  one's turn came, because one could get all kinds of hints from what  Professor Auer told them. I know I always enjoyed listening to Poliakin,  a very talented violinist, and Cecile Hansen, who attended the classes  at the same time I did. The Professor was a stern and very exacting, but  a sympathetic, teacher. If our playing was not just what it should be he  always had a fund of kindly humor upon which to draw. He would  anticipate our stock excuses and say: 'Well, I suppose you have just had  your bow rehaired!' or 'These new strings are very trying,' or 'It's the  weather that is against you again, is it not?' or something of the kind.  Examinations were not so easy: we had to show that we were not only  soloists, but also sight readers of difficult music.                                A DIFFICULTY OVERCOME    \"The greatest technical difficulty I had when I was studying?\" Jascha  Heifetz tried to recollect, which was natural, seeing that it must have  been one long since overcome. Then he remembered, and smiled:  \"_Staccato_ playing. To get a good _staccato_, when I first tried seemed  very hard to me. When I was younger, really, at one time I had a very  poor _staccato_!\" [I assured the young artist that any one who heard him  play here would find it hard to believe this.] \"Yes, I did,\" he  insisted, \"but one morning, I do not know just how it was--I was  playing the _cadenza_ in the first movement of Wieniawski's F{~MUSIC SHARP SIGN~} minor  concerto,--it is full of _staccatos_ and double stops--the right way of  playing _staccato_ came to me quite suddenly, especially after Professor  Auer had shown me his method.                                    VIOLIN MASTERY    \"Violin Mastery? To me it means the ability to make the violin a  perfectly controlled instrument guided by the skill and intelligence of  the artist, to compel it to respond in movement to his every wish. The  artist must always be superior to his instrument, it must be his  servant, one that he can do with what he will.                          TECHNICAL MASTERY AND TEMPERAMENT    \"It appears to me that mastery of the technic of the violin is not so  much of a mechanical accomplishment as it is of mental nature. It may be  that scientists can tell us how through persistency the brain succeeds  in making the fingers and the arms produce results through the infinite  variety of inexplicable vibrations. The sweetness of tone, its  melodiousness, its _legatos_, octaves, trills and harmonics all bear  the mark of the individual who uses his strings like his vocal chords.  When an artist is working over his harmonics, he must not be impatient  and force purity, pitch, or the right intonation. He must coax the tone,  try it again and again, seek for improvements in his fingering as well  as in his bowing at the same time, and sometimes he may be surprised  how, quite suddenly, at the time when he least expects it, the result  has come. More than one road leads to Rome! The fact is that when you  get it, you have it, that's all! I am perfectly willing to disclose to  the musical profession all the secrets of the mastery of violin technic;  but are there any secrets in the sense that some of the uninitiated take  them? If an artist happens to excel in some particular, he is at once  suspected of knowing some secret means of so doing. However, that may  not be the case. He does it just because it is in him, and as a rule he  accomplishes this through his mental faculties more than through his  mechanical abilities. I do not intend to minimize the value of great  teachers who prove to be important factors in the life of a musician;  but think of the vast army of pupils that a master teacher brings  forth, and listen to the infinite variety of their _spiccatos_,  octaves, _legatos_, and trills! For the successful mastery of violin  technic let each artist study carefully his own individuality, let him  concentrate his mental energy on the quality of pitch he intends to  produce, and sooner or later he will find his way of expressing himself.  Music is not only in the fingers or in the elbow. It is in that  mysterious EGO of the man, it is his soul; and his body is like his  violin, nothing but a tool. Of course, the great master must have the  tools that suit him best, and it is the happy combination that makes for  success.    \"By the vibrations and modulations of the notes one may recognize the  violinist as easily as we recognize the singer by his voice. Who can  explain how the artist harmonizes the trilling of his fingers with the  emotions of his soul?    \"An artist will never become great through mere imitation, and never  will he be able to attain the best results only by methods adopted by  others. He must have his own initiative, although he will surely profit  by the experience of others. Of course there are standard ways of  approaching the study of violin technic; but these are too well known to  dwell upon them: as to the niceties of the art, they must come from  within. You can make a musician but not an artist!                                REPERTORY AND PROGRAMS    \"Which of the master works do I like best? Well, that is rather hard to  answer. Each master work has its own beauties. Naturally one likes best  what one understands best, I prefer to play the classics like Brahms,  Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, Mendelssohn, etc. However, I played Bruch's G  minor in 1913 at the Leipzig Gewandhouse with Nikisch, where I was told  that Joachim was the only other violinist as young as myself to appear  there as soloist with orchestra; there is the Tschaikovsky concerto  which I played in Berlin in 1912, with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra  with Nikisch. Alsa Bruch's D minor and many more. I played the  Mendelssohn concerto in 1914, in Vienna, with Safonoff as conductor.  Last season in Chicago I played the Brahms concerto with a fine and very  elaborate _cadenza_ by Professor Auer. I think the Brahms concerto for  violin is like Chopin's music for piano, in a way, because it stands  technically and musically for something quite different and distinct  from other violin music, just as Chopin does from other piano music. The  Brahms concerto is not technically as hard as, say, Paganini--but in  interpretation!... And in the Beethoven concerto, too, there is a  simplicity, a kind of clear beauty which makes it far harder to play  than many other things technically more advanced. The slightest flaw,  the least difference in pitch, in intonation, and its beauty suffers.    \"Yes, there are other Russian concertos besides the Tschaikovsky. There  is the Glazounov concerto and others. I understand that Zimbalist was  the first to introduce it in this country, and I expect to play it here  next season.    \"Of course one cannot always play concertos, and one cannot always play  Bach and Beethoven. And that makes it hard to select programs. The  artist can always enjoy the great music of his instrument; but an  audience wants variety. At the same time an artist cannot play only just  what the majority of the audience wants. I have been asked to play  Schubert's _Ave Maria_, or Beethoven's _Chorus of Dervishes_ at every  one of my concerts, but I simply cannot play them all the time. I am  afraid if program making were left altogether to audiences the programs  would become far too popular in character; though audiences are just as  different as individuals. I try hard to balance my programs, so that  every one can find something to understand and enjoy. I expect to  prepare some American compositions for next season. Oh, no, not as a  matter of courtesy, but because they are really fine, especially some  smaller pieces by Spalding, Cecil Burleigh and Grasse!\"    On concluding our interview Mr. Heifetz made a remark which is worth  repeating, and which many a music lover who is _plus royaliste que le  roi_ might do well to remember: \"After all,\" he said, \"much as I love  music, I cannot help feeling that music is not the only thing in life. I  really cannot imagine anything more terrible than always to hear, think  and make music! There is so much else to know and appreciate; and I feel  that the more I learn and know of other things the better artist I will  be!\"                                            VIII                                  DAVID HOCHSTEIN                     THE VIOLIN AS A MEANS OF EXPRESSION                          AND EXPRESSIVE PLAYING      The writer talked with Lieutenant David Hochstein, whose death in the  battle of the Argonne Forest was only reported toward the end of  January, while the distinguished young violinist, then only a sergeant,  was on the eve of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15540"],[0,"Across India; Or, Live Boys in the Far East (#11)"],[1," owned by Sir Modava, the most devoted friend of his  lordship, in which he had been all around the peninsula, and up several of  its rivers, we embarked for Muscat, and safely reached that country. Then  the viscount decided to proceed to Aden, where he had important business;  for he intended to return to England by the Euphrates route, in order to  inform himself in regard to the navigation of the river. We sailed for  Aden, believing we should have the calm and pleasant weather of the  north-east monsoon.    \"Yesterday we encountered the gale from the south-west, which was very  unusual. But the Travancore was an able seaboat, and we went along very  well until we were run into by a steamer in the darkness and mist early  this morning. The side of the little steamer was stove in, and she began to  fill. We put on our life-preservers, and prepared for the worst. We  stretched a life-line fore and aft, and listened to the gurgling waters  below deck. Suddenly, when she was partly filled with water, she capsized.  We clung to the life-line, which unhitched forward.    \"Of course we expected she would go down; but she did not for several  hours. We had our life-preservers on, and we made fast the lines forward,  which saved us from being washed off the bottom of the vessel. I had a  revolver in my pocket, and when I saw the port light of your steamer, I  fired it, and we all shouted at the top of our lungs.    \"We could hear the air and the water bubbling and hissing under us at  times, and it was understood that the confined air above the water in the  hull had kept her afloat. But this air had all escaped as the  Guardian-mother approached us, and with no warning she went to the bottom.  We were floated by our life-preservers till your boats picked us up, though  we were fearfully shaken and tossed about by the waves. Our gallant  saviours know how we were rescued--all honor and glory to them!\"    The doctor finished his explanation and took his seat.                                           CHAPTER VIII                          AN INTERVIEW IN THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN      \"Our log-book indicates that we passed a steamer to the northward of us at  four bells in the mid-watch,\" said Captain Ringgold, when Dr. Ferrolan  finished his narrative. \"She was headed about west by south; and very  likely it was the one which ran into the Travancore, for no other was  reported.\"    \"She was a vessel of about four hundred tons,\" added the viscount. \"I was  in the pilot-house at the time, though the weather was so thick that I  could hardly make her out as she slipped off from our starboard bow, and  went on her course.\"    \"Didn't she hail you, and offer to stand by you?\"  inquired the commander.    \"I heard something like a shout coming from her, and in a moment she was  beyond hailing-distance. I supposed we were going to the bottom in a few  minutes, and had my hands full, so that I had no time to look out for her,  though I supposed she would come about and render assistance; but we did  not hear from her again.\"    \"It is possible that she did so, and was unable to find you, for it was  very dark, and the sea was very rough,\" suggested the commander. \"But her  conduct looks heathenish, and I will warrant that she was not an English  steamer; for the British tars never pass by their fellow-beings on the  ocean in distress without rendering assistance.\"    \"It was a new experience to me,\" added his lordship, \"and perhaps I  neglected something I ought to have done.\"    \"I think not; for your first and supreme duty at that time was to look out  for the safety of your own vessel,\" replied Captain Ringgold.    \"So far as that was concerned, I believe I did all I could do to repair the  mischief,\" continued the viscount. \"The chief engineer reported to me that  the side of the yacht was stove in near the bow, and that the water was  pouring into the hull. He suggested that a double sailcloth be hauled under  the vessel. We had no sails, but we promptly made use of an awning, and we  succeeded in drawing it under the bottom, and covering the aperture.\"    \"That was precisely the right thing to do,\" said the commander.    \"Probably it enabled us to float a short time longer than we should  otherwise have done; but the yacht had taken in too much water before we  applied the remedy, for suddenly, on the top of a huge wave, she made a  heavy roll, capsized, and came up with her keel in the air. I am only  afraid that I did not do all that might have been done.\"    \"I could have done no more if I had been there with all my ship's company,\"  the commander declared; for the amateur captain of the Travancore was a  conscientious man, and desired to relieve his mind of all blame for his  conduct; and he had really done all that could be done, though the remedy  applied was a failure.    \"My chief engineer was an experienced man, and I followed his counsels in  everything,\" added the viscount.    \"His lordship did all that it was possible for any man to do in such a  case,\" interposed the chief engineer of the Travancore, who was seated on  the platform. \"I can only thank God that we were all saved, and I am sure  that no one is to blame.\"    \"I am told that our cabin waiter and four coolies were picked up by the  other steamer,\" said Lord Tremlyn, as he looked about him.    \"That is true, sir,\" interposed Mr. Boulong, who stood on the deck by the  platform. \"Sir Modava told me there were eleven persons on board of the  wreck. I saw that number saved myself.\"    The details of the wreck of the Travancore were fully explained, though  individuals continued to talk about it until lunch-time. At the mid-day  repast the commander gave up his plan of seating the party, and invited the  members of it to select their own places; and they all took those they had  occupied at breakfast. In the afternoon the rough sea had almost entirely  subsided under the influence of the north-east monsoon, and the motion of  the steamer was easy and pleasant.    The company assembled in the music-room after a walk on deck, and the  captain, with the three notable guests, joined them after they had finished  their cigars; for all of them smoked. The \"Gospel Hymns\" and other hymn and  tune books were distributed. It was the usual time for singing, and the  trio from the Travancore contributed largely to the volume of tone on the  occasion. The new third officer had been stationed in the watch with Mr.  Boulong, and Scott had the first part of the afternoon watch. The officers  and engineers not on duty, as well as the members of the party from the  wreck, gathered at the windows of the music-room, and the commander invited  them to take seats in the apartment, thus adding still more to the volume  of the harmony. The music was all sacred, and nothing purely secular was  permitted by the captain.    Dr. Ferrolan, who had a fine bass voice, was invited to sing \"Rocked in the  Cradle of the Deep,\" at the suggestion of Lord Tremlyn. His lordship sang  \"Oh that I had Wings!\" and Mrs. Belgrave, who was the pianist of the  occasion, gave a solo, while Sir Modava sang the \"Missionary Hymn,\" which  is still a favorite in England and America, translated into the Hindu  language. The party who could not understand him followed in the  hymn-books.    \"I wonder who wrote that beautiful hymn,\" said Mrs. Blossom, when there was  a pause as the singer finished. \"It says Heber in my book, but I don't know  who he was.\"    \"Reginald Heber was an English clergyman and poet, born in 1783. He was a  student in an Oxford college; I forget which,\" replied Sir Modava.    \"Brasenose,\" prompted the viscount.    \"As a student in this college he wrote 'Palestine,' for which he obtained  the prize; and it still holds a place in the literature of England. He soon  obtained a living, and occupied a prominent position among the clergy of  his native island. In 1823 he was made Bishop of Calcutta.    \"Three years later, in the midst of his zealous labors in the service of  his Master, he died at Trichinopoly of apoplexy, greatly lamented. Perhaps                      'From Greenland's icy mountains,                       From India's coral strand,'    which you have sung this afternoon, is the widest-known of Bishop Heber's  hymns; but will you indulge me if I ask you to sing another of them, which  I find in the book I hold in my hand?--                 'Brightest and best of the sons of the morning,                  Dawn on our darkness, and lend us thine aid.'\"    The hymn was sung to Mozart's music by about twenty voices, and the effect  was exceedingly agreeable. Sir Modava seemed to be in a rapture, as the  piece was his favorite, and came from one who was connected with his native  land.    He was a rather tall and slender man, and all the ladies declared that he  was very handsome; and his slightly dusky hue added to, rather than took  from, the beauty of his countenance. He wore a small mustache, but no other  beard. He was a nervous and highly sensitive person, and there was always a  smile on his face. He had already become a favorite among the gentlemen as  well as the ladies.    Another meeting was held in the evening, which was varied by some speaking  on the part of the gentlemen, including the guests, Uncle Moses, Dr.  Hawkes, and the commander. At the conclusion of the exercises, Sir Modava  begged the company to close by singing another of Bishop Heber's verses,  which he repeated from memory, though it was in one of the books:--               \"God that madest earth and heaven,                Darkness and light;              Who the day for toil hast given,                For rest the night,--              May thine angel guards defend us,              Slumber sweet thy mercy send us,                This livelong night!\"    With this musical prayer on their lips, the company retired. Most of them  went to their staterooms; for the guests were very tired, and the regular  "]]]
