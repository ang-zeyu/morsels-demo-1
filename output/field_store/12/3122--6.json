They urged that the pope had been misinformed,  and declined to recall the exile. Honorius sent his chaplain Otto to  England, but the nuncio found it impossible to modify the policy of the  advisers of the king. Falkes went back from Italy to Troyes, where he  waited for a year in the hope that his sentence would be reversed. At  last Otto gave up his cause in despair, and devoted himself to the more  profitable work of exacting money from the English clergy. Falkes died  in 1226. With him disappears from our history the lawless spirit which  had troubled the land since the war between John and his barons. The  foreign adventurers, of whom he was the chief, either went back in  disgust to their native lands, or, like Peter de Mauley, became loyal  subjects and the progenitors of a harmless stock of English barons. The  ten years of storm and stress were over. The administration was once  more in English hands, and Hubert enjoyed a few years of well-earned  power.    New difficulties at once arose. The defeat of the feudalists and their  Welsh allies involved heavy special taxation, and the king's honour  required that an effort should be made both to wrest Poitou from Louis  VIII., and to strengthen the English hold over Gascony. Besides  national obligations, clergy and laity alike were still called upon to  contribute towards the cost of crusading enterprises, and in 1226 the  papal nuncio, Otto, demanded that a large proportion of the revenues of  the English clergy should be contributed to the papal coffers. To the  Englishman of that age all extraordinary taxation was a grievance quite  irrespective of its necessity. The double incidence of the royal and  papal demands was met by protests which showed some tendency towards  the splitting up of the victorious side into parties. It was still easy  for all to unite against Otto, and the papal agent was forced to go  home empty handed, for councils both of clergy and barons agreed to  reject his demands. Whatever other nations might offer to the pope,  argued the magnates, the realms of England and Ireland at least had a  right to be freed from such impositions by reason of the tribute which  John had agreed to pay to Innocent III. The demand of the king's  ministers for a fifteenth to prosecute the war with France was  reluctantly conceded, but only on the condition of a fresh confirmation  of the charters in a form intended to bring home to the king his  personal obligation to observe them. Hubert de Burgh, however, was no  enthusiast for the charters. His standpoint was that of the officials  of the age of Henry II. To him the re-establishment of order meant the  restoration of the prerogative. There he parted company with the  archbishop, who was an eager upholder of the charters, for which he was  so largely responsible. The struggle against the foreigner was to be  succeeded by a struggle for the charters.    In January, 1227, a council met at Oxford. The king, then nearly twenty  years old, declared that he would govern the country himself, and  renounced the tutelage of the Bishop of Winchester. Henry gave himself  over completely to the justiciar, whom he rewarded for his faithful  service by making him Earl of Kent. In deep disgust Bishop Peter left  the court to carry out his long-deferred crusading vows. For four years  he was absent in Palestine, where his military talents had ample scope  as one of the leaders of Frederick II.'s army, while his diplomatic  skill sought, with less result, to preserve some sort of relations  between the excommunicated emperor and the new pope, Gregory IX., who  in this same year succeeded Honorius. In April Gregory renewed the bull  of 1223 in which his predecessor recognised Henry's competence to  govern.    Thus ended the first minority since the Conquest. The successful  restoration of law and order when the king was a child, showed that a  strong king was not absolutely necessary for good government. From the  exercise of royal authority by ministers without the personal  intervention of the monarch arose the ideas of limited monarchy, the  responsibility of the official, and the constitutional rights of the  baronial council to appoint ministers and control the administration.  We also discern, almost for the first time, the action of an inner  ministerial council which was ultimately to develop into the _consilium  ordinarium_ of a later age.    No sudden changes attended the royal majority. Those who had persuaded  Henry to dismiss Bishop Peter had no policy beyond getting rid of a  hated rival. The new Earl of Kent continued to hold office as justiciar  for five years, and his ascendency is even more marked in the years  1227 to 1232 than it had been between 1224 and 1227. Hubert still found  the task of ruling England by no means easy. With the mitigation of  home troubles foreign affairs assumed greater importance, and England's  difficulties with France, the efforts to establish cordial relations  with the empire, the ever-increasing aggressions of Llewelyn of Wales,  and the chronic troubles of Ireland, involved the country in large  expenses with little compensating advantage. Not less uneasy were the  results of the growing encroachments of the papacy and the increasing  inability of the English clergy to face them. Papal taxation, added to  the burden of national taxation, induced discontent that found a ready  scapegoat in the justiciar. The old and the new baronial opposition  combined to denounce Hubert as the true cause of all evils. The  increasing personal influence of the young king complicated the  situation. In his efforts to deal with all these problems Hubert became  involved in the storm of obloquy which finally brought about his fall.    At the accession of Henry III., the truce for five years concluded  between his father and Philip Augustus on September 18, 1214, had still  three years to run. The expedition of Louis to England might well seem  to have broken it, but the prudent disavowal by Philip II. of his son's  sacrilegious enterprise made it a point of policy for the French King  to regard it as still in force, and neither John nor the earl marshal  had a mind to face the enmity of the father as well as the invasion of  the son. Accordingly the truce ran out its full time, and in 1220  Honorius III., ever zealous for peace between Christian sovereigns,  procured its prolongation for four years. Before this had expired, the  accession of Louis VIII. in 1223 raised the old enemy of King Henry to  the throne of France. Louis still coveted the English throne, and  desired to complete the conquest of Henry's French dominions in France.  His accession soon involved England in a new struggle, luckily delayed  until the worst of the disorders at home had been overcome.    Peace was impossible because Louis, like Philip, regarded the  forfeiture of John as absolute, and as involving the right to deny to  Henry III. a legitimate title to any of his lands beyond sea. Henry, on  the other hand, was still styled Duke of Normandy, Count of Anjou,  Count of Poitou, and Duke of Aquitaine. Claiming all that his father  had held, he refused homage to Philip or Louis for such French lands as  he actually possessed. For the first time since the Conquest, an  English king ruled over extensive French territories without any feudal  subjection to the King of France. However, Henry's French lands, though  still considerable, were but a shadow of those once ruled by his  father. Philip had conquered all Normandy, save the Channel Islands,  and also the whole of Anjou and Touraine. For a time he also gained  possession of Poitou, but before his death nearly the whole of that  region had slipped from his grasp. Poitiers, alone of its great towns,  remained in French hands. For the rest, both the barons and cities of  Poitou acknowledged the over-lordship of their English count. Too much  importance must not be ascribed to this revival of the English power.  Henry claimed very little domain in Poitou, which practically was  divided between the feudal nobles and the great communes. So long as  they maintained a virtual freedom, they were indifferent as to their  overlord. If they easily transferred their allegiance from Philip to  Henry, it was because the weakness of absentee counts was less to be  dreaded than the strength of a monarch near at hand. Meanwhile the  barons carried on their feuds one against the other, and all alike  joined in oppressing the townsmen.    During Henry's minority the crown was not strong enough to deal with  the unruly Foitevins. Seneschals quickly succeeded each other; the  barons expected the office to be filled by one of their own order, and  the towns, jealous of hostile neighbours, demanded the appointment of  an Englishman. At last, in 1221, Savary de Mauleon, one of King John's  mercenaries, a poet, and a crusader against infidels and Albigenses,  was made seneschal. His English estates ensured some measure of  fidelity, and his energy and experience were guarantees of his  competence, though, as a younger member of the great house of Thouars,  he belonged by birth to the inner circle of the Poitevin nobility,  whose treachery, levity, and self-seeking were proverbial. The powerful  Viscounts of Thouars were constantly kept in check by their traditional  enemies the Counts of La Marche, whose representative, Hugh of  Lusignan, was by far the strongest of the local barons. His cousin, and  sometime betrothed, Isabella, Countess of Angouleme, the widow of King  John, had left England to resume the administration of her dominions.  Early in 1220 she married Hugh, justifying herself to her son on the  ground that it would be dangerous to his interests if the Count of La  Marche should contract an alliance with the French party. But this was  mere excuse. The union of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16702"],[0,"The New York Times Current History of the European War, Vol. 1, January 9, 1915 (#11)"],[1," we  are all equally interested in discovering the truth. In the final  settlement of peace American public opinion may, nay, will, have a  prominent voice. If it is exerted on the strength of a true  understanding of European events, it will contribute to the  establishment of a lasting peace.    As to the evidence submitted Mr. Beck seems to err in believing that  Governments are accustomed to publish in their various white, gray, or  orange papers \"the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.\"  This is nowhere done, for there are many bits of information which come  to a Government through its diplomatic connections which it would be  indelicate, discourteous, or unwise to give to the public. The official  documents on American foreign relations and all white, gray, or orange  papers are \"edited.\" They are understood to be so by Congress,  Parliament, the Reichstag, the Duma, &c., and no charge of dishonesty  can be maintained against the respective Governments on that score.    If the Chancellor says that Germany was using her good offices in  Vienna, this is as valuable a bit of evidence as the reprint of a  dispatch in the \"White Paper,\" unless we wish to impugn his veracity,  and in that case the copy of a dispatch would be valueless, for he might  have forged it. The entire argument, therefore, against Germany and  Austria, based on what Mr. Beck calls the \"suppression of vitally  important documents,\" is void, unless you will apply it equally to Great  Britain and the other countries.    In Sir Edward Grey's \"White Paper\" Mr. Beck has missed no important  documents because he looked at England's well-prepared case through  sympathetic eyes, and it did not occur to him to ask, \"Where are all the  documents bearing on Italian neutrality?\" Does he believe that England  was so little interested in the question whether she would have to fight  two or three foes, and whether her way to Egypt and India would be safe  or threatened? There are many dispatches to and from Rome included in  the \"White Paper,\" but not a mention of Italy's position.    The first paper contains a letter to the British Ambassador in Berlin  concerning the Austro-Servian relations. Is it not probable that Sir  Edward Grey's attention was called to this question by his Ambassador in  Vienna? Where is his letter? Or, if Sir Edward thought of it himself,  why did he not mention his conversation also to Sir M. de Bunsen in  Vienna? Where is this note? Are we to assume that Sir M. de Bunsen made  his first report on July 23, although Sir Edward Goschen in Berlin had  an interesting report to make a day earlier?    We can thus go through the whole British \"White Paper\" and discover the  omission of many interesting documents.    No. 38 is a letter from Sir Rennell Rodd in Rome, dated on July 23 and  received on July 27. He had no doubt sent also a telegram. What did it  contain, and why was it not published under the date of its arrival  instead of the letter which had been delayed in transit?      Where Is No. 28?    In No. 29 Sir Edward Grey refers in a telegram to Sir R. Rodd to what \"I  had said to the German Ambassador.\" Such a reference could have a  meaning for Sir R. Rodd only if he had been informed of this  conversation. There is no dispatch printed in the \"White Paper\"  containing this information. Possibly it was so entwined with other  instructions, which Sir Edward Grey did not care to have known, that it  could not be published. Was it perhaps sent to the printer first as No.  28, and removed at the last moment when it was too late to change the  subsequent numbers? Or, if this assumption is wrong, what was printed  originally as No. 28? Where is No. 28? There are other omissions, and  one especially noteworthy one between Nos. 80 and 106 which will be  discussed later.    Viewed in this light, the English \"White Paper\" loses much of the value  of a complete record, which it has had in the eyes of many. There is  absolutely no reason to doubt the accuracy of those dispatches which  have been printed, but it becomes incumbent upon the searcher after the  truth to inquire whether the existence of unprinted (in the case of the  German \"White Paper\" Mr. Beck uses the term \"suppressed\") papers may not  at times alter the interpretation which should be given to those that  are printed.    Since we have no published records anywhere concerning the advice given  to Italy by the Allies, and the gradual steps leading up to Italy's  decision to remain neutral; nor any hint as to the day when her decision  was communicated to England and the other powers, it would be futile to  speculate on this subject. Since, however, the Queen of Italy and the  wife of the Commander in Chief of the Russian forces are sisters, and  since it was in the interest of the Allies to keep Italy neutral, it is  not unreasonable to assume that an exchange of opinion took place  between Italy and the Allies concerning the conditions under which Italy  would remain neutral.    If the actual opening of hostilities could be so managed that Germany  could be called the aggressor, then Italy probably declared that she  would not enter the war. This is a very important phase of the case, and  the omission from Sir Edward Grey's \"White Paper\" of all dispatches  dealing with Italian neutrality is much to be regretted.    Since we are dealing with the Italian dispatches here, it may be  advisable to consider at once all the communications which are published  as having passed between Sir Edward Grey and the British Ambassador, Sir  Rennell Rodd, in Rome. They are numbered 19, (perhaps 28,) 29, 35, 36,  38, 49, 57, 63, 64, 80, 81, 86, 92, 100, and 106, of which the important  numbers are 38, 57, 64, 80, and 86.    On July 23 Sir Edward Grey was informed that \"the gravity of the  situation lay in the conviction of the Austro-Hungarian Government that  it was absolutely necessary for their prestige, after the many  disillusions which the turn of events in the Balkans has occasioned, to  score a definite success.\" (No. 38.)    Austria, in other words, believed that to let the murder of her  heir-apparent pass unpunished would have meant a deathblow to her  prestige, and consequently, as any one familiar with her conditions will  agree, to her existence. Russia, on the other hand, on July 25 said (see  No. 17, report from Sir G. Buchanan) that she could not \"allow (note the  word) Austria to crush Servia and become the predominant power in the  Balkans, and if she feels secure of the support of France, she will face  all the risks of war.\"    These two dispatches to Sir Edward Grey tell the whole story in a  nutshell. Austria believed, rightly or wrongly, that it was a question  of life or death for her, while Russia claimed the right of preventing  Austria from becoming the predominate power in the Balkans, and actually  threatened war. Russia did not claim to be concerned with the justice of  Austria's demands on Servia.    No such definite word of Russia's intention was sent to Germany, for on  July 26 Sir M. de Bunsen reported Germany's confident belief that  \"Russia will keep quiet during the chastisement of Servia.\" (No. 32.)    On the next day Sir Rennell Rodd reports from Rome (No. 57) that the  Minister of Foreign Affairs believes that \"if Servia will even now  accept it (the Austrian note) Austria will be satisfied\" and refrain  from a punitive war. He, moreover, believes--and this is very  important--that Servia may be induced to accept the note in its entirety  on the advice of the four powers invited to the conference, and this  would enable her to say that she had yielded to Europe and not to  Austria-Hungary alone. Since Italy was to be one of the four powers, the  Minister's belief was doubtless based on accurate information. There is  then as late as July 27 no claim made by Servia that Austria's demands  are unreasonable. She only hates to yield to Austria alone. Austria, in  the meanwhile, (No. 57,) repeats her assurance that she demands no  territorial sacrifices from Servia.    On the next day, July 28, Sir Rennell Rodd reports (No. 64) that \"Servia  might still accept the whole Austrian note, if some explanation were  given regarding mode in which Austrian agents would require to  intervene.\" Austria, on her part, had explained that \"the co-operation  of the Austrian agents in Servia was to be only in investigation, not in  judicial or administrative measures. Servia was said to have willfully  misinterpreted this.\" (No. 64.)    From these reports it appears that the differences between Austria and  Servia were on the way to a solution. Austria claimed that her demands  were just, and Servia did not deny this. Austria further claimed that  her prestige, her very existence, demanded the prompt compliance with  her requests by Servia. She explained in a satisfactory way the one  point on which Servia had taken exceptions, and Servia was on the point  of complying, and would have complied, if the powers had been willing to  let her do so. Such a conclusion of the incident would have strengthened  Austria's prestige and assured the punishment of the murderers of  Serajevo.      Russia's Remark About Austria.    The reason why Servia was not allowed to submit was Russia's remark,  quoted above, that she would not \"allow\" Austria to become the  predominant power in the Balkans. It was, therefore, Russia's task to  prevent Servia from accepting Austria's note. Since war was her  alternative, baldly stated to England from the first, she had to do  three things--first, to secure as many allies as possible; secondly, to  weaken her enemies, preferably by detaching from them Italy, and,  thirdly, to get as much of a start in her mobilization as possible.    The treaties between Russia, France, and Great Britain, unlike those  between Germany, Austria, and Italy, have never been published. Whatever  their wording may be, Russia was at first apparently"]]]
