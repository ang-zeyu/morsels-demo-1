A perfectly  beautiful lady with yellow hair and a long black silk trailing gown  came to meet us with a welcoming smile.  I thought we were paying a  social call, and started to shake hands, but it seems we were only  buying hats--at least Julia was.  She sat down in front of a mirror and  tried on a dozen, each lovelier than the last, and bought the two  loveliest of all.    I can't imagine any joy in life greater than sitting down in front of a  mirror and buying any hat you choose without having first to consider  the price!  There's no doubt about it, Daddy; New York would rapidly  undermine this fine stoical character which the John Grier Home so  patiently built up.    And after we'd finished our shopping, we met Master Jervie at Sherry's.  I suppose you've been in Sherry's? Picture that, then picture the  dining-room of the John Grier Home with its oilcloth-covered tables,  and white crockery that you CAN'T break, and wooden-handled knives and  forks; and fancy the way I felt!    I ate my fish with the wrong fork, but the waiter very kindly gave me  another so that nobody noticed.    And after luncheon we went to the theatre--it was dazzling, marvellous,  unbelievable--I dream about it every night.    Isn't Shakespeare wonderful?    Hamlet is so much better on the stage than when we analyze it in class;  I appreciated it before, but now, dear me!    I think, if you don't mind, that I'd rather be an actress than a  writer.  Wouldn't you like me to leave college and go into a dramatic  school?  And then I'll send you a box for all my performances, and  smile at you across the footlights.  Only wear a red rose in your  buttonhole, please, so I'll surely smile at the right man.  It would be  an awfully embarrassing mistake if I picked out the wrong one.    We came back Saturday night and had our dinner in the train, at little  tables with pink lamps and negro waiters.  I never heard of meals being  served in trains before, and I inadvertently said so.    'Where on earth were you brought up?' said Julia to me.    'In a village,' said I meekly, to Julia.    'But didn't you ever travel?' said she to me.    'Not till I came to college, and then it was only a hundred and sixty  miles and we didn't eat,' said I to her.    She's getting quite interested in me, because I say such funny things.  I try hard not to, but they do pop out when I'm surprised--and I'm  surprised most of the time.  It's a dizzying experience, Daddy, to pass  eighteen years in the John Grier Home, and then suddenly to be plunged  into the WORLD.    But I'm getting acclimated.  I don't make such awful mistakes as I did;  and I don't feel uncomfortable any more with the other girls.  I used  to squirm whenever people looked at me.  I felt as though they saw  right through my sham new clothes to the checked ginghams underneath.  But I'm not letting the ginghams bother me any more.  Sufficient unto  yesterday is the evil thereof.    I forgot to tell you about our flowers.  Master Jervie gave us each a  big bunch of violets and lilies-of-the-valley. Wasn't that sweet of  him?  I never used to care much for men--judging by Trustees--but I'm  changing my mind.    Eleven pages--this is a letter!  Have courage.  I'm going to stop.                               Yours always,                                             Judy                                                             10th April    Dear Mr. Rich-Man,    Here's your cheque for fifty dollars.  Thank you very much, but I do  not feel that I can keep it.  My allowance is sufficient to afford all  of the hats that I need.  I am sorry that I wrote all that silly stuff  about the millinery shop; it's just that I had never seen anything like  it before.    However, I wasn't begging!  And I would rather not accept any more  charity than I have to.                       Sincerely yours,                                       Jerusha Abbott                                                     11th April    Dearest Daddy,    Will you please forgive me for the letter I wrote you yesterday?  After  I posted it I was sorry, and tried to get it back, but that beastly  mail clerk wouldn't give it back to me.    It's the middle of the night now; I've been awake for hours thinking  what a Worm I am--what a Thousand-legged Worm--and that's the worst I  can say!  I've closed the door very softly into the study so as not to  wake Julia and Sallie, and am sitting up in bed writing to you on paper  torn out of my history note-book.    I just wanted to tell you that I am sorry I was so impolite about your  cheque.  I know you meant it kindly, and I think you're an old dear to  take so much trouble for such a silly thing as a hat.  I ought to have  returned it very much more graciously.    But in any case, I had to return it.  It's different with me than with  other girls.  They can take things naturally from people.  They have  fathers and brothers and aunts and uncles; but I can't be on any such  relations with any one.  I like to pretend that you belong to me, just  to play with the idea, but of course I know you don't. I'm alone,  really--with my back to the wall fighting the world--and I get sort of  gaspy when I think about it.  I put it out of my mind, and keep on  pretending; but don't you see, Daddy?  I can't accept any more money  than I have to, because some day I shall be wanting to pay it back, and  even as great an author as I intend to be won't be able to face a  PERFECTLY TREMENDOUS debt.    I'd love pretty hats and things, but I mustn't mortgage the future to  pay for them.    You'll forgive me, won't you, for being so rude?  I have an awful habit  of writing impulsively when I first think things, and then posting the  letter beyond recall.  But if I sometimes seem thoughtless and  ungrateful, I never mean it.  In my heart I thank you always for the  life and freedom and independence that you have given me.  My childhood  was just a long, sullen stretch of revolt, and now I am so happy every  moment of the day that I can't believe it's true.  I feel like a  made-up heroine in a story-book.    It's a quarter past two.  I'm going to tiptoe out to post this off now.  You'll receive it in the next mail after the other; so you won't have a  very long time to think bad of me.                           Good night, Daddy,                             I love you always,                                                 Judy                                                             4th May    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    Field Day last Saturday.  It was a very spectacular occasion.  First we  had a parade of all the classes, with everybody dressed in white linen,  the Seniors carrying blue and gold Japanese umbrellas, and the juniors  white and yellow banners.  Our class had crimson balloons--very  fetching, especially as they were always getting loose and floating  off--and the Freshmen wore green tissue-paper hats with long streamers.  Also we had a band in blue uniforms hired from town.  Also about a  dozen funny people, like clowns in a circus, to keep the spectators  entertained between events.    Julia was dressed as a fat country man with a linen duster and whiskers  and baggy umbrella.  Patsy Moriarty (Patrici really.  Did you ever hear  such a name?  Mrs. Lippett couldn't have done better) who is tall and  thin was Julia's wife in a absurd green bonnet over one ear.  Waves of  laughter followed them the whole length of the course.  Julia played  the part extremely well.  I never dreamed that a Pendleton could  display so much comedy spirit--begging Master Jervie's pardon; I don't  consider him a true Pendleton though, any more than I consider you a  true Trustee.    Sallie and I weren't in the parade because we were entered for the  events.  And what do you think?  We both won!  At least in something.  We tried for the running broad jump and lost; but Sallie won the  pole-vaulting (seven feet three inches) and I won the fifty-yard sprint  (eight seconds).    I was pretty panting at the end, but it was great fun, with the whole  class waving balloons and cheering and yelling:                   What's the matter with Judy Abbott?                 She's all right.                 Who's all right?                 Judy Ab-bott!      That, Daddy, is true fame.  Then trotting back to the dressing tent and  being rubbed down with alcohol and having a lemon to suck.  You see  we're very professional.  It's a fine thing to win an event for your  class, because the class that wins the most gets the athletic cup for  the year.  The Seniors won it this year, with seven events to their  credit.  The athletic association gave a dinner in the gymnasium to all  of the winners.  We had fried soft-shell crabs, and chocolate ice-cream  moulded in the shape of basket balls.    I sat up half of last night reading Jane Eyre.  Are you old enough,  Daddy, to remember sixty years ago?  And, if so, did people talk that  way?    The haughty Lady Blanche says to the footman, 'Stop your chattering,  knave, and do my bidding.'  Mr. Rochester talks about the metal welkin  when he means the sky; and as for the mad woman who laughs like a hyena  and sets fire to bed curtains and tears up wedding veils and  BITES--it's melodrama of the purest, but just the same, you read and  read and read.  I can't see how any girl could have written such a  book, especially any girl who was brought up in a churchyard.  There's  something about those Brontes that fascinates me.  Their books, their  lives, their spirit.  Where did they get it?  When I was reading about  little Jane's troubles in the charity school, I got so angry that I had  to go out and take a walk.  I understood exactly how she felt.  Having  known Mrs. Lippett, I could see Mr. Brocklehurst.    Don't be outraged, Daddy.  I am not intimating that the John Grier Home  was like the Lowood Institute.  We had plenty to eat"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15707"],[0,"Zoonomia; Or, the Laws of Organic Life, Vol. I (#11)"],[1,"time the solidity of bodies is perceived by a single application of a solid  body to the nerves of touch, and that even through the cuticle; and we are  probably possessed of a peculiar sense to distinguish the nice degrees of  heat and cold.    The senses of touch and of hearing acquaint us with the mechanical impact  and vibration of bodies, those of smell and taste seem to acquaint us with  some of their chemical properties, while the sense of vision and of heat  acquaint us with the existence of their peculiar fluids.    _Sensation and Volition._    II. Many motions are produced by pleasure or pain, and that even in  contradiction to the power of volition, as in laughing, or in the  strangury; but as no name has been given to pleasure or pain, at the time  it is exerted so as to cause fibrous motions, we have used the term  sensation for this purpose; and mean it to bear the same analogy to  pleasure and pain, that the word volition does to desire and aversion.    1. It was mentioned in the fifth Section, that, what we have termed  sensation is a motion of the central parts, or of the whole sensorium,  _beginning_ at some of the extremities of it. This appears first, because  our pains and pleasures are always caused by our ideas or muscular motions,  which are the motions of the extremities of the sensorium. And, secondly,  because the sensation of pleasure or pain frequently continues some time  after the ideas or muscular motions which excited it have ceased: for we  often feel a glow of pleasure from an agreeable reverie, for many minutes  after the ideas, that were the subject of it, have escaped our memory; and  frequently experience a dejection of spirits without being able to assign  the cause of it but by much recollection.    When the sensorial faculty of desire or aversion is exerted so as to cause  fibrous motions, it is termed volition; which is said in Sect. V. to be a  motion of the central parts, or of the whole sensorium, _terminating_ in  some of the extremities of it. This appears, first, because our desires and  aversions always terminate in recollecting and comparing our ideas, or in  exerting our muscles; which are the motions of the extremities of the  sensorium. And, secondly, because desire or aversion begins, and frequently  continues for a time in the central parts of the sensorium, before it is  peculiarly exerted at the extremities of it; for we sometimes feel desire  or aversion without immediately knowing their objects, and in consequence  without immediately exerting any of our muscular or sensual motions to  attain them: as in the beginning of the passion of love, and perhaps of  hunger, or in the ennui of indolent people.    Though sensation and volition begin or terminate at the extremities or  central parts of the sensorium, yet the whole of it is frequently  influenced by the exertion of these faculties, as appears from their  effects on the external habit: for the whole skin is reddened by shame, and  an universal trembling is produced by fear: and every muscle of the body is  agitated in angry people by the desire of revenge.    There is another very curious circumstance, which shews that sensation and  volition are movements of the sensorium in contrary directions; that is,  that volition begins at the central parts of it, and proceeds to the  extremities; and that sensation begins at the extremities, and proceeds to  the central parts: I mean that these two sensorial faculties cannot be  strongly exerted at the same time; for when we exert our volition strongly,  we do not attend to pleasure or pain; and conversely, when we are strongly  affected with the sensation of pleasure or pain, we use no volition. As  will be further explained in Section XVIII. on sleep, and Section XXXIV. on  volition.    2. All our emotions and passions seem to arise out of the exertions of  these two faculties of the animal sensorium. Pride, hope, joy, are the  names of particular pleasures: shame, despair, sorrow, are the names of  peculiar pains: and love, ambition, avarice, of particular desires: hatred,  disgust, fear, anxiety, of particular aversions. Whilst the passion of  anger includes the pain from a recent injury, and the aversion to the  adversary that occasioned it. And compassion is the pain we experience at  the sight of misery, and the desire of relieving it.    There is another tribe of desires, which are commonly termed appetites, and  are the immediate consequences of the absence of some irritative motions.  Those, which arise from defect of internal irritations, have proper names  conferred upon them, as hunger, thirst, lust, and the desire of air, when  our respiration is impaired by noxious vapours; and of warmth, when we are  exposed to too great a degree of cold. But those, whose stimuli are  external to the body, are named from the objects, which are by nature  constituted to excite them; these desires originate from our past  experience of the pleasurable sensations they occasion, as the smell of an  hyacinth, or the taste of a pine-apple.    Whence it appears, that our pleasures and pains are at least as various and  as numerous as our irritations; and that our desires and aversions must be  as numerous as our pleasures and pains. And that as sensation is here used  as a general term for our numerous pleasures and pains, when they produce  the contractions of our fibres; so volition is the general name for our  desires and aversions, when they produce fibrous contractions. Thus when a  motion of the central parts, or of the whole sensorium, terminates in the  exertion of our muscles, it is generally called voluntary action; when it  terminates in the exertion of our ideas, it is termed recollection,  reasoning, determining.    3. As the sensations of pleasure and pain are originally introduced by the  irritations of external objects: so our desires and aversions are  originally introduced by those sensations; for when the objects of our  pleasures or pains are at a distance, and we cannot instantaneously possess  the one, or avoid the other, then desire or aversion is produced, and a  voluntary exertion of our ideas or muscles succeeds.    The pain of hunger excites you to look out for food, the tree, that shades  you, presents its odoriferous fruit before your eyes, you approach, pluck,  and eat.    The various movements of walking to the tree, gathering the fruit, and  masticating it, are associated motions introduced by their connection with  sensation; but if from the uncommon height of the tree, the fruit be  inaccessible, and you are prevented from quickly possessing the intended  pleasure, desire is produced. The consequence of this desire is, first, a  deliberation about the means to gain the object of pleasure in process of  time, as it cannot be procured immediately; and, secondly, the muscular  action necessary for this purpose.    You voluntarily call up all your ideas of causation, that are related to  the effect you desire, and voluntarily examine and compare them, and at  length determine whether to ascend the tree, or to gather stones from the  neighbouring brook, is easier to practise, or more promising of success;  and, finally, you gather the stones, and repeatedly fling them to dislodge  the fruit.    Hence then we gain a criterion to distinguish voluntary acts or thoughts  from those caused by sensation. As the former are always employed about the  _means_ to acquire pleasurable objects, or the _means_ to avoid painful  ones; while the latter are employed in the possession of those, which are  already in our power.    Hence the activity of this power of volition produces the great difference  between the human and the brute creation. The ideas and the actions of  brutes are almost perpetually employed about their present pleasures, or  their present pains; and, except in the few instances which are mentioned  in Section XVI, on instinct, they seldom busy themselves about the means of  procuring future bliss, or of avoiding future misery; so that the acquiring  of languages, the making of tools, and labouring for money, which are all  only the means to procure pleasures; and the praying to the Deity, as  another means to procure happiness, are characteristic of human nature.    4. As there are many diseases produced by the quantity of the sensation of  pain or pleasure being too great or too little; so are there diseases  produced by the susceptibility of the constitution to motions causable by  these sensations being too dull or too vivid. This susceptibility of the  system to sensitive motions is termed sensibility, to distinguish it from  sensation, which is the actual existence or exertion of pain or pleasure.    Other classes of diseases are owing to the excessive promptitude, or  sluggishness of the constitution to voluntary exertions, as well as to the  quantity of desire or of aversion. This susceptibility of the system to  voluntary motions is termed voluntarity, to distinguish it from volition,  which is the exertion of desire or aversion; these diseases will be treated  of at length in the progress of the work.    _Association._    III. 1. It is not easy to assign a cause, why those animal movements, that  have once occurred in succession, or in combination, should afterwards have  a tendency to succeed or accompany each other. It is a property of  animation, and distinguishes this order of being from the other productions  of nature.    When a child first wrote the word man, it was distinguished in his mind  into three letters, and those letters into many parts of letters; but by  repeated use the word man becomes to his hand in writing it, as to his  organs of speech in pronouncing it, but one movement without any  deliberation, or sensation, or irritation, interposed between the parts of  it. And as many separate motions of our muscles thus become united, and  form, as it were, one motion; so each separate motion before"]]]
