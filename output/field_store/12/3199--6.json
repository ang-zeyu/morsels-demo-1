It is not shameful not  to be as virtuous as he, and it seems excusable to be no more vicious.  We do not believe ourselves to be exactly sharing in the vices of the  vulgar, when we see that we are sharing in those of great men; and yet  we do not observe that in these matters they are ordinary men. We hold  on to them by the same end by which they hold on to the rabble; for,  however exalted they are, they are still united at some point to the  lowest of men. They are not suspended in the air, quite removed from our  society. No, no; if they are greater than we, it is because their heads  are higher; but their feet are as low as ours. They are all on the same  level, and rest on the same earth; and by that extremity they are as low  as we are, as the meanest folk, as infants, and as the beasts.      104    When our passion leads us to do something, we forget our duty; for  example, we like a book and read it, when we ought to be doing something  else. Now, to remind ourselves of our duty, we must set ourselves a task  we dislike; we then plead that we have something else to do, and by this  means remember our duty.      105    How difficult it is to submit anything to the judgment of another,  without prejudicing his judgment by the manner in which we submit it!  If we say, \"I think it beautiful,\" \"I think it obscure,\" or the like, we  either entice the imagination into that view, or irritate it to the  contrary. It is better to say nothing; and then the other judges  according to what really is, that is to say, according as it then is,  and according as the other circumstances, not of our making, have placed  it. But we at least shall have added nothing, unless it be that silence  also produces an effect, according to the turn and the interpretation  which the other will be disposed to give it, or as he will guess it from  gestures or countenance, or from the tone of the voice, if he is a  physiognomist. So difficult is it not to upset a judgment from its  natural place, or, rather, so rarely is it firm and stable!      106    By knowing each man's ruling passion, we are sure of pleasing him; and  yet each has his fancies, opposed to his true good, in the very idea  which he has of the good. It is a singularly puzzling fact.      107    _Lustravit lampade terras._[63]--The weather and my mood have little  connection. I have my foggy and my fine days within me; my prosperity or  misfortune has little to do with the matter. I sometimes struggle  against luck, the glory of mastering it makes me master it gaily;  whereas I am sometimes surfeited in the midst of good fortune.      108    Although people may have no interest in what they are saying, we must  not absolutely conclude from this that they are not lying; for there are  some people who lie for the mere sake of lying.      109    When we are well we wonder what we would do if we were ill, but when we  are ill we take medicine cheerfully; the illness persuades us to do so.  We have no longer the passions and desires for amusements and promenades  which health gave to us, but which are incompatible with the necessities  of illness. Nature gives us, then, passions and desires suitable to our  present state.[64] We are only troubled by the fears which we, and not  nature, give ourselves, for they add to the state in which we are the  passions of the state in which we are not.    As nature makes us always unhappy in every state, our desires picture to  us a happy state; because they add to the state in which we are the  pleasures of the state in which we are not. And if we attained to these  pleasures, we should not be happy after all; because we should have  other desires natural to this new state.    We must particularise this general proposition....      110    The consciousness of the falsity of present pleasures, and the ignorance  of the vanity of absent pleasures, cause inconstancy.      111    _Inconstancy._--We think we are playing on ordinary organs when playing  upon man. Men are organs, it is true, but, odd, changeable, variable  [with pipes not arranged in proper order. Those who only know how to  play on ordinary organs] will not produce harmonies on these. We must  know where [_the keys_] are.      112    _Inconstancy._--Things have different qualities, and the soul different  inclinations; for nothing is simple which is presented to the soul, and  the soul never presents itself simply to any object. Hence it comes that  we weep and laugh at the same thing.      113    _Inconstancy and oddity._--To live only by work, and to rule over the  most powerful State in the world, are very opposite things. They are  united in the person of the great Sultan of the Turks.      114    Variety is as abundant as all tones of the voice, all ways of walking,  coughing, blowing the nose, sneezing. We distinguish vines by their  fruit, and call them the Condrien, the Desargues, and such and such a  stock. Is this all? Has a vine ever produced two bunches exactly the  same, and has a bunch two grapes alike? etc.    I can never judge of the same thing exactly in the same way. I cannot  judge of my work, while doing it. I must do as the artists, stand at a  distance, but not too far. How far, then? Guess.      115    _Variety._--Theology is a science, but at the same time how many  sciences? A man is a whole; but if we dissect him, will he be the head,  the heart, the stomach, the veins, each vein, each portion of a vein,  the blood, each humour in the blood?    A town, a country-place, is from afar a town and a country-place. But,  as we draw near, there are houses, trees, tiles, leaves, grass, ants,  limbs of ants, in infinity. All this is contained under the name of  country-place.      116    _Thoughts._--All is one, all is different. How many natures exist in  man? How many vocations? And by what chance does each man ordinarily  choose what he has heard praised? A well-turned heel.      117    _The heel of a slipper._--\"Ah! How well this is turned! Here is a clever  workman! How brave is this soldier!\" This is the source of our  inclinations, and of the choice of conditions. \"How much this man  drinks! How little that one!\" This makes people sober or drunk,  soldiers, cowards, etc.      118    Chief talent, that which rules the rest.      119    Nature imitates herself. A seed sown in good ground brings forth fruit.  A principle, instilled into a good mind, brings forth fruit. Numbers  imitate space, which is of a different nature.    All is made and led by the same master, root, branches, and fruits;  principles and consequences.      120    [Nature diversifies and imitates; art imitates and diversifies.]      121    Nature always begins the same things again, the years, the days, the  hours; in like manner spaces and numbers follow each other from  beginning to end. Thus is made a kind of infinity and eternity. Not that  anything in all this is infinite and eternal, but these finite realities  are infinitely multiplied. Thus it seems to me to be only the number  which multiplies them that is infinite.      122    Time heals griefs and quarrels, for we change and are no longer the same  persons. Neither the offender nor the offended are any more themselves.  It is like a nation which we have provoked, but meet again after two  generations. They are still Frenchmen, but not the same.      123    He no longer loves the person whom he loved ten years ago. I quite  believe it. She is no longer the same, nor is he. He was young, and she  also; she is quite different. He would perhaps love her yet, if she were  what she was then.      124    We view things not only from different sides, but with different eyes;  we have no wish to find them alike.      125    _Contraries._--Man is naturally credulous and incredulous, timid and  rash.      126    Description of man: dependency, desire of independence, need.      127    Condition of man: inconstancy, weariness, unrest.      128    The weariness which is felt by us in leaving pursuits to which we are  attached. A man dwells at home with pleasure; but if he sees a woman who  charms him, or if he enjoys himself in play for five or six days, he is  miserable if he returns to his former way of living. Nothing is more  common than that.      129    Our nature consists in motion; complete rest is death.[65]      130    _Restlessness._--If a soldier, or labourer, complain of the hardship of  his lot, set him to do nothing.      131    _Weariness._[66]--Nothing is so insufferable to man as to be completely  at rest, without passions, without business, without diversion, without  study. He then feels his nothingness, his forlornness, his  insufficiency, his dependence, his weakness, his emptiness. There will  immediately arise from the depth of his heart weariness, gloom, sadness,  fretfulness, vexation, despair.      132    Methinks Caesar was too old to set about amusing himself with conquering  the world.[67] Such sport was good for Augustus or Alexander. They were  still young men, and thus difficult to restrain. But Caesar should have  been more mature.      133    Two faces which resemble each other, make us laugh, when together, by  their resemblance, though neither of them by itself makes us laugh.      134    How useless is painting, which attracts admiration by the resemblance of  things, the originals of which we do not admire!      135    The struggle alone pleases us, not the victory. We love to see animals  fighting, not the victor infuriated over the vanquished. We would only  see the victorious end; and, as soon as it comes, we are satiated. It is  the same in play, and the same in the search for truth. In disputes we  like to see the clash of opinions, but not at all to contemplate truth  when found. To observe it with pleasure, we have to see it emerge out of  strife. So in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18273"],[0,"The Wild Tribes of Davao District, Mindanao (#11)"],[1,"ields, to aid in the house-building or to  take his turn at the forge, neither will he tolerate any loafing on the  part of his followers. While in most instances he mingles freely with  his people he never eats with them. His wives, children, and guests eat  from a long row of dishes set on the floor, but the _datu_ takes his  food alone at a considerable distance from the others.    The balance of the people can be roughly divided between freeman and  slaves, but slavery here is of such a mild type, and the members of that  class become so quickly merged into the tribe that the lines cannot be  closely drawn. Women and children secured in raids become the slaves of  their captors, and may be bought and sold, or pass by inheritance, like  other property. It is considered proper for a man to live with his slave  without marrying her, but should she become pregnant she is usually  given her freedom at once; if not then, she is certain to be upon the  death of her master, while her offspring are free and legitimate heirs.  Children born to a slave couple remain in their class, as do those born  to a slave mother and a man not her master. These slaves are treated  with kindness and consideration and seldom try to make their escape. In  fact it is often difficult to pick out the members of this class from  the other members of the family.    The chief aim in life of the man is to have the right to wear the  blood-red clothing and to be known as _magani_. As stated earlier in the  paper, this term is applied to a man who has killed two or more persons.  He is then entitled to wear the peculiar chocolate-colored head covering  (Plate XXV). When his score has reached four he can don blood-red  trousers, and when he has six lives to his credit he is permitted to  wear the complete blood-red suit and to carry a bag of the same  color.[30] From that time on his clothing does not change with the  number of his victims, but his influence increases with each life put to  his credit. It is said that formerly, at Digos and Bansalan, a man who  had killed twenty or more was known as _gemawan_, and was distinguished  by a black hemp suit. This claim to the black clothing is no longer  respected, and such garments are worn by any who desire them. The man  who has never killed a person is called _matalo_, a rather slighting  term signifying one who has no desire to fight but remains at home with  the women. A man who kills an unfaithful wife and her admirer may count  the two on his score. He may also count those of his townspeople whom he  has killed in fair fight, but unprovoked murder will be punished by the  death of the offender. The candidate for _magani_ honors may go to an  unfriendly town, or to a neighboring tribe, and kill without fear of  censure from his own people.    [30] This is the rule at Cibolan. At Malilla and Digos, the kerchief may  be worn when one life has been taken, the trousers for two, the coat for  three, and finally the sack for four.    [Transcriber's note: _matalo_ in the paragraph above means \"coward.\"]    The _magani_ is one of the leaders in a war party; he is chosen to  inflict the death penalty when it is decreed, and it is men of this  class that assist in the human sacrifices. He is under the special  protection of Mandarangan and Darago, and all petitions to these  powerful spirits must be made through him. His clothing is considered  the property of these spirits, and when such specimens were secured for  the collection, the wearer would invariably place the garment beside  some prized article, such as a knife or spear, then taking a green betel  nut would rub the garment and object, meanwhile beseeching the spirits  to leave the one and enter the other. Later the nut was placed in the  _tambara_ belonging to those spirits. A father may not bequeath to his  son the right to the red clothing; and such articles, together with his  weapons, should be buried with him. Should one not entitled to these  garments dare to make use of them, the spirits would straightway cause  his body to swell or turn yellow, and he would die.    In a previous paragraph we mentioned the unorganized priesthood, the  members of which are known as _mabalian_. Men are not barred from this  profession, but the greater number of its members are old, or  middle-aged, women.[31] A woman may live the greater part of her life  without an idea of becoming a member of this order, and then suddenly be  warned in dreams, by visions, or by other _mabalian_ that she has been  chosen by the spirits. The one thus elected becomes a pupil of a  qualified _mabalian_ and for several months will be drilled in the  duties of that office. She will be taught the medicines to be used at  certain times,[32] the duties of a midwife, the correct method of  building shrines and conducting ceremonies, and finally, she will learn  the prayers with which the spirits should be addressed. It seems to be  the belief that, at times during the ceremonies, the _mabalian_ may be  possessed by a spirit and that she then speaks not as a mortal but as  the spirit itself. She also knows how to weave and dye the turban worn  by the _magani_, and because of this accomplishment is considered to be  under the protection of Baitpandi,[33] and is permitted to wear garments  made of red cloth, the same as the _magani_.    [31] There are five _mabalian_ in Cibolan, all of whom are women past  middle life.    [32] A medicine is used with the idea that it assists in driving away  evil influences.    [33] The patron spirit of the weavers.    The workers in the various crafts are under the guidance and protection  of special spirits, but there is no bar against other members of the  tribe entering those professions.    Apparently then, Bagobo society is divided into several classes or  divisions, but with the exception of a few individuals in the slave  class, there is a possibility or an opportunity for each member of the  tribe to enter any class open to his or her sex. Even a slave woman may  become the wife of a _datu_, and her son may assume the leadership of  the tribe.    LAWS. PROPERTY AND INHERITANCE.    The laws of the people are those imposed by custom and religion, and are  equally binding on all classes. Public opinion is sufficient to prevent  most crimes; the fear of offending the spirits is a further deterrent;  while the final bar is the drastic punishment meted out by the _datu_.  Theft is punished by the levying of a fine if the culprit is able to  pay, or by a term of servitude if he has no property. If a husband finds  that his wife has been unfaithful, he should kill both her and her  admirer, but the spear with which he avenges his wrongs should be left  in the body of one of the victims, as a sign that the murder was  provoked by the fault. When this is done the husband cannot be held  accountable either to the _datu_ or to the dead person's relatives. If,  however, he withdraws the weapon, the brothers or other male relatives  of the deceased have a right and a duty to avenge the deaths. A man who  has killed his wife and her lover is allowed to count both on his score  towards becoming a _magani_--a further incentive for him to avenge his  wrongs. Cases are known where the husband accepted payment for his  wife's affections, but it was considered a sign of weakness, or  cowardice, and the man lost caste. Unprovoked murder of one from the  same or a friendly village is punished by death.    A man having illicit relations with a slave woman, not his own, is  subjected to a heavy fine or a term of servitude. Incest should be  punished by the death of the culprits for should such a crime go  unpunished the spirits would cause the sea to rise and cover the land.  Datu Tongkaling claims that on two occasions, since he became ruler, he  has put such offenders to death. In the first case he had the couple  bound and thrown into the sea, while in the second instance, they were  tied to trees in the forest and sacrificed in the presence of all the  people of the village.    Prohibitions exist against the wearing of the clothing which  distinguishes warriors and priestesses, and there are rules governing  the conduct of individuals while near shrines or during ceremonies, but  punishment for the breaking of these rules is meted out by the spirits  rather than by the _datu_.    Each settlement is recognized as having property rights to all adjacent  lands. Within these recognized limits, its members may take up as much  land as they need, provided it is not already in use, but when a field  is, for any reason, abandoned it again becomes the property of the  community. Individual ownership extends to houses, furnishings, and all  articles of clothing, as well as to weapons, traps, animals, and slaves.  Although bought with a price the wife is still very independent and has  undisputed rights to her baskets, cooking utensils, looms, and to the  finery with which she adorns her person.    Since all the people assist in the support of the _datu_ they consider  his home to be, to a certain extent, their own and make use of it and  its furnishings without question.    Probably at no place in the world has borrowing gone to greater extremes  than here. When attempting to purchase clothing, or articles in daily  use, the writer frequently found that not a single garment worn by an  individual was his own; and it was usually necessary to consult several  persons in order to secure a complete outfit.    Upon the death of a man, his property is taken in charge by his first  wife, or by the old men, and is divided equally among his wives and  children, with perhaps a little extra added to the share of the first  mate. The belongings of a free-born woman go to her children, or, in  case she is barren, are given to her relatives. In cases where both the  parents are dead, the children pass into the care of the father's  family.    Despite the fact that property is"]]]
