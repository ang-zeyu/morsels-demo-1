If the valley of the Nerbudda should continue for sixty years  longer under such a government as it has enjoyed since we took  possession of it in 1817,[8] it may become infinitely more rich, more  populous, and more beautiful than that of the Nile ever was; and, if  the Hindoos there continue, as I hope they will, to acquire wealth  and honour under a rule to which they are so much attached, the  prophecy may be realized in as far as the increase of honour paid to  the Nerbudda is concerned. But I know no ground to expect that the  reverence[9] paid to the Ganges will diminish, unless education and  the concentration of capital in manufactures should work an important  change in the religious feelings and opinions of the people along the  course of that river; although this, it must be admitted, is a  consummation which may be looked for more speedily on the banks of  the Ganges than on those of a stream like the Nerbudda, which is  neither navigable at present nor, in my opinion, capable of being  rendered so. Commerce and manufactures, and the concentration of  capital in the maintenance of the new communities employed in them,  will, I think, be the great media through which this change will be  chiefly effected; and they are always more likely to follow the  course of rivers that are navigable than that of rivers which are  not.[10]      Notes:    1.

Concerning the prophecy that the sanctity of the Ganges will  cease in 1895, see note to Chapter 1, _ante_, [13]. The prophecy was  much talked of some years ago, but the reverence for the Ganges  continues undiminished, while the development of commerce and  manufactures has not affected, the religious feelings and opinions of  the people. Railways, in fact, facilitate pilgrimages and increase  their popularity. The course of commerce now follows the line of  rail, not the navigable rivers. The author, when writing this book,  evidently never contemplated the possibility of railway construction  in India. Later in life, in 1852, he fully appreciated the value of  the new means of communication (_Journey_, ii, 370, &c.).          CHAPTER 4      A Suttee[1] on the Nerbudda.    We took a ride one evening to Gopalpur, a small village situated on  the same bank of the Nerbudda, about three miles up from Bheraghat.  On our way we met a party of women and girls coming to the fair.  Their legs were uncovered half-way up the thigh; but, as we passed,  they all carefully covered up their faces. 'Good God!' exclaimed one  of the ladies, 'how can these people be so very indecent?' They  thought it, no doubt, equally extraordinary that she should have her  face uncovered, while she so carefully concealed her legs; for they  were really all modest peasantry, going from the village to bathe in  the holy stream.[2]    Here there are some very pretty temples, built for the most part to  the memory of widows who have burned themselves with the remains of  their husbands, and upon the very spot where they committed  themselves to the flames. There was one which had been recently  raised over the ashes of one of the most extraordinary old ladies  that I have ever seen, who burned herself in my presence in 1829. I  prohibited the building of any temple upon the spot, but my successor  in the civil charge of the district, Major Low, was never, I believe,  made acquainted with the prohibition nor with the progress of the  work; which therefore went on to completion in my absence. As suttees  are now prohibited in our dominions[3] and cannot be often seen or  described by Europeans, I shall here relate the circumstances of this  as they were recorded by me at the time, and the reader may rely upon  the truth of the whole tale.    On the 29th November, 1829, this old woman, then about sixty-five  years of age, here mixed her ashes with those of her husband, who had  been burned alone four days before. On receiving civil charge of the  district (Jubbulpore) in March, 1828, I issued a proclamation  prohibiting any one from aiding or assisting in suttee, and  distinctly stating that to bring one ounce of wood for the purpose  would be considered as so doing. If the woman burned herself with the  body of her husband, any one who brought wood for the purpose of  burning him would become liable to punishment; consequently, the body  of the husband must be first consumed, and the widow must bring a  fresh supply for herself. On Tuesday, 24th November, 1829, I had an  application from the heads of the most respectable and most extensive  family of Brahmans in the district to suffer this old woman to burn  herself with the remains of her husband, Ummed Singh Upadhya, who had  that morning died upon the banks of the Nerbudda.[4] I threatened to  enforce my order, and punish severely any man who assisted; and  placed a police guard for the purpose of seeing that no one did so.  She remained sitting by the edge of the water without eating or  drinking. The next day the body of her husband was burned to ashes in  a small pit of about eight feet square, and three or four feet deep,  before several thousand spectators who had assembled to see the  suttee. All strangers dispersed before evening, as there seemed to be  no prospect of my yielding to the urgent solicitations of her family,  who dared not touch food till she had burned herself, or declared  herself willing to return to them. Her sons, grandsons, and some  other relations remained with her, while the rest surrounded my  house, the one urging me to allow her to burn, and the other urging  her to desist. She remained sitting on a bare rock in the bed of the  Nerbudda, refusing every kind of sustenance, and exposed to the  intense heat of the sun by day, and the severe cold of the night,  with only a thin sheet thrown over her shoulders. On Thursday, to cut  off all hope of her being moved from her purpose, she put on the  dhaja, or coarse red turban, and broke her bracelets in pieces, by  which she became dead in law, and for ever excluded from caste.  Should she choose to live after this, she could never return to her  family. Her children and grandchildren were still with her, but all  their entreaties were unavailing; and I became satisfied that she  would starve herself to death, if not allowed to burn, by which the  family would be disgraced, her miseries prolonged, and I myself  rendered liable to be charged with a wanton abuse of authority, for  no prohibition of the kind I had issued had as yet received the  formal sanction of the Government.    On Saturday, the 28th, in the morning, I rode out ten miles to the  spot, and found the poor old widow sitting with the dhaja round her  head, a brass plate before her with undressed rice and flowers, and a  coco-nut in each hand. She talked very collectedly, telling me that  'she had determined to mix her ashes with those of her departed  husband, and should patiently wait my permission to do so, assured  that God would enable her to sustain life till that was given, though  she dared not eat or drink'. Looking at the sun, then rising before  her over a long and beautiful reach of the Nerbudda river, she said  calmly, 'My soul has been for five days with my husband's near that  sun, nothing but my earthly frame is left; and this, I know, you will  in time suffer to be mixed with the ashes of his in yonder pit,  because it is not in your nature or usage wantonly to prolong the  miseries of a poor old woman'.    'Indeed, it is not,--my object and duty is to save and preserve them  [_sic_]; and I am come to dissuade you from this idle purpose, to  urge you to live, and to keep your family from the disgrace of being  thought your murderers.'    'I am not afraid of their ever being so thought: they have all, like  good children, done everything in their power to induce me to live  among them; and, if I had done so, I know they would have loved and  honoured me; but my duties to them have now ended. I commit them all  to your care, and I go to attend my husband, _Ummed Singh Upadhya_,  with whose ashes on the funeral pile mine have been already three  times mixed.'[5]    This was the first time in her long life that she had "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15488"],[0,"Woman's Life in Colonial Days (#11)"],[1,"toward physical and mental ailments. The usual safety vents of  modern society, the common functions we may class as general \"good  times,\" were denied the soul, and it turned back to feed upon itself.  The following hint by Sewall, written a few years before the witchcraft  craze, is significant: \"Thorsday, Novr. 12. After the Ministers of this  Town Come to the Court and complain against a Dancing Master, who seeks  to set up here, and hath mixt Dances, and his time of Meeting is  Lecture-Day; and 'tis reported he should say that by one Play he could  teach more Divinity than Mr. Willard or the Old Testament. Mr. Moodey  said 'twas not a time for N.E. to dance. Mr. Mather struck at the Root,  speaking against mixt Dances.\"[22] And again in the records by another  colonist, Prince, we note: \"1631. March 22. First Court at Boston.  Ordered That all who have cards, dice, or 'tables' in their houses shall  make way with them before the next court.\"[23]    But the lack of social safety valves seemingly did not suggest itself to  the Puritan fathers; not the causes, but the religious effect of the  matter was what those stern churchmen sought to destroy. Says Cotton  Mather: \"So horrid and hellish is the Crime of Witchcraft, that were  Gods Thoughts as our thoughts, or Gods Wayes as our wayes, it could be  no other, but Unpardonable. But that Grace of God may be admired, and  that the worst of Sinners may be encouraged, Behold, Witchcraft also has  found a Pardon.... From the Hell of Witchcraft our merciful Jesus can  fetch a guilty Creature to the Glory of Heaven. Our Lord hath sometimes  Recovered those who have in the most horrid manner given themselves away  to the Destroyer of their souls.\"[24]    Where did this mania, this riot of superstition and fanaticism that  resulted in so much sorrow and so many deaths have its beginning and  origin? Coffin in his _Old Times in the Colonies_ has summed up the  matters briefly and vividly: \"The saddest story in the history of our  country is that of the witch craze at Salem, Mass. brought about by a  negro woman and a company of girls. The negress, Tituba, was a slave,  whom Rev. Samuel Parris, one of the ministers of Salem, had purchased in  Barbadoes. We may think of Tituba as seated in the old kitchen of Mr.  Parris's house during the long winter evenings, telling witchcraft  stories to the minister's niece, Elizabeth, nine years old. She draws a  circle in the ashes on the hearth, burns a lock of hair, and mutters  gibberish. They are incantations to call up the devil and his imps. The  girls of the village gather in the old kitchen to hear Tituba's stories,  and to mutter words that have no meaning. The girls are Abigail  Williams, who is eleven; Anne Putnam, twelve; Mary Walcot; and Mary  Lewis, seventeen; Elizabeth Hubbard, Elizabeth Booth, and Susannah  Sheldon, eighteen; and two servant girls, Mary Warren, and Sarah  Churchill. Tituba taught them to bark like dogs, mew like cats, grunt  like hogs, to creep through chairs and under tables on their hands and  feet, and pretend to have spasms.... Mr. Parris had read the books and  pamphlets published in England ... and he came to the conclusion that  they were bewitched. He sent for Doctor Griggs who said that the girls  were not sick, and without doubt were bewitched.... The town was on  fire. Who bewitches you? they were asked. Sarah Good, Sarah Osbum, and  Tituba, said the girls. Sarah Good was a poor, old woman, who begged her  bread from door to door. Sarah Osburn was old, wrinkled, and  sickly.\"[25]    The news of the peculiar actions of the girls spread throughout the  settlement; people flocked to see their antics. By this time the  children had carried the \"fun\" so far that they dared not confess, lest  the punishment be terrific, and, therefore, to escape the consequences,  they accused various old women of bewitching them. Undoubtedly the  little ones had no idea that the delusion would seize so firmly upon  the superstitious nature of the people; but the settlers, especially the  clergymen and the doctors, took the matter seriously and brought the  accused to trial. The craze spread; neighbor accused neighbor; enemies  apparently tried to pay old scores by the same method; and those who did  not confess were put to death. It is a fact worth noting that the large  majority of the witnesses and the greater number of the victims were  women. The men who conducted the trials and passed the verdict of  \"guilty\" cannot, of course, stand blameless; but it was the long pent-up  but now abnormally awakened imagination of the women that wrought havoc  through their testimony to incredible things and their descriptions of  unbelievable actions. No doubt many a personal grievance, petty  jealousy, ancient spite, and neighborhood quarrel entered into the  conflict; but the results were out of all proportion to such causes, and  remain to-day among the blackest and most sorrowful records on the pages  of American history.    As stated above, some of the testimony was incredible and would be  ridiculous if the outcome had not been so tragic. Let us read some bits  from the record of those solemn trials. Increase Mather in his  _Remarkable Providences_ related the following concerning the  persecution of William Morse and wife at Newberry, Massachusetts: \"On  December 8, in the Morning, there were five great Stones and Bricks by  an invisible hand thrown in at the west end of the house while the Mans  Wife was making the Bed, the Bedstead was lifted up from the floor, and  the Bedstaff flung out of the Window, and a Cat was hurled at her....  The man's Wife going to the Cellar ... the door shut down upon her, and  the Table came and lay upon the door, and the man was forced to remove  it e're his Wife could be released from where she was.\"[26a]    Again, see the remarkable vision beheld by Goodman Hortado and his wife  in 1683: \"The said Mary and her Husband going in a Cannoo over the River  they saw like the head of a man new-shorn, and the tail of a white Cat  about two or three foot distance from each other, swimming over before  the Cannoo, but no body appeared to joyn head and tail together.\"[26b]    Cotton Mather in his _Wonders of the Invisible World_ gives us some  insight into the mental and physical condition of many of the witnesses  called upon to testify to the works of Satan. Some of them undoubtedly  were far more in need of an expert on nervous diseases than of the  ministrations of either jurist or clergyman. \"It cost the Court a  wonderful deal of Trouble, to hear the Testimonies of the Sufferers; for  when they were going to give in their Depositions, they would for a long  time be taken with fitts, that made them uncapable of saying anything.  The Chief Judge asked the prisoner who he thought hindered these  witnesses from giving their testimonies? and he answered, He supposed it  was the Devil.\"    It must have been a reign of terror for the Puritan mother and wife.  What woman could tell whether she or her daughter might not be the next  victim of the bloody harvest? Note the ancient records again. Here are  the words of the colonist, Robert Calef, in his _More Wonders of the  Invisible World_: \"September 9. Six more were tried, and received  Sentence of Death; viz., Martha Cory af Salem Village, Mary Easty of  Topsfield, Alice Parker and Ann Pudeater of Salem, Dorcas Hoar of  Beverly, and Mary Bradberry of Salisbury. September 1st, Giles Gory was  prest to Death.\" And Sewall in his _Diary_ thus speaks of the same  barbarous execution just mentioned: \"Monday, Sept. 19, 1692. About noon,  at Salem, Giles Gory was press'd to death for standing Mute; much pains  was used with him two days, one after another, by the Court and Capt.  Gardner of Nantucket who had been of his acquaintance, but all in  vain.\"[27a]    Those were harsh times, and many a man or woman showed heroic qualities  under the strain. The editor of Sewall's _Diary_ makes this comment upon  the silent heroism of the martyr, Giles Cory: \"At first, apparently, a  firm believer in the witchcraft delusion, even to the extent of  mistrusting his saintly wife, who was executed three days after his  torturous death, his was the most tragic of all the fearful offerings.  He had made a will, while confined in Ipswich jail, conveying his  property, according to his own preferences, among his heirs; and, in the  belief that his will would be invalidated and his estate confiscated, if  he were condemned by a jury after pleading to the indictment, he  resolutely preserved silence, knowing that an acqittance was an  impossibility.\"[27b]    In the case of Cory doubtless the majority of the people thought the  manner of death, like that of Anne Hutchinson, was a fitting judgment of  God; for Sewall records in his ever-helpful Diary: \"Sept. 20. Now I  hear from Salem that about 18 years agoe, he [Giles Cory] was suspected  to have stamp'd and press'd a man to death, but was cleared. Twas not  remembered till Ann Putnam was told of it by said Cory's Spectre the  Sabbath day night before the Execution.\"[28]    The Corys, Eastys, and Putnams were families exceedingly prominent  during the entire course of the mania; Ann Putnam's name appears again  and again. She evidently was a woman of unusual force and impressive  personality, and many were her revelations concerning suspected persons  and even totally innocent neighbors. Such workers brought distressing  results, and how often the helpless victims were women! Hear these  echoes from the gloomy court rooms: \"September 17: Nine more received  Sentence of Death, viz., Margaret Scot of Rowly, Goodwife Reed of  Marblehead, Samuel Wardwell, and Mary Parker of Andover, also Abigail  Falkner of Andover ... Rebecka Eames of Boxford, Mary Lacy and Ann  Foster of Andover, and Abigail Hobbs of Topsfield. Of these Eight were  Executed.\"[29] And Cotton Mather in a letter to a friend: \"Our Good God  is"]]]
