THE TAR WOLF    I      Many hundreds of moons ago, there was a great drought. The streams and  lakes were drying up. Water was so scarce that the animals held a  council to decide what they should do.    \"I hope it will rain soon and fill the streams and lakes,\" Great Bear  said. \"If it does not, all the animals will have to go to a land where  there is more water.\"    \"I know where there is plenty of water,\" said Wild Goose.    \"I do, too,\" said Wild Duck.    Most of the animals did not wish to go away. \"It is well enough for the  ducks and geese to go,\" said Wild Cat; \"they like to move about. It is  well enough for Great Bear to go; he can sleep through the winter in one  hollow tree as soundly as in another. But we do not wish to leave our  hunting grounds.\"    \"If we go to a new country,\" said Gray Wolf, \"we shall have to make new  trails.\"    \"And we shall have to clear new land,\" said Big Beaver, who had to cut  down the trees when land was cleared.    All this time the Rabbit said nothing. \"Brother Rabbit,\" Great Bear  asked, \"what do you think about this matter?\"    Brother Rabbit did not answer. His eyes were shut, and he seemed too  sleepy to think about anything.    Great Bear asked again, \"What do you think about it, Brother Rabbit?  Shall we go to the place the ducks and geese have found, where there is  plenty of water?\"    \"Oh,\" answered Brother Rabbit, \"I do not mind the drought. I drink the  dew on the grass in the early morning; I do not need to go where there  is more water.\"    And he shut his eyes again.    \"Well,\" said Red Deer, \"if there is dew enough for Brother Rabbit every  morning, there is dew enough for us. We need not go to another country.\"    \"Those are wise words, my brother,\" said Brown Terrapin.    All the others said, \"Those are wise words, my brother,\" and the council  was over. The animals were happy because they thought they need not go  away from their homes.    Days passed, and still it did not rain. The animals found that the dew  did not keep them from suffering from thirst. They were afraid that,  after all, they would have to go to another country.    Still the Rabbit looked sleek and fat. He declared that he got all the  water he needed from the dew on the grass in the early morning.    \"You sleep too late,\" he said. \"By the time you get up, the sun has  dried the dew.\"      II      After that, the animals came out earlier than before, but they could not  get water enough from the morning dew. They did not understand why the  Rabbit looked so well.    One day Gray Wolf said to Wild Cat, \"Let us watch the Rabbit and see  where he gets so much dew that he is never thirsty.\"    That night they stayed in the woods near Rabbit's wigwam, so as to  follow him on the trail. They kept awake all night for fear that they  might sleep too late.    Very early in the morning, Brother Rabbit came out of his wigwam and ran  swiftly down the hill. Wild Cat and Gray Wolf followed as fast and as  quietly as they could.    The dew was on the grass and leaves, but Brother Rabbit did not stop to  get it. Instead, he ran down the hill and pushed away a heap of brush.  Wild Cat and Gray Wolf hid behind some bushes and watched him.    Brother Rabbit drank from a little spring. Then he filled a jar with  clear, fresh water, piled the brush over the spring again, and went up  the hill to his wigwam.    Ah! now Gray Wolf and Wild Cat knew why Brother Rabbit did not mind the  drought; and they made a plan to punish him for being so selfish.    They got tar and resin from the pine trees, and out of these they made a  great wolf. After placing it close to the spring, they hid again in the  bushes, to see what would happen.    Early the next morning, Brother Rabbit came running down the hill for  more water. He stopped when he saw the tar wolf by his spring.    \"What are you doing here, Gray Wolf?\" he asked. Of course there was no  answer.    \"Has my brother no ears?\" asked Brother Rabbit.    As the wolf was still silent, Brother Rabbit became angry. \"Answer me,  Gray Wolf,\" he cried. But there was no answer.    Then Brother Rabbit slapped the tar wolf with his right front paw. It  stuck fast, and Brother Rabbit could not pull it away.    [Illustration: Brother Rabbit and the wolf]    \"Let me go,\" he cried, \"or I will slap you with the other paw.\"    He slapped the tar wolf with the left front paw. That too, stuck fast.    Now Brother Rabbit was very angry. \"Let me go, Gray Wolf,\" he cried.  \"Let me go, I say!\"    As Grey Wolf did not let him go, Brother Rabbit kicked the tar wolf,  first with one of his hind paws and then with the other. Both stuck  fast, and so he was held by all four paws.    Just then Gray Wolf and Wild Cat came from their hiding place.    \"We have caught you, Brother Rabbit,\" they said. \"Now we are going to  take you to the council and tell how you tried to keep all the water for  yourself.\"      III      They took Brother Rabbit to the council house, and sent for Great Bear  and all the other animals. Soon all came, and the council began. Gray  Wolf told that he had seen Brother Rabbit go to the spring, uncover it,  get water, and cover the spring up again.    The animals said that Brother Rabbit must be punished, but how they  could not decide.    \"Burn him alive,\" said Gray Wolf.    \"I am quite willing,\" Brother Rabbit said, smiling. \"Fire is my friend  and will not hurt me.\"    \"We might cut off his head,\" said Brown Terrapin.    \"Very well,\" said the Rabbit, quietly. \"Try that. It will not hurt me,  for a better head will grow back.\"    He said he was not afraid of each thing that was mentioned.    \"Is there nothing of which you are afraid?\" asked Great Bear, at last.  \"Is there nothing that can hurt you?\"    \"Of only one thing am I afraid,\" answered Brother Rabbit, in a low  voice. \"I am afraid you will turn me loose in the brier patch. Please do  not throw me in the brier patch.\"    \"Turn him loose in the brier patch!\" cried all the animals.    How frightened Brother Rabbit looked now!    \"Oh, Gray Wolf,\" he begged, \"burn me; cut off my head. Do anything else  with me, but please don't throw me in the brier patch.\"    The more he begged, the faster Gray Wolf hurried to the brier patch. The  other animals followed close behind. They were all talking about the  tricks Brother Rabbit had played on them and how they had never before  been able to get even with him.    When they came to the edge of the brier patch, Brother Rabbit begged  harder than ever.    \"Good Wolf,\" he cried, \"do anything else with me, but don't throw me in  the brier patch!\"    Gray Wolf laughed and threw Brother Rabbit far into the patch.    Brother Rabbit landed on his feet, and off he ran through the briers. He  called back, \"Thank you, good Wolf! You threw me right on my trail! I  was born and bred in the brier patch. I was born and bred in the brier  patch!\"    He was running so fast that by the time he said this, he was out of  sight.    --THE INDIAN TAR-BABY STORY.          THE RABBIT AND THE WOLF      The rabbit liked to play tricks on the other animals. Best of all, he  liked to play tricks on the wolf. At last the wolf grew angry and said  that he was going to get even with the rabbit.    One day he caught the rabbit coming through a field.    \"Now,\" said the wolf, \"I am going to pay you for all the tricks you have  played on me. I will cut off your ears and use them for spoons to stir  my hominy pot. As soon as I sharpen this stone, off your ears go!\"    While the wolf sharpened the stone, he sang in his harsh voice a song  somewhat like this:      \"Watch me sharpen,    Watch me sharpen;    Soon I am going to cut off your ears.    Sicum, sicum, sicum, sicum,    Sicum, se mi su!\"    When he sang,      \"Sicum, sicum, sicum, sicum,    Sicum, se mi su!\"    the rabbit could almost feel the sharp stone cutting his ears. But he  was a brave little rabbit and said nothing.    At last the wolf stopped singing for a moment.    Then the rabbit said, \"Brother Wolf, I know a new dance. Don't you wish  me to teach it to you?\"    \"Yes, when I have cut off your ears,\" said the wolf.    Then he went on singing,      \"Sicum, sicum, sicum, sicum,    Sicum, se mi su!\"    \"After my ears are cut off,\" said the rabbit, \"I can never dance any  more.\"    Now the wolf knew that the rabbit could sing and dance better than any  other animal, and he wished very much to learn the new dance. He went on  sharpening the stone, but he did not sing while he worked.    After a while he asked, \"Is the new dance as pretty as the Snake Dance?\"    \"Oh, a great deal prettier,\" answered the rabbit.    \"Is it as pretty as the Turkey Dance?\"    \"Oh, a great deal prettier than the Turkey Dance.\"    \"Is it as pretty as the Eagle Dance?\"    \"Oh, a great deal prettier than the Eagle Dance.\"    The wolf asked if the new dance was as pretty as other dances he had  seen, and the rabbit said that it was much prettier.    This pleased the wolf, as he wished to have a new dance for the green  corn festival.    \"You may teach me the dance now,\" he said. \"I can cut off your ears  afterward.\"    \"Very well,\" said the rabbit; \"pat your foot to keep time, and watch me  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15173"],[0,"Pictures of Jewish Home-Life Fifty Years Ago (#11)"],[1,"ir. The  bridegroom's mother hands her a few silk handkerchiefs to be worn on her  head on special occasions. Sometimes the poor little bride is so young  that she cries while her beautiful plaits are being cut off.    \"At times a quarrel begins between the two mothers: the bride's mother  sometimes insisting that her child's hair shall only be cut short and  not shaved, and she generally gets her way.    \"Some brides do not mind being shaved, for they like the idea of wearing  the pretty coloured silk handkerchiefs.    \"At nearly every wedding a table is spread for the poor, and I was  present at a wedding when more than a hundred poor men came regularly  for eight days, and the table was spread as bountifully for them as for  the other guests. Here in Palestine the poor share in the joys of their  richer brethren.    \"When the eight days of Festival are over, the young couple usually  settle down close by or in one of their parents' homes, who give them a  room. A great deal of the happiness of young couples depends on the  character of the mother-in-law, for they have the power of making or  marring their happiness more than anyone else.    \"Huldah told me that she would have been quite happy in her  mother-in-law (for she really was a good kind woman) if only she would  more often allow her to talk to her husband, 'and I do so like a talk  with him,' she said to me with a sigh, 'for he is so wise. When my  mother-in-law sleeps after the Sabbath dinner, we go into the next room  and we sit talking, and he tells me tales from the Talmud, and sometimes  reads aloud from it. I do so enjoy those Sabbath hours,' she continued,  'for I have only my bedroom which I can call my own, but I am not  allowed to be much in it,--the little time I have with my husband each  day makes me very happy, for I know he loves me dearly (although he does  not say so), for when he comes home his first word is for me,'    \"'Sometimes, when my mother-in-law is in a good temper, she lets us eat  out of the same dish, and then he jokingly puts the daintiest bits on my  side; often when I wake in the mornings I find pinned to my pillow a few  words he has copied from the _Song of Songs_, put there before leaving  for the Synagogue.' Then Huldah added 'After returning himself from the  Synagogue on Sabbath Eve, my dear husband always looks at me with a  loving smile when he reads that part where it says: ''The price of a  virtuous woman is far above rubies, the heart of her husband trusteth in  her.' 'Yes indeed,' she said, 'thanks be to God--I am a very happy wife,  and when God blesses us with children, my cup of joy will be very full.'    \"And this child-wife of fifteen did indeed look very happy as she  spoke--and I, deep down in my heart, thought, 'What would they say to  such match-making in England and Western Europe,' and yet in Palestine  such marriages arranged by the parents are nearly always happy.    \"I must close now, Your loving Millie.\"    When Mr Jacob had finished reading, some of his young listeners said  they thought it was a very foolish way to arrange marriages. One of them  remarked: \"How could there be any love, if a couple rarely met each  other before marriage.\"    Another said: \"For my part, I would never marry unless I felt sure that  I was in love with my husband to-be and that he also was in love with  me. Love is everything in life, _I_ think.\"    Then said a middle-aged lady, much loved and respected by all the  listeners: \"How often has many a marriage not turned out well, even when  as young people a husband and wife had a passionate love for each  other. The seed of love may be sown before or after marriage; but,  unless carefully cultivated during married life by both husband and  wife, through deeds of kindness and thoughtfulness and forbearance and  mutual sympathy and understanding, the tender plant may soon wither and  die. The old customs of our race, which this letter shows are still kept  up in Palestine and I believe in other parts where ghetto life still  obtains, if they are not carried to extremes, are, I think, very wise;  but, unfortunately, our people are very tempted to go to extremes, and a  good custom can thus be distorted and brought to ridicule.\"    \"True, true,\" murmured some of the older people.    \"In all things moderation and balance are safe guides to follow,\" said  Mr. Jacobs.    The next book will be all about Millie's love affairs and marriage and  her life, impressions, and tribulations in Palestine.          APPENDIX      THE CELEBRATION OF THE JUBILEE OF ZORACH BARNETT    (Translated from the _Palestine Daily Mail_ of Friday, December 2nd,  1921).      Those who felt stirred to celebrate the jubilee of this illustrious old  pioneer did very well indeed. For a young man who leaves all his  business enterprises far behind him in London and who migrates to  Eretz-Israel over fifty years ago--at a time when Jaffe did not posses  even a Minyan foreign Jews; and at a time when the way from Jaffe to  Jerusalem was a very long and tedious one--aye, a way fraught with all  possible dangers, and moreover, teeming with robbers, a journey which  lasted three whole days, such a Jew is indeed entitled to some mark of  appreciation and respect.    A Jew who has worked for the re-building of our land for over fifty  consecutive years in which period he visited the lands of the Diaspora  fifteen times and all that he did and profited there was afterwards  invested in the re-building of Eretz-Israel such a Jew has indeed  merited to be praised even during his life-time.    A Jew who was one of the first to found the colony of Petah-Tikvah and  therefore merited that people in Jerusalem should mark him out as an  object of derision and scorn because he was a dreamer--a man who built  the first house in this Petah-Tikvah--who was one of the founders of the  \"Me'ah Shearim in Jerusalem--who constructed perfect roads in Jaffe--who  founded Zionist Societies in the lands of the Diaspora at a time when  Zion did not occupy such a foremost part in the heart of the Jew--such a  Jew is indeed worthy that a monument of his splendid achievement be  erected for him even during his life-time!\"    It must, moreover, be mentioned that Z. Barnett and his wife are one of  the remnant of those noble men who participated in that famous assembly  of Kattovitz--that noble gathering of illustrious men which can be  verily described as the Aurora as the Dawn of the conception of the  Restoration of the land of Israel.    The celebration took place on Sunday, November 27th, in the private  house of Mr. Barnett. Those who had assembled were many, in fact, there  were present representatives of every shade and section of Jewish  communal life in Palestine. Thus there came along Rabbis of all the  various congregations, various Jewish communal workers, heads of  colonies, teachers, business men and workpeople and even beggars who  came to enjoy the material blessings of this great national festivity.    Mr. Joseph Lipshitz opened the proceedings by explaining the importance  of this great red letter day for Mr. Barnett and then called upon Rabbi  Auerbach of Jerusalem who had come specially to take part in this  celebration. Rabbi Auerbach delivered a long Talmudical dissertation in  which he recited the great merits of the jubilant. He compared Z.  Barnett to a king, because he based himself on a Talmudic statement  concerning Omri which asserts that he who builds a little town or  village is worthy to be called a king. The learned Rabbi also emphasised  the importance of acquiring land in Palestine by many pithy remarks.  Then spoke the Rabbis: Joseph Ha-levi, Shneiur Lenskin, Joseph Arwatz  and Joseph Rabbi. All these testified to the great qualities of their  host, who besides being a great idealist was also a very practical man  too.    After the Rabbis, Mr. S. Nissim, chief of the colony of Petah-Tikvah  spoke. He narrated in a very realistic and eloquent way how that pioneer  Zorach Barnett came fifty years ago to build up the ruins of the land  and how he bought up the land of Petah-Tikvah, which was now a  flourishing colony, but which was then a howling desert wilderness, such  as only insane men could ever think of converting this into an  habitation of men. At the present day, thousands of pioneers are  flocking to the land, but they are only a continuation of the pioneering  of Z. Barnett and his stalwart companions. The speaker concluded by  blessing the jubilant that he should survive to see thousands of Jewish  Colonies in Palestine and tens of thousands of pioneers flocking here  from every part of the world.    Mr. I. Adler, chief representative of the Council at Jaffe, also spoke  on this great member of the Jewish community at Jaffe. Such men are  really a blessing to the whole of Israel; they are not only Banim (sons)  of the Jewish people, but also Bonim (builders).    Many were the letters and telegrams of congratulation received on this  occasion from various ranks of Jewish representatives in Palestine. The  private secretary of Sir Herbert Samuel wrote: \"I am commanded by His  Excellency, the High Commissioner, to acknowledge your invitation to  partake in your celebration of the 27th inst. His Excellency, is,  however, restrained from accepting this invitation owing to the various  duties which occupy him at present. He sends you his blessing and hopes  that all your ambitions will be realised with, the greatest success.\"    The Chief Rabbi of Eretz-Israel, Rabbi A.I. Kook, wrote: \"I should very  much have wished to be present at the occasion of the jubilee of my dear  and respected friend, who first trod upon this Holy soil over fifty  years ago and who has since then been building up the ruins of our land,  but, unfortunately, to my great pain, I am not able to realise this my  wish, owing to the present troubled state of the Jewish community.
