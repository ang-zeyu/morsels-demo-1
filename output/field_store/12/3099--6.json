Kaiber here brought in some of the nuts of the Zamia tree; they were dry  and therefore in a fit state to eat. I accordingly shared them amongst  the party. Several of the men then straggled off to look for more, and  were imprudent enough, before I found out what they were doing, to eat  several of the nuts which were not sufficiently dried, the consequences  of which were that they were seized with violent fits of vomiting  accompanied by vertigo and other distressing symptoms; these however  gradually abated during the night, and in the morning, although rendered  more weak than they were before, the poor fellows were still able to  resume their march.    GENEROUS CONDUCT OF ONE OF THE MEN.    Soon after the fires had been lighted I was sitting alone by mine, as the  shadows of night were just falling over the wild hilly scenery with which  we were surrounded; I had no water to cook a portion of the three  spoonfuls of arrowroot yet left me, and I saw each of the others  preparing his scanty portion of food. The native had at this time gone  away to look for Zamia nuts, and it may be imagined that many almost  undefined feelings at such a time thronged rapidly through my mind.  Whilst thus thinking I heard Hackney propose to Woods to offer me a share  of their little store of food: \"No,\" said Woods; \"everyone for himself  under these circumstances; let Mr. Grey do as well as he can and I will  do the same.\" \"Well then I shall give him some of mine at all events,\"  said Hackney; and a few minutes afterwards he came up to my fire and  pressed me to accept a morsel of damper about the size of a walnut. I  hesitated at first whether to do so or not, but, being aware that when we  came into a country where game was to be found I could, by means of my  gun, provide enough amply to repay this lad, I took it, after several  refusals and having it as often warmly pressed upon me.    I was much affected by the kindness of Hackney, who was a young American;  and I regret to add that I felt more hurt than I ought to have done at  the remark of Woods.      CHAPTER 4. FROM GAIRDNER'S RANGE TO PERTH.    THE HILL RIVER.    Sunday April 14.    We travelled about fourteen miles due south over a range of high  ironstone hills which were occasionally clothed with grass-trees. The  scrub was however still thick, prickly, and very difficult to penetrate;  the heat was intense and the whole party were getting very weak. About  noon, and when we had just gained a commanding summit, I looked back at  Mount Perron, now several miles in our rear; from this point we began to  descend into an extensive valley, and at the end of fourteen miles  reached a small river which I named the Hill.    DISCOVERY AND PILLAGE OF A NATIVE PROVISION STORE.    We halted at the first pool we came to and the men, who had a little  flour left, boiled two tablespoonfuls of this in about a pint and a half  of water, thus making what they called soup. In the meantime Kaiber came  in and told me that he had found some holes in which the natives had,  according to their custom, buried a store of By-yu nuts,* and he at the  same time requested permission to steal them.    (*Footnote. The nut of the Zamia tree.)    I reflected for some time on his proposal; I was reluctant to mark the  first approach of civilized man to this country of a savage race by an  unprovoked act of pillage and robbery; yet we were now in the desert, on  the point of perishing for want of food, the pangs of hunger gnawing us  even in our very sleep, and with the means of temporary relief at hand. I  asked myself if I should be acting justly or humanely by the others,  whose lives were at stake if I allowed them to pass by the store, which  seemed providentially offered to us, without pointing it out.    In my perplexity I turned to Kaiber: his answer was, \"If we take all,  this people will be angered greatly; they will say, 'What thief has  stolen here: track his footsteps, spear him through the heart; wherefore  has he stolen our hidden food?' But if we take what is buried in one hole  they will say, 'Hungry people have been here; they were very empty, and  now their bellies are full; they may be sorcerers; now they will not eat  us as we sleep.'\" Good, it is good, Kaiber,\" I replied; \"come with me and  we will rob one hole.\" And accordingly we went and took the contents of  one, leaving three others undisturbed. I brought back these nuts to the  men and we shared them amongst us.    We were so weary that we did not start until late in the afternoon, and  then travelled south by east down the course of the river, making about  six miles. It was joined by many small tributaries and now became a  running stream flowing through a deep grassy valley in which were many  large flats. In the course of the afternoon some of the men had a shot at  a native dog; he was a fine fat fellow; but they were unsuccessful and  never did I feel more disappointed than when I saw him cantering away  desperately frightened but perfectly uninjured. I was sufficiently  fortunate to shoot a hawk just before nightfall, and we then halted by  the side of the river, lighted our fires, and laid down to sleep.    April 15.    In the course of the night I had cooked the hawk which I shot yesterday  and before starting divided it as follows: I gave the head, entrails, and  shanks to the native; then cutting the residue in half I gave one part to  Hackney, who had so generously shared his morsel of damper with me, and  kept the remaining portion for myself. Poor Hackney's wan and wasted  countenance glowed with pleasure when this acceptable gift was placed in  his hands, and I felt no slight degree of satisfaction in having an  opportunity of showing him that I felt grateful for his act of generosity  to me.    We now followed the course of the river for about two miles further and  saw a considerable quantity of good land along its banks, clothed with  feed for stock; but I cannot tell how far back this extends.    The river now ran away nearly due west under a low range of hills; and  still adhering to my original plan I quitted its banks and continued my  course straight for Perth, travelling in a south by east direction. The  next two and a half miles led us to the top of a low range. The whole  tract of country between this point and the river was arid and barren in  the extreme, being devoid of all vegetation but a stunted prickly scrub,  and on it we saw no signs either of animal life or water. We here for the  first time since quitting Moresby's Flat-topped Range saw that the one to  the east of us became well wooded, the interval between these two points  having been completely bare of trees.    BARREN COUNTRY.    I now halted for about an hour and a half to rest the wearied men, and  then again commenced our route over this barren waste. For the next  twelve miles we travelled down a gentle descent leading to a very deep  valley, and late in the evening reached some dried up swamps where we  made an ineffectual search for water; we however saw here some parakeets,  and I was lucky enough to kill one which was about the size of a thrush;  several of the men also got shots at these little birds, but without  success. As the day had been intensely hot and we had tasted no water  since morning we suffered a great deal from want of it, but were at  length compelled by darkness to lie down to rest without finding any.    DRY BED OF THE SMITH RIVER.    April 16.    We had not travelled above two miles this morning in an east-south-east  direction when I found that we had reached the bottom of the valley into  which we had yesterday evening commenced our descent. In this valley lay  the dried up bed of a considerable stream, which I have named the Smith  after my unfortunate friend. Its direction was from north-east to south.    LONG AND UTTER DESTITUTION OF FOOD AND WATER. SUFFERINGS FROM THIRST.    As we were now suffering a good deal from thirst we made a search in both  directions along the bed, but although there were many pools (some of  them being twelve or fourteen feet deep) we could not find the slightest  indication of water having stood in them for a considerable time: in the  bottom of one of the deepest of these pools was a native well, dug to the  depth of about seven feet, but even at this distance below the surface we  could see no signs whatever of water. There was much good land in the  valley through which this watercourse wound, but all was barren and arid.  In the course of the morning we had seen a flight of cockatoos coming  from the eastward down the valley in which the bed of the river lay,  which at the time made me imagine that water would be found in that  direction in the interior, and the natives subsequently stated that such  was the case, but our circumstances would not admit such a deviation from  our course in a search which if unsuccessful would have proved fatal.    DISTRESSING SEARCH FOR WATER.    The sun had by this time become intensely hot, and the poor fellows grew  faint for want of water, whilst it aggravated their sufferings that they  stood upon the brink of a river, or wandered along its banks with eager  piercing eyes, and an air of intense scrutinizing watchfulness peculiar  to those who search for that on which their lives depend. One while they  explored a shallow stony part of the bed, which was parched up and  blackened by the fiery sun; their steps were slow and listless, and I  could plainly see how faint, weak, and weary they were; the next minute  another pool would be discerned ahead, the depth of which the eye could  not at a distance reach; now they hurried on towards it with a dreadful  look of eager anxiety, the pool was reached, the bottom seen, but, alas!  no water; then they paused and looked one at the other with an air of  utter despair.

As well might one go to Rheims to see men fly, and be shown nothing  else but screws and nuts, steel rods and cog-wheels. Originally the  fault, perhaps, lay with the archaeologist; now it lies both with him and  with the public. The public has learnt to ask to be shown the works, and  the archaeologist is often so proud of them that he forgets to mention  the purpose of the machine.    A Roman statue of bronze, let us suppose, is discovered in the Thames  valley. It is so corroded and eaten away that only an expert could  recognise that it represents a reclining goddess. In this condition it  is placed in the museum, and a photograph of it is published in 'The  Graphic.' Those who come to look at it in its glass case think it is a  bunch of grapes, or possibly a monkey: those who see its photograph say  that it is more probably an irregular catapult-stone or a fish in  convulsions.    The archaeologist alone holds its secret, and only he can see it as it  was. He alone can know the mind of the artist who made it, or interpret  the full meaning of the conception. It might have been expected, then,  that the public would demand, and the archaeologist delightedly furnish,  a model of the figure as near to the original as possible; or, failing  that, a restoration in drawing, or even a worded description of its  original beauty. But no: the public, if it wants anything, wants to see  the shapeless object in all its corrosion; and the archaeologist forgets  that it is blind to aught else but that corrosion. One of the main  duties of the archaeologist is thus lost sight of: his duty as  Interpreter and Remembrancer of the Past.    All the riches of olden times, all the majesty, all the power, are the  inheritance of the present day; and the archaeologist is the recorder of  this fortune. He must deal in dead bones only so far as the keeper of a  financial fortune must deal in dry documents. Behind those documents  glitters the gold, and behind those bones shines the wonder of the  things that were. And when an object once beautiful has by age become  unsightly, one might suppose that he would wish to show it to none save  his colleagues or the reasonably curious layman. When a man makes the  statement that his grandmother, now in her ninety-ninth year, was once a  beautiful woman, he does not go and find her to prove his words and  bring her tottering into the room: he shows a picture of her as she was;  or, if he cannot find one, he describes what good evidence tells him was  her probable appearance. In allowing his controlled and sober  imagination thus to perform its natural functions, though it would never  do to tell his grandmother so, he becomes an archaeologist, a  remembrancer of the Past.    In the case of archaeology, however, the public does not permit itself so  to be convinced. In the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford excellent facsimile  electrotypes of early Greek weapons are exhibited; and these have far  more value in bringing the Past before us than the actual weapons of  that period, corroded and broken, would have. But the visitor says,  \"These are shams,\" and passes on.    It will be seen, then, that the business of archaeology is often  misunderstood both by archaeologists and by the public; and that there is  really no reason to believe, with Thomas Earle, that the real  antiquarian loves a thing the better for that it is rotten and stinketh.  That the impression has gone about is his own fault, for he has exposed  too much to view the mechanism of his work; but it is also the fault of  the public for not asking of him a picture of things as they were.    Man is by nature a creature of the present. It is only by an effort that  he can consider the future, it is often quite impossible for him to give  any heed at all to the Past. The days of old are so blurred and remote  that it seems right to him that any relic from them should, by the  maltreatment of Time, be unrecognisable. The finding of an old sword,  half-eaten by rust, will only please him in so far as it shows him once  more by its sad condition the great gap between those days and these,  and convinces him again of the sole importance of the present. The  archaeologist, he will tell you, is a fool if he expects him to be  interested in a wretched old bit of scrap-iron. He is right. It would be  as rash to suppose that he would find interest in an ancient sword in  its rusted condition as it would be to expect the spectator at Rheims to  find fascination in the nuts and screws. The true archaeologist would  hide that corroded weapon in his workshop, where his fellow-workers  alone could see it. For he recognises that it is only the sword which is  as good as new that impresses the public; it is only the Present that  counts. That is the real reason why he is an archaeologist. He has turned  to the Past because he is in love with the Present. He, more than any  man, worships at the altar of the goddess of To-day; and he is so  desirous of extending her dominion that he has adventured, like a  crusader, into the lands of the Past in order to subject them to her.  Adoring the Now, he would resent the publicity of anything which so  obviously suggested the Then as a rust-eaten old blade. His whole  business is to hide the gap between Yesterday and To-day; and, unless a  man is initiate, he would have him either see the perfect sword as it  was when it sought the foeman's bowels, or see nothing. The Present is  too small for him; and it is therefore that he calls so insistently to  the Past to come forth from the darkness to augment it. The ordinary  man lives in the Present, and he will tell one that the archaeologist  lives in the Past. This is not so. The layman, in the manner of the  Little Englander, lives in a small and confined Present; but the  archaeologist, like a true Imperialist, ranges through all time, and  calls it not the Past but the Greater Present.    The archaeologist is not, or ought not to be, lacking in vivacity. One  might say that he is so sensible to the charms of society that, finding  his companions too few in number, he has drawn the olden times to him to  search them for jovial men and agreeable women. It might be added that  he has so laughed at jest and joke that, fearing lest the funds of  humour run dry, he has gathered the laughter of all the years to his  enrichment. Certainly he has so delighted in noble adventure and  stirring action that he finds his newspaper insufficient to his needs,  and fetches to his aid the tales of old heroes. In fact, the  archaeologist is so enamoured of life that he would raise all the dead  from their graves. He will not have it that the men of old are dust: he  would bring them to him to share with him the sunlight which he finds so  precious. He is so much an enemy of Death and Decay that he would rob  them of their harvest; and, for every life the foe has claimed, he would  raise up, if he could, a memory that would continue to live.    The meaning of the heading which has been given to this chapter is now  becoming clear, and the direction of the argument is already apparent.  So far it has been my purpose to show that the archaeologist is not a  rag-and-bone man, though the public generally thinks he is, and he often  thinks he is himself. The attempt has been made to suggest that  archaeology ought not to consist in sitting in a charnel-house amongst  the dead, but rather in ignoring that place and taking the bones into  the light of day, decently clad in flesh and finery. It has now to be  shown in what manner this parading of the Past is needful to the gaiety  of the Present.    Amongst cultured people whose social position makes it difficult for  them to dance in circles on the grass in order to express or to  stimulate their gaiety, and whose school of deportment will not permit  them to sing a merry song of sixpence as they trip down the streets,  there is some danger of the fire of merriment dying for want of fuel.  Vivacity in printed books, therefore, has been encouraged, so that the  mind at least, if not the body, may skip about and clap its hands. A  portly gentleman with a solemn face, reading his 'Punch' in the club,  is, after all, giving play to precisely those same humours which in  ancient days might have led him, like Georgy Porgy, to kiss the girls or  to perform any other merry joke. It is necessary, therefore, ever to  enlarge the stock of things humorous, vivacious, or rousing, if thoughts  are to be kept young and eyes bright in this age of restraint. What  would Yuletide be without the olden times to bolster it? What would the  Christmas numbers do without the pictures of our great-grandparents'  coaches snow-bound, of huntsmen of the eighteenth century, of jesters at  the courts of the barons? What should we do without the 'Vicar of  Wakefield,' the 'Compleat Angler,' 'Pepys' Diary,' and all the rest of  the ancient books? And, going back a few centuries, what an amount we  should miss had we not 'AEsop's Fables,' the 'Odyssey,' the tales of the  Trojan War, and so on. It is from the archaeologist that one must expect  the augmentation of this supply; and just in that degree in which the  existing supply is really a necessary part of our equipment, so  archaeology, which looks for more, is necessary to our gaiety.
