This was agreed to; but before they had proceeded far, Mr. Marchdale  said,--    \"There is a ladder lying on the wall; would it not be a good plan to  place it against the very spot the supposed vampyre jumped over last  night, and so, from a more elevated position, take a view of the open  meadows. We could easily drop down on the outer side, if we saw anything  suspicious.\"    \"Not a bad plan,\" said the doctor. \"Shall we do it?\"    \"Certainly,\" said Henry; and they accordingly carried the ladder, which  had been used for pruning the trees, towards the spot at the end of the  long walk, at which the vampyre had made good, after so many fruitless  efforts, his escape from the premises.    They made haste down the long vista of trees until they reached the  exact spot, and then they placed the ladder as near as possible, exactly  where Henry, in his bewilderment on the evening before, had seen the  apparition from the grave spring to.    \"We can ascend singly,\" said Marchdale; \"but there is ample space for us  all there to sit on the top of the wall and make our observations.\"    This was seen to be the case, and in about a couple of minutes they had  taken up their positions on the wall, and, although the height was but  trifling, they found that they had a much more extensive view than they  could have obtained by any other means.    \"To contemplate the beauty of such a night as this,\" said Mr.  Chillingworth, \"is amply sufficient compensation for coming the distance  I have.\"    \"And who knows,\" remarked Marchdale, \"we may yet see something which may  throw a light upon our present perplexities God knows that I would give  all I can call mine in the world to relieve you and your sister, Henry  Bannerworth, from the fearful effect which last night's proceedings  cannot fail to have upon you.\"    \"Of that I am well assured, Mr. Marchdale,\" said Henry. \"If the  happiness of myself and family depended upon you, we should be happy  indeed.\"    \"You are silent, Mr. Chillingworth,\" remarked Marchdale, after a slight  pause.    \"Hush!\" said Mr. Chillingworth--\"hush--hush!\"    \"Good God, what do you hear?\" cried Henry.    The doctor laid his hand upon Henry's arm as he said,--    \"There is a young lime tree yonder to the right.\"    \"Yes--yes.\"    \"Carry your eye from it in a horizontal line, as near as you can,  towards the wood.\"    Henry did so, and then he uttered a sudden exclamation of surprise, and  pointed to a rising spot of ground, which was yet, in consequence of the  number of tall trees in its vicinity, partially enveloped in shadow.    \"What is that?\" he said.    \"I see something,\" said Marchdale. \"By Heaven! it is a human form lying  stretched there.\"    \"It is--as if in death.\"    \"What can it be?\" said Chillingworth.    \"I dread to say,\" replied Marchdale; \"but to my eyes, even at this  distance, it seems like the form of him we chased last night.\"    \"The vampyre?\"    \"Yes--yes. Look, the moonbeams touch him. Now the shadows of the trees  gradually recede. God of Heaven! the figure moves.\"    Henry's eyes were riveted to that fearful object, and now a scene  presented itself which filled them all with wonder and astonishment,  mingled with sensations of the greatest awe and alarm.    As the moonbeams, in consequence of the luminary rising higher and  higher in the heavens, came to touch this figure that lay extended on  the rising ground, a perceptible movement took place in it. The limbs  appeared to tremble, and although it did not rise up, the whole body  gave signs of vitality.    \"The vampyre--the vampyre!\" said Mr. Marchdale. \"I cannot doubt it now.  We must have hit him last night with the pistol bullets, and the  moonbeams are now restoring him to a new life.\"    Henry shuddered, and even Mr. Chillingworth turned pale. But he was the  first to recover himself sufficiently to propose some course of action,  and he said,--    \"Let us descend and go up to this figure. It is a duty we owe to  ourselves as much as to society.\"    \"Hold a moment,\" said Mr. Marchdale, as he produced a pistol. \"I am an  unerring shot, as you well know, Henry. Before we move from this  position we now occupy, allow me to try what virtue may be in a bullet  to lay that figure low again.\"    \"He is rising!\" exclaimed Henry.    Mr. Marchdale levelled the pistol--he took a sure and deliberate aim,  and then, just as the figure seemed to be struggling to its feet, he  fired, and, with a sudden bound, it fell again.    \"You have hit it,\" said Henry.    \"You have indeed,\" exclaimed the doctor. \"I think we can go now.\"    \"Hush!\" said Marchdale--\"Hush! Does it not seem to you that, hit it as  often as you will, the moonbeams will recover it?\"    \"Yes--yes,\" said Henry, \"they will--they will.\"    \"I can endure this no longer,\" said Mr. Chillingworth, as he sprung from  the wall. \"Follow me or not, as you please, I will seek the spot where  this being lies.\"    \"Oh, be not rash,\" cried Marchdale. \"See, it rises again, and its form  looks gigantic.\"    \"I trust in Heaven and a righteous cause,\" said the doctor, as he drew  the sword he had spoken of from the stick, and threw away the scabbard.  \"Come with me if you like, or I go alone.\"    Henry at once jumped down from the wall, and then Marchdale followed  him, saying,--    \"Come on; I will not shrink.\"    They ran towards the piece of rising ground; but before they got to it,  the form rose and made rapidly towards a little wood which was in the  immediate neighbourhood of the hillock.    \"It is conscious of being pursued,\" cried the doctor. \"See how it  glances back, and then increases its speed.\"    \"Fire upon it, Henry,\" said Marchdale.    He did so; but either his shot did not take effect, or it was quite  unheeded if it did, by the vampyre, which gained the wood before they  could have a hope of getting sufficiently near it to effect, or  endeavour to effect, a capture.    \"I cannot follow it there,\" said Marchdale. \"In open country I would  have pursued it closely; but I cannot follow it into the intricacies of  a wood.\"    \"Pursuit is useless there,\" said Henry. \"It is enveloped in the deepest  gloom.\"    \"I am not so unreasonable,\" remarked Mr. Chillingworth, \"as to wish you  to follow into such a place as that. I am confounded utterly by this  affair.\"    \"And I,\" said Marchdale. \"What on earth is to be done?\"    \"Nothing--nothing!\" exclaimed Henry, vehemently; \"and yet I have,  beneath the canopy of Heaven, declared that I will, so help me God!  spare neither time nor trouble in the unravelling of this most fearful  piece of business. Did either of you remark the clothing which this  spectral appearance wore?\"    \"They were antique clothes,\" said Mr. Chillingworth, \"such as might have  been fashionable a hundred years ago, but not now.\"    \"Such was my impression,\" added Marchdale.    \"And such my own,\" said Henry, excitedly. \"Is it at all within the  compass of the wildest belief that what we have seen is a vampyre, and  no other than my ancestor who, a hundred years ago, committed suicide?\"    There was so much intense excitement, and evidence of mental suffering,  that Mr. Chillingworth took him by the arm, saying,--    \"Come home--come home; no more of this at present; you will but make  yourself seriously unwell.\"    \"No--no--no.\"    \"Come home now, I pray you; you are by far too much excited about this  matter to pursue it with the calmness which should be brought to bear  upon it.\"    \"Take advice, Henry,\" said Marchdale, \"take advice, and come home at  once.\"    \"I will yield to you; I feel that I cannot control my own feelings--I  will yield to you, who, as you say, are cooler on this subject than I  can be. Oh, Flora, Flora, I have no comfort to bring to you now.\"    Poor Henry Bannerworth appeared to be in a complete state of mental  prostration, on account of the distressing circumstances that had  occurred so rapidly and so suddenly in his family, which had had quite  enough to contend with without having superadded to every other evil the  horror of believing that some preternatural agency was at work to  destroy every hope of future happiness in this world, under any  circumstances.    He suffered himself to be led home by Mr. Chillingworth and Marchdale;  he no longer attempted to dispute the dreadful fact concerning the  supposed vampyre; he could not contend now against all the corroborating  circumstances that seemed to collect together for the purpose of proving  that which, even when proved, was contrary to all his notions of Heaven,  and at variance with all that was recorded and established is part and  parcel of the system of nature.    \"I cannot deny,\" he said, when they had reached home, \"that such things  are possible; but the probability will not bear a moment's  investigation.\"    \"There are more things,\" said Marchdale, solemnly, \"in Heaven, and on  earth, than are dreamed of in our philosophy.\"    \"There are indeed, it appears,\" said Mr. Chillingworth.    \"And are you a convert?\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14835"],[0,"The Burglar and the Blizzard: A Christmas Story (#11)"],[1," fire,\" she said. \"Don't you see it is Billy?\"    There was a pause--the fraction of a second, but momentous, for Geoffrey  realised that all his threats to McVay had been idle, that with that  touch on his arm he could not shoot.    Nevertheless he raised his voice and shouted thunderously: \"McVay!\"    The figure turned, hesitated, saw, perhaps, the gleam of the moon on  steel and began to retrace his steps.    Steadily with the revolver still upon him he moved back to the house.  Under the piazza he stopped and waved his hand.    \"I'm afraid they got away from us, Holland. I did my best.\"    \"There _was_ a burglar then!\" said the girl in the little whisper of  recent fright.    \"By Heaven, he shall not trouble you,\" returned Holland with more  earnestness than seemed to be required. Then he left her and went down  to meet McVay.    \"You were just about half a second ahead of a bullet,\" he remarked,  ushering him into the hall. To be caught and brought back is so  ignominious a position that Geoffrey looked to see even McVay at a  disadvantage, but looked in vain. The aspect worn was a particularly  self-satisfied one.    \"I was aware I took a risk,\" he answered; \"I took it gladly for my  sister's sake.\"    \"For your sister's sake?\"    \"Yes, and yours. Be honest, Holland, what could be so great a relief to  you as to find I had disappeared. You are too narrow-minded, too  honourable, you would say, to connive at it, but you would be delighted  to know that you need not prosecute me.\"    \"If I shot you, I should be saved the trouble of prosecuting.\"    \"But at what a cost! I refer to my sister's regard. No, no, the thing,  if you had only been quick enough to see it, was for me to escape. It  was a risk, of course, but a risk I gladly took for my sister's sake. I  would take longer ones for her.\"    \"Do you mean that?\"    \"Of course.\"    \"Then take this revolver and go out and shoot yourself.\"    McVay looked very thoughtful. Then, he said gravely, \"No, no, Holland.  To take a risk is one thing,--to kill myself quite another. I have  always had a strong prejudice against suicide. I think it a cowardly  action. And it would be no help to you. She would not believe that I had  committed suicide. She knows my views on the subject, and could imagine  no motive. No, that would not do at all. I'm surprised at the  suggestion. It is against my principles.\"    \"Your principles!\" Geoffrey sneered. Nevertheless, he was not a little  altered in opinion. It had been something of a shock to him to find that  he could not shoot at the critical instant. It had shaken his faith in  himself. He began to doubt if he would be capable of sending the man to  state's prison when Cecilia besought his pity. His own limitations faced  him. He was not the relentless judge he had supposed himself. Yet on the  other hand, the remembrance of Vaughan and the other men he was  representing held him to his idea of justice. \"Sit down,\" he said  suddenly turning to McVay, \"and write me out a list of everything you  have stolen in this neighbourhood and where it is and how it may be  obtained. Yes, I know it is difficult, but you had better try to do it  for on the completeness of your list depends your only chance of  avoiding the law. If I can return all properly, perhaps--I have a mine  in Mexico, a hell on earth, where you can go if you prefer it to penal  servitude. There won't be much difference, except for the publicity of a  trial. I've a man there who, when I give him his orders, would  infinitely rather shoot you than take any risk of your getting away.  Which will you have?\"    \"Can you ask, Holland? Which will be easier for my sister?\"    \"Sit down and write your list, then.\"    \"An interesting occupation, mining,\" observed McVay as he opened the  portfolio. After this for a long time nothing was heard but the soft  noise of the pencil and an occasional comment from the writer:    \"A rare piece that. I parted with it absurdly low, but the dealer was a  connoisseur--appealed to my artistic side.\"    Things had gone on thus for perhaps an hour when a step sounded outside  and the door bell rang. Both men jumped to their feet.    \"My God, Holland,\" said McVay, \"if that is the police, keep your wits  about you or we are lost.\"    It was a revelation to Geoffrey to find how completely, as his alarm  showed, he had cast in his interests with McVay's. He stepped forward in  silence and opened the door.    Not the police, but a man in plain clothes was standing there.    \"I'm glad to see you safe, Mr. Holland,\" he said. \"There has been great  anxiety felt for your safety. I am a detective working on the Vaughan  and Marheim cases. I got word to come and look you up as you did not get  back to the gardener's cottage the night before last.\"    \"The snow detained me,\" said Geoffrey slowly.    \"Come in, come in, friend,\" said McVay briskly. \"You must be cold.\"    It speaks well for the professional eye that the detective, after  studying McVay for an instant, asked:    \"I did not catch this gentleman's name. Who is he?\"    There was a barely perceptible pause. Then Geoffrey answered coolly:  \"That is the man you are after.\"    \"Are you crazy, Holland?\" shouted McVay.    \"What, the Vaughan burglar? You caught him without assistance?\" Envy and  admiration struggled on the detective's countenance. \"I must  congratulate you, sir.\"    Geoffrey allowed himself the luxury of a groan. \"You needn't,\" he said;  \"I am no subject for congratulation. I can't even prosecute him,  confound him, for several reasons. We were at school together, and I can  take no steps in the matter.\"    \"But I can,\" said the detective; \"indeed it is my duty to.\"    \"No,\" said Geoffrey, \"nor can you. This man cannot be sent to prison.  Yes, I know, it is compounding a felony. Well, sit down, and we'll  compound it.\"    \"I could not agree to anything of the kind,\" said the detective.    \"I don't see exactly what you can do about it.\" Geoffrey was deliberate  and very polite. \"For reasons which I can't explain, but which you would  appreciate, leave me no choice. I have to save this man from jail. If  you intend to work against me, I shall simply let him escape at once.  Don't draw your revolver, please. I prefer to be the only person with a  weapon in my hand. He has made a list of all the things he has stolen,  and I shall see that they are returned to their owners at any cost. Will  you undertake to get him safely to a mine I own in Mexico? Once there he  can't get away. It is forty-five miles from a railway. If you accomplish  this, I will give you ten thousand to make up for the reward you didn't  get,--five thousand down, and five thousand at the end of a year.\"    \"I don't know what to say,\" said the man. \"It sounds like a bribe.\"    \"It is,\" said Geoffrey coolly.    \"I never received such a proposition,\" returned the man.    \"That scheme won't do, Holland,\" put in McVay. \"Can't you see it lays  you open to blackmail?\"    \"From you?\" said Geoffrey. \"I had thought of that, but you can't  blackmail me at La Santa Anna, and if you get away and come close enough  to blackmail me, I'll put you in prison without a moment's hesitation. I  shall be in a position by that time to take care of the feelings of the  other people concerned.\"    \"You don't understand me,\" answered McVay; \"I meant blackmail from this  man.\"    \"Oh,\" said Geoffrey civilly, \"I am convinced he is not a blackmailer.  And besides, he won't get his second five thousand for a year, and as I  was saying to you, after a year I don't so much mind having the whole  thing known. My reputation will stand it, I think, if yours and his  will.\"    \"I'm no blackmailer,\" said this detective. \"If I accept, I'll be on the  square.\"    \"If you do, let me offer you a piece of advice,\" observed Geoffrey, \"and  that is not to take your eye off that man for a single instant. He is a  slippery customer, and you run a fair chance of not seeing my money at  all, if you give him the smallest loophole.\"    The detective considered McVay carefully from head to foot. Then he said  gravely:    \"Is there any way of getting to this place of yours by water? I don't  see my way to taking this customer in a Pullman car. If he chooses to  slip overboard from a boat, why no one would be any the worse, unless  maybe the sharks.\"    \"Very true,\" agreed Geoffrey amiably. \"Fortunately you can get a steamer  in New York.\"    It soon became apparent that the detective failed to see any good reason  for declining so advantageous an offer as Geoffrey's, and they were  presently deep in the discussion of their plans, McVay meanwhile  studying the map with unfeigned interest in the situation of his future  residence.    Cecilia, fortunately, gave them plenty of time for their arrangements,  for she had fallen asleep again, after the alarm of the early morning,  and the men must have been talking for two hours when she appeared at  the library door.    She cast a look of surprise at the addition to their party and Geoffrey  saw with a sort of paralysis that she was inclined to set him down as  the burglar whose footsteps she had heard in the night. To prevent any  betrayal of this opinion, Geoffrey advanced a few steps to meet her,  although as he did so, he realised that he had nothing to answer when  she asked, as of course she did ask: \"Who is that?\"    A sort of desperation, the cowardice that will sometimes attack the  brave took hold of Geoffrey. He looked at her hopelessly and would  perhaps in another instant have told her the truth, had not McVay, not  the least disconcerted, taken the lead.    \"This, Cecilia,\" he said exuberantly, laying his hand on the detective's  shoulder, \"is my old friend Picklebody,--Henderson Picklebody. You have  heard his name often enough, and he, yours, too. Eh, Henderson, in the  old Machita days?\"    The detective, whose name was George P. Cook, was so taken up with his  surprise at the apparition of a beautiful"]]]
