The soldiers did not judge Vitellius' actions as those of  a mere ex-consul: they took him for something more, and, while serious  critics found him undignified,[95] his supporters spoke of his  affability and beneficence, because he showed neither moderation nor  judgement in making presents out of his own money and squandering  other people's. Besides, they were so greedy for power that they took  even his vices for virtues. In both armies there were plenty of quiet,  law-abiding men as well as many who were unprincipled and disorderly.  But for sheer reckless cupidity none could match two of the legionary  legates, Alienus Caecina and Fabius Valens.[96] Valens was hostile to  Galba, because, after unmasking Verginius's hesitation[97] and  thwarting Capito's designs, he considered that he had been treated  with ingratitude: so he incited Vitellius by pointing out to him the  enthusiasm of the troops. 'You,' he would say to him, 'are famous  everywhere, and you need find no obstacle in Hordeonius Flaccus.[98]  Britain will join and the German auxiliaries will flock to your  standard. Galba cannot trust the provinces; the poor old man holds the  empire on sufferance; the transfer can be soon effected, if only you  will clap on full sail and meet your good fortune half-way. Verginius  was quite right to hesitate. He came of a family of knights, and his  father was a nobody. He would have failed, had he accepted the empire:  his refusal saved him. Your father was thrice consul, and he was  censor with an emperor for his colleague.[99] That gives you imperial  dignity to start with, and makes it unsafe for you to remain a private  citizen.'    These promptings stirred Vitellius' sluggish nature to form desires,  but hardly hopes.    Caecina, on the other hand, in Upper Germany, was a handsome            53  youth, whose big build, imperious spirit, clever tongue, and upright  carriage had completely won the hearts of the soldiers. While quaestor  in Baetica[100] he had promptly joined Galba's party, and in spite of  his youth had been given command of a legion. Later he was convicted  of misappropriating public funds, and, on Galba's orders, prosecuted  for peculation. Highly indignant, Caecina determined to embroil the  world and bury his own disgrace in the ruins of his country. Nor were  the seeds of dissension lacking in the army. The entire force had  taken part in the war against Vindex, nor was it until after Nero's  death that they joined Galba's side, and even then they had been  forestalled in swearing allegiance by the detachments of Lower  Germany. Then again the Treviri and Lingones[101] and the other  communities which Galba had punished by issuing harsh edicts and  confiscating part of their territory, were in close communication with  the winter quarters of the legions. They began to talk treason: the  soldiers degenerated in civilian society: it only wanted some one to  avail himself of the offer they had made to Verginius.    Following an ancient custom, the tribe of the Lingones had made a       54  present of a pair of silver hands[102] to the legions as a symbol of  hospitality. Assuming an appearance of squalid misery, their envoys  made the round of the officers' quarters and the soldiers' tents  complaining of their own wrongs and of the rewards lavished on  neighbouring tribes. Finding the soldiers ready to listen, they made  inflammatory allusions to the army itself, its dangers and  humiliation. Mutiny was almost ripe, when Hordeonius Flaccus ordered  the envoys to withdraw, and, in order to secure the secrecy of their  departure, gave instructions to them to leave the camp by night. This  gave rise to an alarming rumour. Many declared that the envoys had  been killed, and that, if they did not look out for themselves, the  leading spirits among the soldiers, who had complained of the present  state of things, would be murdered in the dark, while their comrades  knew nothing about it. So the legions formed a secret compact. The  auxiliaries were also taken into the plot, although at first they had  been distrusted, because their infantry and cavalry had been posted in  camp all round the legion's quarters as though an attack on them were  meditated. However, they soon showed themselves the keener  conspirators. Disloyalty is a better bond for war than it ever proves  in peace.    In Lower Germany, however, the legions on the first of January          55  swore the usual oath of allegiance to Galba, though with much  hesitation. Few voices were heard even in the front ranks; the rest  were silent, each waiting for his neighbour to take some bold step.  Human nature is always ready to follow where it hates to lead.  However, the feelings of the legions varied. The First and Fifth[103]  were already mutinous enough to throw a few stones at Galba's statue.  The Fifteenth and Sixteenth[104] dared not venture beyond muttered  threats, but they were watching to see the outbreak begin. In Upper  Germany, on the other hand, on the very same day, the Fourth and the  Twenty-second legions, who were quartered together,[105] smashed their  statues of Galba to atoms. The Fourth took the lead, the  Twenty-second at first holding back, but eventually making common  cause with them. They did not want it to be thought that they were  shaking off their allegiance to the empire, so in taking the oath they  invoked the long obsolete names of the Senate and People of Rome. None  of the officers made any movement for Galba, and indeed some of them,  as happens in such outbreaks, headed the rebellion. However, nobody  made any kind of set speech or mounted the platform, for there was no  one as yet with whom to curry favour.    The ex-consul Hordeonius Flaccus stood by and watched their             56  treachery. He had not the courage to check the storm or even to rally  the waverers and encourage the faithful. Sluggish and cowardly, it was  mere indolence that kept him loyal. Four centurions of the  Twenty-second legion, Nonius Receptus, Donatius Valens, Romilius  Marcellus, and Calpurnius Repentinus, who tried to protect Galba's  statues, were swept away by the rush of the soldiers and put under  arrest. No one retained any respect for their former oath of  allegiance, or even remembered it; and, as happens in mutinies, they  were all on the side of the majority.    On the night of the first of January a standard-bearer of the Fourth  legion came to Cologne,[106] and brought the news to Vitellius at his  dinner that the Fourth and Twenty-second legions had broken down  Galba's statues and sworn allegiance to the Senate and People of Rome.  As this oath was meaningless, it seemed best to seize the critical  moment and offer them an emperor. Vitellius dispatched messengers to  inform his own troops and generals that the army of the Upper Province  had revolted from Galba; so they must either make war on the rebels  immediately, or, if they preferred peace and unity, make an emperor  for themselves; and there was less danger, he reminded them, in  choosing an emperor than in looking for one.    The quarters of the First legion were nearest at hand, and Fabius       57  Valens was the most enterprising of the generals. On the following day  he entered Cologne with the cavalry of his legion and auxiliaries, and  saluted Vitellius as emperor. The other legions of the province  followed suit, vying with each other in enthusiasm; and the army of  the Upper Province, dropping the fine-sounding titles of the Senate  and People of Rome, joined Vitellius on the third of January, which  clearly showed that on the two previous days they were not really at  the disposal of a republican government. The inhabitants of Cologne  and the Treviri and Lingones, rivalling the zeal of the troops, made  offers of assistance, or of horses or arms or money, each according to  the measure of their strength, wealth, or enterprise. And these  offers came not only from the civil and military authorities, men who  had plenty of money to spare and much to hope from victory, but whole  companies or individual soldiers handed over their savings, or,  instead of money, their belts, or the silver ornaments[107] on their  uniforms, some carried away by a wave of enthusiasm, some acting from  motives of self-interest.    Vitellius accordingly commended the zeal of the troops. He              58  distributed among Roman knights the court-offices which had been  usually held by freedmen,[108] paid the centurions their furlough-fees  out of the imperial purse,[109] and for the most part conceded the  soldiers' savage demands for one execution after another, though he  occasionally cheated them by pretending to imprison their victims.  Thus Pompeius Propinquus,[110] the imperial agent in Belgica, was  promptly executed, while Julius Burdo, who commanded the fleet on the  Rhine, was adroitly rescued. The indignation of the army had broken  out against him, because he was supposed to have intrigued against  Fonteius Capito, and to have accused him falsely.[111] Capito's memory  was dear to the army, and when violence reigns murder may show its  face, but pardon must be stealthy. So Burdo was kept in confinement  and only released after victory had allayed the soldiers' rancour.  Meanwhile a centurion, named Crispinus, was offered as a scape-goat.  He had actually stained his hands with Capito's blood, so his guilt  seemed more obvious to those who clamoured for his punishment, and  Vitellius felt he was a cheaper sacrifice.    Julius Civilis[112] was the next to be rescued from danger. He was      59  all-powerful among the Batavi,[113] and Vitellius did not want to  alienate so spirited a people by punishing him. Besides, eight cohorts  of Batavian troops were stationed among the Lingones. They had been an  auxiliary force attached to the Fourteenth, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1694"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: The First Thousand Years: 600 - 1600 (#11)"],[1,"of birth, or residence, such as Field, Pitt,  Lane, Bridge, Ford, Stone, Burn, Church, Hill, Brook, Green.  Other names came from occupations such as Shepherd, Carter,  Parker, Fowler, Hunter, Forester, Smith. Still other came from  personal characteristics such as Black, Brown, and White, Short,  Round, and Long. Some took their names from animals such as  Wolf, Fox, Lamb, Bull, Hogg, Sparrow, Crow, and Swan. Others  were called after the men they served, such as King, Bishop,  Abbot, Prior, Knight. A man's surname was passed on to his son.    The Normans washed their hands before and after meals and ate  with their fingers. Feasts were stately occasions with costly  tables and splendid apparel. There were practical jokes,  innocent frolics, and witty verbal debating with repartee.    Those few coerls whose land was not taken by a baron remained  free and held their land \"in socage\" and became known as  sokemen.    Great stone cathedrals were built in fortified towns for  William's Norman bishops, who replaced the English bishops. Most  of the existing and new monasteries functioned as training  grounds for scholars, bishops, and statesmen rather than as  retreats from the world's problems to the security of religious  observance. The number of monks grew as the best minds were  recruited into the monasteries.    William made the church subordinate to him. Bishops were elected  only subject to the King's consent. Homage was exacted from  them. William imposed knight's service on bishoprics, abbeys,  and monasteries, which was commuted to a monetary amount.  Bishops had to attend the King's court. Bishops could not leave  the realm without the King's consent. No royal tenant or royal  servant could be excommunicated, nor his lands be placed under  interdict, without the King's consent. Interdict could demand,  for instance, that the church be closed and the dead buried in  unconsecrated ground. No church rules could be made without his  agreement to their terms. No letters from the Pope could be  received without the King's permission.    Men continued to give land to the church for their souls, such as  this grant which started the town of Sandwich: \"William, King of  the English, to Lanfranc the Archbishop and Hugoni de Montfort  and Richard son of Earl Gilbert and Haimo the sheriff and all the  thegns of Kent, French and English, greeting. Know ye that the  Bishop of Bayeux my brother for the love of God and for the  salvation of my soul and his own, has given to St. Trinity all  houses with their appurtances which he has at Sandwich and that  he has given what he has given by my license.\"    When the land was all divided out, the barons had about 3/7 of it  and the church 2/7. The King retained 2/7, including forests for  hunting, for himself and his household, on which he built many  royal castles and hundreds of manor houses throughout the  nation. He built the White Tower in London. He and his household  slept on the upper floors and there was a chapel on the second  floor and a dungeon below the first floor for prisoners. The  other castles were often built at the old fortification burhs of  Alfred. Barons and earls had castle-guard duty in them. William  was constantly moving about the land from castle to castle,  where he entertained his magnates and conducted public business,  such as deciding disputes about holding of land. Near these  castles and other of his property, he designated many areas as  royal hunting forests. Anyone who killed a deer in these forests  was mutilated, for instance by blinding. People living within  the boundaries of the designated forestland could no longer go  into nearby woods to get meat or honey, dead wood for firing, or  live wood for building. Swineherds could no longer drive pigs  into these woods to eat acorns they beat down from oak trees.  Making clearings and grazing livestock in the designated  forestland were prohibited. Most of the nation was either wooded  or bog at this time.    London was a walled town of one and two story houses made of mud,  twigs, and straw, with thatched roofs. There were churches, a  goods market, a fish market, quays on the river, and a bridge  over the river. Streets probably named by this time include  Bread Street, Milk Street, Honey Lane, Wood Street, and  Ironmonger Lane. Fairs and games were held outside the town  walls in a field called \"Smithfield\". The freemen were a small  percentage of London's population. There was a butchers' guild,  a pepperers' guild, a goldsmiths' guild, the guild of St.  Lazarus, which was probably a leper charity, the Pilgrims' guild,  which helped people going on pilgrimages, and four bridge  guilds, probably for keeping the wooden London Bridge in repair.  Men told the time by sundials, some of which were portable and  could be carried in one's pocket. London could defend itself,  and a ringing of the bell of St. Paul's Church could shut every  shop and fill the streets with armed horsemen and soldiers led  by a soldier port-reeve.    William did not interfere with landholding in London, but  recognized it's independence as a borough in this writ:  \"William the King greets William, Bishop of London, and Gosfrith  the portreeve, and all the burgesses of London friendly. Know  that I will that you be worthy of all the laws you were worthy  of in the time of King Edward. And I will that every child shall  be his father's heir after his father's day. And I will not  suffer any man to do you wrong. God preserve you.\"    So London was not subjected to the Norman feudal system. It had  neither villeins nor slaves. Whenever Kings asserted authority  over it, the citizens reacted until the King \"granted\" a charter  reaffirming the freedoms of the city and its independence.    William's reign was a time of tentative expedients and simple  solutions. He administered by issuing writs with commands or  prohibitions. These were read aloud by the sheriffs in the  county courts and other locations. Administration was by the  personal servants of his royal household, such as the  Chancellor, steward, butler, chamberlain, and constable. The  constable was in charge of the knights of the royal household.  Under pressure from the ecclesiastical judges, William replaced  the death penalty by that of the mutilation of blinding,  chopping off hands, and castrating offenders. Castration was the  punishment for rape. But these mutilations usually led to a slow  death by gangrene.    The Normans used the Anglo-Saxon concepts of jurisdictional  powers. Thus when William confirmed \"customs\" to the abbot of  Ely, these were understood to include the following: 1) sac and  soke - the right to hold a court of private jurisdiction and  enjoy its profits, 2) toll - a payment in towns, markets, and  fairs for goods and chattel bought and sold, 3) team - persons  might be vouched to warranty in the court, the grant of which  made a court capable of hearing suits arising from the transfer  of land, 4) infangenthef - right of trying and executing thieves  on one's land, 4) hamsocne, 5) grithbrice - violation of the  grantees' special peace, for instance that of the sheriff, 6)  fihtwite - fine for a general breach of the peace, 7) fyrdwite -  fine for failure to appear in the fyrd [national militia].    Every shire had at least one burh, or defensible town. Kings had  appointed a royal moneyer in each to mint silver coins for local  use. On one side was the King's head in profile and on the other  side was the name of the moneyer. When a new coinage was issued,  all moneyers had to go to London to get the new dies. William's  head faced frontally on his dies, instead of the usual profile  used by former Kings.    William held and presided over his council three times a year, as  was the custom, at Easter, Christmas, and Whitsuntide. This was  an advisory council and consisted of earls, greater barons,  officers of the King's household, archbishops, and bishops. It's  functions were largely ceremonial. William's will was the motive  force which under lay all its action. When it was administering  royal justice, it was called the Royal Court. The justiciar was  the head of all legal matters and represented the King in his  absence from the realm. The Treasurer was responsible for the  collection and distribution of revenue. The Chancellor headed  the Chancery and the chapel.    Sheriffs became powerful figures as the primary agents for  enforcing royal edicts. They collected the royal taxes, executed  royal justice, and presided over and controlled the hundred and  shire courts. They also took part in the keeping of castles and  often managed the estates of the King. Most royal writs were  addressed to the sheriff and shire courts. They also led the  shire militia in time of war or rebellion.    Royal income came from customary dues, profits of coinage and of  justice, and revenues from the King's own estates. For war, a  man with five hides of land was required to furnish one  heavy-armed horseman for forty days service in a year. A threat  of a Viking invasion caused William to reinstitute the danegeld  tax. To impose this uniformly, he sent commissioners to conduct  surveys by sworn verdicts of appointed groups of local men. A  detailed survey of land holdings and the productive worth of  each was made in 1086. The English called it the \"Doomsday Book\"  because there was no appeal from it.    The survey revealed, for instance, that one estate had \"on the  home farm five plough teams: there are also 25 villeins and 6  cotters with 14 teams among them. There is a mill worth 2s. a  year and one fishery, a church and four acres of meadow, wood  for 150 pigs and two stone quarries, each worth 2s. a year, and  two nests of hawks in the wood and 10 slaves.\" This estate was  deemed to be worth 480s. a year.
