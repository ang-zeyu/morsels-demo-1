The Indians had nothing  left but two little necks of land, which were nearly surrounded by  the waters of Narragansett Bay. Here they felt that they were shut  up almost like prisoners, and that the white men watched everything  that they did.      89. How King Philip felt; signs of the coming war; the \"Praying  Indians\"; the murder.--King Philip was a very proud man--quite as  proud, in fact, as the king of England. He could not bear to see his  people losing power. He said to himself, if the Indians do not rise  and drive out the white men, then the white men will certainly drive  out the Indians. Most of the Indians now had guns, and could use them  quite as well as the whites could; so Philip thought that it was best  to fight.    The settlers felt that the war was coming. Some of them fancied that  they saw the figure of an Indian bow in the clouds. Others said that  they heard sounds like guns fired off in the air, and horsemen riding  furiously up and down in the sky, as if getting ready for battle.    But though many Indians now hated the white settlers, this was not  true of all. A minister, named John Eliot, had persuaded some of the  red men near Boston to give up their religion, and to try to live  like the white people. These were called \"Praying Indians.\" One of  them who knew King Philip well told the settlers that Philip's  warriors were grinding their hatchets sharp for war. Soon after, this  \"Praying Indian\" was found murdered. The white people accused three  of Philip's men of having killed him. They were tried, found guilty,  and hanged.      90. Beginning of the war at Swansea;[3] burning of Brookfield.--Then  Philip's warriors began the war in the summer of 1675. Some white  settlers were going home from church in the town of Swansea,  Massachusetts; they had been to pray that there might be no fighting.  As they walked along, talking together, two guns were fired out of  the bushes. One of the white men fell dead in the road, and another  was badly hurt.    [Illustration: Map of Massachusetts and Rhode Island.]    The shots were fired by Indians. This was the way they always fought  when they could. They were not cowards, but they did not come out  boldly, but would fire from behind trees and rocks. Often a white  man would be killed without even seeing who shot him.    At first the fighting was mainly in those villages of Plymouth Colony  which were nearest Narragansett Bay; then it spread to the valley  of the Connecticut River and the neighborhood. Deerfield,  Springfield, Brookfield,[4] Groton,[5] and many other places in  Massachusetts were attacked. The Indians would creep up stealthily  in the night, burn the houses, carry off the women and children  prisoners if they could, kill the rest of the inhabitants, take their  scalps home and hang them up in their wigwams.    [Illustration: AN ATTACKING INDIAN.]    At Brookfield the settlers left their houses, and gathered in one  strong house for defence. The Indians burned all the houses but that  one, and did their best to burn that, too. They dipped rags in  brimstone, such as we make matches of, fastened them to the points  of their arrows, set fire to them, and then shot the blazing arrows  into the shingles of the roof. When the Indians saw that the shingles  had caught, and were beginning to flame up, they danced for joy, and  roared like wild bulls. But the men in the house managed to put out  the fire on the roof. Then the savages got a cart, filled it with  hay, set it on fire, and pushed it up against the house. This time  they thought that they should certainly burn the white people out;  but just then a heavy shower came up, and put out the fire. A little  later, some white soldiers marched into the village, and saved the  people in the house.    [Footnote 3: Swansea (Swon'ze).]    [Footnote 4: See map in this paragraph.]    [Footnote 5: Groton (Graw'ton).]      91. The fight at Hadley; what Colonel[6] Goffe[7] did.--At Hadley,  the people were in the meeting-house when the terrible Indian  war-whoop[8] rang through the village. The savages drove back those  who dared to go out against them, and it seemed as if the village  must be destroyed. Suddenly a white-haired old man, sword in hand,  appeared among the settlers. No one knew who he was; but he called  to them to follow him, as a captain calls to his men, and they obeyed  him. The astonished Indians turned and ran. When, after all was over,  the whites looked for their brave leader, he had gone; they never  saw him again. Many thought that he was an angel who had been sent  to save them. But the angel was Colonel Goffe, an Englishman, who  was one of the judges who had sentenced King Charles the First to  death during a great war in England. He had escaped to America; and,  luckily for the people of Hadley, he was hiding in the house of a  friend in that village when the Indians attacked it.    [Illustration: INDIAN ATTACK ON A SETTLEMENT. The building on the  right is a block-house, or fort made of hewn logs.

How a woman drove off an Indian.--In this dreadful war with the  savages there were times when even the women had to fight for their  lives. In one case, a woman had been left in a house with two young  children. She heard a noise at the window, and looking up, saw an  Indian trying to raise the sash. Quick as thought, she clapped the  two little children under two large brass kettles which stood near.  Then, seizing a shovel-full of red-hot coals from the open fire, she  stood ready, and just as the Indian thrust his head into the room,  she dashed the coals right into his face and eyes. With a yell of  agony the Indian let go his hold, dropped to the ground as though  he had been shot, and ran howling to the woods.    [Illustration: WOMAN THROWING COALS.]      93. The great swamp fight; burning the Indian wigwams; what the Chief  Canonchet[9] said.--During the summer and autumn of 1675 the Indians  on the west side of Narragansett Bay[10]took no open part in King  Philip's War. But the next winter the white people found that these  Indians were secretly receiving and sheltering the savages who had  been wounded in fighting for that noted chief. For that reason, the  settlers determined to raise a large force and attack them. The  Indians had gathered in a fort on an island in a swamp. This fort  was a very difficult place to reach. It was built of the trunks of  trees set upright in the ground. It was so strong that the savages  felt quite safe.    Starting very early in the morning, the attacking party waded fifteen  miles through deep snow. Many of them had their hands and feet badly  frozen. One of the chief men in leading the attack was Captain  Benjamin Church of Plymouth; he was a very brave soldier, and knew  all about Indian life and Indian fighting. In the battle, he was  struck by two bullets, and so badly wounded that he could not move  a step further; but he made one of his men hold him up, and he shouted  to his soldiers to go ahead. The fight was a desperate one, but at  length the fort was taken. The attacking party lost more than two  hundred and fifty men in killed and wounded; the Indians lost as many  as a thousand.    After the battle was over, Captain Church begged the men not to burn  the wigwams inside the fort, for there were a great number of old  men and women and little Indian children in the wigwams. But the men  were very mad against the savages, and would not listen to him. They  set the wigwams on fire, and burned many of these poor creatures to  death.    Canonchet, the chief of the tribe, was taken prisoner. The settlers  told him they would spare his life if he would try to make peace.  \"No,\" said he, \"we will all fight to the last man rather than become  slaves to the white men.\" He was then told that he must be shot. \"I  like it well,\" said he. \"I wish to die before my heart becomes soft,  or I say anything unworthy of myself.\"    [Footnote 9: Canonchet (Ka-non'chet).]    [Footnote 10: See map in paragraph 90.]      94. Philip's wife and son are taken prisoners; Philip is shot; end  of the war.--The next summer Captain Church, with a lot of \"brisk  Bridgewater lads\" chased King Philip and his men, and took many of  the Indians prisoners. Among those then taken captive were King  Philip's wife and his little boy. When Philip heard of it, he cried  out, \"My heart breaks; now I am ready to die.\" He had good reason  for saying so. It was the custom in England to sell such prisoners  of war as slaves. Following this custom, the settlers here took this  boy, the grandson of that Massasoit[11] who had helped them when they  were poor and weak, and sold him with his mother. They were sent to  the Bermuda Islands,[12] and there worked to death under the hot sun  and the lash of the slave-driver's whip.    Not long after that, King Philip himself was shot. He had been hunted  like a wild beast from place to place. At last he had come back to  see his old home at Mount Hope[13] once more. There Captain Church  found him; there the Indian warrior was shot. His head and hands were  cut off,--as was then done in England in such cases,--and his head  was carried to Plymouth and set up on a pole. It stood there twenty  years.    King Philip's death brought the war to an end. It had lasted a little  over a year; that is, from the early summer of 1675 to the latter  part of the summer of 1676. In that short time the Indians had killed  between five and six hundred white settlers, and had "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18134"],[0,"Sixteen Months in Four German Prisons: Wesel, Sennelager, Klingelputz, Ruhleben (#11)"],[1,"be more than ever on my  guard. To my mind, which was becoming distracted, everyone appeared to  be spying upon my actions. The mysterious prisoner looked across the  corridor and saw me. Instantly his fingers commenced to move rapidly. I  was talking to the gaoler, but was looking beyond him at the prisoner  opposite, greedily taking in the signs. I almost jumped as I read off  the letters. \"Be alert! Something is going to happen!\"          CHAPTER IV    MY SECRET MIDNIGHT TRIAL      It was Wednesday evening. I should judge the hour was about eight,  although to me it appeared to be nearer midnight. I was lying upon my  planks thinking and wondering what the end of it would be. My head was  whirling with giddiness from the eternal pacing, and from the wound  which I had received, while I was faint from hunger, having eaten  nothing since the lunch on the train on Monday, save for the two small  rolls upon Wesel station. I had not refused the prison fare from  feelings of obstinacy, but simply because my stomach revolted at it. The  untouched basins were still standing beside me in a row, the one which  had been served first now commencing to emit distinct signs of its  staleness.    The door opened, but I ignored it. In fact I was in a semi-comatose  condition.    \"Rouse! Get up!\" growled the head gaoler.    I struggled to a sitting posture and looked up. Standing beside me was a  military officer. I could not repress a start. But the absence of  arrogance somewhat reassured me, and I struggled to my feet.    \"Herr Mahoney,\" he commenced, \"a serious view has been taken of your  case. However, as you have money the authorities are prepared to give  you every chance to prove your innocence. You can have counsel if you  choose. I can arrange it at once!\"    I reflected for a moment. The crisis had been reached at last, and the  moment for which I had been longing for bracing myself up to meet the  supreme ordeal had arrived. I decided to maintain a stiff upper lip.  Yet, in all fairness I must admit that the authorities were treating me  justly. Here was I, an absolute stranger in their country, ignorant of  the language beyond a few colloquialisms, and in the most dangerous  situation in which a man could possibly find himself.    Yet I did not regard the offer favourably. I feared that it was a move  to trap me decisively. I should be at the mercy of counsel. This was the  thought which harassed me. However, subsequently, I discovered that  throughout that Wednesday the trials of other spies had been held, and  that in no other instance, so far as I could ascertain, had the  privilege of representation by counsel been extended. But I swiftly made  up my mind as to my course of action.    \"Thank you for the offer,\" I retorted at last, \"but I prefer to  undertake my own defence. Besides I am absolutely innocent and it will  not be a difficult matter for me to convince the Court.\"    \"As you will,\" and the officer shrugged his shoulders.    He went to the door, and at his command four soldiers came up with  loaded rifles. They closed around me, their bayonets levelled, to run me  through should I make an attempt to escape. We marched out of the cell.  Up, up, up, we went, the steps appearing to be interminable. I walked as  if in a dream, and being faint and weary I moved somewhat slowly. But,  strange to say, my escort did not hurry me. I was certainly shown every  consideration upon this occasion. During the procession I was thinking  hard and swiftly, and with a superhuman effort pulled myself together  for the coming fight for life.    We entered a spacious, well-lighted room. At the opposite end was a long  table set transversely, around three sides of which were seated a number  of military dignitaries. That they were of considerable eminence was  evident from their prodigal array of decorations. They glanced at me as  I entered, but instantly resumed their low conversation and perusal of  documents and other material connected with my case. It did not require  a second thought to realise the importance of this court-martial, but I  felt somewhat perturbed at one circumstance.    _My trial was to be held in secret._    I was made to take up a position some distance from the table and  immediately opposite the central figure who was acting as chairman and  inquisitor-in-chief. The soldiers formed a semi-circle around me, the  only open space being immediately before me.    At this date I often reflect upon the strange and sorry sight I must  have presented. I was dressed in a frock coat which was sadly soiled, a  white waistcoat extremely dirty and blood-stained, and trousers sadly  frayed at the bottom where the searchers had ripped off the turn-ups. I  was without a shirt, having torn this up to bandage my head, which even  now was swathed in a dirty, blood-stained dressing, while the buttons  had become detached from my under-vest so that the soiled ends flapped  over my waistcoat. My face was none too clean, being besmirched with  smudges, since I had been denied the luxuries of soap and towel, and it  was covered with a stubbly growth. Altogether I must have been the most  sorry-looking, if not revolting specimen of a spy ever arraigned before  that immaculate Tribunal.    It is useless to relate the trial in extenso because there were so many  details which were completely void of interest except to me and my  judges. Although every word, passage, and scene is burned into my brain  I have only committed the most important episodes to paper. The  proceedings opened with the chairman holding forth in monotone German.  Seeing that I took no notice of his tirade he paused. We were soon to  come to grips. He fired at me in English:    \"You understand German?\"    \"No!\"    \"Well, we think you do!\"    \"You are at liberty to think what you like, but the fact remains that I  don't!\"    Seeing that I was not to be over-awed by his arrogance or to be  brow-beaten he modified his attitude. This spirited bout sobered the  tribunal, and the trial proceeded more smoothly, except for a few  outbursts now and again which were sharp and pointed while they lasted.    \"Well, we will provide you with an interpreter,\" he continued in a more  placid tone, \"but we still hold the opinion that you can speak and  understand German!\"    There was delay for a few minutes. Then the door opened and a second  later my interpreter stood beside me. How it was I did not jump into the  air I do not know, because the man summoned to assist me was none other  than the mysterious prisoner with whom I had been talking in the mute  alphabet.    This _denouement_ almost unnerved me. I was now more positive than ever  that he had been deputed to spy upon me in prison. I looked at him  askance, but received not the slightest sign of recognition. I had  refused to entrust my cause to counsel and now I was placed in the hands  of an interpreter who, if he so desired, could wreak much more damage by  twisting the translations from English to suit his own ends.    As events proved, however, I could not have been in better hands. He was  highly intelligent, and he interpreted my statements with a fluency and  accuracy which were astonishing. Only now and again did he stumble and  hesitate. This was when he was presented with an unfamiliar expression  or idiomatic sentence.    As the trial proceeded I gained an interesting side-light upon German  methods and the mutual distrust which exists. Ostensibly, and so I was  led to believe, none of the Tribunal spoke English with any fluency, but  when, on one occasion, my interpreter was floored by a particularly  difficult colloquialism which I uttered, the Clerk of the Court came to  his aid, and in a moment turned the sentence properly to convey my  exact meaning. This revelation placed me on my guard more than ever,  because it was brought home to me very convincingly that if my  interpreter tended to lean unduly towards me, he himself would be in  serious jeopardy. Later, during the trial, I discovered that the Clerk  spoke and understood English as well as I did. It was a telling  illustration of the German practice of spying upon one another.    The first part of the trial was taken up with a repetition of the  numerous questions I had already answered times out of number,  accompanied by a more searching cross-examination. As the trial  proceeded I saw that the authorities had collected every vestige of  evidence from every official who had questioned me and with whom I had  held any conversation.    There was one exciting moment. An officer, evidently of high rank,  entered the room. He looked at me in a manner which I resented. With a  sneering grin he enquired,    \"Englander? Ha! Ha! Spion? What are you doing here?\"    \"I have come at the pressing invitation of four gentlemen with four  points!\" I suavely replied.    This sly allusion to the four soldiers with their bayonets lashed the  interrupting officer to fury. The whole court indulged in a wild and  loud conversation. The chairman waved his arm wildly. Before I grasped  what had happened the soldiers closed round me, I was roughly turned  round, and to the accompaniment of liberal buffeting was hustled down  the steps to my cell.    A few minutes later my interpreter came to me.    \"Listen to me, English friend. You must not annoy the Court. I am trying  to do all I can for you. I do not think you guilty. But if you are--what  do you call it--h'm----\" and he snapped his fingers perplexedly.    \"Sarcastic?\" I ventured.    \"Yes! That's it. If you are sarcastic you make my work very hard!\"    \"But that officer had nothing to do with the Court, had he? Why did he  interfere with a gratuitous insult?\"    \"Ah! I see. You don't understand. They will do that. But you must  remember the uniform!\"    Further conversation was prevented by the reappearance of the soldiers.  I was to be taken back to the Court. I decided to take my interpreter's"]]]
