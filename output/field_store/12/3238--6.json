I should  like to learn how to play too.\"    \"That is soon done,\" said the musician, \"only you must do whatever I  tell you.\"    \"O musician,\" answered the hare, \"I will obey you, as a scholar his  master.\"    So they went a part of the way together, until they came to a clear  place in the wood where there stood an aspen tree. The musician tied a  long string round the neck of the hare, and knotted the other end of it  to the tree.    \"Now then, courage, little hare! run twenty times round the tree!\" cried  the musician, and the hare obeyed: as he ran round the twentieth time  the string had wound twenty times round the tree trunk and the hare was  imprisoned, and pull and tug as he would he only cut his tender neck  with the string. \"Wait there until I come back again,\" said the  musician, and walked on.    The wolf meanwhile had struggled, and pulled, and bitten, at the stone,  and worked away so long, that at last he made his paws free and got  himself out of the cleft. Full of anger and fury he hastened after the  musician to tear him to pieces. When the fox saw him run by he began  groaning, and cried out with all his might,    \"Brother wolf, come and help me! the musician has betrayed me.\" The wolf  then pulled the branches down, bit the knots in two, and set the fox  free, and he went with him to take vengeance on the musician. They found  the imprisoned hare, and set him likewise free, and then they all went  on together to seek their enemy.    The musician had once more played his fiddle, and this time he had been  more fortunate. The sound had reached the ears of a poor woodcutter, who  immediately, and in spite of himself, left his work, and, with his axe  under his arm, came to listen to the music.    \"At last here comes the right sort of companion,\" said the musician; \"it  was a man I wanted, and not wild animals.\" And then he began to play so  sweetly that the poor man stood as if enchanted, and his heart was  filled with joy. And as he was standing there up came the wolf, the fox,  and the hare, and he could easily see that they meant mischief. Then he  raised his shining axe, and stood in front of the musician, as if to  say,    \"Whoever means harm to him had better take care of himself, for he will  have to do with me!\"    Then the animals were frightened, and ran back into the wood, and the  musician, when he had played once more to the man to show his gratitude,  went on his way.          THE TWELVE BROTHERS      ONCE upon a time there lived a King and Queen very peacefully together;  they had twelve children, all boys. Now the King said to the Queen one  day,    \"If our thirteenth child should be a girl the twelve boys shall die, so  that her riches may be the greater, and the kingdom fall to her alone.\"    Then he caused twelve coffins to be made; and they were filled with  shavings, and a little pillow laid in each, and they were brought and  put in a locked-up room; and the King gave the key to the Queen, and  told her to say nothing about it to any one.    But the mother sat the whole day sorrowing, so that her youngest son,  who never left her, and to whom she had given the Bible name Benjamin,  said to her,    \"Dear mother, why are you so sad?\"    \"Dearest child,\" answered she, \"I dare not tell you.\"    But he let her have no peace until she went and unlocked the room, and  showed him the twelve coffins with the shavings and the little pillows.  Then she said,    \"My dear Benjamin, your father has caused these coffins to be made for  you and your eleven brothers, and if I bring a little girl into the  world you are all to be put to death together and buried therein.\" And  she wept as she spoke, and her little son comforted her and said,    \"Weep not, dear mother, we will save ourselves and go far away.\" Then  she answered,    \"Yes, go with your eleven brothers out into the world, and let one of  you always sit on the top of the highest tree that can be found, and  keep watch upon the tower of this castle. If a little son is born I will  put out a white flag, and then you may safely venture back again; but if  it is a little daughter I will put out a red flag, and then flee away as  fast as you can, and the dear God watch over you. Every night will I  arise and pray for you--in winter that you may have a fire to warm  yourselves by, and in summer that you may not languish in the heat.\"    After that, when she had given her sons her blessing, they went away out  into the wood. One after another kept watch, sitting on the highest oak  tree, looking towards the tower. When eleven days had passed, and  Benjamin's turn came, he saw a flag put out, but it was not white, but  blood red, to warn them that they were to die. When the brothers knew  this they became angry, saying,    \"Shall we suffer death because of a girl! we swear to be revenged;  wherever we find a girl we will shed her blood.\"    Then they went deeper into the wood; and in the middle, where it was  darkest, they found a little enchanted house, standing empty. Then they  said,    \"Here will we dwell; and you, Benjamin, the youngest and weakest, shall  stay at home and keep house; we others will go abroad and purvey food.\"    Then they went into the wood and caught hares, wild roes, birds, and  pigeons, and whatever else is good to eat, and brought them to Benjamin  for him to cook and make ready to satisfy their hunger. So they lived  together in the little house for ten years, and the time did not seem  long.    By this time the Queen's little daughter was growing up, she had a kind  heart and a beautiful face, and a golden star on her forehead. Once when  there was a great wash she saw among the clothes twelve shirts, and she  asked her mother,    \"Whose are these twelve shirts? they are too small to be my father's.\"  Then the mother answered with a sore heart,    \"Dear child, they belong to your twelve brothers.\" The little girl said,    \"Where are my twelve brothers? I have never heard of them.\" And her  mother answered,    \"God only knows where they are wandering about in the world.\" Then she  led the little girl to the secret room and unlocked it, and showed her  the twelve coffins with the shavings and the little pillows.    \"These coffins,\" said she, \"were intended for your twelve brothers, but  they went away far from home when you were born,\" and she related how  everything had come to pass. Then said the little girl,    \"Dear mother, do not weep, I will go and seek my brothers.\"    So she took the twelve shirts and went far and wide in the great forest.  The day sped on, and in the evening she came to the enchanted house. She  went in and found a youth, who asked,    \"Whence do you come, and what do you want?\" and he marvelled at her  beauty, her royal garments, and the star on her forehead. Then she  answered,    \"I am a king's daughter, and I seek my twelve brothers, and I will go  everywhere under the blue sky until I find them.\" And she showed him the  twelve shirts which belonged to them. Then Benjamin saw that it must be  his sister, and said,    \"I am Benjamin, your youngest brother.\"    And she began weeping for joy, and Benjamin also, and they kissed and  cheered each other with great love. After a while he said,    \"Dear sister, there is still a hindrance; we have sworn that any maiden  that we meet must die, as it was because of a maiden that we had to  leave our kingdom.\" Then she said,    \"I will willingly die, if so I may benefit my twelve brothers.\"    \"No,\" answered he, \"you shall not die; sit down under this tub until the  eleven brothers come, and I agree with them about it.\" She did so; and  as night came on they returned from hunting, and supper was ready. And  as they were sitting at table and eating, they asked,    \"What news?\" And Benjamin said,    \"Don't you know any?\"    \"No,\" answered they. So he said,    \"You have been in the wood, and I have stayed at home, and yet I know  more than you.\"    \"Tell us!\" cried they. He answered,    \"Promise me that the first maiden we see shall not be put to death.\"    \"Yes, we promise,\" cried they all, \"she shall have mercy; tell us now.\"  Then he said,    \"Our sister is here,\" and lifted up the tub, and the king's daughter  came forth in her royal garments with her golden star on her forehead,  and she seemed so beautiful, delicate, and sweet, that they all  rejoiced, and fell on her neck and kissed her, and loved her with all  their hearts.    After this she remained with Benjamin in the house and helped him with  the work. The others went forth into the woods to catch wild animals,  does, birds, and pigeons, for food for them all, and their sister and  Benjamin took care that all was made ready for them. She fetched the  wood for cooking, and the vegetables, and watched the pots on the fire,  so that supper was always ready when the others came in. She kept also  great order in the house, and the beds were always beautifully white and  clean, and the brothers were contented, and lived in unity.    One day the two got ready a fine feast, and when they were all assembled  they sat down and ate and drank, and were full of joy. Now there was a  little garden belonging to the enchanted house, in which grew twelve  lilies; the maiden, thinking to please her brothers, went out to gather  the twelve flowers, meaning to give one to each as they sat at meat. But  as she broke off the flowers, in the same moment the brothers were  changed into twelve ravens, and flew over the wood far away, and the  house with the garden also disappeared. So the poor maiden stood alone  in the wild wood, and as she was looking around her she saw an old woman  standing by her, who said,    \"My child, what hast thou done! why couldst thou not leave the twelve  flowers standing? they were thy twelve brothers, who are now changed to  ravens for ever.\" The maiden said, weeping,    \"Is there no means of setting them free?\"    \"No,\" said the old woman, \"there is in the whole world "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19090"],[0,"Star Hunter (#11)"],[1,",  into odorous ash. The backlash of that blast must have caught the  majority of the lights also. For when Rynch and Hume cautiously sat  up, they saw only a handful of widely scattered and dulling globes  below.    They choked, coughed, rubbed watering eyes as the fumes from the  scorched rocks wreathed up about their perch.    \"Flitter with life line--above you!\"    That voice had come out of what should have been empty air over their  heads. A gangling line trailed across their bodies, a line with a  safety belt locked to it, and a second was uncoiling in a slow loop as  they watched.    In unison they grabbed for those means of escape, buckled the belts  about them.    \"Haul away!\" Hume called. The lines tightened, their bodies swung up  clear of the blasted river island, as their unseen transport headed  for the eastern shore.          8      A subdued but steady light all around him issued from stark gray  walls. He lay on his back in an empty cell-room. And he'd better be on  the move before Darfu comes to enforce a rising order with a powerful  kick or one of these backhanded blows which the Salarkian used to  reduce most humans to helpless obedience.    Vye blinked again. But this wasn't his cubby hole at the Starfall, his  nose as well as his eyes told him that. There was no hint of  uncleanliness or corruption here. He sat up stiffly, looked down at  his own body in dull wonder. The only covering on his bare, brown self  was a wide, scaled belt and a loin cloth. Clumsy sandals shod his  feet, and his legs, up to thigh level, were striped with healing  scratches and blotched with bruises.    Painfully, with mental processes as stiff as his arms and his legs, he  tried to think back. Sluggishly, memory associated one picture with  another.    Last night--or yesterday--Rynch Brodie had been locked in here. And  \"here\" was one of the storage compartments of a spacer belonging to a  man named Wass. It had been Wass' pilot in the flitter which snaked  them from the river islet where the monsters had besieged them.    This was a concealed, fortified camp--Wass' hideout. And he was a  prisoner with a very uncertain future, depending upon the will of the  Veep and a man named Hume.    Hume, the Out-Hunter, had shown no surprise when Wass stood up in the  lamplight to greet the rescued. \"I see you have been hunting.\" His  eyes had moved from Hume to Rynch and back again.    \"Yes--but that does not matter!\" the Hunter had returned impatiently.    \"No? Then what does?\"    \"This is not a free world, I have to report that. Get my civs off  planet before something happens to them!\"    \"I thought all safari worlds were certified as free,\" Wass countered.    \"This one isn't. I don't know how or why. But that fact has to be  reported and the civs lifted--\"    \"Not so fast.\" Wass' voice had been quiet, almost gentle. \"Such a  report would interest the Patrol, would it not?\"    \"Of course--\" Hume began and then stopped abruptly.    Wass smiled. \"You see--complications already. I do not wish to explain  anything to the Patrol. Nor do you either, my young friend, not when  you stop to think about what might result from such explanations.\"    \"There wouldn't have been any trouble if you'd kept away from Jumala.\"  Hume's control had returned; both voice and manner were under tight  rein. \"Weren't Rovald's reports explicit enough to satisfy you?\"    \"I have risked a great deal on this project,\" Wass replied. \"Also, it  is well from time to time for a Veep to check upon his field  operatives. Men do not grow careless when personal supervision is ever  in mind. And it is well that I did arrive here, is it not, Hunter? Or  would you have preferred remaining on that island? Whether any of our  project may be salvaged is a point we must consider. But for the  moment we make no moves. No, Hume, your civs will have to take their  chances for a time.\"    \"And if there is trouble?\" Hume challenged him. \"A report of an alien  attack will bring in the Patrol quickly enough.\"    \"You forget Rovald,\" Wass corrected. \"The chance that one of your civs  can activate and transmit from the spacer is remote, and Rovald will  see that it is impossible. You have picked up Brodie, I see.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"No!\" What had possessed him at that moment to contradict? He had  realized the folly of his outburst the moment Wass had looked at him.    \"This becomes more interesting,\" the Veep had remarked with that  deceptive gentleness. \"You are Rynch Brodie, castaway from the Largo  Drift, are you not? I trust that Out-Hunter Hume has made plain to you  our concern with your welfare, Gentlehomo Brodie.\"    \"I'm not Brodie.\" Having taken the leap into the dangerous truth he  was stubborn enough to continue swimming.    \"I find this enlightening indeed. If you are not Brodie--then who are  you?\"    That had been it. At that moment he couldn't have told Wass who he  was, explain that his patchwork of memories had gaping holes.    \"And you, Out-Hunter,\" Wass' reptilian regard had moved again to Hume,  \"perhaps you have an adequate explanation for this discovery.\"    \"None of his doing,\" he burst out, \"I remembered--\"    Some inexplicable emotion made Rynch defend Hume then.    Hume laughed, and there was a reckless edge to that sound. \"Yes, Wass,  your techs are not as good as they pretend to be. He didn't follow the  pattern of action they set for him.\"    \"A pity. But there are always errors when one deals with the human  factor. Peake!\" One of the other three men moved towards them. \"You  will escort this young man to the spacer, see him safely stowed for  the present. Yes, a pity. Now we must see just how much can be  salvaged.\"    Then Vye had been brought into the shop, supplied with a ration  container, and left to himself within this bare-walled cabin to  meditate upon the folly of talking too freely. Why had he been so  utterly stupid? Veeps of Wass' calibre did not swim through the murky  channels of the Starfall, but their general breed had smaller but just  as vicious representatives there, and he knew the man for what he was,  ruthless, powerful and thorough.    A sound, slight, but easily heard in the silent vacuum of the storage  cabin, alerted him. The crack of the sliding panel door opened and Vye  crouched, his hand cupping the only possible weapon, the ration  container. Hume edged through, shut the door behind him. He stood  there, his head turned so his ear rested against the wall; obviously  he was listening.    \"You brain-smoothed idiot!\" The Hunter's voice was a thread of  whisper. \"Why couldn't you have kept that swinging jaw of yours closed  last night? Now listen and listen good. This is a slim try, but it's  one we have to take.\"    \"We?\" Vye was startled into asking.    \"Yes, we! By rights I ought to leave you right here to do the rest of  your big, brave speechmaking for Wass' benefit. If I didn't need you,  that's just what I would do! If it weren't for those civs--\" His head  snapped back, cheek to panel, he was listening again. After a long  moment his whisper came once more. \"I don't have time to repeat this.  In about five minutes Peake'll be here with rations. I'll leave this  door unlatched. There's another storage cabin across the corridor--see  if you can hide there, then trick him into getting in here and lock  him in. Got it?\"    Vye nodded.    \"Then--make for the exit port. Here.\" He snapped a packet loose from  his belt. \"This is a flare pak, you saw how they worked on the island.  When you get on the ramp beyond the atom lamp, throw this. It should  hit the camp force barrier. And the result ought to hold their  attention. Then you head for the flitter. Understand?\"    \"Yes.\"    The flitter, yes, that was the perfect escape. With a camp force  barrier on, any fugitive could only break out by going straight up.    Hume gazed at him soberly, listened once more, and then went. Vye  counted a slow five before he followed. The cabin across the corridor  was open, just as Hume had promised. He slipped inside, waited.    Peake was coming now, the metallic plates on his spaceboots clicking  in regular pattern of sound. He earned another ration container and  crooked it in his arm as he snapped up the lock bar on the other  cabin.    There was an exclamation of surprise. Vye went into action. His hand,  backed by all the strength of his thrusting arm, thumped between  Peake's shoulders, sending him staggering into the prison compartment.  Before the other could recover either his balance or his wits, Vye had  the panel shut, the bar locked into place.    He ran down the corridor to the well ladder, swung down its rungs with  an agility born of necessity. Then he was in the air lock, getting his  bearings. The flitter stood to his left, the flashing atom lamp, where  the men were gathered, to his right.    Vye stepped out on the ramp. He wiped his sweating hand across his  thigh. There had to be no failures in the tossing of the flare pak.    Choosing a spot, not directly in line with the lamp but near enough to  dazzle the men, he hurled it with all the force he could muster. Then  he was running down the ramp, forward to the area of the ship.    There was a flash--shouting--Vye curbed the impulse to look back,  darted for the flitter. He jerked open the cabin compartment,  scrambled into the cramped space behind the pilot's seat, leaving that  free for Hume's quick entrance. More shouting--now he saw the lines of  fire wavering from earth to sky along the barrier.    A black shape put on a burst of speed, was silhouetted against that  flaming wall, then passed the spacer, grabbed at the open cockpit, and  slid in behind the controls. Hume pulled the levers with flying  fingers. They arose vertically at a pace which practically slapped  Vye's stomach up into the lower regions of his throat.    The searing line of at least one blaster reached after them--too  slowly, too low. He heard Hume grunt, and they again leaped"]]]
