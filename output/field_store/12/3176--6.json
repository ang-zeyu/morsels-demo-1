Sew on facings at the corners and seams as in the army shelter, and also  on the middle of the bottom of the end-pieces; and put loops of small  rope or a foot or two of stout cord through all of these facings, for  the tent-pins. You will then have a tent with the least amount of labor  and material in it. The top edges, like those of the army shelter, are  to have buttons and button-holes; the tent can then be taken apart into  two pieces, each of which will weigh about two pounds and a quarter.  Nearly all of the work can be done on a sewing-machine; run two rows of  stitching at each seam as near the selvage as you can.    [15] Called also wedge-tent.    [16] To find the distance of the corners, multiply the width of the  cloth (29-1/2 inches) by 3 (three breadths), and subtract 2-1/4 inches  (or three overlappings of 3/4 inch each, as will be explained).    [17] What is known by shoemakers as \"webbing\" is good for this purpose,  or you can double together and sew strips of sheeting or drilling.  Cod-lines and small ropes are objectionable, as they are not easily  untied when in hard knots.    [18] The poles for army A-tents are seven feet six inches.    [19] This name is given to the piece of wood that tightens the guy-line.  The United States army tent has a fiddle 5-1/4 inches long, 1-3/4 wide,  and 1 inch thick; the holes are 3-1/2 inches apart from centre to  centre. If you make a fiddle shorter, or of thinner stock, it does not  hold its grip so well. One hole should be just large enough to admit the  rope, and the other a size larger so that the rope may slide through  easily.    [20] Seven-ounce duck is made, but it is not much heavier than drilling,  and since it is little used it is not easily found for sale. United  States army wall-tents are made from a superior quality of ten-ounce  duck, but they are much stouter than is necessary for summer camping.  There are also \"sail-ducks,\" known as \"No. 8,\" \"No. 9,\" &c., which are  very much too heavy for tents.    [21] The length of tent-poles, as has been previously stated, depends  upon the size of the tent.    [22] What are known as \"bolt-ends\" can be bought at the hardware stores  for this purpose.          CHAPTER X.    MISCELLANEOUS.--GENERAL ADVICE.      If you travel horseback, singly or in parties, a previous experience in  riding and in the care of your animal are necessary for pleasure. What  is said about overloading applies here: you must go light; let your  saddlebags be small, and packed so as not to chafe the horse. If you  have the choice of a saddle, take a \"McClellan\" or a similar one, so  that you can easily strap on your blankets and bags. If you have time  before starting, try to teach your horse, what so few horses in the  Northern States know, to be guided by the pressure of reins against the  neck instead of a pull at the bit.      BOATING.    I do not propose to say much about boating, as the subject can hardly  have justice done to it in a book of this sort. Parties of young men  spend their summer vacation every year in camping and boating. It is a  most delightful way,--superior in many respects to any other,--but it  requires both experience and caution, neither of which is usually found  in young men. So I hope that, if you will go in a boat, you may be an  exception to the general rule, and will, for your parents' and friends'  sake, take a small boat without ballast rather than a large one  ballasted so heavily that it will sink when it fills.    When you belay the sheets of your sail, make a knot that can be untied  by a single pull at the loose end: any boatman will show you how to do  this. _Never make fast the sheets in any other way._ Hold the sheets in  your hands if the wind is at all squally or strong. Do not venture out  in a heavy wind. Stow your baggage snugly before you start: tubs made by  sawing a flour-barrel in two are excellent to throw loose stuff into.  Remember to be careful; keep your eyes open, and know what you are going  to do before you try it. The saying of an old sea-captain comes to me  here: \"I would rather sail a ship around the world, than to go down the  bay in a boat sailed by a boy.\"      RECKONING LOST.    It often happens in travelling, that the sun rises in what appears the  north, west, or south, and we seem to be moving in the wrong direction,  so that when we return home our remembrance of the journey is confused.  Perhaps a few hints on this subject may help the reader. Supposing your  day's journey ends at Blanktown, where you find your compass-points  apparently reversed. It then becomes natural for you to make matters  worse by trying to lay out in your mind a new map, with Blanktown for  the \"hub,\" and east in the west, and so on. You can often prevent these  mishaps, and can always make them less annoying, by studying your map  well both before and during your journey; and by keeping in your mind  continually, with all the vividness you can, what you are really doing.  As far as Blanktown is concerned, you will have two impressions, just as  we all have two impressions with regard to the revolution of the earth  on its axis: apparently the sun rises, goes over and down; but in our  minds we can see the sun standing still, and the earth turning from west  to east.    Upon leaving Blanktown you are likely to carry the error along with you,  and to find yourself moving in what appears to be the wrong way. Keep in  mind with all the vividness possible, the picture of what you are really  doing, and keep out of mind as much as you can the ugly appearance of  going the wrong way. Every important change you make, be sure to \"see  it\" in the mind's eye, and let the natural eye be blind to all that is  deceiving. After a while things will grow real, and you must try to keep  them so. The more perfectly you know the route and all its details, the  less you will be troubled in this way.    If you are travelling in the cars, and if you have a strong power of  imagination, you can very easily right errors of this kind by learning  from the map exactly what you are doing, and then by sitting next to the  window, shut your eyes as you go around a curve that tends to aggravate  the difficulty, and hold fast what you get on curves that help you. If  you sit on the left side of the car, and look ahead, the cars seem to  sweep continually a little to the right, and _vice versa_, when really  moving straight ahead,--provided your imagination is good.    When you are travelling on an unknown road, you should always inquire  all about it, to avoid taking the wrong one, which you are likely to do,  even if you have a good map with you.      LADIES AS PEDESTRIANS.    I have once or twice alluded to ladies walking and camping. It is  thoroughly practicable for them to do so. They must have a wagon, and do  none of the heavy work; their gowns must not reach quite to the ground,  and all of their clothing must be loose and easy.[23] Of course there  must be gentlemen in the party; and it may save annoyance to have at  least one of the ladies well-nigh \"middle-aged.\" Ladies must be cared  for more tenderly than men. If they are not well, the wagon should go  back for them at the end of the day's march; shelter-tents are not to be  recommended for them, nor are two blankets sufficient bedclothing. They  ought not to be compelled to go any definite distance, but after having  made their day's walk let the tents be pitched. Rainy weather is  particularly unpleasant to ladies in tents; deserted houses,  schoolhouses, saw-mills, or barns should be sought for them when a storm  is brewing.      LADIES AND CHILDREN IN CAMP.    In a permanent camp, however, ladies, and children as well, can make  themselves thoroughly at home.[24] They ought not to \"rough it\" so much  as young men expect to: consequently they should be better protected  from the wet and cold.    I have seen a man with his wife and two children enjoy themselves  through a week of rainy weather in an A-tent; but there are not many  such happy families, and it is not advisable to camp with such limited  accommodations.    Almost all women will find it trying to their backs to be kept all day  in an A-tent. If you have no other kind, you should build some sort of a  wall, and pitch the tent on top of it. It is not a difficult or  expensive task to put guy-lines and a wall of drilling on an A-tent, and  make new poles, or pitch the old ones upon posts. In either case you  should stay the tent with lines running from the top to the ground.    It has already been advised that women should have a stove; in general,  they ought not to depart so far from home ways as men do.    Rubber boots are almost a necessity for women and children during rainy  weather and while the dew is upon the grass.      SUMMER-HOUSES, SHEDS, AND BRUSH SCREENS.    There is little to be said of the summer-houses built at the seaside  near our large cities, since that is rather a matter of carpentry; nor  of portable houses; nor of lattice-work with painted paper; nor even of  a \"schbang\" such as I have often built of old doors, shutters, outer  windows, and tarred paper: any one who is ingenious can knock together  all the shelter his needs require or means allow. But, where you are  camping for a week or more, it pays you well to use all you have in  making yourself comfortable. A bush house, a canopy under which to eat,  and something better than plain \"out-of-doors\" to cook in, are among the  first things to attend to.    If you wish to plant firmly a tree that you have cut down, you may  perhaps be able to drive a stake larger than the trunk of the tree; then  loosen the stake by hitting it on the sides, and pull it out. You can do  this when you have no shovel, or when the soil is too hard to dig. Small  stakes wedged down "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17579"],[0,"The History of Napoleon Buonaparte (#11)"],[1,"retreats on Trent, and is recruited--Battle of       Roveredo--Battle of Primolano--Battle of Bassano--Battle of St.       George--Wurmser shut up in Mantua.      The general was now recalled to the war. The cabinet of Vienna, apt to  be slow, but sure to be persevering, had at last resolved upon sending  efficient aid to the Italian frontier. Beulieu had been too often  unfortunate to be trusted longer: Wurmser, who enjoyed a reputation of  the highest class, was sent to replace him: 300,000 men were drafted  from the armies on the Rhine to accompany the new general; and he  carried orders to strengthen himself further, on his march, by whatever  recruits he could raise among the warlike and loyal population of the  Tyrol.    The consequences of thus weakening the Austrian force on the Rhine were,  for the moment, on that scene of the contest, inauspicious. The French,  in two separate bodies, forced the passage of the Rhine--under Jourdan  and Moreau; before whom the imperial generals, Wartensleben and the  Archduke Charles, were compelled to retire. But the skill of the  Archduke ere long enabled him to effect a junction with the columns of  Wartensleben; and thus to fall upon Jourdan with a great superiority of  numbers, and give him a signal defeat. The loss of the French in the  field was great, and the bitter hostility of the German peasantry made  their retreat a bloody one. Moreau, on the other hand, learning how  Jourdan was discomfited, found himself compelled to give up the plan of  pursuing his march further into Germany, and executed that famous  retreat through the Black Forest which has made his name as splendid as  any victory in the field could have done. But this reverse, however  alleviated by the honours of Moreau's achievement, was attended with  appearances of the most perilous kind. The genius of Carnot had devised  a great scheme of operations, of which one half was thus at once cut  short. He had meant Moreau and Jourdan, coalescing beyond the Rhine, to  march upon the Tyrol; while Buonaparte should advance from the scene of  his Italian conquests, join his brother generals on that frontier, and  then march in union with them to dictate a peace before the gates of  Vienna. All hope of this junction of forces was now at an end for this  campaign. The French saw themselves compelled to resume the defensive on  the western frontier of Germany; and the army of Italy had to await the  overwhelming war which seemed ready to pour down upon Lombardy from the  passes of the Tyrol.    Wurmser, when he fixed his headquarters at Trent, mustered in all  80,000; while Buonaparte had but 30,000, to hold a wide country, in  which abhorrence of the French cause was now prevalent, to keep up the  blockade of Mantua, and to oppose this fearful odds of numbers in the  field. He was now, moreover, to act on the defensive, while his  adversary assumed the more inspiriting character of invader. He awaited  the result with calmness.    Wurmser might have learned from the successes of Buonaparte the  advantages of compact movement; yet he was unwise enough to divide his  great force into three separate columns, and to place one of these upon  a line of march which entirely separated it from the support of the  others. He himself, with his centre, came down on the left bank of the  Lago di Guarda, with Mantua before him as his mark: his left wing, under  Melas, was to descend the Adige, and drive the French from Verona; while  the right wing, under Quasdonowich, were ordered to keep down the valley  of the Chiese, in the direction of Brescia, and so to cut off the  retreat of Buonaparte upon the Milanese;--in other words, to interpose  the waters of the Lago di Guarda between themselves and the march of  their friends--a blunder not likely to escape the eagle eye of Napoleon.    He immediately determined to march against Quasdonowich, and fight him  where he could not be supported by the other two columns. This could  not be done without abandoning for the time the blockade of Mantua; but  it was not for Buonaparte to hesitate about purchasing a great ultimate  advantage by a present sacrifice, however disagreeable. The guns were  buried in the trenches during the night of the 31st July, and the French  quitted the place with a precipitation which the advancing Austrians  considered as the result of terror.    Napoleon meanwhile rushed against Quasdonowich, who had already come  near the bottom of the Lake of Guarda. At Salo, close by the lake, and,  further from it, at Lonato, two divisions of the Austrian column were  attacked and overwhelmed. Augereau and Massena, leaving merely  rear-guards at Borghetto and Peschiera, now marched also upon Brescia.  The whole force of Quasdonowich must inevitably have been ruined by  these combinations, had he stood his ground; but by this time the  celerity of Napoleon had overawed him, and he was already in full  retreat upon his old quarters in the Tyrol. Augereau and Massena,  therefore, countermarched their columns, and returned towards the  Mincio. They found that Wurmser had forced their rear-guards from their  posts: that of Massena, under Pigeon, had retired in good order to  Lonato; that of Augereau, under Vallette, had retreated in confusion,  abandoning Castiglione to the Austrians.    Flushed with these successes, old Wurmser now resolved to throw his  whole force upon the French, and resume at the point of the bayonet his  communication with the scattered column of Quasdonowich. He was so  fortunate as to defeat the gallant Pigeon at Lonato, and to occupy that  town. But this great new success was fatal to him. In the exultation of  victory he extended his line too much towards the right; and this  over-anxiety to open the communication with Quasdonowich had the effect  of so weakening his centre, that Massena, boldly and skilfully seizing  the opportunity, poured two strong columns on Lonato, and regained the  position; whereon the Austrian, perceiving that his army was cut in two,  was thrown into utter confusion. Some of his troops, marching to the  right, were met by those of the French, who had already defeated  Quasdonowich in that quarter, and obliged to surrender: the most  retreated in great disorder. At Castiglione alone a brave stand was  made. But Augereau, burning to wipe out the disgrace of Vallette,[10]  forced the position, though at a severe loss. Such was the battle of  Lonato. Thenceforth nothing could surpass the discomfiture and disarray  of the Austrians. They fled in all directions upon the Mincio, where  Wurmser himself, meanwhile, had been employed in revictualling Mantua.    A mere accident had once more almost saved the Imperialist. One of the  many defeated divisions of the army, wandering about in anxiety to find  some means of reaching the Mincio, came suddenly on Lonato, the scene of  the late battle, at a moment when Napoleon was there with only his staff  and guards about him. He knew not that any considerable body of the  enemy remained together in the neighbourhood; and, but for his presence  of mind, must have been their prisoner. The Austrian had not the skill  to profit by what fortune threw in his way; the other was able to turn  even a blunder into an advantage. The officer sent to demand the  surrender of the town was brought blindfolded, as is the custom, to his  headquarters; Buonaparte, by a secret sign, caused his whole staff to  draw up around him, and when the bandage was removed from the  messenger's eyes, saluted him thus: \"What means this insolence? Do you  beard the French general in the middle of his army?\" The German  recognised the person of Napoleon, and retreated stammering and  blushing. He assured his commander that Lonato was occupied by the  French in numbers that made resistance impossible. Four thousand men  laid down their arms; and then discovered that, if they had used them,  nothing could have prevented Napoleon from being their prize.    Wurmser collected together the whole of his remaining force, and  advanced to meet the conqueror. He, meanwhile, had himself determined on  the assault, and was hastening to the encounter. They met between Lonato  and Castiglione. Wurmser was totally defeated, and narrowly escaped  being a prisoner; nor did he without great difficulty regain Trent and  Roveredo, those frontier positions from which his noble army had so  recently descended with all the confidence of conquerors. In this  disastrous campaign the Austrians lost 40,000: Buonaparte probably  understated his own loss at 7000. During the seven days which the  campaign occupied he never took off his boots, nor slept except by  starts. The exertions which so rapidly achieved this signal triumph were  such as to demand some repose; yet Napoleon did not pause until he saw  Mantua once more completely invested. The reinforcement and  revictualling of that garrison were all that Wurmser could show, in  requital of his lost artillery, stores, and 40,000 men.    During this brief campaign the aversion with which the ecclesiastics of  Italy regarded the French manifested itself in various quarters. At  Pavia, Ferrara, and elsewhere, insurrections had broken out, and the  spirit was spreading rapidly at the moment when the report of Napoleon's  new victory came to re-awaken terror and paralyse revolt. The conqueror  judged it best to accept for the present the resubmission, however  forced, of a party too powerful to be put down by examples. The Cardinal  Mattei, Archbishop of Ferrara, being brought into his presence, uttered  the single word _peccavi_: the victor was contented with ordering him a  penance of seven days' fasting and prayer in a monastery: but he had no  intention to forget these occurrences whenever another day of reckoning  with the Pope should come.    While he was occupied with restoring quiet in the country, Austria, ever  constant in adversity, hastened to place 20,000 fresh troops"]]]
