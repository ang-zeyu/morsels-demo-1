It was clear, from what Cope said, that our man had  not a friend in his own country. Still, as he pointed out, Devikota  was a most important place for us. Neither Madras nor Fort Saint David  has a harbour; and Devikota, therefore, where the largest ships could  run up the river and anchor, would be of immense utility to us.    \"As this was really the reason for which we had gone into the affair,  it was decided to repeat the attempt. By this time Major Lawrence, who  commands the whole of the Company's forces in India, and who had been  taken a prisoner in one of the French sorties at the siege of  Pondicherry, had been released. So he was put at the head of the  expedition; and the whole of the Company's English troops, eight  hundred in all, including the artillery; and fifteen hundred Sepoys,  started on board ship for Devikota. I must tell you that Lawrence is a  first-rate fellow, the only really good officer we have out here, and  the affair couldn't have been in the hands of a better man.    \"The ships arrived safely at the mouth of the Kolrun, and the troops  were landed on the bank of the river opposite the town, where Lawrence  intended to erect his batteries; as, in the first place, the shore  behind the town was swampy, and in the second the Rajah of Tanjore,  who had got news of our coming, had his army encamped there to support  the place. Lawrence got his guns in position and fired away, across  the river, at the earthen wall of the town. In three days he had a  breach. The enemy didn't return our fire, but occupied themselves in  throwing up an entrenchment across the side of the fort.    \"We made a raft and crossed the river, but the enemy's matchlock men  peppered us so severely that we lost thirty English and fifty Sepoys  in getting over. The enemy's entrenchment was not finished, but in  front of it was a deep rivulet, which had to be crossed.    \"Lawrence gave the command of the storming party to Clive. He is one  of our fellows; a queer, restless sort of chap, who was really no good  here, for he hated his work and always seemed to think himself a  martyr. He was not a favourite among us, for he was often gloomy and  discontented, though he had his good points. He was straightforward  and manly, and he put down two or three fellows here, who had been  given to bully the young ones, in a way that astonished them.    \"He would never have made a good servant of the Company, for he so  hated his work that, when he had been out here about a year, he tried  to blow out his brains. He snapped the pistol twice at his head, but  it didn't go off, though it was loaded all right. Strange, wasn't it?  So he came to the conclusion that he wasn't meant to kill himself, and  went on living till something should turn up.\"    \"Yes,\" Charlie said; \"Doctor Rae spoke to us about him during the  voyage. He knew him at the siege of Fort Saint David, and  Pondicherry.\"    \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"He came out there quite in a new light. He got  transferred into the military service, and was always in the middle of  the fighting. Major Lawrence had a very high opinion of him, and so  selected him to lead the storming party. It really seems almost as if  he had a charmed life. Lawrence gave him thirty-three English  soldiers, and seven hundred Sepoys. The rest of the force were to  follow as soon as Clive's party gained the entrenchments. Clive led  the way with his Europeans, with the Sepoys supporting behind, and got  across the rivulet with a loss of only four men. He waited on the  other bank till he saw the Sepoys climbing up, and then again led the  English on in advance towards the unfinished part of the entrenchment.    \"The Sepoys, however, did not move, but remained waiting for the main  body to come up. The enemy let Clive and his twenty-nine men get on  some distance in advance, and then their cavalry, who had been hidden  by a projection of the fort, charged suddenly down on him. They were  upon our men before they had time to form, and in a minute twenty-six  of them were cut to pieces. Clive and the other three managed to get  through the Tanjore horsemen and rejoin the Sepoys. That was almost as  narrow a shave for his life as with the pistol.    \"Lawrence now crossed with his main body and advanced. Again the  Tanjore horsemen charged; but this time we were prepared, and Lawrence  let them come on till within a few yards, and then gave them a volley  which killed fourteen and sent the rest scampering away. Lawrence  pushed forward. The garrison, panic stricken at the defeat of their  cavalry, abandoned the breach and escaped to the opposite side of the  town, and Devikota was ours.    \"A few days later we captured the fortified temple of Uchipuran. A  hundred men were left there, and these were afterwards attacked by the  Rajah of Tanjore, with five thousand men; but they held their own, and  beat them off. A very gallant business, that!    \"These affairs showed the rajah that the English could fight; a point  which, hitherto, the natives had been somewhat sceptical about. They  were afraid of the French, but they looked upon us as mere traders. He  had, too, other things to trouble him as to the state of the Carnatic,  and so hastened to make peace. He agreed to pay the expenses of the  war, and to cede us Devikota and some territory round it; and to allow  the wretched ex-rajah, in whose cause we had pretended to fight, a  pension of four hundred a year, on condition that we kept him shut up  in one of our forts.    \"Not a very nice business on our side, was it? Still, we had gained  our point, and, with the exception of the ex-rajah, who was a bad lot  after all, no one was discontented.    \"When the peace was signed, our force returned to Fort Saint David.  While they had been away, there had been a revolution in the Carnatic.  Now this was rather a complicated business; but as the whole situation  at present turns upon it; and it will, not improbably, cause our  expulsion from Southern India; I will explain it to you as well as I  can.    \"Now you must know that all Southern India, with the exception of a  strip along the west coast, is governed by a viceroy, appointed by the  emperor at Delhi. He was called the Subadar of the Deccan. Up till the  end of 'forty-eight, Nizam Ul-Mulk was viceroy. About that time he  died, and the emperor appointed his grandson, Muzaffar Jung, who was  the son of a daughter of his, to succeed him. But the subadar had left  five sons. Four of these lived at Delhi, and were content to enjoy  their life there. The second son, however, Nazir Jung, was an  ambitious man, who had rebelled even against his father. Naturally, he  rebelled against his nephew.    \"He was on the spot when his father died, while the new subadar was  absent. Nazir, therefore, seized the reins of government, and all the  resources of the state. The emperor has troubles enough of his own at  Delhi, and Muzaffar had no hope of aid from him. He therefore went to  Satarah, the court of the Mahrattas, to ask for their assistance.    \"There he met Chunda Sahib. This man was the nephew of the last nawab  of the Carnatic, Dost Ali. Dost Ali had been killed in a battle with  them, in 1739; and they afterwards captured Trichinopoli, and took  Chunda Sahib, who commanded there, prisoner; and had since kept him at  Satarah. Had he been at liberty he would, no doubt, have succeeded his  uncle, whose only son had been murdered; but as he was at Satarah, the  Subadar of the Deccan bestowed the government of the Carnatic upon  Anwarud-din.    \"Chunda Sahib and Muzaffar Jung put their heads together, and agreed  to act in concert. Muzaffar, of course, desired the subadarship of the  Deccan, to which he had been appointed by the court of Delhi. Chunda  Sahib wanted the nawabship of the Carnatic, and advised his ally to  abandon his intention of asking for Mahratta aid, and to ally himself  with the French. A correspondence ensued with Dupleix, who, seeing the  immense advantage it would be to him to gain what would virtually be  the position of patron and protector of the Subadar of the Deccan, and  the Nawab of the Carnatic, at once agreed to join them.    \"Muzaffar raised thirty thousand men, and Chunda Sahib six  thousand--it is always easy, in India, to raise an army; with a  certain amount of money, and lavish promises--marched down and joined  a French force of four hundred strong, commanded by D'Auteuil.    \"The nawab advanced against them, but was utterly defeated at Ambur,  the French doing pretty well the whole of the work. The nawab was  killed, and one of his sons, Maphuz Khan, taken prisoner. The other,  Muhammud Ali, bolted at the beginning of the fight. Arcot, the capital  of the Carnatic, surrendered next day.    \"Muzaffar Jung proclaimed himself Subadar of the Deccan, and appointed  Chunda Sahib Nawab of the Carnatic. Muzaffar Jung conferred upon  Dupleix the sovereignty of eighty-one villages adjoining the French  territory. Muzaffar, after paying a visit to Pondicherry, remained in  the camp with his army, twenty miles distant from that place. Chunda  Sahib remained, as the guest of Dupleix, at Pondicherry.    \"On the receipt of the news of the battle of Ambur, Mr. Floyer, who is  governor at Fort Saint David, sent at once to Chunda Sahib to  acknowledge him as nawab; which, in the opinion of everyone here, was  a very foolish step. Muhammud Ali had fled to Trichinopoli, and sent  word to Mr. Floyer that he could hold the place, and even reconquer  the Carnatic, if the English would assist him. I know that Admiral  Boscawen, who was with the fleet at Fort Saint David, urged Mr. Floyer  to do so, as it was clear that Chunda Sahib would be a mere tool in  the hands of the French.    \"When Chunda Sahib delayed week"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18837"],[0,"Commentarii de Bello Gallico (#11)"],[1," qui Oceanum attingunt adiungit: omnium consensu  ad eum defertur imperium. Qua oblata potestate omnibus his civitatibus  obsides imperat, certum numerum militum ad se celeriter adduci iubet,  armorum quantum quaeque civitas domi quodque ante tempus efficiat  constituit; in primis equitatui studet. Summae diligentiae summam imperi  severitatem addit; magnitudine supplici dubitantes cogit. Nam maiore  commisso delicto igni atque omnibus tormentis necat, leviore de causa  auribus desectis aut singulis effossis oculis domum remittit, ut sint  reliquis documento et magnitudine poenae perterreant alios.      5    His suppliciis celeriter coacto exercitu Lucterium Cadurcum, summae  hominem audaciae, cum parte copiarum in Rutenos mittit; ipse in  Bituriges proficiscitur. Eius adventu Bituriges ad Aeduos, quorum erant  in fide, legatos mittunt subsidium rogatum, quo facilius hostium copias  sustinere possint. Aedui de consilio legatorum, quos Caesar ad exercitum  reliquerat, copias equitatus peditatusque subsidio Biturigibus mittunt.  Qui cum ad flumen Ligerim venissent, quod Bituriges ab Aeduis dividit,  paucos dies ibi morati neque flumen transire ausi domum revertuntur  legatisque nostris renuntiant se Biturigum perfidiam veritos revertisse,  quibus id consili fuisse cognoverint, ut, si flumen transissent, una ex  parte ipsi, altera Arverni se circumsisterent. Id eane de causa, quam  legatis pronuntiarunt, an perfidia adducti fecerint, quod nihil nobis  constat, non videtur pro certo esse proponendum. Bituriges eorum  discessu statim cum Arvernis iunguntur.      6    His rebus in Italiam Caesari nuntiatis, cum iam ille urbanas res virtute  Cn. Pompei commodiorem in statum pervenisse intellegeret, in  Transalpinam Galliam profectus est. Eo cum venisset, magna difficultate  adficiebatur, qua ratione ad exercitum pervenire posset. Nam si legiones  in provinciam arcesseret, se absente in itinere proelio dimicaturas  intellegebat; si ipse ad exercitum contenderet, ne eis quidem eo tempore  qui quieti viderentur suam salutem recte committi videbat.      7    Interim Lucterius Cadurcus in Rutenos missus eam civitatem Arvernis  conciliat. Progressus in Nitiobriges et Gabalos ab utrisque obsides  accipit et magna coacta manu in provinciam Narbonem versus eruptionem  facere contendit. Qua re nuntiata Caesar omnibus consiliis antevertendum  existimavit, ut Narbonem proficisceretur. Eo cum venisset, timentes  confirmat, praesidia in Rutenis provincialibus, Volcis Arecomicis,  Tolosatibus circumque Narbonem, quae loca hostibus erant finitima,  constituit; partem copiarum ex provincia supplementumque, quod ex Italia  adduxerat, in Helvios, qui fines Arvernorum contingunt, convenire iubet.      8    His rebus comparatis, represso iam Lucterio et remoto, quod intrare  intra praesidia periculosum putabat, in Helvios proficiscitur. Etsi mons  Cevenna, qui Arvernos ab Helviis discludit, durissimo tempore anni  altissima nive iter impediebat, tamen discussa nive sex in altitudinem  pedum atque ita viis patefactis summo militum sudore ad fines Arvernorum  pervenit. Quibus oppressis inopinantibus, quod se Cevenna ut muro  munitos existimabant, ac ne singulari quidem umquam homini eo tempore  anni semitae patuerant, equitibus imperat, ut quam latissime possint  vagentur et quam maximum hostibus terrorem inferant. Celeriter haec fama  ac nuntiis ad Vercingetorigem perferuntur; quem perterriti omnes Arverni  circumsistunt atque obsecrant, ut suis fortunis consulat, neve ab  hostibus diripiautur, praesertim cum videat omne ad se bellum  translatum. Quorum ille precibus per motus castra ex Biturigibus movet  in Arveruos versus.      9    At Caesar biduum in his locis moratus, quod haec de Vercingetorige usu  ventura opinione praeceperat, per causam supplementi equitatusque  cogendi ab exercitu discedit; Brutum adulescentem his copiis praeficit;  hunc monet, ut in omnes partes equites quam latissime pervagentur:  daturum se operam, ne longius triduo ab castris absit. His constitutis  rebus suis inopinantibus quam maximis potest itineribus Viennam  pervenit. Ibi nactus recentem equitatum, quem multis ante diebus eo  praemiserat, neque diurno neque nocturno itinere intermisso per fines  Aeduorum in Lingones contendit, ubi duae legiones hiemabant, ut, si quid  etiam de sua salute ab Aeduis iniretur consili, celeritate praecurreret.  Eo cum pervenisset, ad reliquas legiones mittit priusque omnes in unum  locum cogit quam de eius adventu Arvernis nuntiari posset. Hac re  cognita Vercingetorix rursus in Bituriges exercitum reducit atque inde  profectus Gorgobinam, Boiorum oppidum, quos ibi Helvetico proelio victos  Caesar collocaverat Aeduisque attribuerat, oppugnare instituit.      10    Magnam haec res Caesari difficultatem ad consilium capiendum adferebat,  si reliquam partem hiemis uno loco legiones contineret, ne stipendiariis  Aeduorum expugnatis cuncta Gallia deficeret, quod nullum amicis in eo  praesidium videretur positum esse; si maturius ex hibernis educeret, ne  ab re frumentaria duris subvectionibus laboraret. Praestare visum est  tamen omnis difficultates perpeti, quam tanta contumelia accepta omnium  suorum voluntates alienare. Itaque cohortatus Aeduos de supportando  commeatu praemittit ad Boios qui de suo adventu doceant hortenturque ut  in fide maneant atque hostium impetum magno animo sustineant. Duabus  Agedinci legionibus atque impedimentis totius exer citus relictis ad  Boios proficiscitur.      11    Altero die cum ad oppidum Senonum Vellaunodunum venisset, ne quem post  se hostem relinqueret, quo expeditiore re frumentaria uteretur,  oppugnare instituit idque biduo circumvallavit; tertio die missis ex  oppido legatis de deditione arma conferri, iumenta produci, sescentos  obsides dari iubet. Ea qui conficeret, a. Trebonium legatum relinquit.  Ipse, ut quam primum iter faceret, Cenabum Carnutum proficiscitur; qui  tum primum allato nuntio de oppugnatione Vellaunoduni, cum longius eam  rem ductum iri existimarent, praesidium Cenabi tuendi causa, quod eo  mitterent, comparabant. Huc biduo pervenit. Castris ante oppidum positis  diei tempore exclusus in posterum oppugnationem differt quaeque ad eam  rem usui sint militibus imperat et, quod oppidum Cenabum pons fluminis  Ligeris contingebat, veritus ne noctu ex oppido profugerent, duas  legiones in armis excubare iubet. Cenabenses paulo ante mediam noctem  silentio ex oppido egressi flumen transire coeperunt. Qua re per  exploratores nuntiata Caesar legiones quas expeditas esse iusserat  portis incensis intromittit atque oppido potitur, perpaucis ex hostium  numero desideratis quin cuncti caperentur, quod pontis atque itinerum  angustiae multitudinis fugam intercluserant. Oppidum diripit atque  incendit, praedam militibus donat, exercitum Ligerem traducit atque in  Biturigum fines pervenit.      12    Vercingetorix, ubi de Caesaris adventu cognovit, oppuguatione destitit  atque obviam Caesari proficiscitur. Ille oppidum Biturigum positum in  via Noviodunum oppugnare instituerat. Quo ex oppido cum legati ad eum  venissent oratum ut sibi ignosceret suaeque vitae consuleret, ut  celeritate reliquas res conficeret, qua pleraque erat consecutus, arma  conferri, equos produci, obsides dari iubet. Parte iam obsidum tradita,  cum reliqua administrarentur, centurionibus et paucis militibus  intromissis, qui arma iumentaque conquirerent, equitatus hostium procul  visus est, qui agmen Vercingetorigis antecesserat. Quem simul atque  oppidani conspexerunt atque in spem auxili venerunt, clamore sublato  arma capere, portas claudere, murum complere coeperunt. Centuriones in  oppido, cum ex significatione Gallorum novi aliquid ab eis iniri consili  intellexissent, gladiis destrictis portas occupaverunt suosque omnes  incolumes receperunt.      13    Caesar ex castris equitatum educi iubet, proelium equestre committit:  laborantibus iam suis Germanos equites circiter CCCC summittit, quos ab  initio habere secum instituerat. Eorum impetum Galli sustinere non  potuerunt atque in fugam coniecti multis amissis se ad agmen receperunt.  Quibus profligatis rursus oppidani perterriti comprehensos eos, quorum  opera plebem concitatam existimabant, ad Caesarem perduxerunt seseque ei  dediderunt. Quibus rebus confectis, Caesar ad oppidum Avaricum, quod  erat maximum munitissimumque in finibus Biturigum atque agri  fertilissima regione, profectus est, quod eo oppido recepto civitatem  Biturigum se in potestatem redacturum confidebat.      14    Vercingetorix tot continuis incommodis Vellaunoduni, Cenabi, Novioduni  acceptis suos ad concilium convocat. Docet longe alia ratione esse  bellum gerendum atque antea gestum sit. Omnibus modis huic rei  studendum, ut pabulatione et commeatu Romani prohibeantur. Id esse  facile, quod equitatu ipsi abundent et quod anni tempore subleventur.  Pabulum secari non posse; necessario dispersos hostes ex aedificiis  petere: hos omnes cotidie ab equitibus deligi posse. Praeterea salutis  causa rei familiaris commoda neglegenda: vicos atque aedificia incendi  oportere hoc spatio ab via quoque versus, quo pabulandi causa adire  posse videantur. Harum ipsis rerum copiam suppetere, quod, quorum in  finibus bellum geratur, eorum opibus subleventur: Romanos aut inopiam  non laturos aut magno periculo longius ab castris processuros; neque  interesse, ipsosne interficiant, impedimentisne exuant, quibus amissis  bellum geri non possit. Praeterea oppida incendi oportere, quae non  munitione et loci natura ab omni sint periculo tuta, neu suis sint ad  detractandam militiam receptacula neu Romanis proposita ad copiam  commeatus praedamque tollendam. Haec si gravia aut acerba videautur,  multo illa gravius aestimare, liberos, coniuges in servitutem abstrahi,  ipsos interfici; quae sit necesse accidere victis.      15    Omnium consensu hac sententia probata uno die amplius XX urbes Biturigum  iucenduntur. Hoc idem fit in reliquis civitatibus: in omnibus partibus  incendia conspiciuntur;"]]]
