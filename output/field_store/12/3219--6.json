The other man said he was blooming well blest--or something like it--but  though naturally surprised they were not exactly unkind.    \"You're a naughty little gell, that's what you are,\" said the fireman,  and the engine-driver said:--    \"Daring little piece, I call her,\" but they made her sit down on an iron  seat in the cab and told her to stop crying and tell them what she meant  by it.    She did stop, as soon as she could. One thing that helped her was the  thought that Peter would give almost his ears to be in her place--on a  real engine--really going. The children had often wondered whether any  engine-driver could be found noble enough to take them for a ride on an  engine--and now there she was. She dried her eyes and sniffed earnestly.    \"Now, then,\" said the fireman, \"out with it. What do you mean by it,  eh?\"    \"Oh, please,\" sniffed Bobbie.    \"Try again,\" said the engine-driver, encouragingly.    Bobbie tried again.    \"Please, Mr. Engineer,\" she said, \"I did call out to you from the  line, but you didn't hear me--and I just climbed up to touch you on the  arm--quite gently I meant to do it--and then I fell into the coals--and  I am so sorry if I frightened you. Oh, don't be cross--oh, please  don't!\" She sniffed again.    \"We ain't so much CROSS,\" said the fireman, \"as interested like. It  ain't every day a little gell tumbles into our coal bunker outer the  sky, is it, Bill? What did you DO it for--eh?\"    \"That's the point,\" agreed the engine-driver; \"what did you do it FOR?\"    Bobbie found that she had not quite stopped crying. The engine-driver  patted her on the back and said: \"Here, cheer up, Mate. It ain't so bad  as all that 'ere, I'll be bound.\"    \"I wanted,\" said Bobbie, much cheered to find herself addressed as  'Mate'--\"I only wanted to ask you if you'd be so kind as to mend this.\"  She picked up the brown-paper parcel from among the coals and undid the  string with hot, red fingers that trembled.    Her feet and legs felt the scorch of the engine fire, but her shoulders  felt the wild chill rush of the air. The engine lurched and shook and  rattled, and as they shot under a bridge the engine seemed to shout in  her ears.    The fireman shovelled on coals.    Bobbie unrolled the brown paper and disclosed the toy engine.    \"I thought,\" she said wistfully, \"that perhaps you'd mend this for  me--because you're an engineer, you know.\"    The engine-driver said he was blowed if he wasn't blest.    \"I'm blest if I ain't blowed,\" remarked the fireman.    But the engine-driver took the little engine and looked at it--and the  fireman ceased for an instant to shovel coal, and looked, too.    \"It's like your precious cheek,\" said the engine-driver--\"whatever made  you think we'd be bothered tinkering penny toys?\"    \"I didn't mean it for precious cheek,\" said Bobbie; \"only everybody that  has anything to do with railways is so kind and good, I didn't think  you'd mind. You don't really--do you?\" she added, for she had seen a not  unkindly wink pass between the two.    \"My trade's driving of an engine, not mending her, especially such a  hout-size in engines as this 'ere,\" said Bill. \"An' 'ow are we a-goin'  to get you back to your sorrowing friends and relations, and all be  forgiven and forgotten?\"    \"If you'll put me down next time you stop,\" said Bobbie, firmly, though  her heart beat fiercely against her arm as she clasped her hands, \"and  lend me the money for a third-class ticket, I'll pay you back--honour  bright. I'm not a confidence trick like in the newspapers--really, I'm  not.\"    \"You're a little lady, every inch,\" said Bill, relenting suddenly  and completely. \"We'll see you gets home safe. An' about this  engine--Jim--ain't you got ne'er a pal as can use a soldering iron?  Seems to me that's about all the little bounder wants doing to it.\"    \"That's what Father said,\" Bobbie explained eagerly. \"What's that for?\"    She pointed to a little brass wheel that he had turned as he spoke.    \"That's the injector.\"    \"In--what?\"    \"Injector to fill up the boiler.\"    \"Oh,\" said Bobbie, mentally registering the fact to tell the others;  \"that IS interesting.\"    \"This 'ere's the automatic brake,\" Bill went on, flattered by her  enthusiasm. \"You just move this 'ere little handle--do it with one  finger, you can--and the train jolly soon stops. That's what they call  the Power of Science in the newspapers.\"    He showed her two little dials, like clock faces, and told her how one  showed how much steam was going, and the other showed if the brake was  working properly.    By the time she had seen him shut off steam with a big shining steel  handle, Bobbie knew more about the inside working of an engine than she  had ever thought there was to know, and Jim had promised that his second  cousin's wife's brother should solder the toy engine, or Jim would know  the reason why. Besides all the knowledge she had gained Bobbie felt  that she and Bill and Jim were now friends for life, and that they had  wholly and forever forgiven her for stumbling uninvited among the sacred  coals of their tender.    At Stacklepoole Junction she parted from them with warm expressions of  mutual regard. They handed her over to the guard of a returning train--a  friend of theirs--and she had the joy of knowing what guards do in their  secret fastnesses, and understood how, when you pull the communication  cord in railway carriages, a wheel goes round under the guard's nose and  a loud bell rings in his ears. She asked the guard why his van smelt  so fishy, and learned that he had to carry a lot of fish every day, and  that the wetness in the hollows of the corrugated floor had all drained  out of boxes full of plaice and cod and mackerel and soles and smelts.    Bobbie got home in time for tea, and she felt as though her mind would  burst with all that had been put into it since she parted from the  others. How she blessed the nail that had torn her frock!    \"Where have you been?\" asked the others.    \"To the station, of course,\" said Roberta. But she would not tell a word  of her adventures till the day appointed, when she mysteriously led them  to the station at the hour of the 3.19's transit, and proudly introduced  them to her friends, Bill and Jim. Jim's second cousin's wife's brother  had not been unworthy of the sacred trust reposed in him. The toy engine  was, literally, as good as new.    \"Good-bye--oh, good-bye,\" said Bobbie, just before the engine screamed  ITS good-bye. \"I shall always, always love you--and Jim's second  cousin's wife's brother as well!\"    And as the three children went home up the hill, Peter hugging the  engine, now quite its own self again, Bobbie told, with joyous leaps of  the heart, the story of how she had been an Engine-burglar.        Chapter V. Prisoners and captives.      It was one day when Mother had gone to Maidbridge. She had gone alone,  but the children were to go to the station to meet her. And, loving the  station as they did, it was only natural that they should be there a  good hour before there was any chance of Mother's train arriving, even  if the train were punctual, which was most unlikely. No doubt they would  have been just as early, even if it had been a fine day, and all the  delights of woods and fields and rocks and rivers had been open to them.  But it happened to be a very wet day and, for July, very cold. There was  a wild wind that drove flocks of dark purple clouds across the sky \"like  herds of dream-elephants,\" as Phyllis said. And the rain stung sharply,  so that the way to the station was finished at a run. Then the rain fell  faster and harder, and beat slantwise against the windows of the booking  office and of the chill place that had General Waiting Room on its door.    \"It's like being in a besieged castle,\" Phyllis said; \"look at the  arrows of the foe striking against the battlements!\"    \"It's much more like a great garden-squirt,\" said Peter.    They decided to wait on the up side, for the down platform looked very  wet indeed, and the rain was driving right into the little bleak shelter  where down-passengers have to wait for their trains.    The hour would be full of incident and of interest, for there would be  two up trains and one down to look at before the one that should bring  Mother back.    \"Perhaps it'll have stopped raining by then,\" said Bobbie; \"anyhow, I'm  glad I brought Mother's waterproof and umbrella.\"    They went into the desert spot labelled General Waiting Room, and the  time passed pleasantly enough in a game of advertisements. You know the  game, of course? It is something like dumb Crambo. The players take  it in turns to go out, and then come back and look as like some  advertisement as they can, and the others have to guess what  advertisement it is meant to be. Bobbie came in and sat down under  Mother's umbrella and made a sharp face, and everyone knew she was the  fox who sits under the umbrella in the advertisement. Phyllis tried to  make a Magic Carpet of Mother's waterproof, but it would not stand out  stiff and raft-like as a Magic Carpet should, and nobody could guess  it. Everyone thought Peter was carrying things a little too far when he  blacked his face all over with coal-dust and struck a spidery attitude  and said he was the blot that advertises somebody's Blue Black Writing  Fluid.    It was Phyllis's turn again, and she was trying to look like the Sphinx  that advertises What's-his-name's Personally Conducted Tours up the Nile  when the sharp ting of the signal announced the up train. The children  rushed out to see it pass. On its engine were the particular driver  and fireman who were now numbered among the children's dearest friends.  Courtesies passed between them. Jim asked after the toy engine, and  Bobbie pressed on his acceptance a moist, greasy package of toffee that  she had made herself.    Charmed by this attention, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18751"],[0,"A Text-book of Assaying: For the Use of Those Connected with Mines. (#11)"],[1,"depends upon the quantity of colouring matter  present. So that if two solutions of the same substance are equally  coloured they are of equal strength. In this way an unknown may be  compared with a known strength, and a fairly accurate determination may  be made. These three illustrations serve as types of the three chief  classes of volumetric assays--titrometric, gasometric, and colorimetric.    ~Titrometric Assays.~--Within the limits of the error of experiment, a  definite volume of a solution or gas represents a certain weight of  metal or other substance, hence the exact weight may be determined by  experiment. The error of experiment may be reduced to insignificant  dimensions by repeating the experiment, and taking the mean of three or  four determinations. This will at the same time show the amount of  variation. Thus, if 0.5 gram of iron were dissolved and found to require  50.3 cubic centimetres of the solution of permanganate of potash, and if  on repeating, 50.4, 50.2, and 50.3 c.c. were required, the experimenter  would be justified in saying that 50.3 c.c. of the permanganate solution  represent 0.5 gram of iron, and that his results were good within 0.2  c.c. of the permanganate solution. So that if in an unknown solution of  iron, 50.5 c.c. of the permanganate solution were used up, he could  state with confidence that it contained a little more than 0.5 gram of  iron. With a larger experience the confidence would increase, and with  practice the experimental error will diminish.    But supposing that the unknown solution required, say, 100.5 instead of  50.5 c.c., he would not be justified in saying that, since 50.3 c.c. are  equivalent to 0.5 gram, 100.6 c.c. are equivalent to twice that amount;  and that, consequently, the unknown solution contained a little less  than 1 gram of iron; or, at least, he could not say it except he (or  some one else) had determined it by experiment. But if on dissolving 1  gram of iron, he found it to require 100.6 c.c. of the solution, and in  another experiment with 0.8 gram of iron that 80.5 c.c. of the solution  were required, he would be justified in stating that _the volume of  solution required is proportional to the quantity of metal present_.  There are a large number of volumetric assays of which this is true, but  that it is true in any particular case can only be proved by experiment.  Even where true it is well not to rest too much weight upon it, and in  all cases the quantity of metal taken, to determine the strength of the  solution used, should not differ widely from that present in the assay.  There are certain terms which should be explained here. When the  solution of a reagent is applied under such conditions that the volume  added can be correctly determined, the operation is called \"titrating,\"  the solution of the reagent used the \"standard solution,\" and the  process of determining the strength of the standard solution is  \"standardising.\" The \"standard\" is the quantity of metal equivalent to  100 c.c. of the standard solution.    ~Standard Solutions.~--In making these the salt is accurately weighed  and transferred to a litre flask, or to the graduated cylinder, and  dissolved. The method of dissolving it varies in special cases, and  instructions for these will be found under the respective assays.  Generally it is dissolved in a small quantity of liquid, and then  diluted to the mark. For those substances that require the aid of heat,  the solution is made in a pint flask, cooled, and transferred; after  which the flask is well washed out. After dilution, the liquids in the  measuring vessel must be thoroughly mixed by shaking. This is more  easily and better done in the cylinder than in the litre flask. The  solution is next transferred to a dry \"Winchester\" bottle and labelled.  The label may be rendered permanent by waxing it.    Standard solutions should not be kept in a place exposed to direct  sunlight. Oxidising and reducing solutions, such as those of  permanganate of potash, ferrous sulphate, iodine, hyposulphite of soda,  &c., gradually weaken in strength; the solutions of other salts are more  stable; while those of potassium bichromate and baric chloride are  almost permanent. Solutions of potassium permanganate may be kept for a  month or so without much change. The solutions of hyposulphite of soda  and of iodine should be examined weekly. Ferrous sulphate solutions, if  acidulated with sulphuric acid, may be depended on for two or three  weeks without fresh standardising. Before filling the burette, the  \"Winchester\" bottle should be well shaken and a portion of about 50 or  100 c.c. poured into a dry beaker or test-glass. Besides the standard  solutions, which are required for titrating an assay, permanent  solutions of the metal or acid of equivalent strength are very useful.  When the finishing point of a titration has been overstepped (_i.e._,  the assay has been \"overdone\"), a measured volume, say 5 or 10 c.c., of  a solution containing the same metal may be added. The titration can  then be continued, but more cautiously, and the value in \"c.c.\" for the  quantity added be deducted from the final reading.    ~Standardising.~--Suppose the object is to standardise a solution of  permanganate similar to that referred to above. A convenient quantity of  iron (say 0.5 gram) would be weighed out, dissolved in dilute sulphuric  acid, and the solution titrated. Suppose 49.6 c.c. of the permanganate  solution are required, then            49.6 : 0.5 :: 100 : _x_                              _x_ = 1.008 gram.    This result, 1.008 gram, is the \"_standard_.\" When a gas is measured,  the standard may be calculated in the same way. For example: with 0.224  gram of zinc, 75.8 c.c. of gas were obtained. Then the quantity of zinc  equivalent to 100 c.c. of the gas is got by the proportion.            75.8 : 0.224 :: 100 : _x_                                _x_ = 0.2955 gram.    Using the term \"standard\" in this sense, the following rules hold  good:--    To find the weight of metal in a given substance:--_Multiply the  standard by the number of c.c. used and divide by 100._ For example: a  piece of zinc was dissolved and the gas evolved measured 73.9 c.c. Then  by the rule, 0.2955×73.9/100 should give the weight of the piece of  zinc. This gives 0.2184 gram.    To find the percentage of metal in a given substance:--_Multiply the  standard by the number of c.c. used and divide by the weight of  substance taken._ For example: if 2 grams of a mineral were taken, and  if on titrating with the permanganate solution (standard 1.008) 60.4  c.c. were required, then (1.008×60.4)/2 = 30.44. This is the  percentage.    If the standard is exactly 1 gram, and 1 gram of ore is always taken,  these calculations become very simple. The \"c.c.\" used give at once the  percentage, or divided by 100 give the weight of metal.    If it is desired to have a solution with a standard exactly 1.0 gram, it  is best first to make one rather stronger than this, and then to  standardise carefully. Divide 1000 by the standard thus obtained and the  result will be the number of c.c. which must be taken and be diluted  with water to 1 litre. For example: suppose the standard is 1.008, then  1000/1.008 gives 992, and if 992 c.c. be taken and diluted with water to  1000 c.c. a solution of the desired strength will be obtained. The  standard of this should be confirmed. A simpler calculation for the same  purpose is to multiply the standard by 1000; this will give the number  of c.c. to which 1 litre of the solution should be diluted. In the above  example a litre should be diluted to 1008 c.c.    It has been assumed in these rules that the titration has yielded  proportional results; but these are not always obtained. There can be no  doubt that in any actual re-action the proportion between any two  re-agents is a fixed one, and that if we double one of these then  exactly twice as much of the other will enter into the re-action; but in  the working it may very well be that no re-action at all will take place  until after a certain excess of one or of both of the re-agents is  present. In titrating lead with a chromate of potash solution, for  example, it is possible that at the end of the titration a small  quantity of the lead may remain unacted on; and it is certain that a  small excess of the chromate is present in the solution. So, too, in  precipitating a solution of silver with a standard solution of common  salt, a point is reached at which a small quantity of each remains in  solution; a further addition either of silver or of salt will cause a  precipitate, and a similar phenomenon has been observed in precipitating  a hydrochloric acid solution of a sulphate with baric chloride. The  excess of one or other of the re-agents may be large or small; or, in  some cases, they may neutralise each other. Considerations like these  emphasise the necessity for uniformity in the mode of working. Whether a  process yields proportional results, or not, will be seen from a series  of standardisings. Having obtained these, the results should be arranged  as in the table, placing the quantities of metal used in the order of  weight in the first column, the volumes measured in the second, and the  standards calculated in the third. If the results are proportional,  these standards will vary more or less, according to the delicacy of the  process, but there will be no apparent order in the variation. The  average of the standards should then be taken.      +-------------+---------------+----------+    |   Weight.   | Volume found. | Standard |    +-------------+---------------+----------+    | 0.2160 gram |   72.9 c.c.   |  0.2963  |    | 0.2185  \"   |   73.9  \"     |  0.2957  |    | 0.2365  \"   |   79.9  \"     |  0.2959  |    | 0.2440  \"   |   82.3  \"     |  0.2964  |    | 0.2555  \"   |   85.9  \"     |  0.2974  |    +-------------+---------------+----------+   "]]]
