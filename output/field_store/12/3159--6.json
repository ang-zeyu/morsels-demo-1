According to Oppert, the word       Memnon is the equivalent of the Susian Umman-anin, \"the       house of the king:\" Weissbach declares that \"anin\" does not       mean king, and contradicts Oppert's view, though he does not       venture to suggest a new explanation of the name.         ** _Gen._ xiv. Prom the outset Assyriologists have never       doubted the historical accuracy of this chapter, and they       have connected the facts which it contains with those which       seem to be revealed by the Assyrian monuments. The two       Rawlinsons intercalate Kudur-lagamar between Kudur-nakhunta       and Kudur-mabug, and Oppert places him about the same       period. Fr. Lenormant regards him as one of the successors       of Kudur-mabug, possibly his immediate successor. G. Smith       does not hesitate to declare positively that the Kudur-mabug       and Kudur-nakhunta of the inscriptions are one and the same       with the Kudur-lagamar (Chedor-laomer) of the Bible.       Finally, Schrader, while he repudiates Smith's view, agrees       in the main fact with the other Assyriologists. On the other       hand, the majority of modern Biblical critics have       absolutely refused to credit the story in Genesis. Sayce       thinks that the Bible story rests on an historic basis, and       his view is strongly confirmed by Pinches'discovery of a       Chaldaean document which mentions Kudur-lagamar and two of       his allies. The Hebrew historiographer reproduced an       authentic fact from the chronicles of Babylon, and connected       it with one of the events in the life of Abraham. The very       late date generally assigned to Gen. xiv. in no way       diminishes the intrinsic probability of the facts narrated       by the Chaldaean document which is preserved to us in the       pages of the Hebrew book.    In the thirteenth year of his reign over the East, the cities of the  Dead Sea--Sodom, Gomorrah, Adamah, Zeboim, and Bela--revolted against  him: he immediately convoked his great vassals, Amraphel of Chaldaea,  Arioch of Ellasar,* Tida'lo the Guti, and marched with them to the  confines of his dominions. Tradition has invested many of the tribes  then inhabiting Southern Syria with semi-mythical names and attributes.  They are represented as being giants--Rephalm; men of prodigious  strength--Zuzim; as having a buzzing and indistinct manner of  speech--Zamzummim; as formidable monsters**--Emim or Anakim, before  whom other nations appeared as grasshoppers;*** as the Horim who were  encamped on the confines of the Sinaitic desert, and as the Amalekites  who ranged over the mountains to the west of the Dead Sea. Kudur-lagamar  defeated them one after another--the Rephaim near to Ashtaroth-Karnaim,  the Zuzim near Ham,**** the Amim at Shaveh-Kiriathaim, and the Horim  on the spurs of Mount Seir as far as El-Paran; then retracing  his footsteps, he entered the country of the Amalekites by way of  En-mishpat, and pillaged the Amorites of Hazazon-Tamar.         * Ellasar has been identified with Larsa since the       researches of Rawlin-son and Norris; the Goim, over whom       Tidal was king, with the Guti.         ** Sayce considers Zuzim and Zamzummim to be two readings of       the same word Zamzum, written in cuneiform characters on the       original document. The sounds represented, in the Hebrew       alphabet, by the letters m and w, are expressed in the       Chaldaean syllabary by the same character, and a Hebrew or       Babylonian scribe, who had no other means of telling the       true pronunciation of a race-name mentioned in the story of       this campaign, would have been quite as much at a loss as       any modern scholar to say whether he ought to transcribe the       word as Z-m-z-m or as Z-w-z-vo; some scribes read it       _Zuzim,_ others preferred _Zamzummim._         *** _Numb._ xiii. 33.         **** In Deut. ii. 20 it is stated that the Zamzummim lived       in the country of Ammon. Sayce points out that we often find       the variant Am for the character usually read _Ham_ or       _Kham_--the name Khammurabi, for instance, is often found       written Ammurabi; the Ham in the narrative of Genesis would,       therefore, be identical with the land of Ammon in       Deuteronomy, and the difference between the spelling of the       two would be due to the fact that the document reproduced in       the XIVIIth chapter of Genesis had been originally copied from       a cuneiform tablet in which the name of the place was       expressed by the sign _Ham-Am._    In the mean time, the kings of the five towns had concentrated their  troops in the vale of Siddim, and were there resolutely awaiting  Kudur-lagamar. They were, however, completely routed, some of the  fugitives being swallowed up in the pits of bitumen with which the  soil abounded, while others with difficulty reached the mountains.  Kudur-lagamar sacked Sodom and Gomorrah, re-established his dominion on  all sides, and returned laden with booty, Hebrew tradition adding  that he was overtaken near the sources of the Jordan by the patriarch  Abraham.*         * An attempt has been made to identify the three vassals of       Kudur-lagamar with kings mentioned on the Chaldaean       monuments. Tidcal, or, if we adopt the Septuagint variant,       Thorgal, has been considered by some as the bearer of a       Sumorian name, Turgal= \"great chief,\" \"great son,\" while       others put him on one side as not having been a Babylonian;       Pinches, Sayce, and Hommel identify him with Tudkhula, an       ally of Kudur-lagamar against Khammurabi. Schrader was the       first to suggest that Amraphel was really Khammurabi, and       emended the Amraphel of the biblical text into Amraphi or       Amrabi, in order to support this identification. Halevy,       while on the whole accepting this theory, derives the name       from the pronunciation Kimtarapashtum or Kimtarapaltum,       which he attributes to the name generally read Khammurabi,       and in this he is partly supported by Hommel, who reads       \"Khammurapaltu.\"    After his victory over Kudur-lagamar, Khammurabi assumed the title of  King of Martu,* which we find still borne by Ammisatana sixty years  later.** We see repeated here almost exactly what took place in Ethiopia  at the time of its conquest by Egypt: merchants had prepared the way for  military occupation, and the civilization of Babylon had taken hold  on the people long before its kings had become sufficiently powerful  to claim them as vassals. The empire may be said to have been virtually  established from the day when the states of the Middle and Lower  Euphrates formed but one kingdom in the hands of a single ruler. We must  not, however, imagine it to have been a compact territory, divided into  provinces under military occupation, ruled by a uniform code of laws  and statutes, and administered throughout by functionaries of various  grades, who received their orders from Babylon or Susa, according as  the chances of war favoured the ascendency of Chaldaea or Elam. It was  in reality a motley assemblage of tribes and principalities, whose sole  bond of union was subjection to a common yoke.         * It is, indeed, the sole title which he attributes to       himself on a stone tablet now in the British Museum.         ** In an inscription by this prince, copied probably about       the time of Nabonidus by the scribe Belushallim, he is       called \"king of the vast land of Martu.\"    They were under obligation to pay tribute, and furnish military  contingents and show other external marks of obedience, but their  particular constitution, customs, and religion were alike respected:  they had to purchase, at the cost of a periodical ransom, the right to  live in their own country after their own fashion, and the head of the  empire forbore all interference in their affairs, except in cases where  the internecine quarrels and dissensions threatened the security of his  suzerainty. Their subordination lasted as best it could, sometimes for a  year or for ten years, at the end of which period they would neglect  the obligations of their vassalage, or openly refuse to fulfil them:  a revolt would then break out at one point or another, and it was  necessary to suppress it without delay to prevent the bad example  from spreading far and wide. The empire was maintained by perpetual  re-conquests, and its extent varied with the energy shown by its chiefs,  or with the resources which were for the moment available.    Separated from the confines of the empire by only a narrow isthmus,  Egypt loomed on the horizon, and appeared to beckon to her rival. Her  natural fertility, the industry of her inhabitants, the stores of gold  and perfumes which she received from the heart of Ethiopia, were well  known by the passage to and fro of her caravans, and the recollection of  her treasures must have frequently provoked the envy of Asiatic courts.  Egypt had, however, strangely declined from her former greatness, and  the line of princes who governed her had little in common with the  Pharaohs who had rendered her name so formidable under the XIIth  dynasty. She was now under the rule of the Xoites, whose influence was  probably confined to the Delta, and extended merely in name over  the Said and Nubia. The feudal lords, ever ready to reassert their  independence as soon as the central power waned, shared between them the  possession of the Nile valley below Memphis: the princes of Thebes, who  were probably descendants of Usirtasen, owned the largest fiefdom, and  though some slight scruple may have prevented them from donning  the pschent or placing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17325"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 5 (of 12) (#11)"],[1,"by the Pharaohs in their journeys into  Asia, such as the Bubastite and Athribite nomes; the rest remained sunk  in their ancient torpor.*    * Mariette and E. de Rouge, attribute this torpor, at least as far as  Tanis is concerned, to the aversion felt by the Pharaohs of Egyptian  blood for the Hyksos capital, and for the provinces where the invaders  had formerly established themselves in large numbers.    Beyond the Red Sea the mines were actively worked, and even the oases of  the Libyan desert took part in the national revival, and buildings rose  in their midst of a size proportionate to their slender revenues. Thebes  naturally came in for the largest share of the spoils of war. Although  her kings had become the rulers of the world, they had not, like the  Pharaohs of the XIIth and XIIIth dynasties, forsaken her for some more  illustrious city: here they had their ordinary residence as well as  their seat of government, hither they returned after each campaign to  celebrate their victory, and hither they sent the prisoners and the  spoil which they had reserved for their own royal use. In the course  of one or two generations Thebes had spread in every direction, and had  enclosed within her circuit the neighbouring villages of Ashiru, the  fief of Maiit, and Apit-risifc, the southern Thebes, which lay at the  confluence of the Nile with one of the largest of the canals which  watered the plain. The monuments in these two new quarters of the town  were unworthy of the city of which they now formed part, and Amenothes  III. consequently bestowed much pains on improving them. He entirely  rebuilt the sanctuary of Maut, enlarged the sacred lake, and collected  within one of the courts of the temple several hundred statues in black  granite of the Memphite divinity, the lioness-headed Sokhit, whom he  identified with his Theban goddess. The statues were crowded together so  closely that they were in actual contact with each other in places, and  must have presented something of the appearance of a regiment drawn up  in battle array. The succeeding Pharaohs soon came to look upon this  temple as a kind of storehouse, whence they might provide themselves  with ready-made figures to decorate their buildings either at Thebes or  in other royal cities. About a hundred of them, however, still remain,  most of them without feet, arms, or head; some over-turned on the  ground, others considerably out of the perpendicular, from the earth  having given way beneath them, and a small number only still perfect and  in situ.

[Illustration: 067.jpg PART OF THE AVENUE OF RAMS, BETWEEN THE TEMPLES  OF AMON AND MAUT]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Beato.    At Luxor Amenothes demolished the small temple with which the sovereigns  of the XIIth and XIIIth dynasties had been satisfied, and replaced it by  a structure which is still one of the finest yet remaining of the times  of the Pharaohs. The naos rose sheer above the waters of the Nile,  indeed its cornices projected over the river, and a staircase at the  south side allowed the priests and devotees to embark directly from  the rear of the building. The sanctuary was a single chamber, with an  opening on its side, but so completely shut out from the daylight by the  long dark hall at whose extremity it was placed as to be in perpetual  obscurity. It was flanked by narrow, dimly lightly chambers, and was  approached through a pronaos with four rows of columns, a vast court  surrounded with porticoes occupying the foreground. At the present time  the thick walls which enclosed the entire building are nearly level  with the ground, half the ceilings have crumbled away, air and light  penetrate into every nook, and during the inundation the water flowing  into the courts, transformed them until recently into lakes, whither the  flocks and herds of the village resorted in the heat of the day to bathe  or quench their thirst. Pictures of mysterious events never meant for  the public gaze now display their secrets in the light of the sun, and  reveal to the eyes of the profane the supernatural events which preceded  the birth of the king. On the northern side an avenue of sphinxes and  crio-sphinxes led to the gates of old Thebes. At present most of these  creatures are buried under the ruins of the modern town, or covered by  the earth which overlies the ancient road; but a few are still visible,  broken and shapeless from barbarous usage, and hardly retaining any  traces of the inscriptions in which Amenothes claimed them boastingly as  his work.    [Illustration: 069.jpg THE PYLONS OF THUTMOSIS III. AND HARMHABI AT  KAKNAK]    Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Beato.    Triumphal processions passing along this route from Luxor to Karnak  would at length reach the great court before the temple of Amon, or, by  turning a little to the right after passing the temple of Maut, would  arrive in front of the southern facade, near the two gilded obelisks  whose splendour once rejoiced the heart of the famous Hatshopsitu.  Thutmosis III. was also determined on his part to spare no expense to  make the temple of his god of proportions suitable to the patron of  so vast an empire. Not only did he complete those portions which his  predecessors had merely sketched out, but on the south side towards  Ashiru he also built a long row of pylons, now half ruined, on which he  engraved, according to custom, the list of nations and cities which he  had subdued in Asia and Africa. To the east of the temple he rebuilt  some ancient structures, the largest of which served as a halting-place  for processions, and he enclosed the whole with a stone rampart. The  outline of the sacred lake, on which the mystic boats were launched on  the nights of festivals, was also made more symmetrical, and its margin  edged with masonry.    [Illustration: 070.jpg SACRED LAKE AKD THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE TEMPLE  OF KARNAK.]         Drawn by Boucher, from a photograph by Boato: the building       near the centre of the picture is the covered walk       constructed by Thutmosis III.    By these alterations the harmonious proportion between the main  buildings and the facade had been destroyed, and the exterior wall was  now too wide for the pylon at the entrance. Amenothes III. remedied this  defect by erecting in front a fourth pylon, which was loftier, larger,  and in all respects more worthy to stand before the enlarged temple.  Its walls were partially covered with battle-scenes, which informed all  beholders of the glory of the conqueror.*         * Portions of the military bas-reliefs which covered the       exterior face of the pylon are still to be seen through the       gaps in the wall at the end of the great Hall of Pillars       built by Seti I. and Ramses II.    Progress had been no less marked on the left bank of the river. As long  as Thebes had been merely a small provincial town, its cemeteries had  covered but a moderate area, including the sandy plain and low mounds  opposite Karnak and the valley of Deir el-Bahari beyond; but now that  the city had more than doubled its extent, the space required for the  dead was proportionately greater. The tombs of private persons began to  spread towards the south, and soon reached the slopes of the Assassif,  the hill of Sheikh-Abd-el-Qurnah and the district of Qurnet-Murrai--in  fact, all that part which the people of the country called the \"Brow\"  of Thebes. On the borders of the cultivated land a row of chapels and  mastabas with pyramidal roofs sheltered the remains of the princes and  princesses of the royal family. The Pharaohs themselves were buried  either separately under their respective brick pyramids or in groups in  a temple, as was the case with the first three Thutmosis and Hatshopsitu  at Deir el-Bahari. Amenothes II. and Thutmosis IV. could doubtless have  found room in this crowded necropolis,* although the space was becoming  limited, but the pride of the Pharaohs began to rebel against this  promiscuous burial side by side with their subjects. Amenothes III.  sought for a site, therefore, where he would have ample room to display  his magnificence, far from the vulgar crowd, and found what he desired  at the farther end of the valley which opens out behind the village of  Qurnah. Here, an hour's journey from the bank of the Nile, he cut for  himself a magnificent rock-tomb with galleries, halls, and deep pits,  the walls being decorated with representations of the Voyage of the Sun  through the regions which he traverses during the twelve hours of his  nocturnal course.         * The generally received opinion is that these sovereigns of       the XVIIIth dynasty were buried in the Biban el-Moluk, but I       have made several examinations of this valley, and cannot       think that this was the case. On the contrary, the scattered       notices in the fragments of papyrus preserved at Turin seem       to me to indicate that Amenothes II. and Thutmosis IV. must       have been buried in the neighbourhood of the Assassif or of       Deir el-Bahari.    A sarcophagus of red granite received his mummy, and _Ushabti's_ of  extraordinary dimensions and admirable workmanship mounted guard around  him, so as to release him from the corvee in the fields of Ialu.  The chapel usually attached to such tombs is not to be found in the  neighbourhood. As the road to the funeral valley was a difficult one,  and as it would be"]]]
