In addition to these expenses there is the Endowment Fund  already referred to, and for this the munificent donors intend to set  apart a sum to which the above amount bears but a small proportion. So  that altogether the community will be indebted to them for an  educational foundation worth a magnificent figure in money value  alone, while besides this, we must not forget the long years of  thoughtful care and of self-denying energy involved in maturing these  splendid projects, or the healthy mental and moral stimulus which the  conduct of these patriotic gentlemen has supplied.    PRESENTATION OF PORTRAITS.    A very pleasing ceremony took place on Wednesday, December 17th, 1884,  at St. Julian's Hall, when His Excellency Major-General Sarel, C.B.,  Lieut.-Governor, presented Messrs. Guille and Alles with their  portraits on behalf of a numerous body of subscribers resident in all  parts of the island, and also in Paris, New York, and Brooklyn. A  public meeting had been called on the 4th of February previous, when  an influential Committee was appointed; about L227 was speedily  raised, and then Mr. Frank Brooks was commissioned to paint two  life-size portraits in oil, which gave great satisfaction when  finished, and are now hung in the Library. Julius Carey, Esq., Chief  Constable (Mayor) of St. Peter-Port, as President of the Portrait  Committee, opened the proceedings, by briefly narrating the  circumstances which had called the meeting together.    His Excellency then, after a few preliminary remarks, said:--         He must express the very great pleasure which he felt in       being present on such an interesting occasion, when the       whole community were testifying their appreciation of the       noble Library which had been founded for their benefit.       Indeed he felt it a great honour to have been asked to       present these handsome portraits to Messrs. Guille and       Alles. It would not be necessary for him to dwell at any       length on the antecedents of these gentlemen, who were       well-known in the island. Many years ago Mr. Guille went to       the United States, and there he found the advantages which       accrued from having access to a good library. He then       conceived the idea of one day bestowing a similar boon upon       his own native island, and this project he had been happily       spared to carry out. During his exile the thought had       remained ever with him; he had not allowed business to       engross all his attention; and now that he had returned once       more to settle down in the little rock-bound island-home of       his youth, he was reducing to practice the beneficent plans       of earlier years. He was not content to lead a life of ease       with the produce of his industry, but he had founded an       institution of incalculable value for the moral and       intellectual welfare of the isle. Then there was another       large-hearted Guernseyman, Mr. Alles, who determined that       his old friend Mr. Guille should not be left to carry out       his noble scheme alone. They had long been associated in       business enterprises, and they were now linked in the higher       bond of a common desire for the well-being of their       fellow-citizens. All honour to them for it. The Library told       its own story and needed no encomium. All it wanted was       constant readers and plenty of them, and he could not too       strongly impress upon the people--and especially upon the       rising generation--the immense advantages they would derive       from availing themselves of its literary treasures. In       conclusion, it simply remained for him, on behalf of the       Committee and the Subscribers, to ask Messrs. Guille and       Alles to accept these paintings, which would show to future       generations of Guernseymen the form and features of two       public benefactors who had deserved so well of their country       and their kind.    Mr. Guille, in response, gave a very interesting address in English,  and Mr. Alles followed with an equally appropriate and practical  speech in French, both gentlemen being received with prolonged  applause, and listened to by the numerous assembly with the most  interested attention.    Brief complimentary addresses were then delivered by Edgar MacCulloch,  Esq., F.S.A., Bailiff (Chief Magistrate) of Guernsey, and by F.J.  Jeremie, Esq., M.A., Jurat of the Royal Court, and the proceedings  terminated with a hearty vote of thanks to the Lieut.-Governor,  proposed by the Very Rev. Carey Brock, M.A., Dean of Guernsey.    A brass plate attached to Mr. Guille's portrait bears the following  inscription:--    Presented to THOMAS GUILLE, Esq.,  by his numerous friends, in recognition of the great  benefit he has conferred upon the inhabitants of his  native Island as one of the Founders of the  Guille-Alles Library.    Guernsey, 17 December, 1884.    A similar plate, bearing the name of Mr. Frederick Mansell Alles, is  attached to his portrait.         Note.--The Assembly Rooms were built by private subscription       in 1782, at a cost of about L2,500, and had therefore been       in existence exactly a century when they passed into the       hands of Messrs. Guille and Alles in 1882. During this long       period they were the fashionable _foyer_ of the Island's       festivity and gaiety, and formed the scene of many a       brilliant gathering.           *       *       *       *       *    A.

FRANCOIS, FRENCH PROFESSOR.  MISS LANE, AFTERNOON JUNIOR CLASS.    The object Mr. Chamberlain has in view is to supply a thoroughly  liberal Education. The general School Course comprises Biblical  History, Ancient History, the History and Literature of our own  Country; the Greek, Latin and French Languages; Geometrical,  Isometrical, Architectural and Landscape Drawing; Euclid, Algebra and  Trigonometry; Navigation, Geography and Mapping; the use of the  Globes, both table and high-standing; Land Surveying, Mensuration,  Book-keeping, English Grammar, Composition with Precis-writing and  Analysis; and such branches of Natural Science as it may be  practicable from time to time to introduce into the School teaching.    The classification of the School, and the System adopted, secure all  the advantages of emulation and honourable rivalry.    THE SCHOOL OF SCIENCE DEPARTMENT.--Familiar Lectures are  given occasionally during the Winter Months on Electricity, Galvanism,  Magnetism, Chemistry, Telegraphy and Printing.    ELECTRICITY.--Is shown and explained by the use of a large  Plate Glass Electrifying Machine, next in size smaller than the one at  the Royal Polytechnic, with all the apparatus required.    CHEMISTRY.--The Elucidation of Principles and the explanation  of Chemical Phenomena are made as clear and concise as possible, by  many experiments.    MAGNETISM.--This is so very instructive a branch of Science  that many experiments are well understood by the Pupils, both in the  use of the Natural Magnet and the Electro-Magnet.    GALVANISM.--There are several Galvanic Batteries in use, so  that the Boys accustomed to them can readily apply a particular sort  to any experiment.    TELEGRAPHY.--Communication is carried on at any distance  chosen, or from one part of the house to another.    PRINTING.--This is likewise thoroughly explained by the use  of a Press and all the apparatus attached, including several cases of  Type.    Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, having full command of the School of Science  Department, is enabled, without engaging the services of Professional  Men (who generally make a very high charge), to give suitable Lectures  without increasing the Fees as contained below.    Parents will thus see that the lectures _being both amusing and  instructive_ must be conducive to the _expansion of the mind_, at the  same time making an _agreeable change_ in the general School routine.

Perrault says of his collection that it is certain these stories excite  in the children who read them the desire to resemble those characters  who become happy, and at the same time they inspire them with the fear  of the consequences which happen to those who do ill deeds; and he  claims that they all contain a very distinct moral which is more or less  evident to all who read them.    Emerson says: \"What Nature at one time provides for use, she afterwards  turns to ornament,\" and Herbert Spencer, following out this idea,  remarks that \"the fairy lore, which in times past was matter of grave  belief and held sway over people's conduct, has since been transformed  into ornament for _The Midsummer Night's Dream_, _The Tempest_, _The  Fairy Queen_, and endless small tales and poems; and still affords  subjects for children's story books, amuses boys and girls, and becomes  matter for jocose allusion.\"    Thus, also, Sir Walter Scott, in a note to \"The Lady of the Lake,\" says:  \"The mythology of one period would appear to pass into the romance of  the next, and that into the nursery tales of subsequent ages,\" and Max  Mueller, in his \"Chips from a German Workshop,\" says: \"The gods of  ancient mythology were changed into the demigods and heroes of ancient  epic poetry, and these demigods again became at a later age the  principal characters of our nursery tales.\"    These thoughts may help to a better understanding of some of the uses of  such stories and of their proper place in children's reading.
