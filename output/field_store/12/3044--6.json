But sea depths are not  measured when the ocean rages, nor can absolute justice be determined  while public opinion is lashed into fury. There must be calmness to insure  correctness of judgment. The fury of the hour must abate before we can  deal justly with any man or any cause.    That Charles was not a desperado is amply shown by the discussion in the  preceding chapter. The darkest pictures which the reporters could paint of  Charles were quoted freely, so that the public might find upon what  grounds the press declared him to be a lawbreaker. Unquestionably the  grounds are wholly insufficient. Not a line of evidence has been presented  to prove that Charles was the fiend which the first reports of the New  Orleans charge him to be.    Nothing more should be required to establish his good reputation, for the  rule is universal that a reputation must be assumed to be good until it is  proved bad. But that rule does not apply to the Negro, for as soon as he  is suspected the public judgment immediately determines that he is guilty  of whatever crime he stands charged. For this reason, as a matter of duty  to the race, and the simple justice to the memory of Charles, an  investigation has been made of the life and character of Charles before  the fatal affray which led to his death.    Robert Charles was not an educated man. He was a student who faithfully  investigated all the phases of oppression from which his race has  suffered. That he was a student is amply shown by the _Times-Democrat_  report of the twenty-fifth, which says:    \"Well-worn textbooks, bearing his name written in his own scrawling  handwriting, and well-filled copy-books found in his trunk, showed that he  had burned the midnight oil, and desired to improve himself intellectually  in order that he might conquer the hated white race.\" From this quotation  it will be seen that he spent the hours after days of hard toil in trying  to improve himself, both in the study of textbooks and in writing.    He knew that he was a student of a problem which required all the  intelligence that a man could command, and he was burning his midnight  oil gathering knowledge that he might better be able to come to an  intelligent solution. To his aid in the study of this problem he sought  the aid of a Christian newspaper, the _Voice of Missions_, the organ of  the African Methodist Episcopal Church. He was in communication with its  editor, who is a bishop, and is known all over this country as a man of  learning, a lover of justice and the defender of law and order. Charles  could receive from Bishop Turner not a word of encouragement to be other  than an earnest, tireless and God-fearing student of the complex problems  which affected the race.    For further help and assistance in his studies, Charles turned to an  organization which has existed and flourished for many years, at all times  managed by men of high Christian standing and absolute integrity. These  men believe and preach a doctrine that the best interests of the Negro  will be subserved by an emigration from America back to the Fatherland,  and they do all they can to spread the doctrine of emigration and to give  material assistance to those who desire to leave America and make their  future homes in Africa. This organization is known as \"The International  Migration Society.\" It has its headquarters in Birmingham, Alabama. From  this place it issues pamphlets, some of which were found, in the home of  Robert Charles, and which pamphlets the reporters of the New Orleans  papers declare to be incendiary and dangerous in their doctrine and  teaching.    Nothing could be further from the truth. Copies of any and all of them may  be secured by writing to D.J. Flummer, who is President and in charge of  the home office in Birmingham, Alabama. Three of the pamphlets found in  Charles's room are named respectively:    First, _Prospectus of the Liberian Colonization Society_; which pamphlet  in a few brief pages tells of the work of the society, plans, prices and  terms of transportation of colored people who choose to go to Africa.  These pages are followed by a short, conservative discussion of the Negro  question, and close with an argument that Africa furnishes the best asylum  for the oppressed Negroes in this country.    The second pamphlet is entitled _Christian Civilization of Africa_. This  is a brief statement of the advantages of the Republic of Liberia, and an  argument in support of the superior conditions which colored people may  attain to by leaving the South and settling in Liberia.    The third pamphlet is entitled _The Negro and Liberia_. This is a larger  document than the other two, and treats more exhaustively the question of  emigration, but from the first page to the last there is not an  incendiary line or sentence. There is not even a suggestion of violence in  all of its thirty-two pages, and not a word which could not be preached  from every pulpit in the land.    If it is true that the workman is known by his tools, certainly no harm  could ever come from the doctrines which were preached by Charles or the  papers and pamphlets distributed by him. Nothing ever written in the  _Voice of Missions_, and nothing ever published in the pamphlets above  alluded to in the remotest way suggest that a peaceable man should turn  lawbreaker, or that any man should dye his hands in his brother's blood.    In order to secure as far as possible positive information about the life  and character of Robert Charles, it was plain that the best course to  pursue was to communicate with those with whom he had sustained business  relations. Accordingly a letter was forwarded to Mr. D.J. Flummer, who is  president of the colonization society, in which letter he was asked to  state in reply what information he had of the life and character of Robert  Charles. The result was a very prompt letter in response, the text of  which is as follows:      Birmingham, Ala., Aug. 21, 1900      Mrs. Ida B. Wells Barnett, Chicago, Ill.:      Dear Madam--Replying to your favor of recent date requesting me to write    you giving such information as I may have concerning the life, habits    and character of Robert Charles, who recently shot and killed police    officers in New Orleans, I wish to say that my knowledge of him is only    such as I have gained from his business connection with the    International Migration Society during the past five or six years,    during which time I was president of the society.      He having learned that the purpose of this society was to colonize the    colored people in Liberia, West Africa, and thereby lessen or destroy    the friction and prejudice existing in this country between the two    races, set about earnestly and faithfully distributing the literature    that we issued from time to time. He always appeared to be mild but    earnest in his advocacy of emigration, and never to my knowledge used    any method or means that would in the least appear unreasonable, and had    always kept within the bounds of law and order in advocating emigration.      The work he performed for this society was all gratuitous, and    apparently prompted from his love of humanity, and desires to be    instrumental in building up a Negro Nationality in Africa.      If he ever violated a law before the killing of the policemen, I do not    know of it.      Yours, very truly,      D.J. Flummer    Besides this statement, Mr. Flummer enclosed a letter received by the  Society two days before the tragedy at New Orleans. This letter was  written by Robert Charles, and it attests his devotion to the cause of  emigration which he had espoused. Memoranda on the margin of the letter  show that the order was filled by mailing the pamphlets. It is very  probable that these were the identical pamphlets which were found by the  mob which broke into the room of Robert Charles and seized upon these  harmless documents and declared they were sufficient evidence to prove  Charles a desperado. In the light of subsequent events the letter of  Charles, which follows, sounds like a voice from the tomb:    New Orleans, July 30,1900      Mr. D.J. Flummer:      Dear Sir--I received your last pamphlets and they are all given out. I    want you to send me some more, and I enclose you the stamps. I think I    will go over in Greenville, Miss., and give my people some pamphlets    over there.      Yours truly,      Robert Charles    The latest word of information comes from New Orleans from a man who knew  Charles intimately for six years. For obvious reasons, his name is  withheld. In answer to a letter sent him he answers as follows:      New Orleans, Aug. 23, 1900      Mrs. Ida B. Wells-Barnett:      Dear Madam--It affords me great pleasure to inform you as far as I know    of Robert Charles. I have been acquainted with him about six years in    this city. He never has, as I know, given any trouble to anyone. He was    quiet and a peaceful man and was very frank in speaking. He was too much    of a hero to die; few call be found to equal him. I am very sorry to    say that I do not know anything of his birthplace, nor his parents, but    enclosed find letter from his uncle, from which you may find more    information. You will also find one of the circulars in which Charles    was in possession of which was styled as a crazy document. Let me say,    until our preachers preach this document we will always be slaves. If    you can help circulate this \"crazy\" doctrine I would be glad to have you    do so, for I shall never rest until I get to that heaven on earth; that    is, the west coast of Africa, in Liberia.      With best wishes to you I still remain, as always, for the good of the    race,      ----    By only those whose anger and vindictiveness warp their judgment is Robert  Charles a desperado. Their word is not supported by the statement of a  single fact which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14977"],[0,"The Red Record (#11)"],[1," ten minutes after he was strung    up the chest heaved occasionally, and there were convulsive movements of    the limbs. Finally he was pronounced dead, and a few minutes later    Detective Richardson climbed on a pile of staves and cut the rope. The    body fell in a ghastly heap, and the crowd laughed at the sound and    crowded around the prostrate body, a few kicking the inanimate carcass.      Detective Richardson, who is also a deputy coroner, then proceeded to    impanel the following jury of inquest: J.S. Moody, A.C. Waldran, B.J.    Childs, J.N. House, Nelson Bills, T.L. Smith, and A. Newhouse. After    viewing the body the inquest was adjourned without any testimony being    taken until 9 o'clock this morning. The jury will meet at the coroner's    office, 51 Beale Street, upstairs, and decide on a verdict. If no    witnesses are forthcoming, the jury will be able to arrive at a verdict    just the same, as all members of it saw the lynching. Then someone    raised the cry of \"Burn him!\" It was quickly taken up and soon resounded    from a hundred throats. Detective Richardson, for a long time,    single-handed, stood the crowd off. He talked and begged the men not to    bring disgrace on the city by burning the body, arguing that all the    vengeance possible had been wrought.      While this was going on a small crowd was busy starting a fire in the    middle of the street. The material was handy. Some bundles of staves    were taken from the adjoining lumber yard for kindling. Heavier wood was    obtained from the same source, and coal oil from a neighboring grocery.    Then the cries of \"Burn him! Burn him!\" were redoubled.      Half a dozen men seized the naked body. The crowd cheered. They marched    to the fire, and giving the body a swing, it was landed in the middle of    the fire. There was a cry for more wood, as the fire had begun to die    owing to the long delay. Willing hands procured the wood, and it was    piled up on the Negro, almost, for a time, obscuring him from view. The    head was in plain view, as also were the limbs, and one arm which stood    out high above the body, the elbow crooked, held in that position by a    stick of wood. In a few moments the hands began to swell, then came    great blisters over all the exposed parts of the body; then in places    the flesh was burned away and the bones began to show through. It was a    horrible sight, one which, perhaps, none there had ever witnessed    before. It proved too much for a large part of the crowd and the    majority of the mob left very shortly after the burning began.      But a large number stayed, and were not a bit set back by the sight of a    human body being burned to ashes. Two or three white women, accompanied    by their escorts, pushed to the front to obtain an unobstructed view,    and looked on with astonishing coolness and nonchalance. One man and    woman brought a little girl, not over twelve years old, apparently their    daughter, to view a scene which was calculated to drive sleep from the    child's eyes for many nights, if not to produce a permanent injury to    her nervous system. The comments of the crowd were varied. Some remarked    on the efficacy of this style of cure for rapists, others rejoiced that    men's wives and daughters were now safe from this wretch. Some laughed    as the flesh cracked and blistered, and while a large number pronounced    the burning of a dead body as a useless episode, not in all that throng    was a word of sympathy heard for the wretch himself.      The rope that was used to hang the Negro, and also that which was used    to lead him from the jail, were eagerly sought by relic hunters. They    almost fought for a chance to cut off a piece of rope, and in an    incredibly short time both ropes had disappeared and were scattered in    the pockets of the crowd in sections of from an inch to six inches long.    Others of the relic hunters remained until the ashes cooled to obtain    such ghastly relics as the teeth, nails, and bits of charred skin of the    immolated victim of his own lust. After burning the body the mob tied a    rope around the charred trunk and dragged it down Main Street to the    courthouse, where it was hanged to a center pole. The rope broke and the    corpse dropped with a thud, but it was again hoisted, the charred legs    barely touching the ground. The teeth were knocked out and the    fingernails cut off as souvenirs. The crowd made so much noise that the    police interfered. Undertaker Walsh was telephoned for, who took    charge of the body and carried it to his establishment, where it will be    prepared for burial in the potter's field today.    [Illustration: Scene of lynching at Clanton, Alabama, August 1891.]    [Illustration: Facsimile of back of photograph. W.R. MARTIN, Traveling  Photographer. (Handwritten: This S.O.B. was hung at Clanton Ala. Friday  Aug 21st/91 for murdering a little boy in cold blood for 35c in cash. He  is a good specimen of your \"Black Christian hung by White Heathens\"  [illegible] of the Committee.)]    A prelude to this exhibition of nineteenth-century barbarism was the  following telegram received by the _Chicago Inter Ocean_, at 2 o'clock,  Saturday afternoon--ten hours before the lynching:      MEMPHIS TENN., July 22, To _Inter-Ocean_, Chicago.      Lee Walker, colored man, accused of raping white women, in jail here,    will be taken out and burned by whites tonight. Can you send Miss Ida    Wells to write it up? Answer. R.M. Martin, with _Public Ledger_.    The _Public Ledger_ is one of the oldest evening daily papers in Memphis,  and this telegram shows that the intentions of the mob were well known  long before they were executed. The personnel of the mob is given by the  _Memphis Appeal-Avalanche_. It says, \"At first it seemed as if a crowd of  roughs were the principals, but as it increased in size, men in all walks  of life figured as leaders, although the majority were young men.\"    This was the punishment meted out to a Negro, charged, not with rape, but  attempted assault, and without any proof as to his guilt, for the women  were not given a chance to identify him. It was only a little less  horrible than the burning alive of Henry Smith, at Paris, Texas, February  1, 1893, or that of Edward Coy, in Texarkana, Texas, February 20, 1892.  Both were charged with assault on white women, and both were tied to the  stake and burned while yet alive, in the presence of ten thousand persons.  In the case of Coy, the white woman in the case applied the match, even  while the victim protested his innocence.    The cut which is here given is the exact reproduction of the photograph  taken at the scene of the lynching at Clanton, Alabama, August, 1891. The  cause for which the man was hanged is given in the words of the mob which  were written on the back of the photograph, and they are also given. This  photograph was sent to Judge A.W. Tourgee, of Mayville, N.Y.    In some of these cases the mob affects to believe in the Negro's guilt.  The world is told that the white woman in the case identifies him, or the  prisoner \"confesses.\" But in the lynching which took place in Barnwell  County, South Carolina, April 24, 1893, the mob's victim, John Peterson,  escaped and placed himself under Governor Tillman's protection; not only  did he declare his innocence, but offered to prove an alibi, by white  witnesses. Before his witnesses could be brought, the mob arrived at the  Governor's mansion and demanded the prisoner. He was given up, and  although the white woman in the case said he was not the man, he was  hanged twenty-four hours after, and over a thousand bullets fired into his  body, on the declaration that \"a crime had been committed and someone had  to hang for it.\"          6    HISTORY OF SOME CASES OF RAPE      It has been claimed that the Southern white women have been slandered  because, in defending the Negro race from the charge that all colored men,  who are lynched, only pay penalty for assaulting women. It is certain that  lynching mobs have not only refused to give the Negro a chance to defend  himself, but have killed their victim with a full knowledge that the  relationship of the alleged assailant with the woman who accused him, was  voluntary and clandestine. As a matter of fact, one of the prime causes of  the Lynch Law agitation has been a necessity for defending the Negro from  this awful charge against him. This defense has been necessary because the  apologists for outlawry insist that in no case has the accusing woman been  a willing consort of her paramour, who is lynched because overtaken in  wrong. It is well known, however, that such is the case. In July of this  year, 1894, John Paul Bocock, a Southern white man living in New York, and  assistant editor of the _New York Tribune_, took occasion to defy the  publication of any instance where the lynched Negro was the victim of a  white woman's falsehood. Such cases are not rare, but the press and people  conversant with the facts, almost invariably suppress them.    The _New York Sun_ of July 30,1894, contained a synopsis of interviews  with leading congressmen and editors of the South. Speaker Crisp, of the  House of Representatives, who was recently a Judge of the Supreme Court of  Georgia, led in declaring that lynching seldom or never took place, save  for vile crime against women and children. Dr. Hass, editor of the leading  organ of the Methodist Church South, published in its columns that it was  his belief that more than three hundred women had been assaulted by Negro  men within three months. When asked to prove his charges, or give a single  case upon which his \"belief\" was founded, he said that he could do so, but  the details were unfit for publication. No other evidence but his \"belief\"  could be adduced to substantiate this grave charge, yet Bishop Haygood, in  the _Forum_ of October, 1893, quotes"]]]
