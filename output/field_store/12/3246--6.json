It was the wild rage with which the English buccaneers fought that  was the secret of their success. The Spaniards are a people given  to ceremony, and even in matters of battle are somewhat formal and  pedantic. The combat, then, between them and the English, was one  which presented no familiar conditions to their minds. These rough  sailors, hardened by exposure, skilled in the use of arms, were no  doubt formidable enough, individually; but this alone would not  have intimidated the Spaniards, or have gone any great distance  towards equalizing the tremendous odds between them.    It was the fury with which they fought that was the secret of their  success. It was as when a cat, furious with passion, flies at a dog  many times larger and heavier than itself. The latter may be as  brave, in many matters, as the cat; and ready to face a creature  much larger even than itself, under ordinary circumstances. It is  the fury of the cat which appalls, and turns it into a very coward.    Thus, when the band of English fell upon the Spaniards in the  galleon--who were some six times as numerous as themselves--naked  to the waist, with hair streaming back, with all their faces wild  with pain, brandishing their heavy axes, and with a shout rushed  upon their foes drawn up in regular order; the latter, after a  moment or two of resistance, began rapidly to fall back. Their  officers, in vain, shouted to them to stand firm. In vain they  taunted them with falling back before a handful of men. In vain  even turned their swords against their own soldiers.    It was useless. Those in front, unable indeed to retreat, were cut  down by the heavy axes. Those behind recoiled, and after but a few  minutes' fighting, some began to leap down the hatchways; and  although the fight continued for a short time, isolated groups here  and there making resistance, the battle was virtually won in five  minutes after the English appeared on deck. The captain and his two  principal officers were killed, fighting bravely; and had their  efforts been in any way backed by those of their men, they would  have made short work of the assailants.    Captain Drake's voice was heard, high above the din, as soon as the  resistance ceased. He ordered the prisoners to be all brought upon  deck, and disarmed, and at once forced into their own boats, and  obliged to row away from the vessel; for he knew that, were his men  once to begin to plunder, and to fall upon the liquors, the  Spaniards, even if unarmed, would be able to rise and overpower  them.    No sooner was the last Spaniard out of the ship, than the men  scattered to look for plunder. Ned was standing on the poop,  watching the boats rowing away, and thinking to himself that, so  crowded were they, if a breeze were to spring up there would not be  much chance of their reaching Nombre de Dios. Suddenly he heard  below him a scream, followed by a splash; looking over, he saw the  head of a woman appear above the water, and without hesitation  dived at once from the side. For a moment the girl, for she was  little more, struggled with him as if she would have sunk; but Ned,  grasping her firmly, in a few strokes swam with her alongside the  ship to the boat; and two or three sailors, running down, assisted  him to pull her into it. Then, dripping wet, she was taken to the  deck, where the captain, in kind tones, assured her that she would  receive the most courteous treatment, and that she need be under no  fear, whatever.    She was the daughter of a wealthy Spaniard, at Nombre de Dios, and  was now coming out from Spain to join him. Frightened by the noise  of the fighting, and by the terrible reputation of the English  buccaneers, she had, when the sailors rushed into the cabin with  loud shouts, been so alarmed that she had jumped from the stern  windows into the sea.    Captain Drake assured her courteously that, rough as his men might  be, they would, none of them, lay a finger upon a woman. He then  hoisted a flag and fired a gun, as a signal to the Spanish boats,  which were yet within a quarter of a mile, to return. For a moment  they rowed on, but a ball, sent skimming across their bows, was a  hint which they could not disregard; for, full as they were of men,  they could not have hoped to avoid the English pinnace, should it  have put off after them.    When the boats came alongside, some of those on board were ordered  to ascend the side of the ship; and, plenty of accommodation having  been made, the young Spanish lady and her maid, who had remained in  the cabin, descended into the largest boat; handed down by Captain  Drake, with a courtesy equal to that which a Spanish hidalgo  himself would have shown.    Before she went, the young lady turned to Ned, who was standing  near, and expressed to him her deep thanks for the manner in which  he had leapt over for her. Ned himself could understand only a few  words, for although many of the sailors spoke Spanish, and  sometimes used it among themselves, he had not yet made any great  progress with it, although he had tried to pick up as many words  and phrases as he could. The captain, however, translated the words  to him; and he said to her, in reply, that there was nothing for  her to feel herself under any obligation to him for, for that any  dog would have jumped out and done the business, just as well.    The young lady, however, undid a bracelet of gold on her arm, and  insisted upon herself fastening it round Ned's wrist, an action  which caused blushes of confusion to crimson his face.    In a few minutes the Spanish boats were again off. The captain  added, to that in which the young lady was placed, some food, some  bottles of liqueur, and other matters which might render her voyage  easy and pleasant. He promised that the Spaniards who had been  transferred again to the ship should be landed, at the earliest  opportunity.    The vessel was now searched, regularly, and was found to contain  much treasure in goods; but as she was on her way from Europe, she  had, of course, none of the gold and silver which was the main  object of their search. However, they consoled themselves with the  thought that the ship which had been chased by their comrades,  earlier in the day, was homewards bound; and they hoped, therefore,  that a rich cargo would there be secured.    They were not mistaken, for when the ship sailed up to the  rendezvous they found another alongside, and the cheers of their  comrades told them that the prize had been a handsome one. They  found that they had secured nearly half a million in gold and  silver; and, transferring the cargo of the one ship into the other,  they set the first on fire, and sailed back to the spot where their  camp was formed, on the isthmus.    Several other ships fell into their hands in this way, but after  this they hindered no more vessels on their way from Europe. They  had ample stores and, indeed, far more than enough to supply them  with every luxury; for on board the Pacha the richest wines, the  most delicate conserves, the richest garments of all kinds were  already in such abundance as to become common to them all. Down to  the common sailor, all feasted on the best, and drank wines that an  emperor might have approved. Captain Drake, in this way, gave his  men when on shore much license; insisting, however, that they  should abstain from drunkenness. For, as he said, not only would  they be at the mercy of any small body of the enemy which might  find them, but drunkenness breeds quarrels and disputes, and as  between comrades would be fatal, indeed. Thus, although enough of  good liquor was given to each man to make him merry, none were  allowed to drink beyond this point.    The reason why the ships coming from Europe were allowed to pass,  unmolested, was that Drake wished not that, each day, some fresh  tale of capture should be brought to Panama by the crews set free  in the boats; for it was certain that the tale so told would, at  last, stir up such fear and indignation at the ravages committed by  so small a body, that the governors of the Spanish towns would  combine their forces, and would march against them with a veritable  army. While only the ships starting from Darien were overhauled,  and lightened of their contents, the tale was not brought back to  Darien; for the crews were allowed to sail on with their ships to  Europe, as Drake had already more vessels than he knew what to do  with; and as for prisoners, they were, to him, quite useless.    Captain John did, indeed, at one time propose to him that he should  take out of each ship all the principal men, so as to hold them as  hostages, in case of any misfortune happening to the English; but  the admiral said to him, that so great was the enmity and fear of  them, that did they fall into the hands of the Spaniards, these  would not exchange them and let them go, even if as many kings were  set free in return.    In all, five vessels were seized and plundered while lying at  Darien. All was not, however, going well; for while they lay there,  a terrible sickness broke out among them. Whether this was from the  change of life, or from any noxious thing which they ate, or merely  from the heat, none could say; but, very shortly, the illness made  great ravages among them. First died Charles Clift, one of the  quartermasters.    Then one day, when the pinnace in which Ned always sailed returned,  they were met with the sad news that Captain John Drake was also  dead. He had fallen, however, not by the fever, but by the ball of  the Spaniards. He had gone out with one of the pinnaces, and had  engaged a great Spanish ship; but the latter had shot more straight  and faster than usual, and the captain himself and Richard Allen,  one of his men, had been slain in an unsuccessful attempt to  capture the ship. His sad end was not the result of any rashness on  his part; for he, indeed, had told the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19207"],[0,"The Firelight Fairy Book (#11)"],[1,"its neck,\" said the cook to one of her helpers, \"while  I go call the cat.\"    By great good fortune, the cook's helper was no other than the peasant  girl whom Marianna had saved. This girl recognized the yellow bird, and  instead of wringing its neck, let it fly out of the window. The yellow  bird flew to the window of the magician's room. The magician was in the  chamber, stirring the giant cauldron. The bird flew to the window of  Prince Desire's room, and saw that he was still insensible.    An hour later the castle-bell began to toll, and a dismal procession was  seen walking from the castle toward the frightful cliff from which  condemned witches and sorcerers were thrown. First came a troop of  soldiers, then Marianna, weighted down with chains, and last of all, a  little group in which were Garabin, the magician, and some of Garabin's  favorites.    The bell kept on sadly tolling and tolling. It roused the Prince from  his swoon, and with his last measure of strength, poor Desire dragged  himself to the window. The procession was then passing directly  underneath the window, and Desire's eyes met the eyes of Marianna.    \"Stop! Stop!\" cried the poor Prince, wildly; \"I forbid--\"    An instant later he sank fainting to the floor. The procession went on.    Meanwhile the yellow bird had returned to the magician's chamber. It was  empty. With a joyous cry, the bird fluttered through the window-bars,  and discovered the phial into which the magician had poured the water of  healing. Clutching it in his claws, the bird flew once more to the  Prince's room. Desire still lay in a heap by the window, and over him  the yellow bird poured the contents of the phial.    The Prince sprang up, strong as a lion, seized his sword, and rushed  down to save Marianna. He arrived at the cliff just as the poor maiden  was about to be pushed off into space, and standing by her side, dared  anyone to lay hands upon her.    Garabin, seeing his precious plot miscarry, grew mad with rage.    \"Seize them,\" cried he, \"and toss them both over the precipice!\"    So the soldiers rushed at Marianna and the Prince, intending to carry  out their wicked master's orders. But even as they did so, there came a  flash of flame and the little dwarf, Marianna's foster-father, took his  place beside the lovers.    \"Cruel King!\" cried the dwarf sternly, \"and thou, wicked and perfidious  magician, the hour of thy punishment is at hand.\"    Immediately the sky grew black, the lightning crashed, and there arose a  terrible, howling wind. Three giant gusts drove fiercely by, the first  one blowing the King and the magician head-over-heels over the  precipice, the second carrying away the soldiers, and the third the  rascally favorites. When the sky cleared, only the dwarf, Marianna, and  Desire were left of the company.    \"Marianna,\" said the little dwarf, \"the Emperor of the Elves has told me  all your history, and it is thanks to him that I have returned in time,  with the storm at my heels. You, Marianna, are the rightful Queen of  this country.\"    \"Dear Queen,\" said the honest and gallant Desire, \"let me be the first  of your subjects to salute you.\" And he knelt before her, and humbly  kissed her hand.    \"Nay, Prince,\" said the young Queen, answering the adoring look in her  lover's eyes, \"your father took the kingdom; if I were you, I should  take the Queen.\"    Which was a bit forward, of course, but nobody minded that very much in  those fairy times.    So Desire and Marianna were married, and lived happily ever after. The  yellow bird went to the wedding, and when the ceremony was over rose  singing into the air, and flew joyously home to the land of the Elves.             THE LOST HALF-HOUR    Once upon a time there was an old widow woman who had three sons: the  first two were clever enough, but the third, Bobo by name, was little  better than a silly simpleton. All his mother's scoldings and  beatings--and she smacked the poor lad soundly a dozen times a day--did  him no good whatever.    Now it came to pass that one morning Princess Zenza, the ruler of the  land, happened to pass by the cottage and heard Bobo being given a  terrible tongue-lashing. Curious as to the cause of all the noise, the  Princess drew rein, and summoned Bobo's mother to come near. On hearing  her story, it occurred to the Princess that so silly a lad might amuse  her; so she gave the mother a golden florin, and took poor silly Bobo  with her to be her page.      [Illustration: In the background, a castle; in the middle ground, a boy  throwing a spiny object into a dragon's mouth; in the foreground, a  frightened girl.]      Just as the dragon's mouth was at, its widest ....      You may be sure that it did not take the wise folk at the castle long to  discover how great a simpleton had arrived. Courtiers, footmen, lackeys,  turnspits even, were forever sending him off on ridiculous errands. Now  he would be sent to find a white craw's feather or a spray of yellow  bluebells; now he was ordered to look for a square wheel or a glass of  dry water. Everybody laughed at him and made fun of him--that is,  everybody except little Tilda, the kitchen-maid. When poor Bobo used to  return from some wild-goose chase, tired out, mud-stained, and often  enough wet to the skin, instead of laughing, little Tilda would find him  a glass of warm milk, hang his coat by the fire to dry, and tell him not  to be such a simpleton again. Thus, after a while, Bobo learned to ask  Tilda's advice before going away on a wild-goose chase, and was in this  way saved from many a jest.    Tilda, the kitchen-maid, was as sweet and pretty as she was kind and  good. She was said to be the daughter of an old crane who had come to  the castle one day, asking for help.    One pleasant mid-summer morning, when Bobo had been nearly a year at the  castle, Princess Zenza overslept half an hour and did not come down to  breakfast at the usual time. When she did get up, she found her court  waiting for her in the castle gardens. As she came down the steps of the  garden terrace, the Princess looked up at the castle clock to see how  late she was, and said to her lady in waiting,--    \"Dear me--why, I've lost half an hour this morning!\"    At these words, Bobo, who was in attendance, pricked up his ears and  said,--    \"Please, Your Highness, perhaps I can find it.\"    At this idea of finding a lost half-hour, the Princess laughed, and  found herself echoed by the company.    \"Shall we send Bobo in search of the lost half-hour?\" said the Princess  to the courtiers.    \"Yes! Yes!\" cried the courtiers. \"Bobo shall look for the lost  half-hour.\"    \"I'll give him a horse,\" said one. \"I'll give him my old hat,\" said  another. \"He can have an old sword I broke last week,\" said still  another.    And so, in less time than it takes to tell about it, poor simpleton Bobo  was made ready for his journey.    Before he left the castle, Bobo went down to the kitchen to say good-bye  to Tilda.    \"What, off again?\" said the little kitchen-maid. \"Where are you going  now?\"    \"The Princess has lost a half-hour and I am going in search of it,\" said  Bobo, proudly. And he told how the Princess herself had commanded him to  seek the half-hour through the world, and promised to bring Tilda a  splendid present when he returned.    The good kitchen-maid said little, for she feared lest some misadventure  overtake the poor simpleton; but when the chief cook was not looking,  she tucked a fresh currant-bun into Bobo's pocket, and wished him the  best of good fortune.    So Bobo went to the castle gate, and mounted his horse, which stumbled  and was blind in one eye.    \"Good-bye, Bobo,\" cried the assembled courtiers, who were almost beside  themselves with laughter at the simpleton and his errand. \"Don't fail to  bring back the lost half-hour!\"    So Bobo rode over the hills and far away. Every now and then he would  stop a passer-by and ask him if he had seen a lost half-hour.    The first person whom he thus questioned was an old man who was  wandering down the high road that leads from the Kingdom of the East to  the Kingdom of the West.    \"A lost half-hour?\" said the old man. \"I've lost something much more  serious, I've lost my reputation. You have n't seen a lost reputation  lying about here, have you? It was very dignified and wore  tortoise-shell glasses.\"    But Bobo had to answer \"No,\" and the old man wandered on again.    Another day the simpleton encountered a tall, dark, fierce kind of  fellow, who answered his polite question with a scream of rage.    \"A half-hour,\" he roared. \"No, I have n't seen your half-hour; I would  n't tell you if I had; what's more, I don't want to see it. I'm looking  for something I've lost myself. I've lost my temper. I lost it two years  ago at home, and have n't been able to find it anywhere since. Answer  me, you silly, have you seen a lost temper anywhere? It's about the size  of a large melon and has sharp little points.\"    On Bobo's answering \"No,\" this dreadful person uttered so perfectly  awful a screech of rage, that Bobo's horse took fright and ran away with  him, and it was all that Bobo could do to rein him in three miles  farther down the road.    Still farther along, Bobo came to Zizz, the capital city of the Kingdom  of the Seven Brooks, and was taken before the King himself.    \"A lost half-hour?\" said the King. \"No, I am quite sure it has not been  seen in my dominions. Would you mind asking, as you go through the  world, for news of my little daughter?\" (Here the poor old King took out  a great green handkerchief and wiped his eyes.) \"She was stolen by the  fairies on midsummer eve fifteen years ago. Find her, worthy Bobo, and  an immense reward will be yours.\"    So Bobo left the proud city of Zizz, and once again rode over the hills  and far away. But never a sign of the lost half-hour did he find,  although he asked thousands of people. His faithful white"]]]
