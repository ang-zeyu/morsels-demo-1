In order to facilitate reference and to diminish the necessity for  footnotes a survey of classes and phratries is here given. It will be  well to explain how they are arranged.    In the two-phratry system the rule of intermarriage is clear; a man of  phratry _A_ marries a woman of phratry _B_ and _vice versa_. The direct  descent of the kinship name is obviously the rule.    The four classes are arranged according to the phratries; the normal  rule is that a man _A1_ marries _B1_, _A2_ marries _B2_; their children  are in matrilineal tribes _A2_ and _B2_, in patrilineal _B2_ and _A2_.  In the patrilineal Mara and Anula, by exception, the rule of descent is  direct; it will be remembered that a dichotomy of the classes prevails,  so that they really belong to the eight-class system.    In the eight-class system and among the nominally four-class southern  Arunta the intermarriage and descent is as follows, according to Spencer  and Gillen;          _A1_               _B1_       ------ = _A4_,     ------ = _B3_,        _B1_               _A1_          _A_2               _B2_       ------ = _A3_,     ------ = _B4_,        _B2_               _A2_          _A3_               _B3_       ------ = _A2_,     ------ = _B1_,        _B3_               _A3_          _A4_               _B4_       ------ = _B4_,     ------ = _B2_.        _B4_               _A4_    In each case the male is the numerator, the woman the denominator, and  the = shows the child.    Tribes with conterminous territories usually know what phratries and  classes are equivalent in their systems. In the tables which follow the  phratries and the classes of matrilineal tribes are arranged to show  this correspondence so far as it is known. A * shows that no information  on the point is to hand. A rearrangement of patrilineal classes is  necessary to make them equivalent to the organisations of matrilineal  tribes; this cannot be shown in the tables; but full details will be  found in the works of Spencer and Gillen. A [+] indicates patrilineal  descent.    Where the names of phratries and classes are translated, the meanings  are shown in the tables; where the authorities do not give the  translation but a word of the same form is in use in the tribe or group  of tribes the meanings are given in round brackets; words in use in  neighbouring tribes are put in square brackets.

Now there is one and only one object in the visible  universe which we need not anthropomorphise to realise--and that is man  himself. His movements, his actions, are the only things we realise  without any myth-making effort--directly. Hence, there is no visible  object of such artistic possibilities as the human body; nothing with  which we are so familiar; nothing, therefore, in which we so rapidly  perceive changes; nothing, then, which if represented so as to be  realised more quickly and vividly than in life, will produce its effect  with such velocity and power, and so strongly confirm our sense of  capacity for living.    [Page heading: VALUE OF THE NUDE IN ART]    Values of touch and movement, we remember, are the specifically artistic  qualities in figure painting (at least, as practised by the  Florentines), for it is through them chiefly that painting directly  heightens life. Now while it remains true that tactile values can, as  Giotto and Masaccio have forever established, be admirably rendered on  the draped figure, yet drapery is a hindrance, and, at the best, only a  way out of a difficulty, for we _feel_ it masking the really  significant, which is _the form underneath_. A mere painter, one who is  satisfied to reproduce what everybody sees, and to paint for the fun of  painting, will scarcely comprehend this feeling. His only significant is  the obvious--in a figure, the face and the clothing, as in most of the  portraits manufactured nowadays. The artist, even when compelled to  paint draped figures, will force the drapery to render the nude, in  other words the material significance of the human body. But how much  more clearly will this significance shine out, how much more  convincingly will the character manifest itself, when between its  perfect rendering and the artist nothing intervenes! And this perfect  rendering is to be accomplished with the nude only.    If draperies are a hindrance to the conveyance of tactile values, they  make the perfect rendering of movement next to impossible. To realise  the play of muscle everywhere, to get the full sense of the various  pressures and resistances, to receive the direct inspiration of the  energy expended, we must have the nude; for here alone can we watch  those tautnesses of muscle and those stretchings and relaxings and  ripplings of skin which, translated into similar strains on our own  persons, make us fully realise movement. Here alone the translation,  owing to the multitude and the clearness of the appeals made, is  instantaneous, and the consequent sense of increased capacity almost as  great as can be attained; while in the draped figure we miss all the  appeal of visible muscle and skin, and realise movement only after a  slow translation of certain functional outlines, so that the sense of  capacity which we receive from the perception of movement is increased  but slightly.    We are now able to understand why every art whose chief preoccupation is  the human figure must have the nude for its chief interest; why, also,  the nude is the most absorbing problem of classic art at all times. Not  only is it the best vehicle for all that in art which is directly  life-confirming and life-enhancing, but it is itself the most  significant object in the human world. The first person since the great  days of Greek sculpture to comprehend fully the identity of the nude  with great figure art, was Michelangelo. Before him, it had been  studied for scientific purposes--as an aid in rendering the draped  figure. He saw that it was an end in itself, and the final purpose of  his art. For him the nude and art were synonymous. Here lies the secret  of his successes and his failures.    [Page heading: MICHELANGELO]    First, his successes. Nowhere outside of the best Greek art shall we  find, as in Michelangelo's works, forms whose tactile values so increase  our sense of capacity, whose movements are so directly communicated and  inspiring. Other artists have had quite as much feeling for tactile  values alone,--Masaccio, for instance; others still have had at least as  much sense of movement and power of rendering it,--Leonardo, for  example; but no other artist of modern times, having at all his control  over the materially significant, has employed it as Michelangelo did, on  the one subject where its full value can be manifested--the nude. Hence  of all the achievements of modern art, his are the most invigorating.  Surely not often is our imagination of touch roused as by his Adam in  the \"Creation,\" by his Eve in the \"Temptation,\" or by his many nudes in  the same ceiling of the Sixtine Chapel,--there for no other purpose, be  it noted, than their direct tonic effect! Nor is it less rare to quaff  such draughts of unadulterated energy as we receive from the \"God  Creating Adam,\" the \"Boy Angel\" standing by Isaiah, or--to choose one or  two instances from his drawings (in their own kind the greatest in  existence)--the \"Gods Shooting at a Mark\" or the \"Hercules and the  Lion.\"    And to this feeling for the materially significant and all this power of  conveying it, to all this more narrowly artistic capacity, Michelangelo  joined an ideal of beauty and force, a vision of a glorious but possible  humanity, which, again, has never had its like in modern times.  Manliness, robustness, effectiveness, the fulfilment of our dream of a  great soul inhabiting a beautiful body, we shall encounter nowhere else  so frequently as among the figures in the Sixtine Chapel. Michelangelo  completed what Masaccio had begun, the creation of the type of man best  fitted to subdue and control the earth, and, who knows! perhaps more  than the earth.    [Page heading: LAST WORKS OF MICHELANGELO]    But unfortunately, though born and nurtured in a world where his  feeling for the nude and his ideal of humanity could be appreciated, he  passed most of his life in the midst of tragic disasters, and while yet  in the fulness of his vigour, in the midst of his most creative years,  he found himself alone, perhaps the greatest, but alas! also the last of  the giants born so plentifully during the fifteenth century. He lived on  in a world he could not but despise, in a world which really could no  more employ him than it could understand him. He was not allowed,  therefore, to busy himself where he felt most drawn by his genius, and,  much against his own strongest impulses, he was obliged to expend his  energy upon such subjects as the \"Last Judgment.\" His later works all  show signs of the altered conditions, first in an overflow into the  figures he was creating of the scorn and bitterness he was feeling, then  in the lack of harmony between his genius and what he was compelled to  execute. His passion was the nude, his ideal power. But what outlet for  such a passion, what expression for such an ideal could there be in  subjects like the \"Last Judgment,\" or the \"Crucifixion of  Peter\"--subjects which the Christian world imperatively demanded should  incarnate the fear of the humble and the self-sacrifice of the patient?  Now humility and patience were feelings as unknown to Michelangelo as to  Dante before him, or, for that matter, to any other of the world's  creative geniuses at any time. Even had he felt them, he had no means of  expressing them, for his nudes could convey a sense of power, not of  weakness; of terror, not of dread; of despair, but not of submission.  And terror the giant nudes of the \"Last Judgment\" do feel, but it is not  terror of the Judge, who, being in no wise different from the others, in  spite of his omnipotent gesture, seems to be _announcing_ rather than  _willing_ what the bystanders, his fellows, could not _unwill_. As the  representation of the moment before the universe disappears in  chaos--Gods huddling together for the _Goetterdaemmerung_--the \"Last  Judgment\" is as grandly conceived as possible: but when the crash comes,  none will survive it, no, not even God. Michelangelo therefore failed in  his conception of the subject, and could not but fail. But where else  in the whole world of art shall we receive such blasts of energy as from  this giant's dream, or, if you will, nightmare? For kindred reasons, the  \"Crucifixion of Peter\" is a failure. Art can be only life-communicating  and life-enhancing. If it treats of pain and death, these must always  appear as manifestations and as results only of living resolutely and  energetically. What chance is there, I ask, for this, artistically the  only possible treatment, in the representation of a man crucified with  his head downwards? Michelangelo could do nothing but make the  bystanders, the executioners, all the more life-communicating, and  therefore inevitably more sympathetic! No wonder he failed here! What a  tragedy, by the way, that the one subject perfectly cut out for his  genius, the one subject which required none but genuinely artistic  treatment, his \"Bathers,\" executed forty years before these last works,  has disappeared, leaving but scant traces! Yet even these suffice to  enable the competent student to recognise that this composition must  have been the greatest masterpiece in figure art of modern times.    That Michelangelo had faults of his own is undeniable. As he got older,  and his genius, lacking its proper outlets, tended to stagnate and  thicken, he fell into exaggerations--exaggerations of power into  brutality, of tactile values into feats of modelling. No doubt he was  also at times as indifferent to representation as Botticelli! But while  there is such a thing as movement, there is no such thing as tactile  values without representation. Yet he seems to have dreamt of presenting  nothing but tactile values: hence his many drawings with only the torso  adequately treated, the rest unheeded. Still another result from his  passion for"]]]
