[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18274"],[0,"A Book of Natural History (#11)"],[1," is  absolutely needed by every egg in order to enable it to undergo those  vital changes which we know as hatching. To keep up a due supply of  oxygen, therefore, the father stickleback ungrudgingly devotes  laborious days in poising himself delicately just above the nest, as  you see in No. 3, and fanning the eggs with his fins and tail, so as  to set up a constant current of water through the centre of the  barrel. He sits upon the eggs just as truly as a hen does; only, he  sits upon them, not for warmth, but for aeration.    [Illustration: NO. 3. MALE STICKLEBACK WATCHING EGGS IN NEST.]    For weeks together this exemplary parent continues his monotonous  task, ventilating the spawn many times every day, till the time comes  for hatching. It takes about a month for the eggs to develop: and then  the proud father's position grows more arduous than ever. He has to  rock a thousand cradles at once, so to speak, and to pacify a thousand  crying babies. On the one hand, enemies hover about, trying to eat the  tender transparent glass-like little fry, and these he must drive off:  on the other hand, the good nurse must take care that the active young  fish do not stray far from the nest, and so expose themselves  prematurely to the manifold dangers of the outer world. Till they are  big enough to take care of themselves, he watches with incessant  vigilance over their safety; as soon as they can go forth with  tolerable security upon the world of their brook or pond, he takes a  last well-merited holiday.    It is not surprising under these circumstances to learn that  sticklebacks are successful and increasing animals. Their numbers are  enormous, wherever they get a fair chance in life, because they  multiply rapidly up to the extreme limit of the means of subsistence,  and develop as fast as food remains for them. There the inexorable  Malthusian law at last steps in: when there is not food enough for all  some must starve; that is the long and the short of the great  population question. But while provender is forthcoming they increase  gayly. Sticklebacks live mainly on the spawn of other fish, though  they are so careful of their own, and they are therefore naturally  hated by trout-preservers and owners of fisheries in general.  Thousands and thousands are caught each year; in some places, indeed,  they are so numerous that they are used as manure. It is their  numbers, of course, that make them formidable; they are the locusts of  the streams, well armed and pugnacious, and provided with most  remarkable parental instincts of a protective character, which enables  them to fill up all vacancies in their ranks as fast as they occur  with astonishing promptitude.    To those whose acquaintance with fish is mainly culinary, it may seem  odd to hear that the father stickleback alone takes part in the care  of the nursery. But this is the rule among the whole class of fish;  wherever the young are tended, it is almost always the father, not the  mother, who undertakes the duty of incubation. Only two instances  occur where the female fish assumes maternal functions towards her  young; about these I shall have more to say a little later on. We must  remember that reptiles, birds, and mammals are in all probability  descended from fish as ancestors, and it is therefore clear that the  habit of handing over the care of the young to the female alone  belongs to the higher grades of vertebrates--in other words, is of  later origin. We need not be astonished, therefore, to find that in  many cases among birds and other advanced vertebrates a partial  reversion to the earlier habit not infrequently takes place. With  doves, for example, the cock and hen birds sit equally on the eggs,  taking turns about at the nest; and as for the ostriches, the male  bird there does most of the incubation, for he accepts the whole of  the night duty, and also assists at intervals during the daytime.  There are numerous other cases where the father bird shares the tasks  of the nursery at least equally with the mother. I will glance first,  however, at one of the rare exceptions among fish where the main duty  does not devolve on the devoted father.    [Illustration: NO. 4. FEMALE TUBE-MOUTH.]    In No. 4 we have an illustration of the tube-mouth or Solenostoma, one  of the two known kinds of fish in which the female shows a sense of  her position as a mother. The tube-mouth, as you can see at a glance,  is a close relation of our old friend the seahorse, whose disguised  and undisguised forms in Australia and the Mediterranean we have  already observed when dealing with the question of animal  masqueraders. Solenostoma is a native of the Indian Ocean, from  Zanzibar to China. In the male, the lower pair of fins are separate,  as is usual among fish; but in the female, represented in the  accompanying sketch, they are lightly joined at the edge, so as to  form a sort of pouch like a kangaroo's, in which the eggs are  deposited after being laid, and thus carried about in the mother's  safe keeping. No. 5 shows the arrangement of this pouch in detail,  with the eggs inside it. The mother Solenostoma not only takes charge  of the spawn while it is hatching in this receptacle, but also looks  after the young fry, like the father stickleback, till they are of an  age to go off on their own account in quest of adventures. The most  frequent adventure that happens to them on the way is, of course,  being eaten.    [Illustration: NO. 5. POUCH OF TUBE-MOUTH.]    [Illustration: NO. 6. PIPE-FISH.]    The common English pipe-fish is a good example of the other and much  more usual case in which the father alone is actuated by a proper  sense of parental responsibility. The pipe-fish, indeed, might almost  be described as a pure and blameless rate-payer. No. 6 shows you the  outer form of this familiar creature, whom you will recognize at a  glance as still more nearly allied to the sea-horses than even the  tube-mouth. Pipe-fishes are timid and skulking creatures. Like their  horse-headed relations, they lurk for the most part among sea-weed  for protection, and being but poor swimmers, never venture far from  the covering shelter of their native thicket. But the curious part of  them is that in this family the father fish is provided with a pouch  even more perfect than that of the female tube-mouth, and that he  himself, not his mate takes sole charge of the young, incubates them  in his sack, and escorts them about for some time after hatching. The  pouch, which is more fully represented in No. 7, is formed by a loose  fold of skin arising from either side of the creature. In the  illustration this fold is partly withdrawn, so as to show the young  pipe-fish within their safe retreat after hatching out. It is said, I  know not how truly, that the young fry will stroll out for an  occasional swim on their own account, but will return at any threat of  danger to their father's bosom, for a considerable time after the  first hatching. This is just like what one knows of kangaroos and many  other pouched mammals, where the mother's pouch becomes a sort of  nursery, or place of refuge, to which the little ones return for  warmth or safety after every excursion.    [Illustration: NO. 7. POUCH OF PIPE-FISH.]    The sea-horses and many other fish have similar pouches; but, oddly  enough, in every case it is the male fish which bears it, and which  undertakes the arduous duty of nurse for his infant offspring.    A few female fish, on the other hand, even hatch the eggs within their  own bodies, and so apparently bring forth their young alive, like the  English lizard among reptiles. This, however, is far from a common  case: indeed, in an immense number of instances, neither parent pays  the slightest attention to the eggs after they are once laid and got  rid of: the spawn is left to lie on the bottom and be eaten or spared  as chance directs, while the young fry have to take care of  themselves, without the aid of parental advice and education. But  exceptions occur where both parents show signs of realizing the  responsibilities of their position. In some little South American  river fish, for instance, the father and mother together build a nest  of dead leaves for the spawn, and watch over it in unison until the  young are hatched. This case is exactly analogous to that of the doves  among birds: I may add that wherever such instances occur they always  seem to be accompanied by a markedly gentle and affectionate nature.  Brilliantly-coloured fighting polygamous fishes are fierce and cruel:  monogamous and faithful animals are seldom bright-hued, but they mate  for life and are usually remarkable for their domestic felicity. The  doves and love-birds are familiar instances.    Frogs are very closely allied to fish: indeed, one may almost say that  every frog begins life as a fish, limbless, gill-bearing, and aquatic,  and ends it as something very like a reptile, four-legged,  lung-bearing, and more or less terrestrial. For the tadpole is  practically in all essentials a fish. It is not odd, therefore, to  find that certain frogs reproduce, in a very marked manner, the  fatherly traits of their fish-like ancestors. There is a common kind  of frog in France, Belgium, and Switzerland, which does not extend to  England, but which closely recalls the habits of the stickleback and  the pipe-fish. Among these eminently moral amphibians, it is the  father, not the mother, who takes entire charge of the family. The  female lays her spawn in the shape of long strings or rolls, looking  at first sight like slimy necklaces. I have seen them as much as a  couple of yards long, lying loose on the grass where the frog lays  them. As soon as she has deposited them, however, the father frog hops  up, twists the garlands dexterously in loose festoons round his legs  and thighs, and then retires with his precious burden to some hole in  the bank of his native"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18281"],[0,"An Account of the Proceedings on the Trial of Susan B. Anthony, on the Charge of (#11)"],[1,"system, as  probably it is of every other, that _the essence of an offence is the  wrongful intent without which it cannot exist_.\" (_1 Bishop's Crim. Law,  Sec.287._)    Again, the same author, writing on the subject of _knowledge_, as  necessary to establish the intent, says: \"It is absolutely necessary to  constitute guilt, as in indictments for uttering forged tokens, or other  attempts to defraud, or for receiving stolen goods, and offences of a  similar description.\" (_1 Crim. Prac. Sec.504._)    In regard to the offence of obtaining property by false pretenses, the  author says: \"The indictment must allege that the defendant knew the  pretenses to be false. _This is necessary upon the general principles of  the law_, in order to show an offence, even though the statute does not  contain the word 'knowingly.'\" (_2 Id. Sec.172._)    As to a _presumed knowledge_ of the law, where the fact involves a  question of law, the same author says: \"The general doctrine laid down  in the foregoing sections,\" (i.e. that every man is presumed to know the  law, and that ignorance of the law does not excuse,) \"is plain in itself  and plain in its application. Still there are cases, the precise nature  and extent of which are not so obvious, wherein ignorance of the law  constitutes, in a sort of indirect way, not in itself a defence, but a  foundation on which another defence rests. Thus, if the guilt or  innocence of a prisoner, depends on the fact to be found by the jury, of  his having been or not, when he did the act, in some precise mental  condition, _which mental condition is the gist of the offence_, the jury  in determining this question of mental condition, _may_ take into  consideration his ignorance or misinformation in a matter of law. For  example, to constitute larceny, there must be an intent to steal, which  involves the knowledge that the property taken does not belong to the  taker; yet, if all the facts concerning the title are known to the  accused, and so the question is one merely of law whether the property  is his or not, still he may show, and the showing _will be a defence_ to  him against the criminal proceeding, that he _honestly believed it his  through a misapprehension of the law_.\"              (1 Cr. Law, Sec.297.)    The conclusions of the writer here, are correct, but in a part of the  statement the learned author has thrown some obscurity over his own  principles. The doctrines elsewhere enunciated by him, show with great  clearness, that in such cases _the state of the mind constitutes the  essence of the offence_, and if the state of the mind which the law  condemns does not exist, in connection with the act, there is no  offence. It is immaterial whether its non-existence be owing to  ignorance of law or ignorance of fact, in either case the fact which the  law condemns, the criminal intent, is wanting. It is not, therefore, in  an \"indirect way,\" that ignorance of the law in such cases constitutes a  defence, but in the most direct way possible. It is not a fact which  jurors \"may take into consideration,\" or not, at their pleasure, but  which they must take into consideration, because, in case the ignorance  exists, no matter from what cause, _the offence which the statute  describes is not committed_. In such case, ignorance of the law is not  interposed as a shield to one committing a criminal act, but merely to  show, as it does show, that no criminal act has been committed.    I quote from Sir Mathew Hale on the subject. Speaking of larceny, the  learned author says: \"As it is _cepit_ and _asportavit_, so it must be  _felonice_, or _animo furandi_, otherwise it is not felony, for _it is  the mind_ that makes the taking of another's goods to be a felony, or a  bare trespass only; but because the intention and mind are secret, the  intention must be judged of by the circumstances of the fact, and these  circumstances are various, and may sometimes deceive, yet regularly and  ordinarily these circumstances following direct in the case. If A.,  thinking he hath a title to the house of B., seizeth it as his own ...  this regularly makes no felony, but a trespass only; but yet this may be  a trick to colour a felony, and the ordinary discovery of a felonious  intent is, if the party doth it secretly, or being charged with the  goods denies it.\"              (1 Hales P.C. 509.)    I concede, that if Miss Anthony voted, knowing that as a woman she had  no right to vote, she may properly be convicted, and that if she had  dressed herself in men's apparel, and assumed a man's name, or resorted  to any other artifice to deceive the board of inspectors, the jury might  properly regard her claim of right, to be merely colorable, and might,  in their judgment, pronounce her guilty of the offence charged, in case  the constitution has not secured to her the right she claimed. All I  claim is, that if she voted in perfect good faith, believing that it was  her right, she has committed no crime. An innocent mistake, whether of  law or fact, though a wrongful act may be done in pursuance of it,  cannot constitute a crime.    [The following cases and authorities were referred to and commented upon  by the counsel, as sustaining his positions: _U.S. vs. Conover, 3  McLean's Rep. 573; The State vs. McDonald, 4 Harrington, 555; The State  vs. Homes, 17 Mo. 379; Rex vs. Hall, 3 C. & P. 409, (S.C. 14 Eng. C.L.);  The Queen vs. Reed, 1 C. & M. 306. (S.C. 41 Eng. C.L.); Lancaster's  Case, 3 Leon. 208; Starkie on Ev., Part IV, Vol. 2, p. 828, 3d Am. Ed._]    The counsel then said, there are some cases which I concede cannot be  reconciled with the position which I have endeavoured to maintain, and I  am sorry to say that one of them is found in the reports of this State.  As the other cases are referred to in that, and the principle, if they  can be said to stand on any principle, is in all of them the same, it  will only be incumbent on me to notice that one. That case is not only  irreconcilable with the numerous authorities and the fundamental  principles of criminal law to which I have referred, but the enormity of  its injustice is sufficient alone to condemn it. I refer to the case of  _Hamilton vs. The People_, (_57 Barb. 725_). In that case Hamilton had  been convicted of a misdemeanor, in having voted at a general election,  after having been previously convicted of a felony and sentenced to two  years imprisonment in the state prison, and not having been pardoned;  the conviction having by law deprived him of citizenship and right to  vote, unless pardoned and restored to citizenship. The case came up  before the General Term of the Supreme Court, on writ of error. It  appeared that on the trial evidence was offered, that before the  prisoner was discharged from the state prison, he and his father applied  to the Governor for a pardon, and that the Governor replied in writing,  that on the ground of the prisoner's being a minor at the time of his  discharge from prison, a pardon would not be necessary, and that he  would be entitled to all the rights of a citizen on his coming of age.  They also applied to two respectable counsellors of the Supreme Court,  and they confirmed the Governor's opinion. All this evidence was  rejected. It appeared that the prisoner was seventeen years old when  convicted of the felony, and was nineteen when discharged from prison.  The rejection of the evidence was approved by the Supreme Court on the  ground that the prisoner was bound to know the law, and was presumed to  do so, and his conviction was accordingly confirmed.    Here a young man, innocent so far as his conduct in this case was  involved, was condemned, for acting in good faith upon the advice,  (mistaken advice it may be conceded,) of one governor and two lawyers to  whom he applied for information as to his rights; and this condemnation  has proceeded upon the assumed ground, conceded to be false in fact,  that he knew the advice given to him was wrong. On this judicial fiction  the young man, in the name of justice, is sent to prison, punished for a  mere mistake, and a mistake made in pursuance of such advice. It cannot  be, consistently with the radical principles of criminal law to which I  have referred, and the numerous authorities which I have quoted, that  this man was guilty of a crime, that his _mistake_ was a crime, and I  think the judges who pronounced his condemnation, upon their own  principles, better than their victim, deserved the punishment which they  inflicted.    The condemnation of Miss Anthony, her good faith being conceded, would  do no less violence to any fair administration of justice.    One other matter will close what I have to say. Miss Anthony believed,  and was advised that she had a right to vote. She may also have been  advised, as was clearly the fact, that the question as to her right  could not be brought before the courts for trial, without her voting or  offering to vote, and if either was criminal, the one was as much so as  the other. Therefore she stands, now arraigned as a criminal, for taking  the only steps by which it was possible to bring the great  constitutional question as to her right, before the tribunals of the  country for adjudication. If for thus acting, in the most perfect good  faith, with motives as pure and impulses as noble as any which can find  place in your honor's breast in the administration of justice, she is by  the laws of her country to be condemned as a criminal, she must abide  the consequences. Her condemnation, however, under such circumstances,  would only add another most weighty reason to those which I have already  advanced, to show that women need the aid of the ballot for their  protection.    Upon the remaining question, of the good faith of the defendant, it is  not necessary for me to speak. That she acted in the most perfect good  faith stands conceded.
