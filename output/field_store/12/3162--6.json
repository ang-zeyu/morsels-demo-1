To the Present Time, Volume 10 (of 12) (#11)"],[1,"Memnonium, the great palace of Ramses II., was then standing; and  though it had been plundered by the Persians, the building itself was  unhurt. Its massive walls had scarcely felt the wear of the centuries  which had rolled over them. Hecataaus measured its rooms, its  courtyards, and its avenue of sphinxes; and by his measurements we can  now distinguish its ruins from those of the other palaces of Thebes. One  of its rooms, perhaps after the days of its builder, had been fitted up  as a library, and held the histories and records of the priests; but the  golden zodiac, or circle, on which were engraved the days of the year,  with the celestial bodies seen to rise at sunrise and set at sunset,  by which each day was known, had been taken away by Cambyses. Hecataaus  also saw the three other palace-temples of Thebes, which we now call  by the names of the villages in which they stand, namely, of Luxor, of  Karnak, and of Medinet-Habu. But the Greeks, in their accounts of  Egypt, have sadly puzzled us by their careless alteration of names from  similarity of sound. To Miamun Ramses, they gave the common Greek name  Memnon; and the city of Hahiroth they called Heroopolis, as if it meant  the _city of heroes_. The capital of Upper Egypt, which was called The  City, as a capital is often called, or in Koptic, _Tape or Thabou_, they  named Thebes, and in their mythology they confounded it with Thebes in  Bootia. The city of the god Kneph they called Canopus, and said it  was so named after the pilot of Menelaus. The hill of Toorah opposite  Memphis they called the Trojan mountain. One of the oldest cities in  Egypt, This, or with the prefix for city, Abouthis, they called Abydos,  and then said that it was colonised by Milesians from Abydos in Asia.  In the same careless way have the Greeks given us an account of the  Egyptian gods. They thought them the same as their own, though with new  faces; and, instead of describing their qualities, they have in the main  contented themselves with translating their names.    If Ptolemy did not make his government as much feared by the half-armed  Ethiopians as it was by the well-disciplined Europeans, it must have  been because the Thebans wished to guard their own frontier rather than  because his troops were always wanted against a more powerful enemy; but  the inroads of the Ethiopians were so far from being checked that the  country to the south of Thebes was unsafe for travellers, and no Greek  was able to reach Syene and the lower cataracts during his reign. The  trade through Ethiopia was wholly stopped, and the caravans went from  Thebes to Cosseir to meet the ships which brought the goods of Arabia  and India from the opposite coast of the Red Sea.    In the wars between Egypt and Asia Minor, in which Palestine had the  misfortune to be the prize struggled for and the debatable land on which  the battles were fought, the Jews were often made to smart under  the stern pride of Antigonus, and to rejoice at the milder temper  of Ptolemy. The Egyptians of the Delta and the Jews had always been  friends; and hence, when Ptolemy promised to treat the Jews with the  same kindness as the Greeks, and more than the Egyptians, and held out  all the rights of Macedonian citizenship to those who would settle in  his rising city of Alexandria, he was followed by crowds of industrious  traders, manufacturers, and men of letters. They chose to live in Egypt  in peace and wealth, rather than to stay in Palestine in the daily fear  of having their houses sacked and burnt at every fresh quarrel between  Ptolemy and Antigonus. In Alexandria, a suburb by the sea, on the east  side of the city, was allotted for their use, which was afterwards  included within the fortifications, and thus made a fifth ward of the  Lagid metropolis.    No sooner was the peace agreed upon between the four generals, who were  the most powerful kings in the known world, than Cassander, who held  Macedonia, put to death both the Queen Roxana and her son, the young  Alexander AEgus, then thirteen years old, in whose name these generals  had each governed his kingdom with unlimited sway, and who was then of  an age that the soldiers, the givers of all power, were already  planning to make him the real King of Macedonia and of his father's wide  conquests.    The Macedonian phalanx, which formed the pride and sinews of every  army, were equally held by their deep-rooted loyalty to the memory of  Alexander, whether they were fighting for Ptolemy or for Antigonus, and  equally thought that they were guarding a province for his heir; and it  was through fear of loosening their hold upon the faithfulness of these  their best troops that Ptolemy and his rivals alike chose to govern  their kingdoms under the unpretending title of lieutenants of the King  of Macedonia. Hence, upon the death of Alexander AEgus, there was a  throne, or at least a state prison, left empty for a new claimant.  Polysperchon, an old general of Alexander's army, then thought that he  saw a way to turn Cassander out of Macedonia, by the help of Hercules,  the natural son of Alexander by Barce; and, having proclaimed him king,  he led him with a strong army against Cassander. But Polysperchon wanted  either courage or means for what he had undertaken, and he soon yielded  to the bribes of Cassander and put Hercules to death.    The cities on the southern coast of Asia Minor yielded to Antigonus  obedience as slight as the ties which held them to one another. The  cities of Pamphylia and Cilicia, in their habits as in their situation,  were nearer the Syrians, and famous for their shipping. They all enjoyed  a full share of the trade and piracy of those seas, and were a tempting  prize to Ptolemy. The treaty of peace between the generals never  lessened their jealousy nor wholly stopped the warfare, and the  next year Ptolemy, finding that his troops could hardly keep their  possessions in Cilicia, carried over an army in person to attack the  forces of Antigonus in Lycia. He landed at Phaselis, the frontier town  of Pamphylia, and, having carried that by storm, he moved westward along  the coast of Lycia. He made himself master of Xanthus, the capital,  which was garrisoned by the troops of Antigonus; and then of Caunus, a  strong place on the coast of Caria, with two citadels, one of which he  gained by force and the other by surrender. He then sailed to the island  of Cos, which he gained by the treachery of Ptolemy, the nephew of  Antigonus, who held it for his uncle, but who went over to the Egyptian  king with all his forces. By this success he gained the whole southern  coast of Asia Minor.    The brother and two children of Alexander having been in their turns,  as we have seen, murdered by their guardians, Cleopatra, his sister, and  Thessalonica, his niece, were alone left alive of the royal family  of Macedonia. Almost every one of the generals had already courted a  marriage with Cleopatra, which had either been refused by herself or  hindered by his rivals; and lastly Ptolemy, now that by the death of her  nephews she brought kingdoms, or the love of the Macedonian mercenaries,  which was worth more than kingdoms, as her dower, sent to ask her hand  in marriage. This offer was accepted by Cleopatra; but, on her journey  from Sardis, the capital of Lydia, to Egypt, on her way to join her  future husband, she was put to death by Antigonus. The niece was put  to death a few years later. Thus every one who was of the family of  Alexander paid the forfeit of life for that honour, and these two deaths  ended the Macedonian dynasty with a double tragedy.    While Ptolemy was busy in helping the Greek cities of Asia to gain their  liberty, Menelaus, his brother and admiral, was almost driven out of  Cyprus by Demetrius. On this Ptolemy got together his fleet, to the  number of one hundred and forty long galleys and two hundred transports,  manned with not less than ten thousand men, and sailed with them to the  help of his brother. This fleet, under the command of Menelaus, was met  by Demetrius with the fleet of Antigonus, consisting of one hundred and  twelve long galleys and a number of transports; and the Egyptian fleet,  which had hitherto been master of the sea, was beaten near the city  of Salamis in Cyprus by the smaller fleet of Demetrius. This was the  heaviest loss that had ever befallen Ptolemy. Eighty long galleys were  sunk, and forty long galleys, with one hundred transports and eight  thousand men, were taken prisoners. He could no longer hope to keep  Cyprus, and he sailed hastily back to Egypt, leaving to Demetrius the  garrisons of the island as his prisoners, all of whom were enrolled in  the army of Antigonus, to the number of sixteen thousand foot and six  hundred horse.    This naval victory gave Demetrius the means of unburdening his proud  mind of a debt of gratitude to his enemy; and accordingly, remembering  what Ptolemy had done after the battle of Gaza, he sent back to Egypt,  unasked for and unransomed, those prisoners who were of high rank, that  is to say, all those who had any choice about which side they fought  for; and among them were Leontiscus, the son, and Menelaus, the brother,  of Ptolemy.    Antigonus was overjoyed with the news of his son's victory. By lessening  the power of Ptolemy, it had done much to smooth his own path to the  sovereignty of Alexander's empire, which was then left without an heir;  and he immediately took the title of king, and gave the same title to  his son Demetrius. In this he was followed by Ptolemy and the other  generals, but with this difference, that while Antigonus called himself  king of all the provinces, Ptolemy called himself King of Egypt; and  while Antigonus gained Syria and Cyprus, Ptolemy gained the friendship  of every other kingdom and of every free city in Greece; they all looked  upon him as their best ally against Antigonus, the common enemy."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17331"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 11 (of 12) (#11)"],[1,"his eyes, he could  not distrust the answers which the priests gave to his questions.    From Alexandria Vespasian sent back Titus to finish the siege of  Jerusalem. The Jewish writer Joseph, the son of Matthias, or Flavius  Josephus, as he called himself when he entered the service of the  emperor, was then in Alexandria. He had been taken prisoner by  Vespasian, but had gained his freedom by the betrayal of his country's  cause. He joined the army of Titus and marched to the overthrow of  Jerusalem. Notwithstanding the obstinate and heroic struggles of the  Jews, Judaea was wholly conquered by the Romans, and Jerusalem and its  other fortresses either received Roman garrisons or were dismantled.  The Temple was overthrown in the month of September, A.D. 70. Titus made  slaves of ninety-seven thousand men, many of whom he led with him into  Egypt, and then sent them to work in the mines. These were soon followed  by a crowd of other brave Jews, who chose rather to quit their homes  and live as wanderers in Egypt than to own Vespasian as their king. They  knew no lord but Jahveh; to take the oaths or to pay tribute to Caesar  was to renounce the faith of their fathers. But they found no safety in  Egypt. Their Greek brethren turned against them, and handed six hundred  of them up to Lupus, the governor of Egypt, to be punished; and their  countryman Josephus brands them all with the name of Sicarii. They tried  to hide themselves in Thebes and other cities less under the eyes of the  Roman governor. They were, however, followed and taken, and the courage  with which the boys and mere children bore their sufferings, sooner than  acknowledge Vespasian for their king, drew forth the praise of even the  time-serving Josephus.    The Greek Jews of Egypt gained nothing by this treachery towards  their Hebrew brethren; they were themselves looked down upon by the  Alexandrians, and distrusted by the Romans. The emperor ordered Lupus to  shut up the temple at Onion, near Heliopolis, in which, during the last  three hundred years, they had been allowed to have an altar, in rivalry  to the Temple of Jerusalem. Even Josephus, whose betrayal of his  countrymen might have saved him from their enemies, was sent with many  others in chains to Rome, and was only set free on his making himself  known to Titus. Indeed, when the Hebrew Jews lost their capital and  their rank as a nation, their brethren felt lowered in the eyes of their  fellow-citizens, in whatever city they dwelt, and in Alexandria they  lost all hope of keeping their privileges; although the emperor refused  to repeal the edict which granted them their citizenship, an edict to  which they always appealed for protection, but often with very little  success.    The Alexandrians were sadly disappointed in Vespasian. They had been  among the first to acknowledge him as emperor while his power was yet  doubtful, and they looked for a sum of money as a largess; but to their  sorrow he increased the taxes, and re-established some which had fallen  into disuse. They had a joke against him, about his claiming from one of  his friends the trifling debt of six oboli; and, upon hearing of their  witticisms, he was so angry that he ordered this sum of six oboli to be  levied as a poll-tax upon every man in the city, and he only remitted  the tax at the request of his son Titus. He went to Rome, carrying with  him the nickname of Cybiosactes, _the scullion_, which the Alexandrians  gave him for his stinginess and greediness, and which they had before  given to Seleucus, who robbed the tomb of Alexander the Great, at  Alexandria, of its famous golden sarcophagus.    Titus saw the importance of pleasing the people; and his wish to humour  their ancient prejudices, at the ceremony of consecrating a new bull  as Apis, brought some blame upon him. He there, as became the occasion,  wore the state crown, and dazzled the people of Memphis with his regal  pomp; but, while thus endeavouring to strengthen his father's throne, he  was by some accused of grasping at it for himself.    The great temple of Kneph, at Latopolis, which had been the work of many  reigns and perhaps many centuries, was finished under Vespasian. It is  a building worthy of the best times of Egyptian architecture. It has a  grand portico, upheld by four rows of massive columns, with capitals in  the form of papyrus flowers. On the ceiling is a zodiac, like that at  Tentyra; and, though many other kings' names are carved on the walls,  that of Vespasian is in the dedication over the entrance.    Of the reign of Titus in Egypt we find no trace beyond his coins struck  each year at Alexandria, and his name carved on one or two temples which  had been built in former reigns.    Of the reign of Domitian (81--96 A.D.) we learn something from the poet  Juvenal, who then held a military post in the province; and he gives  us a sad account of the state of lawlessness in which the troops lived  under his commands. All quarrels between soldiers and citizens were  tried by the officers according to martial law; and justice was very  far from being even-handed between the Roman and the poor Egyptian.  No witness was bold enough to come forward and say anything against a  soldier, while everybody was believed who spoke on his behalf. Juvenal  was at a great age when he was sent into Egypt; and he felt that the  command of a cohort on the very borders of the desert was a cruel  banishment from the literary society of Rome. His death in the camp was  hastened by his wish to return home. As what Juvenal chiefly aimed at  in his writings was to lash the follies of the age, he, of course, found  plenty of amusement in the superstitions and sacred animals of Egypt.  But he sometimes takes a poet's liberty, and when he tells us that man's  was almost the only flesh that they ate without sinning, we need not  believe him to the letter. He gives a lively picture of a fight which he  saw between the citizens of two towns. The towns of Ombos and Tentyra,  though about a hundred miles apart, had a long-standing quarrel  about their gods. At Ombos they worshipped the crocodile and the  crocodile-headed god Savak, while at Tentyra they worshipped the goddess  Hathor, and were celebrated for their skill in catching and killing  crocodiles. So, taking advantage of a feast or holiday, they marched out  for a fight. The men of Ombos Avere beaten and put to flight; but one of  them, stumbling as he ran away, was caught and torn to pieces, and,  as Juvenal adds, eaten by the men of Tentyra. Their worship of beasts,  birds, and fishes, and even growing their gods in the garden, are  pleasantly hit off by him; they left nothing, said he, without worship,  but the goddess of chastity. The mother goddess, Isis, the queen of  heaven, was the deity to whom they bowed with the most tender devotion,  and to swear by Isis was their favourite oath; and hence the leek, in  their own language named Isi, was no doubt the vegetable called a god by  the satiric Juvenal.    At the same time also the towns of Oxyrrhynchos and Cynopolis, in  the Heptanomos, had a little civil war about the animals which  they worshipped. Somebody at Cynopolis was said to have caught an  oxyrrhynchus fish in the Nile and eaten it; and so the people of  Oxyrrhynchos, in revenge, made an attack upon the dogs, the gods of  Cynopolis. They caught a number of them, killed them in sacrifice to  their offended fish-god, and ate them. The two parties then flew to arms  and fought several battles; they sacked one another's cities in turns,  and the war was not stopped till the Roman troops marched to the spot  and punished them both.    But we gain a more agreeable and most likely a more true notion of the  mystical religion and philosophy of the Egyptians in these days from the  serious enquiries of Plutarch, who, instead of looking for what he could  laugh at, was only too ready to believe that he saw wisdom hidden  under an allegory in all their superstitions. Many of the habits of  the priests, such as shaving the whole body, wearing linen instead of  cotton, and refusing some meats as impure, seem to have arisen from a  love of cleanliness; their religion ordered what was useful. And it  also forbade what was hurtful; so to stir the fire with a sword was  displeasing to the gods, because it spoilt the temper of the metal.  None but the vulgar now looked upon the animals and statues as gods; the  priests believed that the unseen gods, who acted with one mind and with  one providence, were the authors of all good; and though these, like the  sun and moon, were called in each country by a different name, yet, like  those luminaries, they were the same over all the world.    [Illustration: 078b.jpg SCENE IN A SEPUUCHRAL CHAMBER]    Outward ceremonies in religion were no longer thought enough without a  good life; and, as the Greeks said, that beard and cloak did not make a  philosopher, so the Egyptians said that white linen and a tonsure  would not make a follower of Isis. All the sacrifices to the gods had a  secondary meaning, or, at least, they tried to join a moral aim to the  outward act; as on the twentieth day of the month, when they ate honey  and figs in honour of Thot, they sang \"Sweet is truth.\" The Egyptians,  like most other Eastern polytheists, held the doctrine which was  afterwards called Manicheism; they believed in a good and in a wicked  god, who governed the world between them. Of these the former made  himself threefold, because three is a perfect number, and they adopted  into their religion that curious metaphysical opinion that everything  divine is formed of three parts; and accordingly, on the Theban  monuments we often see the gods in groups of three. They worshipped  Osiris, Isis, and Horus under the form of a right-angled triangle, in  which Horus was the side opposite to the right angle. The favourite  part of their mythology was the lamentation of"]]]
