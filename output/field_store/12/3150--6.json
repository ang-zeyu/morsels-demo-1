We have now brought the history of the Caliphate down to the period  described in the last chapter as one of intellectual torpor for Islam.  It was a lethargy from which there seemed no awakening, and which to  contemporaries, Voltaire among the rest, seemed closely approximating to  the death of unbelief. In spite of Soliman's eternal arrangements, the  temporal power of the house of Othman was wofully diminished, and the  spiritual prestige of the Sultans was gone with Mussulmans. By the  middle of the last century the title of Caliph, even in their own  dominions, was all but forgotten, and the Court of Constantinople was  become a byword for its vice and infidelity. It can therefore be well  imagined that the awakening of religious feeling, which I also described  as having been produced by the Wahhabite movement, especially menaced  the Sultan in his Caliphal pretensions. By the beginning of the present  century the serious world of Islam was already ripening for a change,  and the title of the Caliphate seemed open to whoever should re-invent  and prove himself worthy to wear it. Two men certainly then dreamed of  its acquisition, both men of supreme genius, and holding the elements of  success in their hands. Nor can it be doubted that either of them would  have achieved his ambition but for the appearance against them of a  material power greater than their own, and which then, for the first  time, began to make itself felt as paramount in Asia. That power was  England, and the ambitions she thwarted there were those of Bonaparte  and Mehemet Ali.    It is not, I believe, sufficiently understood how vast a scheme was  overthrown by the Battle of the Nile. Napoleon's mind was formed for  dominion in the East, and where he failed in Europe he would have  infallibly succeeded in Asia. There little policies are useless, and  great ones root themselves in a congenial soil; and he was possessed  with an idea which must have flourished. His English opponents, judging  him only by the scale of their own thoughts, credited him with the  inferior design of invading India through Persia, and called it a mad  one; but India was, in fact, a small part only of his programme. When he  publicly pronounced the Kelemat at Cairo, and professed the faith of  Islam, he intended to be its Head, arguing rightly that what had been  possible three hundred years before to Selim was possible also then to  him. Nor would the Mussulman world have been much more astonished in  1799 at being asked to accept a Bonaparte for Caliph, than it was in  1519 at being asked to accept an Ottoman. With Napoleon's genius for  war, and but for the disastrous sea fight on the Nile, all this might  have been, and more; and it is conceivable that Europe, taken in  reverse by a great Moslem multitude, might have suffered worse disasters  than any the actual Napoleonic wars procured her, while a more durable  empire might have been founded on the Nile or Bosphorus than the  Bonapartes were able to establish on the Seine. As it was, it was an  episode and no more, useful only to the few who saw it near enough to  admire and understand.[11]    Among these who saw and understood was Mehemet Ali, the Albanian  adventurer, who undertook the government of Egypt when England restored  it to the Porte. Bonaparte from the first was his model, and he  inherited from him this vision of a new Caliphate, the greatest of the  Napoleonic ideas, and worked persistently to realize it. He was within  an ace of succeeding. In 1839 Mehemet Ali had Mecca, Cairo, and  Jerusalem in his hands, and he had defeated the Sultan at Konia, and was  advancing through Asia Minor on Constantinople. There, without doubt, he  would have proclaimed himself Caliph, having all the essential elements  of the Sultan's admitted right on which to found a new claim.    Nor is it probable that he would have found much religious opposition to  the realization of his scheme from the Turkish Ulema. These, already  alarmed by Sultan Murad's administrative reforms, would hardly have  espoused the Sultan's defence with any vigour; and though Mehemet Ali  himself was open to a charge of latitudinarianism, he had the one great  claim upon orthodox Islam of having delivered the Holy Cities of Mecca  and Medina from the Wahhabis. The house of Othman, indeed, at this time  had begun to stink--not only in the nostrils of the outside world, but  in that of the Hanefite school itself; and as these had formerly  accepted Selim, so they might very well, in 1839, have accepted Mehemet  Ali. But this attempt, too, was stopped by England in pursuance of a  policy which it is difficult now not to regret. The too venturous  Arnaout was sent back to his vice-royalty in Egypt, and the House of  Othman was entrusted with a new lease of spiritual sovereignty, if not  yet of spiritual power.    The reigns of Abd el Mejid and of Abd el Aziz are remarkable with  Mussulmans as having witnessed a complete dissociation of interests  between the Imperial Government and the Old Hanefite school of Ulema. I  have no space here to discuss the nature of the reforms attempted and  partly effected in the Ottoman Empire between the years 1839 and 1869 as  a concession to the clamour of Europe. They were instituted not by and  through religion, as they should have been, but in defiance of it, and  so failed to find acceptance anywhere with religious people. All changes  so attempted must fail in Islam because they have in them the inevitable  vice of illegality, and I hope to have an opportunity of explaining  later the manner in which alone a true reform can hope to find  acceptance. For the present I only note the promulgation of the Hatti  Humayoum and its kindred decrees as points in the history of the Ottoman  Caliphate's decline, and as direct reasons for the reactionary change of  front which we now witness in the policy of Constantinople.    Abd el Mejid for his ill-judged attempts gained with Mussulmans the name  of an unbeliever, and his son was deposed in the way we all know as a  breaker of the religious law. For a moment, however, Abd el Aziz seems  to have seen the true nature of his position and to have had some idea  of the _role_ required of him, as the following incident will show. It  marks at any rate the epoch pretty exactly when a revival of the  Sultan's spiritual pretensions, as a settled policy, was first resolved  on in Turkey. The circumstances have been narrated to me as follows:--    Quite in the early days of Abd el Aziz's reign a certain statesman, a  man of original genius and profoundly versed in the knowledge both of  Europe and of the East, and especially of the religious history of  Islam, came to Constantinople. He was a friend of Rushdi Pasha, then the  Grand Vizier, and of others of the party of Young Turkey, men who were  seeking by every means, fair and foul, to reorganize and strengthen the  central authority of the Empire. To these, and subsequently, in an  interview, to the Sultan himself, he urged the advantage which might  accrue to the Ottoman Government both as a means of controlling the  provinces and as a weapon against European diplomacy if the spiritual  authority of the Sultan as Caliph were put more prominently forward. He  suggested especially to Abd el Aziz that his real strength lay in the  reorganization not of his temporal but of his spiritual forces; and he  expressed his wonder that so evident a source of strength had been so  little drawn on. He pointed out the importance of the Mussulman  populations outside the Empire to the Sultan, and urged that these  should be brought as much as possible within the sphere of  Constantinople influence. The Barbary States, Mussulman India, and  Central Asia might thus become to all intents and purposes, save that of  tribute, subjects of the Porte.    In early times it had been a duty of the Caliphs to appoint in all the  provinces of Islam Imams or deputies to represent their spiritual  authority, and it was suggested that these should once more be  appointed. An Imam, or leader of their public prayer, is a necessity  with orthodox Mussulmans, and in default of legal appointment from the  Caliph, who is himself the supreme Imam, the faithful had been  constrained to apply either to the local governments for such  appointment or to elect the functionary themselves. This they  acknowledged to be illegal, and would willingly revert to the more  legitimate system; while the re-establishment of such a hierarchy would  bring an enormous accession of spiritual power to Constantinople. It was  also shown to Abd el Aziz how all-important Arabia was to his position,  and how greatly the means of influence there had been neglected.    I am informed by one present at this interview that Abd el Aziz was not  only delighted at the idea, but profoundly astonished. He seems to have  had no notion previously either of the historical dignity of the  spiritual office he held nor of its prerogatives, and for a while his  thoughts were turned in the direction pointed out to him. He sent for  the chief Ulema and asked them if all he heard was true; and, when he  found their ideas to be entirely in unison with the advice just given  him, he commissioned the Sheykh el Islam to push forward the doctrine of  his spiritual leadership by all the means in his power. Missionaries  were consequently despatched to every part of the Mussulman world, and  especially to India and the Barbary States, to explain the Hanefite  dogma of the Caliphate; and though at first these met with little  success they eventually gained their object in those countries where  believers were obliged to live under infidel rule, so much so that in a  few years the Ottoman Caliphate became once more a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1722"],[0,"Martin Luther's Large Catechism, translated (#11)"],[1,"and vow to maintain perpetual chastity, and,  besides, deceive the simple-minded with lying words and appearances  [impostures]. For no one has so little love and inclination to chastity  as just those who because of great sanctity avoid marriage, and either  indulge in open and shameless prostitution, or secretly do even worse,  so that one dare not speak of it, as has, alas! been learned too fully.  And, in short, even though they abstain from the act, their hearts are  so full of unchaste thoughts and evil lusts that there is a continual  burning and secret suffering, which can be avoided in the married life.  Therefore all vows of chastity out of the married state are condemned  by this commandment, and free permission is granted, yea, even the  command is given, to all poor ensnared consciences which have been  deceived by their monastic vows to abandon the unchaste state and enter  the married life, considering that even if the monastic life were  godly, it would nevertheless not be in their power to maintain  chastity, and if they remain in it, they must only sin more and more  against this commandment.    Now, I speak of this in order that the young may be so guided that they  conceive a liking for the married estate, and know that it is a blessed  estate and pleasing to God. For in this way we might in the course of  time bring it about that married life be restored to honor, and that  there might be less of the filthy, dissolute, disorderly doings which  now run riot the world over in open prostitution and other shameful  vices arising from disregard of married life. Therefore it is the duty  of parents and the government to see to it that our youth be brought up  to discipline and respectability, and when they have come to years of  maturity, to provide for them [to have them married] in the fear of God  and honorably; He would not fail to add His blessing and grace, so that  men would have joy and happiness from the same.    Let me now say in conclusion that this commandment demands not only  that every one live chastely in thought, word, and deed in his  condition, that is, especially in the estate of matrimony, but also  that every one love and esteem the spouse given him by God. For where  conjugal chastity is to be maintained, man and wife must by all means  live together in love and harmony, that one may cherish the other from  the heart and with entire fidelity. For that is one of the principal  points which enkindle love and desire of chastity, so that, where this  is found, chastity will follow as a matter of course without any  command. Therefore also St. Paul so diligently exhorts husband and wife  to love and honor one another. Here you have again a precious, yea,  many and great good works, of which you can joyfully boast, against all  ecclesiastical estates, chosen without God's Word and commandment.     The Seventh Commandment.    Thou shalt not steal.    After your person and spouse temporal property comes next. That also  God wishes to have protected, and He has commanded that no one shall  subtract from, or curtail, his neighbor's possessions. For to steal is  nothing else than to get possession of another's property wrongfully,  which briefly comprehends all kinds of advantage in all sorts of trade  to the disadvantage of our neighbor. Now, this is indeed quite a  wide-spread and common vice, but so little regarded and observed that  it exceeds all measure, so that if all who are thieves, and yet do not  wish to be called such, were to be hanged on gallows the world would  soon be devastated and there would be a lack both of executioners and  gallows. For, as we have just said, to steal is to signify not only to  empty our neighbor's coffer and pockets, but to be grasping in the  market, in all stores, booths, wine- and beer-cellars, workshops, and,  in short, wherever there is trading or taking and giving of money for  merchandise or labor.    As, for instance, to explain this somewhat grossly for the common  people, that it may be seen how godly we are: When a manservant or  maid-servant does not serve faithfully in the house, and does damage,  or allows it to be done when it could be prevented, or otherwise ruins  and neglects the goods entrusted to him, from indolence idleness, or  malice, to the spite and vexation of master and mistress, and in  whatever way this can be done purposely (for I do not speak of what  happens from oversight and against one's will), you can in a year  abscond thirty, forty florins, which if another had taken secretly or  carried away, he would be hanged with the rope. But here you [while  conscious of such a great theft] may even bid defiance and become  insolent, and no one dare call you a thief.    The same I say also of mechanics, workmen, and day-laborers, who all  follow their wanton notions, and never know enough ways to overcharge  people, while they are lazy and unfaithful in their work. All these are  far worse than sneak-thieves, against whom we can guard with locks and  bolts, or who, if apprehended, are treated in such a manner that they  will not do the same again. But against these no one can guard, no one  dare even look awry at them or accuse them of theft, so that one would  ten times rather lose from his purse. For here are my neighbors, good  friends, my own servants, from whom I expect good [every faithful and  diligent service], who defraud me first of all.    Furthermore, in the market and in common trade likewise, this practice  is in full swing and force to the greatest extent, where one openly  defrauds another with bad merchandise, false measures, weights, coins,  and by nimbleness and queer finances or dexterous tricks takes  advantage of him; likewise, when one overcharges a person in a trade  and wantonly drives a hard bargain, skins and distresses him. And who  can recount or think of all these things? To sum up, this is the  commonest craft and the largest guild on earth, and if we regard the  world throughout all conditions of life, it is nothing else than a  vast, wide stall, full of great thieves.    Therefore they are also called swivel-chair robbers, land- and  highway-robbers, not pick-locks and sneak-thieves who snatch away the  ready cash, but who sit on the chair [at home] and are styled great  noblemen, and honorable, pious citizens, and yet rob and steal under a  good pretext.    Yes, here we might be silent about the trifling individual thieves if  we were to attack the great, powerful arch-thieves with whom lords and  princes keep company, who daily plunder not only a city or two, but all  Germany. Yea, where should we place the head and supreme protector of  all thieves, the Holy Chair at Rome with all its retinue, which has  grabbed by theft the wealth of all the world, and holds it to this day?      This is, in short, the course of the world: whoever can steal and rob  openly goes free and secure, unmolested by any one, and even demands  that he be honored. Meanwhile the little sneak-thieves, who have once  trespassed, must bear the shame and punishment to render the former  godly and honorable. But let them know that in the sight of God they  are the greatest thieves, and that He will punish them as they are  worthy and deserve.    Now, since this commandment is so far-reaching [and comprehensive], as  just indicated, it is necessary to urge it well and to explain it to  the common people, not to let them go on in their wantonness and  security, but always to place before their eyes the wrath of God, and  inculcate the same. For we have to preach this not to Christians, but  chiefly to knaves and scoundrels, to whom it would be more fitting for  judges, jailers, or Master Hannes [the executioner] to preach.  Therefore let every one know that it is his duty, at the risk of God's  displeasure, not only to do no injury to his neighbor, nor to deprive  him of gain, nor to perpetrate any act of unfaithfulness or malice in  any bargain or trade, but faithfully to preserve his property for him,  to secure and promote his advantage, especially when one accepts money,  wages, and one's livelihood for such service.    He now who wantonly despises this may indeed pass along and escape the  hangman, but he shall not escape the wrath and punishment of God; and  when he has long practiced his defiance and arrogance, he shall yet  remain a tramp and beggar, and, in addition, have all plagues and  misfortune. Now you are going your way [wherever your heart's pleasure  calls you] while you ought to preserve the property of your master and  mistress, for which service you fill your crop and maw, take your wages  like a thief, have people treat you as a nobleman; for there are many  that are even insolent towards their masters and mistresses, and are  unwilling to do them a favor or service by which to protect them from  loss.    But reflect what you will gain when, having come into your own  property and being set up in your home (to which God will help with all  misfortunes), it [your perfidy] will bob up again and come home to you,  and you will find that where you have cheated or done injury to the  value of one mite, you will have to pay thirty again.    Such shall be the lot also of mechanics and day-laborers of whom we are  now obliged to hear and suffer such intolerable maliciousness, as  though they were noblemen in another's possessions, and every one were  obliged to give them what they demand. Just let them continue  practicing their exactions as long as they can; but God will not forget  His commandment, and will reward them according as they have served,  and will hang them, not upon a green gallows, but upon a dry one so  that all their life they shall neither prosper nor accumulate anything.  And indeed, if there were a well-ordered government in the land, such  wantonness might soon be checked and prevented, as was the custom in  ancient times among the Romans, where such characters were"]]]
