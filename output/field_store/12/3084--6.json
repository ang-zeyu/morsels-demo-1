The Government, moreover,  found it necessary to establish a special department for Jewish affairs  at each municipality and town council. In this way the law managed to  destroy the self-government of the Kahal and yet preserve its  rudimentary function as an autonomous fiscal agency which was to be  continued under the auspices of the municipality. In point of fact, the  Kahal, which, through its \"trustees\" and \"captors,\" had acted the part  of a Government tool in carrying out the dreadful military conscription,  had long become thoroughly demoralized and had lost its former prestige  as a great Jewish institution. Its transformation into a purely fiscal  agency was merely the formal ratification of a sad fact.    Having disposed of the Kahal as a vehicle of Jewish \"separatism,\" the  Government next attacked the special Jewish \"system of taxation,\" not to  abolish it, of course, but rather to place it under a more rigorous  control for the purpose of preventing it from serving in the hands of  the Jews as an instrument for the attainment of specific Jewish ends. It  is significant that on the same day on which the Kahal ukase was made  public was also issued the new \"Regulation Concerning the Basket Tax.\"  [1] The revenue from this tax which had for a long time been imposed  upon Kosher meat was originally placed at the free disposal of the  Kahals, though subject, since 1839, to the combined control of the  administration and municipality. According to the new enactment, the  proceeds from the meat tax which was to be let to the highest bidder  were to be left entirely in the hands of the gubernatorial  administration. The latter was instructed to see to it that the income  from the tax should first be applied to cover the fiscal arrears of the  Jews, then to provide for the maintenance of the Crown schools and the  official promotion of agriculture among Jews, and only as a last item to  be spent on the local charities.    [Footnote 1: The tax is called in Russian _korobochny sbor_, or, for  short, _korobka_, a word related to German _Korb_. It was partly in use  already under the Polish regime.]    In addition to the general basket tax, imposed upon all Jews who use  Kosher meat, an \"auxiliary basket tax\" was instituted to be levied on  immovable property as well as on business pursuits and bequests.  Moreover, following the Austrian model, the Government instituted, or  rather reinstituted, the \"candle tax,\" a toll on Sabbath candles. The  proceeds from this impost on a religions ceremony were to go  specifically towards the organization of the Jewish Crown schools, and  were placed entirely at the disposal of the Ministry of Public  Instruction.    Thus in exact proportion to the curtailment of communal autonomy,  voluntary self-taxation was gradually supplanted by compulsory  Government taxation, a circumstance which not only increased the  financial burden of the Jewish masses, but also tended to aggravate it  from a moral point of view. The \"tax,\" as the meat tax was called for  short, became in the course of time one of the scourges of Jewish  communal life, that same life which the \"measures\" of the Government had  merely succeeded in disorganizing.    Anxious as the Government was to act diplomatically and, for fear of  intensifying the distrust of Russian Jewry towards the new scheme, to  stem the flood of restrictions during the execution of the school  reform, it could not long restrain itself. The third plank in the  platform of the Jewish Committee, the increase of Jewish disabilities,  which had hitherto been kept in reserve, was now pressing forward, and  issued forth from the recesses of the chancelleries somewhat earlier  than tactical considerations might have dictated. On April 20, 1843,  while the \"enlightenment\" propaganda was in full swing, there suddenly  appeared, in the form of a resolution appended by the Tzar's own hand to  the report of the Council of Ministers, the following curt ukase:      All Jews living within the fifty verst zone along the Prussian and    Austrian frontier are to be transferred into the interior of the    (border) governments. Those possessing their own houses are to be    granted a term of two years within which to sell them. _To be    carried out without any excuses._    On the receipt of this grim command, the Senate was at first puzzled as  to whether the imperial order was a mere repetition of the former law  concerning the expulsion of the Jews from the villages and hamlets on  the frontier,[1] or whether it was a new law involving the expulsion of  all Jews on the border, without discrimination, including those in the  cities and towns. Swayed by the harsh and emphatic tone of the imperial  resolution, the Senate decided to interpret the new order in the sense  of a complete and absolute expulsion. This interpretation received the  Tzar's approbation, except that the time-limit for the expulsion of real  estate owners was extended for two years more and the ruined exiles were  promised temporary relief from taxation.    [Footnote 1: See above, p. 40.]    The new catastrophe which descended upon tens of thousands of families,  particularly in the government of Kovno, caused a cry of horror, not  only throughout the border-zone but also abroad. When the Jews doomed to  expulsion were ordered by the police to state the places whither they  intended to emigrate, nineteen communities refused to comply with this  demand, and declared that they would not abandon their hearths and the  graves of their forefathers and would only yield to force. Public  opinion in Western Europe was running high with indignation. The French,  German, and English papers condemned in no uncertain terms the policy of  \"New Spain.\" Many Jewish communities in Germany petitioned the Russian  Government to revoke the terrible expulsion decree. There was even an  attempt at diplomatic intervention. During his stay in England, Nicholas  I. was approached on behalf of the Jews by personages of high rank. Yet  the Government would scarcely have yielded to public protests, had it  not become patent that it was impossible to carry out the decree without  laying waste entire cities and thereby affecting injuriously the  interests of the exchequer. The fatal ukase was not officially repealed,  but the Government did not insist on its execution.    In the meantime the \"Jewish Committee\" kept up a correspondence with the  governors-general in regard to the ways and means of carrying into  effect the third article of its program, the \"assortment,\" or  \"classification\" of the Jews. The plan called for the division of all  Russian Jews into two categories, into useful and useless ones. The  former category was to consist of merchants affiliated with guilds,  artisans belonging to trade-unions, agriculturists, and those of the  burgher class who owned immovable property with a definite income. All  other burghers who could not claim such a financial status and had no  definite income, in other words, the large mass of petty tradesmen and  paupers, were to be labelled as \"useless\" or \"detrimental,\" and  subjected to increased disabilities.    The inquiry of the Ministry of the Interior regarding the feasibility of  such an \"assortment\" met with a strongly-worded rebuttal from the  governor-general of New Russia, Vorontzov. While on a leave of absence  in London, this Russian dignitary, who had evidently been affected by  English ideas, prepared a memorandum and sent it, in October, 1843, to  St. Petersburg with the request to have it submitted to the Tzar.      I venture to think--quoth Vorontzov with reference to the projected    segregation of the \"useless\" Jews--that the application of the term    \"useless\" to several hundred thousand people who by the will of the    Almighty have lived In this Empire from ancient times is in itself    both cruel and unjust. The project labels as \"useless\" all those    numerous Jews who are engaged either in the retail purchase of goods    from their original manufacturers for delivery to wholesale    merchants, or in the useful distribution among the consumers of the    merchandise obtained from the wholesalers. Judging impartially, one    cannot help wondering how these numerous tradesmen can be regarded    as useless and consequently as detrimental, if one bears in mind    that by their petty and frequently maligned pursuits they promote      not only rural but also commercial life.    The atrocious scheme of \"assorting\" the Jews is nailed  down by Vorontzov as \"a bloody operation over a whole class  of people,\" which is threatened \"not only with hardships, but  also with annihilation through poverty.\"      I venture to think--with these words Vorontzov concludes his    memorandum--that this measure is both harmful, and cruel. On the one    side, hundreds of thousands of hands which assist petty industry in    the provinces will be turned aside, when there is no possibility,    and for a long time there will be none, of replacing them. On the    other side, the cries and moans of such an enormous number of    unfortunates will serve as a reproach to our Government not only in    our own country but also beyond the confines of Russia.    Since the time of Speranski and the like-minded members of the \"Jewish  Committee\" of 1803 and 1812[1] the leading spheres of St. Petersburg had  had no chance to hear such courageous and truthful words. Vorontzov's  objections implied a crushing criticism of the whole fallacious economic  policy of the Government in branding the petty tradesmen and middlemen  as an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15767"],[0,"The Texan Scouts: A Story of the Alamo and Goliad (#11)"],[1,"e've got only  three horses, we're about out of food, an' we're a long distance from  the main Texas settlements. It ain't any use fur us to start to rippin'  an' t'arin' unless we've got somethin' to rip an' t'ar with.\"    \"Good words,\" said Obed White. \"A speech in time saves errors nine.\"    \"I am glad you have put the question, Mr. Palmer,\" said Roylston. \"Our  affairs have come to a crisis, and we must consider. I, too, wish to  help Texas, but I can help it more by other ways than battle.\"    It did not occur to any of them to doubt him. He had already established  over them the mental ascendency that comes from a great mind used to  dealing with great affairs.    \"But we are practically dismounted,\" he continued. \"It is winter and we  do not know what would happen to us if we undertook to roam over the  prairies as we are. On the other hand, we have an abundance of arms and  ammunition and a large and well-built cabin. I suggest that we supply  ourselves with food, and stay here until we can acquire suitable mounts.  We may also contrive to keep a watch upon any Mexican armies that may be  marching north. I perhaps have more reason than any of you for hastening  away, but I can spend the time profitably in regaining the use of my  limbs.\"    \"Your little talk sounds mighty good to me,\" said the Panther. \"In fact,  I don't see anything else to do. This cabin must have been built an'  left here 'speshully fur us. We know, too, that the Texans have all gone  home, thinkin' that the war is over, while we know different an' mebbe  we can do more good here than anywhere else. What do you say, boys? Do  we stay?\"    \"We stay,\" replied all together.    They went to work at once fitting up their house. More firewood was  brought in. Fortunately the men had been provided with hatchets, in the  frontier style, which their rescuers had not neglected to bring away,  and they fixed wooden hooks in the walls for their extra arms and  clothing. A half dozen scraped away a large area of the thin snow and  enabled the horses to find grass. A fine spring two hundred yards away  furnished a supply of water.    After the horses had eaten Obed, the Panther and Ned rode away in search  of game, leaving Mr. Roylston in command at the cabin.    The snow was no longer falling, and that which lay on the ground was  melting rapidly.    \"I know this country,\" said the Panther, \"an' we've got four chances for  game. It may be buffalo, it may be deer, it may be antelope, and it may  be wild turkeys. I think it most likely that we'll find buffalo. We're  so fur west of the main settlements that they're apt to hang 'roun'  here in the winter in the creek bottoms, an' if it snows they'll take to  the timber fur shelter.\"    \"And it has snowed,\" said Ned.    \"Jest so, an' that bein' the case we'll search the timber. Of course big  herds couldn't crowd in thar, but in this part of the country we  gen'rally find the buffalo scattered in little bands.\"    They found patches of forest, generally dwarfed in character, and looked  diligently for the great game. Once a deer sprang out of a thicket, but  sped away so fast they did not get a chance for a shot. At length Obed  saw large footprints in the thinning snow, and called the Panther's  attention to them. The big man examined the traces critically.    \"Not many hours old,\" he said. \"I'm thinkin' that we'll have buffalo  steak fur supper. We'll scout all along this timber. What we want is a  young cow. Their meat is not tough.\"    They rode through the timber for about two hours, when Ned caught sight  of moving figures on the far side of a thicket. He could just see the  backs of large animals, and he knew that there were their buffalo. He  pointed them out to the Panther, who nodded.    \"We'll ride 'roun' the thicket as gently as possible,\" he said, \"an'  then open fire. Remember, we want a tender young cow, two of 'em if we  can get 'em, an' don't fool with the bulls.\"    Ned's heart throbbed as Old Jack bore him around the thicket. He had  fought with men, but he was not yet a buffalo hunter. Just as they  turned the flank of the bushes a huge buffalo bull, catching their odor,  raised his head and uttered a snort. The Panther promptly fired at a  young cow just beyond him. The big bull, either frightened or angry,  leaped head down at Old Jack. The horse was without experience with  buffaloes, but he knew that those sharp horns meant no good to him, and  he sprang aside with so much agility that Ned was almost unseated.    The big bull rushed on, and Ned, who had retained his hold upon his  rifle, was tempted to take a shot at him for revenge, but, remembering  the Panther's injunction, he controlled the impulse and fired at a young  cow.    When the noise and confusion were over and the surviving buffaloes had  lumbered away, they found that they had slain two of the young cows and  that they had an ample supply of meat.    \"Ned,\" said the Panther, \"you know how to go back to the cabin, don't  you?\"    \"I can go straight as an arrow.\"    \"Then ride your own horse, lead the other two an' bring two men. We'll  need 'em with the work here.\"    The Panther and Obed were already at work skinning the cows. Ned sprang  upon Old Jack, and rode away at a trot, leading the other two horses by  their lariats. The snow was gone now and the breeze was almost balmy.  Ned felt that great rebound of the spirits of which the young are so  capable. They had outwitted Urrea, they had taken his prisoners from  him, and then had escaped across the Rio Grande. They had found shelter  and now they had obtained a food supply. They were all good comrades  together, and what more was to be asked?    He whistled as he rode along, but when he was half way back to the cabin  he noticed something in a large tree that caused him to stop. He saw the  outlines of great bronze birds, and he knew that they were wild turkeys.  Wild turkeys would make a fine addition to their larder, and, halting  Old Jack, he shot from his back, taking careful aim at the largest of  the turkeys. The huge bird fell, and as the others flew away Ned was  lucky enough to bring down a second with a pistol shot.    His trophies were indeed worth taking, and tying their legs together  with a withe he hung them across his saddle bow. He calculated that the  two together weighed nearly sixty pounds, and he rode triumphantly when  he came in sight of the cabin.    Will saw him first and gave a shout that drew the other men.    \"What luck?\" hailed young Allen.    \"Not much,\" replied Ned, \"but I did get these sparrows.\"    He lifted the two great turkeys from his saddle and tossed them to Will.  The boy caught them, but he was borne to his knees by their weight. The  men looked at them and uttered approving words.    \"What did you do with the Panther and Obed?\" asked Fields.    \"The last I saw of them they had been dismounted and were being chased  over the plain by two big bull buffaloes. The horns of the buffaloes  were then not more than a foot from the seats of their trousers. So I  caught their horses, and I have brought them back to camp.\"    \"I take it,\" said Fields, \"that you've had good luck.\"    \"We have had the finest of luck,\" replied Ned. \"We ran into a group of  fifteen or twenty buffaloes, and we brought down two fine, young cows. I  came back for two more men to help with them, and on my way I shot these  turkeys.\"    Fields and another man named Carter returned with Ned. Young Allen was  extremely anxious to go, but the others were chosen on account of their  experience with the work. They found that Obed and the Panther had  already done the most of it, and when it was all finished Fields and  Carter started back with the three horses, heavily laden. As the night  promised to be mild, and the snow was gone, Ned, Obed and the Panther  remained in the grove with the rest of their food supply.    They also wished to preserve the two buffalo robes, and they staked them  out upon the ground, scraping them clean of flesh with their knives.  Then they lighted a fire and cooked as much of the tender meat as they  wished. By this time it was dark and they were quite ready to rest. They  put out the fire and raked up the beds of leaves on which they would  spread their blankets. But first they enjoyed the relaxation of the  nerves and the easy talk that come after a day's work well done.    \"It certainly has been a fine day for us,\" said Obed. \"Sometimes I like  to go through the bad days, because it makes the good days that follow  all the better. Yesterday we were wandering around in the snow, and we  had nothing, to-day we have a magnificent city home, that is to say, the  cabin, and a beautiful country place, that is to say, this grove. I can  add, too, that our nights in our country place are spent to the  accompaniment of music. Listen to that beautiful song, won't you?\"    A long, whining howl rose, sank and died. After an interval they heard  its exact duplicate and the Panther remarked tersely:    \"Wolves. Mighty hungry, too. They've smelled our buffalo meat and they  want it. Guess from their big voices that they're timber wolves and not  coyotes.\"    Ned knew that the timber wolf was a much larger and fiercer animal than  his prairie brother, and he did not altogether like this whining sound  which now rose and died for the third time.    \"Must be a dozen or so,\" said the Panther, noticing the increasing  volume of sound. \"We'll light the fire again. Nothing is smarter than a  wolf, an' I don't want one of those hulkin' brutes to slip up, seize a  fine piece of buffalo and dash away with it. But fire will hold 'em. How  a wolf does dread it! The little red flame is like a knife in his  heart.\"    They lighted four small fires, making a rude ring which inclosed their  leafy beds and the buffalo skins and meat. Before they finished the task  they saw slim dusky figures among the trees and red eyes glaring at  them. The Panther"]]]
