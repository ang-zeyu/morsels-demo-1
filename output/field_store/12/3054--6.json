IX    EXPERIMENTS IN THE INTEREST OF SHIP SERVICE      Where the avoidance of accidents is in question, the test of a special  experimental method can seldom be made dependent upon a comparison  with practical results, as we do not want to wait until the candidate  has brought human life into danger. The ordinary way of reaching the  goal must therefore be an indirect one in such cases. For the study of  motormen the conditions are exceptionally favorable, as hundreds of  thousands of accidents occur every year, but another practical example  may be chosen from a field where it is, indeed, impossible to  correlate the results with actual misfortunes, because the dangerous  situations occur seldom; and nevertheless on account of their  importance they demand most serious study. I refer to the ship  service, where the officer on the bridge may bring thousands into  danger by one single slip of his mind. I turn to this as a further  concrete illustration in order to characterize at once the lengths to  which such vocational studies may advance.    One of the largest ship companies had approached me--long before the  disaster of the Titanic occurred--with the question whether it would  not be possible to find psychological methods for the elimination of  such ship officers as would not be able to face an unexpected suddenly  occurring complication. The director of the company wrote to me that  in his experience the real danger for the great ships lies in the  mental dispositions of the officers. They all know exactly what is to  be done in every situation, but there are too many who do not react in  the appropriate way when an unexpected combination of factors suddenly  confronts them, such as the quick approach of a ship in the fog. He  claimed that two different types ought to be excluded. There are ship  officers who know the requirements excellently, but who are almost  paralyzed when the dangerous conditions suddenly threaten. Their  ability for action is inhibited. In one moment they want to act under  the stimulus of one impression, but before the impulse is realized,  some other perhaps rather indifferent impression forces itself on  their minds and suggests the counteraction, and in this way they  vacillate and remain inactive until it is too late to give the right  order or to press the right button. The other type feels only the  necessity for rapid action, and under the pressure of greatest haste,  without clear thought, they jump to the first decision which rushes  to their minds. Without carefully considering the conditions really  given, they explode in an action which they would never have chosen in  a state of quiet deliberation. They react on any accidental  circumstance, just as at a fire men sometimes carry out and save the  most useless parts of their belongings. Of course, beside these two  types, there is the third type, the desirable one, the men who in the  unexpected situation quickly review the totality of the factors in  their relative importance and with almost instinctive certainty  immediately come to the same decision to which they would have arrived  after quiet thought. The director of the company insisted that it  would be of highest importance for the ship service to discriminate  these three types of human beings, and to make sure that there stand  on the bridge of the ship only men who do not belong to those two  dangerous classes. He turned to me with this request, as he had heard  of the work toward economic psychology in the Harvard laboratory.    As the problem interested me, I carried on a long series of  experiments in order to construct artificial conditions under which  the mental process of decision in a complicated situation, especially  the rapidity, correctness, and constancy of the decision, could be  made measurable. I started from the conviction that this complex act  of decision must stand in definite relation to a number of simpler  mental functions. If, for instance, it stood in a clear definite  relation to the process of association, or discrimination, or  suggestibility, or perception, or memory, and so on, it would be  rather easy to foresee the behavior of the individual in the act of  decision, as every one of those other simple mental functions could be  tested by routine methods of the psychological laboratory. This  consideration led me to propose ramified investigations concerning the  psychology of decision in its relation to the elementary mental  processes. These studies by students of the laboratory are not yet  completed. But I soon saw that they would be unfit for the solution of  my practical problem, as we recognized that these relations between  the complex act of decision and the elementary functions of the  individual seem to have different form with different types of  men.[12] If I was to approach the solution of the practical problem,  accordingly, I had to reproduce in an experimental form the act of  decision under complex conditions.    It seemed necessary to create a situation in which a number of  quantitatively measurable factors were combined without any one of  them forcing itself to consciousness as the most important. The  subject to be experimented on then has to decide as quickly as  possible which of the factors is the relatively strongest one. As  usual, here, too, I began with rather complicated material and only  slowly did I simplify the apparatus until it finally took an entirely  inconspicuous form. But this is surely the most desirable outcome for  testing methods which are to be applied to large numbers of persons.  Complicated instruments, for the handling of which special training is  needed, are never so useful for practical purposes as the simple  schemes which can be easily applied. The form of which I finally made  use is the following. I work with 24 cards of the size of  playing-cards. On the upper half of every one of these cards we have 4  rows of 12 capital letters, namely, A, E, O, and U in irregular  repetition. On 4 cards, one of these vowels appears 21 times and each  of the three others 9 times; on 8 cards, one appears 18 times and  every one of the three others 10 times; on 8 cards, one appears 15  times and each of the others 11 times; and finally, on 4 cards one  vowel appears 16 times, each of the three others 8 times, and besides  them 8 different consonants are mixed in. The person to be tested has  to distribute these 24 cards as quickly as possible in 4 piles, in  such a way that in the first pile are placed all cards in which the  letter A is most frequent, in the second those in which the letter E  predominates, and so on. As a matter of course the result must never  be secured by counting the letters. Any attempt to act against this  prescription and secretly to begin counting would moreover delay the  decision so long that the final result would be an unsatisfactory  achievement anyhow. It would accordingly bring no advantage to the  candidate.    We measure with a stopwatch in fifths of a second the time for the  whole process from the subject's looking at the first card to his  laying down of the last card, and, secondly, we record the number and  the character of his mistakes, if cards are put into wrong piles. I  have made the experiment with very many persons, and results show that  those various mental traits which have been observed in the practical  ship service come clearly to light under the conditions of this  experiment. Some of the persons lose their heads entirely, and for  many of them it is a painful activity for which they require a long  time. Even if the number of mistakes is not considerable, they  themselves have the feeling that they are not coming to a satisfactory  decision, because their attention is pulled hither and thither so that  they feel an inner mental paralysis. Some chance letters stand out and  appear to them to be predominant, but in the next moment the attention  is captured by some other letters which bring the suggestion that  they are in the majority and that they present the most important  factor. The outcome is that inner state of indecision which can become  so fatal in practical life. Other subjects distribute the cards in  piles at a relatively high speed, and they do it with the subjective  feeling that they have indeed recognized at the first glance the  predominant group of letters. The exact measurement of the results,  however, shows that they commit many errors which would have been  improbable after quiet consideration. Any small group of letters which  catches their eye makes on them, under the pressure of their haste,  such a strong impression that all the other letters are inhibited for  the moment and the wrong decision is quickly made. Finally, we find a  group of persons who carry out the experiment rather quickly and at  the same time with few mistakes. It is characteristic of them to pass  through it with the feeling that it is an agreeable and stimulating  mental activity. In all cases the subjects feel themselves under the  unified impression which results from all those 48 letters of the card  together; and this is the reason why the qualitative manifoldness of a  practical life situation can be compared with these intermingled,  quantitatively determined groups of letters.    If I consider the general results of these experiments only with  reference to the time-measurement, I should say that a person who  completes the distribution of the cards in less than 80 seconds is  quick in his decisions; from 80 to 150, moderately quick; from 150 to  250, slow and deliberate and rather too deliberate for situations  which demand quick action; over 250 seconds, he would belong among  those wavering persons who hesitate too long in a life situation which  demands decision. The time which is needed for the mere distribution  of the cards themselves plays a very "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15164"],[0,"Folk Tales Every Child Should Know (#11)"],[1,"direction, but not fallen. Under the chimney sat a servant, who held in  one hand a piece of roast meat, and with the other lifted a mouthful  toward his mouth, which never reached it; when it was just in front of  his mouth, he had also been turned to stone. Many others he saw there  turned to stone, each in the position in which he was when the wizard  said, \"Be turned into stone.\" He likewise saw many fine horses turned to  stone, and in the castle and round the castle all was desolate and dead;  there were trees, but without leaves; there were meadows, but without  grass; there was a river but it did not flow; nowhere was there even a  singing bird, or a flower, the offspring of the ground, or a white fish  in the water.    Morning, noon, and evening the prince and his companions found good and  abundant entertainment in the castle; the viands came of themselves, the  wine poured itself out. After supper the folding doors opened again, and  the wizard brought in the princess for the prince to guard. And although  they all determined to exert themselves with all their might not to fall  asleep, yet it was of no use, fall asleep again they did. And when the  prince awoke at dawn and saw the princess had vanished, he jumped up and  pulled Sharpsight by the arm, \"Hey! get up, Sharpsight, do you know  where the princess is?\" He rubbed his eyes, looked, and said: \"I see  her. There's a mountain two hundred miles off, and in the mountain a  rock, and in the rock a precious stone, and she's that precious stone.  If Long carries me thither, we shall obtain her.\"    Long took him at once on his shoulders, extended himself, and went  twenty miles at a step. Sharpsight fixed his flaming eyes on the  mountain, the mountain crumbled, and the rock in it split into a  thousand pieces, and amongst them glittered the precious stone. They  took it up and brought it to the prince, and when he let it fall on the  ground, the princess again stood there. When afterward the wizard came  and saw her there, his eyes flashed with spite, and bang! again an iron  hoop cracked upon him and flew off. He growled and led the princess out  of the room.    That day all was again as it had been the day before. After supper the  wizard brought the princess in again, looked the prince keenly in the  face, and scornfully uttered the words, \"It will be seen who's a match  for whom; whether you are victorious or I,\" and with that he departed.  This night they all exerted themselves still more to avoid going to  sleep. They wouldn't even sit down, they wanted to walk about all night  long, but all in vain; they were bewitched; one fell asleep after the  other as he walked and the princess vanished away from them.    In the morning the prince again awoke earliest, and, when he didn't see  the princess, woke Sharpsight. \"Hey! get up, Sharpsight! look where the  princess is!\" Sharpsight looked out for a long time. \"Oh, sir,\" says he,  \"she is a long way off, a long way off! Three hundred miles off is a  black sea, and in the midst of the sea a shell on the bottom, and in  the shell is a gold ring, and she's the ring. But never mind! we shall  obtain her, but to-day Long must take Broad with him as well; we shall  want him.\" Long took Sharpsight on one shoulder, and Broad on the other,  and went thirty miles at a step. When they came to the black sea,  Sharpsight showed him where he must reach into the water for the shell.  Long extended his hand as far as he could, but could not reach the  bottom.    \"Wait, comrades! wait only a little and I'll help you,\" said Broad, and  swelled himself out as far as his paunch would stretch; he then lay down  on the shore and drank. In a very short time the water fell so low that  Long easily reached the bottom and took the shell out of the sea. Out of  it he extracted the ring, took his comrades on his shoulders and  hastened back. But on the way he found it a little difficult to run with  Broad, who had half a sea of water inside him, so he cast him from his  shoulder on to the ground in a wide valley. Thump he went like a sack  let fall from a tower, and in a moment the whole valley was under water  like a vast lake. Broad himself barely crawled out of it.    Meanwhile the prince was in great trouble in the castle. The dawn began  to display itself over the mountains, and his servants had not returned;  the more brilliantly the rays ascended, the greater was his anxiety; a  deadly perspiration came out upon his forehead. Soon the sun showed  itself in the east like a thin slip of flame--and then with a loud crash  the door flew open, and on the threshold stood the wizard. He looked  round the room, and seeing the princess was not there, laughed a hateful  laugh and entered the room. But just at that moment, pop! the window  flew in pieces, the gold ring fell on the floor, and in an instant there  stood the princess again. Sharpsight, seeing what was going on in the  castle, and in what danger his master was, told Long. Long made a step,  and threw the ring through the window into the room. The wizard roared  with rage till the castle quaked, and then, bang! went the third iron  hoop that was round his waist, and sprang off him; the wizard turned  into a raven, and flew out and away through the shattered window.    Then, and not till then, did the beautiful damsel speak and thank the  prince for setting her free, and blushed like a rose. In the castle and  round the castle everything became alive again at once. He who was  holding in the hall the outstretched sword, swung it into the air, which  whistled again, and then returned it to its sheath; he who was stumbling  on the threshold, fell on the ground, but immediately got up again and  felt his nose to see whether it was still entire; he who was sitting  under the chimney put the piece of meat into his mouth and went on  eating; and thus everybody completed what he had begun doing, and at the  point where he had left off. In the stables the horses merrily stamped  and snorted, the trees round the castle became green like periwinkles,  the meadows were full of variegated flowers, high in the air warbled the  skylark, and abundance of small fishes appeared in the clear river.  Everywhere was life, everywhere enjoyment.    Meanwhile a number of gentlemen assembled in the room where the prince  was, and all thanked him for their liberation. But he said: \"You have  nothing to thank me for; if it had not been for my trusty servants Long,  Broad, and Sharpsight, I too, should have been what you were.\" He then  immediately started on his way home to the old king, his father, with  his bride and servants. On the way they met Broad and took him with  them.    The old king wept for joy at the success of his son; he had thought he  would return no more. Soon afterward there was a grand wedding, the  festivities of which lasted three weeks; all the gentlemen that the  prince had liberated were invited. After the wedding Long, Broad, and  Sharpsight announced to the young king that they were going again into  the world to look for work. The young king tried to persuade them to  stay with him. \"I will give you everything you want, as long as you  live,\" said he; \"you needn't work at all.\" But they didn't like such an  idle life, took leave of him, went away, and have been ever since  knocking about somewhere or other in the world.          XI    INTELLIGENCE AND LUCK      Once upon a time Luck met Intelligence on a garden-seat. \"Make room for  me!\" said Luck. Intelligence was then as yet inexperienced, and didn't  know who ought to make room for whom. He said: \"Why should I make room  for you? you're no better than I.\" \"He's the better man,\" answered Luck,  \"who performs most. See you there yon peasant's son who's ploughing in  the field? Enter into him, and if he gets on better through you than  through me, I'll always submissively make way for you, whensoever and  wheresoever we meet.\" Intelligence agreed, and entered at once into the  ploughboy's head. As soon as the ploughboy felt that he had intelligence  in his head, he began to think: \"Why must I follow the plough to the day  of my death? I can go somewhere else and make my fortune more easily.\"  He left off ploughing, put up the plough, and drove home. \"Daddy,\" says  he, \"I don't like this peasant's life; I'd rather learn to be a  gardener.\" His father said: \"What ails you, Vanek? have you lost your  wits?\" However, he bethought himself and said: \"Well, if you will,  learn, and God be with you! Your brother will be heir to the cottage  after me.\" Vanek lost the cottage, but he didn't care for that, but went  and put himself apprentice to the king's gardener. For every little that  the gardener showed him, Vanek comprehended ever so much more. Ere long  he didn't even obey the gardener's orders as to how he ought to do  anything, but did everything his own way. At first the gardener was  angry, but, seeing everything thus getting on better, he was content. \"I  see that you've more intelligence than I,\" said he, and henceforth let  Vanek garden as he thought fit. In no long space of time Vanek made the  garden so beautiful that the king took great delight in it, and  frequently walked in it with the queen and with his only daughter.    The princess was a very beautiful damsel, but ever since she was twelve  years old she had ceased speaking, and no one ever heard a single word  from her. The king was much grieved, and caused a proclamation to be  made that whoever should bring it to pass that she should speak again,  should be her husband. Many young kings, princes, and other great lords  announced themselves one after the other, but all went away as they had  come; no one succeeded in causing her to speak. \"Why shouldn't I try my  luck?\" thought Vanek; \"who knows whether I mayn't succeed in bringing  her to answer when I ask her a question?\" He at once caused himself to  be announced at the palace, and the"]]]
