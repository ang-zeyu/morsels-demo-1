[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18183"],[0,"Trees, Fruits and Flowers of Minnesota, 1916 (#11)"],[1," years ago we acquired some land three and one-half miles north  of Spring Valley. This land is very rough and was originally covered  with heavy timber, in fact, about one-third of our large orchard was  cleared and grubbed out the fall before planting.    When I became interested in fruit growing one of the first things I did  was to join the Horticultural Society and to the knowledge obtained  through this membership we owe in large measure what success has come to  us.    The eighteen acres selected for our main orchard slopes quite abruptly  to the north and northeast. In fact, the slope is so steep that the  ground, if kept under cultivation, would wash badly, and this was the  real reason for seeding down our orchard at the time of planting. The  orchard is now seven years old, and the trees have never had a particle  of cultivation. Part of this ground was in grain and seeded to alsike  and timothy the year before; the balance was the new land referred to,  which we had broken and immediately seeded down to alsike and timothy,  with oats as a nurse crop.    Our first problem was what varieties to plant, in what proportion and  where to buy them. In this we adopted the recommendation of this society  at that time, choosing Wealthy, Duchess, Patten Greening and  Northwestern Greening, with fifty Malinda and fifty Iowa Beauty. We now  have in addition two small orchards with nearly forty varieties  altogether. The varieties, for the large orchard were divided as  follows: 250 Duchess, 250 Patten Greening, 300 Northwestern Greening,  1,000 Wealthy. Were I to set another commercial orchard of the same size  it would contain 500 Duchess and the balance Wealthy. While the Patten  Greening is an ideal tree and an early and prolific bearer, there is  with us a much larger per cent of imperfect and diseased fruit than of  any other variety. Tree for tree, I believe the Duchess will produce  _more_ saleable _fruit_.    Where to buy our trees was decided for us in one of our first numbers of  the Horticulturist, viz., at the nearest reliable nursery. That this was  good advice is evidenced by the fact that out of the 1,900 trees we have  found but two that were not as ordered.    Our next problem was, at what distance to plant the trees. The more  information we sought the less sure were we of the best plan. We were  advised to plant all distances from 12 feet by 16 feet to 24 feet by 32  feet. We finally concluded to take about an average of them all and  decided on 20 feet by 20 feet, and so far have had no reason to regret  it. We have put up the alsike and timothy every year for hay with the  usual machinery, and there has not been over a half dozen trees  seriously damaged. Our trees were nearly all three years old, 5 to 6  feet, and we find they do much better in sod than a smaller tree.    Having the orchard set out the next thing was to protect the trees from  mice and rabbits. This we did by making protectors out of wire cloth,  using different widths, from 18 to 24 inches, cutting it in strips 10  inches wide and holding it about the trees by three pieces of stove pipe  wire at the top, middle and bottom. Not counting the time of making and  putting them on these cost us from 1-1/2 cents to 2-1/2 cents each, and  lasted from three to four years. We used a few made of galvanized wire  cloth, which lasted much longer.    Three years ago we commenced replacing these protectors with a wash of  white lead and raw linseed oil mixed to the consistency of separator  cream. The first year we painted only fifty trees, the next year 100,  the next 300, and this last year we painted every tree on the place. We  can see no bad effects, and it certainly protects against mice and  rabbits and, what is equally as important, against borers also, and the  cost per tree, including labor, is much less.    We have also used the lead and oil with splendid results in treating  trees affected with canker. We had quite a number of Wealthy so  affected, and we cut out the affected bark and wood and then covered the  wound with lead, and in almost every case it has proved a cure, that is,  stopped the spread of the canker.    The second year our orchard was set out we began to mulch the trees with  grass cut in the orchard, clover straw, pea straw--anything we could  get. We were unable to mulch the entire orchard that year, and before we  got the balance mulched you could tell as far as you could see the  orchard which trees were mulched and which were not. The former not only  made a better growth, but had a healthier look. Now I do not want you to  get the idea that I am advocating the sod system except in locations  similar to ours. Were our orchard on more level ground I not only should  have cultivated the first three years, as advocated by most authorities,  but would have continued the cultivation in some degree at least.    Nevertheless, on account probably of the very favorable location, I  think our orchard will compare favorably with any cultivated orchard of  the same age. Having the orchard set out, protected against mice and  rabbits and mulched, we found that the real work of raising an orchard  had just begun. First came the gray beetles the following June, and they  ate the new growth off several hundred trees before we discovered them.  At that time, not knowing what else to do, we hand picked every one we  could find and destroyed them. These beetles we found came from oak  groves on the south and west, and the next year we sprayed with arsenate  of lead six or eight rows of trees on that side of the orchard, and as  we have since then sprayed the entire orchard each year we have had no  further trouble.    Next came pocket gophers, and before we learned how to stop them we had  lost a number of trees by their chewing off the roots just beneath the  surface of the ground. By opening their runways and placing well down in  them a piece of carrot or potato in which has been placed a little  strychnine we succeeded in getting rid of them entirely. Next came the  woodchucks. They were very destructive with us, chewing the bark above  the protectors as well as the roots. Trapping is the most successful  method we have found, and by keeping a half dozen traps out all the time  we held them in check. Eternal vigilance must be the motto of the  successful orchardist.    In the year 1913 we picked our first crop of apples, that is, in  sufficient quantity to be considered in a commercial way. Our Duchess we  sold in barrels at $2.00 net. Wealthy we packed in bushel boxes, making  two sizes, the larger, three inches and over, we called No. 1, and they  sold for $1.25 per box net. The balance or smaller ones were also sold  in boxes and brought us $1.00 per box net. Patten Greenings brought us  80 cents and Northwestern Greenings, 90 cents per box. Our neighbors,  who sold to the local and transient buyers in bulk and in barrels,  received 75 cents to 90 cents per hundred pounds, or $2.00 per barrel.    The past year we had only about 75 bushels of all kinds. With the  exception of Duchess and possibly Patten's Greening we shall certainly  sell our next crop in bushel boxes.    We are top-working about 50 Patten's Greening to Jonathan, Delicious,  McIntosh Red and King David. As the work was only started a year ago  last spring I cannot tell you of its success or failure. So far the best  results seem to be with the Jonathan.    We also have about thirty varieties of plums, including many of Prof.  Hansen's new hybrids. Of these the Opata seems to be the most hardy and  prolific, but it is subject to brown rot, which, this past year was so  bad that we lost more than half the fruit. We have it top-worked on  several varieties of native plums, and it was similarly affected there  also. This was the only variety in our orchard of 150 trees that was so  affected. We have fifteen Surprise plums, set seven years, that have not  yielded altogether a peck of plums. Only lack of time kept me from  grubbing them out last spring. This past season they were so heavily  loaded that we had to prop the limbs and then thin out the fruit.    We endeavor to spray all our trees twice with commercial lime-sulphur  and arsenate of lead--the first time immediately after the blossoms  fall, the second two weeks later. Our spraying outfit consists of a  Morrill & Morley hand pump, fitted in a 100-gallon tank, which we  mounted on a small, one-horse truck. We operate it with three men, one  to drive and pump and one for each line of hose, spraying two rows of  trees at once. With this outfit we can spray 400 to 500 trees (of the  size of ours) a day.           *       *       *       *       *    THE NATIONAL FORESTS--besides being the American farmer's most  valuable source of wood, which is the chief building material for rural  purposes, are also his most valuable source of water, both for  irrigation and domestic use. In the West, they afford him a protected  grazing range for his stock; they are the best insurance against flood  damage to his fields, his buildings, his bridges, his roads, and the  fertility of his soil. The national forests cover the higher portions of  the Rocky Mountain ranges, the Cascades, the Pacific Coast ranges, and a  large part of the forested coast and islands of Alaska; some of the  hilly regions in Montana and in the Dakotas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, and  limited areas in Minnesota, Michigan, Florida, and Porto Rico. In  addition, land is now being purchased for national forests in the White  Mountains of New England and in the southern Appalachians. In regions so  widely scattered, agricultural and forest conditions necessarily differ  to a great degree, bringing about corresponding differences in the  effect of the national forests on the agricultural interests of the  various localities. Wherever agriculture can be practiced, however, the  farmer is directly benefited by the existence of national forests and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18184"],[0,"Animal Carvings from Mounds of the Mississippi Valley (#11)"],[1,"or wholly imaginative character to supplant or  supplement the imitative form only in obedience to external influences,  especially those of a religious or superstitious kind. In this  connection it is interesting to note that even among tribes of the  Northwest, the Haidahs, for instance, whose carvings or paintings of  birds and animals are almost invariably treated in a manner so highly  conventional or are so distorted and caricatured as to be nearly or  quite unrecognizable, it is still some natural object, as a well known  bird or animal, that underlies and gives primary shape to the design.  However highly conventionalized or grotesque in appearance such artistic  productions may be, evidences of an underlying imitative design may  always be detected; proof, seemingly, that the conventional is a later  stage of art superimposed upon the more natural by the requirements of  mythologic fancies.    As it is with any particular example of savage artistic fancy, so is it  with the art of certain tribes as a whole. Nor does it seem possible  that the growth of the religions or mythologic sentiment has so far  preceded or outgrown the development of art as to have had from the  first a dominating influence over it, and that the art of such tribes as  most strongly show its effect has never had what may be termed its  natural phase of development, but has reached the conventional stage  without having passed through the intermediate imitative era.    It is more natural to suppose, so far, at least as the North American  Indians are concerned, that the road to conventionalism has always led  through imitation.    The argument, therefore, that because a tribe or people is less given  than another to conventional methods of art, it therefore must  necessarily be in a higher stage of culture, is entitled to much less  weight than it has sometimes received. Squier and Davis, for instance,  referring to the Mound-Builders, state that \"many of these (_i.e._,  sculptures) exhibit a close observance of nature such as we could only  expect to find among a people considerably advanced in the minor arts,  and to which the elaborate and laborious, but usually clumsy and  ungraceful, not to say unmeaning, productions of the savage can claim  but a slight approach.\"    It is clearly not the intention of the above authors to claim an entire  absence of the grotesque method of treatment in specimens of the  Mound-Builder's art, since elsewhere they call attention to what appears  to be a caricature of the human face, as well as to the disproportionate  size of the heads of many of the animal carvings. Not only are the heads  of many of the carvings of disproportionate size, which, in instances  has the effect of actual distortion, but in not a few of the sculptures  nature, instead of being copied, has been trifled with and birds and  animals show peculiarities unknown to science and which go far to prove  that the Mound-Builders, however else endowed, possessed lively  imaginations and no little creative fancy.    Decided traces of conventionalism also are to be found in many of the  animal carvings, and the method of indicating the wings and feathers of  birds, the scales of the serpent, &c., are almost precisely what is to  be observed in modern Indian productions of a similar kind.    Few and faint as are these tendencies towards caricaturing and  conventionalizing as compared with what may be noted in the artistic  productions of the Haidahs, Chinooks, and other tribes of the Northwest,  they are yet sufficient to show that in these particulars no hard and  fast line can be drawn between the art of the Indian and of the  Mound-Builder.    As showing how narrow is the line that separates the conventional and  imitative methods of art, it is of interest to note that among the  Esquimaux the two stages of art are found flourishing side by side. In  their curious masks, carved into forms the most quaint and grotesque,  and in many of their carvings of animals, partaking as they do of a half  human, half animal character, we have abundant evidence of what authors  have characterized as savage taste in sculpture. But the same tribes  execute carvings of animals, as seals, sea-lions, whales, bears, &c.,  which, though generally wanting in the careful modeling necessary to  constitute fine sculpture, and for absolute specific resemblance, are  generally recognizable likenesses. Now and then indeed is to be found a  carving which is noteworthy for spirited execution and faithful  modeling. The best of them are far superior to the best executed  carvings from the mounds, and, are much worthier objects for comparison  with modern artistic work.    As deducible from the above premises it may be observed that, while the  state of art among primitive peoples as exemplified by their artistic  productions may be a useful index in determining their relative position  in the scale of progress, unless used with caution and in connection  with other and more reliable standards of measurement it will lead to  very erroneous conclusions. If, for instance, skill and ingenuity in the  art of carving and etching be accepted as affording a proper idea of a  people's progress in general culture, the Esquimaux of Alaska should be  placed in the front rank of American tribes, a position needless to say  which cannot be accorded them from more general considerations. On the  other hand, while the evidences of artistic skill left by the Iroquoian  tribes are in no way comparable to the work produced by the Esquimaux,  yet the former have usually been assigned a very advanced position as  compared with other American tribes.      GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.    The more important conclusions reached in the foregoing paper may be  briefly summed up as follows:    That of the carvings from the mounds which can be identified there are  no representations of birds or animals not indigenous to the Mississippi  Valley.    And consequently that the theories of origin for the Mound Builders  suggested by the presence in the mounds of carvings of supposed foreign  animals are without basis.    Second. That a large majority of the carvings, instead of being, as  assumed, exact likenesses from nature, possess in reality only the most  general resemblance to the birds and animals of the region which they  were doubtless intended to represent.    Third. That there is no reason for believing that the masks and  sculptures of human faces are more correct likenesses than are the  animal carvings.    Fourth. That the state of art-culture reached by the Mound Builders, as  illustrated by their carvings, has been greatly overestimated.          INDEX.
