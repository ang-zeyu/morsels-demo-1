Periods Fertile in Myth    What we should expect, then, to find from our philosophical study of  the Chinese mind as affected by its surroundings would be barrenness of  constructive imagination, except when birth was given to myth through  the operation of some external agency. And this we do find. The period  of the overthrow of the Yin dynasty and the establishment of the  great house of Chou in 1122 B.C., or of the Wars of the Three States,  for example, in the third century after Christ, a time of terrible  anarchy, a medieval age of epic heroism, sung in a hundred forms of  prose and verse, which has entered as motive into a dozen dramas,  or the advent of Buddhism, which opened up a new world of thought and  life to the simple, sober, peace-loving agricultural folk of China,  were stimuli not by any means devoid of result. In China there are gods  many and heroes many, and the very fact of the existence of so great  a multitude of gods would logically imply a wealth of mythological  lore inseparable from their apotheosis. You cannot--and the Chinese  cannot--get behind reason. A man is not made a god without some  cause being assigned for so important and far-reaching a step; and  in matters of this sort the stated cause is apt to take the form of  a narrative more or less marvellous or miraculous. These resulting  myths may, of course, be born and grow at a later time than that  in which the circumstances giving rise to them took place, but,  if so, that merely proves the persistent power of the originating  stimulus. That in China these narratives always or often reach the  highest flights of constructive imagination is not maintained--the  maintenance of that argument would indeed be contradictory; but even  in those countries where the mythological garden has produced some of  the finest flowers millions of seeds must have been sown which either  did not spring up at all or at least failed to bring forth fruit. And  in the realm of mythology it is not only those gods who sit in the  highest seats--creators of the world or heads of great religions--who  dominate mankind; the humbler, though often no less powerful gods  or spirits--those even who run on all fours and live in holes in the  ground, or buzz through the air and have their thrones in the shadow  of a leaf--have often made a deeper impress on the minds and in the  hearts of the people, and through that impress, for good or evil, have,  in greater or less degree, modified the life of the visible universe.      Sources of Chinese Myth    \"So, if we ask whence comes the heroic and the romantic, which supplies  the story-teller's stock-in-trade, the answer is easy. The legends and  history of early China furnish abundance of material for them. To the  Chinese mind their ancient world was crowded with heroes, fairies, and  devils, who played their part in the mixed-up drama, and left a name  and fame both remarkable and piquant. Every one who is familiar with  the ways and the language of the people knows that the country is full  of common objects to which poetic names have been given, and with many  of them there is associated a legend or a myth. A deep river's gorge is  called 'the Blind Man's Pass,' because a peculiar bit of rock, looked  at from a certain angle, assumes the outline of the human form, and  there comes to be connected therewith a pleasing story which reaches  its climax in the petrifaction of the hero. A mountain's crest shaped  like a swooping eagle will from some one have received the name of  'Eagle Mountain,' whilst by its side another shaped like a couchant  lion will have a name to match. There is no lack of poetry among the  people, and most striking objects claim a poetic name, and not a few  of them are associated with curious legends. It is, however, to their  national history that the story-teller goes for his most interesting  subjects, and as the so-called history of China imperceptibly passes  into the legendary period, and this again fades into the mythical,  and as all this is assuredly believed by the masses of the people,  it is obvious that in the national life of China there is no dearth  of heroes whose deeds of prowess will command the rapt attention of  the crowds who listen.\" [2]    The soul in China is everywhere in evidence, and if myths have \"first  and foremost to do with the life of the soul\" it would appear strange  that the Chinese, having spiritualized everything from a stone to the  sky, have not been creative of myth. Why they have not the foregoing  considerations show us clearly enough. We must take them and their  myths as we find them. Let us, then, note briefly the result of their  mental workings as reacted on by their environment.      Phases of Chinese Myth    We cannot identify the earliest mythology of the Chinese with that of  any primitive race. The myths, if any, of their place of origin may  have faded and been forgotten in their slow migration eastward. We  cannot say that when they came from the West (which they probably  did) they brought their myths with them, for in spite of certain  conjectural derivations from Babylon we do not find them possessed  of any which we can identify as imported by them at that time. But  research seems to have gone at least as far as this--namely, that  while we cannot say that Chinese myth was derived from Indian myth,  there is good reason to believe that Chinese and Indian myth had a  common origin, which was of course outside of China.    To set forth in detail the various phases through which Chinese myth  has passed would involve a technical description foreign to the purpose  of a popular work. It will sufficiently serve our present purpose to  outline its most prominent features.    In the earliest times there was an 'age of magic' followed by an  'heroic age,' but myths were very rare before 800 B.C., and what is  known as primitive mythology is said to have been invented or imitated  from foreign sources after 820 B.C. In the eighth century B.C. myths  of an astrological character began to attract attention. In the age  of Lao Tzu (604 B.C.), the reputed founder of the Taoist religion,  fresh legends appear, though Lao Tzu himself, absorbed in the abstract,  records none. Neither did Confucius (551-479 B.C.) nor Mencius, who  lived two hundred years later, add any legends to history. But in the  Period of the Warring States (500-100 B.C.) fresh stimuli and great  emotion prompted to mythological creation.      Tso-ch'iu Ming and Lieh Tzu    Tso-ch'iu Ming, commentator on Confucius's _Annals_, frequently  introduced legend into his history. Lieh Tzu (fifth and fourth  centuries B.C.), a metaphysician, is one of the earliest authors who  deal in myths. He is the first to mention the story of Hsi Wang Mu, the  Western Queen, and from his day onward the fabulists have vied with one  another in fantastic descriptions of the wonders of her fairyland. He  was the first to mention the islands of the immortals in the ocean,  the kingdoms of the dwarfs and giants, the fruit of immortality, the  repairing of the heavens by Nue Kua Shih with five-coloured stones,  and the great tortoise which supports the universe.      The T'ang and Sung Epochs    Religious romance began at this time. The T'ang epoch (A.B. 618-907)  was one of the resurrection of the arts of peace after a long period of  dissension. A purer and more enduring form of intellect was gradually  overcoming the grosser but less solid superstition. Nevertheless the  intellectual movement which now manifested itself was not strong  enough to prevail against the powers of mythological darkness. It  was reserved for the scholars of the Sung Period (A.D. 960-1280)  to carry through to victory a strong and sustained offensive against  the spiritualistic obsessions which had weighed upon the Chinese mind  more or less persistently from the Han Period (206 B.C.-A.D. 221)  onward. The dogma of materialism was specially cultivated at this  time. The struggle of sober reason against superstition or imaginative  invention was largely a struggle of Confucianism against Taoism. Though  many centuries had elapsed since the great Master walked the earth,  the anti-myth movement of the T'ang and Sung Periods was in reality the  long arm and heavy fist of Confucius emphasizing a truer rationalism  than that of his opponents and denouncing the danger of leaving the  firm earth to soar into the unknown hazy regions of fantasy. It was  Sung scholarship that gave the death-blow to Chinese mythology.    It is unnecessary to labour the point further, because after the Sung  epoch we do not meet with any period of new mythological creation,  and its absence can be ascribed to no other cause than its defeat at  the hands of the Sung philosophers. After their time the tender plant  was always in danger of being stunted or killed by the withering blast  of philosophical criticism. Anything in the nature of myth ascribable  to post-Sung times can at best be regarded only as a late blossom  born when summer days are past.      Myth and Doubt    It will bear repetition to say that unless the myth-builder firmly  believes in his myth, be he the layer of the foundation-stone or one  of the raisers of the superstructure, he will hardly make it a living  thing. Once he believes in reincarnation and the suspension of natural  laws, the boundless vistas of space and the limitless aeons of time are  opened to him. He can perform miracles which astound the world. But  if he allow his mind to inquire, for instance, why it should have been  necessary for Elijah to part the waters of the Jordan with his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15255"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 1 (#11)"],[1,". The  truth of this theory, as of all theories respecting ghosts and spirits,  seems to me a matter for experimental verification, but the Vedanta  recognizes that in our experience a personal individual existence is  always connected with a physical substratum.    The Buddhist theory of rebirth is somewhat different, for Buddhism even  in its later divagations rarely ceased to profess belief in Gotama's  doctrine that there is no such thing as a soul--by which is meant no such  thing as a permanent unchanging self or _atman_. Buddhists are concerned  to show that transmigration is not inconsistent with this denial of the  _atman_. The ordinary, and indeed inevitable translation of this word by  soul leads to misunderstanding for we naturally interpret it as meaning  that there is nothing which survives the death of the body and _a  fortiori_ nothing to transmigrate. But in reality the denial of the  _atman_ applies to the living rather than to the dead. It means that in  a living man there is no permanent, unchangeable entity but only a  series of mental states, and since human beings, although they have no  _atman_, certainly exist in this present life, the absence of the  _atman_ is not in itself an obstacle to belief in a similar life after  death or before birth. Infancy, youth, age and the state immediately  after death may form a series of which the last two are as intimately  connected as any other two. The Buddhist teaching is that when men die  in whom the desire for another life exists--as it exists in all except  saints--then desire, which is really the creator of the world, fashions  another being, conditioned by the character and merits of the being  which has just come to an end. Life is like fire: its very nature is to  burn its fuel. When one body dies, it is as if one piece of fuel were  burnt: the vital process passes on and recommences in another and so  long as there is desire of life, the provision of fuel fails not.  Buddhist doctors have busied themselves with the question whether two  successive lives are the same man or different men, and have illustrated  the relationship by various analogies of things which seem to be the  same and yet not the same, such as a child and an adult, milk and curds,  or fire which spreads from a lamp and burns down a village, but, like  the Brahmans, they do not discuss why the hypothesis of transmigration  is necessary. They had the same feeling for the continuity of nature,  and more than others they insisted on the principle that everything has  a cause. They held that the sexual act creates the conditions in which a  new life appears but is not an adequate cause for the new life itself.  And unless we accept a materialist explanation of human nature, this  argument is sound: unless we admit that mind is merely a function of  matter, the birth of a mind is not explicable as a mere process of cell  development: something pre-existent must act upon the cells.    Europeans in discussing such questions as the nature of the soul and  immortality are prone to concentrate their attention on death and  neglect the phenomena of birth, which surely are equally important. For  if a soul survives the death of this complex of cells which is called  the body, its origin and development must, according to all analogy, be  different from those of the perishable body. Orthodox theology deals  with the problem by saying that God creates a new soul every time a  child is born[35] but free discussion usually ignores it and taking an  adult as he is, asks what are the chances that any part of him survives  death. Yet the questions, what is destroyed at death and how and why,  are closely connected with the questions what comes into existence at  birth and how and why. This second series of questions is hard enough,  but it has this advantage over the first that whereas death abruptly  closes the road and we cannot follow the soul one inch on its journey  beyond, the portals of birth are a less absolute frontier. We know that  every child has passed through stages in which it could hardly be called  a child. The earliest phase consists of two cells, which unite and then  proceed to subdivide and grow. The mystery of the process by which they  assume a human form is not explained by scientific or theological  phrases. The complete individual is assuredly not contained in the first  germ. The microscope cannot find it there and to say that it is there  potentially, merely means that we know the germ will develop in a  certain way. To say that a force is manifesting itself in the germ and  assuming the shape which it chooses to take or must take is also merely  a phrase and metaphor, but it seems to me to fit the facts[36].    The doctrines of pre-existence and transmigration (but not, I think, of  karma which is purely Indian) are common among savages in Africa and  America, nor is their wide distribution strange. Savages commonly think  that the soul wanders during sleep and that a dead man's soul goes  somewhere: what more natural than to suppose that the soul of a new born  infant comes from somewhere? But among civilized peoples such ideas are  in most cases due to Indian influence. In India they seem indigenous to  the soil and not imported by the Aryan invaders, for they are not  clearly enunciated in the Rig Veda, nor formulated before the time of  the Upanishads[37]. They were introduced by Buddhism to the Far East and  their presence in Manichaeism, Neoplatonism, Sufiism and ultimately in  the Jewish Kabbala seems a rivulet from the same source. Recent research  discredits the theory that metempsychosis was an important feature in  the earlier religion of Egypt or among the Druids[38]. But it played a  prominent part in the philosophy of Pythagoras and in the Orphic  mysteries, which had some connection with Thrace and possibly also with  Crete. A few great European intellects[39]--notably Plato and  Virgil--have given it undying expression, but Europeans as a whole have  rejected it with that curiously crude contempt which they have shown  until recently for Oriental art and literature.    Considering how fixed is the belief in immortality among Europeans, or  at least the desire for it, the rarity of a belief in pre-existence or  transmigration is remarkable. But most people's expectation of a future  life is based on craving rather than on reasoned anticipation. I cannot  myself understand how anything that comes into being can be immortal.  Such immortality is unsupported by a single analogy nor can any instance  be quoted of a thing which is known to have had an origin and yet is  even apparently indestructible[40]. And is it possible to suppose that  the universe is capable of indefinite increase by the continual addition  of new and eternal souls? But these difficulties do not exist for  theories which regard the soul as something existing before as well as  after the body, truly immortal _a parte ante_ as well as _a parte post_  and manifesting itself in temporary homes of human or lower shape. Such  theories become very various and fall into many obscurities when they  try to define the nature of the soul and its relation to the body, but  they avoid what seems to me the contradiction of the created but  immortal soul.    The doctrine of metempsychosis is also interesting as affecting the  relations of men and animals. The popular European conception of \"the  beasts which perish\" weakens the arguments for human immortality. For if  the mind of a dog or chimpanzee contains no element which is immortal,  the part of the human mind on which the claim to immortality can be  based must be parlously small, since _ex hypothesi_ sensation, volition,  desire and the simpler forms of intelligence are not immortal. But in  India where men have more charity and more philosophy this distinction  is not drawn. The animating principle of men, animals and plants is  regarded as one or at least similar, and even matter which we consider  inanimate, such as water, is often considered to possess a soul. But  though there is ample warrant in both Brahmanic and Buddhist literature  for the idea that the soul may sink from a human to an animal form or  _vice versa_ rise, and though one sometimes meets this belief in modern  life[41], yet it is not the most prominent aspect of metempsychosis in  India and the beautiful precept of ahimsa or not injuring living things  is not, as Europeans imagine, founded on the fear of eating one's  grandparents but rather on the humane and enlightened feeling that all  life is one and that men who devour beasts are not much above the level  of the beasts who devour one another. The feeling has grown stronger  with time. In the Vedas animal sacrifices are prescribed and they are  even now used in the worship of some deities. In the Epics the eating of  meat is mentioned. But the doctrine that it is wrong to take animal life  was definitely adopted by Buddhism and gained strength with its  diffusion.    One obvious objection to all theories of rebirth is that we do not  remember our previous existences and that, if they are connected by no  thread of memory, they are for all practical purposes the existences of  different people. But this want of memory affects not only past  existences but the early phases of this existence. Does any one deny his  existence as an infant or embryo because he cannot remember it[42]? And  if a wrong could be done to an infant the effects of which would not be  felt for twenty years, could it be said to be no concern of the infant  because the person who will suffer in twenty years time will have no  recollection that he was that infant? And common opinion in Eastern  Asia, not without occasional confirmation from Europe, denies the  proposition that we cannot remember our former lives and asserts that  those who take any pains to sharpen their spiritual faculties can  remember them.
