[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15673"],[0,"The Day of the Beast (#11)"],[1,"these circumstances, stir Lane's heart.  He was fascinated, puzzled, intensely curious.    \"Why wouldn't you dance jazz in front of me?\" he inquired, with a  smile.    \"Well, for one thing I'm not stuck on it, and for another I'll say you  said a mouthful.\"    \"Is that all?\" he asked, as if disappointed.    \"No. I'd respect what you said--because of where you've been and what  you've done.\"    It was a reply that surprised Lane.    \"I'm out of date, you know.\"    She put a finger on the medal on his breast and said: \"You could never  be out of date.\"    The music and the sliding shuffle ceased.    \"Now beat it,\" said Helen. \"I want to talk to Daren.\" She gayly shoved  the young people ahead of her in a mass, and called to Bessy: \"Here,  you kid vamp, lay off Daren.\"    Bessy leaned to whisper in his ear: \"Make a date with me, quick!\"    \"Surely, I'll hunt you up. Good-bye.\"    She was the only one who made any pretension of saying good-bye to  Lane. They all crowded out before Helen, with Mackay in the rear. From  the hall Lane heard him say to Helen: \"Dick'll sure go to the mat with  you for this.\"    Presently Helen returned to shut the door behind her; and her walk  toward Lane had a suggestion of the oriental dancer. For Lane her face  was a study. This seemed a woman beyond his comprehension. She was the  Helen Wrapp he had known and loved, plus an age of change, a  measureless experience. With that swaying, sinuous, pantherish grace,  with her green eyes narrowed and gleaming, half mocking, half serious,  she glided up to him, close, closer until she pressed against him, and  her face was uplifted under his. Then she waited with her eyes gazing  into his. Slumberous green depths, slowly lighting, they seemed to  Lane. Her presence thus, her brazen challenge, affected him  powerfully, but he had no thrill.    \"Aren't you going to kiss me?\" she asked.    \"Helen, why didn't you write me you had broken our engagement?\" he  counter-queried.    The question disconcerted her somewhat. Drawing back from close  contact with him she took hold of his sleeves, and assumed a naive air  of groping in memory. She used her eyes in a way that Lane could not  associate with the past he knew. She was a flirt--not above trying her  arts on the man she had jilted.    \"Why, didn't I write you? Of course I did.\"    \"Well, if you did I never got the letter. And if you were on the level  you'd admit you never wrote.\"    \"How'd you find out then?\" she inquired curiously.    \"I never knew for sure until your mother verified it.\"    \"Are you curious to know why I did break it off?\"    \"Not in the least.\"    This reply shot the fire into her face, yet she still persisted in the  expression of her sentimental motive. She began to finger the medal on  his breast.    \"So, Mr. Soldier Hero, you didn't care?\"    \"No--not after I had been here ten minutes,\" he replied, bluntly.    She whirled from him, swiftly, her body instinct with passion, her  expression one of surprise and fury.    \"What do you mean by that?\"    \"Nothing I care to explain, except I discovered my love for you was  dead--perhaps had been dead for a long time.\"    \"But you never discovered it until you _saw_ me--here--with  Swann--dancing, drinking, smoking?\"    \"No. To be honest, the shock of that enlightened me.\"    \"Daren Lane, I'm just what _you_ men have made me,\" she burst out,  passionately.    \"You are mistaken. I beg to be excluded from any complicity in the--in  whatever you've been made,\" he said, bitterly. \"I have been true to  you in deed and in thought all this time.\"    \"You must be a queer soldier!\" she exclaimed, incredulously.    \"I figure there were a couple of million soldiers like me, queer or  not,\" he retorted.    She gazed at him with something akin to hate in her eyes. Then  putting her hands to her full hips she began that swaying, dancing  walk to and fro before the window. She was deeply hurt. Lane had meant  to get under her skin with a few just words of scorn, and he had  imagined his insinuation as to the change in her had hurt her  feelings. Suddenly he divined it was not that at all--he had only  wounded her vanity.    \"Helen, let's not talk of the past,\" he said. \"It's over. Even if you  had been true to me, and I loved you still--I would have been  compelled to break our engagement.\"    \"You would! And why?\"    \"I am a physical wreck--and a mental one, too, I fear.... Helen, I've  come home to die.\"    \"Daren!\" she cried, poignantly.    Then he told her in brief, brutal words of the wounds and ravages war  had dealt him, and what Doctor Bronson's verdict had been. Lane felt  shame in being so little as to want to shock and hurt her, if that  were possible.    \"Oh, I'm sorry,\" she burst out. \"Your mother--your sister.... Oh, that  damned horrible war! _What_ has it not done to us?... Daren, you  looked white and weak, but I never thought you were--going to die....  How dreadful!\"    Something of her girlishness returned to her in this moment of  sincerity. The past was not wholly dead. Memories lingered. She looked  at Lane, wide-eyed, in distress, caught between strange long-forgotten  emotions.    \"Helen, it's not dreadful to have to die,\" replied Lane. \"_That_ is  not the dreadful part in coming home.\"    \"What _is_ dreadful, then?\" she asked, very low.    Lane felt a great heave of his breast--the irrepressible reaction of a  profound and terrible emotion, always held in abeyance until now. And  a fierce pang, that was physical as well as emotional, tore through  him. His throat constricted and ached to a familiar sensation--the  welling up of blood from his lungs. The handkerchief he put to his  lips came away stained red. Helen saw it, and with dilated eyes, moved  instinctively as if to touch him, hold him in her pity.    \"Never mind, Helen,\" he said, huskily. \"That's nothing.... Well, I was  about to tell you what is so dreadful--for me.... It's to reach home  grateful to God I was spared to get home--resigned to the ruin of my  life--content to die for whom I fought--my mother, my sister, _you_,  and all our women (for I fought for nothing else)--and find my mother  aged and bewildered and sad, my sister a painted little hussy--and  _you_--a strange creature I despise.... And all, everybody, everything  changed--changed in some horrible way which proves my sacrifice in  vain.... It is not death that is dreadful, but the uselessness, the  hopelessness of the ideal I cherished.\"    Helen fell on the couch, and burying her face in the pillows she began  to sob. Lane looked down at her, at her glistening auburn hair, and  slender, white, ringed hand clutching the cushions, at her lissom  shaking form, at the shapely legs in the rolled-down silk  stockings--and he felt a melancholy happiness in the proof that he had  reached her shallow heart, and in the fact that this was the moment of  loss.    \"Good-bye--Helen,\" he said.    \"Daren--don't--go,\" she begged.    But he had to go, for other reasons beside the one that this was the  end of all intimate relation between him and Helen. He had overtaxed  his strength, and the burning pang in his breast was one he must heed.  On the hall stairway a dizzy spell came over him. He held on to the  banister until the weakness passed. Fortunately there was no one to  observe him. Somehow the sumptuous spacious hall seemed drearily  empty. Was this a home for that twenty-year-old girl upstairs? Lane  opened the door and went out. He was relieved to find the taxi  waiting. To the driver he gave the address of his home and said: \"Go  slow and don't give me a jar!\"    But Lane reached home, and got into the house, where he sat at the  table with his mother and Lorna, making a pretense of eating, and went  upstairs and into his bed without any recurrence of the symptoms that  had alarmed him. In the darkness of his room he gradually relaxed to  rest. And rest was the only medicine for him. It had put off hour by  hour and day by day the inevitable.    \"If it comes--all right--I'm ready,\" he whispered to himself. \"But in  spite of all I've been through--and have come home to--I don't _want_  to die.\"    There was no use in trying to sleep. But in this hour he did not want  oblivion. He wanted endless time to think. And slowly, with infinite  care and infallible memory, he went over every detail of what he had  seen and heard since his arrival home. In the headlong stream of  consciousness of the past hours he met with circumstances that he  lingered over, and tried to understand, to no avail. Yet when all lay  clearly before his mental gaze he felt a sad and tremendous  fascination in the spectacle.    For many weeks he had lived on the fancy of getting home, of being  honored and loved, of being given some little meed of praise and  gratitude in the short while he had to live. Alas! this fancy had been  a dream of his egotism. His old world was gone. There was nothing  left. The day of the soldier had passed--until some future need of him  stirred the emotions of a selfish people. This new world moved on  unmindful, through its travail and incalculable change, to unknown  ends. He, Daren Lane, had been left alone on the vast and naked shores  of Lethe.    Lane made not one passionate protest at the injustice of his fate.  Labor, agony, war had taught him wisdom and vision. He began to  realize that no greater change could there be than this of his mind,  his soul. But in the darkness there an irresistible grief assailed  him. He wept as never before in all his life. And he tasted the bitter  salt of his own tears. He wept for his mother, aged and bowed by  trouble, bewildered, ready to give up the struggle--his little sister  now forced into erotic girlhood, blind, wilful, bold, on the wrong  path, doomed beyond his power or any earthly power--the men he had  met, warped by the war, materialistic, lost in the maze of  self-preservation and self-aggrandizement, dead to chivalry and the  honor"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15675"],[0,"A Voyage to New Holland, Etc. in the Year 1699 (#11)"],[1,"  but none of the cotton is exported, nor do they make much cloth of it.    THE BRAZILIAN FRUITS, ORANGES, ETC.    This country produces great variety of fine fruits, as very good oranges  of 3 or 4 sorts (especially one sort of china oranges) limes in  abundance, pomegranates, pomecitrons, plantains, bananas, right coconuts,  guavas, coco-plums (called here munsheroos) wild grapes, such as I have  described, beside such grapes as grow in Europe. Here are also hog-plums,  custard-apples, soursops, cashews, papaws (called here mamoons) jennipahs  (called here jennipapahs) manchineel-apples and mangoes. Mangoes are yet  but rare here: I saw none of them but in the Jesuits' garden, which has a  great many fine fruits, and some cinnamon-trees. These, both of them,  were first brought from the East Indies, and they thrive here very well:  so do pumplemouses, brought also from thence; and both china and seville  oranges are here very plentiful as well as good.    OF THE SOURSOPS, CASHEWS AND JENNIPAHS.    The soursop (as we call it) is a large fruit as big as a man's head, of a  long or oval shape, and of a green colour; but one side is yellowish when  ripe. The outside rind or coat is pretty thick, and very rough, with  small sharp knobs; the inside is full of spongy pulp, within which also  are many black seeds or kernels, in shape and bigness like a  pumpkin-seed. The pulp is very juicy, of a pleasant taste, and wholesome.  You suck the juice out of the pulp, and so spit it out. The tree or shrub  that bears this fruit grows about 10 or 12 foot high, with a small short  body; the branches growing pretty straight up; for I did never see any of  them spread abroad. The twigs are slender and tough; and so is the stem  of the fruit. This fruit grows also both in the East and West Indies.    The cashew is a fruit as big as a pippin, pretty long, and bigger near  the stem than at the other end, growing tapering. The rind is smooth and  thin, of a red and yellow colour. The seed of this fruit grows at the end  of it; it is of an olive colour shaped like a bean, and about the same  bigness, but not altogether so flat. The tree is as big as an apple-tree,  with branches not thick, yet spreading off. The boughs are gross, the  leaves broad and round, and in substance pretty thick. This fruit is soft  and spongy when ripe, and so full of juice that in biting it the juice  will run out on both sides of one's mouth. It is very pleasant, and  gratefully rough on the tongue; and is accounted a very wholesome fruit.  This grows both in the East and West Indies, where I have seen and eaten  of it.    The jennipah or jennipapah is a sort of fruit of the calabash or gourd  kind. It is about the bigness of a duck-egg, and somewhat of an oval  shape; and is of a grey colour. The shell is not altogether so thick nor  hard as a calabash: it is full of whitish pulp mixed with small flat  seeds; and both pulp and seeds must be taken into the mouth, where  sucking out the pulp you spit out seeds. It is of a sharp and pleasing  taste, and is very innocent. The tree that bears it is much like an ash,  straight-bodied, and of a good height; clean from limbs till near the  top, where there branches forth a small head. The rind is of a pale grey,  and so is the fruit. We used of this tree to make helves or handles for  axes (for which it is very proper) in the Bay of Campeachy; where I have  seen of them, and nowhere else but here.    OF THEIR PECULIAR FRUITS, ARISAHS, MERICASAHS, PETANGOS, PETUMBOS,  MUNGAROOS, MUCKISHAWS, INGWAS, OTEES, AND MUSTERAN DE OVAS.    Besides these here are many sorts of fruits which I have not met with  anywhere but here; as arisahs, mericasahs, petangos, etc. Arisahs are an  excellent fruit, not much bigger than a large cherry; shaped like a  catherine-pear, being small at the stem, and swelling bigger towards the  end. They are of a greenish colour, and have small seeds as big as  mustard seeds; they are somewhat tart, yet pleasant, and very wholesome,  and may be eaten by sick people.    Mericasahs are an excellent fruit, of which there are 2 sorts; one  growing on a small tree or shrub, which is counted the best; the other  growing on a kind of shrub like a vine, which they plant about arbors to  make a shade, having many broad leaves. The fruit is as big as a small  orange, round and green. When they are ripe they are soft and fit to eat;  full of white pulp mixed thick with little black seeds, and there is no  separating one from the other till they are in your mouth; when you suck  in the white pulp and spit out the stones. They are tart, pleasant, and  very wholesome.    Petangos are a small red fruit that grow also on small trees and are as  big as cherries, but not so globular, having one flat side, and also 5 or  6 small protuberant ridges. It is a very pleasant tart fruit, and has a  pretty large flattish stone in the middle.    Petumbos are a yellow fruit (growing on a shrub like a vine) bigger than  cherries with a pretty large stone. These are sweet, but rough in the  mouth.    Mungaroos are a fruit as big as cherries, red on one side and white on  the other side: they are said to be full of small seeds, which are  commonly swallowed in eating them.    Muckishaws are said to be a fruit as big as crab-apples, growing on large  trees. They have also small seeds in the middle and are well tasted.    Ingwas are a fruit like the locust-fruit, 4 inches long and one broad.  They grow on high trees.    Otee is a fruit as big as a large coconut. It hath a husk on the outside,  and a large stone within, and is accounted a very fine fruit.    Musteran-de-ovas are a round fruit as big as large hazelnuts, covered  with thin brittle shells of a blackish colour: they have a small stone in  the middle, enclosed within a black pulpy substance, which is of a  pleasant taste. The outside shell is chewed with the fruit, and spit out  with the stone, when the pulp is sucked from them. The tree that bears  this fruit is tall, large, and very hard wood. I have not seen any of  these five last-named fruits, but had them thus described to me by an  Irish inhabitant of Bahia; though as to this last I am apt to believe I  may have both seen and eaten of them in Achin in Sumatra.    OF THE PALMBERRIES, PHYSICK-NUTS, MENDIBEES, ETC. AND THEIR ROOTS AND  HERBS, ETC.    Palm-berries (called here dendees) grow plentifully about Bahia; the  largest are as big as walnuts; they grow in bunches on the top of the  body of the tree, among the roots of the branches or leaves, as all  fruits of the palm kind do. These are the same kind of berries or nuts as  those they make the palm-oil with on the coast of guinea, where they  abound: and I was told that they make oil with them here also. They  sometimes roast and eat them; but when I had one roasted to prove it I  did not like it.    Physick-nuts, as our seamen called them, are called here pineon; and  agnus castus is called here carrepat: these both grow here: so do  mendibees, a fruit like physick-nuts. They scorch them in a pan over the  fire before they eat them.    Here are also great plenty of cabbage-trees, and other fruits, which I  did not get information about and which I had not the opportunity of  seeing; because this was not the season, it being our spring, and  consequently their autumn, when their best fruits were gone, though some  were left. However I saw abundance of wild berries in the woods and  fields, but I could not learn their names or nature.    They have withal good plenty of ground fruit, as callavances, pineapples,  pumpkins, watermelons, musk-melons, cucumbers, and roots; as yams,  potatoes, cassava, etc. Garden herbs also good store; as cabbages,  turnips, onions, leeks, and abundance of other salading, and for the pot.  Drugs of several sorts, namely sassafras, snake-root, etc. Beside the  woods I mentioned for dyeing and other uses as fustick, speckled-wood,  etc.    I brought home with me from hence a good number of plants, dried between  the leaves of books; of some of the choicest of which that are not  spoiled I may give a specimen at the end of the book.    OF THEIR WILDFOWL, MACAWS, PARROTS, ETC.    Here are said to be great plenty and variety of wildfowl, namely yemmas,  macaws (which are called here jackoos, and are a larger sort of parrot,  and scarcer) parrots, parakeets, flamingos, carrion-crows,  chattering-crows, cockrecoes, bill-birds finely painted, corresoes,  doves, pigeons, jenetees, clocking-hens, crab-catchers, galdens,  currecoos, muscovy ducks, common ducks, widgeons, teal, curlews,  men-of-war birds, boobies, noddies, pelicans, etc.    THE YEMMA, CARRION-CROW AND CHATTERING-CROW, BILL-BIRD, CURRESO,  TURTLEDOVE AND WILD PIGEONS; THE JENETEE,    The yemma is bigger than a swan, grey-feathered, with a long thick  sharp-pointed bill.    The carrion-crow and chattering-crows are called here mackeraws, and are  like those I described in the West Indies. The bill of the  chattering-crow is black, and the upper bill is round, bending downwards  like a hawk's bill, rising up in a ridge almost semi-circular, and very  sharp, both at the ridge or convexity, and at the point or extremity: the  lower bill is flat and shuts even with it. I was told by a Portuguese  here that their negro wenches make love potions with these birds. And the  Portuguese care not to let them have any of these birds, to keep them  from that superstition: as I found one afternoon when I was in the fields  with a padre and another, who shot two of them, and hid them, as they  said, for that reason. They are not good food, but their bills are  reckoned a good antidote against poison.    The bill-birds are so called by the English from their monstrous bills,  which are as big as their bodies. I saw none of these birds here, but saw  several of the breasts flayed off and dried for the beauty of them; the  feathers were curiously coloured with red, yellow, and orange-colour"]]]
