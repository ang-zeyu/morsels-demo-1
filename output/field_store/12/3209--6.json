It seems probable, if we may judge  from our limited knowledge, that in the human child, activities are for  the most part dependent upon the age of the child, and upon the state of  development of the nervous system and of the organs of the body.    =Significance of Inherited Tendencies.= Although human nature is very  complex, although human action nearly always has some element of habit  in it, nevertheless, inborn tendencies are throughout life powerful  factors in determining action. This will at once be apparent if we  consider how greatly we are influenced by anger, jealousy, love, fear,  and competition. Now we do not have to learn to be jealous, to hate, to  love, to be envious, to fight, or to fear. These are emotions common to  all members of the human race, and their expression is an inborn  tendency. Throughout life no other influences are so powerful in  determining our action as are these. So, although most of our detailed  actions in life are habits which we learn or acquire, the fundamental  influences which decide the course of our action are inherited  tendencies.    =Classification of Instincts.= For convenience in treatment the instincts  are grouped in classes. Those instincts most closely related to  individual survival are called _individualistic_ instincts. Those more  closely related to the survival of the group are called _socialistic_.  Those individualistic tendencies growing out of periodic changes of the  environment may be called _environmental_ instincts. Those closely  related to human infancy, adapting and adjusting the child to the world  in which he lives, may be called _adaptive_. There is still another  group of inherited tendencies connected with sex and reproduction, which  are not discussed in this book.    We shall give a brief discussion of the instincts falling under these  various classes. It must be remembered, however, that the psychology of  the instincts is indefinite and obscure. It is difficult to bring the  instincts into the laboratory for accurate study. For our knowledge of  the instincts we are dependent, for the most part, on general  observation. We have had a few careful studies of the very earliest  years of childhood. However, although from the theoretical point of view  our knowledge of the instincts is incomplete, it is sufficient to be of  considerable practical value.    =The Individualistic Instincts.= Man's civilized life has covered but a  short period of time, only a few hundred or a few thousand years. His  pre-civilized life doubtless covered a period of millions of years. The  inborn tendencies in us are such as were developed in the long period of  savage life. During all of man's life in the time before civilization,  he was always in danger. He had many enemies, and most of these enemies  had the advantage of him in strength and natural means of defense.  Unaided by weapons, he could hardly hold his own against any of the  beasts of prey. So there were developed in man by the process of natural  selection many inherited responses which we group under the head of  _fear_ responses.    Just what the various situations are that bring forth these responses  has never been carefully worked out. But any situation that suddenly  puts an individual in danger of losing his life brings about  characteristic reactions. The most characteristic of the responses are  shown in connection with circulation and respiration. Both of these  processes are much interfered with. Sometimes the action is accelerated,  at other times it is retarded, and in some cases the respiratory and  circulatory organs are almost paralyzed. Also the small muscles of the  skin are made to contract, producing the sensation of the hair standing  on end. Just what the original use of all these responses was it is  difficult now to work out, but doubtless each served some useful  purpose.    Whether any particular situations now call forth inherited fear  responses in us is not definitely established. But among lower animals  there are certain definite and particular situations which do call forth  fear responses. On the whole, the evidence rather favors the idea of  definite fear situations among children. It seems that certain  situations do invariably arouse fear responses. To be alone in the dark,  to be in a strange place, to hear loud and sudden noises, to see large,  strange animals coming in threatening manner, seem universally to call  forth fear responses in children.    However, the whole situation must always be considered. A situation in  which the father or mother is present is quite different from one in  which they are both absent. But it is certain that these and other fears  are closely related to the age and development of the child. In the  earlier years of infancy, certain fears are not present that are present  later. And it can be demonstrated that the fears that do arise as  infancy passes on are natural and inherited and not the result of  experience.    Few of the original causes of fear now exist. The original danger was  from wild animals chiefly. Seldom are we now in such danger. But of  course this has been the case for only a short time. Our bodies are the  same sort of bodies that our ancestors had, therefore we are full of  needless fears. During the early years of a child's life, wise treatment  causes most of the fear tendencies to disappear because of disuse. On  the other hand, unwise treatment may accentuate and perpetuate them,  causing much misery and unhappiness. Neither the home nor the school  should play upon these ancestral fears. We should not try to get a child  to be good by frightening him; nor should we often use fear of pain as  an incentive to get a child to do his work.    Man has always been afraid, but he has also always been a fighter. He  has always had to fight for his life against the lower animals, and he  has also fought his fellow man. The fighting response is connected with  the emotions of anger, envy, and jealousy. A man is angered by anything  that interferes with his life, with his purposes, with whatever he calls  his own. We become angry if some one strikes our bodies, or attacks our  beliefs, or the beliefs of our dear friends, particularly of our  families. The typical responses connected with anger are such as faster  heart-beat, irregular breathing, congestion of the blood in the face and  head, tightening of the voluntary muscles, particularly a setting of the  teeth and a clinching of the fists. These responses are preparatory to  actual combat.    Anger, envy, and jealousy, and the responses growing out of them, have  always played a large part in the life of man. A great part of history  is a record of the fights of nations, tribes, and individuals. If the  records of wars and strifes, and the acts growing out of envy and  jealousy and other similar emotions should be taken out of history,  there would not be much left. Much of literature and art depict those  actions of man which grew out of these individualistic aspects of his  nature. Competition, which is an aspect of fighting, even to the present  day, continues to be one of the main factors in business and in life  generally. Briefly, fighting responses growing out of man's selfishness  are as old as man himself, and the inherited tendencies connected with  them are among the strongest of our natures.    In the training of children, one of the most difficult tasks is to help  them to get control over the fighting instinct and other selfish  tendencies. These tendencies are so deeply rooted in our natures that it  is hard to get control of them. In fact, the control which we do get  over them is always relative. The best we can hope to do is to get  control over our fighting tendencies in ordinary circumstances.    It is doubtful whether it would be good for us if the fighting spirit  should disappear from the race. It puts vim and determination into the  life of man. But our fighting should not be directed against our fellow  man. The fighting spirit can be retained and directed against evil and  other obstacles. We can learn to attack our tasks in a fighting spirit.  But surely the time has come when we should cease fighting against our  neighbors.    =Social Tendencies.= Over against our fighting tendencies we may set the  socialistic tendencies. Cooeperative and sympathetic actions grow out of  original nature, just as truly as do the selfish acts. But the  socialistic tendencies are not, in general, as strong as are the  individualistic ones. What society needs is the strengthening of the  socialistic tendencies by use, and a weakening of at least some of the  individualistic tendencies, by control and disuse.    Socialistic tendencies show themselves in gangs and clubs formed by  children and adults. It is, therefore, a common practice now to speak of  the \"gang\" instinct. Human beings are pleased and content when with  other human beings and not content, not satisfied, when alone. Of course  circumstances make a difference in the desires of men, but the general  original tendency is as stated.    The gang of the modern city has the following explanation: Boys like to  be with other boys. Moreover, they like to be active; they want to be  doing something. The city does not provide proper means for the desired  activities, such as hunting, fishing, tramping, and boating. It does not  provide experiences with animals, such as boys have on the farm. Much of  the boy's day is spent in school in a kind of work not at all like what  he would do by choice. There is not much home life. Usually there is not  the proper parental control. Seldom do the parents interest themselves  in planning for the activities of their children. The result is that the  boys come together"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18485"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#11)"],[1,"little brown jug was passed 'round.

I had done been wukin' out Mrs. Steve  Upson's flowers and when she 'come to pay, she axed what my name was.  When I told her it was Neal Upson she wanted to know how I got de Upson  name. I told her Mr. Frank Upson had done give it to me when I was his  slave.

I done been  married two times, but it was de fust time dat was de sho 'nough 'citin'  one. I courted dat gal for a long, long time while I was too skeered to  ax her Daddy for her. I went to see her evvy Sunday jus' 'termined to ax  him for her 'fore I left, and I would stay late atter supper, but jus'  couldn't git up nerve enough to do it. One Sunday I promised myself I  would ax him if it kilt me, so I went over to his house early dat  mornin' and told Lida, dat was my sweetheart's name--I says to her: 'I  sho is gwine to ax him today.' Well, dinnertime come, suppertime come,  and I was gittin' shaky in my jints when her Daddy went to feed his hogs  and I went along wid him. Missy, dis is de way I finally did ax him for  his gal. He said he was goin' to have some fine meat come winter. I axed  him if it would be enough for all of his fambly, and he said: 'How come  you ax dat, boy?' Den I jus' got a tight hold on dat old hog pen and  said: 'Well, Sir, I jus' thought if you didn't have enough for all of  'em, I could take Lida.' I felt myself goin' down. He started laughin'  fit to kill. 'Boy,' he says, 'Is you tryin' to ax for Lida? If so, I  don't keer 'cause she's got to git married sometime.' I was so happy I  left him right den and run back to tell Lida dat he said it was all  right.    \"Us didn't have no big weddin'. Lida had on a new calico dress and I  wore new jeans pants.

I  told Lida us better go, so us got in dat buggy and driv off, and de rest  of de folkses followed in de wagon. Marster met us in front of old Salem  Church. He had de church open and Preacher John Gibson waitin' der to  marry us. Us warn't 'spectin' no church weddin', but Marster said dat  Neal had to git married right. He never did forgit his Niggers.

Booth  Area Supervisor of  Federal Writers'  Project--Areas 6 & 7,  Augusta, Ga.    Dec. 1, 1938      John F. Van Hook was a short, stout man with a shining bald pate, a  fringe of kinky gray hair, kindly eyes, and a white mustache of the Lord  Chamberlain variety. His shabby work clothes were clean and carefully  mended, and he leaned on a cane for support.    John was looking for the \"Farm Bureau Office,\" but he agreed to return  for an interview after he had transacted his business. When he  reappeared a short time later and settled down in a comfortable chair he  gave the story of his early life with apparent enjoyment.    In language remarkably free of dialect, John began by telling his full  name and added that he was well known in Georgia and the whole country.  \"Until I retired,\" he remarked, \"I taught school in North Carolina, and  in Hall, Jackson, and Rabun Counties, in Georgia. I am farming now about  five miles from Athens in the Sandy Creek district. I was born in 1862  in Macon County, North Carolina, on the George Seller's plantation,  which borders the Little Tennessee River.    \"I don't know anything much, first hand, about the war period, as I was  quite a child when that ended, but I can tell you all about the days of  Reconstruction. What I know about the things that took place during the  war was told me by my mother and other old people.    \"My father was Bas Van Hook and he married Mary Angel, my mother. Mother  was born on Marse Dillard Love's plantation, and when his daughter, Miss  Jenny, married Marse Thomas Angel's son, Marse Dillard gave Mother to  Miss Jenny and when Little Miss Jenny Angel was born, Mother was her  nurse. Marse Thomas and Miss Jenny Angel died, and Mother stayed right  there keeping house for Little Miss Jenny and looking after her. Mother  had more sense than all the rest of the slaves put together, and she  even did Little Miss Jenny's shopping.    \"My father was the only darkey Old Man Isaac Van Hook owned, and he did  anything that came to hand: he was a good carpenter and mechanic and  helped the Van Hooks to build mills, and he made the shoes for that  settlement. Thomas Aaron, George, James, Claude, and Washington were my  five brothers, and my sisters were Zelia, Elizabeth, and Candace. Why,  Miss, the only thing I can remember right off hand that we children done  was fight and frolic like youngsters will do when they get together.  With time to put my mind on it, I would probably recollect our games and  songs, if we had any.    \"Our quarters was on a large farm on Sugar Fork River. The houses were  what you would call log huts and they were scattered about  promiscuously, no regular lay-out, just built wherever they happened to  find a good spring convenient. There was never but one room to a hut,  and they wern't particular about how many darkies they put in a room.    \"White folks had fine four-poster beds with a frame built around the top  of the bed, and over the frame hung pretty, ruffled white curtains and a  similar ruffled curtain was around the bottom of the bed; the curtains  made pretty ornaments. Slaves had beds of this general kind, but they  warn't quite as pretty and fine. Corded springs were the go then. The  beds used by most of the slaves in that day and time were called  'Georgia beds,' and these were made by boring two holes in the cabin  wall, and two in the floor, and side pieces were run from the holes in  the wall to the posts and fastened; then planks were nailed around the  sides and foot, box-fashion, to hold in the straw that we used for  mattresses; over this pretty white sheets and plenty of quilts was  spreaded. Yes, mam, there was always plenty of good warm cover in those  days. Of course, it was home-made, all of it.    \"My grandfather was a blacksmith and farmhand owned by Old Man Dillard  Love. According to my earliest recollection my grandmother Van Hook was  dead and I have no memories about her. My great, great grandmother,  Sarah Angel, looked after slave children while their mothers were at  work. She was a free woman, but she had belonged to Marse Tommy Angel  and Miss Jenny Angel; they were brother and sister. The way Granny Sarah  happened to be free was; one of the women in the Angel family died and  left a little baby soon after one of Granny's babies was born, and so  she was loaned to that family as wet nurse for the little orphan baby.  They gave her her freedom and took her into their home, because they did  not want her sleeping in slave quarters while she was nursing the white  child. In that settlement, it was considered a disgrace for a white  child to feed at the breast of a slave woman, but it was all right if  the darkey was a free woman. After she got too old to do regular work,  Granny Sarah used to glean after the reapers in the field to get wheat  for her bread. She had been a favored slave and allowed to do pretty  much as she pleased, and after she was a free woman the white folks  continued to look after her every need, but she loved to do for herself  as long as she was able to be up and about.    \"What did we have to eat then? Why, most everything; ash cakes was a  mighty go then. Cornbread dough was made into little pones and placed on  the hot rocks close to the fire to dry out a little, then hot ashes were  raked out to the front of the fireplace and piled over the ash cakes.  When thoroughly done they were taken out and the ashes washed off; they  were just like cake to us children then. We ate lots"]]]
