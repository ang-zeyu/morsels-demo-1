Old Mother Nature is doing  the best she can. Better times coming!'    \"The others would laugh at him for his faith in Old Mother Nature, and  say ugly things about her, and urge Mr. Coon to go with them out into  the Great World. But he kept right on minding his own business and  keeping neat and cheerful, until at last Old Mother Nature, all  worried and troubled, came to see what she could do to straighten  matters out. It didn't take her long to find out how all the little  meadow and forest people, except Mr. Coon, had grumbled and been  discontented and said ugly things about her, for you can't fool Old  Mother Nature, and it's of no use to try. Some she punished one way,  and some she punished another way, for of course she hadn't been to  blame for the hard times, but had been working night and day to put an  end to them.    \"Mr. Coon was the last to be called before her, and instead of being  frowning and cross, as she had been to the others, she was all smiles.  She said a lot of nice things to him, and when at last she sent him  away, what do you think she had given him?\"    \"More rings,\" cried Peter Rabbit.    \"Yes,\" replied Grandfather Frog, \"Mr. Coon's tail was ringed way to  the tip. There was one for cheerfulness, and one for faith, and one  for persistence in making the best of a bad matter and staying at  home. And ever since that long-ago day when the world was young, the  Coons have been very proud of their beautiful tails and have kept up  the good habits of old Mr. Coon. Now you know, Peter Rabbit, why  Bobby Coon wears rings on his tail,\" concluded Grandfather Frog.    Peter gave a long sigh. \"I think it's perfectly beautiful,\" he said.  \"I wish I had rings on my tail.\"    And then he wondered why everybody laughed.          XII    WHY THERE IS A BLACK HEAD IN THE BUZZARD FAMILY      Ol' Mistah Buzzard had just told the story of why he has a bald head  and is proud of it. You know he hasn't a feather on it, and it is  very, very red. It was a very interesting story, and it had been  listened to with the closest attention by a lot of the little meadow  and forest people. Unc' Billy Possum, who is Ol' Mistah Buzzard's  particular friend, both having come from \"way down souf,\" happened  along just in time to hear the end of it.    \"May Ah ask yo' a question, Brer Buzzard?\" said he.    \"Cert'nly, Brer Possum. Cert'nly,\" replied Ol' Mistah Buzzard.    \"Is Buzzard really your fam'ly name?\" asked Unc' Billy.    \"No, Brer Possum, it isn't,\" replied Ol' Mistah Buzzard. Everybody  looked surprised. You see, no one ever had heard him called anything  but Buzzard. But no one said anything, and after a minute or two Ol'  Mistah Buzzard explained.    \"Mah fam'ly name is Vulture,\" said he. \"Yes, Sah, mah fam'ly name is  Vulture, but we-uns done been called Buzzards so long, that Ah don'  know as Ah would know Ah was being spoken to, if Ah was called Mistah  Vulture.\"    \"An' do Ah understand that all of your fam'ly have red haids?\"  inquired Unc' Billy.    Ol' Mistah Buzzard looked down at Unc' Billy, and he saw a twinkle in  Unc' Billy's shrewd little eyes. Ol' Mistah Buzzard grinned.    \"Ah knows jes' what yo' done got in your mind, Brer Possum,\" said he.  \"It's that trifling, no 'count cousin of mine. He's a Buzzard, or a  Vulture, if yo' like that better, jes' like Ah am, but he belongs to  another branch of the fam'ly. He has a bald haid, jes' like Ah have,  but his haid is black instead of red. That's because his grandpap was  trifling an' po' trash, jes' like he is.\"    Peter Rabbit pricked up his ears. This sounded like another story. He  was curious about that black-headed cousin of Ol' Mistah Buzzard, very  curious indeed. He wondered if Ol' Mistah Buzzard would have to be  teased for a story, like Grandfather Frog. Anyway, he would find out.  There would be no harm in trying.    \"If you please, how does your cousin happen to have a black head?\"  asked Peter as politely as he knew how.    \"Because his grandpap asked too many questions,\" replied Ol' Mistah  Buzzard, slyly winking at the others.    Everybody laughed, for everybody knows that no one asks more questions  than Peter Rabbit. Peter laughed with the rest, although he looked a  wee bit foolish. But he didn't mean to give up just because he was  laughed at. Oh, my, no!    \"Please, Mr. Buzzard, please tell us the story,\" he begged.    Now Ol' Mistah Buzzard is naturally good-natured and accommodating,  and when Peter begged so hard, he just couldn't find it in his heart  to refuse. Besides, he rather enjoys telling stories. So he shook his  feathers out, half spread his wings to let the air blow under them,  looked down at all the little meadow and forest people gathered about  the foot of the tall, dead tree where he delights to roost, grinned  at them in the funniest way, and then began this story:    \"Way back in the days when Grandpap Buzzard had his lil falling out  with ol' King Eagle and done fly so high he sco'tch the feathers offen  his haid, he had a cousin, did Grandpap Buzzard, and this cousin was  jes' naturally lazy and no 'count. Like most no 'count people, he used  to make a regular nuisance of hisself, poking his nose into ev'ybody's  business and never 'tending to his own. Wasn't anything going on that  this trifling member of the Buzzard fam'ly didn't find out about and  meddle in. He could ask mo' questions than Peter Rabbit can, an'  anybody that can do that has got to ask a lot.\"    Everybody looked at Peter and laughed. Peter made a funny face and  laughed too.    \"Seemed like he jes' went 'round from mo'ning to night asking  questions,\" continued Ol' Mistah Buzzard, \"Got so that eve'ybody  dreaded to see that no 'count Buzzard coming, because he bound to  pester with questions about things what don't concern him no ways.    \"Now yo' know that way down in Ol' Virginny where Ah done come from,  mah fam'ly done got the habit of sitting on the tops of chimneys in  the wintertime to warm their toes.\"    \"Why, I thought it was warm down south!\" interrupted Peter Rabbit.    \"So it is, Brer Rabbit! So it is!\" Ol' Mistah Buzzard hastened to say.  \"But yo' see, ol' Jack Frost try to come down there sometimes, an' he  cool the air off a right smart lot before he turn tail an' run back  where he belong. So we-uns sit on the chimney-tops whenever ol' Jack  Frost gets to straying down where he have no business. Yo' see, if  we-uns keep our toes warm, we-uns are warm all over.    \"One day this no 'count, trifling cousin of Grandpap Buzzard get cold  in his feet. He look 'round right smart fo' a chimney fo' to warm his  toes, an' pretty soon he see one where he never been before. It was on  a lil ol' house, a lil ol' tumble-down house. Mistah Buzzard fly right  over an' sit on that chimney-top fo' to warm his toes. Of course he  right smart curious about that lil ol' tumble-down house and who live  there. He hear somebody inside talking to theirself, but he can't hear  what they say, jes' a mumbling sound that come up the chimney to him.    \"He listen an' listen. Then he shift 'round to the other side of the  chimney an' listen. No matter where he sit, he can't hear what being  said down inside that lil ol' tumble-down house. Then what do yo'  think Mistah Buzzard do? Why, he jes' stretch his fool haid as far  down that chimney as he can an' listen an' listen. Yes, Sah, that is  jes' what that no 'count Buzzard do. But all he hear is jes' a  mumbling and a mumbling, an' that make him more curious than ever. It  seem to him that he must go clean outen his haid 'less he hear what  going on down inside that lil ol' house.    \"Now when he stretch his haid an' neck down the chimney that way, he  get 'em all black with soot. But he don't mind that. No, Sah, he don'  mind that a bit. Fact is, he don' notice it. He so curious he don'  notice anything, an' pretty soon he plumb fo'get where he is an' that  he is listening where he have no business. He plumb fo'get all about  this, an' he holler down that chimney. Yes, Sah, he holler right down  that chimney!    \"'Will yo'-alls please speak a lil louder,' he holler down the  chimney, jes' like that.    \"Now the lil ol' woman what lived by herself in that lil ol'  tumble-down house hadn't seen that no 'count Buzzard light on the  chimney fo' to warm his toes, an' when she hear that voice coming  right outen the fireplace, she was some flustrated and scared, was  that lil ol' woman. Yes, Sah, she sho'ly was plumb scared. She so  scared she tip over a whole kettleful of soup right in the fire. Of  course that make a terrible mess an' a powerful lot of smoke an' hot  ashes fly up the chimney. They like to choke that no 'count Buzzard to  death. They burn the feathers offen his haid an' neck, an' the soot  make him black, all but his feet an' laigs an' the inside of his  wings, which he keep closed.    \"Mistah Buzzard he give a mighty squawk an' fly away. When he get  home, he try an' try to brush that soot off, but it done get into the  skin an' it stay there. An' from that day his haid an' neck stay  black, an' he never speak lessen he spoken to, an' then he only grunt.  His chillen jes' like him, an' his chillen's chillen the same way. An'  that is the reason that mah cousin who lives down souf done have a  black haid,\" concluded Ol' Mistah Buzzard.    A little sigh of satisfaction went around the circle of listeners. As  usual, Peter Rabbit was the first to speak.    \"That was a splendid story, Mr. Buzzard,\" said he, \"and I'm ever and  ever so much obliged to you. It was just as good as one of Grandfather  Frog's.\"    Ol' Mistah Buzzard grinned and slowly winked one eye at Unc' Billy  Possum as he replied: \"Thank yo', Brer Rabbit. That's quite the  nicest thing yo' could say.\"    \"But it's true!\" shouted all together, and then everybody gave three  cheers for Ol' Mistah Buzzard"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14959"],[0,"The Hymns of Prudentius (#11)"],[1,"Close.      By His word was all created; He commands and lo! 'tis done;      Earth and sky and boundless ocean, universe of three in one,    All that sees the moon's soft radiance, all that breathes beneath the sun.      He assumed this mortal body, frail and feeble, doomed to die,      That the race from dust created might not perish utterly,    Which the dreadful Law had sentenced in the depths of Hell to lie.      O how blest that wondrous birthday, when the Maid the curse retrieved,      Brought to birth mankind's salvation, by the Holy Ghost conceived;    And the sacred Babe, Redeemer of the world, her arms received.      Sing, ye heights of heaven, His praises; angels and archangels, sing!      Wheresoe'er ye be, ye faithful, let your joyous anthems ring,    Every tongue His name confessing, countless voices answering.      This is He whom seer and sibyl sang in ages long gone by;      This is He of old revealed in the page of prophecy;    Lo! He comes, the promised Saviour; let the world His praises cry!      In the urns the clear, cold water turns to juice of noblest vine,      And the servant, drawing from them, starts to see the generous wine,    While the host, its savour tasting, wonders at the draught divine.      To the leper worn and wasted, white with many a loathsome sore,      \"Be thou cleansed,\" He said; \"I bid it!\" swift 'tis done, His words restore;    To the priest the gift he offers, clean and healthful as of yore.      On the eyes long sealed in darkness, buried in unbroken night,      Thou didst spread Thy lips' sweet nectar, mixed with clay: then came the sight,    As Thy gracious touch all-healing brought to those dark orbs the light.      Thou didst chide the raging tempest, when the waves with foaming crest      Leaped about the fragile vessel, buffeted and sore distressed;    Wind and wave, their fury stilling, sank to calm at Thy behest.      Once a woman's timid fingers touched Thy garment's lowest braid,      And the pallor left her visage, healing power the touch conveyed,    For the years of pain were ended and the flow of blood was stayed.      Thou didst see men bear to burial one struck down in youth's glad tide,      While a widowed mother followed, wailing for her boy that died;    \"Rise!\" Thou saidst, and led him gently to his weeping mother's side.      Lazarus, who lay in darkness till three nights had passed away,      At Thy voice awoke to soundness, rising to the light of day,    As the breath his frame re-entered touched already with decay.      See, He walks upon the waters, treads the billow's rolling crest;      O'er the shifting depths of ocean firm and sure His footsteps rest,    And the wave parts not asunder where those holy feet are pressed.      And the madman, chained and tortured by dark powers, from whom all fly,      As the tombs, that were his dwelling, echo to his savage cry,    Rushes forth and falls adoring, when he sees that Christ is nigh.      Then the legion of foul spirits, driven from their human prey,      Seize the noisome swine, that feeding high upon the hillside stray,    And the herd, in sudden frenzy, plunges in the waters grey.      \"Gather in twelve woven baskets all the fragments that remain:\"      He hath fed the weary thousands, resting o'er the grassy plain,    And His power hath stayed their hunger with five loaves and fishes twain.      Thine, O Christ, is endless sweetness; Thou art our celestial Bread:      Nevermore he knoweth hunger, who upon Thy grace hath fed,    Grace whereby no mortal body but the soul is nourished.      They that knew not speech nor language, closed to every sound their ears,      To the Master's call responding break the barriers of years;    Now the deaf holds joyous converse and the lightest whisper hears.      Sickness at His word departed, pain and pallid languor fled,      Many a tongue, long chained in silence, words of praise and blessing said;    And the palsied man rejoicing through the city bore his bed.      Yea, that they might know salvation who in Hades' prison were pent,      In His mercy condescending through Hell's gloomy gates He went;    Bolt and massy hinge were shattered, adamantine portals rent.      For the door that all receiveth, but releaseth nevermore,      Opens now and, slowly turning, doth the ghosts to light restore,    Who, the eternal laws suspended, tread again its dusky floor.      But, while God with golden glory floods the murky realms of night,      And upon the startled shadows dawns a day serene and bright,    In the darkened vault of heaven stars forlorn refuse their light.      For the sun in garb of mourning veiled his radiant orb and passed      From his flaming path in sorrow, hiding till mankind aghast    Deemed that o'er a world of chaos Night's eternal pall was cast.      Now, my soul, in liquid measures let the sounding numbers flow;      Sing the trophy of His passion, sing the Cross triumphant now;    Sing the ensign of Christ's glory, marked on every faithful brow.      Ah! how wondrous was the fountain flowing from His pierced side,      Whence the blood and water mingled in a strange and sacred tide,--    Water, sign of mystic cleansing; blood, the martyr's crown of pride.      In that hour the ancient Serpent saw the holy Victim slain,      Saw, and shed his hate envenomed, all his malice spent in vain;    See! the hissing neck is broken as he writhes in sullen pain.      Aye, what boots it, cursed Serpent, that the man God made from clay,      Victim of thy baleful cunning, by thy lies was led astray?    God hath ta'en a mortal body and hath washed the guilt away.      Christ, our Captain, for a season deigned to dwell in Death's domain,      That the dead, long time imprisoned, might return to life again,    Breaking by His great example ancient sins' enthralling chain.      Thus, upon the third glad morning, patriarchs and saints of yore,      As the risen Lord ascended, followed Him who went before,    From forgotten graves proceeding, habited in flesh once more.      Limb to limb unites and rises from the ashes dry and cold,      And the life-blood courses warmly through the frames long turned to mould,    Skin and flesh, anew created, muscle, bone and nerve enfold.      Then, mankind to life restoring, Death downtrodden 'neath His feet,      Lo! the Victor mounts triumphant to the Father's judgment-seat,    Bringing back to heaven the glory by His passion made complete.      Hail! Thou Judge of souls departed: hail! of all the living King!      On the Father's right hand throned, through His courts Thy praises ring,    Till at last for all offences righteous judgment Thou shalt bring.      Now let old and young uniting chant to Thee harmonious lays,      Maid and matron hymn Thy glory, infant lips their anthem raise,    Boys and girls together singing with pure heart their song of praise.      Let the storm and summer sunshine, gliding stream and sounding shore,      Sea and forest, frost and zephyr, day and night their Lord adore;    Let creation join to laud Thee through the ages evermore.                              X. HYMNUS AD EXEQUIAS DEFUNCTI          Deus ignee fons animarum,    duo qui socians elementa    vivum simul ac moribundum    hominem Pater effigiasti:        Tua sunt, tua rector utraque,      5    tibi copula iungitur horum,    tibi, dum vegetata cohaerent,    et spiritus et caro servit.        Rescissa sed ista seorsum    solvunt hominera perimuntque,       10    humus excipit arida corpus,    animae rapit aura liquorem.        Quia cuncta creata necesse est    labefacta senescere tandem,    conpactaque dissociari,             15    et dissona texta retexi.        Hanc tu, Deus optime, mortem    famulis abolere paratus    iter inviolabile monstras,    quo perdita membra resurgant:       20        Ut, dum generosa caducis    ceu carcere clausa ligantur,    pars illa potentior extet,    quae germen ab aethere traxit.        Si terrea forte voluntas          25    luteum sapit et grave captat,    animus quoque pondere victus    sequitur sua membra deorsum.        At si generis memor ignis    contagia pigra recuset,             30    vehit hospita viscera secum,    pariterque reportat ad astra.        Nam quod requiescere corpus    vacuum sine mente videmus,    spatium breve restat, ut alti       35    repetat conlegia sensus.        Venient cito secula, cum iam    socius calor ossa revisat    animataque sanguine vivo    habitacula pristina gestet.         40        Quae pigra cadavera pridem    tumulis putrefacta iacebant,    volucres rapientur in auras    animas comitata priores.        Hinc maxima cura sepulcris        45    inpenditur: hinc resolutos    honor ultimus accipit artus    et funeris ambitus ornat.        Candore nitentia claro    praetendere lintea mos est,         50    adspersaque myrrha Sabaeo    corpus medicamine servat.        Quidnam sibi saxa cavata,    quid pulchra volunt monumenta,    nisi quod res creditur illis        55    non mortua, sed data somno?        Hoc provida Christicolarum    pietas studet, utpote credens    fore protinus omnia viva,    quae nunc gelidus sopor urget.      60        Qui iacta cadavera passim    miserans tegit aggere terrae,    opus exhibet ille benignum    Christo pius omnipotenti:        Quin lex eadem monet omnes        65    gemitum dare sorte sub una,    cognataque funera nobis    aliena in morte dolere.        Sancti sator ille Tobiae    sacer ac venerabilis heros,         70    dapibus iam rite paratis    ius praetulit exequiarum.        Iam stantibus ille ministris    cyathos et fercula liquit,    studioque accinctus humandi         75    fleto dedit ossa sepulcro.        Veniunt mox praemia caelo    pretiumque rependitur ingens:    nam lumina nescia solis    Deus inlita felle serenat.          80        Iam tunc docuit Pater orbis,    quam sit rationis egenis    mordax et amara medela,    cum lux animum nova vexat.
