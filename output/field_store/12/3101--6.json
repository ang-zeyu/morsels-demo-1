Yet in regard to further details,  connected with the interior, it must be admitted that there is very little  more which is deserving of particular description; except it be _the  gallery_, which runs within the walls of the nave and choir, and which is  considerably more light and elegant than that of the cathedral. A great  deal has been said about the circular windows at the end of the south  transept, and they are undoubtedly elegant: but compared with the one at  the extremity of the nave, they are rather to be noticed from the tale  attached to them, than from their positive beauty. The tale, my friend, is  briefly this. These windows were finished (as well as the larger one at the  west front) about the year 1439. One of them was executed by the  master-mason, the other by his apprentice; and on being criticised by  competent judges, the performance of the _latter_ was said to eclipse that  of the former. In consequence, the master became jealous and revengeful,  and actually poniarded his apprentice. He was of course tried, condemned,  and executed; but an existing monument to his memory attests the humanity  of the monks in giving him Christian interment.[54] On the whole, it is the  absence of all obtrusive and unappropriate ornament which gives to the  interior of this building that light, unencumbered, and faery-like effect  which so peculiarly belongs to it, and which creates a sensation that I  never remember to have felt within any other similar edifice.    Let me however put in a word for the _Organ_. It is immense, and perhaps  larger than that belonging to the Cathedral. The tin pipes (like those of  the organ in the Cathedral) are of their natural colour. I paced the  pavement beneath, and think that this organ cannot be short of forty  English feet in length. Indeed, in all the churches which I have yet seen,  the organs strike me as being of magnificent dimensions.    You should be informed however that the extreme length of the interior,  from the further end of the Chapel of the Virgin, to its opposite western  extremity, is about four hundred and fifty English feet; while the height,  from the pavement to the roof of the nave, or the choir, is one hundred and  eight English feet. The transepts are about one hundred and forty feet in  length. The central tower, upon the whole, is not only the grandest tower  in Rouen, but there is nothing for its size in our own country that can  compare with it. It rises upwards of one hundred feet above the roof of the  church; and is supported below, or rather within, by four magnificent  cluster-pillared bases, each about thirty-two feet in circumference. Its  area, at bottom, can hardly be less than thirty-six feet square. The choir  is flanked by flying buttresses, which have a double tier of small arches,  altogether \"marvellous and curious to behold.\"    I could not resist stealing quietly round to the porch of the _south  transept_, and witnessing, in that porch, one of the most chaste, light,  and lovely specimens of Gothic architecture, which can be contemplated.  Indeed, I hardly know any thing like it.[55] The leaves of the poplar and  ash were beginning to mantle the exterior; and, seen through their green  and gay lattice work, the traceries of the porch seemed to assume a more  interesting aspect. They are now mending the upper part of the facade with  new stone of peculiar excellence--but it does not harmonise with the old  work. They merit our thanks, however, for the preservation of what remains  of this precious pile. I should remark to you that the eastern and  north-eastern sides of the abbey of St. Ouen are surrounded with promenades  and trees: so that, occasionally, either when walking, or sitting upon the  benches, within these gardens, you catch one of the finest views imaginable  of the abbey.    At this early season of the year, much company is assembled every evening  in these walks: while, in front of the abbey, or in the square facing the  western end, the national guard is exercised in the day time--and troops of  fair nymphs and willing youths mingle in the dance on a sabbath evening,  while a platform is erected for the instrumental performers, and for the  exhibition of feats of legerdemain. You must not take leave of St. Ouen  without being told that, formerly, the French Kings used occasionally to  \"make revel\" within the Abbot's house. Henry II, Charles IX, and Henry III,  each took a fancy to this spot--but especially the famous HENRI QUATRE. It  is reported that that monarch sojourned here for four months--- and his  reply to the address of the aldermen and sheriff of Rouen is yet preserved  both in MS. and by engravings. \"The King having arrived at St. Ouen (says  an old MS.)[56] the keys of the tower were presented to him, in the  presence of M. de Montpensier, the governor of the province, upon a  velvet-cushion. The keys were gilt. The King took them, and replacing them  in the hands of the governor, said--\"Mon cousin, je vous les baille pour  les rendre, qu'ils les gardent;\"--then, addressing the aldermen, he added,  \"Soyez moi bons sujets et je vous serai bon Roi, et le meilleur Roi que  vous ayez jamais eu.\"    Next to the Abbey of St. Ouen, \"go by all means and see the church _St.  Maclou_\"--say your friends and your guides. The Abbe Turquier accompanied  me thither. The great beauties of St. Maclou are its tower and its porch.  Of the tower, little more than the lantern remains. This is about 160  English feet in height. Above it was a belfry or steeple, another 110 feet  in height, constructed of wood and lead--but which has been nearly  destroyed for the sake of the lead,--for the purpose of slaughter or  resistance during the late revolution.[57] The exteriors of the porches are  remarkable for their elaborate ornaments; especially those in the _Rue  Martainville._ They are highly praised by the inhabitants, and are supposed  to be after the models of the famous Goujon. Perhaps they are rather  encumbered with ornament, and want that quiet effect, and pure good taste,  which we see in the porches of the Cathedral and of the Abbey St. Ouen.  However, let critics determine as they will upon this point--they must at  least unite in reprobating the barbarous edict which doomed these delicate  pieces of sculptured art to be deluged with an over-whelming tint of  staring yellow ochre!    Of the remaining churches, I shall mention only four: two of them chiefly  remarkable for their interior, and two for their extreme antiquity. Of the  two former, that of _St. Vincent_ presents you with a noble organ, with a  light choir profusely gilded, and (rarer accompaniment!) in very excellent  taste. But the stained glass is the chief magnet of attraction. It is rich,  varied, and vivid to a degree; and, upon the whole, is the finest specimen  of this species of art in the present ecclesiastical remains of the city.  _St. Vivien_ is the second of these two former. It is a fine open church,  with a large organ, having a very curious wooden screen in front,  elaborately carved, and, as I conceive, of the very earliest part of the  sixteenth century. I ascended the organ-loft; and the door happening to be  open, I examined this screen (which has luckily escaped the yellow-ochre  edict) very minutely, and was much gratified by the examination. Such  pieces of art, so situated, are of rare occurrence. For the first time,  within a parish church, I stepped upon the pavement of the choir: walked  gently forwards, to the echo of my own footsteps, (for not a creature was  in the church) and, \"with no unhallowed hand\" I would hope, ventured to  open the choral or service book, resting upon its stand. It was wide,  thick, and ponderous: upon vellum: beautifully written and well executed in  every respect, with the exception of the illuminations which were extremely  indifferent. I ought to tell you that the doors of the churches, abroad,  are open at all times of the day: the ancient or more massive door, or  portal, is secured from shutting; but a temporary, small, shabby wooden  door, covered with dirty green baize, opening and shutting upon circular  hinges, just covers the vacuum left by the absence of the larger one.    Of the two ancient churches, above alluded to, that of _St. Gervais_, is  situated considerably to the north of where the _Boulevards Cauchoise_ and  _Bouvreuil_ meet. It was hard by this favourite spot, say the Norman  historians, that the ancient Dukes of Normandy built their country-houses:  considering it as a _lieu de plaisance._ Here too it was that the Conqueror  came to breathe his last--desiring to be conveyed thither, from his palace  in the city, for the benefit of the pure air.[58] I walked with M. Le  Prevost to this curious church: having before twice seen it. But the  _Crypt_ is the only thing worth talking about, on the score of antiquity.  The same accomplished guide bade me remark the extraordinary formation of  the capitals of the pillars: which, admitting some perversity of taste in a  rude, Norman, imitative artist, are decidedly of Roman character.  \"Perhaps,\" said M. Le Prevost, \"the last efforts of Roman art previous to  the relinquishment of the Romans.\" Among these capitals there is one of the  perfect Doric order; while in another you discover the remains of two Roman  eagles. The columns are all of the same height; and totally unlike every  thing of the kind which I have seen or heard of.    We descended the hill upon which _St. Gervais_ is built, and walked onward  towards _St. Paul_, situated at the further and opposite end of the town,  upon a gentle eminence, just above the Banks of the Seine.[59] M. Le  Prevost was still our conductor. This small edifice is certainly of remote  antiquity, but I suspect it to be completely Norman. The eastern end is  full of antiquarian curiosities. We observed something like a Roman mask as  the centre ornament"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16255"],[0,"Dickey Downy: The Autobiography of a Bird (#11)"],[1,"them  nor follow them.    Joe sometimes slyly threw pebbles at this blue hen to scare her and  make her jump and pull at the string, when he thought his mother was  not looking.  As pay for his sport he often got his ears cuffed, for  though his mother did not seem to notice how cruelly he teased me, she  would not allow him to frighten her fowls.    \"Don't you know that a hen that's all the time skeered won't lay?\" was  the lesson she tried to impress on him as she punished him.    But the thing I liked best of all was to see Betty's seven white ducks  crowd up to the kitchen door every time any one appeared with a pan of  scraps.  Such gabbling and quacking, such pushing and such stepping on  each other and on the chickens, in their eagerness to get there first,  was almost laughable.  In fact, the pink-toed pigeons that walked up  and down the ridge of the barn roof, did make fun of them openly.  Had  I not known the ducks were well fed and so fat they could scarcely  waddle, I might have thought they were really hungry, but I soon  discovered that they were simply greedy.    Standing on tiptoe and stretching up their long necks they often seized  the food before it had a chance to fall to the ground.  By this good  management they usually got more than the chickens.  Joe accused Betty  of being partial to the ducks.    \"You allus give 'em the best of everything, and twice as much as you do  the chickens,\" he complained.    \"They get the most because they've got the most confidence in me,\" said  Betty, putting on a very wise look.  \"They come close up to me, while a  chicken shies off and misses the goodies coz she's silly enough to be  afraid.  Besides, the ducks are mine.  I raised 'em.  I paid twenty  cents a setting for the eggs out of my own money, and when you raise a  thing you generally like it the best.  Ducks are a heap smarter'n  chickens, anyway,\" she asserted.  \"I never can get one of the chickens  to feed out of a spoon, and the ducks like it the best kind.\"  To  convince him she held toward them a large baking spoon of soured milk.  This milk was thickened into a paste or ball by being put on the stove  and separated from the whey, or watery part, by the action of the heat.    It was a favorite dish with the fowls, and they all smacked their lips  when they saw it coming.    As fast as Betty could fill the spoon it was emptied by the ducks, who  stuck their big yellow bills into it and devoured the contents, letting  the chickens below scramble and push and pick each other for any stray  bits that fell to the ground.    \"Didn't I tell you?\" said Betty triumphantly.  \"Them chickens had just  as good a chance as the ducks, but they wouldn't take it.\"    \"Huh!\" answered Joe.  \"Their necks ain't long enough, is what's the  matter.\"    There were several trees in the yard, and often when the fowls were  fed, birds flew down from their leafy recesses to pick up the crumbs  left lying about.  How I used to wish they would come near enough to my  cage that I might converse with them, but it always happened that just  at the time when one of them would settle close to the house, either  Joe's little dog, Colly, would run across the yard, or Betty or her  mother would appear at the door and frighten my feathered friend away.  Only once did I exchange a word with any of these birds, and that for  but a few short minutes.    The bird did not belong to our family, nor had I ever met any of his  relatives before, but that made but little difference.  He was a bird,  and that was enough.  We did not wait for any formal introduction; but  as he balanced himself on the edge of my cage he hurriedly told me news  of the woods, and how he wished I might get free and come to live  there.  He told of the lovely dragon flies, with purple, burnished  wings that floated in the forest, mingling their drowsy hum with the  chirping of the birds.  He told of the great mossy carpet spread under  the trees; how at set of day the owls came out, and the moles rustled  in the fallen leaves, and the frogs raised their evening hymn to the  sinking sun.    I could have listened for hours to the sweet familiar tale my feathered  brother told of life in the happy woodland, but Betty's mother suddenly  hurrying out to the pump to fill her bucket, cut short the story, and  away my bird friend skimmed out of sight without so much as saying  \"good-bye.\"  Though I saw him several times after that, he never came  so close again.    \"Oh, what heaps and heaps of fireflies!\" exclaimed Betty, as she  unhooked my cage to move me into the house that evening.  \"It looks as  if our door-yard was full of moving lanterns.\"    \"Nothin' but lightnen bugs!\" said Joe contemptuously.  \"Here, see me  catch 'em,\" and in a few minutes he showed her a handful which he had  killed by crushing between his hands.    \"Hold on, I want to catch some too!\" and hustling me into the kitchen,  Betty ran along with him and was soon engaged in catching and killing  the beautiful fireflies.          CHAPTER IX    THE HUNTERS    Song birds, plumage birds, water fowl, and many innocent birds of prey,  are hunted from the everglades to the Arctic Circles for the barbaric  purpose of decorating women's hats.  The extent of this traffic is  simply appalling.--_G. O. Shields._      When Joe and his father came back from their gunning expeditions, the  accounts they gave of the day's slaughter made me very homesick and  miserable, and wore sadly on my spirits in my captivity.    The heartless indifference with which the woman would ask her husband  if it had been \"a good day for killings,\" almost made me wail aloud.    \"Best kind of luck; I bagged nearly a hundred this trip,\" he replied  exultingly, one night when she put the usual question.  \"The birds were  as thick as blackberries in the high weeds along the creek, and were  havin' a mighty good time stuffing themselves with seeds.  Joe fired  the old gun to start 'em and, great Jerushy! in a minute the sky was  dark with 'em; I just blazed away and they dropped thick all around us,  and it kept us tol'ble busy for a while a pickin' 'em up.\"    \"Pop, tell 'em about the old water bird down in the swamp,\" said Joe  with a wicked laugh.    \"Yes, tell us; what was it, pop?\" urged Betty.    \"Oh, nothin' partickler, I reckon; just an old bird that hadn't the  grit to get away from me,\" and the man gave a low chuckle at the  remembrance.    \"My, oh! the way them old birds hung around and wouldn't scare worth a  cent when we was right up close to 'em was funny, I tell ye,\" and Joe  leaned back in his chair and slapped his knees in a fresh burst of  merriment.    \"There was eggs in the nest was the cause,\" said the man; \"them birds  are always as tame as kittens then.  You can go right up to 'em and  they won't leave the nest.  Them birds has two broods in a season, and  then's the chance to get a good whack at 'em.\"    Joe rubbed his hands together in delight as he turned to his sister,  \"You'd ought to have seen 'em, Betty.  There was pop in his rubber  boots a creepin' along--a c-r-e-e-p-i-n' along as sly as a mouse toward  'em, and there they stayed.  The male bird he fluttered and' squawked,  and the female she stuck to the nest till pop he got right up and he  didn't even have to shoot her.  He just clubbed her over the back and  down she went ker-splash as dead as you please.  Them there eggs won't  hardly hatch out this year, I don't reckon,\" and at the prospect Joe  broke into a malicious guffaw.    \"I think to club it was meaner'n to shoot the poor thing,\" said Betty  indignantly.  \"And, anyway, I wouldn't a-killed it on the nest.  It's  mean to treat an 'fectionate bird so.\"    \"Pshaw, you'd do big things!\" was Joe's scornful reply.    \"Well, I wouldn't be so tremenj'us cruel,\" persisted Betty; \"I don't  believe in killing a pretty bird.\"    \"But what would the wimmen do without bunnet trimmen' if we didn't kill  'em, hey?\" and Joe finished his question with a taunting whistle.    As the shadows of each evening gathered around the cottage, the shadow  over my life seemed to deepen and grow more gloomy.  Outside the door I  could hear the hum of the bees as they flew homeward, the wind-harp  played in the yellow pines its softest, sweetest music, and I scented  the odor of honeysuckles and roses far away.  The rushing of the waters  over the stones in the creek tinkled dreamily, but in the midst of all  earth's loveliness I was desolate, because I was not free.    And thus the summer days dragged wearily along, and the autumn came.  It is not surprising then that I was overjoyed when later on I learned  that I was to be given as a present to a young relative of Betty's, who  lived to the northward in a distant State.  My present existence had  grown almost intolerable, and I felt that any change could scarcely  make my condition worse, and there was a chance of its being better.  The prospect put new life into me.    Preening my feathers became a pleasant task once more.  I whetted my  bill till it glistened, and my long-neglected toilet again became my  daily care.    \"I shall be mighty glad to get rid of the mopy creature,\" Betty's  mother had, said when they talked of my departure.  \"I wouldn't give  the thing house-room for my part.\"    \"Cousin Polly will like it, though,\" Betty answered her mother.  \"Polly  was always fond of pets, and she'll be powerful pleased to get it as a  present from her Southern kinfolks.\"    \"We'll have to go to the cost of a new cage, I reckon, and I don't feel  like spending the money, neither,\" mused the mother.  \"Polly might like  a bresspin better.  I don't know as it will pay to send her the bird  after all.\"    How my heart sank at this announcement! so fearful was I that I might  have to remain at the cottage; but Betty's answer gave me new hope.    \"Oh, certain it will pay!\" she exclaimed eagerly.  \"You know how many  nice things Cousin Dunbar's sent us off-and-on, and only"]]]
