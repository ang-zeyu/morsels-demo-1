Bureau of Mines Report, 1918.      This table shows how inadequate was the reaction of the United States to  the war demand for potassium salts. The minimum yearly requirements of  the United States are estimated to be 250,000 tons of potash.    This completes our survey of the visible sources of potash in America.  In 1917 under the pressure of the embargo and unprecedented prices the  output of potash (K_{2}O) in various forms was raised to 32,573 tons,  but this is only about a tenth as much as we needed. In 1918 potash  production was further raised to 52,135 tons, chiefly through the  increase of the output from natural brines to 39,255 tons, nearly twice  what it was the year before. The rust in cotton and the resulting  decrease in yield during the war are laid to lack of potash. Truck crops  grown in soils deficient in potash do not stand transportation well. The  Bureau of Animal Industry has shown in experiments in Aroostook County,  Maine, that the addition of moderate amounts of potash doubled the yield  of potatoes.    Professor Ostwald, the great Leipzig chemist, boasted in the war:         America went into the war like a man with a rope round his neck       which is in his enemy's hands and is pretty tightly drawn. With       its tremendous deposits Germany has a world monopoly in potash,       a point of immense value which cannot be reckoned too highly       when once this war is going to be settled. It is in Germany's       power to dictate which of the nations shall have plenty of food       and which shall starve.    If, indeed, some mineralogist or metallurgist will cut that rope by  showing us a supply of cheap potash we will erect him a monument as big  as Washington's. But Ostwald is wrong in supposing that America is as  dependent as Germany upon potash. The bulk of our food crops are at  present raised without the use of any fertilizers whatever.    As the cession of Lorraine in 1871 gave Germany the phosphates she  needed for fertilizers so the retrocession of Alsace in 1919 gives  France the potash she needed for fertilizers. Ten years before the war a  bed of potash was discovered in the Forest of Monnebruck, near  Hartmannsweilerkopf, the peak for which French and Germans contested so  fiercely and so long. The layer of potassium salts is 16-1/2 feet thick  and the total deposit is estimated to be 275,000,000 tons of potash. At  any rate it is a formidable rival of Stassfurt and its acquisition by  France breaks the German monopoly.    When we turn to the consideration of the third plant food we feel  better. While the United States has no such monopoly of phosphates as  Germany had of potash and Chile had of nitrates we have an abundance and  to spare. Whereas we formerly _imported_ about $17,000,000 worth of  potash from Germany and $20,000,000 worth of nitrates from Chile a year  we _exported_ $7,000,000 worth of phosphates.    Whoever it was who first noticed that the grass grew thicker around a  buried bone he lived so long ago that we cannot do honor to his powers  of observation, but ever since then--whenever it was--old bones have  been used as a fertilizer. But we long ago used up all the buffalo bones  we could find on the prairies and our packing houses could not give us  enough bone-meal to go around, so we have had to draw upon the old  bone-yards of prehistoric animals. Deposits of lime phosphate of such  origin were found in South Carolina in 1870 and in Florida in 1888.  Since then the industry has developed with amazing rapidity until in  1913 the United States produced over three million tons of phosphates,  nearly half of which was sent abroad. The chief source at present is the  Florida pebbles, which are dredged up from the bottoms of lakes and  rivers or washed out from the banks of streams by a hydraulic jet. The  gravel is washed free from the sand and clay, screened and dried, and  then is ready for shipment. The rock deposits of Florida and South  Carolina are more limited than the pebble beds and may be exhausted in  twenty-five or thirty years, but Tennessee and Kentucky have a lot in  reserve and behind them are Idaho, Wyoming and other western states with  millions of acres of phosphate land, so in this respect we are  independent.    But even here the war hit us hard. For the calcium phosphate as it comes  from the ground is not altogether available because it is not very  soluble and the plants can only use what they can get in the water that  they suck up from the soil. But if the phosphate is treated with  sulfuric acid it becomes more soluble and this product is sold as  \"superphosphate.\" The sulfuric acid is made mostly from iron pyrite and  this we have been content to import, over 800,000 tons of it a year,  largely from Spain, although we have an abundance at home. Since the  shortage of shipping shut off the foreign supply we are using more of  our own pyrite and also our deposits of native sulfur along the Gulf  coast. But as a consequence of this sulfuric acid during the war went up  from $5 to $25 a ton and acidulated phosphates rose correspondingly.    Germany is short on natural phosphates as she is long on natural potash.  But she has made up for it by utilizing a by-product of her steelworks.  When phosphorus occurs in iron ore, even in minute amounts, it makes the  steel brittle. Much of the iron ores of Alsace-Lorraine were formerly  considered unworkable because of this impurity, but shortly after  Germany took these provinces from France in 1871 a method was discovered  by two British metallurgists, Thomas and Gilchrist, by which the  phosphorus is removed from the iron in the process of converting it into  steel. This consists in lining the crucible or converter with lime and  magnesia, which takes up the phosphorus from the melted iron. This slag  lining, now rich in phosphates, can be taken out and ground up for  fertilizer. So the phosphorus which used to be a detriment is now an  additional source of profit and this British invention has enabled  Germany to make use of the territory she stole from France to outstrip  England in the steel business. In 1910 Germany produced 2,000,000 tons  of Thomas slag while only 160,000 tons were produced in the United  Kingdom. The open hearth process now chiefly used in the United States  gives an acid instead of a basic phosphate slag, not suitable as a  fertilizer. The iron ore of America, with the exception of some of the  southern ores, carries so small a percentage of phosphorus as to make a  basic process inadvisable.    Recently the Germans have been experimenting with a combined fertilizer,  Schroeder's potassium phosphate, which is said to be as good as Thomas  slag for phosphates and as good as Stassfurt salts for potash. The  American Cyanamid Company is just putting out a similar product,  \"Ammo-Phos,\" in which the ammonia can be varied from thirteen to twenty  per cent. and the phosphoric acid from twenty to forty-seven per cent.  so as to give the proportions desired for any crop. We have then the  possibility of getting the three essential plant foods altogether in  one compound with the elimination of most of the extraneous elements  such as lime and magnesia, chlorids and sulfates.    For the last three hundred years the American people have been living on  the unearned increment of the unoccupied land. But now that all our land  has been staked out in homesteads and we cannot turn to new soil when we  have used up the old, we must learn, as the older races have learned,  how to keep up the supply of plant food. Only in this way can our  population increase and prosper. As we have seen, the phosphate question  need not bother us and we can see our way clear toward solving the  nitrate question. We gave the Government $20,000,000 to experiment on  the production of nitrates from the air and the results will serve for  fields as well as firearms. But the question of an independent supply of  cheap potash is still unsolved.          IV    COAL-TAR COLORS      If you put a bit of soft coal into a test tube (or, if you haven't a  test tube, into a clay tobacco pipe and lute it over with clay) and heat  it you will find a gas coming out of the end of the tube that will burn  with a yellow smoky flame. After all the gas comes off you will find in  the bottom of the test tube a chunk of dry, porous coke. These, then,  are the two main products of the destructive distillation of coal. But  if you are an unusually observant person, that is, if you"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17160"],[0,"Modern Prose And Poetry; For Secondary Schools (#11)"],[1,"will put white sheets on the bed in the  alcove.    [_Exit Madame. The Bishop turns to Jean._]    We shall dine presently. Sit here by the fire, sir.    JEAN. What! You will keep me? You call me \"sir\"! Oh! I am going  to dine! I am to have a bed with sheets like the rest of the world--a  bed! It is nineteen years since I have slept in a bed! I will pay  anything you ask. You are a fine man. You are an innkeeper, are you not?    BISHOP. I am a priest who lives here.    JEAN. A priest! Ah, yes--I ask your pardon--I didn't notice  your cap and gown.    BISHOP. Be seated near the fire, sir.    [_Jean deposits his knapsack, repeating to himself with delight._]    JEAN. He calls me _sir_--_sir_. (_Aloud._) You will require me  to pay, will you not?    BISHOP. No, keep your money. How much have you?    JEAN. One hundred and nine francs.    BISHOP. How long did it take you to earn it?    JEAN. Nineteen years.    BISHOP (_sadly_). Nineteen years--the best part of your life!    JEAN. Aye, the best part--I am now forty-six. A beast of burden  would have earned more.    BISHOP. This lamp gives a very bad light, sister.    [_Mlle. gets the two silver candlesticks from the mantel, lights them,  and places them on the table._]    JEAN. Ah, but you are good! You don't despise me. You light  your candles for me,--you treat me as a guest,--and I've told you where  I come from, who I am!    BISHOP. This house does not demand of him who enters whether he  has a name, but whether he has a grief. You suffer--you are hungry--you  are welcome.    JEAN. I cannot understand it--    BISHOP. This house is home to the man who needs a refuge. So,  sir, this is your house now more than it is mine. Whatever is here is  yours. What need have I to know your name? Besides, before you told me,  I knew it.    JEAN. What! You knew my name!    BISHOP. Yes, your name is--Brother.    JEAN. Stop! I cannot bear it--you are so good--    [_He buries his face in his hands._]    [_Enter_ MADAME _with dishes for the table; she continues  passing in and out, preparing supper._]    BISHOP. You have suffered much, sir--    JEAN (_nodding_). The red shirt, the ball on the ankle, a plank  to sleep on, heat, cold, toil, the whip, the double chain for nothing,  the cell for one word--even when sick in bed, still the chain! Dogs,  dogs are happier! Nineteen years! and now the yellow passport!    BISHOP. Yes, you have suffered.    JEAN (_with violence_). I hate this world of laws and courts! I  hate the men who rule it! For nineteen years my soul has had only  thoughts of hate. For nineteen years I've planned revenge. Do you hear?  Revenge--revenge!    BISHOP. It is not strange that you should feel so. And if you  continue to harbor those thoughts, you are only deserving of pity. But  listen, my brother; if, in spite of all you have passed through, your  thoughts could be of peace and love, you would be better than any one of  us.    [_Pause. Jean reflects._]    JEAN (_speaking violently_). No, no! I do not belong to your  world of men. I am apart--a different creature from you all. The galleys  made me different. I'll have nothing to do with any of you!    MADAME. The supper, your Reverence.    [_The Bishop glances at the table_.]    BISHOP. It strikes me there is something missing from this  table.    [_Madame hesitates._]    MLLE. Madame, do you not understand?    [_Madame steps to a cupboard, gets the remaining silver plates, and  places them on the table._]    BISHOP (_gayly, turning to Jean_). To table then, my friend! To  table!    [_Jean remains for a moment, standing doggedly apart; then he steps over  to the chair awaiting him, jerks it back, and sinks into it, without  looking up._]      SCENE III    TIME: _Daybreak the next morning._    PLACE: _The Bishop's dining room._           *       *       *       *       *    [_The room is dark, except for a faint light that comes in through  window curtains._ JEAN VALJEAN _creeps in from the alcove. He  carries his knapsack and cudgel in one hand; in the other, his shoes. He  opens the window overlooking the garden; the room becomes lighter. Jean  steps to the mantel and lifts a silver candlestick._]    JEAN (_whispering_). Two hundred francs--double what I have  earned in nineteen years!    [_He puts it in his knapsack; takes up the other candlestick; shudders,  and sets it down again._]    No, no, he is good--he called me \"sir\"--    [_He stands still, staring before him, his hand still gripping the  candlestick. Suddenly he straightens up; speaks bitterly._]    Why not? 'Tis easy to give a bed and food! Why doesn't he keep men from  the galleys? Nineteen years for a loaf of bread!    [_Pauses a moment, then resolutely puts both candlesticks into his bag;  steps to the cupboard and takes out the silver plates and the ladle, and  slips them into the bag._]    All solid--I should gain at least one thousand francs. 'Tis due me--due  me for all these years!    [_Closes the bag. Pause._]    No, not the candles--I owe him that much--    [_He puts the candlesticks on mantel; takes up cudgel, knapsack, and  shoes; jumps out window and disappears. Pause._]    [_Enter_ MADAME. _She shivers; discovers the open window._]    MADAME. Why is that window open? I closed it last night myself.  Oh! Could it be possible?    [_Crosses and looks at open cupboard._]    It is gone!    [_Enter the_ BISHOP _from his room._]    BISHOP. Good morning, Madame!    MADAME. Your Reverence! The silver is gone! Where is that man?    BISHOP. In the alcove sleeping, I suppose.    [_Madame runs to curtains of alcove and looks in. Enter_  MADEMOISELLE. _Madame turns._]    He is gone!    MLLE. Gone?    MADAME. Aye, gone--gone! He has stolen our silver, the  beautiful plates and the ladle! I'll inform the police at once!    [_Starts off. The Bishop stops her._]    BISHOP. Wait!--Let me ask you this--was that silver ours?    MADAME. Why--why not?    BISHOP. Because it has always belonged to the poor. I have  withheld it wrongfully.    MLLE. Its loss makes no difference to Madame or me.    MADAME. Oh, no! But what is your Reverence to eat from now?    BISHOP. Are there no pewter plates?    MADAME. Pewter has an odor.    BISHOP. Iron ones, then.    MADAME. Iron has a taste.    BISHOP. Well, then, wooden plates.    [_A knock is heard at street door._]    Come in.    [_Enter an_ OFFICER _and two_ SOLDIERS, _dragging in_  JEAN VALJEAN.]    OFFICER. Your Reverence, we found your silver on this man.    BISHOP. Why not? I gave it to him. I am glad to see you again,  Jean. Why did you not take the candlesticks, too?    JEAN (_trembling_). Your Reverence--    BISHOP. I told you everything in this house was yours, my  brother.    OFFICER. Ah, then what he said was true. But, of course, we did  not believe him. We saw him creeping from your garden--    BISHOP. It is all right, I assure you. This man is a friend of  mine.    OFFICER. Then we can let him go?    BISHOP. Certainly.    [_Soldiers step back._]    JEAN (_trembling_). I am free?    OFFICER. Yes! You can go. Do you not understand?    [_Steps back._]    BISHOP (_to Jean_). My friend, before you go away--here are  your candlesticks (_going to the mantel and bringing the candlesticks_);  take them.    [_Jean takes the candlesticks, seeming not to know what he is doing._]    By the way, my friend, when you come again you need not come through the  garden. The front door is closed only with a latch, day or night. (_To  the Officer and Soldiers._) Gentlemen, you may withdraw.    [_Exit Officer and Soldiers._]    JEAN (_recoiling and holding out the candlesticks_).  No--no--I--I--    BISHOP. Say no more; I understand. You felt that they were all  owing to you from a world that had used you ill. Keep them, my friend,  keep them. I would I had more to give you. It is small recompense for  nineteen years.    [_Jean stands bewildered, looking down at the candlesticks in his  hands._]    They will add something to your hundred francs. But do not forget, never  forget, that you have promised to use the money in becoming an honest  man.    JEAN. I--promised--?    BISHOP (_not heeding_). Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer  belong to evil, but to good. It is your soul that I am buying for you: I  withdraw it from thoughts of hatred and revenge--I give it to peace and  hope and God.    [_Jean stands as if stunned, staring at the Bishop, then turns and walks  unsteadily from the room._]      SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY    Jean Valjean, as a young man, was sent to the galleys for stealing a  loaf of bread to feed his sister's hungry children. From time to time,  when he tried to escape, his sentence was increased, so that he spent  nineteen years as a convict. Scene I of Miss Stevenson's dramatization  shows Jean Valjean being turned away from the inn because he has been in  prison.    What does the stage setting tell of the Bishop and his sister? Notice,  as you read, why each of the items in the stage setting is mentioned.  Why is Madame made to leave the room--how does her absence help the  action of the play? What is the purpose of the conversation about the  weather? About the carriage hire? Why is the Bishop not more excited at  Madame's news? What is gained by the talk about the silver? Notice the  dramatic value of the Bishop's speech beginning \"Stay!\" Why does Jean  Valjean speak so roughly when he enters? Why does he not try to conceal  the fact that he is a convict? Why does not the Bishop reply directly to  Jean Valjean's question? What would be the action of Mademoiselle and  Madame while Jean is speaking? What is Madame's action as she goes out?  What is gained by the conversation between Jean and the Bishop? Why does  the Bishop not reproach Jean for saying he will have revenge? Why is the  silver mentioned so many times?    While you are reading the first part of Scene III, think how it should  be played. Note how much the stage directions add to the clearness of  the scene. How long should the pause be,"]]]
