I think the Crown Prince is one of his  backers, but I have never been able to prove it.\"      On July 4th, 1915, the League of Truth issued what it called \"A New  Declaration of Independence.\"  This was circulated in German and  English throughout the country.  It was as follows:         *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *    A NEW DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE    Seven score years have elapsed since those great words were forged that  welded us into a nation upon many fiery battlefields.    In that day the strong voices of strong men rang across the world,  their molten words flamed with light and their arms broke the visible  chains of an intolerable bondage.    But now in the red reflex of the glare cast from the battlefields of  Europe, the invisible manacles that have been cunningly laid upon our  freedom have become shamefully apparent.  They rattle in the ears of  the world.    Our liberty has vanished once again.  Yet our ancient enemy remains  enthroned in high places within our land and in insolent ships before  our gates.  We have not only become Colonials once again, but  subjects,--for true subjects are known by the measure of their willing  subjection.    We Americans in the heart of this heroic nation now struggling for all  that we ourselves hold dear, but against odds such as we were never  forced to face, perceive this truth with a disheartening but unclouded  vision.    Far from home we would to-day celebrate, as usual, the birthday of our  land.  But with heavy hearts we see that this would now seem like a  hollow mockery of something solemn and immemorial.  It were more in  keeping with reality that we burnt incense upon the altars of the  British Baal.    Independence Day without Independence!  The liberty of the seas denied  us for the peaceful Commerce of our entire land and granted us only for  the murderous trafficking of a few men!    Independence Day has dawned for us in alien yet friendly land.  It has  brought to us at least the independence of our minds.    Free from the abominations of the most dastardly campaign of falsehood  that ever disgraced those who began and those who believe it, we have  stripped ourselves of the rags of many perilous illusions.  We see  America as a whole, and we see it with a fatal and terrible clarity.    We see that once again our liberties of thought, of speech, of  intercourse, of trade, are threatened, nay, already seized by the one  ancient enemy that can never be our friend.    With humiliation we behold our principles, our sense of justice trodden  underfoot.  We see the wild straining of the felon arms that would drag  our land into the abyss of the giant Conspiracy and Crime.    We see the foul alliance of gold, murderous iron and debauched paper to  which we have been sold.    We know that our pretenses and ambitions as heralds of peace are  monstrous, so long as we profit through war and human agony.    We see these rivers of blood that have their source in our mills of  slaughter.    The Day of Independence has dawned.    It is a solemn and momentous hour for America,    It is a day on which our people must speak with clear and inexorable  voice, or sit silent in shame.    It is the great hour in which we dare not celebrate our first  Declaration of Independence, because the time has come when we must  proclaim a new one over the corpse of that which has perished.    Berlin, July 4th, 1915.    AN ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA DOCUMENT         *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *    The League of Truth, however, was but one branch of the intricate  propaganda system.  While it was financed almost entirely by  German-Americans living in Germany who retained their American  passports to keep themselves, or their children, out of the army, all  publications for this bureau were approved by the Foreign Office  censors.  Germans, connected with the organisation, were under  direction of the General Staff or Navy.    In order to have the propaganda really successful some seeds of  discontent had to be sown in the United States, in South America and  Mexico as well as in Spain and other European neutral countries.  For  this outside propaganda, money and an organisation were needed.  The  Krupp ammunition interests supplied the money and the Foreign Office  the organisation.    For nearly two years the American press regularly printed despatches  from the Overseas News Agency.   Some believed they were \"official.\"  This was only half true.  The Krupps had been financing this news  association.  The government had given its support and the two wireless  towers at Sayville, Long Island, and Tuckerton, N. J., were used as  \"footholds\" on American soil.  These stations were just as much a part  of the Krupp works as the factories at Essen or the shipyards of Kiel.  They were to disseminate the Krupp-fed, Krupp-owned, Krupp-controlled  news, of the Overseas News Agency.    When the Overseas despatches first reached the United States the  newspapers printed them in a spirit of fairness.  They gave the other  side, and in the beginning they were more or less accurate.  But when  international relations between the two countries became critical the  news began to be distorted in Berlin.  At each crisis, as at the time  of the sinking of the _Arabic_, the _Ancona_, the _Sussex_ and other  ships, the German censorship prevented the American correspondents from  sending the news as they gathered it in Germany and substituted \"news\"  which the Krupp interests and the Imperial Foreign Office desired the  American people to believe.  December, 1916, when the German General  Staff began to plan for an unrestricted submarine warfare, especial use  was made of the \"Overseas News Agency\" to work up sentiment here  against President Wilson.  Desperate efforts were made to keep the  United States from breaking diplomatic relations.  In December and  January last records of the news despatches in the American newspapers  from Berlin show that the Overseas agency was more active than all  American correspondents in Berlin.  Secretary of State Zimmermann,  Under-secretaries von dem Busche and von Stumm gave frequent interviews  to the so-called \"representatives of the Overseas News Agency.\"  It was  all part of a specific Krupp plan, supported by the Hamburg-American  and the North German Lloyd steamship companies, to divide opinion in  the United States so that President Wilson would not be supported if he  broke diplomatic relations.    Germany, as I have pointed out, has been conducting a two-faced  propaganda.  While working in the United States through her agents and  reservists to create the impression that Germany was friendly, the  Government laboured to prepare the German people for war.  The policy  was to make the American people believe Germany would never do anything  to bring the United States into the war, but to convince the German  public that America was not neutral and that President Wilson was  scheming against the German race.  Germany was Janus-headed.  Head  No. 1 said:      \"America, you are a great nation.  We want your friendship and  neutrality.  We have close business and blood relations, and these  should not be broken.  Germany is not the barbaric nation her enemies  picture her.\"      Head No. 2, turned toward the German people, said:      \"Germans, President Wilson is anti-German.  He wants to prevent us from  starting an unlimited submarine war.  America has never been neutral,  because Washington permits the ammunition factories to supply the  Allies.  These factories are killing your relatives.  We have millions  of German-Americans who will support us.  It will not be long until  Mexico will declare war on the United States, and our reservists will  fight for Mexico.  Don't be afraid if Wilson breaks diplomatic  relations.\"      The German press invasion of America began at the beginning of the war.  Dr. Dernburg was the first envoy.  He was sent to New York by the same  Foreign Office officials and the same Krupp interests which control the  Overseas agency.  Having failed here, he returned to Berlin.  There was  only one thing to save German propaganda in America.  That was to  mobolise the Sayville and Tuckerton wireless stations, and Germany did  it immediately.    At the beginning of the war, when the British censors refused the  American correspondents in Germany the right of telegraphing to the  United States via England, the Berlin Government granted permission to  the United Press, The Associated Press and the _Chicago Daily News_ to  send wireless news via Sayville.  At first this news was edited by the  correspondents of these associations and newspapers in Berlin.  Later,  when the individual correspondents began to demand more space on the  wireless, the news sent jointly to these papers was cut down.  This  unofficial league of American papers was called the \"War-Union.\"  The  news which this union sent was German, but it was written by trained  American writers.  When the Government saw the value of this service to  the United States it began to send wireless news of its own.  Then the  Krupp interests appeared, and the Overseas News Agency was organised.  At that moment the Krupp invasion of the United States began and  contributed 800,000 marks annually to this branch of propaganda alone.    Dr. Hammann, for ten years chief of the Berlin Foreign Office  propaganda department, was selected as president of the Overseas News  Agency.  The Krupp interests, which had been subscribing 400,000 marks  annually to this agency, subscribed the same amount to the reorganised  company.  Then, believing that another agency could be organised,  subscribed 400,000 marks more to the Transocean News Agency.  Because  there was so much bitterness and rivalry between the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15777"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World, Volume 1 (#11)"],[1,"distinguishable only by  naturalists. Some of the peterels were of the blue sort, but differed from  those before-mentioned, in not having a broad bill; and the ends of their  tail feathers were tipped with white instead of dark-blue. But whether  these were only the distinctions betwixt the male and female, was a matter  disputed by our naturalists. We were now in the latitude of 58 deg. 19' S.,  longitude 24 deg. 39' E., and took the opportunity of the calm, to sound; but  found no ground with a line of 220 fathoms. The calm continued till six in  the evening, when it was succeeded by a light breeze from the east, which  afterwards increased to a fresh gale.    In the morning of the 28th I made the signal to the Adventure to spread  four miles on my starboard beam; and in this position we continued sailing  W.S.W., until four o'clock in the afternoon, when the hazy weather,  attended with snow showers, made it necessary for us to join. Soon after we  reefed our top-sails, being surrounded on all sides with islands of ice. In  the morning of the 29th we let them out again, and set top-gallant-sails;  still continuing our course to the westward, and meeting with several  penguins. At noon we were by observation in the latitude of 59 deg. 12',  longitude 19 deg. 1' E., which is 3 deg. more to the west than we were when we  first fell in with the field of ice; so that it is pretty clear that it  joined to no land, as we conjectured.    Having come to a resolution to run as far west as the meridian of Cape  Circumcision, provided we met with no impediment, as the distance was not  more than eighty leagues, the wind favourable, and the sea seemed to be  pretty clear of ice, I sent on board for Captain Furneaux, to make him  acquainted therewith, and after dinner he returned to his ship. At one  o'clock we steered for an island of ice, thinking if there were any loose  ice round it, to take some on board, and convert it into fresh water. At  four we brought-to, close under the lee of the island, where we did not  find what we wanted, but saw upon it eighty-six penguins. This piece of ice  was about half a mile in circuit, and one hundred feet high and upwards,  for we lay for some minutes with every sail becalmed under it. The side on  which the penguins were, rose sloping from the sea, so as to admit them to  creep up it.    It is a received opinion, that penguins never go far from land, and that  the sight of them is a sure indication of its vicinity. The opinion may  hold good where there are no ice islands; but where such are, these birds,  as well as many others which usually keep near the shores, finding a  roosting-place upon these islands, may be brought by them a great distance  from any land. It will, however, be said, that they must go on shore to  breed, that probably the females were there, and that these are only the  males which we saw. Be this as it may, I shall continue to take notice of  these birds whenever we see them, and leave every one to judge for himself.    We continued our course to the westward, with a gentle gale at E.N.E., the  weather being sometimes tolerably clear, and at other times thick and hazy,  with snow. The thermometer for a few days past was from 31 to 36. At nine  o'clock the next morning, being the 30th, we shot one of the white birds,  upon which we lowered a boat into the water to take it up, and by that  means killed a penguin which weighed eleven pounds and a half. The white  bird was of the peterel tribe; the bill, which is rather short, is of a  colour between black and dark blue, and their legs and feet are blue. I  believe them to be the same sort of birds that Bouvet mentions to have seen  when he was off Cape Circumcision.    We continued our westerly course till eight o'clock in the evening, when we  steered N.W., the point on which I reckoned the above-mentioned cape to  bear. At midnight we fell in with loose ice, which soon after obliged us to  tack, and stretch to the southward. At half an hour past two o'clock in the  morning of the 31st, we stood for it again, thinking to take some on board,  but this was found impracticable; for the wind, which had been at N.E, now  veered to S.E., and increasing to a fresh gale, brought with it such a sea  as made it very dangerous for the ships to remain among the ice. The danger  was yet farther increased by discovering an immense field to the north,  extending from N.E. by E. to S.W. by W. farther than the eye could reach.  As we were not above two or three miles from this, and surrounded by loose  ice, there was no time to deliberate. We presently wore; got our tacks on  board; hauled to the south, and soon got clear; but not before we had  received several hard knocks from the loose pieces, which were of the  largest sort, and among which we saw a seal. In the afternoon the wind  increased in such a manner, as to oblige us to hand the top-sails, and  strike top-gallant-yards. At eight o'clock we tacked and stood to the east  till midnight; when being in the latitude of 60 deg. 21' S., longitude 13 deg. 32'  E, we stood again to the west.    1773 January    Next day, towards noon, the gale abated, so that we could carry close-  reefed top-sails. But the weather continued thick and hazy, with sleet and  snow, which froze on the rigging as it fell, and ornamented the whole with  icicles; the mercury in the thermometer being generally below the freezing  point. This weather continued till near noon the next day; at which time we  were in the latitude of 59 deg. 12' S.; longitude 9 deg. 45' E.; and here we saw  some penguins.    The wind had now veered to the west, and was so moderate, that we could  bear two reefs out of the top-sails. In the afternoon, we were favoured  with a sight of the moon, whose face we had seen but once since we left the  Cape of Good Hope. By this a judgment may be formed of the sort of weather  we had since we left that place. We did not fail to seize the opportunity  to make several observations of the sun and moon. The longitude deduced  from it was 9 deg. 34' 30\" E. Mr Kendal's watch, at the same time, giving 10 deg.  6' E., and the latitude was 58 deg. 53' 30\" S.    This longitude is nearly the same that is assigned to Cape Circumcision;  and at the going down of the sun we were about ninety-five leagues to the  south of the latitude it is said to lie in. At this time the weather was so  clear, that we might have seen land at fourteen or fifteen leagues  distance. It is, therefore very probable, that what Bouvet took for land,  was nothing but mountains of ice, surrounded by loose or field-ice. We  ourselves were undoubtedly deceived by the ice-hills, the day we first fell  in with the field-ice. Nor was it an improbable conjecture, that that ice  joined to land. The probability was however now greatly lessened, if not  entirely set aside; for the space between the northern edge of the ice,  along which we sailed, and our route to the west, when south of it, no  where exceeded 100 leagues, and in some places not 60. The clear weather  continued no longer than three o'clock the next morning, when it was  succeeded by a thick fog, sleet, and snow. The wind also veered to N.E. and  blew a fresh gale, with which we stood to S.E. It increased in such a  manner, that before noon we were brought under close-reefed top-sails. The  wind continued to veer to the north, at last fixed at N.W., and was  attended with intervals of clear weather.    Our course was E. 1/4 N., till noon the next day, when we were in the  latitude of 59 deg. 2' S., and nearly under the same meridian as we were when  we fell in with the last field of ice, five days before; so that had it  remained in the same situation, we must now have been in the middle of it,  whereas we did not so much as see any. We cannot suppose that so large a  float of ice as this was, could be destroyed in so short a time. It  therefore must have drifted to the northward: and this makes it probable  that there is no land under this meridian, between the latitude of 55 deg. and  59 deg., where we had supposed some to lie, as mentioned above.    As we were now only sailing over a part of the sea where we had been  before, I directed the course E.S.E. in order to get more to the south. We  had the advantage of a fresh gale, and the disadvantage of a thick fog;  much snow and sleet, which, as usual, froze on our rigging as it fell; so  that every rope was covered with the finest transparent ice I ever saw.  This afforded an agreeable sight enough to the eye, but conveyed to the  mind an idea of coldness, much greater than it really was; for the weather  was rather milder then it had been for some time past, and the sea less  encumbered with ice. But the worst was, the ice so clogged the rigging,  sails, and blocks, as to make them exceedingly bad to handle. Our people,  however, surmounted those difficulties with a steady perseverance, and  withstood this intense cold much better than I expected.    We continued to steer to the E.S.E. with a fresh gale at N.W. attended with  snow and sleet, till the 8th, when we were in the latitude of 61 deg. 12' S.,  longitude 31 deg. 47' E. In the afternoon we passed more ice islands than we  had seen for several days. Indeed they were now so familiar to us, that  they were often passed unnoticed; but more generally unseen on account of  the thick weather. At nine o'clock in the evening, we came to one, which  had a quantity of loose ice about it. As the wind was moderate, and the  weather tolerably fair, we shortened sail, and stood on and off, with a  view of taking some on board on the return of light. But at four o'clock in  the morning, finding ourselves to leeward of this ice, we bore down to an  island to leeward of us; there being about it some loose ice, part of which  we saw break off. There we brought-to; hoisted out three boats; and in  about five or six hours, took up as much ice as yielded"]]]
