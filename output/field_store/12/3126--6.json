I was only allowed a limited time for  this favourite recreation, and it became an occasion of much  self-sacrifice, for as soon as the time had elapsed I made it my  duty to stop instantly, even in the middle of a most interesting  passage.    As to the impressions produced on me by these books, I must  frankly own that, in reading certain tales of chivalry, I did not  always understand the realities of life. And so, in my admiration  of the patriotic deeds of the heroines of France, especially of  the Venerable Joan of Arc, I longed to do what they had done.  About this time I received what I have looked on as one of the  greatest graces of my life, for, at that age, I was not favoured  with lights from Heaven, as I am now.    Our Lord made me understand that the only true glory is that which  lasts for ever; and that to attain it there is no necessity to do  brilliant deeds, but rather to hide from the eyes of others, and  even from oneself, so that \"the left hand knows not what the right  hand does.\"[1] Then, as I reflected that I was born for great  things, and sought the means to attain them, it was made known to  me interiorly that my personal glory would never reveal itself  before the eyes of men, but that it would consist in becoming a  Saint.    This aspiration may very well appear rash, seeing how imperfect I  was, and am, even now, after so many years of religious life; yet  I still feel the same daring confidence that one day I shall  become a great Saint. I am not trusting in my own merits, for I  have none; but I trust in Him Who is Virtue and Holiness itself.  It is He alone Who, pleased with my feeble efforts, will raise me  to Himself, and, by clothing me with His merits, make me a Saint.  At that time I did not realise that to become one it is necessary  to suffer a great deal; but God soon disclosed this secret to me  by means of the trials I have related.    I must now continue my story where I left off. Three months after  my cure Papa took me away for a change. It was a very pleasant  time, and I began to see something of the world. All around me was  joy and gladness; I was petted, made much of, admired--in fact,  for a whole fortnight my path was strewn with flowers. The Wise  Man is right when he says: \"The bewitching of vanity overturneth  the innocent mind.\"[2] At ten years of age the heart is easily  fascinated, and I confess that in my case this kind of life had  its charms. Alas! the world knows well how to combine its  pleasures with the service of God. How little it thinks of death!  And yet death has come to many people I knew then, young, rich,  and happy. I recall to mind the delightful places where they  lived, and ask myself where they are now, and what profit they  derive to-day from the beautiful houses and grounds where I saw  them enjoying all the good things of this life, and I reflect that  \"All is vanity besides loving God and serving Him alone.\"[3]    Perhaps Our Lord wished me to know something of the world before  He paid His first visit to my soul, so that I might choose more  deliberately the way in which I was to follow Him.    I shall always remember my First Communion Day as one of unclouded  happiness. It seems to me that I could not have been better  prepared. Do you remember, dear Mother, the charming little book  you gave me three months before the great day? I found in it a  helpful method which prepared me gradually and thoroughly. It is  true I had been thinking about my First Communion for a long time,  but, as your precious manuscript told me, I must stir up in my  heart fresh transports of love and fill it anew with flowers. So,  each day I made a number of little sacrifices and acts of love,  which were to be changed into so many flowers: now violets,  another time roses, then cornflowers, daisies, or  forget-me-nots--in a word, all nature's blossoms were to form in  me a cradle for the Holy Child.    I had Marie, too, who took Pauline's place. Every evening I spent  a long time with her, listening eagerly to all she said. How  delightfully she talked to me! I felt myself set on fire by her  noble, generous spirit. As the warriors of old trained their  children in the profession of arms, so she trained me for the  battle of life, and roused my ardour by pointing to the victor's  glorious palm. She spoke, too, of the imperishable riches which  are so easy to amass each day, and of the folly of trampling them  under foot when one has but to stoop and gather them. When she  talked so eloquently, I was sorry that I was the only one to  listen to her teaching, for, in my simplicity, it seemed to me  that the greatest sinners would be converted if they but heard  her, and that, forsaking the perishable riches of this world, they  would seek none but the riches of Heaven.    I should have liked at this time to practise mental prayer, but  Marie, finding me sufficiently devout, only let me say my vocal  prayers. A mistress at the Abbey asked me once what I did on  holidays, when I stayed at home. I answered timidly: \"I often hide  myself in a corner of my room where I can shut myself in with the  bed curtains, and then I think.\" \"But what do you think about?\"  said the good nun, laughing. \"I think about the Good God, about  the shortness of life, and about eternity: in a word, I _think.\"_  My mistress did not forget this, and later on she used to remind  me of the time when I thought, asking me if I still _thought._  . . . Now, I know that I was really praying, while my Divine  Master  gently instructed me.    The three months' preparation for First Communion passed quickly  by; it was soon time for me to begin my retreat, and, during it, I  stayed at the Abbey. Oh, what a blessed retreat it was! I do not  think that one can experience such joy except in a religious  house; there, with only a few children, it is easy for each one to  receive special attention. I write this in a spirit of filial  gratitude; our mistresses at the Abbey showed us a true motherly  affection. I do not know why, but I saw plainly that they watched  over me more carefully than they did over the others.    Every night the first mistress, carrying her little lamp, opened  my bed curtains softly, and kissed me tenderly on the forehead.  She showed me such affection that, touched by her kindness, I said  one night: \"Mother, I love you so much that I am going to tell you  a great secret.\" Then I took from under my pillow the precious  little book you had given me, and showed it to her, my eyes  sparkling with pleasure. She opened it with care, and, looking  through it attentively, told me how privileged I was. In fact,  several times during the retreat, the truth came home to me that  very few motherless children of my age are as lovingly cared for as I  was then. I listened most attentively to the instructions given us by  Father Domin, and wrote careful notes on them, but I did not put down  any of my own thoughts, as I knew I should remember them quite well. And  so it proved.    How happy I was to attend Divine Office as the nuns did! I was  easily distinguished from my companions by a large crucifix, which  Leonie had given me, and which, like the missionaries, I carried  in my belt. They thought I was trying to imitate my Carmelite  sister, and indeed my thoughts did often turn lovingly to her. I  knew she was in retreat too, not that Jesus might give Himself to  her, but that she might give herself entirely to Jesus, and this  on the same day as I made my First Communion. The time of quiet  waiting was therefore doubly dear to me.    At last there dawned the most beautiful day of all the days of my  life. How perfectly I remember even the smallest details of those  sacred hours! the joyful awakening, the reverent and tender  embraces of my mistresses and older companions, the room filled  with snow-white frocks, where each child was dressed in turn, and,  above all, our entrance into the chapel and the melody of the  morning hymn: \"O Altar of God, where the Angels are hovering.\"    But I would not and I could not tell you all. Some things lose  their fragrance when exposed to the air, and so, too, one's inmost  thoughts cannot be translated into earthly words without instantly  losing their deep and heavenly meaning. How sweet was the first  embrace of Jesus! It was indeed an embrace of love. I felt that I  was loved, and I said: \"I love Thee, and I give myself to Thee for  ever.\" Jesus asked nothing of me, and claimed no sacrifice; for a  long time He and little Therese had known and understood one  another. That day our meeting was more than simple recognition, it  was perfect union. We were no longer two. Therese had disappeared  like a drop of water lost in the immensity of the ocean; Jesus  alone remained--He was the Master, the King! Had not Therese asked  Him to take away her liberty which frightened her? She felt  herself so weak and frail, that she wished to be for ever united  to the Divine Strength.    And then my joy became so intense, so deep, that it could not be  restrained; tears of happiness welled up and overflowed. My  companions were astonished, and asked each other afterwards: \"Why  did she cry? Had she anything on her conscience? No, it is because  neither her Mother nor her dearly loved Carmelite sister is here.\"  And no one understood that all the joy of Heaven had come down  into one heart, and that this heart, exiled, weak, and mortal as  it was, could not contain it without tears.    How could my Mother's absence grieve me on my First Communion Day?  As Heaven itself dwelt in my soul, in receiving a visit from Our  Divine Lord I received one from my dear Mother too. Nor was I  crying on account of Pauline's absence, for we were even more  closely united than before. No, I repeat it--joy alone, a joy too  deep for words, overflowed within me.    During "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/168"],[0,"The History and Practice of the Art of Photography (#11)"],[1,"ons, called accelerating liquids, quickstuff, &c.,  are used, and the discovery of which has alone ensured the application  of the Daguerreotype successfully to portrait taking--for when first  introduced among us it took from five to ten minutes to produce a  tolerable good view, while now but the fraction of a minute is required  to obtain an accurate likeness.    To iodize the plate perfectly it must be placed over the iodine vapor  immediately after buffing.  Scatter from a sixteenth to the eighth of  an ounce of dry iodine over the bottom of your coating box, and  slightly cover it with cotton wool.  The plate is then dropped into the  frame b, fig. 12, with its silvered surface downward, and thrust under  the lid h.  The bright surface of the plate is soon coated with a film  of iodine of a fine yellow color; it is then removed and placed over  the accelerating solution.  It is not absolutely necessary to perform  this operation in the dark, although a bright light should be avoided.  Not so the next part of the process, viz; giving the plate its extreme  sensitiveness, or coating with the accelerating liquids.  In this great  caution should be used to prevent the slightest ray of light impringing  directly on the plate, and in examining the color reflected light  should always be used.  A convenient method of examining the plate, is  to make a small hole in the partition of the closet in which you coat,  and cover it with a piece of tissue paper; by quickly turning the plate  so that the paper is reflected upon it the color is very distinctly  shown.  Most of our operators are not so particular in this respect as  they should be.    ACCELERATING LIQUID.--Of these there are several kinds, which differ  both in composition and action--some acting very quickly, others giving  a finer tone to the picture although they are not so expeditious in  there operations; or in other words, not so sensitive to the action of  light.  These are adopted by Daguerreotypists according to their tastes  and prejudices.  They are all applied in the same way as the coating of  iodine.  The following are the best.    Bromine water--This solution is much used in France, and, I shall  therefore give its preparation, and the method of using it, in the  words of M. Figeau.  \"Put into a bottle of pure water, a large excess  of bromine; shake the mixture well, and before using it, let all the  bromine be taken up.  An ascertained quantity of this saturated water  is then diluted in a given quantity of distilled water, which gives a  solution of bromine that is always identical.\" M. Figeau recommends one  part of the saturated solution to thirty parts its bulk of water; but  M. Lesebour finds it more manageable if diluted with forty times.  In  case pure distilled, or rain water cannot be procured, a few drops of  nitric acid--say six to the quart--should be added to the common water.    Put into the bromine box a given quantity of this solution, sufficient  to well cover the bottom; the plate, having been iodized to a deep  yellow, is placed over it; the time the plate should be exposed must be  ascertained by making a few trials; it averages from twelve to forty  seconds.  When once ascertained, it is the same for any number of  plates, as the solution, which of course would become weaker and  weaker, is changed after every operation, the same quantity being  always put into the pot.    Chloride of Iodine.--This is prepared by introducing chlorine gass into  a glass vessel containing iodine; the iodine is liquified, and the  above named compound is the result.  Operators need not, however, be at  the trouble and expense of preparing it, as it can be obtained  perfectly pure of Mr. Anthony, 205 Broadway, N. Y., as also all of the  chemicals herein enumerated.  The compound is diluted with distilled  water, and the plate submitted to its action till it is of a rose  color.  Chloride of iodine alone, is seldom if ever used now by  American operators, as it does not sufficiently come up to their  locomotive principle of progression.  The next is also eschewed by the  majority, although many of our best artists use no other, on account of  the very fine tone it gives to pictures.    Bromide of Iodine.--This is a compound of bromine and chloride of  iodine.  In mixing it, much depends upon the strength of the  ingredients; an equal portion of each being generally used.  Perhaps  the best method of preparing it, is to make a solution in alcohol of  half an ounce of chloride of iodine, and add the bromine drop by drop,  until the mixture becomes of a dark red color; then dilute with  distilled water, till it assumes a bright yellow.  Put about half an  ounce of this compound into the pot, and coat over it to a violet  color, change the solution when it becomes too weak to produce the  desired effect.    Another.--Mix half an ounce of bromine with one ounce of chloride of  iodine, add two quarts pure distilled water, shake it well and let it  stand for twelve hours then add twenty-five drops of muriatic acid, and  let it stand another twelve hours, occasionally shaking it up well.  Dilute six parts of this solution in sixteen of water.  Coat over dry  iodine to a deep yellow, then over the sensitive to a deep rose  color--approaching purple--then back, over dry iodine from four to  eight seconds.    Roach's Tripple Compound.--This is one of the very best sensitive  solutions, and is very popular among Daguerreotypists.  To use this,  take one part in weight, say one drachm, of the compound and dilute it  with twelve of water; coat over dry iodine to yellow, then over the  compound to a rosy red.  The effect in the camera is quick, and  produces a picture of a fine white tone.    Gurney's Sensitive.--This is another preparation of bromine, and gives  a fine tone.  To two parts of water add one of the sensitive, and put  just sufficient in the box to cover the bottom, or enable you to coat  in from eight to ten seconds.  Coat over dry iodine to a dark yellow,  and over the quick till you see a good change, then back over the dry  iodine from two to three seconds.    Bromide of Lime, or Dry Sensitive.--This is a compound but recently  introduced, and is becoming somewhat of it favorite, owing principally  to the slight trouble it gives in its preparation, and the tone it  imparts to the picture.  To prepare it, fill your jar about half or  quarter full of dry slacked lime, then drop into it bromine, till it  becomes a bright orange red.  The plate is generally coated over this  compound, after the iodine coating to yellow, to a violet, or plum  color; but it will work well under any circumstances, the color being  of little consequence, if coated from thirty to ninety seconds,  according to its strength.    Mead's Accelerator.--I merely mention this as being in the market, not  knowing any thing in regard to its merits.  The directions given for  its use are as follows: Mix one-third of a bottle with a wine glass  full of water, coat the plate over dry iodine to a dark gold color,  then over the accelerator to a violet, then back over dry iodine, or  chloride of iodine, from three to five seconds.    Chloride of Bromine.--M. Bissou, a French experimentalist, has found  that bromine associated with chlorine, prepared in a similar manner to  chloride of iodine, already described, a solution of bromine being  substituted for the iodine, is a very sensitive solution; by means of  it daguerreotype proofs are obtained in half a second, and, thus very  fugitive subjects are represented, making it the very best compound for  taking children.  So quick is its operation, that even persons or  animals may be taken in the act of walking.    Hungarian Liquid.--This, I believe, has never been used here, or  imported into this country, and the composition of it is not generally  known, even in Europe, where it has taken precedence of all others.  It  acts quickly and with considerable certainty.  It is used by diluting  it with from ten to fifteen times its bulk of water, putting a  sufficient quantity into the jar to cover the bottom.  The plate being  previously iodized to a light yellow, is submitted to this mixture till  it assumes a light rose tint.    Bromine and Fluoric Acid, in combination, are used by some Daguerrean  artists as a sensitive, but any of the above compounds are better;  besides this, the fluoric acid is a dangerous poison, and the quick  made from it will not repay the risk to the health in using it.    As I have before said, great caution should be observed in examining  the color of the plate, even by the feeble light allowed, which, when  attained, must be immediately placed in the holder belonging to the  camera and covered with the dark slide.  You then pass to the    THIRD OPERATION.--Submitting the Plate to the action of Light in the  Camera.--Experience alone must guide the operator as to the time the  plate should be exposed to the influence of the light; this being  dependent on a variety of circumstances, as clearness of the  atmosphere--and here, a reference to the hygrometer will be of  advantage--time of day, object to be taken, and the degree of  sensitiveness imparted to the plate by the quickstuff.  As I have  before said, the artist should be careful to see that the interior of  the camera is clean and free from dust, as the small particles flying  about, or set in motion by the sliding of the holder into the box,  attach themselves to the plate, and cause the little black spots, by  which an otherwise good picture is frequently spoiled.  Care should  also be taken in withdrawing the dark slide, in front of the plate,  from the holder, as the same effect may be produced by a too hasty  movement.  The lens is the last thing to be uncovered, by withdrawing  the cap c. fig. 5., which should not be done until you have placed the  sitter in the most desirable position.  When, according to the judgment  and experience of "]]]
