The Nativity has become a subject for private contemplation,  for individual devotion, instead of, as in the later Middle Ages, a  matter for common jubilation, a wonder-story that really happened, in  which, all alike and all together, the serious and the frivolous could  rejoice, something that, with all its marvel, could be taken as a matter  of course, like the return of the seasons or the rising of the sun on the  just and on the unjust.    English Christmas poetry after the mid-sixteenth century is, then,  individual rather than communal in its spirit; it is also a thing less of  the people, more of the refined and cultivated few. The Puritanism which  so deeply affected English religion was abstract rather than dramatic in  its conception of Christianity, it was concerned less with the events of  the Saviour's life than with Redemption as a transaction between God and  man; St. Paul and the Old Testament rather than the gospels were its  inspiration. Moreover, the material was viewed not as penetrated by and  revealing the spiritual, but as sheer impediment blocking out the vision  of spiritual things. Hence the extremer Puritans were completely out of  touch with the sensuous poetry of Christmas, a festival which, as we  shall see, they actually suppressed when they came into power.    The singing of sacred carols by country people continued, indeed, but the  creative artistic impulse was lost. True carols after the Reformation  tend to be doggerel, and no doubt many of the traditional pieces printed  in such collections as Bramley and Stainer's[33]{37} are debased  survivals from the Middle Ages, or perhaps new words written for old  tunes. Such carols as \"God rest you merry, gentlemen,\" have unspeakably  delightful airs, and the words charm us moderns by their quaintness and  rusticity, but they are far from the exquisite loveliness of the  mediaeval |78| things. Gleams of great beauty are, however, sometimes  found amid matter that in the process of transmission has almost ceased  to be poetry. Here, for instance, are five stanzas from the traditional  \"Cherry-tree Carol\":--       \"As Joseph was a-walking,        He heard an angel sing:      'This night shall be born        Our heavenly King.        'He neither shall be born        In housen nor in hall,      Nor in the place of Paradise,        But in an ox's stall.        'He neither shall be clothed        In purple nor in pall,      But all in fair linen        As wear babies all.        'He neither shall be rocked        In silver nor in gold,      But in a wooden cradle        That rocks on the mould.        'He neither shall be christened        In white wine nor red,      But with fair spring water        With which we were christened.'\"    The old carols sung by country folk have often not much to do with the  Nativity; they are sometimes rhymed lives of Christ or legends of the  Holy Childhood. Of the latter class the strangest is \"The Bitter Withy,\"  discovered in Herefordshire by Mr. Frank Sidgwick. It tells how the  little Jesus asked three lads to play with Him at ball. But they  refused:--       \"'O we are lords' and ladies' sons,        Born in bower or in hall;      And you are but a poor maid's child,        Born in an oxen's stall.' |79|        'If I am but a poor maid's child,        Born in an oxen's stall,      I will let you know at the very latter end        That I am above you all.'        So he built him a bridge with the beams of the sun,        And over the sea went he,      And after followed the three jolly jerdins,        And drowned they were all three.        Then Mary mild called home her child,        And laid him across her knee,      And with a handful of green withy twigs        She gave him slashes three.        'O the withy, O the withy, O bitter withy        That causes me to smart!      O the withy shall be the very first tree        That perishes at the heart.'\"    From these popular ballads, mediaeval memories in the rustic mind, we  must return to the devotional verse of the late sixteenth and early  seventeenth centuries. Two of the greatest poets of the Nativity, the  Roman priests Southwell and Crashaw, are deeply affected by the wave of  mysticism which passed over Europe in their time. Familiar as is  Southwell's \"The Burning Babe,\" few will be sorry to find it here:--       \"As I in hoary winter's night        Stood shivering in the snow,      Surprised I was with sudden heat,        Which made my heart to glow;      And lifting up a fearful eye        To view what fire was near,      A pretty Babe all burning bright        Did in the air appear;      Who, scorched with excessive heat,        Such floods of tears did shed,      As though His floods should quench His flames        Which with His tears were fed. |80|      'Alas!' quoth He, 'but newly born,        In fiery heats I fry,      Yet none approach to warm their hearts        Or feel my fire, but I!      My faultless breast the furnace is,        The fuel, wounding thorns;      Love is the fire, and sighs the smoke,        The ashes, shame and scorns;      The fuel Justice layeth on,        And Mercy blows the coals,      The metal in this furnace wrought        Are men's defiled souls,      For which, as now on fire I am,        To work them to their good,      So will I melt into a bath,        To wash them in my blood.'      With this he vanished out of sight,        And swiftly shrunk away:      And straight I called unto mind        That it was Christmas Day.\"{38}    As for Crashaw,       \"That the great angel-blinding light should shrink      His blaze to shine in a poor shepherd's eye,      That the unmeasured God so low should sink      As Pris'ner in a few poor rags to lie,      That from His mother's breast He milk should drink      Who feeds with nectar heaven's fair family,        That a vile manger His low bed should prove        Who in a throne of stars thunders above:        That He, whom the sun serves, should faintly peep      Through clouds of infant flesh; that He the old      Eternal Word should be a Child and weep,      That He who made the fire should fear the cold:      That heaven's high majesty His court should keep      In a clay cottage, by each blast controll'd:        That glory's self should serve our griefs and fears,        And free Eternity submit to years--\"{39}    such are the wondrous paradoxes celebrated in his glowing imagery. The  contrast of the winter snow with the burning |81| heat of Incarnate  Love, of the blinding light of Divinity with the night's darkness, indeed  the whole paradox of the Incarnation--Infinity in extremest  limitation--is nowhere realized with such intensity as by him. Yet,  magnificent as are his best lines, his verse sometimes becomes too like  the seventeenth-century Jesuit churches, with walls overladen with  decoration, with great languorous pictures and air heavy with incense;  and then we long for the dewy freshness of the early carols.    The representative Anglican poets of the seventeenth century, Herbert and  Vaughan, scarcely rise to their greatest heights in their treatment of  Christmas, but with them as with the Romanists it is the mystical note  that is dominant. Herbert sings:--       \"O Thou, whose glorious, yet contracted, light,        Wrapt in night's mantle, stole into a manger;      Since my dark soul and brutish is Thy right,        To man, of all beasts, be not Thou a stranger.        Furnish and deck my soul, that thou may'st have      A better lodging than a rack or grave.\"{40}    And Vaughan:--       \"I would I had in my best part      Fit rooms for Thee! or that my heart            Were so clean as            Thy manger was!      But I am all filth, and obscene:      Yet, if Thou wilt, Thou canst make clean.        Sweet Jesu! will then. Let no more      This leper haunt and soil thy door!            Cure him, ease him,            O release him!      And let once more, by mystic birth,      The Lord of life be born in earth.\"{41}    In Herrick--how different a country parson from Herbert!--we find a sort  of pagan piety towards the Divine Infant which, |82| though purely  English in its expression, makes us think of some French _Noeliste_ or  some present-day Italian worshipper of the _Bambino_:--       \"Instead of neat enclosures      Of interwoven osiers,      Instead of fragrant posies      Of daffodils and roses,      Thy cradle, kingly Stranger,          As gospel tells,          Was nothing else      But here a homely manger.        But we with silks not crewels,      With sundry precious jewels,      And lily work will dress Thee;      And, as we dispossess Thee      Of clouts, we'll make a chamber,          Sweet Babe, for Thee,          Of ivory,      And plaster'd round with amber.\"{42}    Poems such as Herrick's to the Babe of Bethlehem reveal in their writers  a certain childlikeness, an _insouciance_ without irreverence, the spirit  indeed of a child which turns to its God quite simply and naturally,  which makes Him after its own child-image, and sees Him as a friend who  can be pleased with trifles--almost, in fact, as a glorious playmate.  Such a nature has no intense feeling of sin, but can ask for forgiveness  and then forget; religion for it is rather an outward ritual to be duly  and gracefully performed than an inward transforming power. Herrick is a  strange exception among the Anglican singers of Christmas.    Milton's great Nativity hymn, with its wondrous blending of pastoral  simplicity and classical conceits, is too familiar for quotation here; it  may be suggested, however, that this work of the poet's youth is far more  Anglican than Puritan in its spirit.    Sweet and solemn Spenserian echoes are these verses from Giles Fletcher's  \"Christ's Victory in Heaven\":-- |83|       \"Who can"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19103"],[0,"The Discovery of a World in the Moone (#11)"],[1," then that she had some other end which moved her to produce  this variety, and this in all probability was her intent to make it a  fit body for habitation with the same conveniencies of sea and land, as  this inferiour world doth partake of. For since the Moone is such a  vast, such a solid and opacous body like our earth (as was above proved)  why may it not be probable, that those thinner and thicker parts  appearing in her, doe shew the difference betwixt the sea and land in  that other world; and _Galilaeus_ doubts not, but that if our earth were  visible at the same distance, there would be the like appearance of it.    As for the forme of those spots, some of the vulgar thinke they  represent a man, and the Poets guesse 'tis the boy _Endimion_, whose  company shee loves so well, that shee carries him with her, others will  have it onely to be the face of a man as the Moone is usually pictured,  but _Albertus_ thinkes rather, that it represents a Lyon with his taile  towards the East, and his head the West, and [1]*some others have  thought it to be very much like a Fox, & certainly 'tis as much like a  Lyon as that in the _Zodiake_, or as _Vrsa major_ is like a Beare.      [Sidenote 1*: Eusebius Nioremb. _Hist. Nat. lib. 8. c. 15._]    I should guesse that it represents one of these as well as another, and  any thing else as well as any of these, since 'tis but a strong  imagination, which fancies such images as schoole-boyes usually doe in  the markes of a wall, whereas there is not any such similitude in the  spots themselves, which rather like our Sea, in respect of the land,  appeares under a rugged and confused figure, and doth not represent any  distinct image, so that both in respect of the matter and the forme it  may be probable enough, that those spots and brighter parts may shew the  distinction betwixt the Sea and Land in that other world.          Proposition 8.    _The spots represent the Sea, and the brighter parts the Land._      When I first compared the nature of our earth and water with those  appearances in the Moone; I concluded contrary to the proposition, that  the brighter parts represented the water, and the spots the land; of  this opinion likewise was _Keplar_ at the first; but my second thoughts,  and the reading of others,[1] have now convinced me (as after he was) of  the truth of that Proposition which I have now set downe. But before I  come to the confirmation of it, I shall mention those scruples which at  first made mee doubt of the truth of this opinion.      [Sidenote 1: _Opt. Astro. c. 6. num. 9._    _Dissert. cum nuncio Gal._]    1. It may be objected, 'tis probable, if there be any such sea and land  as ours, that it bears some proportion and similitude with ours: but now  this Proposition takes away all likenesse betwixt them, for whereas the  superficies of our earth is but the third part of the whole surface in  the globe, two parts being overspread with the water (as _Scaliger_[1]  observes) yet here according to this opinion, the Sea should be lesse  then the Land, since there is not so much of the bespotted, as ther is  of the enlightened parts, wherefore 'tis probable, that either there is  no such thing at all, or else that the brighter parts are the Sea.      [Sidenote 1: _Exercit. 38._]    2. The water, by reason of the smoothnesse of its superficies, seemes  better able to reflect the Sun beames then the earth, which in most  places is so full of ruggednesse of grasse and trees, and such like  impediments of reflection, and besides, comon experience shewes, that  the water shines with a greater and more glorious brightnesse then the  earth, therefore it should seeme that the spots are the earth, and the  brighter parts the water.    But to the first it may be answered.    1. There is no great probability in this consequence, that because 'tis  so with us, therefore it must be so with the parts of the Moone, for  since there is such a difference betwixt them in divers other respects,  they may not, perhaps, agree in this.    2. That assertion of _Scaliger_ is not by all granted for a truth.  _Fromondus_[1] with others, thinke, that the superficies of the Sea and  Land in so much of the world as is already discovered, is equall, and of  the same extension.      [Sidenote 1: _De Meteoris l. 5. c. 1. Art. 1._]    3. The Orbe of thicke and vaporous aire which encompasses the Moone,  makes the brighter parts of that Planet appeare bigger then in  themselves they are; as I shall shew afterwards.    To the second it may be answered, that though the water be of a smooth  superficies, and so may seeme most fit to reverberate the light, yet  because 'tis of a perspicuous nature, therefore the beames must sinke  into it, and cannot so strongly and clearely be reflected. _Sicut in  speculo ubi plumbum abrasum fuerit_, (saith _Cardan_) as in  Looking-glasses where part of the lead is raized off, and nothing left  behind to reverberate the image, the species must there passe through  and not backe againe; so it is where the beames penetrate and sinke into  the substance of the body, there cannot be such an immediate and strong  reflection as when they are beate backe from the superficies, and  therefore the Sunne causes a greater heate by farre upon the Land then  upon the water. Now as for that experiment, where 'tis said, that the  waters have a greater brightness then the Land: I answer, 'tis true  onely there where they represent the image of the Sunne or some bright  cloud, and not in other places, as is very plaine by common observation.    So that notwithstanding those doubts, yet this Proposition may remaine  true, that the spots may be the Sea, and the brighter parts the Land. Of  this opinion was _Plutarch_: unto him assented _Keplar_ and _Galilaeus_,  whose words are these,      _Si quis veterum Pythagoraeorum sententiam excuscitare velit, lunam    scilicet esse quasi tellurem alteram, ejus pars lucidior terrenam    superficiem, obscurior vero aqueam magis congrue repraesentet. Mihi    autem dubium fuit numquam terrestris globi a longe conspecti,    atque a radiis solaribus perfusi, terream superficiem clariorem,    obscuriorem vero aqueam sese in conspectum daturam._[1]      \"If any man have a minde to renew the opinion of the _Pythagoreans_,    that the Moone is another earth, then her brighter parts may fitly    represent the earths superficies, and the darker part the water:    and for my part, I never doubted but that our earthly globe being    shined upon by the Sunne, and beheld at a great distance, the Land    would appeare brightest and the Sea more obscurely.\"      [Sidenote 1: _De facie lun._    _Dissertatio._    _Nunc. Syd._]    The reasons may be.    1. That which I urged about the foregoing Chapter, because the water is  the thinner part, and therefore must give the lesse light.    2. Because observation tels us, that the spotted parts are alwaies  smooth and equall, having every where an equality of light, when once  they are enlightened by the Sunne, whereas the brighter parts are full  of rugged gibbosities and mountaines having many shades in them, as I  shall shew more at large afterwards.    That in this Planet there must be Seas, _Campanella_[1] indeavours to  prove out of Scripture interpreting the _waters above the Firmament_  spoken of in _Genesis_ to be meant of the Sea in this world. For (saith  he) 'tis not likely that there are any such waters above the Orbes to  moderate that heate which they receive from their swift motion (as some  of the Fathers thinke) nor did _Moses_ meane the Angells which may be  called spirituall waters, as _Origen_ and _Austin_[2] would have it, for  both these are rejected by the generall consent: nor could he meane any  waters in the second region, as most Commentators interpret it. For  first there is nothing but vapours, which though they are afterwards  turned into water, yet while they remaine there, they are onely the  matter of that element, which may as well be fire or earth, or aire.  2. Those vapors are not above the _expansum_, but in it. So that hee  thinkes there is no other way to salve all, but by making the Planets  severall worlds with Sea & Land, with such Rivers and Springs, as wee  have here below: Especially since _Esdras_[3] speakes of the springs  above the Firmament, but I cannot agree with him in this, nor doe I  thinke that any such thing can be proved out of Scripture.      [Sidenote 1: _Apologia pro Galilaeo._]      [Sidenote 2: _Confession. l. 13. c. 32._]      [Sidenote 3: 2 Esdr. 4. 7.]    Before I proceede to the next Position, I shall first answer some doubts  which might be made against the generality of this truth, whereby it may  seeme impossible that there should be either Sea or Land in the Moone;  for since she moves so swiftly as Astronomers observe, why then does  there nothing fall from her, or why doth shee not shake something out by  the celerity of her revolution? I answer, you must know that the  inclination of every heavie body, to its proper Center doth sufficiently  tie it unto its place, so that suppose any thing were separated, yet  must it necessarily returne againe, and there is no more danger of their  falling into our world then there is feare of our falling into the  Moone.    But yet there are many fabulous relations of such things as have dropped  thence. There is a tale of the Nemean Lyon that _Hercules_ slew, which  first rushing among the heards out of his unknowne den in the Mountaine  of _Cytheron_ in _Boeotia_, the credulous people thought he was sent  from their Goddesse the Moone. And if a whirle-winde did chance to  snatch any thing up, and afterwards raine it downe againe, the ignorant  multitude are apt to believe that it dropt from Heaven. Thus _Avicenna_  relates the story of a Calfe which fell downe in a storme, the beholders  thinking it a Moone-calfe, and that it fell thence. So _Cardan_  travelling upon the Apennine"]]]
