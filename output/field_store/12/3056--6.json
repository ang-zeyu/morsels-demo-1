When within fair distance he hurls the snake at the  unfortunate victim, in the full assurance that even should it strike  him it cannot bury its fangs in his flesh, since it is impossible for  it to coil till it reaches the ground. This is a jest of which I have  frequently been the victim, nor have I yet learned to appreciate it  with unalloyed mirth.    The belief that rattlesnakes always give warning before striking is  not well founded. If come upon suddenly, they often strike first, and  if disturbed when in a space so narrow that the coil cannot be formed,  they may give no warning of their presence beyond the penetration of  the fangs into the hand or foot of an intruder. One such case I saw.    It seems to be well established that a snake will not voluntarily  crawl over a hair rope, and in certain parts of the country it is  common for campers-out to surround their beds with such a rope, since  the reptiles seek warmth, and are frequently found under or in the  blankets of those sleeping on the ground.    After an exceptionally large experience with wounds inflicted by the  fangs of the rattlesnake, and an experience which, I am glad to say,  has been most successful in its outcome, I think it my duty to add,  from a practical standpoint, my testimony as to the efficacy of  permanganate of potassium in the treatment of this class of cases.  This drug was first introduced by Lacerda, of Brazil, and, if more  generally used, would, I believe, render comparatively innocuous a  class of injury which now usually terminates in death.    I make this statement as to the fatality of crotalus poison advisedly.  I know the belief is very common that the poison of a rattlesnake is  readily combated by full doses of whisky. This is fallacious. I have  taken the pains to investigate a number of instances of cure resulting  from the employment of free stimulation. In each case the fangs did  not penetrate deeply into the tissues, but either scratched over the  surface or tore through, making a wound of entrance and exit, so that  the poison, or at least the major part of it, was not injected into  the tissues of the person struck. The effect is very much the same as  when an inexperienced practitioner picks up a fold of skin for the  purpose of making a hypodermic injection, and plunges his needle  entirely through, forcing the medicament wide of his patient.    Nearly all, if not all, of the cases treated by stimulation alone  have, according to my experience, perished if they have received a  full dose of virus from a vigorous snake. One of these cases lived for  upward of a month. He then perished of what might be considered a  chronic pyaemia, the symptoms being those of blood poisoning,  accompanied by multiple abscesses. Another case, not occurring in my  own practice, died at the end of four days apparently of cardiac  failure. Active delirium persisted all through this case. Two other  cases treated by stimulants also died with symptoms of more or less  acute blood poisoning.    The feeling is almost universal among the people of Wyoming that a  fair strike from a rattlesnake is certain death, and that the free use  of stimulants simply postpones the end. I do not for a moment deny  that a strong, lusty man may be struck fairly by a rattlesnake and if  the wound is at once opened and cauterized, and the heart judiciously  supported, he may yet recover; still the fact remains that the great  majority of these cases perish at a longer or shorter interval  following the infliction of the wound. Hence any treatment that will  save even the majority of such cases is a distinct gain, and one which  has saved every one of nine cases to which it has been applied needs  no further commendation.    The first case of rattlesnake wound to which I was called occurred in  1885. A cow boy was bitten on the foot, the fang penetrating through  the boot. He was brought forty miles to Fort Fetterman, where I was  then stationed. I saw him about twenty-four hours after he was struck.  There was an enormous swelling, extending up to the knee. The whole  limb was bronzed in appearance. There was no special discoloration  about the wound; in fact, the swelling disguised this to such an  extent that it was impossible to determine exactly where the fangs had  entered. The pulse was scarcely perceptible at the wrist; the heart  was beating with excessive rapidity. The patient was suffering great  pain. His mind was clear, but he was oppressed with a dreadful  anxiety. Up to the time I saw him he had received absolutely no  treatment, excepting the application of a cactus poultice to the leg,  since there was no whisky at the ranch where he was wounded. I at once  made free incisions, five or six in number, from one to two inches in  depth, and about three inches in length. These cuts gave him very  little pain, nor was there much bleeding, though there was an enormous  amount of serous oozing. Into these wounds was poured a fifteen per  cent. solution of permanganate of potassium, and fully half an hour  was devoted to kneading this drug into the tissues. In addition I made  many hypodermic injections into all portions of the swollen tissue,  but particularly about the wound. Since there was no very distinct  line of demarkation between the swollen and healthy tissue, I did not,  as in other cases, endeavor to prevent the extension of the cellular  involvement by a complete circle of hypodermic injections. I employed,  in all, about forty grains of the permanganate. In addition to the  local treatment I pushed stimulation, employing carbonate of ammonium  and whisky. By means of diuretics and laxatives the kidneys and bowels  were encouraged to eliminate as much of the poison as possible.    The patient went on to uninterrupted recovery. The wound healed with  very little sloughing. The patient returned to his work in about a  month. The cure of this case was regarded by the cow boys as most  exceptional, since, in their experience, similar cases, even though  very freely stimulated, had not recovered.    Some time later I was called to see a girl, aged 14, who was struck by  a rattlesnake, fifty-six miles from Fort Fetterman. There was some  trouble about procuring relays, and I was compelled to ride the same  horse all the way out. This took a little short of five hours. This,  together with the time consumed in sending me word, caused an interval  of about twenty hours between the infliction of the injury and the  time I saw the patient. I found the fangs had entered on either side  of the distal joint of the middle metacarpal bone. The arm was  enormously swollen, almost to the axilla, and exhibited a bronzed  discoloration; this was especially marked about the wound and along  the course of the lymphatics. The swollen area was _boggy_ to the  touch, and exhibited a distinct line of demarkation between the  healthy and diseased tissues, excepting along the course of the  brachial vessels, where the indurated discolored area extended as a  broad band into the axilliary lymphatics, which were distinctly  swollen. The patient was delirious, was harrassed by terror,  complained bitterly of pain, and had an exceedingly feeble, rapid  heart action. There was marked dyspnoea, and all the signs of  impending dissolution. I at once made free multiple incisions into all  parts of the inflamed tissue, carrying two of my cuts through the  wounds made by the fangs of the snake. In the arm these incisions were  several inches long and from one to two inches deep. As in the former  case, the bleeding was slight, but there was a free exudation of  serum. Into these wounds a fifteen per cent. permanganate of potassium  solution was poured, and as much as possible was kneaded into the  tissues. In addition multiple hypodermic injections were made, these  being carried particularly into the bitten region, and circularly  around the arm just at the border of the line of demarkation, thus  endeavoring to limit by a complete circle of the antiseptic solution  the further extension of the inflammatory process. In the region of  the brachial vessels I hesitated to make my injections as thoroughly  as in the rest of the circumference of the arm, fearing lest the  permanganate of potassium might injure important vessels or nerves.    This treatment caused very little pain, but immediately after the  constitutional symptoms became distinctly aggravated. I stimulated  freely, and at once made preparations to take the patient to the Fort  Fetterman hospital. She was transported over the fifty-six miles, I  riding the same horse back again, and arriving at Fort Fetterman the  same evening.    The after treatment of this case was comparatively simple. She was  stimulated freely as long as cardiac weakness was manifested. As in  the former case, diuretics and laxatives were employed. The arm was  wrapped in cloth soaked in a weak permanganate solution, was placed in  a splint, and was loosely bandaged. There was some sloughing, but this  was treated on general surgical principles. The patient recovered the  entire use of her arm, and was turned out cured in about six weeks.    The third case I saw about fourteen hours after he was struck. The  patient was a healthy blacksmith, about 30 years of age. The wound was  at about the middle of the forearm, the fangs entering toward the  ulnar side. When I saw the patient he exhibited comparatively trifling  symptoms. His heart action was rapid, and he was suffering from the  typical despondency and terror, but I could not note the profound  systemic depression characteristic of the great majority of cases.  Surrounding the wound and extending up the forearm for several inches  there was "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15207"],[0,"The New Physics and Its Evolution (#11)"],[1,"1830, ideas had occurred to him  from which it resulted that in producing work an equivalent amount of  heat was destroyed. But the year 1842 is particularly memorable in the  history of science as the year in which Jules Robert Mayer succeeded,  by an entirely personal effort, in really enunciating the principle of  the conservation of energy. Chemists recall with just pride that the  _Remarques sur les forces de la nature animee_, contemptuously  rejected by all the journals of physics, were received and published  in the _Annalen_ of Liebig. We ought never to forget this example,  which shows with what difficulty a new idea contrary to the classic  theories of the period succeeds in coming to the front; but  extenuating circumstances may be urged on behalf of the physicists.    Robert Mayer had a rather insufficient mathematical education, and his  Memoirs, the _Remarques_, as well as the ulterior publications,  _Memoire sur le mouvement organique et la nutrition_ and the  _Materiaux pour la dynamique du ciel_, contain, side by side with very  profound ideas, evident errors in mechanics. Thus it often happens  that discoveries put forward in a somewhat vague manner by adventurous  minds not overburdened by the heavy baggage of scientific erudition,  who audaciously press forward in advance of their time, fall into  quite intelligible oblivion until rediscovered, clarified, and put  into shape by slower but surer seekers. This was the case with the  ideas of Mayer. They were not understood at first sight, not only on  account of their originality, but also because they were couched in  incorrect language.    Mayer was, however, endowed with a singular strength of thought; he  expressed in a rather confused manner a principle which, for him, had  a generality greater than mechanics itself, and so his discovery was  in advance not only of his own time but of half the century. He may  justly be considered the founder of modern energetics.    Freed from the obscurities which prevented its being clearly  perceived, his idea stands out to-day in all its imposing simplicity.  Yet it must be acknowledged that if it was somewhat denaturalised by  those who endeavoured to adapt it to the theories of mechanics, and if  it at first lost its sublime stamp of generality, it thus became  firmly fixed and consolidated on a more stable basis.    The efforts of Helmholtz, Clausius, and Lord Kelvin to introduce the  principle of the conservation of energy into mechanics, were far from  useless. These illustrious physicists succeeded in giving a more  precise form to its numerous applications; and their attempts thus  contributed, by reaction, to give a fresh impulse to mechanics, and  allowed it to be linked to a more general order of facts. If  energetics has not been able to be included in mechanics, it seems  indeed that the attempt to include mechanics in energetics was not in  vain.    In the middle of the last century, the explanation of all natural  phenomena seemed more and more referable to the case of central  forces. Everywhere it was thought that reciprocal actions between  material points could be perceived, these points being attracted or  repelled by each other with an intensity depending only on their  distance or their mass. If, to a system thus composed, the laws of the  classical mechanics are applied, it is shown that half the sum of the  product of the masses by the square of the velocities, to which is  added the work which might be accomplished by the forces to which the  system would be subject if it returned from its actual to its initial  position, is a sum constant in quantity.    This sum, which is the mechanical energy of the system, is therefore  an invariable quantity in all the states to which it may be brought by  the interaction of its various parts, and the word energy well  expresses a capital property of this quantity. For if two systems are  connected in such a way that any change produced in the one  necessarily brings about a change in the other, there can be no  variation in the characteristic quantity of the second except so far  as the characteristic quantity of the first itself varies--on  condition, of course, that the connexions are made in such a manner as  to introduce no new force. It will thus be seen that this quantity  well expresses the capacity possessed by a system for modifying the  state of a neighbouring system to which we may suppose it connected.    Now this theorem of pure mechanics was found wanting every time  friction took place--that is to say, in all really observable cases.  The more perceptible the friction, the more considerable the  difference; but, in addition, a new phenomenon always appeared and  heat was produced. By experiments which are now classic, it became  established that the quantity of heat thus created independently of  the nature of the bodies is always (provided no other phenomena  intervene) proportional to the energy which has disappeared.  Reciprocally, also, heat may disappear, and we always find a constant  relation between the quantities of heat and work which mutually  replace each other.    It is quite clear that such experiments do not prove that heat is  work. We might just as well say that work is heat. It is making a  gratuitous hypothesis to admit this reduction of heat to mechanism;  but this hypothesis was so seductive, and so much in conformity with  the desire of nearly all physicists to arrive at some sort of unity in  nature, that they made it with eagerness and became unreservedly  convinced that heat was an active internal force.    Their error was not in admitting this hypothesis; it was a legitimate  one since it has proved very fruitful. But some of them committed the  fault of forgetting that it was an hypothesis, and considered it a  demonstrated truth. Moreover, they were thus brought to see in  phenomena nothing but these two particular forms of energy which in  their minds were easily identified with each other.    From the outset, however, it became manifest that the principle is  applicable to cases where heat plays only a parasitical part. There  were thus discovered, by translating the principle of equivalence,  numerical relations between the magnitudes of electricity, for  instance, and the magnitudes of mechanics. Heat was a sort of variable  intermediary convenient for calculation, but introduced in a  roundabout way and destined to disappear in the final result.    Verdet, who, in lectures which have rightly remained celebrated,  defined with remarkable clearness the new theories, said, in 1862:  \"Electrical phenomena are always accompanied by calorific  manifestations, of which the study belongs to the mechanical theory of  heat. This study, moreover, will not only have the effect of making  known to us interesting facts in electricity, but will throw some  light on the phenomena of electricity themselves.\"    The eminent professor was thus expressing the general opinion of his  contemporaries, but he certainly seemed to have felt in advance that  the new theory was about to penetrate more deeply into the inmost  nature of things. Three years previously, Rankine also had put forth  some very remarkable ideas the full meaning of which was not at first  well understood. He it was who comprehended the utility of employing a  more inclusive term, and invented the phrase energetics. He also  endeavoured to create a new doctrine of which rational mechanics  should be only a particular case; and he showed that it was possible  to abandon the ideas of atoms and central forces, and to construct a  more general system by substituting for the ordinary consideration of  forces that of the energy which exists in all bodies, partly in an  actual, partly in a potential state.    By giving more precision to the conceptions of Rankine, the physicists  of the end of the nineteenth century were brought to consider that in  all physical phenomena there occur apparitions and disappearances  which are balanced by various energies. It is natural, however, to  suppose that these equivalent apparitions and disappearances  correspond to transformations and not to simultaneous creations and  destructions. We thus represent energy to ourselves as taking  different forms--mechanical, electrical, calorific, and chemical--  capable of changing one into the other, but in such a way that the  quantitative value always remains the same. In like manner a bank  draft may be represented by notes, gold, silver, or bullion. The  earliest known form of energy, _i.e._ work, will serve as the standard  as gold serves as the monetary standard, and energy in all its forms  will be estimated by the corresponding work. In each particular case  we can strictly define and measure, by the correct application of the  principle of the conservation of energy, the quantity of energy  evolved under a given form.    We can thus arrange a machine comprising a body capable of evolving  this energy; then we can force all the organs of this machine to  complete an entirely closed cycle, with the exception of the body  itself, which, however, has to return to such a state that all the  variables from which this state depends resume their initial values  except the particular variable to which the evolution of the energy  under consideration is linked. The difference between the work thus  accomplished and that which would have been obtained if this variable  also had returned to its original value, is the measure of the energy  evolved.    In the same way that, in the minds of mechanicians, all forces of  whatever origin, which are capable of compounding with each other and  of balancing each other, belong to the same category of beings, so for  many physicists energy is a sort of entity which we find under various  aspects. There thus exists for them a world, which comes in some way  to superpose itself upon the world of matter--that is to say, the  world of "]]]
