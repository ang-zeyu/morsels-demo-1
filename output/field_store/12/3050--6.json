[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15069"],[0,"Diet and Health; With Key to the Calories (#11)"],[1,"000/255 (1 oz. fat = 255 C.)]; 4 ounces of fat daily equals 8 pounds a  month which will be added to your weight, and, if not needed by the  system, will deposit itself as excess fat.    Or the toxins arising from the unnecessary food will irritate the blood  vessels, causing arterio-sclerosis (hardening of the arteries), which in  turn may cause kidney disease, heart disease, or apoplexy (rupture of  artery in the brain), and maybe death before your time.    On the other hand, if you are underweight and the added nourishment is  gradually worked up to, it will improve the health and cause a gain of  so much (theoretically, and in reality if kept up long enough).    [Sidenote: _3d Circle_]    THE THIRD circle represents a diet containing less than the maintenance;  again, for example, say 1000 calories less. Here the 1000 calories must  be taken from the body tissue, and fat is the first to go, for fat is  virtually dead tissue.    This 4 ounces of fat daily which will be supplied by your body equals in  six months 48 pounds.    There are in America hundreds of thousands of overweight individuals;  not all so much overweight as this, but some considerably more so. If  these individuals will save 1000 calories of food daily by using their  stored fat, think what it would mean at this time.    [Sidenote: _Savings_]    Not only an immense saving of food to be sent to our soldiers and allies  and the starving civilians, and of money which could be used for Liberty  Bonds, the Red Cross, and other war relief work, but a great saving and  a great increase in power; for there is no doubt that by reducing as  slowly and scientifically as I have directed, efficiency and health will  be increased one hundred fold.    If, as illustrated in the third circle, the 1000 calories or less is  eaten and the individual already is underweight, with no excess fat,  then this amount will be taken from the muscles and the more vital  tissues, and the organism will finally succumb. Before this time is  reached there will be a great lowering of resistance, and the individual  will be a prey to the infectious diseases.    It must be remembered that in children the growth of the whole body is  tremendously active, and especially that of the heart and nervous  system.    If the nervous system is undernourished, it becomes disorganized and  undeveloped. This is apt to be expressed in uncertain emotional states,  quick tempers, and a predisposition to convulsions. The heart, if  undernourished, lays its foundation for future heart disease, and the  whole system will be injured for life.    Anything that impairs the vigor and vitality of children strikes at the  basis of national welfare.    [Sidenote: _The Food Administration Emphasizes This_]    You can see from this how extremely important it is that, in our need  for the conservation of food, only those who can deny themselves and at  the same time improve their health and efficiently should do it. It will  be no help in our crisis if the health and resistance of our people be  lowered and the growth and development of our children be stunted.    We, the hundreds of thousands of overweight citizens, combined with the  hundreds of thousands of the normal who are overeating to their ill, can  save all the food that is necessary. We are anxious, willing, eager to  do this. Now we know how, and we will.    _Food Will Win the War_    WATCH OUR WEIGHT!          13    Three Years Later    _February, 1, 1921_    An Added Chapter in Which Are Offered Twenty-one Suggestive Menus      After nearly two years with the American Red Cross in the Balkans I  return to find the little book has been carrying on in my absence--I  write this for the fifth edition--and my publishers insisting that I  must furnish some more menus. They affirm that there are many who do not  care to or cannot figure out their own.    After being so long under military discipline I obey now instinctively,  although I do not want to do this. But you know publishers. They say  that if there are menus for those who do not have the desire to compute  them, the usefulness of the book will be increased. Publishers are so  altruistic.    Now far be it from me to scorn the possibility of increased sales  myself. So I comply, and after you are reduced you will have the energy  and the increased keenness to scout around in the calories and make out  your own.           *       *       *       *       *    A little of my Balkan experience in the reducing line may not be amiss.  In Albania, where I was stationed most of the time, life is very  strenuous. We all had to work hard and expend a great deal of nervous  energy. Medical calls on foot in the scorching sun over unkind  cobblestones, long distance calls on unkinder mules, long hours in  nerve-racking clinics, ferocious man-eating mosquitos, scorpions,  centipedes, sandflies, and fleas, and other unspeakable animals kept us  hopping and slapping and scratching.    But there was one consolation to me. With this work, more intensive and  more strenuous than I had ever done before, I would not have to diet--I  would not have to watch my weight--I would not have to count my  calories! Oh, joy!    We lived a community life, we Red Crossers. We had plain blunt food,  American canned mostly, supplemented with the fare that could be eked  out of Albania, and cooked by an Albanese who could not be taught that  we Americans were not Esquimos and did not like food swimming in fat.  However, it tasted good to famished Red Crossers, and I ate three meals  a day, confident that I would retain my girlish middle-aged slenderness  and not have to diet. We had no scales and no mirrors larger than our  hand mirrors. Our uniforms were big and comfortable.           *       *       *       *       *    The French who are in charge of Scutari depart, the officers leaving to  us some of their furniture, including a full length French plate mirror.  Ordinarily when I look in a full-length mirror I don't hate myself so  much--so it is with some degree of anticipated pleasure that I  complacently approach, to get a life-size reflection of myself after  many months of deprivation of that pleasure.    \"_Mon Dieu!_\" I exclaim. \"_Bogomi_!\" (Serbian--'For the love of Allah!')  \"This is no mirror,\" I mutter. \"This is one of those musee things that  make you look like a Tony Sarg picture of Irvin Cobb.\"    \"What's irritating you, Dockie?\" asks one of the girls, coming up and  standing back of me. I look at her reflection. She does not look like  Irvin Cobb!    \"Peggy,\" I say tragically, \"Peggy, do I look like my reflection?\"    \"Yes, dear, we have all noticed how stout you have been getting. Aren't  you supposed to be some shark on the subject of ideal weight?\"    And the bitter truth is borne in upon me--no matter how hard I work--no  matter how much I exercise, no matter what I suffer, I will always have  to watch my weight, I will always have to count my calories.    This is what I did then:    I stopped going to the breakfast table. I kept some canned milk and  coffee in my room, and made me two cups of coffee. For lunch I ate  practically what I wanted, limiting myself to one slice of bread or one  potato (we had no butter), with fruit for dessert. For dinner I came  down only when the dessert was being served, and had a share of that  with some coffee. I was jeered and derided. You know how in community  life we all are as disagreeable as we like, and still love each other.  Did not I know the desserts were the most fattening part of the meal? I  was some authority on how to reduce, I was!    In vain I told them that it did not matter so long as my total caloric  intake did not equal the number that I needed. It was not until some  months after, when they saw that I was normal weight again, that they  began to realize I knew whereof I spoke.    Then came our withdrawal from Albania and release from duty. After  months of canned goods came Paris with its famous dishes; Creme d'Isigny  avec creme! Artichauts an beurre! Patisseries francaises! Oo lala! Again  I said calories be _dashed_! I can reduce when I get home. I had no  delusions now, you see.           *       *       *       *       *    And now I am home trying to help raise the funds for the starving  children of Central Europe, and explaining to my friends that while  there is a food shortage in Europe it is not because I was there; and  that I am reducing and the money that I can save will help keep a child  from starving, and that they can do the same; that for every pang of  hunger we feel we can have a double joy, that of knowing we are saving  worse pangs in some little children, and that of knowing that for every  pang we feel we lose a pound. A pang's a pound the world around we'll  say.    Every once in a while you hear that the caloric theory has been  exploded. There is no caloric \"theory.\" Therefore none to explode.  Calories are simply units for measuring heat and energy and never will  be exploded any more than the yard or meter \"theory\" will be exploded.  Foods must contain essential salts and the growth and health maintaining  elements. These cannot be measured by calories. The quantity of heat or  energy production but not the quality of the foods is measured in  calories, and one must have a knowledge of the qualities also. No  scientifically educated individual has ever thought otherwise.    The chief objection to following the advice of the numerous laymen who  write eat-and-grow-thin menus is that they advise the elimination of all  fats, sugars and starches. They lose sight of the fact, or they do not  know, that the obese individual--I dislike that term--will have to have  a balanced diet even while reducing if he is to maintain his health. One  will lose weight on these menus, but as very many can testify they lose  their health also. One cannot live on an unbalanced diet for any length  of time without becoming unbalanced also."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15097"],[0,"A Grammar of the English Tongue (#11)"],[1,"summit of a lofty tow'r;    A thousand winding entries long and wide    Receive of fresh reports a flowing tide.    A thousand crannies in the walls are made;    Nor gate nor bars exclude the busy trade.    Tis built of brass, the better to diffuse    The spreading sounds, and multiply the news;    Where echoes in repeated echoes play:    A mart for ever full; and open night and day.    Nor silence is within, nor voice express,    But a deaf noise of sounds that never cease;    Confus'd and chiding, like the hollow roar    Of tides, receding from th' insulted shore;    Or like the broken thunder heard from far,    When Jove to distance drives the rolling war.    The courts are fill'd with a tumultuous din,    Of crouds, or issuing forth, or ent'ring in:    A thorough-fare of news; where some devise    Things never heard, some mingle truth with lies:    The troubled air with empty sounds they beat,    Intent to hear, and eager to repeat.       Dryden.    In all these measures the accents are to be placed on even syllables; and  every line considered by itself is more harmonious, as this rule is more  strictly observed. The variations necessary to pleasure belong to the art  of poetry, not the rules of grammar.    Our trochaick measures are Of three syllables,      Here we may    Think and pray,    Before death    Stops our breath:    Other joys    Are but toys.       Walton's Angler.    Of five,      In the days of old,    Stories plainly told,    Lovers felt annoy.       Old Ballad.    Of seven,      Fairest piece of well form'd earth,    Urge not thus your haughty birth.       Waller.    In these measures the accent is to be placed on the odd syllables.    These are the measures which are now in use, and above the rest those of  seven, eight, and ten syllables. Our ancient poets wrote verses sometimes  of twelve syllables, as Drayton's Polyolbion.      Of all the Cambrian shires their heads that bear so high,    And farth'st survey their soils with an ambitious eye,    Mervinia for her hills, as for their matchless crouds,    The nearest that are said to kiss the wand'ring clouds,    Especial audience craves, offended with the throng,    That she of all the rest neglected was so long;    Alledging for herself, when, through the Saxons' pride,    The godlike race of Brute to Severn's setting side    Were cruelly inforc'd, her mountains did relieve    Those whom devouring war else every where did grieve.    And when all Wales beside (by fortune or by might)    Unto her ancient foe resign'd her ancient right,    A constant maiden still she only did remain,    The last her genuine laws which stoutly did retain.    And as each one is prais'd for her peculiar things;    So only she is rich, in mountains, meres and springs,    And holds herself as great in her superfluous waste,    As others by their towns, and fruitful tillage grac'd.    And of fourteen, as Chapman's Homer.      And as the mind of such a man, that hath a long way gone,    And either knoweth not his way, or else would let alone,    His purpos'd journey, is distract.    The measures of twelve and fourteen syllables were often mingled by our old  poets, sometimes in alternate lines, and sometimes in alternate couplets.    The verse of twelve syllables, called an Alexandrine, is now only used to  diversify heroick lines.      Waller was smooth, but Dryden taught to join    The varying verse, the full resounding line,    The long majestick march, and energy divine.       Pope.    The pause in the Alexandrine must be at the sixth syllable.    The verse of fourteen syllables is now broken into a soft lyrick measure of  verses, consisting alternately of eight syllables and six.      She to receive thy radiant name,      Selects a whiter space.       Fenton.      When all shall praise, and ev'ry lay      Devote a wreath to thee,    That day, for come it will, that day      Shall I lament to see.       Lewis to Pope.      Beneath this tomb an infant lies      To earth whose body lent,    Hereafter shall more glorious rise,      But not more innocent.    When the Archangel's trump shall blow,      And souls to bodies join,    What crowds shall wish their lives below      Had been as short as thine!       Wesley.    We have another measure very quick and lively, and therefore much used in  songs, which may be called the anapestick, in which the accent rests upon  every third syllable.      May I govern my passions with absolute sway,    And grow wiser and better as life wears away.       Dr. Pope.    In this measure a syllable is often retrenched from the first foot, as      Diogenes surly and proud.       Dr. Pope.      When present, we love, and when absent agree,    I think not of Iris, nor Iris of me.       Dryden.    These measures are varied by many combinations, and sometimes by double  endings, either with or without rhyme, as in the heroick measure.      'Tis the divinity that stirs within us,    'Tis heaven itself that points out an hereafter,    And intimates eternity to man.       Addison.    So in that of eight syllables,      They neither added nor confounded,    They neither wanted nor abounded.       Prior.    In that of seven,      For resistance I could fear none,      But with twenty ships had done,    What thou, brave and happy Vernon,      Hast atchiev'd with six alone.       Glover.    In that of six,      'Twas when the seas were roaring,      With hollow blasts of wind,    A damsel lay deploring,      All on a rock reclin'd.       Gay.    In the anapestick,      When terrible tempests assail us.      And mountainous billows affright,    Nor power nor wealth can avail us,      But skilful industry steers right.       Ballad.    To these measures and their laws, may be reduced every species of English  verse.    Our versification admits of few licences, except a synaloepha, or elision  of e in the before a vowel, as th' eternal; and more rarely of o in to, as  t' accept; and a synaresis, by which two short vowels coalesce into one  syllable, as question, special; or a word is contracted by the expulsion of  a short vowel before a liquid, as av'rice, temp'rance.    Thus have I collected rules and examples, by which the English language may  be learned, if the reader be already acquainted with grammatical terms, or  taught by a master to those that are more ignorant. To have written a  grammar for such as are not yet initiated in the schools, would have been  tedious, and perhaps at last ineffectual."]]]
