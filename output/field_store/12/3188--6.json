For Gregory says in  a homily (xxvi in Evang.): \"It avails nothing to take part in the  feasts of men, if we fail to take part in the feasts of angels\"; by  which he means final happiness. But we can take part in the feasts of  the angels by contemplating them. Therefore it seems that man's final  happiness consists in contemplating the angels.    Obj. 2: Further, the final perfection of each thing is for it to be  united to its principle: wherefore a circle is said to be a perfect  figure, because its beginning and end coincide. But the beginning of  human knowledge is from the angels, by whom men are enlightened, as  Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. iv). Therefore the perfection of the  human intellect consists in contemplating the angels.    Obj. 3: Further, each nature is perfect, when united to a higher  nature; just as the final perfection of a body is to be united to the  spiritual nature. But above the human intellect, in the natural order,  are the angels. Therefore the final perfection of the human intellect  is to be united to the angels by contemplation.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (Jer. 9:24): \"Let him that glorieth,  glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth Me.\" Therefore man's  final glory or happiness consists only in the knowledge of God.    _I answer that,_ As stated above (A. 6), man's perfect happiness  consists not in that which perfects the intellect by some  participation, but in that which is so by its essence. Now it is  evident that whatever is the perfection of a power is so in so far as  the proper formal object of that power belongs to it. Now the proper  object of the intellect is the true. Therefore the contemplation of  whatever has participated truth, does not perfect the intellect with  its final perfection. Since, therefore, the order of things is the  same in being and in truth (Metaph. ii, 1); whatever are beings by  participation, are true by participation. Now angels have being by  participation: because in God alone is His Being His Essence, as  shown in the First Part (Q. 44, A. 1). It follows that contemplation  of Him makes man perfectly happy. However, there is no reason why we  should not admit a certain imperfect happiness in the contemplation  of the angels; and higher indeed than in the consideration of  speculative science.    Reply Obj. 1: We shall take part in the feasts of the angels, by  contemplating not only the angels, but, together with them, also God  Himself.    Reply Obj. 2: According to those that hold human souls to be created  by the angels, it seems fitting enough, that man's happiness should  consist in the contemplation of the angels, in the union, as it were,  of man with his beginning. But this is erroneous, as stated in the  First Part (Q. 90, A. 3). Wherefore the final perfection of the human  intellect is by union with God, Who is the first principle both of  the creation of the soul and of its enlightenment. Whereas the angel  enlightens as a minister, as stated in the First Part (Q. 111, A. 2,  ad 2). Consequently, by his ministration he helps man to attain to  happiness; but he is not the object of man's happiness.    Reply Obj. 3: The lower nature may reach the higher in two ways.  First, according to a degree of the participating power: and thus  man's final perfection will consist in his attaining to a  contemplation such as that of the angels. Secondly, as the object is  attained by the power: and thus the final perfection of each power is  to attain that in which is found the fulness of its formal object.  ________________________    EIGHTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 3, Art. 8]    Whether Man's Happiness Consists in the Vision of the Divine Essence?    Objection 1: It would seem that man's happiness does not consist in  the vision of the Divine Essence. For Dionysius says (Myst. Theol. i)  that by that which is highest in his intellect, man is united to God  as to something altogether unknown. But that which is seen in its  essence is not altogether unknown. Therefore the final perfection of  the intellect, namely, happiness, does not consist in God being seen  in His Essence.    Obj. 2: Further, the higher the perfection belongs to the higher  nature. But to see His own Essence is the perfection proper to the  Divine intellect. Therefore the final perfection of the human  intellect does not reach to this, but consists in something less.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (1 John 3:2): \"When He shall appear,  we shall be like to Him; and [Vulg.: 'because'] we shall see Him as  He is.\"    _I answer that,_ Final and perfect happiness can consist in nothing  else than the vision of the Divine Essence. To make this clear, two  points must be observed. First, that man is not perfectly happy, so  long as something remains for him to desire and seek: secondly, that  the perfection of any power is determined by the nature of its  object. Now the object of the intellect is \"what a thing is,\" i.e.  the essence of a thing, according to _De Anima_ iii, 6. Wherefore the  intellect attains perfection, in so far as it knows the essence of a  thing. If therefore an intellect knows the essence of some effect,  whereby it is not possible to know the essence of the cause, i.e. to  know of the cause \"what it is\"; that intellect cannot be said to  reach that cause simply, although it may be able to gather from the  effect the knowledge that the cause is. Consequently, when man knows  an effect, and knows that it has a cause, there naturally remains in  the man the desire to know about the cause, \"what it is.\" And this  desire is one of wonder, and causes inquiry, as is stated in the  beginning of the _Metaphysics_ (i, 2). For instance, if a man,  knowing the eclipse of the sun, consider that it must be due to some  cause, and know not what that cause is, he wonders about it, and from  wondering proceeds to inquire. Nor does this inquiry cease until he  arrive at a knowledge of the essence of the cause.    If therefore the human intellect, knowing the essence of some created  effect, knows no more of God than \"that He is\"; the perfection of  that intellect does not yet reach simply the First Cause, but there  remains in it the natural desire to seek the cause. Wherefore it is  not yet perfectly happy. Consequently, for perfect happiness the  intellect needs to reach the very Essence of the First Cause. And  thus it will have its perfection through union with God as with that  object, in which alone man's happiness consists, as stated above (AA.  1, 7; Q. 2, A. 8).    Reply Obj. 1: Dionysius speaks of the knowledge of wayfarers  journeying towards happiness.    Reply Obj. 2: As stated above (Q. 1, A. 8), the end has a twofold  acceptation. First, as to the thing itself which is desired: and in  this way, the same thing is the end of the higher and of the lower  nature, and indeed of all things, as stated above (Q. 1, A. 8).  Secondly, as to the attainment of this thing; and thus the end of the  higher nature is different from that of the lower, according to their  respective habitudes to that thing. So then in the happiness of God,  Who, in understanding his Essence, comprehends It, is higher than  that of a man or angel who sees It indeed, but comprehends It not.  ________________________    QUESTION 4    OF THOSE THINGS THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR HAPPINESS  (In Eight Articles)    We have now to consider those things that are required for happiness:  and concerning this there are eight points of inquiry:    (1) Whether delight is required for happiness?    (2) Which is of greater account in happiness, delight or vision?    (3) Whether comprehension is required?    (4) Whether rectitude of the will is required?    (5) Whether the body is necessary for man's happiness?    (6) Whether any perfection of the body is necessary?    (7) Whether any external goods are necessary?    (8) Whether the fellowship of friends is necessary?  ________________________    FIRST ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 4, Art. 1]    Whether Delight Is Required for Happiness?    Objection 1: It would seem that delight is not required for happiness.  For Augustine says (De Trin. i, 8) that \"vision is the entire reward  of faith.\" But the prize or reward of virtue is happiness, as the  Philosopher clearly states (Ethic. i, 9). Therefore nothing besides  vision is required for happiness.    Obj. 2: Further, happiness is \"the most self-sufficient of all  goods,\" as the Philosopher declares (Ethic. i, 7). But that which  needs something else is not self-sufficient. Since then the essence  of happiness consists in seeing God, as stated above (Q. 3, A. 8);  it seems that delight is not necessary for happiness.    Obj. 3: Further, the \"operation of bliss or happiness should be  unhindered\" (Ethic. vii, 13). But delight hinders the operation of  the intellect: since it destroys the estimate of prudence (Ethic. vi,  5). Therefore delight is not necessary for happiness.    _On the contrary,_ Augustine says (Confess. x, 23) that happiness is  \"joy in truth.\"    _I answer that,_ One thing may be necessary for another in four ways.  First, as a preamble and preparation to it: thus instruction is  necessary for science. Secondly, as perfecting it: thus the soul is  necessary for the life of the body. Thirdly, as helping it from  without: thus friends are necessary for some undertaking. Fourthly,  as something attendant on it: thus we might say that heat is  necessary for fire. And in this way delight is necessary for  happiness. For it is caused by the appetite being at rest in the good  attained. Wherefore, since happiness is nothing else but the  attainment of the Sovereign Good, it cannot be without concomitant  delight.    Reply Obj. 1: From the very fact that a reward is given to anyone,  the will of him who deserves it is at rest, and in this consists  delight. Consequently, delight is included in the very"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17910"],[0,"The Mafulu: Mountain People of British New Guinea (#11)"],[1," out of small lengths about 5 or 6 inches long of the  original fibre, rolled together and added to from time to time until  the full length of 5 or 6 feet of thread had been made. The thread  was of the thickness of very coarse European thread or exceedingly  fine string. She next wound the thread into a triple loop of the size  of the proposed leg-band. This triple loop was to be the base upon  which she was to make the leg-band, of which it would form the first  line and upper edge. It was only about 11 inches in circumference, and  thus left two ends, one of which (I will call it \"the working thread\")  was a long one, and the other of which (I will call it \"the inside  thread\") was a short one. Both these threads hung down together from  the same point (which I will call \"the starting point\"). She then,  commencing at the starting point, worked the working thread round the  triple base by a series of interlacing loops in the form shown (very  greatly magnified) in Fig. 1; but the loops were drawn quite tight,  and not left loose, as, for the purpose of illustration, I have had to  make them in the figure. This process was carried round the base until  she had again reached the starting point, at which stage the base,  with its tightly drawn loop work all around it, was firm and strong,  and there were still the two ends of thread hanging from the starting  point. Here and at subsequent stages of the work she added to the  lengths of these two ends from time to time in the way above described  when they needed it, and the two ends of thread were therefore always  present. Then began the making of the second line. This was commenced  at the starting point, from which the two ends of thread hung,  and was effected by a series of loops made with the working thread  in the way already described, except that these loops, instead of  passing round the whole of the base line, passed through holes which  she bored with a thorn, as she went on, in the extreme bottom edge of  that line, and also that, in making this second line, she passed the  inside thread through each loop before she drew the latter tight; so  that the second line was itself composed of a single internal thread,  around which the loops were drawn. The second line was continued in  this way until she again reached the starting point (but, of course,  one line lower down), from which the two ends of thread hung down as  before. The third and following lines were made by a process identical  with that of the second one, the holes for each line being pricked  through the bottom of that above it. I did not see the completion of  the band, but I may say that the final line is similar to the second  and subsequent ones, and is not a triple-threaded line like the first  one. It was amazing to see this woman doing her work. She was an old  woman, but she did the whole of the work with her fingers, and she must  have had wonderful eyesight and steadiness of hand, as she made the  minute scarcely visible prick holes, and passed the end of her working  thread through them, with the utmost apparent ease and quickness.    The band thus produced is of very small, close, fine work, and is  quite soft, flexible and elastic, like European canvas, instead of  being stiff and hard, like the plaited belts and armlets. The band  is generally about an inch (more or less) in width. It is not dyed  or coloured in any way, but is often decorated with beads, which  are worked into the fabric in one or more horizontal lines, but as  a rule, I think, only at irregular intervals, and not in continuous  lines. These bands and anklets are seen in many of the plates. In  Plates 10, 11 and 12 the bead decorations are seen.    Dancing aprons are made out of bark cloth by both men and women,  but coloured by men only. The apron, which is worn at dances by women  only, is about 6 to 12 inches wide. It is worn, as shown in Plate 35,  in front of the body, being passed over the abdominal belt or a cord  so as to hang over it in two folds, one behind the other; and the  front fold, which is the part which shows (the back fold being more  or less concealed), and is generally 18 inches to 2 feet in length,  has at its base a fringe made by cutting the end of the cloth up into  strips, equal or unequal in width, the number of which may be only six  or less, or may be fifteen or twenty. The front fold is often wholly  or partly stained, the colour of the stain being usually yellow, and  is always more or less covered with a decorative design, the colours  of which are usually black and red. The back fold is generally stained  yellow, but never has any design upon it. The fringe is also usually  stained yellow, and is without design, except occasionally perhaps  a few horizontal lines of colour.    I may say here, as regards these colours, that, so far as my  observation went, the colours of the decorative patterns were always  black and red, and the general staining was always yellow; and indeed  the last-mentioned colour does not show up against the natural colour  of the cloth sufficiently clearly to adapt it for actual design  work. I am not, however, prepared to say that this allocation of  the colours is in fact an invariable one; and, as I know that red  is used for general staining of perineal bands and dancing ribbons,  it is possible that it, as well as yellow, is used for aprons.    Numerous variations of design are to be found in these garments;  and indeed I may say that it is in these and in the feather head  decorations that the Mafulu people mainly indulge such artistic powers  as they possess.    Plates 36 to 43 are examples of decoration of the front folds of  these dancing aprons [47]; and I give the following particulars  concerning them, first stating that, subject to what may appear in  my particulars, the darker lines and spots represent black ones in  the apron, and the lighter ones represent red ones.      Plate.  |       Average width of apron in inches.  |       |       Notes on ground staining and other matters.    36      6 1/2   Background of design unstained, but back fold of                  apron and fringe stained yellow.  37 [48] 7 3/4   Ditto    ditto      ditto  38      5 1/4   Only a little irregular yellow staining behind the                  design. Back fold of apron and fringe stained yellow.  39      6       Background of design (except fringe part) unstained,                  but back fold of apron and fringe stained yellow.  40      7       Background of upper (zig-zag) part of design unstained,                  but that of lower (rectangular) part and whole of                  back fold of apron and fringe stained yellow.  41      10 1/2  Faintly tinted broad horizontal and vertical lines                  and triangles in figure represent yellow stain. No                  other staining in the apron.  42      6 3/4   Background of design unstained, but back fold end of                  apron and fringe stained yellow.  43      6 3/4   No background staining in the apron. The smallness                  of the amount of decoration and the substitution of                  two tails for a fringe are, I think, unusual.      Dancing ribbons are made out of bark cloth by both men and women,  but are coloured by men only. These are worn by both men and women at  dances, the ribbons hanging round the body from the abdominal belt or a  cord, three or four or five of them being worn by one person, and one  of these commonly hanging in front. They are generally 2 or 3 inches  wide and about 4 feet long, but a portion of this length is required  for hitching the ribbon round the belt. I think their ornamentation  is confined to staining in transverse bands of alternating colour or  of one colour and unstained cloth. Plate 13, Fig. 4, illustrates the  colouring of two ribbons (each 2 inches wide), the alternation in one  case being red and yellow, and in the other red and unstained cloth;  and the men figured in Plate 70 are wearing ribbons, though they are  not very clearly shown in the plate.    The feather ornaments for the head, and especially those worn at  dances, and the feather ornaments worn on the back at dances present  such an enormous variety of colours and designs that it would be  impossible to describe them here without very greatly increasing the  length of the book. The ornaments are often very large, sometimes  containing eight or ten or even twelve rows of feathers, one behind  another. They can usually be distinguished from those made by the Mekeo  people by a general inferiority in design and make of the ornament as  a whole, the Mafulu people having less artistic skill in this respect  than the people of the lowlands. The ornaments include feathers of  parrots, cockatoos, hornbills, cassowaries, birds of paradise, bower  birds and some others. One never or rarely sees feathers of sea-birds,  or waterfowl, or Goura pigeons (which, I was told, are not found among  the mountains), as the Mafulu people in their trading with the people  of the plains take in exchange things which they cannot themselves  procure, rather than feathers, which are so plentiful with them.    The black cassowary feather is important in Mafulu as being the  special feather distinction of chiefs; but, though chiefs are as  a rule possessed of more and better ornaments than are the poorer  and unimportant people, they have no other special and distinctive  ornament.    Plates 44 and 45 illustrate some of these head feather ornaments. Plate  44, Fig. 1, shows an ornament made out of the brown fibrous exterior of  the wild betel-nut, black pigeon feathers and white cockatoo feathers,  the betel fibre and black pigeon feathers being, I was told, only  used in the mountains. Plate 44, Fig. 2, shows one made out of brown  feathers of young cassowary, white cockatoo feathers and red-black  parrot feathers. Plate 44, Fig. 3, shows one made out of bright red  and green"]]]
