[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15489"],[0,"Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis for Beginners (#11)"],[1," Thus  it is that for adults--for every sane person without exception--a  differentiation of the psychical matter has been fashioned which the  child knew not. A psychical procedure has been reached which, informed  by the experience of life, exercises with jealous power a dominating and  restraining influence upon psychical emotions; by its relation to  consciousness, and by its spontaneous mobility, it is endowed with the  greatest means of psychical power. A portion of the infantile emotions  has been withheld from this procedure as useless to life, and all the  thoughts which flow from these are found in the state of repression.    Whilst the procedure in which we recognize our normal ego reposes upon  the desire for sleep, it appears compelled by the psycho-physiological  conditions of sleep to abandon some of the energy with which it was wont  during the day to keep down what was repressed. This neglect is really  harmless; however much the emotions of the child's spirit may be  stirred, they find the approach to consciousness rendered difficult, and  that to movement blocked in consequence of the state of sleep. The  danger of their disturbing sleep must, however, be avoided. Moreover, we  must admit that even in deep sleep some amount of free attention is  exerted as a protection against sense-stimuli which might, perchance,  make an awakening seem wiser than the continuance of sleep. Otherwise we  could not explain the fact of our being always awakened by stimuli of  certain quality. As the old physiologist Burdach pointed out, the mother  is awakened by the whimpering of her child, the miller by the cessation  of his mill, most people by gently calling out their names. This  attention, thus on the alert, makes use of the internal stimuli arising  from repressed desires, and fuses them into the dream, which as a  compromise satisfies both procedures at the same time. The dream creates  a form of psychical release for the wish which is either suppressed or  formed by the aid of repression, inasmuch as it presents it as realized.  The other procedure is also satisfied, since the continuance of the  sleep is assured. Our ego here gladly behaves like a child; it makes the  dream pictures believable, saying, as it were, \"Quite right, but let me  sleep.\" The contempt which, once awakened, we bear the dream, and which  rests upon the absurdity and apparent illogicality of the dream, is  probably nothing but the reasoning of our sleeping ego on the feelings  about what was repressed; with greater right it should rest upon the  incompetency of this disturber of our sleep. In sleep we are now and  then aware of this contempt; the dream content transcends the censorship  rather too much, we think, \"It's only a dream,\" and sleep on.    It is no objection to this view if there are borderlines for the dream  where its function, to preserve sleep from interruption, can no longer  be maintained--as in the dreams of impending dread. It is here changed  for another function--to suspend the sleep at the proper time. It acts  like a conscientious night-watchman, who first does his duty by quelling  disturbances so as not to waken the citizen, but equally does his duty  quite properly when he awakens the street should the causes of the  trouble seem to him serious and himself unable to cope with them alone.    This function of dreams becomes especially well marked when there arises  some incentive for the sense perception. That the senses aroused during  sleep influence the dream is well known, and can be experimentally  verified; it is one of the certain but much overestimated results of the  medical investigation of dreams. Hitherto there has been an insoluble  riddle connected with this discovery. The stimulus to the sense by which  the investigator affects the sleeper is not properly recognized in the  dream, but is intermingled with a number of indefinite interpretations,  whose determination appears left to psychical free-will. There is, of  course, no such psychical free-will. To an external sense-stimulus the  sleeper can react in many ways. Either he awakens or he succeeds in  sleeping on. In the latter case he can make use of the dream to dismiss  the external stimulus, and this, again, in more ways than one. For  instance, he can stay the stimulus by dreaming of a scene which is  absolutely intolerable to him. This was the means used by one who was  troubled by a painful perineal abscess. He dreamt that he was on  horseback, and made use of the poultice, which was intended to  alleviate his pain, as a saddle, and thus got away from the cause of the  trouble. Or, as is more frequently the case, the external stimulus  undergoes a new rendering, which leads him to connect it with a  repressed desire seeking its realization, and robs him of its reality,  and is treated as if it were a part of the psychical matter. Thus, some  one dreamt that he had written a comedy which embodied a definite  _motif_; it was being performed; the first act was over amid  enthusiastic applause; there was great clapping. At this moment the  dreamer must have succeeded in prolonging his sleep despite the  disturbance, for when he woke he no longer heard the noise; he concluded  rightly that some one must have been beating a carpet or bed. The dreams  which come with a loud noise just before waking have all attempted to  cover the stimulus to waking by some other explanation, and thus to  prolong the sleep for a little while.    Whosoever has firmly accepted this _censorship_ as the chief motive for  the distortion of dreams will not be surprised to learn as the result of  dream interpretation that most of the dreams of adults are traced by  analysis to erotic desires. This assertion is not drawn from dreams  obviously of a sexual nature, which are known to all dreamers from their  own experience, and are the only ones usually described as \"sexual  dreams.\" These dreams are ever sufficiently mysterious by reason of the  choice of persons who are made the objects of sex, the removal of all  the barriers which cry halt to the dreamer's sexual needs in his waking  state, the many strange reminders as to details of what are called  perversions. But analysis discovers that, in many other dreams in whose  manifest content nothing erotic can be found, the work of interpretation  shows them up as, in reality, realization of sexual desires; whilst, on  the other hand, that much of the thought-making when awake, the thoughts  saved us as surplus from the day only, reaches presentation in dreams  with the help of repressed erotic desires.    Towards the explanation of this statement, which is no theoretical  postulate, it must be remembered that no other class of instincts has  required so vast a suppression at the behest of civilization as the  sexual, whilst their mastery by the highest psychical processes are in  most persons soonest of all relinquished. Since we have learnt to  understand _infantile sexuality_, often so vague in its expression, so  invariably overlooked and misunderstood, we are justified in saying that  nearly every civilized person has retained at some point or other the  infantile type of sex life; thus we understand that repressed infantile  sex desires furnish the most frequent and most powerful impulses for the  formation of dreams.[1]    If the dream, which is the expression of some erotic desire, succeeds in  making its manifest content appear innocently asexual, it is only  possible in one way. The matter of these sexual presentations cannot be  exhibited as such, but must be replaced by allusions, suggestions, and  similar indirect means; differing from other cases of indirect  presentation, those used in dreams must be deprived of direct  understanding. The means of presentation which answer these requirements  are commonly termed \"symbols.\" A special interest has been directed  towards these, since it has been observed that the dreamers of the same  language use the like symbols--indeed, that in certain cases community  of symbol is greater than community of speech. Since the dreamers do not  themselves know the meaning of the symbols they use, it remains a puzzle  whence arises their relationship with what they replace and denote. The  fact itself is undoubted, and becomes of importance for the technique of  the interpretation of dreams, since by the aid of a knowledge of this  symbolism it is possible to understand the meaning of the elements of a  dream, or parts of a dream, occasionally even the whole dream itself,  without having to question the dreamer as to his own ideas. We thus come  near to the popular idea of an interpretation of dreams, and, on the  other hand, possess again the technique of the ancients, among whom the  interpretation of dreams was identical with their explanation through  symbolism.    Though the study of dream symbolism is far removed from finality, we now  possess a series of general statements and of particular observations  which are quite certain. There are symbols which practically always have  the same meaning: Emperor and Empress (King and Queen) always mean the  parents; room, a woman[2], and so on. The sexes are represented by a  great variety of symbols, many of which would be at first quite  incomprehensible had not the clews to the meaning been often obtained  through other channels.    There are symbols of universal circulation, found in all dreamers, of  one range of speech and culture; there are others of the narrowest  individual significance which an individual has built up out of his own  material. In the first class those can be differentiated whose claim can  be at once recognized by the replacement of sexual things in common  speech (those, for instance, arising from agriculture, as reproduction,  seed) from others whose sexual references appear to reach back to the  earliest times and to the obscurest depths of our image-building. The  power of building symbols "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1549"],[0,"Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians (#11)"],[1,"saints might and do sin.    Samson, David, and many other excellent men, fell into grievous sins.  Job and Jeremiah cursed the day of their birth. Elijah and Jonah became  weary of life and prayed for death. Such offenses on the part of the  saints, the Scriptures record for the comfort of those who are near  despair. No person has ever sunk so low that he cannot rise again. On  the other hand, no man's standing is so secure that he may not fall. If  Peter fell, I may fall. If he rose again, I may rise again. We have the  same gifts that they had, the same Christ, the same baptism and the  same Gospel, the same forgiveness of sins. They needed these saving  ordinances just as much as we do.        VERSE 12. For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the    Gentiles.    The Gentiles who had been converted to faith in Christ, ate meats  forbidden by the Law. Peter, visiting some of these Gentiles, ate  meat and drank wine with them, although he knew that these things were  forbidden in the Law. Paul declared that he did likewise, that he became  as a Jew to the Jews, and to them that were without law, as without law.  He ate and drank with the Gentiles unconcerned about the Jewish Law.  When he was with the Jews, however, he abstained from all things  forbidden in the Law, for he labored to serve all men, that he \"might by  all means save some.\" Paul does not reprove Peter for transgressing the  Law, but for disguising his attitude to the Law.        VERSE 12. But when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself,    fearing them which were of the circumcision.    Paul does not accuse Peter of malice or ignorance, but of lack of  principle, in that he abstained from meats, because he feared the Jews  that came from James. Peter's weak attitude endangered the principle of  Christian liberty. It is the deduction rather than the fact which Paul  reproves. To eat and to drink, or not to eat and drink, is immaterial.  But to make the deduction \"If you eat, you sin; if you abstain you are  righteous\"--this is wrong.    Meats may be refused for two reasons. First, they may be refused for the  sake of Christian love. There is no danger connected with a refusal of  meats for the sake of charity. To bear with the infirmity of a  brother is a good thing. Paul himself taught and exemplified such  thoughtfulness. Secondly, meats may be refused in the mistaken hope of  thereby obtaining righteousness. When this is the purpose of abstaining  from meats, we say, let charity go. To refrain from meats for this  latter reason amounts to a denial of Christ. If we must lose one or the  other, let us lose a friend and brother, rather than God, our Father.    Jerome, who understood not this passage, nor the whole epistle for  that matter, excuses Peter's action on the ground \"that it was done  in ignorance.\" But Peter offended by giving the impression that he was  indorsing the Law. By his example he encouraged Gentiles and Jews to  forsake the truth of the Gospel. If Paul had not reproved him, there  would have been a sliding back of Christians into the Jewish religion,  and a return to the burdens of the Law.    It is surprising that Peter, excellent apostle that he was, should have  been guilty of such vacillation. In a former council at Jerusalem he  practically stood alone in defense of the truth that salvation is  by faith, without the Law. Peter at that time valiantly defended the  liberty of the Gospel. But now by abstaining from meats forbidden in the  Law, he went against his better judgment. You have no idea what danger  there is in customs and ceremonies. They so easily tend to error in  works.        VERSE 13. And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch    that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.    It is marvelous how God preserved the Church by one single person. Paul  alone stood up for the truth, for Barnabas, his companion, was lost to  him, and Peter was against him. Sometimes one lone person can do more in  a conference than the whole assembly.    I mention this to urge all to learn how properly to differentiate  between the Law and the Gospel, in order to avoid dissembling. When it  come to the article of justification we must not yield, if we want to  retain the truth of the Gospel.    When the conscience is disturbed, do not seek advice from reason or from  the Law, but rest your conscience in the grace of God and in His Word,  and proceed as if you had never heard of the Law. The Law has its place  and its own good time. While Moses was in the mountain where he talked  with God face to face, he had no law, he made no law, he administered  no law. But when he came down from the mountain, he was a lawgiver. The  conscience must be kept above the Law, the body under the Law.    Paul reproved Peter for no trifle, but for the chief article of  Christian doctrine, which Peter's hypocrisy had endangered. For Barnabas  and other Jews followed Peter's example. It is surprising that such good  men as Peter, Barnabas, and others should fall into unexpected error,  especially in a matter which they knew so well. To trust in our own  strength, our own goodness, our own wisdom, is a perilous thing. Let us  search the Scriptures with humility, praying that we may never lose the  light of the Gospel. \"Lord, increase our faith.\"        VERSE 14. But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to    the truth of the gospel.    No one except Paul had his eyes open. Consequently it was his duty  to reprove Peter and his followers for swerving from the truth of the  Gospel. It was no easy task for Paul to reprimand Peter. To the honor of  Peter it must be said that he took the correction. No doubt, he freely  acknowledged his fault.    The person who can rightly divide Law and Gospel has reason to thank  God. He is a true theologian. I must confess that in times of temptation  I do not always know how to do it. To divide Law and Gospel means to  place the Gospel in heaven, and to keep the Law on earth; to call the  righteousness of the Gospel heavenly, and the righteousness of the Law  earthly; to put as much difference between the righteousness of the  Gospel and that of the Law, as there is difference between day and  night. If it is a question of faith or conscience, ignore the Law  entirely. If it is a question of works, then lift high the lantern of  works and the righteousness of the Law. If your conscience is oppressed  with a sense of sin, talk to your conscience. Say: \"You are now  groveling in the dirt. You are now a laboring ass. Go ahead, and carry  your burden. But why don't you mount up to heaven? There the Law cannot  follow you!\" Leave the ass burdened with laws behind in the valley. But  your conscience, let it ascend with Isaac into the mountain.    In civil life obedience to the law is severely required. In civil life  Gospel, conscience, grace, remission of sins, Christ Himself, do  not count, but only Moses with the lawbooks. If we bear in mind this  distinction, neither Gospel nor Law shall trespass upon each other. The  moment Law and sin cross into heaven, i.e., your conscience, kick them  out. On the other hand, when grace wanders unto the earth, i.e., into  the body, tell grace: \"You have no business to be around the dreg and  dung of this bodily life. You belong in heaven.\"    By his compromising attitude Peter confused the separation of Law and  Gospel. Paul had to do something about it. He reproved Peter, not to  embarrass him, but to conserve the difference between the Gospel which  justifies in heaven, and the Law which justifies on earth.    The right separation between Law and Gospel is very important to know.  Christian doctrine is impossible without it. Let all who love and fear  God, diligently learn the difference, not only in theory but also in  practice.    When your conscience gets into trouble, say to yourself: \"There is a  time to die, and a time to live; a time to learn the Law, and a time  to unlearn the Law; a time to hear the Gospel, and a time to ignore the  Gospel. Let the Law now depart, and let the Gospel enter, for now is  the right time to hear the Gospel, and not the Law.\" However, when the  conflict of conscience is over and external duties must be performed,  close your ears to the Gospel, and open them wide to the Law.        VERSE 14. I said unto Peter before them all, If thou being a Jew, livest    after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest    thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews    To live as a Jew is nothing bad. To eat or not to eat pork, what  difference does it make? But to play the Jew, and for conscience' sake  to abstain from certain meats, is a denial of Christ. When Paul saw that  Peter's attitude tended to this, he withstood Peter and said to  him: \"You know that the observance of the Law is not needed unto  righteousness. You know that we are justified by faith in Christ.  You know that we may eat all kinds of meats. Yet by your example you  obligate the Gentiles to forsake Christ, and to return to the Law. You  give them reason to think that faith is not sufficient unto salvation.\"    Peter did not say so, but his example said quite plainly that the  observance of the Law must be added to faith in Christ, if men are to  be saved. From Peter's example the Gentiles could not help but draw the  conclusion that the Law was necessary unto salvation. If this error  had been permitted to pass unchallenged, Christ would have lost out  altogether.    The controversy involved the preservation of pure doctrine. In such a  controversy Paul did not mind if anybody took offense.        VERSE 15. We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles.    \"When we Jews compare ourselves with the Gentiles, we look pretty good.  We have the Law, we have good works. Our rectitude dates from our birth,  because the Jewish religion is natural to us. But all this does not  make us"]]]
