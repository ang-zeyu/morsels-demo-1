As rain fell from \"the waters above  the firmament\", the god of waters was also a sky and earth god.    The Indian Varuna was similarly a sky as well as an ocean god before  the theorizing and systematizing Brahmanic teachers relegated him to a  permanent abode at the bottom of the sea. It may be that Ea-Oannes and  Varuna were of common origin.    Another Babylonian deity, named Dagan, is believed to be identical  with Ea. His worship was certainly of great antiquity. \"Hammurabi\",  writes Professor Pinches, \"seems to speak of the Euphrates as being  'the boundary of Dagan', whom he calls his creator. In later  inscriptions the form Daguna, which approaches nearer to the West  Semitic form (Dagon of the Philistines), is found in a few personal  names.[39]    It is possible that the Philistine deity Dagon was a specialized form  of ancient Ea, who was either imported from Babylonia or was a sea god  of more than one branch of the Mediterranean race. The authorities are  at variance regarding the form and attributes of Dagan. Our knowledge  regarding him is derived mainly from the Bible. He was a national  rather than a city god. There are references to a Beth-dagon[40],  \"house or city of Dagon\"; he had also a temple at Gaza, and Samson  destroyed it by pulling down the two middle pillars which were its  main support.[41] A third temple was situated in Ashdod. When the  captured ark of the Israelites was placed in it the image of Dagon  \"fell on his face\", with the result that \"the head of Dagon and both  the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump  of Dagon was left\".[42] A further reference to \"the threshold of  Dagon\" suggests that the god had feet like Ea-Oannes. Those who hold  that Dagon had a fish form derive his name from the Semitic \"dag = a  fish\", and suggest that after the idol fell only the fishy part (dago)  was left. On the other hand, it was argued that Dagon was a corn god,  and that the resemblance between the words Dagan and Dagon are  accidental. Professor Sayce makes reference in this connection to a  crystal seal from Phoenicia in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, bearing  an inscription which he reads as Baal-dagon. Near the name is an ear  of corn, and other symbols, such as the winged solar disc, a gazelle,  and several stars, but there is no fish. It may be, of course, that  Baal-dagon represents a fusion of deities. As we have seen in the case  of Ea-Oannes and the deities of Mendes, a fish god may also be a corn  god, a land animal god and a god of ocean and the sky. The offering of  golden mice representing \"your mice that mar the land\",[43] made by  the Philistines, suggests that Dagon was the fertilizing harvest god,  among other things, whose usefulness had been impaired, as they  believed, by the mistake committed of placing the ark of Israel in the  temple at Ashdod. The Philistines came from Crete, and if their Dagon  was imported from that island, he may have had some connection with  Poseidon, whose worship extended throughout Greece. This god of the  sea, who is somewhat like the Roman Neptune, carried a lightning  trident and caused earthquakes. He was a brother of Zeus, the sky and  atmosphere deity, and had bull and horse forms. As a horse he pursued  Demeter, the earth and corn goddess, and, like Ea, he instructed  mankind, but especially in the art of training horses. In his train  were the Tritons, half men, half fishes, and the water fairies, the  Nereids. Bulls, boars, and rams were offered to this sea god of  fertility. Amphitrite was his spouse.    An obscure god Shony, the Oannes of the Scottish Hebrides, received  oblations from those who depended for their agricultural prosperity on  his gifts of fertilizing seaweed. He is referred to in Martin's  _Western Isles_, and is not yet forgotten. The Eddic sea god Njord of  Noatun was the father of Frey, the harvest god. Dagda, the Irish corn  god, had for wife Boann, the goddess of the river Boyne. Osiris and  Isis of Egypt were associated with the Nile. The connection between  agriculture and the water supply was too obvious to escape the early  symbolists, and many other proofs of this than those referred to could  be given.    Ea's \"faithful spouse\" was the goddess Damkina, who was also called  Nin-ki, \"lady of the earth\". \"May Ea make thee glad\", chanted the  priests. \"May Damkina, queen of the deep, illumine thee with her  countenance; may Merodach (Marduk), the mighty overseer of the Igigi  (heavenly spirits), exalt thy head.\" Merodach was their son: in time  he became the Bel, or \"Lord\", of the Babylonian pantheon.    Like the Indian Varuna, the sea god, Ea-Oannes had control over the  spirits and demons of the deep. The \"ferryman\" who kept watch over the  river of death was called Arad-Ea, \"servant of Ea\". There are also  references to sea maidens, the Babylonian mermaids, or Nereids. We  have a glimpse of sea giants, which resemble the Indian Danavas and  Daityas of ocean, in the chant:        Seven are they, seven are they,      In the ocean deep seven are they,      Battening in heaven seven are they,      Bred in the depths of ocean....      Of these seven the first is the south wind,      The second a dragon with mouth agape....[44]    A suggestion of the Vedic Vritra and his horde of monsters.    These seven demons were also \"the messengers of Anu\", who, although  specialized as a sky god in more than one pantheon, appears to have  been closely associated with Ea in the earliest Sumerian period. His  name, signifying \"the high one\", is derived from \"ana\", \"heaven\"; he  was the city god of Erech (Uruk). It is possible that he was developed  as an atmospheric god with solar and lunar attributes. The seven  demons, who were his messengers, recall the stormy Maruts, the  followers of Indra. They are referred to as        Forcing their way with baneful windstorms,      Mighty destroyers, the deluge of the storm god,      Stalking at the right hand of the storm god.[45]    When we deal with a deity in his most archaic form it is difficult to  distinguish him from a demon. Even the beneficent Ea is associated  with monsters and furies. \"Evil spirits\", according to a Babylonian  chant, were \"the bitter venom of the gods\". Those attached to a deity  as \"attendants\" appear to represent the original animistic group from  which he evolved. In each district the character of the deity was  shaped to accord with local conditions.    At Nippur, which was situated on the vague and shifting boundary line  between Sumer and Akkad, the chief god was Enlil, whose name is  translated \"lord of mist\", \"lord of might\", and \"lord of demons\" by  various authorities. He was a storm god and a war god, and \"lord of  heaven and earth \", like Ea and Anu. An atmospheric deity, he shares  the attributes of the Indian Indra, the thunder and rain god, and  Vayu, the wind god; he also resembles the Semitic Adad or Rimman, who  links with the Hittite Tarku. All these are deities of tempest and the  mountains--Wild Huntsmen in the Raging Host. The name of Enlil's  temple at Nippur has been translated as \"mountain house\", or \"like a  mountain\", and the theory obtained for a time that the god must  therefore have been imported by a people from the hills. But as the  ideogram for \"mountain\" and \"land\" was used in the earliest times, as  King shows, with reference to foreign countries,[46] it is more  probable that Enlil was exalted as a world god who had dominion over  not only Sumer and Akkad, but also the territories occupied by the  rivals and enemies of the early Babylonians.    Enlil is known as the \"older Bel\" (lord), to distinguish him from Bel  Merodach of Babylon. He was the chief figure in a triad in which he  figured as earth god, with Anu as god of the sky and Ea as god of the  deep. This classification suggests that Nippur had either risen in  political importance and dominated the cities of Erech and Eridu, or  that its priests were influential at the court of a ruler who was the  overlord of several city states.    Associated with Bel Enlil was Beltis, later known as \"Beltu--the  lady\". She appears to be identical with the other great goddesses,  Ishtar, Nana, Zerpanitu^m, &c., a \"Great Mother\", or consort of an  early god with whom she was equal in power and dignity.    In the later systematized theology of the Babylonians we seem to trace  the fragments of a primitive mythology which was vague in outline, for  the deities were not sharply defined, and existed in groups. Enneads  were formed in Egypt by placing a local god at the head of a group of  eight elder deities. The sun god Ra was the chief figure of the  earliest pantheon of this character at Heliopolis, while at Hermopolis  the leader was the lunar god Thoth. Professor Budge is of opinion that  \"both the Sumerians and the early Egyptians derived their primeval  gods from some common but exceedingly ancient source\", for he finds in  the Babylonian and Nile valleys that there is a resemblance between  two early groups which \"seems to be too close to be accidental\".[47]    The Egyptian group comprises four pairs of vague gods and  goddesses--Nu and his consort Nut, Hehu and his consort Hehut, Kekui  and his consort Kekuit, and Kerh and his consort Kerhet. \"Man always  has fashioned\", he says, \"and probably always will fashion, his god or  gods in his own image, and he has always, having reached a certain  stage in development, given to his gods wives and offspring; but the  nature of the position taken by the wives of the gods depends upon the  nature of the position of women in the households of those who write  the legends and the traditions of the gods. The gods of the oldest  company in Egypt were, the writer believes, invented by people in  whose households women held a high position, and among whom they  possessed more power than is usually the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16658"],[0,"Piano and Song (#11)"],[1,"that; but how are your  daughters able to play so many pieces to people, and moreover without  notes, if they have not been obliged to practise all day long, and if  you have not been very cruel with them, while my Lizzie cannot play a  single thing without bungling?    DOMINIE. Allow me, madam, it must be the fault of Mr. Shep--    MRS. S. No, no! you must excuse me, but we don't permit any reflections  on our Mr. Shepard: he is very particular and unwearied.    DOMINIE. It does not depend entirely upon that, but--    JOHN S. Upon my honor, it is marvellous to see how talented pupils  always seem to flock to _you_. It is easy to teach such! Ha, ha! You  must not forget, however, that my grandfather played on the organ. Now,  Lizzie, sit down and play something.         (_She chooses a cavatina from \"The Pirates,\" with variations. The       introduction begins with _e_ flat in unison. Lizzie strikes _e_ in       unison and the same in the bass, and exclaims: \"There, mamma,       didn't I tell you so? I don't remember it now.\" Mr. Shepard enters,       steps up hastily, and puts her finger on _e_ flat._)    SHEPARD. Pardon me, Herr Dominie, I will only set her going: it makes  her a little confused to play before such connoisseurs; she loses her  eyesight. Don't you see, Lizzie, there are three flats in the signature?    JOHN S. Courage now! Aha! Lizzie can't get at the pedal, the bull-dog  is lying over it. John, take him out.         (_After the removal of the bull-dog, Lizzie plays as far as the       fourth bar, when she strikes _c_ sharp instead of _c_, and stops._)    MRS. S. Never mind, begin again. Herr Dominie is pleased to hear that:  he has gone through it all with his own children.         (_Lizzie begins again at the beginning, and goes on to the eighth       bar, where she sticks fast._)    SHEPARD. Don't make me ashamed of you, Lizzie. Now begin once more: a  week ago it went quite tolerably.         (_Lizzie begins once more, and plays or rather scrambles through       it, as far as the eighteenth bar; but now it is all over with her,       and she gets up._)    DOMINIE. Skip the introduction, it is too difficult: begin at once on  the theme.    JOHN S. (_to his wife_). We will go away and leave the gentlemen alone.  By and by, gentlemen, we will talk about it further over a cup of tea.         (_Lizzie refuses to play._)    DOMINIE. Mr. Shepard, let Lizzie play a few scales or some chords; a few  finger exercises, or some easy dance without notes.    SHEPARD. She has nothing of that kind ready. You see I always take up  one piece after another, and have each one played as well as I can; she  repeats the difficult parts, I write the proper fingering over them, and  am very particular that she does not use the wrong fingers. I have taken  a great deal of pains, and quite worn myself out over the lessons.  Lizzie does the same, and practises her pieces two hours a day;  but--but--         (_Lizzie goes away with Emma._)    DOMINIE. Mr. Shepard, with the best intentions in the world, you will  never accomplish your end. Even if Miss Lizzie is only to play as an  amateur, and is not intended for any thing higher, for which in fact she  has not sufficient talent, you must pay some attention beforehand to the  acquirement of a correct tone, and get rid of this robin-red-breast  touch; and you must then endeavor, by scales and exercises of every  kind, to give to her hands and fingers so much firmness, decision, and  dexterity, that she can master her pieces, at least with a certain  distinct tone and a tolerable touch. You are not less in error in the  choice of her pieces, which are far too difficult,--a fault of most  teachers, even with the most skilful pupils. The pieces which your  pupils are to execute should be below their mechanical powers; for,  otherwise, the struggle with difficulties robs the player of all  confidence in the performance, and gives rise to stumbling, bungling,  and hurry. The mechanical powers should be cultivated by studies and  exercises, in preference to pieces, at least to those of certain famous  composers, who do not write in a manner adapted to the piano; or who, at  any rate, regard the music as of more importance than the player. This  may apply even to Beethoven, in the higher grade of composition; for his  music is full of danger for the performer. The only course which can  ever lead to a sure result, without wearying both pupil and parent, and  without making piano-playing distasteful, is first to lay a foundation  in mechanical power, and then to go on with the easier pieces by Huenten  and Burgmueller. If you try to produce the mechanical dexterity essential  for piano performance by the study of pieces, except with the most  careful selection, you will waste a great deal of time and deprive the  pupil of all pleasure and interest; and the young Lizzie will be much  more interested in the hope of a husband than in the satisfaction of  performing a piece which will give pleasure to herself and her friends.  There can be no success without gradual development and culture, without  a plan, without consideration and reflection,--in fact, without a  proper method. How can there be any good result, if the pupil has to try  at the same time to play with a correct touch, with the proper  fingering, in time, with proper phrasing, to move the fingers rightly,  to gain familiarity with the notes, and to avoid the confusion between  the treble and the bass notes,--and in fact has to struggle with every  thing at once? And what vexations! what loss of time without success!         (_Shepard listened with attention, and a light seemed to dawn upon       him._)         (_Dominie and Shepard go in to tea._)    MRS. S. Well, gentlemen, have you come to any conclusion? Is not Lizzie  a good pupil? She is obliged to practise two hours every day, however  tired she may be. Do you think we should continue in the same course,  Herr Dominie?    SHEPARD. Herr Dominie has called my attention to some points which will  be of use to me.    DOMINIE. Only a few trifles.    JOHN S. After tea will not Miss Emma play to us?    EMMA. The piano is very much out of tune, some of the keys stick, the  action is too light, and the instrument generally is not calculated for  the successful execution of any thing.    JOHN S. I beg your pardon: it was considered by everybody a very fine  instrument when we bought it, sixteen years ago. We had a great bargain  in it at the time, for we purchased it of a neighbor who had improved it  very much by use. Mr. Shepard will confirm what I say, Miss.         (_Emma bows her head thoughtfully, and looks at Shepard       suspiciously._)    JOHN S. My violin has very much improved during the last twenty years.  On my honor, if Lizzie were a boy, she should learn to play on the  violin, to keep it in the family. Ha, ha, ha!    DOMINIE. That would be curious!         (_Dominie wishes to take leave with his daughter._)    MRS. S. (_condescendingly_). I hope you will come to see us again soon.  The next time Lizzie will play you Rosellen's \"Tremolo;\" and Miss Emma  must play us a piece too.    DOMINIE. You are extremely kind! (_Takes leave._)          CHAPTER VIII.    SINGING AND SINGING-TEACHERS.      _(A Letter to a Young Lady Singer.)_    MY DEAR MISS ----,--You are endowed with an admirable gift for singing,  and your agreeable though not naturally powerful voice has vivacity and  youthful charm, as well as a fine tone: you also possess much talent in  execution; yet you nevertheless share the lot of almost all your sisters  in art, who, whether in Vienna, Paris, or Italy, find only teachers who  are rapidly helping to annihilate the opera throughout Europe, and are  ruling out of court the simple, noble, refined, and true art of singing.  This modern, unnatural style of art, which merely aspires to superficial  effects, and consists only in mannerisms, and which must ruin the voice  in a short time, before it reaches its highest perfection, has already  laid claim to you. It is scarcely possible to rescue your talent,  unless, convinced that you have been falsely guided, you stop entirely  for a time, and allow your voice to rest during several months, and  then, by correct artistic studies, and with a voice never forced or  strong, often indeed weak, you improve your method of attack by the use  of much less and never audible breathing, and acquire a correct, quiet  guidance of the tones. You must also make use of the voice in the middle  register, and strengthen the good head-tones by skilfully lowering them;  you must equalize the registers of the voice by a correct and varied use  of the head-tones, and by diligent practice of _solfeggio_. You must  restore the unnaturally extended registers to their proper limits; and  you have still other points to reform. Are you not aware that this  frequent tremulousness of the voice, this immoderate forcing of its  compass, by which the chest-register is made to interfere with the  head-tones, this coquetting with the deep chest-tones, this affected,  offensive, and almost inaudible nasal _pianissimo_, the aimless jerking  out of single tones, and, in general, this whole false mode of vocal  execution, must continually shock the natural sentiment of a cultivated,  unprejudiced hearer, as well as of the composer and singing-teacher?  What must be the effect on a voice in the middle register, when its  extreme limits are forced in such a reckless manner, and when you expend  as much breath for a few lines of a song as a correctly educated singer  would require for a whole aria? How long will it be before your voice,  already weakened, and almost always forced beyond the limits of beauty,  shall degenerate into a hollow, dull, guttural tone, and even into that  explosive or tremulous sound, which proclaims irremediable injury? Is  your beautiful voice and your talent to disappear like a meteor, as  others have"]]]
