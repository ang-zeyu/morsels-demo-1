It  succeeded in this, and when, at the end of October, the battle of  Flanders opened, when the Germans, having completed the concentration of  their forces, attempted with fierce energy to turn or to pierce our  left, they flung themselves upon a resistance which inflicted upon them  a complete defeat.      DEPLOYMENT OF A FIRST ARMY.    The movement began on our side only with the resources of the army which  had held the left of our front during the battle of the Marne,  reinforced on Sept. 15 by one army corps.    This reinforcement, not being sufficient to hold the enemy's offensive,  (district of Vaudelincourt-Mouchy-Uaugy,) a fresh army was transported  more to the left, with the task \"of acting against the German right wing  in order to disengage its neighbor, ... while preserving a flanking  direction in its march in relation to the fresh units that the enemy  might be able to put into line.\"    To cover the detrainments of this fresh army in the district  Clermont-Beauvais-Boix a cavalry corps and four territorial divisions  were ordered to establish themselves on both banks of the Somme. In the  wooded hills, however, which extend between the Oise and Lassigny the  enemy displayed increasing activity. Nevertheless, the order still  further to broaden the movement toward the left was maintained, while  the territorial divisions were to move toward Bethune and Aubigny. The  march to the sea went on.    From the 21st to the 26th all our forces were engaged in the district  Lassigny-Roye-Peronne, with alternations of reverse and success. It was  the first act of the great struggle which was to spread as it went on.  On the 26th the whole of the Sixth German Army was deployed against us.  We retained all our positions, but we could do no more; consequently  there was still the risk that the enemy, by means of a fresh afflux of  forces, might succeed in turning us.    Once more reinforcements, two army corps, were directed no longer on  Beauvais, but toward Amiens. The front was then again to extend. A fresh  army was constituted more to the north.      DEPLOYMENT OF THE SECOND ARMY.    From Sept. 30 onward we could not but observe that the enemy, already  strongly posted on the plateau of Thiepval, was continually slipping  his forces from south to north, and everywhere confronting us with  remarkable energy.    Accordingly, on Oct. 1 two cavalry corps were directed to make a leap  forward and, operating on both banks of the Scarpe, to put themselves in  touch with the garrison of Dunkirk, which, on its side, had pushed  forward as far as Douai. But on Oct. 2 and 3 the bulk of our fresh army  was very strongly attacked in the district of Arras and Lens.  Confronting it were two corps of cavalry, the guards, four active army  corps, and two reserve corps. A fresh French army corps was immediately  transported and detrained in the Lille district.    But once more the attacks became more pressing, and on Oct. 4 it was a  question whether, in view of the enemy's activity both west of the Oise  and south of the Somme, and also further to the north, a retreat would  not have to be made. General Joffre resolutely put this hypothesis aside  and ordered the offensive to be resumed with the reinforcements that had  arrived. It was, however, clear that, despite the efforts of all, our  front, extended to the sea as it was by a mere ribbon of troops, did not  possess the solidity to enable it to resist with complete safety a  German attack, the violence of which could well be foreseen.    In the Arras district the position was fairly good. But between the Oise  and Arras we were holding our own only with difficulty. Finally, to the  north, on the Lille-Estaires-Merville-Hazebrouck-Cassel front, our  cavalry and our territorials had their work cut out against eight  divisions of German cavalry, with very strong infantry supports. It was  at this moment that the transport of the British Army to the northern  theatre of operations began.    [Illustration: VICE ADMIRAL H.R.H. THE DUKE OF THE ABRUZZI    Cousin of the King of Italy, Commander of the dreadnought squadron of  the Italian Navy.    _(Photo (c) by Pach Bros., N.Y.)_]    [Illustration: H.M. FERDINAND I.    Tsar of the Bulgars.    _(Photo from P.S. Rogers.)_]      THE TRANSPORT OF THE BRITISH ARMY.    Field Marshal French had, as early as the end of September, expressed  the wish to see his army resume its initial place on the left of the  allied armies. He explained this wish on the ground of the greater  facility of which his communications would have the advantage in this  new position, and also of the impending arrival of two divisions of  infantry from home and of two infantry divisions and a cavalry division  from India, which would be able to deploy more easily on that terrain.  In spite of the difficulties which such a removal involved, owing to the  intensive use of the railways by our own units, General Joffre decided  at the beginning of October to meet the Field Marshal's wishes and to  have the British Army removed from the Aisne.    It was clearly specified that on the northern terrain the British Army  should co-operate to the same end as ourselves, the stopping of the  German right. In other terms, the British Army was to prolong the front  of the general disposition without a break, attacking as soon as  possible, and at the same time seeking touch with the Belgian Army.    But the detraining took longer than had been expected, and it was not  possible to attack the Germans during the time when they had only  cavalry in the Lille district and further to the north.      THE ARRIVAL OF THE BELGIAN ARMY.    There remained the Belgian Army. On leaving Antwerp on Oct. 9 the  Belgian Army, which was covered by 8,000 British bluejackets and 6,000  French bluejackets, at first intended to retire as far as to the north  of Calais, but afterwards determined to make a stand in Belgian  territory. Unfortunately, the condition of the Belgian troops, exhausted  by a struggle of more than three months, did not allow any immediate  hopes to be based upon them. This situation weighed on our plans and  delayed their execution.    On the 16th we made progress to the east of Ypres. On the 18th our  cavalry even reached Roulers and Cortemark. But it was now evident that,  in view of the continual reinforcing of the German right, our left was  not capable of maintaining the advantages obtained during the previous  few days. To attain our end and make our front inviolable a fresh effort  was necessary. That effort was immediately made by the dispatch to the  north of the Lys of considerable French forces, which formed the French  Army of Belgium.      THE FRENCH ARMY OF BELGIUM.    The French Army of Belgium consisted, to begin with, of two territorial  divisions, four divisions of cavalry, and a naval brigade. Directly  after its constitution it was strengthened by elements from other points  on the front whose arrival extended from Oct. 27 to Nov. 11. These  reinforcements were equivalent altogether in value to five army corps, a  division of cavalry, a territorial division, and sixteen regiments of  cavalry, plus sixty pieces of heavy artillery.    Thus was completed the strategic manoeuvre defined by the instructions  of the General in Chief on Sept. 11 and developed during the five  following weeks with the ampleness we have just seen. The movements of  troops carried out during this period were methodically combined with  the pursuit of operations, both defensive and offensive, from the Oise  to the North Sea.    On Oct. 22 our left, bounded six weeks earlier by the Noyon district,  rested on Nieuport, thanks to the successive deployment of five fresh  armies--three French armies, the British Army, and the Belgian Army.    Thus the co-ordination decided upon by the General in Chief attained its  end. The barrier was established. It remained to maintain it against the  enemy's offensive. That was the object and the result of the battle of  Flanders, Oct. 22 to Nov. 15.      OPERATIONS IN FLANDERS.    _The fourth installment of the French review takes up the operations in  Flanders, as follows:_    The German attack in Flanders was conducted strategically and tactically  with remarkable energy. The complete and indisputable defeat in which it  resulted is therefore significant.    The forces of which the enemy disposed for this operation between the  sea and the Lys comprised:    (1) The entire Fourth Army commanded by the Duke of Wuerttemberg,  consisting of one naval division, one division of Ersatz Reserve, (men  who had received no training before the war,) which was liberated by the  fall of Antwerp; the Twenty-second, Twenty-third, Twenty-sixth and  Twenty-seventh Reserve Corps, and the Forty-eighth Division belonging to  the Twenty-fourth Reserve Corps.    (2) A portion of another army under General von Fabeck, consisting of  the Fifteenth Corps, two Bavarian corps and three (unspecified)  divisions.    (3) Part of the Sixth Army under the command of the Crown Prince of  Bavaria. This army, more than a third of which took part in the battle  of Flanders, comprised the Nineteenth Army Corps, portions of the  Thirteenth Corps and the Eighteenth Reserve Corps, the Seventh and  Fourteenth Corps, the First Bavarian Reserve Corps, the Guards, and the  Fourth Army Corps.    (4) Four highly mobile cavalry corps prepared and supported the action  of the troops enumerated above. Everything possible had been done to  fortify the \"morale\" of the troops. At the beginning of October the  Crown Prince of Bavaria in a proclamation had exhorted his soldiers \"to  make the decisive effort against the French left wing,\" and \"to settle  thus the fate of the great battle which has lasted for weeks.\"    [Illustration: Map showing the swaying battle line from Belfort to the  North Sea and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15480"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 3, June, 1915 (#11)"],[1,"of both these policies  may be removed.    The situation is basically triangular and it is difficult to see how the  settlement of our difficulties with Germany can escape involving at the  same time the rectification of Great Britain's methods of dealing with  the trade between neutral countries and her adversaries. It is but a  step from the position of mediator in a question of this sort to that of  mediator in the larger questions which make for war or peace. I believe  that the note contains the hopeful sign that these things may come to  pass.    The possibilities are there and the President, I am confident, will  overlook no possibility of advancing the cause of an early return of  peace to Europe nor leave any unturned stone to free this country of the  dangers and inconveniences which have become the concomitants of the  European struggle. Out of the troubled waters of our present relations  with Germany may thus come a great and, we may hope, a lasting good.  Should this happily be the case, the wisdom of the President will have  been confirmed and the thankfulness of the nation secured to him. On the  other hand, should his pacific hand be forced by those who wax fat and  wealthy on strife and the end should be disaster untold to the country,  he will still have the consolation of having fought a good battle and of  knowing that he was worsted only by the irresistible force of demagogy  in this country or abroad.    The subject with which the note deals is one of the same paramount  importance to Germany as it is to this country, and we must wait in  patience for Germany's reply; and I, for one, shall wait in the  confidence that when it is received it will be found to offer a basis  for a friendly solution of the questions which exist between Germany and  the United States and, not unlikely, for those further steps which I  have intimated.    _Under the caption \"A Word of Earnest Advice,\" the evening edition of  the New Yorker Staats-Zeitung on May 14 issued the following warning to  Germans and German-Americans:_    The times are grave--even very grave.... A conflict between America and  the old Fatherland is threatening. Such a conflict must rend the heart  of every German-American who has acquired the rights of citizenship  here, who has founded a new career for himself and brought up his  children.    It is probably unnecessary to give any advice to the American citizens  among our readers in regard to their conduct in this grave time. A  series of years must pass before an immigrant can obtain his  citizenship papers; nobody is forced to become a citizen. Of the man who  has voluntarily become a citizen of the United States we may therefore  expect that he knows the conditions here obtaining the institutions of  the country of his adoption, as well as his rights and duties. But there  are thousands upon thousands of our readers who are not citizens, and to  them a serious word of advice shall now be addressed. In the grave time  of the conflict let efforts be made to avoid every personal conflict. It  is not necessarily cowardly to deny one's descent, but it is not  necessary, either, to make demonstrations.    Where there is life there is hope. The hope still is entertained that  the conflict will be eliminated, that the bond of friendship between  Germany and America will not be torn. Through thoughtless Hotspurs, who  allow themselves to be carried away by excitement and do not dam up the  flood of their eloquence, much mischief can be done. Keeping away from  the public places where the excited groups congregate and discuss the  burning questions of the day must be urgently recommended. It was for  many a sport to participate in these discussions, and with more or less  skill, but always energetically to champion the German cause.    The American is in general very liberal in regard to expression of  opinion. He likes to hear also the \"other side,\" but it must not be  forgotten that in times of conflict the \"other side\" may be regarded as  the \"enemy side.\" What has heretofore sounded harmless may now be  interpreted as a criticism made against the United States. But the  American as a rule repels a criticism made by strangers against the  affairs of his own country. Through heated discussions and unwise  demonstrations nothing is at present to be achieved but much can be  spoiled.    Grave times!    Calmness is now the first duty of citizenship--for all non-citizens.    But whoever is a citizen--he would be doing well in any event to stay  away from the streets and squares where the noisy ones congregate.    There are very many Germans whose motto here, too, is: \"We Germans fear  God and nothing else in the world.\" But whoever bellows that into the  ears of hundreds of persons of hostile mind in the public market place  is either a fool or--weary of life.    In submarine warfare the Germans may be superior to the British, but in  undermining the latter are superior to the former. They have now  succeeded in undermining the friendship between Uncle Sam and the  Deutsche Michel. Let us hope that the fuse can be extinguished before  the explosion follows.    _Charles Neumeyer, editor of The Louisville (Ky.) Anzeiger, in a  dispatch on May 14 to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES, _said of President Wilson's  note:_    The American note to Berlin evidences the desire of the President to  hold Germany to strict accountability for the loss of American lives in  the Lusitania disaster. This proceeding on the part of the American  Government is eminently just and proper. If the President had failed to  hold Germany to strict accountability he would have failed of his  official duty. The President's forceful action cannot be but of salutary  effect in this country also. It gives the American people the assurance  that the Government at Washington is prepared and ready for the  protection of American citizens wherever they may chance to be.    There was a time when the Government did not resort to very vigorous  measures in this respect. American citizens while traveling abroad were  frequently subject to insult and violence, and the authorities at  Washington seemingly paid little heed to complaints. The result was that  the American citizen abroad was not held in that respect which emanates  from the knowledge that his home Government is prepared to go to the  length of its ability, if necessary, to accord him protection.    One or two of the demands formulated against Germany do not meet with  our approval. The President demands a cessation of German submarine  warfare on merchant vessels, but while the interruption of the  starvation plan adopted by England against the civil population is urged  upon the latter it will continue. The starvation plan is primarily being  waged against the weak and helpless, and is, therefore, responsible. It  is also in violation of the spirit if not the letter of international  law. If the President can force a demand for the cessation of the  submarine warfare, he ought also to have the right to demand the lifting  of the starvation blockade. The tragedy was chiefly due to either  stupidity or design on the part of the British Admiralty in failing to  afford proper protection to the ship. While we do not agree with the  President on some points in his note, we repose the fullest confidence  in his patriotism as well as his deliberate judgment as giving assurance  that, whatever the outcome, the case of the American people rests in  trustworthy hands.    The people should by their action spare him unnecessary embarrassment  and rely for a satisfactory solution of the grave questions confronting  us on his patriotism and honesty.    _A dispatch on May 14 to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES _from Max Burgheim, editor  of the Freie Presse of Cincinnati, Ohio, reads:_    The part of the note referring to the Lusitania catastrophe had better  been directed to London. England, not Germany, is responsible for the  destruction of the Lusitania. England, through the violation of the  rights of nations and the brutal threat to starve 70,000,000 Germans,  has forced Germany to a policy against English commerce of which the  Lusitania was a victim. Germany declared to our President her  willingness to stop submarine warfare if England would allow the  importation of food for the German civil population. England  contemptuously cast aside the President's mediation.    It has not yet been proved that submarine warfare is not in keeping with  international law. Distinguished authorities on international law have  declared that Germany was not only justified but bound to adopt this  method in the hour of need, because it is the only effective defense  against England's warfare. Germany cannot cease this warfare unless she  wishes to surrender with tied hands to a ruthless enemy. All we can  justly ask of Germany is that neutral ships be not attacked, and that  damages be paid in case of loss through mistakes. Germany has already  agreed to this.          Falaba, Cushing, Gulflight      CASE OF THE FALABA.    _A Washington dispatch to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES _on March 31, 1915,  reported that the records of the State Department's Passport Bureau show  that a passport was issued on June 1, 1911, to Leon Chester Thrasher, a  passenger aboard the British African steamship Falaba, which was  torpedoed by a German submarine in the \"zone of naval warfare\" on March  28. The American citizenship of Thrasher, who was drowned, has been  established._    [Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES.]    LONDON, Wednesday, March 31.--An American citizen, Leon Chester  Thrasher, an engineer, was among the victims of the German submarine  that sank the British steamer Falaba in St. George's Channel last Sunday  with a loss of 111 lives.
