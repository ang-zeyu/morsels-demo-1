If he keep faithfully busy each hour of the working day, he may  safely leave the final result to itself. He can with perfect certainty  count on waking up some fine morning to find himself one of the  competent ones of his generation, in whatever pursuit he may have  singled out. Silently, between all the details of his business, the  _power of judging_ in all that class of matter will have built itself up  within him as a possession that will never pass away. Young people  should know this truth in advance. The ignorance of it has probably  engendered more discouragement and faint-heartedness in youths embarking  on arduous careers than all other causes put together.          IX. THE ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS      In my last talk, in treating of Habit, I chiefly had in mind our _motor_  habits,--habits of external conduct. But our thinking and feeling  processes are also largely subject to the law of habit, and one result  of this is a phenomenon which you all know under the name of 'the  association of ideas.' To that phenomenon I ask you now to turn.    You remember that consciousness is an ever-flowing stream of objects,  feelings, and impulsive tendencies. We saw already that its phases or  pulses are like so many fields or waves, each field or wave having  usually its central point of liveliest attention, in the shape of the  most prominent object in our thought, while all around this lies a  margin of other objects more dimly realized, together with the margin of  emotional and active tendencies which the whole entails. Describing the  mind thus in fluid terms, we cling as close as possible to nature. At  first sight, it might seem as if, in the fluidity of these successive  waves, everything is indeterminate. But inspection shows that each wave  has a constitution which can be to some degree explained by the  constitution of the waves just passed away. And this relation of the  wave to its predecessors is expressed by the two fundamental 'laws of  association,' so-called, of which the first is named the Law of  Contiguity, the second that of Similarity.    The _Law of Contiguity_ tells us that objects thought of in the coming  wave are such as in some previous experience were _next_ to the objects  represented in the wave that is passing away. The vanishing objects were  once formerly their neighbors in the mind. When you recite the alphabet  or your prayers, or when the sight of an object reminds you of its name,  or the name reminds you of the object, it is through the law of  contiguity that the terms are suggested to the mind.    The _Law of Similarity_ says that, when contiguity fails to describe  what happens, the coming objects will prove to _resemble_ the going  objects, even though the two were never experienced together before. In  our 'flights of fancy,' this is frequently the case.    If, arresting ourselves in the flow of reverie, we ask the question,  \"How came we to be thinking of just this object now?\" we can almost  always trace its presence to some previous object which has introduced  it to the mind, according to one or the other of these laws. The entire  routine of our memorized acquisitions, for example, is a consequence of  nothing but the Law of Contiguity. The words of a poem, the formulas of  trigonometry, the facts of history, the properties of material things,  are all known to us as definite systems or groups of objects which  cohere in an order fixed by innumerable iterations, and of which any one  part reminds us of the others. In dry and prosaic minds, almost all the  mental sequences flow along these lines of habitual routine repetition  and suggestion.    In witty, imaginative minds, on the other hand, the routine is broken  through with ease at any moment; and one field of mental objects will  suggest another with which perhaps in the whole history of human  thinking it had never once before been coupled. The link here is usually  some _analogy_ between the objects successively thought of,--an analogy  often so subtle that, although we feel it, we can with difficulty  analyze its ground; as where, for example, we find something masculine  in the color red and something feminine in the color pale blue, or  where, of three human beings' characters, one will remind us of a cat,  another of a dog, the third perhaps of a cow.           *       *       *       *       *    Psychologists have of course gone very deeply into the question of what  the causes of association may be; and some of them have tried to show  that contiguity and similarity are not two radically diverse laws, but  that either presupposes the presence of the other. I myself am disposed  to think that the phenomena of association depend on our cerebral  constitution, and are not immediate consequences of our being rational  beings. In other words, when we shall have become disembodied spirits,  it may be that our trains of consciousness will follow different laws.  These questions are discussed in the books on psychology, and I hope  that some of you will be interested in following them there. But I will,  on the present occasion, ignore them entirely; for, as teachers, it is  the _fact_ of association that practically concerns you, let its grounds  be spiritual or cerebral, or what they may, and let its laws be  reducible, or non-reducible, to one. Your pupils, whatever else they  are, are at any rate little pieces of associating machinery. Their  education consists in the organizing within them of determinate  tendencies to associate one thing with another,--impressions with  consequences, these with reactions, those with results, and so on  indefinitely. The more copious the associative systems, the completer  the individual's adaptations to the world.    The teacher can formulate his function to himself therefore in terms of  'association' as well as in terms of 'native and acquired reaction.' It  is mainly that of _building up useful systems of association_ in the  pupil's mind. This description sounds wider than the one I began by  giving. But, when one thinks that our trains of association, whatever  they may be, normally issue in acquired reactions or behavior, one sees  that in a general way the same mass of facts is covered by both  formulas.    It is astonishing how many mental operations we can explain when we have  once grasped the principles of association. The great problem which  association undertakes to solve is, _Why does just this particular field  of consciousness, constituted in this particular way, now appear before  my mind?_ It may be a field of objects imagined; it may be of objects  remembered or of objects perceived; it may include an action resolved  on. In either case, when the field is analyzed into its parts, those  parts can be shown to have proceeded from parts of fields previously  before consciousness, in consequence of one or other of the laws of  association just laid down. Those laws _run_ the mind: interest,  shifting hither and thither, deflects it; and attention, as we shall  later see, steers it and keeps it from too zigzag a course.    To grasp these factors clearly gives one a solid and simple  understanding of the psychological machinery. The 'nature,' the  'character,' of an individual means really nothing but the habitual form  of his associations. To break up bad associations or wrong ones, to  build others in, to guide the associative tendencies into the most  fruitful channels, is the educator's principal task. But here, as with  all other simple principles, the difficulty lies in the application.  Psychology can state the laws: concrete tact and talent alone can work  them to useful results.    Meanwhile it is a matter of the commonest experience that our minds may  pass from one object to another by various intermediary fields of  consciousness. The indeterminateness of our paths of association _in  concreto_ is thus almost as striking a feature of them as the uniformity  of their abstract form. Start from any idea whatever, and the entire  range of your ideas is potentially at your disposal. If we take as the  associative starting-point, or cue, some simple word which I pronounce  before you, there is no limit to the possible diversity of suggestions  which it may set up in your minds. Suppose I say 'blue,' for example:  some of you may think of the blue sky and hot weather from which we now  are suffering, then go off on thoughts of summer clothing, or possibly  of meteorology at large; others may think of the spectrum and the  physiology of color-vision, and glide into X-rays and recent physical  speculations; others may think of blue ribbons, or of the blue flowers  on a friend's hat, and proceed on lines of personal reminiscence. To  others, again, etymology and linguistic thoughts may be suggested; or  blue may be 'apperceived' as a synonym for melancholy, and a train of  associates connected with morbid psychology may proceed to unroll  themselves.    In the same person, the same word heard at different times will provoke,  in consequence of the varying marginal preoccupations, either one of a  number of diverse possible associative sequences. Professor Muensterberg  performed this experiment methodically, using the same words four times  over, at three-month intervals, as 'cues' for four different persons who  were the subjects of observation. He found almost no constancy in their  associations taken at these different times. In short, the entire  potential content of one's consciousness is accessible from any one of  its points. This is why we can never work the laws of association  forward: starting from the present field as a cue, we can never cipher  out in advance just what the person will be thinking of five minutes  later. The elements which may become prepotent in the process, the parts  of each successive field round which the associations shall chiefly  turn,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16295"],[0,"The Vedanta-Sutras with the Commentary (#11)"],[1,"ra,  that intelligence or knowledge does not, as the Vai/s/eshikas teach,  constitute a mere attribute of the soul which in itself is essentially  non-intelligent, but is the very essence of the soul. The soul is not a  knower, but knowledge; not intelligent, but intelligence.--Ramanuja, on  the other hand, explains 'j/n/a' by 'j/n/at/ri/,' i.e. knower, knowing  agent, and considers the Sutra to be directed not only against the  Vai/s/eshikas, but also against those philosophers who--like the  Sa@nkhyas and the Vedantins of /S/a@nkara's school--maintain that the  soul is not a knowing agent, but pure /k/aitanya.--The wording of the  Sutra certainly seems to favour Ramanuja's interpretation; we can hardly  imagine that an author definitely holding the views of /S/a@nkara  should, when propounding the important dogma of the soul's nature, use  the term j/n/a of which the most obvious interpretation j/n/at/ri/, not  j/n/anam.    Adhik. XIII (19-32) treats the question whether the individual soul is  a/n/u, i.e. of very minute size, or omnipresent, all-pervading  (sarvagata, vyapin). Here, again, we meet with diametrically opposite  views.--In /S/a@nkara's opinion the Sutras 19-38 represent the  purvapaksha view, according to which the jiva is a/n/u, while Sutra 29  formulates the siddhanta, viz. that the jiva, which in reality is  all-pervading, is spoken of as a/n/u in some scriptural passages,  because the qualities of the internal organ--which itself is  a/n/u--constitute the essence of the individual soul as long as the  latter is implicated in the sa/m/sara.--According to Ramanuja, on the  other hand, the first Sutra of the adhikara/n/a gives utterance to the  siddhanta view, according to which the soul is of minute size; the  Sutras 20-25 confirm this view and refute objections raised against it;  while the Sutras 26-29 resume the question already mooted under Sutra  18, viz. in what relation the soul as knowing agent (j/n/at/ri/) stands  to knowledge (j/n/ana).--In order to decide between the conflicting  claims of these two interpretations we must enter into some  details.--/S/a@nkara maintains that Sutras 19-28 state and enforce a  purvapaksha view, which is finally refuted in 29. What here strikes us  at the outset, is the unusual length to which the defence of a mere  prima facie view is carried; in no other place the Sutras take so much  trouble to render plausible what is meant to be rejected in the end, and  an unbiassed reader will certainly feel inclined to think that in 19-28  we have to do, not with the preliminary statement of a view finally to  be abandoned, but with an elaborate bona fide attempt to establish and  vindicate an essential dogma of the system. Still it is not altogether  impossible that the purvapaksha should here be treated at greater length  than usual, and the decisive point is therefore whether we can, with  /S/a@nkara, look upon Sutra 29 as embodying a refutation of the  purvapaksha and thus implicitly acknowledging the doctrine that the  individual soul is all-pervading. Now I think there can be no doubt that  /S/a@nkara's interpretation of the Sutra is exceedingly forced.  Literally translated (and leaving out the non-essential word  'praj/n/avat') the Sutra runs as follows: 'But on account of that  quality (or \"those qualities;\" or else \"on account of the quality--or  qualities--of that\") being the essence, (there is) that designation (or  \"the designation of that\").' This /S/a@nkara maintains to mean, 'Because  the qualities of the buddhi are the essence of the soul in the sa/m/sara  state, therefore the soul itself is sometimes spoken of as a/n/u.' Now,  in the first place, nothing in the context warrants the explanation of  the first 'tat' by buddhi. And--which is more important--in the second  place, it is more than doubtful whether on /S/a@nkara's own system the  qualities of the buddhi--such as pleasure, pain, desire, aversion,  &c.--can with any propriety be said to constitute the essence of the  soul even in the sa/m/sara state. The essence of the soul in whatever  state, according to /S/a@nkara's system, is knowledge or intelligence;  whatever is due to its association with the buddhi is non-essential or,  more strictly, unreal, false.    There are no similar difficulties in the way of Ramanuja's  interpretation of the adhikara/n/a. He agrees with /S/a@nkara in the  explanation of Sutras 19-35, with this difference that he views them as  setting forth, not the purvapaksha, but the siddhanta. Sutras 26-28 also  are interpreted in a manner not very different from /S/a@nkara's,  special stress being laid on the distinction made by Scripture between  knowledge as a mere quality and the soul as a knowing agent, the  substratum of knowledge. This discussion naturally gives rise to the  question how it is that Scripture in some places makes use of the term  vij/n/ana when meaning the individual soul. The answer is given in Sutra  29, 'The soul is designated as knowledge because it has that quality for  its essence,' i.e. because knowledge is the essential characteristic  quality of the soul, therefore the term 'knowledge' is employed here and  there to denote the soul itself. This latter interpretation gives rise  to no doubt whatever. It closely follows the wording of the text and  does not necessitate any forced supplementation. The 'tu' of the Sutra  which, according to /S/a@nkara, is meant to discard the purvapaksha,  serves on Ramanuja's view to set aside a previously-raised objection; an  altogether legitimate assumption.    Of the three remaining Sutras of the adhikara/n/a (30-32), 30 explains,  according to /S/a@nkara, that the soul may be called a/n/u, since, as  long as it exists in the sa/m/sara condition, it is connected with the  buddhi. According to Ramanuja the Sutra teaches that the soul may be  called vij/n/ana because the latter constitutes its essential quality as  long as it exists.--Sutra 31 intimates, according to /S/a@nkara, that in  the states of deep sleep, and so on, the soul is potentially connected  with the buddhi, while in the waking state that connexion becomes  actually manifest. The same Sutra, according to Ramanuja, teaches that  j/n/at/ri/tva is properly said to constitute the soul's essential  nature, although it is actually manifested in some states of the soul  only.--In Sutra 32, finally, /S/a@nkara sees a statement of the doctrine  that, unless the soul had the buddhi for its limiting adjunct, it would  either be permanently cognizing or permanently non-cognizing; while,  according to Ramanuja, the Sutra means that the soul would either be  permanently cognizing or permanently non-cognizing, if it were pure  knowledge and all-pervading (instead of being /jn/at/ri/ and a/n/u, as  it is in reality).--The three Sutras can be made to fit in with either  interpretation, although it must be noted that none of them explicitly  refers to the soul's connexion with the buddhi.    Adhik. XIV and XV (33-39; 40) refer to the kart/ri/tva of the jiva, i.e.  the question whether the soul is an agent. Sutras 33-39 clearly say that  it is such. But as, according to /S/a@nkara's system, this cannot be the  final view,--the soul being essentially non-active, and all action  belonging to the world of upadhis,--he looks upon the next following  Sutra (40) as constituting an adhikara/n/a by itself, and teaching that  the soul is an agent when connected with the instruments of action,  buddhi, &c., while it ceases to be so when dissociated from them, 'just  as the carpenter acts in both ways,' i.e. just as the carpenter works as  long as he wields his instruments, and rests after having laid them  aside.--Ramanuja, perhaps more naturally, does not separate Sutra 40  from the preceding Sutras, but interprets it as follows: Activity is  indeed an essential attribute of the soul; but therefrom it does not  follow that the soul is always actually active, just as the carpenter,  even when furnished with the requisite instruments, may either work or  not work, just as he pleases.    Adhik. XVI (41, 42) teaches that the soul in its activity is dependent  on the Lord who impels it with a view to its former actions.    Adhik. XVII (43-53) treats of the relation of the individual soul to  Brahman. Sutra 43 declares that the individual soul is a part (a/ms/a)  of Brahman, and the following Sutras show how that relation does not  involve either that Brahman is affected by the imperfections,  sufferings, &c. of the souls, or that one soul has to participate in the  experiences of other souls. The two commentators of course take entirely  different views of the doctrine that the soul is a part of Brahman.  According to Ramanuja the souls are in reality parts of Brahman[14];  according to Sa@nkara the 'a/ms/a' of the Sutra must be understood to  mean 'a/ms/a iva,' 'a part as it were;' the one universal indivisible  Brahman having no real parts, but appearing to be divided owing to its  limiting adjuncts.--One Sutra (50) in this adhikara/n/a calls for  special notice. According to Sa@nkara the words 'abhasa eva /k/a' mean  '(the soul is) a mere reflection,' which, as the commentators remark, is  a statement of the so-called pratibimbavada, i.e. the doctrine that the  so-called individual soul is nothing but the reflection of the Self in  the buddhi; while Sutra 43 had propounded the so-called ava/kkh/edavada,  i.e. the doctrine that the soul is the highest Self in so far as limited  by its adjuncts.--According to Ramanuja the abhasa of the Sutra has to  be taken in the sense of hetvabhasa, a fallacious argument, and the  Sutra is explained as being directed against the reasoning of those  Vedantins according to whom the soul is Brahman in so far as limited by  non-real adjuncts[15].      PADA IV.      Adhik. I, II, III (1-4; 5-6; 7) teach that the pra/n/as (by which  generic name are denoted the buddhindriyas, karmen-driyas, and the  manas) spring from Brahman; are"]]]
