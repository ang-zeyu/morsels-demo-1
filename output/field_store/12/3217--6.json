A single flirt of the  tail, no more vigorous than those he had been used to giving with his  legs, would send him whirling round and round in the water, for all  the world like a living top; and when he wriggled his fins, ever so  slightly, as he thought, he found himself sprawling on his back in a  most ridiculous fashion for a dignified member of fishkind. It took  several hours of constant practice to get the proper stroke, and then he  found he could move about without being conscious of any effort. It was  the easiest thing he had ever done in his life; and oh! the water was so  cool and delightful! \"Would that I might enjoy that endless life the  poets write of!\" he murmured blissfully.    Many hours passed by until at last Li was compelled to admit that,  although he was not tired, he was certainly hungry. How to get something  to eat? Oh! why had he not asked the friendly nephew a few simple  questions? How easily his lordship might have told him the way to get  a good breakfast! But alas! without such advice, it would be a whale's  task to accomplish it. Hither and thither he swam, into the deep  still water, and along the muddy shore; down, down to the pebbly  bottom--always looking, looking for a tempting worm. He dived into the  weeds and rushes, poked his nose among the lily pads. All for nothing!  No fly or worm of any kind to gladden his eager eyes! Another hour  passed slowly away, and all the time his hunger was growing greater and  greater. Would the fish god, the mighty dragon, not grant him even one  little morsel to satisfy his aching stomach, especially since, now that  he was a fish, he had no way of tightening up his belt, as hungry  soldiers do when they are on a forced march?    Just as Li was beginning to think he could not wriggle his tail  an instant longer, and that soon, very soon, he would feel himself  slipping, slipping, slipping down to the bottom of the pond to die--at  that very moment, chancing to look up, he saw, oh joy! a delicious red  worm dangling a few inches above his nose. The sight gave new strength  to his weary fins and tail. Another minute, and he would have had the  delicate morsel in his mouth, when alas! he chanced to recall the advice  given him the day before by great King Carp. \"No matter how tempting it  looks, there are sure to be horrible hooks inside.\" For an instant Li  hesitated. The worm floated a trifle nearer to his half-open mouth. How  tempting! After all, what was a hook to a fish when he was dying? Why be  a coward? Perhaps this worm was an exception to the rule, or perhaps,  perhaps any thing--really a fish in such a plight as Mr. Li could not be  expected to follow advice--even the advice of a real KING.    Pop! He had it in his mouth. Oh, soft morsel, worthy of a king's desire!  Now he could laugh at words of wisdom, and eat whatever came before his  eye. But ugh! What was that strange feeling that--Ouch! it was the fatal  hook!    With one frantic jerk, and a hundred twists and turns, poor Li sought  to pull away from the cruel barb that stuck so fast in the roof of his  mouth. It was now too late to wish he had kept away from temptation.  Better far to have starved at the bottom of the cool pond than to be  jerked out by some miserable fisherman to the light and sunshine of the  busy world. Nearer and nearer he approached the surface. The more he  struggled the sharper grew the cruel barb. Then, with one final splash,  he found himself dangling in mid-air, swinging helplessly at the end of  a long line. With a chunk he fell into a flat-bottomed boat, directly  on top of several smaller fish.    \"Ah, a carp!\" shouted a well-known voice gleefully; \"the biggest fish  I've caught these three moons. What good luck!\"    It was the voice of old Chang, the fisherman, who had been supplying  Mr. Li's table ever since that official's arrival in the village of  Everlasting Happiness. Only a word of explanation, and he, Li, would be  free once more to swim about where he willed. And then there should be  no more barbs for him. An escaped fish fears the hook.    \"I say, Chang,\" he began, gasping for breath, \"really now, you must  chuck me overboard at once, for, don't you see, I am Mr. Li, your old  master. Come, hurry up about it. I'll excuse you this time for your  mistake, for, of course, you had no way of knowing. Quick!\"    But Chang, with a savage jerk, pulled the hook from Li's mouth, and  looked idly towards the pile of glistening fish, gloating over his  catch, and wondering how much money he could demand for it. He had heard  nothing of Mr. Li's remarks, for Chang had been deaf since childhood.    \"Quick, quick, I am dying for air,\" moaned poor Li, and then, with a  groan, he remembered the fisherman's affliction.    By this time they had arrived at the shore, and Li, in company with his  fellow victims, found himself suddenly thrown into a wicker basket. Oh,  the horrors of that journey on land! Only a tiny bit of water remained  in the closely-woven thing. It was all he could do to breathe.    Joy of joys! At the door of his own house he saw his good friend Sing  just coming out. \"Hey, Sing,\" he shouted, at the top of his voice,  \"help, help! This son of a turtle wants to murder me. He has me in here  with these fish, and doesn't seem to know that I am Li, his master.  Kindly order him to take me to the lake and throw me in, for it's cool  there and I like the water life much better than that on land.\"    Li paused to hear Sing's reply, but there came not a single word.    \"I beg your honour to have a look at my catch,\" said old Chang to Sing.  \"Here is the finest fish of the season. I have brought him here so that  you and my honoured master, Mr. Li, may have a treat. Carp is his  favourite delicacy.\"    \"Very kind of you, my good Chang, I'm sure, but I fear poor Mr. Li will  not eat fish for some time. He has a bad attack of fever.\"    \"There's where you're wrong,\" shouted Li, from his basket, flopping  about with all his might, to attract attention, \"I'm going to die of a  chill. Can't you recognise your old friend? Help me out of this trouble  and you may have all my money for your pains.\"    \"Hey, what's that!\" questioned Sing, attracted, as usual, by the word  money. \"Shades of Confucius! It sounds as if the carp were talking.\"    \"What, a talking fish,\" laughed Chang. \"Why, master, I've lived nigh on  to sixty year, and such a fish has never come under my sight. There are  talking birds and talking beasts for that matter; but talking fish, who  ever heard of such a wonder? No, I think your ears must have deceived  you, but this carp will surely cause talk when I get him into the  kitchen. I'm sure the cook has never seen his like. Oh, master! I hope  you will be hungry when you sit down to this fish. What a pity Mr. Li  couldn't help you to devour it!\"    \"Help to devour myself, eh?\" grumbled poor Li, now almost dead for lack  of water. \"You must take me for a cannibal, or some other sort of  savage.\"    Old Chang had now gone round the house to the servants' quarters, and,  after calling out the cook, held up poor Li by the tail for the chef to  inspect.    With a mighty jerk Li tore himself away and fell at the feet of his  faithful cook. \"Save me, save me!\" he cried out in despair; \"this  miserable Chang is deaf and doesn't know that I am Mr. Li, his master.  My fish voice is not strong enough for his hearing. Only take me back to  the pond and set me free. You shall have a pension for life, wear good  clothes and eat good food, all the rest of your days. Only hear me and  obey! Listen, my dear cook, listen!\"    \"The thing seems to be talking,\" muttered the cook, \"but such wonders  cannot be. Only ignorant old women or foreigners would believe that a  fish could talk.\" And seizing his former master by the tail, he swung  him on to a table, picked up a knife, and began to whet it on a stone.    \"Oh, oh!\" screamed Li, \"you will stick a knife into me! You will scrape  off my beautiful shiny scales! You will whack off my lovely new fins!  You will murder your old master!\"    \"Well, you won't talk much longer,\" growled the cook, \"I'll show you a  trick or two with the blade.\"    So saying, with a gigantic thrust, he plunged the knife deep into the  body of the trembling victim.    With a shrill cry of horror and despair, Mr. Li awoke from the deep  sleep into which he had fallen. His fever was gone, but he found himself  trembling with fear at thought of the terrible death that had come to  him in dreamland.    \"Thanks be to Buddha, I am not a fish!\" he cried out joyfully; \"and now  I shall be well enough to enjoy the feast to which Mr. Sing has bidden  guests for to-morrow. But alas, now that I can eat the old fisherman's  prize carp, it has changed back into myself.        \"If only the good of our dreams came true,    I shouldn't mind dreaming the whole day through.\"          BAMBOO AND THE TURTLE    [Illustration]      A party of visitors had been seeing the sights at Hsi Ling. They had  just passed down the Holy Way between the huge stone animals when  Bamboo, a little boy of twelve, son of a keeper, rushed out from his  father's house to see the mandarins go by. Such a parade of great men  he had never seen before, even on the feast days. There were ten sedan  chairs, with bearers dressed in flaming colours, ten long-handled, red  umbrellas, each carried far in front of its proud owner, and a long line  of horsemen.    When this gay procession had filed past, Bamboo was almost ready to cry  because he could not run after the sightseers as they went from temple  to temple and from tomb to tomb. But, alas! his father had ordered him  never to follow tourists. \"If you do, they will take you for a beggar,  Bamboo,\" he had said shrewdly, \"and if you're a beggar, then your  daddy's one too. Now they don't want any beggars around the royal  tombs.\" So Bamboo had never "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1872"],[0,"The Red House Mystery (#11)"],[1,"women like that type of ugliness.\"    \"Yes, that's true. Between ourselves, I think there's one here who does.  Rather a pretty girl at Jallands\" he waved his left hand \"down that  way.\"    \"What's Jallands?\"    \"Well, I suppose it used to be a farm, belonging to a bloke called  Jalland, but now it's a country cottage belonging to a widow called  Norbury. Mark and Cayley used to go there a good deal together. Miss  Norbury--the girl--has been here once or twice for tennis; seemed to  prefer Cayley to the rest of us. But of course he hadn't much time for  that sort of thing.\"    \"What sort of thing?\"    \"Walking about with a pretty girl and asking her if she's been to any  theatres lately. He nearly always had something to do.\"    \"Mark kept him busy?\"    \"Yes. Mark never seemed quite happy unless he had Cayley doing something  for him. He was quite lost and helpless without him. And, funnily  enough, Cayley seemed lost without Mark.\"    \"He was fond of him?\"    \"Yes, I should say so. In a protective kind of way. He'd sized Mark up,  of course his vanity, his self-importance, his amateurishness and all  the rest of it, but he liked looking after him. And he knew how to manage  him.\"    \"Yes.... What sort of terms was he on with the guests--you and Miss  Norris and all of them?\"    \"Just polite and rather silent, you know. Keeping himself to himself. We  didn't see so very much of him, except at meals. We were here to enjoy  ourselves, and well, he wasn't.\"    \"He wasn't there when the ghost walked?\"    \"No. I heard Mark calling for him when he went back to the house. I  expect Cayley stroked down his feathers a bit, and told him that girls  will be girls....--Hallo, here we are.\"    They went into the inn, and while Bill made himself pleasant to the  landlady, Antony went upstairs to his room. It appeared that he had not  very much packing to do, after all. He returned his brushes to his bag,  glanced round to see that nothing else had been taken out, and went down  again to settle his bill. He had decided to keep on his room for a few  days; partly to save the landlord and his wife the disappointment of  losing a guest so suddenly, partly in case he found it undesirable later  on to remain at the Red House. For he was taking himself seriously as a  detective; indeed, he took himself seriously (while getting all the fun  out of it which was possible) at every new profession he adopted; and he  felt that there might come a time--after the inquest--say when he could  not decently remain at the Red House as a guest, a friend of Bill's,  enjoying the hospitality of Mark or Cayley, whichever was to be regarded  as his host, without forfeiting his independent attitude towards the  events of that afternoon. At present he was staying in the house merely  as a necessary witness, and, since he was there, Cayley could not object  to him using his eyes; but if, after the inquest, it appeared that there  was still work for a pair of independent and very keen eyes to do, then  he must investigate, either with his host's approval or from beneath the  roof of some other host; the landlord of 'The George,' for instance, who  had no feelings in the matter.    For of one thing Antony was certain. Cayley knew more than he professed  to know. That is to say, he knew more than he wanted other people to  know he knew. Antony was one of the \"other people\"; if, therefore, he  was for trying to find out what it was that Cayley knew, he could hardly  expect Cayley's approval of his labours. It would be 'The George,' then,  for Antony after the inquest.    What was the truth? Not necessarily discreditable to Cayley, even though  he were hiding something. All that could be said against him at the  moment was that he had gone the longest way round to get into the locked  office and that this did not fit in with what he had told the Inspector.  But it did fit in with the theory that he had been an accessory after  the event, and that he wanted (while appearing to be in a hurry) to give  his cousin as much time as possible in which to escape. That might not  be the true solution, but it was at least a workable one. The theory  which he had suggested to the Inspector was not.    However, there would be a day or two before the inquest, in which Antony  could consider all these matters from within The Red House. The car was  at the door. He got in with Bill, the landlord put his bag on the front  seat next to the chauffeur, and they drove back.          CHAPTER VIII. \"Do You Follow Me, Watson?\"      Antony's bedroom looked over the park at the back of the house. The  blinds were not yet drawn while he was changing his clothes for dinner,  and at various stages of undress he would pause and gaze out of the  window, sometimes smiling to himself, sometimes frowning, as he turned  over in his mind all the strange things that he had seen that day. He  was sitting on his bed, in shirt and trousers, absently smoothing down  his thick black hair with his brushes, when Bill shouted an \"Hallo!\"  through the door, and came in.    \"I say, buck up, old boy, I'm hungry,\" he said.    Antony stopped smoothing himself and looked up at him thoughtfully.    \"Where's Mark?\" he said.    \"Mark? You mean Cayley.\"    Antony corrected himself with a little laugh. \"Yes, I mean Cayley. Is  he down? I say, I shan't be a moment, Bill.\" He got up from the bed and  went on briskly with his dressing. \"Oh, by the way,\" said Bill, taking  his place on the bed, \"your idea about the keys is a wash-out.\"    \"Why, how do you mean?\"    \"I went down just now and had a look at them. We were asses not to have  thought of it when we came in. The library key is outside, but all the  others are inside.\"    \"Yes, I know.\"    \"You devil, I suppose you did think of it, then?\"    \"I did, Bill,\" said Antony apologetically.    \"Bother! I hoped you'd forgotten. Well, that knocks your theory on the  head, doesn't it?\"    \"I never had a theory. I only said that if they were outside, it would  probably mean that the office key was outside, and that in that case  Cayley's theory was knocked on the head.\"    \"Well, now, it isn't, and we don't know anything. Some were outside and  some inside, and there you are. It makes it much less exciting. When you  were talking about it on the lawn, I really got quite keen on the idea  of the key being outside and Mark taking it in with him.\"    \"It's going to be exciting enough,\" said Antony mildly, as he  transferred his pipe and tobacco into the pocket of his black coat.  \"Well, let's come down; I'm ready now.\"    Cayley was waiting for them in the hall. He made some polite inquiry  as to the guest's comfort, and the three of them fell into a casual  conversation about houses in general and The Red House in particular.    \"You were quite right about the keys,\" said Bill, during a pause. He was  less able than the other two, perhaps because he was younger than they,  to keep away from the subject which was uppermost in the minds of them  all.    \"Keys?\" said Cayley blankly.    \"We were wondering whether they were outside or inside.\"    \"Oh! oh, yes!\" He looked slowly round the hall, at the different doors,  and then smiled in a friendly way at Antony. \"We both seem to have been  right, Mr. Gillingham. So we don't get much farther.\"    \"No.\" He gave a shrug. \"I just wondered, you know. I thought it was  worth mentioning.\"    \"Oh, quite. Not that you would have convinced me, you know. Just as  Elsie's evidence doesn't convince me.\"    \"Elsie?\" said Bill excitedly. Antony looked inquiringly at him,  wondering who Elsie was.    \"One of the housemaids,\" explained Cayley. \"You didn't hear what she  told the Inspector? Of course, as I told Birch, girls of that class make  things up, but he seemed to think she was genuine.\"    \"What was it?\" said Bill.    Cayley told them of what Elsie had heard through the office door that  afternoon.    \"You were in the library then, of course,\" said Antony, rather to  himself than to the other. \"She might have gone through the hall without  your hearing.\"    \"Oh, I've no doubt she was there, and heard voices. Perhaps heard those  very words. But--\" He broke off, and then added impatiently, \"It was  accidental. I know it was accidental. What's the good of talking as if  Mark was a murderer?\" Dinner was announced at that moment, and as they  went in, he added, \"What's the good of talking about it at all, if it  comes to that?\"    \"What, indeed?\" said Antony, and to Bill's great disappointment they  talked of books and politics during the meal.    Cayley made an excuse for leaving them as soon as their cigars were  alight. He had business to attend to, as was natural. Bill would look  after his friend. Bill was only too willing. He offered to beat  Antony at billiards, to play him at piquet, to show him the garden by  moonlight, or indeed to do anything else with him that he required.    \"Thank the Lord you're here,\" he said piously. \"I couldn't have stood it  alone.\"    \"Let's go outside,\" suggested Antony. \"It's quite warm. Somewhere where  we can sit down, right away from the house. I want to talk to you.\"    \"Good man. What about the bowling-green?\"    \"Oh, you were going to show me that, anyhow, weren't you? Is it  somewhere where we can talk without being overheard?\"    \"Rather. The ideal place. You'll see.\"    They came out of the front door and followed the drive to the left.  Coming from Waldheim, Antony had approached the house that afternoon  from the other side. The way they were going now would take them out  at the opposite end of the park, on the high road to Stanton, a country  town some three miles away. They passed by a gate and a gardener's  lodge, which marked the limit of what auctioneers like to call \"the  ornamental grounds of the estate,\" and then the open park was before  them.    \"Sure we haven't missed it?\" said Antony. The park lay quietly in the  moonlight on either side of the drive, wearing a little "]]]
