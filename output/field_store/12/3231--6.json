I remember of my years I had numbered almost seven,    And the old cradle stood against the wall--  I was youngest of the five, and two were gone to heaven,    But the old red cradle rocked us all.    And if ever came a day when my cheeks were flushed and hot,    When I did not mind my porridge or my play,  I would clamber up its side and the pain would be forgot,    When the old red cradle rocked away.    It has been a hallowed spot where I've turned through all the years,    Which have brought me the evil with the good,  And I turn again to-night, aye, and see it through my tears,    The place where the dear old cradle stood.    By its side my father paused with a little time to spare.    And the care-lines would soften on his brow,  Ah! 't was but a little while that I knew a father's care,    But I fancy in my dreams I see him now.    By my mother it was rocked when the evening meal was laid,    And again I seem to see her as she smiled;  When the rest were all in bed, 'twas there she knelt and prayed,    By the old red cradle and her child.    Aye, it cradled one and all, brothers, sisters in it lay,    And it gave me the sweetest rest I've known;  But to-night the tears will flow, and I let them have their way,    For the passing years are leaving me alone.    And it seems of those to come, I would gladly give them all    For a slumber as free from care as then,  Just to wake to-morrow morn where the rising sun would fall    Round the old red cradle once again.    But the cradle long has gone and the burdens that it bore,    One by one, have been gathered to the fold;  Still the flock is incomplete, for it numbers only four,    With one left out straying in the cold.    Heaven grant again we may in each other's arms be locked,    Where no sad tears of parting ever fall;  God forbid that one be lost that the old red cradle rocked;    And the dear old cradle rocked us all.        _Annie J. Granniss._          The Moo Cow Moo      My papa held me up to the Moo Cow Moo    So close I could almost touch,  And I fed him a couple of times or so,    And I wasn't a fraid-cat, much.    But if my papa goes in the house,    And my mamma she goes in too,  I keep still like a little mouse    For the Moo Cow Moo might Moo.    The Moo Cow's tail is a piece of rope    All raveled out where it grows;  And it's just like feeling a piece of soap    All over the Moo Cow's nose.    And the Moo Cow Moo has lots of fun    Just switching his tail about,  But if he opens his mouth, why then I run,    For that's where the Moo comes out.    The Moo Cow Moo has deers on his head,    And his eyes stick out of their place,  And the nose of the Moo Cow Moo is spread    All over the Moo Cow's face.    And his feet are nothing but fingernails,    And his mamma don't keep them cut,  And he gives folks milk in water pails,    When he don't keep his handles shut.    But if you or I pull his handles, why    The Moo Cow Moo says it hurts,  But the hired man sits down close by    And squirts, and squirts, and squirts.        _Edmund Vance Cooke._          All Things Bright and Beautiful      All things bright and beautiful,    All creatures great and small,  All things wise and wonderful,--    The Lord God made them all.    Each little flower that opens,    Each little bird that sings,--  He made their glowing colors,    He made their tiny wings.    The rich man in his castle,    The poor man at his gate,  God made them, high or lowly,    And ordered their estate.    The purple-headed mountain,    The river running by,  The morning, and the sunset    That lighteth up the sky,    The cold wind in the winter,    The pleasant summer sun,  The ripe fruits in the garden,--    He made them, every one.    The tall trees in the greenwood,    The meadows where we play,  The rushes by the water    We gather every day,--    He gave us eyes to see them,    And lips that we might tell  How great is God Almighty,    Who hath made all things well.        _Cecil Frances Alexander._          An Order for a Picture      Oh, good painter, tell me true,    Has your hand the cunning to draw    Shapes of things that you never saw?  Aye? Well, here is an order for you.    Woods and cornfields, a little brown,--    The picture must not be over-bright,--    Yet all in the golden and gracious light  Of a cloud, when the summer sun is down.    Alway and alway, night and morn,    Woods upon woods, with fields of corn      Lying between them, not quite sere,  And not in the full, thick, leafy bloom,  When the wind can hardly find breathing-room,      Under their tassels,--cattle near,  Biting shorter the short green grass,  And a hedge of sumach and sassafras,  With bluebirds twittering all around,--  (Ah, good painter, you can't paint sound!)--    These, and the little house where I was born,  Low and little, and black and old,  With children, many as it can hold,  All at the windows, open wide,--  Heads and shoulders clear outside,  And fair young faces all ablush:    Perhaps you have seen, some day,    Roses crowding the self-same way,  Out of a wilding, wayside bush.    Listen closer. When you have done    With woods and cornfields and grazing herds,  A lady, the loveliest ever the sun  Looked down upon you must paint for me:  Oh, if I could only make you see    The clear blue eyes, the tender smile,  The sovereign sweetness, the gentle grace,  The woman's soul, and the angel's face    That are beaming on me all the while,    I need not speak these foolish words:    Yet one word tells you all I would say,--  She is my mother: you will agree    That all the rest may be thrown away.    Two little urchins at her knee  You must paint, sir: one like me,--      The other with a clearer brow,    And the light of his adventurous eyes    Flashing with boldest enterprise:  At ten years old he went to sea,--      God knoweth if he be living now;    He sailed in the good ship \"Commodore,\"--  Nobody ever crossed her track  To bring us news, and she never came back.    Ah, it is twenty long years and more  Since that old ship went out of the bay    With my great-hearted brother on her deck:    I watched him till he shrank to a speck,  And his face was toward me all the way.  Bright his hair was, a golden brown,    The time we stood at our mother's knee:  That beauteous head, if it did go down,    Carried sunshine into the sea!    Out in the fields one summer night    We were together, half afraid    Of the corn-leaves' rustling, and of the shade      Of the high hills, stretching so still and far,--  Loitering till after the low little light    Of the candle shone through the open door,  And over the hay-stack's pointed top,  All of a tremble and ready to drop,      The first half-hoar, the great yellow star,    That we, with staring, ignorant eyes,  Had often and often watched to see    Propped and held in its place in the skies  By the fork of a tall red mulberry-tree,    Which close in the edge of our flax-field grew,--  Dead at the top, just one branch full  Of leaves, notched round, and lined with wool,    From which it tenderly shook the dew  Over our heads, when we came to play  In its hand-breadth of shadow, day after day.    Afraid to go home, sir; for one of us bore  A nest full of speckled and thin-shelled eggs,--  The other, a bird, held fast by the legs,  Not so big as a straw of wheat:  The berries we gave her she wouldn't eat,  But cried and cried, till we held her bill,  So slim and shining, to keep her still.    At last we stood at our mother's knee.    Do you think, sir, if you try,    You can paint the look of a lie?    If you can, pray have the grace    To put it solely in the face  Of the urchin that is likest me:      I think 'twas solely mine, indeed:    But that's no matter,--paint it so;      The eyes of our mother--(take good heed)--  Looking not on the nestful of eggs,  Nor the fluttering bird, held so fast by the legs,  But straight through our faces down to our lies,  And, oh, with such injured, reproachful surprise!  I felt my heart bleed where that glance went, as though  A sharp blade struck through it.    You, sir, know  That you on the canvas are to repeat  Things that are fairest, things most sweet,--  Woods and cornfields and mulberry-tree,--  The mother,--the lads, with their bird at her knee:    But, oh, that look of reproachful woe!  High as the heavens your name I'll shout,  If you paint me the picture, and leave that out.        _Alice Cary._          Who Won the War?              Who won the war?  'T was little Belgium stemmed the tide  Of ruthless hordes who thought to ride  Her borders through and prostrate France  Ere yet she'd time to raise her lance.          'T was plucky Belgium.            Who won the war?  Italia broke the galling chain  Which bound her to the guilty twain;  Then fought 'gainst odds till one of these  Lay prone and shattered at her knees.          'T was gallant Italy.            Who won the war?  Old England's watch dogs of the main  Their vigil kept, and not in vain;  For not a ship their wrath dared brave  Save those which skulked beneath the wave.          'T was mighty England.            Who won the war?  'T was France who wrote in noble rage  The grandest words on history's page,  \"They shall not pass\"--the devilish Hun;  And he could never pass Verdun.          'T was sturdy France.

We are said to be going to Belgium this  time--possibly Ypres. There are a terrible lot of wounded to be got  down--more than all the trains can take; they are putting some of them  off on the stations where there is a M.O. with a few men, and going back  for more.    There were two lovely French torpedo-boats alongside of us at Boulogne.    7.30 P.M., _Ypres_.--Just arrived, all very bucked at being in Belgium.  An armoured train, protective coloured all over in huge dabs of red,  blue, yellow, and green against aeroplanes, is alongside of us in the  station, manned by thirty men R.N.; three trucks are called Nelson,  Jellicoe, and Drake, with guns. They look fine; the men say it is a  great game. They are directed where to fire at German positions or  batteries, and as soon as they answer, the train nips out of range. They  were very jolly, and showed us their tame rabbit on active service. They  have had no casualties so far. Our load hasn't come in yet. We are _two  miles_ from our fighting line. No firing to-night to be heard--soon  began, though.      _Sunday, October 25th._--Couldn't write last night: the only thing was  to try and forget it all. It has been an absolute hell of a  journey--there is no other word for it. First, you must understand that  this big battle from Ostend to Lille is perhaps the most desperate of  all, though that is said of each in turn--Mons, the Aisne, and this; but  the men and officers who have been through all say this is the worst.  The Germans are desperate, and stick at nothing, and the Allies are the  same; and in determination to drive them back, each man personally seems  to be the same. Consequently the \"carnage\" is being appalling, and we  have been practically in it, as far as horrors go. Guns were cracking  and splitting all night, lighting up the sky in flashes, and fires were  burning on both sides. The Clearing Hospital close by, which was  receiving the wounded from the field and sending them on to us, was  packed and overflowing with badly wounded, the M.O. on the station said.    We had 368; a good 200 were dangerously and seriously wounded, perhaps  more; and the sitting-up cases were bad enough. The compound-fractured  femurs were put up with rifles and pick-handles for splints, padded with  bits of kilts and straw; nearly all the men had more than one  wound--some had ten; one man with a huge compound fracture above the  elbow had tied on a bit of string with a bullet in it as a tourniquet  above the wound himself. When I cut off his soaked three layers of  sleeve there was no dressing on it at all.    They were bleeding faster than we could cope with it; and the agony of  getting them off the stretchers on to the top bunks is a thing to  forget. We were full up by about 2 A.M., and then were delayed by a  collision up the line, which was blocked by dead horses as a result. All  night and without a break till we got back to Boulogne at 4 P.M. next  day (yesterday) we grappled with them, and some were not dressed when  we got into B----. The head cases were delirious, and trying to get out  of the window, and we were giving strychnine and morphia all round. Two  were put off dying at St Omer, but we kept the rest alive to Boulogne.  The outstanding shining thing that hit you in the eye all through was  the universal silent pluck of the men; they stuck it all without a whine  or complaint or even a comment: it was, \"Would you mind moving my leg  when you get time,\" and \"Thank you very much,\" or \"That's absolutely  glorious,\" as one boy said on having his bootlace cut, or \"That's  grand,\" when you struck a lucky position for a wound in the back. One  badly smashed up said contentedly, \"I was lucky--I was the only man left  alive in our trench\"; so was another in another trench; sixteen out of  twenty-five of one Company in a trench were on the train, all seriously  wounded except one. One man with both legs smashed and other wounds was  asked if it was all by one shell: \"Oh yes; why, the man next me was  blowed to bits.\" The bleeding made them all frightfully thirsty (they  had only been hit a few hours many of them), and luckily we had got in a  good supply of boiled water beforehand on each carriage, so we had  plenty when there was time to get it. In the middle of the worst of it  in the night I became conscious of a Belgian Boy Scout of fourteen in  the corridor, with a glass and a pail of drinking water; that boy  worked for hours with his glass and pail on his own, or wherever you  sent him. We took him back to Calais. He had come up into the firing  line on his cycle fitted with a rifle, with tobacco for the troops, and  lived with the British whom he loved, sharing their rations. He was a  little brick; one of the Civil Surgeons got him taken back with us,  where he wanted to go.    There were twenty-five officers on the train. They said there were  11,000 Germans dead, and they were using the dead piled up instead of  trenches.    About 1 o'clock that night we heard a rifle shot: it was a German spy  shooting at the sentry sailor on the armoured train alongside of us;  they didn't catch him.    It took from 4 to 10 P.M. to unload our bad cases and get them into  hospitals on motor ambulances: they lay in rows on their stretchers on  the platform waiting their turn without a grumble.    There have been so many hundreds brought down this week that they've had  suddenly to clear four hotels for hospitals.    We are now in the filthiest of sidings, and the smell of the burning of  our heaps of filthy _debris_ off the train is enough to make you sick.  We all slept like logs last night, and could have gone on all day; but  the train has to be cleaned down by the orderlies, and everything got  ready for the next lot: they nearly moved us up again last night, but we  shall go to-day.    I think if one knew beforehand what all this was going to be like one  would hardly want to face it, but somehow you're glad to be there.    We were tackling a bad wound in the head, and when it was finished and  the man was being got comfortable, he flinched and remarked, \"That leg  is a beast.\" We found a compound-fractured femur put up with a rifle for  a splint! He had blankets on, and had never mentioned that his thigh was  broken. It too had to be packed, and all he said was, \"That leg _is_ a  beast,\" and \"That leg is a _Beast_.\"      _Monday, the 26th_, 7 A.M., _Ypres._--We got here again about 10 P.M.  last night in pouring wet, and expected another night like Friday night,  but we for some reason remained short of the station, and when we found  there was nothing doing, lay down in our clothes and slept, booted and  spurred in mackintosh, aprons, &c. We were all so tired and done up  yesterday, M.O.'s, Sisters, and orderlies, that we were glad of the  respite. There was a tremendous banging and flashing to the north about  three o'clock, and this morning it was very noisy, and shaking the  train. Some of it sounds quite close. It is a noise you rather miss when  it leaves off.    One of the last lot of officers told us he had himself seen in a barn  three women and some children, all dead, and all with no hands.    The noise this morning is like a continuous roll of thunder interrupted  by loud bangs, and the popping of the French mitrailleuses, like our  Maxims. The nearest Tommy can get to that word is \"mileytrawsers.\" There  are two other A.T.'s in, but I hear we are to load up first.    This place is full of Belgian women and children refugees in a bad way  from exhaustion.    A long line of our horse ambulances is coming slowly in.    Had a very interesting morning. Got leave to go into the town and see  the Cathedral of St Martin. None of the others would budge from the  train, so I went alone; town chock-full of French and Belgian troops,  and unending streams of columns, also Belgian refugees, cars full of  staff officers. The Cathedral is thirteenth century, glorious as usual.  There are hundreds of German prisoners in the town in the Cloth Hall. It  was a very warrish feeling saying one's prayers in the Cathedral to the  sound of the guns of one of the greatest battles in the world.    An M.O. from the Clearing Hospital, with a haggard face, asked me if I  could give him some eau-de-Cologne and Bovril for a wounded officer  with a gangrenous leg--lying on the station. Sister X. and I took some  down, also morphia, and fed them all--frightful cases on stretchers in  the waiting-room. They are for our train when we can get in. He told me  he had never seen such awful wounds, or such numbers of them. They are  being brought down in carts or anything. He said there are 1500 dead  Germans piled up in a field five miles off. They say that German  officers of ten days' service are commanding.      _Tuesday, October 27th, Boulogne._--We got loaded up and off by about 7  P.M., and arrived back here this morning. There are two trains to unload  ahead of us, so we shall probably be on duty all day. It is the second  night running we haven't had our clothes off--though we did lie down the  night before. Last night we had each a four-hour shift to lie down, when  all the worst were seen to. One man died at 6 A.M. and another is dying:  many as usual are delirious, and the haemorrhage was worse than ever: it  is frightfully difficult to stop it with these bad wounds and compound  fractures. One sergeant has both eyes gone from a shell wound.    The twelve sitting-up cases on each carriage are a joy after the tragedy  of the rest. They sit up talking and smoking till late, \"because they  are so surprised and pleased to be alive, and it is too comfortable to  sleep!\"    One man with a broken leg gave me both his pillows for a worse man, and  said, \"I'm not bad at all--only got me leg broke.\" A Reading man, with  his face wounded and one eye gone, kept up a running fire of wit and  hilarity"]]]
