Not only do they vibrate at different rates of motion, but as in  different directions and in a different manner. The degrees of the rate  of vibrations constitute the degrees of measurement on the Scale of  Vibrations--in other words the degrees of the Fourth Dimension. And  these degrees form what occultists call \"Planes\" The higher the degree  of rate of vibration, the higher the plane, and the higher the  manifestation of Life occupying that plane. So that while a plane is not  \"a place,\" nor yet \"a state or condition,\" yet it possesses qualities  common to both. We shall have more to say regarding the subject of the  scale of Vibrations in our next lessons, in which we shall consider the  Hermetic Principle of Vibration.    You will kindly remember, however, that the Three Great Planes are not  actual divisions of the phenomena of the Universe, but merely arbitrary  terms used by the Hermetists in order to aid in the thought and study of  the various degrees and Forms of universal activity and life. The atom  of matter, the unit of force, the mind of man, and the being of the arch  -angel are all but degrees in one scale, and all fundamentally the same,  the difference between solely a matter of degree, and rate of  vibration--all are creations of THE ALL, and have their existence solely  within the Infinite Mind of THE ALL.    The Hermetists sub-divide each of the Three Great Planes into Seven  Minor Planes, and each of these latter are also sub-divided into seven  sub-planes, all divisions being more or less arbitrary, shading into  each other, and adopted merely for convenience of scientific study and  thought.    The Great Physical Plane, and its Seven Minor Planes, is that division  of the phenomena of the Universe which includes all that relates to  physics, or material things, forces, and manifestations. It includes all  forms of that which we call Matter, and all forms of that which we call  Energy or Force. But you must remember that the Hermetic Philosophy does  not recognize Matter as a thing in itself, or as having a separate  existence even in the Mind of THE ALL. The Teachings are that Matter is  but a form of Energy--.that is, Energy at a low rate of vibrations of a  certain kind. And accordingly the Hermetists classify Matter under the  head of Energy, and give to it three of the Seven Minor Planes of the  Great Physical Plane.    These Seven Minor Physical Planes are as follows:        1. The Plane of Matter (A)      2. The Plane of Matter (B)      3. The Plane of Matter (C)      4. The Plane of Ethereal Substance      5. The Plane of Energy (A)      6. The Plane of Energy (B)      7. The Plane of Energy (C)    The Plane of Matter (A) comprises the forms of Matter in its form of  solids, liquids, and gases, as generally recognized by the text-books on  physics. The Plane of Matter (B) comprises certain higher and more  subtle forms of Matter of the existence of which modern science is but  now recognizing, the phenomena of Radiant Matter, in its phases of  radium, etc., belonging to the lower sub-division of this Minor Plane.  The Plane of Matter (C) comprises forms of the most subtle and tenuous  Matter, the existence of which is not suspected by ordinary scientists.  The Plane of Ethereal Substance comprises that which science speaks of  as \"The Ether\", a substance of extreme tenuity and elasticity, pervading  all Universal Space, and acting as a medium for the transmission of  waves of energy, such as light, heat, electricity, etc. This Ethereal  Substance forms a connecting link between Matter (so-called) and Energy,  and partakes of the nature of each. The Hermetic Teachings, however,  instruct that this plane has seven sub-divisions (as have all of the  Minor Planes), and that in fact there are seven ethers, instead of but  one.    Next above the Plane of Ethereal Substance comes the Plane of Energy  (A), which comprises the ordinary forms of Energy known to science, its  seven sub-planes being, respectively, Heat; Light; Magnetism;  Electricity, and Attraction (including Gravitation, Cohesion, Chemical  Affinity, etc.) and several other forms of energy indicated by  scientific experiments but not as yet named or classified. The Plane of  Energy (B) comprises seven subplanes of higher forms of energy not as  yet discovered by science, but which have been called \"Nature's Finer  Forces\" and which are called into operation in manifestations of certain  forms of mental phenomena, and by which such phenomena becomes possible.  The Plane of Energy (C) comprises seven sub-planes of energy so highly  organized that it bears many of the characteristics of \"life,\" but which  is not recognized by the minds of men on the ordinary plane of  development, being available for the use on beings of the Spiritual  Plane alone--such energy is unthinkable to ordinary man, and may be  considered almost as \"the divine power.\" The beings employing the same  are as \"gods\" compared even to the highest human types known to us.    The Great Mental Plane comprises those forms of \"living things\" known to  us in ordinary life, as well as certain other forms not so well known  except to the occultist. The classification of the Seven Minor Mental  Planes is more or less satisfactory and arbitrary (unless accompanied by  elaborate explanations which are foreign to the purpose of this  particular work), but we may as well mention them. They are as follows:        1. The Plane of Mineral Mind      2. The Plane of Elemental Mind (A)      3. The Plane of Plant Mind      4. The Plane of Elemental Mind (B)      5. The Plane of Animal Mind      6. The Plane of Elemental Mind (C)      7. The Plane of Human Mind    The Plane of Mineral Mind comprises the \"states or conditions\" of the  units or entities, or groups and combinations of the same, which animate  the forms known to us as \"minerals, chemicals, etc.\" These entities must  not be confounded with the molecules, atoms and corpuscles themselves,  the latter being merely the material bodies or forms of these entities,  just as a man's body is but his material form and not \"himself.\" These  entities may be called \"souls\" in one sense, and are living beings of a  low degree of development, life, and mind--just a little more than the  units of \"living energy\" which comprise the higher sub-divisions of the  highest Physical Plane. The average mind does not generally attribute  the possession of mind, soul, or life, to the mineral kingdom, but all  occultists recognize the existence of the same, and modern science is  rapidly moving forward to the point-of-view of the Hermetic, in this  respect. The molecules, atoms and corpuscles have their \"loves and  hates\"; \"likes and dislikes\"; \"attractions and repulsions\". \"affinities  and non-affinities,\" etc., and some of the more daring of modern  scientific minds have expressed the opinion that the desire and will,  emotions and feelings, of the atoms differ only in degree from those of  men. We have no time or space to argue this matter here. All occultists  know it to be a fact, and others are referred to some of the more recent  scientific works for outside corroboration. There are the usual seven  sub-divisions to this plane.    The Plane of Elemental Mind (A) comprises the state or condition, and  degree of mental and vital development of a class of entities unknown to  the average man, but recognized to occultists. They are invisible to the  ordinary senses of man, but, nevertheless, exist and play their part of  the Drama of the Universe. Their degree of intelligence is between that  of the mineral and chemical entities on the one hand, and of the  entities of the plant kingdom on the other. There are seven subdivisions  to this plane, also.    The Plane of Plant Mind, in its seven sub-divisions, comprises the  states or conditions of the entities comprising the kingdoms of the  Plant World, the vital and mental phenomena of which is fairly well  understood by the average intelligent person, many new and interesting  scientific works regarding \"Mind and Life in Plants\" having been  published during the last decade. Plants have life, mind and \"souls,\" as  well as have the animals, man, and super-man.    The Plane of Elemental Mind (B), in its seven sub-divisions, comprises  the states and conditions of a higher form of \"elemental\" or unseen  entities, playing their part in the general work of the Universe, the  mind and life of which form a part of the scale between the Plane of  Plant Mind and the Plane of Animal Mind, the entities partaking of the  nature of both.    The Plane of Animal Mind, in its seven sub-divisions, comprises the  states and conditions of the entities, beings, or souls, animating the  animal forms of life, familiar to us all. It is not necessary to go into  details regarding this kingdom or plane of life, for the animal world is  as familiar to us as is our own.    The Plane of Elemental Mind (C), in its seven sub-divisions, comprises  those entities or beings, invisible as are all such elemental forms,  which partake of the nature of both animal and human life in a degree  and in certain combinations. The highest forms are semi-human in  intelligence.    The Plane of Human Mind, in its seven sub-divisions, comprises those  manifestations of life and mentality which are common to Man, in his  various grades, degrees, and divisions. In this connection, we wish to  point out the fact that the average man of today occupies but the fourth  sub-division of the Plane of Human Mind, and only the most intelligent  have crossed the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14218"],[0,"The Story of Alchemy and the Beginnings of Chemistry (#11)"],[1," is of great weight, and is small.\"    Philalethes says, in _A Brief Guide to the Celestial Ruby_: \"The  Philosopher's Stone is a certain heavenly, spiritual, penetrative, and  fixed substance, which brings all metals to the perfection of gold or  silver (according to the quality of the Medicine), and that by natural  methods, which yet in their effects transcend Nature.... Know then  that it is called a stone, not because it is like a stone, but only  because, by virtue of its fixed nature, it resists the action of fire  as successfully as any stone. In species it is gold, more pure than  the purest; it is fixed and incombustible like a stone, but its  appearance is that of very fine powder, impalpable to the touch, sweet  to the taste, fragrant to the smell, in potency a most penetrative  spirit, apparently dry and yet unctuous, and easily capable of tinging  a plate of metal.... If we say that its nature is spiritual, it would  be no more than the truth; if we described it as corporeal, the  expression would be equally correct.\"    The same author says: \"There is a substance of a metalline species  which looks so cloudy that the universe will have nothing to do with  it. Its visible form is vile; it defiles metalline bodies, and no one  can readily imagine that the pearly drink of bright Phoebus should  spring from thence. Its components are a most pure and tender mercury,  a dry incarcerate sulphur, which binds it and restrains fluxation....  Know this subject, it is the sure basis of all our secrets.... To deal  plainly, it is the child of Saturn, of mean price and great venom....  It is not malleable, though metalline. Its colour is sable, with  intermixed argent which mark the sable fields with veins of glittering  argent.\"    In trying to attach definite meanings to the alchemical accounts of  Principles, Elements, and the One Thing, and the directions which the  alchemists give for changing one substance into others, we are very  apt to be misled by the use of such an expression as _the  transmutation of the elements_. To a chemist that phrase means the  change of an element into another element, an element being a definite  substance, which no one has been able to produce by the combination of  two or more substances unlike itself, or to separate into two or more  substances unlike itself. But whatever may have been the alchemical  meaning of the word _element_, it was certainly not that given to the  same word to-day. Nor did the word _transmutation_ mean to the  alchemist what it means to the chemist.    The facts which are known at present concerning the elements make  unthinkable such a change as that of lead into silver; but new facts  _may_ be discovered which will make possible the separation of lead  into things unlike itself, and the production of silver by the  combination of some of these constituents of lead. The alchemist  supposed he knew such facts as enabled him not only to form a mental  picture of the change of lead into silver, or tin into gold, but also  to assert that such changes must necessarily happen, and to accomplish  them. Although we are quite sure that the alchemist's facts were only  imaginings, we ought not to blame him for his reasoning on what he  took to be facts.    Every metal is now said to be an element, in the modern meaning of  that word: the alchemist regarded the metals as composite substances;  but he also thought of them as more simple than many other things.  Hence, if he was able to transmute one metal into another, he would  have strong evidence in support of his general conception of the  unity of all things. And, as transmutation meant, to the alchemist,  the bringing of a substance to the condition of greatest perfection  possible for that substance, his view of the unity of nature might be  said to be proved if he succeeded in changing one of the metals, one  of these comparatively simple substances, into the most perfect of all  metals, that is, into gold.    The transmutation of the baser metals into gold thus came to be the  practical test of the justness of the alchemical scheme of things.    Some alchemists assert they had themselves performed the great  transmutation; others tell of people who had accomplished the work.  The following story is an example of the accounts given of the making  of gold. It is taken from _John Frederick Helvetius' Golden Calf,  which the world worships and adores_ (17th century):--      \"On the 27th December 1666, in the forenoon, there came to my    house a certain man, who was a complete stranger to me, but of an    honest grave countenance, and an authoritative mien, clothed in a    simple garb.... He was of middle height, his face was long and    slightly pock-marked, his hair was black and straight, his chin    close-shaven, his age about forty-three or forty-four, and his    native province, as far as I could make out, North Holland. After    we had exchanged salutations, he asked me whether he might have    some conversation with me. He wished to say something to me about    the Pyrotechnic Art, as he had read one of my tracts (directed    against the Sympathetic Powder of Dr Digby), in which I hinted a    suspicion whether the Grand Arcanum of the Sages was not after all    a gigantic hoax. He, therefore, took that opportunity of asking me    whether I could not believe that such a grand mystery might exist    in the nature of things, by means of which a physician could    restore any patient whose vitals were not irreparably destroyed. I    answered, 'Such a medicine would be a most desirable acquisition    for any physician; nor can any man tell how many secrets there may    be hidden in Nature; yet, though I have read much about the truth    of this art, it has never been my good fortune to meet with a real    master of the alchemical science.' ... After some further    conversation, the Artist Elias (for it was he) thus addressed me:    'Since you have read so much in the works of the alchemists about    this stone, its substance, its colour and its wonderful effects,    may I be allowed the question, whether you have not prepared it    yourself?' On my answering his question in the negative, he took    out of his bag a cunningly-worked ivory box, in which were three    large pieces of substance resembling glass, or pale sulphur, and    informed me that here was enough of the tincture for the    production of twenty tons of gold. When I had held the precious    treasure in my hand for a quarter of an hour (during which time I    listened to a recital of its wonderful curative properties), I was    compelled to restore it to its owner, which I could not help doing    with a certain degree of reluctance.... My request that he would    give me a piece of his stone (though it were no larger than a    coriander seed), he somewhat brusquely refused, adding, in a    milder tone, that he could not give it me for all the wealth I    possessed, and that not on account of its great preciousness, but    for some other reason which it was not lawful for him to    divulge.... Then he inquired whether I could not show him into a    room at the back of the house, where we should be less liable to    the observation of passers-by. On my conducting him into the state    parlour (which he entered without wiping his dirty boots), he    demanded of me a gold coin, and while I was looking for it, he    produced from his breast pocket a green silk handkerchief, in    which were folded up five medals, the gold of which was infinitely    superior to that of my gold piece.\" Here follows the inscriptions    on the medals. \"I was filled with admiration, and asked my visitor    whence he had obtained that wonderful knowledge of the whole    world. He replied that it was a gift freely bestowed on him by a    friend who had stayed a few days at his house.\" Here follows the    stranger's account of this friend's experiments. \"When my strange    visitor had concluded his narrative, I besought him to give me a    proof of his assertion, by performing the transmutatory operation    on some metals in my presence. He answered evasively, that he    could not do so then, but that he would return in three weeks, and    that, if he was then at liberty to do so, he would show me    something that would make me open my eyes. He appeared punctually    to the promised day, and invited me to take a walk with him, in    the course of which we discoursed profoundly on the secrets of    Nature in fire, though I noticed that my companion was very chary    in imparting information about the Grand Arcanum.... At last I    asked him point blank to show me the transmutation of metals. I    besought him to come and dine with me, and to spend the night at    my house; I entreated; I expostulated; but in vain. He remained    firm. I reminded him of his promise. He retorted that his promise    had been conditional upon his being permitted to reveal the secret    to me. At last, however, I prevailed upon him to give me a piece    of his precious stone--a piece no larger than a grain of rape    seed.... He bid me take half an ounce of lead ... and melt it in    the crucible; for the Medicine would certainly not tinge more of    the base metal than it was sufficient for.... He promised to    return at nine o'clock the next morning.... But at the stated hour    on the following day he did not make his appearance; in his stead,    however, there came, a few hours later, a stranger, who told me    that his friend the artist was unavoidably detained, but that he    would call at three o'clock in the afternoon. The afternoon came;    I waited for him till half-past seven o'clock. He did not appear.    Thereupon my wife came and tempted me to try the transmutation    myself. I determined however to wait till the morrow. On the    morrow ... I asked my wife to put the tincture in wax, and I    myself ... prepared six drachms of lead; I then cast the tincture,"]]]
