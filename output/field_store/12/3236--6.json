Prussia, after riots in Berlin, after promises and delays from the  vacillating King, who one day orders his own troops out of the capital  and his brother, later William I, to England to appease the anger of  the mob, and parades the streets with the colors of the citizens in  revolt wrapped about him; and the next day, surly, obstinate, but ever  orating, holds back from his pledges, finally accepts a constitution  which is probably as little democratic as any in the world.    Of the sixty-five million inhabitants of the German Empire, Prussia  has over forty millions. The Landtag of Prussia is composed of two  chambers, the first called the Herrenhaus, or House of Lords, and the  second the Abgeordnetenhaus, or Chamber of Deputies. This upper house  is made up of the princes of the royal family who are of age; the  descendants of the formerly sovereign families of Hohenzollern-  Hechingen and Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen; chiefs of the princely houses  recognized by the Congress of Vienna; heads of the territorial  nobility formed by the King; representatives of the universities;  burgomasters of towns with more than fifty thousand inhabitants, and  an unlimited number of persons nominated by the King for life or for a  limited period. This upper chamber is a mere drawing-room of the  sovereign's courtiers, though there may be, and as a matter of fact  there are at the present time, representatives even of labor in this  chamber, but in a minority so complete that their actual influence  upon legislation, except in a feeble advisory capacity, amounts to  nothing. In this Herrenhaus, or upper chamber, of Prussia there are at  this writing among the 327 members 3 bankers, 8 representatives of the  industrial and merchant class, and 1 mechanic; 12 in all, or not even  four per cent., to represent the industrial, financial, commercial,  and working classes. Even in the lower chamber, or Abgeordnetenhaus,  there are only 10 merchants, 19 manufacturers, 7 labor  representatives, and 1 bank director, or 37 members who represent the  commercial, manufacturing, and industrial interests in a total  membership of 443.    In the other states of Germany much the same conditions exist. In  Bavaria, in the upper house, or Kammer der Reichsraete, there is no  representative, and in the lower house of 163 members only 29  representatives of the industrial world.    In Saxony, the most socialistic state in Germany, the upper chamber  with 49 members has 5 industrials; the lower chamber with 82 members  has 40 representatives of commercial, industrial, and financial  affairs.    In Wuertemberg, in the upper chamber with 51 members there are 3  industrials; and in the second chamber with 63 members there are 17  industrials.    In Baden, of the 37 members of the upper house there are 6  industrials; of the 73 members of the lower house there are 23  representatives of commerce and industry.    This condition of political inequality is the result of the  maintenance of the old political divisions, despite the fact that in  the last thirty years the whole complexion of the country has changed  radically, due to the rapid increase of the city populations  representing the industrial and commercial progress of a nation that  is now the rival of both the United States and Great Britain. In more  than one instance a town with over 300,000 inhabitants will be  represented in the legislature in the same proportion as a country  population of 30,000. Stettin, for example, with a population of  245,000, which is a seventh of the total population of Pomerania, has  only 6 of the 89 provincial representatives. Further, the three-class  system of voting in Prussia and in the German cities, is a unique  arrangement for giving men the suffrage without either power or  privilege. According to this system every male inhabitant of Prussia  aged twenty-five is entitled to vote in the election of members of the  lower house. The voters, however, are divided into three classes. This  division is made by taking the total amount of the state taxes paid in  each electoral district and dividing it into three equal amounts. The  first third is paid by the highest tax-payers; the second third by the  next highest tax-payers, and the last third by the rest. The first  class consists of a comparatively few wealthy people; it may even  happen that a single individual pays a third of the taxes in a given  district. These three classes then elect the members of an electoral  college, who then elect the member of the house. In Prussia it may be  said roughly that 260,000 wealthy tax-payers elect one-third; 870,000  tax-payers elect one-third, and the other 6,500,000 voters elect one-third  of the members of the electoral college, with the consequence  that the 6,500,000 are not represented at all in the lower house of  Prussia. In order to make this three-class system of voting quite  clear, let us take the case of a city where the same principle may be  seen at work on a smaller scale. In 1910, in the city of Berlin, there  were:    931 voters of the first class paying 27,914,593  marks of the total tax.    32,131 voters of the second class paying  27,908,776 marks of the total tax.    357,345 voters of the third class paying  16,165,501 marks of the total tax.    Roughly the voters in the first class each paid $7,500; those in the  second class $218; those in the third class $11. The 931 voters  elected one-third, 32,131 voters elected one-third, and 357,345  elected one-third of the town councillors. In this same year in Berlin  there were:    521 persons with incomes between $25,000 and $62,500.    139 persons with incomes between $62,500 and $125,000.    22 persons with incomes between $125,000 and $187,500.    19 persons with incomes between $187,000 and $250,000.    19 persons with incomes of $250,000 or more.  Or 720 persons in Berlin in 1912 with incomes  of over $25,000 a year, and they are  practically the governors of the city.    As a result of these divisions according to taxes paid, of the 144  town councillors elected, only 38 were Social-Democrats, though Berlin  is overwhelmingly Social-Democratic, and consequently the affairs of  this city of more than 2,000,000 inhabitants are in the hands of  33,062 persons who elect two-thirds of the town councillors.    In the city of Duesseldorf there were, excluding the suburbs, 62,443  voters at the election for town councillors in 1910. The first class  was composed of 797 voters paying from 1,940 to 264,252 marks of  taxes; 6,645 voters paying from 222 to 1,939 marks; and 55,001 voters  paying 221 marks or less. These 7,442 voters of the first and second  classes were in complete control of the city government by a clear  majority of two-thirds.    It is this three-class system of voting that makes Prussia, and the  Prussian cities as well, impregnable against any assault from the  democratically inclined. In addition to this system, the old electoral  divisions of forty years ago remain unchanged, and consequently the  agricultural east of Prussia, including east and west Prussia,  Brandenburg, Pomerania, Posen, and Silesia, with their large  landholders, return more members to the Prussian lower house than the  much greater population of western industrial Prussia, which includes  Sachsen, Hanover, Westphalia, Schleswig-Holstein, Hohenzollern,  Hessen-Nassau, and the Rhine. Further, the executive government of  Prussia is conducted by a ministry of state, the members of which are  appointed by the King, and hold office at his pleasure, without  control from the Landtag.    How little the people succeeded in extorting from King Frederick  William IV in the way of a constitution may be gathered from this  glimpse of the present political conditions of Prussia.    The local government of Prussia is practically as centralized in a few  hands as the executive government of the state itself. The largest  areas are the provinces, whose chiefs or presidents also are appointed  by the sovereign, and who represent the central government. There are  twelve such provinces in Prussia, ranging in size from the Rhineland  and Brandenburg, with 7,120,519 and 4,093,007 inhabitants  respectively, to Schleswig-Holstein, with 1,619,673.    Each province is divided into two or more government districts, of  which there are thirty-five in all. At the head of each of these  districts is the district president, also appointed by the crown.    In addition there is the Kreis, or Circle, of which there are some  490, with populations varying from 20,000 to 801,000. These circles  are, for all practical purposes, governed by the Landrath, who is  appointed for life by the crown, and who is so fully recognized as the  agent of the central government and not as the servant of the locality  in which he rules, that on one occasion several Landraethe were  summarily dismissed for voting against the government and in  conformity to the wishes of the inhabitants of the circle in which  they lived! Though the Landrath is nominated by the circle assembly  for appointment by the crown, he can be dismissed by his superiors of  the central hierarchy. As his promotion, and his career in fact, is  dependent upon these superiors, he naturally sides with the central  government in all cases of dispute or friction.    Further, and this is important, all officials in Germany are legally  privileged persons. All disputes between individuals and public  authorities in Germany are decided by tribunals quite distinct from  the ordinary courts. These courts are specially constituted, and they  aim at protecting the officials from any personal responsibility for  acts done by them in their official capacity.    In America, and I presume in Great Britain also, any disputes between  public"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19042"],[0,"Animal Figures in the Maya Codices (#11)"],[1," about the eye seems  to be a rather constant mark of the king vulture, though they are also  sometimes found in connection with figures which, from the absence of  the rostral knob, must represent black vultures (Pl. 18, figs. 18, 27;  Pl. 19, figs. 7, 10, 11). In the case of the bird shown in Pl. 19, fig.  1, the knob is hardly apparent, and the same is true of Pl. 19, fig. 13.  Both these may represent king vultures. A remarkable figure is that  shown in Pl. 17, fig. 4, in which an ocellated turkey and a king vulture  confront each other with necks intertwined. The short hair-like black  feathers of the head are represented in this as well as in Pl. 17, fig.  11, and in the glyph carved in stone (Pl. 17, fig. 10), which from the  presence of the knob is probably a king vulture. The characteristic knob  is shown in a variety of ways. Thus, in Pl. 17, fig. 1, it is greatly  developed and resembles a large horn with a falcate tip. In Pl. 17, fig.  4, it is sharply angular and nearly square. Frequently, it is a circle  with a centered ring surmounted by one or two additional rings or  terminated by a mitre-shaped structure (Pl. 17, figs. 2, 5-7, 8-12). A  very simple form was found in the carving shown in Pl. 17, fig. 13,  where a long projecting knob is seen at the base of the culmen.    The king vulture seems to have a part to play as a mythological being,  as it is pictured as a god with human body and bird head in the act of  cohabiting with a woman in Dresden 19a, and with a dog in Dresden 13c  (Pl. 17, fig. 3). Moreover, the same vulture god is represented on a  blue background and under a band of constellation signs in Dresden 38b,  and is also to be noted in Dresden 8a. Foerstemann (1906, p. 66) shows  that the thirteenth day of the Maya month is reached in the _tonalamatl_  reckoning at this place. This day is _Cib_, which corresponds to the  Nahua day _Cozcaquauhtli_, which has the meaning vulture, and here, as  previously noted, the vulture god is represented. In Tro-Cortesianus 22c  (Pl. 17, fig. 2) and 10a,[330-*] the king vulture appears alone, in the  first instance with a blue background, and in the second with a  background representing rain. Rain is also shown in connection with the  vulture god in Dresden 38b, and the black vulture in Tro-Cortesianus 18b  (Pl. 19, fig. 13).    The king vulture is found employed as a head-dress twice out of the  three times it appears in any connection with female figures,  Tro-Cortesianus 26c (Pl. 17, fig. 12) with male figure, and 94c (Pl. 17,  fig. 11) and 95c with female figures. The last two clearly have to do  with the baptism and naming of infants, as previously explained.    The study of the glyph used to indicate the vulture is interesting, for  we find it recurring again and again throughout the Maya codices and  often when there is no other drawing of the animal, as in Dresden 39c  (Pl. 17, fig. 5; Pl. 18, fig. 19). The first example (glyph 6) is  clearly the head of the king vulture, whereas the second (glyph 3) is  probably the head of the black vulture. The glyph in Dresden 38b (Pl.  17, fig. 7) appears in connection with the vulture god directly below  it. In Dresden 11b (Pl. 18, fig. 1), it occurs alone and no figure  appears in the usual place below. The _Tun_ period glyph (Pl. 17, fig.  10) frequently shows vulture characteristics especially in the nostril  of the face. The teeth, however, often appearing in the _Tun_ glyph  would be against this theory. The blending of bird and mammal  characteristics is not uncommon in the Maya drawings, however.    The Nahua day sign, _Cozcaquauhtli_, as previously noted, has the  meaning vulture, and we naturally find this bird frequently represented  in the Mexican codices. In the Nuttall Codex, the head of the king  vulture occurs repeatedly as a glyph for this day. In its less modified  forms (Pl. 18, figs. 2-4), the beak is merely a pair of flattened rami,  surmounted proximally by the conspicuous quadrangular knob. The minute  hair-like feathers on the otherwise naked head are shown as a fringe at  the throat and crown, while a conventionalized ear is represented  posteriorly. A series of interesting figures (Pl. 18, figs. 5-10)  illustrates steps in the further reduction of this head to a small glyph  in which only the beak with its large squarish knob remains (Pl. 18,  fig. 10).    BLACK VULTURE (_Catharista urubu_). It is difficult to assign any single  characteristic to the figures representing the black vulture (Maya,  _t[vs.]om_) other than the long raptorial beak. A number of drawings  probably depict black vultures, though this cannot be certainly  affirmed. Such are those shown in Pl. 18, figs. 11, 12, 14, 17; Pl. 19,  figs. 2-4, 13, 14. Stempell considers the vulture shown in Pl. 18, fig.  13, to be a king vulture, but it has no knob on the beak, and thus is  quite likely the black vulture. The fact that its head is shaped much  like that of the god with the king vulture head (Pl. 17, fig. 3) would  indicate merely the individuality of the artist. The coloring of the  species under discussion is uniformly black in the Dresden and  Tro-Cortesianus, except in certain cases where the birds are shown in  outline only, as in Pl. 19, fig. 12. It is not certain, however, that  these two last are black vultures, though they suggest the species. The  two birds shown in Pl. 19, figs. 5, 6, are almost surely black vultures,  and, as represented in the manuscript, are descending upon a man.  Stempell thinks they may be ravens, but this is very doubtful, for the  raven probably was unknown to the Mayas, since its range is to the  northward. What appears to be a crest is seen on the head of the bird in  Pl. 19, fig. 4. The black coloring and the shape of the bill otherwise  suggest the black vulture, though perhaps the crest would indicate the  harpy eagle. Similarly, Pl. 19, fig. 14, is provided with a sort of tuft  or crest, but its general appearance is suggestive of the vulture. A  pottery whistle (text fig. 2) from the Uloa Valley evidently represents  a black vulture. The head of the bird shows the characteristic wrinkled  appearance seen in the drawings, with the heavy beak. The absence of the  rostral knob would preclude its being a king vulture.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.  POTTERY WHISTLE, VULTURE. ULOA VALLEY, HONDURAS.]    It is natural that this bird should find an important place in the Maya  writing, as it is an abundant species in the region considered, and of  great importance as a scavenger. The black vulture seems to lack the  mythological character associated with the king vulture. It appears  usually in connection with death and in the role of a bird of prey. This  is especially true in the Tro-Cortesianus where in 24d, 26d (Pl. 19,  figs. 5, 6) and 28c, it is attacking a human being, in the first and  last cases represented as dead. In 86a and 87a, the bird is shown  plucking out the eye of a man. In Dresden 3a (Pl. 19, fig. 7), it  appears at the top of the tree above the human sacrifice and seems to be  in the act of consuming the victim. In Tro-Cortesianus 91c, it also  appears in a tree. In Tro-Cortesianus 40a (Pl. 17, fig. 9), and 42a (Pl.  19, fig. 1), it is shown as eating the entrails of a deer. In the first  case, the bird looks like a king vulture, although this is the only  instance where this species is shown as a bird of prey. In  Tro-Cortesianus 28b and 36b (Pl. 18, fig. 17), the black vulture appears  eating the Kan sign. In the first example, the _Kan_ represents the  newly sowed corn, in the second, the _Kan_ is held by god F. Landa  (1864, p. 230)[333-*] records that in the _Cauac_ year there was a  ceremony to prevent the ants and the birds devouring the corn. In  Dresden 34b and 35b, the vulture is shown on top of the head-dress of  god F, evidently the enemy of the harvest and, again, on 35b (Pl. 19,  fig. 4) on top of the _Cauac_ sign. Its role as a bird of prey is  further shown in Dresden 36b (Pl. 19, fig. 11), where it is shown  attacking a serpent.    This vulture is associated with god B in Dresden 69b, with god M in  Tro-Cortesianus 70a (Pl. 18, fig. 12), and with god D in Tro-Cortesianus  67a (Pl. 17, fig. 1). The last may be the king rather than the black  vulture, as suggested above. The black vulture occurs only once as the  usual head-dress, in Dresden 17b (Pl. 18, fig. 13), and here in  connection with a female figure and the idea of birth. Two birds,  probably vultures, appear over the enclosure around the head of god C in  Tro-Cortesianus 100b (Pl. 19, fig. 12). In the Lower Chamber of the  Temple of the Tigers occurs a black vulture in bas-relief with a  necklace represented (Pl. 19, fig. 14).    The glyph of the king vulture has already been discussed. There are  other glyphs which seem to show the black vulture, although it is quite  possible that no sharp distinction was made between the two in regard  to the glyphs at least. In one case (Pl. 18, fig. 18), the wrinkled skin  of the head and neck is indicated much as in the case of the king  vulture. A few other glyphs are shown (Pl. 18, figs. 16, 19, 22, 27), as  well as a variety from the Nuttall Codex in which the minute hair-like  feathers of the head are variously represented, usually much exaggerated  as a sort of crest or comb. Pl. 18, fig. 22, is interesting as being the  only case in the Maya codices where the whole figure is shown in the  glyph. As noted in the case of the glyphs of the king vulture, the  greater number of these occur quite alone. They seem to indicate that a  full drawing of the bird is meant to be understood as occurring below.    Several of the carved glyphs (Pl. 19, figs. 8-10) show the black vulture  heads in some detail with the conspicuously open nostril and hooked  beak. A carving of the entire bird may be shown on Stela D from Copan  (Pl. 28, fig. 5), where the naked head and neck are marked off by lines  indicating wrinkled skin. The same lines on the neck"]]]
