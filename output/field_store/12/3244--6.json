In this law-abiding country the peasantry  conspicuously follow the Confucian maxim taught in China four hundred  years before Christ, \"Do not unto others what you would not have others  do unto you.\" Every rood of ground is under tillage.    Hills are everywhere terraced like the seats of an amphitheatre, each  terrace being irrigated from the one below it by a small stream of  water, drawn up an inclined plain by a continuous chain bucket, worked  with a windlass by either hand or foot. The poppy is everywhere abundant  and well tended; there are fields of winter wheat, and pink-flowered  beans, and beautiful patches of golden rape-seed. Dotted over the  landscape are pretty Szechuen farmhouses in groves of trees. Splendid  banyan trees give grateful shelter to the traveller. Of this country it  could be written as a Chinese traveller wrote of England, \"their fertile  hills, adorned with the richest luxuriance, resemble in the outline of  their summits the arched eyebrows of a fair woman.\"    The country is well populated, and a continuous stream of people is  moving along the road. Grand memorial arches span the roadway, many of  them notable efforts of monumental skill, with columns and architraves  carved with elephants and deer, and flowers and peacocks, and the  Imperial seven-tailed dragon of China. Chinese art is seen at its best  in this rich province.    [Illustration: CULTIVATION IN TERRACES. In the foreground the poppy in  bloom.]    [Illustration: SCENE IN SZECHUEN.]    I lived, of course, in the common Chinese inn, ate Chinese food, and was  everywhere treated with courtesy and good nature; but at first I found  it trying to be such an object of curiosity; to have to do all things in  unsecluded publicity; to have to push my way through streets thronged by  the curious to see the foreigner. My meals I ate in the presence of the  street before gaping crowds. When they came too close I told them  politely in English to keep back a little, and they did so if I  illustrated my words by gesture. When I scratched my head and they saw  the spurious pigtail, they smiled; when I flicked the dust off the table  with my pigtail, they laughed hilariously.    The wayside inns are usually at the side of an arcade of grass and  bamboo stretched above the main road. Two or three ponies are usually  waiting here for hire, and expectant coolies are eager to offer their  services. In engaging a pony you make an offer casually, as if you had  no desire in the world of its being accepted, and then walk on as if you  had no intention whatever of riding for the next month. The mafoo  demands more, but will come down; you stick to your offer, though  prepared to increase it; so demand and offer you exchange with the mafoo  till the width of the village is between you, and your voices are almost  out of hearing, when you come to terms.    Suppose I wanted a chair to give me a rest for a few miles--it was  usually slung under the rafters--Laokwang (my cook) unobserved by anyone  but me pointed to it with his thumb inquiringly. I nodded assent and  apparently nothing more happened and the conversation, of which I was  quite ignorant, continued. We left together on foot, my man still  maintaining a crescendo conversation with the inn people till well away.  When almost out of hearing he called out something and an answer came  faintly back from the distance. It was his ultimatum as regards price  and its acceptance--they had been bargaining all the time. My man  motioned to me to wait, said the one word \"_chiaodza_\" (sedan chair) and  in a few moments the chair of bamboo and wicker came rapidly down the  road carried by two bearers. They put down the chair before me and bowed  to me; I took my seat and was borne easily and pleasantly along at four  miles an hour at a charge of less than one penny a mile.    My men received nearly 400 cash a day each; but from time to time they  sweated their contract to unemployed coolies and had their loads carried  for so little as sixty cash (one penny halfpenny), for two-thirds of a  day's journey.    At nightfall we always reached some large village or town where my cook  selected the best inn for my resting place, the best inn in such cases  being usually the one which promised him the largest squeeze. All the  towns through which the road passes swarm with inns, for there is an  immense floating population to provide for. Competition is keen. Touts  stand at the doorway of every inn, who excitedly waylay the traveller  and cry the merits of their houses. At the counter inside the entrance,  piles of pukais (the warm Chinese bedding), are stacked for hire--few of  the travellers carry their own bedding. The inns are sufficiently  comfortable. The bedrooms are in one or two stories and are arranged  round one or more, or a succession of courts. The cheapness is to be  commended. For supper, bed, and light, tea during the night and tea  before starting in the morning, and various little comforts, such as hot  water for washing, the total charge for the six nights of my journey  from Chungking to Suifu was 840 cash (_1s. 9d._).    Rice was my staple article of diet; eggs, fowls, and vegetables were  also abundant and cheap; but I avoided pork which is the flesh  universally eaten throughout China by all but the Mohammedans and  vegetarians. In case of emergency I had a few tins of foreign stores  with me. I made it a point never to drink water--I drank tea. No  Chinaman ever drinks anything cold. Every half hour or hour he can reach  an inn or teahouse where tea can be infused for him in a few minutes.  The price of a bowl of tea with a pinch of tea-leaves, filled and  refilled with hot water _ad lib_, is two cash--equal to the twentieth  part of one penny. Pork has its weight largely added to by being  injected with water, the point of the syringe being passed into a large  vein; this is usually described as the Chinese method of \"watering  stock.\"    On the third day we were at Yuenchuan, sixty-three miles from Chungking.  On the 5th, we passed through Luchow, one of the richest and most  populous cities on the Upper Yangtse, and at noon next day we again  reached the Yangtse at the Temple of the Goddess of Mercy, two miles  down the river from the large town of Lanchihsien. According to my  interpretation of the gesticulations of Laokwang, we were then forty  miles from Suifu, and a beautiful sunny afternoon before us, in which to  easily cover one half the distance. But I must reckon with my guide. He  wished to remain here; I wished to go on; but as I could not understand  his Chinese explanation, nor advance any protest except in English, of  which he was innocent, I could only look aggrieved and make a virtue of  a necessity. He did, however, convey to me his solemn assurance that  to-morrow (_ming tien_) he would conduct me into Suifu before sunset. An  elderly Chinaman, who had given us the advantage of his company at  various inns during the last three days, here entered into the  conversation, produced his watch, and, with his hand over his heart,  which, in a Chinaman, is in the centre of the breast-bone, added his  sacred asseveration to my guide's. So I stayed. We were quite a friendly  party travelling together.    In the middle of the night a light was flashed into our room and a voice  pealed out an alarm that awoke even my two Chinese, who always  obligingly slept in the same room with me. I had protested against their  doing so, but they mistook my expostulation for approbation. We rose at  once, and came down the steep bank to a boat that was lying stern to  shore showing a light. I was charmed to get such an early start, and  construed the indications into a ferry boat to take me across the river,  whence we would go by a short route into Suifu. The boat was loaded with  sugar and had a crew of two men and three boys. There was an awning over  the cargo, but most of the space under it was already occupied by twelve  amiable Chinese, among whom were six promiscuous friends, who had kept  with us for several stages, and had, I imagine, derived some pecuniary  advantages from my company. Yet this was not a ferry boat, but a  passenger boat engaged especially for me to carry me to Suifu before  nightfall. The Chinese passengers had courteously projected their  companionship upon the inarticulate stranger. An elderly gentleman, with  huge goggles and long nails, whose fingers were stained with opium, was  the pacificator of the party, and calmed the frequent wranglings in  which the other eighteen Chinese engaged with much earnestness.    Well, this boat--a leaky, heavy, old tub that had to be tracked nearly  all the way--carried me the forty miles to Suifu within contract time.  The boatmen on board worked sixteen hours without any rest except at two  hasty meals; the frayed towrope never parted at any rapid, and only once  did our boat get entangled with any other. Towards sundown we were  abreast of the fine pagoda of Suifu, and a little later were at the  landing. The city is on a high, level shelf of land with high hills  behind it. It lies in the angle of bifurcation formed by the Yangtse  river (here known as the \"River of Golden Sand\"), going west, and the  Min, or Chentu river, going north to Chentu, the capital city of the  province. I landed below the southern wall, and said good-bye to my  companions. Climbing up the bank into the city, I passed by a busy  thoroughfare to the pretty home of the Inland Mission, where I received  a kind welcome from the gentleman and lady who conduct the mission, and  a charming English girl, also in the mission, who lives with them.

A few thousand dollars loaned, or even  donated, may prove to be a valuable investment for the people at  large, and, even supposing a failure, would not be a very great loss  to any body.    So far as farmers are concerned, it may interest them to know that one  man in England, Capt. Mason, clears $50 per acre by rearing silkworms  (_Bombyx mori_ in this case), and I much doubt whether any crop raised  here pays as well.    By way of commencement, then, let everybody that has sufficient  leisure set to work, and rear as many silkworms, of the above-named  species, as he possibly can; and if the process be not remunerative in  a pecuniary sense, it most assuredly will be in the amount of pleasure  and knowledge obtained.    One caution I must give to those who cultivate _Bombyx mori_. Although  _Yamamai_ requires sprinkled branches, _Bombyx mori_ does not; nor  must the leaves be furnished to them while wet with rain or dew.           *       *       *       *       *      EFFECT OF COLD UPON IRON.--The article upon this subject, giving  experiments of Fairbairn and others, referred to in our editorial  upon the same subject, in our last issue, was crowded out by press of  matter.

Our readers will recollect an illustrated description of an universal  wood-working machine, published on page 79, Vol. XIII. of the  SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN. The machine herewith illustrated is manufactured  by the same firm, and is a valuable addition to the many excellent  wood-working machines now in use. A boring machine, though one of the  simplest, is by no means an unimportant adjunct to a full outfit of  wood-working machines. The one shown in our engraving is one of the  most complete ever brought to our notice, and the great variety of  work it is capable of performing, renders the name chosen for it  peculiarly applicable. It is called the \"Universal Boring Machine\"  because the most prominent feature of its construction is its power to  bore a hole in any desired angle with the axis of the bit.    Any sized bit required is inserted into the chuck, which is adjustable  to fit large and small shanks. The mandrel which carries the chuck is  made to traverse by a foot lever, so as to bore any depth up to twelve  inches. The mandrel is driven by belt from a cone pulley of three  faces, which gives the proper speeds for different sized bits.    Slots and stops upon the table enable the work to be set at any  desired angle on the horizontal plane, while the table can be set on  an incline to any angle not exceeding forty-five degrees. The table  is twenty-one inches wide, with fifteen inches slide, and it can be  raised or lowered fifteen inches.    The countershaft rests in self-adjusting boxes, and has a tight and  a loose pulley eight inches in diameter. The traversing mandrel is of  the best quality of steel, and the machine is otherwise made of iron  in a substantial manner.    [Illustration: McBETH, BENTEL, & MARGEDANT'S UNIVERSAL BORING  MACHINE.]    The several adjustments enable the operator to do all kinds of light  and heavy boring, with ease and with great rapidity.    This machine was awarded the first premium at the Cincinnati  Industrial Exposition, in October, 1870, and was patented through the  Scientific American Patent Agency, Aug. 16, 1870. It is manufactured  by McBeth, Bentel and Margedant, of Hamilton, Ohio, whom address for  machines rights to manufacture, or other information.           *       *       *       *       *          COMBINED TRUNK AND ROCKING CHAIR.      A unique invention, calculated to increase the comforts of travellers  on steamboats, ships, and in crowded rooms of hotels, is illustrated  in the engraving published herewith. It is the invention of T. Nye,  of Westbrook, Me., and was patented by him, June 18, 1867. It is a  combined trunk and rocking chair. The rockers are made to fold into  recesses, where they are retained by suitable appliances till wanted.  The trunk being opened, as shown, forms a back to the seat, which  is held by metallic braces. When closed, the whole presents the  appearance of an ordinary trunk.    [Illustration]           *       *       *       *       *          COSMETICS.      The extensive use of preparations for hiding nature's bloom on the  human countenance, and presenting to our view a sort of metallic  plaster, suggests the inquiry, \"how are these pigments made?\" Without  going into an unnecessary analysis of the \"Bloom of Youth,\" the  \"Rejuvenator,\" the \"Corpse Decorator,\" or the other inventions for  destroying the skin, with which the druggists' stores abound, we  may state again the fact, always unheeded, that all the detestable  compounds are injurious. They are nearly all metallic poisons, and,  if there be any that are innocent of this charge, they are in every  instance harmful to the health. The color and surface of the skin  cannot be changed by any application which does not close the pores;  the pores, which are so exquisitely fine that there are millions of  them to the square inch, and which must be kept open if a healthy and  cleanly body is to be preserved. There is more breathing done through  the pores of a healthy person than through the lungs; and we need not  remind our readers of a ghastly piece of cruelty once enacted in Paris  (that of gilding the body of a child, for a triumphal procession,  which killed the subject in two hours), to show that the stoppage, in  any degree, of the natural functions of so important an organ as the  skin, is injurious. The immediate effect of the use of such compounds  is to destroy the vitality of the skin, and to render it, in  appearance, a piece of shriveled parchment. We must warn our readers  that a temporary and meretricious \"bloom\" can only be attained at the  cost of future freshness and lively appearance, so that a year or two  of \"looking like paint\" is followed by a long period of \"looking like  dilapidation.\"           *       *       *       *       *          SMITH'S INFANT DINING CHAIR.      The accompanying engraving illustrates a convenient and cheap infant  dining chair, which can be attached to any of the ordinary chairs in  common use.    [Illustration]    It consists of a chair without legs, suspended by the posts of the  back, as shown, on pins engaging with hooked bars, which are placed  upon the back of an ordinary chair. The details of the device will be  seen by a glance at the engraving. The chair is adjusted in hight  by placing the pins in the proper holes in the posts made for this  purpose.

At the recent commencement of the Homeopathic College in this city,  Mr. S. H. Wales, of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN addressed the graduating  class, and from his remarks, we quote the following:    \"Many writers of our time persist in regarding this, above all others,  as the best period in the history of our race; and, doubtless, it is  true in many important respects. But I cannot forbear the suggestion  at this moment that there was a time in the history of the world  when the science of medicine was unknown, when people lived to the  incredible age of many centuries; and, even after the span of life  had been reduced to threescore and ten, sickness was comparatively  unknown. In ancient times, it was looked upon as a calamity, that  had overtaken a tribe or people, when one of its members prematurely  sickened and died.    \"Other arts and sciences flourished in Rome long before medicine  was thought of; and the historian tells us that the first doctor who  settled in Rome, some two hundred years before Christ, was banished on  account of his poor success and the very severe treatment applied to  his patients; and it was a hundred years before the next one came. He  rose to great popularity, simply because he allowed his patients to  drink all the wine they wanted, and to eat their favorite dishes.  Some writer on hygiene has made the statement that the whole code  of medical ethics presented by Moses consisted simply in bathing,  purification, and diet. This simplicity of life was not confined to  the wandering tribes who settled in the land of Canaan, but was the  universal custom of all nations of which history gives us any account.  This simple arrangement for health was considered enough in those  primitive times, when the human system had not been worn out and  exhausted by depletive medicines. The luxuries of public baths,  athletic sports and games were deemed ample, both to educate the  physical perceptions and to prevent disease.    \"All this wisdom, which had its origin in ancient games and sports  of the field, led to the erection of extensive bath-houses, and the  adoption of other healthful luxuries to which all the people could  resort to recreate their wasted powers.\"           *       *       *       *       *          BARNES' VENTILATOR FOR MATTRESSES, ETC.      Many diseases are caused by the use of beds not properly aired; and  it is difficult, if not impossible, to properly air, or ventilate,  a mattress, made in the usual manner. If this could be done more  thoroughly than it generally is, much sickness would be avoided.    [Illustration]    To secure this object cheaply and efficiently is the design of the  invention herewith illustrated. By it a complete circulation of  air through the mattress is secured, which carries off all dampness  arising from constant use. Thus the mattress becomes more healthy for  sleeping purposes, more durable and better fitted for the sick room.  The ventilators consist of coiled wire, covered with coarse cloth  (to"]]]
