It was a hand, seemingly, as  much of flesh and blood as my own, but the hand of an aged person,  lean, wrinkled, small too,--a woman's hand.  That hand very softly  closed on the two letters that lay on the table; hand and letters  both vanished.  There then came the same three loud, measured  knocks I had heard at the bed head before this extraordinary drama  had commenced.    As those sounds slowly ceased, I felt the whole room vibrate  sensibly; and at the far end there rose, as from the floor, sparks  or globules like bubbles of light, many colored,--green, yellow,  fire-red, azure.  Up and down, to and fro, hither, thither as tiny  Will-o'-the-Wisps, the sparks moved, slow or swift, each at its own  caprice.  A chair (as in the drawing-room below) was now advanced  from the wall without apparent agency, and placed at the opposite  side of the table.  Suddenly, as forth from the chair, there grew a  shape,--a woman's shape.  It was distinct as a shape of life,--  ghastly as a shape of death.  The face was that of youth, with a  strange, mournful beauty; the throat and shoulders were bare, the  rest of the form in a loose robe of cloudy white.  It began  sleeking its long, yellow hair, which fell over its shoulders; its  eyes were not turned toward me, but to the door; it seemed  listening, watching, waiting.  The shadow of the shade in the  background grew darker; and again I thought I beheld the eyes  gleaming out from the summit of the shadow,--eyes fixed upon that  shape.    As if from the door, though it did not open, there grew out another  shape, equally distinct, equally ghastly,--a man's shape, a young  man's.  It was in the dress of the last century, or rather in a  likeness of such dress (for both the male shape and the female,  though defined, were evidently unsubstantial, impalpable,--  simulacra, phantasms); and there was something incongruous,  grotesque, yet fearful, in the contrast between the elaborate  finery, the courtly precision of that old-fashioned garb, with its  ruffles and lace and buckles, and the corpselike aspect and  ghostlike stillness of the flitting wearer.  Just as the male shape  approached the female, the dark Shadow started from the wall, all  three for a moment wrapped in darkness.  When the pale light  returned, the two phantoms were as if in the grasp of the Shadow  that towered between them; and there was a blood stain on the  breast of the female; and the phantom male was leaning on its  phantom sword, and blood seemed trickling fast from the ruffles  from the lace; and the darkness of the intermediate Shadow  swallowed them up,--they were gone.  And again the bubbles of light  shot, and sailed, and undulated, growing thicker and thicker and  more wildly confused in their movements.    The closet door to the right of the fireplace now opened, and from  the aperture there came the form of an aged woman.  In her hand she  held letters,--the very letters over which I had seen THE Hand  close; and behind her I heard a footstep.  She turned round as if  to listen, and then she opened the letters and seemed to read; and  over her shoulder I saw a livid face, the face as of a man long  drowned,--bloated, bleached, seaweed tangled in its dripping hair;  and at her feet lay a form as of a corpse; and beside the corpse  there cowered a child, a miserable, squalid child, with famine in  its cheeks and fear in its eyes.  And as I looked in the old  woman's face, the wrinkles and lines vanished, and it became a face  of youth,--hard-eyed, stony, but still youth; and the Shadow darted  forth, and darkened over these phantoms as it had darkened over the  last.    Nothing now was left but the Shadow, and on that my eyes were  intently fixed, till again eyes grew out of the Shadow,--malignant,  serpent eyes.  And the bubbles of light again rose and fell, and in  their disordered, irregular, turbulent maze, mingled with the wan  moonlight.  And now from these globules themselves, as from the  shell of an egg, monstrous things burst out; the air grew filled  with them: larvae so bloodless and so hideous that I can in no way  describe them except to remind the reader of the swarming life  which the solar microscope brings before his eyes in a drop of  water,--things transparent, supple, agile, chasing each other,  devouring each other; forms like naught ever beheld by the naked  eye.  As the shapes were without symmetry, so their movements were  without order.  In their very vagrancies there was no sport; they  came round me and round, thicker and faster and swifter, swarming  over my head, crawling over my right arm, which was outstretched in  involuntary command against all evil beings.  Sometimes I felt  myself touched, but not by them; invisible hands touched me.  Once  I felt the clutch as of cold, soft fingers at my throat.  I was  still equally conscious that if I gave way to fear I should be in  bodily peril; and I concentered all my faculties in the single  focus of resisting stubborn will.  And I turned my sight from the  Shadow; above all, from those strange serpent eyes,--eyes that had  now become distinctly visible.  For there, though in naught else  around me, I was aware that there was a WILL, and will of intense,  creative, working evil, which might crush down my own.    The pale atmosphere in the room began now to redden as if in the  air of some near conflagration.  The larvae grew lurid as things  that live in fire.  Again the room vibrated; again were heard the  three measured knocks; and again all things were swallowed up in  the darkness of the dark Shadow, as if out of that darkness all had  come, into that darkness all returned.    As the gloom receded, the Shadow was wholly gone.  Slowly, as it  had been withdrawn, the flame grew again into the candles on the  table, again into the fuel in the grate.  The whole room came once  more calmly, healthfully into sight.    The two doors were still closed, the door communicating with the  servant's room still locked.  In the corner of the wall, into which  he had so convulsively niched himself, lay the dog.  I called to  him,--no movement; I approached,--the animal was dead: his eyes  protruded; his tongue out of his mouth; the froth gathered round  his jaws.  I took him in my arms; I brought him to the fire.  I  felt acute grief for the loss of my poor favorite,--acute self-  reproach; I accused myself of his death; I imagined he had died of  fright.  But what was my surprise on finding that his neck was  actually broken.  Had this been done in the dark?  Must it not have  been by a hand human as mine; must there not have been a human  agency all the while in that room?  Good cause to suspect it.  I  cannot tell.  I cannot do more than state the fact fairly; the  reader may draw his own inference.    Another surprising circumstance,--my watch was restored to the  table from which it had been so mysteriously withdrawn; but it had  stopped at the very moment it was so withdrawn, nor, despite all  the skill of the watchmaker, has it ever gone since,--that is, it  will go in a strange, erratic way for a few hours, and then come to  a dead stop; it is worthless.    Nothing more chanced for the rest of the night.  Nor, indeed, had I  long to wait before the dawn broke.  Not till it was broad daylight  did I quit the haunted house.  Before I did so, I revisited the  little blind room in which my servant and myself had been for a  time imprisoned.  I had a strong impression--for which I could not  account--that from that room had originated the mechanism of the  phenomena, if I may use the term, which had been experienced in my  chamber.  And though I entered it now in the clear day, with the  sun peering through the filmy window, I still felt, as I stood on  its floors, the creep of the horror which I had first there  experienced the night before, and which had been so aggravated by  what had passed in my own chamber.  I could not, indeed, bear to  stay more than half a minute within those walls.  I descended the  stairs, and again I heard the footfall before me; and when I opened  the street door, I thought I could distinguish a very low laugh.  I  gained my own home, expecting to find my runaway servant there; but  he had not presented himself, nor did I hear more of him for three  days, when I received a letter from him, dated from Liverpool to  this effect:--      \"HONORED SIR,--I humbly entreat your pardon, though I can scarcely  hope that you will think that I deserve it, unless--which Heaven  forbid!--you saw what I did.  I feel that it will be years before I  can recover myself; and as to being fit for service, it is out of  the question.  I am therefore going to my brother-in-law at  Melbourne.  The ship sails to-morrow.  Perhaps the long voyage may  set me up.  I do nothing now but start and tremble, and fancy it is  behind me.  I humbly beg you, honored sir, to order my clothes, and  whatever wages are due to me, to be sent to my mother's, at  Walworth,--John knows her address.\"      The letter ended with additional apologies, somewhat incoherent,  and explanatory details as to effects that had been under the  writer's charge.    This flight may perhaps warrant a suspicion that the man wished to  go to Australia, and had been somehow or other fraudulently mixed  up with the events of the night.  I say nothing in refutation of  that conjecture; rather, I suggest it as one that would seem to  many persons the most probable solution of improbable occurrences.  My belief in my own theory remained unshaken.  I returned in the  evening to the house, to bring away in a hack cab the things I had  left there, with my poor dog's body.  In this task I was not  disturbed, nor did any incident worth note befall me, except that  still, on ascending and descending the stairs, I heard the same  footfall in advance.

The tiny creature, no  bigger than a flea, has preserved its tender newly-hatched flesh from  contact with the rough earth by hanging in the air until its tissues  have hardened. Now it plunges into the troubles of life.    I foresee a thousand dangers ahead. A mere breath of wind may carry this  atom away, and cast it on that inaccessible rock in the midst of a rut  in the road which still contains a little water; or on the sand, the  region of famine where nothing grows; or upon a soil of clay, too  tenacious to be tunnelled. These mortal accidents are frequent, for  gusts of wind are frequent in the windy and already severe weather of  the end of October.    This delicate organism requires a very soft soil, which can easily be  entered, so that it may immediately obtain a suitable shelter. The cold  days are coming; soon the frosts will be here. To wander on the surface  would expose it to grave perils. It must contrive without delay to  descend into the earth, and that to no trivial depth. This is the unique  and imperative condition of safety, and in many cases it is impossible  of realisation. What use are the claws of this tiny flea against rock,  sandstone, or hardened clay? The creature must perish if it cannot find  a subterranean refuge in good time.    Everything goes to show that the necessity of this first foothold on the  soil, subject as it is to so many accidents, is the cause of the great  mortality in the Cigale family. The little black parasite, the destroyer  of eggs, in itself evokes the necessity of a large batch of eggs; and  the difficulty which the larva experiences in effecting a safe lodgment  in the earth is yet another explanation of the fact that the maintenance  of the race at its proper strength requires a batch of three or four  hundred eggs from each mother. Subject to many accidents, the Cigale is  fertile to excess. By the prodigality of her ovaries she conjures the  host of perils which threaten her offspring.    During the rest of my experiment I can at least spare the larvae the  worst difficulties of their first establishment underground. I take some  soil from the heath, which is very soft and almost black, and I pass it  through a fine sieve. Its colour will enable me more easily to find the  tiny fair-skinned larvae when I wish to inform myself of passing events;  its lightness makes it a suitable refuge for such weak and fragile  beings. I pack it Pretty firmly in a glass vase; I plant in it a little  tuft of thyme; I sow in it a few grains of wheat. There is no hole at  the bottom of the vase, although there should be one for the benefit of  the thyme and the corn; but the captives would find it and escape by it.  The plantation and the crop will suffer from this lack of drainage, but  at least I am sure of recovering my larvae with the help of patience and  a magnifying-glass. Moreover, I shall go gently in the matter of  irrigation, giving only just enough water to save the plants from  perishing.    When all is in order, and when the wheat is beginning to shoot, I place  six young larvae of the Cigale on the surface of the soil. The tiny  creatures begin to pace hither and thither; they soon explore the  surface of their world, and some try vainly to climb the sides of the  vase. Not one of them seems inclined to bury itself; so that I ask  myself anxiously what can be the object of their prolonged and active  explorations. Two hours go by, but their wanderings continue.    What do they want? Food? I offer them some tiny bulbs with bundles of  sprouting roots, a few fragments of leaves and some fresh blades of  grass. Nothing tempts them; nothing brings them to a standstill.  Apparently they are seeking for a favourable point before descending  into the earth. But there is no need for this hesitating exploration on  the soil I have prepared for them; the whole area, or so it seems to me,  lends itself excellently to the operations which I am expecting to see  them commence. Yet apparently it will not answer the purpose.    Under natural conditions a little wandering might well be indispensable.  Spots as soft as my bed of earth from the roots of the briar-heather,  purged of all hard bodies and finely sifted, are rare in nature. Coarse  soils are more usual, on which the tiny creatures could make no  impression. The larva must wander at hazard, must make a pilgrimage of  indefinite duration before finding a favourable place. Very many, no  doubt, perish, exhausted by their fruitless search. A voyage of  exploration in a country a few inches wide evidently forms part of the  curriculum of young Cigales. In my glass prison, so luxuriously  furnished, this pilgrimage is useless. Never mind: it must be  accomplished according to the consecrated rites.    At last my wanderers grow less excited. I see them attack the earth with  the curved talons of their fore-limbs, digging their claws into it and  making such an excavation as the point of a thick needle would enter.  With a magnifying-glass I watch their picks at work. I see their talons  raking atom after atom of earth to the surface. In a few minutes there  is a little gaping well. The larva climbs downwards and buries itself,  henceforth invisible.    On the morrow I turn out the contents of the vase without breaking the  mould, which is held together by the roots of the thyme and the wheat. I  find all my larvae at the bottom, arrested by the glass. In twenty-four  hours they had sunk themselves through the entire thickness of the  earth--a matter of some four inches. But for obstacle at the bottom they  would have sunk even further.    On the way they have probably encountered the rootlets of my little  plantation. Did they halt in order to take a little nourishment by  implanting their proboscis? This is hardly probable, for a few rootlets  were pressed against the bottom of the glass, but none of my prisoners  were feeding. Perhaps the shock of reversing the pot detached them.    It is obvious that underground there is no other nourishment for them  than the sap of roots. Adult or larva, the Cigale is a strict  vegetarian. As an adult insect it drinks the sap of twigs and branches;  as a larva it sucks the sap of roots. But at what stage does it take the  first sip? That I do not know as yet, but the foregoing experiment seems  to show that the newly hatched larva is in greater haste to burrow deep  into the soil, so as to obtain shelter from the coming winter, than to  station itself at the roots encountered in its passage downwards.    I replace the mass of soil in the vase, and the six exhumed larvae are  once more placed on the surface of the soil. This time they commence to  dig at once, and have soon disappeared. Finally the vase is placed in my  study window, where it will be subject to the influences, good and ill,  of the outer air.    A month later, at the end of November, I pay the young Cigales a second  visit. They are crouching, isolated at the bottom of the mould. They do  not adhere to the roots; they have not grown; their appearance has not  altered. Such as they were at the beginning of the experiment, such they  are now, but rather less active. Does not this lack of growth during  November, the mildest month of winter, prove that no nourishment is  taken until the spring?    The young Sitares, which are also very minute, directly they issue from  the egg at the entrance of the tubes of the Anthrophorus, remain  motionless, assembled in a heap, and pass the whole of the winter in a  state of complete abstinence. The young Cigales apparently behave in a  very similar fashion. Once they have burrowed to such depths as will  safeguard them from the frosts they sleep in solitude in their winter  quarters, and await the return of spring before piercing some  neighbouring root and taking their first repast.    I have tried unsuccessfully to confirm these deductions by observation.  In April I unpotted my plant of thyme for the third time. I broke up the  mould and spread it under the magnifying-glass. It was like looking for  needles in a haystack; but at last I recovered my little Cigales. They  were dead, perhaps of cold, in spite of the bell-glass with which I had  covered the pot, or perhaps of starvation, if the thyme was not a  suitable food-plant. I give up the problem as too difficult of solution.    To rear such larvae successfully one would require a deep, extensive bed  of earth which would shelter them from the winter cold; and, as I do not  know what roots they prefer, a varied vegetation, so that the little  creatures could choose according to their taste. These conditions are by  no means impracticable, but how, in the large earthy mass, containing at  least a cubic yard of soil, should we recover the atoms I had so much  trouble to find in a handful of black soil from the heath? Moreover,  such a laborious search would certainly detach the larva from its root.    The early subterranean life of the Cigale escapes us. That of the  maturer larva is no better known. Nothing is more common, while digging  in the fields to any depth, to find these impetuous excavators under the  spade; but to surprise them fixed upon the roots which incontestably  nourish them is quite another matter. The disturbance of the soil warns  the larva of danger. It withdraws its proboscis in order to retreat  along its galleries, and when the spade uncovers it has ceased to feed.    If the hazards of field-work, with its inevitable disturbance of the  larvae, cannot teach us anything of their subterranean habits, we can at  least learn something of the duration of the larval stage. Some obliging  farmers, who were making some deep excavations in March, were good  enough to collect for me all the larvae, large and small, unearthed in  the course of their labour. The total collection amounted to several  hundreds. They were divided, by very clearly marked differences of size,  into"]]]
