THE ITALIAN MIND: There is no way of explaining the Italian fondness  for form and color other than by considering the necessities of the  people and the artistic character of the Italian mind. Art in all its  phases was not only an adornment but a necessity of Christian  civilization. The Church taught people by sculpture, mosaic,  miniature, and fresco. It was an object-teaching, a grasping of ideas  by forms seen in the mind, not a presenting of abstract ideas as in  literature. Printing was not known. There were few manuscripts, and  the majority of people could not read. Ideas came to them for  centuries through form and color, until at last the Italian mind took  on a plastic and pictorial character. It saw things in symbolic  figures, and when the Renaissance came and art took the lead as one of  its strongest expressions, painting was but the color-thought and  form-language of the people.    [Illustration: FIG. 26.--FRA FILIPPO. MADONNA. UFFIZI.]    And these people, by reason of their peculiar education, were an  exacting people, knowing what was good and demanding it from the  artists. Every Italian was, in a way, an art critic, because every  church in Italy was an art school. The artists may have led the  people, but the people spurred on the artists, and so the Italian mind  went on developing and unfolding until at last it produced the great  art of the Renaissance.    THE AWAKENING: The Italian civilization of the fourteenth century was  made up of many impulses and inclinations, none of them very strongly  defined. There was a feeling about in the dark, a groping toward the  light, but the leaders stumbled often on the road. There was good  reason for it. The knowledge of the ancient world lay buried under the  ruins of Rome. The Italians had to learn it all over again, almost  without a precedent, almost without a preceptor. With the fifteenth  century the horizon began to brighten. The Early Renaissance was  begun. It was not a revolt, a reaction, or a starting out on a new  path. It was a development of the Gothic period; and the three  inclinations of the Gothic period--religion, the desire for classic  knowledge, and the study of nature--were carried into the art of the  time with greater realization.    The inference must not be made that because nature and the antique  came to be studied in Early Renaissance times that therefore religion  was neglected. It was not. It still held strong, and though with the  Renaissance there came about a strange mingling of crime and  corruption, aestheticism and immorality, yet the Church was never  abandoned for an hour. When enlightenment came, people began to doubt  the spiritual power of the Papacy. They did not cringe to it so  servilely as before. Religion was not violently embraced as in the  Middle Ages, but there was no revolt. The Church held the power and  was still the patron of art. The painter's subjects extended over  nature, the antique, the fable, allegory, history, portraiture; but  the religious subject was not neglected. Fully three-quarters of all  the fifteenth-century painting was done for the Church, at her  command, and for her purposes.    But art was not so wholly pietistic as in the Gothic age. The study of  nature and the antique materialized painting somewhat. The outside  world drew the painter's eyes, and the beauty of the religious subject  and its sentiment were somewhat slurred for the beauty of natural  appearances. There was some loss of religious power, but religion had  much to lose. In the fifteenth century it was still dominant.    [Illustration: FIG. 27.--BOTTICELLI. CORONATION OF MADONNA. UFFIZI.]    KNOWLEDGE OF THE ANTIQUE AND NATURE: The revival of antique learning  came about in real earnest during this period. The scholars set  themselves the task of restoring the polite learning of ancient  Greece, studying coins and marbles, collecting manuscripts, founding  libraries and schools of philosophy. The wealthy nobles, Palla  Strozzi, the Albizzi, the Medici, and the Dukes of Urbino, encouraged  it. In 1440 the Greek was taught in five cities. Immediately  afterward, with Constantinople falling into the hands of the Turks,  came an influx of Greek scholars into Italy. Then followed the  invention of printing and the age of discovery on land and sea. Not  the antique alone but the natural were being pried into by the spirit  of inquiry. Botany, geology, astronomy, chemistry, medicine, anatomy,  law, literature--nothing seemed to escape the keen eye of the time.  Knowledge was being accumulated from every source, and the arts were  all reflecting it.    The influence of the newly discovered classic marbles upon painting  was not so great as is usually supposed. The painters studied them,  but did not imitate them. Occasionally in such men as Botticelli and  Mantegna we see a following of sculpturesque example--a taking of  details and even of whole figures--but the general effect of the  antique marbles was to impress the painters with the idea that nature  was at the bottom of it all. They turned to the earth not only to  study form and feature, but to learn perspective, light, shadow,  color--in short, the technical features of art. True, religion was the  chief subject, but nature and the antique were used to give it  setting. All the fifteenth-century painting shows nature study, force,  character, sincerity; but it does not show elegance, grace, or the  full complement of color. The Early Renaissance was the promise of  great things; the High Renaissance was the fulfilment.    FLORENTINE SCHOOL: The Florentines were draughtsmen more than  colorists. The chief medium was fresco on the walls of buildings, and  architectural necessities often dictated the form of compositions.  Distemper in easel pictures was likewise used, and oil-painting,  though known, was not extensively employed until the last quarter of  the century. In technical knowledge and intellectual grasp Florence  was at this time the leader and drew to her many artists from  neighboring schools. Masaccio (1401?-1428?) was the first great nature  student of the Early Renaissance, though his master, Masolino  (1383-1447), had given proof positive of severe nature study in bits  of modelling, in drapery, and in portrait heads. Masaccio, however,  seems the first to have gone into it thoroughly and to have grasped  nature as a whole. His mastery of form, his plastic composition, his  free, broad folds of drapery, and his knowledge of light and  perspective, all placed him in the front rank of fifteenth-century  painters. Though an exact student he was not a literalist. He had a  large artistic sense, a breadth of view, and a comprehension of nature  as a mass that Michael Angelo and Raphael did not disdain to follow.  He was not a pietist, and there was no great religious feeling in his  work. Dignified truthful appearance was his creed, and in this he was  possibly influenced by Donatello the sculptor.    [Illustration: FIG. 28.--GHIRLANDAJO. THE VISITATION. LOUVRE.]    He came early in the century and died early, but his contemporaries  did not continue the advance from where he carried it. There was  wavering all along the line. Some from lack of genius could not equal  him, others took up nature with indecision, and others clung fondly  to the gold-embossed ornaments and gilded halos of the past. Paolo  Uccello (1397?-1475), Andrea Castagno (1390-1457), Benozzo Gozzoli  (1420?-1497?), Baldovinetti (1427-1499), Antonio del Pollajuolo  (1426-1498), Cosimo Rosselli (1439-1507), can hardly be looked upon as  improvements upon the young leader. The first real successor of  Masaccio was his contemporary, and possibly his pupil, the monk Fra  Filippo Lippi (1406-1469). He was a master of color and  light-and-shade for his time,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18908"],[0,"Christmas (#11)"],[1,"ighted, and the \"whole place shines like a  congregation of glowworms.\" There are the skaters still \"leaning against  the frosty wind\"; there is the \"gray church tower amid the leafless  elms,\" around which the echoes of the morning peal of Christmas bells  still hover; the village folk have gathered, \"in their best dresses and  their best faces\"; the beautiful service of the church has been read and  answered with heartfelt responses, the familiar story has been told  again simply and urgently, with applications for every thankful soul,  and then the congregation has gone to its homes and its festivities.    All these things, I am sure, lie within Rosalind's vision, although she  seems to see nothing but the ruddy blaze of the fire; all these things I  see, as I have seen them these many Christmas Eves agone; but with this  familiar landscape there are mingled all the sweet and sorrowful  memories of our common life, recalled at this hour that the light of the  highest truth may interpret them anew in the divine language of hope. I  read on until I come to the quotation from the \"Hymn to the Nativity,\"  and then I close the book, and take up a copy of Milton close at hand.  We have had our commemoration service of love, and now there comes into  our thought, with the organ roll of this sublime hymn, the universal  truth which lies at the heart of the season. I am hardly conscious that  it is my voice which makes these words audible: I am conscious only of  this mighty-voiced anthem, fit for the choral song of the morning stars:          \"Ring out, ye crystal spheres,        And bless our human ears,      If ye have power to touch our senses so;        And let your silver chime        Move in melodious time;      And let the bass of heaven's deep organ blow;      And, with your ninefold harmony,      Make up full concert to the angelic symphony.          \"For, if such holy song        Enwrap our fancy long,      Time will run back and fetch the age of gold;        And speckled vanity        Will sicken soon and die,      And leprous sin will melt from earthly mold;      And hell itself will pass away,      And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day.                       - - - - -          \"The oracles are dumb,        No voice or hideous hum      Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving;        Apollo from his shrine        Can no more divine      With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving,      No nightly trance or breathed spell      Inspires the pale-eyed priest from the prophetic cell.          \"The lonely mountains o'er,        And the resounding shore,      A voice of weeping heard and loud lament;        From haunted spring, and dale        Edged with poplars pale,      The parting genius is with sighing sent;      With flower-enwoven tresses torn,      The nymphs in twilight shades of tangled thickets mourn.\"                   - - - - -    Like a psalm the great Hymn fills the air, and like a psalm it remains  in the memory. The fire has burned low, and a soft and solemn light  fills the room. Neither of us speaks while the clock strikes twelve. I  look out of the window. The heavens are ablaze with light, and somewhere  amid those circling constellations I know that a new star has found its  place, and is shining with such a ray as never before fell from heaven  to earth.           *       *       *       *       *        CHRISTMAS IN THE OLDEN TIME        WALTER SCOTT        On Christmas-eve the bells were rung;      The damsel donned her kirtle sheen;      The hall was dressed with holly green;      Forth to the wood did merry men go,      To gather in the mistletoe.      Thus opened wide the baron's hall      To vassal, tenant, serf and all;      Power laid his rod of rule aside      And ceremony doffed his pride.      The heir, with roses in his shoes,      That night might village partner choose;      The lord, underogating, share      The vulgar game of \"Post and Pair.\"      All hailed, with uncontrolled delight,      And general voice, the happy night      That to the cottage, as the crown,      Brought tidings of salvation down.        The fire, with well-dried logs supplied,      Went roaring up the chimney wide;      The huge hall-table's oaken face,      Scrubbed till it shone, the day to grace,      Bore then upon its massive board      No mark to part the squire and lord.      Then was brought in the lusty brawn      By old blue-coated serving man;      Then the grim boar's head frowned on high,      Crested with bays and rosemary.      Well can the green-garbed ranger tell      How, when and where the monster fell;      What dogs before his death he tore,      And all the baitings of the boar.      The wassal round, in good brown bowls,      Garnished with ribbons, blithely trowls.      There the huge sirloin reeked: hard by      Plum-porridge stood, and Christmas pye;      Nor failed old Scotland to produce,      At such high-tide, her savory goose.        Then came the merry maskers in,      And carols roared with blithesome din.      If unmelodious was the song,      It was a hearty note, and strong;      Who lists may in their murmuring see      Traces of ancient mystery;      White shirts supplied the masquerade,      And smutted cheeks the visors made;      But O, what maskers richly dight,      Can boast of bosoms half so light!      England was \"merry England\" when      Old Christmas brought his sports again;      'Twas Christmas broached the mightiest ale,      'Twas Christmas told the merriest tale;      A Christmas gambol oft would cheer      The poor man's heart through half the year.           *       *       *       *       *        SLY SANTA CLAUS        MRS. C.S. STONE        All the house was asleep,        And the fire burning low,      When, from far up the chimney,        Came down a \"Ho! ho!\"      And a little, round man,        With a terrible scratching,      Dropped into the room        With a wink that was catching.      Yes, down he came, bumping,      And thumping, and jumping,        And picking himself up without sign             of a bruise!        \"Ho! ho!\" he kept on,      As if bursting with cheer.      \"Good children, gay children,        Glad children, see here!      I have brought you fine dolls,        And gay trumpets, and rings,      Noah's arks, and bright skates,        And a host of good things!      I have brought a whole sackful,      A packful, a hackful!        Come hither, come hither, come hither             and choose!        \"Ho! ho! What is this?        Why, they all are asleep!      But their stockings are up,        And my presents will keep!      So, in with the candies,        The books, and the toys;      All the goodies I have        For the good girls and boys.      I'll ram them, and jam them,      And slam them, and cram them;        All the stockings will hold while the            tired youngsters snooze.\"        All the while his round shoulders        Kept ducking and ducking;      And his little, fat fingers        Kept tucking and tucking;      Until every stocking        Bulged out, on the wall,      As if it were bursting,        And ready to fall.        And then, all at once,        With a whisk and a whistle,      And twisting himself        Like a tough bit of gristle,      He bounced up again,        Like the down of a thistle,          And nothing was left but the prints of his shoes.           *       *       *       *       *        THE WAITS        MARGARET DELAND        At the break of Christmas Day,        Through the frosty starlight ringing,      Faint and sweet and far away,        Comes the sound of children, singing,          Chanting, singing,            _\"Cease to mourn,            For Christ is born,        Peace and joy to all men bringing!\"_        Careless that the chill winds blow,        Growing stronger, sweeter, clearer,      Noiseless footfalls in the snow        Bring the happy voices nearer;          Hear them singing,            _\"Winter's drear,            But Christ is here,        Mirth and gladness with Him bringing!\"_        \"Merry Christmas!\" hear them say,        As the East is growing lighter;      \"May the joy of Christmas Day        Make your whole year gladder, brighter!\"          Join their singing,            _\"To each home            Our Christ has come,      All Love's treasures with Him bringing!\"_           *       *       *       *       *        THE KNIGHTING OF THE SIRLOIN OF BEEF BY CHARLES THE SECOND        ANON        The Second Charles of England        Rode forth one Christmas tide,      To hunt a gallant stag of ten,        Of Chingford woods the pride.        The winds blew keen, the snow fell fast,        And made for earth a pall,      As tired steeds and wearied men        Returned to Friday Hall.        The blazing logs, piled on the dogs,        Were pleasant to behold!      And grateful was the steaming feast        To hungry men and cold.        With right good-will all took their fill,        And soon each found relief;      Whilst Charles his royal trencher piled        From one huge loin of beef.        Quoth Charles, \"Odd's fish! a noble dish!        Ay, noble made by me!      By kingly right, I dub thee knight--        Sir Loin henceforward be!\"        And never was a royal jest        Received with such acclaim:      And never knight than good Sir Loin        More worthy of the name.           *       *       *       *       *    THE CHRISTMAS GOOSE AT THE CRATCHITS'    CHARLES DICKENS    You might have thought a goose the rarest of all birds; a feathered  phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of course; and in truth,  it was something like it in that house.
