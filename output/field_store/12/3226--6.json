[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18846"],[0,"Voodoo Planet (#11)"],[1,"the stunted, unnatural growth of the swamplands had given away to  the more normal vegetation of the jungle-clad lowlands. Had they come  clear across the swamp, Dane wondered dully, or was this only a large  island in the midst of the stinking boglands?    He drank again and regained strength enough to crawl to where his  shipmates lay. It was some time before he was interested in much besides  the fact that he could drink when he wished. Then he watched Jellico  waver to his feet, his head turned eastward. Tau, too, sat up as if  alerted by the _Queen's_ alarm buzzer.    The Khatkans were gone, perhaps back to the water tree. But all three of  the spacemen heard that sound, a far off throbbing rhythm which was a  vibration as well. Jellico looked to Tau.    \"Drums?\"    \"Could be.\" The medic screwed the cap back on his canteen. \"I'd say we  have company--only I'd like to know what kind!\"    They might have been mistaken about the drums, but none of them could  have been mistaken about the bolt which came out of nowhere to slice  through a tree trunk as a knife might slash wet clay. Blaster--and a  particular type of blaster!    \"Patrol issue!\" Tau lay flat, squeezing himself against the earth as if  he wished he could ooze into it.    Jellico wriggled toward the bush in answer to a low call from Asaki, and  the others made a worm's progress in his wake. Under cover they found  the Chief Ranger readying his needler.    \"Poacher camp here,\" he explained bleakly. \"And they know about us.\"    \"A perfect end to a stinking day,\" remarked Tau dispassionately. \"We  might have guessed something of this sort was waiting.\" He tried to rub  away some of the dried clay coating his chin. \"But do poachers use  drums?\"    The Chief Ranger scowled. \"That is what Nymani has gone to find out.\"          VII      Darkness closed in while they waited for Nymani's return. There had been  no further attack from the blaster wielder; perhaps he was only trying  to pin them down where they were. Out over the swamp, weird patches of  phosphorescence moved in small ghostly clouds, and bright dots of  insects with their own built-in lighting systems flashed spark-fashion  or sailed serenely on regular flight plans. At night the wonder of the  place was far removed from the squalid reality of the day. They chewed  on their rations, drank sparingly of the water, and tried to keep alert  to any sight or sound.    That monotonous undertone, which might or might not be drums, continued  as a basic hum to the noises of the night, drowned out at intervals by a  splash, a mutter or cry from some swamp creature. Beside Dane, Jellico  stiffened, moved his blaster, as someone wriggled through the brush,  trilling softly.    \"Off-worlders,\" Nymani reported in gasps to Asaki, \"and outlaws, too.  They make a hunting sing--tomorrow they march for a killing.\"    Asaki rested his chin on his broad forearm. \"Outlaws?\"    \"They show no lord's badge. But each I saw wears a bracelet of three,  five, or ten tails. They are Trackers indeed, and Hunters of the best!\"    \"They have huts?\"    \"Not so. There are no dwellers in the inners courts here.\" Out of habit  Nymani used the polite term for the women of his race. \"I would say they  tarry only for the space of a hunt. And on the boots of one I saw salt  crust.\"    \"Salt crust!\" Asaki snapped and half arose. \"So that is the type of lure  they use. There must be a saline mire near here to pull game--\"    \"How many off-worlders?\" Jellico broke in.    \"Three who are Hunters, one who is different.\"    \"How different?\" questioned Asaki.    \"He wears upon his body garments which are strange; on his head a round  covering such as we see upon the off-worlders of the ships--\"    \"A spaceman!\"    Asaki laughed harshly. \"Why not? They must have some method of  transporting their hides.\"    \"You can't tell me,\" Jellico returned, \"that anyone is able to set a  ship down in this muck. It would simply be buried for all time.\"    \"But, Captain, what type of a spaceport does a Free Trader need? Do you  not planet your own ship on worlds where there are no waiting cradles,  no fitter shops, none of the conveniences such as mark the field Combine  maintains on Xecho?\"    \"Of course I do. But one does need a reasonably smooth stretch of  territory, open enough so the tail flames won't start a forest fire. You  don't ever ride a tail push down in a swamp!\"    \"Which testifies to a trail out of here, fairly well-traveled, and some  kind of a usable landing space not too far away,\" Asaki replied. \"And  that could very well serve us.\"    \"But they know we are here,\" Tau pointed out.    It was Nymani's turn to laugh. \"Man from the stars, there is no trail so  well-hidden that a Ranger of the preserves cannot nose it out, nor any  Hunter--be he a two or five bracelet veteran--who can keep pinned down a  determined man of the forest service!\"    Dane lost interest in the argument at that moment. He was at the edge of  their line, the nearest to the swamp, and he had been watching patches  of ghostly light flitting above the rank water-weeds. For the past few  moments those wisps of faded radiance had been gathering into a growing  anthropomorphic blot hanging over the morass several yards away. And the  misty outlines were now assuming more concrete shape. He watched,  unable to believe in what he was seeing. At first the general outline,  non-defined as it was, made him think of a rock ape. But there were no  pointed ears above the round skull, no snout on the visage turned in  profile toward him.    More and more patches of swamp luminescence were drawn to that glowing  figure. What balanced there now, as if walking the treacherous surface  of the swampland, was no animal. It was a man, or the semblance of one,  a small, thin man--a man he had seen once before, on the terrace of  Asaki's mountain fortress.    The thing stood almost complete, its head cocked in what was an attitude  of listening.    \"Lumbrilo!\" Dane identified it, still knowing that the witch doctor  could not be standing there listening for them. But, to shake him still  farther, the head turned at his cry. Only there were no eyes, no  features on the white expanse which should have been a face. And somehow  that made the monster more menacing, convincing Dane against sane logic  that the thing _was_ spying on them.    \"Demon!\" That was Nymani; and over his sudden quaver, robbed of all the  confidence which had been there only moments earlier, came Asaki's  demand:    \"What stands there, Medic? Tell us that!\"    \"A whip to drive us out of hiding, sir. As you know as well as I. If  Nymani spied upon them, then they have spied upon us in turn. And this,  I think, also answers another question. If there is a canker of trouble  on Khatka, then Lumbrilo is close to its root.\"    \"Nymani!\" The Chief Ranger's voice was the crack of a lash. \"Will you  forget again that you are a man, and run crying for shelter against a  shaft of light? As this off-world Medic says, Lumbrilo fashions such as  that to drive us into our enemies' hands!\"    The shadow thing in the swamp moved, putting its foot forward on surface  which would not bear the weight of a human body, taking a deliberate  step and then another, heading for the concealing brush where the  fugitives lay.    \"Can you get rid of it, Tau?\" Jellico asked in his usual crisp voice. He  might have been inquiring about some problem aboard the _Queen_.    \"I'd rather get at the source.\" There was a grim note in the Medic's  reply. \"And to do that I want to look at their camp.\"    \"Well enough!\" Asaki crept back in the brush.    The ghost of that which was not a man had reached the shore of the  island, stood there, its blank head turned toward them. Weird as it was,  now that the first shock of sighting it was over, the spacemen could  accept and dismiss it as they had not been so able to dismiss the  phantom rock ape.    \"If that thing was sent to drive us,\" Dane ventured, \"wouldn't we be  playing their game by going inland now?\"    The Chief Ranger did not pause in his crawl to the left. \"I think not.  They do not expect us to arrive with our wits about us. Panic-stricken  men are easy to pull down. This time Lumbrilo has overreached himself.  Had he not played that game with the rock ape, he might have been able  to stampede us now.\"    Though the white thing continued to move inland, it did not change  course to fall in behind them on the new route. Whatever it was, it did  not possess a mind.    There was a rustling, faint but distinguishable. Then Dane caught  Nymani's whisper.    \"The one left to watch the inland trail does so no longer. We need not  fear an alarm from _him_. Also, here is another blaster for our use.\"    Away from the open by the swamp, the gloom was deeper. Dane was guided  only by the noises of the less-experienced Jellico and Tau made in their  progress.    They edged down into a small cut, floored with reeds and mud, where some  of the moisture from the soggy land about them gathered into a half  pool. Straight through this swale the Khatkans set course.    The drum beat grew louder. Now there was a glow against the dark--fire  ahead? Dane squirmed forward and at last gained a vantage point from  which to survey the poachers' camp.    There were shelters erected there, three of them, but they were mainly  roofs of leaves and branches. In two of them were stored bales of hides  sewn into plastic cloth, ready to ship. Before the third hut lounged  four off-worlders. And Nymani was very right; one of them wore ship's  uniform.    To the right of the fire was a ring of natives and another man, slightly  apart, who beat the drum. But of the witch doctor there was no sign. And  Dane, thinking of that mist-born thing at the swamp's edge, shivered. He  could believe Tau's explanation of the drug which produced  hallucinations back on the mountain side.

I cannot put my hand on the menu of any of the many  breakfasts I have eaten at Ciro's, so I borrow a typical menu from  V.B's. interesting little book _Ten Days at Monte Carlo_. He and three  friends ate and drank this at _dejeuner_:--               Hors-d'oeuvre varies.            Oeufs poches Grand Duc.             Mostelle a l'Anglaise.      Volaille en Casserole a la Fermiere.                  Patisserie.                    Fromage.                     Cafe.           1 Magnum Carbonnieux 1891.              Fine Champagne 1846.    This feast cost 61 francs. The Mostelle, as I have previously mentioned,  is the special fish of this part of the coast. It is as delicate as a  whiting, and is split open, fried, and served with bread crumbs and an  over-sufficiency of melted butter.    At Monte Carlo one is given everything that can be imported and which is  expensive. The salmon comes from Scotland or Sweden, and most of the  other material for the feasts is sent down daily from Paris. The  thrushes from Corsica, and some very good asparagus from Genoa or  Rocbrune, are about the only provisions which come from the  neighbourhood, except of course the fish, which is plentiful and  excellent. I was last spring entrusted with the ordering of a dinner for  six at the restaurant of the Hotel de Paris, the most frequented of all  the dining places at Monte Carlo, and I told Mons. Fleury, the manager,  that I wanted as much local colour introduced into it as possible. He  referred me to the _chef_, and between us we drew up this menu, which  certainly has something of the sunny south about it:--          Hors-d'oeuvre et Caviar frais.            Creme de Langoustines.             Friture de Nonnats.         Selle d'Agneau aux Primeurs.              Becassines roties.               Salade Nicoise.              Asperges de Genes.              Sauce Mousseline.                   Dessert.                       VINS.                 1 bottle Barsac.      3 bottles Pommery Vin Nature 1892.    To crown this feast we had some of the very old brandy, a treasure of  the house, which added 60 francs to the bill. The total was 363 francs  10 centimes.    In this dinner the _Creme de Langoustines_ was excellent, a most  delightful _bisque_. The _nonnats_ are the small fry of the bay, smaller  far than whitebait, and are delicious to eat. They are perhaps more  suitable for breakfast than for a dinner of ceremony, and had I not  yearned for local colour I should have ordered the _Filets de Sole  Egyptiennes_ in little paper coffins which look like mummy cases, a dish  which is one of the specialities of the house.    Dining at the Hotel de Paris one pays in comfort for its popularity, for  on a crowded night the tables in the big dining-room are put so close  together that there is hardly room for the waiters to move between them,  and the noise of the conversation rises to a roar through which the  violins of the band outside the door can barely be heard. Bachelier, the  _maitre-d'hotel_ at the Francais, a disciple of Francois, is quite one  of the foremost men of his calling.    The restaurant of the Grand Hotel, where MM. Noel and Pattard themselves  see to the comfort of their guests, is also a fashionable dining place.  I first tasted the _Sole Waleska_, with its delicate flavouring of  Parmesan, at the Grand Hotel many years ago, and it has always been one  of the special dishes of the house. _Poularde a la Santos Dumont_ is  another speciality. This is a menu of a dinner for six given at the  Grand, as a return for the one quoted above as a product of the Hotel de  Paris:--          Creme Livonienne.     Filets de Sole Waleska.  Baron de Pauillac a la Broche.      Puree de Champignons.      Petits Pois Nouveaux.         Merles de Corse.             Salade.   Asperges. Sauce Mousseline.       Souffle du Parmesan.           Friandises.    The Hermitage, in which MM. Benoit and Fourault are interested, shares  the rush of fashionable diners with Ciro and the Paris and Grand, but I  cannot speak by personal knowledge of its dinners.    There are other restaurants not so expensive as the ones I have written  of, and further up the hill, which can give one a most admirable dinner.  The Helder is one of the restaurants where the men who have to live all  their life at Monte Carlo often breakfast and dine, and Aubanel's  Restaurant, the Princess', which one of the great stars of the Opera has  very regularly patronised, deserves a special good word. The Restaurant  Re, which was originally a fish and oyster shop, but which is now a  restaurant with fish as its speciality, is also an excellent place for  men of moderate means. Madame Re learned the art of the kitchen at the  Reserve at Marseilles, and she knows as much about the cooking of fish  as any woman in the world. When it came to my turn in the interchange  of dinners for six to provide a feast, I went to Madame Re and asked her  to give me a fish dinner, and to keep it as distinctive as possible of  the principality, and she at once saw what I wanted and entered into the  spirit of it. She met me on the evening of the feast with a sorrowful  expression on her handsome face, for she had sent a fisherman out very  early in the morning into the bay to catch some of the little sea  hedgehogs which were to form one course, but he had come back  empty-handed. The menu stood as under, and we none of us missed the  hedgehogs:--             Canape de Nonnats.      Soupe de poisson Monegasque.          Supions en Buisson.          Dorade Bonne Femme.            Volaille Rotie.         Langouste Parisienne.         Asperges Vinaigrette.                Dessert.    The _Soupe Monegasque_ had a reminiscence in it of _Bouillabaisse_, but  it was not too insistent; the _supions_ were octopi, but delicate little  gelatinous fellows, not leathery, as the Italian ones sometimes are; the  _dorade_ was a splendid fish, and though I fancy the _langouste_ had  come from northern waters and not from the bay, it was beautifully fresh  and a monster of its kind.    The Riviera Palace has a restaurant to which many people come to  breakfast, high above Monte Carlo and its heat, and the cook is a very  good one.    Any mad Englishman who like myself takes long walks in the morning, will  find the restaurant at the La Turbie terminus of the mountain railway a  pleasant place at which to eat early breakfast; and the view from the  terrace, where one munches one's _petit pain_ and drinks one's coffee  and milk, with an orange tree on either side of the table, is a superb  one.    After the tables are closed the big room at the Cafe de Paris in Monte  Carlo fills up with those who require supper or a \"night cap\" before  going home; and though a sprinkling of ladies may be seen there, the  half-world much preponderates. The night-birds finish the evening at the  Festa, some distance up the hill, where two bands play, and there is  some dancing, and where the lights are not put out until the small hours  are growing into big ones.      Mentone    Mentone has a splendid tea-shop at Rumpelmayer's, and a pleasant  restaurant at which to lunch is that of the Winter Palace. Many people  drive from Monte Carlo to lunch or take tea at the Cap Martin Hotel, and  it is a pleasant place with a splendid view from the great terrace,  though sometimes people not staying in the hotel complain of the  slowness of the attendance there.      The Pyrenees    As a gastronomic guide to the Pyrenees I cannot do better than introduce  to you my very good friend C.P., who knows that part of the world as  well as any native, and whose taste is unimpeachable. I therefore stand  down and let him speak for himself:--    Throughout the Pyrenees, in nine hotels out of ten, you can obtain a  decently cooked luncheon or dinner--neither above nor below the average.    But in order to depart from the beaten track of the ordinary menu,  abandon all hypocrisy, oh, intelligent traveller! and do not pretend  that you can turn a fastidious nose away from the seductions of the  burnt onion and the garlic clove, the foundations upon which rests the  whole edifice of Pyrenean cooking. Pharisaical density would be only  wasting time, for these two vegetables will be your constant companions  so soon as you decide to sample the _cuisine bourgeoise_ of the country.  You should on no account fail to venture on this voyage of exploration,  as some of the dishes are excellent, all of them interesting, and, once  tasted, never to be forgotten.    To attempt to enumerate them all, to describe them minutely, or to give  any account of their preparation, hardly comes within the scope of these  notes. Suffice it to give the names of two or three.    First comes the _Garbure_, a kind of thick vegetable soup containing  Heaven knows what ingredients, but all the same sure to please you. Next  comes the _Confit d'Oie_, a sort of goose stew, utterly unlike anything  you have tasted before, but not without its merits. Next, the  _Cotelettes d'Izard marine_ may interest you. The izard, or chamois of  the Pyrenees, has been _marine_ or soaked for some time in wine,  vinegar, bay leaves, and other herbs. It thus acquires a distinctive and  novel flavour. Don't forget the _Ragout_ and the _Poulet_, either  _chasseur_ or else _paysanne_; nor yet the _Pie de Mars_ if in season.  By way of fish you will always find the trout delicious, either fried or  else _a la meuniere_. (Don't miss the _alose_ if you are at Pau.)  Lastly, the Pyrenean _pates, Gibier_ and _Foie de Canard_, are justly  celebrated, and can more than hold their own in friendly and patriotic  rivalry with any of those purporting to come from"]]]
