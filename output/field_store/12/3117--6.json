The Indians had names for all the prominent features of the  Yosemite Valley, and these have been variously translated  (sometimes with considerable poetic license), and variously  spelled. The translations given below are as literal as possible,  without embellishment, and are believed to be fairly accurate.  The spelling adopted is such as best indicates the pronunciation.    The English names, by which the falls and peaks are commonly  known, bear no relation to the Indian names, but were bestowed by  the soldiers of the Mariposa Battalion at the time the Valley  was discovered. The appropriateness and good taste of most of  them are due to Dr. L.H. Bunnell, the surgeon of the expedition.

YO-WEI'-YEE (Nevada)--\"Twisting.\"    TO-TAU-KON-NU'-LA (El Capitan)--Named from the To-tau'-kons,  or cranes, which used to make their nests in a meadow near the  top of this rock.    KU-SO'-KO (Cathedral Rock)--Interpretation doubtful.    PU-SEE'-NA CHUCK'-AH (Cathedral Spires)--\"Pu-see-na\" means  mouse or rat, and might possibly be applied to a squirrel.  \"Chuck-ah\" is a store house or _cache_.

Now this, Socrates, is the reverse  of what was just now said; for upon this view the wise man should sorrow  and the fool rejoice at passing out of life.    The earnestness of Cebes seemed to please Socrates. Here, said he,  turning to us, is a man who is always inquiring, and is not so easily  convinced by the first thing which he hears.    And certainly, added Simmias, the objection which he is now making does  appear to me to have some force. For what can be the meaning of a truly  wise man wanting to fly away and lightly leave a master who is better  than himself? And I rather imagine that Cebes is referring to you; he  thinks that you are too ready to leave us, and too ready to leave the  gods whom you acknowledge to be our good masters.    Yes, replied Socrates; there is reason in what you say. And so you think  that I ought to answer your indictment as if I were in a court?    We should like you to do so, said Simmias.    Then I must try to make a more successful defence before you than I  did when before the judges. For I am quite ready to admit, Simmias and  Cebes, that I ought to be grieved at death, if I were not persuaded in  the first place that I am going to other gods who are wise and good (of  which I am as certain as I can be of any such matters), and secondly  (though I am not so sure of this last) to men departed, better than  those whom I leave behind; and therefore I do not grieve as I might have  done, for I have good hope that there is yet something remaining for the  dead, and as has been said of old, some far better thing for the good  than for the evil.    But do you mean to take away your thoughts with you, Socrates? said  Simmias. Will you not impart them to us?--for they are a benefit  in which we too are entitled to share. Moreover, if you succeed in  convincing us, that will be an answer to the charge against yourself.    I will do my best, replied Socrates. But you must first let me hear what  Crito wants; he has long been wishing to say something to me.    Only this, Socrates, replied Crito:--the attendant who is to give you  the poison has been telling me, and he wants me to tell you, that you  are not to talk much, talking, he says, increases heat, and this is  apt to interfere with the action of the poison; persons who excite  themselves are sometimes obliged to take a second or even a third dose.    Then, said Socrates, let him mind his business and be prepared to give  the poison twice or even thrice if necessary; that is all.    I knew quite well what you would say, replied Crito; but I was obliged  to satisfy him.    Never mind him, he said.    And now, O my judges, I desire to prove to you that the real philosopher  has reason to be of good cheer when he is about to die, and that after  death he may hope to obtain the greatest good in the other world. And  how this may be, Simmias and Cebes, I will endeavour to explain. For I  deem that the true votary of philosophy is likely to be misunderstood  by other men; they do not perceive that he is always pursuing death and  dying; and if this be so, and he has had the desire of death all his  life long, why when his time comes should he repine at that which he has  been always pursuing and desiring?    Simmias said laughingly: Though not in a laughing humour, you have made  me laugh, Socrates; for I cannot help thinking that the many when they  hear your words will say how truly you have described philosophers, and  our people at home will likewise say that the life which philosophers  desire is in reality death, and that they have found them out to be  deserving of the death which they desire.    And they are right, Simmias, in thinking so, with the exception of the  words 'they have found them out'; for they have not found out either  what is the nature of that death which the true philosopher deserves,  or how he deserves or desires death. But enough of them:--let us discuss  the matter among ourselves: Do we believe that there is such a thing as  death?    To be sure, replied Simmias.    Is it not the separation of soul and body? And to be dead is the  completion of this; when the soul exists in herself, and is released  from the body and the body is released from the soul, what is this but  death?    Just so, he replied.    There is another question, which will probably throw light on our  present inquiry if you and I can agree about it:--Ought the philosopher  to care about the pleasures--if they are to be called pleasures--of  eating and drinking?    Certainly not, answered Simmias.    And what about the pleasures of love--should he care for them?    By no means.    And will he think much of the other ways of indulging the body, for  example, the acquisition of costly raiment, or sandals, or other  adornments of the body? Instead of caring about them, does he not rather  despise anything more than nature needs? What do you say?    I should say that the true philosopher would despise them.    Would you not say that he is entirely concerned with the soul and not  with the body? He would like, as far as he can, to get away from the  body and to turn to the soul.    Quite true.    In matters of this sort philosophers, above all other men, may be  observed in every sort of way to dissever the soul from the communion of  the body.    Very true.    Whereas, Simmias, the rest of the world are of opinion that to him who  has no sense of pleasure and no part in bodily pleasure, life is not  worth having; and that he who is indifferent about them is as good as  dead.    That is also true.    What again shall we say of the actual acquirement of knowledge?--is the  body, if invited to share in the enquiry, a hinderer or a helper? I mean  to say, have sight and hearing any truth in them? Are they not, as the  poets are always telling us, inaccurate witnesses? and yet, if even  they are inaccurate and indistinct, what is to be said of the other  senses?--for you will allow that they are the best of them?    Certainly, he replied.    Then when does the soul attain truth?--for in attempting to consider  anything in company with the body she is obviously deceived.    True.    Then must not true existence be revealed to her in thought, if at all?    Yes.    And thought is best when the mind is gathered into herself and none of  these things trouble her--neither sounds nor sights nor pain nor any  pleasure,--when she takes leave of the body, and has as little as  possible to do with it, when she has no bodily sense or desire, but is  aspiring after true being?    Certainly.    And in this the philosopher dishonours the body; his soul runs away from  his body and desires to be alone and by herself?    That is true.    Well, but there is another thing, Simmias: Is there or is there not an  absolute justice?    Assuredly there is.    And an absolute beauty and absolute good?    Of course.    But did you ever behold any of them with your eyes?    Certainly not.    Or did you ever reach them with any other bodily sense?--and I speak not  of these alone, but of absolute greatness, and health, and strength,  and of the essence or true nature of everything. Has the reality of them  ever been perceived by you through the bodily organs? or rather, is not  the nearest approach to the knowledge of their several natures made  by him who so orders his intellectual vision as to have the most exact  conception of the essence of each thing which he considers?    Certainly.    And he attains to the purest knowledge of them who goes to each with the  mind alone, not introducing or intruding in the act of thought sight  or any other sense together with reason, but with the very light of the  mind in her own clearness searches into the very truth of each; he who  has got rid, as far as he can, of eyes and ears and, so to speak, of the  whole body, these being in his opinion distracting elements which when  they infect the soul hinder her from acquiring truth and knowledge--who,  if not he, is likely to attain the knowledge of true being?    What you say has a wonderful truth in it, Socrates, replied Simmias.    And when real philosophers consider all these things, will they not be  led to make a reflection which they will express in words something like  the following? 'Have we not found,' they will say, 'a path of thought  which seems to bring us and our argument to the conclusion, that while  we are in the body, and while the soul is infected with the evils of the  body, our desire will not be satisfied? and our desire is of the truth.  For the body is a source of endless trouble to us by reason of the mere  requirement of food; and is liable also to diseases which overtake and  impede us in the search after true being: it fills us full of loves, and  lusts, and fears, and fancies of all kinds, and endless foolery, and  in fact, as men say, takes away from us the power of thinking at all.  Whence come wars, and fightings, and factions? whence but from the body  and the lusts of the body? wars are occasioned by the love of money, and  money has to be acquired for the sake and in the service of the body;  and by reason of all these impediments we have no time to give to  philosophy; and, last and worst of all, even if we are at leisure and  betake ourselves to some speculation, the body is always breaking in  upon us, causing turmoil and confusion in our enquiries, and so amazing  us that we are prevented from seeing the truth. It has been proved to us  by experience that if we would have pure knowledge of anything we  must be quit of the body--the soul in herself must behold things in  themselves: and then we shall attain the wisdom which we desire, and of  which we say that we are lovers, not while we live, but after death; for  if while in company with the body, the soul cannot have pure knowledge,  one of two things follows--either knowledge is not to be attained at  all, or, if at all, after death. For then, and"]]]
