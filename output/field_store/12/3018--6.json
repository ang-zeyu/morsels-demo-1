They were afterwards bought by Allan Cunningham,  who gave them back to Burns' widow.--Birmingham lent its rill to the  great river of homage to the genius of Burns which flowed through the  length and breadth of the civilised world on the occasion of the Burns'  centenary in January, 1859. The most interesting of the three or four  meetings held here was one of a semi-private nature, which took place at  Aston Hall, and which originated, not with Scotchmen, but with  Englishmen. Some forty-five or fifty gentlemen, only some half-dozen of  whom were Scotch, sat down to an excellent supper in the fine old room  in which the Queen lunched the previous year. The chairman was Mr.  Samuel Timmins, and the vice-chairman was Mr. Ross.    ~Cabs, Cars, and Carriages.~--The hackney carriages, or four-wheelers,  of this town, have the credit of being superior to those used in London,  though the hansoms (notwithstanding their being the inventions of one  who should rank almost as a local worthy--the architect of our Town  Hall) are not up to the mark. Prior to 1820 there were no regular stands  for vehicles plying for hire, those in New Street, Bull Street, and  Colmore Row being laid in that year, the first cabman's license being  dated June 11. The first \"Cabman's Rest\" was opened in Ratcliffe Place,  June 13, 1872, the cost (L65) being gathered by the cabman's friend, the  Rev. Micarah Hill, who also, in 1875, helped them to start an  association for mutual assistance in cases of sickness or death. There  are sixteen of these \"shelters\" in the town, the cabmen subscribing  about L200 yearly towards expenses. As a rule, the Birmingham cabmen are  a civil and obliging body of men, though now and then a little sharp  practice may occur, as in the instance of the stranger who, arriving in  New Street Station one evening last summer, desired to be taken to the  Queen's Hotel. His luggage being properly secured, and himself safely  ensconced, Mr. Cabby cooly took the rug from his horse's back, mounted  his seat and walked the animal through the gates back to the building  the stranger had just left, depositing his fare, and as calmly holding  out his hand for the customary shilling as if he had driven the full  distance of a mile and a half. The fares laid down by the bye-laws as  proper to be charged within the Borough, and within five miles from the  statue in Stephenson Place, in the Borough, are as follows:--      _By time_, the driver driving at a rate not less than five miles per  hour, if so required:--                                               s. d.    For every carriage constructed to     carry four persons, for the first     hour, or part of hour  ..   ..          3  0    For every additional 15 minutes, or     part of 15 minutes.    ..   ..          0  2    For every carriage constructed to     carry two persons, for the first     hour, or part of hour  ..   ..          2  6    For every additional 15 minutes, or     part of 15 minutes..   ..   ..          0  6    Any person hiring any carriage     otherwise than by time is entitled     to detain the same five minutes     without extra charge, but for     every 15 minutes, or part thereof,     over the first five minutes, the     hirer must pay    ..   ..   ..          0  6    _By distance_:--    Cabs or Cars to carry 2 persons not     exceeding 1-1/2 miles  ..   ..          1  0    Per 1/2 mile after ..   ..   ..          0  4    One horse vehicles to carry 4     persons, not exceeding 1 mile ..        1  0    For any further distance, per 1/2 mile     after ..  ..  ..  ..   ..   ..          0  6    Cars or Carriages with 2 horses, to     carry 4 persons, not exceeding 1     mile  ..  ..  ..  ..   ..   ..          1  9    Per 1/2 mile after ..   ..   ..          0  9    _Double Fares_ shall be allowed and     paid for every fare, or so much of     any fare as may be performed by     any carriage after 12 o'clock at     night, and before 6 in the morning.      ~Calthorpe Park,~ Pershore road, has an area of 3la. 1r. 13p., and was  given to the town in 1857 by Lord Calthorpe. Though never legally  conveyed to the Corporation, the Park is held under a grant from the  Calthorpe family, the effect of which is equivalent to a conveyance in  fee. The Duke of Cambridge performed the opening ceremony in this our  first public park.    ~Calthorpe Road~ was laid out for building in the year 1818, and the  fact is worthy of note as being the commencement of our local West End.    ~Calico, Cotton, and Cloth.~--In 1702 the printing or wearing of printed  calicoes was prohibited, and more strictly so in 1721, when cloth  buttons and buttonholes were also forbidden. Fifty years after, the  requisites for manufacturing cotton or cotton cloth were now allowed to  be exported, and in 1785 a duty was imposed on all cotton goods brought  into the Kingdom. Strange as it may now appear, there was once a  \"cotton-spinning mill\" in Birmingham. The first thread of cotton ever  spun by rollers was produced in a small house near Sutton Coldfield as  early as the year 1700, and in 1741 the inventor, John Wyatt, had a mill  in the Upper Priory, where his machine, containing fifty rollers, was  turned by two donkeys walking round an axis, like a horse in a modern  clay mill. The manufacture, however, did not succeed in this town,  though carried on more or less till the close of the century, Paul's  machine being advertised for sale April 29, 1795. The Friends'  schoolroom now covers the site of the cotton mill.    ~Canals.~--The first Act for the construction of the \"cut\" or canal in  connection with Birmingham was passed in 1761, that to Bilston being  commenced in 1767. The delivery here of the first boat-load of coals  (Nov. 6, 1769) was hailed, and rightly so, as one of the greatest  blessings that could be conferred on the town, the immediate effect  being a reduction in the price to 6d per cwt, which in the following May  came down to 4d. The cutting of the first sod towards making the Grand  Junction Canal took place July 26, 1766, and it was completed in 1790.  In 1768 Briudley, the celebrated engineer, planned out the Birmingham  and Wolverhampton Canal, proposing to make it 22 miles long; but he did  not live to see it finished. The work was taken up by Smeaton and  Telford; the latter of whom calling it \"a crooked ditch\" struck out a  straight cut, reducing the length to 14 miles, increasing the width to  40 feet, the bridges having each a span of 52 feet. The \"Summit\" bridge  was finished in 1879. The Fazeley Canal was completed in 1783, and so  successfully was it worked that in nine years the shares were at a  premium of L1170. In 1785 the Birmingham, the Fazeley, and the Grand  Junction Companies took up and completed an extension to Coventry. The  Birmingham and Worcester Canal was commenced in 1,791, the cost being a  little over L600,000, and it was opened for through traffic July 21,  1815. By an agreement of September 18, 1873, this canal was sold to the  Gloucester and Berkeley Canal Co. (otherwise the Sharpness Dock Co.),  and has thus lost its distinctive local name. The Birmingham and Warwick  commenced in 1793; was finished in 1800. Communication with Liverpool by  water was complete in 1826, the carriage of goods thereto which had  previously cost L5 per ton, being reduced to 30s. For a through cut to  London, a company was started in May, 1836, with a nominal capital of  L3,000,000, in L100 shares, and the first cargoes were despatched in  August, 1840. In April, 1840, an Act was passed to unite the Wyrley and  Essington Canal Co. with the Birmingham Canal Co., leading to the  extension, at a cost of over L120,000, of the canal system to the lower  side of the town. There are 2,800 miles of canals in England, and about  300 miles in Ireland. The total length of what may properly be called  Birmingham canals is about 130 miles, but if the branches in the \"Black  Country\" be added thereto, it will reach to near 250 miles. The first  iron boat made its appearance on canal waters July 24, 1787; the first  propelled by steam arrived here from London, September 29, 1826. The  adaptation of steam power to general canal traffic, however, was not  carried to any great extent, on account of the injury caused to the  banks by the \"wash\" from the paddles and screws, though, when railways  were first talked about, the possibility of an inland steam navigation  was much canvassed. When the Bill for the London and Birmingham Railway  was before Parliament, in 1833, some enterprising carriers started (on  Midsummer-day) an opposition in the shape of a stage-boat, to run daily  and do the distance, with goods and passengers, in 16 hours. The  Birmingham and Liverpool Canal Company introduced steam tugs in 1843. On  Saturday, November 11, they despatched 16 boats, with an aggregate load  of 380 tons, to Liverpool, drawn by one small vessel of 16-horse power,  other engines taking up the \"train\" at different parts of the voyage.  Mr. Inshaw, in 1853, built a steamboat for canals with a screw on each  side of the rudder. It was made to draw four boats with 40 tons of coal  in each at two and a half miles per hour, and the twin screws were to  negative the surge, but the iron horses of the rail soon put down, not  only all such weak attempts at competition, but almost the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14473"],[0,"Birds of Guernsey (1879) (#11)"],[1,"g.  I could not, however, quite make out what she fed them with, but I think  with insects caught amongst the seaweed and tangle amongst the rocks.  After the young were flown I took this nest, and was astonished to find,  when it was taken out of the crevice, how much material had been used in  wedging it in, and how firmly it was attached to the rock. This was  certainly necessary to keep it in its place in some of the heavy gales  that sometimes happen even at that time of year; in a very heavy  north-westerly gale it would hardly have been clear of the wash of the  waves at high water.    The Wren is included in Professor Ansted's list, but marked as only  occurring in Guernsey. There is no specimen in the Museum.      46. TREE-CREEPER. _Certhia familiaris_, Linnaeus. French, \"Grimpereau,\"  \"Grimpereau familier.\"--The Tree-creeper is resident and not uncommon in  all the Islands, except perhaps Alderney, in which Island I have never  seen it. In Guernsey it may be seen in most of the wooded parts, and  frequently near the town, in the trees on the lawns at Candie, Castle  Carey, and in the New Ground. I have never seen it take to the rocks  near the sea, like the Wren.    It is mentioned in Professor Ansted's list, and marked as occurring in  Guernsey and Sark. There is no specimen in the Museum.      47. GREAT TIT. _Parus major_, Linnaeus. French, \"Mesange  Charbonniere.\"--The Paridae are by no means well represented in the  Islands, either individually or as to number of species; and the  Guernsey gardeners can have very little cause to grumble at damage done  to the buds by the Tits. The Great Tit is moderately common and resident  in Guernsey, but by no means so common as in England. During the whole  two months I was in the Island this last summer, 1878, I only saw two  or three Great Tits, and this quite agrees with my experience in June  and July, 1866, and at other times.    The Great Tit is included in Professor Ansted's list, but only marked by  him as occurring in Sark.      48. BLUE TIT. _Parus caeruleus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Mesange  bleue.\"--Like the Great Tit, the Blue Tit is resident in all the  Islands, but by no means numerous. In Guernsey it is pretty generally  distributed over the more cultivated parts, but nowhere so numerous as  in England. It is included in Professor Ansted's list, and marked as  occurring in Guernsey and Sark.    I have not included either the Cole Tit or the Marsh Tit in this list,  as I have never seen either bird in the Islands, and have not been able  to find that they are at all known either in Guernsey or any of the  other Islands.    Professor Ansted, however, includes the Cole Tit in his list, and marks  it as occurring in Guernsey, but no other information whatever is given  about it; and there is no specimen in the Museum, as there is of both  the Great and the Blue Tits. I have not succeeded in getting a specimen  myself.      49. LONG-TAILED TIT. _Acredula caudata_, Linnaeus. French, \"Masange a  longue queue.\"[10]--The Long-tailed Tit is certainly far from common in  Guernsey at present, and I have never seen it in the Islands myself. But  Mr. MacCulloch writes me word--\"The Long-tailed Tit is, or at least was,  far from uncommon. Probably the destruction of orchards may have  rendered it less common. The nest was generally placed in the forked  branch of an apple-tree, and so covered with grey lichens as to be  almost indistinguishable. I remember, in my youth, finding a nest in a  juniper-bush.\"    It is included in Professor Ansted's list, and marked as occurring in  Guernsey and Sark. There is, however, no specimen now in the Museum.    I am very doubtful as to whether I ought to include the Bearded Tit,  _Panurus biarmicus_ of Linnaeus, in this list. There are a pair in the  Museum, but these may have been obtained in France or England. One of  Mr. De Putron's men, however, described a bird he had shot in the reeds  in Mr. De Putron's pond in the Vale, and certainly his description  sounded very much as if it had been a Bearded Tit; but the bird had been  thrown away directly after it was shot, and there was no chance of  verifying the description.      50. WAXWING. _Ampelis garrulus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Jaseur de Boheme,\"  \"Grand Jaseur.\"--As would seem probable from its occasional appearance  in nearly every county in England, the Waxwing does occasionally make  its appearance in Guernsey as a straggler. I have never seen it myself,  but Mr. MacCulloch writes me word--\"I have known the Bohemian Waxwing  killed here on several occasions, but have not the date.\"    An interesting account of the nesting habits of this bird, and the  discovery of the nests and eggs by Mr. Wolley, was published by  Professor Newton in the 'Ibis' for 1861, and will be found also in  Dresser's 'Birds of Europe.' and in the new edition of 'Yarrell,' by  Professor Newton.    It is included in Professor Ansted's list, and marked as occurring in  Guernsey; and there is one specimen in the Museum.      51. PIED WAGTAIL. _Motacilla lugubris_, Temminck. French, \"Bergeronette  Yarrellii.\"[11]--The Pied Wagtail has probably been better known to  some of my readers as _Motacilla Yarrellii_, but, according to the  rules of nomenclature before alluded to, _Motacilla lugubris_ of  Temminck seems to have superseded the probably better-known name of  _Motacilla Yarrellii_.    For some reason or other the Pied Wagtail has grown much more scarce in  Guernsey than it used to be; at one time it was common even about the  town, running about by the gutters in the street, and several were  generally to be seen on the lawn at Candie. But this last summer--that  of 1878--I did not see one about Candie, or indeed anywhere else, except  one pair which were breeding near the Vale Church; and when there in  November, 1875, I only saw one, and that was near Vazon Bay. Mr.  MacCulloch has also noticed this growing scarcity of the Pied Wagtail,  as he writes to me--\"Of late years, for some reason or other, Wagtails  of all sorts have become rare.\" In the summer of 1866, however, I found  the Pied Wagtail tolerably common.    It is included in Professor Ansted's list, and marked as occurring in  Guernsey and Sark.      52. WHITE WAGTAIL. _Motacilla alba_, Linnaeus. French, \"Lavendiere,\"  \"Hoche-queue grise,\" \"Bergeronette grise.\"--The White Wagtail is still  scarcer than the Pied, but I saw one pair evidently breeding between  L'ancresse Road and Grand Havre. The White Wagtail so much resembles  the Pied Wagtail, that it may have been easily overlooked, and may be  more common than is generally known.    The fully adult birds may easily be distinguished, especially when in  full breeding plumage, as the back of the Pied Wagtail is black, while  that of the White Wagtail is grey. After the autumnal moult, however,  the distinction is not quite so easy, as the feathers of the Pied  Wagtail are then margined with grey, which rather conceals the colour  beneath; but if the feathers are lifted up they will be found to be  black under the grey margins. The young birds of the year, in their  first feathers, cannot be distinguished, and the same may be said of the  eggs.    The White Wagtail is included in Professor Ansted's list, but marked as  only occurring in Guernsey. There is no specimen either of the Pied or  White Wagtail in the Museum.      53. GREY WAGTAIL. _Motacilla melanope_, Pallas. French, \"Bergeronette  jaune.\"--The Grey Wagtail is by no means common in the Islands, though  it may occasionally remain to breed, as I have seen it both in Guernsey  and Sark between the 21st of June and the end of July in 1866, but I  have not seen it in any of the Islands during the autumn. It is,  however, no doubt an occasional, though never very numerous, winter  visitant, probably more common, however, at this time of year than in  the summer, as I have one in winter plumage shot in Guernsey in  December, and another in January, 1879, and there is also one in the  Museum in winter plumage.    Professor Ansted includes it in his list, and marks it as occurring in  Guernsey and Sark.      54. YELLOW WAGTAIL. _Motacilla raii_, Bonaparte. French, \"Bergeronnette  flaveole.\"--As far as I have been able to judge the Yellow Wagtail is  only an occasional visitant on migration. A few, however, may sometimes  remain to breed. I have one Channel Island specimen killed in Guernsey  the last week in March. Mr. MacCulloch, however, writes me word that in  some years they--_i.e._, Yellow Wagtails--are not very uncommon, but of  late, for some reason or other, Wagtails of all sorts have become rare.  He adds--\"I am under the impression that we have more than one Yellow  Wagtail.\" It is, therefore, possible that the Greyheaded Wagtail, the  true _Motacilla flava_ of Linnaeus, may occasionally occur, or in  consequence of the bright yellow of portions of its plumage the  last-mentioned species--the Grey Wagtail--may have been mistaken for a  second species of Yellow Wagtail. I have not myself seen the Yellow  Wagtail in either of the Islands during my summer visits in 1866, 1876,  or 1878; so it certainly cannot be very common during the  breeding-season, or I could scarcely have missed seeing it.    Professor Ansted has not included it in his list, and there is no  specimen at present in the Museum.      55. TREE PIPIT. _Anthus trivialis_, Linnaeus. French, \"Pipit des  arbres,\" \"Pipit des buissons.\"--A very numerous summer visitant to all  the Islands, breeding in great numbers in the parts suited to it. In the  Vale it was very common, many of the furze-bushes on L'Ancresse Common  containing nests. The old male might constantly be seen flying up from  the highest twigs of the furze-bush, singing its short song as it  hovered over the bush, and returning again to the top branch of that or  some neighbouring bush. This continued till about the middle of July,  when the young were mostly hatched, and many of them flown and"]]]
