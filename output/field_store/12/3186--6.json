Am I invited to be present at a suffragette's meeting or is  Jessica simply anxious to show me what nice friends she has?\"    \"No compliments allowed,\" laughed Grace. \"We wish to ask your advice  about something.\"    \"I am at your service,\" said Jessica's father, making her an elaborate  bow. \"Command me as you will.\"    \"'Tis well, most reverend sir. I thank you,\" said Grace, with a curtsy.  \"Now sit you down, I pray, for presently I have a tale to tell.\"    Having conducted Mr. Bright with great ceremony to the arm chair in the  corner, Grace established him with many low bows, much to the amusement  of the girls, with whom Jessica's father was a great favorite. Then  Grace began with her meeting with Mabel Allison and ended with the  letter from Mary Stevens, enclosing the matron's statement.    \"Now, those are all the facts of the case, Mr. Bright,\" she concluded.  \"Will it be possible for us to get Mabel away from Miss Brant, or can  Miss Brant hold her against her will?\"    \"Miss Stevens' letter and the matron's statement are sufficient,\"  answered Mr. Bright. \"This woman cannot hold your little friend. Miss  Brant will in all probability be very angry, and attempt to brave the  matter out. Suppose you and Jessica and I go down there together, Grace,  and see what we can do?\"    \"O Mr. Bright!\" cried Grace, clasping her hands delightedly, \"will you,  truly? Then let's go to-morrow and bring Mabel back with us.\"    \"Very well; you and Jessica meet me at my office at four o'clock  to-morrow afternoon,\" said Mr. Bright. \"But what do you girls intend to  do with her, once you get her? You can't adopt her, you know.\"    \"She is to take turns living with us, papa,\" said Jessica, slipping her  hand into her father's. \"May she come here first? I'd love to have her.\"    Mr. Bright drew Jessica to his side. \"My dear child, you know that you  may do as you please about it. I feel sure that she must be the right  sort of girl, or you and your friends wouldn't have become interested in  her. Try her, and if you like her, then she is welcome to stay as long  as she chooses. I think it would do you good to have a girl of your own  age in the house.\"    \"Three cheers for Mr. Bright,\" cried Nora.    The cheers were given with a will, then the girls joined hands and  danced around Jessica's father, sounding their class yell until he broke  through the circle and made a rush for the library, his fingers to his  ears.    \"Now that we have that question settled,\" said Miriam Nesbit, after the  girls were once more seated, \"I think we ought to have a sorority pin.\"    \"I think,\" began Eva Allen, \"that my brother would design a pin for us.  He is very clever at that sort of thing.\"    \"Let's have a monogram,\" exclaimed Grace. \"Old English letters of gold  on a dull-green enamel background. We can get them up for about two  dollars and a half apiece. Is that too expensive?\"    The girls, who, with the exception of Anne, had small allowances of  their own, expressed themselves satisfied; while Anne determined that  for once she was justified in yielding to wild extravagance.    \"That's settled,\" said Miriam. \"The next thing to do is----\"    But a loud ring of the door bell interrupted her speech and caused the  whole party to start.    \"Some one to see papa,\" said Jessica. \"Go on with what you were saying,  Miriam.\"    But before Miriam had a chance to continue, the maid entered the room, a  letter in her hand.    \"Here's a letter, Miss Jessica,\" she said. \"But it's such a quare name  on the outside, I be wondering if it's fur yerself and no other?\"    Jessica looked at the envelope. It was addressed to the \"Phi Sigma Tau,  care of Miss Jessica Bright.\"    \"Why, who in the world can this be from? I thought no one outside knew  the name of our society as yet,\" said Jessica as she opened the end of  the envelope. Then she turned the page, glanced at the signature, and  gave a little cry of surprise.    \"Just listen to this, girls!\" she exclaimed, and read:              \"'TO THE PHI SIGMA TAU:              \"'After initiating me into your ridiculous society,            you have seen fit to call a meeting of the members            without directly notifying me, therefore I wish to            withdraw from your sorority, as I feel that I have            been deeply insulted. I have this satisfaction,            however, that I would not have met with you to-night,            at any rate. I am entertaining some girls in your            class this evening, whom I find far more congenial            than any previous acquaintances I have made in            Oakdale. We are about to organize a sorority of our            own. Our object will be to enjoy ourselves, not to            continually preach to other people. I am deeply            disappointed in all of you, and assure you that            I am not in the least desirous of continuing your            acquaintance.                             \"'Yours sincerely,                                     \"'ELEANOR SAVELL.'\"    \"Well, of all things!\" exclaimed Nora O'Malley. \"She says she is deeply  insulted because we didn't invite her, but that she didn't intend to  come, at any rate. There's a shining example of consistency for you!\"    \"Who on earth told her about the meeting?\" said Jessica. \"We didn't wait  to ask her to-day.\"    \"I shall have to confess that I am the guilty one,\" said Eva Allen. \"You  didn't say anything to Miriam, Marian and me about Eleanor, and when  I left the locker-room I went back upstairs after a book I had forgotten.  I met Eleanor on the stairs and told her about the meeting, and that you  were waiting in the locker-room for her. You must have left before she  got there, and, of course, she thought you did it purposely.\"    \"Oh, dear, what a mess,\" sighed Grace. \"I didn't mean to slight her. But  Nora said she knew, positively, that Eleanor was entertaining some  guests to-night, so I didn't wait. By the way, Nora, what was that news  of yours that you were so mysterious about this afternoon?\"    \"Just this,\" replied Nora. \"That Edna Wright told me, that I needn't  think we were the only people that could have a sorority. I asked her  what she meant, and she said that she and Rose Lynton and Daisy Culver  had been invited out to Eleanor's to-night for the purpose of forming a  very select club of their own. I am sorry I didn't tell you while in the  locker-room, but you would insist on having secrets, so I thought I'd  have one, too.\"    \"Well, it can't be helped now,\" said Grace. \"It is a pity that Eleanor  has taken up with Edna Wright. She is the only girl in the class that  I really dislike. She is frivolous and empty-headed, and Eleanor is  self-willed and lawless. Put them together, and they will make a bad  combination. As to the other two girls, they are sworn friends of  Edna's.\"    \"I think,\" said Nora, \"that our reform movement is about to end in a  glaring fizzle.\"    \"How can we reform a person who won't have anything to do with us?\"  asked Jessica scornfully.    \"Let us hold her place in this sorority open for her, and let us make it  our business to be ready to help her if she needs us,\" said Anne  thoughtfully. \"Like all spoiled children, she is sure to get into  mischief, and just as sure to come to grief. Mark my words, some day  she'll be glad to come back to the Phi Sigma Tau.\"          CHAPTER IX    THE RESCUE PARTY      It was with mingled feelings of excitement and trepidation that Grace  Harlowe and Jessica Bright hurried toward the office of the latter's  father the following afternoon. Now that they were fairly started on  their mission of rescue, they were not quite so confident as to the  result. To be sure they had unlimited faith in Jessica's father, but it  was so much easier to talk about taking Mabel away from Miss Brant than  to do it.    \"I'm terribly afraid of facing her,\" confided Jessica to Grace. \"She is  the terror of Oakdale, you know.\"    \"She can't hurt us,\" said Grace. \"Your father will do all the talking.  All we need to do is to take charge of Mabel, after Miss Brant gives her  up.\"    \"Well, young ladies,\" said Mr. Bright, as the two girls entered his  office, \"I see you are prompt in keeping your appointment. Let us go at  once, for I must be back here at five o'clock.\"    \"What are you going to say to that terrible woman, papa?\" shuddered  Jessica as they neared the Brant home. \"I'm afraid she'll scratch your  eyes out.\"    \"Am I really in such serious danger?\" asked Mr. Bright in mock alarm.  \"I am glad I brought you girls along to protect me.\"    \"You haven't any idea what a crank she is, Mr. Bright,\" laughed Grace.  \"She fairly snarled at us the other day, when we were coming from  school, because she said we were taking up the whole sidewalk. Poor  little Mabel, no wonder she has a scared look in her eyes all the time.\"    \"Well, here we are,\" responded Mr. Bright, as he rang the bell. \"Now for  the tug of war.\"    As he spoke the door was opened by Mabel, who positively shook in her  shoes when she saw her visitors. \"Don't be frightened,\" whispered Grace,  taking her hand. \"We have come for you.\"    \"May I speak with Miss Brant?\" asked Mr. Bright courteously, as they  stepped into the narrow hall.    Before Mabel had time to answer, a tall, raw-boned woman, with a hard,  forbidding face, shoved her aside and confronted them. It was Miss Brant  herself.    \"Well, what do you want?\" she said rudely.    \"Good afternoon,\" said Mr. Bright courteously. \"Am I speaking to Miss  Brant?\"    \"I guess likely you are,\" responded the woman, \"and you better state  your business now, for I've no time to fool away on strangers.\"    \"You have a young girl with you by the name of Mabel Allison, have you  not?\" asked Mr. Bright.    \"Yes, I have. What's the matter with her? Has she been gettin' into  mischief?

Her husband, he says, has taken another wife; \"so that on that score,\"  he adds, \"he does her no injury.\"    Supposing this fact be true, (which I doubt, as I doubt every mere  assertion from so questionable a quarter,) I shall take leave to put a  question or two to Mr. Wood's conscience. Did he not write from England to  his friend Mr. Darrel, soon after Mary left his house, directing him to  turn her husband, Daniel James, off his premises, on account of her  offence; telling him to inform James at the same time that his wife had  _taken up_ with another man, who had robbed her of all she had--a calumny  as groundless as it was cruel? I further ask if the person who invented  this story (whoever he may be,) was not likely enough to impose similar  fabrications on the poor negro man's credulity, until he may have been  induced to prove false to his marriage vows, and to \"take another wife,\"  as Mr. Wood coolly expresses it? But withal, I strongly doubt the fact of  Daniel James' infidelity; for there is now before me a letter from himself  to Mary, dated in April 1830, couched in strong terms of conjugal  affection; expressing his anxiety for her speedy return, and stating that  he had lately \"received a grace\" (a token of religious advancement) in the  Moravian church, a circumstance altogether incredible if the man were  living in open adultery, as Mr. Wood's assertion implies.    8. Mary, he says, endeavoured to injure the character of his family by  infamous falsehoods, which were embodied in a petition to the House of  Commons, and would have been presented, had not his friends from Antigua,  the Hon. Mr. Byam, and Dr. Coull, disproved her assertions.    I can say something on this point from my own knowledge. Mary's petition  contained simply a brief statement of her case, and, among other things,  mentioned the treatment she had received from Mr. and Mrs. Wood. Now the  principal facts are corroborated by other evidence, and Mr. Wood must  bring forward very different testimony from that of Dr. Coull before  well-informed persons will give credit to his contradiction. The value of  that person's evidence in such cases will be noticed presently. Of the  Hon. Mr. Byam I know nothing, and shall only at present remark that it is  not likely to redound greatly to his credit to appear in such company.  Furthermore, Mary's petition _was_ presented, as Mr. Wood ought to know;  though it was not discussed, nor his conduct exposed as it ought to have  been.    9. He speaks of the liability he should incur, under the Consolidated  Slave Law, of dealing with a free person as a slave.    Is not this pretext hypocritical in the extreme? What liability could he  possibly incur by voluntarily resigning the power, conferred on him by an  iniquitous colonial law, of re-imposing the shackles of slavery on the  bondwoman from whose limbs they had fallen when she touched the free soil  of England?--There exists no liability from which he might not have been  easily secured, or for which he would not have been fully compensated.    He adds in a postscript that Mary had a considerable sum of money with  her,--from L36 to L40 at least, which she had saved in his service. The  fact is, that she had at one time 113 dollars in cash; but only a very  small portion of that sum appears to have been brought by her to England,  the rest having been partly advanced, as she states, to assist her  husband, and partly lost by being lodged in unfaithful custody.    Finally, Mr. Wood repeats twice that it will afford him great pleasure to  state for the governor's satisfaction, if required, such particulars of  \"the woman Molly,\" upon incontestable evidence, as he is sure will acquit  him in his Excellency's opinion \"of acting unkind or ungenerous towards  her.\"    This is well: and I now call upon Mr. Wood to redeem his pledge;--to bring  forward facts and proofs fully to elucidate the subject;--to reconcile, if  he can, the extraordinary discrepancies which I have pointed out between  his assertions and the actual facts, and especially between his account of  Mary Prince's character and his own conduct in regard to her. He has now  to produce such a statement as will acquit him not only in the opinion of  Sir Patrick Ross, but of the British public. And in this position he has  spontaneously placed himself, in attempting to destroy, by his deliberate  criminatory letter, the poor woman's fair fame and reputation,--an attempt  but for which the present publication would probably never have appeared.           *       *       *       *       *    Here perhaps we might safely leave the case to the judgment of the public;  but as this negro woman's character, not the less valuable to her because  her condition is so humble, has been so unscrupulously blackened by her  late master, a party so much interested and inclined to place her in the  worst point of view,--it is incumbent on me, as her advocate with the  public, to state such additional testimony in her behalf as I can fairly  and conscientiously adduce.    My first evidence is Mr. Joseph Phillips, of Antigua. Having submitted to  his inspection Mr. Wood's letter and Mary Prince's narrative, and  requested his candid and deliberate sentiments in regard to the actual  facts of the case, I have been favoured with the following letter from him  on the subject:--         \"London, January 18, 1831.         \"Dear Sir,         \"In giving you my opinion of Mary Prince's narrative, and of       Mr. Wood's letter respecting her, addressed to Mr. Taylor, I       shall first mention my opportunities of forming a proper       estimate of the conduct and character of both       parties.         \"I have known Mr. Wood since his first arrival in Antigua in       1803. He was then a poor young man, who had been brought up       as a ship carpenter in Bermuda. He was afterwards raised to       be a clerk in the Commissariat department, and realised       sufficient capital to commence business as a merchant. This       last profession he has followed successfully for a good many       years, and is understood to have accumulated very       considerable wealth. After he entered into trade, I had       constant intercourse with him in the way of business; and in       1824 and 1825, I was regularly employed on his premises as       his clerk; consequently, I had opportunities of seeing a       good deal of his character both as a merchant, and as a       master of slaves. The former topic I pass over as irrelevant       to the present subject: in reference to the latter, I shall       merely observe that he was not, in regard to ordinary       matters, more severe than the ordinary run of slave owners;       but, if seriously offended, he was not of a disposition to       be easily appeased, and would spare no cost or sacrifice to       gratify his vindictive feelings. As regards the exaction of       work from domestic slaves, his wife was probably more severe       than himself--it was almost impossible for the slaves ever       to give her entire satisfaction.         \"Of their slave Molly (or Mary) I know less than of Mr. and       Mrs. Wood; but I saw and heard enough of her, both while I       was constantly employed on Mr. Wood's premises, and while I       was there occasionally on business, to be quite certain that       she was viewed by her owners as their most respectable and       trustworthy female slave. It is within my personal knowledge       that she had usually the charge of the house in their       absence, was entrusted with the keys, &c.; and was always       considered by the neighbours and visitors as their       confidential household servant, and as a person in whose       integrity they placed unlimited confidence,--although when       Mrs. Wood was at home, she was no doubt kept pretty closely       at washing and other hard work. A decided proof of the       estimation in which she was held by her owners exists in the       fact that Mr. Wood uniformly refused to part with her,       whereas he sold five other slaves while she was with them.       Indeed, she always appeared to me to be a slave of superior       intelligence and respectability; and I always understood       such to be her general character in the place.         \"As to what Mr. Wood alleges about her being frequently       before the police, &c. I can only say I never heard of the       circumstance before; and as I lived for twenty years in the       same small town, and in the vicinity of their residence, I       think I could scarcely have failed to become acquainted with       it, had such been the fact. She might, however, have been       occasionally before the magistrate in consequence of little       disputes among the slaves, without any serious imputation on       her general respectability. She says she was twice summoned       to appear as a witness on such occasions; and that she was       once sent by her mistress to be confined in the Cage, and       was afterwards flogged by her desire. This cruel practice is       very common in Antigua; and, in my opinion, is but little       creditable to the slave owners and magistrates by whom such       arbitrary punishments are inflicted, frequently for very       trifling faults. Mr. James Scotland is the only magistrate       in the colony who invariably refuses to sanction this       reprehensible practice.         \"Of the immoral conduct ascribed to Molly by Mr. Wood, I can       say nothing further than this--that I have heard she had at       a former period (previous to her marriage) a connexion with       a white person, a Capt. ----, which I have no doubt was   "]]]
