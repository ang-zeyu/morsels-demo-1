Of course  these are not exact methods of measurement, and would not be correct  to a hair at one hundred and twenty-five feet, but they perfectly  illustrate the true methods of measurement.    Imagine a base line ten inches long. At each end erect a perpendicular  line. If they are carried to infinity they will never meet: will  be forever ten inches apart. But at the distance of a foot from  the base line incline one line toward the other 63/10000000 of  an inch, and the lines will come together at a distance of three  hundred miles. That new angle differs from the former right angle  almost infinitesimally, but it may be measured. Its value is about  three-tenths of a second. If we lengthen the base line from ten  inches to all the miles we can command, of course the point of  meeting will be proportionally more distant. The angle made by  the lines where they come together will be obviously the same as  the angle of divergence from a right angle at this end. That angle  is called the parallax of any body, and is the angle that would  be made by two lines coming from that body to the two ends of any  conventional base, as the semi-diameter of the earth. That that  angle would vary according to the various distances is easily seen  by Fig. 27.    [Illustration: Fig. 27.]    Let O P be the base. This would subtend a greater angle seen from  star A than from star B. Let B be far enough away, and O P would  become invisible, and B [Page 69] would have no parallax for that  base. Thus the moon has a parallax of 57\" with the semi-equatorial  diameter of the earth for a base. And the sun has a parallax 8\".85  on the same base. It is not necessary to confine ourselves to right  angles in these measurements, for the same principles hold true in  any angles. Now, suppose two observers on the equator should look at  the moon at the same instant. One is on the top of Cotopaxi, on the  west coast of South America, and one on the west coast of Africa.  They are 90 deg. apart--half the earth's diameter between them. The one  on Cotopaxi sees it exactly overhead, at an angle of 90 deg. with the  earth's diameter. The one on the coast of Africa sees its angle with  the same line to be 89 deg. 59' 3\"--that is, its parallax is 57\". Try  the same experiment on the sun farther away, as is seen in Fig. 27,  and its smaller parallax is found to be only 8\".85.    It is not necessary for two observers to actually station themselves  at two distant parts of the earth in order to determine a parallax.  If an observer could go from one end of the base-line to the other,  he could determine both angles. Every observer is actually carried  along through space by two motions: one is that of the earth's  revolution of one thousand miles an hour around the axis; and the  other is the movement of the earth around the sun of one thousand  miles in a minute. Hence we can have the diameter not only of [Page  70] the earth (eight thousand miles) for a base-line, but the  diameter of the earth's orbit (184,000,000 miles), or any part of  it, for such a base. Two observers at the ends of the earth's  diameter, looking at a star at the same instant, would find that it  made the same angle at both ends; it has no parallax on so short a  base. We must seek a longer one. Observe a certain star on the 21st  of March; then let us traverse the realms of space for six months,  at one thousand miles a minute. We come round in our orbit to a  point opposite where we were six months ago, with 184,000,000 of  miles between the points. Now, with this for a base-line, measure  the angles of the same stars: it is the same angle. Sitting in my  study here, I glance out of the window and discern separate bricks,  in houses five hundred feet away, with my unaided eye; they subtend  a discernible angle. But one thousand feet away I cannot distinguish  individual bricks; their width, being only two inches, does not  subtend an angle apprehensible to my vision. So at these distant  stars the earth's enormous orbit, if lying like a blazing ring in  space, with the world set on its edge like a pearl, and the sun  blazing like a diamond in the centre, would all shrink to a mere  point. Not quite to a point from the nearest stars, or we should  never be able to measure the distance of any of them. Professor Airy  says that our orbit, seen from the nearest star, would be the same  as a circle six-tenths of an inch in diameter seen at the distance  of a mile: it would all be hidden by a thread one-twenty-fifth of an  inch in diameter, held six hundred and fifty feet from the eye. If a  straight line could be drawn from a star, Sirius in the east to the  star Vega in the west, touching our [Page 71] earth's orbit on one  side, as T R A (Fig. 28), and a line were to be drawn six months  later from the same stars, touching our earth's orbit on the other  side, as R B T, such a line would not diverge sufficiently from a  straight line for us to detect its divergence. Numerous vain  attempts had been made, up to the year 1835, to detect and measure  the angle of parallax by which we could rescue some one or more of  the stars from the inconceivable depths of space, and ascertain  their distance from us. We are ever impelled to triumph over what is  declared to be unconquerable. There are peaks in the Alps no man has  ever climbed. They are assaulted every year by men zealous of more  worlds to conquer. So these greater heights of the heavens have been  assaulted, till some ambitious spirits have outsoared even  imagination by the certainties of mathematics.    [Illustration: Fig. 28.]    It is obvious that if one star were three times as far from us as  another, the nearer one would seem to be displaced by our movement  in our orbit three times as much as the other; so, by comparing one  star with another, we reach a ground of judgment. The ascertainment  of longitude at sea by means of the moon affords a good illustration.  Along the track where the moon sails, nine bright stars, four planets,  and the sun have been selected. The nautical almanacs give the  distance of the moon from these successive stars every hour in  the night for three years in advance. The sailor can measure the  distance at any time by his sextant. Looking from the world at  D (Fig. 29), the distance of the moon and [Page 72] star is A E,  which is given in the almanac. Looking from C, the distance is only  B E, which enables even the uneducated sailor to find the distance,  C D, on the earth, or his distance from Greenwich.    [Illustration: Fig. 29.--Mode of Ascertaining Longitude.]    So, by comparisons of the near and far stars, the approximate distance  of a few of them has been determined. The nearest one is the brightest  star in the Centaur, never visible in our northern latitudes, which  has a parallax of about one second. The next nearest is No. 61 in  the Swan, or 61 Cygni, having a parallax of 0\".34. Approximate  measurements have been made on Sirius, Capella, the Pole Star,  etc., about eighteen in all. The distances are immense: only the  swiftest agents can traverse them. If our earth were suddenly to  dissolve its allegiance to the king of day, and attempt a flight  to the North Star, and should maintain its flight of one thousand  miles a minute, it would flyaway toward Polaris for thousands upon  thousands of years, till a million years had passed away, before  it reached that northern dome of the distant sky, and gave its  new allegiance to another sun. The sun it had left behind it would  gradually diminish till it was small as Arcturus, then small as  could be discerned by the naked eye, until at last it would finally  fade out in utter darkness long before the new sun was reached.  Light can traverse the distance around our earth eight times in  one second. It comes in eight minutes from the sun, but it takes  three and a quarter years to come from Alpha [Page 73] Centauri,  seven and a quarter years from 61 Cygni, and forty-five years from  the Polar Star.    Sometimes it happens that men steer along a lee shore, dependent  for direction on Polaris, that light-house in the sky. Sometimes it  has happened that men have traversed great swamps by night when that  star was the light-housse of freedom. In either case the exigency  of life and liberty was provided for forty-five years before by a  Providence that is divine.    We do not attempt to name in miles these enormous distances; we  must seek another yard-stick. Our astronomical unit and standard of  measurement is the distance of the earth from the sun--92,500,000  miles. This is the golden reed with which we measure the celestial  city. Thus, by laying down our astronomical unit 226,000 times, we  measure to Alpha Centauri, more than twenty millions of millions  of miles. Doubtless other suns are as far from Alpha Centauri and  each other as that is from ours.    Stars are not near or far according to their brightness. 61 Cygni is  a telescopic star, while Sirius, the brightest star in the heavens,  is twice as far away from us. One star differs from another star  in intrinsic glory.    The highest testimonies to the accuracy of these celestial observations  are found in the perfect predictions of eclipses, transits of planets  over the sun, occultation of stars by the moon, and those statements  of the Nautical Almanac that enable the sailor to know exactly  where he is on the pathless ocean by the telling of the stars:  \"On the trackless ocean this book is the mariner's trusted friend  and counsellor; daily and nightly its revelations bring safety  to ships in all parts of the [Page 74] world. It is something more  than a mere book; it is an ever-present manifestation of the order  and harmony of the universe.\"    Another example of this wonderful accuracy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15622"],[0,"Handbook on Japanning: 2nd Edition (#11)"],[1,"pp. Price 12s. 6d. net.
