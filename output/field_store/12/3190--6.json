Of these the ground  squirrels _Citellus tereticaudus_ and _Ammospermophilus harrisii_ are  most often noted on the Range Reserve using the dens as a retreat, the  _Ammospermophilus_ seldom being observed to enter any other kind of  burrow. It should be added that the total observations include dens  which have been deserted by their rightful owners.      NATURAL CHECKS.    The enemies of the kangaroo rat are not determined in detail, or as to  relative importance, but the badger (_Taxidea taxus berlandieri_) and  the kit fox, or swift (_Vulpes macrotis neomexicana_), may well be  foremost. Dens which have been deeply excavated by badgers are  frequently seen, and sometimes two or three badger tunnels penetrate one  burrow system. Dens thus despoiled are probably soon reoccupied even if  the original owner is captured, and in the course of a few months the  reworking of the abode obliterates the signs of destruction.    Droppings of the kit fox show an abundance of bones of small mammals of  kangaroo rat size, among them those of _spectabilis_.    Bobcats (_Lynx baileyi_) and coyotes (_Canis mearnsi_) probably are a  prejudicial factor. Skunks may sometimes be able to surprise the  kangaroo rats, but probably not often. The western horned owl (_Bubo  virginianus pallescens_), the barn owl (_Tyto alba pratincola_), and  perhaps others may well be among the most feared enemies, but no special  investigation of owl pellets on the reserve has been possible. In 592  barn-owl pellets from California were found remains of 230 kangaroo  rats, only one other rodent being represented by a larger number  (McAtee, 1921, 258).    Much more information on enemies is needed. The relatively low rate of  reproduction (see p. 18) indicates comparative freedom from inimical  factors.      PARASITES.    _Dipodomys s. spectabilis_ is regularly infested with a species of flea,  _Ctenophthalmus_ sp. Seldom or never is a specimen taken in reasonably  fresh condition without some of these parasites present on its body,  though of course they desert the body of the host after it becomes cold,  and hence dead specimens left too long may be free from them. The den  conditions are ideal for the breeding of this parasite, because of the  great quantities of fine, dusty, organic refuse littering the tunnels  and furnishing food and refuge for the larvae. As demonstrated to us by  F. C. Bishopp, of the Bureau of Entomology, a handful of this refuse  taken from the floor of a burrow within arm's length of the entrance is  almost certain to contain these larvae.    Less regularly present, perhaps because of its different life history,  is a small tick, _Trombicula_ sp. At times this parasite is very common,  being present on nearly every individual rat, and at other times  specimens are difficult to find; it appears to be more commonly present  in summer and fall than at other seasons, and is found attached chiefly  to the ears.    No internal parasites have been detected. The nocturnal and fossorial  habits of the animal seem to give complete protection against a form of  parasite which is very common among some other rodents of the Range  Reserve, notably _Lepus_ and _Sylvilagus_. Nearly all rabbits are  infested with \"warbles,\" the larvae of a species of bot-fly, _Cuterebra_  (family Oestridae). Other small mammals also are occasionally  parasitized by the _Cuterebra_, but in the handling and examination of  perhaps 200 or more individuals of _spectabilis_ and _merriami_, we have  yet to find a single case of infestation by an oestrid fly.          ABUNDANCE.      One's first impression of a well-occupied _spectabilis_ area is that a  large family must inhabit each den, but, as previously mentioned, we  have gradually been compelled to shift from this conception to the idea  of but a single animal to a mound, except when the young are present.  Therefore a census of the adult kangaroo rat population can readily be  made, simply by counting the mounds. Such a census affords at least a  conservative estimate of the number of adult individuals occupying a  given area.    The first estimates of abundance on the Range Reserve were from actual  counts of dens on areas measured off for experimental fencing, and gave  the figure of about two mounds to the acre. From time to time rough  estimates were made on different portions of the pastures, and these  checked well with the above. Later still, a careful count showed 300  mounds on approximately 160 acres (see p. 8), or 1.87 mounds per acre.  Nine areas of 2 acres each, representing different environmental  conditions, were later selected in different portions of the Range  Reserve, and the dens accurately counted. The number of dens per 2 acres  varied from none to a maximum infestation of 12, neither extreme  occurring over large areas. The total number of dens was found to be 43  on the 18 acres, or an average of 2.38 dens per acre.    From all these estimates it may fairly be concluded that two mounds, or  two animals, per acre is a conservative estimate for the infestation of  the entire Range Reserve, with the possible exception of small areas at  its upper edges, where the altitude limit of _spectabilis_ is passed. It  is, however, impossible to estimate the area of the State infested with  kangaroo rats, for some large stretches of fine grassland show no  kangaroo rats whatever, while others have more than are present on the  reserve; and we have no estimates of the extent of either type.          ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS.      In May, 1894, Fisher found a ranchman at Willcox, Ariz., who complained  more bitterly of the depredations of _spectabilis_ than of those of any  other mammal.    On the United States Range Reserve the food material appropriated by the  kangaroo rat during good years is inappreciable. There is such an excess  of forage grass produced that all the rodents together make very little  difference. But with the periodic recurrence of lean years, when drought  conditions are such that little or no grass grows, the effects of rodent  damage not only become apparent, but may be a critical factor  determining whether a given number of domestic animals can be grazed on  the area (Pl. VIII, Fig. 2).    With two kangaroo rats to the acre (1,280 per square mile), there would  be 64,000 animals on the 50 square miles of the Range Reserve. If each  rat stores 4 pounds of grass seeds and crowns and other edible forage  during the season (and in severe seasons we find that more crowns are  stored than under ordinary conditions), a total of 256,000 pounds, or  128 tons, of edible forage are rendered unavailable to stock. In dry  years it is probable that this amount of forage would be of critical  importance. Allowing 50 pounds of food a day for each steer, the forage  destroyed would be sufficient to provide for the needs of one steer for  5,120 days, or for the needs of 14 steers for one year. On a stock ranch  the size of the Range Reserve this might mean the difference between  success and failure.    It seems not unlikely, therefore, that during seasons of drought the  banner-tailed kangaroo rat, where it is abundant on the grazing ranges  of the Southwest, may be a factor of critical importance in relation to  forage production and carrying capacity. It must be remembered,  moreover, that the stored material consists largely of seeds, so that  this loss is of greater importance than would be the case were it  ordinary forage. Some of the range grasses of this region found in  greatest quantity in the stored material depend in large part, under  certain conditions, upon seed reproduction. Rehabilitation of a depleted  range after severe drought and consequent close grazing and trampling is  retarded by the heavy toll of seed taken by the kangaroo rats.      CONTROL.    Kangaroo rats may be easily eradicated by the use of the poisoned grain  used for prairie-dog control by the Biological Survey and the University  of Arizona Extension Service. This can be obtained by application to the  State representative of the Biological Survey or to the local county  agricultural agent, or may be mixed as follows:         _Formula for poisoned bait._--Dissolve 1 ounce of strychnine       sulphate in 1-1/2 pints of boiling water. Add 1 heaping       tablespoonful of gloss starch, previously mixed with a little cold       water, and boil until a clear paste is formed. Add 1 ounce of       baking soda and stir to a creamy mass. Add 1/2 ounce of glycerine       and 1/4 pint of corn sirup and stir thoroughly. Pour over 16 quarts       of rolled barley and mix well until every grain is evenly coated.       Allow to dry before using.         In bushel quantities use as above directed, 2 ounces of strychnine,       2 ounces of soda, 1 ounce of glycerin, 1-1/4 ounces of starch,       1-1/2 quarts of boiling water, and 5/8 pint of corn sirup.         Scatter poison, when the natural food of the kangaroo rat is       scarce, on clean hard places near the holes, 1 quart to 50 holes.         If powdered strychnine alkaloid is used, prepare the hot starch       paste first. Then sift strychnine and baking soda, previously       thoroughly mixed, into the hot starch paste and stir to a creamy       mass. Proceed as in the above directions with sirup, glycerin,       etc.         Use this poison within five days after mixing or retain in       air-tight containers.         _Caution._--All poison containers and all utensils used in the       preparation of poison should be kept _plainly labeled_ and _out of       reach of children_, irresponsible persons, and live stock.         A spoonful of the poisoned grain scattered about the used entrances       of a mound is sufficient, and prebaiting is not necessary, as with       prairie dogs.
