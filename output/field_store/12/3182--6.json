The reaction was discovered in 1836 by a  Scotch chemist named John Thom, and small quantities of ammonia-soda  were made at that time by the firm of McNaughton & Thom. The successful  carrying out of the process on the large scale depends principally upon  the complete recovery of the expensive reagent, ammonia, and this  problem was only solved within comparatively recent years by Solvay. The  process has been perfected and worked with great success in England by  Messrs. Brunner, Mond, & Co., and has proved a successful rival to the  Leblanc process.    Alkali is also produced to some extent by electrolytic processes,  depending upon the splitting up of a solution of common salt into  caustic soda and chlorine by the use of an electric current.          LECTURE VI    BORIC ACID, BORAX, SOAP      _Boric Acid._--At ordinary temperatures and under ordinary conditions  boric acid is a very weak acid, but like silicic and some other acids,  its relative powers of affinity and combination become very much changed  at high temperatures; thus, fused and strongly heated boric acid can  decompose carbonates and even sulphates, and yet a current of so weak an  acid as hydrogen sulphide, passed through a strong solution of borax,  will decompose it and set free boric acid. Boric acid is obtained  chiefly from Italy. In a tract of country called the Maremma of Tuscany,  embracing an area of about forty square miles, are numerous chasms and  crevices, from which hot vapour and heated gases and springs of water  spurt. The steam issuing from these hot springs contains small  quantities of boric acid, that acid being one of those solid substances  distilling to some extent in a current of steam. The steam vapours thus  bursting forth, owing to some kind of constant volcanic disturbance, are  also more or less laden with sulphuretted hydrogen gas, communicating a  very ill odour to the neighbourhood. These phenomena were at first  looked upon by the people as the work of the devil, and priestly  exorcisms were in considerable request in the hope of quelling them,  very much as a great deal of the mere speech-making at the present time  in England on foreign competition and its evils, and the dulness of  trade, the artificial combinations to keep up prices, to reduce wages,  general lamentation, etc., are essayed in the attempt to charm away bad  trade. At length a kind of prophet arose of a very practical character  in the form of the late Count Lardarel, who, mindful of the fact that  the chemist Hoeffer, in the time of the Grand Duke Leopold I., had  discovered boric acid in the volcanic steam jets, looked hopefully  beyond the exorcisms of the priests and the superstitions of the people  to a possible blessing contained in what appeared to be an unholy  confusion of Nature. He constructed tanks of from 100 to 1000 ft. in  diameter and 7 to 20 ft. in depth, of such a kind that the steam jets  were surrounded by or contained in them, and thus the liquors formed by  condensation became more and more concentrated. These tanks were  arranged at different levels, so that the liquors could be run off from  one to the other, and finally to settling cisterns. Subsequently the  strong liquors were run to lead-lined, wooden vats, in which the boric  acid was crystallised out. Had the industry depended on the use of fuel  it could never have developed, but Count Lardarel ingeniously utilised  the heat of the steam for all the purposes, and neither coal nor wood  was required. Where would that Tuscan boric acid industry have been now  had merely the lamentations of landowners, fears of the people, and  exorcisms of the priests been continued? Instead of being the work of  the arch-enemy of mankind, was not it rather an incitement to a somewhat  high and difficult step in an upward direction towards the attainment,  on a higher platform of knowledge and skill, of a blessing for the whole  province of Tuscany? What was true in the history of that industry and  its development is every whit as true of the much-lamented slackening of  trade through foreign competition or other causes now in this country,  and coming home to yourselves in the hat-manufacturing industry. The  higher platform to which it was somewhat difficult to step up, but upon  which the battle must be fought and the victory won, was one of a higher  scientific and technological education and training. The chemist Hoeffer  made the discovery of boric acid in the vapours, they would no doubt  take note; but Hoeffer went no further; and it needed the man of both  educated and practical mind like Count Lardarel to turn the discovery to  account and extract the blessing. In like manner it was clear that in  our educational schemes for the benefit of the people, there must not  only be the scientific investigator of abstract truth, but also the  scientific technologist to point the way to the practical realisation of  tangible profit. Moreover, and a still more important truth, it is the  scientific education of the proprietors and heads we want--educated  capital rather than educated workmen.    _Borax._--A good deal of the Tuscan boric acid is used in France for the  manufacture of borax, which is a sodium salt of boric acid. Borax is  also manufactured from boronitrocalcite, a calcium salt of boric acid,  which is found in Chili and other parts of South America. The crude  boronitrocalcite or \"tiza\" is boiled with sodium carbonate solution,  and, after settling, the borax is obtained by crystallisation. Borax  itself is found in California and Nevada, U.S.A., and also in Peru,  Ceylon, China, Persia, and Thibet. The commercial product is obtained  from the native borax (known as \"tincal\") by dissolving in water and  allowing the solution to crystallise. The Peruvian borax sometimes  contains nitre. For testing the purity of refined borax the following  simple tests will usually suffice. A solution of the borax is made  containing 1 part of borax to 50 parts of water, and small portions of  the solution are tested as follows: _Heavy metals_ (_lead_, _copper_,  etc.).--On passing sulphuretted hydrogen into the solution, no  coloration or precipitate should be produced. _Calcium Salts._--The  solution should not give a precipitate with ammonium oxalate solution.  _Carbonates._--The solution should not effervesce on addition of nitric  or hydrochloric acid. _Chlorides._--No appreciable precipitate should  be produced on addition of silver nitrate solution and nitric acid.  _Sulphates._--No appreciable precipitate should be produced on adding  hydrochloric acid and barium chloride. _Iron._--50 c.c. of the solution  should not immediately be coloured blue by 0.5 c.c. of potassium  ferrocyanide solution.    _Soap._--Soap is a salt in the chemical sense, and this leads to a wider  definition of the term \"salt\" or \"saline\" compound. Fats and oils, from  which soaps are manufactured, are a kind of _quasi_ salts, composed of a  fatty acid and a chemical constant, if I may use the term, in the shape  of base, namely, glycerin. When these fats and oils, often called  glycerides, are heated with alkali, soda, a true salt of the fatty acid  and soda is formed, and this is the soap, whilst the glycerin remains  behind in the \"spent soap lye.\" Now glycerin is soluble in water  containing dissolved salt (brine), whilst soap is insoluble, though  soluble in pure water. The mixture of soap and glycerin produced from  the fat and soda is therefore treated with brine, a process called  \"cutting the soap.\" The soap separates out in the solid form as a curdy  mass, which can be easily separated. Certain soaps are able to absorb a  large quantity of water, and yet appear quite solid, and in purchasing  large quantities of soap it is necessary, therefore, to determine the  amount of water present. This can be easily done by weighing out ten or  twenty grams of the soap, cut in small pieces, into a porcelain dish and  heating over a gas flame, whilst keeping the soap continually stirred,  until a glass held over the dish no longer becomes blurred by escaping  steam. After cooling, the dry soap is weighed, and the loss of weight  represents the amount of moisture. I have known cases where soap  containing about 83 per cent. of water has been sold at the full market  price. Some soaps also contain more alkali than is actually combined  with the fatty acids of the soap, and that excess alkali is injurious in  washing silks and scouring wool, and is also not good for the skin. The  presence of this free or excess alkali can be at once detected by  rubbing a little phenolphthalein solution on to the freshly-cut surface  of a piece of soap; if free alkali be present, a red colour will be  produced.          LECTURE VII    SHELLAC, WOOD SPIRIT, AND THE STIFFENING AND PROOFING PROCESS      _Shellac._--The resin tribe, of which shellac is a member, comprises  vegetable products of a certain degree of similarity. They are mostly  solid, glassy-looking substances insoluble in water, but soluble in  alcohol and wood spirit. In many cases the alcoholic solutions show an  acid reaction. The resins are partly soluble in alkalis, with formation  of a kind of alkali salts which we may call resin-soaps.    Shellac is obtained from the resinous incrustation produced on the bark  of the twigs and branches of various tropical trees by the puncture of  the female \"lac insect\" (_Taccardia lacca_). The lac is removed from the  twigs by \"beating\" in water; the woody matter floats to the surface,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17748"],[0,"The Extermination of the American Bison (#11)"],[1,"  convinced was an error, for I believe the first figure to have been  nearer the truth.    [Note 30: In testimony whereof the following extract from a letter  written by General Stewart Van Vliet, on March 10, 1897, to Professor  Baird, is of interest:    \"MY DEAR PROFESSOR: On the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant I  saw General Sheridan, and yesterday we called on your taxidermist and  examined the buffalo bull he is setting up for the Museum. I don't think  I have ever seen a more splendid specimen in my life. General Sheridan  and I have seen millions of buffalo on the plains in former times. I  have killed hundreds, but I never killed a larger animal than the one in  the possession of your taxidermist.\"]    [Note 31: Quadrupeds of North America, vol. II, p. 44.]    In mounting the skin of this animal, we endeavored by every means in our  power, foremost of which were three different sets of measurements,  taken from the dead animal, one set to check another, to reproduce him  when mounted in exactly the same form he possessed in life--muscular,  but not fat.    The color of the body and hindquarters of a buffalo is very peculiar,  and almost baffles intelligent description. Audubon calls it \"between a  dark umber and liver-shining brown.\" I once saw a competent artist  experiment with his oil-colors for a quarter of an hour before he  finally struck the combination which exactly matched the side of our  large bull. To my eyes, the color is a pale gray-brown or smoky gray.  The range of individual variation is considerable, some being uniformly  darker than the average type, and others lighter. While the under parts  of most adults are dark brown or blackish brown, others are actually  black. The hair on the body and hinder parts is fine, wavy on the  outside, and woolly underneath, and very dense. Add to this the  thickness of the skin itself, and the combination forms a covering that  is almost impervious to cold.    The entire fore quarter region, _e. g._, the shoulders, the hump, and  the upper part of the neck, is covered with a luxuriant growth of pale  yellow hair (Naples yellow + yellow ocher), which stands straight out in  a dense mass, disposed in handsome tufts. The hair is somewhat woolly in  its nature, and the ends are as even as if the whole mass had lately  been gone over with shears and carefully clipped. This hair is 4 inches  in length. As the living animal moved his head from side to side, the  hair parted in great vertical furrows, so deep that the skin itself  seemed almost in sight. As before remarked, to comb this hair would  utterly destroy its naturalness, and it should never be done under any  circumstances. Standing as it does between the darker hair of the body  on one side and the almost black mass of the head on the other, this  light area is rendered doubly striking and conspicuous by contrast. It  not only covers the shoulders, but extends back upon the thorax, where  it abruptly terminates on a line corresponding to the sixth rib.    From the shoulder-joint downward, the color shades gradually into a dark  brown until at the knee it becomes quite black. The huge fore-arm is  lost in a thick mass of long, coarse, and rather straight hair 10 inches  in length. This growth stops abruptly at the knee, but it hangs within 6  inches of the hoof. The front side of this mass is blackish brown, but  it rapidly shades backward and downward into jet-black.    The hair on the top of the head lies in a dense, matted mass, forming a  perfect crown of rich brown (burnt sienna) locks, 16 inches in length,  hanging over the eyes, almost enveloping both horns, and spreading back  in rich, dark masses upon the light-colored neck.    On the cheeks the hair is of the same blackish brown color, but  comparatively short, and lies in beautiful waves. On the bridge of the  nose the hair is about 6 inches in length and stands out in a thick,  uniform, very curly mass, which always looks as if it had just been  carefully combed.    Immediately around the nose and mouth the hair is very short, straight  and stiff, and lies close to the skin, which leaves the nostrils and  lips fully exposed. The front part of the chin is similarly clad, and  its form is perfectly flat, due to the habit of the animal in feeding  upon the short, crisp buffalo grass, in the course of which the chin is  pressed flat against the ground. The end of the muzzle is very massive,  measuring 2 feet 2 inches in circumference just back of the nostrils.    The hair of the chin-beard is coarse, perfectly straight, jet black, and  111/2 inches in length on our old bull.    Occasionally a bull is met with who is a genuine Esau amongst his kind.  I once saw a bull, of medium size but fully adult, whose hair was a  wonder to behold. I have now in my possession a small lock of hair which  I plucked from his forehead, and its length is 221/2 inches. His horns  were entirely concealed by the immense mass of long hair that nature had  piled upon his head, and his beard was as luxuriant as his frontlet.    [Illustration: BULL BUFFALO IN NATIONAL MUSEUM GROUP. Drawn by Ernest E.  Thompson.]    The nostril opening is large and wide. The color of the hairless  portions of the nose and mouth is shiny Vandyke brown and black, with a  strong tinge of bluish-purple, but this latter tint is not noticeable  save upon close examination, and the eyelid is the same. The iris is of  an irregular pear-shaped outline, 1-5/16 inches in its longest diameter,  very dark, reddish brown in color, with a black edging all around it.  Ordinarily no portion of the white eyeball is visible, but the broad  black band surrounding the iris, and a corner patch of white, is  frequently shown by the turning of the eye. The tongue is bluish purple,  as are the lips inside.    The hoofs and horns are, in reality, jet black throughout, but the horn  often has at the base a scaly, dead appearance on the outside, and as  the wrinkles around the base increase with age and scale up and gather  dirt, that part looks gray. The horns of bulls taken in their prime are  smooth, glossy black, and even look as if they had been half polished  with oil.    As the bull increases in age, the outer layers of the horn begin to  break off at the tip and pile up one upon another, until the horn has  become a thick, blunt stub, with only the tip of what was once a neat  and shapely point showing at the end. The bull is then known as a  \"stub-horn,\" and his horns increase in roughness and unsightliness as he  grows older. From long rubbing on the earth, the outer curve of each  horn is gradually worn flat, which still further mars its symmetry.    The horns serve as a fair index of the age of a bison. After he is three  years old, the bison adds each year a ring around the base of his horns,  the same as domestic cattle. If we may judge by this, the horn begins to  break when the bison is about ten or eleven years old, and the stubbing  process gradually continues during the rest of his life. Judging by the  teeth, and also the oldest horns I have seen, I am of the opinion that  the natural life time of the bison is about twenty-five years; certainly  no less.    +--------------------------------------------------------+  |                   BISON AMERICANUS.                    |  |                (Male, eleven years old.                |  |           Taken December 6, 1866.

The hair on the shoulders has begun to take on the light  straw-color, and has by this time attained a length which causes it to  arrange itself in tufts, or locks. The body colors have grown darker,  and reached their permanent tone. Of course the hair on the head has by  no means attained its full length, and the head is not at all handsome.    The horns are quite small, but the curve is well defined, and they  distinctly mark the sex of the individual, even at the beginning of the  third year.    +------------------------------------------------------------+  |                     BISON AMERICANUS.                      |  |(Young cow, in third year.
