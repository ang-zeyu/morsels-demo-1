(#11)"],[1,"eraction, according to definite laws, of forces  possessed by the molecules of which the primitive nebulosity of the  universe was composed. If this be true, it is no less certain that the  existing world lay potentially in the cosmic vapor; and that a  sufficient intelligence could, from a knowledge of the properties of  that vapor, have predicted, say, the state of fauna of Great Britain in  1869, with as much certainty as one can say what will happen to the  vapor of the breath on a cold winter's day.\" This is the doctrine of the  self-evolution of the universe. We know not what may lie behind this in  Mr. Huxley's mind; but we are very sure that there is not an idea in the  above paragraph which Epicurus of old, and Buechner, Vogt, Haeckel, and  other \"Materialisten von Profession,\" would not cheerfully adopt. His  distinction between a higher and lower teleology is of no account in  this discussion. What is the teleology to which, he says, Mr. Darwin has  given the death-blow, the extracts given above clearly show. The eye,  Huxley says, was not made for the purpose of seeing, or the ear for the  purpose of hearing. \"According to teleology,\" he says, \"each organism is  like a rifle bullet fired straight at a mark; according to Darwin,  organisms are like grapeshot, of which one hits something and the rest  fall wide.\"[26]    FOOTNOTES:    [19] Mr. Huxley, if we may judge from what he says of himself, is  somewhat liable to be misunderstood. He says he was fourteen years  laboring to resist the charge of Positivism made against the class of  scientific men to which he belongs. He also tells us in his letter to  Professor Tyndall, prefixed to his volume of _Lay Sermons and  Addresses_, that the \"Essay on the Physical Basis of Life,\" included in  that volume, was intended as a protest, from the philosophical side,  against what is commonly called Materialism. It turned out, however,  that the public regarded it as an argument in favor of Materialism. This  we think was a very natural, if not an unavoidable mistake, on the part  of the public. For in that Essay, he says that Protoplasm, or the  physical basis of life, \"is a kind of matter common to all living  beings, that the powers or faculties of all kinds of living matter,  diverse as they may be in degree, are substantially of the same kind.\"  Protoplasm as far as examined contains the four elements,--carbon,  hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. These are lifeless bodies, \"but when  brought together under certain conditions, they give rise to the still  more complex body Protoplasm; and this protoplasm exhibits the phenomena  of life.\" There is no more reason, he teaches, for assuming the  existence of a mysterious something called vitality to account for vital  phenomena, than there is for the assumption of something called Aquasity  to account for the phenomena of water. Life is said to be \"the product  of a certain disposition of material molecules.\" The matter of life is  \"composed of ordinary matter, differing from it only in the manner in  which its atoms are aggregated. I take it,\" he says, \"to be demonstrable  that it is utterly impossible to prove that anything whatever may not be  the effect of a material and necessary cause, and that human logic is  equally incompetent to prove that any act is really spontaneous. A  really spontaneous act is one, which, by the assumption, has no cause;  and the attempt to prove such a negative as this, is on the face of the  matter absurd. And while it is thus a philosophical impossibility to  demonstrate that any given phenomenon is not the effect of a material  cause, any one who is acquainted with the history of science will admit  that its progress has, in all ages, meant, and now more than ever means,  the extension of what we call matter and causation, and the concomitant  gradual banishment from all regions of human thought of what we call  spirit and spontaneity.\"    [20] It cannot escape the attention of any one that Mr. Darwin, Mr.  Wallace, Professor Huxley, and all the other advocates or defenders of  Darwinism, do not pretend to prove anything more than that species _may_  be originated by selection, not that there is no other satisfactory  account of their origin. Mr. Darwin admits that referring them to the  intention and efficiency of God, accounts for everything, but, he says,  that is not science.    [21] _Lay Sermons, Addresses, and Reviews_. By Thomas Henry Huxley, LL.  D., F. R. S. London, 1870, p. 323.    [22] _Evidence of Man's Place in Nature_. London, 1864, p. 107.    [23] Since writing the above paragraph our eye fell on the following  note on the 89th page of the Duke of Argyle's _Reign of Law_, which it  gives us pleasure to quote. It seems that a writer in the _Spectator_  had charged Professor Huxley with Atheism. In the number of that paper  for February 10, 1866, the Professor replies: \"I do not know that I care  very much about popular odium, so there is no great merit in saying that  if I really saw fit to deny the existence of a God I should certainly do  so, for the sake of my own intellectual freedom, and be the honest  atheist you are pleased to say I am. As it happens, however, I cannot  take this position with honesty, inasmuch as it is, and always has been,  a favorite tenet, that Atheism is as absurd, logically speaking, as  Polytheism.\" In the same paper he says, \"The denying the possibility of  miracles seems to me quite as unjustifiable as speculative Atheism.\" How  this can be reconciled with the passages quoted above, we are unable to  see.    [24] _Lay Sermons_, etc., p. 330.    [25] _Contemporary Review_, vol. xviii. 1871, p. 444. In this same  article Mr. Huxley says: \"Elijah's great question, Will ye serve God or  Baal? Choose ye, is uttered audibly enough in the ears of every one of  us as we come to manhood. Let every man who tries to answer it seriously  ask himself whether he can be satisfied with the Baal of authority, and  with all the good things his worshippers are promised in this world and  the next. If he can, let him, if he be so inclined, amuse himself with  such scientific implements as authority tells him are safe and will not  cut his fingers; but let him not imagine that he is, or can be, both a  true son of the Church and a loyal soldier of science.\" \"And, on the  other hand, if the blind acceptance of authority appear to him in its  true colors, as mere private judgment _in excelsis_, and if he have  courage to stand alone face to face with the abyss of the Eternal and  Unknowable, let him be content, once for all, not only to renounce the  good things promised by 'Infallibility,' but even to bear the bad things  which it prophesies; content to follow reason and fact in singleness and  honesty of purpose, wherever they may lead, in the sure faith that a  hell of honest men will to him be more endurable than a paradise full of  angelic shams.\" There can be no doubt that the Apostle Paul believed in  the infallibility of the Scriptures. Imagine Professor Huxley calling  St. Paul to his face, a sham! What are all the Huxleys who have ever  lived or ever can live, to that one Paul in power for good over human  thought, character, and destiny!    Professor Huxley goes on in the next paragraph to say: \"Mr. Mivart  asserts that 'without belief in a personal God there is no religion  worthy of the name.' This is a matter of opinion. But it may be  asserted, with less reason to fear contradiction, that the worship of a  personal God, who, on Mr. Mivart's hypothesis, must have used words  studiously calculated to deceive his creatures and worshippers, is 'no  religion worthy of the name.' 'Incredibile est, Deum illis verbis ad  populum fuisse locutum quibis deciperetur,' is a verdict in which for  once Jesuit casuistry concurs with the healthy moral sense of all  mankind.\" (p. 458). Mr. Huxley calls believers in the Scriptures, and  (apparently) believers in a personal God, bigots, old ladies of both  sexes, bibliolators, fools, etc., etc.    [26] _Lay Sermons_, etc. p. 331.      _Buechner._    Dr. Louis Buechner, president of the medical association of  Hessen-Darmstadt, etc., etc., is not only a man of science but a popular  writer. Perhaps no book of its class, in our day, has been so widely  circulated as his volume on \"Kraft und Stoff,\" Matter and Force. It has  been translated into all the languages of Europe. He holds that matter  and force are inseparable; there cannot be the one without the other;  both are eternal and imperishable; neither can be either increased or  diminished; life originated spontaneously by the combination of  molecules of matter under favorable conditions; all the phenomena of the  universe, inorganic and organic, whether physical, vital, or mental, are  due to matter and its forces. Consequently there is no God, no creation,  no mind distinct from matter, no conscious existence of man after death.  All this is asserted in the most explicit terms. Dr. Buechner has  published a work on Darwinism in two volumes. Darwin's theory, he says,  \"is the most thoroughly naturalistic that can be imagined, and far more  atheistic than that of his decried predecessor Lamarck, who admitted at  least a general law of progress and development; whereas, according to  Darwin, the whole development is due to the gradual summation of  innumerable minute and accidental operations.\"[27]    FOOTNOTE:    [27] _Sechs Vorlesungen ueber die Darwinische Theorie_.

We see him elsewhere referred to as one  of the first physiologists of Germany. Vogt devotes the concluding  lecture of the second volume of his work on Man, to the consideration  of Darwinism. He expresses his opinion of it, after high commendation,  in the following terms. He says that it cannot be "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19200"],[0,"The History of a Lie: \"The Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion\" (#11)"],[1,"the persecutions       which are directed against us.... With the press in our hands we       can turn wrong into right, dishonesty into honesty. We can shake       all foundations and separate families. We can destroy faith in all       that our enemies believed until now. We can ruin credits and arouse       passions. We can declare war; we can give fame or disgrace. We can       uplift or ruin talent. (Page 43.)    [_The following are parallel extracts from the imaginary Rabbi's speech  vouched for by the author of the novelette as fact a number of years  later._]           SECOND STAGE OF THE LIE--\"THE RABBI'S SPEECH\"         When we become at last the sole possessors of all the gold to be       found on earth, the power will practically be transferred to our       hands, and the promises made to Abraham will be fulfilled. Gold--is       the greatest power on earth, it is might, reward, the instrument of       every authority, it is all man, both fears and desires.... The       problem before us now is to facilitate even to a greater extent the       means of contracting these loans and thus to become the sole       managers of all the valuables, after which the exploitation of all       their railroads, mines, forests, large factories and industrial       plants, as well as of all other real property, including duties and       taxes, will fall into our hands, as a security for the capital lent       to us by the various states.         Agriculture will forever remain the principal source of a country's       wealth. The possession of large plots of land will pave for us even       a broader way to honors and will strengthen our influence over the       highest officials of the country. From this follows, that our       efforts will be directed towards inducing our brethren in Israel to       make large agricultural purchases. We must, therefore, do our       utmost to break up large estates into small parcels, in order to be       able to purchase them in the easiest and quickest way. Under the       pretext of trying to help the working classes, it is necessary to       oppress the large landowners with taxation in all its severity.       When these possessions will thus gradually be transferred in our       hands, the whole labor of the Christian proletariat will become for       us a new source of tremendous profits.         Commerce and speculation--these branches, most plentiful in their       fruits,--must never be suffered to slip out of the hands of the       Israelites,--with this object in view the people of Israel must       direct its ambition towards those high offices of authority which       have the power to distribute honors and esteem.         Since the Christian Church is one of our most dangerous enemies, we       must work tirelessly to weaken its influence, and in order to       accomplish this, it is necessary to use all our efforts to implant       in the Christian intellectual class ideas of Atheism, scepticism,       dissension and to call forth religious disputes among the       newly-formed groups and sects of Christendom.         It is very important for us to pretend to be expounders and       protagonists of social questions prevalent at the time in a       country, especially of those whose aim it is to better the fate of       the workingman; but, in reality, our efforts must gravitate towards       possession and rule over the movements of public opinion.         The blindness of the masses and the tendency of their leaders to       fall for oratory as empty as it is loud, will make them easy prey       for us and a double weapon for our popularity and credit. With the       aid of oratory, our speakers will be able to make people believe       our artificial enthusiasm which Christians usually attain through       genuine sentiment....         Once we become absolute masters of the press, we will easily be       able to refashion the ideas of honor, of virtue, of       faithfulness--and to deal the first blow to the family-conception       which is considered to this day as the most sacred institution and       which must be reduced to a state of decay. We shall then be able to       uproot the belief in that which our enemies, the Christians, shall       have worshipped until that time and instead of that, having brought       up the army in a spirit of infatuation with the various passions,       we shall openly declare war upon everything which the Gentiles are       at present revering and worshipping....    [_The following are extracts from the new version of the \"protocols\"  introduced by Nilus in 1905, showing the different stages of the  forgery._]           THIRD STAGE OF THE LIE--\"THE PROTOCOLS\"[*]         [Footnote *: These extracts are taken from \"The Protocols of the       Wise Men of Zion,\" published by the Beckwith Company, New York,       1920.]         All the wheels of the government mechanism are driven by the motor       which is in our hands, and that motor is--gold. (Prot. 5.)         To make it possible for liberty definitely to disintegrate and ruin       Gentile society, industry must be placed upon a speculative basis.       The result will be that all products extracted from industry from       the soil will not remain in their hands but will pass through       speculation into our possession. (Prot. 4.)         The aristocracy of the Gentiles as a political force has passed       away.... But as owners of land, they are harmful to us in that they       are independent in their sources of livelihood. Therefore at all       costs we must deprive them of their land. The best means to attain       this is to increase land taxes and mortgage indebtedness. These       measures will keep land ownership in a state of unconditional       subordination. (Prot. 6.)         See second quotation above.         At the same time it is necessary to encourage trade and industry       vigorously and especially speculation, the function of which is to       act as a counterpoise to industry.... It is necessary for industry       to deplete the land both of laborers and capital, and, through       speculation, transfer all the money of the world into our hands,       thereby throwing the Gentiles into the ranks of the proletariat.       (Prot. 6.)         It is for this reason that we must undermine faith, eradicate from       the minds of the Gentiles the very principle of God and soul and       replace these conceptions by mathematical calculations and material       desires. (Prot. 4.)         We have taken good care long ago to discredit the Gentile clergy       and thereby to destroy their mission, which at present might hamper       us considerably. Their influence over people diminishes daily.       (Prot. 17.)         It is indispensible for our purposes that, as far as possible, wars       should bring no territorial advantages. This will shift war to an       economic footing and nations will perceive the strength of our       superiority in the aid we render. Such a condition of affairs will       place both sides under the control of our international agents with       their million eyes, whose vision is unhampered by any frontiers.       (Prot. 2.)         We will represent ourselves as the saviors of the laboring classes       who have come to liberate them from this oppression by suggesting       that they join our army of socialists, anarchists, communists, to       whom we always extend our help under the guise of the fraternal       principles of the universal solidarity of our social masonry....       (Prot. 3.)         We will adopt for ourselves the liberal side of all parties and all       movements and provide orators who will talk so much that they will       tire the people with their speeches until they turn from orators in       disgust. (Prot. 5.)         We shall handle the press in the following manner ... to end of       Protocol 12.          CHAPTER FOUR    THE RUSSIAN SPONSORS OF THE FORGERY    Nilus on the Protocols--Only \"the God-Anointed Tsar of Russia\" Can Save  the World--Passages from Nilus Omitted by Translators--On Tolstoy--On the  Emancipation of Women--On the \"Sanhedrin\" and \"its Faithful Ally,  England.\"      In 1905 the second edition of Serge Nilus's book appeared, printed on  government presses at Tsarskoye Selo, containing a new and elaborated  version of the protocols.    The translators of the Nilus protocols published in his 1905 edition, a  copy of which is in the British Museum, have deliberately omitted  numerous passages from his prologue and epilogue. These passages show  clearly the purpose of the volume. Nilus writes: \"We may perhaps be  reproached, and justly, for the apocryphal character of the document  presented. But if it were possible to demonstrate its accuracy by  documents or through the testimony of trustworthy witnesses, if it were  possible to unveil the faces of those who are at the head of the world  conspiracy and who hold its bloody strings in their hands, then the very  'mystery of lawlessness' would be infringed upon, and it must remain  intact until its incarnation in the 'son of destruction.'\" Then he goes  on to say that the world is rushing towards its destruction, and that  there is only one force that can save it, and that is the \"God-Anointed  Tsar of Russia.\" The omitted portions of the Nilus book show distinctly  that it is a work of propaganda for the Russian autocracy. Nilus  denounced Leo Tolstoy, the emancipation of women, and all movements  leading toward progress.    The editors of the protocols in Europe and America, realizing that these  passages would disclose to intelligent people the real motive of the  Nilus protocols and thus discredit them, have deliberately omitted them  in the translations.    Here are some of the omitted portions of the notorious Nilus book, which  are his own utterances and do not purport to constitute a part of the  Protocols. They are "]]]
