When he saw that David was only a boy, he said, \"You are not able to go  against this Philistine. You are only a boy, while he has fought in many  battles.\"    Then David said to the king, \"Once, when I was guarding my father's  sheep, I killed a lion and a bear without help from any one but the  Lord. He will help me fight this man.\"    Then the king said, \"Go, and the Lord be with you.\"    The king fitted David with heavy armor and gave to him his own sword,  but David said, \"I am not used to this heavy armor; it will only hinder  me.\"    So he threw it off.    Then David went to a brook near by and chose five smooth stones.    [Illustration]    Armed with these five stones and his sling; he went bravely out to meet  the giant.    When the giant saw that David was only a boy, he was angry and cried  out:    \"Do you dare fight with me? I will kill you, and will give your flesh to  the birds and the beasts.\"    David looked at him without fear and said, \"You come against me with a  sword and with a spear and with a shield, but I come to you in the name  of the Lord. This day will he give you into my hand. I will kill you  and take your head from you, and I will give the bodies of the  Philistines to the birds and the beasts.\"    When they came near to each other, David fitted one of the five stones  to his sling.    He whirled the sling swiftly about his head. The stone flew straight to  its mark. It struck the Philistine full in the forehead. The huge giant  took one step and, with a groan, fell to the earth.    Then David, standing upon the giant, took his sword and cut off the head  of his enemy.    When the Philistines saw that their giant was dead, they were filled  with fear.    They left their camp and tried to run away, but the army of Israel  followed them and won a great victory.    For this brave deed David was made a captain and was held in honor by  the king.    _Adapted from the Bible_          PHONETIC TABLES      The following tables are planned to supplement those already developed  in the \"Beacon Primer\" and in the \"Beacon First Reader.\"    The earlier tables are introduced in order that the teacher may have  them for rapid review work with her slower pupils, and also for those  pupils entering the class without any previous phonetic training.    The strictly new matter, which includes the last ten pages, should  receive special emphasis and care in its development and drill.

The motive of the attack was not mere lust of  conquest, but rather the desire of gain. The Wady Magharah contained  mines of copper and of turquoise, which the Egyptians desired to work;  and for this purpose it was necessary to hold the country by a set of  military posts, in order that the miners might pursue their labours  without molestation. Some ruins of the fortifications are still to be  seen; and the mines themselves, now exhausted, pierce the sides of the  rocks, and bear in many places traces of hieroglyphical inscriptions The  remains of temples show that the expatriated colonists were not left  without the consolations of religion, while a deep well indicates the  care that was taken to supply their temporal needs. Thousands of stone  arrow-heads give evidence of the presence of a strong garrison, and make  us acquainted with the weapon which they found most effectual against  their enemies.    [Illustration: TABLET AT SNEFERU AT WADY-MAGHARAH.]    Sneferu calls himself _Neter aa_, \"the Great God,\" and _Neb mat_, \"the  Lord of Justice.\" He is also \"the Golden Horus,\" or \"the Conqueror.\"  _Neb mat_ is not a usual title with Egyptian monarchs; and its  assumption by Sneferu would seem to mark, at any rate, his appreciation  of the excellence of justice, and his desire to have the reputation of a  just ruler. Later ages give him the title of \"the beneficent king,\" so  that he would seem to have been a really unselfish and kindly sovereign.  His form, however, only just emerges from the mists of the period to be  again concealed from our view, and we vainly ask ourselves what exactly  were the benefits that he conferred on Egypt, so as to attain his high  reputation.    Still, the monuments of his time are sufficient to tell us something of  the Egypt of his day, and of the amount and character of the  civilization so early attained by the Egyptian people. Besides his own  tablet in the Wady Magharah, there are in the neighbourhood of the  pyramids of Ghizeh a number of tombs which belong to the officials of  his court and the members of his family. These tombs contain both  sculptures and inscriptions, and throw considerable light on the  condition of the country.    In the first place, it is apparent that the style of writing has been  invented which is called hieroglyphical, and which has the appearance of  a picture writing, though it is almost as absolutely phonetic as any  other. Setting apart a certain small number of \"determinatives,\" each  sign stands for a sound--the greater part for those elementary sounds  which we express by letters. An eagle is _a_, a leg and foot _b_, a  horned serpent _f_, a hand _t_, an owl _m_, a chicken _u_, and the like.  It is true that there are signs which express a compound sound, a whole  word, even a word of two syllables. A bowl or basin represents the sound  of _neb_, a hatchet that of _neter_, a guitar that of _nefer_, a  crescent that of _aah_, and so on. Secondly, it is clear that artistic  power is considerable. The animal forms used in the hieroglyphics--the  bee, the vulture, the uraeus, the hawk, the chicken, the eagle--are well  drawn. In the human forms there is less merit, but still they are fairly  well proportioned and have spirit. No rudeness or want of finish  attaches either to the writing or to the drawing of Sneferu's time; the  artists do not attempt much, but what they attempt they accomplish.    Next, we may notice the character of the tombs. Already the tomb was  more important than the house; and while every habitation constructed  for the living men of the time has utterly perished, scores of the  dwellings assigned to the departed still exist, many in an excellent  condition. They are stone buildings resembling small houses, each with  its door of entrance, but with no windows, and forming internally a  small chamber generally decorated with sculptures. The walls slope at an  angle of seventy-five or eighty degrees externally, but in the interior  are perpendicular. The roof is composed of large flat stones. Strictly  speaking, the chambers are not actual tombs, but mortuary chapels. The  embalmed body of the deceased, encased in its wooden coffin (Gen. 1.  26), was not deposited in the chamber, but in an excavation under one of  the walls, which was carefully closed up after the coffin had been  placed inside it. The chamber was used by the relations for sacred  rites, sacrificial feasts, and the like, held in honour of the deceased,  especially on the anniversary of his death and entrance into Amenti. The  early Egyptians indulged, like the Chinese, in a worship of ancestors.  The members of a family met from time to time in the sepulchral chamber  of their father, or their grandfather, and went through various  ceremonies, sang hymns, poured libations, and made offerings, which were  regarded as pleasing to the departed, and which secured their protection  and help to such of their descendants as took part in the pious  practices.    Sometimes a tomb was more pretentious than those above described. There  is an edifice at Meydoum, improperly termed a pyramid, which is thought  to be older than Sneferu, and was probably erected by one of the  \"shadowy kings\" who preceded him on the throne. Situated on a natural  rocky knoll of some considerable height, it rises in three stages at an  angle of 74 deg. 10' to an elevation of a hundred and twenty-five feet. It  is built of a compact limestone, which must have been brought from some  distance. The first stage has a height a little short of seventy feet;  the next exceeds thirty-two feet; the third is a little over twenty-two  feet. It is possible that originally there were more stages, and  probable that the present highest stage has in part crumbled away; so  that we may fairly reckon the original height to have been between a  hundred and forty and a hundred and fifty feet The monument is generally  regarded as a tomb, from its situation in the Memphian necropolis and  its remote resemblance to the pyramids; but as yet it has not been  penetrated, and consequently has not been proved to have been  sepulchral.    [Illustration: PYRAMID OF MEYDOUM.]    A construction, which has even a greater appearance of antiquity than  the Meydoum tower, exists at Saccarah. Here the architect carried up a  monument to the height of two hundred feet, by constructing it in six or  seven sloping stages, having an angle of 73 deg. 30'. The core of his  building was composed of rubble, but this was protected on every side by  a thick casing of limestone roughly hewn, and apparently quarried on the  spot. The sepulchral intention of the construction is unquestionable. It  covered a spacious chamber excavated in the rock, whereon the monument  was built, which, when first discovered, contained a sarcophagus and  was lined with slabs of granite. Carefully concealed passages connected  the chamber with the outer world, and allowed of its being entered by  those in possession of the \"secrets of the prison-house.\" In this  structure we have, no doubt, the tomb of a king more ancient than  Sneferu--though for our own part we should hesitate to assign the  monument to one king rather than another.    If we pass from the architecture of the period to its social condition,  we remark that grades of society already existed, and were as pronounced  as in later times. The kings were already deities, and treated with  superstitious regard. The state-officials were a highly privileged  class, generally more or less connected with the royal family. The land  was partly owned by the king (Gen. xlvii. 6), who employed his own  labourers and herdsmen upon it; partly, mainly perhaps, it was in the  hands of great landed proprietors--nobles, who lived in country houses  upon their estates, maintaining large households, and giving employment  to scores of peasants, herdsmen, artizans, huntsmen, and fishermen. The  \"lower orders\" were of very little account. They were at the beck and  call of the landed aristocracy in the country districts, of the  state-officials in the towns. Above all, the monarch had the right of  impressing them into his service whenever he pleased, and employing them  in the \"great works\" by which he strove to perpetuate his name.    [Illustration: GREAT PYRAMID OF SACCARAH (_Present appearance_).]    [Illustration: SECTION OF THE SAME, SHOWING ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION.]    There prevailed, however, a great simplicity of manners. The dress of  the upper classes was wonderfully plain and unpretending, presenting  little variety and scarcely any ornament. The grandee wore, indeed, an  elaborate wig, it being imperative on all men to shave the head for the  sake of cleanliness. But otherwise, his costume was of the simplest and  the scantiest. Ordinarily, when he was employed in the common duties of  life, a short tunic, probably of white linen, reaching from the waist  to a little above the knee, was his sole garment. His arms, chest, legs,  even his feet, were naked; for sandals, not to speak of stockings or  shoes, were unknown. The only decoration which he wore was a chain or  riband round the neck, to which was suspended an ornament like a  locket--probably an amulet. In his right hand he carried a long staff or  wand, either for the purpose of belabouring his inferiors, or else to  use it as a walking-stick. On special occasions he made, however, a more  elaborate toilet. Doffing his linen tunic, he clothed himself in a  single, somewhat scanty, robe, which reached from the neck to the  ankles; and having exchanged his chain and locket for a broad collar,  and adorned his wrists with bracelets, he was ready to pay visits or to  receive company. He had no carriage, so far as appears, not even a  palanquin; no horse to ride,"]]]
