What could he not have accomplished, he to whom Kant and Goethe,  Schiller and Koerner paid tributes of unstinted praise, had he not been  doomed to suffer and to starve. Only at the last moment, before he was  silenced forever, was he able to say, _Ich bin ruhig_ (\"I am at peace\").  Yet, in spite of the difficulties and impediments besetting him at every  step, his promise of greatness and usefulness was not belied. In the  Introduction to his commentary on Maimuni's _Guide to the Perplexed  (Gibe'at ha-Moreh)_, in which he attempted to reconcile his master's  system with that of modern philosophy--even as the master had tried to  reconcile Judaism with Aristotelianism--he gave a brief sketch of the  development of modern thought. This part of his work was assiduously  studied by his compatriots. Among his unpublished writings was found a  work on mathematical physics, _Ta'alumot Hokmah_, and in his Talmudic  treatise, _Heshek Shelomoh_, he inserted a dissertation, _Ma'aseh  Hosheb_, on arithmetic, like a skilful physician putting a healing,  though to some it may appear a repelling, balm into a delicious,  attractive capsule.    The story of Maimon, as I have said, is the story of many of the  peripatetic apostles of Haskalah, and his experience was more or less  also theirs. Issachar Falkensohn Behr (or Baer Falkensohn, 1746-1796?),  without funds, friends, or rudimentary knowledge of the subjects  necessary for admission into a public school, left his native city of  Zamosez with the determination to enter the university of \"Little  Berlin,\" as Koenigsberg was called. Too poor to carry out his plan, he  tramped to Berlin. Through the influence of his relatives and  countrymen, Israel Moses Halevi and Daniel Jaffe, he was introduced to  Mendelssohn, and was enabled to devote himself systematically to the  study of German, the alphabet of which he had learned from Wolff's  treatise on mathematics, and to French, Latin, physics, philosophy, and  medicine. In a very short time he mastered them all, especially German.  His _Gedichte eines polnischen Juden_ (Mitau and Leipsic, 1772) caused  no little stir among the poets. Lessing and Goethe, close observers of  symptoms of enlightenment among the Jews, expressed themselves  differently as to the real merit of the collection; but both concurred  with Boie, who, writing to Knebel, the friend of Goethe, remarked  concerning them, \"You are right; the Jewish nation promises much after  it is once awakened.\"[29]    For one reason or another we find that some Slavonic Jewish youths  preferred other places to Berlin for the pursuit of their studies. Such  were Benjamin Wolf Guenzberg and Jacob Liboschuets. The former was  probably the only Jew at the Goettingen University. It was from there  that he inquired of Jacob Emden \"whether it was permissible to dissect  on the Sabbath,\" and his thesis for the doctor's degree was _De medica  ex Talmudicis illustrata_ (Goettingen, 1743).[30] Liboschuets studied at  the University of Halle. After graduation, finding that as a Jew he  could not settle in St. Petersburg, he established himself in Vilna,  where he became celebrated as a diplomat, philanthropist, and, more  especially, expert physician. When Professor Frank was asked who would  take care of the public health in his absence, he is reported to have  said, _Deus et Judaeus_, \"God and the Jew\" [Liboschuets]!    In their deep-rooted love for learning, they sometimes ventured even  beyond the German boundaries, into countries whose language and customs  had little in common with theirs. Padua continued to be the resort of  Russo-Polish Jews that it had been before 1648. Moses Hayyim Luzzatto  found an ardent admirer and zealous propagandist of his principles in  the young medical student Jekuthiel Gordon (ab. 1729), who wrote  concerning his master to friends in Vienna and Vilna.[31] Judah Halevi  Hurwitz (d. 1797), whose work _'Ammude Bet Yehudah_ (Amsterdam, 1765)  was highly recommended by Mendelssohn and Wessely, was a graduate of the  same famous institution. In addition to his medical and philosophic  attainments, he wrote a number of poems, and he was among the first to  translate fables from German into Hebrew.[32]    The story of Zalkind Hurwitz (1740-1812), \"le fameux,\" as he was called  by a French writer, is interesting. Starting, as usual, by going to  Berlin, and succeeding, as usual, in gaining the friendship of  Mendelssohn, he then visited Nancy, Metz, and Strasburg, and finally  settled in Paris. Like Doctor Behr, he had to resort to peddling as a  means for a livelihood. The rudiments of French he acquired from any  book he chanced to obtain. Nevertheless, he soon became proficient in  the language of his adopted country, and wrote his excellent _Apologie  des juifs_, which, crowned by the Academy of Metz and quoted by  Mirabeau, was largely instrumental in removing the disabilities of the  Jews in France. Clermont-Tonnerre, the advocate of Jewish emancipation,  said of him, _Le juif polonais seul avait parle en philosophe_. He was  suggested as a member of the Sanhedrin convoked by Napoleon in 1807.  Though for some reason he never enjoyed the honor of membership in it,  he was, nevertheless, the ruling spirit in the august assembly, and  later generations have paid him the homage he deserves.[33]    Where Hurwitz failed, another of his countrymen was to succeed. Judah  Litvack (1776-1836) removed from Berlin to Amsterdam, became prominent  among the Dutch mathematicians, and wrote a Dutch work, _Verhandeling  over de Profgetallen Gen. ii_ (Amsterdam, 1817), which appeared in a  second edition four years after the first. The author was elected a  member of the Mathesis Artium Genetrix Society, and appointed one of the  deputation sent to the Sanhedrin (February 12, 1807), before which he  delivered a discourse in the German language.    The \"distant isles of the sea,\" the British Islands, Russo-Polish Jews  seem to have frequented ever since the Restoration, probably  contemporaneously with the settlement of the Spanish Jews. The famous  mystic Hayyim Samuel Jacob Falk, one of the many Baal-Shems who  flourished in Podolia at the beginning of the eighteenth century,  settled in London before 1750, and became the subject of many wonder  stories. Sussman Shesnovzi, apparently a countryman of his, describes  him, in a letter to Jacob Emden, as \"standing alone in his generation by  reason of his knowledge of holy mysteries.\" That this was the opinion of  many and prominent personages may be inferred from the fact that among  his callers were such distinguished visitors as the Marchese de Crona,  Baron de Neuhoff, Prince Czartorisky, and the Duke of Orleans. The  confidence of such as these brought Falk a considerable fortune, a large  part of which he bequeathed to a charity fund, the interest of which the  overseers of the United Synagogue still distribute annually among the  poor.[34] Shortly before \"Doctor\" Falk's death (1782), there settled in  London Phinehas Phillips of Krotoschin, the founder of the Phillips  family, which has furnished two Lord Mayors to the city of London.    It was not merely because of its business facilities that England  appealed to the Slavonic Jews. Baruch Shklover, or Schick (1740-1812),  went thither to study medicine, and it was from English literature that  he selected the material for his _Keneh ha-Middah_ (Prague, 1784;  Shklov, 1793), on trigonometry. It would appear that the first Hebrew  book, _Toledot Ya'akob_, printed for a Jew in England, was, as the name  of the author, Eisenstadt, suggests, that of a Slavonic Jew. Although a  silversmith by profession, Israel Lyons (d. 1770) was appointed teacher  of Hebrew at the University of Cambridge. He acquired repute as a Hebrew  scholar, and published, in 1757, the _Scholar's Instructor_, or _Hebrew  Grammar_ (4th ed., 1823), and in 1768 a treatise printed by the  Cambridge Press, _Observations and Inquiries Relating to Various Parts  of Scripture History_. In the same chosen field labored Hyman Hurwitz  (1770-1844), the friend of Coleridge, who founded the Highgate Academy  (1799), and wrote an _Introduction to Hebrew Grammar_, _Vindica  Hebraica_, and _Hebrew Tales_, which were translated into various  languages. He finally became professor of Hebrew in University College,  London.    A younger contemporary of Abrahamson, the Jewish German medallist, was  Solomon (Yom Tob) Bennett (1780-1841), the engraver of Polotsk, who  spent a number of years at Copenhagen and Berlin in perfecting himself  in his art. Among his works is a highly praised bas-relief of Frederick  II, which was much admired by the professors of the Academy. An ardent  lover of liberty, of which there was little more in Germany at that time  than in Russia, he left for England, where he spent the remaining years  of his life, in Bristol. Besides being an artist and an engraver he was  a profound theologian, anxious to defend the cause of Judaism against  enemies within and without. The enemy within he attacked in his cutting  criticism of Solomon Cohen's _Rudiments of Religion_, and the enemy  outside, in his other work, _The Constancy of Israel_ (_Nezah Yisrael_,  London, 1809). He also wrote expositions on many important Biblical  topics, such as sacrifices (1815) and the Temple (1824). Having pointed  out the defects of the Authorized Version (1834), he was ambitious of  publishing a complete revised translation of the Bible. Specimens  appeared in 1841. Death intervened and frustrated his plans. As Schick  was the first Jew to translate from English into Hebrew, so Bennett was  the first after Manasseh ben Israel to write in English in behalf of his  people.[35]    If the contributions of Slavonic Jews to Latin, German, French, Dutch,  and English literature were not less considerable at that time than  those of the Jews residing in the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15932"],[0,"The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians (#11)"],[1,"equal, and enabled it to  participate in all their occupations and pleasures. We may now give a  few extracts that will give an idea of the contents of some of the most  important passages.

The Apes represent the Spirits of the  Dawn. _From a papyrus (about 1050 B.C.) in the British Museum._]      The following is the opening hymn to Osiris in the Papyrus of Ani:    \"Glory be to Osiris Un-Nefer, the great god who dwelleth in Abydos, king  of eternity, lord of everlastingness, whose existence endureth for  millions of years. Eldest son of the womb of Nut,[1] begotten by Keb,[2]  the Erpat,[3] lord of the crowns of the South and North, lord of the  lofty white crown, prince of gods and men: he hath received the sceptre,  and the whip, and the rank of his divine fathers. Let thy heart in  Semt-Ament[4] be content, for thy son Horus is established on thy  throne. Thou art crowned lord of Tatu[5] and ruler in Abydos.[6] Through  thee the world flourisheth in triumph before the power of Nebertcher.[7]  He leadeth on that which is and that which is not yet, in his name of  'Taherstanef.' He toweth along the earth by Maat[8] in his name of  'Seker'; he is exceedingly mighty and most terrible in his name of  'Osiris'; he endureth for ever and ever in his name of 'Un-Nefer.'  Homage to thee, O King of kings, Lord of lords, Prince of princes, who  from the womb of Nut hast ruled the world and Akert.[9] Thy body is  [like] bright and shining metal, thy head is of azure blue, and the  brilliance of the turquoise encircleth thee. O thou god An of millions  of years, whose body pervadeth all things, whose face is beautiful in  Ta-Tchesert,[10] grant thou to the Ka of the Osiris the scribe Ani  splendour in heaven, power upon earth, and triumph in the Other World.  Grant that I may sail down to Tatu in the form of a living soul, and  sail up to Abydos in the form of the Benu bird;[11] that I may go in and  come out without being stopped at the pylons of the Lords of the Other  World.

The soul  of Ra was incarnate in it.]    [Footnote 12: A name of the realm of Osiris, or the Elysian Fields.]    In another Hymn to Osiris, which is found in the Papyrus of Hunefer, we  have the following: \"The gods come unto thee, bowing low before thee,  and they hold thee in fear. They withdraw and depart when they see thee  endued with the terror of Ra, and the victory of Thy Majesty is over  their hearts. Life is with thee, and offerings of meat and drink follow  thee, and that which is thy due is offered before thy face. I have come  unto thee holding in my hands truth, and my heart hath in it no cunning  (or deceit). I offer unto thee that which is thy due, and I know that  whereon thou livest. I have not committed any kind of sin in the land; I  have defrauded no man of what is his. I am Thoth, the perfect scribe,  whose hands are pure. I am the lord of purity, the destroyer of evil,  the scribe of truth; what I abominate is sin.\"    Here is an address, followed by a short Litany, which forms a kind of  introduction to Chapter 15 in the Papyrus of Ani:    \"Praise be unto thee, O Osiris, lord of eternity, Un-Nefer, Heru-Khuti,  whose forms are manifold, whose attributes are majesty, [thou who art]  Ptah-Seker-Tem in Heliopolis, lord of the Sheta shrine, creator of  Het-ka-Ptah (Memphis) and of the gods who dwell therein, thou Guide of  the Other World, whom the gods praise when thou settest in the sky. Isis  embraceth thee contentedly, and she driveth away the fiends from the  mouth of thy paths. Thou turnest thy face towards Amentet,[1] and thou  makest the earth to shine like refined copper. The dead rise up to look  upon thee, they breathe the air, and they behold thy face when [thy]  disk riseth on the horizon. Their hearts are at peace, inasmuch as they  behold thee, O thou who art Eternity and Everlastingness.
