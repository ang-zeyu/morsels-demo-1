Granny  learned from the Misses Allison that, formerly, the whole  neighborhood had belonged to the Lathrop family. But they had sold  all their land, piece by piece, except the one big lot on which the  house stood. Perhaps it was because they had once been so important  that Mrs. Lathrop seemed to feel herself a little better than the  rest of the people in Primrose Court. At any rate, although she  spoke with all, the Misses Allison were the only ones on whom she  condescended to call. Maida caught a glimpse of her occasionally on  the piazza--a tall, thin woman, white-haired and sharp-featured, who  always wore a worsted shawl.    The house was a big, bulky building, a mass of piazzas and  bay-windows, with a hexagonal cupola on the top. It was painted white  with green blinds and trimmed with a great deal of wooden lace. The  wide lawn was well-kept and plots of flowers, here and there, gave  it a gay air.    Laura had a brother named Harold, who was short and fat. Harold  seemed to do nothing all day long but ride a wheel at a tearing pace  over the asphalt paths, and regularly, for two hours every morning,  to draw a shrieking bow across a tortured violin.    The more Maida watched Laura the less she liked her. She could see  that what Rosie said was perfectly true--Laura put on airs. Every  afternoon Laura played on the lawn. Her appearance was the signal  for all the small fry of the neighborhood to gather about the gate.  First would come the Doyles, then Betsy, then, one by one, the  strange children who wandered into the court, until there would be a  row of wistful little faces stuck between the bars of the fence.  They would follow every move that Laura made as she played with the  toys spread in profusion upon the grass.    Laura often pretended not to see them. She would lift her large  family of dolls, one after another, from cradle to bed and from bed  to tiny chair and sofa. She would parade up and down the walk, using  first one doll-carriage, then the other. She would even play a game  of croquet against herself. Occasionally she would call in a  condescending tone, \"You may come in for awhile if you wish, little  children.\" And when the delighted little throng had scampered to her  side, she would show them all her toy treasures on condition that  they did not touch them.    When the proceedings reached this stage, Maida would be so angry  that she could look no longer. Very often, after Laura had sent the  children away, Maida would call them into the shop. She would let  them play all the rest of the afternoon with anything her stock  afforded.    On the right side of the court lived Arthur Duncan, the Misses  Allison and Rosie Brine. The more Maida saw of Arthur, the more she  disliked him. In fact, she hated to have him come into the shop. It  seemed to her that he went out of his way to be impolite to her,  that he looked at her with a decided expression of contempt in his  big dark eyes. But Rosie and Dicky seemed very fond of him. Billy  Potter had once told her that one good way of judging people was by  the friends they made. If that were true, she had to acknowledge  that there must be something fine about Arthur that she had not  discovered.    Maida guessed that the W.M.N.T.'s met three or four times a week.  Certainly there were very busy doings at Dicky's or at Arthur's  house every other day. What it was all about, Maida did not know.  But she fancied that it had much to do with Dicky's frequent  purchases of colored tissue paper.    The Misses Allison had become great friends with Granny. Matilda,  the blind sister, was very slender and sweet-faced. She sat all day  in the window, crocheting the beautiful, fleecy shawls by which she  helped support the household.    Jemima, the older, short, fat and with snapping black eyes, did the  housework, attended to the parrot and waited by inches on her  afflicted sister. Occasionally in the evening they would come to  call on Granny. Billy Potter was very nice to them both. He was  always telling the sisters the long amusing stories of his  adventures. Miss Matilda's gentle face used positively to beam at  these times, and Miss Jemima laughed so hard that, according to her  own story, his talk put her \"in stitches.\"    Maida did not see Rosie's mother often. To tell the truth, she was a  little afraid of her. She was a tall, handsome, black-browed woman--a  grown-up Rosie--with an appearance of great strength and of even  greater temper. \"Ah, that choild's the limb,\" Granny would say, when  Maida brought her some new tale of Rosie's disobedience. And yet, in  the curious way in which Maida divined things that were not told  her, she knew that, next to Dicky, Rosie was Granny's favorite of  all the children in the neighborhood.    With all these little people to act upon its stage, it is not  surprising that Primrose Court seemed to Maida to be a little  theater of fun--a stage to which her window was the royal box.  Something was going on there from morning to night. Here would be a  little group of little girls playing \"house\" with numerous families  of dolls. There, it would be boys, gathered in an excited ring,  playing marbles or top. Just before school, games like leap-frog, or  tag or prisoners' base would prevail. But, later, when there was  more time, hoist-the-sail would fill the air with its strange cries,  or hide-and-seek would make the place boil with excitement. Maida  used to watch these games wistfully, for Granny had decided that  they were all too rough for her. She would not even let Maida play  \"London-Bridge-is-falling-down\" or \"drop the handkerchief\"--anything,  in fact, in which she would have to run or pull.    But Granny had no objections to the gentler fun of \"Miss  Jennie-I-Jones,\" \"ring-a-ring-a-rounder,\" \"water, water wildflower,\"  \"the farmer in the dell,\" \"go in and out the windows.\" Maida used to  try to pick out the airs of these games on the spinet--she never could  decide which was the sweetest.    Maida soon learned how to play jackstones and, at the end of the  second week, she was almost as proficient as Rosie with the top. The  thing she most wanted to learn, however, was jump-rope. Every little  girl in Primrose Court could jump-rope--even the twins, who were  especially nimble at \"pepper.\" Maida tried it one night--all alone in  the shop. But suddenly her weak leg gave way under her and she fell  to the floor. Granny, rushing in from the other room, scolded her  violently. She ended by forbidding her to jump again without special  permission. But Maida made up her mind that she was going to learn  sometime, even, as she said with a roguish smile, \"if it took a  leg.\" She talked it over with Rosie.    \"You let her jump just one jump every morning and night, Granny,\"  Rosie advised, \"and I'm sure it will be all right. That won't hurt  her any and, after awhile, she'll find she can jump two, then three  and so on. That's the way I learned.\"    Granny agreed to this. Maida practiced constantly, one jump in her  nightgown, just before going to bed, and another, all dressed, just  after she got up.    \"I jumped three jumps this morning without failing, Granny,\" she  said one morning at breakfast. Within a few days the record climbed  to five, then to seven, then, at a leap, to ten.    Dr. Pierce called early one morning. His eyes opened wide when they  fell upon her. \"Well, well, Pinkwink,\" he said. \"What do you mean by  bringing me way over here! I thought you were supposed to be a sick  young person. Where'd you get that color?\"    A flush like that of a pink sweet-pea blossom had begun to show in  Maida's cheek. It was faint but it was permanent.    \"Why, you're the worst fraud on my list. If you keep on like this,  young woman, I shan't have any excuse for calling. You've done fine,  Granny.\"    Granny looked, as Dr. Pierce afterwards said, \"as tickled as Punch.\"    \"How do you like shop-keeping?\" Dr. Pierce went on.    \"Like it!\" Maida plunged into praise so swift and enthusiastic that  Dr. Pierce told her to go more slowly or he would put a bit in her  mouth. But he listened attentively. \"Well, I see you're not tired of  it,\" he commented.    \"Tired!\" Maida's indignation was so intense that Dr. Pierce shook  until every curl bobbed.    \"And I get so hungry,\" she went on. \"You see I have to wait until  two o'clock sometimes before I can get my lunch, because from twelve  to two are my busy hours. Those days it seems as if the school bell  would never ring.\"    \"Sure, tis a foine little pig OI'm growing now,\" Granny said.    \"And as for sleeping--\" Maida stopped as if there were no words  anywhere to describe her condition.    Granny finished it for her. \"The choild sleeps like a top.\"    Billy Potter came at least every day and sometimes oftener. Every  child in Primrose Court knew him by the end of the first week and  every child loved him by the end of the second. And they all called  him Billy. He would not let them call him Mr. Potter or even Uncle  Billy because, he said, he was a child when he was with them and he  wanted to be treated like a child. He played all their games with a  skill that they thought no mere grown-up could possess. Like Rosie,  he seemed to be bubbling over with life and spirits. He was always  running, leaping, jumping, climbing, turning cartwheels and  somersaults, vaulting fences and \"chinning\" himself unexpectedly  whenever he came to a doorway.    \"Oh, Masther Billy, 'tis the choild that you are!\" Granny would say,  twinkling.    \"Yes, ma'am,\" Billy would answer.    At the end of the first fortnight, the neighborhood had accepted  Granny and Maida as the mother-in-law and daughter of a \"traveling  man.\" From the beginning Granny had seemed one of them, but Maida  was a puzzle. The children could not understand how a little girl  could be grown-up and babyish at the same"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17546"],[0,"The Lion of Saint Mark: A Story of Venice in the Fourteenth Century (#11)"],[1,"me, but upon hearing the screams,  I stood up and took the second oar, to arrive as quickly as possible at  the spot. That was how it was that I had it in my hand, when the man  was about to leap into the boat.\"    \"Then there is nothing at all, so far as you know, to direct your  suspicion against anyone as the author of this attack?\"    \"There was nothing,\" Francis said, \"either in the gondola itself, or in  the attire or persons of those concerned in the fray, which could give  me the slightest clue as to their identity.\"    \"At any rate, young gentleman,\" the doge said, \"you appear to have  behaved with a promptness, presence of mind, and courage--for it needs  courage to interfere in a fray of this sort--beyond your years; and, in  the name of the republic, I thank you for having prevented the  commission of a grievous crime. You will please to remain here for the  present. It may be that, when the person accused of this crime appears  before us, you may be able to recognize his figure.\"    It was with mixed feelings that Francis heard, a minute or two later,  the usher announce that Signor Ruggiero Mocenigo was without, awaiting  the pleasure of their excellencies.    \"Let him enter,\" the doge said.    The curtains fell back, and Ruggiero Mocenigo entered with a haughty  air. He bowed to the council, and stood as if expecting to be  questioned.    \"You are charged, Ruggiero Mocenigo,\" the doge said, \"with being  concerned in an attempt to carry off the daughters of Signor Polani,  and of taking part in the killing of three servitors of that  gentleman.\"    \"On what grounds am I accused?\" Ruggiero said haughtily.    \"On the ground that you are a rejected suitor for the elder lady's  hand, and that you had uttered threats against her father, who, so far  as he knows, has no other enemies.\"    \"This seems somewhat scanty ground for an accusation of such gravity,\"  Ruggiero said sneeringly. \"If every suitor who grumbles, when his offer  is refused, is to be held responsible for every accident which may take  place in the lady's family, methinks that the time of this reverend and  illustrious council will be largely occupied.\"    \"You will remember,\" the doge said sternly, \"that your previous conduct  gives good ground for suspicion against you. You have already been  banished from the state for two years for assassination, and such  reports as reached us of your conduct in Constantinople, during your  exile, were the reverse of satisfactory. Had it not been so, the  prayers of your friends, that your term of banishment might be  shortened, would doubtless have produced their effect.\"    \"At any rate,\" Ruggiero said, \"I can, with little difficulty, prove  that I had no hand in any attempt upon Signor Polani's daughters last  night, seeing that I had friends spending the evening with me, and that  we indulged in play until three o'clock this morning--an hour at which,  I should imagine, the Signoras Polani would scarcely be abroad.\"    \"At what time did your friends assemble?\"    \"At nine o'clock,\" Ruggiero said. \"We met by agreement in the Piazza,  somewhat before that hour, and proceeded together on foot to my house.\"    \"Who were your companions?\"    Ruggiero gave the names of six young men, all connections of his  family, and summonses were immediately sent for them to attend before  the council.    \"In the meantime, Messer Francisco Hammond, you can tell us whether you  recognize in the accused one of the assailants last night.\"    \"I cannot recognize him, your excellency,\" Francis said; \"but I can say  certainly that he was not the leader of the party, whom I struck with  my oar. The blow fell on the temple, and assuredly there would be marks  of such a blow remaining today.\"    As Francis was speaking, Ruggiero looked at him with a cold piercing  glance, which expressed the reverse of gratitude for the evidence which  he was giving in his favour, and something like a chill ran through him  as he resumed his seat behind Signor Polani and his friends.    There was silence for a quarter of an hour. Occasionally the members of  the council spoke in low tones to each other, but no word was spoken  aloud, until the appearance of the first of the young men who had been  summoned. One after another they gave their evidence, and all were  unanimous in declaring that they had spent the evening with Ruggiero  Mocenigo, and that he did not leave the room, from the moment of his  arrival there soon after nine o'clock, until they left him at two in  the morning.    \"You have heard my witnesses,\" Ruggiero said, when the last had given  his testimony; \"and I now ask your excellencies, whether it is right  that a gentleman, of good family, should be exposed to a villainous  accusation of this kind, on the barest grounds of suspicion?\"    \"You have heard the evidence which has been given, Signor Polani,\" the  doge said. \"Do you withdraw your accusation against Signor Mocenigo?\"    \"I acknowledge, your excellency,\" Signor Polani said, rising, \"that  Ruggiero Mocenigo has proved that he took no personal part in the  affair, but I will submit to you that this in no way proves that he is  not the author of the attempt. He would know that my first suspicion  would fall upon him, and would, therefore, naturally leave the matter  to be carried out by others, and would take precautions to enable him  to prove, as he has done, that he was not present. I still maintain  that the circumstances of the case, his threats to me, and the fact  that my daughter will naturally inherit a portion of what wealth I  might possess, and that, as I know and can prove, Ruggiero Mocenigo has  been lately reduced to borrowing money of the Jews, all point to his  being the author of this attempt, which would at once satisfy his anger  against me, for having declined the honour of his alliance, and repair  his damaged fortunes.\"    There were a few words of whispered consultation between the  councillors, and the doge then said:    \"All present will now retire while the council deliberates. Our  decision will be made known to the parties concerned, in due time.\"    On leaving the palace, Signor Polani and his friends walked together  across the Piazza, discussing the turn of events.    \"He will escape,\" Polani said. \"He has two near relations on the  council, and however strong our suspicions may be, there is really no  proof against him. I fear that he will go free. I feel as certain as  ever that he is the contriver of the attempt; but the precautions he  has taken seem to render it impossible to bring the crime home to him.  However, it is no use talking about it any more, at present.    \"You will, I hope, accompany me home, Signor Francisco, and allow me to  present you formally to my daughters. They were too much agitated, last  night, to be able to thank you fully for the service you had rendered  them.    \"Matteo, do you come with us.\"    Three days passed, and no decision of the council had been announced,  when, early in the morning, one of the state messengers brought an  order that Francis should be in readiness, at nine o'clock, to  accompany him. At that hour a gondola drew up at the steps. It was a  covered gondola, with hangings, which prevented any from seeing who  were within. Francis took his seat by the side of the official, and the  gondola started at once.    \"It looks very much as if I was being taken as a prisoner,\" Francis  said to himself. \"However, that can hardly be, for even if Ruggiero  convinced the council that he was wholly innocent of this affair, no  blame could fall on me, for I neither accused nor identified him.  However, it is certainly towards the prisons we are going.\"    The boat, indeed, was passing the Piazzetta without stopping, and  turned down the canal behind, to the prisons in rear of the palace.  They stopped at the water gate, close to the Bridge of Sighs, and  Francis and his conductor entered. They proceeded along two or three  passages, until they came to a door where an official was standing. A  word was spoken, and they passed in.    The chamber they entered was bare and vaulted, and contained no  furniture whatever, but at one end was a low stone slab, upon which  something was lying covered with a cloak. Four of the members of the  council were standing in a group, talking, when Francis entered. Signor  Polani, with two of his friends, stood apart at one side of the  chamber. Ruggiero Mocenigo also, with two of his companions, stood on  the other side.    Francis thought that the demeanour of Ruggiero was somewhat altered  from that which he had assumed at the previous investigation, and that  he looked sullen and anxious.    \"We have sent for you, Francisco Hammond, in order that you may, if you  can, identify a body which was found last night, floating in the Grand  Canal.\"    One of the officials stepped forward and removed the cloak, showing on  the stone slab the body of a young man. On the left temple there was an  extensive bruise, and the skin was broken.    \"Do you recognize that body?\"    \"I do not recognize the face,\" Francis said, \"and do not know that I  ever saw it before.\"    \"The wound upon the temple which you see, is it such as, you would  suppose, would be caused by the blow you struck an unknown person,  while he was engaged in attacking the gondola of Signor Polani?\"    \"I cannot say whether it is such a wound as would be caused by a blow  with an oar,\" Francis said; \"but it is certainly, as nearly as  possible, on the spot where I struck the man, just as he was leaping,  sword in hand, into my gondola.\"    \"You stated, at your examination the other day, that it was on the left  temple you struck the blow.\"    \"I did so. I said at once that Signor Ruggiero Mocenigo could not have  been the man who led the assailants, because had he been so he would  assuredly have borne a mark from the blow on the left temple.\"    \"Look at the clothes. Do you see anything there which "]]]
