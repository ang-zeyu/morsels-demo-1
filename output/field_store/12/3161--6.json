This pool  Sennacherib filled up, and regulated the course of the stream, providing  against the recurrence of such-accidents in future by building a  substructure of masonry, 454 cubits long by 289 wide, formed of large  blocks of stone cemented together by bitumen. On this he erected a  magnificent palace, a Bit-Khilani in the Syrian style, with woodwork of  fragrant cedar and cypress overlaid with gold and silver, panellings  of sculptured marble and alabaster, and friezes and cornices in glazed  tiles of brilliant colouring: inspired by the goddess Nin-kurra, he  caused winged bulls of white alabaster and limestone statues of the gods  to be hewn in the quarries of Balad near Nineveh. He presided in person  at all these operations--at the raising of the soil, the making of the  substructures of the terrace, the transport of the colossal statues or  blocks and their subsequent erection; indeed, he was to be seen at every  turn, standing in Ids ebony and ivory chariot, drawn by a team of men.  When the building was finished, he was so delighted with its beauty that  he named it \"the incomparable palace,\" and his admiration was shared  by his contemporaries; they were never wearied of extolling in glowing  terms the twelve bronze lions, the twelve winged bulls, and the  twenty-four statues of goddesses which kept watch over the entrance,  and for the construction of which a new method of rapid casting had been  invented.    [Illustration: 065.jpg KING SENNACHERIB WATCHING THE TRANSPORT OF A  COLOSSAL STATUE]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Layard.    Formerly the erection of such edifices cost much in suffering to  the artificers employed on them, but Sennacherib brought his great  enterprise to a prompt completion without extravagant outlay or  unnecessary hardship inflicted on his workmen. He proceeded to annex  the neighbouring quarters of the city, relegating the inhabitants to the  suburbs while he laid out a great park on the land thus cleared; this  park was well planted with trees, like the heights of Amanus, and in  it flourished side by side all the forest growths indigenousnto the  Cilician mountains and the plains of Chaldaea. A lake, fed by a canal  leading from the Khuzur, supplied it with water, which was conducted in  streams and rills through the thickets, keeping them always fresh and  green. Vines trained on trellises afforded a grateful shade during the  sultry hours of the day; birds sang in the branches, herds of wild boar  and deer roamed through the coverts, in order that the prince might  enjoy the pleasures of the chase without quitting his own private  grounds.    [Illustration: 066.jpg ASSYRIAN BAS-RELIEFS AT BAVIAN]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a sketch in Layard.    The main part of these constructions was finished about 700 B.C., but  many details were left incomplete, and the work was still proceeding  after the court had long been in residence on the spot. Meanwhile a  smaller palace, as well as barracks and a depot for arms and provisions,  sprang up elsewhere. Eighteen aqueducts, carried across the country,  brought the water from the Muzri to the Khuzur, and secured an adequate  supply to the city; the Ninevites, who had hitherto relied upon  rain-water for the replenishing of their cisterns, awoke one day to  find themselves released from all anxiety on this score. An ancient and  semi-subterranean canal, which Assur-nazir-pal had constructed nearly  two centuries before, but which, owing to the neglect of his successors,  had become choked up, was cleaned out, enlarged and repaired, and made  capable of bringing water to their doors from the springs of Mount Tas,  in the same year as that in which the battle of Khalule took place.* At  a later date, magnificent bas-reliefs, carved on the rock by order of  Esar-haddon, representing winged bulls, figures of the gods and of the  king, with explanatory inscriptions, marked the site of the springs,  and formed a kind of monumental facade to the ravine in which they took  their rise.**         * Mount Tas is the group of hills enclosing the ravine of       Bavian. These works were described in the Bavian       inscription, of which they occupy the whole of the first       part.         ** The Bavian text speaks of six inscriptions and statues       which the king had engraved on the Mount of Tas, at the       source of the stream.    It would be hard to account for the rapidity with which these great  works were completed, did one not remember that Sargon had previously  carried out extensive architectural schemes, in which he must have  employed all the available artists in his empire. The revolutions which  had shattered the realm under the last descendants of Assur-nazir-pal,  and the consequent impoverishment of the kingdom, had not been without a  disastrous effect on the schools of Assyrian sculpture.    [ Illustration: 068.jpg UNKNOWN SUBJECTS FROM THE FIFTH TOMB]    [Illustration: 069.jpg GREAT ASSYRIAN STELE AT BAVIAIT.]         Drawn by Boudior, from Layard.    Since the royal treasury alone was able to bear the expense of those  vast compositions in which the artistic skill of the period could have  free play, the closing of the royal workshops, owing to the misfortunes  of the time, had the immediate effect of emptying the sculptors'  studios. Even though the period of depression lasted for the space of  two or three generations only, it became difficult to obtain artistic  workmen; and those who were not discouraged from the pursuit of art by  the uncertainty of employment, no longer possessed the high degree of  skill attained by their predecessors, owing to lack of opportunity to  cultivate it. Sculpture was at a very low ebb when Tiglath-pileser  III. desired to emulate the royal builders of days gone by, and the  awkwardness of composition noticeable in some of his bas-reliefs, and  the almost barbaric style of the stelae erected by persons of even so  high a rank as Belharran-beluzur, prove the lamentable deficiency of  good artists at that epoch, and show that the king had no choice but to  employ all the surviving members of the ancient guilds, whether good,  bad, or indifferent workmen. The increased demand, however, soon  produced an adequate supply of workers, and when Sargon ascended the  throne, the royal guild of sculptors had been thoroughly reconstituted;  the inefficient workmen on whom Tiglath-pileser and Shalmaneser had been  obliged to rely had been eliminated in course of time, and many of the  sculptures which adorned the palace at Khorsabad display a purity of  design and boldness of execution comparable to that of the best Egyptian  art. The composition still shows traces of Chaldaean stiffness, and  the exaggerated drawing of the muscles produces an occasionally  unpleasing-heaviness of outline, but none the less the work as a whole  constitutes one of the richest and most ingenious schemes of decoration  ever devised, which, while its colouring was still perfect, must have  equalled in splendour the great triumphal battle-scenes at Ibsambul or  Medinet-Habu. Sennacherib found ready to his hand a body of well-trained  artists, whose number had considerably increased during the reign of  Sargon, and he profited by the experience which they had acquired and  the talent that many of them had developed. What immediately strikes the  spectator in the series of pictures produced under his auspices, is the  great skill with which his artists covered the whole surface at their  disposal without overcrowding it. They no longer treated their subject,  whether it were a warlike expedition, a hunting excursion, a sacrificial  scene, or an episode of domestic life, as a simple juxtaposition of  groups of almost equal importance ranged at the same elevation along  the walls, the subject of each bas-relief being complete in itself and  without any necessary connection with its neighbour. They now selected  two or three principal incidents from the subjects proposed to them for  representation, and round these they grouped such of the less important  episodes as lent themselves best to picturesque treatment, and scattered  sparingly over the rest of the field the minor accessories which seemed  suitable to indicate more precisely the scene of the action. Under the  auspices of this later school, Assyrian foot-soldiers are no longer  depicted attacking the barbarians of Media or Elam on backgrounds of  smooth stone, where no line marks the various levels, and where the  remoter figures appear to be walking in the air without anything to  support them. If the battle represented took place on a wooded slope  crowned by a stronghold on the summit of the hill, the artist, in order  to give an impression of the surroundings, covered his background with  guilloche patterns by which to represent the rugged surface of the  mountains; he placed here and there groups of various kinds of trees,  especially the straight cypresses and firs which grew upon the slopes of  the Iranian table-land: or he represented a body of lancers galloping in  single file along the narrow woodland paths, and hastening to surprise  a distant enemy, or again foot-soldiers chasing their foes through the  forest or engaging them in single combat; while in the corners of the  picture the wounded are being stabbed or otherwise despatched, fugitives  are trying to escape through the undergrowth, and shepherds are pleading  with the victors for their lives. It is the actual scene the sculptor  sets himself to depict, and one is sometimes inclined to ask, while  noting the precision with which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17329"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 9 (of 12) (#11)"],[1,"party seems to have been  Sadyattes, the banker from whom Croesus had endeavoured to borrow money  at the beginning of his career, but several of the Lydian nobles, whose  exercise of feudal rights had been restricted by the growing authority  of the Mermnado, either secretly or openly gave their adhesion to  Pantaleon, among them being Glaucias of Sidene; the Greek cities, always  ready to chafe at authority, were naturally inclined to support a  claimant born of a Greek mother, and Pindarus the tyrant of Ephesus, and  grandson of the Melas who had married the daughter of Gyges, joined the  conspirators.         * Lenormant ascribed an issue of coins without inscriptions       to the kings Ardys, Sadyattes, and Alyattes, but this has       since been believed not to have been their work.         ** Herodotus mentions the statue of the bread-maker, giving       no reason why Crosus dedicated it. The author quoted by       Plutarch would have it that in revenge he made his half-       brothers eat the poisoned bread.    [Illustration: 059.jpg VIEW OF THE SITE AND RUINS OF EPHESUS]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph.    As soon as Alyattes was dead, Crosus, who was kept informed by his spies  of their plans, took action with a rapidity which disconcerted his  adversaries. It is not known what became of Pantaleon, whether he was  executed or fled the country, but his friends were tortured to death or  had to purchase their pardon dearly. Sadyattes was stretched on a rack  and torn with carding combs.* Glaucias, besieged in his fortress of  Sidene, opened its gates after a desperate resistance; the king  demolished the walls, and pronounced a solemn curse on those who should  thereafter rebuild them. Pindarus, summoned to surrender, refused, but  as he had not sufficient troops to defend the entire city, he evacuated  the lower quarters, and concentrated all his forces on the defence of  the citadel; he refused to open negotiations until after the fall of a  tower at the moment when a practicable breach had been made, and  succeeded in obtaining an honourable capitulation for himself and his  people by a ruse.         * The history of Sadyattes and of his part in the conspiracy       results from points of agreement which have been established       between various passages in Herodotus and in Nicolas of       Damascus, where the person is sometimes named and sometimes       not.    He dedicated the town to Artemis, and by means of a rope connected  the city walls with the temple, which stood nearly a mile away in  the suburbs, and then entreated for peace in the name of the goddess.  Croesus was amused at the artifice, and granted favourable conditions to  the inhabitants, but insisted on the expulsion of the tyrant. The latter  bowed before the decree, and confiding the care of his children and  possessions to his friend Pasicles, left for the Peloponnesus with his  retinue. Bphesus up to this time had been a kind of allied principality,  whose chiefs, united to the royal family of Lydia by marriages from  generation to generation, recognised the nominal suzerainty of the  reigning king rather than his effective authority. It was in fact  a species of protectorate, which, while furthering the commercial  interests of Lydia, satisfied at the same time the passion of the Greek  cities for autonomy. Croesus, encouraged by his first success, could  not rest contented with such a compromise. He attacked, successively,  Miletus and the various Ionian, AEolian, and Dorian communities of  the littoral, and brought them all under his sway, promising on their  capitulation that their local constitutions should be respected if they  became direct dependencies of his empire. He placed garrisons in such  towns as were strategically important for him to occupy, but everywhere  else he razed to the ground the fortresses and ramparts which might  afford protection to his enemies in case of rebellion, compelling the  inhabitants to take up their abode on the open plain where they could  not readily defend themselves.* The administration of the affairs of  each city was entrusted to either a wealthy citizen, or an hereditary  tyrant, or an elected magistrate, who was held responsible for its  loyalty; the administrator paid over the tribute to the sovereign's  treasurers, levied the specified contingent and took command of it in  time of war, settled any quarrels which might occur, and was empowered,  when necessary, to exile turbulent and ambitious persons whose words  or actions appeared to him to be suspicious. Croesus treated with  generosity those republics which tendered him loyal obedience, and  affected a special devotion to their gods. He gave a large number of  ex-voto offerings to the much-revered sanctuary of Bran-chidse, in the  territory of Miletus; he dedicated some golden heifers at the Artemision  of Ephesus, and erected the greater number of the columns of that temple  at his own expense.**         * He treated thus the Ephesians and the Ilians.         ** The fragments of columns brought from this temple by Wood       and preserved in the British Museum have on one of the bases       the remains of an inscription confirming the testimony of       Herodotus.    At one time in his career he appears to have contemplated extending his  dominion over the Greek islands, and planned, as was said, the equipment  of a fleet, but he soon acknowledged the imprudence of such a project,  and confined his efforts to strengthening his advantageous position on  the littoral by contracting alliances with the island populations and  with the nations of Greece proper.*         * He seems to have been deterred from his project by a       sarcastic remark made, as some say, by Pittakos the       Mitylenian, or according to others, by Bias of Priene.    Following the diplomacy of his ancestors, he began by devoting himself  to the gods of the country, and took every pains to gain the good graces  of Apollo of Delphi. He dispensed his gifts with such liberality that  neither his contemporaries nor subsequent generations grew weary  of admiring it. On one occasion he is said to have sacrificed three  thousand animals, and burnt, moreover, on the pyre the costly contents  of a palace--couches covered with silver and gold, coverlets and robes  of purple, and golden vials. His subjects were commanded to contribute  to the offering, and he caused one hundred and seventeen hollow  half-bricks to be cast of the gold which they brought him for this  purpose. These bricks were placed in regular layers within the treasury  at Delphi where the gifts of Lydia from the time of Alyattes were  deposited, and the top of the pile was surmounted by a lion of fine  gold of such a size that the pedestal and statue together were worth  L1,200,000 of our present money. These, however, formed only a tithe of  his gifts; many of the objects dedicated by him were dispersed half a  century (548 B.C.) later when the temple was burnt, and found their  way into the treasuries of the Greek states which enjoyed the favour  of Apollo--among them being an enormous gold cup sent to Clazomeme, and  four barrels of silver and two bowls, one of silver and one of gold,  sent to the Corinthians. The people at Delphi, as well as their god,  participated in the royal largesse, and Croesus distributed to them  the sum of two staters per head. No doubt their gratitude led them by  degrees to exaggerate the total of the benefits showered upon them,  especially as time went on and their recollection of the king became  fainter; but even when we reduce the number of the many gifts which  they attributed to him, we are still obliged to acknowledge that they  surpassed anything hitherto recorded, and that they produced throughout  the whole of Greece the effect that Croesus had desired. The oracle  granted to him and to the Lydians the rights of citizenship in  perpetuity, the privilege of priority in consulting it before all  comers, precedence for his legates over other foreign embassies, and a  place of honour at the games and at all religious ceremonies. It was,  in fact, the admission of Lydia into the Hellenic concert, and the  offerings which Croesus showered upon the sanctuaries of lesser  fame--that of Zeus at Dodona, of Amphiaraos at Oropos, of Trophonios at  Lebadsea, on the oracle of Abee in Phocis, and on the Ismenian Apollo  at Thebes--secured a general approval of the act. Political alliances  contracted with the great families of Athens, the Alcmonidae and  Eupatridae,* with the Cypselidae of, Corinth,** and with the Heraclidae of  Sparta,*** completed the policy of bribery which Croesus had inaugurated  in the sacerdotal republics, with the result that, towards 548, being in  the position of uncontested patron of the Greeks of Asia, he could count  upon the sympathetic neutrality of the majority of their compatriots in  Europe, and on the effective support of a smaller number of them in  the event of his being forced into hostilities with one or other of his  Asiatic rivals.         * Traditions as to Crcesus' relations with Alcrnseon are       preserved by Herodotus. The king compelled the inhabitants of       Lampsacus, his vassals, to release the elder Miltiades, whom       they had taken prisoner, and thus earned the gratitude of       the Eupatridae.         ** Alyattes had been the ally of Periander, as is proved by       an anecdote in Herodotus. This friendship continued under       Crosus, for after the fall of the monarchy, when the special       treasuries of Lydia were suppressed, the ex-voto offerings       of the Lydian kings were deposited in the treasury of       Corinth.         *** According to Theopompus, the Lacedaemonians, wishing to       gild the face of the statue of the Amyclsean, Apollo, and       finding no gold in Greece, consulted the Delphian       prophetess: by her advice they sent to Lydia to buy the       precious"]]]
