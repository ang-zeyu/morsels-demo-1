We used to catch  locusts in a big zinc box pulled by two horses; the locusts were put  into sacks, and after being left standing for four days, were carted to  the village, where he got 10 cents a kilo. The smell in carting these  dead locusts was simply terrible. Then I helped pick ten square of  maize, which at first took a little skin off my hands. At branding time  we lassoed each calf to cut off the horns. I had to sit on their necks,  and got smothered in the face with hot blood. The Boss was very proud  because his monthly account only came to $12 for four of us: biscuits,  sugar, tea, and other things. He sent his clothes once in three months  to be washed. He had few friends, no one ever came to visit him, and  every Sunday he shut himself in his room. He bought the place for  $90,000 and sold it for over double. He was a thorough campman, but so  mean. One cold winter 500 cows died of starvation; rather than sell them  at a low price he let them starve. The last thing he said was, he was  \"going to New Zealand to marry an ugly lady, but she has plenty of  money.\" His countrymen called him a disgrace to his country and the  meanest in the Argentine.    Then a kind friend found me a place on a well-known estancia in the same  province. The manager, the second-manager, and the book-keeper were all  Irish, born in the country. I had a good horse, which I rode fifty miles  to the estancia.    The second told me to have my food with the peons (men), which was  rather disheartening. I tried to eat in the kitchen, but the French cook  kicked me out, and for ten months I fed with the peons; they were very  good fellows. The second and the book-keeper had meals together. The  second-manager did no work: up at half-past eight, he went to the train,  had a drink at the shop, then came back for dinner, slept until  tea-time, then went to see the train pass again and have another drink,  and came back at all hours. He had been there fourteen years and was  only getting a hundred a month.    The chief work was loading cattle and sheep for the big freezing  factories. The trucks were rotten. One night we finished at 11 p.m.,  after a hard day's work, three of us unloaded 300 quebracho posts in  under three hours. I had a French gardener in my room who did nothing  else but spit and talk politics.    The Boss took me to learn shearing. I had to shear, gather the wool,  sort it and pack it up. Each man got five cents a sheep, but it was hard  work, all done by hand.    Then I cut alfalfa for a fortnight--a nice easy job.    A Catholic priest came to stay for eight days--Mass every day at 7 a.m.  and 8 p.m., sometimes three a day. No work at all. Everyone had to  go--the book-keeper did not, so he got the sack. I, as a Protestant,  went to the sermons, which were very good. It was wonderful; these rough  campmen went away quite tamed for a time. The last night the Boss got  married at half-past twelve at night to a native lady. Another time,  while we were at Mass, someone came to say the gardener was dying--we  raced down, the priest in front ready to hear his confession, but when  we got there the gardener was calmly smoking his pipe, greatly  surprised.    An inspector of locusts stopped all the summer. He did nothing but eat,  sleep, and drink whisky. We had locust-killing machines of every  description, but we did not kill ten kilos.    The days I enjoyed were when we started out early to part some animals  in a herd of over a thousand. At eleven we would have an asado and mate,  and give our horses a drink, then finish parting, and get home at  half-past seven. The horses look wrecks, and no good, but they work all  day--mostly galloping--and are splendid stayers.    The Boss's brother, a very nice man of fifty, married a servant of the  Boss, a girl of eighteen.    Great excitement is caused by races. The Boss was keen, and the men  talked of nothing else for days. Every Sunday there are races. Once I  rode my horse bareback in three races of 200 metres, and won a bottle of  beer, a packet of tobacco, and a knife.    Then I was put in charge of fine stock. I had ten Durham bulls, two  thoroughbred stallions, one Pecheron, eight rams and twelve pigs. I had  a boy under me. I also had to saddle up the Boss's and the Second's  horses, and harness the traps. Sometimes I had to wait till eleven at  night, very tired, to unsaddle the Second's horse, as he had been making  love to the Stationmaster's sister.    The work was very interesting and hard, even on Sundays or feast days,  watering, cleaning the animals, and curing any foals that were ill.    I then moved to another room near the stable, with a newly arrived  Italian who knew no Spanish nor English, also an Irishman just arrived.  They could not speak to each other. The Irishman slept on the floor  every night, and poured kerosene all over him to keep insects away. One  day he poisoned five pigs, giving them the dip-water to drink. He had  few clothes. He would turn them inside out, and often had three pairs of  trousers and two shirts on.    One day the Boss was out: the men were taming some wild colts in the  corral. I took French leave and went. I got on five. None had had a  saddle on before or even been handled. We lassoed them, pulled them down  and put on the bridle. Then five men held a long rope and one put on the  native saddle, with stirrups big enough to get your toes in. Then they  tied a red handkerchief round my head. I mounted gently but quickly.  Then the rope was taken off and away the colt went as fast as possible,  with one man on each side to shove you either way, all the time bucking  and plunging. I did not fall, but one stirrup broke. One laid down and  would not move. It tried to bite everyone. When they go fast and buck at  the same time it is very hard to stick on.    On the 25th of May, the great holiday in this country, I went to an  estancia to see some friends. On my way back we had to cross a deep  river. The coachman drove across, but one wheel went into a big hole and  the jerk sent me out on my head, where the wheel passed over my hair,  missing my head by inches. I was senseless. A crowd of women came and  began weeping--they thought I was dead--then I was taken in a procession  to the chemist, who sent me to a hospital, where I found my collar bone  broken. I did nothing for three weeks.    This estancia is a splendid one for learners, because there is a little  of everything. Once I had a month with the threshing machine, sleeping  out with the mosquitoes, and getting meat nearly raw for food; but a lot  of money can be made from the harvest.    Then, after a few weeks' holiday to England, we came back, and I went  down south with my brother to sow alfalfa seed. We had a caravan on  wheels, and learned how to plough and sow. We went to a camp  race-meeting, where every estancia has its own tent, there is racing all  day and dancing at night.    I often look back upon these jolly times. Work was exacted with anything  but kindness, but the life was simple and very healthy, and many  pleasant reminiscences are talked over when it is my luck to join others  around the camp fire before falling to sleep with nothing but a  bullock's head as a pillow and a \"recado\" as a blanket and the glorious,  starry sky above one.          THE SOCIAL SIDE OF CAMP LIFE.      To an outsider, life in the camps or country might be considered very  slow: the distance between the estancias being so great, the ordinary  form of social life is quite impossible; for instance, when one goes to  pay a call on a neighbour, even a first call, it means going for the  day, starting in the cool of the morning and returning in the evening,  and so allowing the horses to have a rest. Of course, if everyone had a  motor-car, this might not be necessary; but as yet they are very few and  far between. This is no doubt owing to the bad roads; in most districts,  after a few hours' rain, the roads are flooded, and what is worse still,  \"pantanosa\" (thick, sticky mud).    Most estancieros keep open house, and are only too pleased when people  \"drop in,\" which they do at all times and for any meal, almost without a  \"by your leave.\" An estancia house has to be very elastic, and ready to  provide, at a moment's notice, board and lodging for unexpected guests.  This is quite the nicest way of entertaining one's friends--no fuss of  preparation, and, more often than not, a very jolly evening of cards,  music, or games.    It is a delightful country for men, a healthy, open-air life, with  plenty of hard work and hard riding; each man has from four to six  horses allowed him for working purposes, and then, as a rule (talking of  the English mayor-domo), he has two or three polo ponies of his own.  Sunday is the great day for polo; there is very little time in our busy  Argentine even for a practice game during the week, so Sunday means a  merry meeting of friends wherever there is a polo club in the district,  people going in six or seven leagues (or even more) from one side of  the town to meet friends who have come an equal distance from the other  side, a thing they might not do for months if it were not for the polo  club. Each lady takes her turn in providing tea on these polo Sundays,  and there is great competition as to who makes the best cakes,  especially as it often falls to the lady herself to make these luxuries.    Wherever there is a polo club the most exciting event of the year is the  Spring Race Meeting, two days' racing, often followed by a polo match or  tournament with neighbouring clubs, and always as many dances as  possible, as it is the only time in the year when enough girls can be  collected together; every estancia house has its own party, as many as  can be crowded in, including friends from Buenos Aires and Rosario, who  delight in these camp meetings, and she is a proud"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14368"],[0,"Hebraic Literature; Translations from the Talmud, Midrashim and Kabbala (#11)"],[1," or a man pass between two women. The compiler of      this Miscellany was once witness to a case which illustrates its      inconvenience: it occurred at Tiberias. A pious young Jew who      had to traverse a narrow road to pass from the lake to the town      was kept standing for a very considerable time under a broiling      sun, simply because two young women, to tease him, guarded the      entrance, and dared him to pass between them. Of course he dared      not accept the challenge, otherwise he would have incurred the      penalty of death, according to the judgment of the Talmud; for      \"Whosoever transgresses any of the words of the Scribes is      guilty of death.\" (_Eiruvin_, fol. 21, col. 2.)    These three will inherit the world to come:--He who dwells in the land  of Israel; he who brings up his sons to the study of the law; and he who  repeats the ritual blessing over the appointed cup of wine at the close  of the Sabbath.    _P'sachim_, fol. 113, col. 1.    There are three whom the Holy One--blessed be He!--Himself proclaims  virtuous:--The unmarried man who lives in a city and does not sin; the  poor man who restores a lost thing which he has found to its owner; and  the rich man who pays the tithes of his increase unostentatiously. Rav  Saphra was a bachelor, and he dwelt in a large city. A disciple of the  wise once descanted upon the merits of a celibate life in the presence  of Rava and this Rav Saphra, and the face of the latter beamed with  delight. Remarking which, Rava said to him, \"This does not refer to such  a bachelor as thou art, but to such as Rabbi Chanena and Rabbi Oshaia.\"  They were single men, who followed the trade of shoemakers, and dwelt in  a street mostly occupied by _meretrices_, for whom they made shoes; but  when they fitted these on, they never raised their eyes to look at their  faces. For this the women conceived such a respect for them, that when  they swore, they swore by the life of the holy Rabbis of the land of  Israel.    _Psachim_, fol. 113, cols, 1, 2.    There are three whom the Holy One--blessed be He!--abhorreth: He who  says one thing but thinks another; he who might bear witness in favor of  his neighbor but refrains from doing so; and he who, having seen his  neighbor act disgracefully, goes and appears singly as a witness against  him (thus only condemning, but not convicting, him, as the law requires  two witnesses). As, for example, when Toviah transgressed and Zigud  appeared against him singly before Rav Pappa, and Rav Pappa ordered this  witness to receive forty stripes save one in return. \"What!\" said he,  \"Toviah has sinned, and should Zigud be flogged?\" \"Yes,\" replied the  Rabbi, \"for by testifying singly against him thou bringest him only into  bad repute.\" (See Deut. xix. 15.)    _P'sachim_ fol. 113, col. 2.        \"Toviah has sinned and Zigud is flogged,\" has long been a      proverb among Jews.    There are three whose life is no life:--The sympathetic, the irascible,  and the melancholy.    _P'sachim_, fol. 113, col. 2.    There are three which despise their fellows:--Dogs, cocks, and  sorcerers. Some say strange women also, and some the disciples of the  Babylonian Rabbis.    Ibid.    These three love their fellows:--Proselytes, slaves, and ravens.    Ibid.    These three are apt to strut:--Israel among the nations, the dog among  animals, the cock among birds. Some say also the goat among small  cattle, and some the caper shrub among trees.    Ibid., fol. 25, col. 2.    There are three whose life is no life:--He who lives at another's table;  he whose wife domineers over him; and he who suffers bodily affliction.  Some say also he who has only a single shirt in his wardrobe.    Ibid., fol. 32, col. 2.    Three things are said respecting the finger-nails:--He who trims his  nails and buries the parings is a pious man; he who burns these is a  righteous man; but he who throws them away is a wicked man, for  mischance might follow, should a female step over them.    _Moed Katan_, fol. 18, col. 1.        The orthodox Jews in Poland are to this day careful to bury away      or burn their nail parings.    Three classes appear on the day of judgment:--The perfectly righteous,  who are at once written and sealed for eternal life; the thoroughly bad,  who are at once written and sealed for hell; as it is written (Dan. xii.  2), \"And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake,  some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt;\"  and those in the intermediate state, who go down into hell, where they  cry and howl for a time, whence they ascend again; as it is written  (Zech. xiii. 9), \"And I will bring the third part through the fire, and  will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is  tried; they shall call on my name, and I will hear them.\" It is of them  Hannah said (1 Sam. ii. 6), \"The Lord killeth and maketh alive; He  bringeth down to hell and bringeth up.\"    _Rosh Hashanah_, fol. 16, col. 2.    Our Rabbis have taught that there are three voices which can be heard  from one end of the world to the other:--The sound emitted from the  sphere of the sun; the hum and din of the city of Rome; and the voice of  anguish uttered by the soul as it quits the body; ... but our Rabbis  prayed that the soul might be spared this torture, and therefore the  voice of its terrors has not since been heard.    _Yoma_, fol. 20, col. 2.    In three particulars is benevolence superior to almsgiving:--Almsgiving  is only the bestowment of money, but benevolence can be exercised by  personal service as well. Alms can be given only to the poor, but  benevolence can be shown no less to the rich. Alms are confined to the  living, but benevolence may extend to both the dead and the living.    _Succah_, fol. 49, col. 2.    Three marks characterize the nation of Israel:--They are compassionate,  they are modest, and they are benevolent. Compassionate, as it is  written (Deut. xiii. 18), \"And show thee mercy, and have compassion upon  thee, and multiply thee.\" Modest, as it is written (Exod. xx. 20), \"That  his fear may be before your faces.\" Benevolent, as it is written (Gen.  xviii. 19), \"For I know him,\" etc.    _Yevamoth_, fol. 79, col. 1.    Dates are good after meals in the morning and in the evening, but  hurtful in the afternoon; on the other hand, at noon they are most  excellent, and an antidote to these three maladies:--Evil thought,  constipation, and hemorrhoids.    _Kethuboth_, fol. 10, col. 2.    Beware of these three things:--Do not sit too much, for it brings on  hemorrhoids; do not stand too much, for it is bad for the heart; do not  walk too much, for it is hurtful to the eyes. But sit a third, stand a  third, and walk a third.    Ibid., fol. 111, col. 1.    He who holds his household in terror tempts to the commission of three  sins:--Fornication, murder, and Sabbath breaking.    _Gittin_, fol. 6, col. 2.    Three things weaken the strength of man:--Fear, travel, and sin. Fear,  as it is written (Ps. xxxviii. 10), \"My heart palpitates, my strength  faileth me.\" Travel, as it is written (Ps. cii. 23), \"He hath weakened  my strength in the way.\" ... Sin, as it is written (Ps. xxxi. 10), \"My  strength faileth me, because of my iniquity.\"    Ibid., fol. 70, col 2.    Abraham was three years old when he first learned to know his Creator;  as it is said (Gen. xxvi. 5), \"Because Abraham obeyed my voice.\"    _Nedarim_, fol. 32, col. 1.        The conclusion arrived at here is founded on interpreting the      Hebrew letters of the word rendered \"because\" numerically, in      which the value of the letters gives a total of one hundred and      seventy-two; so that the sense of the text is, \"Abraham obeyed      my voice\" one hundred and seventy-two years. Now Abraham died      when he was a hundred and seventy-five, therefore he must have      been only three when he began to serve the Lord.        As Abraham plays so important a part both in the history and the      imagination of the Jewish race, we may quote here a score or so      of the Talmudic traditions regarding him. The traditions, as is      like, contributed quite as much, if not more, to give character      to his descendants as his actual personality and that spirit of      faith which was the central fact in his history. Races and      nations often draw more inspiration from what they fancy about      their ancestry and early history than from what they know; their      fables therefore are often more illuminative than the facts.    Abraham was Ethan the Ezrahite, who is mentioned in Ps. lxxxvii. 1.    _Bava Bathra_, fol. 15, col. 1.    Abraham's mother was Amathlai, the daughter of Karnebo.    _Bava Bathra_, fol. 91, col. 1.    Abraham was the head of a seminary for youth, and kept both laws, the  written and the oral.    _Yoma_, fol. 28, col. 2.    Abraham observed the whole ceremonial law, even before it was given on  Sinai.    _Kiddushin_, fol. 82, col. 1.        From the day Abraham was compelled to leave the idolatrous      worship and country of his fathers, it is reasonable to suppose      that his tent would become a rendezvous for his neighbors who      shrunk like himself from the abominations around them. There,      from his character, by which he recommended himself as the      friend of God, he might very naturally be looked upon as a      religious teacher, and men might gather together to learn from      his lips or profit by his example. Hence, making due allowance      for Eastern hyperbole, the statement of the Book of Jasher      (chap. xxvi. verse 36) is not undeserving of credit, where it is      said that \"Abraham brought all the children of the land to the      service of God, and he taught them the ways of the Lord.\" The      same remark applies to what is said in Targ. Yerushalmi (Gen.      xxi.), that Abraham's guests went not away until \"he had made      them proselytes, and had taught them the way"]]]
