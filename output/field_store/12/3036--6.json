Desnoyers accepted the situation, and in a few days  felt increasing esteem for the new incumbent.    Although they belonged to two unfriendly nations, it didn't matter.  There are good people everywhere, and this Karl was a subordinate worth  considering. He kept his distance from his equals, and was hard and  inflexible toward his inferiors. All his faculties seemed concentrated  in service and admiration for those above him. Scarcely would Madariaga  open his lips before the German's head began nodding in agreement,  anticipating his words. If he said anything funny, his clerk's laugh  would break forth in scandalous roars. With Desnoyers he appeared more  taciturn, working without stopping for hours at a time. As soon as he  saw the manager entering the office he would leap from his seat,  holding himself erect with military precision. He was always ready to  do anything whatever. Unasked, he spied on the workmen, reporting their  carelessness and mistakes. This last service did not especially please  his superior officer, but he appreciated it as a sign of interest in the  establishment.    The old man bragged triumphantly of the new acquisition, urging his  son-in-law also to rejoice.    \"A very useful fellow, isn't he? . . . These gringoes from Germany  work well, know a good many things and cost little. Then, too, so  disciplined! so servile! . . . I am sorry to praise him so to you  because you are a Frenchy, and your nation has in them a very powerful  enemy. His people are a hard-shelled race.\"    Desnoyers replied with a shrug of indifference. His country was far  away, and so was Germany. Who knew if they would ever return! . . . They  were both Argentinians now, and ought to interest themselves in present  affairs and not bother about the past.    \"And how little pride they have!\" sneered Madariaga in an ironical tone.  \"Every one of these gringoes when he is a clerk at the Capital sweeps  the shop, prepares the meals, keeps the books, sells to the customers,  works the typewriter, translates four or five languages, and dances  attendance on the proprietor's lady friend, as though she were a grand  senora . . . all for twenty-five dollars a month. Who can compete with  such people! You, Frenchy, you are like me, very serious, and would die  of hunger before passing through certain things. But, mark my words, on  this very account they are going to become a terrible people!\"    After brief reflection, the ranchman added:    \"Perhaps they are not so good as they seem. Just see how they treat  those under them! It may be that they affect this simplicity without  having it, and when they grin at receiving a kick, they are saying  inside, 'Just wait till my turn comes, and I'll give you three!'\"    Then he suddenly seemed to repent of his suspicions.    \"At any rate, this Karl is a poor fellow, a mealy-mouthed simpleton who  the minute I say anything opens his jaws like a fly-catcher. He insists  that he comes of a great family, but who knows anything about these  gringoes? . . . All of us, dead with hunger when we reach America, claim  to be sons of princes.\"    Madariaga had placed himself on a familiar footing with his Teutonic  treasure, not through gratitude as with Desnoyers, but in order to make  him feel his inferiority. He had also introduced him on an equal footing  in his home, but only that he might give piano lessons to his younger  daughter. The Romantica was no longer framing herself in the doorway--in  the gloaming watching the sunset reflections. When Karl had finished his  work in the office, he was now coming to the house and seating himself  beside Elena, who was tinkling away with a persistence worthy of a  better fate. At the end of the hour the German, accompanying himself on  the piano, would sing fragments from Wagner in such a way that it  put Madariaga to sleep in his armchair with his great Paraguay cigar  sticking out of his mouth.    Elena meanwhile was contemplating with increasing interest the singing  gringo. He was not the knight of her dreams awaited by the fair lady. He  was almost a servant, a blond immigrant with reddish hair, fat, heavy,  and with bovine eyes that reflected an eternal fear of disagreeing  with his chiefs. But day by day, she was finding in him something which  rather modified these impressions--his feminine fairness, except  where he was burned by the sun, the increasingly martial aspect of his  moustachios, the agility with which he mounted his horse, his air of a  troubadour, intoning with a rather weak tenor voluptuous romances whose  words she did not understand.    One night, just before supper, the impressionable girl announced with a  feverish excitement which she could no longer repress that she had made  a grand discovery.    \"Papa, Karl is of noble birth! He belongs to a great family.\"    The plainsman made a gesture of indifference. Other things were vexing  him in those days. But during the evening, feeling the necessity of  venting on somebody the wrath which had been gnawing at his vitals since  his last trip to Buenos Aires, he interrupted the singer.    \"See here, gringo, what is all this nonsense about nobility which you  have been telling my girl?\"    Karl left the piano that he might draw himself up to the approved  military position before responding. Under the influence of his recent  song, his pose suggested Lohengrin about to reveal the secret of his  life. His father had been General von Hartrott, one of the commanders  in the war of '70. The Emperor had rewarded his services by giving him  a title. One of his uncles was an intimate councillor of the King  of Prussia. His older brothers were conspicuous in the most select  regiments. He had carried a sword as a lieutenant.    Bored with all this grandeur, Madariaga interrupted him. \"Lies . . .  nonsense . . . hot air!\" The very idea of a gringo talking to him about  nobility! . . . He had left Europe when very young in order to cast in  his lot with the revolting democracies of America, and although nobility  now seemed to him something out-of-date and incomprehensible, still  he stoutly maintained that the only true nobility was that of his own  country. He would yield first place to the gringoes for the invention  of machinery and ships, and for breeding priceless animals, but all the  Counts and Marquises of Gringo-land appeared to him to be fictitious  characters.    \"All tomfoolery!\" he blustered. \"There isn't any nobility in your  country, nor have you five dollars all told to rub against each other.  If you had, you wouldn't come over here to play the gallant to women who  are . . . you know what they are as well as I do.\"    To the astonishment of Desnoyers, the German received this onslaught  with much humility, nodding his head in agreement with the Patron's last  words.    \"If there's any truth in all this twaddle about titles,\" continued  Madariaga implacably, \"swords and uniforms, what did you come here for?  What in the devil did you do in your own country that you had to leave  it?\"    Now Karl hung his head, confused and stuttering.    \"Papa, papa,\" pleaded Elena. \"The poor little fellow! How can you  humiliate him so just because he is poor?\"    And she felt a deep gratitude toward her brother-in-law when he broke  through his usual reserve in order to come to the rescue of the German.    \"Oh, yes, of course, he's a good-enough fellow,\" said Madariaga,  excusing himself. \"But he comes from a land that I detest.\"    When Desnoyers made a trip to Buenos Aires a few days afterward, the  cause of the old man's wrath was explained. It appeared that for some  months past Madariaga had been the financial guarantor and devoted swain  of a German prima donna stranded in South America with an Italian opera  company. It was she who had recommended Karl--an unfortunate countryman,  who after wandering through many parts of the continent, was now  living with her as a sort of gentlemanly singer. Madariaga had joyously  expended upon this courtesan many thousands of dollars. A childish  enthusiasm had accompanied him in this novel existence midst urban  dissipations until he happened to discover that his Fraulein was leading  another life during his absence, laughing at him with the parasites of  her retinue; whereupon he arose in his wrath and bade her farewell to  the accompaniment of blows and broken furniture.    The last adventure of his life! . . . Desnoyers suspected his abdication  upon hearing him admit his age, for the first time. He did not intend  to return to the capital. It was all false glitter. Existence in the  country, surrounded by all his family and doing good to the poor was  the only sure thing. And the terrible centaur expressed himself with  the idyllic tenderness and firm virtue of seventy-five years, already  insensible to temptation.    After his scene with Karl, he had increased the German's salary, trying  as usual, to counteract the effects of his violent outbreaks with  generosity. That which he could not forget was his dependent's nobility,  constantly making it the subject of new jests. That glorious boast had  brought to his mind the genealogical trees of the illustrious ancestry  of his prize cattle. The German was a pedigreed fellow, and thenceforth  he called him by that nickname.    Seated on summer nights under the awning, he surveyed his family around  him with a sort of patriarchal ecstasy. In the evening hush could be  heard the buzzing of insects and the croaking of the frogs. From the  distant ranches floated the songs of the peons as they prepared their  suppers. It was harvest time, and great bands of immigrants were  encamped in the fields for the extra work.    Madariaga had known many of the hard old days of wars and violence. Upon  his arrival in South America, he had witnessed the last years of the  tyranny of Rosas.

He has, however, learnt to read the thoughts of such a creature as poor  Mimmy, who, intending to overwhelm him with flattery and fondness,  only succeeds in making such a self-revelation of murderous envy  that Siegfried smites him with Nothung and slays him, to the keen  satisfaction of the hidden Alberic. Caring nothing for the gold, which  he leaves to the care of the slain; disappointed in his fancy for  learning fear; and longing for a mate, he casts himself wearily down,  and again appeals to his friend the bird, who tells him of a woman  sleeping on a mountain peak within a fortress of fire that only the  fearless can penetrate. Siegfried is up in a moment with all the tumult  of spring in his veins, and follows the flight of the bird as it pilots  him to the fiery mountain.    The Third Act    To the root of the mountain comes also the Wanderer, now nearing his  doom. He calls up the First Mother from the depths of the earth, and  begs counsel from her. She bids him confer with the Norns (the Fates).  But they are of no use to him: what he seeks is some foreknowledge of  the way of the Will in its perpetual strife with these helpless Fates  who can only spin the net of circumstance and environment round the feet  of men. Why not, says Erda then, go to the daughter I bore you, and take  counsel with her? He has to explain how he has cut himself off from her,  and set the fires of Loki between the world and her counsel. In that  case the First Mother cannot help him: such a separation is part of  the bewilderment that is ever the first outcome of her eternal work  of thrusting the life energy of the world to higher and higher  organization. She can show him no way of escape from the destruction he  foresees. Then from the innermost of him breaks the confession that he  rejoices in his doom, and now himself exults in passing away with all  his ordinances and alliances, with the spear-sceptre which he has only  wielded on condition of slaying his dearest children with it, with the  kingdom, the power and the glory which will never again boast themselves  as \"world without end.\" And so he dismisses Erda to her sleep in the  heart of the earth as the forest bird draws near, piloting the slain  son's son to his goal.    Now it is an excellent thing to triumph in the victory of the new order  and the passing away of the old; but if you happen to be part of the  old order yourself, you must none the less fight for your life. It seems  hardly possible that the British army at the battle of Waterloo did not  include at least one Englishman intelligent enough to hope, for the  sake of his country and humanity, that Napoleon might defeat the allied  sovereigns; but such an Englishman would kill a French cuirassier rather  than be killed by him just as energetically as the silliest soldier,  ever encouraged by people who ought to know better, to call his  ignorance, ferocity and folly, patriotism and duty. Outworn life may  have become mere error; but it still claims the right to die a natural  death, and will raise its hand against the millennium itself in  self-defence if it tries to come by the short cut of murder. Wotan finds  this out when he comes face to face with Siegfried, who is brought to a  standstill at the foot of the mountain by the disappearance of the bird.  Meeting the Wanderer there, he asks him the way to the mountain where  a woman sleeps surrounded by fire. The Wanderer questions him, and  extracts his story from him, breaking into fatherly delight when  Siegfried, describing the mending of the sword, remarks that all he knew  about the business was that the broken bits of Nothung would be of no  use to him unless he made a new sword out of them right over again from  the beginning. But the Wanderer's interest is by no means reciprocated  by Siegfried. His majesty and elderly dignity are thrown away on the  young anarchist, who, unwilling to waste time talking, bluntly bids  him either show him the way to the mountain, or else \"shut his muzzle.\"  Wotan is a little hurt. \"Patience, my lad,\" he says: \"if you were an old  man I should treat you with respect.\" \"That would be a precious notion,\"  says Siegfried. \"All my life long I was bothered and hampered by an  old man until I swept him out of my way. I will sweep you in the same  fashion if you don't let me pass. Why do you wear such a big hat; and  what has happened to one of your eyes? Was it knocked out by somebody  whose way you obstructed?\" To which Wotan replies allegorically that the  eye that is gone--the eye that his marriage with Fricka cost him--is now  looking at him out of Siegfried's head. At this, Siegfried gives up the  Wanderer as a lunatic, and renews his threats of personal violence. Then  Wotan throws off the mask of the Wanderer; uplifts the world-governing  spear; and puts forth all his divine awe and grandeur as the guardian of  the mountain, round the crest of which the fires of Loki now break into  a red background for the majesty of the god. But all this is lost on  Siegfried Bakoonin. \"Aha!\" he cries, as the spear is levelled against  his breast: \"I have found my father's foe\"; and the spear falls in two  pieces under the stroke of Nothung. \"Up then,\" says Wotan: \"I cannot  withhold you,\" and disappears forever from the eye of man. The fires  roll down the mountain; but Siegfried goes at them as exultantly as  he went at the forging of the sword or the heart of the dragon, and  shoulders his way through them, joyously sounding his horn to the  accompaniment of their crackling and seething. And never a hair of his  head is singed. Those frightful flames which have scared mankind for  centuries from the Truth, have not heat enough in them to make a child  shut its eyes. They are mere phantasmagoria, highly creditable to Loki's  imaginative stage-management; but nothing ever has perished or will  perish eternally in them except the Churches which have been so poor and  faithless as to trade for their power on the lies of a romancer.          BACK TO OPERA AGAIN    And now, O Nibelungen Spectator, pluck up; for all allegories come to an  end somewhere; and the hour of your release from these explanations is  at hand. The rest of what you are going to see is opera, and nothing  but opera. Before many bars have been played, Siegfried and the wakened  Brynhild, newly become tenor and soprano, will sing a concerted  cadenza; plunge on from that to a magnificent love duet; and end with  a precipitous allegro a capella, driven headlong to its end by the  impetuous semiquaver triplets of the famous finales to the first act of  Don Giovanni or the coda to the Leonore overture, with a specifically  contrapuntal theme, points d'orgue, and a high C for the soprano all  complete.    What is more, the work which follows, entitled Night Falls On The Gods,  is a thorough grand opera. In it you shall see what you have so far  missed, the opera chorus in full parade on the stage, not presuming  to interfere with the prima donna as she sings her death song over the  footlights. Nay, that chorus will have its own chance when it first  appears, with a good roaring strain in C major, not, after all, so very  different from, or at all less absurd than the choruses of courtiers  in La Favorita or \"Per te immenso giubilo\" in Lucia. The harmony is no  doubt a little developed, Wagner augmenting his fifths with a G sharp  where Donizetti would have put his fingers in his ears and screamed for  G natural. But it is an opera chorus all the same; and along with it  we have theatrical grandiosities that recall Meyerbeer and Verdi: pezzi  d'insieme for all the principals in a row, vengeful conjurations for  trios of them, romantic death song for the tenor: in short, all manner  of operatic conventions.    Now it is probable that some of us will have been so talked by the more  superstitious Bayreuth pilgrims into regarding Die Gotterdammerung as  the mighty climax to a mighty epic, more Wagnerian than all the other  three sections put together, as not to dare notice this startling  atavism, especially if we find the trio-conjurations more exhilarating  than the metaphysical discourses of Wotan in the three true music  dramas of The Ring. There is, however, no real atavism involved.  Die Gotterdammerung, though the last of The Ring dramas in order of  performance, was the first in order of conception and was indeed the  root from which all the others sprang.    The history of the matter is as follows. All Wagner's works prior to The  Ring are operas. The last of them, Lohengrin, is perhaps the best known  of modern operas. As performed in its entirety at Bayreuth, it is even  more operatic than it appears at Covent Garden, because it happens that  its most old-fashioned features, notably some of the big set concerted  pieces for principals and chorus (pezzi d'insieme as I have called  them above), are harder to perform than the more modern and  characteristically Wagnerian sections, and for that reason were cut out  in preparing the abbreviated fashionable version. Thus Lohengrin came  upon the ordinary operatic stage as a more advanced departure from  current operatic models than its composer had made it. Still, it is  unmistakably an opera, with chorus, concerted pieces, grand finales,  and a heroine who, if she does not sing florid variations with  flute obbligato, is none the less a very perceptible prima donna. In  everything but musical technique the change from Lohengrin to The Rhine  Gold is quite revolutionary.    The explanation is that Night Falls On The Gods came in between them,  although its music was not finished until twenty years after that of  The Rhine Gold, and thus belongs to a later and more masterful phase of  Wagner's harmonic style. It first came into Wagner's head as an opera  to be entitled Siegfried's Death, founded on the old Niblung Sagas, which  offered to Wagner the"]]]
