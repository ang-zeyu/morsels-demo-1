[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18237"],[0,"A Bird Calendar for Northern India (#11)"],[1,".    The nightjars help to swell the nocturnal chorus. There are seven or  eight different species in India, but of these only three are commonly  heard and two of them occur mainly in forest tracts. The call of the  most widely-distributed of the Indian goatsuckers--_Caprimulgus  asiaticus_, the common Indian nightjar--is like unto the sound made by  a stone skimming over ice. Horsfield's goatsucker is a very vociferous  bird. From March till June it is heard wherever there are forests. As  soon as the shadows of the evening begin to steal across the sky its  loud _chuk_, _chuk_, _chuk_, _chuk_, _chuk_ cleaves the air for  minutes together. This call to some extent replaces by night the  _tonk_, _tonk_, _tonk_ of the coppersmith, which is uttered so  persistently in the day-time. In addition to this note Horsfield's  nightjar emits a low soft _chur_, _chur_, _chur_.    The third nightjar, which also is confined chiefly to forest tracts,  is known as Franklin's nightjar (_C. monticolus_). This utters a harsh  _tweet_ which at a distance might pass for the chirp of a canary with  a sore throat.    Other sounds heard at night-time are the plaintive _did-he-do-it  pity-to-do-it_ of the red-wattled lapwing (_Sarcogrammus indicus_),  and the shrill calls of other plovers.    As has already been said, the nesting season is at its height in May.  With the exception of the paroquets, spotted owlets, nuthatches, black  vultures and pied kingfishers, which have completed nesting operations  for the year, and the golden-backed woodpeckers and the  cliff-swallows, which have reared up their first broods, the great  majority of the birds mentioned as having nests or young in March or  April are still busily occupied with domestic cares.    May marks the close of the usual breeding season for the jungle crows,  skylarks, crested larks, finch-larks, wood-shrikes, yellow-throated  sparrows, sand-martins, pied wagtails, green barbets, coppersmiths,  rollers, green bee-eaters, white-breasted kingfishers, scavenger  vultures, tawny eagles, kites, shikras, spur-winged plovers, little  ringed plovers, pied woodpeckers, night herons and pied chats. In the  case of the tree-pies, cuckoo-shrikes, seven sisters, bank-mynas and  blue-tailed bee-eaters the nesting season is now at its height. All  the following birds are likely to have either eggs or nestlings in  May: the white-eyes, ioras, bulbuls, tailor-birds, shrikes, brown  rock-chats, Indian robins, magpie-robins, sunbirds, swifts, nightjars,  white-eyed buzzards, hoopoes, green pigeons, blue rock-pigeons, doves,  sparrows, the red and yellow wattled lapwings, minivets, wire-tailed  swallows, red-headed merlins, fantail flycatchers, pipits, sand-grouse  and grey partridges. The nests of most of these have been described  already.    In the present month several species begin nesting operations. First  and foremost among these is the king-crow or black drongo (_Dicrurus  ater_). No bird, not even the roller, makes so much ado about  courtship and nesting as does the king-crow, of which the love-making  was described last month. A pair of king-crows regards as its castle  the tree in which it has elected to construct a nest. Round this tree  it establishes a sphere of influence into which none but a favoured  few birds may come. All intruders are forthwith set upon by the pair  of little furies, and no sight is commoner at this season than that of  a crow, a kite, or a hawk being chased by two irate drongos. The nest  of the king-crow is a small cup, wedged into the fork of a branch high  up in a tree.    The Indian oriole (_Oriolus kundoo_) is one of the privileged  creatures allowed to enter the dicrurian sphere of influence, and it  takes full advantage of this privilege by placing its nest almost  invariably in the same tree as that of the king-crow. The oriole is a  timid bird and is glad to rear up its family under the aegis of so  doughty a warrior as the Black Prince of the Birds. The nest of the  oriole is a wonderful structure. Having selected a fork in a suitable  branch, the nesting bird tears off a long strip of soft pliable bark,  usually that of the mulberry tree. It proceeds to wind one end of this  strip round a limb of the forked branch, then the other end is  similarly bound to the other limb. A second and a third strip of bark  are thus dealt with, and in this manner a cradle or hammock is formed.  On it a slender cup-shaped nest is superimposed. This is composed of  grasses and fibres, some of which are wound round the limbs of the  forked branch, while others are made fast to the strands of bark. The  completed nest is nearly five inches in diameter. From below it looks  like a ball of dried grass wedged into the forked branch.    The oriole lays from two to four white eggs spotted with dull red. The  spots can be washed off by water; sometimes their colour \"runs\" while  they are in the nest, thereby imparting a pink hue to the whole shell.  Both sexes take part in nest construction, but the hen alone appears  to incubate. She is a very shy creature, and is rarely discovered  actually sitting, because she leaves the nest with a little cry of  alarm at the first sound of a human footfall.    May and June are the months in which to look for the nests of that  superb bird--the paradise flycatcher (_Terpsiphone paradisi_). This is  known as the rocket-bird or ribbon-bird because of the two long  fluttering tail feathers possessed by the cock. The hen has the  appearance of a kind of bulbul, being chestnut-hued with a white  breast and a metallic blue-black crest. For the first year of their  existence the young cocks resemble the hens in appearance. Then the  long tail feathers appear. In his third year the cock turns white save  for the black-crested head. This species spends the winter in South  India. In April it migrates northwards to summer in the shady parts of  the plains of Bengal, the United Provinces and the Punjab, and on the  lower slopes of the Himalayas. The nest is a deep, untidy-looking cup,  having the shape of an inverted cone. It is always completely covered  with cocoons and cobweb. It is usually attached to one or more of the  lower branches of a tree. Both sexes work at the nest and take part in  incubation. The long tail feathers of the sitting cock hang down from  the nest like red or white satin streamers according to the phase of  his plumage. In the breeding season the cock sings a sweet little  lay--an abridged version of that of the fantail flycatcher. When  alarmed both the cock and the hen utter a sharp _tschit_.    May is perhaps the proper month in which to describe the nesting of  the various species of myna.    According to Hume the normal breeding season of the common myna  (_Acridotheres tristis_) lasts from June to August, during which  period two broods are reared. This is not correct. The nesting season  of this species begins long before June. The writer has repeatedly  seen mynas carrying twigs and feathers in March, and has come across  nests containing eggs or young birds in both April and May. June  perhaps is the month in which the largest numbers of nests are seen.  The cradle of the common myna is devoid of architectural merit. It is  a mere conglomeration of twigs, grass, rags, bits of paper and other  oddments. The nesting material is dropped haphazard into a hole in a  tree or building, or even on to a ledge in a verandah. Four beautiful  blue eggs are laid.    At Peshawar Mr. A. J. Currie once found four myna's eggs in a deserted  crows' nest in a tree.    As has already been stated, the nest of the bank-myna (_A.  ginginianus_) is built in a hole in a well, a sandbank, or a cliff.  The birds breed in colonies; each pair excavates its own nest by means  of beak and claw. Into the holes dug out in this manner the  miscellaneous nesting materials are dropped pell-mell after the manner  of all mynas. The breeding season of this species lasts from April to  July, May being the month in which most eggs are laid.    The black-headed or brahminy myna (_Temenuchus pagodarum_) usually  begins nesting operations about a month later than the bank-myna; its  eggs are most often taken in June. The nest, which is an untidy,  odoriferous collection of rubbish, is always in a cavity. In Northern  India a hole in a tree is usually selected; in the South buildings are  largely patronised. Some years ago the writer observed a pair of these  birds building a nest in a hole made in the masonry for the passage of  the lightning conductor of the Church in Fort St. George, Madras.    May marks the commencement of the breeding season of the pied  starlings (_Sturnopastor contra_). In this month they begin to give  vent with vigour to their cheerful call, which is so pleasing as  almost to merit the name of song.    Throughout the rains they continue to make a joyful noise. Not that  they are silent at other seasons; they call throughout the year, but,  except at the breeding period, their voices are comparatively subdued.    The nest is a bulky, untidy mass of straw, roots, twigs, rags,  feathers and such-like things. It is placed fairly low down in a tree.    Many of these nests are to be seen in May, but the breeding season is  at its height in June and July.    The grey hornbills (_Lophoceros birostris_) are now seeking out holes  in which to deposit their eggs. The hen, after having laid the first  egg, does not emerge from the nest till the young are ready to fly.  During the whole of this period she is kept a close prisoner, the  aperture to the nest cavity having been closed by her mate and herself  with their own droppings, a small chink alone being left through which  she is able to insert her beak in order to receive the food brought to  her by the cock.    Mr. A. J. Currie gives an interesting account of a grey hornbill's  nest he discovered at Lahore in 1910. About the middle of April he  noticed a pair of paroquets nesting "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18253"],[0,"Discovery of Witches (#11)"],[1," cottages. On one of the side walls is an  inscription, almost entirely obliterated, which contained the date of  the building and the initials of the name of its first owner. At a  little distance from Rough Lee, pursuing the course of the stream, he  will find the foundations of an ancient mill, and the millstones still  unremoved, though the building itself has been pulled down long ago.  This was, doubtless, the mill of Richard Baldwin, the miller, who, as  stated in Old Demdike's confession, ejected her and Alizon Device her  daughter, from his land so contumeliously; immediately after which her  \"Spirit or divell called Tibb appeared, and sayd Revenge thee of him.\"  Greenhead, the residence of Robert Nutter, one of the reputed victims  of the prisoners tried on this occasion, is at some distance from  Rough Lee, and is yet in good preservation, and occupied as a  farmhouse.]    [Footnote 39: The instances are very few in England in which the  statute of James the first was brought to bear against any but the  lowest classes of the people. Indeed, there are not many attempts  reported to attack the rich and powerful with weapons derived from its  provisions. One of such attempts, which did not, like that against  Alice Nutter, prove successful, is narrated in a curious and scarce  pamphlet, which I have now before me, with this title--\"Wonderful News  from the North, or a true Relation of the sad and grievous Torments  inflicted upon the Bodies of three children of Mr. George Muschamp,  late of the County of Northumberland, by Witchcraft, and how  miraculously it pleased God to strengthen them and to deliver them; as  also the prosecution of the say'd Witches, as by Oaths and their own  Confessions will appear, and by the Indictment found by the Jury  against one of them at the Sessions of the Peace held at Alnwick, the  24th day of April, 1650.

This was  evidently a diabolical plot, in which these children were made the  puppets, and which was got up to accomplish the destruction of a  person of condition, Mrs. Dorothy Swinnow, the wife of Colonel  Swinnow, of Chatton, in Northumberland, and from which she had great  difficulty in escaping.]    The trial of the Samlesbury witches, Jennet Bierley, Ellen Bierley,  and Jane Southworth, forms a curious episode in Potts's _Discoverie_.  A Priest or Jesuit, of the name of Thomson, _alias_ Southworth, had  tutored the principal evidence, Grace Sowerbuts, a girl of the age of  fourteen, but who had not the same instinctive genius for perjury as  Jennet Device, to accuse the three persons above mentioned of having  bewitched her; \"so that,\" as the indictment runs, \"by means thereof  her body wasted and consumed.\" \"The chief object,\" says Sir Walter  Scott, \"in this imposture, was doubtless the advantage and promotion  of the Catholic cause, as the patient would have been in due time  exorcised and the fiend dispossessed, by the same priest who had  taught her to counterfeit the fits. Revenge against the women, who had  become proselytes to the Church of England, was probably an additional  motive.\" But the imposture broke down, from the inability of the  principal witness to support the scheme of deception. Unsuccessful,  however, as it proved, the time was well chosen, the groundwork  excellently laid, the evidence industriously got up, and it must ever  deserve a prominent place in the history--a history, how delightful  when it shall be written in the spirit of philosophy and with due  application of research--of human fraud and imposture.    We can only speculate, of course, on such an occasion, but perhaps no  trial is recorded as having taken place, with the results of which  every body, the parties convicted only excepted, was, in all  probability, better pleased or satisfied, than at this witch trial at  Lancaster in 1612. The mob would be delighted with a pageant, always  acceptable, in the execution of ten witches; and still more, that one  of them was of a rank superior to their own;--the judge had no doubt,  in his opinion, avoided each horn of the dilemma--the abomination  mentioned in Scripture--punishing the innocent or letting the guilty  go free--by tracking guilt with well breathed sagacity, and  unravelling imposture with unerring skill;--a Jesuit had been  unkennelled, a spectacle as gratifying to a serious Protestant in  those days, as running down a fox to a thorough sportsman;--a plot had  been discovered which might have made Lancaster Castle \"to topple on  its warders\" and \"slope its head to its foundations,\" and Master  Cowell, who had held so many inquests, to vanish without leaving  anything in his own person whereon an inquest could be holden;--a  pestilent nest of incorrigible witches had been dug out and rooted up,  and Pendle Hill placed under sanatory regulations;--and last, and not  least, as affording matter of pride and exultation to every loyal  subject, a commentary had at last been collected for two texts, which  had long called for some such support without finding it, King James's  _Demonology_, and his statute against witchcraft. When the  _Discoverie_ of Master Potts, with its rich treasury of illustrative  evidence, came to hand, would not the monarch be the happiest man in  his dominions!    Twenty years after the publication of the tract now reprinted, Pendle  Forest again became the scene of pretended witchcrafts; and from  various circumstances, the trial which took place then (in 1633) has  acquired even greater notoriety than the one which preceded it, though  no Master Potts could be found to transmit a report of the proceedings  in the second case, a deficiency which is greatly to be lamented. The  particulars are substantially comprised in the following examination,  which is given from the copy in Whitaker's _Whalley_, p. 213, which,  on comparison, is unquestionably more accurate than the other two  versions, in Webster, p. 347, and Baines's _Lancashire_, vol. i. p.  604:[40]--    [Footnote 40: The copy in Baines is from the Harl. MSS., cod. 6854,  fo. 26 _b_, and though inserted in his history as more correct than  that in Whitaker's Whalley, is so disfigured by errors, particularly  in the names of persons and places, as to be utterly unintelligible.  From what source Whitaker derived his transcript does not appear; for  the confession of Margaret Johnson he cites Dodsworth MSS. in Bodleian  Lib., vol. 61, p. 47.]      \"THE EXAMINATION OF EDMUND ROBINSON,    \"Son of _Edm. Robinson_, of _Pendle_ forest, mason,[41] taken at  _Padiham_ before _Richard Shuttleworth_[42] and _John Starkie_,[43]  Esqs. two of his majesty's justices of the peace, within the county of  _Lancaster_, 10th of February, A.D. 1633.    [Footnote 41: \"The informer was one Edmund Robinson (yet living at the  writing hereof, and commonly known by the name of Ned of Roughs) whose  Father was by trade a Waller, and but a poor Man, and they finding  that they were believed and had incouragement by the adjoyning  Magistrates, and the persons being committed to prison or bound over  to the next Assizes, the boy, his Father and some others besides did  make a practice to go from Church to Church that the Boy might reveal  and discover Witches, pretending that there was a great number at the  pretended meeting whose faces he could know, and by that means they  got a good living, that in a short space the Father bought a Cow or  two, when he had none before. And it came to pass that this said Boy  was brought into the Church of Kildwick a large parish Church, where I  (being then Curate there) was preaching in the afternoon, and was set  upon a stall (he being but about ten or eleven years old) to look  about him, which moved some little disturbance in the Congregation for  a while. And after prayers I inquiring what the matter was, the people  told me that it was the Boy that discovered Witches, upon which I went  to the house where he was to stay all night, where I found him, and  two very unlikely persons that did conduct him, and manage the  business; I desired to have some discourse with the Boy in private,  but that they utterly refused; then in the presence of a great many  people, I took the Boy near me, and said: Good Boy tell me truly, and  in earnest, did thou see and hear such strange things of the meeting  of Witches, as is reported by many that thou dost relate, or did not  some person teach thee to say such things of thy self? But the two men  not giving the Boy leave to answer, did pluck him from me, and said he  had been examined by two able Justices of the Peace, and they did  never ask him such a question, to whom I replied, the persons accused  had therefore the more wrong.\"--Webster's _Displaying of Witchcraft_,  p. 276.]    [Footnote 42: This was Richard Shuttleworth of Gawthorp, Esq., who  married the daughter and heiress of R.
