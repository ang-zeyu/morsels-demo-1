DAVIS CAVES (15)    Facing Roubidoux Creek, on the farm of J.W. Davis, 3 miles north of  Cookville, are three caves. The largest is 40 or 50 feet above the  foot of the bluff. It has an entrance 30 feet wide, the roof being 8  feet high. It is well lighted to a depth of 120 feet, where it curves.  No refuse was observed, but the situation is favorable for habitation.    Another cave, near this, has an entrance 30 feet wide and 10 feet  high; it is well lighted for 40 feet back.    The third cave of this series is a rock shelter a short distance south  of the second, and higher up in the bluff.    All these appear to deserve an examination.      BERRY CAVE    A cave on George Berry's land, in a ravine opening into the east side  of Roubidoux Creek, 3 miles from Hanna post office, has a small  entrance which is nearly closed by \"drip rock,\" the roof, walls, and  floor being thickly incrusted. These deposits, which it is said are  even more abundant farther in, seem to be rather rapidly increasing in  volume.      MAXEY CAVE (16)    What is known as Maxey's Cave is 7 miles south of Waynesville, on the  west side of Roubidoux Creek. It is by far the largest open cave in  this region, the entrance being 40 feet high and 100 feet wide. It  extends across the head of a ravine, and if the loose earth at the  sides were cleared away it would be found still wider. The entire  floor is covered with a mass of rocks of every size up to several  tons, except at one side of the entrance where there is a small amount  of loose earth. The front chamber is 300 feet long to where the cavern  forks; in one of these forks daylight extends for 100 feet farther, or  400 feet from the mouth. Marks on the walls show that the entire floor  is sometimes covered 2 or 3 feet deep with running water.    A survey made some years ago disclosed a mass of earth and rock \"a  long ways back in the hill;\" definite figures could not be obtained.  Beyond this point it was impossible to proceed. By running  corresponding angles and lines on the surface outside the surveyors  came to a very large sink hole, into which flowed the drainage of  several farms. This explains the flood marks. Clearly the roof of the  cave had fallen in at this point.      YOARK CAVE    Yoark Cave, a fourth of a mile east from Maxey's in a bluff facing  south on the left bank of Roubidoux Creek, has an entrance 40 feet  wide, 30 feet high, and is in daylight for 150 feet. Cave earth  extends for 100 feet from the entrance, and apparently continues from  this point under the gravel and clay which have washed from the  interior.    It is on the land of A.L. Foote, having been in his family  continuously since it was secured by Government patent. The name is  derived from \"Grandma Martha Yoark,\" who was among the earliest white  settlers in the region. Her home was on the opposite side of the  creek, in a pioneer log cabin, the last vestige of which, except the  stones of the chimney, disappeared before the Civil War.    In the front portion many large rocks are lying on the surface of the  clay floor and others are imbedded in it; probably still others are  entirely covered. Farther back the clay is mixed with gravel washed  from the interior. This deposit is never entirely dry and in rainy  seasons is quite muddy. The difficulty of removing or digging under  the rocks, added to the certainty that water would be encountered  before the bottom is reached, render useless any effort at complete  excavation. The amount of refuse on the surface, however, is a good  indication that such researches as would be possible in the upper  layers, among the rocks, would disclose a large quantity of aboriginal  remains of comparatively modern date.      GRAVES AT LAUGHLIN'S (17)    On the Laughlin goat ranch, 6 miles southeast of Waynesville, a high  narrow ridge level along the top and sloping abruptly on each side  extends northward from the hills on the right side of Roubidoux Creek  and terminates in a vertical cliff. Bedrock projects on the top and on  both sides, and vegetation is so scanty that the crest is almost a  \"bald.\"    On the summit of this ridge are seven cairns, the first one only a few  feet from the edge of the cliff, the last one about 300 feet back,  near where the ground begins to ascend toward the plateau. They are  small, none more than 3 feet high, and all have a depression in the  top where the stones have been thrown out from the center toward the  outside by relic seekers and rabbit hunters.    In three of them flat stones remaining in place at parts of the margin  indicate that an irregular square inclosure was constructed around the  bodies, as in those examined at Gourd Creek. Possibly this feature  existed in all of them at the time of their construction, but there  was no evidence that any of them had been walled up like those at  Sugar Tree Camp or the Devil's Elbow. Views of their present  conditions are shown in plate 14.      KERR CAVE (17)    Near the site of Kerr's Mill, on Roubidoux Creek, 5 miles south-east  of Waynesville, is a cave at the foot of a bluff, the entrance 60 feet  above the bottom of the hill. Viewed from the outside it has the  appearance of a rock shelter 40 feet wide and 45 feet deep. Above  most of it the stratum forming the roof is 15 feet high; near the  front the successive overlying strata project in a hollow curve until  at the face of the bluff the drop from the ledge to the talus  immediately beneath it is fully 50 feet.    At one side, near the rear, is a passage 5 or 6 feet wide, not visible  from the front, extending back into the hill. Although the cave is  usually dry, clean gravel in this passage shows that sufficient water  flows through at times to prevent earth from accumulating; further  evidence of which fact is found in the mud cracks of the floor and the  ferns growing amid the rocks, large and small, which cover it.    The place could never have been occupied except for temporary shelter,  and there is no evidence that even this use was made of it.      SELL CAVE (18)    Half a mile directly south of Waynesville, on the farm of Dr. W.J.  Sell, is a cave located in the northern end of a ridge entirely  detached from the surrounding hills. The entrance, facing northeast,  is halfway up the point of the ridge, overlooking a fertile bottom  along Roubidoux Creek. From the top of the ledge over the entrance the  hill has an easy upgrade for a fourth of a mile to the summit, which  is at an elevation of 250 feet above the creek. On top of the hill is  the site of an Indian village where some mortars, grinding stones, and  numerous flints have been found.    The roof of the cave has partially fallen in at the entrance, forming  a re-entrant curve 30 feet across and extending 11 feet inward; the  large blocks from this, and from the stratum described later, were  lying on and in the talus at the present front but did not extend to  the red clay beneath. Some of the blocks could be reduced with a heavy  sledge hammer to an extent that made it possible to roll them out of  the way; but 24 of them had to be broken up with dynamite.    The talus at its thickest part has a depth of 6 feet; it extends down  the hill on the outside and has washed back into the cave, gradually  decreasing in quantity, to a distance of 50 feet. The roof, at the  front, is 5 feet above the talus; the thickness of the ledge forming  it is only 8 feet, the slope of the hill starting from this line.  Owing to the restricted width of the ridge, on top, the entire area  draining over the ledge measures only 70 feet in width above the  entrance, and narrows irregularly to a breadth of 30 feet at an  outcrop 120 feet up the hill, or with an approximate space of 6,000  square feet. On this small tract more than half the rock is bare, with  scanty patches of soil and humus in the crevices and on flat places.  At the present time the water which flows over the ledge during hard  rains is scarcely turbid; consequently a period of several centuries  was required for the debris to accumulate.    Fourteen feet back from the farthest-receding part of the curve of the  roof at the front is the edge of a stratum 3 feet thick; the bottom of  this was 3 feet above the talus immediately beneath it. This stratum  is continuous, with a perceptible dip to the interior, as far as it  can be seen.    The width of the cave at the mouth is 44 feet; 30 feet within it  widens to 51 feet. A small amount of water making its way from the  interior over the level floor collects in a little basin scooped out  to receive it, and sinks into the floor near the inner foot of the  talus 55 feet from the entrance. At this point the width of the cave  is 36 feet; the height to the roof is 41/2 feet. As the floor beyond  here is soft mud, the cavern was not followed farther.    Owing to the limited space between the floor and the roof it was  necessary to remove the excavated earth to the outside. The water  which flows from the hill and falls upon the talus during rains also  had to be provided against. A trench 4 feet wide at the bottom, with  sufficient slant to the sides to prevent them from falling in, was  started 25 feet out from the entrance, on a level which gave it a  depth of 61/2 feet at the highest point of the talus, thus carrying it a  few inches into the clay which was the original floor of the cave.  This depth also brought it well below the level of the little pool  inside. When its greatest depth was reached the excavation was at once  widened to 25 feet, thus reaching well toward the cliff on either  side. Growing trees and large rocks made a greater width here  impracticable.    In the talus were flint implements, none small enough for arrowheads,  some well finished, others roughly made, a few being shown in plate  15; three sandstone"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18932"],[0,"Mental Defectives and Sexual Offenders (#11)"],[1," carry out a great  deal of preventive work in the way of advising parents and supervising  children, who by their timely and kindly intervention are saved from  coming within the scope of the law.      SECTION 8.--CHILDREN'S COURTS.    Several witnesses before the Committee pointed out the need for the  establishment of special Courts for children and juveniles.    The Committee recommend that such provision be made, and also that  clinics be established providing for the physical and psychological  examination of all children coming under the jurisdiction of these  Courts. The fuller knowledge thus acquired would be extremely valuable  to the authorities dealing with the children.    Many countries have recognized this need and have established properly  constituted Courts for dealing with children and juveniles as apart and  distinct from Police Courts.    In this connection it is surprising to find that New Zealand is lagging  behind in that in the laws relating to the punishment of crime hardly  any distinction in procedure is made between the child and the adult. It  is true, of course, that a practice has grown up whereby children are  dealt with in the Police Courts at a time apart from the hearing of  adult cases, but the procedure of the Criminal Court has been  retained--_i.e._, the young delinquent is charged with an offence, is  required to plead, and if found guilty is liable to conviction. In the  majority of such cases the charges are for minor offences and are dealt  with summarily, but a child charged with an indictable offence and  remanded to the Supreme Court for trial or sentence may in the interim  be detained in prison.    By arrangement between the Departments concerned most of the cases of  children and juveniles are investigated by the Juvenile Probation  Officer of the Education Department prior to the hearing, but these  officers have no legal standing in any Court, and are not even empowered  to bring a destitute child before a Magistrate for committal to the care  of the State. This function must be carried out by a police constable.    The Children's Court, as it is constituted in other countries, is a  Court of equity, and its principal function is to consider all children  brought before it as cases requiring protection and care. It is the  business of the Court, by means of careful investigation in each case of  conduct, school history, family history, and mental condition, to  ascertain, if possible, the reason for misconduct, and either to  eliminate or modify the causes, or to remove the child from the  environment that has contributed to its present condition.    The presiding Magistrates are usually selected on account of their  experience with children and knowledge of child psychology. In some of  the Courts in America women are selected for these positions.    It is common knowledge that lack of mental balance, retardation, and  physical defect are responsible for much juvenile delinquency, and it is  therefore essential that if the children appearing before the Courts are  to be dealt with in a scientific manner there should be provision on the  lines recommended above.      SECTION 9.--POLICY FOR THE FUTURE.    It seems to the Committee that the Dominion has now come to the parting  of the ways in this matter, and unless the multiplication of the  feeble-minded is to be allowed to go on in an ever-increasing ratio,  with consequences dreadful to contemplate, the problem must be dealt  with on broader lines, and in a more comprehensive fashion.    In the first place, a comprehensive system of notification is essential  so that a register as complete as possible may be made of the cases to  be dealt with.    The English Commission for Inquiring into the Care and Control of the  Feeble-minded, whose report appeared as far back as 1908, laid down the  basic principles of a sound policy in dealing with this question. Their  first principle was that persons who cannot take a part in the struggle  for life owing to mental defect should be afforded by the State such  protection as may be suited to their needs. Their next principle was  that the mental condition of these persons, and neither their poverty  nor their crime, is the real ground of their claim for help from the  State. Their third principle was that if the mentally defective are to  be properly considered and protected as such it is necessary to  ascertain who they are and where they are.    This, of course, is the object of the system of registration to which we  have referred.    Lastly, the English Commission held that the protection of the mentally  defective person, whatever form it takes, should be continued as long as  it is necessary for his good.    These principles appear to us to be quite sound, and we have no  hesitation in adopting them.      _Proposed Eugenic Board._    In regard to the method of compiling the register, some excellent  suggestions were made by Dr. Theodore Grant Gray, Medical Superintendent  of the Nelson Mental Hospital. He proposed, first, that a Government  Department or sub-department should be created to deal with all  feeble-minded and mentally defective persons living outside  institutions. It would deal not only with the feeble-minded, but it  would act the part of a Government \"after-care association,\" in that it  would keep in touch with all persons discharged from mental hospitals.  One of its duties would be to keep a register of all feeble-minded,  epileptic, and mentally defective persons living outside institutional  care. Dr. Gray further suggests that the register should be compiled in  the following manner:--        (1.) It would be a statutory duty of all School Medical      Officers to report to the Department the names of all      feeble-minded or epileptic children in their districts.        (2.) It would be the duty of the District Education Board to      report any child of school age who was not attending school      because of feeble-mindedness or epilepsy.        (3.) It would be the duty of the Superintendent, owner, or      licensee of every hospital, private hospital, industrial      school, or reformatory prison to notify the Department upon      the admission of any person suffering from feeble-mindedness      or epilepsy.        (4.) It would be the duty of the Superintendent of every      mental hospital to notify the name of every person discharged      from a mental hospital.        (5.) It would be the duty of every Judge or Magistrate in all      cases brought before him in which there appears to be mental      enfeeblement or epilepsy to call to his assistance an      alienist, and, if the report is confirmatory, to order such      person's name to be placed upon the register.    N.B.--In the case of sections 1, 2, and 3 the Department would apply to  a Magistrate for an order to register the person concerned. In section 4  the process would be automatic.           *       *       *       *       *    The Committee consider the machinery suggested for the purpose of  compilation of the register very suitable, subject to such modifications  as may be found necessary in practice, but have come to the conclusion  that it would be preferable for many reasons to keep cases of this kind,  as far as possible, free from Courts, a large part of whose work  consists in trying persons charged with criminal offences, and to follow  the plan which seems to be working very well in several American  States--namely, to set up a Board of experts to deal with these cases.    The Board, which might be called the Eugenic Board, should be a central  Board associated with a special Department or sub-department, of which  the head should be a man of sufficient personality, energy, and  organizing-power to grapple effectively with this question--first, by  taking the necessary steps to compile a reasonably exhaustive register,  and afterwards, by co-ordination with cognate Departments or by  independent departmental action, to build up the necessary machinery to  provide for the care, segregation, supervision, or treatment of the  class with which his Department is required to deal.    The compilation of the register is a departmental matter, but  legislative authority will be necessary, to provide for compulsory  notification and to prescribe the means. A well qualified departmental  officer should at once be detailed to take this matter in hand and  formulate from the evidence given to the Committee and from other  sources of information the method and means of obtaining complete  registration.    The first step towards the formation of the Board should be the early  selection and appointment of a thoroughly trained and experienced  psychiatrist. Irrespective of the necessity for the employment of such a  man as the scientific member of the proposed Board, the Committee are of  opinion that the Departments of Health, Mental Hospitals, Prisons, and  the Special Schools Branch of the Education Department are at present  suffering from the lack of expert advice in this direction, and that it  is high time the Government had in its service at least one trained  psychological expert, with recourse to the services of other men with  similar training in the four centres.    The Eugenic Board should be vested with power to examine all cases  notified and, after due investigation, to place on the register--        (1.) Such persons as in its judgment come within the      definition in the Mental Deficiency Act of feeble-minded;        (2.) Persons afflicted with epilepsy associated with      automatism or other conditions rendering them especially      liable to dangerous, immoral, or otherwise anti-social      manifestations, and in the case of juvenile epileptics the      mere frequency of fits rendering them unsuitable for      attendance at ordinary schools;        (3.) Moral imbeciles as defined in the English Mental      Deficiency Act; and        (4.) Persons"]]]
