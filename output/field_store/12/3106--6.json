The wave of pleasure and enjoyment which flooded everything has  passed. Heidelberg, usually so quiet, assumed the role of a city of  the world, and all was bustle and excitement in the streets, which  were hung with flags and other decorations. The trains constantly  brought new accessions to the crowd, and gayety and mirth reigned  supreme.    The dedication of the renovated _Aula_ of the University served as a  prelude to the festivities of the week. On this occasion a splendid  flag, embroidered by order of the wives of the faculty of the Academy,  an equally costly cover for the scepter, and a silver inkstand were  added to the treasures of the University. Conspicuous among the  numerous presents received were a richly carved set of furniture--the  gift of former students from Switzerland--and all the publications of  certain book dealers.    On the afternoon of August 2, the Grand Duke and Duchess arrived in  Heidelberg, where they were received with much enthusiasm. They  remained at the modest palace during the time of the jubilee, and  whenever they appeared they were greeted with expressions of  patriotism and love. On the evening of the 2d, the _Oberburgermeister_,  Dr. Wilckens, extended a hearty welcome to the guests who had gathered  in the over crowded hall. Vincenz Lachner conducted the musical part of  the entertainment, which was charming. The German Crown Prince arrived  early on the 3d, so as to accompany his royal cousins to the service in  the beautifully decorated _Heiliggeistkirche_, on which occasion Prof.  Bassermann spoke with great effect. At 11 o'clock, the Court appeared in  the _Aula_, where the Grand Duke presided, in virtue of his office of  \"Rector Magnificentissimus.\" His address was followed by those of the  Crown Prince; the _Prorector Geheimrath_, Dr. Bekker; Edward Zeller, of  Berlin; Jules Zeller, of Paris; and others. In the evening the citizens  and strangers were attracted to the _Jettenbuehel_ by the festival at the  castle; from 7:30 until 10 o'clock the nobility held court in the  _Bandhause_. The scene was like fairyland, all the outlines of the  castle were marked by thousands of small lights, and the court was  lighted by great candelabra. In the ever-increasing crowd it was  difficult to find a place and to obtain refreshments, which were given  out in immense quantities by the State.    On the morning of the 4th the people thronged again to the  _Heiliggeistkirche_ to listen to the address of the _Geheimrath_, Dr.  Kuno Fischer, on the fate of the Palatinate and Heidelberg, which was  preceded and followed by music. After this the participants in the  festival were brought together by a dinner in the Museum Hall, and  seldom have speeches so inspired an audience as did those of the Grand  Duke and the Crown Prince. Never has Heidelberg seen such a  torch-light procession as that formed by the students in honor of  their Rector; 3,000 torches lighted him to the City Hall. He thanked  them, and proposed cheers for the Crown Prince.    On the morning of the 5th there was the presentation of degrees. In  the afternoon a special train carried four hundred people to  Karlsruhe, where the royal party held a great reception. The capital  was decorated with flags, the city parks were lighted with Bengal  lights, there was music, and a song by the patriotic bard Vierordt was  sung.    All the splendor and interest shrank into insignificance before the  grand historical procession on the morning of the 6th, which made a  lasting impression on the minds of all. The throng of 100,000 people  watched quietly while the whole history of the Palatinate passed in  review before them. The procession illustrated this history much  better than it could have been told by any professor or any book.  There was not a vacant space to be found, extra trains having brought  more spectators, and yet everything passed off quietly and without  accident. In the evening there was a heavy shower, which freshened  everything, leaving no ill effects to be seen the next morning, which  was more than could be said of many of those who attended the imposing  _Commerse_ of the Heidelberg students. As a former student, the Grand  Duke appeared among the 6,000 visitors at the _Commerse_, where he  presided and spoke enthusiastically of the Emperor. Other speeches  followed, until the conversation became so animated that even Von  Treitschke, who was received with an ovation, could not be heard. At  midnight the court retired and the _Fidelitas_ succeeded to their  rights.    On the 7th the time was spent in excursions and carousing until the  illumination of the castle began. I never saw an illumination of the  ruins which could compare in beauty with that of the 7th. The night  was favorable for fireworks, until finally they were rivaled by the  moon,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16363"],[0,"The New York Times Current History of the European War, Vol 1, Issue 4, January (#11)"],[1,"isne,       which has been in progress since the evening of the 12th inst., and       the battle of the Marne, which lasted from the morning of the 6th       to the evening of the 10th and finally ended in the precipitate       flight of the enemy.         \"When we were brought face to face with a position of extraordinary       strength, carefully intrenched and prepared for defense by an army       and staff which are thorough adepts in such work, throughout the       13th and 14th, that position was most gallantly attacked by the       British forces and the passage of the Aisne effected. This is the       third day the troops have been gallantly holding the position they       have gained against most desperate counter-attacks and the hail of       heavy artillery.         \"I am unable to find adequately words in which to express the       admiration I feel for their magnificent conduct.         \"The French armies on our right and left are making good progress,       and I feel sure that we have only to hold on with tenacity to the       ground we have won for a very short time longer when the Allies       will be again in full pursuit of a beaten enemy.         \"The self-sacrificing devotion and splendid spirit of the British       army in France will carry all before it.         \"J.D.P. FRENCH, Field Marshall,         \"Commander in Chief of the British Army in the Field.\"          II.    *The Slow Fight on the Aisne.*    [Made Public Sept. 24.]      The enemy is still maintaining himself along the whole front, and, in  order to do so, is throwing into the fight detachments composed of units  from different formations, the active army, reserve, and Landwehr, as is  shown by the uniforms of the prisoners recently captured.    Our progress, although slow on account of the strength of the defensive  positions against which we are pressing, has in certain directions been  continuous; but the present battle may well last for some days more  before a decision is reached, since it now approximates somewhat to  siege warfare.    The Germans are making use of searchlights. This fact, coupled with  their great strength in heavy artillery, leads to the supposition that  they are employing material which may have been collected for the siege  of Paris.    The nature of the general situation after the operations of the 18th,  19th, and 20th cannot better be summarized than as expressed recently  by a neighboring French commander to his corps: \"Having repulsed  repeated and violent counter-attacks made by the enemy, we have a  feeling that we have been victorious.\"    So far as the British are concerned, the course of events during these  three days can be described in a few words. During Friday, the 18th,  artillery fire was kept up intermittently by both sides during daylight.  At night the German centre attacked certain portions of our line,  supporting the advance of their infantry, as always, by a heavy  bombardment. But the strokes were not delivered with great vigor, and  ceased about 2 A.M. During the day's fighting an aircraft gun of the  Third Army Corps succeeded in bringing down a German aeroplane.    News also was received that a body of French cavalry had demolished part  of the railway to the north, so cutting, at least temporarily, one line  of communication which is of particular importance to the enemy.    On Saturday, the 19th, the bombardment was resumed by the Germans at an  early hour and continued intermittently under reply from our own guns.  Some of their infantry advanced from cover, apparently with the  intention of attacking, but on coming under fire they retired. Otherwise  the day was uneventful, except for the activity of the artillery, which  is a matter of normal routine rather than an event.    Another hostile aeroplane was brought down by us, and one of our  aviators succeeded in dropping several bombs over the German line, one  incendiary bomb falling with considerable effect on a transport park  near La Fere.    A buried store of the enemy's munitions of war was also found, not far  from the Aisne, ten wagon loads of live shell and two wagon loads of  cable being dug up. Traces were discovered of large quantities of stores  having been burned--all tending to show that as far back as the Aisne  the German retirement was hurried.    There was a strong wind during the day, accompanied by a driving rain.  This militated against the aerial reconnoissance.    On Sunday, the 20th, nothing of importance occurred until the afternoon,  when there was a break in the clouds and an interval of feeble sunshine,  which was hardly powerful enough to warm the soaking troops. The Germans  took advantage of this brief spell of fine weather to make several  counter-attacks against different points. These were all repulsed with  loss to the enemy, but the casualties incurred by us were by no means  light.    In one section of our firing line the occupants of the trenches were  under the impression that they heard a military band in the enemy's  lines just before the attack developed. It is now known that the German  infantry started their advance with bands playing.    The offensive against one or two points was renewed at dusk, with no  greater success. The brunt of the resistance has naturally fallen upon  the infantry. In spite of the fact that they have been drenched to the  skin for some days and their trenches have been deep in mud and water,  and in spite of the incessant night alarms and the almost continuous  bombardment to which they have been subjected, they have on every  occasion been ready for the enemy's infantry when the latter attempted  to assault, and they have beaten them back with great loss. Indeed, the  sight of the Pickelhauben [German spiked helmets] coming up has been a  positive relief after long, trying hours of inaction under shell fire.    The object of the great proportion of artillery the Germans employ is to  beat down the resistance of their enemy by concentrated and prolonged  fire, to shatter their nerves with high explosives, before the infantry  attack is launched. They seem to have relied on doing this with us, but  they have not done so, though it has taken them several costly  experiments to discover this fact.    From statements of prisoners it appears that they have been greatly  disappointed by the moral effect produced by their heavy guns, which,  despite the actual losses inflicted, has not been at all commensurate  with the colossal expenditure of ammunition, which has really been  wasted. By this it is not implied that their artillery fire is not good;  it is more than good--it is excellent. But the British soldier is a  difficult person to impress or depress, even by immense shells filled  with a high explosive which detonate with terrific violence and form  craters large enough to act as graves for five horses.    The German howitzer shells are from 8 to 9 inches in calibre, and on  impact they send up columns of greasy black smoke. On account of this  they are irreverently dubbed \"coal boxes,\" \"black Marias,\" or \"Jack  Johnsons\" by the soldiers. Men who take things in this spirit are, it  seems, likely to throw out the calculations based on the loss of morale  so carefully framed by the German military philosophers.    A considerable amount of information has been gleaned from prisoners. It  has been gathered that our bombardment on the 15th produced a great  impression. The opinion is also reported that our infantry make such  good use of ground that the German companies are decimated by our rifle  fire before the British soldier can be seen.    From an official diary captured by the First Army Corps it appears that  one of the German corps contains an extraordinary mixture of units. If  the composition of the other corps is similar, it may be assumed that  the present efficiency of the enemy's forces is in no way comparable  with what it was when the war commenced.    The losses in officers are noted as having been especially severe. A  brigade is stated to be commanded by a Major; some companies of food  guards by one-year volunteers; while after the battle of Montmirail one  regiment lost fifty-five out of sixty officers. The prisoners recently  captured appreciate the fact that the march on Paris has failed and that  their forces are retreating, but state that the object of this movement  is explained by the officers as being to withdraw into closer touch  with the supports, which have stayed too far in the rear.    The officers are also endeavoring to encourage the troops by telling  them that they will be at home by Christmas. A large number of the men  believe that they are beaten. Following is an extract from one document:    \"With the English troops we have great difficulties. They have a queer  way of causing losses to the enemy. They make good trenches, in which  they wait patiently; they carefully measure the ranges for their rifle  fire, and they open a truly hellish fire on the unsuspecting cavalry.  This was the reason that we had such heavy losses.    \"According to our officers, the English striking forces are exhausted;  the English people really never wanted war.\"    From another source: \"The English are very brave and fight to the last  man. One of our companies has lost 130 men out of 240.\"    The following letter, which refers to the fighting on the Aisne, has  been printed and circulated to the troops:         LETTER FOUND ON GERMAN OFFICER OF SEVENTH RESERVE CORPS:         Cerny, South of Laon, Sept 14, 1914.         My Dear Parents: Our corps has the task of holding the heights       south of Cerny in all circumstances until the Fourteenth Corps on       our left flank can grip the enemy's flank. On our right are other       corps. We are fighting with the English Guards, Highlanders, and       Zouaves. The losses on both sides have been enormous. For the most       part this is due to the too brilliant French artillery.       "]]]
