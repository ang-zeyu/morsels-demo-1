[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14300"],[0,"The Life of Napoleon I (Complete) (#11)"],[1," de Beaucaire,\" which he published in August, 1793. He wrote it  in the intervals of some regimental work which had come to hand: and  his passage through the little town of Beaucaire seems to have  suggested the scenic setting of this little dialogue. It purports to  record a discussion between an officer--Buonaparte himself--two  merchants of Marseilles, and citizens of Nimes and Montpellier. It  urges the need of united action under the lead of the Jacobins. The  officer reminds the Marseillais of the great services which their city  has rendered to the cause of liberty. Let Marseilles never disgrace  herself by calling in the Spanish fleet as a protection against  Frenchmen. Let her remember that this civil strife was part of a fight  to the death between French patriots and the despots of Europe. That  was, indeed, the practical point at issue; the stern logic of facts  ranged on the Jacobin side all clear-sighted men who were determined  that the Revolution should not be stamped out by the foreign invaders.  On the ground of mere expediency, men must rally to the cause of the  Jacobinical Republic. Every crime might be condoned, provided that the  men now in power at Paris saved the country. Better their tyranny than  the vengeance of the emigrant _noblesse_. Such was the instinct of  most Frenchmen, and it saved France.    As an _expose_ of keen policy and all-dominating opportunism, \"Le  Souper de Beaucaire\" is admirable. In a national crisis anything that  saves the State is justifiable--that is its argument. The men of the  Mountain are abler and stronger than the Girondins: therefore the  Marseillais are foolish not to bow to the men of the Mountain. The  author feels no sympathy with the generous young Girondins, who, under  the inspiration of Madame Roland, sought to establish a republic of  the virtues even while they converted monarchical Europe by the sword.  Few men can now peruse with undimmed eyes the tragic story of their  fall. But the scenes of 1793 had transformed the Corsican youth into a  dry-eyed opportunist who rejects the Girondins as he would have thrown  aside a defective tool: nay, he blames them as \"guilty of the greatest  of crimes.\"[20]    Nevertheless Buonaparte was alive to the miseries of the situation. He  was weary of civil strifes, in which it seemed that no glory could be  won. He must hew his way to fortune, if only in order to support his  family, which was now drifting about from village to village of  Provence and subsisting on the slender sums doled out by the Republic  to Corsican exiles.    He therefore applied, though without success, for a regimental  exchange to the army of the Rhine. But while toiling through his  administrative drudgery in Provence, his duties brought him near to  Toulon, where the Republic was face to face with triumphant royalism.  The hour had struck: the man now appeared.    In July, 1793, Toulon joined other towns of the south in declaring  against Jacobin tyranny; and the royalists of the town, despairing of  making headway against the troops of the Convention, admitted English  and Spanish squadrons to the harbour to hold the town for Louis XVII,  (August 28th). This event shot an electric thrill through France. It  was the climax of a long series of disasters. Lyons had hoisted the  white flag of the Bourbons, and was making a desperate defence against  the forces of the Convention: the royalist peasants of La Vendee had  several times scattered the National Guards in utter rout: the  Spaniards were crossing the Eastern Pyrenees: the Piedmontese were  before the gates of Grenoble; and in the north and on the Rhine a  doubtful contest was raging.    Such was the condition of France when Buonaparte drew near to the  republican forces encamped near Ollioules, to the north-west of  Toulon. He found them in disorder: their commander, Carteaux, had left  the easel to learn the art of war, and was ignorant of the range of  his few cannon; Dommartin, their artillery commander, had been  disabled by a wound; and the Commissioners of the Convention, who were  charged to put new vigour into the operations, were at their wits' end  for lack of men and munitions. One of them was Salicetti, who hailed  his coming as a godsend, and urged him to take Dommartin's place.  Thus, on September 16th, the thin, sallow, threadbare figure took  command of the artillery.    The republicans menaced the town on two sides. Carteaux with some  8,000 men held the hills between Toulon and Ollioules, while a corps  3,000 strong, under Lapoype, observed the fortress on the side of La  Valette. Badly led though they were, they wrested the valley north of  Mount Faron from the allied outposts, and nearly completed the  besiegers' lines (September 18th). In fact, the garrison, which  comprised only 2,000 British troops, 4,000 Spaniards, 1,500 French  royalists, together with some Neapolitans and Piedmontese, was  insufficient to defend the many positions around the city on which its  safety depended. Indeed, General Grey wrote to Pitt that 50,000 men  were needed to garrison the place; but, as that was double the  strength of the British regular army then, the English Minister could  only hold out hopes of the arrival of an Austrian corps and a few  hundred British.[21]    Before Buonaparte's arrival the Jacobins had no artillery: true, they  had a few field-pieces, four heavier guns and two mortars, which a  sergeant helplessly surveyed; but they had no munitions, no tools,  above all no method and no discipline. Here then was the opportunity  for which he had been pining. At once he assumes the tone of a master.  \"You mind your business, and let me look after mine,\" he exclaims to  officious infantrymen; \"it is artillery that takes fortresses:  infantry gives its help.\" The drudgery of the last weeks now yields  fruitful results: his methodical mind, brooding over the chaos before  him, flashes back to this or that detail in some coast fort or  magazine: his energy hustles on the leisurely Provencaux, and in a few  days he has a respectable park of artillery--fourteen cannon, four  mortars, and the necessary stores. In a brief space the Commissioners  show their approval of his services by promoting him to the rank of  _chef de bataillon_.    By this time the tide was beginning to turn in favour of the Republic.  On October 9th Lyons fell before the Jacobins. The news lends a new  zest to the Jacobins, whose left wing had (October 1st) been severely  handled by the allies on Mount Faron. Above all, Buonaparte's  artillery can be still further strengthened. \"I have despatched,\" he  wrote to the Minister of War, \"an intelligent officer to Lyons,  Briancon, and Grenoble, to procure what might be useful to us. I have  requested the Army of Italy to furnish us with the cannon now useless  for the defence of Antibes and Monaco.... I have established at  Ollioules an arsenal with 80 workers. I have requisitioned horses from  Nice right to Valence and Montpellier.... I am having 5,000 gabions  made every day at Marseilles.\" But he was more than a mere organizer.  He was ever with his men, animating them by his own ardour: \"I always  found him at his post,\" wrote Doppet, who now succeeded Carteaux;  \"when he needed rest he lay on the ground wrapped in his cloak: he  never left the batteries.\" There, amidst the autumn rains, he  contracted the febrile symptoms which for several years deepened the  pallor of his cheeks and furrowed the rings under his eyes, giving him  that uncanny, almost spectral, look which struck a chill to all who  saw him first and knew not the fiery energy that burnt within. There,  too, his zeal, his unfailing resource, his bulldog bravery, and that  indefinable quality which separates genius from talent speedily  conquered the hearts of the French soldiery. One example of this  magnetic power must here suffice. He had ordered a battery to be made  so near to Fort Mulgrave that Salicetti described it as within a  pistol-shot of the English guns. Could it be worked, its effect would  be decisive. But who could work it? The first day saw all its gunners  killed or wounded, and even the reckless Jacobins flinched from facing  the iron hail. \"Call it _the battery of the fearless_,\" ordered the  young captain. The generous French nature was touched at its tenderest  point, personal and national honour, and the battery thereafter never  lacked its full complement of gunners, living and dead.    The position at Fort Mulgrave, or the Little Gibraltar, was, indeed,  all important; for if the republicans seized that commanding position,  the allied squadrons could be overpowered, or at least compelled to  sail away; and with their departure Toulon must fall.    Here we come on to ground that has been fiercely fought over in wordy  war. Did Bonaparte originate the plan of attack? Or did he throw his  weight and influence into a scheme that others beside him had  designed? Or did he merely carry out orders as a subordinate?  According to the Commissioner Barras, the last was the case. But  Barras was with the eastern wing of the besiegers, that is, some miles  away from the side of La Seyne and L'Eguillette, where Buonaparte  fought. Besides, Barras' \"Memoires\" are so untruthful where Buonaparte  is concerned, as to be unworthy of serious attention, at least on  these points.[22] The historian M. Jung likewise relegates Buonaparte  to a quite subordinate position.[23] But his narrative omits some of  the official documents which show that Buonaparte played a very  important part in the siege. Other writers claim that Buonaparte's  influence on the whole conduct of operations was paramount and  decisive. Thus, M. Duruy quotes the letter of the Commissioners to the  Convention: \"We shall take care not to lay siege to Toulon by ordinary  means, when we have a surer means to reduce it, that is, by burning  the enemy's fleet.... We are only waiting for the siege-guns"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14314"],[0,"Etiquette (#11)"],[1," better \"leave them\" than attempt to disturb a plan  that may have had more method in it than madness.    When the last young girl has arrived, Mrs. Toplofty goes into the theater  herself (she does not bother to wait for any boys), and in this one  instance she very likely sits in a stage box so as to \"keep her eye on  them,\" and with her she has two or three of her own friends.    After the theater, big motor busses drive them all either to the house of  the hostess or to a hotel for supper and to dance. If they go to a hotel,  a small ballroom must be engaged and the dance is a private one; it would  be considered out of place to take a lot of very young people to a public  cabaret.    Carelessly chaperoned young girls are sometimes, it is true, seen in very  questionable places because some of the so-called dancing restaurants are  perfectly fit and proper for them to go to; many other places however, are  not, and for the sake of general appearances it is safer to make it a rule  that no very young girl should go anywhere after the theater except to a  private house or a private dance or ball.    Older people, on the other hand, very often go for a supper to one of the  cabarets for which New York is famous (or infamous?), or perhaps go to  watch a vaudeville performance at midnight, or dance, or do both together.    Others, if they are among the great majority of \"quiet\" people, go home  after the theater, especially if they have dined with their hostess (or  host) before the play.      =DON'T BE LATE=    When you are dining before going to the opera or theater you must arrive  on the stroke of the hour for which you are asked; it is one occasion when  it is inexcusable to be late.    In accepting an invitation for lunch or dinner after which you are going  to a game, or any sort of performance, you must not be late! Nothing is  more unfair to others who are keen about whatever it is you are going to  see, than to make them miss the beginning of a performance through your  thoughtless selfishness.    For this reason box-holders who are music-lovers do not ask guests who  have the \"late habit\" to dine before the opera, because experience has  taught them they will miss the overture and most of the first act if they  do. Those, on the other hand, who care nothing for music and go to the  opera to see people and be seen, seldom go until most if not all of the  first act is over. But these in turn might give music-loving guests their  choice of going alone in time for the overture and waiting for them in the  box at the opera, or having the pleasure of dining with their hostess but  missing most of the first part.      =AT GAMES, THE CIRCUS OR ELSEWHERE=    Considerate and polite behavior by each member of an audience is the same  everywhere. At outdoor games, or at the circus, it is not necessary to  stop talking. In fact, a good deal of noise is not out of the way in  \"rooting\" at a match, and a circus band does not demand silence in order  to appreciate its cheerful blare. One very great annoyance in open air  gatherings is cigar smoke when blown directly in one's face, or worse yet  the smoke from a smouldering cigar. It is almost worthy of a study in air  currents to discover why with plenty of space all around, a tiny column of  smoke will make straight for the nostrils of the very one most nauseated  by it!    The only other annoyance met with at ball games or parades or wherever  people occupy seats on the grandstand, is when some few in front get  excited and insist on standing up. If those in front stand--those behind  naturally have to! Generally people call out \"down in front.\" If they  won't stay \"down,\" then all those behind have to stay \"up.\" Also umbrellas  and parasols entirely blot out the view of those behind.          CHAPTER VII    CONVERSATION      =NEED OF RECIPROCITY=    Ideal conversation should be a matter of equal give and take, but too  often it is all \"take.\" The voluble talker--or chatterer--rides his own  hobby straight through the hours without giving anyone else, who might  also like to say something, a chance to do other than exhaustedly await  the turn that never comes. Once in a while--a very long while--one meets a  brilliant person whose talk is a delight; or still more rarely a wit who  manipulates every ordinary topic with the agility of a sleight-of-hand  performer, to the ever increasing rapture of his listeners.    But as a rule the man who has been led to believe that he is a brilliant  and interesting talker has been led to make himself a rapacious pest. No  conversation is possible between others whose ears are within reach of his  ponderous voice; anecdotes, long-winded stories, dramatic and pathetic,  stock his repertoire; but worst of all are his humorous yarns at which he  laughs uproariously though every one else grows solemn and more solemn.    There is a simple rule, by which if one is a voluble chatterer (to be a  good talker necessitates a good mind) one can at least refrain from being  a pest or a bore. And the rule is merely, to stop and think.      =\"THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK\"=    Nearly all the faults or mistakes in conversation are caused by not  thinking. For instance, a first rule for behavior in society is: \"Try to  do and say those things only which will be agreeable to others.\" Yet how  many people, who really know better, people who are perfectly capable of  intelligent understanding if they didn't let their brains remain asleep  or locked tight, go night after night to dinner parties, day after day to  other social gatherings, and absent-mindedly prate about this or that  without ever taking the trouble to _think_ what they are saying and to  whom they are saying it! Would a young mother describe twenty or thirty  cunning tricks and sayings of the baby to a bachelor who has been  helplessly put beside her at dinner if she _thought_? She would know very  well, alas! that not even a very dear friend would really care for more  than a _hors d'oeuvre_ of the subject, at the board of general  conversation.    The older woman is even worse, unless something occurs (often when it is  too late) to make her wake up and realize that she not only bores her  hearers but prejudices everyone against her children by the unrestraint of  her own praise. The daughter who is continually lauded as the most  captivating and beautiful girl in the world, seems to the wearied  perceptions of enforced listeners annoying and plain. In the same way the  \"magnificent\" son is handicapped by his mother's--or his  father's--overweening pride and love in exact proportion to its displayed  intensity. On the other hand, the neglected wife, the unappreciated  husband, the misunderstood child, takes on a glamor in the eyes of others  equally out of proportion. That great love has seldom perfect wisdom is  one of the great tragedies in the drama of life. In the case of the  overloving wife or mother, some one should love _her_ enough to make her  _stop and think_ that her loving praise is not merely a question of boring  her hearers but of handicapping unfairly those for whom she would gladly  lay down her life--and yet few would have the courage to point out to her  that she would far better lay down her tongue.    The cynics say that those who take part in social conversation are bound  to be either the bores or the bored; and that which you choose to be, is a  mere matter of selection. And there must be occasions in the life of  everyone when the cynics seem to be right; the man of affairs who, sitting  next to an attractive looking young woman, is regaled throughout dinner  with the detailed accomplishments of the young woman's husband; the woman  of intellect who must listen with interest to the droolings of an  especially prosy man who holds forth on the super-everything of his own  possessions, can not very well consider that the evening was worth  dressing, sitting up, and going out for.    People who talk too easily are apt to talk too much, and at times  imprudently, and those with vivid imagination are often unreliable in  their statements. On the other hand the \"man of silence\" who never speaks  except when he has something \"worth while\" to say, is apt to wear well  among his intimates, but is not likely to add much to the gaiety of a  party.    Try not to repeat yourself; either by telling the same story again and  again or by going back over details of your narrative that seemed  especially to interest or amuse your hearer. Many things are of interest  when briefly told and for the first time; _nothing_ interests when too  long dwelt upon; little interests that is told a second time. The  exception is something very pleasant that you have heard about A. or more  especially A.'s child, which having already told A. you can then tell B.,  and later C. in A.'s presence. Never do this as a habit, however, and  never drag the incident into the conversation merely to flatter A., since  if A. is a person of taste, he will be far more apt to resent than be  pleased by flattery that borders on the fulsome.    Be careful not to let amiable discussion turn into contradiction and  argument. The tactful person keeps his prejudices to himself and even when  involved in a discussion says quietly \"No. I don't think I agree with you\"  or \"It seems to me thus and so.\" One who is well-bred never says \"You are  wrong!\" or \"Nothing of the kind!\" If he finds another's opinion utterly  opposed to his own, he switches to another subject for a pleasanter  channel of conversation.    When some one is talking to you, it is inconsiderate to keep repeating  \"What did you say?\" Those who are deaf are often, obliged to ask that a  sentence be repeated. Otherwise their irrelevant answers would make them  appear half-witted. But countless persons with perfectly good hearing say  \"What?\" from force of habit and careless inattention.      =THE GIFT OF HUMOR=    The joy of joys is the person of light"]]]
