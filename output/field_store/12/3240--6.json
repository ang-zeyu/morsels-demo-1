We have therefore need to pray that God will lead us and make us taught  of God, that is, ready to learn from God; and will Himself, as He has  promised, write His law in our hearts; otherwise there is no hope for  us. For unless He himself teach us inwardly this wisdom hidden in a  mystery, nature cannot but condemn it and judge it to be heretical. She  takes offence at it, and it seems folly to her, just as we see that it  happened of old in the case of the prophets and Apostles, and just as  blind and impious pontiffs, with their flatterers, do now in my case and  that of those who are like me, upon whom, together with ourselves, may  God at length have mercy, and lift up the light of His countenance upon  them, that we may know His way upon earth and His saving health among  all nations, who is blessed for evermore.

I note a list of thirty coins  which, save for an uncertain specimen of Domitian and one of Marcus,  belong entirely to the late third and the fourth centuries, and end with  two silver of Honorius (_Virtus Romanorum_, Cohen 59). He detects a  Roman road running east from Burgh Castle towards Gorleston, preserved  (he thinks) in an old road sometimes called the Jews' Way; this,  however, seems unlikely. He also maintains the view, which others have  held, that the fort had no defences towards the water. This again seems  unlikely. Burgh Castle, like Richborough, Stutfall, and other forts of  the _Litus_, may well have had different arrangements on its water-front  from the walls on its other three faces. But it cannot have lacked  defences, and excavations prove, here as elsewhere, that walls did  actually exist on this side.      _Northumberland: Corbridge_    (28) A paper by the present writer and Prof. P. Gardner, entitled  'Roman silver in Northumberland' (_Journal of Roman Studies_, iv.  1-12), discusses the relics of what was seemingly a hoard--or perhaps  a service--of Roman silver plate, lost in the Tyne or on its banks near  Corbridge in the fourth century. Of five pieces, four were picked up  between 1731 and 1736, about 100-150 yards below the present bridge at  Corbridge; a fifth was found in 1760 floating in the stream four miles  lower down. One was a silver 'basin', of which no more is recorded.  Another was a small two-handled cup with figures of men and beasts round  it. A third was a round flat-bottomed bowl, with a decorated rim bearing  the Chi-Rho amidst its other ornament. A fourth was a small ovoid cup,  4 inches high, with the inscription _Desideri vivas_. Last, not least,  is the Corbridge Lanx, the only surviving piece of the five, and  probably the finest piece of Roman engraved silver found in these  islands, an oblong dish measuring 15 x 19 inches, weighing 148 ounces,  and ornamented with figures of deities from classical mythology. That  all five pieces belonged together can hardly be doubted, though it cannot  be proved outright. That they all belong to the later Roman period, and  probably to the fourth century, seems highly probable. Whether they were  buried in the river-bank to conceal them from raiders or were lost from  a boat or otherwise, is not now discoverable. But the occurrence of  such silver close to the Roman Wall is in itself notable. It is to be  attributed rather to a Roman officer residing in or passing through  Corbridge than to either a Romanized Briton or a Pictish looter.    Apart from its findspot, the Lanx is important for its excellent art and  for the place which it seems to hold in the history of later Greek art.  It is, of course, not Romano-British work; it is purely Greek in all its  details and no doubt of Greek workmanship. The deities figured on it  have long been a puzzle. They are evidently classical deities; three of  them, indeed, are Apollo, Artemis, and Athena. But the identity of the  other two figures and the meaning of the whole scene have been much  disputed. Roger Gale, the first to attempt its unravelment, suggested  in 1735 that it was 'just an assemblage of deities', and at one time I  inclined to this view--that we had here merely (let us say) a tea-party  at Apollo's; Dr. Drexel, too, wrote to me lately to express the same  idea. But I must confess that nearly all the best archaeologists demand  a definite mythological identification, and my colleague, Prof. Gardner,  suggests a new view--that the scene is the so-called Judgement of  Paris. This mythological incident was often depicted in ancient art,  and--strange as it may sound--in the later versions Paris was not seldom  omitted, Apollo was made arbiter, and the scene was removed from Mount  Ida to Delphi.[11] The two hitherto disputable figures are, Prof.  Gardner thinks, Hera (seated) and Aphrodite (standing, with a long  sceptre). He ascribes the work to the third or early part of the fourth  century, and believes that it was made in the Eastern Empire; from the  prominence granted to Artemis, he conjectures that Ephesus may have been  its origin. But he adds that he would not be sure that the artist of the  piece, while copying a Judgement of Paris, was consciously aware of the  meaning of the original before him. His views will be published in  fuller detail in the _Journal of Hellenic Studies_.    [Footnote 11: Compare the Roman provincial bas-reliefs of Actaeon  surprising Diana, with Actaeon omitted (R. Cagnat, _Archaeological  Journal_, lxiv. 42).]    I am glad, further, to have been able to illustrate this paper by what I  believe to be a better illustration of the Lanx than has been published  before, and also to set out in more accurate fashion the curious legal  history of the object after it was found.    (29) In the new _History of Northumberland_, issued by the Northumberland  County History Committee in vol. x (edited by Mr. H. H. Craster,  Newcastle, 1914, pp. 455-522) I have given a long account of the known  Roman remains in Corbridge parish. These are the settlement of  Corstopitum, a small stretch of Roman road and another of the Roman  Wall, and the fort of Halton (Hunnum) on the Wall. The account is  necessarily historical rather than archaeological; it tries to sum up  the finds and estimate their historical bearing, and it also catalogues  all the inscribed and sculptured stones found at Corbridge and Halton,  with the 'literature' relating to them. Mr. Knowles contributes a plan  of the Corbridge excavations to the end of 1912.    (30) The Corbridge excavations of 1913 are described by Mr. R. H.  Forster, who was in personal charge of the work, Mr. W. H. Knowles, and  myself, in _Archaeologia Aeliana_ (third series, 1914, xi. 279-310);  see also a short account by myself in the _Proceedings of the Society of  Antiquaries of London_ (xxvi. 185-9). The discoveries were comparatively  few; they comprised some ill-preserved and mostly insignificant  buildings on the north side of the site, some ditches, and a stretch of  the road leading to the north (Dere Street). Among small objects were an  interesting but imperfect altar to 'Panthea ...', a bronze 'balsamarium'  showing a puzzling variety of barbarian's head, and another piece of the  Corbridge grey _applique_ ware. A short account of the excavations of  1914 (see above, p. 9) is contained in the _Journal of the British  Archaeological Association_ (xx. 343).    (31) The _Proceedings of the Berwick Naturalists' Club_ (vol. xxxii,  part 2) print an agreeable paper by Mr. James Curle, describing Dere  Street and some Roman posts on it between Tyne and Tweed.      _Notts._    [Illustration: FIG. 23. ROMAN SITE NEAR EAST BRIDGEFORD, NOTTS. (No.  32)]    [Illustration: FIG. 24. DECORATION OF ENAMELLED SEAL-BOX.]    (32) About ten miles east from Nottingham, and a mile south of the  village of East Bridgeford, the Fosse-way crosses a Roman site which has  usually been identified with the Margidunum of the Antonine Itinerary.  Lately excavation has been attempted, and the _Antiquary_ of December  1914 contains an interesting account of the results attained up to the  end of 1913, with some illustrations.[12] A very broad earthwork and  ditch surround an area of 7 acres, rhomboidal in shape (fig. 23).  In this area the excavators, Drs. Felix Oswald and T. D. Pryce, have  turned up floor-tesserae, roof-slates, flue-tiles, window-glass, painted  wall-plaster, potsherds of the first and later centuries, including a  black bowl with a well-modelled figure of Mercury in relief, coins  ranging down to the end of the fourth century (Eugenius), and other  small objects of interest, such as the small seal-box with Late-Celtic  enamel, shown in fig. 24. No foundations _in situ _have yet come to  light, but that is doubtless to follow; only a tiny part of the whole  area has, as yet, been touched. Margidunum may have begun as a fort  coeval with the Fosse-way, which (if I am right) dates from the earliest  years of the Roman Conquest. Whether any of the first-century potsherds  as yet found there can be assigned to these years (say A.D. 45-75) is  not clear. But the excavations plainly deserve to be continued.    [Footnote 12: By the courtesy of the publisher of the _Antiquary_, Mr.  Elliot Stock, I am able to reproduce two of these illustrations (figs.  23, 24).]      _Shropshire_    (33) Mr. Bushe-Fox's second Report on his excavations at Wroxeter  (_Reports of the Research Committee of the London Society of  Antiquaries_, No. II, Oxford, 1914) deserves all the praise accorded  to his first Report. I can only repeat what I said of that; it is an  excellent description, full and careful, minute in its account of the  smaller finds, lavishly illustrated, admirably printed, and sold for  half a crown. The finds which it enumerates in detail I summarized in  my Report for 1913, pp. 19-20--the temple with its interesting Italian  plan, the fragments of sculpture which seem to belong to it, the crowd  of small objects, the masses of Samian (indefatigably recorded), the 528  coins; all combine to make up an admirable pamphlet.

THE PODIUM, AS SEEN FROM THE NORTH    (The measuring staff to the right stands in the _cella_, the floor of  which is slightly higher than that of the portico to the left of it)]    [Illustration: FIG. 28. EAST WALL OF PODIUM, COURSED MASONRY WITH CLAY  AND RUBBLE FOUNDATIONS]    I will venture a suggestion on the temple. This, as I pointed out last  year, is on the Italian, not on the Celto-Roman plan. But one item is  not quite clear in it. All ordinary classical temples stood on _podia_  or platforms which raised them above the surrounding surface at least to  some small extent. Mr. Bushe-Fox speaks of a _podium_ to the Wroxeter  temple. But it appears that he does not mean a _podium_, as generally  understood. The masonry which he"]]]
