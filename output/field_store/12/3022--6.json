It may be thought that forests are an exception to this rule, since in  the north-temperate and arctic regions we find extensive forests of  pines or of oaks. But these are, after all, exceptional, and  characterise those regions only where the climate is little favourable  to forest vegetation. In the tropical and all the warm temperate parts  of the earth, where there is a sufficient supply of moisture, the  forests present the same variety of species as does the turf of our old  pastures; and in the equatorial virgin forests there is so great a  variety of forms, and they are so thoroughly intermingled, that the  traveller often finds it difficult to discover a second specimen of any  particular species which he has noticed. Even the forests of the  temperate zones, in all favourable situations, exhibit a considerable  variety of trees of distinct genera and families, and it is only when we  approach the outskirts of forest vegetation, where either drought or  winds or the severity of the winter is adverse to the existence of most  trees, that we find extensive tracts monopolised by one or two species.  Even Canada has more than sixty different forest trees and the Eastern  United States a hundred and fifty; Europe is rather poor, containing  about eighty trees only; while the forests of Eastern Asia, Japan, and  Manchuria are exceedingly rich, about a hundred and seventy species  being already known. And in all these countries the trees grow  intermingled, so that in every extensive forest we have a considerable  variety, as may be seen in the few remnants of our primitive woods in  some parts of Epping Forest and the New Forest.    Among animals the same law prevails, though, owing to their constant  movements and power of concealment, it is not so readily observed. As  illustrations we may refer to the wolf, ranging over Europe and Northern  Asia, while the jackal inhabits Southern Asia and Northern Africa; the  tree-porcupines, of which there are two closely allied species, one  inhabiting the eastern, the other the western half of North America; the  common hare (Lepus timidus) in Central and Southern Europe, while all  Northern Europe is inhabited by the variable hare (Lepus variabilis);  the common jay (Garrulus glandarius) inhabiting all Europe, while  another species (Garrulus Brandti) is found all across Asia from the  Urals to Japan; and many species of birds in the Eastern United States  are replaced by closely allied species in the west. Of course there are  also numbers of closely related species in the same country, but it will  almost always be found that they frequent different stations and have  somewhat different habits, and so do not come into direct competition  with each other; just as closely allied plants may inhabit the same  districts, when one prefers meadows the other woods, one a chalky soil  the other sand, one a damp situation the other a dry one. With plants,  fixed as they are to the earth, we easily note these peculiarities of  station; but with wild animals, which we see only on rare occasions, it  requires close and long-continued observation to detect the  peculiarities in their mode of life which may prevent all direct  competition between closely allied species dwelling in the same area.      _The Ethical Aspect of the Struggle for Existence_.    Our exposition of the phenomena presented by the struggle for existence  may be fitly concluded by a few remarks on its ethical aspect. Now that  the war of nature is better known, it has been dwelt upon by many  writers as presenting so vast an amount of cruelty and pain as to be  revolting to our instincts of humanity, while it has proved a  stumbling-block in the way of those who would fain believe in an  all-wise and benevolent ruler of the universe. Thus, a brilliant writer  says: \"Pain, grief, disease, and death, are these the inventions of a  loving God? That no animal shall rise to excellence except by being  fatal to the life of others, is this the law of a kind Creator? It is  useless to say that pain has its benevolence, that massacre has its  mercy. Why is it so ordained that bad should be the raw material of  good? Pain is not the less pain because it is useful; murder is not less  murder because it is conducive to development. Here is blood upon the  hand still, and all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten it.\"[13]    Even so thoughtful a writer as Professor Huxley adopts similar views. In  a recent article on \"The Struggle for Existence\" he speaks of the  myriads of generations of herbivorous animals which \"have been tormented  and devoured by carnivores\"; of the carnivores and herbivores alike  \"subject to all the miseries incidental to old age, disease, and  over-multiplication\"; and of the \"more or less enduring suffering,\"  which is the meed of both vanquished and victor. And he concludes that,  since thousands of times a minute, were our ears sharp enough, we should  hear sighs and groans of pain like those heard by Dante at the gate of  hell, the world cannot be governed by what we call benevolence.[14]    Now there is, I think, good reason to believe that all this is greatly  exaggerated; that the supposed \"torments\" and \"miseries\" of animals have  little real existence, but are the reflection of the imagined sensations  of cultivated men and women in similar circumstances; and that the  amount of actual suffering caused by the struggle for existence among  animals is altogether insignificant. Let us, therefore, endeavour to  ascertain what are the real facts on which these tremendous accusations  are founded.    In the first place, we must remember that animals are entirely spared  the pain we suffer in the anticipation of death--a pain far greater, in  most cases, than the reality. This leads, probably, to an almost  perpetual enjoyment of their lives; since their constant watchfulness  against danger, and even their actual flight from an enemy, will be the  enjoyable exercise of the powers and faculties they possess, unmixed  with any serious dread. There is, in the next place, much evidence to  show that violent deaths, if not too prolonged, are painless and easy;  even in the case of man, whose nervous system is in all probability much  more susceptible to pain than that of most animals. In all cases in  which persons have escaped after being seized by a lion or tiger, they  declare that they suffered little or no pain, physical or mental. A  well-known instance is that of Livingstone, who thus describes his  sensations when seized by a lion: \"Starting and looking half round, I  saw the lion just in the act of springing on me. I was upon a little  height; he caught my shoulder as he sprang, and we both came to the  ground below together. Growling horribly close to my ear, he shook me as  a terrier-dog does a rat. The shock produced a stupor similar to that  which seems to be felt by a mouse after the first shake of the cat. It  causes a sort of dreaminess, _in which there was no sense of pain or  feeling of terror_, though I was quite conscious of all that was  happening. It was like what patients partially under the influence of  chloroform describe, who see all the operation, but feel not the knife.  This singular condition was not the result of any mental process. The  shake annihilated fear, and allowed no sense of horror in looking round  at the beast.\"    This absence of pain is not peculiar to those seized by wild beasts, but  is equally produced by any accident which causes a general shock to the  system. Mr. Whymper describes an accident to himself during one of his  preliminary explorations of the Matterhorn, when he fell several hundred  feet, bounding from rock to rock, till fortunately embedded in a  snow-drift near the edge of a tremendous precipice. He declares that  while falling and feeling blow after blow, he neither lost consciousness  nor suffered pain, merely thinking, calmly, that a few more blows would  finish him. We have therefore a right to conclude, that when death  follows soon after any great shock it is as easy and painless a death as  possible; and this is certainly what happens when an animal is seized by  a beast of prey. For the enemy is one which hunts for food, not for  pleasure or excitement; and it is doubtful whether any carnivorous  animal in a state of nature begins to seek after prey till driven to do  so by hunger. When an animal is caught, therefore, it is very soon  devoured, and thus the first shock is followed by an almost painless  death. Neither do those which die of cold or hunger suffer much. Cold is  generally severest at night and has a tendency to produce sleep and  painless extinction. Hunger, on the other hand, is hardly felt during  periods of excitement, and when food is scarce the excitement of seeking  for it is at its greatest. It is probable, also, that when hunger  presses, most animals will devour anything to stay their hunger, and  will die of gradual exhaustion and weakness not necessarily painful, if  they do not fall an earlier prey to some enemy or to cold.[15]    Now let us consider what are the enjoyments of the lives of most  animals. As a rule they come into existence at a time of year when food  is most plentiful and the climate most suitable, that is in the spring  of the temperate zone and at the commencement of the dry season in the  tropics. They grow vigorously, being supplied with abundance of food;  and when they reach maturity their lives are a continual round of  healthy excitement and exercise, alternating with complete repose. The  daily search for the daily food employs all their faculties and  exercises every organ of their bodies, while this exercise leads to the  satisfaction of all their physical needs. In our own case, we can give  no more perfect definition of happiness, than this exercise and this  satisfaction; and we must therefore"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14586"],[0,"The Brain, A Decoded Enigma (#11)"],[1," cannot be  destroyed by any hardware or software facility of the brain. So, a punishment  has no effect.    If a brain has a hardware problem, there is no solution to correct it. The  main reason is the fact that any model is connected with almost all the models  of the brain. Even XZMs must have some connections. In order to remove a model  by external action, it is necessary to know the exact hardware structure of  that brain and this, as I think, will be not possible at least in the next 50  years.    C1 asserts also the condition that the brain must not contain ordinary models  (O.M.). This condition is necessary because if an O.M. is included in PSM,  that model becomes invariant (it cannot be changed by any information from the  external reality). So, if an O.M. is included in PSM, any information obtained  by IR from external reality must be compatible with that OMPSM. If not, that  information must be distorted to meet, somehow, the condition requested by the  OMPSM. When there is an OMPSM in the brain, this is an illness called  \"paranoia\".    A person with an OMPSM must distort the information obtained from external  reality to meet the conditions requested by the OMPSM.    Example: The authentic communists have included in PSM the OMPSM called \"the  working class is the leader of the society\". Regardless of the external  reality, they have a harmonic/logic structure of models based on this model.  Fortunately, the absolute majority of the communists have no such model  included in PSM and so, they are normal persons.    Example: Usually, drugs create an OMPSM called \"use them\". Such persons will  continue to use drugs regardless of any information associated with their  negative effects. This is a special kind of paranoia.    Example: smoking is also a form of paranoia, due to the same reason, as above.  After many years of smoking, some persons can give up smoking. This could  happen if, for instance, the person gets ill. The illness could make a non-  smoking model, which enters the PSM too.    The C3-condition states that the whole structure of models must be  harmonic/logic. This condition is not easy to meet. First of all, there is a  limited capacity to refresh the whole structure of models. The refresh  capacity for some persons could be under the requirements. Such persons could  evolve to a form of schizophrenia.    Let's consider now a person-A, who meets the C3 criterium. At one moment, an  important model becomes useless (for instance, an important person B  disappears from the life of A). In such case, person-A has to refresh the  whole structure of models. This task could exceed the technical capacity of  refresh (mainly for older persons).    It the refresh capacity is exceeded, one possibility is to make shielding  models. If a person has too many shielding models, such a person cannot be  considered as a normal person. Such persons can be detected, e.g. due to the  fact that they don't want, or they cannot discuss about some subjects.    XZM models are not taken into account because of the lack of enough data about  them. XZMs can explain the somnambulistic-effect, multiple personalities or  even some nonsense crimes.    There are killers who don't know why they kill other people. Many of them seem  to be normal persons, as their friends can confirm and also they can be  integrated in society. XZMs can be an explanation for their crimes. Indeed, an  XZM is a model which is out of the control of the normal structure of models.  Such models can become active-models in some situations (due to the hardware  problems of that brain). The killer is so \"remotely-controlled\" by the XZM.    Such killers cannot be detected by a lie detector. The explanation is the fact  that there is no normal model that makes the crime and so, there is no reason  to pretend or hide something.    As I said, this section is just for evaluation. As new data will be obtained  in association with XZMs, the section will be developed.        THE ABSTRACT OF THE FUNCTIONAL FACILITIES OF A BRAIN      Let's make an abstract about all the functional facilities of a human brain.  Almost all the facilities, which are not related with symbolic-models, are the  same for animals.    BF1: To make models associated or not with a section of the external reality    BF2: To refresh, on and on, the M-models by prediction and comparison with IR,  so that M-models reflect better and better the dynamic external reality.    BF3: The continuous self-refreshing of some ZM coupled with M-models. The goal  is that these ZM-models reflect better and better the external reality. For  this, ZM must take into account any other ZM-model of the brain as well.    BF4: To simulate, continuously, the possible evolution of the associated  external reality, even when a ZM is not connected to M-models.    BF5: One of the main conditions, which must be fulfilled by any model, is to  become stable (harmonic or logic). That is, any simulation on a model must  reconfirm the model in the same shape. If a disharmony or logical  contradiction is detected, the model must regain its stability by IR (from  external reality or from other models). Moreover, as any model is already  integrated in a structure of models, any other model must accept any result of  any simulation on any model. This condition ensures the general stability of a  structure of models. A real brain does not easily meet this condition.    BF6: Any ZMs are able to activate, in time sharing, many ZAM models to do many  activities. However, there is a single ZAM which can act on the external  reality at a given moment of time. The reason for it is that, before  activation, any model needs to initialize using data taken from external  reality. When a ZAM is deactivated, it needs to store data for future  reactivation. This method is fast, but if external reality is changed too  much, such data is no more valid. In this case, the activated ZAM has to find  the new conditions of initialization, based on ZMs. The brain uses both  methods. By description of the process, we see that it is not easy to do many  activities at the same time (in time-sharing), and it is easy to make  mistakes.    BF7: The facility of any model to gain information from any other model of the  brain. However, due to the technological implementation, it is possible that  some models have a better communications with some models, and not as easy  communication with other models.    BF8: Any model has the facility to develop any of its elements as models.  Thus, it is possible to have a nested structure of models. The \"depth\" of this  structure has only technological limitations.    These facilities generate the knowledge and the consciousness, based on a  structure of stable (harmonic or logic) models. Such structure is able to  self-develop in an unknown external reality.    For a given brain, in interaction with an external reality, there are a number  of features which will be described now. That is, as a brain has many modes of  interaction with external reality, a particular brain could use mostly only  some of them, as follows:    SF1: If there is a difference between reality (prediction) and the external  reality (IR), a brain has some possibilities:    SF1.1: to correct the model based on IR (knowledge)  SF1.2: to modify the external reality (creativity)  SF1.3: to store IR in a story-type model  SF1.4: to ignore or to forget that IR    SF2: When a model is \"correct\", but it cannot be integrated in the structure  of models, there are some possibilities:    SF2.1: to make a shielding model (the external reality is considered as wrong)  SF2.2: to modify the whole structure of models (knowledge at any price, but  sometimes this can exceed the technical possibilities of a given brain).  SF2.3: to modify the model (i.e. to distort the importance of some elements or  relations so that, the modified model can be accepted by the structure). When  this procedure is followed, we have a paranoiac behavior.  SF2.4: the model with problems is ignored, or it is recorded as a story-type  model.    SF3: when there is an external reality and no suitable model, there are some  possibilities:  SF3.1: to create a suitable model, initiated by PSM  SF3.2: to ignore that external reality  SF3.3: to record that external reality based on a set of more or less  fragmented story-type models.      THE PERSONALITY (HUMAN ONLY)    The personality is treated here for human beings only. However, some  characteristics (which are not related in a direct or indirect way with the  symbolic models), are about the same for animals.    The personality is given by the whole structure of models of a given human  being. We shall develop this very complex concept. To do this, at the  beginning, we shall see a number of features in a rather random way and then,  based on these descriptions, we shall list some important parameters which  characterize the personality.    We know from the general theory that any brain makes models and simulates the  possible evolution of these models. There are no restrictions in connection  with the aims or goals of such simulations. Even for a simple model, the  number of different simulations could be high. Of course, a model will not  make all the possible simulations.    A characteristic of the personality is associated with this diversity of aims  and goals of any model.    A structure of models could evolve in a chaotic way, out of control. Another  parameter of the personality is associated with the capability to control such  a diversity of evolution of a structure of models.    As we know from the general theory, the stability in a model is a brain  quality parameter. Thus, the aims and goals of any model have to be controlled  by a limited number of long-range models. Without such long-range models, the  structure can evolve in a chaotic way (this is a form of schizophrenia).    Faced with a new external reality,"]]]
