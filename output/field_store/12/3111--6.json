It would  be a grave error to believe that the rules were overturned, for,  instead, new principles were added to old ones as new conditions  demanded. They learned how to modulate, how to transpose from one key to  the next key and finally to the keys farthest away. In his treatise on  harmony Fetis studied this evolution in a masterly manner. Unfortunately  his scholarship was not combined with deep musical feeling. For example,  he saw faults in Mozart and Beethoven where there are only beauties, and  beauties which even an ignorant listener--if he is naturally  musical--will see without trouble. He did not understand the vast  difference between the unlettered person who commits a solecism and  Pascal, the inventor of a new syntax.    However that may be, Fetis gave us a comprehensive review in broad  outlines of musical evolution down to what he justly called the  \"omnitonic system,\" which Richard Wagner has achieved since. \"Beyond  that,\" he said, \"I can see nothing more.\"    He did not foresee the a-tonic system, but that is what we have come to.  There is no longer any question of adding to the old rules new  principles which are the natural expression of time and experience, but  simply of casting aside all rules and every restraint.    \"Everyone ought to make his own rules. Music is free and unlimited in  its liberty of expression. There are no perfect chords, dissonant chords  or false chords. All aggregations of notes are legitimate.\"    That is called, and they believe it, the _development of taste_.    He whose taste is developed by this system is not like the man who by  tasting a wine can tell you its age and its vineyard, but he is rather  like the fellow who with perfect indifference gulps down good or bad  wine, brandy or whiskey, and prefers that which burns his gullet the  most. The man who gets his work hung in the Salon is not the one who  puts on his canvas delicate touches in harmonious tones, but he who  juxtaposes vermillion and Veronese green. The man with a \"developed  taste\" is not the one who knows how to get new and unexpected results by  passing from one key to another, as the great Richard did in _Die  Meistersinger_, but rather the man who abandons all keys and piles up  dissonances which he neither introduces nor concludes and who, as a  result, grunts his way through music as a pig through a flower garden.    Possibly they may go farther still. There seems to be no reason why they  should linger on the way to untrammeled freedom or restrict themselves  within a scale. The boundless empire of sound is at their disposal and  let them profit by it. That is what dogs do when they bay at the moon,  cats when they meow, and the birds when they sing. A German has written  a book to prove that the birds sing false. Of course he is wrong for  they do not sing false. If they did, their song would not sound  agreeable to us. They sing outside of scales and it is delightful, but  that is not man-made art.    Some Spanish singers give a similar impression, through singing  interminable grace notes beyond notation. Their art is intermediate  between the singing of the birds and of man. It is not a higher art.    In certain quarters they marvel at the progress made in the last thirty  years. The architects of the Fifteenth Century must have reasoned in the  same way. They did not appreciate that they were assassinating Gothic  art, and that after some centuries we would have to revert to the art of  the Greeks and Romans.          CHAPTER X    THE ORGAN      When hairy Pan joined reeds of different lengths and so invented the  flute which bears his name, he was, in reality, creating the organ. It  needed only to add to this flute a keyboard and bellows to make one of  those pretty instruments the first painters used to put in the hands of  angels. As it developed and gradually became the most grandiose of the  instruments, the organ, with its depth of tone modified and increased  tenfold by the resonance of the great cathedrals, took on its religious  character.    The organ is more than a single instrument. It is an orchestra, a  collection of the pipes of Pan of every size, from those as small as a  child's playthings to those as gigantic as the columns of a temple. Each  one corresponds to what is termed an organ-stop. The number is  unlimited.    The Romans made organs which must have been simple from the musical  standpoint, though they were complicated in their mechanical  construction. They were called hydraulic organs. The employment of water  in a wind instrument has greatly perplexed the commentators.  Cavaille-Coll studied the question and solved the problem by  demonstrating that the water compressed the air. This system was  ingenious but imperfect, since it was applicable only to the most  primitive instruments. The keys, it seems, were very large, and were  struck by blows of the fist.    Let us leave erudition for art and primitive for perfected instruments.  By the time of Sebastian Bach and Rameau the organ had taken on its  grandiose character. The stops had multiplied and the organist _called_  them by means of registers which he drew out or pushed back at will. In  order to give greater resources, the builder multiplied the keyboards.  Pedals were introduced to help out the keyboards. At that time Germany  alone had pedals worthy of the name and worth while in playing an  interesting bass part. In France and elsewhere the rudimentary pedals  were only used for certain fundamental notes or in prolonged _tenutos_.  No one outside of Germany could play Sebastian Bach's compositions.    Playing on the old instruments was fatiguing and uncomfortable. The  touch was heavy and, when one used both the pedals and the keyboards, a  real display of strength was necessary. A similar display was necessary  to draw out or push back the registers, some of which were beyond the  player's reach. In short, an assistant was necessary, in fact several  assistants in playing large organs like those at Harlem or Arnheim in  Holland. It was almost impossible to modify the combinations of stops.  All nuances, save the abrupt change from strong to soft and vice versa,  were impossible.    It remained for Cavaille-Coll to change all this and open up new fields  of usefulness for the organ. He introduced in France keyboards worthy of  the name, and he gave to the higher notes, through his invention of  harmonic stops, a brilliancy they had lacked. He invented wonderful  combinations which allow the organist to change his combinations and to  vary the tone, without the aid of an assistant and without leaving the  keyboard. Even before his day a scheme had been devised of enclosing  certain stops in a box protected by shutters which a pedal opened and  closed at will; this permitted the finest shadings. By different  processes the touch of the organ was made as delicate as that of the  piano.    For some years the Swiss organ-makers have been inventing new facilities  which make the organist a sort of magician. The manifold resources of  the marvellous instrument are at his command, obedient to his slightest  wish.    These resources are prodigious. The compass of the organ far surpasses  that of all the instruments of the orchestra. The violin notes alone  reach the same height, but with little carrying power. As for the lower  tones, there is no competitor of the thirty-two-foot pipes, which go two  octaves below the violoncello's low C. Between the _pianissimo_ which  almost reaches the limit where sound ceases and silence begins, down to  a range of formidable and terrifying power, every degree of intensity  can be obtained from this magical instrument. The variety of its timbre  is broad. There are flute stops of various kinds; tonal stops that  approximate the timbre of stringed instruments; stops for effecting  changes in which each note, formed from several pipes, bring out  simultaneously its fundamental and harmonic sounds; stops which serve to  imitate the instruments of the orchestra, such as the trumpet, the  clarinet, and the cremona (an obsolete instrument with a timbre peculiar  to itself) and the bassoon. There are celestial voices of several kinds,  produced by combinations of two simultaneous stops which are not tuned  in perfect unison. Then we have the famous _Vox Humana_, a favorite with  the public, which is alluring even though it is tremulous and nasal, and  we have the innumerable combinations of all these different stops, with  the gradations that may be obtained through indefinite commingling of  the tones of this marvellous palette.    Add to all this the continual breathing of the monster's lungs which  gives the sounds an incomparable and inimitable steadiness. Human  beings were used for a long time to fill these lungs--blowers working  away with hands and feet. We do much better now. The great organ in  Albert Hall, London, is supplied with air by steam which assures the  organist an inexhaustible supply. Other instruments use gas engines  which are more manageable. Then, there is the hydraulic system, which is  very powerful and easily used, for one has only to pull out a plug to  set the bellows in motion.    These mechanical systems, however, are not entirely free from accidents.  I discovered that fact when I was concluding the first part of the  _Adagio_ in Liszt's great _Fantaisie_ in the beautiful Victoria Hall in  Geneva. The pipe which brought in the water burst and the organ was  mute. I have always thought, perhaps wrongly, that malice had something  to do with the accident.    This Liszt _Fantaisie_ is the most extraordinary piece for the organ  there is. It lasts forty minutes and the interest is sustained  throughout. Just as Mozart in his _Fantaisie et Sonate in C minor_  foresaw the modern piano, so Liszt, writing this _Fantaisie_ more than  half a century ago, appears to have foreseen the instrument of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16462"],[0,"With the Boer Forces (#11)"],[1,"over the field-cornets and the generals over  the commandants, but whether the authority was of any value could not be  ascertained until after the will of those in lower rank was discovered. By  this extraordinary process it happened that every burgher was a general  and that no general was greater than a burgher.    [Illustration: ELECTING A FIELD-CORNET]    The military officers of the Boers, with the exception of the  Commandant-General, were the same men who ruled the country in times of  peace. War suddenly transformed pruning-hooks into swords, and  conservators of peace into leaders of armies. The head of the army was the  Commandant-General, who was invested with full power to direct operations  and lead men.    Directly under his authority were the Assistant Commandant-Generals, five  of whom were appointed by the Volksraad a short time before the beginning  of hostilities. Then in rank were those who were called Vecht-Generals, or  fighting generals, in order to distinguish them from the  Assistant-Generals. Then followed the Commandants, the leaders of the  field-cornets of one district, whose rank was about that of colonels. The  field-cornets, who were in command of the men of a ward, were under the  authority of a commandant, and ranked on a par with majors. The burghers  of every ward were subdivided into squads of about twenty-five men under  the authority of a corporal, whose rank was equal to that of a lieutenant.  There were no corps, brigades, regiments, and companies to call for  hundreds of officers; it was merely a commando, whether it had ten men or  ten thousand, and neither the subdivision nor the augmentation of a force  affected the list of officers in any way. Nor would such a multiplication  of officers weaken the fighting strength of a force, for every officer,  from Commandant-General to corporal, carried and used a rifle in every  battle.    When the officers had their men on the field, and desired to make a  forward movement or an attack on the enemy, it was necessary to hold a  Krijgsraad, or council of war, and this was conducted in such a novel way  that the most unmilitary burgher's voice bore almost as much weight as  that of the Commandant-General. Every officer, from corporal to  Commandant-General, was a member of the Krijgsraad, and when a plan was  favoured by the majority of those present at the council it became a law.  The result of a Krijgsraad meeting did not necessarily imply that it was  the plan favoured by the best military minds at the council, for it was  possible and legal for the opinions of sixteen corporals to be adopted  although fifteen generals and commandants opposed the plan with all their  might. That there ever was such a result is problematical, but there were  many Krijgsraads at which the opinion of the best and most experienced  officers were cast aside by the votes of field-cornets and corporals. It  undoubtedly was a representative way of adopting the will of the people,  but it frequently was exceedingly costly. At the Krijgsraad in Natal which  determined to abandon the positions along the Tugela, and retire north of  Ladysmith the project was bitterly opposed by the generals who had done  the bravest and best fighting in the colony, but the votes of the  corporals, field-cornets, and commandants outnumbered theirs, and there  was nothing for the generals to do but to retire and allow Ladysmith to be  relieved. At Mafeking scores of Krijgsraad were held for the purpose of  arriving at a determination to storm the town, but invariably the  field-cornets and corporals out-voted the commandants and generals and  refused to risk the lives of their men in such a hazardous attack. Even  the oft-repeated commands of the Commandant-General to storm Mafeking were  treated with contempt by the majority of the Krijgsraad who constituted  the highest military authority in the country so far as they and their  actions were concerned. When there happened to be a deadlock in the  balloting at a Krijgsraad it was more than once the case that the vote of  the Commandant-General counted for less than the voice of a burgher. In  one of the minor Krijgsraads in Natal there was a tie in the voting, which  was ended when an old burgher called his corporal aside and influenced him  to change his vote. The Commandant-General himself had not been able to  change the result of the voting, but the old burgher who had no connection  with the council of war practically determined the result of the meeting.    The Krijgsraad was the supreme military authority in the country, and its  resolutions were the law, all its infractions being punishable by fines.  The minority of a Krijgsraad was obliged to assist in executing the plans  of the majority, however impracticable or distasteful they might have been  to those whose opinions did not prevail. There were innumerable instances  where generals and commandants attended a Krijgsraad and afterward acted  quite contrary to the resolution adopted by the council. In any other army  such action would have been called disobedience of orders, with the  corresponding punishment, but in the Boer army it amounted to little  beyond personal animosity. According to Boer military law an officer  offending in such a manner should have been arraigned before the  Krijgsraad and tried by his fellow officers, but such occurrences were  extremely rare.    One of the few instances where a man was arraigned before a Krijgsraad for  dereliction of duty was after the enemy succeeded in damaging one of the  \"Long Tom's\" around Ladysmith.    The artillery officer who was in charge of the gun when the dynamite was  exploded in its muzzle was convicted of neglect of duty and was disgraced  before the army. After the battle of Belmont Vecht-General Jacob Prinsloo,  of the Free State, was court-martialled for cowardice and was reduced to  the rank of burgher. It was Prinsloo's first battle, and he was thoroughly  frightened. When some of his men came up to him and asked him for  directions to repel the advancing British force Prinsloo trembled, rubbed  his hands, and replied: \"God only knows; I don't,\" and fled with all his  men at his heels.    Two instances where commandants acted contrary to the decisions of  Krijgsraad were the costly disobedience of General Erasmus, at Dundee, and  the still more costly mistake of Commandant Buis at Hlangwe. When the  Boers invaded Natal and determined to attack the British forces then  stationed at the town of Dundee, it was decided at a Krijgsraad that  General Lucas Meyer should attack from the east and south, and General  Erasmus from the north. General Meyer occupied Talana Hill, east of  Dundee, and a kopje south of the town, and attacked General Penn-Symons's  forces at daybreak. General Erasmus and the Pretoria commando, with field  pieces and a \"Long Tom,\" occupied Impati Mountain on the north, but when  the time arrived for him to assist in the attack on the enemy several  hundred yards below him he would not allow one shot to be fired. As a  result of the miscarriage of plans General Meyer was compelled to retire  from Talana Hill in the afternoon, while the British force was enabled to  escape southward into Ladysmith. If General Erasmus had followed the  decision of the Krijgsraad, and had assisted in the attack, there is  hardly any doubt that the entire force of the enemy would have been  captured. Even more disastrous was the disobedience of Commandant Buis, of  the Heidelberg commando, who was ordered to occupy a certain point on the  Boschrand, called Hlangwe, about February 19th. The British had tried for  several weeks to drive the Boers from the Boschrand, but all their  attempts proved fruitless. A certain commando had been holding Hlangwe for  a long time, and Commandant Buis was ordered to take his commando and  relieve the others by night. Instead of going to Hlangwe immediately that  night he bivouacked in a small nek near by, intending to occupy the  position early the following morning. During the night the British  discovered that the point was unoccupied and placed a strong force  there. In this manner the British wedge was forced into the Boschrand, and  shortly afterwards the Boers were obliged to retreat across the Tugela and  secure positions on the north bank of the stream. Of less serious  consequence was General De la Rey's refusal to carry out a decision he  himself had assisted in framing. It was at Brandfort, in the Free State,  several weeks after Bloemfontein was occupied, and all the Boer generals  in the vicinity met in Krijgsraad and voted to make a concerted attack  upon the British force at Tafelkop, midway between Bloemfontein and  Brandfort. Generals Smuts and Botha made a long night trek to the  positions from which they were to attack the enemy at daybreak. It had  been arranged that General De la Rey's commando should open the attack  from another point, and that no operations should begin until after he had  given a certain signal. The signal was never given, and, after waiting for  it several hours, the other generals returned to Brandfort only to find  that General De la Rey had not even moved from his laager.    When the lower ranks of officers--the field-cornets and  corporals--disobeyed the mandates of the Krijgsraads, displayed cowardice  or misbehaved in any other manner, the burghers under their command were  able to impeach them and elect other officers to fill the vacancies. The  corporals were elected by the burghers after war was begun, and they held  their posts only so long as their behaviour met with the favour of those  who placed them in authority. During the first three months of the war  innumerable changes of that nature were made, and not infrequently was it  the case that a corporal was unceremoniously dismissed because he had  offended one of his men who happened to wield much influence over his  fellows in the commando."]]]
