Such are the various parts of this work; their union forms the most  sublime harmony, and each in particular brings a divine note to this  celestial concert. By what process was this picture produced? We can  scarcely say, so greatly does the inspiration predominate over the  technique.    Raphael aimed at the sublime; and the rest was given to him as increase.  The colour is just what it should be in such a subject; whilst keeping  to a sweet, calm, and peaceful scale, it is resplendent with light, and  we ask ourselves whether it is not the hand of an angel rather than that  of a man that has been able to realize such a marvel.    The _Virgin of St. Sixtus_ is the most beautiful picture in the world.  To copy this Virgin is to attempt the impossible. Study it a hundred  times and a hundred times it will reveal itself under a new aspect. It  was before this picture, it is said, that Correggio cried: \"And I also,  I am a painter.\"    The _Virgin of St. Sixtus_ was immediately placed where it was meant to  be; it was present in triumph every day for two hundred and thirty-six  years at the divine sacrament; and never was a human work so worthy of  that signal honour.    In 1734 the degenerate monks of St. Sixtus preferred a little gold to  their inestimable masterpiece, and for a miserable sum of a hundred and  some thousands of francs (110,000 to 120,000), they sold their Virgin to  Augustus III., Elector of Saxony and King of Poland. That day the  barbarians were not those the Italians think....    At Dresden, the Madonna was received with great pomp. Augustus III. had  it brought in haste into the reception hall of his palace; as the place  of honour was occupied by the throne, he, himself, seized the royal  chair, and relegating it to a less conspicuous station, he cried: \"Room  for the great Raphael.\" If this is historic, it does honour to the  prince; if legendary, it is to the glory of the people whose sentiment  it translates.        _Les Vierges de Raphael_ (Paris, 1869).          THE DREAM OF ST. URSULA    (_CARPACCIO_)    JOHN RUSKIN      In the year 1869, just before leaving Venice I had been carefully  looking at a picture by Victor Carpaccio, representing the dream of a  young princess. Carpaccio has taken much pains to explain to us, as far  as he can, the kind of life she leads, by completely painting her little  bedroom in the light of dawn, so that you can see everything in it. It  is lighted by two doubly-arched windows, the arches being painted  crimson round their edges, and the capitals of the shafts that bear  them, gilded. They are filled at the top with small round panes of  glass; but beneath, are open to the blue morning sky, with a low lattice  across them; and in the one at the back of the room are set two  beautiful white Greek vases with a plant in each; one having rich dark  and pointed green leaves, the other crimson flowers, but not of any  species known to me, each at the end of a branch like a spray of heath.    [Illustration: THE DREAM OF ST. URSULA.          _Carpaccio._]    These flower-pots stand on a shelf which runs all round the room, and  beneath the window, at about the height of the elbow, and serves to put  things on anywhere: beneath it, down to the floor, the walls are covered  with green cloth; but above are bare and white. The second window is  nearly opposite the bed, and in front of it is the princess's  reading-table, some two feet and a half square, covered by a red  cloth with a white border and dainty fringe; and beside it her seat, not  at all like a reading chair in Oxford, but a very small three-legged  stool like a music stool, covered with crimson cloth. On the table are a  book, set up at a slope fittest for reading, and an hour-glass. Under  the shelf near the table so as to be easily reached by the outstretched  arm, is a press full of books. The door of this has been left open, and  the books, I am grieved to say, are rather in disorder, having been  pulled about before the princess went to bed, and one left standing on  its side.    Opposite this window, on the white wall, is a small shrine or picture (I  can't see which, for it is in sharp retiring perspective), with a lamp  before it, and a silver vessel hung from the lamp, looking like one for  holding incense.    The bed is a broad four-poster, the posts being beautifully wrought  golden or gilded rods, variously wreathed and branched, carrying a  canopy of warm red. The princess's shield is at the head of it, and the  feet are raised entirely above the floor of the room, on a dais which  projects at the lower end so as to form a seat, on which the child has  laid her crown. Her little blue slippers lie at the side of the  bed,--her white dog beside them, the coverlid is scarlet, the white  sheet folded half way back over it; the young girl lies straight,  bending neither at waist nor knee, the sheet rising and falling over her  in a narrow unbroken wave, like the shape of the coverlid of the last  sleep, when the turf scarcely rises. She is some seventeen or eighteen  years old, her head is turned towards us on the pillow, the cheek  resting on her hand, as if she were thinking, yet utterly calm in sleep,  and almost colourless. Her hair is tied with a narrow riband, and  divided into two wreaths, which encircle her head like a double crown.  The white nightgown hides the arm raised on the pillow, down to the  wrist.    At the door of the room an angel enters; (the little dog, though lying  awake, vigilant, takes no notice.) He is a very small angel, his head  just rises a little above the shelf round the room, and would only reach  as high as the princess's chin, if she were standing up. He has soft  grey wings, lustreless; and his dress, of subdued blue, has violet  sleeves, open above the elbow, and showing white sleeves below. He comes  in without haste, his body, like a mortal one, casting shadow from the  light through the door behind, his face perfectly quiet; a palm-branch  in his right hand--a scroll in his left.    So dreams the princess, with blessed eyes, that need no earthly dawn. It  is very pretty of Carpaccio to make her dream out the angel's dress so  particularly, and notice the slashed sleeves; and to dream so little an  angel--very nearly a doll angel,--bringing her the branch of palm, and  message. But the lovely characteristic of all is the evident delight of  her continual life. Royal power over herself, and happiness in her  flowers, her books, her sleeping and waking, her prayers, her dreams,  her earth, her heaven....    \"How do I know the princess is industrious?\"    Partly by the trim state of her room,--by the hour-glass on the  table,--by the evident use of all the books she has, (well bound, every  one of them, in stoutest leather or velvet, and with no dog's-ears,) but  more distinctly from another picture of her, not asleep. In that one a  prince of England has sent to ask her in marriage: and her father,  little liking to part with her, sends for her to his room to ask her  what she would do. He sits, moody and sorrowful; she, standing before  him in a plain house-wifely dress, talks quietly, going on with her  needlework all the time.    A work-woman, friends, she, no less than a princess; and princess most  in being so. In like manner, is a picture by a Florentine, whose mind I  would fain have you know somewhat, as well as Carpaccio's--Sandro  Botticelli--the girl who is to be the wife of Moses, when he first sees  her at the desert well, has fruit in her left hand, but a distaff in her  right.[2]    \"To do good work, whether you live or die,\" it is the entrance to all  Princedoms; and if not done, the day will come, and that infallibly,  when you must labour for evil instead of good.        _Fors Clavigera_ (Sunnyside, Orpington, Kent, 1872).    FOOTNOTES:    [2] More accurately a rod cloven into three at the top, and so holding  the wool. The fruit is a bunch of apples; she has golden sandals, and a  wreath of myrtle round her hair.          THE DESCENT FROM THE CROSS    (_RUBENS_)    EUGENE FROMENTIN      Many people say _Antwerp_; but many also say _the country of Rubens_,  and this mode of speech more exactly expresses all the things that  constitute the magic of the place: a great city, a great personal  destiny, a famous school, and ultra-celebrated pictures. All this is  imposing, and our imagination becomes excited rather more than usual  when, in the centre of the _Place Vert_, we see the statue of Rubens  and, farther on, the old basilica where are preserved the triptychs  which, humanly speaking, have consecrated it.    The statue is not a masterpiece; but it is he, in his own home. Under  the form of a man, who was nothing but a painter, with the sole  attributes of a painter, in perfect truth it personifies the sole  Flemish sovereignty which has neither been contested nor menaced, and  which certainly never will be.    [Illustration: THE DESCENT FROM THE CROSS.          _Rubens._]    At the end of the square is seen Notre Dame; it presents itself in  profile, being outlined by one of its lateral faces, the darkest one, on  account of the rains beating on that side. It is made to look blacker  and bigger by being surrounded with light and low buildings. With its  carved stonework, its rusty tone, its blue and lustrous roof, its  colossal tower where the golden disk and the golden needles of its  dial glitter in the stone discoloured by the vapours from the Scheldt  and by the winters, it assumes monstrous proportions. When the sky is  troubled, as it is to-day, it adds all its own strange caprices to the  grandeur of the lines. Imagine then the invention of a Gothic Piranesi,  exaggerated by the fancy of the North, wildly illuminated by a stormy  day, and standing out in irregular blotches against the scenic  background of a sky entirely black or entirely white, and full of  tempest.

And also on the stage.\"    \"I thought so!\" said Raoul, compressing his lips.  \"But then why, when  you saw me in your room, at your feet, reminding you that I had rescued  your scarf from the sea, why did you answer as though you did not know  me and also why did you laugh?\"    The tone of these questions was so rough that Christine stared at Raoul  without replying.  The young man himself was aghast at the sudden  quarrel which he had dared to raise at the very moment when he had  resolved to speak words of gentleness, love and submission to  Christine.  A husband, a lover with all rights, would talk no  differently to a wife, a mistress who had offended him.  But he had  gone too far and saw no other way out of the ridiculous position than  to behave odiously.    \"You don't answer!\" he said angrily and unhappily.  \"Well, I will  answer for you.  It was because there was some one in the room who was  in your way, Christine, some one that you did not wish to know that you  could be interested in any one else!\"    \"If any one was in my way, my friend,\" Christine broke in coldly, \"if  any one was in my way, that evening, it was yourself, since I told you  to leave the room!\"    \"Yes, so that you might remain with the other!\"    \"What are you saying, monsieur?\" asked the girl excitedly.  \"And to  what other do you refer?\"    \"To the man to whom you said, 'I sing only for you! ... to-night I gave  you my soul and I am dead!'\"    Christine seized Raoul's arm and clutched it with a strength which no  one would have suspected in so frail a creature.    \"Then you were listening behind the door?\"    \"Yes, because I love you everything ... And I heard everything ...\"    \"You heard what?\"    And the young girl, becoming strangely calm, released Raoul's arm.    \"He said to you, 'Christine, you must love me!'\"    At these words, a deathly pallor spread over Christine's face, dark  rings formed round her eyes, she staggered and seemed on the point of  swooning.  Raoul darted forward, with arms outstretched, but Christine  had overcome her passing faintness and said, in a low voice:    \"Go on!  Go on!  Tell me all you heard!\"    At an utter loss to understand, Raoul answered:  \"I heard him reply,  when you said you had given him your soul, 'Your soul is a beautiful  thing, child, and I thank you.  No emperor ever received so fair a  gift.  The angels wept tonight.'\"    Christine carried her hand to her heart, a prey to indescribable  emotion.  Her eyes stared before her like a madwoman's. Raoul was  terror-stricken. But suddenly Christine's eyes moistened and two great  tears trickled, like two pearls, down her ivory cheeks.    \"Christine!\"    \"Raoul!\"    The young man tried to take her in his arms, but she escaped and fled  in great disorder.    While Christine remained locked in her room, Raoul was at his wit's end  what to do.  He refused to breakfast.  He was terribly concerned and  bitterly grieved to see the hours, which he had hoped to find so sweet,  slip past without the presence of the young Swedish girl.  Why did she  not come to roam with him through the country where they had so many  memories in common?  He heard that she had had a mass said, that  morning, for the repose of her father's soul and spent a long time  praying in the little church and on the fiddler's tomb.  Then, as she  seemed to have nothing more to do at Perros and, in fact, was doing  nothing there, why did she not go back to Paris at once?    Raoul walked away, dejectedly, to the graveyard in which the church  stood and was indeed alone among the tombs, reading the inscriptions;  but, when he turned behind the apse, he was suddenly struck by the  dazzling note of the flowers that straggled over the white ground.  They were marvelous red roses that had blossomed in the morning, in the  snow, giving a glimpse of life among the dead, for death was all around  him.  It also, like the flowers, issued from the ground, which had  flung back a number of its corpses.  Skeletons and skulls by the  hundred were heaped against the wall of the church, held in position by  a wire that left the whole gruesome stack visible.  Dead men's bones,  arranged in rows, like bricks, to form the first course upon which the  walls of the sacristy had been built.  The door of the sacristy opened  in the middle of that bony structure, as is often seen in old Breton  churches.    Raoul said a prayer for Daae and then, painfully impressed by all those  eternal smiles on the mouths of skulls, he climbed the slope and sat  down on the edge of the heath overlooking the sea.  The wind fell with  the evening.  Raoul was surrounded by icy darkness, but he did not feel  the cold.  It was here, he remembered, that he used to come with little  Christine to see the Korrigans dance at the rising of the moon.  He had  never seen any, though his eyes were good, whereas Christine, who was a  little shortsighted, pretended that she had seen many.  He smiled at  the thought and then suddenly gave a start.  A voice behind him said:    \"Do you think the Korrigans will come this evening?\"    It was Christine.  He tried to speak.  She put her gloved hand on his  mouth.    \"Listen, Raoul.  I have decided to tell you something serious, very  serious ... Do you remember the legend of the Angel of Music?\"    \"I do indeed,\" he said.  \"I believe it was here that your father first  told it to us.\"    \"And it was here that he said, 'When I am in Heaven, my child, I will  send him to you.'  Well, Raoul, my father is in Heaven, and I have been  visited by the Angel of Music.\"    \"I have no doubt of it,\" replied the young man gravely, for it seemed  to him that his friend, in obedience to a pious thought, was connecting  the memory of her father with the brilliancy of her last triumph.    Christine appeared astonished at the Vicomte de Chagny's coolness:    \"How do you understand it?\" she asked, bringing her pale face so close  to his that he might have thought that Christine was going to give him  a kiss; but she only wanted to read his eyes in spite of the dark.    \"I understand,\" he said, \"that no human being can sing as you sang the  other evening without the intervention of some miracle.  No professor  on earth can teach you such accents as those.  You have heard the Angel  of Music, Christine.\"    \"Yes,\" she said solemnly, \"IN MY DRESSING-ROOM. That is where he comes  to give me my lessons daily.\"    \"In your dressing-room?\" he echoed stupidly.    \"Yes, that is where I have heard him; and I have not been the only one  to hear him.\"    \"Who else heard him, Christine?\"    \"You, my friend.\"    \"I?  I heard the Angel of Music?\"    \"Yes, the other evening, it was he who was talking when you were  listening behind the door.  It was he who said, 'You must love me.' But  I then thought that I was the only one to hear his voice.  Imagine my  astonishment when you told me, this morning, that you could hear him  too.\"    Raoul burst out laughing.  The first rays of the moon came and shrouded  the two young people in their light.  Christine turned on Raoul with a  hostile air.  Her eyes, usually so gentle, flashed fire.    \"What are you laughing at?  YOU think you heard a man's voice, I  suppose?\"    \"Well! ...\" replied the young man, whose ideas began to grow confused  in the face of Christine's determined attitude.    \"It's you, Raoul, who say that?  You, an old playfellow of my own!  A  friend of my father's! But you have changed since those days.  What are  you thinking of?  I am an honest girl, M. le Vicomte de Chagny, and I  don't lock myself up in my dressing-room with men's voices.  If you had  opened the door, you would have seen that there was nobody in the room!\"    \"That's true!  I did open the door, when you were gone, and I found no  one in the room.\"    \"So you see! ... Well?\"    The viscount summoned up all his courage.    \"Well, Christine, I think that somebody is making game of you.\"    She gave a cry and ran away.  He ran after her, but, in a tone of  fierce anger, she called out:  \"Leave me!  Leave me!\" And she  disappeared.    Raoul returned to the inn feeling very weary, very low-spirited and  very sad.  He was told that Christine had gone to her bedroom saying  that she would not be down to dinner.  Raoul dined alone, in a very  gloomy mood.  Then he went to his room and tried to read, went to bed  and tried to sleep.  There was no sound in the next room.    The hours passed slowly.  It was about half-past eleven when he  distinctly heard some one moving, with a light, stealthy step, in the  room next to his.  Then Christine had not gone to bed!  Without  troubling for a reason, Raoul dressed, taking care not to make a sound,  and waited.  Waited for what?  How could he tell?  But his heart  thumped in his chest when he heard Christine's door turn slowly on its  hinges.  Where could she be going, at this hour, when every one was  fast asleep at Perros?  Softly opening the door, he saw Christine's  white form, in the moonlight, slipping along the passage.  She went  down the stairs and he leaned over the baluster above her.  Suddenly he  heard two voices in rapid conversation.  He caught one sentence: \"Don't  lose the key.\"    It was the landlady's voice.  The door facing the sea was opened and  locked again.  Then all was still.    Raoul ran back to his room and threw back the window.  Christine's  white form stood on the deserted quay.    The first floor of the Setting Sun was at no great height and a tree  growing against the wall held out its branches to Raoul's impatient  arms and enabled him to climb down unknown to the landlady.  Her  amazement, therefore, was all the greater when, the next morning, the  young man was brought back to her half frozen, more dead than alive,  and when she learned that he had been found stretched at full length on  the steps of the high altar "]]]
