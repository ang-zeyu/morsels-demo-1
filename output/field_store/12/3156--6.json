Sell all the embellished ornaments thou dost possess, and expend  them in the path of God, Who causeth the night to return upon the day, and  the day to return upon the night. Abandon thy kingdom unto the kings, and  emerge from thy habitation, with thy face set towards the Kingdom, and,  detached from the world, then speak forth the praises of thy Lord betwixt  earth and heaven. Thus hath bidden thee He Who is the Possessor of Names,  on the part of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Knowing. Exhort thou the  kings and say: \"Deal equitably with men. Beware lest ye transgress the  bounds fixed in the Book.\" This indeed becometh thee. Beware lest thou  appropriate unto thyself the things of the world and the riches thereof.  Leave them unto such as desire them, and cleave unto that which hath been  enjoined upon thee by Him Who is the Lord of creation. Should anyone offer  thee all the treasures of the earth, refuse to even glance upon them. Be  as thy Lord hath been. Thus hath the Tongue of Revelation spoken that  which God hath made the ornament of the book of creation.    119 Consider a pearl which shineth by virtue of its inherent nature. If it  be covered with silk, its lustre and beauty will be concealed. Likewise,  man's distinction lieth in the excellence of his conduct and in the  pursuit of that which beseemeth his station, not in childish play and  pastimes. Know that thy true adornment consisteth in the love of God and  in thy detachment from all save Him, and not in the luxuries thou dost  possess. Abandon them unto those who seek after them and turn unto God, He  Who causeth the rivers to flow.    120 Whatever proceeded from the tongue of the Son was revealed in  parables, whilst He Who proclaimeth the Truth in this Day speaketh without  them. Take heed lest thou cling to the cord of idle fancy and withhold  thyself from that which hath been ordained in the Kingdom of God, the  Almighty, the All-Bountiful. Should the inebriation of the wine of My  verses seize thee, and thou determinest to present thyself before the  throne of thy Lord, the Creator of earth and heaven, make My love thy  vesture, and thy shield remembrance of Me, and thy provision reliance upon  God, the Revealer of all power.    121 O followers of the Son! We have once again sent John unto you, and He,  verily, hath cried out in the wilderness of the Bayan: O peoples of the  world! Cleanse your eyes! The Day whereon ye can behold the Promised One  and attain unto Him hath drawn nigh! O followers of the Gospel! Prepare  the way! The Day of the advent of the Glorious Lord is at hand! Make ready  to enter the Kingdom. Thus hath it been ordained by God, He Who causeth  the dawn to break.    122 Give ear unto that which the Dove of Eternity warbleth upon the twigs  of the Divine Lote-Tree: O peoples of the earth! We sent forth him who was  named John to baptize you with water, that your bodies might be cleansed  for the appearance of the Messiah. He, in turn, purified you with the fire  of love and the water of the spirit in anticipation of these Days whereon  the All-Merciful hath purposed to cleanse you with the water of life at  the hands of His loving providence. This is the Father foretold by Isaiah,  and the Comforter concerning Whom the Spirit had covenanted with you. Open  your eyes, O concourse of bishops, that ye may behold your Lord seated  upon the Throne of might and glory.    123 Say: O peoples of all faiths! Walk not in the ways of them that  followed the Pharisees and thus veiled themselves from the Spirit. They  truly have strayed and are in error. The Ancient Beauty is come in His  Most Great Name, and He wisheth to admit all mankind into His most holy  Kingdom. The pure in heart behold the Kingdom of God manifest before His  Face. Make haste thereunto and follow not the infidel and the ungodly.  Should your eye be opposed thereto, pluck it out.(13) Thus hath it been  decreed by the Pen of the Ancient of Days, as bidden by Him Who is the  Lord of the entire creation. He, verily, hath come again that ye might be  redeemed, O peoples of the earth. Will ye slay Him Who desireth to grant  you eternal life? Fear God, O ye who are endued with insight.    124 O people! Hearken unto that which hath been revealed by your  All-Glorious Lord, and turn your faces unto God, the Lord of this world  and of the world to come. Thus doth He Who is the Dawning-Place of the  Daystar of divine inspiration command you as bidden by the Fashioner of  all mankind. We, verily, have created you for the light, and desire not to  abandon you unto the fire. Come forth, O people, from darkness by the  grace of this Sun which hath shone forth above the horizon of divine  providence, and turn thereunto with sanctified hearts and assured souls,  with seeing eyes and beaming faces. Thus counselleth you the Supreme  Ordainer from the scene of His transcendent glory, that perchance His  summons may draw you nigh unto the Kingdom of His names.    125 Blessed the one who hath remained faithful to the Covenant of God, and  woe betide him who hath broken it and disbelieved in Him, the Knower of  secrets. Say: This is the Day of Bounty! Bestir yourselves that I may make  you monarchs in the realms of My Kingdom. If ye follow Me, ye shall behold  that which ye were promised, and I will make you My companions in the  dominion of My majesty and the intimates of My beauty in the heaven of My  power forevermore. If ye rebel against Me, I will in My clemency endure it  patiently, that haply ye may awaken and rise up from the couch of  heedlessness. Thus hath My mercy encompassed you. Fear ye God and follow  not in the ways of those who have turned away from His face, though they  invoke His name in the daytime and in the night season.    126 Verily, the day of ingathering is come, and all things have been  separated from each other. He hath stored away that which He chose in the  vessels of justice, and cast into fire that which befitteth it. Thus hath  it been decreed by your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving, in this promised  Day. He, verily, ordaineth what He pleaseth. There is none other God save  He, the Almighty, the All-Compelling. The desire of the Divine Sifter hath  been to store up every good thing for Mine own Self. Naught hath He spoken  save to acquaint you with My Cause and to guide you to the path of Him  whose mention hath adorned all the sacred Books.    127 Say: O concourse of Christians! We have, on a previous occasion,  revealed Ourself unto you, and ye recognized Me not. This is yet another  occasion vouchsafed unto you. This is the Day of God; turn ye unto Him.  He, verily, hath come down from heaven even as He came down the first  time, and He desireth to shelter you beneath the shade of His mercy. He,  verily, is the Exalted, the Mighty, the Supreme Helper. The Beloved One  loveth not that ye be consumed with the fire of your desires. Were ye to  be shut out as by a veil from Him, this would be for no other reason than  your own waywardness and ignorance. Ye make mention of Me, and know Me  not. Ye call upon Me, and are heedless of My Revelation, notwithstanding  that I came unto you from the heaven of pre-existence with surpassing  glory. Rend the veils asunder in My name and through the power of My  sovereignty that ye may discover a path unto your Lord.    128 The King of Glory proclaimeth from the tabernacle of majesty and  grandeur His call, saying: O people of the Gospel! They who were not in  the Kingdom have now entered it, whilst We behold you, in this day,  tarrying at the gate. Rend the veils asunder by the power of your Lord,  the Almighty, the All-Bounteous, and enter, then, in My name My Kingdom.  Thus biddeth you He Who desireth for you everlasting life. He, verily, is  potent over all things. Blessed are those who have recognized the Light  and hastened unto it. They, verily, dwell in the Kingdom, and partake of  the food and drink of God's chosen ones.    129 We behold you, O children of the Kingdom, in darkness. This, verily,  beseemeth you not. Are ye, in the face of the Light, fearful because of  your deeds? Direct yourselves towards Him. Your All-Glorious Lord hath  blessed His lands with His footsteps. Thus do We make plain unto you the  path of Him Whom the Spirit prophesied. I, verily, bear witness unto Him,  even as He hath borne witness unto Me. Verily, He said: \"Come ye after Me,  and I will make you to become fishers of men.\" In this day, however, We  say: \"Come ye after Me, that We may make you to become quickeners of  mankind.\" Thus hath the decree been inscribed in this Tablet by the Pen of  Revelation.    130 O Pen of the Most High! Bestir Thyself in remembrance of other kings  in this blessed and luminous Book, that perchance they may rise from the  couch of heedlessness and give ear unto that which the Nightingale singeth  upon the branches of the Divine Lote-Tree, and hasten towards God in this  most wondrous and sublime Revelation.          Napoleon III      131 O King of Paris!(14) Tell the priests to ring the bells no longer. By  God, the True One! The Most Mighty Bell hath appeared in the form of Him  Who is the Most Great Name, and the fingers of the Will of Thy Lord, the  Most Exalted, the Most High, toll it out in the heaven of Immortality in  His name, the All-Glorious. Thus have the mighty verses of Thy Lord been  again sent down unto thee, that thou mayest arise to remember God, the  Creator of earth and heaven, in these days when all the tribes of the  earth have mourned, and the foundations of the cities have trembled, and  the dust of irreligion hath enwrapped all men, except such as God, the  All-Knowing, the All-Wise, was pleased to spare. Say: He Who is the  Unconstrained is come, in the clouds of light, that He may quicken the  world with the breezes of His name, the Most Merciful, and unify its  peoples, and gather all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17310"],[0,"Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas (#11)"],[1,"thou hast been born anew from thy mother's  womb. Say: Thou art free from sin and error. Truly God hath purged thee  with the living waters of His utterance in His Most Great Prison. We  entreat Him--blessed and exalted is He--to graciously confirm thee in  extolling Him and in magnifying His glory and to strengthen thee through  the power of His invisible hosts. Verily, He is the Almighty, the  Omnipotent.    Thou hast made mention of the people of Tar.(19) We have set Our face  toward the servants of God therein and advise them first to consider that  which the Point of the Bayan hath revealed concerning this Revelation  whereby all names and titles have been shaken, the idols of vain  imaginings have crumbled and the Tongue of Grandeur hath, from the realm  of glory, proclaimed: By the righteousness of God! The Hidden Treasure,  the Impenetrable Mystery, hath been uncovered to men's eyes, causing all  things, whether of the past or of the future, to rejoice. He hath said,  and His word is the truth: 'Of all the tributes I have paid to Him Who is  to come after Me, the greatest is this, My written confession, that no  words of Mine can adequately describe Him, nor can any reference to Him in  My Book, the Bayan, do justice to His Cause.'    Moreover We counsel them to observe justice, equity, honesty, piety and  that whereby both the Word of God and their own station will be exalted  amongst men. Verily I am the One Who exhorteth with justice. Unto this  beareth witness He from Whose Pen rivers of mercy have flowed and from  Whose utterance fountains of living waters have streamed forth unto all  created things. Immeasurably exalted is this boundless grace; immensely  blessed is this resplendent favour.    O people of Tar! Give ear unto the Call of Him Who doeth whatsoever He  willeth. In truth He remindeth you of that which will draw you nigh unto  God, the Lord of the worlds. He hath turned His face towards you from the  Prison of Akka and hath revealed for your sakes what will immortalize your  memory and your names in the Book which cannot be effaced and remaineth  unaffected by the doubts of the froward. Cast away the things current  amongst men and take fast hold on that whereunto ye are bidden by virtue  of the Will of the Ordainer, the Ancient of Days. This is the Day wherein  the divine Lote-Tree calleth aloud, saying: O people! Behold ye My fruits  and My leaves, incline then your ears unto My rustling. Beware lest the  doubts of men debar you from the light of certitude. The Ocean of  utterance exclaimeth and saith: 'O ye dwellers on the earth! Behold My  billowing waters and the pearls of wisdom and utterance which I have  poured forth. Fear ye God and be not of the heedless.'    In this Day a great festival is taking place in the Realm above; for  whatsoever was promised in the sacred Scriptures hath been fulfilled. This  is the Day of great rejoicing. It behoveth everyone to hasten towards the  court of His nearness with exceeding joy, gladness, exultation and delight  and to deliver himself from the fire of remoteness.    O people of Tar! Through the strengthening power of My Name seize ye the  chalice of knowledge, drink then your fill in defiance of the people of  the world who have broken the Covenant of God and His Testament, rejected  His proofs and clear tokens, and cavilled at His signs which have pervaded  all that are in heaven and on earth.    The disbelievers among the people of the Bayan are like the followers of  the Shi'ih sect and walk in their footsteps. Leave them to their idle  fancies and vain imaginings. They are in truth accounted with the lost in  the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The Shi'ih divines, one  and all, are now engaged in reviling and denouncing the True One from  their pulpits. Gracious God! Dawlat-Abadi(20) too hath followed suit. He  ascended the pulpit and gave voice to that which hath caused the Tablet to  cry out in anguish and the Pen to wail. Meditate upon his conduct and the  conduct of Ashraf(21)--upon him be My glory and My tender mercy--and  likewise consider those loved ones who hastened to the place of martyrdom  in My Name, and offered up their lives in the path of Him Who is the  Desire of the world.    The Cause is manifest, it shineth resplendent as the sun, but the people  have become veils unto themselves. We entreat God that He may graciously  assist them to return unto Him. He is, in truth, the Forgiving, the  Merciful.    O people of Tar! We send you greetings from this Spot and beseech  God--blessed and exalted is He--to give you to drink the choice wine of  constancy from the hand of His favour. Verily, He is the Lord of Bounty,  the Gracious, the All-Praised. Leave ye unto themselves the immature ones  of the world--they that are moved by selfish desire and cling to the  exponents of idle fancy. Verily He is your Helper and Succourer. He is, in  truth, potent to do whatsoever He willeth. No God is there but Him, the  One, the Peerless, the Mighty, the Most Great.    May glory from Our presence rest upon those who have set their faces  toward the Dayspring of His Revelation and have acknowledged and  recognized that which the Tongue of utterance hath spoken in the kingdom  of knowledge in this blessed, this glorious and incomparable Day.                                LAWH-I-DUNYA (TABLET OF THE WORLD)      In My Name, calling aloud in the Kingdom of Utterance    PRAISE and thanksgiving beseem the Lord of manifest dominion Who hath  adorned the mighty prison with the presence of their honours 'Ali-Akbar  and Amin, and hath illumined it with the light of certitude, constancy and  assurance.(22) The glory of God and the glory of all that are in the  heavens and on the earth be upon them.    Light and glory, greeting and praise be upon the Hands of His Cause,  through whom the light of fortitude hath shone forth and the truth hath  been established that the authority to choose rests with God, the  Powerful, the Mighty, the Unconstrained, through whom the ocean of bounty  hath surged and the fragrance of the gracious favours of God, the Lord of  mankind, hath been diffused. We beseech Him--exalted is He--to shield them  through the power of His hosts, to protect them through the potency of His  dominion and to aid them through His indomitable strength which prevaileth  over all created things. Sovereignty is God's, the Creator of the heavens  and the Lord of the Kingdom of Names.    The Great Announcement proclaimeth: O people of Persia! In former times ye  have been the symbols of mercy and the embodiments of affection and  kindliness. The regions of the world were illumined and embellished by the  brightness of the light of your knowledge and by the blaze of your  erudition. How is it that you have arisen to destroy yourselves and your  friends with your own hands?    O Afnan, O thou that has branched from Mine ancient Stock! My glory and My  loving-kindness rest upon thee. How vast is the tabernacle of the Cause of  God! It hath overshadowed all the peoples and kindreds of the earth, and  will, ere long, gather together the whole of mankind beneath its shelter.  Thy day of service is now come. Countless Tablets bear the testimony of  the bounties vouchsafed unto thee. Arise for the triumph of My Cause, and,  through the power of thine utterance, subdue the hearts of men. Thou must  show forth that which will ensure the peace and the well-being of the  miserable and the downtrodden. Gird up the loins of thine endeavour, that  perchance thou mayest release the captive from his chains, and enable him  to attain unto true liberty.    Justice is, in this day, bewailing its plight, and Equity groaneth beneath  the yoke of oppression. The thick clouds of tyranny have darkened the face  of the earth, and enveloped its peoples. Through the movement of Our Pen  of glory We have, at the bidding of the omnipotent Ordainer, breathed a  new life into every human frame, and instilled into every word a fresh  potency. All created things proclaim the evidences of this world-wide  regeneration. This is the most great, the most joyful tidings imparted by  the Pen of this Wronged One to mankind. Wherefore fear ye, O My  well-beloved ones? Who is it that can dismay you? A touch of moisture  sufficeth to dissolve the hardened clay out of which this perverse  generation is moulded. The mere act of your gathering together is enough  to scatter the forces of these vain and worthless people.    Strife and conflict befit the beasts of the wild. It was through the grace  of God and with the aid of seemly words and praiseworthy deeds that the  unsheathed swords of the Babi community were returned to their scabbards.  Indeed through the power of good words, the righteous have always  succeeded in winning command over the meads of the hearts of men. Say, O  ye loved ones! Do not forsake prudence. Incline your hearts to the  counsels given by the Most Exalted Pen and beware lest your hands or  tongues cause harm unto anyone among mankind.    Referring to the land of Ta (Tihran) We have revealed in the Kitab-i-Aqdas  that which will admonish mankind. They that perpetrate tyranny in the  world have usurped the rights of the peoples and kindreds of the earth and  are sedulously pursuing their selfish inclinations. The tyrant(23) of the  land of Ya (Yazd), committed that which hath caused the Concourse on High  to shed tears of blood.    O thou who hast quaffed from the wine of Mine utterance and hast fixed thy  gaze upon the horizon of My Revelation! How strange that the people of  Persia, who were unrivalled in sciences and arts, should have sunk to the  lowest level of degradation among the kindreds of the earth. O people! In  this blessed, this glorious Day, deprive not yourselves of the liberal  effusions of bounty which the Lord of abounding grace hath vouchsafed unto  you. In this Day showers of wisdom and utterance are pouring down from the"]]]
