He is never allowed on this side of the house.\"    Nayland Smith wandered aimlessly about the library.    \"I am sorry to have to press you, Mr. Eltham,\" he said, \"but what was  the nature of the warning to which you referred, and from whom did it  come?\"    Mr. Eltham hesitated for a long time.    \"I have been so unfortunate,\" he said at last, \"in my previous efforts,  that I feel assured of your hostile criticism when I tell you that I am  contemplating an immediate return to Ho-Nan!\"    Smith jumped round upon him as though moved by a spring.    \"Then you are going back to Nan-Yang?\" he cried.  \"Now I understand!  Why have you not told me before?  That is the key for which I have  vainly been seeking.  Your troubles date from the time of your decision  to return?\"    \"Yes, I must admit it,\" confessed the clergyman diffidently.    \"And your warning came from China?\"    \"It did.\"    \"From a Chinaman?\"    \"From the Mandarin, Yen-Sun-Yat.\"    \"Yen-Sun-Yat!  My good sir!  He warned you to abandon your visit?  And  you reject his advice?  Listen to me.\"  Smith was intensely excited  now, his eyes bright, his lean figure curiously strung up, alert.  \"The  Mandarin Yen-Sun-Yat is one of the seven!\"    \"I do not follow you, Mr. Smith.\"    \"No, sir.  China to-day is not the China of '98.  It is a huge secret  machine, and Ho-Nan one of its most important wheels!  But if, as I  understand, this official is a friend of yours, believe me, he has  saved your life!  You would be a dead man now if it were not for your  friend in China!  My dear sir, you must accept his counsel.\"    Then, for the first time since I had made his acquaintance, \"Parson  Dan\" showed through the surface of the Rev. J. D. Eltham.    \"No, sir!\" replied the clergyman--and the change in his voice was  startling.  \"I am called to Nan-Yang. Only One may deter my going.\"    The admixture of deep spiritual reverence with intense truculence in  his voice was dissimilar from anything I ever had heard.    \"Then only One can protect you,\" cried Smith, \"for, by Heaven, no MAN  will be able to do so!  Your presence in Ho-Nan can do no possible good  at present.  It must do harm.  Your experience in 1900 should be fresh  in your memory.\"    \"Hard words, Mr. Smith.\"    \"The class of missionary work which you favor, sir, is injurious to  international peace.  At the present moment, Ho-Nan is a barrel of  gunpowder; you would be the lighted match.  I do not willingly stand  between any man and what he chooses to consider his duty, but I insist  that you abandon your visit to the interior of China!\"    \"You insist, Mr. Smith?\"    \"As your guest, I regret the necessity for reminding you that I hold  authority to enforce it.\"    Denby fidgeted uneasily.  The tone of the conversation was growing  harsh and the atmosphere of the library portentous with brewing storms.    There was a short, silent interval.    \"This is what I had feared and expected,\" said the clergyman.  \"This  was my reason for not seeking official protection.\"    \"The phantom Yellow Peril,\" said Nayland Smith, \"to-day materializes  under the very eyes of the Western world.\"    \"The 'Yellow Peril'!\"    \"You scoff, sir, and so do others.  We take the proffered right hand of  friendship nor inquire if the hidden left holds a knife!  The peace of  the world is at stake, Mr. Eltham.  Unknowingly, you tamper with  tremendous issues.\"    Mr. Eltham drew a deep breath, thrusting both hands in his pockets.    \"You are painfully frank, Mr. Smith,\" he said; \"but I like you for it.  I will reconsider my position and talk this matter over again with you  to-morrow.\"    Thus, then, the storm blew over.  Yet I had never experienced such an  overwhelming sense of imminent peril--of a sinister presence--as  oppressed me at that moment.  The very atmosphere of Redmoat was  impregnated with Eastern devilry; it loaded the air like some evil  perfume.  And then, through the silence, cut a throbbing scream--the  scream of a woman in direst fear.    \"My God, it's Greba!\" whispered Mr. Eltham.        CHAPTER VIII      IN what order we dashed down to the drawing-room I cannot recall.  But  none was before me when I leaped over the threshold and saw Miss Eltham  prone by the French windows.    These were closed and bolted, and she lay with hands outstretched in  the alcove which they formed.  I bent over her.  Nayland Smith was at  my elbow.    \"Get my bag\" I said.  \"She has swooned.  It is nothing serious.\"    Her father, pale and wide-eyed, hovered about me, muttering  incoherently; but I managed to reassure him; and his gratitude when, I  having administered a simple restorative, the girl sighed shudderingly  and opened her eyes, was quite pathetic.    I would permit no questioning at that time, and on her father's arm she  retired to her own rooms.    It was some fifteen minutes later that her message was brought to me.  I followed the maid to a quaint little octagonal apartment, and Greba  Eltham stood before me, the candlelight caressing the soft curves of  her face and gleaming in the meshes of her rich brown hair.    When she had answered my first question she hesitated in pretty  confusion.    \"We are anxious to know what alarmed you, Miss Eltham.\"    She bit her lip and glanced with apprehension towards the window.    \"I am almost afraid to tell father,\" she began rapidly.  \"He will think  me imaginative, but you have been so kind.  It was two green eyes!  Oh!  Dr. Petrie, they looked up at me from the steps leading to the lawn.  And they shone like the eyes of a cat.\"    The words thrilled me strangely.    \"Are you sure it was not a cat, Miss Eltham?\"    \"The eyes were too large, Dr. Petrie.  There was something dreadful,  most dreadful, in their appearance.  I feel foolish and silly for  having fainted, twice in two days!  But the suspense is telling upon  me, I suppose.  Father thinks\"--she was becoming charmingly  confidential, as a woman often will with a tactful physician--\"that  shut up here we are safe from--whatever threatens us.\" I noted, with  concern, a repetition of the nervous shudder.  \"But since our return  someone else has been in Redmoat!\"    \"Whatever do you mean, Miss Eltham?\"    \"Oh!  I don't quite know what I do mean, Dr. Petrie.  What does it ALL  mean?  Vernon has been explaining to me that some awful Chinaman is  seeking the life of Mr. Nayland Smith.  But if the same man wants to  kill my father, why has he not done so?\"    \"I am afraid you puzzle me.\"    \"Of course, I must do so.  But--the man in the train.  He could have  killed us both quite easily!  And--last night someone was in father's  room.\"    \"In his room!\"    \"I could not sleep, and I heard something moving.  My room is the next  one.  I knocked on the wall and woke father.  There was nothing; so I  said it was the howling of the dog that had frightened me.\"    \"How could anyone get into his room?\"    \"I cannot imagine.  But I am not sure it was a man.\"    \"Miss Eltham, you alarm me.  What do you suspect?\"    \"You must think me hysterical and silly, but whilst father and I have  been away from Redmoat perhaps the usual precautions have been  neglected.  Is there any creature, any large creature, which could  climb up the wall to the window?  Do you know of anything with a long,  thin body?\"    For a moment I offered no reply, studying the girl's pretty face, her  eager, blue-gray eyes widely opened and fixed upon mine.  She was not  of the neurotic type, with her clear complexion and sun-kissed neck;  her arms, healthily toned by exposure to the country airs, were rounded  and firm, and she had the agile shape of a young Diana with none of the  anaemic languor which breeds morbid dreams.  She was frightened; yes,  who would not have been?  But the mere idea of this thing which she  believed to be in Redmoat, without the apparition of the green eyes,  must have prostrated a victim of \"nerves.\"    \"Have you seen such a creature, Miss Eltham?\"    She hesitated again, glancing down and pressing her finger-tips  together.    \"As father awoke and called out to know why I knocked, I glanced from  my window.  The moonlight threw half the lawn into shadow, and just  disappearing in this shadow was something--something of a brown color,  marked with sections!\"    \"What size and shape?\"    \"It moved so quickly I could form no idea of its shape; but I saw quite  six feet of it flash across the grass!\"    \"Did you hear anything?\"    \"A swishing sound in the shrubbery, then nothing more.\"    She met my eyes expectantly.  Her confidence in my powers of  understanding and sympathy was gratifying, though I knew that I but  occupied the position of a father-confessor.    \"Have you any idea,\" I said, \"how it came about that you awoke in the  train yesterday whilst your father did not?\"    \"We had coffee at a refreshment-room; it must have been drugged in some  way.  I scarcely tasted mine, the flavor was so awful; but father is an  old traveler and drank the whole of his cupful!\"    Mr. Eltham's voice called from below.    \"Dr. Petrie,\" said the girl quickly, \"what do you think they want to do  to him?\"    \"Ah!\" I replied, \"I wish I knew that.\"    \"Will you think over what I have told you?  For I do assure you there  is something here in Redmoat--something that comes and goes in spite of  father's 'fortifications'?  Caesar knows there is.  Listen to him.  He  drags at his chain so that I wonder he does not break it.\"    As we passed downstairs the howling of the mastiff sounded eerily  through the house, as did the clank-clank of the tightening chain as he  threw the weight of his big body upon it.    I sat in Smith's room that night for some time, he pacing the floor  smoking and talking.    \"Eltham has influential Chinese friends,\" he said; \"but they dare not  have him in Nan-Yang at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17306"],[0,"The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 (#11)"],[1,"hese, the majority     are young girls who have been seduced from the country by the soldiers     and turned loose on the world in all the destitution of friendless     penury, and all the recklessness of early vice.       \"This is truly horrible!  Poor there must be everywhere.  Indigence     will find its way and set up its hideous state in the heart of a great     and luxurious city.  Amid the thousand narrow lanes and by-streets of     a populous metropolis there must always, we fear, be much     suffering--much that offends the eye--much that lurks unseen.       \"But that within the precincts of wealth, gaiety, and fashion, nigh     the regal grandeur of St. James, close on the palatial splendour of     Bayswater, on the confines of the old and new aristocratic quarters,     in a district where the cautious refinement of modern design has     refrained from creating one single tenement for poverty; which seems,     as it were, dedicated to the exclusive enjoyment of wealth, that     _there_ want, and famine, and disease, and vice should stalk in all     their kindred horrors, consuming body by body, soul, by soul!       \"It is indeed a monstrous state of things!  Enjoyment the most     absolute, that bodily ease, intellectual excitement, or the more     innocent pleasures of sense can supply to man's craving, brought in     close contact with the most unmitigated misery!  Wealth, from its     bright saloons, laughing--an insolently heedless laugh--at the unknown     wounds of want!  Pleasure, cruelly but unconsciously mocking the pain     that moans below!  All contrary things mocking one another--all     contrary, save the vice which tempts and the vice which is tempted!       \"But let all men remember this--that within the most courtly precincts     of the richest city of God's earth, there may be found, night after     night, winter after winter, women--young in years--old in sin and     suffering--outcasts from society--ROTTING FROM FAMINE, FILTH, AND     DISEASE.  Let them remember this, and learn not to theorise but to     act.  God knows, there is much room for action nowadays.\" {32}    I have referred to the refuges for the homeless.  How greatly overcrowded  these are, two examples may show.  A newly erected Refuge for the  Houseless in Upper Ogle Street, that can shelter three hundred persons  every night, has received since its opening, January 27th to March 17th,  1844, 2,740 persons for one or more nights; and, although the season was  growing more favourable, the number of applicants in this, as well as in  the asylums of Whitecross Street and Wapping, was strongly on the  increase, and a crowd of the homeless had to be sent away every night for  want of room.  In another refuge, the Central Asylum in Playhouse Yard,  there were supplied on an average 460 beds nightly, during the first  three months of the year 1844, 6,681 persons being sheltered, and 96,141  portions of bread were distributed.  Yet the committee of directors  declare this institution began to meet the pressure of the needy to a  limited extent only when the Eastern Asylum also was opened.    Let us leave London and examine the other great cities of the three  kingdoms in their order.  Let us take Dublin first, a city the approach  to which from the sea is as charming as that of London is imposing.  The  Bay of Dublin is the most beautiful of the whole British Island Kingdom,  and is even compared by the Irish with the Bay of Naples.  The city, too,  possesses great attractions, and its aristocratic districts are better  and more tastefully laid out than those of any other British city.  By  way of compensation, however, the poorer districts of Dublin are among  the most hideous and repulsive to be seen in the world.  True, the Irish  character, which, under some circumstances, is comfortable only in the  dirt, has some share in this; but as we find thousands of Irish in every  great city in England and Scotland, and as every poor population must  gradually sink into the same uncleanliness, the wretchedness of Dublin is  nothing specific, nothing peculiar to Dublin, but something common to all  great towns.  The poor quarters of Dublin are extremely extensive, and  the filth, the uninhabitableness of the houses and the neglect of the  streets, surpass all description.  Some idea of the manner in which the  poor are here crowded together may be formed from the fact that, in 1817,  according to the report of the Inspector of Workhouses, {33} 1,318  persons lived in 52 houses with 390 rooms in Barral Street, and 1,997  persons in 71 houses with 393 rooms in and near Church Street; that:       \"In this and the adjoining district there exists a multitude of foul     courts and alleys; many cellars receive all their light through the     door, while in not a few the inhabitants sleep upon the bare floor,     though most of them possess bedsteads at least; Nicholson's Court, for     example, contains twenty-eight wretched little rooms with 151 human     beings in the greatest want, there being but two bedsteads and two     blankets to be found in the whole court.\"    The poverty is so great in Dublin, that a single benevolent institution,  the Mendicity Association, gives relief to 2,500 persons or one per cent.  of the population daily, receiving and feeding them for the day and  dismissing them at night.    Dr. Alison describes a similar state of things in Edinburgh, whose superb  situation, which has won it the title of the Modern Athens, and whose  brilliant aristocratic quarter in the New Town, contrast strongly with  the foul wretchedness of the poor in the Old Town.  Alison asserts that  this extensive quarter is as filthy and horrible as the worst district of  Dublin, while the Mendicity Association would have as great a proportion  of needy persons to assist in Edinburgh as in the Irish capital.  He  asserts, indeed, that the poor in Scotland, especially in Edinburgh and  Glasgow, are worse off than in any other region of the three kingdoms,  and that the poorest are not Irish, but Scotch.  The preacher of the Old  Church of Edinburgh, Dr. Lee, testified in 1836, before the Commission of  Religious Instruction, that:       \"He had never before seen such misery as in his parish, where the     people were without furniture, without everything, two married couples     often sharing one room.  In a single day he had visited seven houses     in which there was not a bed, in some of them not even a heap of     straw.  Old people of eighty years sleep on the board floor, nearly     all slept in their day-clothes.  In one cellar room he found two     families from a Scotch country district; soon after their removal to     the city two of the children had died, and a third was dying at the     time of his visit.  Each family had a filthy pile of straw lying in a     corner; the cellar sheltered besides the two families a donkey, and     was, moreover, so dark that it was impossible to distinguish one     person from another by day.  Dr. Lee declared that it was enough to     make a heart of adamant bleed to see such misery in a country like     Scotland.\"    In the Edinburgh _Medical and Surgical Journal_, Dr. Hennan reports a  similar state of things.  From a Parliamentary Report, {35a} it is  evident that in the dwellings of the poor of Edinburgh a want of  cleanliness reigns, such as must be expected under these conditions.  On  the bed-posts chickens roost at night, dogs and horses share the  dwellings of human beings, and the natural consequence is a shocking  stench, with filth and swarms of vermin.  The prevailing construction of  Edinburgh favours these atrocious conditions as far as possible.  The Old  Town is built upon both slopes of a hill, along the crest of which runs  the High Street.  Out of the High Street there open downwards multitudes  of narrow, crooked alleys, called wynds from their many turnings, and  these wynds form the proletarian district of the city.  The houses of the  Scotch cities, in general, are five or six-storied buildings, like those  of Paris, and in contrast with England where, so far as possible, each  family has a separate house.  The crowding of human beings upon a limited  area is thus intensified. {35b}       \"These streets,\" says an English journal in an article upon the     sanitary condition of the working-people in cities, \"are often so     narrow that a person can step from the window of one house into that     of its opposite neighbour, while the houses are piled so high, storey     upon storey, that the light can scarcely penetrate into the court or     alley that lies between.  In this part of the city there are neither     sewers nor other drains, nor even privies belonging to the houses.  In     consequence, all refuse, garbage, and excrements of at least 50,000     persons are thrown into the gutters every night, so that, in spite of     all street sweeping, a mass of dried filth and foul vapours are     created, which not only offend the sight and smell, but endanger the     health of the inhabitants in the highest degree.  Is it to be wondered     at, that in such localities all considerations of health, morals, and     even the most ordinary decency are utterly neglected?  On the     contrary, all who are more intimately acquainted with the condition of     the inhabitants will testify to the high degree which disease,     wretchedness, and demoralisation have here reached.  Society in such     districts has sunk to a level indescribably low and hopeless.  The     houses of the poor are generally filthy, and are evidently never     cleansed.  They consist in most cases of a single room which, while     subject to the worst ventilation, is yet usually kept cold by the     broken and badly fitting windows, and is sometimes damp and partly     below ground level, always badly furnished and thoroughly     uncomfortable, a straw-heap often serving the whole family for a bed,    "]]]
