[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17928"],[0,"The Influence of India and Persia on the Poetry of Germany (#11)"],[1," 2:         [Arabic]       [Arabic]         \"O rose, in thanks for that thou art the queen of beauty, display       no arrogance towards nightingales madly in love.\"    In \"Zum neuen Jahr\" (p. 260) the last lines:        Trag der Schoenheit Koran im offenen Angesicht,      Und ihm diene das Lied Hafises zum Kommentar    are a parallel to H. 10. 6:         [Arabic]       [Arabic]         \"Thy beautiful face by its grace explained to us a verse of the       _Quran_; for that reason there is nothing in our commentary but       grace and beauty.\"    The opening lines of \"Schmuck der Welt\" (p. 260):        Nicht bedarf der Schmink' ein schoenes Angesicht.      So bedarf die Liebste meiner Liebe nicht    are distinctly reminiscent of H. 8. 4:         [Arabic]       [Arabic]         \"Of our imperfect love the beauty of the beloved is independent.       What need has a lovely face of lustre and dye and mole and line?\"    Like Hafid (H. 358. 11; 518. 7 et passim) Rueckert also boasts of his  supremacy as a singer of love and wine (\"Vom Lichte des Weines,\" p.  273). Finally in \"Frag und Antwort\" (p. 258) he employs the form of the  dialogue, the lines beginning alternately _Ich sprach_, _Sie sprach_,  just as Hafid does in Ode 136 or 194. The \"Vierzeilen\" (p. 361), while  they have the _ruba'i_-rhyme, are not versions. Only a few of them have  an Oriental character. Completely unoriental are the \"Briefe des  Brahmanen\" (p. 359), dealing with literary matters of contemporary  interest.[151]    The Oriental studies which Rueckert continued to pursue with unabated  ardor were to him a fruitful source of poetic inspiration. They  furnished the material for the great mass of narrative, descriptive and  didactic poems which were collected under the titles _Erbauliches und  Beschauliches aus dem Morgenlande_, and again _Morgenlaendische Sagen und  Geschichten_, furthermore _Brahmanische Erzaehlungen_, and lastly  _Weisheit des Brahmanen_. We shall discuss these collections in the  order here given.           *       *       *       *       *    The first collection _Erbauliches und Beschauliches_ (vol. vi.) consists  of poems which were published between the years 1822 and 1837 in  different periodicals. They appeared in collected form as a separate  work in 1837.[152] The material is drawn from Arabic and Persian  sources, only one poem, \"Die Schlange im Korbe,\" p. 80, being from the  Sanskrit of Bhartrhari (_Nitis_. 85).[153]    With the Arabic sources, the _Quran_, the chrestomathies of de Sacy and  Kosegarten, and others, we are not here concerned. Among the Persian  sources the one most frequently used is the _Gulistan_, from which are  taken, to give but a few instances, \"Sadi an den Fuerstendiener,\" p. 57  (_Gul._ i. distich 3), \"Mitgefuehl,\" p. 52 (_Gul._ i. 10, _Mathnavi_),  \"Kein Mensch zu Haus,\" p. 52 (_Gul._ vii. 19, dist. 6, Platts, p. 139),  \"Gewahrter Anstand,\" p. 55 (_Gul._ iv. _Math_. 5, Platts, p. 96), as well  as many of the proverbs and maxims, pp. 102-108. The poem \"Die Kerze und  die Flasche,\" p. 82, is a result of the poet's studies in connection  with his translation of the _Haft Qulzum_, a fragment of Amir Sahi[154]  being combined with a passage cited from Asadi.[155] \"Eine Kriegsregel  aus Mirchond,\" p. 73, is a paraphrase of a _mathnavi_ from Mirchvand's  _Raudat-ussafa_.[156] In \"Gottesdienst,\" p. 52, the first two lines  are from Amir Xusrau (_Red._ p. 229); the remaining lines were added by  Rueckert. The fables given on pp. 87-96 as from Jami are taken from the  eighth chapter or \"garden\" of that poet's _Baharistan_; they keep rather  closely to the originals, only in \"Die Rettung des Fuchses\" the  excessive naturalism of the Persian is toned down.[157] One of these  fables, however, \"Falke und Nachtigall,\" p. 89, is not from Jami, but  from the _Machsan-ul-asrar_ of Nidami ([Arabic] ed. Nathan.  Bland, London, 1844, p. 114; translated by Hammer in _Red._ p. 107).    Some of the poems in this collection are actual translations from  Persian literature. Thus \"Ein Spruch des Hafis,\" p. 59, is a fine  rendering of _qit'ah_ 583 in the form of the original.[158] Then a part  of the introduction to Nidami's _Iskandar Namah_ is given on p. 65. The  translation begins at the fortieth couplet:[159]         [Arabic]         \"Who has such boldness that from fear of Thee he open his mouth       save in submission to Thee?\"    This is well rendered:        Wer hat die Kraft, in deiner Furcht Erbebung,      Vor dir zu denken andres als Ergebung?    As will be noticed, Rueckert here has not attempted to reproduce the  _mutaqarib_, as Platen has done in his version of the first eight  couplets (see p. 36).    Some of the translations in this collection were not made directly from  the Persian, but from the versions of Hammer. Thus \"Naturbetrachtung  eines persischen Dichters,\" p. 62, is a free rendering of Hammer's  version of the invocation prefixed to Attar's _Mantiq-ut tair_ (_Red._  p. 141 seq.) and Rueckert breaks off at the same point as Hammer.[160] So  also the extract from the _Iyar-i-Danis_ of Abu'l Fadl (p. 68) is a  paraphrase of the version in _Red._ p. 397.    A number of poems deal with legends concerning Rumi, or with sayings  attributed to him. Thus the legend which tells how the poet, when a boy,  was transported to heaven in a vision, as told by Aflaki in the  _Manaqibu'l 'Arifin_,[161] forms the subject of a poem, p. 37. A saying  of Rumi concerning music prompted the composition of the poem, p. 54 (on  which see Boxberger, op. cit. p. 241), and on p. 62 the great mystic is  made to give a short statement of his peculiar Sufistic doctrine of  metempsychosis.[162] In \"Alexanders Vermaechtnis,\" p. 61, we have the  well-known legend of how the dying hero gives orders to leave one of his  hands hanging out of the coffin to show the world that of all his  possessions nothing accompanies him to the grave. In Nidami's version,  however, the hand is not left empty, but is filled with earth.[163]    Finally there are a few poems dealing with Oriental history, of which we  may mention \"Hormusan,\" p. 25, the subject being the same as in Platen's  more famous ballad. It may be that both poets drew from the same source  (see p. 37).           *       *       *       *       *    In the same year (1837) as the _Erbauliches und Beschauliches_ there  appeared the _Morgenlaendische Sagen und Geschichten_ (vol. iv.) in seven  books or divisions. In general, the contents of these divisions may be  described as versified extracts from Oriental history of prevailingly  legendary or anecdotal character. Their arrangement is mainly  chronological. Only the fourth, fifth and seventh books call for  discussion as having Persian material. The most important source is the  great historical work _Raudat us-safa_ of Mirch, portions of which  had been edited and translated before 1837 by scholars like de  Sacy,[164] Wilken,[165] Vullers[166] and others.[167]    Other sources to be mentioned are d'Herbelot's _Bibliotheque  Orientale_,[168] de Sacy's version of the _Tarich-i-Yamini_[169] and  Hammer's _Geschichte der schoenen Redekuenste Persiens_.           *       *       *       *       *    The first poem of the fourth book goes back to the legendary period of  Iran. Its hero is Gustasp, the patron and protector of Zoroaster.  Rueckert calls him Kischtasp. He does not give the story directly  according to Firdausi (tr. Mohl, iv. 224, 278-281) but makes his hero go  to Turan, whence he returns at the head of a hostile army. At the  boundary he is met, not by his brother Zarir, but simply by messengers  who offer him Iran's crown. This he accepts and thus becomes king and  protector of the realm he was about to assail.[170]    Most of the other poems in this book deal with legends of the Sassanian  dynasty. Thus \"Schapurs Ball,\" p. 114 (_Mem._ pp. 282-285); \"Die Woelfe  und Schakale Nuschirwans,\" p. 115 (_Mem._ p. 381); \"Die abgestellte  Hungersnoth,\" p. 116 (_Mem._ pp. 345, 346); \"Die Heerschau,\" p. 117  (_Mem._ p. 373). The two stories about Bahram Cubin, pp. 119-122, are  also in _Mem._ p. 395 and pp. 396, 397 respectively.[171] \"Der Mann mit  einem Arme,\" p. 124, is in _Mem._ pp. 348, 349. In the last poem  \"Yesdegerd,\" p. 126, Rueckert gives the story of the sad end of the last  Sassanian apparently according to different accounts, and not simply  according to Firdausi or Mirchvand.    The sixth book opens with the story of Muntasir, p. 198, (from d'Herb.  vol. iii. pp. 694, 695) and then we enter the period of the Saffarid  dynasty. Its founder Ya'qub is the subject of a poem, p. 207 (d'Herb.  iv. 459). \"Zu streng und zu milde\" and \"Schutz und Undank,\" both p. 210,  tell of the fortunes of Prince Qabus (Wilken, _Sam._ p. 181 and pp.  79-81, 91, 198-200, n. 47). \"Die aufgehobene Belagerung,\" p. 211, brings  us to the Buyids (d'Herb. ii. pp. 639, 640). The story of Saidah and  Mahmud, p. 212, is from Wilken's _Buj._ c. xii. pp. 87-90, but the order  of the events is changed. Then we come to the history of the Ghaznavid  dynasty, in connection with which the story of Alp Tagin is told in  \"Lokman's Wort,\" p. 214, according to the account of Haidar in Wilk.  Gasnevid. p. 139, n. 1, preceded by an anecdote told of Luqman (d'Herb.  ii. 488). \"Die Schafschur,\" p. 215, gives a saying of Sabuktagin from  the _Tarich-i-Yamini_ (on the authority of 'Utbi, de Sacy, _Notices et  Extr._ iv. 365). In the story of Mahmud's famous expedition to  Somanatha, p. 215, Rueckert has combined the meagre account of Mirchvand  with that of Firista for the story of the Brahman's offer and with that  of Haidar for the sultan's reply (Wilk. _Gasnevid._ pp. 216, 217, n.  109). \"Mahmud's Winterfeldzug,\" p. 216, is also from Wilken's book (pp.  166-168, n. 38); in fact Dilchak's reply is a rhymed translation of the  passage in the note referred to. From the same source came also the poem  on the two Dabsalims, p. 219 (Wilken, _Gasnevid._ pp."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17959"],[0,"The Hand of Fu-Manchu (#11)"],[1,"ly,  thinking I heard the pad of bare feet upon the floor behind me, the  suppressed breathing of some deathly approach.    Since nothing occurred to justify these tremors, this apprehensive  mood passed; I realized that I was growing cramped and stiff, that  unconsciously I had been sitting with my muscles nervously tensed.  The window was open a foot or so at the top and the blind was drawn;  but so accustomed were my eyes now to peering through the darkness,  that I could plainly discern the yellow oblong of the window, and  though very vaguely, some of the appointments of the room--the  Chesterfield against one wall, the lamp-shade above my head, the  table with the Tulun-Nur box upon it.    There was fog in the room, and it was growing damply chill, for we  had extinguished the electric heater some hours before. Very few  sounds penetrated from outside. Twice or perhaps thrice people passed  along the corridor, going to their rooms; but, as I knew, the greater  number of the rooms along that corridor were unoccupied.    From the Embankment far below me, and from the river, faint noises  came at long intervals it is true; the muffled hooting of motors, and  yet fainter ringing of bells. Fog signals boomed distantly, and train  whistles shrieked, remote and unreal. I determined to enter my bedroom,  and, risking any sound which I might make, to lie down upon the bed.    I rose carefully and carried this plan into execution. I would have  given much for a smoke, although my throat was parched; and almost any  drink would have been nectar. But although my hopes (or my fears) of  an intruder had left me, I determined to stick to the rules of the  game as laid down. Therefore I neither smoked nor drank, but carefully  extended my weary limbs upon the coverlet, and telling myself that I  could guard our strange treasure as well from there as from elsewhere  ... slipped off into a profound sleep.    Nothing approaching in acute and sustained horror to the moment when  next I opened my eyes exists in all my memories of those days.    In the first place I was aroused by the shaking of the bed. It was  quivering beneath me as though an earthquake disturbed the very  foundations of the building. I sprang upright and into full  consciousness of my lapse.... My hands clutching the coverlet on  either side of me, I sat staring, staring, staring ... at _that_ which  peered at me over the foot of the bed.    I knew that I had slept at my post; I was convinced that I was now  widely awake; yet I _dared_ not admit to myself that what I saw was  other than a product of my imagination. I dared not admit the physical  quivering of the bed, for I could not, with sanity, believe its cause  to be anything human. But what I saw, yet could not credit seeing,  was this:    A ghostly white face, which seemed to glisten in some faint reflected  light from the sitting-room beyond, peered over the bedrail; gibbered  at me demoniacally. With quivering hands this night-mare horror, which  had intruded where I believed human intrusion to be all but impossible,  clutched the bed-posts so that the frame of the structure shook and  faintly rattled....    My heart leapt wildly in my breast, then seemed to suspend its  pulsations and to grow icily cold. My whole body became chilled  horrifically. My scalp tingled: I felt that I must either cry out or  become stark, raving mad!    For this clammily white face, those staring eyes, that wordless  gibbering, and the shaking, shaking, shaking of the bed in the clutch  of the nameless visitant--prevailed, refused to disperse like the evil  dream I had hoped it all to be; manifested itself, indubitably, as  something tangible--objective....    Outraged reason deprived me of coherent speech. Past the clammy white  face I could see the sitting-room illuminated by a faint light; I  could even see the Tulun-Nur box upon the table immediately opposite  the door.    The thing which shook the bed was actual, existent--to be counted with!    Further and further I drew myself away from it, until I crouched close  up against the head of the bed. Then, as the thing reeled aside, and--  merciful Heaven!--made as if to come around and approach me yet closer,  I uttered a hoarse cry and hurled myself out upon the floor and on the  side remote from that pallid horror which I thought was pursuing me.    I heard a dull thud ... and the thing disappeared from my view, yet--  and remembering the supreme terror of that visitation I am not ashamed  to confess it--I dared not move from the spot upon which I stood, I  dared not make to pass that which lay between me and the door.    \"Smith!\" I cried, but my voice was little more than a hoarse whisper--  \"Smith! Weymouth!\"    The words became clearer and louder as I proceeded, so that the last--  \"Weymouth!\"--was uttered in a sort of falsetto scream.    A door burst open upon the other side of the corridor. A key was  inserted in the lock of the door. Into the dimly lighted arch which  divided the bed-room from the sitting-room, sprang the figure of  Nayland Smith!    \"Petrie! Petrie!\" he called--and I saw him standing there looking from  left to right.    Then, ere I could reply, he turned, and his gaze fell upon whatever  lay upon the floor at the foot of the bed.    \"My God!\" he whispered--and sprang into the room.    \"Smith! Smith!\" I cried, \"what is it? what is it?\"    He turned in a flash, as Weymouth entered at his heels, saw me, and  fell back a step; then looked again down at the floor.    \"God's mercy!\" he whispered, \"I thought it was you--I thought it was  you!\"    Trembling violently, my mind a feverish chaos, I moved to the foot of  the bed and looked down at what lay there.    \"Turn up the light!\" snapped Smith.    Weymouth reached for the switch, and the room became illuminated  suddenly.    Prone upon the carpet, hands outstretched and nails dug deeply into  the pile of the fabric, lay a dark-haired man having his head twisted  sideways so that the face showed a ghastly pallid profile against the  rich colorings upon which it rested. He wore no coat, but a sort of  dark gray shirt and black trousers. To add to the incongruity of his  attire, his feet were clad in drab-colored shoes, rubber-soled.    I stood, one hand raised to my head, looking down upon him, and  gradually regaining control of myself. Weymouth, perceiving something  of my condition, silently passed his flask to me; and I gladly availed  myself of this.    \"How in Heaven's name did he get in?\" I whispered.    \"How, indeed!\" said Weymouth, staring about him with wondering eyes.    Both he and Smith had discarded their disguises; and, a bewildered  trio, we stood looking down upon the man at our feet. Suddenly Smith  dropped to his knees and turned him flat upon his back. Composure was  nearly restored to me, and I knelt upon the other side of the  white-faced creature whose presence there seemed so utterly outside  the realm of possibility, and examined him with a consuming and fearful  interest; for it was palpable that, if not already dead, he was dying  rapidly.    He was a slightly built man, and the first discovery that I made was  a curious one. What I had mistaken for dark hair was a wig! The short  black mustache which he wore was also factitious.    \"Look at this!\" I cried.    \"I am looking,\" snapped Smith.    He suddenly stood up, and entering the room beyond, turned on the  light there. I saw him staring at the Tulun-Nur box, and I knew what  had been in his mind. But the box, undisturbed, stood upon the table  as we had left it. I saw Smith tugging irritably at the lobe of his  ear, and staring from the box towards the man beside whom I knelt.    \"For God's sake, what does it man?\" said Inspector Weymouth in a voice  hushed with wonder. \"How did he get in? What did he come for?--and  what has happened to him?\"    \"As to what has happened to him,\" I replied, \"unfortunately I cannot  tell you. I only know that unless something can be done his end is not  far off.\"    \"Shall we lay him on the bed?\"    I nodded, and together we raised the slight figure and placed it upon  the bed where so recently I had lain.    As we did so, the man suddenly opened his eyes, which were glazed with  delirium. He tore himself from our grip, sat bolt upright, and  holding his hands, fingers outstretched, before his face, stared at  them frenziedly.    \"The golden pomegranates!\" he shrieked, and a slight froth appeared on  his blanched lips. \"The golden pomegranates!\"    He laughed madly, and fell back inert.    \"He's dead!\" whispered Weymouth; \"he's dead!\"    Hard upon his words came a cry from Smith:    \"Quick! Petrie!--Weymouth!\"        CHAPTER XIII    THE ROOM BELOW      I ran into the sitting-room, to discover Nayland Smith craning out of  the now widely opened window. The blind had been drawn up, I did not  know by whom; and, leaning out beside my friend, I was in time to  perceive some bright object moving down the gray stone wall. Almost  instantly it disappeared from sight in the yellow banks below.    Smith leapt around in a whirl of excitement.    \"Come in, Petrie!\" he cried, seizing my arm. \"You remain here,  Weymouth; don't leave these rooms whatever happens!\"    We ran out into the corridor. For my own part I had not the vaguest  idea what we were about. My mind was not yet fully recovered from the  frightful shock which it had sustained; and the strange words of the  dying man--\"the golden pomegranates\"--had increased my mental  confusion. Smith apparently had not heard them, for he remained grimly  silent, as side by side we raced down the marble stairs to the  corridor immediately below our own.    Although, amid the hideous turmoil to which I had awakened, I had  noted nothing of the hour, evidently the night was far advanced. Not a  soul was to be seen from end to end of the vast corridor in which we  stood ... until on the right-hand side and about half-way along, a  door opened and a "]]]
