To the far North, Dartmouth, chartered in 1769, was designed first as a  mission to the Indians and then as a college for the sons of New England  farmers preparing to preach, teach, or practice law. The College of New  Jersey, organized in 1746 and removed to Princeton eleven years later,  was sustained by the Presbyterians. Two colleges looked to the  Established Church as their source of inspiration and support: William  and Mary, founded in Virginia in 1693, and King's College, now Columbia  University, chartered by King George II in 1754, on an appeal from the  New York Anglicans, alarmed at the growth of religious dissent and the  \"republican tendencies\" of the age. Two colleges revealed a drift away  from sectarianism. Brown, established in Rhode Island in 1764, and the  Philadelphia Academy, forerunner of the University of Pennsylvania,  organized by Benjamin Franklin, reflected the spirit of toleration by  giving representation on the board of trustees to several religious  sects. It was Franklin's idea that his college should prepare young men  to serve in public office as leaders of the people and ornaments to  their country.    =Self-education in America.=--Important as were these institutions of  learning, higher education was by no means confined within their walls.  Many well-to-do families sent their sons to Oxford or Cambridge in  England. Private tutoring in the home was common. In still more families  there were intelligent children who grew up in the great colonial school  of adversity and who trained themselves until, in every contest of mind  and wit, they could vie with the sons of Harvard or William and Mary or  any other college. Such, for example, was Benjamin Franklin, whose  charming autobiography, in addition to being an American classic, is a  fine record of self-education. His formal training in the classroom was  limited to a few years at a local school in Boston; but his  self-education continued throughout his life. He early manifested a zeal  for reading, and devoured, he tells us, his father's dry library on  theology, Bunyan's works, Defoe's writings, Plutarch's _Lives_, Locke's  _On the Human Understanding_, and innumerable volumes dealing with  secular subjects. His literary style, perhaps the best of his time,  Franklin acquired by the diligent and repeated analysis of the  _Spectator_. In a life crowded with labors, he found time to read widely  in natural science and to win single-handed recognition at the hands of  European savants for his discoveries in electricity. By his own efforts  he \"attained an acquaintance\" with Latin, Italian, French, and Spanish,  thus unconsciously preparing himself for the day when he was to speak  for all America at the court of the king of France.    Lesser lights than Franklin, educated by the same process, were found  all over colonial America. From this fruitful source of native ability,  self-educated, the American cause drew great strength in the trials of  the Revolution.      THE COLONIAL PRESS    =The Rise of the Newspaper.=--The evolution of American democracy into a  government by public opinion, enlightened by the open discussion of  political questions, was in no small measure aided by a free press. That  too, like education, was a matter of slow growth. A printing press was  brought to Massachusetts in 1639, but it was put in charge of an  official censor and limited to the publication of religious works. Forty  years elapsed before the first newspaper appeared, bearing the curious  title, _Public Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestic_, and it had not  been running very long before the government of Massachusetts suppressed  it for discussing a political question.    Publishing, indeed, seemed to be a precarious business; but in 1704  there came a second venture in journalism, _The Boston News-Letter_,  which proved to be a more lasting enterprise because it refrained from  criticizing the authorities. Still the public interest languished. When  Franklin's brother, James, began to issue his _New England Courant_  about 1720, his friends sought to dissuade him, saying that one  newspaper was enough for America. Nevertheless he continued it; and his  confidence in the future was rewarded. In nearly every colony a gazette  or chronicle appeared within the next thirty years or more. Benjamin  Franklin was able to record in 1771 that America had twenty-five  newspapers. Boston led with five. Philadelphia had three: two in English  and one in German.    =Censorship and Restraints on the Press.=--The idea of printing,  unlicensed by the government and uncontrolled by the church, was,  however, slow in taking form. The founders of the American colonies had  never known what it was to have the free and open publication of books,  pamphlets, broadsides, and newspapers. When the art of printing was  first discovered, the control of publishing was vested in clerical  authorities. After the establishment of the State Church in England in  the reign of Elizabeth, censorship of the press became a part of royal  prerogative. Printing was restricted to Oxford, Cambridge, and London;  and no one could publish anything without previous approval of the  official censor. When the Puritans were in power, the popular party,  with a zeal which rivaled that of the crown, sought, in turn, to silence  royalist and clerical writers by a vigorous censorship. After the  restoration of the monarchy, control of the press was once more placed  in royal hands, where it remained until 1695, when Parliament, by  failing to renew the licensing act, did away entirely with the official  censorship. By that time political parties were so powerful and so  active and printing presses were so numerous that official review of all  published matter became a sheer impossibility.    In America, likewise, some troublesome questions arose in connection  with freedom of the press. The Puritans of Massachusetts were no less  anxious than King Charles or the Archbishop of London to shut out from  the prying eyes of the people all literature \"not mete for them to  read\"; and so they established a system of official licensing for  presses, which lasted until 1755. In the other colonies where there was  more diversity of opinion and publishers could set up in business with  impunity, they were nevertheless constantly liable to arrest for  printing anything displeasing to the colonial governments. In 1721 the  editor of the _Mercury_ in Philadelphia was called before the  proprietary council and ordered to apologize for a political article,  and for a later offense of a similar character he was thrown into jail.  A still more famous case was that of Peter Zenger, a New York publisher,  who was arrested in 1735 for criticising the administration. Lawyers who  ventured to defend the unlucky editor were deprived of their licenses to  practice, and it became necessary to bring an attorney all the way from  Philadelphia. By this time the tension of feeling was high, and the  approbation of the public was forthcoming when the lawyer for the  defense exclaimed to the jury that the very cause of liberty itself, not  that of the poor printer, was on trial! The verdict for Zenger, when it  finally came, was the signal for an outburst of popular rejoicing.  Already the people of King George's province knew how precious a thing  is the freedom of the press.    Thanks to the schools, few and scattered as they were, and to the  vigilance of parents, a very large portion, perhaps nearly one-half, of  the colonists could read. Through the newspapers, pamphlets, and  almanacs that streamed from the types, the people could follow the  course of public events and grasp the significance of political  arguments. An American opinion was in the process of making--an  independent opinion nourished by the press and enriched by discussions  around the fireside and at the taverns. When the day of resistance to  British rule came, government by opinion was at hand. For every person  who could hear the voice of Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams, there were a  thousand who could see their appeals on the printed page. Men who had  spelled out their letters while poring over Franklin's _Poor Richard's  Almanac_ lived to read Thomas Paine's thrilling call to arms.      THE EVOLUTION IN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS    Two very distinct lines of development appeared in colonial politics.  The one, exalting royal rights and aristocratic privileges, was the  drift toward provincial government through royal officers appointed in  England. The other, leading toward democracy and self-government, was  the growth in the power of the popular legislative assembly. Each  movement gave impetus to the other, with increasing force during the  passing years, until at last the final collision between the two ideals  of government came in the war of independence.    =The Royal Provinces.=--Of the thirteen English colonies eight were  royal provinces in 1776, with governors appointed by the king. Virginia  passed under the direct rule of the crown in 1624, when the charter of  the London Company was annulled. The Massachusetts Bay corporation lost  its charter in 1684, and the new instrument granted seven years later  stripped the colonists of the right to choose their chief executive. In  the early decades of the eighteenth century both the Carolinas were  given the provincial instead of the proprietary form. New Hampshire,  severed from Massachusetts in 1679, and Georgia, surrendered by the  trustees in 1752, went into the hands of the crown. New York,  transferred to the Duke of York on its capture from the Dutch in 1664,  became a province when he took the title of James II in 1685. New  Jersey, after remaining for nearly forty years under proprietors, was  brought directly under the king in 1702. Maryland, Pennsylvania, and  Delaware, although they retained"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16965"],[0,"Queen Victoria (#11)"],[1,"are taken to reform  young criminals on the sound principle of \"prevention is better than  cure.\"    Mary Carpenter also visited India no fewer than four times in order  to arouse public opinion there to the need for the better education  of women, and at a later date she went to America, where she had many  warm friends and admirers. She had, as was only natural, been keenly  interested in the abolition of negro slavery.    One of the most distinguished women in literature during the  Victorian Age was Harriet Martineau. At an early age it was evident  that she was gifted beyond the ordinary, and at seven years old she  had read Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" and learnt long portions of it by  heart.    Her health was extremely poor; she suffered as a child from imaginary  terrors which she describes in her Autobiography, and she gradually  became deaf. She bore this affliction with the greatest courage and  cheerfulness, but misfortunes followed one another in rapid  succession. Her elder brother died of consumption, her father lost  large sums of money in business, and the grief and anxiety so preyed  upon his mind that he died, leaving his family very badly off.    This, and the loss later on of the little money they had left, only  served to strengthen Miss Martineau's purpose. She studied and wrote  until late in the night, and after her first success in literature,  when she won all three prizes offered by the Unitarian body for an  essay, she set to work on a series of stories which were to illustrate  such subjects as the effect of machinery upon wages, free trade, etc.    After the manuscript had been refused by numerous publishers, she  succeeded in getting it accepted, and the book proved an  extraordinary success.    She moved to London, and her house soon became the centre where the  best of literature and politics could always be discussed. She was  consulted even by Cabinet Ministers, but in spite of all the praise  and adulation she remained quite unspoiled.    The idea of women taking part in public movements was still not  altogether pleasing to the majority of people, who were apt to look  upon 'learned' women as 'Blue-stockings,' a name first used in  England in the previous century in rather a contemptuous way.        Come, let us touch the string,      And try a song to sing,        Though this is somewhat difficult at starting, O!      And in our case more than ever,      When a desperate endeavour,        Is made to sing the praise of Harry Martineau!        Of bacon, eggs, and butter,      Rare philosophy she'll utter;        Not a thing about your house but she'll take part in, O!      As to mine, with all my soul,      She might take (and pay) the whole--        But that is all my eye and Harry Martineau!        Her political economy      Is as true as Deuteronomy;        And the monster of Distress she sticks a dart in, O!      Yet still he stalks about,      And makes a mighty rout,        But that we hope's my eye and Harry Martineau!    In 1835 she visited the United States, and here she was able to study  the question of slavery. She joined the body of the 'Abolitionists,'  and as a result was attacked from all sides with the utmost fury,  for the Northern States stood solid against abolition. But she  remained unmoved in her opinion, and when in 1862 the great Civil  War broke out, her writings were the means of educating public  opinion. It was largely due to her that this country did not foolishly  support the secession of the Southern States from the Union.    During a period of five years she was a complete invalid, and some  of her best books, including her well-known stories for children,  _Feats on the Fiord_ and _The Crofton Boys_, were written in that  time.    After her recovery her life was busier than ever. She wrote articles  for the daily papers, but her chief pleasure lay in devising schemes  for improving the lot of her poorer neighbours. She organized evening  lectures for the people, and founded a Mechanics' Institute and a  building society.    During her life-time she was the acknowledged leader on all moral  questions, especially those which affected the lives of women.    \"It has always been esteemed our special function as women,\" she said,  \"to mount guard over society and social life--the spring of national  existence.\"          CHAPTER IX: _Balmoral_      It was in Balmoral Castle that the husband and wife most loved to  be with their children. Here they could lead a simple life free from  all restraints, \"small house, small rooms, small establishment. . . .  There are no soldiers, and the whole guard of the Sovereign consists  of a single policeman, who walks about the grounds to keep off  impertinent intruders and improper characters. . . . The Prince  shoots every morning, returns to luncheon, and then they walk or  drive. The Queen is running in and out of the house all day long,  and often goes about alone, walks into the cottages, and chats with  the old women.\"    The Queen loved her life here even more than the Prince, and every  year she yearned for it more and more. \"It is not alone the pure air,  the quiet and beautiful scenery, which makes it so delightful,\" she  wrote; \"it is the atmosphere of loving affection, and the hearty  attachment of the people around Balmoral which warms the heart and  does one good.\"    It was during the year 1848 that the royal couple paid their first  visit to Balmoral. The Queen had long wished to possess a home of  her own in the Highlands where her husband could indulge in some  outdoor sport, and where they both could enjoy a brief rest, from  time to time, from the anxiety and care of State affairs.    Their life there during the years 1848-61 is described by the Queen  in her diary, _Leaves from the Journal of our Life in the Highlands_.  It was first published after the Prince's death and was dedicated  to him in the words: \"To the dear memory of him who made the life  of the writer bright and happy, these simple records are lovingly  and gratefully inscribed.\"    The first impressions were very favourable: \"It is a pretty little  castle in the old Scottish style. There is a picturesque tower and  garden in front, with a high wooded hill; at the back there is wood  down to the Dee; and the hills rise all around.\"    Their household was, naturally, a small one, consisting of the  Queen's Maid of Honour, the Prince's valet, a cook, a footman, and  two maids. Among the outdoor attendants was John Brown, who in 1858  was attached to the Queen as one of her regular attendants everywhere  in the Highlands, and remained in her service until his death. \"He  has all the independence and elevated feelings peculiar to the  Highland race, and is singularly straightforward, simple-minded,  kind-hearted and disinterested; always ready to oblige; and of a  discretion rarely to be met with.\"    The old castle soon proved to be too small for the family, and in  September 1853 the foundation-stone of a new house was laid. After  the ceremony the workmen were entertained at dinner, which was  followed by Highland games and dancing in the ballroom.    Two years later they entered the new castle, which the Queen  described as \"charming; the rooms delightful; the furniture, papers,  everything perfection.\"    The Prince was untiring in planning improvements, and in 1856 the  Queen wrote: \"Every year my heart becomes more fixed in this dear  Paradise, and so much more so now, that _all_ has become my dearest  Albert's _own_ creation, own work, own building, own laying out as  at Osborne; and his great taste, and the impress of his dear hand,  have been stamped everywhere. He was very busy today, settling and  arranging many things for next year.\"    Visits to the cottages of the old people on the estate and in the  neighbourhood were a constant source of delight and pleasure to the  Queen, and often when the Prince was away for the day shooting, she  would pay a round of calls, taking with her little presents. The old  ladies especially loved a talk with their Queen. \"The affection of  these good people, who are so hearty and so happy to see you, taking  interest in everything, is very touching and gratifying,\" she  remarked upon them. \"We were always in the habit of conversing with  the Highlanders--with whom one comes so much in contact in the  Highlands. The Prince highly appreciated the good breeding,  simplicity, and intelligence, which make it so pleasant, and even  instructive to talk to them.\"    In September 1855, soon after moving into the new castle, the news  arrived of the fall of Sebastopol, and this was taken as an omen of  good luck. The Prince and his suite sallied forth, followed by all  the population, to the cairn above Balmoral, and here, amid general  cheering, a large bonfire was lit. The pipes played wildly, the  people danced and shouted, guns and squibs were fired off, and it  was not until close upon midnight that the festivities came to an  end.    During the same month the Princess Royal became engaged to Prince  Frederick William of Prussia, who was then visiting Balmoral. Acting  on the Queen's advice, Prince Frederick did not postpone his good  fortune until a later date, as he had at first intended, but during  a ride up Craig-na-Ban, he picked a piece of white heather (the emblem  of 'good luck') and offered it to the young Princess, and this gave  him an opportunity of declaring his love.    These extracts, printed from the Queen's Journals, were intended at  first for presentation only to members of the Royal Family and Her  Majesty's intimate friends, especially to those who had accompanied  her during her tours. It was, however, suggested to the Queen that  her people would take even as keen an interest in these simple records  of family life, especially as they had already shown sincere and  ready sympathy with her personal joys and sorrows.    \"The book,\" its editor says, \"is mainly"]]]
