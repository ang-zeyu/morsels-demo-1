Arthur has come on from Cambridge, where he has just taken  his degree as a lawyer, to make us a visit of some weeks, and we have  had much pleasure talking over with him those poetic days that we  passed together in Florence and Venice.    But _our_ life is never made up of talking and dreaming, delightful  though it may be, and we have a certain amount of reading to do every  day, which we despatch as conscientiously as we do our prayers.  There  is no rule, however, limiting the reading to any one person, and Arthur  often relieves us of that duty.  I enjoy his reading very much,  especially when one of Plato's \"Dialogues\" is the lesson of the day,  for into them he throws so much enthusiasm and dramatic force, that  they are quite a revelation to me.  I was amused this morning, upon  turning over the leaves of my journal of last winter, to find my first  impressions of the \"Dialogues\" thus laconically expressed:    \"I have to-day commenced to read Plato aloud.  I cannot say that I find  him very refreshing as yet; still I try to admire him as much as I  conscientiously can.\"    I must confess that at first the abstruse subtleties of Socrates and  his brother logicians were too much for my little brain, but now that I  am more familiar with them, I quite delight in following their  arguments.  These \"Dialogues\" remind me of a fugue in musical  composition; only melody is wanting to make the resemblance perfect,  for here, as in the \"Well-tempered Harpsichord,\" one train of thought  is taken up, viewed from every side and in every light--that is to say,  pursued through every possible key only to return and end at the  original starting-point.

Father was by no means a  common man, for to be 'common' one must be vulgar or ignorant, and  father was neither.  He was not uneducated, although his schooling was  very slight; but he was a good reader, was very skilful in arithmetic,  and wrote an excellent hand--an accomplishment for which our family are  not celebrated--beside possessing a hoard of self-acquired information  upon different subjects.  During the long winter evenings in our lonely  Pennsylvania home, he taught us younger children arithmetic, and was  very fond of giving us long sums to puzzle out.  I have often, heard  him say to brother Barnes,    \"'You must store your mind with useful knowledge, that when you go out  into the world you will have something to talk about as well as other  people.'    \"A poor farmer in those days did not have much opportunity to acquire  accomplishments, as you may well imagine; but father possessed one  talent that, if properly directed, might have made his fortune and  ours.  I have never yet heard a natural voice that excelled your  grandfather's; a high, clear, powerful tenor, with unsurpassed strength  of lungs, which, added to his handsome presence, would have made him  one of the finest singers that has yet trodden the boards.  Of course  his voice was uncultivated, with the exception of the slight training  of country singing-classes, and the songs that he knew were simple  ballads; but his memory was very retentive, and his singing was in  great demand when company was present.  At husking-parties and  apple-bees, when supper was over and the young people wished to dance,  if no fiddler was present, father would be petitioned to sing.  I have  often known him to sing country dances for hours, and he sung so  heartily, and marked the time so well, that the young people enjoyed  the dancing as much as if the music had been furnished by the most  skilful violinist.    \"I told you that father was a handsome man.  He had large blue eyes,  soft, silky, brown curls clustering around a magnificent brow, a set  color in his cheeks, and a hand that the hardest field labor could not  deprive of its beauty--long, tapering fingers, and pointed nails, such  as novelists love to describe, but in real life are rarely seen outside  of the most aristocratic families.  His teeth were small, white and  even, and at the time of his death, when eighty-seven years old, he had  only lost one.  His figure, though less than six feet, gave the  impression of a much taller man; for he was slenderly built without  being thin, and his carriage was almost military.  To this fine  presence was added an air of dignity and almost _hauteur_, that was  very unusual in a poor farmer.  But father was proud to an unparalleled  degree.  Indeed, it was his pride that caused him to plunge into the  wild forests of Pennsylvania.  His haughty nature could not bear the  life of subordination that he led in Vermont, where he did not own an  acre of land, and was obliged to work under the orders of others, often  far inferior to him, and where he fancied the story of his flight from  New Hampshire was known to every one.  Smarting with mortification, he  toiled until he could save a few hundred dollars to buy some acres in  the wilderness, far from all his former associates, and there he buried  himself with my dear mother and their five little children.  But these  morose feelings were somewhat subdued as the years rolled on.    \"With his children he was affectionate, but, like an old-school father,  very distant.  He never struck one of us in his life--a glance being  sufficient to enforce obedience, or subdue the wildest spirits.  He was  always as particular about the etiquette of the table as though we were  served by footmen in livery; and in our poorest days, when cups and  saucers were scant and spoons still more so, we were obliged to observe  the utmost decorum till we were helped; and any laughing or chatter  among the younger ones was immediately quelled by the emphatic descent  of father's fork upon the coverless table, with the words, 'Children,  silence!'    \"Father was highly respected by our neighbors in Pennsylvania, and was  often urged to accept some county office.  However, he always declined.\"    \"Do you think, mamma,\" said Marguerite, \"that grandmamma was as  handsome as grandpapa?\"    A pause of a moment or two.    \"They were very different,\" was her reply.  \"Mother had neither  father's brilliant face, nor his imposing presence, but she was a very  handsome woman.  She had soft blue eyes, a perfectly straight nose, a  mouth rather large, perhaps, for beauty, but full of character, brown  hair tinged with red, and a transparent, though not pallid complexion.  If you wish more minute details, look at your uncle's picture.  No man  ever resembled a woman more strikingly than he did our dear mother.\"    \"In a recently published life of uncle,\" said I, \"the author speaks of  grandmamma as often working in the fields, and describes her as large  and muscular, and possessing the strength of a man.  Is not that an  exaggeration?\"    \"Mother was above medium height,\" was mamma's reply, \"but her figure  was slender, with small and well-shaped hands and feet.  It was her  pride that water could flow under the arch of her instep; and her  fingers, notwithstanding the hard toil of daily life, remained so  flexible, that, when fifty years old, she could still bend them  _backwards_ to form a drinking-cup.\"    \"Let me tell you, Aunt Esther,\" interposed Ida, \"how grandmamma is  remembered in Vermont.  When Gabrielle and I were quite small children,  we went there on a visit, and papa took us to see some old lady (whose  name I have forgotten) residing in Westhaven.  This lady had known  grandmamma very well, and, after contemplating Gabrielle and I for some  time, remarked curtly, 'Neither of you children are as handsome as your  grandmother was.'\"    This uncomplimentary remark caused us all to laugh heartily.  Mamma  then resumed her story.    \"As for field labor, your grandmother may, while we were in New  Hampshire, have sometimes assisted father for a day or two during the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18298"],[0,"Essays in Natural History and Agriculture (#11)"],[1,"quite full of Salmon  roe. If this had been buried eighteen inches in the gravel (as  Salmo Salar suggests), the duck would have had some difficulty in  extracting it; but so far as my experience goes, it is not usually  one-half that depth, although this varies in different rivers.  Then, if one Salmon is able to plough up gravel which is cemented  together by sand and long continuance in one place, why should not  another be able to do the same when the gravel is loose and easily  removed? But there is another enemy whom Salmo Salar has not  mentioned, who does more harm than all the rest: that is the  poacher, and I fear that many of the Salmon which Salmo Salar saw  spawning in the Hodder and its tributaries have since then made a  journey overland. At all events, I am credibly informed that in  one season a gang of poachers took seventy Salmon in the Hodder.  Is he sure they have taken none this season? Salmo Salar seems to  think that one pair of Salmon will not spawn on the same ground,  which has been previously occupied by another pair; but he has  only to watch the same ridd for a week or two to be convinced he  is mistaken. As to fish refusing to spawn on new gravel, I may  state that when Mr. Fawkes was making his experiments at Farnley  he put some new gravel into his brook, and there were sixteen  pairs of Trout spawning on it the next morning. Salmo Salar says  that if he can have those simple checks which he enumerates to the  present practices, he will restore abundance of Salmon to the  Ribble; they are all very good in their way, but do not go quite  far enough, and they would do very little good without a fourth,  namely, protection from the poacher for the fish on the spawning  beds. Until this can be given more efficiently than it is at  present, all the rest will be unavailing; and until the upper  proprietors can have a greater interest in the preservation of  Salmon than they now have, they cannot be expected to give  themselves much trouble on the subject.    My readers would not be much edified by strong assertion and  counter-assertion of what Trout do, and what they cannot do; nor  is it probable that where we differ we should convince each other;  neither do I see any occasion for personality, when both parties  are actuated by the same motives--a desire to see the Salmon  fisheries restored to a state of great prosperity. I therefore  avoid noticing some of Salmo Salar's remarks, which seem to me a  little tinged with this spirit, and hope we shall be able to act  in concert for the attainment of that desirable result. Salmo  Salar will find that the number of Smolts is not always determined  by the quantity of ova deposited: if he will examine the bed of  the Hodder the next low water, he will find many of the ridds  disturbed by the ice floods of yesterday; and if he doubts this, I  shall be happy to examine them along with him, if he will give me  previous notice of his intention.    Since the above was written I have seen Ramsbottom, who tells me  that the stream in the Tay, where he caught the whole of the fish  from which he obtained 300,000 to 400,000 ova, was on one side of  it one continuous ridd, and that the fish could not avoid  ploughing up the gravel which previous fish had spawned in, and at  Oughterard, where 300 pairs of fish spawned in the same number of  yards, it was the same; and they found thousands of ova buried so  deep that they were rotting in great quantities.    With regard to what Salmo Salar says about the infrequency of a  veritable spawning bed being washed away by floods, I refer him to  what I have said previously; but Ramsbottom tells me the game-  keeper at Harden (Haworth) will be able to give him sufficient  proof that in the Langden Brook this has occurred, as he found the  ova on the dry land by thousands, which had been left there by the  flood.    When Ramsbottom was at Perth he found on one of the fords, a space  of twenty yards long and fourteen yards wide, filled with ridds,  which was entirely left dry. What would become of all the spawn  deposited there?    Salmo Salar seems to think nature is quite sufficient to take care  of her own interests without our interference, and that without  some counter-acting influence to keep the breed of fish in check,  the river would not hold all that would be bred. I quite agree  with him in this, provided nature had fair play; but she has not,  and occasionally needs a little help: else why do we employ game-  keepers to trap cats, foxes, and weasels, to shoot hawks, carrion  crows, and magpies, and to breed pheasants, as well as to prevent  poaching? If these precautions are unnecessary, why go to such  expense? and if they are necessary for hares and birds, may they  not be also for fish?    I hope Salmo Salar will investigate what I said about walling in  of the Smolts in Langden Brook. I fancy he may have seen these  enclosures himself; at all events, I have, and although I cannot  prove they were erected for that purpose, I do not doubt the  accuracy of my information.    I am, Sir,  Yours very truly,  THOMAS GARNETT.    * * * * *    The following letter was sent to me from Chester:--    CHESTER, _3rd February_, 1854.    SIR,--We are about to make application to Parliament for a  Commission of Inquiry into the state of laws respecting the  fisheries of England and Wales. And Mr. Ashworth, of Poynton, has  been so good as to refer me to you, as able and willing to furnish  us with information on the subject.    The annual meeting of the river Dee fishery association will be  held on the 20th instant, when I purpose to lay before them the  draft of a petition to Parliament for their approval.    I am anxious in the meantime to obtain all the information  possible relative to the working of the present laws, their  defects, and the alterations to be proposed in them, in order that  a condensed statement may be embodied in the petition as the  ground of our application.    I should be exceedingly obliged for any remarks your experience  may suggest, and trust you will accept the cause which dictates my  writing as a sufficient apology for troubling you on the subject.    I have had great pleasure in reading your able replies to Salmo  Salar's letters. On the appearance of the first, I was strongly  prompted to reply to it myself, but rejoiced to find him in much  better hands.    I remain, Sir,  Yours very truly,  WILLIAM AYRTON.    * * * * *    CLITHEROE, _4th February_, 1854.    TO WM. AYRTON, ESQ.    DEAR SIR,--I am favoured with your letter of yesterday, and shall  be glad to give you any information I may possess on the habits of  Salmon, or the requirements of any act of Parliament necessary for  the preservation and increase of this valuable fish. Being a mill-  owner, I have interests which are supposed to clash with those of  fish preservers; but I hope to be able to show that all mill-  owners are able to give a passage over their weirs at all times  when the fish are inclined to run; that is, when there are freshes  in the river. I say this the more confidently, as I believe the  works here are the largest in England for the power of the stream  they stand upon, and I find it necessary to employ 150 horse-power  of steam. Yet I find from a careful register, which has been kept  here since the year 1838, that we are able, without interfering  with the efficiency of the water power, to give the fish a passage  over the weir 181 days, or part of days, annually, and this at  times when alone they are disposed to avail themselves of such a  passage--that is in floods.    The suggestions that occur to me from time to time I will not fail  to send you. At present the following seem to me to be essential,  to give efficacy to any Act of Parliament framed for the purpose  of preserving and increasing the breed of Salmon, for without some  such provisions the gentlemen on the upper parts of rivers will  have no inducement to exert themselves in the matter.    First.--No nets or other engines, except rod and line, should be  used for taking fish from six o'clock at night to six o'clock in  the morning, and all fish should be allowed a free passage up the  stream every night when this does not destroy or impair the  efficacy of the water power.    Second.--No mill-owner nor his servants, nor any other person,  should be allowed to take fish at his weir, or within fifty yards  of it.    Third.--Conservators should be allowed to go into all wheel-races,  wheel-houses and tail-goits, and also upon all lands on the banks  of Salmon rivers, as well as inspect all cruives, weirs, &c.,  without being deemed guilty of trespass.    Fourth.--All weirs kept solely for fishing purposes, cruives, &c.,  should be compelled to give a free passage to the fish every night  from six o'clock to six o'clock in the morning; and any  obstruction placed in the gap calculated to hinder or frighten the  fish back, should be deemed breaches of the Act of Parliament and  liable to a penalty.    Fifth.--All nets and other devices for catching Eels should be  prohibited in April, May, and June.    Sixth.--Close time should be altered and extended, as well as made  uniform, in all rivers.    Seventh.--The sale and use of Salmon roe should be prohibited.    Eighth.--Justices should be enabled to assist the passage of fish  over weirs by any contrivance which did not impair their stability  nor the efficiency of the water power.    Ninth.--All cruives should be formed of vertical bars, and should  have the intervening spaces to measure not less than three inches.    Tenth.--No nets used in a Salmon river should measure in the mesh  less than two inches and a half from knot to knot.    Eleventh.--Any person having no right of fishing found with a net  in his possession or a Salmon out of season, should be guilty of  misdemeanour.    Twelfth.--A ten shillings' licence for angling for Salmon.    The reasons for most of these"]]]
