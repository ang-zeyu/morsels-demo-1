And for the better execution of these orders, and such other rules       and directions as upon further consideration shall be found       needful, it is ordered and enjoined that the aldermen, deputies,       and common councilmen shall meet together weekly, once, twice,       thrice, or oftener, as cause shall require, at some one general       place accustomed in their respective wards, being clear from       infection of the plague, to consult how the said orders may be put       in execution, not intending that any dwelling in or near places       infected shall come to the said meeting while their coming may be       doubtful. And the said aldermen, deputies, and common councilmen,       in their several wards, may put in execution any other orders that       by them, at their said meetings, shall be conceived and devised for       the preservation of his Majesty's subjects from the infection.

I need not say that these orders extended only to such places as were  within the lord mayor's jurisdiction: so it is requisite to observe that  the justices of peace within those parishes and places as were called  the \"hamlets\" and \"outparts\" took the same method. As I remember, the  orders for shutting up of houses did not take place so soon on our side,  because, as I said before, the plague did not reach to this eastern part  of the town at least, nor begin to be violent till the beginning of  August. For example, the whole bill from the 11th to the 18th of July  was 1,761, yet there died but 71 of the plague in all those parishes we  call the Tower Hamlets; and they were as follows:--        Aldgate,                 14                 {  34          {  65      Stepney,                 33   The next      {  58   To     {  76      Whitechapel,             21   week was      {  48   Aug. 1 {  79      St. Kath.

Complaints of the severity of it were also daily brought  to my lord mayor, of houses causelessly, and some maliciously, shut up.  I cannot say but upon inquiry many that complained so loudly were found  in a condition to be continued; and others again, inspection being made  upon the sick person, and the sickness not appearing infectious, or, if  uncertain, yet, on his being content to be carried to the pesthouse,  was[96] released.    As I went along Houndsditch one morning, about eight o'clock, there was  a great noise. It is true, indeed, there was not much crowd, because the  people were not very free to gather together, or to stay long together  when they were there, nor did I stay long there; but the outcry was loud  enough to prompt my curiosity, and I called to one, who looked out of a  window, and asked what was the matter.    A watchman, it seems, had been employed to keep his post at the door of  a house which was infected, or said to be infected, and was shut up. He  had been there all night, for two nights together, as he told his story,  and the day watchman had been there one day, and was now come to relieve  him. All this while no noise had been heard in the house, no light had  been seen, they called for nothing, sent him of no errands (which used  to be the chief business of the watchmen), neither had they given him  any disturbance, as he said, from Monday afternoon, when he heard a  great crying and screaming in the house, which, as he supposed, was  occasioned by some of the family dying just at that time. It seems the  night before, the \"dead cart,\" as it was called, had been stopped there,  and a servant maid had been brought down to the door dead; and the  \"buriers\" or \"bearers,\" as they were called, put her into the cart,  wrapped only in a green rug, and carried her away.    The watchman had knocked at the door, it seems, when he heard that noise  and crying, as above, and nobody answered a great while; but at last one  looked out and said with an angry, quick tone, and yet a kind of crying  voice, or a voice of one that was crying, \"What d'ye want, that you make  such a knocking?\" He answered, \"I am the watchman. How do you do? What  is the matter?\" The person answered, \"What is that to you? Stop the dead  cart.\" This, it seems, was about one o'clock. Soon after, as the fellow  said, he stopped the dead cart, and then knocked again, but nobody  answered; he continued knocking, and the bellman called out several  times, \"Bring out your dead;\" but nobody answered, till the man that  drove the cart, being called to other houses, would stay no longer, and  drove away.    The watchman knew not what to make of all this, so he let them alone  till the morning man, or \"day watchman,\" as they called him, came to  relieve him. Giving him an account of the particulars, they knocked at  the door a great while, but nobody answered; and they observed that the  window or casement at which the person looked out who had answered  before, continued open, being up two pair of stairs.    Upon this, the two men, to satisfy their curiosity, got a long ladder,  and one of them went up to the window and looked into the room, where he  saw a woman lying dead upon the floor, in a dismal manner, having no  clothes on her but her shift.[97] But though he called aloud, and,  putting in his long staff, knocked hard on the floor, yet nobody stirred  or answered, neither could he hear any noise in the house.    He came down again upon this, and acquainted his fellow, who went up  also; and finding it just so, they resolved to acquaint either the lord  mayor or some other magistrate of it, but did not offer to go in at the  window. The magistrate, it seems, upon the information of the two men,  ordered the house to be broke open, a constable and other persons being  appointed to be present, that nothing might be plundered; and  accordingly it was so done, when nobody was found in the house but that  young woman, who having been infected, and past recovery, the rest had  left her to die by herself, and every one gone, having found some way to  delude the watchman, and to get open the door, or get out at some back  door, or over the tops of the houses, so that he knew nothing of it. And  as to those cries and shrieks which he heard, it was supposed they were  the passionate cries of the family at this bitter parting, which, to be  sure, it was to them all, this being the sister to the mistress of the  family; the man of the house, his wife, several children and servants,  being all gone and fled: whether sick or sound, that I could never  learn, nor, indeed, did I make much inquiry after it.    At another house, as I was informed, in the street next within Aldgate,  a whole family was shut up and locked in because the maidservant was  taken sick. The master of the house had complained by his friends to the  next alderman, and to the lord mayor, and had consented to have the maid  carried to the pesthouse, but was refused: so the door was marked with a  red cross, a padlock on the outside, as above, and a watchman set to  keep the door, according to public order.    After the master of the house found there was no remedy, but that he,  his wife, and his children, were locked up with this poor distempered  servant, he called to the watchman, and told him he must go then and  fetch a nurse for them to attend this poor girl, for that it would be  certain death to them all to oblige them to nurse her, and told him  plainly that if he would not do this the maid would perish either[98] of  the distemper, or be starved for want of food, for he was resolved none  of his family should go near her; and she lay in the garret, four story  high, where she could not cry out or call to anybody for help.    The watchman consented to that, and went and fetched a nurse as he was  appointed, and brought her to them the same evening. During this  interval, the master of the house took his opportunity to break a large  hole through his shop into a bulk or stall, where formerly a cobbler had  sat before or under his shop window; but the tenant, as may be supposed,  at such a dismal time as that, was dead or removed, and so he had the  key in his own keeping. Having[99] made his way into this stall, which  he could not have done if the man had been at the door, the noise he was  obliged to make being such as would have alarmed the watchman,--I say,  having made his way into this stall, he sat still till the watchman  returned with the nurse, and all the next day also; but the night  following, having contrived to send the watchman of another trifling  errand (which, as I take it, was to an apothecary's for a plaster for  the maid, which he was to stay for the making up, or some other such  errand that might secure his staying some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1723"],[0,"Cow-Country (#11)"],[1,"it back toward the  herd, and in another hundred yards or so Bud must throw his loop He  sliced off a saddle-string and took it between his teeth, jerked his  rope loose, flipped open the loop as Stopper raced up alongside, dropped  the noose neatly, and took his turns while Stopper planted his forefeet  and braced himself for the shock. Bud's right leg was over the cantle,  all his weight on the left stirrup when the jerk came and the steer fell  with a thump. By good luck--so Bud afterwards asserted--he was off and  had the steer tied before it had recovered its breath to scramble up.  He remounted, flipped off the loop and recoiled his rope while he went  jogging up to meet a rider coming out to him.    If he expected thanks for what he had done, he must have received a  shock. Other riders had left their posts and were edging up to hear  what happened, and Bud reined up in astonishment before the most amazing  string of unseemly epithets he had ever heard. It began with: \"What'd  you throw that critter for?\"--which of course is putting it mildly--and  ended in a choked phrase which one man may not use to another's face and  expect anything but trouble afterwards.    Bud unbuckled his gun and hung the belt on his saddle horn, and  dismounted. \"Get off your horse and take the damnedest licking you ever  had in your life, for that!\" He invited vengefully. \"You told me to  tie down that steer, and I tied him down. You've got no call to  complain--and there isn't a man on earth I'll take that kinda talk  from. Crawl down, you parrot-faced cow-eater--and leave your gun on the  saddle.\"    The man remained where he was and looked Bud over uncertainly. \"Who are  you, and where'd yuh come from?\" he demanded more calmly. \"I never saw  yuh before.\"    \"Well, I never grew up with your face before me, either!\" Bud snapped.  \"If I had I'd probably be cross-eyed by now. You called me something!  Get off that horse or I'll pull you off!\"    \"Aw, yuh don't want to mind--\" began a tall, lean man pacifically; but  he of the high nose stopped him with a wave of the hand, his eyes still  measuring the face, the form and the fighting spirit of one Bud Birnie,  standing with his coat off, quivering with rage.    \"I guess I'm in the wrong, young fellow--I DID holler 'Tie 'im down.'  But if you'd ever been around this outfit any you 'd have known I didn't  mean it literal.\" He stopped and suddenly he laughed. \"I've been yellin'  'Tie 'im down' for two years and more, when a critter breaks outa the  bunch, and nobody was ever fool enough to tackle it before. It's just a  sayin' we've got, young man. We--\"    \"What about the name you called me?\" Bud was still advancing slowly, not  much appeased by the explanation. \"I don't give a darn about the steer.  You said tie him, and he's tied. But when you call me--\"    \"My mistake, young feller. When I get riled up I don't pick my words.\"  He eyed Bud sharply. \"You're mighty quick to obey orders,\" He added  tentatively.    \"I was brought up to do as I'm told,\" Bud retorted stiffly. \"Any  objections to make?\"    \"Not one in the world. Wish there was more like yuh. You ain't been in  these parts long?\" His tone made a question of the statement.    \"Not right here.\" Bud had no reason save his temper for not giving  more explicit information, but Bart Nelson--as Bud knew him  afterwards--continued to study him as if he suspected a blotched past.    \"Hunh. That your horse?\"    \"I've got a bill of sale for him.\"    \"You don't happen to be wanting a job, I s'pose?\"    \"I wouldn't refuse to take one.\" And then the twinkle came back to Bud's  eyes, because all at once the whole incident struck him as being rather  funny. \"I'd want a boss that expected to have his orders carried out,  though. I lack imagination, and I never did try to read a man's mind.  What he says he'd better mean--when he says it to me.\"    Bart Nelson gave a short laugh, turned and sent his riders back to their  work with oaths tingling their ears. Bud judged that cursing was his  natural form of speech.    \"Go let up that steer, and I'll put you to work,\" he said to Bud  afterwards. \"That's a good rope horse you're riding. If you want to use  him, and if you can hold up to that little sample of roping yuh gave  us, I'll pay yuh sixty a month. And that's partly for doing what you're  told,\" he added with a quick look into Bud's eyes. \"You didn't say where  you're from----\"    \"I was born and raised in cow-country, and nobody's looking for me,\"  Bud informed him over his shoulder while he remounted, and let it go at  that. From southern Wyoming to Idaho was too far, he reasoned, to make  it worth while stating his exact place of residence. If they had never  heard of the Tomahawk outfit it would do no good to name it. If they had  heard of it, they would wonder why the son of so rich a cowman as Bob  Birnie should be hiring out as a common cowpuncher so far from home. He  had studied the matter on his way north, and had decided to let people  form their own conclusions. If he could not make good without the name  of Bob Birnie behind him, the sooner he found it out the better.    He untied the steer, drove it back into the herd and rode over to where  the high-nosed man was helping hold the \"Cut.\"    \"Can you read brands? We're cuttin' out AJ and AJBar stuff; left  ear-crop on the AJ, and undercut on the AJBar.\"    Bud nodded and eased into the herd, spied an AJ two-year-old and urged  it toward the outer edge, smiling to himself when he saw how Stopper  kept his nose close to the animal's rump. Once in the milling fringe of  the herd, Stopper nipped it into the open, rushed it to the cut herd,  wheeled and went back of his own accord. From the corner of his eye, as  he went, Bud saw that Bart Nelson and one or two others were watching  him. They continued to eye him covertly while he worked the herd with  two other men. He was glad that he had not travelled far that day,  and that he had ridden Smoky and left Stopper fresh and eager for his  favorite pastime, which was making cattle do what they particularly did  not want to do. In that he was adept, and it pleased Bud mightily to see  how much attention Stopper was attracting.    Not once did it occur to him that it might be himself who occupied the  thoughts of his boss. Buddy--afterwards Bud--had lived his whole life  among friends, his only enemies the Indians who preyed upon the cowmen.  White men he had never learned to distrust, and to be distrusted had  never been his portion. He had always been Bud Birnie, son and heir of  Bob Birnie, as clean-handed a cattle king as ever recorded a brand. Even  at the University his position had been accepted without question. That  the man he mentally called Parrotface was puzzled and even worried about  him was the last thing he would think of.    But it was true. Bart Nelson watched Bud, that afternoon. A man might  ride up to Bart and assert that he was an old hand with cattle, and Bart  would say nothing, but set him to work, as he had Bud. Then he would  know just how old a \"Hand\" the fellow was. Fifteen minutes convinced  him that Bud had \"growed up in the saddle\", as he would have put it. But  that only mystified him the more. Bart knew the range, and he knew every  man in the country, from Burroback Valley, which was this great valley's  name, to the Black Rim, beyond the mountain range, and beyond the Black  Rim to the Sawtooth country. He knew their ways and he knew their past  records.    He knew that this young fellow came from farther ranges, and he would  have been at a loss to explain just how he knew it. He would have said  that Bud did not have the \"earmarks\" of an Idaho rider. Furthermore, the  small Tomahawk brand on the left flank of the horse Bud rode was totally  unknown to Bart. Yet the horse did not bear the marks of long riding.  Bud himself looked as if he had just ridden out from some nearby  ranch--and he had refused to say where he was from.    Bart swore under his breath and beckoned to him a droopy-mustached,  droopy-shouldered rider who was circling the herd in a droopy,  spiritless manner and chewing tobacco with much industry.    \"Dirk, you know brands from the Panhandle to Cypress Hills. What d' yuh  make of that horse? Where does he come from?\" Bart stopped abruptly and  rode forward then to receive and drive farther back a galloping AJBar  cow which Bud and Stopper had just hazed out of the herd. Dirk squinted  at Stopper's brand which showed cleanly in the glossy, new hair of early  summer. He spat carefully with the wind and swung over to meet his boss  when the cow was safely in the cut herd.    \"New one on me, Bart. They's a hatchet brand over close to Jackson's  Hole, somewhere. Where'd the kid say he was from?\"    \"He wouldn't say, but he's a sure-enough cowhand.\"    \"That there horse ain't been rode down on no long journey,\" Dirk  volunteered after further scrutiny. And he added with the unconscious  impertinence of an old and trusted employee, \"Yuh goin' to put him on?\"    \"Already done it--sixty a month,\" Bart confided. \"That'll bring out  what's in him; he's liable to turn out good for the outfit. Showed he'll  do what he's told first, and think it over afterwards. I like that there  trait in a man.\"    Dirk pulled his droopy mustache away from his lips as if he wanted to  make sure that his smile would show; though it was not a pretty smile,  on account of his tobacco-stained teeth.    \"'S your fun'ral, Bart. I'd say he's from Jackson's Hole, on a rough  guess--but I wouldn't presume to guess what he's here fur. Mebby he come  across from Black Rim. I can find out, if you say so.\"    Bud was weaving in and out through the herd, scanning the animals  closely. While the two talked he singled out a yearling heifer, let  Stopper nose it out beyond the bunch and drove it close to the boss.    \"Better look that one over,\" He called out. \"One way, it looks like AJ,  and another way I"]]]
