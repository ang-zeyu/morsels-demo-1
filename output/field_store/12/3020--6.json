CHAPTER IV    WANT OF SLEEP      So far, almost all that has been written--and there has been a great  deal of unavoidable repetition--has been devoted to an attempt to  determine the causes which lead the child to refuse food and the  methods which we adopt to prevent or overcome the difficulty. Other  neuroses may be studied in less detail, because they depend for their  existence upon the same causes. For example, the habit of refusing  sleep, which is as common and almost as distressing as the habit of  refusing food, depends both upon a perversion of suggestion and upon  the phenomenon that we have called negativism.    If struggling and crying has occurred upon a series of nights, the  child comes to associate his bed not with sleep but with tears. If a  mother values her peace of mind, if she would spare herself the  discomfort of hearing her child sob himself nightly into uneasy sleep,  she must be wary how this all-important event of going to bed is  approached. With a nervous and restless child the preliminaries of  preparing for bed must be managed carefully and tactfully. The hour  before bedtime is almost universally the most interesting of the  whole day for the child. Then the baby, with his best frock on, and  books and toys, is the centre of interest in the drawing-room, till  the clock strikes and the nurse appears at the door. Suddenly it is  all over, and inexorable routine sends him off to bed. The good nurse  will give the child a little time to recover from the shock of her  arrival, and will not hurry him. She knows that his little mind is  slow to act, and that he must be led gradually to face a new prospect.  If she hurries him, catching him up in her arms from the midst of his  unfinished pursuits, resistance and tears are almost sure to follow,  and the difficult task of the day--the putting to bed--has made the  worst possible start. When this has happened on one or two successive  evenings, the habit of resistance to going to bed becomes fixed, and,  like all bad habits, is difficult to break. A nurse who has a way with  children will arouse his interest in a new pursuit, in which he can  play the chief part, the putting away of his picture books and toys.  If he is too small to carry his own chair or table to its allotted  place in the room, at least he can show his learning by pointing out  the spot. In the waving of good-byes he is expert and takes a  legitimate pride, and upstairs he has learnt that there are new  delights. He himself can turn on the taps in the bathroom, and he can  set every article in the proper place ready for use. All children love  their bath, and if interest and good temper has been so far preserved,  without a break, it will be ill-fortune if even the drying process is  not carried off without a hitch. Afterwards, for a little, nervous  babies, whose brains still teem with all the excitements of the day,  are best left to sit for a few moments by the nursery fire, while the  nurse puts all the garments one by one to bed. Each as it goes to rest  will be greeted by him with cheerful farewells; and so does the force  of suggestion act, till the central figure himself plays his part in  the scene, of which he feels himself the controller and director, and  climbs to bed. But if there has been a hitch anywhere, if the bugbear  of negativism has appeared, if he has been scolded or coaxed or  repressed too much and there have been tears and struggles, then going  to bed is a poor preparation for instant and quiet sleep.    With excitable, highly-strung children, the best laid plans and the  most tactful nurse will not always succeed, and to place him in his  cot is to provoke a storm of angry refusal and resistance. There are  mothers who believe that the best way is then to turn out the light  and leave the child to cry himself to sleep. This is a point on which  no one can lay down rules which are applicable for all children. It  may sometimes succeed, and the child may reason correctly and in the  way we wish him to reason, deciding that the game is not worth the  candle and so give it up. But with nervous, highly-strung children I  doubt if this Spartan conduct is commonly successful. Often if the  attempt is made, the troubled mother, listening to all these  heart-breaking sobs, can bear it no longer, and goes back to the side  of the cot to soothe and persuade him. Then certainly the longer she  has restrained her natural inclination, the longer the child has  sobbed himself into a pitiful little ball of perspiration and tears,  the more difficult will be her task in quieting him, the stronger will  be the impression formed on the child's mind, and the greater will be  the suggestion which will act under the same circumstances to-morrow.  Children who fall a prey to this uncontrolled crying, cry on because  they cannot stop when they have begun. They do not then cry purposely  or with a fixed intention, desiring to attain some object. They cry  because their minds are not at rest, but are irritated and overwrought  by the happenings of the day. We decided that it was useless to  attempt by exhortations at meal-times to induce a nervous child to eat  who habitually refuses food, and that we can only cure the condition  by eliminating from his daily life the elements of repression and  opposition which provoke the counter-opposition. And we must seek the  same solution in this other difficulty of the refusal of sleep. It is  useless to attempt to treat the symptom of refusal of sleep and to  leave the cause of that symptom still constantly in action.    If, in spite of our care to avoid unrest and irritation of the child's  brain, sleep is refused, as may often happen, it is, as a rule, wise  to cut short the crying if we can, before a vicious circle has been  formed and the unrest has been intensified by the emotional storm. It  is useless with little children to urge them to go to sleep or to  coax. It is not usually wise to leave the child for a little and then  to return. Each time the child is left, each time the mother or nurse  returns, the crying bursts forth again with renewed force and vigour.  It is at least one good plan with a little child to turn the light  out, and, treating the whole incident in the most matter-of-fact way  possible, lightly to stroke his head or pat his back rhythmically  without speaking. With older children, if the crying is more  purposeful and less emotional, the mother may busy herself for a  little with some task in the room, ostentatiously neglecting the storm  and making no reference to it. If she speaks to the child at all she  should do so in a matter-of-fact way, referring lightly to other  matters. If only she can convince him that his conduct is a matter of  indifference to her, the victory is won. It is because the child knows  so well that his mother does care that he so often has the upper hand.  It is not difficult to distinguish between a true emotional storm and  the tyrannous cry of a wilful child who demands his own way.    Light and broken sleep is a common accompaniment of a too excitable  and overstimulated brain. The placid child, who eats well, plays  quietly, and does not cry more than is usual, as a rule sleeps so  soundly that no ordinary sounds, such as conversation carried on in  quiet tones in his neighbourhood, have the power to waken him. When he  wakes, he does so gradually, perhaps yawning and stretching himself.  The nervous child may move at the slightest sound, or with a sudden  start or cry is wide awake at once. A hard mattress should be chosen  without a bolster, and with only a low pillow. Flannel pyjamas, which  cannot be thrown off in the restless movements of the child, should be  worn. The temperature of the room should be cool, and the air from the  open window should circulate freely, while draughts may be kept from  striking on the child by a screen. All the sensations of the nervous  child are abnormally acute. Thus, for example, an itching eruption, or  tight clothing, will produce an altogether disproportionate reaction,  and may result in a frenzy of opposition. Especially such a child is  sensitive to a stuffy atmosphere or to an excess of bedclothes. Cool  rooms and warm but light and porous clothing are essential. An  electric torch, which can be flashed on the child for an instant, will  assist the mother or nurse to make sure that the child has not thrown  off all the bedclothing.    Sometimes want of sleep is accounted for by a real want of physical  exercise. Town children especially are apt to suffer from their  limited opportunities of running freely in the open. It is often  considered enough that the child seated in his perambulator should  take the air for three or four hours daily, while much of his time  indoors as well is devoted to sitting. It is necessary for his proper  development that he should have opportunities of daily exercise in the  open. If for any reason this is not always practicable, a large room,  as free as possible from furniture, should be chosen, with windows  thrown wide open, in which the child may romp until he is tired.    It is rare for children of two or of three years of age, whose case  we are now considering, to be troubled by bad dreams, nightmares, or  night-terrors. If these should occur, obstructed breathing due to  adenoid vegetations is sometimes at work as a contributory cause.    Finally, we should always remember that refusal of sleep is, for the  most part, caused and kept up by harmful suggestions derived from  mother and nurse, who allow the child to perceive their distress and  agitation, who speak before the child of his habitual wakefulness, who  unwittingly focus his attention on the difficulty. It is cured in the  moment that the suggestion in the child's mind is reversed, in the  moment when he comes to regard it as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1452"],[0,"Native Life in South Africa (#11)"],[1,"were asked  to pass legislation in that matter.  ==    The Bill was contested at every stage and numerous divisions were challenged.

The division lists ranged  from 17 against 71 to 32 against 60, the majority in each case  being in favour of repression.  It would be just as well  to give at least one of these division lists.

Chapter III     The Natives' Land Act      I blush to think that His Majesty's representative signed a law like this,      and signed it in such circumstances.                                         Rev. Amos Burnet                                         (Chairman and General Superintendent of                                         the Transvaal and Swazieland District,                                         Wesleyan Methodist Church).        Up to now we have dealt with the history of the Land Act  from its commencement, and all the speeches and official documents  we have mentioned hitherto say nothing about restricting Europeans  in their ownership of land.  And no matter what other principles  one might read into the Act, it would be found that the principles  underlying it were those of extending the \"Free\" State land laws  throughout the Union -- an extension by which Natives would be prohibited  from investing their earnings in land whereon they could end their days  in peace.    There seems to be good reason for believing that the Government were advised,  by the legal advisers of the Crown, that the Natives' Land Bill  would be class legislation of a kind that would never be allowed  by His Majesty's Government.  The originators of the Bill, however,  were determined so to circumvent the constitutional quibble  raised by the legal advisers as to seal our doom; and by adroitly manipulating  its legal phrases, it seems that it was recasted in such a manner  as to give it a semblance of a paper restriction on European encroachment  on native rights.  But class legislation the Act is, for whereas  in his travels about South Africa, since the passing of this Act,  the author has met many a native family with their stock,  turned out by the Act upon the roads, he never met one white man so hounded  by the same Act, and debarred from living where he pleased.    The squatters form a particular section of the community specifically affected  by the Land Act; and there is no such person in South Africa  as a white squatter.  Although it is insistently affirmed that the law applies  both to Europeans and Natives, the conclusion cannot be avoided that  it is directed exclusively against the Native.  This is the naked truth that  turns all other explanations of the fact into mere shuffling and juggling.  And the reader will find that in Section 11, at the end of the statute  which is here reproduced (whether the omission of Europeans  was a mistake of the Parliamentary draftsmen, or the printers, we know not),  it is expressly stated that \"this Act may be cited for all purposes  as the NATIVES' Land Act, 1913.\"  Who, then, will continue to argue  that it was intended for Europeans as well?    ==  No. 27, 1913.]                                          ACT                                        TO  Make further provision as to the purchase and leasing of Land    by Natives and other Persons in the several parts of the Union and for    other purposes in connection with the ownership and occupation of Land    by Natives and other Persons.    Be it enacted by the King's Most Excellent Majesty,  the Senate and the House of Assembly of the Union of South Africa,  as follows: --    1. (1)  From and after the commencement of this Act,  land outside the scheduled native areas shall, until Parliament,  acting upon the report of the commission appointed under this Act,  shall have made other provision, be subjected to the following provisions,  that is to say: --    Except with the approval of the Governor-General --         (a) a native shall not enter into any agreement or transaction           for the purchase, hire, or other acquisition from a person           other than a native, of any such land or of any right thereto,           interest therein, or servitude thereover; and         (b) a person other than a native shall not enter into           any agreement or transaction for the purchase, hire,           or other acquisition from a native of any such land           or of any right thereto, interest therein, or servitude thereover.       (2)  From and after the commencement of this Act, no person other than  a native shall purchase, hire or in any other manner whatever acquire any land  in a scheduled native area or enter into any agreement or transaction for  the purchase, hire or other acquisition, direct or indirect, of any such land  or of any right thereto or interest therein or servitude thereover,  except with the approval of the Governor-General.       (3)  A statement showing the number of approvals granted  by the Governor-General under sub-sections (1) and (2) of this section  and giving the names and addresses of the persons to whom  such approvals were granted, the reasons for granting the same,  and the situation of the lands in respect of which they were granted,  shall, within six weeks after the commencement of each ordinary session  of Parliament, be laid upon the Tables of both Houses of Parliament.       (4)  Every agreement or any other transaction whatever entered into  in contravention of this section shall be null and void ab initio.    2. (1)  As soon as may be after the commencement of this Act  the Governor-General shall appoint a commission whose functions shall be  to inquire and report --         (a) what areas should be set apart as areas within which natives           shall not be permitted to acquire or hire land or interests in land;         (b) what areas should be set apart as areas within which           persons other than natives shall not be permitted to acquire or hire           land or interests in land.    The commission shall submit with any such report --         (i) descriptions of the boundaries of any area which it proposes           should be so set apart; and         (ii) a map or maps showing every such area.       (2)  The commission shall proceed with and complete its inquiry  and present its reports and recommendations to the Minister  within two years after the commencement of this Act, and may present  INTERIM reports and recommendations:  Provided that Parliament  may by resolution extend (if necessary) the time for the completion  of the commission's inquiry.  All such reports and recommendations  shall be laid by the Minister, as soon as possible after the receipt thereof,  upon the Tables of both Houses of Parliament.    3. (1)  The commission shall consist of not less than five persons,  and if any member of the commission die or resign or, owing to  absence or any other reason, is unable to act, his place shall be filled  by the Governor-General.
