[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15299"],[0,"Drake, Nelson and Napoleon (#11)"],[1," founded, and  others that it was not so bad as it was made out to be. Lady Hamilton  asserted that the stories were all falsehoods invented by the  Jacobinical party, but her Ladyship's veracity was never to be relied  upon. Perhaps a foundation of truth and a large amount of exaggeration  sums up the reports, so we must let it go at that. Troubridge seems to  have been convinced that his Admiral was in the midst of a fast set,  for he sends a most imploring remonstrance to him to get out of it and  have no more incense puffed in his face. This was fine advice, but the  victor of the Nile made no response.      IV    Nelson was little known to his countrymen before the St. Vincent  battle. But after the victory of the Nile his name became immortal,  and he could take any liberty he liked with our national  conventionalisms. Even his love affairs were regarded as heroics. He  refused occasionally to carry out instructions when he thought his own  plans were better, and it was winked at; but had any of them  miscarried, the memory of St. Vincent and the Nile would not have  lived long.    When he arrived with the Hamiltons in London after his long absence  and victorious record, the mob, as usual, took the horses from the  carriage and dragged him along Cheapside amid tumultuous cheers.  Whenever he appeared in public the same thing happened. At Court,  things were different. His reception was offensively cold, and George  III ran some risk when he affronted his most popular subject by  turning his back on him. Whatever private indiscretions Nelson may  have been guilty of, nothing could justify so ungrateful an act of  ill-mannered snobbery. The King should have known how to distinguish  between private weakness, however unconventional, and matchless public  service. But for the fine genius and patriotism of this noble fellow,  he might have lost his crown. The temper of a capricious public in an  era of revolution should not be tested by freaks of royal  self-righteousness, while its imagination is being stirred by the  deeds of a national hero. His action might have brought the dignity of  George's kingliness into the gutter of ridicule, which would have been  a public misfortune.    The King's treatment of Nelson was worse than tactless; it was an  impertinence. King Edward VII, whose wisdom and tact could always be  trusted, might have disapproved, as strongly as did George III,  Nelson's disregard of social conventions, but he would have received  him on grounds of high public service, and have let his private  faults, if he knew of them, pass unnoticed, instead of giving him an  inarticulate snub. Still, a genius of naval distinction, or any other,  has no right to claim exemption from a law that governs a large  section of society, or to suppose that he may not be criticized or  even ostracized if he defiantly offends the susceptibilities of our  moral national life. And it is rather a big tax on one's patience for  a man, because of his exalted position and distinguished deeds of  valour and high services rendered to the State, to expect that he may  be granted licence to parade his gallantries with women in boastful  indifference to the moral law that governs the lives of a large  section of the community. There are undoubtedly cases of ill-assorted  unions, but it does not lie within our province to judge such cases.  They may be victims of a hard fate far beyond the knowledge of the  serene critics, whose habit of life is to sneak into the sacred  affairs of others, while their own may be in need of vigilant enquiry  and adjustment.    It would hardly be possible, with the facts before us, to say a word  in mitigation of Nelson's ostentatious infatuation for Lady Hamilton,  were it not that he can never be judged from the same standpoint as  ordinary mortals. That is not to say that a man, mentally constituted  as he was, should not be amenable to established social laws.    Nelson was a compound of peculiarities, like most men who are put into  the world to do something great. He was amusingly vain, while his  dainty vanity so obscured his judgment that he could not see through  the most fulsome flattery, especially that of women. At the same time  he was professionally keen, with a clear-seeing intellect, dashing,  flawless courage, and a mind that quickly grasped the weak points of  the enemy's position or formation. He fought the old form of sea  warfare by methods that were exclusively his, and sent his opponents  staggering into confusion. Once a plan of battle had been arranged, he  never faltered in his judgment, and only manoeuvred as circumstances  arose, but always with that unexpected rush and resource which carried  with it certain victory.    Nelson's great talents and his victories caused society outwardly to  overlook his connection with the notorious Lady Hamilton. But the  gossips were always at work. On this point he does not seem to have  realized that he was playing pranks with society, though there were  abundant evidences of it. He was offended because at Dresden, on their  way to England, the Electress refused to receive his mistress on  account of her antecedents, and no Court was held during their stay.  Of course Emma was given the cold shoulder in England by the Court and  by society. Nelson told his friend Collingwood of his own treatment,  and added that, either as a public or private man, he wished nothing  undone which he had done. He told Collingwood of his cold reception by  the King, but it seems quite obvious that he maintained his belief  that his connection with Emma had no right to be questioned by His  Majesty or any of his subjects, and he held this view to the last. He  would have none of the moralists' cant lavished on him, and by his  consistent attitude seemed to say, \"Hands off my private life! If I  _did_ introduce Lady Hamilton to my wife at her apartments on my  arrival in England after two and a half years' absence, when she was  on the point of becoming the mother of Horatia, what business is that  of yours? I will have none of your abstract morality. Get away, and  clean up your own morals before you talk to me of mine.\" The above is  what I think a man of Nelson's temperament might say to the people who  wished to warn him against the dangerous course he was pursuing. Lady  Nelson does not seem to have been a woman who could appeal to a man  like Nelson. The fact is she may have been one of those unamiable,  sexless females who was either coldly ignoring her husband or storing  up in her heart any excuse for hurling at him the most bitter  invective with which she might humiliate him. She does not appear to  have been a vulgar shrieker, but she may have been a silent stabber,  which is worse. In any case, Nelson seems to have made a bad choice,  as by his actions he openly avowed that he preferred to live with the  former mistress of Featherstonehaugh, Greville, and Hamilton, rather  than with his lawful wife; and he, without a doubt, was the best judge  as to which of them suited him best. The truth remains that Emma was  attractive and talented, and although lowly born, she became the bosom  companion of kings, queens, princesses, princes, and of many men and  women of distinction.    Nelson must have been extraordinarily simple to imagine that his wife,  knowing, as all the world knew, that Lady Hamilton was his mistress  and a bold, unscrupulous rival, would receive her with rapturous  friendliness. The amazing puzzle to most people, then and now, is why  she received her at all, unless she wished to worm out of her the  precise nature of the intimacy. That may have been her definite  purpose in allowing the visits for two or three months; then one day  she flew into a rage, which conjures up a vision of hooks and eyes  bursting like crackers from her person, and after a theatrical display  of temper she disappears like a whirling tempest from the presence of  her faithless husband, never again to meet him. This manner of showing  resentment to the gallant sailor's fondness for the wife of Sir  William Hamilton was the last straw. There was nothing dignified in  Lady Nelson's tornado farewell to her husband; rather, if the records  may be relied on, it was accompanied by a flow of abuse which could  only emanate from an enraged termagant.    Nelson now had a free hand. His wife was to have a generous allowance  on condition that she left him alone freely to bestow his affections  on the seductive Emma, whose story, retold by Mr. Harrison, shows  Lady Nelson to have been an impossible woman to live with. She made  home hell to him, so he said. And making liberal allowance for Emma's  fibbing propensities, there are positive evidences that her story of  Nelson's home life was crammed with pathetic truths of domestic  misery. Nelson corroborates this by a letter to Emma almost  immediately after his wife's ludicrous exit. The letter is the  outpouring of an embittered soul that had been freed from purgatory  and was entering into a new joy. It is a sickening effusion of  unrestrained love-making that would put any personage of penny-novel  fame to the blush. I may as well give the full dose. Here it is:--        Now, my own dear wife: for such you are in the sight of Heaven,      I can give full scope to my feelings, for I dare say Oliver will      faithfully deliver this letter. You know, my dearest Emma, that      there is nothing in this world that I would not do for us to      live together, and to have our dear little child with us. I      firmly believe that this campaign will give us peace, and then      we will set off for Bronte. In twelve hours we shall be across      the water, and freed from all the nonsense of his friends, or      rather pretended ones. Nothing but an event happening to him      could prevent my going; and I am sure you will think so, for,      unless all matters accord, it would bring a hundred of tongues      and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15319"],[0,"The Government Class Book (#11)"],[1,"all  courts in which persons are tried in the county for crimes committed  therein, and conducts the prosecutions in the trial of the offenders. In  states where there is no attorney-general for the state, the prosecuting  attorney for each county serves in this capacity, in trials in which the  state is a party. As all crimes and breaches of the peace are considered  as committed against the state, and prosecuted in its name, this  attorney is sometimes called _state's attorney_.    Sec.11. In some states there is a _county-surveyor_, whose duties within  his county are similar in their nature to those of a state  surveyor-general.    Sec.12. County officers are generally elected by the people of the county.  Some of them are, in some of the states, appointed by some authority  prescribed by the constitution or laws of the state.          Chapter XV.    Towns and Town Officers. Powers and Duties of Town Officers.        Sec.1. The districts of territory into which counties are divided, are, in  some states, called _towns_. In others they are called, and perhaps more  properly, _townships_; and the name of _town_ is given to an  incorporated village, or a city. We shall, however, in this work, apply  to these territorial divisions the shorter name of _towns_, as they are  called in most of the old states.    Sec.2. The electors of the several towns meet once a year for the election  of town officers, and for certain other business purposes. The electors  of a town have power, at their annual town meetings, to order money to  be raised for the support of the poor, for the building and repairing of  bridges, and for other town purposes; to make regulations concerning  fences; to fix the compensation of town officers in certain cases; and  to perform such other duties as come within the usual powers of towns.  The powers of towns, however, are not precisely the same in all the  states.    Sec.3. Among the town officers elected at town meetings, are the following;  not all of them, however, are elected in any one state: One or more  persons who have the general oversight and direction of town affairs,  called by some name corresponding to the nature of their duties; a town  clerk; one or more assessors; justices of the peace; overseers of  highways; overseers of the poor; school officers; constables; a  collector of taxes; a treasurer; fence-viewers; pound-keepers, &c. In  some states there are also sealers of weights and measures; persons to  measure and inspect wood, lumber, bark, and other commodities.    Sec.4. The officers first mentioned in the preceding section, are, in the  New England states, called _selectmen_, of whom there are at least  three, and may in no state be more than nine, in each town. In a few  states they are called _trustees of townships_, and are three in number.  In a few other states, there is in each town one such officer, called  _supervisor_. The powers and duties of these officers are more numerous  in some states than in others. They have power to lay out roads, and lay  out and alter road districts; to do certain acts relating to roads,  bridges, taxes, common schools, the support of the poor, &c.; and to  examine and settle all demands against the town. In some of the states,  some of these duties are performed by other officers.    Sec.5. The _town-clerk_ keeps the records, books, and papers of the town.  He records in a book the proceedings of town meetings, the names of the  persons elected, and such other papers as are required by law to be  recorded. In some states, deeds and other conveyances are required to be  recorded by the clerks of towns.    [For a description of the duties of _assessors_ and _justices of the  peace_, see Assessment and Collection of Taxes, and Justices' Courts.]    Sec.6. For the repairing of _highways_, a town is divided by the proper  officers into as many road districts as may be judged convenient; and a  person residing in each district is chosen, called _overseer_ or  _supervisor_, or _surveyor_ of _highways_, whose duty it is to see that  the roads are repaired and kept in order in his district. In some states  a tax is laid and collected for this purpose; and each person assessed  may perform labor or furnish materials to the amount of his tax. In  other states, road taxes are assessed upon the citizens in days' labor,  according to the value of their property; every man, however, being  first assessed one day for his head, which is called a _poll-tax_.  Persons not wishing to labor, may pay an equivalent in money, which is  called _commuting_.    Sec.7. _Overseers of the poor_ provide for the support of the poor  belonging to the town who need relief, and have no near relations who  are able to support them. In some states there is in each county a  poor-house, to which the poor of the several towns are sent to be  provided for; the expense to be charged to the towns to which such poor  persons belonged.    Sec.8. The principal duties of a _constable_ are, to serve all processes  issued by justices of the peace in suits at law for collecting debts,  and for arresting persons charged with crimes. The business of a  constable in executing the orders of a justice of the peace, is similar  to that of a sheriff in relation to the county courts.    Sec.9. The town _treasurer_ receives all moneys belonging to the town, and  pays them out as they may be wanted for town-purposes; and accounts  yearly to the proper officers. The office of town treasurer does not  exist in all the states.    Sec.10. The duties of _fence-viewers_ relate chiefly to the settling of  disputes between the owners of adjoining lands concerning division  fences, the examining or viewing of fences when damage has been done by  trespassing animals; and the estimating of damages in such cases.    Sec.11. The town _sealer_ keeps correct copies of the standard of weights  and measures established by the state. Standard copies are furnished by  the state sealer to each county sealer, at the expense of the county,  and the county sealer furnishes each town sealer a copy at the expense  of the town. The town sealer compares the weights and measures brought  to him with the copy in his possession, and sees that they are made to  agree with it, and seals and marks them. A person selling by a weight or  measure that does not agree with the standard, is liable to the  purchaser for damages--generally to several times the amount of the  injury.    For a particular description of the duties of town officers, reference  must be had to the laws of the several states.          Chapter XVI.    Incorporation and Government of Cities, Villages, &c.        Sec.1. Cities and incorporated villages have governments peculiar to  themselves. Places containing a large and close population need a  different government from that of ordinary towns or townships. Many of  the laws regulating the affairs of towns thinly inhabited, are not  suited to a place where many thousand persons are closely settled.  Besides, the electors in such a place would be too numerous to meet in a  single assembly for the election of officers or the transaction of other  public business.    Sec.2. Whenever, therefore, the inhabitants of any place become so numerous  as to require a city government, they petition the legislature for a law  incorporating them into a city. The law or act of incorporation is  usually called a _charter_. The word _charter_ is from the Latin  _charta_, which means paper. The instruments of writing by which kings  or other sovereign powers granted rights and privileges to individuals  or corporations, were written on paper or parchment, and called  _charters_. In this country, it is commonly used to designate an act of  the legislature conferring privileges and powers upon cities, villages,  and other corporations.    Sec.3. The chief executive officer of a city is a _mayor_. A city is  divided into wards of convenient size, in each of which are chosen one  or more _aldermen_, (usually two,) and such other officers as are named  in the charter. The mayor and aldermen constitute the _common council_,  which is a kind of legislature, having the power to pass such laws,  (commonly called _ordinances_,) and to make such orders and regulations,  as the government of the city requires. The mayor presides in meetings  of the common council, and performs also certain judicial and other  duties. There are also elected in the several wards, assessors,  constables, collectors, and other necessary officers, whose duties in  their respective wards are similar to those of like named officers in  country towns, or townships.    Sec.4. The inhabitants of cities, however, are not wholly governed by laws  made by the common council. Most of the laws enacted by the legislature  are of general application, and have the same effect in cities as  elsewhere. Thus the laws of the state require, that taxes shall be  assessed and levied upon the property of the citizens of the state to  defray the public expenses; and the people of the cities are required to  pay their just proportion of the same; but the city authorities lay and  collect additional taxes for city purposes.    Sec.5. In cities there are also courts of justice other than those which  are established by the constitution or general laws of the state. There  is a court for the trial of persons guilty of disturbing the peace, and  of such other minor offenses as are usually punishable by imprisonment  in the county jail, called _police court_. It is held by a _police  justice_, elected by the people, or appointed in such manner as the law  prescribes. In some of the larger cities, there are courts of _civil_ as  well as criminal jurisdiction, differing from those which are common to  counties generally.    Sec.6. The government of incorporated _villages_ is not in all respects  like that of cities. The chief executive officer of such a village is,  in some"]]]
