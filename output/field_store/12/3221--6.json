After this she looked through the hole she  had made, which was large enough to admit her entire body, with such  threatening gestures, that the miserable fools who were teasing the dog  concluded that it would not pay very well to continue the sport.    At an exhibition of a menagerie in one of our principal cities, not long  since, when the crowd of spectators was the greatest, a little girl, who  had fed the elephant with sundry cakes and apples from her bag, drew out  her ivory card-case, which fell unobserved in the saw-dust of the ring.  At the close of the ring performances, the crowd opened to let the  elephant pass to his recess; but instead of proceeding as usual, he  turned aside and thrust his trunk in the midst of a group of ladies and  gentlemen, who, as might be expected, were so much alarmed that they  scattered in every direction. The keeper, at this moment, discovered  that the animal had something in his trunk. Upon examination, he found  it to be the young lady's card-case, which the elephant picked up, and  it now appeared that he was only seeking out the owner.    A person in the island of Ceylon, who lived near a place where elephants  were daily led to water, and often sat at the door of his house, used  occasionally to give one of these animals some fig leaves, a kind of  food which elephants are said to be very fond of. One day this man took  it into his head to play one of the elephants a trick. He wrapped up a  stone in fig leaves, and said to the man who had the elephants in  charge, \"This time I am going to give him a stone to eat; I want to see  how it will agree with him.\" The keeper replied, that the elephant would  not be such a fool as to swallow the stone--he might make up his mind to  that. The other, however, reached out the stone to the elephant, who  took it in his trunk, but instantly let it fall to the ground. \"You  see,\" said the keeper, \"that I was right, and that the beast is not so  great a fool as you took him to be;\" and drove away his elephants. After  they were watered, he was conducting them again to their stable. The man  who had played the elephant the trick was still sitting at his door,  when, before he had time to think of his danger, the insulted animal ran  at him, threw his trunk around his body, dashed him to the ground, and  trampled him to death.    At the Cape of Good Hope, it is customary to hunt these animals for the  sake of the ivory they obtain from them. Three horsemen armed with  lances, attack the beast alternately, each relieving the other as they  see their companion pressed, and likely to get the worst of the contest.  On one occasion three Dutchmen, who were brothers, having made large  fortunes at the cape by elephant hunting, were about to return home to  enjoy the fruits of their toil. They determined, however, the day before  they started, to have one more hunt by way of amusement. They went out  into the field, and soon met with an elephant, whom they began to attack  in their usual manner. But unfortunately, the horse of the man who was  fighting with the elephant at the time fell, and the rider was thrown to  the ground. Then the elephant had his vengeance, and it was a terrible  one--almost too terrible to think upon. He instantly seized the unhappy  man with his trunk, threw him up into the air to a vast height, and  received him upon his tusks as he fell. Then, turning toward the other  two brothers with an aspect of revenge and insult, he held out to them  the mangled body of his victim, writhing in the agony of death.    At Macassar an elephant driver one day had a cocoanut given him, which,  in order to break it, he struck two or three times against the  elephant's head. The next day the animal saw some cocoanuts exposed in  the street for sale, and taking one of them up in his trunk, beat it  about the driver's head until he fractured his skull.    Mr. Colton, the author of that admirable book called \"Lacon,\" tells a  similar anecdote of an elephant in Madras. It was a war elephant, and  was trained to perform an act of civility called the _grand salam_,  which is done by falling on the first joint of the fore-leg at a given  signal. The elephant was to make the salam before a British officer. It  was noticed at the time that he was rather out of humor. The keeper was  ordered up to explain the cause, and was in the act of doing so, when  the elephant advanced a few steps, and with one stroke of his trunk laid  the poor man dead at his feet. He then retired to his former position,  and made the grand salam with the utmost propriety and apparent good  will. The wife of the unfortunate man said that she had always been  afraid something of that kind would happen, as her husband had been  constantly in the habit of robbing the elephant of his rations of rice.    It is said that when once wild elephants have been caught, and eluded  the snares of their adversaries, if they are compelled to go into the  woods they are mistrustful, and break with their trunk a large branch,  with which they sound the ground before they put their foot upon it, to  discover if there are any holes on their passage, not to be caught a  second time. \"We saw two wild elephants,\" says a traveler, \"which had  just been caught; each of them was between two tame elephant; and around  the wild elephants were six men, holding spears. They spoke to these  animals in presenting them something to eat, and telling them, in their  language, _take this and eat it_. They had small bundles of hay, bits of  black sugar, or rice boiled in water with pepper. When the wild elephant  refused to do what he was ordered, the men commanded the tame elephants  to beat him, which they did immediately, one striking his forehead with  his; and when he seemed to aim at revenge against his aggressor, another  struck him; so that the poor wild elephant perceived he had nothing to  do but to obey.\"    A sentinel belonging to the menagerie at Paris, was in the habit of  telling the spectators not to give any food to the elephant during the  exhibition. One day, after a piece of bread had been presented to the  animal, the sentinel had commenced making the usual request, when the  elephant violently discharged in his face a stream of water, so that he  could not utter the admonition in his confusion. Of course the  spectators roared with laughter, and the elephant seemed to enjoy the  joke as well as they. By and by, the sentinel having wiped his face,  found himself under the necessity of repeating the request which he had  made before. But no sooner had he done this, than the elephant laid hold  of his musket with her trunk, wrested it from his hands, twirled it  round and round, trod it under her feet, and did not restore it until  she had twisted it nearly into the form of a cork-screw.    Elephants are occasionally taught to work on a farm, like horses and  oxen. Any one visiting Singapore, may see a small elephant, named Rajah,  working daily on the estate of J. Balestier, Esq., American Consul; and,  although the animal is only five years and a half old, he will plough  his acre of land a day, with ease. One man holds the plough, and another  walks beside the animal, and directs him in his duty. The docile little  creature obeys every word that is said to him, and will plough all day  between the cane rows, without plucking a single cane.    An elephant was once wounded in battle, and rendered so furious by the  pain she endured, that she ran about the field, uttering the most  hideous cries. One of the men was unable, in consequence of his wounds,  to get out of her way. The elephant seemed conscious of his situation,  and for fear she should trample upon him, took him up with her trunk,  placed him where he would be more safe, and continued her route.    A young elephant received a violent wound in its head, from which it  became so furious that it was utterly impossible to come near it to  dress the wound. A variety of expedients were tried, but in vain, until  at last the keeper hit upon this plan: he succeeded in making the mother  understand, by signs, what he wanted, and she immediately seized the  young one around the neck with her trunk, and held it firmly down,  though groaning with anguish, until the wound was dressed. This she  continued to do every day, for some time afterward, until the service  was no longer necessary.    Elephants are said to be exceedingly susceptible of the power of music,  and some curious experiments were tried at Paris, with a view of  observing the effect of it upon them. In one instance, a band was placed  near their den, while some food was given to a pair of elephants, to  engage their attention. On the commencement of the music, the huge  creatures turned round, and appeared alarmed for their safety, either  from the players or the spectators. The music, however, soon overcame  their fears, and all other emotions appeared absorbed in their attention  to it. According to the character of the music, so were their feelings.  If it was bold, they were excited, or manifested signs of approaching  anger. If it was brisk, they were lively; if it was plaintive, they were  soothed by its effects. The female seemed to express the most lively  emotions of the two.    A merchant in the East Indies kept a tame elephant, which was so  exceedingly gentle in his habits, that he was permitted to go at large.  This huge animal used to walk about the streets in the most quiet and  orderly manner, and paid many visits through the city to people who were  kind to him. Two cobblers took an ill will to this inoffensive creature,  and several"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18779"],[0,"Physiology and Hygiene for Secondary Schools (#11)"],[1,"  Tea and coffee contain a drug, called caffeine, which acts upon the  nervous system and which may, on this account, interfere with the proper  control of the heart. In some individuals the taking of a very small  amount of either tea or coffee is sufficient to cause irregularities in  the action of the heart. Tea is considered the milder of the two liquids  and the one less liable to injure.    *Effect of Rheumatism.*--The disease which affects the heart more  frequently than any other is rheumatism. This attacks the lining membrane,  or endocardium, and causes, not infrequently, a shrinkage of the heart  valves. The heart is thus rendered defective and, to perform its function  in the body, must work harder than if it were in a normal condition.  Rheumatic attacks of the heart do most harm when they occur in early  life--the period when the valves are the most easily affected. Any tendency  toward rheumatism in children has, therefore, a serious significance and  should receive the attention of the physician. Any one having a defective  heart should avoid all forms of exercise that demand great exertion.    *Strengthening of the Blood Vessels.*--Disturbances of the circulation,  causing too much blood to be sent to certain parts of the body and an  insufficient amount to others, when resulting from slight causes, are  usually due to weakness of the walls of the blood vessels, particularly of  the muscular coat. Such weakness is frequently indicated by extreme  sensitiveness to heat or cold and by a tendency to \"catch cold.\" From a  health standpoint the preservation of the normal muscular \"tone\" of the  blood vessels is a problem of great importance. Though the muscles of the  blood vessels cannot be exercised in the same manner as the voluntary  muscles, they may be called actively into play through all the conditions  that induce changes in the blood supply to different parts of the body.  The usual forms of physical exercise necessitate such changes and  indirectly exercise the muscular coat. The exposure of the body to cold  for short intervals, because of the changes in the circulation which this  induces, also serves the same purpose. A cold bath taken with proper  precautions is beneficial to the circulation of many and so also is a  brisk walk on a frosty morning. Both indirectly exercise and strengthen  the muscular coat of the blood vessels. On the other hand, too much time  spent indoors, especially in overheated rooms, leads to a weakening of the  muscular coat and should be avoided.    *Checking of Flow of Blood from Wounds.*--The loss of any considerable  quantity of blood is such a serious matter that every one should know the  simpler methods of checking its flow from wounds. In small wounds the flow  is easily checked by binding cotton or linen fiber over the place. The  absorbent cotton, sold in small packages at drug stores, is excellent for  this purpose and should be kept in every home. A simple method of checking  \"nosebleed\" is that of drawing air through the bleeding nostril, while the  other nostril is compressed with the finger.(24) Another method is to  \"press with the finger (or insert a small roll of paper) under the lip  against the base of the nose.\" (25) Where the bleeding is persistent, the  nostril should be plugged with a small roll of clean cotton or paper. When  this is done, the plug should not be removed too soon because of the  likelihood of starting the flow afresh.    In dealing with large wounds the services of a physician are  indispensable. But in waiting for the physician to arrive temporary aid  must be rendered. The one who gives such aid should first decide whether  an artery or a vein has been injured. This is easily determined by the  nature of the blood stream, which is in jets, or spurts, from an artery,  but flows steadily from a vein. If an artery is injured, the limb should  be tightly bandaged on the side of the wound nearest the heart; if a vein,  on the side farthest from the heart. In addition to this, the edges of the  wound should be closed and covered with cotton fiber and the limb should  be placed on a support above the level of the rest of the body. A large  handkerchief makes a convenient bandage if properly applied. This should  be folded diagonally and a knot tied in the middle. Opposite ends are then  tied, making a loose-fitting loop around the limb. The knot is placed  directly over the blood vessel to be compressed and a short stick inserted  in the loop. The necessary pressure is then applied by twisting the  handkerchief with the stick. Time must not be lost, however, in the  preparation of a suitable bandage. The blood vessel should be compressed  with the fingers while the bandage is being prepared.    *Summary.*--The blood, to serve as a transporting agent, must be kept  continually moving through all parts of the body. The blood vessels hold  the blood, supply the channels and force necessary for its circulation,  and provide conditions which enable materials both to enter and to leave  the blood stream. The heart is the chief factor in propelling the blood,  although the muscles and the elastic tissue in the walls of the arteries  and the valves in the veins are necessary aids in the process. In the  capillaries the blood takes on and gives off materials, while the arteries  and veins serve chiefly as tubes for conveying the blood from one system  of capillaries to another.    *Exercises.*--1. Of what special value in the study of the body was the  discovery of the circulation of the blood?    2. State the necessity for a circulating liquid in the body.    3. Show by a drawing the general plan of the heart, locating and naming  the essential parts. Show also the connection of the large blood vessels  with the cavities of the heart.    4. Compare the purpose served by the chordae tendineae to that served by  doorstops (the strips against which the door strikes in closing).    5. Explain how the heart propels the blood. To what class of pumps does it  belong? What special work is performed by each of its divisions?    6. Define a valve. Of what use are the valves in the heart? In the veins?    7. By what means is pressure from contracting muscles in different parts  of the body made to assist in the circulation?    8. Of what advantage is the elasticity of the arteries?    9. How is blood forced from the capillaries back to the heart?    10. Why should there be a difference in structure between the two sides of  the heart?    11. Following Fig. 23, trace the blood through a complete circulation,  naming all the divisions of the system in the order of the flow of the  blood.    12. If the period of rest following the period of contraction of the heart  be as long as the period of contraction, how many hours is the heart able  to rest out of every twenty-four?    13. State the functions of the capillaries. Show how their structure  adapts them to their work.    14. What kind of physical exercise tends to strengthen the heart? What  forms of exercise tend to injure it? State the effects of alcohol and  tobacco on the heart.    15. How may rheumatism injure the heart?    16. Give directions for checking the flow of blood from small and from  large blood vessels.        PRACTICAL WORK      In showing the relations of the different parts of the heart, a large  dissectible model is of great service (Fig. 24). Indeed, where the time of  the class is limited, the practical work may be confined to the study of  the heart model, diagrams of the heart and the circulation, and a few  simple experiments. However, where the course is more extended, the  dissection of the heart of some animal as described below is strongly  advised.    *Observations on the Heart.*--Procure, by the assistance of a butcher, the  heart of a sheep, calf, or hog. To insure the specimen against mutilation,  the lungs and the diaphragm must be left attached to the heart. In  studying the different parts, good results will be obtained by observing  the following order:    1. Observe the connection of the heart to the lungs, diaphragm, and large  blood vessels. Inflate the lungs and observe the position of the heart  with reference to them.    2. Examine the sac surrounding the heart, called the _pericardium_. Pierce  its lower portion and collect the pericardial fluid. Increase the opening  thus made until it is large enough to slip the heart out through it. Then  slide back the pericardium until its connection with the large blood  vessels above the heart is found. Observe that a thin layer of it  continues down from this attachment, forming the outer covering of the  heart.    3. Trace out for a short distance and study the veins and arteries  connected with the heart. The arteries are to be distinguished by their  thick walls. The heart may now be severed from the lungs by cutting the  large blood vessels, care being taken to leave a considerable length of  each one attached to the heart.                                    [Fig. 24]                      Fig. 24--Model for demonstrating the heart.      4. Observe the outside of the heart. The thick, lower portion contains the  cavities called _ventricles_; the thin, upper, ear-shaped portions are the  _auricles_. The thicker and denser side lies toward the left of the  animal's body and is called the _left_ side of the heart; the other is the  _right_ side. Locate the right auricle and the right ventricle; the left  auricle and the left ventricle.    5. Lay the heart on the table with the front side up and the apex pointing  from the operator. This places the left side of the heart to his left and  the right side to his right. Notice the groove between the ventricles,  called the inter-ventricular groove. Make an incision half an inch to the  right of this groove and cut toward the base of the heart until the  pulmonary artery is laid open. Then, following within half an inch of the  groove, cut down and around the"]]]
