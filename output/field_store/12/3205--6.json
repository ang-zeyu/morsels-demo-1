Mix to a paste, spread on bread and heat  thoroughly in the oven.      ~SQUASH FLOWER OMELET~--Put to soak in cold water. Then boil about fifteen  minutes, strain in a colander and cut up, not too fine. Now a regular  omelet is made but fried in a little bit of olive oil instead of butter,  and just before it is turned over the flowers are spread on top. Brown  quick and turn out on a hot platter.      ~VEGETABLE ROAST~--Take cooked beans or peas, pass through a colander to  remove the skins, and mix with an equal quantity of finely chopped nut  meats. Season to taste. Put one-half the mixture into a buttered baking  dish, spread over it a dressing made as follows: Pour boiling water on  four slices of zweiback, cover, let stand for a few minutes, then break  them up with a fork and pour over one-half cup of sweet cream, season  with salt and sage. Cover the dressing with the remainder of the nut  mixture, pour over all one-half cup of cream, and bake for one and  one-half hours. Serve in slices with cranberry sauce.      ~WALNUT LOAF~--One pint of dry breadcrumbs, one and one-half cups of  chopped or ground nut meats, mix well with salt and sifted sage to suit  the taste, add two tablespoons of butter, one beaten egg and sufficient  boiling water to moisten. Form into a loaf and bake in a granite or  earthen dish in a modern hot oven.          GAME, GRAVY AND GARNISHES      ~ROASTED CANVAS-BACK DUCK~--Procure a fine canvas-back duck, pick,  singe, draw thoroughly and wipe; throw inside a light pinch of salt, run  in the head from the end of the head to the back, press and place in a  roasting pan. Sprinkle with salt, put in a brisk oven, and cook for  eighteen minutes. Arrange on a very hot dish, untruss, throw in two  tablespoons of white broth. Garnish with slices of fried hominy and  currant jelly. Redhead and mallard ducks are prepared the same way.      ~BROILED WILD DUCK~--Pick, singe and draw well a pair of wild ducks,  split them down the back without detaching, place them skin downwards on  a dish, season with salt and pepper and pour over two tablespoons of  oil. Boil the birds well in this marinade, place them on a broiler on a  brisk fire, broil for seven minutes on each side. Place them on a hot  dish and cover with maitre d'hotel butter, garnish with watercress, and  serve.      ~ROAST DUCK WITH ORANGE SAUCE~--Scrape a tablespoonful each of fat,  bacon, and raw onion and fry them together for five minutes. Add the  juice of an orange and a wine-glassful of port wine, the drippings from  the duck and seasoning of salt and pepper. Keep hot without boiling and  serve with roast duck.      ~CHICKEN GRAVY~--Put into a stockpot the bones and trimmings of a fowl  or chicken with a small quantity of stock and boil them. Add flour and  butter to thicken it, and then place the pot on the side of the stove  and let simmer. Stir well and after the gravy has simmered for some  minutes skim and strain it, and it will be ready to serve.      ~GRAVY FOR WILD FOWL~--Put into a small saucepan a blade of mace, piece  of lemon peel, two tablespoonfuls each of mushroom catsup, walnut catsup  and strained lemon juice; two shallots cut in slices, two wineglasses of  port wine. Put the pan over the fire and boil the contents; then strain,  add it to the gravy that has come from the wild fowl while roasting. If  there is a large quantity of gravy less wine and catsup will be  necessary.      ~SALMI OF GAME~--Cut cold roast partridges, grouse or quail into joints  and lay aside while preparing the gravy. This is made of the bones,  dressing, skin, and general odds and ends after the neatest pieces of  the birds have been selected. Put this (the scraps) into a saucepan,  with one small onion minced, and a bunch of sweet herbs, pour in a pint  of water and whatever gravy may be left, and stew, closely covered, for  nearly an hour. A few bits of pork should be added if there is no gravy.  Skim and strain, return to the fire, and add the juice of a half lemon,  with a pinch of nutmeg, thicken with browned flour if the stuffing has  not thickened it sufficiently, boil up and pour over the reserved meat,  which should be put into another saucepan. Warm until smoking hot, but  do not let it boil. Arrange the pieces of bird in heap upon a dish and  pour the gravy over them.          LENTEN DISHES      ~ORANGE FOOL~--Take the juice of six oranges, six eggs well beaten, a  pint of cream, quarter of a pound of sugar, little cinnamon and nutmeg.  Mix well together. Place over a slow fire and stir until thick, then add  a small lump of butter.      ~PLUM PORRIDGE~--Take a gallon of water, half a pound of barley, quarter  of a pound of raisins, and a quarter of a pound of currants. Boil until  half the water is wasted. Sweeten to taste and add half pint of white  wine.      ~RICE SOUP~--Boil two quarts of water and a pound of rice, with a little  cinnamon, until the rice is tender. Take out the cinnamon and sweeten  rice to taste. Grate half a nutmeg over it and let stand until it is  cold. Then beat up the yolks of three eggs, with half a pint of white  wine, mix well and stir into the rice. Set over a slow fire, stirring  constantly to prevent curdling. When it is of good thickness it is ready  to serve.      ~RICE MILK~--Boil half pound of rice in a quart of water, with a little  cinnamon. Let it boil until the water is wasted, taking great care it  does not burn. Then add three pints of milk and the yolk of an egg. Beat  up and sweeten to taste.      ~FORCED MEAT BALLS FOR TURTLE SOUP~--Cut off a very small part of the  vealy part of a turtle, mince it very fine and mix it with a very small  quantity of boned anchovy and boiled celery, the yolks of one or two  hard-boiled eggs, and two tablespoons of sifted breadcrumbs, with mace,  cayenne pepper and salt to taste, a small quantity of warm butter, and  well beaten egg. Form the paste into balls, plunge them into a  frying-pan of boiling butter or fat, fry them to a good color, and they  are ready. They should be added to the soup hot.      ~TRUFFLES FOR GARNISH~--Choose large round truffles, wash them  thoroughly and peel them, and put the required number into a saucepan,  pour over them enough chicken broth or champagne to nearly cover them,  add an onion stuck with three or four cloves, a clove of garlic, a bunch  of sweet herbs, and a little of the skimmings of the chicken broth or  fat. Place the pan on the fire and boil for fifteen minutes with the lid  on, then remove from the fire, and let the truffles cool in their  liquor. Remove them, drain, and they are ready for use. Another way to  fix them is to boil them ten minutes and cut them into various shapes.  The trimmings from them as well as the liquor may be used in making  sauce.      ~FRIED PARSLEY~--Carefully pick the stems from the parsley, dry it on a  cloth, put into a frying basket, then into hot fat. Be careful that the  fat is not too hot. Fry for a few minutes.      ~BEEF MARROW QUENELLES~--Put one-half pound beef marrow into a basin,  with an equal quantity of breadcrumbs, add two tablespoons of flour;  salt and pepper to taste. Work it into a smooth paste with the yolks of  six eggs and the whites of one. Take it out a little at a time and poach  in boiling salted water, drain, trim, and serve very hot.      ~CALF'S LIVER QUENELLES~--Steep a thick layer of bread in milk, until  well soaked, then squeeze and mix with half a pound of finely ground  calf's liver, and season with parsley, chives and lemon peel in small  quantities, and all finely ground. Dust in salt and pepper and a  tablespoonful of flour. Bind the mixture with beaten eggs. Divide the  mixture with a tablespoon into small quantities and shape each one like  an oval. Plunge the ovals into a saucepan of boiling water and boil for  a half an hour. Chop some bacon, place it in a frying-pan with a lump of  butter and fry until brown. When the quenelles are cooked pour the hot  bacon and fat over them, and serve.      ~CHICKEN QUENELLES~--Mix together one teacupful each of breadcrumbs and  finely pounded cooked chicken. Season highly with salt and cayenne and  bind with raw egg yolks. Mold into pieces about the size and shape of an  olive, between two spoons. Roll in egg and cracker dust and fry them, or  poach them in boiling broth or water until they float, and use them as  desired.          MISCELLANEOUS      ~BEAUREGARD EGGS~--Two level tablespoons butter, two level tablespoons  flour, one-half level teaspoon salt, one cup milk, four hard-boiled  eggs. Make a white sauce of the butter, flour, salt and milk, and add  the whites of the eggs chopped fine. Cut buttered toast in pointed  pieces and arrange on a hot plate to form daisy petals. Cover with the  sauce and put the egg yolks through a ricer into the center.      ~EGG AND POTATO SCALLOP~--Fill a buttered baking dish with alternate  layers of cold boiled potatoes sliced thin, hard-boiled eggs also  sliced, and a rich white sauce poured over each layer. Cover the top  with buttered crumbs and set in the oven until the crumbs are browned.      ~EGGS SCRAMBLED IN MILK~--Half pint of milk, five eggs. Heat the milk in  a saucepan and when it is just at the boiling point stir in the eggs,  which should have been beaten enough to mix them thoroughly. Stir  steadily until they thicken, add a half teaspoonful of salt and serve at  once.      ~EGG WITH WHITE SAUCE FOR LUNCHEON~--Cut stale bread into one-fourth  slices and shape into rounds, then saute in olive oil. Arrange on a hot  platter and on each place a French poached egg. Cover with Marnay sauce,  sprinkle with buttered breadcrumbs and put in oven just long enough to  brown crumbs. For the Marnay sauce, cook one and one-half cups of  chicken stock with one slice of onion, one slice carrot, bit of bay  leaf, a sprig of parsley and six peppercorns until reduced to one cup,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18440"],[0,"Logic: Deductive and Inductive (#11)"],[1,"into the corresponding general terms.    Sec. 4. If we ask how the connotation of a term is to be known, the answer  depends upon how it is used. If used scientifically, its connotation is  determined by, and is the same as, its definition; and the definition is  determined by examining the things to be denoted, as we shall see in  chap. xxii. If the same word is used as a term in different sciences, as  'property' in Law and in Logic, it will be differently defined by them,  and will have, in each use, a correspondingly different connotation. But  terms used in popular discourse should, as far as possible, have their  connotations determined by classical usage, i.e., by the sense in  which they are used by writers and speakers who are acknowledged masters  of the language, such as Dryden and Burke. In this case the classical  connotation determines the definition; so that to define terms thus used  is nothing else than to analyse their accepted meanings.    It must not, however, be supposed that in popular use the connotation  of any word is invariable. Logicians have attempted to classify  terms into Univocal (having only one meaning) and AEquivocal (or  ambiguous); and no doubt some words (like 'civil,' 'natural,' 'proud,'  'liberal,' 'humorous') are more manifestly liable to ambiguous use than  some others. But in truth all general terms are popularly and  classically used in somewhat different senses.    Figurative or tropical language chiefly consists in the transfer of  words to new senses, as by metaphor or metonymy. In the course of years,  too, words change their meanings; and before the time of Dryden our  whole vocabulary was much more fluid and adaptable than it has since  become. Such authors as Bacon, Milton, and Sir Thomas Browne often used  words derived from the Latin in some sense they originally had in Latin,  though in English they had acquired another meaning. Spenser and  Shakespeare, besides this practice, sometimes use words in a way that  can only be justified by their choosing to have it so; whilst their  contemporaries, Beaumont and Fletcher, write the perfect modern  language, as Dryden observed. Lapse of time, however, is not the chief  cause of variation in the sense of words. The matters which terms are  used to denote are often so complicated or so refined in the assemblage,  interfusion, or gradation of their qualities, that terms do not exist in  sufficient abundance and discriminativeness to denote the things and, at  the same time, to convey by connotation a determinate sense of their  agreements and differences. In discussing politics, religion, ethics,  aesthetics, this imperfection of language is continually felt; and the  only escape from it, short of coining new words, is to use such words as  we have, now in one sense, now in another somewhat different, and to  trust to the context, or to the resources of the literary art, in order  to convey the true meaning. Against this evil the having been born since  Dryden is no protection. It behoves us, then, to remember that terms are  not classifiable into Univocal and AEquivocal, but that all terms are  susceptible of being used aequivocally, and that honesty and lucidity  require us to try, as well as we can, to use each term univocally in the  same context.    The context of any proposition always proceeds upon some assumption or  understanding as to the scope of the discussion, which controls the  interpretation of every statement and of every word. This was called by  De Morgan the \"universe of discourse\": an older name for it, revived by  Dr. Venn, and surely a better one, is _suppositio_. If we are talking of  children, and 'play' is mentioned, the _suppositio_ limits the  suggestiveness of the word in one way; whilst if Monaco is the subject  of conversation, the same word 'play,' under the influence of a  different _suppositio_, excites altogether different ideas. Hence to  ignore the _suppositio_ is a great source of fallacies of equivocation.  'Man' is generally defined as a kind of animal; but 'animal' is often  used as opposed to and excluding man. 'Liberal' has one meaning under  the _suppositio_ of politics, another with regard to culture, and still  another as to the disposal of one's private means. Clearly, therefore,  the connotation of general terms is relative to the _suppositio_, or  \"universe of discourse.\"    Sec. 5. Relative and Absolute Terms.--Some words go in couples or groups:  like 'up-down,' 'former-latter,' 'father-mother-children,'  'hunter-prey,' 'cause-effect,' etc. These are called Relative Terms,  and their nature, as explained by Mill, is that the connotations of the  members of such a pair or group are derived from the same set of facts  (the _fundamentum relationis_). There cannot be an 'up' without a  'down,' a 'father' without a 'mother' and 'child'; there cannot be a  'hunter' without something hunted, nor 'prey' without a pursuer. What  makes a man a 'hunter' is his activities in pursuit; and what turns a  chamois into 'prey' is its interest in these activities. The meaning of  both terms, therefore, is derived from the same set of facts; neither  term can be explained without explaining the other, because the relation  between them is connoted by both; and neither can with propriety be used  without reference to the other, or to some equivalent, as 'game' for  'prey.'    In contrast with such Relative Terms, others have been called Absolute  or Non-relative. Whilst 'hunter' and 'prey' are relative, 'man' and  'chamois' have been considered absolute, as we may use them without  thinking of any special connection between their meanings. However, if  we believe in the unity of Nature and in the relativity of knowledge  (that is, that all knowledge depends upon comparison, or a perception of  the resemblances and differences of things), it follows that nothing can  be completely understood except through its agreements or contrasts with  everything else, and that all terms derive their connotation from the  same set of facts, namely, from general experience. Thus both man and  chamois are animals; this fact is an important part of the meaning of  both terms, and to that extent they are relative terms. 'Five yards' and  'five minutes' are very different notions, yet they are profoundly  related; for their very difference helps to make both notions distinct;  and their intimate connection is shown in this, that five yards are  traversed in a certain time, and that five minutes are measured by the  motion of an index over some fraction of a yard upon the dial.    The distinction, then, between relative and non-relative terms must  rest, not upon a fundamental difference between them (since, in fact,  all words are relative), but upon the way in which words are used. We  have seen that some words, such as 'up-down,' 'cause-effect,' can only  be used relatively; and these may, for distinction, be called  Correlatives. But other words, whose meanings are only partially  interdependent, may often be used without attending to their relativity,  and may then be considered as Absolute. We cannot say 'the hunter  returned empty handed,' without implying that 'the prey escaped'; but we  may say 'the man went supperless to bed,' without implying that 'the  chamois rejoiced upon the mountain.' Such words as 'man' and 'chamois'  may, then, in their use, be, as to one another, non-relative.    To illustrate further the relativity of terms, we may mention some of  the chief classes of them.    Numerical order: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.; 1st implies 2nd, and 2nd 1st;  and 3rd implies 1st and 2nd, but these do not imply 3rd; and so on.    Order in Time or Place: before-after; early-punctual-late;  right-middle-left; North-South, etc.    As to Extent, Volume, and Degree: greater-equal-less;  large-medium-small; whole and part.    Genus and Species are a peculiar case of whole and part (_cf._ chaps.  xxi.-ii.-iii.). Sometimes a term connotes all the attributes that  another does, and more besides, which, as distinguishing it, are called  differential. Thus 'man' connotes all that 'animal' does, and also (as  _differentiae_) the erect gait, articulate speech, and other attributes.  In such a case as this, where there are well-marked classes, the term  whose connotation is included in the others' is called a Genus of that  Species. We have a Genus, triangle; and a Species, isosceles, marked off  from all other triangles by the differential quality of having two equal  sides: again--Genus, book; Species, quarto; Difference, having each  sheet folded into four leaves.    There are other cases where these expressions 'genus' and 'species'  cannot be so applied without a departure from usage, as, e.g., if we  call snow a species of the genus 'white,' for 'white' is not a  recognised class. The connotation of white (i.e., whiteness) is,  however, part of the connotation of snow, just as the qualities of  'animal' are amongst those of 'man'; and for logical purposes it is  desirable to use 'genus and species' to express that relativity of  terms which consists in the connotation of one being part of the  connotation of the other.    Two or more terms whose connotations severally include that of another  term, whilst at the same time exceeding it, are (in relation to that  other term) called Co-ordinate. Thus in relation to 'white,' snow and  silver are co-ordinate; in relation to colour, yellow and red and blue  are co-ordinate. And when all the terms thus related stand for  recognised natural classes, the co-ordinate terms are called co-ordinate  species; thus man and chamois are (in Logic) co-ordinate species of the  genus animal.    Sec. 6. From such examples of terms whose connotations are related as whole  and part, it is easy to see the general truth of the doctrine that as  connotation decreases, denotation increases: for 'animal,' with less  connotation than man or chamois, denotes many more objects; 'w"]]]
