To  this group belonged the virginal, or virginals, the clavicembalo, the  harpsichord, or clavecin, and the spinet. Stops were added, as in the  organ, that varied effects might be produced, and a second keyboard was  often placed above the first. The case was either rectangular, or  followed the outlines of the harp, a progenitor of this clavier type. It  was often highly ornamented, and handsomely mounted. Each string from  the first had its due length and was tuned to its proper note.    The secular music principle of the sixteenth century that called into  active being the orchestra led also to a desire for richer musical  expression in home and social life than the fashionable lute afforded,  and the clavier advanced in favor. In France, by 1530, the dance, that  promoter of pure instrumental music, was freely transcribed for the  clavier. Little more than a century later, Jean Baptiste Lully  (1633-1687) extensively employed the instrument in the orchestration of  his operas, and wrote solo dances for it.    Francois Couperin (1668-1733), now well-nigh forgotten, although once  mentioned in the same breath with Moliere, wrote the pioneer clavier  instruction book. In it he directs scholars how to avoid a harsh tone,  and how to form a legato style. He advises parents to select teachers on  whom implicit reliance may be placed, and teachers to keep the claviers  of beginners under lock and key that there may be no practicing without  supervision. His suggestions deserve consideration to-day.    He was the first to encourage professional clavier-playing among women.  His daughter Marguerite was the first woman appointed official court  clavier player. He composed for the clavier little picture tunes,  designed to depict sentiments, moods, phases of character and scenes  from life. He fashioned many charming turns of expression, introduced  an occasional tempo rubato, foreshadowed the intellectual element in  music and laid the corner-stone of modern piano-playing. Jean Philippe  Rameau (1683-1764) continued Couperin's work.    What is generally recognized as the first period of clavier-virtuosity  begins with the Neapolitan Domenico Scarlatti (1683-1757), and Johann  Sebastian Bach (1685-1750), the German of Germans. The style of  Scarlatti is peculiarly the product of Italian love of beautiful tone,  and what he wrote, though without depth of motive, kept well in view the  technical possibilities of the harpsichord. His \"Cat's Fugue,\" and his  one movement sonatas still appear on concert programmes. In a collection  of thirty sonatas he explained his purpose in these words: \"Amateur, or  professor, whoever thou art, seek not in these compositions for any  profound feeling. They are only a frolic of art, meant to increase thy  confidence in the clavier.\"    In Germany, with grand old Father Bach, the keyboard instrument was  found capable of mirroring a mighty soul. The germ of all modern musical  design lies in his clavier writings. It has been aptly said of this  master of masters that he constructed a great university of music, from  which all must graduate who would accomplish anything of value in music.  Men of genius, from Mozart to the present time, have extolled him for  the beauty of his melodies and harmonies, the expressiveness of his  modulations, the wealth, spontaneity and logical clearness of his ideas,  and the superb architecture of his productions. Students miss the soul  of Bach because of the soulless, mechanical way in which they deface his  legacy to them.    His \"Twelve Little Preludes\" alone contain the materials for an entire  system of music. The \"Inventions,\" too often treated as dry-as-dust  studies, are laden with beautiful figures and devices that furnish  inspiration for all time. As indicated by their title, which signifies a  compound of appropriate expression and just disposition of the members,  they were designed to cultivate the elements of musical taste, as well  as freedom and equality of the fingers. His \"Well Tempered Clavichord\"  has been called the pianist's Sacred Book. Its Preludes and Fugues  illustrate every shade of human feeling, and were especially designed to  exemplify the mode of tuning known as equal temperament, introduced into  general use by Bach, and still employed by your piano tuner and mine.    Forkel, his biographer, has finely said that Bach considered the voices  of his fugues a select company of persons conversing together. Each was  allowed to speak only when there was something to say bearing on the  subject in hand. A highly characteristic motive, or theme, as  significant as the noblest \"typical phrase,\" developing into equally  characteristic progressions and cadences, is a striking feature of the  Bach fugue. His \"Suites\" exalted forever the familiar dance tunes of the  German people. His wonderful \"Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue\" ushered the  recitative into purely instrumental music.    As a teacher he was genial, kind, encouraging and in every respect a  model. He obliged his pupils to write and understand as well as sound  the notes. In his noble modesty he never held himself aloof as superior  to others. When pupils were discouraged he reminded them how hard he had  always been compelled to work, and assured them that equal industry  would lead them to success. He gave the thumb its proper place on the  keyboard, and materially improved fingering. Tranquillity and poetic  beauty being prime essentials of his playing, he preferred to the more  brilliant harpsichord, or spinet, the clavichord, whose thrilling,  tremulous tone, owing to its construction, was exceedingly sensitive to  the player's touch. The early hammer-clavier, or pianoforte, invented in  1711, by the Italian Cristofori, who derived the hammer idea from the  dulcimer, did not attract him because of its extreme crudeness.  Nevertheless, it was destined to develop into the musical instrument  essential to the perfect interpretation of his clavier music.    His son and pupil, Philipp Emanuel Bach (1714-1788), proceeding on the  principles established by his illustrious father, prepared the way for  the modern pianist. His important theoretical work, \"The True Art of  Clavier Playing,\" was pronounced by Haydn the school of schools for all  time. It was highly extolled by Mozart, and to it Clementi ascribed his  knowledge and skill. In his compositions he was an active agent in the  crystallization of the sonata form. From him Haydn gained much that he  later transferred to the orchestra.    Impulse to the second period of clavier virtuosity was given by Wolfgang  Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) and Muzio Clementi (1752-1832). Mozart, who  led the Viennese school, developed the singing style of playing and the  smooth flowing legato. Leaving behind him the triumphs of his  wonder-boyhood with spinet and harpsichord, he boldly entered the public  concert-hall with the pianoforte, now greatly advanced by the  improvements of Silbermann. Mozart brought into use its special  features, showed its capacity for tone-shading and for the reflection  of sentiment, and may well be said to have launched it on its career.  Tradition declares that his hand was fashioned for clavier keys, and  that its graceful movements afforded the eye no less pleasure than the  ear. His noble technique, based on his profound study of the Bachs, was  spiritualized by his own glowing fancy. In his playing, as in his  compositions, every note was a pearl of great price. With his piano  concertos he showed how clavier and orchestra may converse earnestly  together without either having its individuality marred. The same  equilibrium is maintained in his piano and violin sonatas and his other  concerted chamber music, amid all their persuasive and eloquent  discourse. His charming four-hand and double piano pieces, written for  himself and his gifted sister Marianne, and his solo clavier sonatas  would prove his wealth of musical invention had he not written another  note.    Clementi, born in Rome, passed most of his life in London, where he  attracted many pupils. Without great creative genius, he occupied  himself chiefly with the technical problems of the pianoforte. He opened  the way for the sonority of tone and imposing diction of the modern  style. His music abounded in bold, brilliant passages of single and  double notes. He is even credited with having trilled in octaves with  one hand. Taking upon himself the management of an English piano  factory, he extended the keyboard, in 1793, to five and a half octaves.  Seven octaves were not reached until 1851. His \"Gradus ad Parnassum\"  became the parent of Etude literature. Carl Tausig said: \"There is but  one god in technique, Bach, and Clementi is his prophet.\"    Losing the spirituality of a Mozart the Viennese school was destined to  degenerate into empty bravura playing. Before its downfall it produced a  Hummel, a Moscheles and a Czerny, each of whom left in their piano  studies a valuable bequest to technique. Karl Czerny (1791-1857), called  king of piano teachers, numbered among his pupils, Liszt, Doehler,  Thalberg and Jaell. The Clementi school was continued in that familiar  writer of Etudes, Johann Baptist Cramer (1771-1858), and began to show  respect for the damper pedal. Its most eminent virtuoso was John Field  (1782-1837) of Dublin.    Between these two schools stood Ludwig von Beethoven (1770-1827), a  giant on lofty heights. Every accent of his dramatic music was embodied  in his piano compositions. Tones furnished him unmistakably a language  that needed no commentary. \"In him,\" says Oscar Bie, \"there were no  tricks of technique to be admired, no mere virtuosity to praise; but he  stirred his hearers to the depths of their hearts. Amid his storm and  stress, whispering and listening, his awakening of the soul, an original  naturalism of piano-playing was recognized, side by side with the  naturalism of his creative art."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18285"],[0,"Tales from the Hindu Dramatists (#11)"],[1,"y, when he is deeply anxious for the money, the sage arrives.  Seeing the latter, he almost faints.    The sage whirls his eyes and asks, \"Oh Harischandra! where is my fee?  Pay at once, or I will burn you up.\" He replies in piteous and trembling  tones, \"The month will be completed by sunset. Please wait till sunset.\"    The sage observes, \"I will not listen to any more of your  prevarications. I cannot grant your request.\"    The king cries and repeatedly entreats the sage to wait till sunset.    At this the queen and his son both weep.    After many entreaties, the sage consents. Then the king again goes out  a-begging, but in vain. Then he resolves to sell his person and goes  about hawking himself in the streets.    No one responds to his efforts. No buyer appears. At this time, a  Brahmin with a disciple, asks whether a male or a female slave is for  sale and intimates that he requires a female slave.    The queen wipes her eyes and replies, \"Yes, a female slave is for sale  for fifty thousand gold coins. I, who am for sale as such, will obey all  orders except eating table-refuse and indulging in improper intimacy  with males.\" The Brahmin consents to the terms laid down, pays the  required sum into the hands of the king and takes away the queen. The  king then bewails her thus:--    \"It were far better if a thousand thunderbolts had fallen on my head. Oh  my dear queen! Never even in a dream did I think that such a misfortune  would befall you. You mistook a poisonous tree for a sandal-tree. Oh,  how hard is my heart! It does not melt at the sight of my wife sold away  as a slave. Even iron is melted by fire. Oh Providence! I can no longer  bear up my sorrows. Oh Indra I break my head in pieces by thy  thunderbolts.\"    At this lamentation of the king, all present become sorry and express  their regrets. After a little while, the sage arrives again, his body  emitting sparks of fire. Seeing him at a distance, the king begins to  tremble.    As the sage comes up, the king bows to him and says,    \"My lord Kausika! I have procured only a half of your fee by the sale of  my wife. Accept it. I shall presently pay the remaining half by the sale  of my own person.\"    The sage whirls his eyes and exclaims, \"Is it a joke? Am I a fit object  for a joke? What shall I do with only half the money? Just pay down the  whole amount. See the sun is setting.\"    The king replies, \"O God! if this does not satisfy you, I pray you wait  a little. If a Chandal is available, I will sell my person to him and  pay your fee.\" The sage remarks:--    \"Then I will stand here and wait. Collect the money without delay.\"    The king then hawks himself about, \"Will any one buy me with half a lakh  of gold coins, and deliver me from an ocean of sorrows.\" No one responds  to his offer. No buyer appears. The sun is about to set. Death stares  him in the face. Not that he fears death. Why should he fear it? He has  given away his kingdom. His queen has been sold. Life has no further  attraction for him. Death has been stripped of its terrors. But death by  the fire of a Brahmin's anger leads to everlasting hell. He sees the  vision of hell, falls down on the ground like a plantain tree blown by a  tempest, and faints.    Virtue preserves him who practises virtue. Virtue assumes the form of a  Chandal and accompanied by an attendant, makes his appearance, with a  half-burnt bamboo on his shoulders and a chain of skeletons round his  neck. He is ready to buy the king, who now weeps bitterly, and holding  the feet of the sage, entreats him thus:--    \"Oh lord Kausika! Do me a favour I pray you. Do not sell me to a  Chandal. Do _you_ rather buy me. I shall be your slave for ever.\"    On this, the sage flies into a rage and exclaims:--    \"Oh villain! Do not trifle with me. You have all this time been  pretending that you want buyers. As soon as a buyer appears in the  field, you feel ashamed to be sold to a Chandal! I cannot brook any more  delay. I take up water to destroy you.\"    The king begs his pardon, sells himself to the Chandal and pays down the  fee to the sage, who then retires.    The king now puts on the dress of a Chandal and is appointed with two  others to collect rags in a burning-ground. Hideous is the  burning-ground. Dogs and jackals are tearing up carcasses which lie  scattered all round. Vultures are quarrelling among themselves. These  sights unloosen the bonds that bind him to the world. The king is  trembling with fear. His two colleagues have left him. But he will not  leave his station. He must do his duty. The night deepens. The  burning-ground becomes still more hideous. To try the king's sense of  duty, Virtue once more becomes incarnate and this time appears before  the king in a horrible form. The king has never before seen such a  terrible sight, but still he will not leave his station. Not one or two  but myriads of such forms dance before him, but in vain. The king  exclaims, \"No one shall be allowed to burn any corpse without depositing  rags and couches with me. I am the agent of the lord of this  burning-ground. I make this proclamation by order of my lord.\"    No one responds. No voice is heard; only horrible figures are seen  playing around him. After a while, a hermit comes and says.    \"I am a hermit. I have resolved to practise some _mantras_. I have come  to know everything about you by my powers of _yoga_. You are a king and  you should protect me from the demons that disturb my meditations.\"    The king most humbly submits, \"My body is not my own; I have sold it to  the lord of the Chandals. How can I forsake my duty to my lord to save  you?\"    The hermit says, \"come and help me if I ever suffer extreme distress.\"    The king replies, \"If I can ever help you without detriment to the  business of my lord, I am ready to do it.\" The hermit retires, and after  a short time he returns; and says,    \"By your help I am now versed in all _mantras_. I am prepared to give  you such a mantra as by its virtue you will be able at once to repair to  Heaven. You need not suffer hell by slavery to a Chandal.\"    The king replies, \"Many thanks for your kind offer. But how can I accept  your offer as this body belongs to a Chandal? I will not go anywhere  before death.\"    The hermit says, \"Then take this money and deliver your wife.\"    The king thankfully declines the offer with the observation, \"I have  sold my queen in my hour of need. To buy her back is not in my power.\"  The hermit soliloquizes,    \"Blessed is Maharaja Harischandra! What fortitude! what wisdom! what  generosity! what a sense of duty! The world has never produced a nobler  man. A tempest shakes even the mountains, but behold! this noblest  specimen of humanity is not moved by the severest of afflictions!    It is morning. The birds are singing. The sun is up in the horizon. The  king is sitting on the banks of the Ganges. He is thinking of his fate  when he hears a female voice crying. He approaches the lady. The scene  is horrible. An unfortunate lady, the queen Saibya who had been deserted  by her husband, has come to burn her son, the support of her life. She  was serving as a slave in the house of the Brahmin who had bought her.  Her son Rohitashya, was stung by a deadly poisonous snake. No body would  help her. She has come to the burning-ground to burn the dead body of  her son. The queen weeps and faints. The king stares at the face of the  corpse for a long time and at last recognises his dead son. He too  faints. After a long time he recovers, and finds that the queen also has  recovered. He thinks of committing suicide, but the body is not his  own. He thinks of pacifying the queen by introducing himself, but his  present costume will perhaps aggravate her sorrows. The queen, looking  up to the skies, exclaims; \"It is high time for me to return to the  house of my master. I forget I am a slave. My master will be angry if I  am late. My husband will incur blame if my master is angry. Let me go at  once.\"    The king reflects, \"If my queen is so mindful of her duties to her  master in the midst of such calamities, I must never forget my duty to  my master.\"    Then he approaches the queen and addresses her thus:--    \"Who are you? You are not allowed to burn the corpse before you give up  its clothes to me, the slave of the lord of this place.\" She replies,    \"Please wait a little. I will take off the clothes.\"    As the queen delivers the clothes into the hands of the slave, she  notices signs of royalty in his hands and is surprised that such a hand  is engaged in so low an office.    \"She looks attentively and exclaims in a wild voice, Oh my lord! Oh  Maharaja! you a slave in this burning-ground! Oh lord Kausika! are you  not yet satisfied?\" The queen rushes to embrace the king. The king  starts away from her and forbids her saying, \"Oh my queen! do not touch  me, I am the slave of a Chandal. Be patient.\" She faints again.    The king cannot touch her as he is in the garb of a Chandal. After a  while, the queen recovers, and the king addresses her thus:--    \"Oh my lady! Abandon lamentations. It is useless to lament. All this is  the result of work in previous lives. I will prepare a funeral pyre.  Apply the sacrament of fire to the dead body and return at once to the  house of your master.\" The queen is disconsolate and wants to remain  with her husband, who explains the situation thus:--\"You have no right  to remain here. Do not forget that your person has been sold to the  Brahmin.\"    The queen understands and sighs.    All on a sudden, flowers are showered on their heads from Heaven, and  musical voices are heard on high proclaiming.    \"Blessed is Maharaja Harischandra; Blessed is Rani Shaibya! unrivalled  in this world is the liberality, the patience, the resolution and the  wisdom of the king. No nobler man can be found in the three worlds.\"    The king and the queen stare motionless towards the Heavens.    Now virtue"]]]
