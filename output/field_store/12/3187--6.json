'It is hot enough here to roast a polar bear,' said the Northwind.    'You are a polar bear yourself!' said the Southwind.    'Do you want to go into the bag?' asked the old woman. 'Sit down on that  stone and tell us where you have been.'    'In Africa, mother!' he answered. 'I have been chasing the lion with the  Hottentots in Kaffirland! What grass there is on those plains! as green  as an olive. The gnu was dancing about, and the ostriches ran races with  me, but I am still the fastest. I went to the desert with its yellow  sand. It looks like the bottom of the sea. I met a caravan! They were  killing their last camel to get water to drink, but it wasn't much they  got. The sun was blazing above, and the sand burning below. There were  no limits to the outstretched desert. Then I burrowed into the fine  loose sand and whirled it up in great columns--that was a dance! You  should have seen how despondently the dromedaries stood, and the  merchant drew his caftan over his head. He threw himself down before me  as if I had been Allah, his god. Now they are buried, and there is a  pyramid of sand over them all; when I blow it away, sometime the sun  will bleach their bones, and then travellers will see that people have  been there before, otherwise you would hardly believe it in the desert!'    'Then you have only been doing harm!' said the mother. 'Into the bag you  go!' And before he knew where he was she had the Southwind by the waist  and in the bag; it rolled about on the ground, but she sat down upon it  and then it had to be quiet.    'Your sons are lively fellows!' said the Prince.    'Yes, indeed,' she said; 'but I can master them! Here comes the fourth.'    It was the Eastwind, and he was dressed like a Chinaman.    'Oh, have you come from that quarter?' said the mother. 'I thought you  had been in the Garden of Paradise.'    'I am only going there to-morrow!' said the Eastwind. 'It will be a  hundred years to-morrow since I have been there. I have just come from  China, where I danced round the porcelain tower till all the bells  jingled. The officials were flogged in the streets, the bamboo canes  were broken over their shoulders, and they were all people ranging from  the first to the ninth rank. They shrieked \"Many thanks, Father and  benefactor,\" but they didn't mean what they said, and I went on ringing  the bells and singing \"Tsing, tsang, tsu!\"'    'You're quite uproarious about it!' said the old woman. 'It's a good  thing you are going to the Garden of Paradise to-morrow; it always has a  good effect on your behaviour. Mind you drink deep of the well of  wisdom, and bring a little bottleful home to me.'    'That I will,' said the Eastwind, 'But why have you put my brother from  the south into the bag? Out with him. He must tell me about the  phoenix; the Princess always wants to hear about that bird when I call  every hundred years. Open the bag! then you'll be my sweetest mother,  and I'll give you two pockets full of tea as green and fresh as when I  picked it!'    'Well, for the sake of the tea, and because you are my darling, I will  open my bag!'    She did open it and the Southwind crept out, but he was quite  crestfallen because the strange Prince had seen his disgrace.    'Here is a palm leaf for the Princess!' said the Southwind. 'The old  phoenix, the only one in the world, gave it to me. He has scratched  his whole history on it with his bill, for the hundred years of his  life, and she can read it for herself. I saw how the phoenix set fire  to his nest himself and sat on it while it burnt, like the widow of a  Hindoo. Oh, how the dry branches crackled, how it smoked, and what a  smell there was! At last it all burst into flame; the old bird was burnt  to ashes, but his egg lay glowing in the fire; it broke with a loud bang  and the young one flew out. Now it rules over all the birds, and it is  the only phoenix in the world. He bit a hole in the leaf I gave you;  that is his greeting to the Princess.'    'Let us have something to eat now!' said the mother of the winds; and  they all sat down to eat the roast stag, and the Prince sat by the side  of the Eastwind, so they soon became good friends.    'I say,' said the Prince, 'just tell me who is this Princess, and where  is the Garden of Paradise?'    'Oh ho!' said the Eastwind, 'if that is where you want to go you must  fly with me to-morrow. But I may as well tell you that no human being  has been there since Adam and Eve's time. You know all about them I  suppose from your Bible stories?'    'Of course,' said the Prince.    'When they were driven away the Garden of Eden sank into the ground, but  it kept its warm sunshine, its mild air, and all its charms. The queen  of the fairies lives there. The Island of Bliss, where death never  enters, and where living is a delight, is there. Get on my back  to-morrow and I will take you with me; I think I can manage it! But you  mustn't talk now, I want to go to sleep.'    When the Prince woke up in the early morning, he was not a little  surprised to find that he was already high above the clouds. He was  sitting on the back of the Eastwind, who was holding him carefully; they  were so high up that woods and fields, rivers and lakes, looked like a  large coloured map.    'Good morning,' said the Eastwind. 'You may as well sleep a little  longer, for there is not much to be seen in this flat country below us,  unless you want to count the churches. They look like chalk dots on the  green board.'    He called the fields and meadows 'the green board.'    'It was very rude of me to leave without saying good-bye to your mother  and brothers,' said the Prince.    'One is excused when one is asleep!' said the Eastwind, and they flew on  faster than ever. You could mark their flight by the rustling of the  trees as they passed over the woods; and whenever they crossed a lake,  or the sea, the waves rose and the great ships dipped low down in the  water, like floating swans. Towards evening the large towns were amusing  as it grew dark, with all their lights twinkling now here, now there,  just as when one burns a piece of paper and sees all the little sparks  like children coming home from school. The Prince clapped his hands, but  the Eastwind told him he had better leave off and hold tight, or he  might fall and find himself hanging on to a church steeple.    The eagle in the great forest flew swiftly, but the Eastwind flew more  swiftly still. The Kossack on his little horse sped fast over the  plains, but the Prince sped faster still.    [Illustration: _The eagle in the great forest flew swiftly, but the  Eastwind flew more swiftly still._]    'Now you can see the Himalayas!' said the Eastwind. 'They are the  highest mountains in Asia; we shall soon reach the Garden of Paradise.'    They took a more southerly direction, and the air became scented with  spices and flowers. Figs and pomegranates grew wild, and the wild vines  were covered with blue and green grapes. They both descended here and  stretched themselves on the soft grass, where the flowers nodded to the  wind, as much as to say, 'Welcome back.'    'Are we in the Garden of Paradise now?' asked the Prince.    'No, certainly not!' answered the Eastwind. 'But we shall soon be there.  Do you see that wall of rock and the great cavern where the wild vine  hangs like a big curtain? We have to go through there! Wrap yourself up  in your cloak, the sun is burning here, but a step further on it is icy  cold. The bird which flies past the cavern has one wing out here in the  heat of summer, and the other is there in the cold of winter.'    'So that is the way to the Garden of Paradise!' said the Prince.    Now they entered the cavern. Oh, how icily cold it was; but it did not  last long. The Eastwind spread his wings, and they shone like the  brightest flame; but what a cave it was! Large blocks of stone, from  which the water dripped, hung over them in the most extraordinary  shapes; at one moment it was so low and narrow that they had to crawl  on hands and knees, the next it was as wide and lofty as if they were in  the open air. It looked like a chapel of the dead, with mute organ pipes  and petrified banners.    'We seem to be journeying along Death's road to the Garden of Paradise!'  said the Prince, but the Eastwind never answered a word, he only pointed  before them where a beautiful blue light was shining. The blocks of  stone above them grew dimmer and dimmer, and at last they became as  transparent as a white cloud in the moonshine. The air was also  deliciously soft, as fresh as on the mountain-tops and as scented as  down among the roses in the valley.    A river ran there as clear as the air itself, and the fish in it were  like gold and silver. Purple eels, which gave out blue sparks with every  curve, gambolled about in the water; and the broad leaves of the  water-lilies were tinged with the hues of the rainbow, while the flower  itself was like a fiery orange flame, nourished by the water, just as  oil keeps a lamp constantly burning. A firm bridge of marble, as  delicately and skilfully carved as if it were lace and glass beads, led  over the water to the Island of Bliss, where the Garden of Paradise  bloomed.    The Eastwind took the Prince in his arms and bore him over. The flowers  and leaves there sang all the beautiful old songs of his childhood, but  sang them more wonderfully than any human voice could sing them.    Were these palm trees or giant water plants growing here? The Prince  had never seen such rich and mighty trees. The most wonderful climbing  plants hung in wreaths, such as are only to be found pictured in gold  and colours on the margins of old books of the Saints or entwined among  their initial letters. It was the most extraordinary combination of  birds, flowers and scrolls.    Close by on the grass stood a flock of peacocks with their brilliant  tails "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17866"],[0,"Murder in the Gunroom (#11)"],[1,"ssing, as  was the front ramrod-thimble, both the trigger-guard and the butt-cap  were loose, and when Rand touched the wheel, it revolved freely if  sluggishly, betraying a broken spring or chain.    The vertical row next to it seemed to be all snaphaunces, but among them  Rand saw a pair of Turkish flintlocks. Not even good Turkish flintlocks;  a pair of the sort of weapons hastily thrown together by native craftsmen  or imported ready-made from Belgium for bazaar sale to gullible tourists.  Among the fine examples of seventeenth-century Brescian gunmaking above  and below it, these things looked like a pair of Dogpatchers in the  Waldorf's Starlight Room. Rand contemplated them with distaste, then  shrugged. After all, they might have had some sentimental significance;  say souvenirs of a pleasantly remembered trip to the Levant.    A few rows farther on, among some exceptionally fine flintlocks, all  of which pre-dated 1700, he saw one of those big Belgian navy pistols,  _circa_ 1800, of the sort once advertised far and wide by a certain  old-army-goods dealer for $6.95. This was a particularly repulsive  specimen of its breed; grimy with hardened dust and gummed oil, maculated  with yellow-surface-rust, the brasswork green with corrosion. It was  impossible to shrug off a thing like that. From then on, Rand kept his  eyes open for similar incongruities.    They weren't hard to find. There was a big army pistol, of Central  European origin and in abominable condition, among a row of fine  multi-shot flintlocks. Multi-shot ... Stephen Gresham had mentioned an  Elisha Collier flintlock revolver. It wasn't there. It should be hanging  about where this post-Napoleonic German thing was.    There was no Hall breech-loader, either, but there was a dilapidated old  Ketland. There were many such interlopers among the U.S. Martials: an  English ounce-ball cavalry pistol, a French 1777 and a French 1773, a  couple more $6.95 bargain-counter specials, a miserable altered S. North  1816. Among the Colts, there was some awful junk, including a big Spanish  hinge-frame .44 and a Belgian imitation of a Webley R.I.C. Model. There  weren't as many Paterson Colts as Gresham had spoken of, and the  Whitneyville Walker was absent. It went on like that; about a dozen of  the best pistols which Rand remembered having seen from two years ago  were gone, and he spotted at least twenty items which the late Lane  Fleming wouldn't have hung in his backyard privy, if he'd had one.    Well, that was to be expected. The way these pistols were arranged, the  absence of one from its hooks would have been instantly obvious. So, as  the good stuff had moved out, these disreputable changelings had moved  in.    \"You had rather a shocking experience here, in Mr. Fleming's death,\" Rand  said, over his shoulder, to the butler.    \"Oh, yes indeed, sir!\" Walters seemed relieved that Rand had broken the  silence. \"A great loss to all of us, sir. And so unexpected.\"    He didn't seem averse to talking about it, and went on at some length.  His story closely paralleled that of Gladys Fleming.    \"Mr. Varcek called the doctor immediately,\" he said. \"Then Mr. Dunmore  pointed out that the doctor would be obliged to notify either the coroner  or the police, so he called Mr. Goode, the family solicitor. That was  about twenty minutes after the shot. Mr. Goode arrived directly; he was  here in about ten minutes. I must say, sir, I was glad to see him; to  tell the truth, I had been afraid that the authorities might claim that  Mr. Fleming had shot himself deliberately.\"    Somebody else doesn't like the smell of that accident, Rand thought.  Aloud, he said:    \"Mr. Goode lives nearby, then, I take it?\"    \"Oh, yes, sir. You can see his house from these windows. Over here, sir.\"    Rand looked out the window. The rain-soaked lawn of the Fleming residence  ended about a hundred yards to the west; beyond it, an orchard was  beginning to break into leaf, and beyond the orchard and another lawn  stood a half-timbered Tudor-style house, somewhat smaller than the  Fleming place. A path led down from it to the orchard, and another led  from the orchard to the rear of the house from which Rand looked.    \"Must be comforting to know your lawyer's so handy,\" he commented. \"And  what do you think, Walters? Are you satisfied, in your own mind, that Mr.  Fleming was killed accidentally?\"    The servant looked at him seriously. \"No, sir; I'm not,\" he replied.  \"I've thought about it a great deal, since it happened, sir, and I just  can't believe that Mr. Fleming would have that revolver, and start  working on it, without knowing that it was loaded. That just isn't  possible, if you'll pardon me, sir. And I can't understand how he would  have shot himself while removing the charges. The fact is, when I came up  here at quarter of seven, to call him for cocktails, he had the whole  thing apart and spread out in front of him.\" The butler thought for a  moment. \"I believe Mr. Dunmore had something like that in mind when he  called Mr. Goode.\"    \"Well, what happened?\" Rand asked. \"Did the coroner or the doctor choke  on calling it an accident?\"    \"Oh no, sir; there was no trouble of any sort about that. You see, Dr.  Yardman called the coroner, as soon as he arrived, but Mr. Goode was here  already. He'd come over by that path you saw, to the rear of the house,  and in through the garage, which was open, since Mrs. Dunmore was out  with the coupe. They all talked it over for a while, and the coroner  decided that there would be no need for any inquest, and the doctor wrote  out the certificate. That was all there was to it.\"    Rand looked at the section of pistol-rack devoted to Colts.    \"Which one was it?\" he asked.    \"Oh it's not here, sir,\" Walters replied. \"The coroner took it away with  him.\"    \"And hasn't returned it yet? Well, he has no business keeping it. It's  part of the collection, and belongs to the estate.\"    \"Yes, sir. If I may say so, I thought it was a bit high-handed of him,  taking it away, myself, but it wasn't my place to say anything about it.\"    \"Well, I'll make it mine. If that revolver's what I'm told it is, it's  too valuable to let some damned county-seat politician walk off with.\" A  thought occurred to him. \"And if I find that he's disposed of it, this  county's going to need a new coroner, at least till the present incumbent  gets out of jail.\"    The buzzer of the extension phone went off like an annoyed rattlesnake.  Walters scooped it up, spoke into it, listened for a moment, and handed  it to Rand.    \"For you, sir; Mrs. Fleming.\"    \"Colonel Rand, Carl Gwinnett, the commission-dealer I told you about is  here,\" Gladys told him. \"Do you want to talk to him?\"    \"Why, yes. Do I understand, now, that you and the other ladies want cash,  and don't want the collection peddled off piecemeal?... All right, send  him up. I'll talk to him.\"    A few minutes later, a short, compact-looking man of forty-odd entered  the gunroom, shifting a brief case to his left hand and extending his  right. Rand advanced to meet him and shook hands with him.    \"You're Colonel Rand? Enjoyed your articles in the _Rifleman_,\" he said.  \"Mrs. Fleming tells me you're handling the sale of the collection for the  estate.\"    \"That's right, Mr. Gwinnett. Mrs. Fleming tells me you're interested.\"    \"Yes. Originally, I offered to sell the collection for her on a  commission basis, but she didn't seem to care for the idea, and neither  do the other ladies. They all want spot cash, in a lump sum.\"    \"Yes. Mrs. Fleming herself might have been interested in your  proposition, if she'd been sole owner. You could probably get more for  the collection, even after deducting your commission, than I'll be able  to, but the collection belongs to the estate, and has to be sold before  any division can be made.\"    \"Yes, I see that. Well, how much would the estate, or you, consider a  reasonable offer?\"    \"Sit down, Mr. Gwinnett,\" Rand invited. \"What would you consider a  reasonable offer, yourself? We're not asking any specific price; we're  just taking bids, as it were.\"    \"Well, how much have you been offered, to date?\"    \"Well, we haven't heard from everybody. In fact, we haven't put out a  list, or solicited offers, except locally, as yet. But one gentleman has  expressed a willingness to pay up to twenty-five thousand dollars.\"    Gwinnett's face expressed polite skepticism. \"Colonel Rand!\" he  protested. \"You certainly don't take an offer like that seriously?\"    \"I think it was made seriously,\" Rand replied. \"A respectable profit  could be made on the collection, even at that price.\"    Gwinnett's eyes shifted over the rows of horizontal barrels on the walls.  He was almost visibly wrestling with mental arithmetic, and at the same  time trying to keep any hint of his notion of the collection's real value  out of his face.    \"Well, I doubt if I could raise that much,\" he said. \"Might I ask who's  making this offer?\"    \"You might; I'm afraid I couldn't tell you. You wouldn't want me to  publish your own offer broadcast, would you?\"    \"I think I can guess. If I'm right, don't hold your head in a tub of  water till you get it,\" Gwinnett advised. \"Making a big offer to scare  away competition is one thing, and paying off on it is another. I've seen  that happen before, you know. Fact is, there's one dealer, not far from  here, who makes a regular habit of it. He'll make some fantastic offer,  and then, when everybody's been bluffed out, he'll start making  objections and finding faults, and before long he'll be down to about  a quarter of his original price.\"    \"The practice isn't unknown,\" Rand admitted.    \"I'll bet you don't have this twenty-five thousand dollar offer on paper,  over a signature,\" Gwinnett pursued. \"Well, here.\" He opened his brief  case and extracted a sheet of paper, handing it to Rand. \"You can file  this; I'll stand back of it.\"    Rand"]]]
