The beard was fixed in a gash  in the tree trunk, and the tiny fellow was hopping to and fro, like a  dog at the end of a string, but he could not manage to free himself.  He stared at the children, with his red, fiery eyes, and called out,  \"Why are you standing there? Can't you come and try to help me?\"    \"What were you doing, little fellow?\" enquired Rose-Red.    \"Stupid, inquisitive goose!\" replied the dwarf; \"I meant to split the  trunk, so that I could chop it up for kitchen sticks; big logs would  burn up the small quantity of food we cook, for people like us do  not consume great heaps of food, as you heavy, greedy folk do.  The bill-hook I had driven in, and soon I should have done what  I required; but the tool suddenly sprang from the cleft, which so  quickly shut up again that it caught my handsome white beard; and  here I must stop, for I cannot set myself free. You stupid, pale-faced  creatures! You laugh, do you?\"    In spite of the dwarf's bad temper, the girls took all possible pains  to release the little man, but without avail; the beard could not be  moved, it was wedged too tightly.    \"I will run and get someone else,\" said Rose-Red.    \"Idiot!\" cried the dwarf. \"Who would go and get more people? Already  there are two too many. Can't you think of something better?\"    \"Don't be so impatient,\" said Snow-White. \"I will try to think.\" She  clapped her hands as if she had discovered a remedy, took out her  scissors, and in a moment set the dwarf free by cutting off the end of  his beard.    Immediately the dwarf felt that he was free he seized a sackful  of gold that was hidden among the tree roots, and, lifting it up,  grumbled out, \"Clumsy creatures, to cut off a bit of my beautiful  beard, of which I am so proud! I leave the cuckoos to pay you for what  you did.\" Saying this, he swung the sack across his shoulder and went  off without even casting a glance at the children.    Not long afterwards the two sisters went to angle in the brook,  meaning to catch fish for dinner. As they were drawing near the water  they perceived something, looking like a large grasshopper, springing  towards the stream, as if it were going in. They hurried up to see  what it might be, and found that it was the dwarf. \"Where are you  going?\" said Rose-Red. \"Surely you will not jump into the water?\"    \"I'm not such a simpleton as that!\" yelled the little man. \"Don't you  see that a wretch of a fish is pulling me in?\"    The dwarf had been sitting angling from the side of the stream when,  by ill-luck, the wind had entangled his beard in his line, and just  afterwards a big fish taking the bait, the unamiable little fellow had  not sufficient strength to pull it out; so the fish had the advantage,  and was dragging the dwarf after it. Certainly he caught at every  stalk and spray near him, but that did not assist him greatly; he was  forced to follow all the twistings of the fish, and was perpetually in  danger of being drawn into the brook.    The girls arrived just in time. They caught hold of him firmly, and  endeavoured to untwist his beard from the line, but in vain; it was  too tightly entangled. There was nothing left but again to make use of  the scissors; so they were taken out, and the tangled portion was cut  off.    When the dwarf noticed what they were about, he exclaimed, in a great  rage, \"Is this how you damage my beard? Not content with making it  shorter before, you are now making it still smaller, and completely  spoiling it. I shall not ever dare to show my face to my friends.  I wish you had missed your way before you took this road.\" Then he  fetched a sack of pearls that lay among the rushes, and saying not  another word, hobbled off and disappeared behind a large stone.    Soon after this it chanced that the poor widow sent her children to  the town to purchase cotton, needles, ribbon and tape. The way to the  town ran over a common on which in every direction large masses  of rocks were scattered about. The children's attention was soon  attracted to a big bird that hovered in the air. They remarked that  after circling slowly for a time, and gradually getting nearer to  the ground, it all of a sudden pounced down amongst a mass of rock.  Instantly a heart-rending cry reached their ears, and, running quickly  to the place, they saw, with horror, that the eagle had seized their  former acquaintance, the dwarf, and was just about to carry him off.  The kind children did not hesitate for an instant. They took a firm  hold of the little man, they strove so stoutly with the eagle for  possession of his contemplated prey, that, after much rough treatment  on both sides, the dwarf was left in the hands of his brave little  friends, and the eagle took to flight.    As soon as the little man had in some measure recovered from his  alarm, his small, squeaky, cracked voice was heard saying, \"Couldn't  you have held me more gently? See my little coat; you have rent and  damaged it in a fine manner, you clumsy, officious things!\" Then he  picked up a sack of jewels, and slipped out of sight behind a piece of  rock.    The maidens by this time were quite used to his ungrateful, ungracious  ways; so they took no notice of it, but went on their way, made their  purchases, and then were ready to return to their happy home.    [Illustration: _Painted by Jennie Harbour_  SNOW-WHITE AND ROSE-RED]    On their way back, suddenly, once more they ran across their dwarf  friend.    Upon a clear space he had turned out his sack of jewels, so that he  could count and admire them, for he had not imagined that anybody  would at so late an hour be coming across the common. The setting sun  was shining upon the brilliant stones, and their changing hues and  sparkling rays caused the children to pause to admire them also.    \"What are you gazing at?\" cried the dwarf, at the same time becoming  red with rage; \"and what are you standing there for, making ugly  faces?\"    It is probable that he might have proceeded in the same complimentary  manner, but suddenly a great growl was heard near by them, and a big  bear joined the party. Up jumped the dwarf in extremest terror, but  could not get to his hiding-place, the bear was too close to him; so  he cried out in very evident anguish--    \"Dear Mr. Bear, forgive me, I pray! I will render to you all my  treasure. Just see those precious stones lying there! Grant me my  life! What would you do with such an insignificant little fellow?  You would not notice me between your teeth. See, though, those  two children, they would be delicate morsels, and are as plump as  partridges; I beg of you to take them, good Mr. Bear, and let me go.\"    But the bear would not be moved by his speeches. He gave the  ill-disposed creature a blow with his paw, and he lay lifeless on the  ground. Meanwhile, the maidens were running away, making off for home  as well as they could; but all of a sudden they were stopped by a  well-known voice that called out, \"Snow-White, Rose-Red, stay! Do not  fear. I will accompany you.\"    The bear quickly came towards them, but as he reached their side,  suddenly the bear-skin slipped to the ground, and there before them  was standing a handsome man, completely garmented in gold, who said,  \"I am a king's son, who was enchanted by the wicked dwarf lying  over there. He stole my treasure, and compelled me to roam the woods  transformed into a big bear until his death should set me free.  Therefore he has only received a well-deserved punishment.\"    [Illustration: \"THE BEARSKIN SLIPPED TO THE GROUND.\"]    Then Rose-Red and Snow-White and the Prince all went back to the  cottage, and some time afterwards Snow-White married the Prince, and  Rose-Red, his brother, who shared between them the enormous treasure  which the dwarf had collected in his cave.    The old mother spent many happy years with her children. The two  rose-trees she took with her when she left the cottage, and they grew  in front of her window, where they continued to bear each year the  most beautiful roses, red and white.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE SLEEPING BEAUTY      Once upon a time there lived a king and queen who had no children; and  this they lamented very much. But one day, as the queen was walking by  the side of the river, a little fish lifted its head out of the water,  and said, \"Your wish shall be fulfilled, and you shall soon have a  daughter.\"    What the little fish had foretold soon came to pass; and the Queen had  a little girl who was so very beautiful that the king could not cease  looking on her for joy, and determined to hold a great feast. So he  invited not only his relations, friends, and neighbours, but also all  the fairies, that they might be kind and good to his little daughter.  Now there were thirteen fairies in his kingdom, and he had only twelve  golden dishes for them to eat out of, so that he was obliged to leave  one of the fairies without an invitation. The rest came, and after the  feast was over they gave all their best gifts to the little princess;  one gave her virtue, another beauty, another riches, and so on till  she had all that was excellent in the world. When eleven had done  blessing her, the thirteenth, who had not been invited, and was very  angry on that account, came in, and determined to take her revenge.  So she cried out, \"The King's daughter shall in her fifteenth year be  wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.\" Then the twelfth, who had  not yet given her gift, came forward and said that the bad wish  must be fulfilled, but that she could soften it, and that the king's  daughter should not die, but fall asleep for a hundred years.    [Illustration]    But the king hoped to save his dear child from the threatened evil,  and ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom should be bought up  and destroyed.

Then work a circle    [Illustration: 58.--Tatting Medallion.]    as follows: 5 double, fasten the cotton, 13 double, 1 purl, 13 double, 1  purl, 5 double; then a similar circle, but always working 14 double  instead of 13. The next circle consists of 6 double, fasten the cotton,  15 double, 1 purl, 15 double, 1 purl, 6 double; the two following  circles are worked in the same manner, working 16 double instead of 15.  Then comes the largest circle of the round, which consists of 6 double,  17 double, 1 purl, 17 double, 1 purl, 6 double. Work 11 circles more  like the 2nd to 12th of those just described (the 13th circle forms the  middle), only the order of sizes must be reversed, so that the round  closes with the smallest circle. Then fasten both ends of the cotton  together, so that the circles are joined into a circle. Then work round  this row of circles another round, the circles of which must be of  graduated sizes like those of the first round. Fasten the cotton on to  the middle purl of the first small circle of the first round, and work  one circle as follows:--3 double, 1 purl, 6 times alternately 2 double,  1 purl, then 3 double; fasten the cotton on to the middle purl of the  next circle, &c. The remaining circles are worked in the same manner,  only they must be increased and decreased in size gradually like the  circles of the first round; this is done by increasing or decreasing the  number of purl, instead of working the first purl of every following  circle, fasten it on to the last purl of the preceding circle. When the  round is completed, fasten both ends of the cotton together. In the  centre of the oval pattern, fasten 6 five-branched patterns of graduated  size, which are worked in one piece. For the smallest of these patterns  work first three circles, consisting of 5 double, 1 purl, 5 times  alternately 2 double, 1 purl, then again 5 double (these circles must be  close to each other; the second and third circles must, moreover, be  fastened on to the last purl of the preceding circle). The cotton is  then fastened on the first circle between the beginning and the end of  the same, then work close to them two small circles, consisting of 6  double, 1 purl, 6 double, fasten the cotton between the beginning and  the end of the third circle. The other five-branched patterns are worked  in the same manner at intervals of about three-tenths of an inch; but  the separate circles of each pattern must become gradually larger. In  the largest pattern the three large circles consist of 5 double, 1 purl,  8 times alternately 2 double, 1 purl, 5 double; the two smaller circles  consist each of 15 double, 1 purl, 15 double; the size of the other  patterns can easily be worked from this; the cotton which joins these  last together is covered by over-casting with a needle and thread, so as  to imitate double stitches. The five-branched patterns are then fastened  in the oval pattern; they must overlap each other to half way, as seen  in the illustration.           *       *       *       *       *    59.--_Tatted Diamond_.    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 40, or 80  if required finer; tatting-pin No. 3.    [Illustration: 59--Tatted Diamond.]    This pattern is meant to ornament lingerie; it is worked with fine  tatting cotton in the following manner:--Work a * circle consisting of 6  double, 1 purl, 6 double, turn the circle downwards and work at a short  distance another circle consisting of 5 double, 4 purl divided by 2  double, 5 double; at a similar distance a circle of 5 double fastened on  to the last purl of the preceding circle, 2 double, 5 purl divided by 2  double, 5 double; then again a circle consisting of 5 double fastened on  to the last purl of the preceding circle, 2 double, 3 purl divided by 2  double, 5 double: fasten the cotton on to the first circle. Then turn  the work so that the last three circles are turned downwards, leave an  interval of at least three-fourths of an inch, and repeat three times  more from *, fastening the circles on to each other from illustration.  Knot together the beginning and end of the cotton, work button-hole  stitches round the cotton which joins the circles, as shown in  illustration. The purl stitches of the four middle circles of the  diamond are knotted together.           *       *       *       *       *    60.--_Tatted Cravat End_.    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 50;  tatting-pin No. 3; 2 shuttles.    This cravat end is given in full size. It is ornamented with a tatted  medallion, edged with lace. The tatting is worked with tatting fine  cotton and two shuttles. Make first the two rosettes which form the  centre of the medallion, then the insertion-like part which edges the  rosettes. The larger rosette is worked as follows:--Knot the cotton of  both shuttles together and work with 1 shuttle only 1 circle consisting  of 10 double, 1 purl one-fifth of an inch long, 10 double; * close to  this circle, which is turned downwards, work over the cotton with the  other shuttle, 1 double, 1 purl, 8 double; this forms one of the  scallops joining two circles. Then turn the work again and work close to  the just completed scallop another circle like the first, but which is  joined to the first circle instead of working the purl. Repeat 4 times  more from *. Then work another scallop and fasten both ends of cotton on  to the cotton over which the first scallop has been worked, at the place  where the scallop is joined to the first circle. The first round of the  rosette is thus completed. Work then the 2nd round over the cotton on  the 2nd shuttle, beginning to work where the two ends of cotton have  been fastened, * 6 double, 1 purl, 5 double, fastened on to the purl of  the next scallop of the preceding round, 5 double, 1 purl, 6 double  fastened on to the cotton between two scallops of the    [Illustration: 60.--Tatted Cravat End.]    preceding round; repeat 5 times more from *. The larger rosette is now  completed. The smaller rosette is worked like the first, only without  the second round. The insertion-like border is worked in two halves as  follows:--The half which touches the edge of the medallion is worked as  follows:--Knot both ends of cotton together and *, work with 1 shuttle  only 1 circle consisting of 8 double, 1 purl one-fifth of an inch long,  8 double; turn the circle downwards and work close to it over the cotton  on the 2nd shuttle 6 double, 1 purl, 6 double; this forms a scallop of  the border. Then turn the work again and work close to the scallop  another circle like the first, but which is fastened on to the first  circle instead of working the purl. Turn the work again, work a scallop  like the preceding one, and repeat 15 times more from *, only the  scallops at the lower edge of the medallion must have a few double  stitches more, as can be seen in illustration. After working the last  scallop fasten the two ends of the cotton on to the 1st circle; then cut  them off. The second inner half is worked like the first; only the  circles are worked without any purl stitch, and fastened on to the  circles of the first half from illustration; the scallops of this half  are somewhat smaller; each consists of 5 double, 1 purl, 5 double. The  completed border is sewn on to the rosettes from illustration; the  different pieces must be first fastened on cardboard. The cotton must be  wound several times round the long threads, as seen in illustration. The  medallion is then sewn into the muslin at the top only; the remaining  border is edged, before joining it to the muslin, with a straight row of  knots to be worked over cotton, and fastened on to each outer scallop of  the border at regular intervals. The number of double stitches between  two purl is different, as distinctly seen in illustration. For the lace  knot both ends of cotton together, * work with one shuttle only 1 circle  consisting of 8 double, 1 purl, 8 double; turn the work and make  another circle consisting of 2 double, 9 times alternately 1 purl, 2  double; then fasten this circle on to the preceding one, where it has  been joined into a circle, so that both circles meet as seen in  illustration. After having turned the work again, work 9 double over the  cotton on the 2nd shuttle, which form a scallop between the circles, and  repeat from *. The lace is then sewn round the edge of the muslin.           *       *       *       *       *    61.--_Rosette in Tatting and Embroidery_.    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 60, or No.  40 if desired in a larger size.    [Illustration: 61. Rosette in Tatting and Embroidery.]    This rosette is suitable for ornamenting lingeries, cravats, &c. It is  worked in white embroidery and lace stitch, and edged all round with a  tatted lace. For the latter work with very fine cotton * 1 large circle,  consisting of 5 double, 1 purl, 7 times alternately 2 double, 1 purl,  then 5 double. At a short distance from this circle work a smaller one,  consisting of 5 double fastened on to the last purl of the large circle,  5 double. Leave again an interval as small as the last, and repeat from  * 11 times more. But in working the large circles, instead of working  the 1st purl, fasten them on the same purl of the large circle on which  the small circle has been fastened; besides this, in working the last  (12th) large circle, instead of working the last purl, fasten it on the  1st purl of the 1st circle; the last small circle is fastened on to the  same purl. The lace is thus joined into a circle, and is sewn round the  outside of the rosette with button-hole stitches.           *       *       *       *       *    62.--_Cravat End in Tatting_.
