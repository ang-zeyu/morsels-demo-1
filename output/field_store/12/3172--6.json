[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17461"],[0,"The Great German Composers (#11)"],[1,"operas are produced. One knows not whether to be amazed or to  laugh at seeing 'Alceste,' 'Alcides,' etc., put on the stage with all  due solemnity and played by puppets. His orchestra is one of the best  I ever heard, and the great Hadyn is his court and theatre composer.  He employs a poet for his singular theatre, whose humor and skill  in suiting the grandest subjects for the stage, and in parodying the  gravest effects, are often exceedingly happy. He often engages a troupe  of wandering players for months at a time, and he himself and his  retinue form the entire audience. They are allowed to come on the stage  uncombed, drunk, their parts not half learned, and half dressed. The  prince is not for the serious and tragic, and he enjoys it when the  players, like Sancho Panza, give loose reins to their humor.\"    Yet Haydn was not perfectly contented. He would have been had it not  been for his terrible wife, the hair-dresser's daughter, who had a  dismal, mischievous, sullen nature, a venomous tongue, and a savage  temper. She kept Haydn in hot water continually, till at last he broke  loose from this plague by separating from her. Scandal says that  Haydn, who had a very affectionate and sympathetic nature, found ample  consolation for marital infelicity in the charms and society of the  lovely Boselli, a great singer. He had her picture painted, and humored  all her whims and caprices, to the sore depletion of his pocket.    In after-years again he was mixed up in a little affair with the great  Mrs. Billington, whose beautiful person was no less marked than her fine  voice. Sir Joshua Reynolds was painting her portrait for him, and had  represented her as St. Cecilia listening to celestial music. Haydn paid  her a charming compliment at one of the sittings.    \"What do you think of the charming Billington's picture?\" said Sir  Joshua.    \"Yes,\" said Haydn, \"it is indeed a beautiful picture. It is just like  her, but there's a strange mistake.\"    \"What is that?\"    \"Why, you have painted her listening to the angels, when you ought to  have painted the angels listening to her.\"    At one time, during Haydn's connection with Prince Esterhazy, the  latter, from motives of economy, determined to dismiss his celebrated  orchestra, which he supported at great expense. Haydn was the leader,  and his patron's purpose caused him sore pain, as indeed it did all the  players, among whom were many distinguished instrumentalists. Still,  there was nothing to be done but for all concerned to make themselves as  cheerful as possible under the circumstances; so, with that fund of wit  and humor which seems to have been concealed under the immaculate coat  and formal wig of the straitlaced Haydn, he set about composing a work  for the last performance of the royal band, a work which has ever since  borne the appropriate title of the \"Farewell Symphony.\"    On the night appointed for the last performance a brilliant company,  including the prince, had assembled. The music of the new symphony began  gayly enough--it was even merry. As it went on, however, it became  soft and dreamy. The strains were sad and \"long drawn out.\" At length a  sorrowful wailing began. One instrument after another left off, and each  musician, as his task ended, blew out his lamp and departed with his  music rolled up under his arm.    Haydn was the last to finish, save one, and this was the prince's  favorite violinist, who said all that he had to say in a brilliant  violin cadenza, when, behold! he made off.    The prince was astonished. \"What is the meaning of all this?\" cried he.    \"It is our sorrowful farewell,\" answered Haydn.    This was too much. The prince was overcome, and, with a good laugh,  said: \"Well, I think I must reconsider my decision. At any rate, we will  not say 'good-by' now.\"      III.    During the thirty years of Haydn's quiet life with the Esterhazys he had  been gradually acquiring an immense reputation in France, England, and  Spain, of which he himself was unconscious. His great symphonies had  stamped him worldwide as a composer of remarkable creative genius.  Haydn's modesty prevented him from recognizing his own celebrity.  Therefore, we can fancy his astonishment when, shortly after the death  of Prince Nicholas Esterhazy, a stranger called on him and said: \"I am  Salomon, from London, and must strike a bargain with you for that city  immediately.\"    Haydn was dazed with the suddenness of the proposition, but the old ties  were broken up, and his grief needed recreation and change. Still, he  had many beloved friends, whose society it was hard to leave. Chief  among these was Mozart. \"Oh, papa,\" said Mozart, \"you have had no  training for the wide world, and you speak so few languages.\" \"Oh, my  language is understood all over the world,\" said Papa Haydn, with a  smile. When he departed for England, December 15, 1790, Mozart could  with difficulty tear himself away, and said, with pathetic tears, \"We  shall doubtless now take our last farewell.\"    Haydn and Mozart were perfectly in accord, and each thought and did well  toward the other. Mozart, we know, was born when Haydn had just reached  manhood, so that when Mozart became old enough to study composition  the earlier works of Haydn's chamber music had been written; and these  undoubtedly formed the studies of the boy Mozart, and greatly influenced  his style; so that Haydn was the model and, in a sense, the instructor  of Mozart. Strange is it then to find, in after-years, the master  borrowing (perhaps with interest!) from the pupil. Such, however, was  the fact, as every amateur knows. At this we can hardly wonder, for  Haydn possessed unbounded admiration not only for Mozart, but also for  his music, which the following shows. Being asked by a friend at Prague  to send him an opera, he replied:    \"With all my heart, if you desire to have it for yourself alone, but if  you wish to perform it in public, I must be excused; for, being written  specially for my company at the Esterhazy Palace, it would not produce  the proper effect elsewhere. I would do a new score for your theatre;  but what a hazardous step it would be to stand in comparison with  Mozart! Oh, Mozart! If I could instill into the soul of every lover of  music the admiration I have for his matchless works, all countries would  seek to be possessed of so great a treasure. Let Prague keep him, ah!  and well reward him, for without that the history of geniuses is bad;  alas! we see so many noble minds crushed beneath adversity. Mozart is  incomparable, and I am annoyed that he is unable to obtain any court  appointment. Forgive me if I get excited when speaking of him, I am so  fond of him.\"    Mozart's admiration for Haydn's music, too, was very marked. He and  Herr Kozeluch were one day listening to a composition of Haydn's which  contained some bold modulations. Kozeluch thought them strange, and  asked Mozart whether he would have written them. \"I think not,\" smartly  replied Mozart, \"and for this reason: because they would not have  occurred either to you or me!\"    On another occasion we find Mozart taking to task a Viennese professor  of some celebrity, who used to experience great delight in turning to  Haydn's compositions to find therein any evidence of the master's want  of sound theoretical training--a quest in which the pedant occasionally  succeeded. One day he came to Mozart with a great crime to unfold.  Mozart as usual endeavored to turn the conversation, but the learned  professor still went chattering on, till at last Mozart shut his mouth  with the following pill: \"Sir, if you and I were both melted down  together, we should not furnish materials for one Haydn.\"    It was one of the most beautiful friendships in the history of art;  full of tender offices, and utterly free from the least taint of envy or  selfishness.      IV.    Haydn landed in England after a voyage which delighted him in spite of  his terror of the sea--a feeling which seems to be usual among people of  very high musical sensibilities. In his diary we find recorded: \"By four  o'clock we had come twenty miles. The large vessel stood out to sea five  hours longer, till the tide carried it into the harbor. I remained  on deck the whole passage, in order to gaze my fill at that huge  monster--the ocean.\"    The novelty of Haydn's concerts--of which he was to give twenty at fifty  pounds apiece--consisted of their being his own symphonies, conducted  by himself in person. Haydn's name, during his serene, uneventful years  with the Ester-hazys, had become world-famous. His reception was most  brilliant. Dinner parties, receptions, invitations without end, attested  the enthusiasm of the sober English; and his appearance at concerts and  public meetings was the signal for stormy applause. How, in the press of  all this pleasure in which he was plunged, he continued to compose the  great number of works produced at this time, is a marvel. He must have  been little less than a Briareus. It was in England that he wrote the  celebrated Salomon symphonies, the \"twelve grand,\" as they are called.  They may well be regarded as the crowning-point of Haydn's efforts in  that form of writing. He took infinite pains with them, as, indeed,  is well proved by an examination of the scores. More elaborate, more  beautiful, and scored for a fuller orchestra than any others of the one  hundred and twenty or thereabouts which he composed, the Salomon set  also bears marks of the devout and pious spirit in which Haydn ever  labored.    It is interesting to see how, in many of the great works which have won  the world's admiration, the religion of the author has gone hand in hand  with his energy and his genius; and we find Haydn not ashamed to indorse  his score with his prayer and praise, or to offer the fruits of his  talents to the Giver of all. Thus, the symphony in D (No. 6) bears on  the first page of the score "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17474"],[0,"How to Listen to Music, 7th ed. (#11)"],[1,"described as a \"little French violin.\" Its voice, Berlioz  says, is the \"true female voice of the orchestra.\" Generally the  violin part of an orchestral score is two-voiced, but the two groups  may be split into a great number. In one passage in \"Tristan und  Isolde\" Wagner divides his first and second violins into sixteen  groups. Such divisions, especially in the higher regions, are  productive of entrancing effects.    [Sidenote: _Violin effects._]    [Sidenote: _Pizzicato._]    [Sidenote: _\"Col legno dall'arco.\"_]    [Sidenote: _Harmonics._]    [Sidenote: _Vibrato._]    [Sidenote: _\"Con sordino.\"_]    The halo of sound which streams from the beginning and end of the  \"Lohengrin\" prelude is produced by this device. High and close  harmonies from divided violins always sound ethereal. Besides their  native tone quality (that resulting from a string stretched over a  sounding shell set to vibrating by friction), the violins have a  number of modified qualities resulting from changes in manipulation.  Sometimes the strings are plucked (_pizzicato_), when the result is a  short tone something like that of a banjo with the metallic clang  omitted; very dainty effects can thus be produced, and though it  always seems like a degradation of the instrument so pre-eminently  suited to a broad singing style, no less significant a symphonist than  Tschaikowsky has written a Scherzo in which the violins are played  _pizzicato_ throughout the movement. Ballet composers frequently  resort to the piquant effect, but in the larger and more serious forms  of composition, the device is sparingly used. Differences in quality  and expressiveness of tone are also produced by varied methods of  applying the bow to the strings: with stronger or lighter pressure;  near the bridge, which renders the tone hard and brilliant, and over  the end of the finger-board, which softens it; in a continuous manner  (_legato_), or detached (_staccato_). Weird effects in dramatic music  are sometimes produced by striking the strings with the wood of the  bow, Wagner resorting to this means to delineate the wicked glee of  his dwarf _Mime_, and Meyerbeer to heighten the uncanniness of  _Nelusko's_ wild song in the third act of \"L'Africaine.\" Another class  of effects results from the manner in which the strings are \"stopped\"  by the fingers of the left hand. When they are not pressed firmly  against the finger-board but touched lightly at certain places called  nodes by the acousticians, so that the segments below the finger are  permitted to vibrate along with the upper portion, those peculiar  tones of a flute-like quality called harmonics or flageolet tones are  produced. These are oftener heard in dramatic music than in  symphonies; but Berlioz, desiring to put Shakespeare's description of  Queen Mab,        \"Her wagon-spokes made of long spinner's legs;      The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;      The traces, of the smallest spider's web;      The collars, of the moonshine's watery beams--\"    into music in his dramatic symphony, \"Romeo and Juliet,\" achieved a  marvellously filmy effect by dividing his violins, and permitting some  of them to play harmonics. Yet so little was his ingenious purpose  suspected when he first brought the symphony forward in Paris, that  one of the critics spoke contemptuously of this effect as sounding  \"like an ill-greased syringe.\" A quivering motion imparted to the  fingers of the left hand in stopping the strings produces a  tremulousness of tone akin to the _vibrato_ of a singer; and, like the  vocal _vibrato_, when not carried to excess, this effect is a potent  expression of sentimental feeling. But it is much abused by solo  players. Another modification of tone is caused by placing a tiny  instrument called a sordino, or mute, upon the bridge. This clamps  the bridge, makes it heavier, and checks the vibrations, so that the  tone is muted or muffled, and at times sounds mysterious.    [Sidenote: _Pizzicato on the basses._]    [Sidenote: _Tremolo._]    These devices, though as a rule they have their maximum of  effectiveness in the violins, are possible also on the violas,  violoncellos, and double-basses, which, as I have already intimated,  are but violins of a larger growth. The _pizzicato_ is, indeed,  oftenest heard from the double-basses, where it has a much greater  eloquence than on the violins. In music of a sombre cast, the short,  deep tones given out by the plucked strings of the contra-bass  sometimes have the awfulness of gigantic heart-throbs. The difficulty  of producing the other effects grows with the increase of difficulty  in handling the instruments, this being due to the growing thickness  of the strings and the wideness of the points at which they must be  stopped. One effect peculiar to them all--the most used of all  effects, indeed, in dramatic music--is the _tremolo_, produced by  dividing a tone into many quickly reiterated short tones by a rapid  motion of the bow. This device came into use with one of the earliest  pieces of dramatic music. It is two centuries old, and was first used  to help in the musical delineation of a combat. With scarcely an  exception, the varied means which I have described can be detected by  those to whom they are not already familiar by watching the players  while listening to the music.    [Sidenote: _The viola._]    The viola is next in size to the violin, and is tuned at the interval  of a fifth lower. Its highest string is A, which is the second string  of the violin, and its lowest C. Its tone, which sometimes contains a  comical suggestion of a boy's voice in mutation, is lacking in  incisiveness and brilliancy, but for this it compensates by a  wonderful richness and filling quality, and a pathetic and inimitable  mournfulness in melancholy music. It blends beautifully with the  violoncello, and is often made to double that instrument's part for  the sake of color effect--as, to cite a familiar instance, in the  principal subject of the Andante in Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.    [Sidenote: _The violoncello._]    [Sidenote: _Violoncello effects._]    The strings of the violoncello (Plate II.) are tuned like those of  the viola, but an octave lower. It is the knee-fiddle (_viola da  gamba_) of the last century, as the viola is the arm-fiddle (_viola da  braccio_), and got its old name from the position in which it is held  by the player. The 'cello's voice is a bass--it might be called the  barytone of the choir--and in the olden time of simple writing, little  else was done with it than to double the bass part one octave higher.  But modern composers, appreciating its marvellous capacity for  expression, which is next to that of the violin, have treated it with  great freedom and independence as a solo instrument. Its tone is full  of voluptuous languor. It is the sighing lover of the instrumental  company, and can speak the language of tender passion more feelingly  than any of its fellows. The ravishing effect of a multiplication of  its voice is tellingly exemplified in the opening of the overture to  \"William Tell,\" which is written for five solo 'celli, though it is  oftenest heard in an arrangement which gives two of the middle parts  to violas. When Beethoven wished to produce the emotional impression  of a peacefully rippling brook in his \"Pastoral\" symphony, he gave a  murmuring figure to the divided violoncellos, and Wagner uses the  passionate accents of four of these instruments playing in harmony to  support _Siegmund_ when he is pouring out the ecstasy of his love in  the first act of \"Die Walkuere.\" In the love scene of Berlioz's \"Romeo  and Juliet\" symphony it is the violoncello which personifies the  lover, and holds converse with the modest oboe.    [Sidenote: _The double-bass._]    The patriarchal double-bass is known to all, and also its mission of  providing the foundation for the harmonic structure of orchestral  music. It sounds an octave lower than the music written for it, being  what is called a transposing instrument of sixteen-foot tone. Solos  are seldom written for this instrument in orchestral music, though  Beethoven, with his daring recitatives in the Ninth Symphony, makes it  a mediator between the instrumental and vocal forces. Dragonetti and  Bottesini, two Italians, the latter of whom is still alive, won great  fame as solo players on the unwieldy instrument. The latter uses a  small bass viol, and strings it with harp strings; but Dragonetti  played a full double-bass, on which he could execute the most  difficult passages written for the violoncello.    [Sidenote: _The wood-winds._]    Since the instruments of the wood-wind choir are frequently used in  solos, their acquaintance can easily be made by an observing amateur.  To this division of the orchestra belong the gentle accents in the  instrumental language. Violent expression is not its province, and  generally when the band is discoursing in heroic style or giving voice  to brave or angry emotion the wood-winds are either silent or are used  to give weight to the body of tone rather than color. Each of the  instruments has a strongly characteristic voice, which adapts itself  best to a certain style of music; but by use of different registers  and by combinations among them, or with the instruments of the other  choirs, a wide range of expression within the limits suggested has  been won for the wood-winds.    [Sidenote: _The flute._]    [Sidenote: _The piccolo flute._]    [Sidenote: _Janizary music._]    [Sidenote: _The story of the flute._]    The flute, which requires no description, is, for instance, an  essentially soulless instrument; but its marvellous agility and the  effectiveness with which its tones can be blended with others make it  one of the most useful instruments in the band. Its native character,  heard in the compositions written for it as a solo instrument, has  prevented it from being looked upon with"]]]
