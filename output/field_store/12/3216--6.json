A few of the crew then began to haul on the lines, and  thus the Intrepid was drawn gradually toward the frigate.    The suspicions of the Tripolitans were now at last awakened. They raised  the cry of \"Americanos!\" and ordered off the Intrepid, but it was too  late. As the vessels came in contact, Decatur sprang up the main chains  of the Philadelphia, calling out the order to board. He was rapidly  followed by his officers and men, and as they swarmed over the rails and  came upon the deck, the Tripolitan crew gathered, panic-stricken, in a  confused mass on the forecastle. Decatur waited a moment until his men  were behind him, and then, placing himself at their head, drew his sword  and rushed upon the Tripolitans. There was a very short struggle, and  the Tripolitans, crowded together, terrified and surprised, were cut  down or driven overboard. In five minutes the ship was cleared of the  enemy.    Decatur would have liked to have taken the Philadelphia out of the  harbor, but that was impossible. He therefore gave orders to burn the  ship, and his men, who had been thoroughly instructed in what they were  to do, dispersed into all parts of the frigate with the combustibles  which had been prepared, and in a few minutes, so well and quickly was  the work done, the flames broke out in all parts of the Philadelphia. As  soon as this was effected the order was given to return to the Intrepid.  Without confusion the men obeyed. It was a moment of great danger, for  fire was breaking out on all sides, and the Intrepid herself, filled  as she was with powder and combustibles, was in great peril of sudden  destruction. The rapidity of Decatur's movements, however, saved  everything. The cables were cut, the sweeps got out, and the Intrepid  drew rapidly away from the burning frigate. It was a magnificent  sight as the flames burst out over the Philadephia and ran rapidly and  fiercely up the masts and rigging. As her guns became heated they were  discharged, one battery pouring its shots into the town. Finally the  cables parted, and then the Philadelphia, a mass of flames, drifted  across the harbor, and blew up. Meantime the batteries of the shipping  and the castle had been turned upon the Intrepid, but although the  shot struck all around her, she escaped successfully with only one shot  through her mainsail, and, joining the Siren, bore away.    This successful attack was carried through by the cool courage of  Decatur and the admirable discipline of his men. The hazard was very  great, the odds were very heavy, and everything depended on the nerve  with which the attack was made and the completeness of the surprise.  Nothing miscarried, and no success could have been more complete.  Nelson, at that time in the Mediterranean, and the best judge of a naval  exploit as well as the greatest naval commander who has ever lived,  pronounced it \"the most bold and daring act of the age.\" We meet no  single feat exactly like it in our own naval history, brilliant as that  has been, until we come to Cushing's destruction of the Albemarle in  the war of the rebellion. In the years that have elapsed, and among the  great events that have occurred since that time, Decatur's burning of  the Philadephia has been well-nigh forgotten; but it is one of those  feats of arms which illustrate the high courage of American seamen, and  which ought always to be remembered.          THE CRUISE OF THE \"WASP\"         A crash as when some swollen cloud        Cracks o'er the tangled trees!       With side to side, and spar to spar,        Whose smoking decks are these?       I know St. George's blood-red cross,        Thou mistress of the seas,       But what is she whose streaming bars        Roll out before the breeze?         Ah, well her iron ribs are knit,        Whose thunders strive to quell       The bellowing throats, the blazing lips,        That pealed the Armada's knell!       The mist was cleared,--a wreath of stars        Rose o'er the crimsoned swell,       And, wavering from its haughty peak,        The cross of England fell!                             --Holmes.      In the war of 1812 the little American navy, including only a dozen  frigates and sloops of war, won a series of victories against the  English, the hitherto undoubted masters of the sea, that attracted an  attention altogether out of proportion to the force of the combatants  or the actual damage done. For one hundred and fifty years the English  ships of war had failed to find fit rivals in those of any other  European power, although they had been matched against each in turn; and  when the unknown navy of the new nation growing up across the Atlantic  did what no European navy had ever been able to do, not only the English  and Americans, but the people of Continental Europe as well, regarded  the feat as important out of all proportion to the material aspects of  the case. The Americans first proved that the English could be beaten  at their own game on the sea. They did what the huge fleets of France,  Spain, and Holland had failed to do, and the great modern writers  on naval warfare in Continental Europe--men like Jurien de la  Graviere--have paid the same attention to these contests of frigates and  sloops that they give to whole fleet actions of other wars.    Among the famous ships of the Americans in this war were two named the  Wasp. The first was an eighteen-gun ship-sloop, which at the very  outset of the war captured a British brig-sloop of twenty guns, after  an engagement in which the British fought with great gallantry, but were  knocked to Pieces, while the Americans escaped comparatively unscathed.  Immediately afterward a British seventy-four captured the victor. In  memory of her the Americans gave the same name to one of the new sloops  they were building. These sloops were stoutly made, speedy vessels which  in strength and swiftness compared favorably with any ships of their  class in any other navy of the day, for the American shipwrights were  already as famous as the American gunners and seamen. The new Wasp, like  her sister ships, carried twenty-two guns and a crew of one hundred  and seventy men, and was ship-rigged. Twenty of her guns were 32-pound  carronades, while for bow-chasers she had two \"long Toms.\" It was in  the year 1814 that the Wasp sailed from the United States to prey on the  navy and commerce of Great Britain. Her commander was a gallant South  Carolinian named Captain Johnson Blakeley. Her crew were nearly all  native Americans, and were an exceptionally fine set of men. Instead of  staying near the American coasts or of sailing the high seas, the Wasp  at once headed boldly for the English Channel, to carry the war to the  very doors of the enemy.    At that time the English fleets had destroyed the navies of every other  power of Europe, and had obtained such complete supremacy over the  French that the French fleets were kept in port. Off these ports lay the  great squadrons of the English ships of the line, never, in gale or  in calm, relaxing their watch upon the rival war-ships of the French  emperor. So close was the blockade of the French ports, and so hopeless  were the French of making headway in battle with their antagonists,  that not only the great French three-deckers and two-deckers, but their  frigates and sloops as well, lay harmless in their harbors, and the  English ships patroled the seas unchecked in every direction. A few  French privateers still slipped out now and then, and the far bolder and  more formidable American privateersmen drove hither and thither across  the ocean in their swift schooners and brigantines, and harried the  English commerce without mercy.    The Wasp proceeded at once to cruise in the English Channel and off  the coasts of England, France, and Spain. Here the water was traversed  continually by English fleets and squadrons and single ships of war,  which were sometimes covoying detachments of troops for Wellington's  Peninsular army, sometimes guarding fleets of merchant vessels bound  homeward, and sometimes merely cruising for foes. It was this spot,  right in the teeth of the British naval power, that the Wasp chose for  her cruising ground. Hither and thither she sailed through the narrow  seas, capturing and destroying the merchantmen, and by the seamanship  of her crew and the skill and vigilance of her commander, escaping the  pursuit of frigate and ship of the line. Before she had been long on the  ground, one June morning, while in chase of a couple of merchant ships,  she spied a sloop of war, the British brig Reindeer, of eighteen guns  and a hundred and twenty men. The Reindeer was a weaker ship than the  Wasp, her guns were lighter, and her men fewer; but her commander,  Captain Manners, was one of the most gallant men in the splendid British  navy, and he promptly took up the gage of battle which the Wasp threw  down.    The day was calm and nearly still; only a light wind stirred across the  sea. At one o'clock the Wasp's drum beat to quarters, and the sailors  and marines gathered at their appointed posts. The drum of the Reindeer  responded to the challenge, and with her sails reduced to fighting trim,  her guns run out, and every man ready, she came down upon the Yankee  ship. On her forecastle she had rigged a light carronade, and coming up  from behind, she five times discharged this pointblank into the American  sloop; then in the light air the latter luffed round, firing her guns  as they bore, and the two ships engaged yard-arm to yard-arm. The guns  leaped and thundered as the grimy gunners hurled them out to fire and  back again to load, working like demons. For a few minutes the cannonade  was tremendous, and the men in the tops could hardly see the decks for  the wreck of flying splinters. Then the vessels ground together, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18647"],[0,"Peeps at Many Lands: Egypt (#11)"],[1,"importance  than Dendereh, but though Edfu, for example, is quite as perfect and  much larger, it has not quite the same fascination. Others are more  beautiful perhaps, and few Greek temples display more grace of  ornament than Kom Ombo or submerged Philae, while the simple beauty of  Luxor or the immensity of the ruins of Karnac impress one in a manner  quite different from the religious feeling inspired by gloomy  Dendereh.    I have previously spoken of the hum of bees in the fields, but here we  find their nests; for plastered over the cornice, and filling a large  portion of the deeply-cut inscriptions, are the curious mud homes of  the wild bees, who work on industriously, regardless of the attacks  of the hundreds of bee-eaters[8] which feed upon them. Bees are not  the only occupants of the temple, however, for swallows, pigeons, and  owls nest in their quiet interiors, and the dark passages and crypts  are alive with bats.    [Footnote 8: A small bird about the size of a sparrow.]    There are many other temples in Egypt of which I would like to tell  you had I room to do so, but you may presently read more about them in  books specially devoted to this subject. At present I want to say a  few words about _hieroglyphs_, which I have frequently mentioned.    Hieroglyphic writing is really _picture_ writing, and is the oldest  means man has employed to enable him to communicate with his fellows.  We find it in the writing of the Chinese and Japanese, among the  cave-dwellers of Mexico, and the Indian tribes of North America; but  the hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt differed from the others in this  respect, that they had _two_ values, one the _sound_ value of letters  or syllables of which a word was composed, the other the _picture_  value which determined it; thus we find the word \"cat\" or \"dog\"  spelled by two or three signs which give the letters, followed by a  picture of the animal itself, so that there might be no doubt as to  its meaning. This sounds quite simple, but the writing of the ancient  Egyptians had developed into a grammatical system so difficult that it  was only the discovery of the Rosetta stone, which was written in both  hieroglyph and Greek, that gave the scholars of the world their first  clue as to its meaning, and many years elapsed before the most  learned of them were finally able to determine the alphabet and  grammar of the early Egyptians.    I have said nothing about the religion of the Egyptians, because there  were so many different deities worshipped in different places and at  different periods that the subject is a very confusing one, and is  indeed the most difficult problem in Egyptology.    Ra was the great god of the Egyptians, and regarded by them as the  great Creator, is pictured as the sun, the life-giver; the other gods  and goddesses were generally embodiments of his various attributes, or  the eternal laws of nature; while some, like Osiris, were simply  deified human beings. The different seats of the dynasties also had  their various \"triads,\" or trinities, of gods which they worshipped,  while bulls and hawks, crocodiles and cats, have each in turn been  venerated as emblems of some godlike or natural function. Thus the  \"scarab,\" or beetle, is the emblem of eternal life, for the Egyptians  believed in a future state where the souls of men existed in a state  of happiness or woe, according as their lives had been good or evil.  But, like the hieroglyphs, this also is a study for scholars, and the  ordinary visitor is content to admire the decorative effect these  inscriptions give to walls and columns otherwise bare of ornament.    I must not close this slight sketch of its monuments without referring  to the colossal statues so common in Egypt.    Babylonia has its winged bulls and kings of heroic size, Burma its  built effigies of Buddha, but no country but Egypt has ever produced  such mighty images as the monolith statues of her kings which adorn  her many temples, and have their greatest expression in the rock-hewn  temple of Abou Simbel and the imposing colossi of Thebes. In the case  of Abou Simbel, the huge figures of Rameses II. which form the front  of his temple are hewn out of the solid rock, and are 66 feet in  height, forming one of the most impressive sights in Egypt. Though 6  feet less in height, the colossi of Thebes are even more striking,  each figure being carved out of a single block of stone weighing many  hundreds of tons, and which were transported from a great distance to  be placed upon their pedestals in the plain of Thebes.    [Illustration: THE COLOSSI OF THEBES--MOONRISE.]    Surely in the old days of Egypt great ideas possessed the minds of  men, and apart from the vastness of their other monuments, had ever  kings before or since such impressive resting-places as the royal  tombs cut deep into the bowels of the Theban hills, or the stupendous  pyramids of Ghizeh!          CHAPTER IX    THE PEOPLE      Beyond everything else Egypt is an agricultural country, and the  \"fellahin,\" or \"soil-cutters,\" as the word means, its dominant  type, and in order to form any idea of their character or mode of  life, we must leave the towns behind and wander through the farm-lands  of the Delta.    Trains are few, and hotels do not exist, and anyone wishing to see the  people as they are must travel on horseback, and be content with such  accommodation as the villages afford. The roads are the canal-banks,  or little paths which wind among the fields; but, as we have already  seen, the country has many beauties, and the people are so genuine in  their simple hospitality that the traveller has many compensations for  the incidental hardships he may undergo.    What will perhaps first strike the traveller is the industry of the  people. The luxuriant crops give evidence of their labour, and the  fields are everywhere alive. From dawn to dark everyone is busily  employed, from the youngest child who watches the tethered cattle or  brings water from the well, to the old man so soon to find his last  resting-place in the picturesque \"gabana\"[9] without the village.  Seed-time and harvest go side by side in Egypt, and one may often  witness every operation of the farm, from ploughing to threshing,  going on simultaneously. The people seem contented as they work, for  whereas formerly the fellahin were cruelly oppressed by their  rulers, to-day, under British guidance, they have become independent  and prosperous, and secure in the enjoyment of the fruits of their  labour.    [Footnote 9: Cemetery.]    Another impression which the visitor will receive is the curiously  Biblical character of their life, which constantly suggests the Old  Testament stories; the shepherds watching their flocks, ring-streaked  and speckled; the cattle ploughing in the fields; the women grinding  at the handmill, or grouped about the village well, all recall  incidents in the lives of Isaac and Rebekah, and episodes of  patriarchal times. Their salutations and modes of speech are also  Biblical, and lend a touch of poetry to their lives. \"Turn in, my  lord, turn in to me,\" was Jael's greeting to flying Sisera, and  straight-way she prepared for him \"butter in a lordly dish.\" So to-day  hospitality is one of their cardinal virtues, and I have myself been  chased by a horseman who rebuked me for having passed his home without  refreshment.    Steam-pumps, cotton-mills, and railways may have slightly altered the  aspect of the country, but to all intents and purposes, in habit of  thought and speech, in costume and customs, the people remain to-day  much as they were in those remote times pictured in the Book of  Genesis.    Fresh fruit or coffee is frequently proffered to the traveller on  his way, while his welcome at a village or the house of some landed  proprietor is always sure. On approaching a village, which is often  surrounded by dense groves of date-palms, the traveller will be met by  the head men, who, with many salaams, conduct him to the village  \"mandareh,\" or rest-house, and it is only as such a guest, resident in  a village, that one can form any idea of the home-life of the people.    [Illustration: A NILE VILLAGE.]    From the outside the village often has the appearance of some rude  fortification, the houses practically joining each other and their  mud-walls having few openings. Within, narrow and tortuous lanes form  the only thoroughfares, which terminate in massive wooden doors, which  are closed at night and guarded by the village watchman. The huts--for  they are nothing else--which compose the village are seldom of more  than one storey, while in many cases their small doorway forms their  only means of ventilation. Their roofs are covered with a pile of  cotton-stalks and other litter, through which the pungent smoke of  their dung fires slowly percolates, while fowls and goats, and the  inevitable pariah dog roam about them at will.    Windows, when they do occur, are merely slits in the mud wall, without  glass or shutter, but often ornamented by a lattice of split  palm-leaves. Light and ventilation practically do not exist, while a  few mats, water-pots, and cooking utensils comprise the only  furniture; yet the people are well-conditioned and content, for their  life is in the fields, and their poor dwellings are little used except  at meal-times or at night.    The guest-house is little better than the huts, except that one side  is entirely open to the air; here at least the visitor may _breathe_,  even though his slumbers may be disturbed by the sheep and cattle  which wander in the lanes. At night a fire of corn-cobs is lit, and  while its smoke serves to drive away the swarms of mosquitoes and  flies with which the village is usually infested, its warmth is  grateful, for the nights are cold, and by its light, aided by a few  dim lanterns, the simple evening meal is shared with the head men, who  count it an honour to"]]]
