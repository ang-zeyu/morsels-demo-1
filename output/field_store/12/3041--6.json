God had told them only  about the pious, and had concealed from them that there would be  reprobates among mankind, too. And yet, though they knew but half  the truth, the angels were nevertheless prompted to cry out:  \"What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? And the son of man,  that Thou visitest him?\" God replied: \"The fowl of the air and  the fish of the sea, what were they created for? Of what avail a  larder full of appetizing dainties, and no guest to enjoy them?\"  And the angels could not but exclaim: \"O Lord, our Lord, how  excellent is Thy name in all the earth! Do as is pleasing in Thy  sight.\"[12]    For not a few of the angels their opposition bore fatal  consequences. When God summoned the band under the archangel  Michael, and asked their opinion on the creation of man, they  answered scornfully: \"What is man, that Thou art mindful of him?  And the son of man, that Thou visitest him?\" God thereupon  stretched forth His little finger, and all were consumed by fire  except their chief Michael. And the same fate befell the band  under the leadership of the archangel Gabriel; he alone of all  was saved from destruction.      The third band consulted was commanded by the archangel Labbiel.  Taught by the horrible fate of his predecessors, he warned his  troop: \"You have seen what misfortune overtook the angels who  said 'What is man, that Thou art mindful of him?' Let us have a  care not to do likewise, lest we suffer the same dire punishment.  For God will not refrain from doing in the end what He has  planned. Therefore it is advisable for us to yield to His  wishes.\" Thus warned, the angels spoke: \"Lord of the world, it is  well that Thou hast thought of creating man. Do Thou create him  according to Thy will. And as for us, we will be his attendants  and his ministers, and reveal unto him all our secrets.\"  Thereupon God changed Labbiel's name to Raphael, the Rescuer,  because his host of angels had been rescued by his sage advice.  He was appointed the Angel of Healing, who has in his  safe-keeping all the celestial remedies, the types of the medical  remedies used on earth.[12]      THE CREATION OF ADAM      When at last the assent of the angels to the creation of man was  given, God said to Gabriel: \"Go and fetch Me dust from the four  corners of the earth, and I will create man therewith.\" Gabriel  went forth to do the bidding of the Lord, but the earth drove him  away, and refused to let him gather up dust from it. Gabriel  remonstrated: \"Why, O Earth, dost thou not hearken unto the voice  of the Lord, who founded thee upon the waters without props or  pillars?\" The earth replied, and said: \"I am destined to become a  curse, and to be cursed through man, and if God Himself does not  take the dust from me, no one else shall ever do it.\" When God  heard this, He stretched out His hand, took of the dust of the  ground, and created the first man therewith.[14] Of set purpose  the dust was taken from all four corners of the earth, so that if  a man from the east should happen to die in the west, or a man  from the west in the east, the earth should not dare refuse to  receive the dead, and tell him to go whence he was taken.  Wherever a man chances to die, and wheresoever he is buried,  there will he return to the earth from which he sprang. Also, the  dust was of various colors--red, black, white, and green--red for  the blood, black for the bowels, white for the bones and veins,  and green for the pale skin.    At this early moment the Torah interfered. She addressed herself  to God: \"O Lord of the world! The world is Thine, Thou canst do  with it as seemeth good in Thine eyes. But the man Thou art now  creating will be few of days and full of trouble and sin. If it  be not Thy purpose to have forbearance and patience with him, it  were better not to call him into being.\" God replied, \"Is it for  naught I am called long-suffering and merciful?\"[15]    The grace and lovingkindness of God revealed themselves  particularly in His taking one spoonful of dust from the spot  where in time to come the altar would stand, saying, \"I shall  take man from the place of atonement, that he may endure.\"[19]      THE SOUL OF MAN    The care which God exercised in fashioning every detail of the  body of man is as naught in comparison with His solicitude for  the human soul. The soul of man was created on the first day, for  it is the spirit of God moving upon the face of the waters. Thus,  instead of being the last, man is really the first work of  creation.[17]    This spirit, or, to call it by its usual name, the soul of man,  possesses five different powers. By means of one of them she  escapes from the body every night, rises up to heaven, and  fetches new life thence for man.[18]    With the soul of Adam the souls of all the generations of men  were created. They are stored up in a promptuary, in the seventh  of the heavens, whence they are drawn as they are needed for  human body after human body.[19]    The soul and body of man are united in this way: When a woman has  conceived, the Angel of the Night, Lailah, carries the sperm  before God, and God decrees what manner of human being shall  become of it--whether it shall be male or female, strong or weak,  rich or poor, beautiful or ugly, long or short, fat or thin, and  what all its other qualities shall be. Piety and wickedness alone  are left to the determination of man himself. Then God makes a  sign to the angel appointed over the souls, saying, \"Bring Me the  soul so-and-so, which is hidden in Paradise, whose name is  so-and-so, and whose form is so-and-so.\" The angel brings the  designated soul, and she bows down when she appears in the  presence of God, and prostrates herself before Him. At that  moment, God issues the command, \"Enter this sperm.\" The soul  opens her mouth, and pleads: \"O Lord of the world! I am well  pleased with the world in which I have been living since the day  on which Thou didst call me into being. Why dost Thou now desire  to have me enter this impure sperm, I who am holy and pure, and a  part of Thy glory?\" God consoles her: \"The world which I shall  cause thee to enter is better than the world in which thou hast  lived hitherto, and when I created thee, it was only for this  purpose.\" The soul is then forced to enter the sperm against her  will, and the angel carries her back to the womb of the mother.  Two angels are detailed to watch that she shall not leave it, nor  drop out of it, and a light is set above her, whereby the soul  can see from one end of the world to the other. In the morning an  angel carries her to Paradise, and shows her the righteous, who  sit there in their glory, with crowns upon their heads. The angel  then says to the soul, \"Dost thou know who these are?\" She  replies in the negative, and the angel goes on: \"These whom thou  beholdest here were formed, like unto thee, in the womb of their  mother. When they came into the world, they observed God's Torah  and His commandments. Therefore they became the partakers of this  bliss which thou seest them enjoy. Know, also thou wilt one day  depart from the world below, and if thou wilt observe God's  Torah, then wilt thou be found worthy of sitting with these pious  ones. But if not, thou wilt be doomed to the other place.\"    In the evening, the angel takes the soul to hell, and there  points out the sinners whom the Angels of Destruction are smiting  with fiery scourges, the sinners all the while crying out Woe!  Woe! but no mercy is shown unto them. The angel then questions  the soul as before, \"Dost thou know who these are?\" and as before  the reply is negative. The angel continues: \"These who are  consumed with fire were created like unto thee. When they were  put into the world, they did not observe God's Torah and His  commandments. Therefore have they come to this disgrace which  thou seest them suffer. Know, thy destiny is also to depart from  the world. Be just, therefore, and not wicked, that thou mayest  gain the future world.\"    Between morning and evening the angel carries the soul around,  and shows her where she will live and where she will die, and the  place where she will buried, and he takes her through the whole  world, and points out the just and the sinners and all things. In  the evening, he replaces her in the womb of the mother, and there  she remains for nine months.    When the time arrives for her to emerge from the womb into the  open world, the same angel addresses the soul, \"The time has come  for thee to go abroad into the open world.\" The soul demurs, \"Why  dost thou want to make me go forth into the open world?\" The  angel replies: \"Know that as thou wert formed against thy will,  so now thou wilt be born against thy will, and against thy will  thou shalt die, and against thy will thou shalt give account of  thyself before the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He.\"  But the soul is reluctant to leave her place. Then the angel  fillips the babe on the nose, extinguishes the light at his head,  and brings him forth into the world against his will. Immediately  the child forgets all his soul has seen and learnt, and he comes  into the world crying, for he loses a place of shelter and  security and rest.    When the time arrives for man to quit this world, the same angel  appears and asks him, \"Dost thou recognize me?\" And man replies,  \"Yes; but why dost thou come to me to-day, and thou didst come on  no other day?\" The angel says, \"To take thee away from the world,  for the time of thy departure has arrived.\" Then man falls to  weeping, and his voice penetrates to all ends of the world, yet  no creature hears his voice, except the cock alone. Man  remonstrates with the angel, \"From two worlds thou didst take me,  and into this world thou didst bring me.\" But the angel reminds  him: "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1494"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews — Volume 2 (#11)"],[1,"Zuleika: \"I will push matters so far that all men will  hate thee.\"    Joseph: \"The Lord loveth the righteous.\"    Zuleika: \"I will sell thee into a strange land.\"    Joseph: \"The Lord preserveth the strangers.\"[139]    Then she would resort to enticements in order to obtain  her desire. She would promise to release him from prison,  if he would but grant her wish. But he would say, \"Better  it is to remain here than be with thee and commit a trespass  against God.\" These visits to Joseph in prison Zuleika continued  for a long time, but when, finally, she saw that all  her hopes were vain, she let him alone.[140]    As the mistress persisted in her love for Joseph, so his  master, her husband, could not separate himself from his  favorite slave. Though a prisoner, Joseph continued to  minister to the needs of Potiphar, and he received permission  from the keeper of the prison to spend some of his time  in his master's house.[141] In many other ways the jailer showed  himself kindly disposed toward Joseph. Seeing the youth's  zeal and conscientiousness in executing the tasks laid upon  him, and under the spell of his enchanting beauty, he made  prison life as easy as possible for his charge. He even  ordered better dishes for him than the common prison fare,  and he found it superfluous caution to keep watch over  Joseph, for he could see no wrong in him, and he observed  that God was with him, in good days and in bad.  He even appointed him to be the overseer of the prison,  and as Joseph commanded, so the other prisoners were  obliged to do.[142]    For a long time the people talked of nothing but the  accusation raised against Joseph by his mistress. In  order to divert the attention of the public from him, God  ordained that two high officers, the chief butler and the  chief baker, should offend their lord, the king of Egypt, and  they were put in ward in the house of the captain of the  guard. Now the people ceased their talk about Joseph, and  spoke only of the scandal at court. The charges laid at the  door of the noble prisoners were that they had attempted to  do violence to the daughter of Pharaoh, and they had  conspired to poison the king himself. Besides, they had  shown themselves derelict in their service. In the wine  the chief butler had handed to the king to drink, a fly  had been discovered, and the bread set upon the royal  board by the chief baker contained a little pebble.\"[143] On  account of all these transgressions they were condemned to  death by Pharaoh, but for the sake of Joseph it was ordained  by Divine providence that the king should first detain  them in prison before he ordered their execution. The  Lord had enkindled the wrath of the king against his  servants only that the wish of Joseph for liberty might  be fulfilled, for they were the instruments of his deliverance  from prison, and though they were doomed to death, yet in  consideration of the exalted office they had held at court,  the keeper of the prison accorded them privileges, as, for  instance, a man was detailed to wait upon them, and the one  appointed thereto was Joseph.[144]  1]    The chief butler and the chief baker had been confined  in prison ten years,[145] when they dreamed a dream, both of  them, but as for the interpretation, each dreamed only that  of the other one's dream.[146] In the morning when Joseph  brought them the water for washing, he found them sad,  depressed in spirits, and, in the manner of the sages, he  asked them why they looked different on that day from other  days. They said unto him, \"We have dreamed a dream this  night, and our two dreams resemble each other in certain  particulars, and there is none that can interpret them.\" And  Joseph said unto them: \"God granteth understanding to  man to interpret dreams. Tell them me, I pray you.\"[147] It  was as a reward for ascribing greatness and credit to Him  unto whom it belongeth that Joseph later attained to his  lofty position.[148]    The chief butler proceeded to tell his dream: \"In my  dream, behold, a vine was before me; and in the vine were  three branches; and it was as though it budded, and its blossoms  shot forth, and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe  grapes; and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the  grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave  the cup into Pharaoh's hand.\" The chief butler was not  aware that his dream contained a prophecy regarding the  future of Israel, but Joseph discerned the recondite  meaning,[149]  and he interpreted the dream thus: The three  branches are the three Fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,  whose descendants in Egypt will be redeemed by three  leaders, Moses, Aaron, and Miriam; and the cup given into  the hand of Pharaoh is the cup of wrath that he will have to  drain in the end. This interpretation of the dream Joseph  kept for himself, and he told the chief butler nothing  thereof, but out of gratitude for the glad tidings of the  deliverance of Israel from the bondage of Egypt, he gave  him a favorable interpretation of his dream, and begged  him to have him in his remembrance, when it should be well  with him, and liberate him from the dungeon in which he  was confined.    When the chief baker heard the interpretation of the  butler's dream, he knew that Joseph had divined its meaning  correctly, for in his own he had seen the interpretation of  his friend's dream, and he proceeded to tell Joseph what  he had dreamed in the night: \"I also was in my dream,  and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head;  and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bake-  meats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the  basket upon my head.\" Also this dream conveyed a prophecy  regarding the future of Israel: The three baskets are  the three kingdoms to which Israel will be made subject,  Babylon, Media, and Greece; and the uppermost basket  indicates the wicked rule of Rome, which will extend over  all the nations of the world, until the bird shall come, who is  the Messiah, and annihilate Rome. Again Joseph kept  the prophecy a secret. To the chief baker he gave only the  interpretation that had reference to his person, but it was  unfavorable to him, because through his dream Joseph had  been made acquainted with the suffering Israel would have  to undergo.    And all came to pass, as Joseph had said, on the third  day.[150] The day whereon he explained the meaning of  their dreams to the two distinguished prisoners, a son was  born unto Pharaoh and to celebrate the joyous event, the  king arranged a feast for his princes and servants that was  to last eight days. He invited them and all the people to  his table, and he entertained them with royal splendor. The  feast had its beginning on the third day after the birth of the  child, and on that occasion the chief butler was restored in  honor to his butlership, and the chief baker was hanged,[151]  for Pharaoh's counsellors had discovered that it was not the  butler's fault that the fly had dropped into the king's wine,  but the baker had been guilty of carelessness in allowing the  pebble to get into the bread.[152] Likewise it appeared that  the butler had had no part in the conspiracy to poison the  king, while the baker was revealed as one of the plotters,  and he had to expiate his crime with his life.[153]      PHARAOH'S DREAMS    Properly speaking, Joseph should have gone out free from  his dungeon on the same day as the butler. He had been  there ten years by that time, and had made amends for the  slander he had uttered against his ten brethren. However,  he remained in prison two years longer. \"Blessed is the  man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope is the Lord,\"  but Joseph had put his confidence in flesh and blood. He had  prayed the chief butler to have him in remembrance when  it should be well with him, and make mention of him unto  Pharaoh, and the butler forgot his promise, and therefore  Joseph had to stay in prison two years more than the years  originally allotted to him there.[154] The butler had not  forgotten  him intentionally, but it was ordained of God that  his memory should fail him. When he would say to himself,  If thus and so happens, I will remember the case of Joseph,  the conditions he had imagined were sure to be reversed, or  if he made a knot as a reminder, an angel came and undid  the knot, and Joseph did not enter his mind.[155]    But \"the Lord setteth an end to darkness,\" and Joseph's  liberation was not delayed by a single moment beyond the  time decreed for it. God said, \"Thou, O butler, thou didst  forget Joseph, but I did not,\" and He caused Pharaoh to  dream a dream that was the occasion for Joseph's release.[156]    In his dream Pharaoh saw seven kine, well-favored and  fat-fleshed, come up out of the Nile, and they all together  grazed peaceably on the brink of the river, In years when  the harvest is abundant, friendship reigns among men, and  love and brotherly harmony, and these seven fat kine stood  for seven such prosperous years. After the fat kine, seven  more came up out of the river, ill-favored and lean-  fleshed, and each had her back turned to the others, for  when distress prevails, one man turns away from the other.  For a brief space Pharaoh awoke, and when he went to sleep  again, he dreamed a second dream, about seven rank and  good ears of corn, and seven ears that were thin and blasted  with the east wind,[157] the withered cars swallowing the full  ears. He awoke at once, and it was morning, and dreams  dreamed in the morning are the ones that come true.[158]    This was not the first time Pharaoh had had these dreams.  They had visited him every night during a period of two  years, and he had forgotten them invariably in the morning.  This was the first time he remembered them, for the  day had arrived for Joseph to come forth from his prison  house.[159] Pharaoh's heart beat violently when he called  his dreams to"]]]
