(#11)"],[1,"  revolutions which often took place in those governments; hence the  frequent victories obtained without a blow by one faction over the  other; and hence it happened, that the seeming prevalence of a party was  seldom a prognostic of its long continuance in power and authority.    {1262.} The king, as soon as he received the pope's absolution from his  oath, accompanied with menaces of excommunication against all opponents,  trusting to the countenance of the church, to the support promised him  by many considerable barons, and to the returning favor of the people,  immediately took off the mask. After justifying his conduct by a  proclamation, in which he set forth the private ambition and the breach  of trust conspicuous in Leicester and his associates, be declared that  he had resumed the government, and was determined thenceforth to exert  the royal authority for the protection of his subjects.         * M. Paris. D. 667.    He removed Hugh le Despenser and Nicholas de Ely, the justiciary and  chancellor appointed by the barons; and put Philip Basset and Walter de  Merton in their place. He substituted new sheriffs in all the counties,  men of character and honor; he placed new governors in most of the  castles; he changed all the officers of his household; he summoned a  parliament, in which the resumption of his authority was ratified, with  only five dissenting voices; and the barons, after making one fruitless  effort to take the king by surprise at Winchester, were obliged to  acquiesce in those new regulations.[*]    The king, in order to cut off every objection to his conduct, offered  to refer all the differences between him and the earl of Leicester to  Margaret, queen of France.[**] The celebrated integrity of Lewis gave a  mighty influence to any decision which issued from his court; and Henry  probably hoped, that the gallantry on which all barons, as true knights,  valued themselves, would make them ashamed not to submit to the award  of that princess. Lewis merited the confidence reposed in him. By  an admirable conduct, probably as political as just, he continually  interposed his good offices to allay the civil discords ol the English:  he forwarded all healing measures which might give security to  both parties: and he still endeavored, though in vain, to soothe by  persuasion the fierce ambition of the earl of Leicester, and to convince  him how much it was his duty to submit peaceably to the authority of his  sovereign.         * M. Paris, p. 668. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 55.         ** Rymer, vol. i. p. 724.    {1263.} That bold and artful conspirator was nowise discouraged by  the bad success of his past enterprises. The death of Richard, earl  of Glocester, who was his chief rival in power, and who, before his  decease, had joined the royal party seemed to open a new field to his  violence, and to expose the throne to fresh insults and injuries. It was  in vain that the king professed his intentions of observing strictly  the great charter, even of maintaining all the regulations made by the  reforming barons at Oxford or afterwards, except those with entirely  annihilated the royal authority; these powerful chieftains, now  obnoxious to the court, could not peaceably resign the hopes of entire  independence and uncontrolled power with which they had flattered  themselves, and which they had so long enjoyed. Many of them engaged  in Leicester's views, and among the rest, Gilbert, the young earl  of Glocester, who brought him a mighty accession of power, from the  extensive authority possessed by that opulent family. Even Henry, son  of the king of the Romans, commonly called Henry d'Allmaine, though a  prince of the blood, joined the party of the barons against the king,  the head of his own family Leicester himself, who still resided in  France, secretly formed the links of this great conspiracy, and planned  the whole scheme of operations.    The princes of Wales, notwithstanding the great power of the monarchs  both of the Saxon and Norman line, still preserved authority in their  own country. Though they had often been constrained to pay tribute  to the crown of England, they were with difficulty retained in  subordination or even in peace; and almost through every reign since  the conquest, they had infested the English frontiers with such petty  incursions and sudden inroads, as seldom merit to have place in a  general history. The English, still content with repelling their  invasions, and chasing them back into their mountains, had never pursued  the advantages obtained over them, nor been able, even under their  greatest and most active princes, to fix a total, or so much as a feudal  subjection on the country. This advantage was reserved to the present  king, the weakest and most indolent. In the year 1237, Lewellyn, prince  of Wales, declining in years and broken with infirmities, but still more  harassed with the rebellion and undutiful behavior of his youngest son  Griffin, had recourse to the protection of Henry; and consenting  to subject his principality, which had so long maintained, or soon  recovered, its independence to vassalage under the crown of England,  had purchased security and tranquillity on these dishonorable terms. His  eldest son and heir, David, renewed the homage to England; and having  taken his brother prisoner, delivered him into Henry's hands, who  committed him to custody in the Tower. That prince, endeavoring to make  his escape, lost his life in the attempt; and the prince of Wales, freed  from the apprehensions of so dangerous a rival, paid thenceforth less  regard to the English monarch, and even renewed those incursions by  which the Welsh, during so many ages, had been accustomed to infest the  English borders. Lewellyn, however, the foil of Griffin, who succeeded  to his uncle, had been obliged to renew the homage which was now claimed  by England as an established right; but he was well pleased to inflame  those civil discords, on which he rested his present security and  founded his hopes of future independence. He entered into a confederacy  with the earl of Leicester, and collecting all the force of his  principality, invaded England with an army of thirty thousand men.  He ravaged the lands of Roger de Mortimer, and of all the barons who  adhered to the crown;[*] he marched into Cheshire, and committed like  depredations on Prince Edward's territories; every place where his  disorderly troops appeared was laid waste with fire and sword; and  though Mortimer, a gallant and expert soldier, made stout resistance, it  was found necessary that the prince himself should head the army against  this invader. Edward repulsed Prince Lewellyn, and obliged him to take  shelter in the mountains of North Wales: but he was prevented from  making further progress against the enemy by the disorders which soon  after broke out in England.    The Welsh invasion was the appointed signal for the malecontent barons  to rise in arms; and Leicester, coming over secretly from France,  collected all the forces of his party, and commenced an open rebellion.  He seized the person of the bishop of Hereford, a prelate obnoxious to  all the inferior clergy, on account of his devoted attachment to the  court of Rome.[**] Simon, bishop of Norwich, and John Mansel, because  they had published the pope's bull, absolving the king and kingdom from  their oaths to observe the provisions of Oxford, were made prisoners,  and exposed to the rage of the party. The king's demesnes were ravaged  with unbounded fury,[***] and as it was Leicester's interest to allure  to his side, by the hopes of plunder, all the disorderly ruffians in  England he gave them a general license to pillage the barons of the  opposite party, and even all neutral persons.         * Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 354.         ** Trivet, p. 211. M. West. p. 382, 392.         *** Trivet, p. 211. M. West. p. 382.    But one of the principal resources of his faction was the populace of  the cities, particularly of London; and as he had, by his hypocritical  pretensions to sanctity, and his zeal against Rome, engaged the monks  and lower ecclesiastics in his party, his dominion over the inferior  ranks of men became uncontrollable. Thomas Fitz-Richard, mayor of  London, a furious and licentious man, gave the countenance of authority  to these disorders in the capital; and having declared war against the  substantial citizens, he loosened all the bands of government, by which  that turbulent city was commonly but ill restrained. On the approach of  Easter, the zeal of superstition, the appetite for plunder, or what is  often as prevalent with the populace as either of these motives, the  pleasure of committing havoc and destruction, prompted them to attack  the unhappy Jews, who were first pillaged without resistance, then  massacred, to the number of five hundred persons.[*] The Lombard bankers  were next exposed to the rage of the people; and though, by taking  sanctuary in the churches, they escaped with their lives, all their  money and goods became a prey to the licentious multitude. Even the  houses of the rich citizens, though English, were attacked by night;  and way was made by sword and by fire to the pillage of their goods,  and often to the destruction of their persons. The queen, who, though  defended by the Tower, was terrified by the neighborhood of such  dangerous commotions, resolved to go by water to the Castle of Windsor;  but as she approached the bridge, the populace assembled against her:  the cry ran, \"Drown the witch;\" and besides abusing her with the most  opprobrious language, and pelting her with rotten eggs and dirt, they  had prepared large stones to sink her barge, when she should attempt to  shoot the bridge; and she was so frightened, that she returned to the  Tower[**]    The violence and fury of Leicester's faction had risen to such a height  in all parts of England, that the king,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19213"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part C. (#11)"],[1,"steadily, in counterworking the projects of his  enemies. His first object was to ascertain the death of the real duke of  York, and to confirm the opinion that had always prevailed with regard  to that event. Five persons had been employed by Richard in the murder  of his nephews, or could give evidence with regard to it; Sir James  Tyrrel, to whom he had committed the government of the Tower for that  purpose, and who had seen the dead princes; Forrest, Dighton, and  Slater, who perpetrated the crime; and the priest who buried the bodies.  Tyrrel and Dighton alone were alive, and they agreed in the same story;  but as the priest was dead, and as the bodies were supposed to have  been removed by Richard's orders from the place where they were first  interred, and could not now be found, it was not in Henry's power to put  the fact, so much as he wished, beyond all doubt and controversy.    He met at first with more difficulty, but was in the end more  successful, in detecting who this wonderful person was that thus boldly  advanced pretensions to his crown. He dispersed his spies all over  Flanders and England; he engaged many to pretend that they had embraced  Perkin's party; he directed them to insinuate themselves into the  confidence of the young man's friends; in proportion as they conveyed  intelligence of any conspirator, he bribed his retainers, his domestic  servants, nay, sometimes his confessor, and by these means traced up  some other confederate; Clifford himself he engaged, by the hope of  rewards and pardon, to betray the secrets committed to him; the more  trust he gave to any of his spies, the higher resentment did he feign  against them, some of them he even caused to be publicly anathematized,  in order the better to procure them the confidence of his enemies: and  in the issue, the whole plan of the conspiracy was clearly laid before  him; and the pedigree, adventures, life, and conversation of the  pretended duke of York. This latter part of the story was immediately  published for the satisfaction of the nation: the conspirators he  reserved for a slower and surer vengeance.    {1494.} Meanwhile he remonstrated with the archduke Philip, on account  of the countenance and protection which was afforded in his dominions  to so infamous an impostor; contrary to treaties subsisting between the  sovereigns, and to the mutual amity which had so long been maintained  by the subjects of both states. Margaret had interest enough to get his  application rejected; on pretence that Philip had no authority over the  demesnes of the duchess dowager. And the king, in resentment of this  injury, cut off all commerce with the Low Countries, banished the  Flemings, and recalled his own subjects from these provinces. Philip  retaliated by like edicts; but Henry knew, that so mutinous a people as  the Flemings would not long bear, in compliance with the humors of their  prince, to be deprived of the beneficial branch of commerce which they  carried on with England.    He had it in his power to inflict more effectual punishment on his  domestic enemies; and when his projects were sufficiently matured, he  failed not to make them feel the effects of his resentment. Almost  in the same instant he arrested Fitzwater, Mountfort, and Thwaites,  together with William Daubeney, Robert Rateliff, Thomas Cressenor, and  Thomas Astwood. All these were arraigned, convicted, and condemned  for high treason, in adhering and promising aid to Perkin. Mountfort,  Ratcliff, and Daubeney were immediately executed: Fitzwater was  sent over to Calais, and detained in custody; but being detected in  practising on his keeper for an escape, he soon after underwent the same  fate. The rest were pardoned, together with William Worseley, dean of  St. Paul's, and some others, who had been accused and examined, but not  brought to public trial.[*]         * Polyd. Virg. p. 592.    Greater and more solemn preparations were deemed requisite for the  trial of Stanley, lord chamberlain, whose authority in the nation, whose  domestic connections with the king, as well as his former services,  seemed to secure him against any accusation or punishment. Clifford was  directed to come over privately to England, and to throw himself at the  king's feet while he sat in council; craving pardon for past offences  and offering to atone for them by any services which should be required  of him. Henry then told him, that the best proof he could give of  penitence, and the only service he could now render him, was the full  confession of his guilt, and the discovery of all his accomplices,  however distinguished by rank or character. Encouraged by this  exhortation, Clifford accused Stanley, then present, as his chief  abettor; and offered to lay before the council the full proof of  his guilt. Stanley himself could not discover more surprise than was  affected by Henry on the occasion. He received the intelligence as  absolutely false and incredible; that a man, to whom he was in a great  measure beholden for his crown, and even for his life; a man, to, whom,  by every honor and favor, he had endeavored to express his gratitude;  whose brother, the earl of Derby, was his own father-in-law; to whom  he had even committed the trust of his person, by creating him lord  chamberlain: that this man, enjoying his full confidence and affection,  not actuated by any motive of discontent or apprehension, should engage  in a conspiracy against him. Clifford was therefore exhorted to weigh  well the consequences of his accusation; but as he persisted in the same  positive asseverations, Stanley was committed to custody, and was soon  after examined before the council.[*] He denied not the guilt imputed to  him by Clifford; he did not even endeavor much to extenuate it; whether  he thought that a frank and open confession would serve as an atonement,  or trusted to his present connections and his former services for pardon  and security. But princes are often apt to regard great services as  a ground of jealousy, especially if accompanied with a craving and  restless disposition in the person who has performed them. The general  discontent also, and mutinous humor of the people, seemed to require  some great example of severity. And as Stanley was one of the most  opulent subjects in the kingdom, being possessed of above three thousand  pounds a year in land, and forty thousand marks in plate and money,  besides other property of great value, the prospect of so rich a  forfeiture was deemed no small motive for Henry's proceeding to  extremities against him.         * Bacon, p. 611 Polyd. Virg. p. 593.    {1495.} After six weeks' delay, which was interposed in order to show  that the king was restrained by doubts and scruples, the prisoner  was brought to his trial, condemned, and presently after beheaded.  Historians are not agreed with regard to the crime which was proved  against him. The general report is, that he should have said in  confidence to Clifford, that if he were sure the young man who appeared  in Flanders was really son to King Edward, he never would bear arms  against him. The sentiment might disgust Henry, as implying a preference  of the house of York to that of Lancaster; but could scarcely be the  ground, even in those arbitrary times, of a sentence of high treason  against Stanley. It is more probable, therefore, as is asserted by some  historians, that he had expressly engaged to assist Perkin, and had  actually sent him some supply of money.    The fate of Stanley made great impression on the kingdom, and struck  all the partisans of Perkin with the deepest dismay. From Clifford's  desertion, they found that all their secrets were betrayed; and as  it appeared that Stanley, while he seemed to live in the greatest  confidence with the king, had been continually surrounded by spies, who  reported and registered every action in which he was engaged, nay, every  word which fell from him, a general distrust took place, and all mutual  confidence was destroyed, even among intimate friends and acquaintance.  The jealous and severe temper of the king, together with his great  reputation for sagacity and penetration, kept men in awe, and quelled  not only the movements of sedition, but the very murmurs of faction.  Libels, however, crept out against Henry's person and administration;  and being greedily propagated by every secret art, showed that there  still remained among the people a considerable root of discontent, which  wanted only a proper opportunity to discover itself.    But Henry continued more intent on increasing the terrors of his people,  than on gaining their affections. Trusting to the great success which  attended him in all his enterprises, he gave every day more and more a  loose to his rapacious temper, and employed the arts of perverted law  and justice, in order to exact fines and compositions from his people.  Sir William Capel, alderman of London, was condemned on some penal  statutes to pay the sum of two thousand seven hundred and forty-three  pounds, and was obliged to compound for sixteen hundred and fifteen.  This was the first noted case of the kind; but it became a precedent,  which prepared the may for many others. The management, indeed, of these  arts of chicanery, was the great secret of the king's administration.  While he depressed the nobility, he exalted, and honored, and caressed  the lawyers; and by that means both bestowed authority on the laws, and  was enabled, whenever he pleased, to pervert them to his own advantage.  His government was oppressive; but it was so much the less burdensome,  as, by his extending royal authority, and curbing the nobles, he became  in reality the sole oppressor in his kingdom.    As Perkin found that the king's authority daily gained ground among the  people, and that his own pretensions were becoming obsolete, he resolved  to attempt something which might revive the hopes "]]]
