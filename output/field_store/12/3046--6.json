[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14990"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement No. 819, September 12, 1891 (#11)"],[1,"excavation of the Viking ship in 1881 disclosed the remains  of a horse which was shod. The shoeing consisted only of a toe  protection--\"Brodder\" (Bruder, Brother)--provided with a small sharp  calk, and fastened by two nails.    When later, in the year 1130, the Norwegian king Sigard Yorsalafar,  during his journey to Jerusalem, entered Constantinople, his horse is  said to have carried only the small toe-protecting shoes.    The art of horseshoeing, immediately after the migration of the  nations, came near our improvement of the same to-day; especially near  the reputed discoveries met with, which consist simply of iron  protection for the margin of the hoof, fastened by nails. The heads  were sunk into the shoe so as to increase its firmness. Special  consideration was given to local and climatic conditions through the  introduction of toes and heels.    The mechanism of the hoof also found remarkable consideration,  inasmuch as they apparently avoided driving nails too close to the  heel end of the shoe. Notwithstanding this early improvement in the  art of horseshoeing, the Huns (as stated before) took a prominent  part. It appears to have taken a long time after the migration of the  nations for shoeing to become general, as is shown by various  descriptions of tournaments, pictures of horses, etc.    [Illustration: FIG. 18.]    We will mention in the first place the \"Percival des Wolfram von  Eschenbach,\" as well as \"Christ von Troies,\" where there is a great  deal said about horses, horse grooms, and tournaments, but nowhere in  those works is any mention made of horseshoeing. Likewise is found the  horse on the coat of arms of Wolfram von Eschenbach, in the Manessi  collection in Paris, which was begun in Switzerland in the fourteenth  century; but, although we find this horse most beautifully finished,  it was not shod.    [Illustration: FIG. 19.]    During the time of the crusades, 1096-1291, however, there appeared  suddenly in Germany a plate-like horseshoe of southern character  (Figs. 18 and 19), which was occasionally bent upward at the heel end,  and was very heavy. The toe was very broad sometimes, and was also  bent upward. In this form we have seen the shoes of the Balkan and  Pyrean peninsula. The shoe was remarkably narrow at the heel, and was  supplied with calks, which accounts for the highness of the back part  of the shoe. Frequently we find one calk set diagonally, but the other  drawn out wedge shaped, and sharp; so that there existed a great  similarity between this iron shank and that used by Count Einsiedel  for winter shoeing. Sometimes both shanks were sharpened in this way,  or were provided with blade-shaped calks well set forward. The form of  nail holes used was very characteristic of that of the Huns, but they  were decidedly smaller and square, as were seen in the African shoe of  the twelfth century. The nail heads were slightly sunk, which was  according to southern customs.    That this shoe really belongs to the period of the crusades is proved  by the numerous horse pictures which have been preserved from that  time; of which we will mention the manuscript of Heinrich von Veldecka  (\"Eneidt\")[4] in the year 1180, which belongs to the most valuable  parts of German history of art.       [Footnote 4: \"Wanderungen des Aeneas\" (Travels of Aeneas).]    This south European Hunish horseshoe had remained the standard form  during the middle ages and until the thirty years war, at least in  South Germany. The shoe was continually improved, and reached its  highest point of perfection about the time of the \"Bauern-krieg\"  (Revolution of the Peasants), at a time when, under the leadership of  the Renaissance, the whole art of mechanics, and especially that of  blacksmithing, had taken an extraordinarily great stride (Figs. 20 and  21).    [Illustration: FIG. 20.]    [Illustration: FIG. 21.]    The shoe (Figs. 22 and 23) is found in Franconia, in all places where,  in the sixteenth century, battles had been fought with the rebellious  peasants. We may, therefore, be justified in fixing its origin mainly  from that period, for which also speaks its high perfection of form.  We find here still the bent-up heel and toe (the latter broad and  thin) of the south European form.    The staved rim of the Spanish Arabic Turkomanic shoe is observed to be  undergoing a change to that of a groove. The broad surface of the shoe  evidently led to the beveling of the same, so as to lessen sole  pressure. The size of the nail holes remains still like that of the  Huns; but the unsunk southern nail heads yet serve to improve the hold  on the ground. The calks were next placed forward, perhaps from an  uncultivated sense of beauty, or from the high bending up of the hind  part of the shoe, which would necessitate a high and heavy unsightly  calk.    From this time on horseshoeing in south Germany fell back very  quickly, and loses all scientific holds of support after the thirty  years war. In the mean time toe protection in the form of a calk had  spread from the colder north over southern Germany; whereas this north  German invention did not find favor in England in consequence of her  mild oceanic climate.    [Illustration: FIG. 22]    Also, the calks in England, as well as in the southern countries, on  the same ground, therefore, with good reason, could at no time be  adopted. This did, however, not interfere with the use of the calk in  the colder south Germany, where after a use of nearly 1,500 years it  has maintained its local and climatic adaptation. Notwithstanding the  occasional aping by foreigners, it has remained victorious in its  original form, and has been chosen in many countries.    The historical development of the horseshoe in general, from about the  time of Emperor Maximilian until the seven years war, furnishes a true  picture of the confused condition of things at that period of time,  which, to make intelligible, would require a separate and complete  treatise. Interesting as it is to the scientist to follow up this  development and mode of present German horseshoeing, which, aside from  the national toe and calk, is the English form and has become  influential, and with full right, for a periodical of this kind  further, more comprehensive, statement would under all circumstances  take up too much room; therefore I must drop the pen, although  reluctantly.    [Illustration: FIG. 23.]           *       *       *       *       *          SHEET GLASS FROM MOLTEN METAL.      The present practice in making metal sheets is to cast ingots or slabs  and then reduce these by repeated rollings and reheating. Attempts  have been previously made to produce sheets directly from molten metal  by pouring the metal: (1) between two revolving rollers; or (2)  between a revolving wheel and the surface of an inclosing fixed  semicircular segment. By these means none but very thin plates could  be satisfactorily produced. In this invention by C.M. Pielsticker,  London, the machinery consists of a large receiving roller of 5 ft.  diameter more or less, and of a length equal to that of the plate to  be produced. With this are combined small forming rollers arranged in  succession part way round the periphery of the large roller, and  revolving at the same rate as the large roller. The rollers can be  cooled by a current of water circulating through them. The molten  metal flows on to the surface of the large roller and is prevented  from escaping sideways by flanges with which the large roller is  provided. These flanges embrace the small rollers and are of a depth  greater than that of the thickest plate which it is proposed to roll.  The distance between the large roller and the small rollers can be  adjusted according to the desired thickness of the plate. When dealing  with metals of high melting point, such as steel, the first small  roller is made of refractory material and is heated from inside by the  flame of a blow pipe. The rollers are coated with plumbago or other  material to prevent adhesion to the molten metal. In the case of  metals of high melting point the machine is fed direct from a furnace  divided into two compartments by a wall or bridge in which is a  stopper which can be operated so as to regulate the flow of metal.  When applied to forming sheets of glass, the rollers should be warmed  by a blow pipe flame as above described, and the sheet of glass  stretched and annealed as it leaves the last roller.           *       *       *       *       *          WELDLESS STEEL CHAINS.      At the Royal Naval Exhibition, London, Messrs. William Reid & Co. are  exhibiting their weldless steel chains, which we now illustrate.    Of the many advantages claimed for steel chains, it may be prominently  noted that a very important saving of weight is effected on account of  their possessing such a high breaking strain, compared with the  ordinary welded iron chains. To illustrate this, it may be stated that  a given length of the weldless steel chain is 35 to 40 per cent. less  in weight than an equivalent length of iron chain, will stand the same  breaking strain as the latter, and indeed, where steel of special  quality is used in making the weldless chains, this difference can be  increased as much as 70 to 80 per cent. Whereas superior iron chains  break at a strain at 17 tons per square inch, these weldless steel  chains will stand a strain of 28 to 30 tons, with 20 to 26 per cent.  elongation.    [Illustration: Figures 1. Through 9., 1_a_, 1_b_ and 3_a_                 MANUFACTURE OF WELDLESS CHAINS.]    Again, there is greater security in their use from the fact that there  are no welds, and they give warning of the limit of strain to which  they can bear being approached, by elongation, which can be carried to  a considerable extent before the chain breaks. Moreover, over, in  chains made by this process, the links are all exactly alike. Though  the life of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14992"],[0,"The Life of Froude (#11)"],[1,"own father, the Earl of Wiltshire, her uncle, the Duke  of Norfolk, the hero of Flodden Field, the Privy Council, the House  of Lords, the Archbishop and Bishopsm, the House of Commons, the  Grand Jury of Middlesex, and three other juries, assented without,  as far as we know, an opposing voice, to the proofs of her guilt,  and approved of the execution of the sentence against her.\"    Froude was not, however, so much absorbed in the work of his life  that he could not form and express strong opinions upon the great  events passing around him. His view of the Russian war and of the  French alliance was set forth with much plainness of speech in a  letter to Max Muller:*    \"I felt in the autumn (and you were angry at me for saying so) that  the very worst thing which could happen for Europe would be the  success of the policy with which France and England were managing  things. Happily the gods were against it too, as now, after having  between us wasted sixty millions of money and fifty thousand human  lives, we are beginning to discover. But I have no hope that things  will go right, or that men will think reasonably, until they have  first exhausted every mode of human folly. I still think Louis  Napoleon the d--d'est rascal in Europe (for which again you will be  angry with me), and that his reception the other day in London will  hereafter appear in history as simply the most shameful episode in  the English annals. Thinking this, you will not consider my opinion  good for anything, and therefore I need not inflict it upon you.  Humbugs, however, will explode in the present state of the  atmosphere, and the Austrian humbug, for instance, is at last, God  be praised for it, exploding. John Bull, I suppose, will work  himself into a fine fever about that; but he will think none the  worse of the old ladies in Downing Street who are made fools of: and  will be none the better disposed to listen to people who told him  all along how it would be. However, in the penal fatuity which has  taken possession of our big bow-wow people, and in even the general  folly, I see great ground for comfort to quiet people like myself;  and if I live fifteen years, I still hope I shall see a Republic  among us.\"    --  * April 30th, 1855.  --    Froude's Republicanism did not last. His opinion of Louis Napoleon  never altered.      CHAPTER IV    THE HISTORY    \"It has not yet become superfluous to insist,\" said the Regius  Professor of Modern History in the University of Cambridge on the  26th of January, 1903, \"that history is a science, no less and no  more.\" If this view is correct and exhaustive, Froude was no  historian. He must remain outside the pale in the company of  Thucydides, Tacitus, Gibbon, Macaulay, and Mommsen. Among literary  historians, the special detestation of the pseudo-scientific school,  Froude was pre-eminent. Few things excite more suspicion than a good  style, and no theory is more plausible than that which associates  clearness of expression with shallowness of thought. Froude,  however, was no fine writer, no coiner of phrases for phrases' sake.  A mere chronicler of events he would hardly have cared to be. He had  a doctrine to propound, a gospel to preach. \"The Reformation,\" he  said, \"was the hinge on which all modern history turned,\"* and he  regarded the Reformation as a revolt of the laity against the  clergy, rather than a contest between two sets of rival dogmas for  supremacy over the human mind. That is the key of the historical  position which he took up from the first, and always defended. He  held the Church of Rome to have been the enemy of human freedom, and  of British independence. He was devoid of theological prejudice, and  never reviled Catholicism as Newman reviled it before his  conversion. But he held that the reformers, alike in England, in  France, and in Germany, were fighting for truth, honesty, and  private judgment against priestcraft and ecclesiastical tyranny. The  scepticism and cynicism of which he was often accused were on the  surface. They were provoked by what he felt to be hypocrisy and  sham. They were not his true self. He believed firmly unflinchingly,  and always in \"the grand, simple landmarks of morality,\" which  existed before all Churches, and would exist if all Churches  disappeared.    Ou gar tanun ge kachthes, all' aei pote  Ze tauta, koudeis oiden ex hotou phane    [\"For they are not of today or yesterday, but these things  live for ever, but no one knows from whence they appear.\"  Sophocles, Antigone, 456.]    Before Abraham was they were, and it is impossible to imagine a  time when they will have ceased to be.    --  * Lectures on the Council of Trent, p. 1.  --      Froude was an Erastian, holding that the Church should be  subordinate to the State. True religion is incompatible with  persecution. But true religion is rare, and the best modern security  against the persecutor is the secular power. Mr. Spurgeon once  excited great applause from members of his Church by declaring that  the Baptists had never persecuted. When the cheers had subsided he  explained that it was because they had never had a chance. Froude  was convinced that ecclesiastics could not be trusted, and that they  would oppress the laity unless the laity muzzled them. He held that  the reformers had been calumniated, that their services were in  danger of being forgotten, and that the modern attempt to ignore the  Reformation was not only unhistorical, but disingenuous. He wrote  partly to rehabilitate them, and partly to prove that Henry VIII.  had conferred great benefits upon England by his repudiation of  Papal authority. He took, as he considered it his duty to take, the  side of individual liberty against ecclesiastical authority, and of  England against Rome. The idea that an historian was to have no  opinions of his own, or that, having them, he was to conceal them,  never entered his mind.    That Froude had any prejudice against the Church of England as such  is a baseless fancy. He believed in the Church of his childhood,  and, unless the word be used in the narrow sense of the clerical  profession, he never left it to the end of his days. It was to him,  as it was to his father, a Protestant Church, out of communion with  Rome, cut off from the Pope and his court by the great upheaval of  the sixteenth century. It is unreasonable, and indeed foolish, to  say that that opinion disqualified him to be the historian of Henry  VIII., and Mary Tudor, and Elizabeth. The Catholicism of Lingard is  not considered to be a disqualification by sensible Protestants.  Froude's faults as an historian were of a different kind, and had  nothing to do with his ecclesiastical views. He was not the only  Erastian, nor was he an Erastian pure and simple. He has left it on  record that Macaulay's unfairness to Cranmer in the celebrated  review of Hallam's Constitutional History first suggested to him the  project of his own book. His besetting sin was not so much  Erastianism, or secularism, as a love of paradox. Henry VIII seemed  to him not merely a great statesman and a true patriot, but a victim  of persistent misrepresentation, whose lofty motives had been  concealed, and displaced by vile, baseless calumnies. More and  Fisher, honoured for three centuries as saints, he suspected, and,  as he thought, discovered to have been traitors who justly expiated  their offences on the block. He was not satisfied with proving that  there was a case for Henry, and that the triumph of Rome would have  been the end of civil as well as spiritual freedom: he must go on to  whitewash the tyrant himself, and to prove that his marriage with  Anne Boleyn, like his separation from Katharine of Aragon, was  simply the result of an unselfish desire to provide the country with  a male heir. The refusal of More and Fisher to acknowledge the royal  supremacy may show that they were Catholics first and Englishmen  afterwards, without impugning their personal integrity, or  justifying the malice of Thomas Cromwell. To judge Henry as if he  were a constitutional king with a secure title, in no more danger  from Catholics than Louis XIV was from Huguenots, is doubtless  preposterous. If the Catholics had got the upper hand, they would  have deposed him, and put him to death. In that fell strife of  mighty opposites the voice of toleration was not raised, and would  not have been heard. Tyrant as he was himself, Henry in his battle  against Rome did represent the English people, and his cause was  theirs. Froude brought out this great truth, and to bring it out was  a great service. Unfortunately he went too far the other way, and  impartial readers who had no sympathy with Cardinal Campeggio were  revolted by what looked like a defence of cruel persecution. The  welfare of a nation is more important in history than the observance  of any marriage; and if Henry had been guided by mere desire, there  was no reason why he should marry Anne Boleyn at all. Froude's  achievement, which, despite all criticism, remains, was marred or  modified by his too obvious zeal for upsetting established  conclusions and reversing settled beliefs.    The moment that Froude had made up his mind, which was not till  after long and careful research, he began to paint a picture. The  lights were delicately and adroitly arranged. The artist's eye set  all accessories in the most telling positions. He was an advocate,  an incomparably brilliant advocate, in his mode of presenting a  case. But it was his own case, the case in which he believed, not a  case he had been retained to defend. When he came to deal with  Elizabeth he was on firmer ground. By that time the Reformation was  an accomplished fact, and the fiercest controversies lay behind him.  Disgusted as he was with the scandals invented against the virgin  queen, he did not shrink from exposing the duplicity and meanness  which tarnish the lustre of her imperishable"]]]
