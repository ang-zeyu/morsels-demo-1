It happened that some of these wagons were  under Count Sidroc's charge, and were in the rear of the line of  march. In passing a ford, the wheels of one of these rear wagons sank  in the muddy bottom, and the horses, in attempting to draw the wagon  out, became entangled and restive. While Sidroc's whole attention  was engrossed by this difficulty, Turgar contrived to steal away  unobserved. He hid himself in a neighboring wood, and, with a degree  of sagacity and discretion remarkable in a boy of his years, he  contrived to find his way back to the smoking ruins of his home at the  Abbey of Crowland.    The monks who had gone away to seek concealment at the cell of the  anchorite had returned, and were at work among the smoking ruins,  saving what they could from the fire, and gathering together the  blackened remains of their brethren for interment. They chose one of  the monks that had escaped to succeed the abbot who had been murdered,  repaired, so far as they could, their ruined edifices, and mournfully  resumed their functions as a religious community.    Many of the tales which the ancient chroniclers tell of those times  are romantic and incredible; they may have arisen, perhaps, in the  first instance, in exaggerations of incidents and events which really  occurred, and were then handed down from generation to generation by  oral tradition, till they found historians to record them. The story  of the martyrdom of King Edmund is of this character. Edmund was a  sort of king over one of the nations of Anglo-Saxons called East  Angles, who, as their name imports, occupied a part of the eastern  portion of the island. Their particular hostility to Edmund was  awakened, according to the story, in the following manner:    There was a certain bold and adventurous Dane named Lothbroc, who one  day took his falcon on his arm and went out alone in a boat on the  Baltic Sea, or in the straits connecting it with the German Ocean,  intending to go to a certain island and hunt. The falcon is a species  of hawk which they were accustomed to train in those days, to attack  and bring down birds from the air, and falconry was, as might have  been expected, a very picturesque and exciting species of hunting. The  game which Lothbroc was going to seek consisted of the wild fowl which  frequents sometimes, in vast numbers, the cliffs and shores of the  islands in those seas. Before he reached his hunting ground, however,  he was overtaken by a storm, and his boat was driven by it out to sea.  Accustomed to all sorts of adventures and dangers by sea and by land,  and skilled in every operation required in all possible emergencies,  Lothbroc contrived to keep his boat before the wind, and to bail out  the water as fast as it came in, until at length, after being driven  entirely across the German Ocean, he was thrown upon the English  shore, where, with his hawk still upon his arm, he safely landed.    [Illustration: LOTHBROC AND HIS FALCON.]    He knew that he was in the country of the most deadly foes of his  nation and race, and accordingly sought to conceal rather than to make  known his arrival. He was, however, found, after a few days, wandering  up and down in a solitary wood, and was conducted, together with his  hawk, to King Edmund.    Edmund was so much pleased with his air and bearing, and so astonished  at the remarkable manner in which he had been brought to the English  shore, that he gave him his life; and soon discovering his great  knowledge and skill as a huntsman, he received him into his own  service, and treated him with great distinction and honor. In addition  to his hawk, Lothbroc had a greyhound, so that he could hunt with the  king in the fields as well as through the air. The greyhound was very  strongly attached to his master.    The king's chief huntsman at this time was Beorn, and Beorn soon  became very envious and jealous of Lothbroc, on account of his  superior power and skill, and of the honorable distinction which they  procured for him. One day, when they two were hunting alone in the  woods with their dogs, Beorn killed his rival, and hid his body in  a thicket. Beorn went home, his own dogs following him, while the  greyhound remained to watch mournfully over the body of his master.  They asked Beorn what was become of Lothbroc, and he replied that he  had gone off into the wood the day before, and he did not know what  had become of him.    In the mean time, the greyhound remained faithfully watching at the  side of the body of his master until hunger compelled him to leave his  post in search of food. He went home, and, as soon as his wants were  supplied, he returned immediately to the wood again. This he did  several days; and at length his singular conduct attracting attention,  he was followed by some of the king's household, and the body of his  murdered master was found.    The guilt of the murder was with little difficulty brought home  to Beorn; and, as an appropriate punishment for his cruelty to an  unfortunate and homeless stranger, the king condemned him to be put  on board the same boat in which the ill-fated Lothbroc had made his  perilous voyage, and pushed out to sea.    The winds and storms--entering, it seems, into the plan, and  influenced by the same principles of poetical justice as had governed  the king--drove the boat, with its terrified mariner, back again  across to the mouth of the Baltic, as they had brought Lothbroc to  England. The boat was thrown upon the beach, on Lothbroc's family  domain.    Now Lothbroc had been, in his own country, a man of high rank and  influence. He was of royal descent, and had many friends. He had  two sons, men of enterprise and energy; and it so happened that the  landing of Beorn took place so near to them, that the tidings soon  came to their ears that their father's boat, in the hands of a Saxon  stranger, had arrived on the coast. They immediately sought out the  stranger, and demanded what had become of their father. Beorn, in  order to hide his own guilt, fabricated a tale of Lothbroc's having  been killed by Edmund, the king of the East Angles. The sons of the  murdered Lothbroc were incensed at this news. They aroused their  countrymen by calling upon them every where to aid them in revenging  their father's death. A large naval force was accordingly collected,  and a formidable descent made upon the English coast.    Now Edmund, according to the story, was a humane and gentle-minded  man, much more interested in deeds of benevolence and of piety than in  warlike undertakings and exploits, and he was very far from being well  prepared to meet this formidable foe. In fact, he sought refuge in  a retired residence called Heglesdune. The Danes, having taken  some Saxons captive in a city which they had sacked and destroyed,  compelled them to make known the place of the king's retreat. Hinquar,  the captain of the Danes, sent him a summons to come and surrender  both himself and all the treasures of his kingdom. Edmund refused.  Hinquar then laid siege to the palace, and surrounded it; and,  finally, his soldiers, breaking in, put Edmund's attendants to death,  and brought Edmund himself, bound, into Hinquar's presence.    Hinquar decided that the unfortunate captive should die. He was,  accordingly, first taken to a tree and scourged. Then he was shot at  with arrows, until, as the account states, his body was so full of the  arrows that remained in the flesh that there seemed to be no room for  more. During all this time Edmund continued to call upon the name of  Christ, as if finding spiritual refuge and strength in the Redeemer in  this his hour of extremity; and although these ejaculations afforded,  doubtless, great support and comfort to him, they only served to  irritate to a perfect phrensy of exasperation his implacable pagan  foes. They continued to shoot arrows into him until he was dead, and  then they cut off his head and went away, carrying the dissevered head  with them. Their object was to prevent his friends from having the  satisfaction of interring it with the body. They carried it to what  they supposed a sufficient distance, and then threw it off into a wood  by the way-side, where they supposed it could not easily be found.    As soon, however, as the Danes had left the place, the affrighted  friends and followers of Edmund came out, by degrees, from their  retreats and hiding places. They readily found the dead body of their  sovereign, as it lay, of course, where the cruel deed of his murder  had been performed. They sought with mournful and anxious steps, here  and there, all around, for the head, until at length, when they came  into the wood where it was lying, they heard, as the historian who  records these events gravely testifies, a voice issuing from it,  calling them, and directing their steps by the sound. They followed  the voice, and, having recovered the head by means of this miraculous  guidance, they buried it with the body.[1]    It seems surprising to us that reasonable men should so readily  believe such tales as these; but there are, in all ages of the world,  certain habits of belief, in conformity to which the whole community  go together. We all believe whatever is in harmony with, or analogous  to, the general type of faith prevailing in our own generation. Nobody  could be persuaded now that a dead head could speak, or a wolf change  his nature to protect it; but thousands will credit a fortune-teller,  or believe that a mesmerized patient can have a mental perception of  scenes and occurrences a thousand miles away.    There was a great deal of superstition in the days when Alfred was  called to the throne, and there was also, with it, a great deal of  genuine honest piety. The piety and the superstition, too, were  inextricably intermingled and combined together. They were all  Catholics then, yielding an implicit obedience to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16546"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 2 (#11)"],[1,", that was preached as no store of  merit[107] by the Tathagata and therefore it is called a store of  merit. If there existed a store of merit, the Tathagata would not have  preached a store of merit.\" That is to say, if I understand this dark  language rightly, accumulated merit is part of the world of illusion  which we live in and by speaking of it as he did the Buddha implied  that it, like everything else in the world, is really non-existent.  Did it belong to the sphere of absolute truth, he would not have  spoken of it as if it were one of the things commonly but erroneously  supposed to exist. Finally we are told of the highest knowledge \"Even  the smallest thing is not known or perceived there; therefore it is  called the highest perfect knowledge.\" That is to say perfect  knowledge transcends all distinctions; it recognises the illusory  nature of all individuality and the truth of sameness, the  never-changing one behind the ever-changing many. In this sense it is  said to perceive nothing and know nothing.    One might expect that a philosophy thus prone to use the language of  extreme nihilism would slip into a destructive, or at least negative  system. But Mahayanism was pulled equally strongly in the opposite  direction by the popular and mythological elements which it contained  and was on the whole inclined to theism and even polytheism quite as  much as to atheism and acosmism. A modern Japanese writer[108] says  that Dharma-kaya \"may be considered to be equivalent to the Christian  conception of the Godhead.\" This is excessive as a historical  statement of the view current in India during the early centuries of  our era, but it does seem true that Dharma-kaya was made the  equivalent of the Hindu conception of Param Brahma and also that it is  very nearly equivalent to the Chinese Tao.[109]    The work called _Awakening of Faith_[110] and ascribed to Asvaghosha  is not extant in Sanskrit but was translated into Chinese in 553 A.D.  Its doctrine is practically that of the Yogacara school and this makes  the ascription doubtful, but it is a most important treatise. It is  regarded as authoritative in China and Japan at the present day and it  illustrates the triple tendency of the Mahayana towards metaphysics,  mythology, and devotional piety. It declares that faith has four  aspects. Three of these are the three Jewels, or Buddha, the Law and  the Church, and cover between them the whole field of religion and  morality as generally understood. The exposition is tinged with a fine  unselfish emotion and tells the believer that though he should strive  not for his own emancipation but for the salvation of others yet he  himself receives unselfish and supernatural assistance. He is  remembered and guarded by Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in all quarters of  the Universe who are eternally trying to liberate mankind by various  expedients (upaya). By expedient is meant a modified presentment of  the truth, which is easier of comprehension and, if not the goal, at  least on the road to it, such as the Paradise of Amitabha.[111]    But the remaining aspect of faith, which is the one that the author  puts first in his enumeration, and treats at great length, is \"to  believe in the fundamental truth, that is to think joyfully of  suchness.\" By suchness (in Sanskrit _bhuta-tathata_, in Chinese _Chen  ju_) is meant absolute truth as contrasted with the relative truth of  ordinary experience.[112] The word is not illuminating nor likely to  excite religious emotion and the most that can be said for it is that  it is less dreary than the void of Nagarjuna. Another and more  positive synonym is _dharma-dhatu_, the all-embracing totality of  things. It is only through our ignorance and subjectivity that things  appear distinct and individuate. Could we transcend this  subjectivity, isolated objects would cease to exist. Things in their  fundamental nature cannot be named or explained: they are beyond the  range of language and perception: they have no signs of distinction  but possess absolute sameness (samata). From this totality of things  nothing can be excluded and to it nothing can be added. Yet it is also  sunyata, negation or the void, because it cannot be said to possess  any of the attributes of the world we live in: neither existence nor  non-existence, nor unity nor plurality can be predicted of it.  According to the celebrated formula of Nagarjuna known as the eight  Nos there is in it \"neither production (_utpada_) nor destruction  (_uccheda_) nor annihilation (_nirodha_) nor persistence (_sasvata_)  nor unity (_ekartha_) nor plurality (_nanartha_) nor coming in  (_agamana_) nor going out (_nirgama_).\" But when we perceive that both  subject and object are unreal we also see that suchness is the one  reality and from that point of view it may be regarded as the  Dharma-kaya of all Buddhas. It is also called Tathagatagarbha, the  womb or store-house of the Buddha, from which all individual  existences are evolved under the law of causation, but this aspect of  it is already affected by ignorance, for in Bhuta-tathata as known in  the light of the highest truth there is neither causation nor  production. The Yogacara employs the word _sunyata_ (void), though not  so much as its sister school, but it makes special use of the term  _alaya-vijnana_, the receptacle or store of consciousness. This in so  far as it is superindividual is an aspect of suchness, but when it  affirms and particularises itself it becomes _citta_, that is the  human mind, or to be more accurate the substratum of the human mind  from which is developed _manas_, or the principle of will,  self-consciousness and self-affirmation. Similarly the Vedanta  philosophy, though it has no term corresponding to _alaya-vijnana_, is  familiar with the idea that Brahman is in one aspect immeasurable and  all-embracing but in another is infinitesimal and dwells in the human  heart: or that Brahman after creating the world entered into it. Again  another aspect of suchness is enlightenment (_bodhi_), that is  absolute knowledge free from the limitations of subject and object.  This \"is the universal Dharma-kaya of the Tathagatas\" and on account  of this all Tathagatas are spoken of as abiding in enlightenment _a  priori_. This enlightenment may be negative (as _sunyata_) in the  sense that it transcends all relations but it may also be affirmative  and then \"it transforms and unfolds itself, whenever conditions are  favourable, in the form of a Tathagata or some other form in order  that all beings may be induced to bring their store of merit to  maturity.\"[113]    It will be seen from the above that the absolute truth of the  Mahayanists varies from a severely metaphysical conception, the  indescribable thing in itself, to something very like an all-pervading  benevolent essence which from time to time takes shape in a Buddha.  And here we see how easy is the transition from the old Buddhism to a  form of pantheism. For if we admit that the Buddha is a superhuman  intelligence appearing from time to time according to a certain law,  we add little to this statement by saying that the essence or spirit  of the cosmos manifests itself from time to time as a Buddha. Only,  such words as essence or spirit are not really correct. The world of  individuals is the same as the highest truth, the same as the  Dharma-kaya, the same as Nirvana. It is only through ignorance that it  appears to be different and particularized. Ignorance, the essence of  which consists in believing in the distinction between subject and  object, is also called defilement and the highest truth passes through  various stages of defilement ending with that where under the  influence of egoism and passion the external world of particulars is  believed to be everything. But the various stages may influence one  another[114] so that under a higher influence the mind which is  involved in subjectivity begins to long for Nirvana. Yet Nirvana is  not something different from or beyond the world of experience; it  does not really involve annihilation of the skandhas. Just as in the  Advaita he who has the true knowledge sees that he himself and  everything else is Brahman, so for the Mahayanist all things are seen  _to be_ Nirvana, _to be_ the Dharma-kaya. It is sometimes[115] said  that there are four kinds of Nirvana (_a_) absolute Nirvana, which is  a synonym of the Dharma-kaya and in that sense universally present in  all beings, (_b_) upadhisesha-nirvana, the state of enlightenment  which can be attained during life, while the body with its limitations  still remains, (_c_) anupadhisesha-nirvana, a higher degree of the  same state attained after death when the hindrances of the body are  removed, (_d_) Nirvana without abode or apratishthita-nirvana. Those  who attain to this understand that there is no real antithesis between  Samsara and Nirvana:[116] they do not seek for rest or emancipation  but devote themselves to beneficent activity and to leading their  fellows to salvation. Although these statements that Nirvana and  Samsara are the same are not at all in the manner of the older  Buddhism, yet this ideal of disinterested activity combined with  Nirvana is not inconsistent with the portrait of Gotama preserved in  the Pali Canon.    The Mahayanist Buddhism of the Far East makes free use of such phrases  as the Buddha in the heart, the Buddha mind and the Buddha nature.  These seem to represent such Sanskrit terms as Buddhatva and  Bodhicitta which can receive either an ethical or a metaphysical  emphasis. The former line of thought is well shown in Santideva[117]  who treats Bodhicitta as the initial impulse and motive power of the  religious life, combining intellectual illumination and unselfish  devotion to the good of others. Thus regarded it is a guiding and  stimulating principle somewhat analogous to the Holy Spirit in  Christianity. But the Bodhicitta is also the"]]]
