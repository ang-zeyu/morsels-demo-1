They got on comfortably at first, though they were much puzzled with my  tobacco-pipe and insisted on seeing me use it.  When I had shown them  what I did with it, they were astonished but not displeased, and seemed  to like the smell.  But by and by they came to my watch, which I had  hidden away in the inmost pocket that I had, and had forgotten when they  began their search.  They seemed concerned and uneasy as soon as they got  hold of it.  They then made me open it and show the works; and when I had  done so they gave signs of very grave displeasure, which disturbed me all  the more because I could not conceive wherein it could have offended  them.    I remember that when they first found it I had thought of Paley, and how  he tells us that a savage on seeing a watch would at once conclude that  it was designed.  True, these people were not savages, but I none the  less felt sure that this was the conclusion they would arrive at; and I  was thinking what a wonderfully wise man Archbishop Paley must have been,  when I was aroused by a look of horror and dismay upon the face of the  magistrate, a look which conveyed to me the impression that he regarded  my watch not as having been designed, but rather as the designer of  himself and of the universe; or as at any rate one of the great first  causes of all things.    Then it struck me that this view was quite as likely to be taken as the  other by a people who had no experience of European civilisation, and I  was a little piqued with Paley for having led me so much astray; but I  soon discovered that I had misinterpreted the expression on the  magistrate's face, and that it was one not of fear, but hatred.  He spoke  to me solemnly and sternly for two or three minutes.  Then, reflecting  that this was of no use, he caused me to be conducted through several  passages into a large room, which I afterwards found was the museum of  the town, and wherein I beheld a sight which astonished me more than  anything that I had yet seen.    It was filled with cases containing all manner of curiosities--such as  skeletons, stuffed birds and animals, carvings in stone (whereof I saw  several that were like those on the saddle, only smaller), but the  greater part of the room was occupied by broken machinery of all  descriptions.  The larger specimens had a case to themselves, and tickets  with writing on them in a character which I could not understand.  There  were fragments of steam engines, all broken and rusted; among them I saw  a cylinder and piston, a broken fly-wheel, and part of a crank, which was  laid on the ground by their side.  Again, there was a very old carriage  whose wheels in spite of rust and decay, I could see, had been designed  originally for iron rails.  Indeed, there were fragments of a great many  of our own most advanced inventions; but they seemed all to be several  hundred years old, and to be placed where they were, not for instruction,  but curiosity.  As I said before, all were marred and broken.    We passed many cases, and at last came to one in which there were several  clocks and two or three old watches.  Here the magistrate stopped, and  opening the case began comparing my watch with the others.  The design  was different, but the thing was clearly the same.  On this he turned to  me and made me a speech in a severe and injured tone of voice, pointing  repeatedly to the watches in the case, and to my own; neither did he seem  in the least appeased until I made signs to him that he had better take  my watch and put it with the others.  This had some effect in calming  him.  I said in English (trusting to tone and manner to convey my  meaning) that I was exceedingly sorry if I had been found to have  anything contraband in my possession; that I had had no intention of  evading the ordinary tolls, and that I would gladly forfeit the watch if  my doing so would atone for an unintentional violation of the law.  He  began presently to relent, and spoke to me in a kinder manner.  I think  he saw that I had offended without knowledge; but I believe the chief  thing that brought him round was my not seeming to be afraid of him,  although I was quite respectful; this, and my having light hair and  complexion, on which he had remarked previously by signs, as every one  else had done.    I afterwards found that it was reckoned a very great merit to have fair  hair, this being a thing of the rarest possible occurrence, and greatly  admired and envied in all who were possessed of it.  However that might  be, my watch was taken from me; but our peace was made, and I was  conducted back to the room where I had been examined.  The magistrate  then made me another speech, whereon I was taken to a building hard by,  which I soon discovered to be the common prison of the town, but in which  an apartment was assigned me separate from the other prisoners.  The room  contained a bed, table, and chairs, also a fireplace and a washing-stand.  There was another door, which opened on to a balcony, with a flight of  steps descending into a walled garden of some size.  The man who  conducted me into this room made signs to me that I might go down and  walk in the garden whenever I pleased, and intimated that I should  shortly have something brought me to eat.  I was allowed to retain my  blankets, and the few things which I had wrapped inside them, but it was  plain that I was to consider myself a prisoner--for how long a period I  could not by any means determine.  He then left me alone.          CHAPTER VIII: IN PRISON      And now for the first time my courage completely failed me.  It is enough  to say that I was penniless, and a prisoner in a foreign country, where I  had no friend, nor any knowledge of the customs or language of the  people.  I was at the mercy of men with whom I had little in common.  And  yet, engrossed as I was with my extremely difficult and doubtful  position, I could not help feeling deeply interested in the people among  whom I had fallen.  What was the meaning of that room full of old  machinery which I had just seen, and of the displeasure with which the  magistrate had regarded my watch?  The people had very little machinery  now.  I had been struck with this over and over again, though I had not  been more than four-and-twenty hours in the country.  They were about as  far advanced as Europeans of the twelfth or thirteenth century; certainly  not more so.  And yet they must have had at one time the fullest  knowledge of our own most recent inventions.  How could it have happened  that having been once so far in advance they were now as much behind us?  It was evident that it was not from ignorance.  They knew my watch as a  watch when they saw it; and the care with which the broken machines were  preserved and ticketed, proved that they had not lost the recollection of  their former civilisation.  The more I thought, the less I could  understand it; but at last I concluded that they must have worked out  their mines of coal and iron, till either none were left, or so few, that  the use of these metals was restricted to the very highest nobility.  This  was the only solution I could think of; and, though I afterwards found  how entirely mistaken it was, I felt quite sure then that it must be the  right one.    I had hardly arrived at this opinion for above four or five minutes, when  the door opened, and a young woman made her appearance with a tray, and a  very appetising smell of dinner.  I gazed upon her with admiration as she  laid a cloth and set a savoury-looking dish upon the table.  As I beheld  her I felt as though my position was already much ameliorated, for the  very sight of her carried great comfort.  She was not more than twenty,  rather above the middle height, active and strong, but yet most  delicately featured; her lips were full and sweet; her eyes were of a  deep hazel, and fringed with long and springing eyelashes; her hair was  neatly braided from off her forehead; her complexion was simply  exquisite; her figure as robust as was consistent with the most perfect  female beauty, yet not more so; her hands and feet might have served as  models to a sculptor.  Having set the stew upon the table, she retired  with a glance of pity, whereon (remembering pity's kinsman) I decided  that she should pity me a little more.  She returned with a bottle and a  glass, and found me sitting on the bed with my hands over my face,  looking the very picture of abject misery, and, like all pictures, rather  untruthful.  As I watched her, through my fingers, out of the room again,  I felt sure that she was exceedingly sorry for me.  Her back being  turned, I set to work and ate my dinner, which was excellent.    She returned in about an hour to take away; and there came with her a man  who had a great bunch of keys at his waist, and whose manner convinced me  that he was the jailor.  I afterwards found that he was father to the  beautiful creature who had brought me my dinner.  I am not a much greater  hypocrite than other people, and do what I would, I could not look so  very miserable.  I had already recovered from my dejection, and felt in a  most genial humour both with my jailor and his daughter.  I thanked them  for their attention towards me; and, though they could not understand,  they looked at one another and laughed and chattered till the old man  said something or other which I suppose was a joke; for the girl laughed  merrily and ran away, leaving her father to take away the dinner things.  Then I had another visitor, who was not so prepossessing, and who seemed  to have a great idea of himself and a small one of me.  He brought a book  with him, and pens and paper--all very English; and yet, neither paper,  nor printing, nor binding, nor pen, nor ink, were quite the same as ours.    He gave me to understand that he was to teach me the language and that we  were to begin at once.  This delighted me, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19061"],[0,"Seeing Europe with Famous Authors, Volume 8 (#11)"],[1," strong, glowing sunshine.    At every street corner sellers are sitting behind baskets of  extraordinary vegetables and magnificent fruit; and under the arcades  that run along the houses, big grocers in shirt sleeves come at  intervals to their shop doors to take breath, like hippopotami coming  out of the water for the same purpose. In this town, ultramontane in its  piety, the bells of churches and convents are sounding all day long, and  women are seen going to make their evening prayer together in the  nearest chapel.    But if the fair sex in Lugano are diligent in frequenting the churches,  they by no means scorn the cafes. After sunset the little tables that  are all over the great square are surrounded by an entire population of  men and women. How gay and amusing those Italian cafes are! full of  sound and color, with their red and blue striped awnings, their advance  guard of little tables under the shade of the orange-trees, and their  babbling, stirring, gesticulating company. The waiters, in black vests  and leather slippers, a corner of their apron tucked up in their belt,  run with the speed of kangaroos, carrying on metal plates syrups of  every shade, ices, sweets in red, yellow, or green pyramids. Between  seven and nine o'clock the whole society of Lugano defiles before you.  There are lawyers with their wives, doctors with their daughters,  bankers, professors, merchants, public officials, with whom are  sometimes misted stout, comfortable, jovial-looking canons, wrapping  themselves in the bitter smoke of a regalia, as in a cloud of incense.          LAKE COMO[21]    BY PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY      We have been to Como, looking for a house. This lake exceeds anything I  ever beheld in beauty, with the exception of the arbutus islands of  Killarney. It is long and narrow, and has the appearance of a mighty  river winding among the mountains and the forests. We sailed from the  town of Como to a tract of country called the Tremezina, and saw the  various aspects presented by that part of the lake. The mountains  between Como and that village, or rather cluster of villages, are  covered on high with chestnut forests (the eating chestnuts, on which  the inhabitants of the country subsist in time of scarcity), which  sometimes descend to the very verge of the lake, overhanging it with  their hoary branches. But usually the immediate border of this shore is  composed of laurel-trees, and bay, and myrtle, and wild fig-trees, and  olives which grow in the crevices of the rocks, and overhang the  caverns, and shadow the deep glens, which are filled with the flashing  light of the waterfalls. Other flowering shrubs, which I can not name,  grow there also. On high, the towers of village churches are seen white  among the dark forests.    Beyond, on the opposite shore, which faces the south, the mountains  descend less precipitously to the lake, and altho they are much higher,  and some covered with perpetual snow, there intervenes between them and  the lake a range of lower hills, which have glens and rifts opening to  the other, such as I should fancy the abysses of Ida or Parnassus. Here  are plantations of olive, and orange, and lemon trees, which are now so  loaded with fruit, that there is more fruit than leaves--and vineyards.  This shore of the lake is one continued village, and the Milanese  nobility have their villas here. The union of culture and the untameable  profusion and loveliness of nature is here so close, that the line where  they are divided can hardly be discovered.    But the finest scenery is that of the Villa Pliniana; so called from a  fountain which ebbs and flows every three hours, described by the  younger Pliny, which is in the courtyard. This house, which was once a  magnificent palace, and is now half in ruins, we are endeavoring to  procure. It is built upon terraces raised from the bottom of the lake,  together with its garden, at the foot of a semicircular precipice,  overshadowed by profound forests of chestnut. The scene from the  colonnade is the most extraordinary, at once, and the most lovely that  eye ever beheld. On one side is the mountain, and immediately over you  are clusters of cypress-trees, of an astonishing height, which seem to  pierce the sky.    Above you, from among the clouds, as it were, descends a waterfall of  immense size, broken by the woody rocks into a thousand channels to the  lake. On the other side is seen the blue extent of the lake and the  mountains, speckled with sails and spires. The apartments of the  Pliniana are immensely large, but ill-furnished and antique. The  terraces, which overlook the lake, and conduct under the shade of such  immense laurel-trees as deserve the epithet of Pythian, are most  delightful.          BELLAGIO ON LAKE COMO[22]    BY W. D. M'CRACKEN      The picture of the promontory of Bellagio is so beautiful as a whole  that the traveler had better stand off for awhile to admire it at a  distance and at his leisure. Indeed it is a question whether the lasting  impressions which we treasure of Bellagio are not, after all, those  derived from across the lake, from the shore-fronts of Tremezzo,  Cadenabbia, Menaggio, or Varenna.    A colossal, conquering geological lion appears to have come up from the  south in times immemorial, bound for the north, and finding further  progress stopt by the great sheet of water in front of him, seems to  have halted and to be now crouching there with his noble head between  his paws and his eyes fixt on the snow-covered Alps. The big white house  on the lion's neck is the Villa Serbelloni, now used as the annex of a  hotel, and the park of noble trees belonging to the villa forms the  lion's mane. Hotels, both large and small, line the quay at the water's  edge; then comes a break in the houses, and stately Villa Melzi is seen  to stand off at one side. Villa Trotti gleams from among its bowers  farther south; on the slope Villa Trivulzio, formerly Poldi, shows  bravely, and Villa Giulia has cut for itself a wide prospect over both  arms of the lake. At the back of this lion couchant, in the middle  ground, sheer mountain walls tower protectingly, culminating in Monte  Grigna.    The picture varies from hour to hour, from day to day, and from season  to season. Its color-scheme changes with wind and sun, its sparkle comes  and goes from sunrise to sunset; only its form remains untouched through  the night and lives to delight us another day. As the evening wears on,  lights appear one by one on the quay of Bellagio, until there is a line  of fire along the base of the dark peninsula. The hotel windows catch  the glare, the villas light their storied corridors, and presently  Bellagio, all aglow, presents the spectacle of a Venetian night mirrored  in the lake.    By this time the mountains have turned black and the sky has faded. It  grows so still on the water that the tinkle of a little Italian band  reaches across the lake to Cadenabbia, a laugh rings out into the quiet  air from one of the merry little rowboats, and even the slight clatter  made by the fishermen, in putting their boats to rights for the night  and in carrying their nets indoors, can be distinguished as one of many  indications that the day is done.    When we land at Bellagio by daylight, we find it to be very much of a  bazaar of souvenirs along the water-front, and everybody determined to  carry away a keepsake. There is so much to buy--ornamental olive wood  and tortoise-shell articles, Como blankets, lace, and what may be  described in general terms as modern antiquities. These abound from shop  to shop; even English groceries are available. Bellagio's principal  street is suddenly converted at its northern end into a delightful  arcade, after the arrangement which constitutes a characteristic charm  of the villages and smaller towns on the Italian lakes; moreover, the  vista up its side street is distinctly original. This mounts steeply  from the waterside, like the streets of Algiers, is narrow and  constructed in long steps to break the incline.          THE REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO[23]    BY JOSEPH ADDISON      The town and republic of St. Marino stands on the top of a very high and  craggy mountain. It is generally hid among the clouds, and lay under  snow when I saw it, though it was clear and warm weather in all the  country about it. There is not a spring or fountain, that I could hear  of, in the whole dominions; but they are always well provided with huge  cisterns and reservoirs of rain and snow water. The wine that grows on  the sides of their mountain is extraordinarily good, much better than  any I met with on the cold side of the Apennines.    This mountain, and a few neighboring hillocks that lie scattered about  the bottom of it, is the whole circuit of these dominions. They have  what they call three castles, three convents, and five churches and can  reckon about five thousand souls in their community.[24] The  inhabitants, as well as the historians who mention this little republic,  give the following account of its origin. St. Marino was its founder, a  Dalmatian by birth, and by trade a mason. He was employed above thirteen  hundred years ago in the reparation of Rimini, and after he had finished  his work, retired to this solitary mountain, as finding it very proper  for the life of a hermit, which he led in the greatest rigors and  austerities of religion. He had not been long here before he wrought a  reputed miracle, which, joined with his extraordinary sanctity, gained  him so great an esteem, that the princess of the country made him a  present of the mountain, to dispose of at his own discretion. His  reputation quickly peopled it, and gave rise to the republic which calls  itself after his name.    So that the commonwealth of Marino may boast, at least, of a nobler  original than that of Rome, the one having been at first an asylum for  robbers and murderers, and the other"]]]
