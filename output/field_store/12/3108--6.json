They are really becoming \"masters of the situation.\" Their constant  contact with white people is having the effect of introducing among them  the germs of an incipient civilisation. The mode of treating them by the  British and the Dutch is, undoubtedly, very different. A far harsher and  more cruel method has been in vogue by the Dutch towards them, than  would be tolerated by the British. But, from the cause to which I have  alluded, the day has arrived when all this old system is sensibly  changing; and the Draconian code of the Boers, from the force of  circumstances, is becoming modified every day. I have made it my  business to observe carefully all the signs of the times, on this native  question during my tour. I have seen the Kafirs in thousands working in  the mines at Kimberley, and Klerksdorp, and Johannesburg; I have  observed them in multitudes employed in extensive building operations  at Pretoria, and as labourers on the public works at Maritzburg and  Durban, and at the other great shipping centres of Port Elizabeth and  Cape Town; I have noticed them in their capacity of servants in private  houses, and I frankly confess that no evidence has been brought before  me to indicate, that they are harshly or unkindly treated. On the  contrary, it appeared to me that they are receiving good wages, and are  everywhere well cared for and comfortable. They are naturally a lively  and a happy race, and I have seen them as cheerful and light-hearted in  the town, as in their kraals on the wild and open veldt.    [Illustration: Decorative]          [Illustration: Decorative]    RAILWAYS.      I have already mentioned that, in my interview with the President, Paul  Kruger, I told him that I was never in a country, which, in my opinion,  required railways more than the Transvaal, and that I hoped to see the  day when it would be penetrated by them in every direction. It is much  to be regretted that there is so much jealous rivalry, inducing fierce  contention, as to the precise direction, from the east, or south, or  west, railroads should enter the Transvaal. I contend, that there is  such a prospect of future enormous development in this wonderful centre  of South Africa, that there is no need for all this rivalry, but that  there is room for many lines in which all may participate and prosper,  in the future. Political considerations have undoubtedly complicated a  question, which I should wish to regard solely from its commercial  aspect.    Personally, I am anxious to see the line over the ground which I have  myself treked, pushed on as speedily as possible, from Kimberley to  Vryburg, and thence through British Bechuanaland to Mafeking, and so on,  northwards, into the Matabele country, with branches eastward into the  Transvaal. But I should like, also, to see the contemplated line  constructed from Kimberley, through the Orange Free State, to  Bloemfontein; and the Delagoa Bay Railway carried on to Pretoria, as  well as the Natal line to Johannesburg; and, in fact, any other, whether  through Swaziland, or elsewhere, which commercial enterprise may  hereafter project. They will all have the effect of opening up the  Transvaal--the El Dorado of South Africa--and meeting the demand for  the transit of the enormous traffic, with which the old system of  bullock wagons is utterly unable to grapple, and which, consequently, is  so fearfully congested. The transport riders will have ample  compensation, under the new system, in their increased employment in the  conveyance of goods from the various stations to their actual  destination. It was in this way the coach proprietors, without loss, and  with great advantage to themselves, became the great and successful  railway carriers, when stage coaches were superseded by railways in  England.    Since I arrived in England, Sir Gordon Sprigg, in an important speech  delivered at Kimberley, referred to the question of railway extension  from that town in the following words:--\"With the South Atlantic Ocean  for our base, we started with our railway, and then we came up to  Kimberley. From this place we have only fifty or sixty miles to go  over, and then we come to the border of this province, and of British  Bechuanaland. Farther north, we get to that ill-defined sphere, called  the sphere of influence, that extended the power of Britain in South  Africa, as far as the Zambesi.... Now that we have our railway up to  Kimberley, we have the British South African Company to take it in hand,  and the object of the Government is to see that we have an extension  line into these territories which will, in time to come, be recognised  as portions of the Cape Colony. Gentlemen, I and my colleagues have come  to the conclusion, that we cannot better advance the best interests of  South Africa than by joining hand-in-hand to advance British interests  westward of the Transvaal State, and right up to the Zambesi. Well,  then, that being so, I may say, that the first object of the Company,  in order to carry on their operations to the best purpose, is to  construct a railway from Kimberley to Vryburg. The section from  Kimberley to Warrenton has, of course, first to be undertaken, and from  there on to Vryburg, as the second section. The Company are in  possession of the requisite funds to carry out this great work; and  there is no reason why it should not be accomplished before many month's  are over. The Government of this country (Cape Colony) have come to the  conclusion that it is desirable that this work should be carried out,  and an arrangement has been made between the Government of this country  and Mr. Rhodes as representing the British South African Company,  whereby a railway starting from Kimberley up to Vryburg will be  constructed by the British South African Company. Certain conditions  have been entered into between the Company and the Government of this  Colony, under which the Government of the Colony will have the right to  take over the railway at any time they think proper, on certain  conditions to be entered into by one side or the other. This railway  extension is to be immediately proceeded with. You may take it as a  moral certainty that you will be able to travel by railway up to  Warrenton, some time in the course of next year. The Government have  come to the conclusion that it is in the interests of South Africa that  this work shall be carried on; that, in short, it would be highly  injudicious to place any obstacles in the way of an undertaking which is  calculated to have so beneficial an effect on the prospects of this part  of Her Majesty's Empire.\" This Speech, coming from the Premier of the  Cape Colony, requires no comment from me, beyond the expression of my  satisfaction at its having been made.          [Illustration: Decorative]    COLONISATION.      Colonisation is a subject on which I wish to say a few words. The  definition given by Adam Smith of the three elements of national wealth,  \"Land, Labour, and Capital,\" cannot be too often repeated. How to blend  them in proper proportions, is a problem, which has puzzled generations  of statesmen, philosophers, and philanthropists. I have always been a  warm advocate for colonisation. It appears to me to be a question of  such supreme national importance, that I think it ought to be undertaken  by the State. This, of course, means, that it is possible, as it is  undoubtedly indispensable, to get a Government to act wisely and well.  In order to have a chance of its being successful, colonisation must be  conducted on sound principles and practice.    In South Africa I have seen millions of acres of fertile land--in  Bechuanaland, in Natal, in the Eastern and Western provinces of the Cape  Colony, to say nothing of the Transvaal--capable of supporting many  thousands of our surplus population. But I have also satisfied myself,  that it is no use whatever to transplant those, who are unfitted for it.  Instead of a success, certain failure will be the result of an attempt  so unwise. Colonial life is alone suitable for the enterprising,  energetic, steady, and industrious men, and women, who are determined,  with patience and courage, to overcome the difficulties and trials,  which they must certainly encounter on the road to ultimate success.  South Africa is a land of promise for them. It is by no means so for  the feeble, the self-indulgent, the helplessly dependent class, of whom,  unfortunately, we have so large a number in the over-populated Old  Country. Cordial co-operation with the self-governing colonies is also  absolutely indispensable to ensure success in any national system of  colonisation. It is equally essential that a strict selection of the  right sort of people should be made. According, too, to their positions  in life, they must be provided with sufficient means to support them on  their first arrival, while they are settling themselves, and their crops  are growing, and they are acquiring knowledge, of the natural conditions  of the new land, to which they have been transplanted.    These are the principles necessary to be observed in any national system  of colonisation. They apply to all the other British Colonies, equally  with South Africa, in order to prevent failure, and command success.    While speaking of this subject, I should like to mention a suggestion  for a system of special colonisation, which may well attract the serious  attention of the Home Government, with the view of encouraging and  promoting it.    In the military garrisons, comprising the British troops, quartered in  South Africa, there are a considerable number of steady, and  well-conducted married men, non-commissioned officers and soldiers, who,  having been stationed for some time in the midst of its genial climate,  and pleasant "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/164"],[0,"Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea (#11)"],[1,"of a certain number of dishes, the contents of  which were furnished by the sea alone; and I was ignorant of the nature  and mode of preparation of some of them.  I acknowledged that they were  good, but they had a peculiar flavour, which I easily became accustomed  to.  These different aliments appeared to me to be rich in phosphorus,  and I thought they must have a marine origin.    Captain Nemo looked at me.  I asked him no questions, but he guessed my  thoughts, and answered of his own accord the questions which I was  burning to address to him.    \"The greater part of these dishes are unknown to you,\" he said to me.  \"However, you may partake of them without fear.  They are wholesome and  nourishing.  For a long time I have renounced the food of the earth,  and I am never ill now.  My crew, who are healthy, are fed on the same  food.\"    \"So,\" said I, \"all these eatables are the produce of the sea?\"    \"Yes, Professor, the sea supplies all my wants.  Sometimes I cast my  nets in tow, and I draw them in ready to break.  Sometimes I hunt in  the midst of this element, which appears to be inaccessible to man, and  quarry the game which dwells in my submarine forests.  My flocks, like  those of Neptune's old shepherds, graze fearlessly in the immense  prairies of the ocean.  I have a vast property there, which I cultivate  myself, and which is always sown by the hand of the Creator of all  things.\"    \"I can understand perfectly, sir, that your nets furnish excellent fish  for your table; I can understand also that you hunt aquatic game in  your submarine forests; but I cannot understand at all how a particle  of meat, no matter how small, can figure in your bill of fare.\"    \"This, which you believe to be meat, Professor, is nothing else than  fillet of turtle.  Here are also some dolphins' livers, which you take  to be ragout of pork.  My cook is a clever fellow, who excels in  dressing these various products of the ocean.  Taste all these dishes.  Here is a preserve of sea-cucumber, which a Malay would declare to be  unrivalled in the world; here is a cream, of which the milk has been  furnished by the cetacea, and the sugar by the great fucus of the North  Sea; and, lastly, permit me to offer you some preserve of anemones,  which is equal to that of the most delicious fruits.\"    I tasted, more from curiosity than as a connoisseur, whilst Captain  Nemo enchanted me with his extraordinary stories.    \"You like the sea, Captain?\"    \"Yes; I love it!  The sea is everything.  It covers seven tenths of the  terrestrial globe.  Its breath is pure and healthy.  It is an immense  desert, where man is never lonely, for he feels life stirring on all  sides.  The sea is only the embodiment of a supernatural and wonderful  existence.  It is nothing but love and emotion; it is the `Living  Infinite,' as one of your poets has said.  In fact, Professor, Nature  manifests herself in it by her three kingdoms--mineral, vegetable, and  animal.  The sea is the vast reservoir of Nature.  The globe began with  sea, so to speak; and who knows if it will not end with it?  In it is  supreme tranquillity.  The sea does not belong to despots.  Upon its  surface men can still exercise unjust laws, fight, tear one another to  pieces, and be carried away with terrestrial horrors.  But at thirty  feet below its level, their reign ceases, their influence is quenched,  and their power disappears.  Ah! sir, live--live in the bosom of the  waters!  There only is independence!  There I recognise no masters!  There I am free!\"    Captain Nemo suddenly became silent in the midst of this enthusiasm, by  which he was quite carried away.  For a few moments he paced up and  down, much agitated.  Then he became more calm, regained his accustomed  coldness of expression, and turning towards me:    \"Now, Professor,\" said he, \"if you wish to go over the Nautilus, I am  at your service.\"    Captain Nemo rose.  I followed him.  A double door, contrived at the  back of the dining-room, opened, and I entered a room equal in  dimensions to that which I had just quitted.    It was a library.  High pieces of furniture, of black violet ebony  inlaid with brass, supported upon their wide shelves a great number of  books uniformly bound.  They followed the shape of the room,  terminating at the lower part in huge divans, covered with brown  leather, which were curved, to afford the greatest comfort.  Light  movable desks, made to slide in and out at will, allowed one to rest  one's book while reading.  In the centre stood an immense table,  covered with pamphlets, amongst which were some newspapers, already of  old date.  The electric light flooded everything; it was shed from four  unpolished globes half sunk in the volutes of the ceiling.  I looked  with real admiration at this room, so ingeniously fitted up, and I  could scarcely believe my eyes.    \"Captain Nemo,\" said I to my host, who had just thrown himself on one  of the divans, \"this is a library which would do honour to more than  one of the continental palaces, and I am absolutely astounded when I  consider that it can follow you to the bottom of the seas.\"    \"Where could one find greater solitude or silence, Professor?\" replied  Captain Nemo.  \"Did your study in the Museum afford you such perfect  quiet?\"    \"No, sir; and I must confess that it is a very poor one after yours.  You must have six or seven thousand volumes here.\"    \"Twelve thousand, M. Aronnax.  These are the only ties which bind me to  the earth.  But I had done with the world on the day when my Nautilus  plunged for the first time beneath the waters.  That day I bought my  last volumes, my last pamphlets, my last papers, and from that time I  wish to think that men no longer think or write.  These books,  Professor, are at your service besides, and you can make use of them  freely.\"    I thanked Captain Nemo, and went up to the shelves of the library.  Works on science, morals, and literature abounded in every language;  but I did not see one single work on political economy; that subject  appeared to be strictly proscribed.  Strange to say, all these books  were irregularly arranged, in whatever language they were written; and  this medley proved that the Captain of the Nautilus must have read  indiscriminately the books which he took up by chance.    \"Sir,\" said I to the Captain, \"I thank you for having placed this  library at my disposal.  It contains treasures of science, and I shall  profit by them.\"    \"This room is not only a library,\" said Captain Nemo, \"it is also a  smoking-room.\"    \"A smoking-room!\" I cried.  \"Then one may smoke on board?\"    \"Certainly.\"    \"Then, sir, I am forced to believe that you have kept up a  communication with Havannah.\"    \"Not any,\" answered the Captain.  \"Accept this cigar, M. Aronnax; and,  though it does not come from Havannah, you will be pleased with it, if  you are a connoisseur.\"    I took the cigar which was offered me; its shape recalled the London  ones, but it seemed to be made of leaves of gold.  I lighted it at a  little brazier, which was supported upon an elegant bronze stem, and  drew the first whiffs with the delight of a lover of smoking who has  not smoked for two days.    \"It is excellent, but it is not tobacco.\"    \"No!\" answered the Captain, \"this tobacco comes neither from Havannah  nor from the East.  It is a kind of sea-weed, rich in nicotine, with  which the sea provides me, but somewhat sparingly.\"    At that moment Captain Nemo opened a door which stood opposite to that  by which I had entered the library, and I passed into an immense  drawing-room splendidly lighted.    It was a vast, four-sided room, thirty feet long, eighteen wide, and  fifteen high.  A luminous ceiling, decorated with light arabesques,  shed a soft clear light over all the marvels accumulated in this  museum.  For it was in fact a museum, in which an intelligent and  prodigal hand had gathered all the treasures of nature and art, with  the artistic confusion which distinguishes a painter's studio.    Thirty first-rate pictures, uniformly framed, separated by bright  drapery, ornamented the walls, which were hung with tapestry of severe  design. I saw works of great value, the greater part of which I had  admired in the special collections of Europe, and in the exhibitions of  paintings. The several schools of the old masters were represented by a  Madonna of Raphael, a Virgin of Leonardo da Vinci, a nymph of Corregio,  a woman of Titan, an Adoration of Veronese, an Assumption of Murillo, a  portrait of Holbein, a monk of Velasquez, a martyr of Ribera, a fair of  Rubens, two Flemish landscapes of Teniers, three little \"genre\"  pictures of Gerard Dow, Metsu, and Paul Potter, two specimens of  Gericault and Prudhon, and some sea-pieces of Backhuysen and Vernet.  Amongst the works of modern painters were pictures with the signatures  of Delacroix, Ingres, Decamps, Troyon, Meissonier, Daubigny, etc.; and  some admirable statues in marble and bronze, after the finest antique  models, stood upon pedestals in the corners of this magnificent museum.  Amazement, as the Captain of the Nautilus had predicted, had already  begun to take possession of me.    \"Professor,\" said this strange man, \"you must excuse the unceremonious  way in which I receive you, and the disorder of this room.\"    \"Sir,\" I answered, \"without seeking to know who you are, I recognise in  you an artist.\"    \"An amateur, nothing more, sir.  Formerly I loved to collect these  beautiful works created by the hand of man.  I sought them greedily,  and ferreted them out indefatigably, and I have been able to bring  together some objects of great value.  These are my last souvenirs of  that world which is dead to me.  In my eyes, your modern artists are  already old; they have two or three thousand years of existence; I  confound them in my own mind.  Masters have no age.\"    \"And these musicians?\" said I, pointing out some works of "]]]
