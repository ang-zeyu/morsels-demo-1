It proceeded from the center      |                    |     |which lies in the northern part of Illana      |                    |     |Bay, and caused heavy damage to all the      |                    |     |buildings in the towns and in the Moro      |                    |     |villages and strongholds within the      |                    |     |meizoseismal region. The effects were      |                    |     |extraordinary on land as well as within      |                    |     |the bay; in the latter the telegraph      |                    |     |cables were found broken and buried by      |                    |     |debris. It is assumed as certain that      |                    |     |there were many lives lost in the Moro      |                    |     |forts, but their number is not known. The      |                    |     |aftershocks were so frequent that some 400      |                    |     |could be counted within the first 8 days      |                    |     |after the disaster, some 10 or 12 of these      |                    |     |reaching force VI and VII.      |                    |     |  184 | 1902 VIII 26  1  9 |  IX |Province of Iloilo, Panay.

The      |                    |     |disturbance was preceded by an      |                    |     |extraordinary noise, which was audible at      |                    |     |great distances from the epicentral      |                    |     |region. The reports do not mention a      |                    |     |single aftershock.      |                    |     |  185 |1902   XI 17  8 38  | VII |Southwestern Luzon.

I am told, indeed, that he has  sometimes been out whole nights on such excursions, and is often  absent from home for several days. On the way to the valley [the  Hellenenthal, near the Austrian Baden] he often stopped to point out  the prettiest views, or to remark on the defects of the new buildings.  Then he would go back again to his own thoughts and hum to himself in  an incomprehensible fashion; which, I heard, was his fashion of  composing.\"    Professor Kloeber, a well-known artist of that period, who painted  Beethoven's portrait, relates that he often met Beethoven during his  walks near Vienna. \"It was most interesting to watch him,\" he writes;  \"how he would stand still as if listening, with a piece of music paper  in his hands, look up and down and then write something. Dont had told  me when I met him thus not to speak or take any notice, as he would be  very much embarrassed or very disagreeable. I saw him once, when I was  taking a party to the woods, clambering up to an opposite height from  the ravine which separated us, with his broad-brimmed felt hat tucked  under his arm; arrived at the top, he threw himself down full length  and gazed long into the sky.\"    Another contemporary of Beethoven, G.F. Treitschke, gives us an  interesting glimpse of Beethoven's manner of creating and improvising.  Treitschke had been asked to write the text for a new aria that was to  be introduced in \"Fidelio\" when that opera was revived at Vienna in  1814. Beethoven called at seven o'clock in the evening and asked how  the text of the aria was getting on. Treitschke had just finished it,  and handed it to him. Beethoven read it over, he continues, \"walked up  and down the room, humming as usual, instead of singing--and opened  the piano. My wife had often asked him in vain to play; but now,  putting the text before him, he began a wonderful improvisation,  which, unfortunately, there were no magic means of recording. From  this fantasy he seemed to conjure the theme of the aria. Hours passed  but Beethoven continued to improvise. Supper, which he intended to  share with us, was served, but he would not be disturbed. Late in the  evening he embraced me and, without having eaten anything, hurried  home. The following day the piece was ready in all its beauty.\"    This anecdote appears to indicate that Beethoven sometimes composed at  the piano. Meyerbeer, it is said, always composed at his instrument,  and there is a story that he used to jot down the ideas of other  composers at the opera and concerts, and, by thinking and playing  these over, gradually evolve his own themes. It is rather more  surprising to hear, from Herr Pohl, that Haydn sketched all his  compositions at the piano. The condition of the instrument, he adds,  had its effect upon him, beauty of tone being favorable to  inspiration. Thus he wrote to Artaria in 1788: \"I was obliged to buy a  new forte-piano, that I might compose your clavier sonatas  particularly well.\" \"When an idea struck him he sketched it out in a  few notes and figures; this would be his morning's work; in the  afternoon he would enlarge this sketch, elaborating it according to  rule, but taking pains to preserve the unity of the idea.\"    Weber's son relates that it was his father's habit to sit at the  window on summer evenings and jot down the ideas that had come to him,  during his solitary walks, on small pieces of music paper, of which a  large number were usually lying on his table. \"No piano,\" he adds,  \"was touched on these occasions, for his ears spontaneously heard a  full orchestra, played by good spirits, while he wrote down his neat  little notes.\" And Weber himself remarks in one of his essays that,  \"the tone poet who gets his ideas at the piano is almost always born  poor, or in a fair way of delivering his faculties into the hands of  the common and commonplace. For these very hands, which, thanks to  constant practice and training, finally acquire a sort of independence  and will of their own, are unconscious tyrants and masters over the  creative power. How very differently does _he_ create whose _inner_  ear is judge of the ideas which he simultaneously conceives and  criticises. This mental ear grasps and holds fast the musical visions,  and is a divine secret belonging to music alone, incomprehensible to  the layman.\"    Mozart had already learned to compose without a piano when he was only  six years old; and, as Mr. E. Holmes remarks, \"having commenced  composition without recourse to the clavier, his powers in mental  music constantly increased, and he soon imagined effects of which the  original types existed only in his brain.\"    Schumann wrote to a young musician in 1848: \"Above all things, persist  in composing mentally, without the aid of the instrument. Turn over  your melodic idea in your head until you can say to yourself: 'It is  well done.'\" Elsewhere he says: \"If you can pick out little melodies  at the piano, you will be pleased; but if they come to you  spontaneously, away from the piano, you will have more reason to be  delighted, for then the inner tone-sense is aroused to activity. The  fingers must do what the head wishes, and not _vice versa_.\" And again  he says: \"If you set out to compose, invent everything in your head.  If the music has emanated from your soul, if you have felt it, others  will feel it too.\"    Schumann had discovered the superiority of the mental method of  composing from experience. In a letter dated 1838 he writes concerning  his \"Davidstaenze:\" \"If I ever was happy at the piano it was when I  composed these pieces;\" and it was well known that up to 1839 \"he used  to compose sitting at the instrument.\" We have also just seen how  Beethoven practically composed one of his \"Fidelio\" arias at the  piano. Nor was this by any means an isolated instance. To cite only  one more case: Ries relates that one afternoon he took a walk with  Beethoven, returning at eight o'clock. \"While we were walking,\" he  continues, \"Beethoven had constantly hummed, or almost howled, up and  down the scale, without singing definite notes. When I asked him what  it was, he replied that a theme for the last allegro of the sonata had  come into his head. As soon as we entered the room, he ran to the  piano, without taking off his hat. I sat down in a corner, and he had  soon forgotten me. For at least an hour he now improvised impetuously  on the new and beautiful finale of the sonata [opus 57].\" Another of  Beethoven's contemporaries, J. Russell, has left us a vivid  description of Beethoven when thus composing at the piano, or  improvising: \"At first he only struck a few short detached chords, as  if he were afraid of being caught doing something foolish; but he soon  forgot his surroundings, and for about half an hour lost himself in an  improvisation, the style of which was exceedingly varied, and  especially distinguished by sudden transitions. The amateurs were  transported, and to the uninitiated it was interesting to observe how  his inspirations were reflected in his countenance. He revelled rather  in bold, stormy moods than in soft and gentle ones. The muscles of his  face swelled, his veins were distended, his eyes rolled wildly, his  mouth trembled convulsively, and he had the appearance of an enchanter  mastered by the spirit he had himself conjured.\"    Russell was probably one of the witnesses of whom Richard Wagner  remarked, in his essay on Beethoven, that they have testified to the  incomparable impression which Beethoven made by his improvisations at  the piano. And Wagner adds the following suggestive words: \"The  regrets that there was no way of writing down and preserving these  instantaneous creations cannot be regarded as unreasonable, even in  comparing these improvisations with the master's greatest works, if we  bear in mind the fact, taught by experience, that even _less_ gifted  musicians, whose written compositions are not free from stiffness and  inelegance, sometimes positively amaze us by the quite unexpected and  fertile inventiveness which they display while improvising.\"    A similar remark was made by De Quincey, in pointing out the  spontaneous origin of some of his essays: \"Performers on the organ,\"  he says, \"so far from finding their own _impromptu_ displays to fall  below the more careful and premeditated efforts, on the contrary have  oftentimes deep reason to mourn over the escape of inspirations and  ideas born from the momentary fervors of inspiration, but fugitive and  irrevocable as the pulses in their own flying fingers.\"    By way of illustrating this thesis a few more cases may be cited.  Mozart used to sit up late at night, improvising for hours at the  piano, and, according to one witness, \"these were the true hours of  creation of his divine melodies,\" a statement which, however, we shall  presently see reason to modify somewhat. Schubert never improvised in  public like Mozart, but only \"in the intervals of throwing on his  clothes, or at other times when the music within was too strong to be  resisted,\" as Mr. Grove remarks. What an inestimable privilege it must  have been to witness the spontaneous overflow of so rich a genius as  Schubert! And once more, Max Maria von Weber writes that his father's  improvisations on the piano were like delightful dreams. \"All who had  the good fortune to hear him,\" he says, \"testify that the impression  of his playing was like an Elysian frenzy, which elevates a man above  his sphere and makes him marvel at the glories of his own soul.\"    In reading such enthusiastic descriptions--and musical biographies are  full of them--we cannot but echo De Quincey and Wagner in regretting  that there has been no shorthand method of taking down and preserving  these wonderful improvisations of the great masters.
