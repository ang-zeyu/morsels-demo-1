(#11)"],[1,", compelled them to demand the severe punishment of  such as had done what in them lay to kindle the wrath of God against the  whole realm; that the iniquity of which they complained was so heinous  and so horrible that they should esteem themselves accomplices in it, if  they had been engaged by worldly fear, or servile complaisance, to pass  it over in silence, or bury it in oblivion: that as they owed her grace  obedience, in the administration of justice, so were they entitled to  require of her, in return, the sharp and condign punishment of this  enormity, which, they repeated it, might draw down the vengeance of God  on the whole kingdom: and that they maintained it to be her duty to lay  aside all private affections towards the actors in so heinous a crime,  and so enormous a villany, and without delay bring them to a trial,  and inflict the severest penalty upon them. The queen gave a gracious  reception to his peremptory address, but because she probably thought  that breaking the windows of a brothel merited not such severe  reprehension, she only replied, that her uncle was a stranger, and that  he was attended by a young company; but she would put such order to him  and to all others that her subjects should henceforth have no reason to  complain. Her passing over this incident so slightly was the source of  great discontent, and was regarded as a proof of the most profligate  manners.[*]         * Knox, p. 302, 303, 304. Keith, p. 509.    It is not to be omitted, that Alison Craig, the cause of all the uproar  was known to entertain a commerce with the earl of Arran, who, on  account of his great zeal for the reformation, was, without scruple,  indulged in that enormity.[*]    Some of the populace of Edinburgh broke into the queen's chapel  during her absence, and committed outrages; for which two of them were  indicted, and it was intended to bring them to a trial. Knox wrote  circular letters to the most considerable zealots of the party, and  charged them to appear in town and protect their brethren. The holy  sacraments, he there said, are abused by profane Papists; the mass has  been said; and in worshipping that idol, the priests have omitted no  ceremony, not even the conjuring of their accursed water, that had ever  been practised in the time of the greatest blindness. These violent  measures for opposing justice were little short of rebellion; and Knox  was summoned before the council to answer for his offence. The courage  of the man was equal to his insolence. He scrupled not to tell the queen  that the pestilent Papists who had inflamed her against these holy men  were the sons of the devil; and must therefore obey the directions of  their father, who had been a liar and a manslayer from the beginning.  The matter ended with the full acquittal of Knox.[**] Randolph, the  English ambassador in Scotland, had reason to write to Cecil, speaking  of the Scottish nation, \"I think marvellously of the wisdom of God, that  gave this unruly, inconstant, and cumbersome people no more power nor  substance; for they would otherwise run wild.\"[***]         * Knox.         ** Knox, p. 336, 342.         *** Keith, p. 202.    We have related these incidents at greater length than the necessity of  our subject may seem to require; but even trivial circumstances, which  show the manners of the age, are often more instructive, as well as  entertaining, than the great transactions of wars and negotiations,  which are nearly similar in all periods and in all countries of the  world.    The reformed clergy in Scotland had at that time a very natural reason  for their ill humor; namely, the poverty, or rather beggary, to which  they were reduced. The nobility and gentry had at first laid their hands  on all the property of the regular clergy, without making any provision  for the friars and nuns, whom they turned out of their possessions.  The secular clergy of the Catholic communion, though they lost all  ecclesiastical jurisdiction, still held some of the temporalities of  their benefices; and either became laymen themselves and converted them  into private property, or made conveyance of them at low prices to the  nobility, who thus enriched themselves by the plunder of the church. The  new teachers had hitherto subsisted chiefly by the voluntary oblations  of the faithful; and in a poor country, divided in religious sentiments,  this establishment was regarded as very scanty and very precarious.  Repeated applications were made for a legal settlement to the preachers;  and though almost every thing in the kingdom was governed by their  zeal and caprice, it was with difficulty that their request was at  last complied with. The fanatical spirit which they indulged, and  their industry in decrying the principles and practices of the Romish  communion, which placed such merit in enriching the clergy, proved now  a very sensible obstacle to their acquisitions. The convention, however,  passed a vote,[*] by which they divided all the ecclesiastical  benefices into twenty-one shares: they assigned fourteen to the ancient  possessors: of the remaining seven they granted three to the crown;  and if that were found to answer the public expenses, they bestowed the  overplus on the reformed ministers. The queen was empowered to levy all  the seven; and it was ordained that she should afterwards pay to the  clergy what should be judged to suffice for their maintenance. The  necessities of the crown, the rapacity of the courtiers, and the small  affection which Mary bore to the Protestant ecclesiastics, rendered  their revenues contemptible as well as uncertain; and the preachers,  finding that they could not rival the gentry, or even the middling rank  of men, in opulence and plenty, were necessitated to betake themselves  to other expedients for supporting their authority. They affected a  furious zeal for religion, morose manners, a vulgar and familiar, yet  mysterious cant; and though the liberality of subsequent princes put  them afterwards on a better footing with regard to revenue, and thereby  corrected in some degree those bad habits, it must be confessed that,  while many other advantages attend Presbyterian government, these  inconveniences are not easily separated from the genius of that  ecclesiastical polity.         * Knox, p. 296. Keith, p. 210.    The queen of Scots, destitute of all force, possessing a narrow revenue,  surrounded with a factious, turbulent nobility, a bigoted people,  and insolent ecclesiastics, soon found that her only expedient for  maintaining tranquillity was to preserve a good correspondence with  Elizabeth,[*] who, by former connections and services, had acquired such  authority over all these ranks of men.         * Jebb, vol. ii. p. 456.    Soon after her arrival in Scotland, Secretary Lidington was sent to  London, in order to pay her compliments to the queen, and express  her desire of friendship and a good correspondence; and he received  a commission from her, as well as from the nobility of Scotland, to  demand, as a means of cementing this friendship, that Mary should, by  act of parliament or by proclamation, (for the difference between these  securities was not then deemed very considerable,) be declared successor  to the crown. No request could be more unreasonable, or made at a more  improper juncture. The queen replied, that Mary had once discovered  her intention not to wait for the succession, but had openly, without  ceremony or reserve, assumed the title of Queen of England, and had  pretended a superior right to her throne and kingdom: that though her  ambassadors and those of her husband, the French king, had signed a  treaty, in which they renounced that claim, and promised satisfaction  for so great an indignity, she was so intoxicated with this imaginary  right, that she had rejected the most earnest solicitations, and  even, as some endeavored to persuade her, had incurred some danger, in  crossing the seas, rather than ratify that equitable treaty: that her  partisans every where had still the assurance to insist on her title,  and had presumed to talk of her own birth as illegitimate: that while  affairs were on this footing; while a claim thus openly made, so far  from being openly renounced, was only suspended till a more favorable  opportunity; it would in her be the most egregious imprudence to fortify  the hands of a pretender to her crown by declaring her the successor:  that no expedient could be worse imagined for cementing friendship than  such a declaration; and kings were often found to bear no good will to  their successors, even though their own children; much more when  the connection was less intimate, and when such cause of disgust and  jealousy had already been given, and indeed was still continued, on the  part of Mary: that though she was willing, from the amity which she  bore her kinswoman, to ascribe her former pretensions to the advice of  others, by whose direction she was then governed, her present refusal to  relinquish them could proceed only from her own prepossessions, and was  a proof that she still harbored some dangerous designs against her:  that it was the nature of all men to be disgusted with the present,  to entertain flattering views of futurity, to think their services ill  rewarded, to expect a better recompense from the successor; and she  should esteem herself scarcely half a sovereign over the English, if  they saw her declare her heir, and arm her rival with authority against  her own repose and safety: that she knew the inconstant nature of the  people; she was acquainted with the present divisions in religion;  she was not ignorant that the same party, which expected greater favor  during the reign of Mary, did also imagine that the title of that  princess was superior to her own: that for her part, whatever claims  were advanced, she was determined to live and die queen of England; and  after her death it "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19215"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part E. (#11)"],[1,"of instances, had lately violated them; the commons judged it requisite  to enact a new law, which might not be eluded or violated by any  interpretation, construction, or contrary precedent. Nor was it  sufficient, they thought, that the king promised to return into the way  of his predecessors. His predecessors in all times had enjoyed too much  discretionary power; and by his recent abuse of it, the whole world had  reason to see the necessity of entirely retrenching it.    The king still persevered in his endeavors to elude the petition. He  sent a letter to the house of lords, in which he went so far as to make  a particular declaration, \"That neither he nor his privy council  shall or will, at any time hereafter, commit or command to prison, or  otherwise restrain, any man for not lending money, or for any other  cause which, in his conscience,[**joined-up though no hyphen] he thought  not to concern the public good, and the safety of king and people.\" And  he further declared, \"That he never would be guilty of so base an action  as to pretend any cause of whose truth he was not fully satisfied.\"[***]  But this promise, though enforced to the commons by the recommendation  of the upper house, made no more impression than all the former  messages.         * State Trials, vol. vii. p. 193.         ** State Trials, vol. vii. p. 196. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 556           *** State Trials, vol. vii. p. 198. Rushworth, vol. i. p.       560, Parl. Hist. vol. viii. p. 111.    Among the other evasions of the king, we may reckon the proposal of  the house of peers, to subjoin to the intended petition of right the  following clause: \"We humbly present this petition to your majesty, not  only with a care of preserving our own liberties, but with due regard to  leave entire that sovereign power with which your majesty is intrusted  for the protection, safety, and happiness of your people.\"[*] Less  penetration than was possessed by the leaders of the house of commons,  could easily discover how captious this clause was, and how much it was  calculated to elude the whole force of the petition.    These obstacles, therefore, being surmounted, the petition of right  passed the commons, and was sent to the upper house.[**] [2] The peers,  who were probably well pleased in secret that all their solicitations  had been eluded by the commons, quickly passed the petition without any  material alteration; and nothing but the royal assent was wanting to  give it the force of a law. The king accordingly came to the house of  peers; sent for the commons; and, being seated in his chair of state,  the petition was read to him. Great was now the astonishment of all men,  when, instead of the usual concise and clear form by which a bill is  either confirmed or rejected Charles said, in answer to the petition,  \"The king willeth, that right be done according to the laws and customs  of the realm, and that the statutes be put into execution; that his  subjects may have no cause to complain of any wrong or oppression,  contrary to their just rights and liberties, to the preservation whereof  he holds himself in conscience as much obliged as of his own  prerogative.\"[***]         * State Trials, vol. vii. p. 199.

Rushworth, vol. i. p.       500.    It is surprising that Charles, who had seen so many instances of the  jealousy of the commons, who had himself so much roused that jealousy  by his frequent evasive messages during this session, could imagine that  they would rest satisfied with an answer so vague and undeterminate. It  was evident, that the unusual form alone of the answer must excite their  attention; that the disappointment must inflame their anger; and that  therefore it was necessary, as the petition seemed to bear hard on royal  prerogative, to come early to some fixed resolution, either gracefully  to comply with it, or courageously to reject it.    It happened as might have been foreseen. The commons returned in very  ill humor. Usually, when in that disposition, their zeal for religion,  and their enmity against the unfortunate Catholics, ran extremely high.  But they had already, in the beginning of the session, presented their  petition of religion and had received a satisfactory answer; though they  expected that the execution of the laws against Papists would, for the  future, be no more exact and rigid than they had hitherto found it.  To give vent to their present indignation, they fell with their utmost  force on Dr. Manwaring.    There is nothing which tends more to excuse, if not to justify,  the extreme rigor of the commons towards Charles, than his open  encouragement and avowal of such general principles as were altogether  incompatible with a limited government. Manwaring had preached a sermon  which the commons found, upon inquiry, to be printed by special command  of the king;[*] and when this sermon was looked into, it contained  doctrines subversive of all civil liberty. It taught, that, though  property was commonly lodged in the subject, yet, whenever any exigency  required supply, all property was transferred to the sovereign; that the  consent of parliament was not necessary for the imposition of taxes;  and that the divine laws required compliance with every demand, how  irregular soever, which the prince should make upon his subjects[**] For  these doctrines the commons impeached Manwaring. The sentence pronounced  upon him by the peers was, that he should be imprisoned during the  pleasure of the house, be fined a thousand pounds to the king, make  submission and acknowledgment of his offence, be suspended during three  years, be incapable of holding any ecclesiastical dignity or secular  office, and that his book be called in and burnt.[***]         * Parliament.

Hist. vol. viii. p. 212.    It may be worthy of notice, that no sooner was the session ended, than  this man, so justly obnoxious to both houses received a pardon, and was  promoted to a living of considerable value.[*] Some years after, he was  raised to the see of St. Asaph. If the republican spirit of the commons  increased beyond all reasonable bounds, the monarchical spirit of the  court, this latter, carried to so high a pitch, tended still further to  augment the former. And thus extremes were every where affected, and the  just medium was gradually deserted by all men.    From Manwaring, the house of commons proceeded to censure the conduct  of Buckingham, whose name hitherto they had cautiously forborne to  mention.[**] In vain did the king send them a message, in which he told  them that the session was drawing near to a conclusion; and desired that  they would not enter upon new business, nor cast any aspersions on his  government and ministry.[***] Though the court endeavored to explain and  soften this message by a subsequent message,[****] as Charles was apt  hastily to correct any hasty step which he had taken, it served  rather to inflame than appease the commons; as if the method of their  proceedings had here been prescribed to them. It was foreseen that a  great tempest was ready to burst on the duke; and in order to divert  it, the king thought proper, upon a joint application of the lords and  commons,[v] to endeavor giving them satisfaction with regard to the  petition of right. He came, therefore, to the house of peers, and  pronouncing the usual form of words, \"Let it be law, as is desired,\"  gave full sanction and authority to the petition. The acclamations  with which the house resounded, and the universal joy diffused over the  nation, showed how much this petition had been the object of all men's  vows and expectations[v*]         * Rushworth, vol. i. p. 635. Whitlocke, p. 11.         ** Rushworth, vol. i. p. 607.         *** Rushworth, vol. i. p. 605.         **** Rushworth, vol. i. p. 610. Parl.

It may be affirmed, without any exaggeration, that the king's assent to  the petition of right produced such a change in the government, as was  almost equivalent to a revolution; and by circumscribing, in so  many articles, the royal prerogative gave additional security to the  liberties of the subject. Yet were the commons far from being satisfied  with this important concession. Their ill humor had been so much  irritated by the king's frequent evasions and delays, that it could not  be presently appeased by an assent which he allowed to be so reluctantly  extorted from him. Perhaps, too, the popular leaders, implacable and  artful, saw the opportunity favorable; and, turning against the king  those very weapons with which he had furnished them, resolved to pursue  the victory. The bill, however, for five subsidies, which had been  formerly voted, immediately passed the house; because the granting of  that supply was, in a manner, tacitly contracted for, upon the royal  assent to the petition; and had faith been here violated, no further  confidence could have subsisted between king and parliament. Having  made this concession, the commons continued to carry their scrutiny  into every part of government. In some particulars, their industry was  laudable; in some, it may be liable to censure.    A little after writs were issued for summoning this parliament, a  commission had been granted to Sir Thomas Coventry, lord keeper, the  earl of Marlborough, treasurer, the earl of Manchester, president of the  council, the earl of Worcester, privy seal, the duke of Buckingham, high  admiral, and"]]]
