[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14291"],[0,"The Story of Geographical Discovery: How the World Became Known (#11)"],[1," have answered the latter question when dealing with  the progress of conquest, but men did not conquer merely for the  sake of conquest. We have still to consider the material advantages  attaching to warfare. Again when men go on their wars of discovery,  they have to progress, for the most part, along paths already beaten  for them by the natives of the country they intend to conquer; and  often when they have succeeded in warfare, they have to consolidate  their rule by creating new and more appropriate means of communication.  To put it shortly, we have still to discuss the roads of the ancient  and mediaeval worlds, and the commerce for which those roads were  mainly used.    A road may be, for our purposes, most readily defined as the most  convenient means of communication between two towns; and this logically  implies that the towns existed before the roads were made; and in a  fuller investigation of any particular roads, it will be necessary  to start by investigating why men collect their dwellings at certain  definite spots. In the beginning, assemblies of men were made chiefly  or altogether for defensive purposes, and the earliest towns were  those which, from their natural position, like Athens or Jerusalem,  could be most easily defended. Then, again, religious motives often  had their influence in early times, and towns would grow round temples  or cloisters. But soon considerations of easy accessibility rule in  the choice of settlements, and for that purpose towns on rivers,  especially at fords of rivers, as Westminster, or in well-protected  harbours like Naples, or in the centre of a district, as Nuremberg  or Vienna, would form the most convenient places of meeting for  exchange of goods. Both on a river, or on the sea-shore, the best  means of communication would be by ships or boats; but once such  towns had been established, it would be necessary to connect them  with one another by land routes, and these would be determined  chiefly by the lie of the land. Where mountains interfered, a large  detour would have to be made--as, for example, round the Pyrenees;  if rivers intervened, fords would have to be sought for, and a new  town probably built at the most convenient place of passage. When  once a recognised way had been found between any two places, the  conservative instincts of man would keep it in existence, even  though a better route were afterwards found.    The influence of water communication is of paramount importance  in determining the situation of towns in early times. Towns in  the corners of bays, like Archangel, Riga, Venice, Genoa, Naples,  Tunis, Bassorah, Calcutta, would naturally be the centre-points  of the trade of the bay. On rivers a suitable spot would be where  the tides ended, like London, or at conspicuous bends of a stream,  or at junctures with affluents, as Coblentz or Khartoum. One nearly  always finds important towns at the two ends of a peninsula, like  Hamburg and Lubeck, Venice and Genoa; though for naval purposes  it is desirable to have a station at the head of the peninsula,  to command both arms of the sea, as at Cherbourg, Sevastopol, or  Gibraltar. Roads would then easily be formed across the base of  the peninsula, and to its extreme point.    At first the inhabitants of any single town would regard those  of all others as their enemies, but after a time they would find  it convenient to exchange some of their superfluities for those  of their neighbours, and in this way trade would begin. Markets  would become neutral ground, in which mutual animosities would  be, for a time, laid aside for the common advantage; and it would  often happen that localities on the border line of two states would  be chosen as places for the exchange of goods, ultimately giving  rise to the existence of a fresh town. As commercial intercourse  increased, the very inaccessibility of fortress towns on the heights  would cause them to be neglected for settlements in the valleys or  by the river sides, and, as a rule, roads pick out valleys or level  ground for their natural course. For military purposes, however, it  would sometimes be necessary to depart from the valley routes,  and, as we shall see, the Roman roads paid no regard to these  requirements.    The earliest communication between nations, as we have seen, was  that of the Phoenicians by sea. They founded factories, or neutral  grounds for trade, at appropriate spots all along the Mediterranean  coasts, and the Greeks soon followed their example in the AEgean  and Black Seas. But at an early date, as we know from the Bible,  caravan routes were established between Egypt, Syria, and Mesopotamia,  and later on these were extended into Farther Asia. But in Europe  the great road-builders were the Romans. Rome owed its importance  in the ancient world to its central position, at first in Italy,  and then in the whole of the Mediterranean. It combined almost  all the advantages necessary for a town: it was in the bend of  a river, yet accessible from the sea; its natural hills made it  easily defensible, as Hannibal found to his cost; while its central  position in the Latian Plain made it the natural resort of all  the Latin traders. The Romans soon found it necessary to utilise  their central position by rendering themselves accessible to the  rest of Italy, and they commenced building those marvellous roads,  which in most cases have remained, owing to their solid construction.  \"Building\" is the proper word to use, for a Roman road is really a  broad wall built in a deep ditch so as to come up above the level  of the surface. Scarcely any amount of traffic could wear this  solid substructure away, and to this day throughout Europe traces  can be found of the Roman roads built nearly two thousand years  ago. As the Roman Empire extended, these roads formed one of the  chief means by which the lords of the world were enabled to preserve  their conquests. By placing a legion in a central spot, where many  of these roads converged, they were enabled to strike quickly in  any direction and overawe the country. Stations were naturally  built along these roads, and to the present day many of the chief  highways of Europe follow the course of the old Roman roads. Our  modern civilisation is in a large measure the outcome of this network  of roads, and we can distinctly trace a difference in the culture of  a nation where such roads never existed--as in Russia and Hungary,  as contrasted with the west of Europe, where they formed the best  means of communication. It was only in the neighbourhood of these  highways that the fullest information was obtained of the position  of towns, and the divisions of peoples; and a sketch map like the  one already given, of the chief Roman roads of antiquity, gives  also, as it were, a skeleton of the geographical knowledge summed  up in the great work of Ptolemy.    But of more importance for the future development of geographical  knowledge were the great caravan routes of Asia, to which we must  now turn our attention. Asia is the continent of plateaux which  culminate in the Steppes of the Pamirs, appropriately called by  their inhabitants \"the Roof of the World.\" To the east of these,  four great mountain ranges run, roughly, along the parallels of  latitude--the Himalayas to the south, the Kuen-Iun, Thian Shan,  and Altai to the north. Between the Himalayas and the Kuen-lun is  the great Plateau of Tibet, which runs into a sort of cul-de-sac  at its western end in Kashmir. Between the Kuen-lun and the Thian  Shan we have the Gobi Steppe of Mongolia, running west of Kashgar  and Yarkand; while between the Thian Shan and the Altai we have  the great Kirghiz Steppe. It is clear that only two routes are  possible between Eastern and Western Asia: that between the Kuen-lun  and the Thian Shan via Kashgar and Bokhara, and that south of the  Altai, skirting the north of the great lakes Balkash, Aral, and  Caspian, to the south of Russia. The former would lead to Bassorah  or Ormuz, and thence by sea, or overland, round Arabia to Alexandria;  the latter and longer route would reach Europe via Constantinople.  Communication between Southern Asia and Europe would mainly be  by sea, along the coast of the Indies, taking advantage of the  monsoons from Ceylon to Aden, and then by the Red Sea. Alexandria,  Bassorah, and Ormuz would thus naturally be the chief centres of  Eastern trade, while communication with the Mongols or with China  would go along the two routes above mentioned, which appear to have  existed during all historic time. It was by these latter routes  that the Polos and the other mediaeval travellers to Cathay reached  that far-distant country. But, as we know from Marco Polo's travels,  China could also be reached by the sea voyage; and for all practical  purposes, in the late Middle Ages, when the Mongol empire broke  up, and traffic through mid Asia was not secure, communication  with the East was via Alexandria.    Now it is important for our present inquiry to realise how largely  Europe after the Crusades was dependent on the East for most of the  luxuries of life. Nothing produced by the looms of Europe could  equal the silk of China, the calico of India, the muslin of Mussul.  The chief gems which decorated the crowns of kings and nobles,  the emerald, the topaz, the ruby, the diamond, all came from the  East--mainly from India. The whole of mediaeval medical science was  derived from the Arabs, who sought most of their drugs from Arabia  or India. Even for the incense which burned upon the innumerable  altars of Roman Catholic Europe, merchants had to seek the materials  in the Levant. For many of the more refined handicrafts, artists had  to seek their best material from Eastern traders: such as shellac  for varnish, or mastic for artists' colours (gamboge from Cambodia,  ultramarine from lapis lazuli); while it was often necessary, under  mediaeval"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14293"],[0,"The Complete Book of Cheese (#11)"],[1," salt  Dash of cayenne  1 egg, lightly beaten  2 tablespoons canned tomato juice  Water cress         Cook pepper and onion lightly in butter, add tomato pulp and cook       5 minutes before putting over boiling water and stirring steadily       as you add cheese and seasonings. Moisten the egg with the tomato       juice and stir in until the Rabbit is thick and velvety.         Serve on toast and dress with water cress.    This popular modern Rabbit seems to be a twin to Rum Tum Tiddy in  spite of the centuries' difference in age.       Fluffy, Eggy Rabbit         Stir up a Chilaly as above, but use 2 well-beaten eggs to make it       more fluffy, and leave out the watercress. Serve it hot over cold       slices of hard-cooked eggs crowded flat on hot buttered toast, to       make it extra eggy.       Grilled Tomato Rabbit         Slice big, red, juicy tomatoes 1/2-inch thick, season with salt,       pepper and plenty of brown sugar. Dot both sides with all the       butter that won't slip off.         Heat in moderate oven, and when almost cooked, remove and broil       on both sides. Put on hot plates in place of the usual toast and       pour the Rabbit over them. (The Rabbit is made according to       either Basic Recipe No. 1 or No. 2.)         Slices of crisp bacon on top of the tomato slices and a touch of       horseradish help.       Grilled Tomato and Onion Rabbit         Slice 1/4-inch thick an equal number of tomato and onion rings.       Season with salt, pepper, brown sugar and dots of butter. Heat in       moderate oven, and when almost cooked remove and broil lightly.         On hot plates lay first the onion rings, top with the tomato ones       and pour the Rabbit over, as in the plain Grilled Tomato recipe       above.    For another onion-flavored Rabbit see Celery and Onion Rabbit.       The Devil's Own (_a fresh tomato variant_)    2 tablespoons butter  1 large peeled tomato in 4 thick slices  2-1/2 cups grated cheese  1/4 teaspoon English mustard  A pinch of cayenne  A dash of tabasco sauce  2 tablespoons chili sauce  1/2 cup ale or beer  1 egg, lightly beaten         Saute tomato slices lightly on both sides in 1 tablespoon butter.       Keep warm on hot platter while you make the toast and a Basic       Rabbit, pepped up by the extra-hot seasonings listed above. Put       hot tomato slices on hot toast on hot plates; pour the hot       mixture over.       Dried Beef or Chipped Beef Rabbit    1 tablespoon butter  1 cup canned tomato, drained, chopped and de-seeded  1/4 pound dried beef, shredded  2 eggs, lightly beaten  1/4 teaspoon pepper  2 cups grated cheese         Heat tomato in butter, add beef and eggs, stir until mixed well,       then sprinkle with pepper, stir in the grated cheese until smooth       and creamy. Serve on toast.    No salt is needed on this jerked steer meat that is called both dried  beef and chipped beef on this side of the border, _tasajo_ on the  other side, and _xarque_ when you get all the way down to Brazil.       Kansas Jack Rabbit    1 cup milk  3 tablespoons butter  3 tablespoons flour  2 cups grated cheese  1 cup cream-style corn  Salt and pepper         Make a white sauce of milk, butter and flour and stir in cheese       steadily and gradually until melted. Add corn and season to       taste. Serve on hot buttered toast.    Kansas has plenty of the makings for this, yet the dish must have been  easier to make on Baron Muenchhausen's \"Island of Cheese,\" where the  cornstalks produced loaves of bread, ready-made, instead of ears, and  were no doubt crossed with long-eared jacks to produce Corn Rabbits  quite as miraculous.    After tomatoes, in popularity, come onions and then green peppers or  canned pimientos as vegetable ingredients in modern, Americanized  Rabbits. And after that, corn, as in the following recipe which  appeals to all Latin-Americans from Mexico to Chile because it has  everything.       Latin-American Corn Rabbit    2 tablespoons butter  1 green pepper, chopped  1 large onion, chopped  1/2 cup condensed tomato soup  3 cups grated cheese  1 teaspoon salt  1/4 teaspoon black pepper  1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce  1 cup canned corn  1 egg, lightly beaten         Fry pepper and onion 5 minutes in butter; add soup, cover and       cook 5 minutes more. Put over boiling water; add cheese with       seasonings and stir steadily, slowly adding the corn, and when       thoroughly blended and creamy, moisten the egg with a little of       the liquid, stir in until thickened and then pour over hot toast       or crackers.       Mushroom-Tomato Rabbit         In one pan commence frying in butter 1 cup of sliced fresh       mushrooms, and in another make a Rabbit by melting over boiling       water 2 cups of grated cheese with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2       teaspoon paprika. Stir steadily and, when partially melted, stir       in a can of condensed tomato soup, previously heated. Then add       the fried mushrooms slowly, stir until creamy and pour over hot       toast or crackers.       Celery and Onion Rabbit    1/2 cup chopped hearts of celery  1 small onion, chopped  1 tablespoon butter  1-1/2 cups grated sharp cheese  Salt and pepper         In a separate pan boil celery and onion until tender. Meanwhile,       melt cheese with butter and seasonings and stir steadily. When       nearly done stir the celery and onion in gradually, until smooth       and creamy.         Pour over buttered toast and brown with a salamander or under the       grill.       Asparagus Rabbit         Make as above, substituting a cupful of tender sliced asparagus       tops for the celery and onion.       Oyster Rabbit    2 dozen oysters and their liquor  1 teaspoon butter  2 eggs, lightly beaten  1 large pinch of salt  1 small pinch of cayenne  3 cups grated cheese         Heat oysters until edges curl and put aside to keep warm while       you proceed to stir up a Rabbit. When cheese is melted add the       eggs with some of the oyster liquor and keep stirring. When the       Rabbit has thickened to a smooth cream, drop in the warm oysters       to heat a little more, and serve on hot buttered toast.       Sea-food Rabbits         _(crab, lobster, shrimp, scallops, clams, mussels, abalone,       squid, octopi; anything that swims in the sea or crawls on the       bottom of the ocean)_         Shred, flake or mince a cupful of any freshly cooked or canned       sea food and save some of the liquor, if any. Make according to       Oyster Rabbit recipe above.         Instead of using only one kind of sea food, try several, mixed       according to taste. Spike this succulent Sea Rabbit with       horseradish or a dollop of sherry, for a change.       \"Bouquet of the Sea\" Rabbit         The seafaring Portuguese set the style for this lush bouquet of       as many different kinds of cooked fish (tuna, cod, salmon, etc.)       as can be sardined together in the whirlpool of melted cheese in       the chafing dish. They also accent it with tidbits of sea food as       above.       Other Fish Rabbit, Fresh or Dried         Any cooked fresh fish, flaked or shredded, from the alewife to       the whale, or cooked dried herring, finnan haddie, mackerel, cod,       and so on, can be stirred in to make a basic Rabbit more tasty.       Happy combinations are hit upon in mixing leftovers of several       kinds by the cupful. So the odd old cookbook direction, \"Add a       cup of fish,\" takes on new meaning.       Grilled Sardine Rabbit         Make a Basic Rabbit and pour it over sardines, skinned, boned,       halved and grilled, on buttered toast.         Similarly cooked fillets of any small fish will make as succulent       a grilled Rabbit.       Roe Rabbits         Slice cooked roe of shad or toothsome eggs of other fish, grill       on toast, butter well and pour a Basic Rabbit over. Although shad       roe is esteemed the finest, there are many other sapid ones of       salmon, herring, flounder, cod, etc.       Plain Sardine Rabbit         Make Basic Rabbit with only 2 cups of cheese, and in place of the       egg yolks and beer, stir in a large tin of sardines, skinned,       boned and flaked.       Anchovy Rabbit         Make Basic Rabbit, add 1 tablespoon of imported East Indian       chutney with the egg yolks and beer at the finish, spread toast       thickly with anchovy paste and butter, and pour the Rabbit over.       Smoked sturgeon, whiting, eel, smoked salmon, and the like         Lay cold slices or flakes of any fine smoked fish (and all of       them are fine) on hot buttered toast and pour a Basic Rabbit over       the fish.         The best combination we ever tasted is made by laying a thin       slice of smoked salmon over a thick one of smoked sturgeon.       Smoked Cheddar Rabbit         With or without smoked fish, Rabbit-hunters whose palates crave       the savor of a wisp of smoke go for a Basic Rabbit made with       smoked Cheddar in place of the usual aged, but unsmoked, Cheddar.       We use a two-year-old that Phil Alpert, Mr. Cheese himself,       brings down from Canada and has specially smoked in the same       savory room where sturgeon is getting the works. So his Cheddar       absorbs the de luxe flavor of six-dollar-per-pound sturgeon and       is sold for a fraction of that.         And just in case you are fishing around for something extra       special, serve this smoky Rabbit on oven-browned Bombay ducks,       those crunchy flat toasts of East Indian fish.         Or go Oriental by accompanying this with cups of smoky Lapsang       Soochong China tea.       Crumby Rabbit    1 tablespoon butter  2 cups grated cheese  1 cup stale bread crumbs    soaked with  1 cup milk  1 egg, lightly beaten  Salt  Cayenne  Toasted crackers         Melt cheese in butter, stir in the soaked crumbs and seasonings.       When cooked smooth and creamy, stir in the egg to thicken the       mixture and serve on toasted crackers, dry or"]]]
