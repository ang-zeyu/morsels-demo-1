This is not merely because the  majority of people do not go to church, but because of the general  temper of society and standards of morality. Most people would affirm  some sort of belief in God, but are unable to relate it to their daily  lives.    It may be a matter of argument that morality is dependent on religion,  but the structure of western society and our codes of behaviour have, in  fact, been based upon the Christian faith. If this faith is not  generally accepted, the standard of conduct associated with it must  deteriorate.    Signs are not lacking that people are turning away from a purely  materialistic conception of life, and seeking a more spiritual basis for  conduct.    The recent disclosures in the Hutt Valley indicate a largely nominal  church affiliation in most of the cases under review. Although it was  stated that thirty-six per cent of the offenders attended church or  Sunday School regularly, and that sixty-four per cent had never attended  or had ceased to attend, closer examination of the individual cases  would be required before any deduction could be drawn from the figures  given to the Committee. It is, however, safe to assume that there was  little religious teaching; and it is unfortunately true that there was a  failure to observe moral standards. The acceptance of the Christian  position cannot fail to promote good conduct in all fields including the  relationship between the sexes.      =(2) The Need for Religious Instruction=    The Committee considers that the Nelson system of religious teaching in  schools should be encouraged and developed. In so far as the basic  philosophy of education in New Zealand may not be religious, the  Committee notes that a conference between the Department of Education  and the New Zealand Council for Christian Education is being arranged.    Church activities among youth affected were criticized on the grounds  that they appealed only to the \"good boys and girls\", or to those who  already belong to a church. This situation presents a challenge which  needs to be met, and it will demand, in particular, a consideration of  how young people are to be encouraged to spend their time on Sundays.      =(3) The Need for Family Religion=    As family life is vital in this inquiry something must be said about  religion in the home. It is clear that, other things being equal, a home  with a real religious atmosphere is a good safeguard against immorality,  and a sound background for moral teaching, particularly for the  development of knowledge about sex.    The practice of family religion is to be strongly endorsed.          _XIII. The Family, Religion, and Morality_      =(1) The Importance of the Family=    From all that has been above written it will be seen that there is not  any one cause of the sexual delinquency among children which has  provoked this inquiry. There are many predisposing and precipitating  causes. If there be any common denominator in the majority of cases  studied by the Committee it is lack of appreciation by parents of their  personal responsibility for the upbringing and behaviour of their  children or, if they do appreciate their responsibility, they are unable  to guide them correctly and to maintain control of them. This finding is  in harmony with the current of public opinion expressed in the  statements that \"it all comes back to the parents\" or \"the parents are  to blame\". That much cannot be gainsaid.    But what is the root cause of this failure or inability on the part of  present-day parents? This is an aspect of its assignment to which the  Committee has paid great attention.    It should be made quite plain that the Committee does not subscribe to  the view that the sexual immorality which has recently been brought to  notice is entirely of the pattern which prevailed in former generations.  Nor can the Committee be content with platitudinous recommendations as  to how this immorality among young persons may be kept in check within  the existing processes of the law. It is the view of the Committee that  during the past few decades there have been changes in certain aspects  of family life throughout the English-speaking world leading to a  decline in morality as it has generally been understood. A remedy must  be found before this decline leads to the decay of the family itself as  the centre and core of our national life and culture.      =(2) The Place of the Family in the Legal System=    The emphasis which the Committee places upon this section of its report  calls for a statement of the place of the family in English law.    The family (meaning thereby the father, mother, and children) from time  immemorial has had a definite and recognized status in our national  life--a place which it has not always occupied or enjoyed in other  cultures and other systems of law. There is in our culture an air of  sanctity about the home where parents and children dwell. The rights of  a parent against any intrusion into his family affairs have been  expressed in such statements as \"A man's house is his castle\".    Our law of domestic relations centres upon the home. When the  Legislature or the law-courts have interfered in the conduct of a home  it has only been because one member of the family has failed to  discharge the duties which an individual is required to perform towards  other members of the family or towards society. Speaking generally, the  rights and duties of individual members of the family have been  preserved and enforced in our statute law. Illustrations are to be found  in the Infants Act, the Destitute Persons Act, the Child Welfare Act,  the Family Protection Act, and the Joint Family Homes Act.    The policy of English law is, and always has been, to keep the family  together and to uphold the rights of parents. Those rights have  correlative duties attaching to them. It is the failure of some parents  to perform those duties which has now become a matter of grave concern.    The irony of the situation is that this slipping of parental  responsibility has occurred contemporaneously with the granting of  financial and other help to parents. Family allowances and State homes  should be concomitants of an increased sense of responsibility. Despite  all that the State has done, and is doing, for families, the moral  standards of the community have somehow been undermined. Is this because  of a general lowering of the moral standards of adults? Is the attitude  of children towards sexual matters a direct reflection of the thoughts  and conduct of their elders? To borrow the words of a Jewish proverb  \"the apple never falls far from the tree\". It has been firmly urged upon  the Committee that there has been a \"breakdown of the moral order and  moral standards\". That may be putting the matter too strongly, but there  can be no denying the fact that the sanctions of morality today are not  as strong as they were, say, forty or fifty years ago.      =(3) The Sanctions of Religion and Morality in Family Life=    Up till early in this century the chief sanctions operating in society  were those dictated either by religion or by wisdom and past experience,  i.e., religious sanctions and moral sanctions. The standard of religious  morality is that which is prescribed in the Bible, interpreted perhaps  in different ways by different denominations at different times. The  standard of conventional morality is that which has been handed down  from generation to generation. There have at times been differences  between the religious standard and the conventional standard. For  instance, the Church has always reprobated adultery, but even as late as  the nineteenth century society accepted, without very much concern, the  conduct of a man who had both a legal wife and a mistress. Despite those  occasional differences between the religious standard and the  conventional standard, our system of morals has been based on the  standards of Christianity.      =(4) The Moral Drift=    During last century it was strongly urged by some scientists that a  religion based on faith was untenable. Man, it was contended, should  accept only what could be proved by reasoning from observed facts. Once  again there emerged, particularly in scientific and literary circles,  the belief that there could be a code of morals entirely devoid of  religious content.    This intellectual standpoint helped to undermine the authority of the  churches. The views of the scientists were not the cause of, but  undoubtedly did accelerate, the drift from organized religion.    There is evidence of the effects of beliefs developed during the present  century in another field of learning, that of psychology. On the one  hand, it is held that there was in former days suppression of the  natural development of human personality and, on the other, that a great  deal of misery has been caused by feelings of guilt. Ill health, even  mental illness, has been attributed to these two factors.    Between the two world wars much of the material of the new psychologists  began to drift into circulation in so-called popular editions. Doubtless  much of the writing was from reputable sources, but the new views, good  in origin, began to suffer as had religious faith in the past from poor  exponents.    A desire for scientific accuracy is understandable, a wish to understand  the working of the human mind wholly commendable, but many people whose  loose behaviour was instinctive, rather than inspired, now had  apologists for their conduct. The moral drift had become moral chaos.          _XIV.

DO N'T KILL THE BIRDS.    1. Do n't kill the birds! the little birds,  That sing about your door  Soon as the joyous Spring has come,  And chilling storms are o'er.    2. The little birds! how sweet they sing!  Oh, let them joyous live;  And do not seek to take the life  Which you can never give.    3. Do n't kill the birds! the pretty birds,  That play among the trees;     144  ECLECTIC SERIES.    For earth would be a cheerless place,  If it were not for these.    4.

Do n't kill the birds! the happy birds,  That bless the field and grove;  So innocent to look upon,  They claim our warmest love.    6.

Though \"No\" is a very little word, it is not always easy  to say it; and the not doing so, often causes trouble.     THIRD READER.  145  2. When we are asked to stay away from school, and  spend in idleness or mischief the time which ought to be  spent in study, we should at once say \"No.\"  3. When we are urged to loiter on our way to school, and  thus be late, and interrupt our teacher and the school, we  should say \"No.\" When some schoolmate wishes us to  whisper or play in the schoolroom, we should say \"No.\"  4. When we are tempted to use angry or wicked words, we  should remember that the eye of God is always upon us, and  should say \"No.\"  5. When we have done anything wrong, and are tempted  to conceal it by falsehood, we should say \"No, we can not  tell a lie; it is wicked and cowardly.\"  6. If we are asked to do anything which we know to be  wrong, we should not fear to say \"No.\"  7. If we thus learn to say \"No,\" we shall avoid much  trouble, and be always safe.        3.10.    146  ECLECTIC SERIES.  LESSON LVII.  WHICH LOVED BEST?    \"I love you, mother,\" said little John;  Then, forgetting work, his cap went on,  And he was off to the garden swing,  Leaving his mother the wood to bring.      2.  \"I love you, mother,\" said rosy Nell;  \"I love you better than tongue can tell;\"     THIRD READER.  147    Then she teased and pouted full half the day,  Till her mother rejoiced when she went to play.    3.  \"I love you, mother,\" said little Fan;   \"To-day I'll help you all I can;  How glad I am that school does n't keep!\"  So she rocked the baby till it fell asleep.    4.  Then, stepping softly, she took the broom,  And swept the floor, and dusted the room;  Busy and happy all day was she,  Helpful and cheerful as child could be.    5.  \"I love you, mother,\" again they said--  Three little children going to bed;  How do you think that mother guessed  Which of them really loved her best?

The  thought that they were his own work delighted him.  2. Tom Austin, one of his playmates, thought a toy was  worth nothing unless it cost a great deal of money. He never  tried to make anything, but bought all his toys.     148  ECLECTIC SERIES.  3. \"Come and look at my horse,\" said he, one day. \"It cost  a dollar, and it is such a beauty! Come and see it.\"  4. John was soon admiring his friend's    horse; and he was examining it carefully, to see how it was  made. The same evening he began to make one for himself.  5. He went into the wood shed, and picked     THIRD READER.  149  out two pieces of wood--one for the head of his horse, the  other for the body. It took him two or three days to shape  them to his satisfaction.  6. His father gave him a bit of red leather for a bridle, and  a few brass nails, and his mother found a bit of old fur with  which he made a mane and tail for his horse.  7. But what about the wheels? This puzzled him. At last  he thought he would go to a turner's shop, and see if he could  not get some round pieces of wood which might suit his  purpose.  8. He found a large number of such pieces among the  shavings on the floor, and asked permission to take a few of  them. The turner asked him what he wanted them for, and he  told him about his horse.  9. \"Oh,\" said the man, laughing, \"if you wish it, I will  make some wheels for your horse. But mind, when it is  finished, you must let me see it.\"  10. John promised to do so, and he soon ran home with  the wheels in his pocket. The next evening, he went to the  turner's shop with his horse all complete, and was told that  he was an ingenious little fellow    150  ECLECTIC SERIES.  11. Proud of this compliment, he ran to his friend Tom,  crying, \"Now then, Tom, here is my horse,--look!\"  12. \"Well, that is a funny horse,\" said Tom; \"where did  you buy it?\" \"I did n't buy it,\" replied John; I made it.\"  13. \"You made it yourself! Oh, well, it's a good horse for  you to make. But it is not so good as mine. Mine cost a  dollar, and yours did n't cost anything.\"  14. \"It was real fun to make it, though,\" said John, and  away he ran with his horse rolling after him.  15. Do you want to know what became of John? Well, I  will tell you. He studied hard in school, and was called the  best scholar in his class. When he left school, he went to  work in a machine shop. He is now a master workman, and  will soon have a shop of his own.       THIRD READER.  151    LESSON LIX.    PERSEVERE.    1.

Mr. Lenox was one morning riding by himself. He got off  from his horse to look at something on the roadside. The  horse broke away from him, and ran off. Mr. Lenox ran after  him, but soon found that he could not catch him.  A little boy at work in a field near the road, heard the  horse. As soon as he saw him running from his master, the  boy ran     152  ECLECTIC SERIES.    very quickly to the middle of the road, and, catching the  horse by thc bridle, stopped him till Mr. Lenox came up.  Mr. Lenox. Thank you, my good boy, you have caught my  horse very nicely. What shall I give you for your trouble?  Boy. I want nothing, sir.  Mr. L. You want nothing? So much the better for you.  Few men can say as much. But what were you doing in the  field?  B. I was rooting up weeds, and tending the sheep that  were feeding on turnips.  Mr. L. Do you like to work?  B. Yes, sir, very well, this fine weather.  Mr. L. But would you not rather play?  B. This is not hard work. It is almost as good as play.  Mr. L. Who set you to work?  B. My father, sir.  Mr. L. What is your name?  B. Peter Hurdle, sir.  Mr. L. How old are you?  B. Eight years old, next June.  Mr. L. How long have you been here?  B. Ever since six o'clock this morning.  Mr. L. Are you not hungry?  B. Yes, sir, but I shall go to dinner soon.     THIRD READER.  153    Mr. L. If you had a dime now, what would you do with it?  B. I do n't know, sir. I never had so much.  Mr. L. Have you no playthings?     154  ECLECTIC SERIES.  B. Playthings? What are they?  Mr. L. Such things as ninepins, marbles, tops, and wooden  horses.  B. No, sir. Tom and I play at football in winter, and I have  a jumping rope. I had a hoop, but it is broken.  Mr. L. Do you want nothing else?  B. I have hardly time to play with what I have. I have to  drive the cows, and to run on errands, and to ride the horses  to the fields, and that is as good as play.  Mr. L. You could get apples and cakes, if you had money,  you know.  B. I can have apples at home. As for cake, I do not want  that. My mother makes me a pie now and then, which is as  good.  Mr. L. Would you not like a knife to cut sticks?  B. I have one. Here it is. Brother Tom gave it to me.  Mr. L. Your shoes are full of holes. Do n't you want a new  pair?  B. I have a better pair for Sundays.  Mr. L. But these let in water.  B. I do not mind that, sir.  Mr. L. Your hat is all torn, too.  B. I have a better one at home.     THIRD READER.  155  Mr. L. What do yon do when it rains?  B. If it rains very hard when I am in the field, I get under a  tree for shelter.  Mr. L. What do you do, if you are hungry before it is time  to go home?  B. I sometimes eat a raw turnip.  Mr. L. But if there is none?  B. Then I do as well as I can without. I work on, and never  think of it.  Mr. L. Why, my little fellow, I am glad to see that you are  so contented. Were you ever at school?  B. No, sir. But father means to send me next winter.  Mr. L. You will want books then.  B. Yes, sir; each boy has a Spelling Book, a Reader, and a  Testament.  Mr. L. Then I will give them to you. Tell your father so,  and that it is because you are an obliging, contented little  boy.  B. I will, sir. Thank you.  Mr. L. Good by, Peter.  B. Good morning, sir.
