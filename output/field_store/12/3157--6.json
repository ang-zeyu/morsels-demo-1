Suppose they are frightfully angry when they come to their senses! They  might beat us, or leave us tied to trees, or something.\"    \"No, they won't,\" Anthea said (\"Oh, my Lamb, don't cry any more, it's  all right, Panty's got oo, duckie\"); \"they aren't unkind people, or they  wouldn't be going to give us any dinner.\"    \"Dinner?\" said Robert; \"I won't touch their nasty dinner. It would choke  me!\"    The others thought so too then. But when the dinner was ready--it turned  out to be supper, and happened between four and five--they were all glad  enough to take what they could get. It was boiled rabbit, with onions,  and some bird rather like a chicken, but stringier about its legs and  with a stronger taste. The Lamb had bread soaked in hot water and brown  sugar sprinkled on the top. He liked this very much, and consented to  let the two gipsy women feed him with it, as he sat on Anthea's lap. All  that long hot afternoon Robert and Cyril and Anthea and Jane had to keep  the Lamb amused and happy, while the gipsies looked eagerly on. By the  time the shadows grew long and black across the meadows he had really  \"taken to\" the woman with the light hair, and even consented to kiss  his hand to the children, and to stand up and bow, with his hand on his  chest--\"like a gentleman\"--to the two men. The whole gipsy camp was in  raptures with him, and his brothers and sisters could not help taking  some pleasure in showing off his accomplishments to an audience so  interested and enthusiastic. But they longed for sunset.    [Illustration: He consented to let the two gypsy women feed him]    \"We're getting into the habit of longing for sunset,\" Cyril whispered.  \"How I do wish we could wish something really sensible, that would be of  some use, so that we should be quite sorry when sunset came.\"    The shadows got longer and longer, and at last there were no separate  shadows any more, but one soft glowing shadow over everything; for the  sun was out of sight--behind the hill--but he had not really set yet.  The people who make the laws about lighting bicycle lamps are the people  who decide when the sun sets; she has to do it too, to the minute, or  they would know the reason why!    But the gipsies were getting impatient.    \"Now, young uns,\" the red-handkerchief man said, \"it's time you were  laying of your heads on your pillowses--so it is! The kid's all right  and friendly with us now--so you just hand him over and get home like  you said.\"    The women and children came crowding round the Lamb, arms were held out,  fingers snapped invitingly, friendly faces beaming with admiring smiles;  but all failed to tempt the loyal Lamb. He clung with arms and legs to  Jane, who happened to be holding him, and uttered the gloomiest roar of  the whole day.    \"It's no good,\" the woman said, \"hand the little poppet over, miss.  We'll soon quiet him.\"    And still the sun would not set.    \"Tell her about how to put him to bed,\" whispered Cyril; \"anything to  gain time--and be ready to bolt when the sun really does make up its  silly old mind to set.\"    \"Yes, I'll hand him over in just one minute,\" Anthea began, talking very  fast,--\"but do let me just tell you he has a warm bath every night and  cold in the morning, and he has a crockery rabbit to go into the warm  bath with him, and little Samuel saying his prayers in white china on a  red cushion for the cold bath; and he hates you to wash his ears, but  you must; and if you let the soap get into his eyes, the Lamb\"--    \"Lamb kyes,\" said he--he had stopped roaring to listen.    The woman laughed. \"As if I hadn't never bath'd a babby!\" she said.  \"Come--give us a hold of him. Come to 'Melia, my precious\"--    \"G'way, ugsie!\" replied the Lamb at once.    \"Yes, but,\" Anthea went on, \"about his meals; you really _must_ let me  tell you he has an apple or banana every morning, and bread and milk for  breakfast, and an egg for his tea sometimes, and\"--    \"I've brought up ten,\" said the black ringleted woman, \"besides the  others. Come, miss, 'and 'im over--I can't bear it no longer. I just  must give him a hug.\"    \"We ain't settled yet whose he's to be, Esther,\" said one of the men.    \"It won't be you, Esther, with seven of 'em at your tail a'ready.\"    \"I ain't so sure of that,\" said Esther's husband.    \"And ain't I nobody, to have a say neither?\" said the husband of 'Melia.    Zillah, the girl, said, \"An' me? I'm a single girl--and no one but 'im  to look after--I ought to have him.\"    \"Hold your tongue!\"    \"Shut your mouth!\"    \"Don't you show me no more of your imperence!\"    Everyone was getting very angry. The dark gipsy faces were frowning and  anxious-looking. Suddenly a change swept over them, as if some invisible  sponge had wiped away these cross and anxious expressions, and left only  a blank.    The children saw that the sun really _had_ set. But they were afraid to  move. And the gipsies were feeling so muddled because of the invisible  sponge that had washed all the feelings of the last few hours out of  their hearts, that they could not say a word.    The children hardly dared to breathe. Suppose the gipsies, when they  recovered speech, should be furious to think how silly they had been all  day?    It was an awkward moment. Suddenly Anthea, greatly daring, held out the  Lamb to the red-handkerchief man.    \"Here he is!\" she said.    The man drew back. \"I shouldn't like to deprive you, miss,\" he said  hoarsely.    \"Anyone who likes can have my share of him,\" said the other man.    \"After all, I've got enough of my own,\" said Esther.    \"He's a nice little chap, though,\" said Amelia. She was the only one who  now looked affectionately at the whimpering Lamb.    Zillah said, \"If I don't think I must have had a touch of the sun. _I_  don't want him.\"    \"Then shall we take him away?\" said Anthea.    \"Well--suppose you do,\" said Pharaoh heartily, \"and we'll say no more  about it!\"    And with great haste all the gipsies began to be busy about their tents  for the night. All but Amelia. She went with the children as far as the  bend in the road--and there she said--    \"Let me give him a kiss, miss,--I don't know what made us go for to  behave so silly. Us gipsies don't steal babies, whatever they may tell  you when you're naughty. We've enough of our own, mostly. But I've lost  all mine.\"    She leaned towards the Lamb; and he, looking in her eyes, unexpectedly  put up a grubby soft paw and stroked her face.    \"Poor, poor!\" said the Lamb. And he let the gipsy woman kiss him, and,  what is more, he kissed her brown cheek in return--a very nice kiss, as  all his kisses are, and not a wet one like some babies give. The gipsy  woman moved her finger about on his forehead as if she had been writing  something there, and the same with his chest and his hands and his  feet; then she said--    \"May he be brave, and have the strong head to think with, and the strong  heart to love with, and the strong arms to work with, and the strong  feet to travel with, and always come safe home to his own.\" Then she  said something in a strange language no one could understand, and  suddenly added--    \"Well, I must be saying 'so long'--and glad to have made your  acquaintance.\" And she turned and went back to her home--the tent by the  grassy roadside.    The children looked after her till she was out of sight. Then Robert  said, \"How silly of her! Even sunset didn't put _her_ right. What rot  she talked!\"    \"Well,\" said Cyril, \"if you ask me, I think it was rather decent of  her\"--    \"Decent?\" said Anthea; \"it was very nice indeed of her. I think she's a  dear\"--    \"She's just too frightfully nice for anything,\" said Jane.    And they went home--very late for tea and unspeakably late for dinner.  Martha scolded, of course. But the Lamb was safe.    \"I say--it turned out we wanted the Lamb as much as anyone,\" said  Robert, later.    \"Of course.\"    \"But do you feel different about it now the sun's set?\"    \"_No_,\" said all the others together.    \"Then it's lasted over sunset with us.\"    \"No, it hasn't,\" Cyril explained. \"The wish didn't do anything to _us_.  We always wanted him with all our hearts when we were our proper selves,  only we were all pigs this morning; especially you, Robert.\" Robert bore  this much with a strange calm.    \"I certainly _thought_ I didn't want him this morning,\" said he.  \"Perhaps I _was_ a pig. But everything looked so different when we  thought we were going to lose him.\"    And that, my dear children, is the moral of this chapter. I did not mean  it to have a moral, but morals are nasty forward beings, and will keep  putting in their oars where they are not wanted. And since the moral has  crept in, quite against my wishes, you might as well think of it next  time you feel piggy yourself and want to get rid of any of your brothers  and sisters. I hope this doesn't often happen, but I daresay it has  happened sometimes, even to you!

It was a long day, and it was not till the afternoon that all  the children suddenly decided to write letters to their mother. It was  Robert who had the misfortune to upset the ink well--an unusually deep  and full one--straight into that part of Anthea's desk where she had  long pretended that an arrangement of mucilage and cardboard painted  with Indian ink was a secret drawer.

There were bins of corn, joints of oxen, pottery dishes,  copper pans, and other things which might be useful for the ghostly  cuisine of the tomb. There were numberless small objects, used, no  doubt, by the dead monarch during life, which he would be pleased to see  again in the next world,--carved ivory boxes, little slabs for grinding  eye-paint, golden buttons, model tools, model vases with gold tops,  ivory and pottery figurines, and other _objets d'art_; the golden royal  seal of judgment of King Den in its ivory casket, and so forth. There  were memorials of the royal victories in peace and war, little ivory  plaques with inscriptions commemorating the founding of new buildings,  the institution of new religious festivals in honour of the gods, the  bringing of the captives of the royal bow and spear to the palace, the  discomfiture of the peoples of the North-land.    [Illustration: 067.jpg CONICAL VASE-STOPPERS. From Abydos. 1st Dynasty:  about 4000 B.C.]    All these things, which have done so much to reconstitute for us the  history of the earliest period of the Egyptian monarchy, were placed  under the care of the dead slaves whose bodies were buried round the  empty tomb-chamber of their royal master in Abydos.    The killing and entombment of the royal servants is of the highest  anthropological interest, for it throws a vivid light upon the manners  of the time. It shows the primeval Egyptians as a semi-barbaric people  of childishly simple ways of thought. The king was dead. For all his  kingship he was a man, and no man was immortal in this world. But yet  how could one really die? Shadows, dreams, all kinds of phenomena which  the primitive mind could not explain, induced the belief that, though  the outer man might rot, there was an inner man which could not die  and still lived on. The idea of total death was unthinkable. And where  should this inner man still live on but in the tomb to which the outer  man was consigned? And here, doubtless it was believed, in the house to  which the body was consigned, the ghost lived on. And as each ghost had  his house with the body, so no doubt all ghosts could communicate with  one another from tomb to tomb; and so there grew up the belief in a  tomb-world, a subterranean Egypt of tombs, in which the dead Egyptians  still lived and had their being. Later on the boat of the sun, in which  the god of light crossed the heavens by day, was thought to pass through  this dead world between his setting and his rising, accompanied by the  souls of the righteous. But of this belief we find no trace yet in the  ideas of the Ist Dynasty. All we can see is that the _sahus_, or bodies  of the dead, were supposed to reside in awful majesty in the tomb,  while the ghosts could pass from tomb to tomb through the mazes of  the underworld. Over this dread realm of dead men presided a dead god,  Osiris of Abydos; and so the necropolis of Abydos was the necropolis of  the underworld, to which all ghosts who were not its rightful citizens  would come from afar to pay their court to their ruler. Thus the man  of substance would have a monumental tablet put up to himself in this  necropolis as a sort of _pied-a-terre_, even if he could not be buried  there; for the king, who, for reasons chiefly connected with local  patriotism, was buried near the city of his earthly abode, a second tomb  would be erected, a stately mansion in the city of Osiris, in which his  ghost could reside when it pleased him to come to Abydos.    Now none could live without food, and men living under the earth needed  it as much as men living on the earth. The royal tomb was thus provided  with an enormous amount of earthly food for the use of the royal ghost,  and with other things as well, as we have seen. The same provision had  also to be made for the royal resting-place at Abydos. And in both cases  royal slaves were needed to take care of all this provision, and to  serve the ghost of the king, whether in his real tomb at Nakada, or  elsewhere, or in his second tomb at Abydos. Ghosts only could serve  ghosts, so that of the slaves ghosts had to be made. That was easily  done; they died when their master died and followed him to the tomb.  No doubt it seemed perfectly natural to all concerned, to the slaves as  much as to anybody else. But it shows the child's idea of the value of  life. An animate thing was hardly distinguished at this period from an  inanimate thing. The most ancient Egyptians buried slaves with their  kings as naturally as they buried jars of wine and bins of corn with  them. Both were buried with a definite object. The slaves had to die  before they were buried, but then so had the king himself. They all had  to die sometime or other. And the actual killing of them was no worse  than killing a dog, no worse even than \"killing\" golden buttons and  ivory boxes. For, when the buttons and boxes were buried with the king,  they were just as much dead as the slaves. Of the sanctity of _human_  life as distinct from other life, there was probably no idea at all. The  royal ghost needed ghostly servants, and they were provided as a matter  of course.    But as civilization progressed, the ideas of the Egyptians changed  on these points, and in the later ages of the ancient world they were  probably the most humane of the peoples, far more so than the Greeks,  in fact. The cultured Hellenes murdered their prisoners of war without  hesitation. Who has not been troubled in mind by the execution of Mkias  and Demosthenes after the surrender of the Athenian army at Syracuse?  When we compare this with Grant's refusal even to take Lee's sword  at Appomattox, we see how we have progressed in these matters; while  Gylippus and the Syracusans were as much children as the Ist Dynasty  Egyptians. But the Egyptians of Gylippus's time had probably advanced  much further than the Greeks in the direction of rational manhood. When  Amasis had his rival Apries in his power, he did not put him to death,  but kept him as his coadjutor on the throne. Apries fled from him,  allied himself with Greek pirates, and advanced against his generous  rival. After his defeat and murder at Momemphis, Amasis gave him a  splendid burial. When we compare this generosity to a beaten foe with  the savagery of the Assyrians, for instance, we see how far the later  Egyptians had progressed in the paths of humanity.    The ancient custom of killing slaves was first discontinued at the death  of the lesser chieftains, but we find a possible survival of it in the  case of a king, even as late as the time of the XIth Dynasty; for at  Thebes, in the precinct of the funerary temple of King Neb-hapet-Ra  Mentuhetep and round the central pyramid which commemorated his memory,  were buried a number of the ladies of his _harim_. They were all buried  at one and the same time, and there can be little doubt that they were  all killed and buried round the king, in order to be with him in the  next world. Now with each of these ladies, who had been turned into  ghosts, was buried a little waxen human figure placed in a little model  coffin. This was to replace her own slave. She who went to accompany  the king in the next world had to have her own attendant also. But, not  being royal, a real slave was not killed for her; she only took with her  a waxen figure, which by means of charms and incantations would, when  she called upon it, turn into a real slave, and say, \"Here am I,\" and do  whatever work might be required of her. The actual killing and burial  of the slaves had in all cases except that of the king been long  \"commuted,\" so to speak, into a burial with the dead person of  _ushabtis_, or \"Answerers,\" little figures like those described above,  made more usually of stone, and inscribed with the name of the deceased.  They were called \"Answerers\" because they answered the call of their  dead master or mistress, and by magic power became ghostly servants.  Later on they were made of wood and glazed _faience_, as well as stone.  By this means the greater humanity of a later age sought a relief from  the primitive disregard of the death of others.    Anthropologically interesting as are the results of the excavations at  Umm el-Gra'ab, they are no less historically important. There is no need  here to weary the reader with the details of scientific controversy; it  will suffice to set before him as succinctly and clearly as possible the  net results of the work which has been done.    Messrs. Amelineau and Petrie have found the secondary tombs and have  identified the names of the following primeval kings of Egypt. We  arrange them in their apparent historical order.    1. Aha Men (?).    2. Narmer (or Betjumer) Sma (?).    3. Tjer (or Khent). Besh.    4. Tja Ati.    5. Den Semti.    6. Atjab Merpeba.    7. Semerkha Nekht.    8. Qa Sen.    9. Khasekhem (Khasekhemui)    10. Hetepsekhemui.    11. Raeneb.    12. Neneter.    13. Sekhemab Perabsen.      Two or three other names are ascribed by Prof. Petrie to the  Hierakonpolite dynasty of Upper Egypt, which, as it occurs before the  time of Mena and the Ist Dynasty, he calls \"Dynasty 0.\" Dynasty 0,  however, is no dynasty, and in any case we should prefer to call the  \"predynastic\" dynasty \"Dynasty I.\" The names of \"Dynasty minus One,\"  however, remain problematical, and for the present it would seem safer  to suspend judgment as to the place of the supposed royal names \"Ro\" and  \"Ka\"(Men-kaf), which Prof. Petrie supposes to have been those of two  of the kings of Upper Egypt who reigned before Mena. The king  \"Sma\"(\"Uniter\") is possibly identical with Aha or Narmer, more  probably the latter. It is not necessary to detail the process by which  Egyptologists have sought to identify these thirteen kings with the  successors of Mena in the lists"]]]
