[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15718"],[0,"How To Write Special Feature Articles (#11)"],[1,"aspects of great interest that it is difficult to resist the temptation  to use all of them. If a writer yields to this temptation, the result  may be a diffuse, aimless article that, however interesting in many  details, fails to make a definite impression.    To avoid this danger, the writer must decide just what his purpose is  to be. He must ask himself, \"What is my aim in writing this article?\"  and, \"What do I expect to accomplish?\" Only in this way will he clarify  in his mind his reason for writing on the proposed topic and the object  to be attained.    With a definitely formulated aim before him, he can decide just what  material he needs. An objective point to be reached will give his  article direction and will help him to stick to his subject.  Furthermore, by getting his aim clearly in mind, he will have the means  of determining, when the story is completed, whether or not he has  accomplished what he set out to do.    In selecting material, in developing the article, and in testing the  completed product, therefore, it is important to have a definitely  formulated purpose.    THREE GENERAL AIMS. Every special article should accomplish one of three  general aims: it should (1) entertain, or (2) inform, or (3) give  practical guidance.    The same subject and the same material may sometimes be so treated as to  accomplish any one of these three purposes. If the writer's aim is  merely to help readers pass a leisure hour pleasantly, he will \"play up\"  those aspects of a topic that will afford entertainment and little or  nothing else. If he desires to supply information that will add to the  reader's stock of knowledge, he will present his facts in a manner  calculated to make his readers remember what he has told them. If he  proposes to give information that can be applied by readers to their own  activities, he must include those details that are necessary to any one  who desires to make practical use of the information.    When, for example, a writer is about to prepare an article, based on  experience, about keeping bees on a small suburban place, he will find  that he may write his story in any one of three ways. The difficulties  experienced by the amateur bee-keeper in trying to handle bees in a  small garden could be treated humorously with no other purpose than to  amuse. Or the keeping of bees under such circumstances might be  described as an interesting example of enterprise on the part of a city  man living in the suburbs. Or, in order to show other men and women  similarly situated just how to keep bees, the writer might explain  exactly what any person would need to know to attain success in such a  venture. Just as the purpose of these articles would vary, so the  material and the point of view would differ.    ENTERTAINING ARTICLES. To furnish wholesome entertainment is a perfectly  legitimate end in special feature writing. There is no reason why the  humor, the pathos, the romance, the adventure, and mystery in life  should not be presented in special feature stories for our entertainment  and amusement, just as they are presented for the same purpose in the  short story, the drama, and the photo-play. Many readers find special  feature stories with real persons, real places, and real circumstances,  more entertaining than fiction. A writer with the ability to see the  comedies and the tragedies in the events constantly happening about him,  or frequently reported in the press, will never lack for subjects and  material.    WHOLESOME ENTERTAINMENT. The effect of entertaining stories on the ideas  and ideals of readers ought not to be overlooked. According to the best  journalistic standards, nothing should be printed that will exert a  demoralizing or unwholesome influence. Constructive journalism goes a  step further when it insists that everything shall tend to be helpful  and constructive. This practice applies alike to news stories and to  special articles.    These standards do not necessarily exclude news and special feature  stories that deal with crime, scandal, and similar topics; but they do  demand that the treatment of such subjects shall not be suggestive or  offensive. To portray violators of the criminal or moral codes as heroes  worthy of emulation; to gratify some readers' taste for the morbid; to  satisfy other readers by exploiting sex--all are alike foreign to the  purpose of respectable journalism. No self-respecting writer will lend  the aid of his pen to such work, and no self-respecting editor will  publish it.    To deter persons from committing similar crimes and follies should be  the only purpose in writing on such topics. The thoughtful writer,  therefore, must guard against the temptation to surround wrong-doers  with the glamour of heroic or romantic adventure, and, by sentimental  treatment, to create sympathy for the undeserving culprit. Violations of  law and of the conventions of society ought to be shown to be wrong,  even when the wrong-doer is deserving of some sympathy. This need not be  done by moralizing and editorializing. A much better way is to  emphasize, as the results of wrong-doing, not only legal punishment and  social ostracism, but the pangs of a guilty conscience, and the disgrace  to the culprit and his family.    A cynical or flippant treatment of serious subjects gives many readers a  false and distorted view of life. Humor does not depend on ridicule or  satire. The fads and foibles of humanity can be good-naturedly exposed  in humorous articles that have no sting. Although many topics may very  properly be treated lightly, others demand a serious, dignified style.    The men and women whom a writer puts into his articles are not puppets,  but real persons, with feelings not unlike his own. To drag them and  their personal affairs from the privacy to which they are entitled, and  to give them undesired and needless publicity, for the sake of affording  entertainment to others, often subjects them to great humiliation and  suffering. The fact that a man, woman, or child has figured in the day's  news does not necessarily mean that a writer is entitled to exploit such  a person's private affairs. He must discriminate between what the public  is entitled to know and what an individual has a right to keep private.  Innocent wives, sweethearts, or children are not necessarily legitimate  material for his article because their husband, lover, or father has  appeared in the news. The golden rule is the best guide for a writer in  such cases. Lack of consideration for the rights of others is the mark  neither of a good writer nor of a true gentleman. Clean, wholesome  special feature stories that present interesting phases of life  accurately, and that show due consideration for the rights of the  persons portrayed, are quite as entertaining as are any others.    INFORMATIVE ARTICLES. Since many persons confine their reading largely  to newspapers and magazines, they derive most of their information and  ideas from these sources. Even persons who read new books rely to some  extent on special articles for the latest information about current  topics. Although most readers look to periodicals primarily for new,  timely facts, they are also interested to find there biographical and  historical material that is not directly connected with current events.  Every special feature writer has a great opportunity to furnish a large  circle of readers with interesting and significant information.    In analyzing subjects it is necessary to discriminate between  significant and trivial facts. Some topics when studied will be found to  contain little of real consequence, even though a readable article might  be developed from the material. Other themes will reveal aspects that  are both trivial and significant. When a writer undertakes to choose  between the two, he should ask himself, \"Are the facts worth  remembering?\" and, \"Will they furnish food for thought?\" In clarifying  his purpose by such tests, he will decide not only what kind of  information he desires to impart, but what material he must select, and  from what point of view he should present it.    ARTICLES OF PRACTICAL GUIDANCE. The third general purpose that a writer  may have is to give his readers sufficiently explicit information to  enable them to do for themselves what has been done by others. Because  all persons want to know how to be more successful, they read these  \"how-to-do-something\" articles with avidity. All of us welcome practical  suggestions, tactfully given, that can be applied to our own activities.  Whatever any one has done successfully may be so presented that others  can learn how to do it with equal success. Special feature articles  furnish the best means of giving this practical guidance.    In preparing a \"how-to-do-something\" article, a writer needs to consider  the class of readers for which it is intended. A special feature story,  for example, on how to reduce the cost of milk might be presented from  any one of three points of view: that of the producer, that of the  distributor, or that of the consumer. To be practical for dairy farmers,  as producers of milk, the article would have to point out possible  economies in keeping cows and handling milk on the farm. To be helpful  to milk-dealers, as distributors, it would concern itself with methods  of lowering the cost of selling and delivering milk in the city. To  assist housewives, as consumers, the article would have to show how to  economize in using milk in the home. An informative article for the  general reader might take up all these phases of the subject, but an  article intended to give practical guidance should consider the needs of  only one of these three classes of persons.    In many constructive articles of practical guidance, the writer's  purpose is so successfully concealed that it may at first escape the  notice of the average reader.

Will you give me a sign, something,  anything, so that I shall know that if I ever want to visit the  wonderful tents I shall find them?\"    She only spoke to gain time.    Knowing that outside the curtain there stretched the path across the  Field of Content, she deliberately placed her foot upon the desert  sand, and whilst common sense urged her to get out of the room, she  listened to temptation and lingered, throwing safety to the four winds,  opening wide her arms to danger.    \"By the sign of the black stallion who awaits thee at dawn near all  that remaineth upright of the City of On, shalt thou find the Tents of  Purple and Gold.\"    \"But I don't ride any more,\" said Damaris.  \"I can't find a horse, a  good one, and I don't know where the City of On is.\"    \"Thou shall know, thou ivory casket to which love is the key.  And if  thou see'st one afar off as thou ridest into the desert at dawn, fear  not; for behold, is thy beauty spoken of, yea, even in the harem, and  it were not wise for thee to ride alone.\"    The girl put out her hand towards the silken curtain.    \"How do you know who I am?\"    \"By thy voice, which is as the wind of dawn.\"    She hesitated, divided between a desire to know more about this man and  an innate courtesy which forbade her questioning.    \"Search not, ask not, woman,\" said the fortune-teller, divining her  thoughts, \"for I am not worthy of thy notice.  Were I to cross thy  threshold, were I to lay my hand upon thee, as surely should I pollute  thee.  There is that within me which cries aloud, urging me to lead thy  feet upon the burning desert sands; and, again, there is that within me  which would fain force thee, for thy happiness, upon the path running  through the Field of Content.  Yet, behold, art thou all safe with me.\"    \"Could I help you?  If you were to tell me your trouble, perhaps it  would be easier?\"    \"The moment is not yet, woman, but, being a teller of tales, even as I  am a teller of fortunes, one day will I sit at thy feet and, for the  passing of an hour, will tell thee the story of the Hawk of Egypt.\"    \"You have made this hour pass so pleasantly that I should--should like  to--to give you something so as--as to show you how pleased I am.  But  I have nothing with me, nothing.\"    She put out her hands and turned them down.    The man looked down at her for a moment with blazing eyes.    \"Give me--as a reward--Allah--give me----\"  They stood quite still as  the torrent surged, about them.  \"Give me the ring from off thy  finger,\" he added, gently.    The girl held out her hand.    \"Take it, though it seems a poor reward for all you have promised me.\"    \"Nay, give it thou to me.\"    She slipped it off and held it out, showing a bruise across the back of  her hand.    \"Allah!\" whispered the man, \"that I should mark thee thus--and yet, in  love--in love!\"    He took the ring, of which the dull-gold setting held an emerald in the  form of a scarab with heartshaped base.    The fortune-teller turned it over in the palm of his hand, then held it  out.    \"Nay, this I cannot take.  I thought it was a ring from the bazaar to  go with thy dress of fantasy.  Behold, it is an amulet of the heart,  of--nay, I cannot tell thus quickly of what dynasty--with words of  power engraved upon it which read thus:    \"'_My heart, my mother; my heart, my mother.  My heart whereby I came  into being_.'\"    The girl listened entranced, touching the ring with finger-tips which  felt as snow-flakes upon the man's hand.    \"What is an amulet of the heart?\"    \"In the days of Ancient Egypt, when the heart had been taken from the  dead body for purposes of preservation, an amulet, a scarab, sometimes  heart-shaped, was placed within the body to ensure it life and movement  in the new life.\"    They both stood looking down upon the jewel, the girl's finger-tips  resting upon the man's hand.    \"Keep it,\" she said softly.  \"Keep it.\"    \"I will keep it to replace that which has gone from me.  I will restore  it to its shape, I will take from it the golden setting of the ring.  I  will wear it upon my breast.\"  And, bending, he gently raised the  yashmak in both hands and pressed his forehead to the few inches which  had rested above her crimson mouth.          CHAPTER IX      \"_Love is one and the same in the original, but    there are a thousand copies of it, and, it may    be, all differing from one another_.\"              LA ROCHEFOUCAULD.      Ben Kelham, disguised as Rameses the Great, laid a hand upon the girl's  shoulder as, passing to the left of the tent, she walked slowly towards  the door leading to the grounds, whilst sounds of wrath came from the  serried ranks of those who wished to pry into the future.    The fortune-teller had sent word that there would be no more reading of  horoscopes or hands that evening, and had absented himself therewith  through a back entrance.    \"You _have_ been a long time,\" said Ben Kelham.  He looked magnificent  as the great Sestoris, who had stood well over six feet in the days of  Ancient Egypt.  \"What was the man telling you?\"    Damaris was disturbed, and it was most unfortunate that, under the spur  of inquietude, he should have chosen just this occasion and this moment  to allow a hint of authority to creep into his voice and a shadow of  proprietorship to show in his actions.    \"How do you know who I am?\" parried the girl coldly, as she shrugged  the proprietory hand off her shoulder.    \"Wellington gave you away.  He followed your trail to the tent and sat  growling at everybody until I came along and removed him.\"    \"I wish you would leave the dog alone,\" said Damaris, with a certain  amount of acerbity.  \"He is my custos.\"    \"But that is not the kind of guardian you want, Damaris--you are too  beautiful, you know.  Let us sit here; it's lovely and warm, and the  stars look just like diamonds, don't they?\"    \"I would rather walk,\" said Damaris, who was longing to sit down.    But she sat down when Ben Kelham took her by the elbow and led her to  the seat; and she sat quite still when he suddenly took both her hands.    \"Oh! don't, Ben,\" she said, when he pulled them up against his heart.  \"I can't stand any more to-night.\"  And he, being over-slow in the  uptak', failed to catch her in this slip of the tongue.    \"I want you for my wife, dear,\" was all he said.    Then Damaris pulled her hands away and, removing the yashmak, looked up  into his face, whilst he drew a breath sharply at the beauty of her.    \"I love you so, dear!  I'm a clumsy fool at speaking, but I could show  you how I love you.  I want to marry you and take you right away home.  Do you know, I--I don't know how to explain it, but I--somehow feel you  are in danger out here.  I--will you------?\"    Damaris looked to the right and looked to the left, hesitated and chose  the middle path.    \"I can't answer you now, Ben.  I'm--I'm not sure about loving you, and,  of course, one can't marry without that on both sides, can one?\"    Oh, the blessed little ignoramus!    \"Besides,\" she added as an afterthought, \"I'm so young, and so are you.\"    \"Oh, Damaris!  Surely you don't want to wait until you find someone  who's had lots of experience, which only means that he hasn't been  playing the game as far as his future wife is concerned and will come  to you like a ready-made suit returned from the cleaner's.  The Kelhams  always marry young, and our brides are always very young.  That's why,  I think, we're so strong and long-lived.\"  He veered suddenly from the  mazy subject of eugenics and pleaded hard, persuasively, stubbornly.    But Damaris, just as stubbornly, shook her head.    \"Besides, Ben, this is unexpected.  I haven't seen anything of you  since I have been out; surely, if you love me so, you would have come  over more often to--to--prepare the way.\"    She unashamedly exposed her hurt, whilst the man inwardly called  himself every kind of a fool for having listened to another's voice  upon a subject as vital and tricky as love.    Still he urged and pleaded, being of those who, refusing to take No as  an answer, usually succeed in attaining their desire.    A wearisome process, but well worth while once in a lifetime, whatever  kind of a clutter those first cousins, obstinacy, stubbornness and  strong will cause you to accumulate about your feet at other times.    \"I don't know enough to marry,\" persisted the girl.  \"I want to know  what love really is, first.\"    \"Oh! but, dear, I can teach you all you want to know,\" replied the man,  in the customary all-sweeping manner of the male.    \"But I want to know all about the different kinds.\"    \"There are no different kinds, Damaris.  There is only one sort.\"    \"Then explain this to me.\"    It seemed that two months before the girl had left England, she had  found the tweeny, Lizzie Stitch by name, sobbing over the cinders in  her sitting-room grate.  The besmirched little face, like a sodden  little pudding, had been covered with grimy hands, and the thin little  chest had heaved under the scanty cotton blouse and the stress of the  tale of betrayal and desertion.    \"I didn't know, miss.  I didn't do it purposelike for a lark.  I did  think it was love, _real_ love what--what is h'always pardinned.  Well,  miss, if you think it wise to force 'im, I'll do what you say, though  it's not about meself as I'm worrying; it's 'cause I must have a father  for the kid.  "]]]
