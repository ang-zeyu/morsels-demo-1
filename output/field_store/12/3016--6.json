Then laughed the poisoner: \"He! he! he!      He's piping on the last hole,\" said she,      \"As if he had love in his body.\"    _Chorus_. As if he had love in his body.    _Siebel_. Just hear now how the ninnies giggle!  That's what I call a genuine art,  To make poor rats with poison wriggle!    _Brander_. You take their case so much to heart?    _Altmayer_. The bald pate and the butter-belly!  The sad tale makes him mild and tame;  He sees in the swollen rat, poor fellow!  His own true likeness set in a frame.          FAUST _and_ MEPHISTOPHELES.    _Mephistopheles_. Now, first of all, 'tis necessary  To show you people making merry,  That you may see how lightly life can run.  Each day to this small folk's a feast of fun;  Not over-witty, self-contented,  Still round and round in circle-dance they whirl,  As with their tails young kittens twirl.  If with no headache they're tormented,  Nor dunned by landlord for his pay,  They're careless, unconcerned, and gay.    _Brander_. They're fresh from travel, one might know it,  Their air and manner plainly show it;  They came here not an hour ago.    _Frosch_. Thou verily art right! My Leipsic well I know!  Paris in small it is, and cultivates its people.    _Siebel_. What do the strangers seem to thee?    _Frosch_. Just let me go! When wine our friendship mellows,  Easy as drawing a child's tooth 'twill be  To worm their secrets out of these two fellows.  They're of a noble house, I dare to swear,  They have a proud and discontented air.    _Brander_. They're mountebanks, I'll bet a dollar!    _Altmayer_. Perhaps.    _Frosch_. I'll smoke them, mark you that!    _Mephistopheles_ [_to Faust_]. These people never smell the old rat,  E'en when he has them by the collar.    _Faust_. Fair greeting to you, sirs!    _Siebel_. The same, and thanks to boot.         [_In a low tone, faking a side look at MEPHISTOPHELES_.]  Why has the churl one halting foot?    _Mephistopheles_. With your permission, shall we make one party?  Instead of a good drink, which get here no one can,  Good company must make us hearty.    _Altmayer_. You seem a very fastidious man.    _Frosch_. I think you spent some time at Rippach[22] lately?  You supped with Mister Hans not long since, I dare say?    _Mephistopheles_. We passed him on the road today!  Fine man! it grieved us parting with him, greatly.  He'd much to say to us about his cousins,  And sent to each, through us, his compliments by dozens.        [_He bows to_ FROSCH.]    _Altmayer_ [_softly_]. You've got it there! he takes!    _Siebel_. The chap don't want for wit!    _Frosch_. I'll have him next time, wait a bit!    _Mephistopheles_. If I mistook not, didn't we hear  Some well-trained voices chorus singing?  'Faith, music must sound finely here.  From all these echoing arches ringing!    _Frosch_. You are perhaps a connoisseur?    _Mephistopheles_. O no! my powers are small, I'm but an amateur.    _Altmayer_. Give us a song!    _Mephistopheles_. As many's you desire.    _Siebel_. But let it be a bran-new strain!    _Mephistopheles_. No fear of that!  We've just come back from Spain,  The lovely land of wine and song and lyre.            [_Sings_.]      There was a king, right stately,      Who had a great, big flea,--    _Frosch_. Hear him! A flea! D'ye take there, boys? A flea!  I call that genteel company.    _Mephistopheles_ [_resumes_]. There was a king, right stately,       Who had a great, big flea,       And loved him very greatly,       As if his own son were he.       He called the knight of stitches;       The tailor came straightway:       Ho! measure the youngster for breeches,       And make him a coat to-day!    _Brander_. But don't forget to charge the knight of stitches,  The measure carefully to take,  And, as he loves his precious neck,  To leave no wrinkles in the breeches.    _Mephistopheles_. In silk and velvet splendid       The creature now was drest,       To his coat were ribbons appended,       A cross was on his breast.       He had a great star on his collar,       Was a minister, in short;       And his relatives, greater and smaller,       Became great people at court.         The lords and ladies of honor       Fared worse than if they were hung,       The queen, she got them upon her,       And all were bitten and stung,       And did not dare to attack them,       Nor scratch, but let them stick.       We choke them and we crack them       The moment we feel one prick.    _Chorus_ [_loud_]. We choke 'em and we crack 'em  The moment we feel one prick.    _Frosch_. Bravo! Bravo! That was fine!    _Siebel_. So shall each flea his life resign!    _Brander_. Point your fingers and nip them fine!    _Altmayer_. Hurra for Liberty! Hurra for Wine!    _Mephistopheles_. I'd pledge the goddess, too, to show how high I set her,  Right gladly, if your wines were just a trifle better.    _Siebel_. Don't say that thing again, you fretter!    _Mephistopheles_. Did I not fear the landlord to affront;  I'd show these worthy guests this minute  What kind of stuff our stock has in it.    _Siebel_. Just bring it on! I'll bear the brunt.    _Frosch_. Give us a brimming glass, our praise shall then be ample,  But don't dole out too small a sample;  For if I'm to judge and criticize,  I need a good mouthful to make me wise.    _Altmayer_ [_softly_]. They're from the Rhine, as near as I can make it.    _Mephistopheles_. Bring us a gimlet here!    _Brander_. What shall be done with that?  You've not the casks before the door, I take it?    _Altmayer_. The landlord's tool-chest there is easily got at.    _Mephistopheles_ [_takes the gimlet_] (_to Frosch_).  What will you have? It costs but speaking.    _Frosch_. How do you mean?  Have you so many kinds?    _Mephistopheles_. Enough to suit all sorts of minds.    _Altmayer_. Aha! old sot, your lips already licking!    _Frosch_. Well, then! if I must choose, let Rhine-wine fill my beaker,  Our fatherland supplies the noblest liquor.          MEPHISTOPHELES     [_boring a hole in the rim of the table near the place      where_ FROSCH _sits_].  Get us a little wax right off to make the stoppers!    _Altmayer_. Ah, these are jugglers' tricks, and whappers!    _Mephistopheles_ [_to Brander_]. And you?    _Brander_. Champaigne's the wine for me,  But then right sparkling it must be!         [MEPHISTOPHELES _bores; meanwhile one of them has made        the wax-stoppers and stopped the holes_.]    _Brander_. Hankerings for foreign things will sometimes haunt you,  The good so far one often finds;  Your real German man can't bear the French, I grant you,  And yet will gladly drink their wines.    _Siebel_ [_while Mephistopheles approaches his seat_].  I don't like sour, it sets my mouth awry,  Let mine have real sweetness in it!    _Mephistopheles_ [_bores_]. Well, you shall have Tokay this minute.    _Altmayer_. No, sirs, just look me in the eye!  I see through this, 'tis what the chaps call smoking.    _Mephistopheles_. Come now! That would be serious joking,  To make so free with worthy men.  But quickly now! Speak out again!  With what description can I serve you?    _Altmayer_. Wait not to ask; with any, then.          [_After all the holes are bored and stopped_.]    _Mephistopheles_ [_with singular gestures_].  From the vine-stock grapes we pluck;  Horns grow on the buck;  Wine is juicy, the wooden table,  Like wooden vines, to give wine is able.  An eye for nature's depths receive!  Here is a miracle, only believe!  Now draw the plugs and drink your fill!           ALL      [_drawing the stoppers, and catching each in his glass       the wine he had desired_].  Sweet spring, that yields us what we will!    _Mephistopheles_. Only be careful not a drop to spill!      [_They drink repeatedly_.]    _All_ [_sing_]. We're happy all as cannibals,       Five hundred hogs together.    _Mephistopheles_. Look at them now, they're happy as can be!    _Faust_. To go would suit my inclination.    _Mephistopheles_. But first give heed, their bestiality  Will make a glorious demonstration.         SIEBEL       [_drinks carelessly; the wine is spilt upon the ground        and turns to flame_].  Help! fire! Ho! Help! The flames of hell!    _Mephistopheles [_conjuring the flame_].  Peace, friendly element, be still!       [_To the Toper_.]  This time 'twas but a drop of fire from purgatory.    _Siebel_. What does this mean? Wait there, or you'll be sorry!  It seems you do not know us well.    _Frosch_. Not twice, in this way, will it do to joke us!    _Altmayer_. I vote, we give him leave himself here _scarce_ to make.    _Siebel_. What, sir! How dare you undertake  To carry on here your old hocus-pocus?    _Mephistopheles_. Be still, old wine-cask!    _Siebel_. Broomstick, you!  Insult to injury add? Confound you!    _Brander_. Stop there! Or blows shall rain down round you!          ALTMAYER        [_draws a stopper out of the table; fire flies at him_].  I burn! I burn!    _Siebel_. Foul sorcery! Shame!  Lay on! the rascal is fair game!          [_They draw their knives and rush at_ MEPHISTOPHELES.]    _Mephistopheles_ [_with a serious mien_].  Word and shape of air!  Change place, new meaning wear!  Be here--and there!          [_They stand astounded and look at each other_.]    _Altmayer_. Where am I? What a charming land!    _Frosch_. Vine hills! My eyes! Is't true?    _Siebel_. And grapes, too, close at hand!    _Brander_. Beneath this green see what a stem is growing!  See what a bunch of grapes is glowing!         [_He seizes_ SIEBEL _by the nose. The rest do the same to each          other and raise their knives._]    _Mephistopheles_ [_as above_]. Loose, Error, from their eyes the band!  How Satan plays his tricks, you need not now be told of.         [_He vanishes with_ FAUST, _the companions start back from each          other_.]    _Siebel_. What ails me?"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14461"],[0,"Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft (#11)"],[1,"  surely a venial sin in an ignorant and deluded pagan.    To illustrate the nature of the Hebrew witch and her prohibited criminal  traffic, those who have written on this subject have naturally dwelt  upon the interview between Saul and the Witch of Endor, the only  detailed and particular account of such a transaction which is to be  found in the Bible; a fact, by the way, which proves that the crime of  witchcraft (capitally punished as it was when discovered) was not  frequent among the chosen people, who enjoyed such peculiar  manifestations of the Almighty's presence. The Scriptures seem only to  have conveyed to us the general fact (being what is chiefly edifying) of  the interview between the witch and the King of Israel. They inform us  that Saul, disheartened and discouraged by the general defection of his  subjects, and the consciousness of his own unworthy and ungrateful  disobedience, despairing of obtaining an answer from the offended Deity,  who had previously communicated with him through his prophets, at length  resolved, in his desperation, to go to a divining woman, by which course  he involved himself in the crime of the person whom he thus consulted,  against whom the law denounced death--a sentence which had been often  executed by Saul himself on similar offenders. Scripture proceeds to  give us the general information that the king directed the witch to call  up the Spirit of Samuel, and that the female exclaimed that gods had  arisen out of the earth--that Saul, more particularly requiring a  description of the apparition (whom, consequently, he did not himself  see), she described it as the figure of an old man with a mantle. In  this figure the king acknowledges the resemblance of Samuel, and sinking  on his face, hears from the apparition, speaking in the character of the  prophet, the melancholy prediction of his own defeat and death.    In this description, though all is told which is necessary to convey to  us an awful moral lesson, yet we are left ignorant of the minutiae  attending the apparition, which perhaps we ought to accept as a sure  sign that there was no utility in our being made acquainted with them.  It is impossible, for instance, to know with certainty whether Saul was  present when the woman used her conjuration, or whether he himself  personally ever saw the appearance which the Pythoness described to him.  It is left still more doubtful whether anything supernatural was  actually evoked, or whether the Pythoness and her assistant meant to  practise a mere deception, taking their chance to prophesy the defeat  and death of the broken-spirited king as an event which the  circumstances in which he was placed rendered highly probable, since he  was surrounded by a superior army of Philistines, and his character as a  soldier rendered it likely that he would not survive a defeat which must  involve the loss of his kingdom. On the other hand, admitting that the  apparition had really a supernatural character, it remains equally  uncertain what was its nature or by what power it was compelled to an  appearance, unpleasing, as it intimated, since the supposed spirit of  Samuel asks wherefore he was disquieted in the grave. Was the power of  the witch over the invisible world so great that, like the Erictho of  the heathen poet, she could disturb the sleep of the just, and  especially that of a prophet so important as Samuel; and are we to  suppose that he, upon whom the Spirit of the Lord was wont to descend,  even while he was clothed with frail mortality, should be subject to be  disquieted in his grave at the voice of a vile witch, and the command of  an apostate prince? Did the true Deity refuse Saul the response of his  prophets, and could a witch compel the actual spirit of Samuel to make  answer notwithstanding?    Embarrassed by such difficulties, another course of explanation has been  resorted to, which, freed from some of the objections which attend the  two extreme suppositions, is yet liable to others. It has been supposed  that something took place upon this remarkable occasion similar to that  which disturbed the preconcerted purpose of the prophet Balaam, and  compelled him to exchange his premeditated curses for blessings.  According to this hypothesis, the divining woman of Endor was preparing  to practise upon Saul those tricks of legerdemain or jugglery by which  she imposed upon meaner clients who resorted to her oracle. Or we may  conceive that in those days, when the laws of Nature were frequently  suspended by manifestations of the Divine Power, some degree of juggling  might be permitted between mortals and the spirits of lesser note; in  which case we must suppose that the woman really expected or hoped to  call up some supernatural appearance. But in either case, this second  solution of the story supposes that the will of the Almighty  substituted, on that memorable occasion, for the phantasmagoria intended  by the witch, the spirit of Samuel in his earthly resemblance--or, if  the reader may think this more likely, some good being, the messenger of  the Divine pleasure, in the likeness of the departed prophet--and, to  the surprise of the Pythoness herself, exchanged the juggling farce: of  sheer deceit or petty sorcery which she had intended to produce, for a  deep tragedy, capable of appalling the heart of the hardened tyrant, and  furnishing an awful lesson to future times.    This exposition has the advantage of explaining the surprise expressed  by the witch at the unexpected consequences of her own invocation, while  it removes the objection of supposing the spirit of Samuel subject to  her influence. It does not apply so well to the complaint of Samuel that  he was _disquieted_, since neither the prophet, nor any good angel  wearing his likeness, could be supposed to complain of an apparition  which took place in obedience to the direct command of the Deity. If,  however, the phrase is understood, not as a murmuring against the  pleasure of Providence, but as a reproach to the prophet's former friend  Saul, that his sins and discontents, which were the ultimate cause of  Samuel's appearance, had withdrawn the prophet for a space from the  enjoyment and repose of Heaven, to review this miserable spot of  mortality, guilt, grief, and misfortune, the words may, according to  that interpretation, wear no stronger sense of complaint than might  become the spirit of a just man made perfect, or any benevolent angel by  whom he might be represented. It may be observed that in Ecclesiasticus  (xlvi. 19, 20), the opinion of Samuel's actual appearance is adopted,  since it is said of this man of God, that _after death he prophesied,  and showed the king his latter end_.    Leaving the further discussion of this dark and difficult question to  those whose studies have qualified them to give judgment on so obscure a  subject, it so far appears clear that the Witch of Endor, was not a  being such as those believed in by our ancestors, who could transform  themselves and others into the appearance of the lower animals, raise  and allay tempests, frequent the company and join the revels of evil  spirits, and, by their counsel and assistance, destroy human lives, and  waste the fruits of the earth, or perform feats of such magnitude as to  alter the face of Nature. The Witch of Endor was a mere fortune-teller,  to whom, in despair of all aid or answer from the Almighty, the  unfortunate King of Israel had recourse in his despair, and by whom, in  some way or other, he obtained the awful certainty of his own defeat and  death. She was liable, indeed, deservedly to the punishment of death for  intruding herself upon the task of the real prophets, by whom the will  of God was at that time regularly made known. But her existence and her  crimes can go no length to prove the possibility that another class of  witches, no otherwise resembling her than as called by the same name,  either existed at a more recent period, or were liable to the same  capital punishment, for a very different and much more doubtful class of  offences, which, however odious, are nevertheless to be proved possible  before they can be received as a criminal charge.    Whatever may be thought of other occasional expressions in the Old  Testament, it cannot be said that, in any part of that sacred volume, a  text occurs indicating the existence of a system of witchcraft, under  the Jewish dispensation, in any respect similar to that against which  the law-books of so many European nations have, till very lately,  denounced punishment; far less under the Christian dispensation--a  system under which the emancipation of the human race from the Levitical  law was happily and miraculously perfected. This latter crime is  supposed to infer a compact implying reverence and adoration on the part  of the witch who comes under the fatal bond, and patronage, support, and  assistance on the part of the diabolical patron. Indeed, in the four  Gospels, the word, under any sense, does not occur; although, had the  possibility of so enormous a sin been admitted, it was not likely to  escape the warning censure of the Divine Person who came to take away  the sins of the world. Saint Paul, indeed, mentions the sin of  witchcraft, in a cursory manner, as superior in guilt to that of  ingratitude; and in the offences of the flesh it is ranked immediately  after idolatry, which juxtaposition inclines us to believe that the  witchcraft mentioned by the Apostle must have been analogous to that of  the Old Testament, and equivalent to resorting to the assistance of  soothsayers, or similar forbidden arts, to acquire knowledge of  toturity. Sorcerers are also joined with other criminals, in the Book of  Revelations, as excluded from the city of God And with these occasional  notices, which indicate that there was a transgression so called, but  leave us ignorant of us exact nature, the writers upon"]]]
