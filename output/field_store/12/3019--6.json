[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14474"],[0,"The Chemical History of a Candle (#11)"],[1," hydrogen: it  will, however, burn without contact with the air. That is why I have  chosen this other form of apparatus, for the purpose of pointing out to  you what are the particular circumstances of this experiment. In place of  an open vessel I have taken one that is closed (our battery is so  beautifully active that we are even boiling the mercury, and getting all  things right--not wrong, but vigorously right); and I am going to shew you  that that gas, whatever it may be, can burn without air, and in that  respect differs from a candle, which cannot burn without the air. And our  manner of doing this is as follows:--I have here a glass vessel (G) which  is fitted with two platinum-wires (IK), through which I can apply  electricity; and we can put the vessel on the air-pump and exhaust the  air, and when we have taken the air out we can bring it here and fasten it  on to this jar (F), and let into the vessel that gas which was formed by  the action of the voltaic battery upon the water, and which we have  produced by changing the water into it,--for I may go as far as this, and  say we have really, by that experiment, changed the water into that gas.  We have not only altered its condition, but we have changed it really and  truly into that gaseous substance, and all the water is there which was  decomposed by the experiment. As I screw this vessel (GH) on here (H), and  make the tubes well connected, and when I open the stop-cocks (HHH), if  you watch the level of the water (in F), you will see that the gas will  rise. I will now close the stop-cocks, as I have drawn up as much as the  vessel can hold, and being safely conveyed into that chamber, I will pass  into it an electric spark from this Leyden jar (L), when the vessel, which  is now quite clear and bright, will become dim. There will be no sound,  for the vessel is strong enough to confine the explosion. [A spark was  then passed through the jar, when the explosive mixture was ignited.] Did  you see that brilliant light? If I again screw the vessel on to the jar,  and open these stop-cocks, you will see that the gas will rise a second  time. [The stop-cocks were then opened.] Those gases [referring to the  gases first collected in the jar, and which had just been ignited by the  electric spark] have disappeared, as you see: their place is vacant, and  fresh gas has gone in. Water has been formed from them; and if we repeat  our operation [repeating the last experiment], I shall have another  vacancy, as you will see by the water rising. I always have an empty  vessel after the explosion, because the vapour or gas into which that  water has been resolved by the battery explodes under the influence of the  spark, and changes into water; and by-and-by you will see in this upper  vessel some drops of water trickling down the sides and collecting at the  bottom.    We are here dealing with water entirely, without reference to the  atmosphere. The water of the candle had the atmosphere helping to produce  it; but in this way it can be produced independently of the air. Water,  therefore, ought to contain that other substance which the candle takes  from the air, and which, combining with the hydrogen, produces water.    Just now you saw that one end of this battery took hold of the copper,  extracting it from the vessel which contained the blue solution. It was  effected by this wire; and surely we may say, if the battery has such  power with a metallic solution which we made and unmade, may we not find  that it is possible to split asunder the component parts of the water, and  put them into this place and that place? Suppose I take the poles--the  metallic ends of this battery--and see what will happen with the water in  this apparatus (fig. 20), where we have separated the two ends far apart.    [Illustration: Fig. 20.]    I place one here (at A), and the other there (at B), and I have little  shelves with holes which I can put upon each pole, and so arrange them  that whatever escapes from the two ends of the battery will appear as  separate gases; for you saw that the water did not become vaporous, but  gaseous. The wires are now in perfect and proper connection with the  vessel containing the water; and you see the bubbles rising: let us  collect these bubbles and see what they are. Here is a glass cylinder (O);  I fill it with water and put it over one end (A) of the pile; and I will  take another (H) and put it over the other end (B) of the pile. And so now  we have a double apparatus, with both places delivering gas.  Both these  jars will fill with gas. There they go, that to the right (H) filling very  rapidly; the one to the left (O) filling not so rapidly; and though I have  allowed some bubbles to escape, yet still the action is going on pretty  regularly; and were it not that one is rather smaller than the other, you  would see that I should have twice as much in this (H) as I have in that  (O).  Both these gases are colourless; they stand over the water without  condensing; they are alike in all things--I mean in all _apparent_ things;  and we have here an opportunity of examining these bodies and ascertaining  what they are. Their bulk is large, and we can easily apply experiments to  them. I will take this jar (H) first, and will ask you to be prepared to  recognise hydrogen.    Think of all its qualities--the light gas which stood well in inverted  vessels, burning with a pale flame at the mouth of the jar--and see  whether this gas does not satisfy all these conditions. If it be hydrogen,  it will remain here while I hold this jar inverted.  [A light was then  applied, when the hydrogen burnt] What is there now in the other jar?  You  know that the two together made an explosive mixture.  But what can this  be which we find as the other constituent in water, and which must  therefore be that substance which made the hydrogen burn? We know that the  water we put into the vessel consisted of the two things together. We find  one of these is hydrogen: what must that other be which was in the water  before the experiment, and which we now have by itself?  I am about to put  this lighted splinter of wood into the gas.  The gas itself will not burn,  but it will make the splinter of wood burn.  [The Lecturer ignited the end  of the wood, and introduced it into the jar of gas.]  See how it  invigorates the combustion of the wood, and how it makes it burn far  better than the air would make it burn; and now you see by itself that  every other substance which is contained in the water, and which, when the  water was formed by the burning of the candle, must have been taken from  the atmosphere. What shall we call it, A, B, or C? Let us call it O--call  it \"Oxygen:\" it is a very good distinct-sounding name. This, then, is the  oxygen which was present in the water, forming so large a part of it.    We shall now begin to understand more clearly our experiments and  researches; because, when we have examined these things once or twice, we  shall soon see why a candle burns in the air. When we have in this way  analysed the water--that is to say, separated, or electrolysed its parts  out of it--we get two volumes of hydrogen, and one of the body that burns  it. And these two are represented to us on the following diagram, with  their weights also stated; and we shall find that the oxygen is a very  heavy body by comparison with the hydrogen. It is the other element in  water.    I had better, perhaps, tell you now how we get this oxygen abundantly,  having shewn you how we can separate it from the water. Oxygen, as you  will immediately imagine, exists in the atmosphere; for how should the  candle burn to produce water without it?     _____________________  |           |         |  |     1     |    8    |  |           |         |  |           | Oxygen. | Oxygen, . . . .  88.9  |           |         |  |           |_________| Hydrogen, . . .  11.1  | Hydrogen. |                           -----  |           |    9      Water,. . . . . 100.0  |           |  |           |  |           |  |___________|    Such a thing would be absolutely impossible, and chemically impossible,  without oxygen.    [Illustration: Fig. 21.]    Can we get it from the air? Well, there are some very complicated and  difficult processes by which we can get it from the air; but we have  better processes. There is a substance called the black oxide of  manganese: it is a very black-looking mineral, but very useful, and when  made red-hot it gives out oxygen. Here is an iron bottle which has had  some of this substance put into it, and there is a tube fixed to it, and a  fire ready made, and Mr. Anderson will put that retort into the fire, for  it is made of iron, and can stand the heat. Here is a salt called chlorate  of potassa, which is now made in large quantities for bleaching, and  chemical and medical uses, and for pyrotechnic and other purposes. I will  take some and mix it with some of the oxide of manganese (oxide of copper,  or oxide of iron would do as well); and if I put these together in a  retort, far less than a red heat is sufficient to evolve this oxygen from  the mixture. I am not preparing to make much, because we only want  sufficient for our experiments; only, as you will see immediately, if I  use too small a charge, the first portion of the gas will be mixed with  the air already in the retort, and I should be obliged to sacrifice the  first portion of the gas, because it would be so much diluted with air;  the first portion must therefore be thrown away. You will find in this  case, that a common spirit-lamp is quite sufficient for me to get the  oxygen, and so we shall have two processes going on for its preparation.  See how freely the gas is coming over from that small portion of the  mixture. We will examine it, and see what are its properties. Now, in this  way we are producing, as you will observe, a gas just like the one we had  in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14499"],[0,"The Religions of India (#11)"],[1,"the sacrifice, either of the morning or of the  evening. In II. 38, an evening song to Savitar, there are inner signs  that the hymn was made for rubrication, but here some fine verses  occur: \"The god extends his vast hand, his arms above there--and all  here obeys him; to his command the waters move, and even the winds'  blowing ceases on all sides.\" Again: \"Neither Indra, Varuna, Mitra,  Aryaman, Rudra, nor the demons, impair his law\" We call attention here  to the fact that the Rig Veda contains a strong(stong in the original)  current of demonology, much stronger than has been pointed out by  scholars intent on proving the primitive loftiness of the Vedic  religion.    In III. 62. 7-9 there are some verses to P[=u]shan, following which is  the most holy couplet of the Rig Veda, to repeat which is essentially  to repeat the Veda. It is the famous G[=a]yatr[=i] or S[=a]vitr[=i]  hymnlet (10-12):      Of Savitar, the heavenly, that longed-for glory may we win,    And may himself inspire our prayers.[21]    Whitney (loc. cit.) says of this hymn that it is not remarkable in any  way and that no good reason has ever been given for its fame. The good  reason for this fame, in our opinion, is that the longed-for glory was  interpreted later as a revealed indication of primitive pantheism, and  the verses were understood to express the desire of absorption into  the sun, which, as will be seen, was one of the first divine bodies to  be accepted as the type of the All-god. This is also the intent of the  stanzas added to I. 50 (above, p. 17), where S[=u]rya is \"the highest  light, the god among gods,\" mystic words, taken by later philosophers,  and quite rightly, to be an expression of pantheism. The esoteric  meaning of the G[=a]yatr[=i] presumably made it popular among the  enlightened. Exoterically the sun was only the goal of the soul, or,  in pure pantheism, of the sight. In the following[22] the  sin-forgiving side of Savitar is developed, whereby he comes into  connection with Varuna:      God Savitar deserveth now a song from us;    To-day, with guiding word, let men direct him here.    He who distributes gifts unto the sons of men,    Shall here on us bestow whatever thing is best;    For thou, O Savitar, dost first upon the gods    Who sacrifice deserve, lay immortality,    The highest gift, and then to mortals dost extend    As their apportionment a long enduring life.    Whatever thoughtless thing against the    race of gods We do in foolishness and human insolence,    Do thou from that, O Savitar, mid gods and men    Make us here sinless, etc.    But if this song smacks of the sacrifice, still more so does V. 81,  where Savitar is the 'priest's priest,' the 'arranger of sacrifice,'  and is one with P[=u]shan. He is here the swift horse (see above) and  more famous as the divider of time than anything else. In fact this  was the first ritualistic glory of Savitar, that he divides the time  for sacrifice. But he receives more in the light of being the type of  other luminous divinities. In the next hymn, another late effort (V.  82; see the dream in vs. 4), there may be an imitation of the  G[=a]yatr[=i]. Savitar is here the All-god and true lord, and frees  from sin. There is nothing new or striking in the hymns VI. 71; VII.  38 and 45. The same golden hands, and references to the sacrifice  occur here. Allusions to the Dragon of the Deep, who is called upon  with Savitar (VII. 38. 5), and the identification of Savitar with  Bhaga (ib. 6) are the most important items to be gleaned from these  rather stupid hymns. In other hymns not in the family-books  (II.-VIII.), there is a fragment, X. 139. 1-3, and another, I. 22.  5-8. In the latter, Agni's (Fire's) title, 'son of waters,' is given  to Savitar, who is virtually identified with Agni in the last part of  the Rig Veda; and in the former hymn there is an interesting  discrimination made between Savitar and P[=u]shan, who obeys him. The  last hymn in the collection to Savitar, X. 149, although late and  plainly intended for the sacrifice (vs. 5), is interesting as showing  how the philosophical speculation worked about Savitar as a centre.  'He alone, he the son of the waters, knows the origin of water, whence  arose the world.' This is one of the early speculations which recur so  frequently in the Brahmanic period, wherein the origin of 'all this'  (the universe) is referred to water. A hymn to Savitar in the first  book contains as excellent a song as is given to the sun under this  name. It is neither a morning nor an evening song in its original  state, but mentions all the god's functions, without the later moral  traits so prominent elsewhere, and with the old threefold division  instead of thrice-three heavens.         TO SAVITAR (I. 35).      I call on Agni first (the god of fire) for weal;    I call on Mitra-Varuna to aid me here;    I call upon the Night, who quiets all that moves;    On Savitar, the shining god, I call for help.    After this introductory invocation begins the real song in a different  metre.      Through space of darkness wending comes he hither,    Who puts to rest th' immortal and the mortal,    On golden car existent things beholding,    The god that rouses, Savitar, the shining;    Comes he, the shining one, comes forward, upward,    Comes with two yellow steeds, the god revered,    Comes shining Savitar from out the distance,    All difficulties far away compelling.    His pearl-adorned, high, variegated chariot,    Of which the pole is golden, he, revered,    Hath mounted, Savitar, whose beams are brilliant,    Against the darksome spaces strength assuming.    Among the people gaze the brown white-footed    (Steeds) that the chariot drag whose pole is golden.    All peoples stand, and all things made, forever,    Within the lap of Savitar, the heavenly.      [There are three heavens of Savitar, two low ones,[23]    One, men-restraining, in the realm of Yama.    As on (his) chariot-pole[24] stand all immortals,    Let him declare it who has understood it!]      Across air-spaces gazes he, the eagle,    Who moves in secret, th' Asura,[25] well-guiding,    Where is (bright) S[=u]rya now? who understands it?    And through which sky is now his ray extending?      He looks across the earth's eight elevations,[26]    The desert stations three, and the seven rivers,    The gold-eyed shining god is come, th' Arouser,    To him that worships giving wealth and blessings.      The golden-handed Savitar, the active one,    Goes earth and heaven between, compels demoniac powers,    To S[=u]rya gives assistance, and through darksome space    Extends to heaven, etc.[27]      P[=U]SHAN AND BHAGA AS SUN-GODS.    With P[=u]shan, the 'bestower of prosperity,' appears an ancient side  of sun-worship. While under his other names the sun has lost, to a  great extent, the attributes of a bucolic solar deity, in the case of  P[=u]shan he appears still as a god whose characteristics are bucolic,  war-like, and priestly, that is to say, even as he is venerated by the  three masses of the folk. It will not do, of course, to distinguish  too sharply between the first two divisions, but one can very well  compare P[=u]shan in these roles with Helios guiding his herds, and  Apollo swaying armed hosts. It is customary to regard P[=u]shan as too  bucolic a deity, but this is only one side of him. He apparently is  the sun, as herdsmen look upon him, and in this figure is the object  of ridicule with the warrior-class who, especially in one family or  tribe, take a more exalted view of him. Consequently, as in the case  of Varuna, one need not read into the hymns more than they offer to  see that, not to speak of the priestly view, there are at least two  P[=u]shans, in the Rig Veda itself.[28]    As the god 'with braided hair,' and as the 'guardian of cattle,'  P[=u]shan offers, perhaps, in these particulars, the original of  Rudra's characteristics, who, in the Vedic period, and later as  Rudra-Civa, is also a 'guardian of cattle' and has the 'braided hair.'    Bergaigne identifies P[=u]shan with Soma, with whom the poets were apt  to identify many other deities, but there seems to be little  similarity originally.[29] It is only in the wider circles of each  god's activity that the two approach each other. Both gods, it is  true, wed S[=u]rya (the female sun-power), and Soma, like P[=u]shan,  finds lost cattle. But it must be recognized once for all that  identical attributes are not enough to identify Vedic gods. Who gives  wealth? Indra, Soma, Agni, Heaven and Earth, Wind, Sun, the Maruts,  etc. Who forgives sins? Agni, Varuna, Indra, the Sun, etc. Who helps  in war? Agni, P[=u]shan, Indra, Soma, etc. Who sends rain? Indra,  Parjanya, Soma, the Maruts, P[=u]shan, etc. Who weds Dawn? The Acvins,  the Sun, etc. The attributes must be functional or the identification  is left incomplete.    The great disparity in descriptions of P[=u]shan may be illustrated by  setting VI. 48. 19 beside X. 92. 13. The former passage merely  declares that P[=u]shan is a war-leader \"over mortals, and like the  gods in glory\"; the latter, that he is \"distinguished by all divine  attributes\"; that is to say, what has happened in the case of Savitar  has happened here also. The individuality of P[=u]shan dies out, but  the vaguer he becomes the more grandiloquently is he praised and  associated with other powers; while for lack of definite laudation  general glory is ascribed to him. The true position of P[=u]shan in  the eyes of the warrior is given unintentionally by one who says,[30]  \"I do not scorn thee, O P[=u]shan,\" _i.e.,_ as do most people, on  account of thy ridiculous attributes. For P[=u]shan does not drink  _soma_ like Indra, but eats mush. So another devout believer says:  \"P[=u]shan is not described by them that call him an eater of  mush.\"[31] The fact that he was so called speaks louder than the pious  protest. Again, P[=u]shan is simply bucolic."]]]
