The Czar immediately replied with  the suggestion that the whole matter be submitted to The Hague. No reply  of any kind was ever made to this proposal by Germany.      [Illustration: THE GERMAN CONFEDERATION IN 1815 (Map: Baltic Sea on the  North, Adriatic Sea on the South, Eastern France and Belgium on the  West, Poland on the East.)]      All suggestions and negotiations looking forward to peace were brought  to a tragic end on the following day, Tuesday, July 28th, when Austria  declared war on Serbia, having speedily mobilized troops at strategic  points on the Serbian border. Russian mobilization, which had been  proceeding only in a tentative way, on the Austrian border, now became  general, and on July 30th, mobilization of the entire Russian army was  proclaimed.    Germany's effort to exclude England from the war began on Thursday, July  29th. A note, sounding Sir Edward Grey on the question of British  neutrality in the event of war was received, and a curt refusal to  commit the British Empire to such a proposal was the reply. Sir Edward  Grey, in a last determined effort to avoid a world-war, suggested to  Germany, Austria, Serbia and Russia that the military operations  commenced by Austria should be recognized as merely a punitive  expedition. He further suggested that when a point in Serbian territory  previously fixed upon should have been reached, Austria would halt and  would submit her further action to arbitration in the conference of the  Powers. Russia and Serbia agreed unreservedly to this proposition.  Austria gave a half-hearted assent to the principle involved. Germany  made no reply.    The die was cast for war on the following day, July 31st, when Germany  made a dictatorial and arrogant demand upon Russia that mobilization of  that nation's military forces be stopped within twelve hours. Russia  made no reply, and on Saturday, August 1st, Germany set the world aflame  with the dread of war's horror by her declaration of war upon Russia.    Germany's responsibility for this monumental crime against the peace of  the world is eternally fixed upon her, not only by these outward and  visible acts and negotiations, not only by her years of patient  preparation for the war into which she plunged the world. The  responsibility is fastened upon her forever by the revelations of her  own ambassador to England during this fateful period. Prince Lichnowsky,  in a remarkable communication which was given to the world, laid bare  the machinations of the German High Command and its advisers. He was a  guest of the Kaiser at Kiel on board the Imperial yacht Meteor when the  message was received informing the Kaiser of the assassination at  Sarajevo. His story continues:      Being unacquainted with the Vienna viewpoint and what was going on  there, I attached no very far-reaching significance to the event; but,  looking back, I could feel sure that in the Austrian aristocracy a  feeling of relief outweighed all others. His Majesty regretted that his  efforts to win over the Archduke to his ideas had thus been frustrated  by the Archduke's assassination.    I went on to Berlin and saw the Chancellor, von Bethmann-Hollweg. I told  him that I regarded our foreign situation as very satisfactory as it was  a long time indeed since we had stood so well with England. And in  France there was a pacifist cabinet. Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg did not  seem to share my optimism.    He complained of the Russian armaments. I tried to tranquilize him with  the argument that it was not to Russia's interest to attack us, and that  such an attack would never have English or French support, as both  countries wanted peace.    I went from him to Dr. Zimmermann (the under Secretary) who was acting  for Herr von Jagow (the Foreign Secretary), and learned from him that  Russia was about to call up nine hundred thousand new troops. His words  unmistakably denoted ill-humor against Russia, who, he said, stood  everywhere in our way. In addition, there were questions of commercial  policy that had to be settled. That General von Moltke was urging war  was, of course, not told to me. I learned, however, that Herr von  Tschirschky (the German Ambassador in Vienna) had been reproved because  he said that he had advised Vienna to show moderation toward Serbia.      Prince Lichnowsky went to his summer home in Silesia, quite unaware of the  impending crisis. He continues:      When I returned from Silesia on my way to London, I stopped only a few  hours in Berlin, where I heard that Austria intended to proceed against  Serbia so as to bring to an end an unbearable state of affairs.  Unfortunately, I failed at the moment to gauge the significance of the  news. I thought that once more it would come to nothing; that even if  Russia acted threateningly, the matter could soon be settled. I now  regret that I did not stay in Berlin and declare there and then that I  would have no hand in such a policy.    There was a meeting in Potsdam, as early as July 5th, between the German  and Austrian authorities, at which meeting war was decided on. Prince  Lichnowsky says:    I learned afterwards that at the decisive discussion at Potsdam on July  5th the Austrian demand had met with the unconditional approval of all  the personages in authority; it was even added that no harm would be  done if war with Russia did come out of it. It was so stated at least in  the Austrian report received at London by Count Mensdorff (the Austrian  Ambassador to England).    At this point I received instructions to endeavor to bring the English  press to a friendly attitude in case Austria should deal the death-blow  to \"Greater-Serbian\" hopes. I was to use all my influence to prevent  public opinion in England from taking a stand against Austria. I  remembered England's attitude during the Bosnian annexation crisis, when  public opinion showed itself in sympathy with the Serbian claims to  Bosnia; I recalled also the benevolent promotion of nationalist hopes  that went on in the days of Lord Byron and Garibaldi; and on these and  other grounds I thought it extremely unlikely that English public  opinion would support a punitive expedition against the Archduke's  murderers. I thus felt it my duty to enter an urgent warning against the  whole project, which I characterized as venturesome and dangerous, I  recommended that counsels of moderation he given Austria, as I did not  believe that the conflict could be localized (that is to say, it could  not be limited to a war between Austria and Serbia).

THE DEPOSED RULERS OF    AUSTRIA-HUNGARY The ex-Emperor Charles and his wife, the ex-Empress    Zita, in deep conversation with Hungarian leaders who are explaining    the distressing situation confronting the country.      Herr von Jagow answered me that Russia was not prepared; that there  would be more or less of a rumpus; but that the more firmly we stood by  Austria, the more surely would Russia give way. Austria was already  blaming us for flabbiness and we could not flinch. On the other hand,  Russian sentiment was growing more unfriendly all the time, and we must  simply take the risk. I subsequently learned that this attitude was  based on advices from Count Pourtales (the German Ambassador in  Petrograd), that Russia would not stir under any circumstances;  information which prompted us to spur Count Berchtold on in his course.  On learning the attitude of the German Government I looked for salvation  through English mediation, knowing that Sir Edward Grey's influence in  Petrograd could be used in the cause of peace. I, therefore, availed  myself of my friendly relations with the Minister to ask him  confidentially to advise moderation in Russia in case Austria demanded  satisfaction from the Serbians, as it seemed likely she would.    The English press was quiet at first, and friendly to Austria, the  assassination being generally condemned. By degrees, however, more and  more voices made themselves heard, in the sense that, however necessary  it might be to take cognizance of the crime, any exploitation of it for  political ends was unjustifiable. Moderation was enjoined upon Austria.  When the ultimatum came out, all the papers, with the exception of the  Standard, were unanimous in condemning it. The whole world, outside of  Berlin and Vienna, realized that it meant war, and a world war too. The  English fleet, which happened to have been holding a naval review, was  not demobilized.      The British Government labored to make the Serbian reply conciliatory,  and \"the Serbian answer was in keeping with the British efforts.\" Sir  Edward Grey then proposed his plan of mediation upon the two points  which Serbia had not wholly conceded. Prince Lichnowsky writes:      M. Cambon (for France), Marquis Imperiali (for Italy), and I were to  meet, with Sir Edward in the chair, and it would have been easy to work  out a formula for the debated points, which had to do with the  co-operation of imperial and royal officials in the inquiries to be  conducted at Belgrade. By the exercise of good will everything could  have been settled in one or two sittings, and the mere acceptance of the  British proposal would have relieved the strain and further improved our  relations with England.

Besides grapes, the most valuable of the articles of which wine is made,  there are a considerable number of fruits from which a vinous liquor is  obtained. Of such, we have in this country the gooseberry, the currant,  the elderberry, the cherry, &c. which ferment well, and affords what are  called _home-made wines_.    They differ chiefly from foreign wines in containing a much larger  quantity of acid. Dr. Macculloch[42] has remarked that the acid in  home-made wines is principally the malic acid; while in grape wines it  is the tartaric acid.    The great deficiency in these wines, independent of the flavour, which  chiefly originates, not from the juice, but from the seeds and husks of  the fruits, is the excess of acid, which is but imperfectly concealed by  the addition of sugar. This is owing, chiefly, as Dr. Macculloch  remarks, to the tartaric acid existing in the grape juice in the state  of super-tartrate of potash, which is in part decomposed during the  fermentation, and the rest becomes gradually precipitated; whilst the  malic acid exists in the currant and gooseberry juice in the form of  malate of potash; which salt does not appear to suffer a decomposition  during the fermentation of the wine; and, by its greater solubility, is  retained in the wine. Hence Dr. Macculloch recommends the addition of  super-tartrate of potash, in the manufacture of British wines. They also  contain a much larger proportion of mucilage than wines made from  grapes. The juice of the gooseberry contains some portion of tartaric  acid; hence it is better suited for the production of what is called  _English Champagne_, than any other fruit of this country.

This is by far the best treatise published in  this country on the Manufacture of Home-made Wines.          _Adulteration of Bread._      This is one of the sophistications of the articles of food most commonly  practised in this metropolis, where the goodness of bread is estimated  entirely by its whiteness. It is therefore usual to add a certain  quantity of alum to the dough; this improves the look of the bread very  much, and renders it whiter and firmer. Good, white, and porous bread,  may certainly be manufactured from good wheaten flour alone; but to  produce the degree of whiteness rendered indispensable by the caprice of  the consumers in London, it is necessary (unless the very best flour is  employed,) that the dough should be _bleached_; and no substance has  hitherto been found to answer this purpose better than alum.    Without this salt it is impossible to make bread, from the kind of flour  usually employed by the London bakers, so white, as that which is  commonly sold in the metropolis.    If the alum be omitted, the bread has a slight yellowish grey hue--as  may be seen in the instance of what is called _home-made bread_, of  private families. Such bread remains longer moist than bread made with  alum; yet it is not so light, and full of eyes, or porous, and it has  also a different taste.    The quantity of alum requisite to produce the required whiteness and  porosity depends entirely upon the genuineness of the flour, and the  quality of the grain from which the flour is obtained. The mealman makes  different sorts of flour from the same kind of grain. The best flour is  mostly used by the biscuit bakers and pastry cooks, and the inferior  sorts in the making of bread. The bakers' flour is very often made of  the worst kinds of damaged foreign wheat, and other cereal grains mixed  with them in grinding the wheat into flour. In this capital, no fewer  than six distinct kinds of wheaten flour are brought into market. They  are called fine flour, seconds, middlings, fine middlings, coarse  middlings, and twenty-penny flour. Common garden beans, and pease, are  also frequently ground up among the London bread flour.    I have been assured by several bakers, on whose testimony I can rely,  that the small profit attached to the bakers' trade, and the bad  quality of the flour, induces the generality of the London bakers to use  alum in the making of their bread.    The smallest quantity of alum that can be employed with effect to  produce a white, light, and porous bread, from an inferior kind of  flour, I have my own baker's authority to state, is from three to four  ounces to a sack of flour, weighing 240 pounds. The alum is either mixed  well in the form of powder, with a quantity of flour previously made  into a liquid paste with water, and then incorporated with the dough; or  the alum is dissolved in the water employed for mixing up the whole  quantity of the flour for making the dough.    Let us suppose that the baker intends to convert five bushels, or a sack  of flour, into loaves with the least adulteration practised. He pours  the flour into the kneading trough, and sifts it through a fine wire  sieve, which makes it lie very light, and serves to separate any  impurities with which the flour may be mixed. Two ounces of alum are  then dissolved in about a quart of boiling water, and the solution  poured into _the seasoning-tub_. Four or five pounds of salt are  likewise put into the tub, and a pailful of hot-water. When this mixture  has cooled down to the temperature of about 84 deg.,"]]]
