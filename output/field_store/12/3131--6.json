Therewith he heard voices talking roughly and a man  whistling, and athwart the glade of the wood from the northwest, or  thereabout, came new folk; and he saw at once that there went two men  a-horseback and armed; so he drew his sword and abode them close to the  want-ways. Presently they saw the shine of his war-gear, and then they  came but a little nigher ere they drew rein, and sat on their horses  looking toward him.  Then Ralph saw that they were armed and clad as  those of the company which had gone before.  One of the armed men rode  a horse-length after his fellow, and bore a long spear over his  shoulder.  But the other who rode first was girt with a sword, and had  a little axe hanging about his neck, and with his right hand he seemed  to be leading something, Ralph could not see what at first, as his left  side was turned toward Ralph and the want-way.    Now, as Ralph looked, he saw that at the spearman's saddle-bow was hung  a man's head, red-haired and red-bearded; for this man now drew a  little nigher, and cried out to Ralph in a loud and merry voice: \"Hail,  knight! whither away now, that thou ridest the green-wood sword in  hand?\"    Ralph was just about to answer somewhat, when the first man moved a  little nigher, and as he did so he turned so that Ralph could see what  betid on his right hand; and lo! he was leading a woman by a rope tied  about her neck (though her hands were loose), as though he were  bringing a cow to market.  When the man stayed his horse she came  forward and stood within the slack of the rope by the horse's head, and  Ralph could see her well, that though she was not to say naked, her  raiment was but scanty, for she had nought to cover her save one short  and strait little coat of linen, and shoes on her feet.  Yet Ralph  deemed her to be of some degree, whereas he caught the gleam of gold  and gems on her hands, and there was a golden chaplet on her head.  She  stood now by the horse's head with her hands folded, looking on, as if  what was tiding and to betide, were but a play done for her pleasure.    So when Ralph looked on her, he was silent a while; and the spearman  cried out again:  \"Ho, young man, wilt thou speak, or art thou  dumb-foundered for fear of us?\"    But Ralph knit his brows, and was first red and then pale; for he was  both wroth, and doubtful how to go to work; but he said:    \"I ride to seek adventures; and here meseemeth is one come to hand.  Or  what will ye with the woman?\"    Said the man who had the woman in tow:  \"Trouble not thine head  therewith; we lead her to her due doom.  As for thee, be glad that thou  art not her fellow; since forsooth thou seemest not to be one of them;  so go thy ways in peace.\"    \"No foot further will I go,\" said Ralph, \"till ye loose the woman and  let her go; or else tell me what her worst deed is.\"    The man laughed, and said:  \"That were a long tale to tell; and it is  little like that thou shalt live to hear the ending thereof.\"    Therewith he wagged his head at the spearman, who suddenly let his  spear fall into the rest, and spurred, and drave on at Ralph all he  might.  There and then had the tale ended, but Ralph, who was wary,  though he were young, and had Falcon well in hand, turned his wrist and  made the horse swerve, so that the man-at-arms missed his attaint, but  could not draw rein speedily enough to stay his horse; and as he passed  by all bowed over his horse's neck, Ralph gat his sword two-handed and  rose in his stirrups and smote his mightiest; and the sword caught the  foeman on the neck betwixt sallet and jack, and nought held before it,  neither leather nor ring-mail, so that the man's head was nigh smitten  off, and he fell clattering from his saddle: yet his stirrups held him,  so that his horse went dragging him on earth as he gallopped over rough  and smooth betwixt the trees of the forest.  Then Ralph turned about to  deal with his fellow, and even through the wrath and fury of the  slaying saw him clear and bright against the trees as he sat handling  his axe doubtfully, but the woman was fallen back again somewhat.    But even as Ralph raised his sword and pricked forward, the woman  sprang as light as a leopard on to the saddle behind the foeman, and  wound her arms about him and dragged him back just as he was raising  his axe to smite her, and as Ralph rode forward she cried out to him,  \"Smite him, smite!  O lovely creature of God!\"    Therewith was Ralph beside them, and though he were loth to slay a man  held in the arms of a woman, yet he feared lest the man should slay her  with some knife-stroke unless he made haste; so he thrust his sword  through him, and the man died at once, and fell headlong off his horse,  dragging down the woman with him.    Then Ralph lighted down from his horse, and the woman rose up to him,  her white smock all bloody with the slain man.  Nevertheless was she as  calm and stately before him, as if she were sitting on the dais of a  fair hall; so she said to him:    \"Young warrior, thou hast done well and knightly, and I shall look to  it that thou have thy reward.  And now I rede thee go not to the Burg  of the Four Friths; for this tale of thee shall get about and they  shall take thee, if it were out of the very Frith-stool, and there for  thee should be the scourge and the gibbet; for they of that Burg be  robbers and murderers merciless.  Yet well it were that thou ride hence  presently; for those be behind my tormentors whom thou hast slain, who  will be as an host to thee, and thou mayst not deal with them.  If thou  follow my rede, thou wilt take the way that goeth hence east away, and  then shalt thou come to Hampton under Scaur, where the folk are  peaceable and friendly.\"    He looked at her hard as she spake, and noted that she spake but  slowly, and turned red and white and red again as she looked at him.  But whatever she did, and in spite of her poor attire, he deemed he had  never seen woman so fair.  Her hair was dark red, but her eyes grey,  and light at whiles and yet at whiles deep; her lips betwixt thin and  full, but yet when she spoke or smiled clad with all enticements; her  chin round and so wrought as none was ever better wrought; her body  strong and well-knit; tall she was, with fair and large arms, and limbs  most goodly of fashion, of which but little was hidden, since her coat  was but thin and scanty.  But whatever may be said of her, no man would  have deemed her aught save most lovely.  Now her face grew calm and  stately again as it was at the first, and she laid a hand on Ralph's  shoulder, and smiled in his face and said:    \"Surely thou art fair, though thy strokes be not light.\" Then she took  his hand and caressed it, and said again: \"Dost thou deem that thou  hast done great things, fair child?  Maybe.  Yet some will say that  thou hast but slain two butchers:  and if thou wilt say that thou hast  delivered me; yet it may be that I should have delivered myself ere  long.  Nevertheless hold up thine heart, for I think that greater  things await thee.\"    Then she turned about, and saw the dead man, how his feet yet hung in  the stirrups as his fellow's had done, save that the horse of this one  stood nigh still, only reaching his head down to crop a mouthful of  grass; so she said: \"Take him away, that I may mount on his horse.\"    So he drew the dead man's feet out of the stirrups, and dragged him  away to where the bracken grew deep, and laid him down there, so to say  hidden.  Then he turned back to the lady, who was pacing up and down  near the horse as the beast fed quietly on the cool grass.  When Ralph  came back she took the reins in her hand and put one foot in the  stirrup as if she would mount at once; but suddenly lighted down again,  and turning to Ralph, cast her arms about him, and kissed his face many  times, blushing red as a rose meantime.  Then lightly she gat her up  into the saddle, and bestrode the beast, and smote his flanks with her  heels, and went her ways riding speedily toward the south-east, so that  she was soon out of sight.    But Ralph stood still looking the way she had gone and wondering at the  adventure; and he pondered her words and held debate with himself  whether he should take the road she bade him.  And he said within  himself: \"Hitherto have I been safe and have got no scratch of a weapon  upon me, and this is a place by seeming for all adventures; and little  way moreover shall I make in the night if I must needs go to Hampton  under Scaur, where dwell those peaceable people; and it is now growing  dusk already.  So I will abide the morning hereby; but I will be wary  and let the wood cover me if I may.\"    Therewith he went and drew the body of the slain man down into a little  hollow where the bracken was high and the brambles grew strong, so that  it might not be lightly seen.  Then he called to him Falcon, his horse,  and looked about for cover anigh the want-way, and found a little thin  coppice of hazel and sweet chestnut, just where two great oaks had been  felled a half score years ago; and looking through the leaves thence,  he could see the four ways clearly enough, though it would not be easy  for anyone to see him thence.    Thither he betook him, and he did the rein off Falcon, but tethered him  by a halter in the thickest of the copse, and sat down himself nigher  to the outside thereof; he did off his helm and drew what meat he had  from out his wallet and ate and drank in the beginning of the summer  night; and then sat pondering awhile on what had befallen on this  second day of his wandering.  The moon shone out presently, little  clouded, but he saw her not, for though he strove to wake awhile,  slumber soon overcame him, and nothing waked him till the night"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16921"],[0,"Plague Ship (#11)"],[1,"settled down with a grunt of satisfaction.  It was plain that the Free Traders were numbered among the nobility. They  could be sure of good trade in the days to come.    Delegations from neighboring clans arrived in close companies of ten or  twelve and were granted seats, as had been the Terrans, in groups. Dane  noted that there was no intermingling of clan with clan. And, as they  were to understand later that night, there was a very good reason for  that precaution.    \"Hope all our adaption shots work,\" Ali murmured, eyeing with no pleasure  at all the succession of platters now being borne through the inner  opening of the table.    While the Traders had learned long ago that the wisest part of valor was  not to sample alien strong drinks, ceremony often required that they  break bread (or its other world equivalent) on strange planets. And so  science served expediency and now a Trader bound for any Galactic banquet  was immunized, as far as was medically possible, against the evil  consequences of consuming food not originally intended for Terran  stomachs. One of the results being that Traders acquired a far flung  reputation of possessing bird-like appetites--since it was always better  to nibble and live, than to gorge and die.    Groft had not yet taken his place in the vacant chieftain's chair. For  the present he stood in the center of the table circle, directing the  captive slaves who circulated with the food. Until the magic moment when  the clan themselves would proclaim their overlord, he remained merely the  eldest son of the house, relatively without power.    As the endless rows of platters made their way about the table the basket  lights on the tops of the pillars were ignited, dispelling the dusk of  evening. And there was an attendant stationed by each to throw on  handsful of aromatic bark which burned with puffs of lavender smoke,  adding to the many warring scents. The Terrans had recourse at intervals  to their own pungent smelling bottles, merely to clear their heads of the  drugging fumes.    Luckily, Dane thought as the feast proceeded, that smoke from the  braziers went straight up. Had they been in a roofed space they might  have been overcome. As it was--were they entirely conscious of all that  was going on around them?    His reason for that speculation was the dance now being performed in the  center of the hall--their fight with the gorp being enacted in a series  of bounds and stabbings. He was sure that he could no longer trust his  eyes when the claw knife of the victorious dancer-hunter apparently  passed completely through the chest of another wearing a grotesque  monster mask.    As a fitting climax to their horrific display, three of the men who had  been with them on the reef entered, dragging behind them--still enmeshed  in the hunting net--the gorp which Dane had stunned. It was uncurled now  and very much alive, but the pincer claws which might have cut its way  to safety were encased in balls of hard substance.    Freed from the net, suspended by its sealed claws, the gorp swung back  and forth from a standard set up before the high seat. Its murderous jaws  snapped futilely, and from it came an enraged snake's vicious hissing.  Though totally in the power of its enemies it gave an impression of  terrifying strength and menace.    The sight of their ancient foe aroused the Salariki, inflaming warriors  who leaned across the table to hurl tongue-twisting invective at the  captive monster. Dane gathered that seldom had a living gorp been  delivered helpless into their hands and they proposed to make the most of  this wonderful opportunity. And the Terran suddenly wished the  monstrosity had fallen back into the sea. He had no soft thoughts for the  gorp after what he had seen at the reef and the tales he had heard, but  neither did he like what he saw now expressed in gestures, heard in the  tones of voices about them.    A storm priest put an end to the outcries. His dun cloak making a spot of  darkness amid all the flashing color, he came straight to the place where  the gorp swung. As he took his stand before the wriggling creature the  din gradually faded, the warriors settled back into their seats, a pool  of quiet spread through the enclosure.    Groft came up to take his position beside the priest. With both hands he  carried a two handled cup. It was not the ornamented goblet which stood  before each diner, but a manifestly older artifact, fashioned of some  dull black substance and having the appearance of being even older than  the hall or town.    One of the warriors who had helped to bring in the gorp now made a quick  and accurate cast with a looped rope, snaring the monster's head and  pulling back almost at a right angle. With deliberation the storm priest  produced a knife--the first straight bladed weapon Dane had seen on  Sargol. He made a single thrust in the soft underpart of the gorp's  throat, catching in the cup he took from Groft some of the ichor which  spurted from the wound.    The gorp thrashed madly, spattering table and surrounding Salariki with  its life fluid, but the attention of the crowd was riveted elsewhere.  Into the old cup the priest poured another substance from a flask brought  by an underling. He shook the cup back and forth, as if to mix its  contents thoroughly and then handed it to Groft.    Holding it before him the young chieftain leaped to the table top and so  to stand before the high seat. There was a hush throughout the enclosure.  Now even the gorp had ceased its wild struggles and hung limp in its  bonds.    Groft raised the cup above his head and gave a loud shout in the archaic  language of his clan. He was answered by a chant from the warriors who  would in battle follow his banner, chant punctuated with the clinking  slap of knife blades brought down forcibly on the board.    Three times he recited some formula and was answered by the others. Then,  in another period of sudden quiet, he raised the cup to his lips and  drank off its contents in a single draught, turning the goblet upside  down when he had done to prove that not a drop remained within. A shout  tore through the great hall. The Salariki were all on their feet, waving  their knives over their heads in honor to their new ruler. And Groft for  the first time seated himself in the high seat. The clan was no longer  without a chieftain. Groft held his father's place.    \"Show over?\" Dane heard Stotz murmur and Van Rycke's disappointing reply:    \"Not yet. They'll probably make a night of it. Here comes another round  of drinks--\"    \"And trouble with them,\"--that was Captain Jellico being prophetic.    \"By the Coalsack's Ripcord!\" That exclamation had been jolted out of Rip  and Dane turned to see what had so jarred the usually serene  Astrogator-apprentice. He was just in time to witness an important piece  of Sargolian social practice.    A young warrior, surely only within a year or so of receiving his knife,  was facing an older Salarik, both on their feet. The head and shoulder  fur of the older fighter was dripping wet and an empty goblet rolled  across the table to bump to the floor. A hush had fallen on the immediate  neighbors of the pair, and there was an air of expectancy about the  company.    \"Threw his drink all over the other fellow,\" Rip's soft whisper  explained. \"That means a duel--\"    \"Here and now?\" Dane had heard of the personal combat proclivities of the  Salariki.    \"Should be to the death for an insult such as that,\" Ali remarked, as  usual surveying the scene from his chosen role as bystander. As a child  he had survived the unspeakable massacres of the Crater War, nothing had  been able to crack his surface armor since.    \"The young fool!\" that was Steen Wilcox sizing up the situation from the  angle of a naturally cautious nature and some fifteen years of experience  on a great many different worlds. \"He'll be mustered out for good before  he knows what happened to him!\"    The younger Salarik had barked a question at his elder and had been  promptly answered by that dripping warrior. Now their neighbors came to  life with an efficiency which suggested that they had been waiting for  such a move, it had happened so many times that every man knew just the  right procedure from that point on.    In order for a Sargolian feast to be a success, the Terrans gathered from  overheard remarks, at least one duel must be staged sometime during the  festivities. And those not actively engaged did a lot of brisk betting in  the background.    \"Look there--at that fellow in the violet cloak,\" Rip directed Dane. \"See  what he just laid down?\"    The nobleman in the violet cloak was not one of Groft's liege men, but a  member of the delegation from another clan. And what he had laid down on  the table--indicating as he did so his choice as winner in the coming  combat, the elder warrior--was a small piece of white material on which  reposed a slightly withered but familiar leaf. The neighbor he wagered  with, eyed the stake narrowly, bending over to sniff at it, before he  piled up two gem set armlets, a personal scent box and a thumb ring to  balance.    At this practical indication of just how much the Terran herb was  esteemed Dane regretted anew their earlier ignorance. He glanced along  the board and saw that Van Rycke had noted that stake and was calling  their Captain's attention to it.    But such side issues were forgotten as the duelists vaulted into the  circle rimmed by the table, a space now vacated for their action. They  were stripped to their loin cloths, their cloaks thrown aside. Each  carried his net in his right hand, his claw knife ready in his left. As  yet the Traders had not seen Salarik against Salarik in action and in  spite of themselves they edged forward in their seats, as intent as the  natives upon what was to come. The finer points of the combat were lost  on them, and they did not understand "]]]
