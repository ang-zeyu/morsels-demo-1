In constructing the records of their history they did  not work backwards from the light of the present into an ever darkening  past, but they began from the beginning in the full light of the gods  from whom all things sprang, and mythology passed into history by  imperceptible gradations. They knew more about the beginning when all  things were completely in the hands of the gods than they did about  their immediate past. Art began very early to make them familiar with  the appearance of the gods, so that there was little that was mysterious  about their religion, so little that the element of mystery had later to  be almost artificially cultivated in the \"mysteries.\" They respected the  gods rather than feared them, and they felt that the gods would do them  no harm unless they themselves first sinned against them or their own  fellow-men, and the oracles of Delphi were no more terrifying to them  than the coming of the word of God was to the prophets of Israel. They  were accustomed to these messages, which were almost every-day affairs.  It was all a part of that marvellous poise of nature which made the  every-day mortal Greek almost as calm as the unperturbed imperturbable  faces of their gods as their great sculptors saw them.    In Rome all was very different. The superstitious element in the Italian  character, which amazes us so much to-day when cultured twentieth  century men and women in good society persecute their fellows because of  the evil eye, is a heritage of many thousand years. Sometimes it seems  as if it were the Italian birthright, the blight of Etruria which came  into their nature in spite of themselves. It required centuries to  educate the Roman into the concept of personal individual gods. He had  begun his theological career by terror of unknown powers all about him,  and by regarding religion as the science of propitiating the right power  on the right occasion. One could not know these powers, one did not  desire to. Their gods were at once their masters and their servants, but  never their companions. The early Roman knew no such thing as an oracle,  the only messages from the gods were the expressions of their wrath, in  the sending of prodigies and portents. They did indeed consult the gods  by watching the flight of birds or studying the entrails of the  sacrifice, but it was merely to obtain a \"yes or no\" answer to a  categorical question as to whether a certain act was pleasing to the  gods. Otherwise all about them lay mystery, and at the point where sight  failed, since neither imagination nor faith carried them any further,  superstition stepped in, and the more they thought of the gods the more  terrified they became. Now if you present to a people thus constituted a  divine book of infallible oracles, you increase their terror in greater  measure than the book itself can assuage it, and with the use of the  book the simpler forms of their old belief will grow less and less  effective in the face of this new \"witchcraft,\" which can work wonders.  And no matter how you may hedge the use of the book about, it will be  used more and more as the craving for magic is increasingly aroused.    The study of the outward and the inward effects of the Sibylline books  is therefore the real history of religion in the first half of the  republic. The outward effects are seen in the introduction of a series  of Greek gods, who were in themselves in the main eminently respectable,  and whose presence was in itself no offence to good morals, and if we  stop there we fail to understand why the religious interest of the  Second Punic War should change so quickly to the scepticism of the  following century. The inward effects however, which, though they are  hard to see, may yet be discovered between the lines of the chronicle,  will explain all the undermining of foundation, until we wonder not why  the structure collapsed so suddenly but how it managed to last so long.    The history of the activity of the books begins peaceably enough. In the  year B.C. 496 Rome was in a bad way; her crops had failed and the  importation of grain from Latium was rendered very difficult because of  the war with the Latins in which she was engaged. In her distress she  turned to the Sibylline books, and on the occasion of this their first  recorded use, the oracles ordered the introduction into Rome of the cult  of three Greek deities, Demeter, Dionysos, and Kore. It was a most  appropriate and characteristic choice. In the first place the deities in  question were worshipped at Cumae, the home of the books, whence Rome  could, and probably did, borrow the cult; and in the second place  Demeter was the goddess of grain, and it was from Cumae that Rome was  already beginning to obtain her imported grain supply. Thus the coming  of the Cumaean Demeter into the religious world of Rome is but the  sacred parallel to the coming of Cumaean grain into the material world  of Rome. The Greek goddess of grain came with the grain, just as Castor  had come with the Greek cavalry, with this essential distinction however  that Demeter came by the incantation of the books and the enactment of  the Senate, whereas Castor's coming was a slow and normal development.    It is important to notice closely exactly what happened when these  deities were introduced, partly because they form the first recorded  instance, and hence may well have acted as a model for subsequent  repetitions of the act, but also because we have a more definite  knowledge of the phenomena in this case than in many others. In the  first place it is clear that the deities were felt to be foreign: not  only was their temple built out the Aventine way, in the valley of the  Circus Maximus, outside the _pomerium_, but--a much more significant  fact--their Greek names were dropped, and they were given Roman names  instead, to make them seem less out of place. Then too these Roman names  were not new names, translations of their Greek titles, but were the  names of already existing Roman deities with whom they were easily  identified, so that we see at once that their coming was no real  enrichment of the Roman Olympus; what they stood for was already  represented there, and their coming was simply a reduplication, with the  consequent result that as these parvenus increased in prominence and  influence, they robbed of all their vitality the sober old Roman deities  to whom they had attached themselves. What were these original deities  who were thus doomed to death in B.C. 496? Demeter took the name of the  old Roman goddess Ceres, a goddess of fertility, about whom we know just  enough to assert that she belonged to the old religion of Numa and that  she was at heart quite a different person from Demeter. All the rest is  lost, submerged under the new Demeter-Ceres with her temple built by  Greek architects and her April games. It is this new Ceres who soon  develops an extraordinary political importance because her temple is to  the Plebeians as a class what the temple of Minerva is to the unions of  organised labour. It is there that they have their meeting-place, and  the temple itself is always their treasury as contrasted with the Saturn  temple, the treasury of the state as a whole. The very officers of the  Plebeians, the famous Plebeian aediles, get their name from association  with this temple (_aedes_). This political side of her activity is the  only real advantage, except the grain itself, connected with her  importation; the two form at best a poor economic compensation for the  ever increasing immoral effects of the public games of Ceres.    But though Ceres is the most important of the three deities economically  and politically, we must not forget the other two, both of whom are  interesting, though one of them more for what she is not than for what  she is. Along with Demeter came Dionysos and Demeter's daughter Kore:  the three were associated in the solemn mysteries of Eleusis, but none  of the beauty of these ideas went over into the Roman cult. Demeter was  merely the deified grain-traffic, and Dionysos was little else than the  god of wine, while poor Kore fell out without any particular content for  a curious reason that we shall see in a moment. The only old Roman deity  with whom Dionysos could be identified was the god Liber, who had had a  rather interesting history, and who had done enough along the line of  self-development to deserve a better fate than to be crushed to  insignificance under the prominence of his new namesake. Liber was at  this time a flourishing god of fertility and, since the introduction of  the grape into Italy, especially the patron of the fruit of the vine,  but he had made his own career, and there was a time when he had no  individuality of his own but was merely a cult-adjective of the great  god Juppiter, the giver of all fertility in every phase of life. Thus  out of the original Juppiter-Liber there had grown the independent god  Liber; and now this Liber lost his individuality by identification with  Dionysos. Finally comes Kore, Demeter's daughter. Here the Romans were  hard put to it to find a goddess who represented any similar content,  and after all this was no light task because Kore has little meaning  unless she is taken also as Persephone, Pluto's bride--a process which  required a mythological knowledge and appreciation in which the Romans  of the early republic were totally lacking. But there was an old goddess  Libera, a shadowy potentiality contrasted and paired with the masculine  Liber, and they chose her and gave Kore her name. We have a curious  proof of how little the Romans knew of Kore-Libera, and of how purely  mechanical both "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18233"],[0,"Animal Ghosts; Or, Animal Hauntings and the Hereafter (#11)"],[1,"strictly moderate throughout, and  because she does not seem to have been biassed by any special views on  the subject of animal futurity.    Correspondent No. 2 (who, by the way, is a total stranger to the writer  whose letter I have just quoted) is candidly devoted to dogs, regarding  them as in every way on a par with, if not actually superior to, most  human beings. Still, notwithstanding this partiality, and consequent  profusion of terms of endearment, which will doubtless prove somewhat  nauseating to many, her letter is, in my opinion, valuable, because it  not only refers to the phenomenon I have mentioned, but to a certain  extent furnishes a reason for its occurrence. The lady writes as  follows:--    \"I once had a rough-haired dachshund, Robert, whom I loved devotedly. We  were living at the time near H---- Street, which always had a peculiar  attraction for dear Robert, who, I am now obliged to confess, had rather  too much liberty--more, indeed, than eventually proved good for him. The  servants complained that Robert ruled the house, and I believe what they  said was true, for my sister and I idolized him, giving him the very  best of everything and never having the heart to refuse him anything he  wanted. You will probably scarcely credit it, but I have sat up all  night nursing him when he had a cold and was otherwise indisposed. Can  you therefore imagine my feelings when my darling was absent one day  from dinner? Such a thing had never happened before, for, fond of  morning 'constitutionals' as poor Robert was, he was always the soul of  punctuality at meal times.    \"Neither my sister nor I would hear of eating anything. Whilst he was  missing, not a morsel did we touch, but slipping on our hats, and  bidding the servants do the same, we scoured the neighbourhood instead.  The afternoon passed without any sign of Robert, and when bedtime came  (he always slept in our room) and still no signs of our pet, I thought  we should both have gone mad. Of course, we advertised, selecting the  most popular and, accordingly, the most likely papers, and we resorted  to other mediums, too, but, alas! it was hopeless. Our darling little  Robert was irrevocably, irredeemably lost. For days we were utterly  inconsolable, doing nothing but mope morning, noon, and night. I cannot  tell you how forlorn we felt, nor how long we should have remained in  that state but for an incident which, although revealing the terrible  manner of his death, gave us every reason to feel sure we were not  parted from him for all time, but would meet again in the great  hereafter. It happened in this wise: I was walking along W---- Street  one evening when, to my intense joy and surprise, I suddenly saw my  darling standing on the pavement a few feet ahead of me, regarding me  intently from out of his pathetic brown eyes. A sensation of extreme  coldness now stole over me, and I noticed with something akin to a shock  that, in spite of the hot, dry weather, Robert looked as if he had been  in the rain for hours. He wore the bright yellow collar I had bought him  shortly before his disappearance, so that had there been any doubt as to  his identity that would have removed it instantly. On my calling to him,  he turned quickly round and, with a slight gesture of the head as if  bidding me to follow, he glided forward. My natural impulse was to run  after him, pick him up and smother him with kisses; but try as hard as I  could, I could not diminish the distance between us, although he never  appeared to alter his pace. I was quite out of breath by the time we  reached H---- Street, where, to my surprise, he stopped at No. 90 and,  turning round again, gazed at me in the most beseeching manner. I can't  describe that look; suffice it to say that no human eyes could have been  more expressive, but of what beyond the most profound love and sorrow I  cannot, I dare not, attempt to state. I have pondered upon it through  the whole of a mid-summer night, but not even the severest of my mental  efforts have enabled me to solve it to my satisfaction. Could I but do  that, I feel I should have fathomed the greatest of all mysteries--the  mystery of life and death.    \"I do not know for how long we stood there looking at one another, it  may have been minutes or hours, or, again, but a few paltry seconds. He  took the initiative from me, for, as I leaped forward to raise him in my  arms, he glided through the stone steps into the area.    \"Convinced now that what I beheld was Robert's apparition, I determined  to see the strange affair through to the bitter end, and entering the  gate, I also went down into the area. The phantom had come to an abrupt  halt by the side of a low wooden box, and as I foolishly made an  abortive attempt to reach it with my hand, it vanished instantaneously.  I searched the area thoroughly, and was assured that there was no  outlet, save by the steps I had just descended, and no hole, nor nook,  nor cranny where anything the size of Robert could be completely hidden  from sight. What did it all mean? Ah! I knew Robert had always had a  weakness for exploring areas, especially in H---- Street, and in the box  where his wraith disappeared I espied a piece of raw meat!    \"Now there are ways in which a piece of raw meat may lie without  arousing suspicion, but the position of this morsel strangely suggested  that it had been placed there carefully, and for assuredly no other  purpose than to entice stray animals. Resolving to interrogate the owner  of the house on the subject, I rapped at the front door, but was  informed by the manservant, obviously a German, that his master never  saw anyone without an appointment. I then did a very unwise thing--I  explained the purpose of my visit to this man, who not only denied any  knowledge of my dog, but declared the meat must have been thrown into  the area by some passer-by.    \"'No one in dis house trow away gut meat like dat,' he explained, 'we  eat all we can git here, we have nutting for de animals. Please go away  at once, or de master will be very angry. He stand no nonsense from  anyone.'    \"And as I had no alternative--for, after all, who would regard a ghost  in the light of evidence?--I had to obey. I found out, however, from a  medical friend that No. 90 was tenanted by Mr. K----, an Anglo-German  who was deemed a very clever fellow at a certain London hospital, where  he was often occupied in vivisection.    \"'I dare say,' my friend went on to remark, 'K---- does a little  vivisecting in his private surgery, by way of practice, and--well, you  see, these foreign chaps are not so squeamish in some respects as we  are.'    \"'But can't he be stopped?' I asked. 'It is horrible, monstrous that he  should be allowed to murder our pets.'    \"'You don't know for certain that he has,' was the reply, 'you only  suppose so from what you say you saw, and evidence of that immaterial  nature is no evidence at all. No, you can do nothing except to be extra  careful in future, and if you have another dog make him steer clear of  No. 90 H---- Street.'    \"I was sensible enough to see that he was right, and the matter dropped.  I soon noticed one thing, however, namely, that there were no more  pieces of meat temptingly displayed in the box, so it is just possible  K---- got wind of my enquiries, and thought it policy to desist from his  nefarious practices.    \"Poor Robert! To think of him suffering such a cruel and ignominious  death, and my being powerless to avenge it. Surely if vivisection is  really necessary, and the welfare of mankind cannot be advanced by any  less barbarous system, why not operate on creatures less deserving of  our love and pity than dogs? On creatures which whilst being nearer  allied to man in physiology and anatomy, are at the same time far below  the level of brute creation in character and disposition.    \"For example, why not experiment on wife-beaters and cowardly street  ruffians, and, one might reasonably add, on all those  pseudo-humanitarians who, by their constant petitions to Parliament for  the abolition of the lash, encourage every form of blackguardism and  bestiality?\"    This concludes the letter of correspondent No. 2, and with the sentiment  in the closing paragraphs I must say I heartily agree--only I should  like to add a few more people to the list.    One other case of haunting of this type is taken from my same work.    \"One All Hallow E'en,\" wrote a Mrs. Sebuim, \"I was staying with some  friends in Hampstead, and we amused ourselves by working spells, to  commemorate the night. There is one spell in which one walks alone down  a path sowing hempseed, and repeating some fantastic words; when one is  supposed to see those that are destined to come into one's life in the  near future. Eager to put this spell to the test, I went into the garden  by myself and, walking boldly along a path, bordered on each side by  evergreens, sprinkled hempseed lavishly.    \"Nothing happening, I was about to desist, when suddenly I heard a  pattering on the gravel, and turning round I beheld an ugly little  black-and-tan mongrel running towards me, wagging its stumpy tail. Not  at all prepossessed with the creature, for my own dogs are pure-bred,  and thinking it must have strayed into the grounds, I was about to  drive it out, and had put down my hand to prevent it jumping on my  dress, when, to my astonishment, it had vanished. It literally melted  away into fine air beneath my very eyes. Not knowing what to make of the  incident, but feeling inclined to attribute it to a trick of the  imagination, I rejoined my friends. I did not tell them what had  happened, although I made a memorandum of it in one of my innumerable  notebooks. Within six months of this incident I was greatly astonished  to find a dog, corresponding with the one I have just described, running  about on the lawn of my house in Bath.
