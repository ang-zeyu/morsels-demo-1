[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18613"],[0,"The Golden Scorpion (#11)"],[1," sat down to consider the papers  bearing upon the death of Eriksen. For half an hour he read on  steadily and made a number of pencil notes. Then he desisted and sat  staring straight before him.    What possible motive could there be in assassinating these people? The  case of the Grand Duke might be susceptible of explanation, but those  of Henrik Ericksen and Sir Frank Narcombe were not. Furthermore he  could perceive no links connecting the three, and no reason why they  should have engaged the attention of a common enemy. Such crimes would  seem to be purposeless. Assuming that \"The Scorpion\" was an individual,  that individual apparently was a dangerous homicidal maniac.    But, throughout the documents, he could discover no clue pointing to  the existence of such an entity. \"The Scorpion\" might be an invention  of the fertile brain of M. Gaston Max; for it had become more and more  evident, as he had read, that the attempt to trace these deaths to an  identical source had originated at the Service de Surete, and it was  from Paris that the name \"The Scorpion\" had come. The fate of Max was  significant, of course. The chances of his death proving to have been  due to accident were almost negligible and the fact that a fragment of  a golden scorpion had actually been found upon his body was certainly  curious.    \"Close your shutters at night....\"    How the words haunted him and how hotly he despised himself for a  growing apprehension which refused to be ignored. It was more mental  than physical, this dread which grew with the approach of midnight,  and it resembled that which had robbed him of individuality and all  but stricken him inert when he had seen upon the moon-bright screen of  the curtains the shadow of a cowled man.    Dark forces seemed to be stirring, and some unseen menace crept near  to him out of the darkness.    The house was of early Victorian fashion and massive folding shutters  were provided to close the French windows. He never used them, as a  matter of fact, but now he tested the fastenings which kept them in  place against the inner wall and even moved them in order to learn if  they were still serviceable.    Of all the mysteries which baffled him, that of the piece of  cardboard in the envelope sealed with a Chinese coin was the most  irritating. It seemed like the purposeless trick of a child, yet it  had led to the presence of the cowled man--and to the presence of  Mlle. Dorian. Why?    He sat down at his table again.    \"Damn the whole business!\" he said. \"It is sending me crazy.\"    Selecting from the heap of documents a large sheet of note-paper  bearing a blue diagram of a human bust, marked with figures and  marginal notes, he began to read the report to which it was  appended--that of Dr. Halesowen. It stated that the late Sir Frank  Narcombe had a \"horizontal\" heart, slightly misplaced and dilatated,  with other details which really threw no light whatever upon the  cause of his death.    \"_I_ have a horizontal heart,\" growled Stuart--\"and considering my  consumption of tobacco it is certainly dilatated. But I don't expect  to drop dead in a theatre nevertheless.\"    He read on, striving to escape from that shadowy apprehension, but as  he read he was listening to the night sounds of London, to the  whirring of distant motors, the whistling of engines upon the railway  and dim hooting of sirens from the Thames. A slight breeze had arisen  and it rustled in the feathery foliage of the acacias and made a  whispering sound as it stirred the leaves of the privet hedge.    The drone of an approaching car reached his ears. Pencil in hand, he  sat listening. The sound grew louder, then ceased. Either the car  had passed or had stopped somewhere near the house. Came a rap on  the door.    \"Yes,\" called Stuart and stood up, conscious of excitement.    Mrs. M'Gregor came in.    \"There is nothing further you'll be wanting to-night?\" she asked.    \"No,\" said Stuart, strangely disappointed, but smiling at the old  lady cheerfully. \"I shall turn in very shortly.\"    \"A keen east wind has arisen,\" she continued, severely eyeing the  opened windows, \"and even for a medical man you are strangely  imprudent. Shall I shut the windows?\"    \"No, don't trouble, Mrs. M'Gregor. The room gets very stuffy with  tobacco smoke, and really it is quite a warm night. I shall close  them before I retire, of course.\"    \"Ah well,\" sighed Mrs. M'Gregor, preparing to depart. \"Good-night,  Mr. Keppel.\"    \"Good-night, Mrs. M'Gregor.\"    She retired, and Stuart sat staring out into the darkness. He was  not prone to superstition, but it seemed like tempting providence to  remain there with the windows open any longer. Yet paradoxically, he  lacked the moral courage to close them--to admit to himself that he  was afraid!    The telephone bell rang, and he started back in his chair as though  to avoid a blow.    By doing so he avoided destruction.    At the very instant that the bell rang out sharply in the silence--so  exact is the time-table of Kismet--a needle-like ray of blue light  shot across the lawn from beyond and above the hedge and--but for  that nervous start--must have struck fully upon the back of Stuart's  skull. Instead, it shone past his head, which it missed only by  inches, and he experienced a sensation as though some one had  buffeted him upon the cheek furiously. He pitched out of his chair  and on to the carpet.    The first object which the ray touched was the telephone; and next,  beyond it, a medical dictionary; beyond that again, the grate, in  which a fire was laid.    \"My God!\" groaned Stuart--\"what is it!\"    An intense crackling sound deafened him, and the air of the room  seemed to have become hot as that of an oven. There came a series of  dull reports--an uncanny wailing ... and the needle-ray vanished.  A monstrous shadow, moon-cast, which had lain across the carpet of  the lawn--the shadow of a cowled man--vanished also.    Clutching the side of his head, which throbbed and tingled as though  from the blow of an open hand, Stuart struggled to his feet. There  was smoke in the room, a smell of burning and of fusing metal. He  glared at the table madly.    The mouthpiece of the telephone had vanished!    \"My God!\" he groaned again, and clutched at the back of the chair.    His dictionary was smouldering slowly. It had a neat round hole some  three inches in diameter, bored completely through, cover to cover!  The fire in the grate was flaring up the chimney!    He heard the purr of a motor in the lane beside the house. The room  was laden with suffocating fumes. Stuart stood clutching the chair and  striving to retain composure--sanity. The car moved out of the lane.    Someone was running towards the back gate of the house ... was  scrambling over the hedge ... was racing across the lawn!    A man burst into the study. He was a man of somewhat heavy build,  clean-shaven and inclined to pallor. The hirsute blue tinge about his  lips and jaw lent added vigour to a flexible but masterful mouth. His  dark hair was tinged with grey, his dark eyes were brilliant with  excitement. He was very smartly dressed and wore light tan gloves. He  reeled suddenly, clutching at a chair for support.    \"Quick! quick!\" he cried--\"the telephone! ... Ah!\"    Just inside the window he stood, swaying and breathing rapidly, his  gaze upon the instrument.    \"_Mon Dieu!_\" he cried--\"what has happened, then!\"    Stuart stared at the new-comer dazedly.    \"Hell has been in my room!\" he replied. \"That's all!\"    \"Ah!\" said the stranger--\"again he eludes me! The telephone was the  only chance. _Pas d'blaque!_ we are finished!\"    He dropped into a chair, removed his light grey hat and began to dry  his moist brow with a fine silk handkerchief. Stuart stared at him  like a man who is stupefied. The room was still laden with strange  fumes.    \"_Blimey!_\" remarked the new-comer, and his Whitechapel was as perfect  as his Montmatre. He was looking at the decapitated telephone. \"This  is a knock-out!\"    \"Might I ask,\" said Stuart, endeavouring to collect his scattered  senses, \"where you came from?\"    \"From up a tree!\" was the astonishing reply. \"It was the only way  to get over!\"    \"Up a tree!\"    \"Exactly. Yes, I was foolish. I am too heavy. But what could I do!  We must begin all over again.\"    Stuart began to doubt his sanity. This was no ordinary man.    \"Might I ask,\" he said, \"who you are and what you are doing in my  house?\"    \"Ah!\" The stranger laughed merrily. \"You wonder about me--I can see  it. Permit me to present myself--Gaston Max, at your service!\"    \"Gaston Max!\" Stuart glared at the speaker incredulously. \"Gaston Max!  Why, I conduct a _post mortem_ examination upon Gaston Max tomorrow,  in order to learn if he was poisoned!\"    \"Do not trouble, doctor. That poor fellow is not Gaston Max and he  was not poisoned. You may accept my word for it. I had the misfortune  to strangle him.\"        PART II    STATEMENT OF GASTON MAX        I. THE DANCER OF MONTMARTRE      CHAPTER I    ZARA EL-KHALA      The following statement which I, Gaston Max, am drawing up in  duplicate for the guidance of whoever may inherit the task of tracing  \"The Scorpion\"--a task which I have begun--will be lodged--one copy at  the Service de Surete in Paris, and the other copy with the  Commissioner of Police, New Scotland Yard. As I apprehend that I may be  assassinated at any time, I propose to put upon record all that I have  learned concerning the series of murders which I believe to be  traceable to a certain person. In the event of my death, my French  colleagues will open the sealed packet containing this statement and  the English Assistant Commissioner of the Special Branch responsible  for international affairs will receive instructions to open that which  I shall have lodged at Scotland Yard.    This matter properly commenced, then, with the visit to Paris,  incognito, of the Grand Duke Ivan,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18637"],[0,"The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation (#11)"],[1,"joined the \"firm league of friendship\" on March 1, 1781, the need for a  revenue amendment was widely conceded. Congress under the Articles  lacked authority to levy taxes. She could only request the States to  contribute their fair share to the common treasury, but the requested  amounts were not forthcoming. To remedy this defect, Congress applied to  the States for power to lay duties and secure the public debts. Twelve  States agreed to such an amendment, but Rhode Island refused her  consent, thereby defeating the proposal.    Thus was emphasized a second weakness in the Articles of Confederation,  namely, the _liberum veto_ which each State possessed whenever  amendments to that instrument were proposed. Not only did all amendments  have to be ratified by each of the 13 States, but all important  legislation needed the approval of 9 States. With several delegations  often absent, one or two States were able to defeat legislative  proposals of major importance.    Other imperfections in the Articles of Confederation also proved  embarrassing. Congress could, for example, negotiate treaties with  foreign powers, but all treaties had to be ratified by the several  States. Even when a treaty was approved, Congress lacked authority to  secure obedience to its stipulations. Congress could not act directly  upon the States or upon individuals. Under such circumstances foreign  nations doubted the value of a treaty with the new republic.    Furthermore, Congress had no authority to regulate foreign or interstate  commerce. Legislation in this field, subject to unimportant exceptions,  was left to the individual States. Disputes between States with common  interests in the navigation of certain rivers and bays were inevitable.  Discriminatory regulations were followed by reprisals.    Virginia, recognizing the need for an agreement with Maryland respecting  the navigation and jurisdiction of the Potomac River, appointed in June  1784, four commissioners to \"frame such liberal and equitable  regulations concerning the said river as may be mutually advantageous to  the two States.\" Maryland in January 1785 responded to the Virginia  resolution by appointing a like number of commissioners[e] \"for the  purpose of settling the navigation and jurisdiction over that part of  the bay of Chesapeake which lies within the limits of Virginia, and over  the rivers Potomac and Pocomoke\" with full power on behalf of Maryland  \"to adjudge and settle the jurisdiction to be exercised by the said  States, respectively, over the waters and navigations of the same.\"[f]    At the invitation of Washington the commissioners met at Mount Vernon,  in March 1785, and drafted a compact which, in many of its details  relative to the navigation and jurisdiction of the Potomac, is still in  force.[g] What is more important, the commissioners submitted to their  respective States a report in favor of a convention of all the States  \"to take into consideration the trade and commerce\" of the  Confederation. Virginia, in January 1786, advocated such a convention,  authorizing its commissioners to meet with those of other States, at a  time and place to be agreed on, \"to take into consideration the trade of  the United States; to examine the relative situations and trade of the  said States; to consider how far a uniform system in their commercial  regulations may be necessary to their common interest and their  permanent harmony; and to report to the several States, such an act  relative to this great object, as when unanimously ratified by them,  will enable the United States in Congress, effectually to provide for  the same.\"[h]    This proposal for a general trade convention seemingly met with general  approval; nine States appointed commissioners. Under the leadership of  the Virginia delegation, which included Randolph and Madison, Annapolis  was accepted as the place and the first Monday in September 1786 as the  time for the convention. The attendance at Annapolis proved  disappointing. Only five States--Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New  Jersey, and New York--were represented; delegates from Massachusetts,  New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Rhode Island failed to attend.  Because of the small representation, the Annapolis convention did not  deem \"it advisable to proceed on the business of their mission.\" After  an exchange of views, the Annapolis delegates unanimously submitted to  their respective States a report in which they suggested that a  convention of representatives from all the States meet at Philadelphia  on the second Monday in May 1787 to examine the defects in the existing  system of government and formulate \"a plan for supplying such defects as  may be discovered.\"[i]    The Virginia legislature acted promptly upon this recommendation and  appointed a delegation to go to Philadelphia. Within a few weeks New  Jersey, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Delaware, and Georgia also made  appointments. New York and several other States hesitated on the ground  that, without the consent of the Continental Congress, the work of the  convention would be extra-legal; that Congress alone could propose  amendments to the Articles of Confederation. Washington was quite  unwilling to attend an irregular convention. Congressional approval of  the proposed convention became, therefore, highly important. After some  hesitancy Congress approved the suggestion for a convention at  Philadelphia \"for the sole and express purpose of revising the Articles  of Confederation and reporting to Congress and the several legislatures  such alterations and provisions therein as shall when agreed to in  Congress and confirmed by the States render the Federal Constitution  adequate to the exigencies of Government and the preservation of the  Union.\"    Thereupon, the remaining States, Rhode Island alone excepted, appointed  in due course delegates to the Convention, and Washington accepted  membership on the Virginia delegation.    Although scheduled to convene on May 14, 1787, it was not until May 25  that enough delegates were present to proceed with the organization of  the Convention. Washington was elected as presiding officer. It was  agreed that the sessions were to be strictly secret.    On May 29 Randolph, on behalf of the Virginia delegation, submitted to  the convention 15 propositions as a plan of government. Despite the fact  that the delegates were limited by their instructions to a revision of  the Articles, Virginia had really recommended a new instrument of  government. For example, provision was made in the Virginia plan for the  separation of the three branches of government; under the Articles  executive, legislative, and judicial powers were vested in the Congress.  Furthermore the legislature was to consist of two houses rather than  one.    On May 30 the Convention went into a committee of the whole to consider  the 15 propositions of the Virginia plan _seriatim_. These discussions  continued until June 13, when the Virginia resolutions in amended form  were reported out of committee. They provided for proportional  representation in both houses. The small States were dissatisfied.  Therefore, on June 14 when the Convention was ready to consider the  report on the Virginia plan, Paterson of New Jersey requested an  adjournment to allow certain delegations more time to prepare a  substitute plan. The request was granted, and on the next day Paterson  submitted nine resolutions embodying important changes in the Articles  of Confederation, but strictly amendatory in nature. Vigorous debate  followed. On June 19 the States rejected the New Jersey plan and voted  to proceed with a discussion of the Virginia plan. The small States  became more and more discontented; there were threats of withdrawal. On  July 2 the convention was deadlocked over giving each State an equal  vote in the upper house--five States in the affirmative, five in the  negative, one divided.[j]    The problem was referred to a committee of 11, there being 1 delegate  from each State, to effect a compromise. On July 5 the committee  submitted its report, which became the basis for the \"great compromise\"  of the convention. It was recommended that in the upper house each State  should have an equal vote, that in the lower branch each State should  have one representative for every 40,000 inhabitants, counting  three-fifths of the slaves, that money bills should originate in the  lower house (not subject to amendment by the upper chamber). When on  July 12 the motion of Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania that direct  taxation should also be in proportion to representation, was adopted, a  crisis had been successfully surmounted. A compromise spirit began to  prevail. The small States were now willing to support a strong national  government.    Debates on the Virginia resolutions continued. The 15 original  resolutions had been expanded into 23. Since these resolutions were  largely declarations of principles, on July 24 a committee of five[k]  was selected to draft a detailed constitution embodying the fundamental  principles which had thus far been approved. The Convention adjourned  from July 26 to August 6 to await the report of its committee of detail.  This committee, in preparing its draft of a Constitution, turned for  assistance to the State constitutions, to the Articles of Confederation,  to the various plans which had been submitted to the Convention and  other available material. On the whole the report of the committee  conformed to the resolutions adopted by the Convention, though on many  clauses the members of the committee left the imprint of their  individual and collective judgments. In a few instances the committee  avowedly exercised considerable discretion.    From August 6 to September 10 the report of the committee of detail was  discussed, section by section, clause by clause. Details were attended  to, further compromises were effected."]]]
