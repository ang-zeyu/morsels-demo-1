From generation to  generation, a chair sits familiarly in the midst of human interests, and  is witness to the most secret and confidential intercourse, that mortal  man can hold with his fellow. The human heart may best be read in the  fireside chair. And as to external events, Grief and Joy keep a continual  vicissitude around it and within it. Now we see the glad face and glowing  form of Joy, sitting merrily in the old chair, and throwing a warm  fire-light radiance over all the household. Now, while we thought not of  it, the dark clad mourner, Grief, has stolen into the place of Joy, but  not to retain it long. The imagination can hardly grasp so wide a subject,  as is embraced in the experience of a family chair.\"    \"It makes my breath flutter,--my heart thrill,--to think of it,\" said  Laurence. \"Yes; a family chair must have a deeper history than a Chair of  State.\"    \"O, yes!\" cried Clara, expressing a woman's feeling on the point in  question, \"The history of a country is not nearly so interesting as that  of a single family would be.\"    \"But the history of a country is more easily told,\" said Grandfather. \"So,  if we proceed with our narrative of the chair, I shall still confine  myself to its connection with public events.\"    Good old Grandfather now rose and quitted the room, while the children  remained gazing at the chair. Laurence, so vivid was his conception of  past times, would hardly have deemed it strange, if its former occupants,  one after another, had resumed the seat which they had each left vacant,  such a dim length of years ago.    First, the gentle and lovely lady Arbella would have been seen in the old  chair, almost sinking out of its arms, for very weakness; then Roger  Williams, in his cloak and band, earnest, energetic, and benevolent; then  the figure of Anne Hutchinson, with the like gesture as when she presided  at the assemblages of women; then the dark, intellectual face of Vane,  \"young in years, but in sage counsel old.\" Next would have appeared the  successive governors, Winthrop, Dudley, Bellingham, and Endicott, who sat  in the chair, while it was a Chair of State. Then its ample seat would  have been pressed by the comfortable, rotund corporation of the honest  mint-master. Then the half-frenzied shape of Mary Dyer, the persecuted  Quaker woman, clad in sackcloth and ashes, would have rested in it for a  moment. Then the holy apostolic form of Eliot would have sanctified it.  Then would have arisen, like the shade of departed Puritanism, the  venerable dignity of the white-bearded Governor Bradstreet. Lastly, on the  gorgeous crimson cushion of Grandfather's chair, would have shone the  purple and golden magnificence of Sir William Phips.    But, all these, with the other historic personages, in the midst of whom  the chair had so often stood, had passed, both in substance and shadow,  from the scene of ages. Yet here stood the chair, with the old Lincoln  coat of arms, and the oaken flowers and foliage, and the fierce lion's  head at the summit, the whole, apparently, in as perfect preservation as  when it had first been placed in the Earl of Lincoln's Hall. And what vast  changes of society and of nations had been wrought by sudden convulsions  or by slow degrees, since that era!    \"This chair has stood firm when the thrones of kings were overturned!\"  thought Laurence. \"Its oaken frame has proved stronger than many frames of  government!\"    More the thoughtful and imaginative boy might have mused; but now a large  yellow cat, a great favorite with all the children, leaped in at the open  window. Perceiving that Grandfather's chair was empty, and having often  before experienced its comforts, puss laid herself quietly down upon the  cushion. Laurence, Clara, Charley, and little Alice, all laughed at the  idea of such a successor to the worthies of old times.    \"Pussy,\" said little Alice, putting out her hand, into which the cat laid  a velvet paw, \"you look very wise. Do tell us a story about GRANDFATHER'S  CHAIR!\"            PART II          Chapter I      \"O Grandfather,\" dear Grandfather, cried little Alice, \"pray tell us some  more stories about your chair!\"    How long a time had fled, since the children had felt any curiosity to  hear the sequel of this venerable chair's adventures! Summer was now past  and gone, and the better part of Autumn likewise. Dreary, chill November  was howling, out of doors, and vexing the atmosphere with sudden showers  of wintry rain, or sometimes with gusts of snow, that rattled like small  pebbles against the windows.    When the weather began to grow cool, Grandfather's chair had been removed  from the summer parlor into a smaller and snugger room. It now stood by  the side of a bright blazing wood-fire. Grandfather loved a wood-fire, far  better than a grate of glowing anthracite, or than the dull heat of an  invisible furnace, which seems to think that it has done its duty in  merely warming the house. But the wood-fire is a kindly, cheerful,  sociable spirit, sympathizing with mankind, and knowing that to create  warmth is but one of the good offices which are expected from it.  Therefore it dances on the hearth, and laughs broadly through the room,  and plays a thousand antics, and throws a joyous glow over all the faces  that encircle it.    In the twilight of the evening, the fire grew brighter and more cheerful.  And thus, perhaps, there was something in Grandfather's heart, that  cheered him most with its warmth and comfort in the gathering twilight of  old age. He had been gazing at the red embers, as intently as if his past  life were all pictured there, or as if it were a prospect of the future  world, when little Alice's voice aroused him.    \"Dear Grandfather,\" repeated the little girl, more earnestly, \"do talk to  us again about your chair.\"    Laurence, and Clara, and Charley, and little Alice, had been attracted to  other objects, for two or three months past. They had sported in the  gladsome sunshine of the present, and so had forgotten the shadowy region  of the past, in the midst of which stood Grandfather's chair. But now, in  the autumnal twilight, illuminated by the flickering blaze of the  wood-fire, they looked at the old chair and thought that it had never  before worn such an interesting aspect. There it stood, in the venerable  majesty of more than two hundred years. The light from the hearth quivered  upon the flowers and foliage, that were wrought into its oaken back; and  the lion's head at the summit seemed almost to move its jaws and shake its  mane.    \"Does little Alice speak for all of you?\" asked Grandfather. \"Do you wish  me to go on with the adventures of the chair?\"    \"Oh, yes, yes, Grandfather!\" cried Clara. \"The dear old chair! How strange  that we should have forgotten it so long!\"    \"Oh, pray begin, Grandfather,\" said Laurence; \"for I think, when we talk  about old times, it should be in the early evening before the candles are  lighted. The shapes of the famous persons, who once sat in the chair, will  be more apt to come back, and be seen among us, in this glimmer and  pleasant gloom, than they would in the vulgar daylight. And, besides, we  can make pictures of all that you tell us, among the glowing embers and  white ashes.\"    Our friend Charley, too, thought the evening the best time to hear  Grandfather's stories, because he could not then be playing out of doors.  So, finding his young auditors unanimous in their petition, the good old  gentleman took up the narrative of the historic chair, at the point where  he had dropt it.          Chapter II      \"You recollect, my dear children,\" said Grandfather, \"that we took leave  of the chair in 1692, while it was occupied by Sir William Phips. This  fortunate treasure-seeker, you will remember, had come over from England,  with King William's commission to be Governor of Massachusetts. Within the  limits of this province were now included the old colony of Plymouth, and  the territories of Maine and Nova Scotia. Sir William Phips had likewise  brought a new charter from the king, which served instead of a  constitution, and set forth the method in which the province was to be  governed.\"    \"Did the new charter allow the people all their former liberties?\"  inquired Laurence.    \"No,\" replied Grandfather. \"Under the first charter, the people had been  the source of all power. Winthrop, Endicott, Bradstreet, and the rest of  them, had been governors by the choice of the people, without any  interference of the king. But henceforth the governor was to hold his  station solely by the king's appointment, and during his pleasure; and the  same was the case with the lieutenant-governor, and some other high  officers. The people, however, were still allowed to choose  representatives; and the governor's council was chosen by the general  court.\"    \"Would the inhabitants have elected Sir William Phips,\" asked Laurence,  \"if the choice of governor had been left to them?\"    \"He might probably have been a successful candidate,\" answered  Grandfather; \"for his adventures and military enterprises had gained him a  sort of renown, which always goes a great way with the people. And he had  many popular characteristics, being a kind, warm-hearted man, not ashamed  of his low origin, nor haughty in his present elevation. Soon after his  arrival, he proved that he did not blush to recognize his former  associates.\"    \"How was that?\" inquired Charley.    \"He made a grand festival at his new brick house,\" said Grandfather, \"and  invited all the ship-carpen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15699"],[0,"A Handbook of the Boer War (#11)"],[1,"   [Footnote 16: In 1902 the Vryheid and Utrecht districts of the Transvaal  were annexed to Natal and the wedge disappeared.]    [Footnote 17: They were indeed authorized as early as October 18 to  throw it aside but by that time they were committed to its use.]    [Footnote 18: \"Long Tom,\" which was afterwards sent to Ladysmith and  subsequently to bombard Rhodes in Kimberley.]    [Illustration: Sketch map of Northern Natal.]          CHAPTER III    Deus Ex Machina No. I      The arrival of Sir Redvers Buller at Cape Town on October 31, 1899, the  morrow of the battle of Lombard's Kop, encouraged the despondent at home  and in Cape Colony.[19] Twenty years previously he had distinguished  himself in the command of a Boer contingent which served with the  British Army during the Zulu campaign; and it was doubtless from the  experience then gained that he formed the opinion that the war which he  was now called upon to direct, could be brought to a successful  conclusion only \"by the actual conquest of every man in the field: a  task doubly difficult owing to the extreme mobility of the enemy.\"    In his first telegram to Lord Lansdowne he described the situation as  one of \"extreme gravity.\"    White, with five-sixths of the British Troops in South Africa, was shut  up in Ladysmith; a month at least must elapse before the Expeditionary  Force, which the British Government had on September 22 decided to send  out, would be able to take the field; Mafeking was besieged; the diamond  men of Kimberley, like a passionate child interned in a dark room, were  screaming for release; Sir Alfred Milner was pleading that the defence  of the Cape Peninsula, an area of a few thousand square miles as far  removed from the front as Marseilles is from Berlin, must be first  attended to; President Steyn had overcome his scruples and was sending  Free State commandos across the Orange River into the Cape Colony at  Bethulie and Norval's Pont; the disaffected colonials were restive; and  the fall of Ladysmith, which seemed probable, would lay Natal open from  the Tugela to the Indian Ocean.    It was a dismal outlook; but Buller, after a few days' review of the  situation, was able to report that in his opinion the opposition would  probably collapse when Kimberley and Ladysmith were relieved. His  optimism at Capetown was destined soon to be superseded by pessimism on  the Tugela. He compared himself to a man who, having a busy day before  him, has overslept himself. The original plan of campaign, a march on  Pretoria through the Free State, had necessarily to be postponed; and  the important railway junctions at Naauwpoort and Stormberg were too  weakly held and too liable to investment by the Free State commandos  which had crossed the Orange to justify their retention, and the little  garrisons were withdrawn. To Gatacre and French, who had just escaped  from Ladysmith, was assigned the duty of holding the centre, while Lord  Methuen advanced to the relief of Kimberley.    It was, however, the situation in Natal which gave the most anxiety to  Buller. The Free State commandos which had been seen passing Ladysmith  shortly before the investment were now at Colenso, having driven back to  Estcourt the small British force which was all that was left to stem the  tide of an invasion. The Free Staters, fortunately, were not active and  delayed to avail themselves of the opportunity. When at length, after  eleven days of inertia, L. Botha persuaded Joubert to undertake an  offensive movement south of the Tugela, it had passed away, as Estcourt  had in the meantime been reinforced by troops from England under the  command of Hildyard.    Encouraged by the capture of an armoured train at Chieveley, Joubert  advanced south in two bodies, one on each side of Estcourt, and seized  the railway at Highlands, thus cutting off Hildyard's communication with  Pietermaritzburg; and Hildyard having no cavalry was unable to touch  him. The raid, which for a time seemed dangerous, was however soon  checked by troops coming up from the south under Barton, and Joubert  found himself pressed between two forces each as strong as his own.  After an action at Willow Grange, which each side claimed as a victory,  Joubert, fearing lest he should be cut off, retired unpursued, against  the wishes of the more pushful and energetic Botha, who was in favour of  an advance on Pietermaritzburg.    The alarms and excursions of October and November were the cause of the  dissolution of a military apparatus which had been put together at home  with much care and thought, and which had never yet been seen in  warfare. Its designers and constructors were proud of it and they looked  forward with confidence to its successful working. The apparatus was the  British Army Corps. It was taken to pieces as soon as it reached South  Africa; but fortunately the ties, ligaments, and braces which held it  together yielded to slight pressure and little difficulty was  experienced in resolving it into its constituent elements. The more  important of these were despatched to Natal and the rest were  distributed over the western and central commands.    Buller, perhaps leaving the pessimistic atmosphere of Capetown with  relief, went by sea to Durban, the defence of which was entrusted to the  Royal Navy, and reached Pietermaritzburg on November 25. By this time  the situation had improved all along the line, and it seemed that it  might still be possible to resume the original plan of a central advance  on Bloemfontein and Pretoria as soon as Ladysmith was relieved. The Boer  raid towards southern Natal which caused so much consternation had been  easily foiled and British troops were now at Frere.    Buller, soon after his arrival in Natal, found himself in command of a  force of 19,000 men with whom to tackle about 21,000 Boers under the  command of L. Botha. Joubert was invalided after the unsuccessful  Estcourt raid, and the change was, from the enemy's point of view, for  the better. The new Head Commandant was a more strenuous and active  leader than his predecessor.    Little was known of the topography of the country in which Buller was  about to operate. It had never been systematically surveyed, and the  existing maps had been constructed for agricultural rather than for  campaigning purposes, and could not be trusted. The Tugela formed the  ditch of a natural fortress covering Ladysmith. On its left bank rose an  almost continuous ridge or rampart from which the easy open ground on  the right bank could be watched for miles, and reconnaissances kept at a  distance.    Reconnaissances were, however, not needed to prove to Buller that  Colenso, where the railway passed up into the Tugela ridge, was immune  to a frontal attack, and that Ladysmith must be relieved by a turning  movement. Two alternatives offered themselves. The advance might be made  through Weenen and across the Tugela some distance below Colenso, and  thence to Elandslaagte, where the Boer line of communication with the  Transvaal might be cut; but to Ladysmith this was a circuitous route. It  also would necessitate the traversing of a rough bush country, into  which Buller was reluctant to throw raw troops just off the transports  who had not yet heard the sounds of war.    He therefore decided upon a westerly flank march by way of Potgieter's  Drift, twenty miles west of Colenso; and once on the left bank of the  Tugela he would be within a day's march of Ladysmith and the railway  into the Free State. White was heliographically consulted, and all the  arrangements for an advance on December 11 were made. The force had even  been set in motion when certain disturbing news came out of the west.  Gatacre had suffered a reverse at Stormberg, and simultaneously Methuen  had been roughly handled at Magersfontein, and was unable to continue  his march on Kimberley.    The strategic timidity of Buller and his curious habit of allowing  himself to be influenced by psychological probabilities were at once  apparent. The anticipated moral effect of these successes upon the enemy  swayed him back to the plan which a day or two previously he had  rejected as impracticable. The plan of a flank march by way of  Potgieter's Drift was thrown aside. It might have been justifiable in  the presence of a dispirited enemy; but now the burghers on the Tugela  had been suddenly encouraged by news of victories won on two widely  separated scenes of action and were no doubt anxious to rival the  exploits of their comrades far away.[20] The flank march would expose  the army to the danger of being cut off by a quickened and revived foe,  and Buller determined not to run the risk. On December 12 he ordered an  advance on Colenso.    The course of the war in the western and central scenes of action up to  the time of the two defeats which caused Buller to revise the plan of  campaign for Natal must now be traced.    [Sidenote: Map p. 260.]    The force of nearly 10,000 men under Lord Methuen detailed by Buller for  the relief of Kimberley, advanced from De Aar and Orange River Bridge  along the railway. At Belmont a body of Free Staters under Jacob  Prinsloo was found strongly posted on the heights east of the line, and  although reinforced by Delarey from Kimberley, it was unable to hold to  its positions, and was compelled to retreat eastwards on November 23.    Prinsloo withdrew with his Free Staters across the border, but was  persuaded by Delarey, who had fallen back on Graspan about eight miles  N.E. of Belmont, to rejoin him; and a favourable position was occupied  on a group of kopjes astride the railway, where on November 25 another  battle was fought, in which the Naval Brigade suffered a loss of nearly  half its strength. The enemy, though driven back, retreated in good  order, as at Belmont two days previously, there being no cavalry  available for effective pursuit. Methuen pushed on to Witkoplaagte.    The"]]]
