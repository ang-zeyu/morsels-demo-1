I have always been impressed in reading the books of John Ruskin to  note how many times he speaks about the hands. Very truly, indeed,  does he recognize that back of all hand work there is heart-thought,  commanding, directing, actually building. It shows everywhere. The  building of a wall with the stones rightly placed demands _honor_. The  builder may be rude, but if his hands place the stones faithfully one  upon another, there is surely honor in his heart. If it were not so  his hands could not work faithfully.    If the work is finer, like that work in gold which many have learned  eagerly in former times, in Rome and Florence, still the spirit must  be the same. So we see, that be the work coarse or fine, it is in  either case prompted by the same kind of heart-thought.    Many times in these Talks I have spoken of Ruskin's words to you; for  two reasons: first, his words are always full of meaning, because he  was so full of thought when he wrote them; and second, I would have  you, from the first days, know something of him and elect him to your  friendship. Many times he will speak to you in short, rude words,  impatiently too, but never mind that, his heart is warm and full of  good.    Now from what was said a moment ago about the stone work and the gold  work we can understand these words:    \"No distinction exists between artist and artisan, except that of  higher genius or better conduct.\"    Learn from this then, be the work of our hands what it may, its first  quality and the first things for which it shall be judged are its  honor, its faithfulness, and its sincerity.    Of themselves the hands are absolutely without power. They cannot  move, they cannot do good things nor bad things, they can do nothing  until we command them. And how shall this be done? Surely I can  understand it if you have wearied of this Talk a little. But I have  said all the things just for the sake of answering this question, so  that you should understand it. How do we command? not the hands alone  but all we do and say?    By our THOUGHTS.    Without them there is no power whatever. Until they have commanded,  the hands cannot make a motion; the feet must have direction ordered  to them, the tongue must be bidden to speak, and without the command  there is nothing.    Of course, all these Talks are about thoughts. But we shall need a  little time to speak of them particularly. And little by little it  will be clear to us all why the hands need to act thoughtfully. Now  the harm of the world is done by two forces,--by evil thought and by  thoughtlessness. Then it is no wonder that Ruskin speaks much about  the hands, for it is thought that gives them guidance. Can you wonder,  that when he says, \"the idle and loud of tongue\" he associates the  \"_useless hand_.\"[54] These things go together, and together they come  either from evil thought or from lack of thought. The moment Ruskin  speaks of one who uses his hands with honor, his words glow. So he  speaks of the laborer, describing him as \"silent, serviceable,  honorable, keeping faith, untouched by change, to his country and to  Heaven.\"    Thus, when we are earnestly asked to do something worthy with the  hands every day, we can understand why. I do not mean one worthy  thing, but some one particular worthy act, especially thought out by  us. To do that daily with forethought will purify the heart. It will  teach us to devote the hands to that which is worthy. Then another old  truth that every one knows will be clear to us: \"As a man--or a child,  for that matter--thinketh in his heart, _so he is_.\"    Bit by bit the thoughts of this Talk will become clear to you. You  will feel more friendly toward them. Then you will really begin to  think about hands; your own hands and everybody's hands. You will  become truthful of hand, guiding your own thoughtfully; watching those  of others carefully. And you will find that in the smallest tasks of  your hands you can put forethought, while every use to which people  put their hands will teach you something if you observe carefully. It  may be folding a paper or picking up a pin, or anything else quite  common; that matters not, common things, like any others, can be done  rightly.    By this observation we shall see hands performing all sorts of odd  tricks. The fingers are drumming, twitching, twirling, closing,  opening, doing a multitude of motions which mean what? Nothing, do you  say? Oh! no, indeed; not _nothing_ but _something_. Fingers and hands  which perform all these unnecessary motions are not being commanded by  the thoughts, and are acting as a result of _no_ thought; that is, of  thoughtlessness. Every one does it do you say? No, that is not true.  Many do these things, but those who command their thoughts never allow  it. If we never moved the hands except in a task when we commanded  them, we should soon become hand-skilled. The useless movements I have  spoken of _un_skill the hand. They are undoing motions, and teach us  that we must govern ourselves if we would become anything. Do you know  how it is that people do great things? They command themselves. Having  determined to do something, they work and work and work to finish it  at any cost. That gives strength and character.    Having observed the hands and their duties, we can readily see the  kind of task they must do in music. It is just the same kind of task  as laying a wall of stone. Every motion must be done honorably.  Everything must be thought out in the mind and heart before the hands  are called upon to act. Wise people always go about their tasks this  way. Unwise people try the other way, of acting first and thinking it  out afterward, and, of course, they always fail. You can now  understand that a great pianist is one who has great thought with  which to command the hands. And to be sure they will obey his commands  at once, he has made them obey him continuously for years. This  teaching the hands to obey is called Practice.    The Italian artist, Giotto, once said:    \"You may judge my masterhood of craft by seeing that I can draw a  circle unerringly.\"          CHAPTER XVII.    WHAT THE ROMAN LADY SAID.        \"You may always be successful if you do but set out well, and let    good thoughts and practice proceed upon right method.\"--_Marcus    Aurelius._[55]    The same wise Roman emperor who said this tells us a very pretty thing  about his mother, which shows us what a wise lady she must have been,  and how in the days of his manhood, with the cares of a great nation  upon him, he yet pondered upon the childhood teaching of home. First,  he speaks of his grandfather Verus, who, by his example, taught him  not to be prone to anger; then of his father, the Emperor Antoninus  Pius, from whom he learned to be modest and manly; then of his mother,  whose name was Domitia Calvilla. Let us read some of his own words  about her, dwelling particularly upon a few of them. He writes: \"As  for my mother, she taught me to have regard for religion, to be  generous and open-handed, and not only to forbear from doing anybody  an ill turn, _but not so much as to endure the thought of it_.\"    Now these words are the more wonderful when we remember that they were  not taken down by a scribe in the pleasant apartments of the royal  palace in Rome, but were written by the Emperor himself on the  battlefield; for this part of his famous book is signed: \"Written in  the country of the Quadi.\"    In our last Talk on the Hands we came to the conclusion, that unless  the hands were commanded they could not act. And on inquiring as to  what gave these commands we found it was the thoughts. Many people  believe it is perfectly safe to think anything, to have even evil  thoughts in their hearts, for thoughts being hidden, they say, cannot  be seen by others. But a strange thing about thought is this: The  moment we have a thought, good or bad, it strives to get out of us and  become an action. And it most always succeeds. Not at once, perhaps,  for thoughts like seeds will often slumber a long time before they  spring into life. So it becomes very clear to us that if we wish to be  on the alert we must not watch our actions, but look within and guard  the thoughts; for they are the springs of action.    You now see, I am sure, how wise the Emperor's mother was in teaching  her boy not even to _endure_ a thought to do evil unto others. For the  thought would get stronger and stronger, and suddenly become an  action. Certainly; and hence the first thing to learn in this Talk is  just these words:    Thoughts become actions.    That is an important thing. In a short time you will see, that if you  do not learn it you can never enjoy music, nor beautiful things, nor  the days themselves. Let us see how this will come about.    I have told your teacher[56] the name of the book which was written by  the Roman lady's boy. Well, in that book, running through it like a  golden thread, is this bit of teaching from his mother.    Not only did he think of it and write it on the battlefield, but at  all times there seemed to come to him more and more wisdom from it.  And he tells us this same thought over and over again in different  words. Sometimes it leads him to say very droll things; for instance:    \"Have you any sense in your head? Yes. Why do you not make use of it  then? For if this does its part, for what more can you wish?\"[57]  Then, a very good thought which we frequently hear:    \"Your manners will very much depend upon what you frequently  think.\"[58] There are many others, but these show us that the meaning  of his mother's words went deep, teaching that not action must be  guarded but the thought which gives rise to action. Now, what can be  the value of speaking about the Roman lady? Let us see.    In music, the tones are made either by the hands or by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14360"],[0,"The Dawn and the Day (#11)"],[1," fall,    Piercing the victor 'mid triumphant shouts,    Piercing the mighty monarch on his throne;    While from a towering cypress growing near    Every disease to which frail flesh is heir    Like ravening vultures watch each arrow's flight,    And quick as thought glide off on raven's wings    To bring the wounded, writhing victim in--    As well-trained hunters mark their master's aim,    Then fly to bring the wounded quarry home.    Meanwhile a stifling stench rose from below--    As from a battle-field where nations met    And fiery ranks of living valor fought,    Now food for vultures, moldering cold and low--    And bleaching bones were scattered everywhere.      Startled he wakes and rises from his couch.    The lamps shine down with soft and mellow light.    The fair Yasodhara still lay in sleep,    But not in quiet sleep.  Her bosom heaved    As if a sigh were seeking to escape;    Her brows were knit as if in pain or fear,    And tears were stealing from her close-shut lids.    But sweet Rahula slept, and sleeping smiled    As if he too those cherub faces saw.    In haste alone he noiselessly stole forth    To wander in the park, and cool his brow    And calm his burdened, agitated soul.    The night had reached that hour preceding dawn    When nature seems in solemn silence hushed,    Awed by the glories of the coming day.    The moon hung low above the western plains;    Unnumbered stars with double brightness shine,    And half-transparent mists the landscape veil,    Through which the mountains in dim grandeur rise.    Silent, alone he crossed the maidan wide    Where first he saw the sweet Yasodhara,    Where joyful multitudes so often met,    Now still as that dark valley of his dream.    He passed the lake, mirror of heaven's high vault,    Whose ruffled waters ripple on the shore,    Stirred by cool breezes from the snow-capped peaks;    And heedless of his way passed on and up,    Through giant cedars and the lofty pines,    Over a leafy carpet, velvet soft,    While solemn voices from their branches sound,    Strangely in unison with his sad soul;    And on and up until he reached a spot    Above the trees, above the mist-wrapped world,    Where opening chasms yawned on every side.    Perforce he stopped; and, roused from revery,    Gazed on the dark and silent world below.    The moon had sunk from sight, the stars grew dim,    And densest darkness veiled the sleeping world,    When suddenly bright beams of rosy light    Shot up the east; the highest mountain-top    Glittered as if both land and sea had joined    Their richest jewels and most costly gems    To make its crown; from mountain-peak to peak    The brightness spread, and darkness slunk away,    Until between two giant mountain-tops    Glittered a wedge of gold; the hills were tinged,    And soon the sun flooded the world with light    As when the darkness heard that first command:    \"Let there be light!\" and light from chaos shone.    Raptured he gazed upon the glorious scene.    \"And can it be,\" he said, \"with floods of light    Filling the blue and boundless vault above,    Bathing in brightness mountain, hill and plain,    Sending its rays to ocean's hidden depths,    With light for bird and beast and creeping thing,    Light for all eyes, oceans of light to spare,    That man alone from outer darkness comes,    Gropes blindly on his brief and restless round,    And then in starless darkness disappears?    There must be light, fountains of living light,    For which my thirsty spirit pining pants    As pants the hunted hart for water-brooks--    Another sun, lighting a better world,    Where weary souls may find a welcome rest.    Gladly I'd climb yon giddy mountain-heights,    Or gladly take the morning's wings and fly    To earth's remotest bounds, if light were there,    Welcome to me the hermit's lonely cell,    And welcome dangers, labors, fastings, pains--    All would be welcome could I bring the light    To myriads now in hopeless darkness sunk.    Farewell to kingdom, comforts, home and friends!    All will I leave to seek this glorious light.\"    The die is cast, the victory is gained.    Though love of people, parent, wife and child,    Half selfish, half divine, may bid him pause,    A higher love, unselfish, all divine,    For them and every soul, bade him go forth    To seek for light, and seek till light be found.    Home he returned, now strong to say farewell.      Meanwhile the sweet Yasodhara still slept,    And dreamed she saw Siddartha's empty couch.    She dreamed she saw him flying far away,    And when she called to him he answered not,    But only stopped his ears and faster flew    Until he seemed a speck, and then was gone.    And then she heard a mighty voice cry out:    \"The time has come--his glory shall appear!\"    Waked by that voice, she found his empty couch,    Siddartha gone, and with him every joy;    But not all joy, for there Rahula lay,    With great wide-open eyes and cherub smile,    Watching the lights that flickered on the wall.    Caught in her arms she pressed him to her heart    To still its tumult and to ease its pain.      But now that step she knew so well is heard.    Siddartha comes, filled with unselfish love    Until his face beamed with celestial light    That like a holy halo crowned his head.    Gently he spoke: \"My dearest and my best,    The time has come--the time when we must part.    Let not your heart be troubled--it is best.\"    This said, a tender kiss spoke to her heart,    In love's own language, of unchanging love.    When sweet Rahula stretched his little arms,    And cooing asked his share of tenderness,    Siddartha from her bosom took their boy,    And though sore troubled, both together smiled,    And with him playing, that sweet jargon spoke,    Which, though no lexicon contains its words,    Seems like the speech of angels, poorly learned,    For every sound and syllable and word    Was filled brimful of pure and perfect love.    At length grown calm, they tenderly communed    Of all their past, of all their hopes and fears;      And when the time of separation came,    His holy resolution gave her strength    To give the last embrace and say farewell.    And forth he rode,[2] mounted on Kantaka,    A prince, a loving father, husband, son,    To exile driven by all-embracing love.      What wonder, as the ancient writings say,    That nature to her inmost depths was stirred,    And as he passed the birds burst forth in song,    Fearless of hawk or kite that hovered near?    What wonder that the beasts of field and wood,    And all the jungle's savage denizens,    Gathered in groups and gamboled fearlessly,    Leopards with kids and wolves with skipping lambs?    For he who rode alone, bowed down and sad,    Taught millions, crores[3] of millions, yet unborn    To treat with kindness every living thing.    What wonder that the deepest hells were stirred?    What wonder that the heavens were filled with joy?    For he, bowed down with sorrow, going forth,    Shall come with joy and teach all men the way    From earth's sad turmoil to Nirvana's rest.      [1]In the \"Light of Asia\" the prince is made to leave his young wife  before the birth of their son, saying: \"Whom, if I wait to bless, my  heart will fail,\"--a piece of cowardice hardly consistent with my  conception of that brave and self-denying character.    [2]In the \"Light of Asia,\" the prince, after leaving his young wife, is  made to pass through a somewhat extensive harem _en deshabille_, which  is described with voluptuous minuteness.  Although there are some  things in later Buddhistic literature that seem to justify it, I can  but regard the introduction of an institution so entirely alien to  every age, form and degree of Aryan civilization and so inconsistent  with the tender conjugal love which was the strongest tie to his  beloved home, as a serious blot on that beautiful poem and as  inconsistent with its whole theory, for no prophet ever came from a  harem.    [3]A crore is ten millions.            BOOK IV.      Far from his kingdom, far from home and friends,    The prince has gone, his flowing locks close shorn,    His rings and soft apparel laid aside,    All signs of rank and royalty cast off.    Clothed in a yellow robe, simple and coarse,    Through unknown streets from door to door he passed,    Holding an alms-bowl forth for willing gifts.    But when, won by his stateliness and grace,    They brought their choicest stores, he gently said:    \"Not so, my friends, keep such for those who need--    The sick and old; give me but common food.\"    And when sufficient for the day was given,    He took a way leading without the walls,    And through rich gardens, through the fruitful fields,    Under dark mangoes and the jujube trees,    Eastward toward Sailagiri, hill of gems;    And through an ancient grove, skirting its base,    Where, soothed by every soft and tranquil sound,    Full many saints were wearing out their days    In meditation, earnest, deep, intent,    Seeking to solve the mystery of life,    Seeking, by leaving all its joys and cares,    Seeking, by doubling all its woes and pains,    To gain an entrance to eternal rest;    And winding up its rugged sides, to where    A shoulder of the mountain, sloping west,    O'erhangs a cave with wild figs canopied.    This mountain cave was now his dwelling-place,    A stone his pillow, and the earth his bed,    His earthen alms-bowl holding all his stores    Except the crystal waters, murmuring near.    A lonely path, rugged, and rough, and steep;    A lonely cave, its stillness only stirred    By eagle's scream, or raven's solemn croak,    Or by the distant city's softened sounds,    Save when a sudden tempest breaks above,    And rolling thunders shake the trembling hills--    A path since worn by countless pilgrims' feet,    Coming from far to view this hallowed spot,    And bow in worship on his hard, cold bed,"]]]
