But seeing how extraordinary were the adventures of the  tooth in historical times, it would be unreasonable to deny that it  may have been smuggled out of India for safety.]    [Footnote 67: Various accounts are given of the disposal of these  teeth, but more than enough relics were preserved in various shrines  to account for all. Hsuan Chuang saw or heard of sacred teeth in  Balkh, Nagar, Kashmir, Kanauj and Ceylon. Another tooth is said to be  kept near Foo-chow.]    [Footnote 68: Plausibly supposed to be Puri. The ceremonies still  observed in the temple of Jagannath are suspected of being based on  Buddhist rites. Dantapura of the Kalingas is however mentioned in some  verses quoted in Digha Nikaya XIX. 36.

The Vinaya of the  Mulasarvastivadins and similar texts speak of offering flowers to a  tooth of the Buddha. See _J.A._ 1914, II. pp. 523, 543.

But here, there can be no  question of an opening of any sort. The door was fastened, and through  the window blinds, secure as they were, not even a fly could enter or  get out.\"    \"True, true,\" assented Rouletabille as he kept on drying his forehead,  which seemed to be perspiring less from his recent bodily exertion than  from his mental agitation. \"Indeed, it's a great, a beautiful, and a  very curious mystery.\"    \"The Bete du bon Dieu,\" muttered Daddy Jacques, \"the Bete du bon Dieu  herself, if she had committed the crime, could not have escaped. Listen!  Do you hear it? Hush!\"    Daddy Jacques made us a sign to keep quiet and, stretching his arm  towards the wall nearest the forest, listened to something which we  could not hear.    \"It's answering,\" he said at length. \"I must kill it. It is too wicked,  but it's the Bete du bon Dieu, and, every night, it goes to pray on the  tomb of Sainte-Genevieve and nobody dares to touch her, for fear that  Mother Angenoux should cast an evil spell on them.\"    \"How big is the Bete du bon Dieu?\"    \"Nearly as big as a small retriever,--a monster, I tell you. Ah!--I have  asked myself more than once whether it was not her that took our poor  Mademoiselle by the throat with her claws. But the Bete du bon Dieu does  not wear hobnailed boots, nor fire revolvers, nor has she a hand like  that!\" exclaimed Daddy Jacques, again pointing out to us the red mark  on the wall. \"Besides, we should have seen her as well as we would have  seen a man--\"    \"Evidently,\" I said. \"Before we had seen this Yellow Room, I had also  asked myself whether the cat of Mother Angenoux--\"    \"You also!\" cried Rouletabille.    \"Didn't you?\" I asked.    \"Not for a moment. After reading the article in the 'Matin,' I knew  that a cat had nothing to do with the matter. But I swear now that  a frightful tragedy has been enacted here. You say nothing about the  Basque cap, or the handkerchief, found here, Daddy Jacques?\"    \"Of course, the magistrate has taken them,\" the old man answered,  hesitatingly.    \"I haven't seen either the handkerchief or the cap, yet I can tell you  how they are made,\" the reporter said to him gravely.    \"Oh, you are very clever,\" said Daddy Jacques, coughing and embarrassed.    \"The handkerchief is a large one, blue with red stripes and the cap is  an old Basque cap, like the one you are wearing now.\"    \"You are a wizard!\" said Daddy Jacques, trying to laugh and not quite  succeeding. \"How do you know that the handkerchief is blue with red  stripes?\"    \"Because, if it had not been blue with red stripes, it would not have  been found at all.\"    Without giving any further attention to Daddy Jacques, my friend took a  piece of paper from his pocket, and taking out a pair of scissors, bent  over the footprints. Placing the paper over one of them he began to cut.  In a short time he had made a perfect pattern which he handed to me,  begging me not to lose it.    He then returned to the window and, pointing to the figure of Frederic  Larsan, who had not quitted the side of the lake, asked Daddy Jacques  whether the detective had, like himself, been working in The Yellow  Room?    \"No,\" replied Robert Darzac, who, since Rouletabille had handed him the  piece of scorched paper, had not uttered a word, \"He pretends that he  does not need to examine The Yellow Room. He says that the murderer  made his escape from it in quite a natural way, and that he will, this  evening, explain how he did it.\"    As he listened to what Monsieur Darzac had to say, Rouletabille turned  pale.    \"Has Frederic Larsan found out the truth, which I can only guess at?\" he  murmured. \"He is very clever--very clever--and I admire him. But what  we have to do to-day is something more than the work of a policeman,  something quite different from the teachings of experience. We have to  take hold of our reason by the right end.\"    The reporter rushed into the open air, agitated by the thought that  the great and famous Fred might anticipate him in the solution of the  problem of The Yellow Room.    I managed to reach him on the threshold of the pavilion. \"Calm yourself,  my dear fellow,\" I said. \"Aren't you satisfied?\"    \"Yes,\" he confessed to me, with a deep sigh. \"I am quite satisfied. I  have discovered many things.\"    \"Moral or material?\"    \"Several moral,--one material. This, for example.\"    And rapidly he drew from his waistcoat pocket a piece of paper in which  he had placed a light-coloured hair from a woman's head.          CHAPTER VIII. The Examining Magistrate Questions Mademoiselle Stangerson      Two minutes later, as Rouletabille was bending over the footprints  discovered in the park, under the window of the vestibule, a man,  evidently a servant at the chateau, came towards us rapidly and called  out to Monsieur Darzac then coming out of the pavilion:    \"Monsieur Robert, the magistrate, you know, is questioning  Mademoiselle.\"    Monsieur Darzac uttered a muttered excuse to us and set off running  towards the chateau, the man running after him.    \"If the corpse can speak,\" I said, \"it would be interesting to be  there.\"    \"We must know,\" said my friend. \"Let's go to the chateau.\" And he drew  me with him. But, at the chateau, a gendarme placed in the vestibule  denied us admission up the staircase of the first floor. We were obliged  to wait down stairs.    This is what passed in the chamber of the victim while we were waiting  below.    The family doctor, finding that Mademoiselle Stangerson was much  better, but fearing a relapse which would no longer permit of her being  questioned, had thought it his duty to inform the examining magistrate  of this, who decided to proceed immediately with a brief examination.  At this examination, the Registrar, Monsieur Stangerson, and the  doctor were present. Later, I obtained the text of the report of the  examination, and I give it here, in all its legal dryness:    \"Question. Are you able, mademoiselle, without too much fatiguing  yourself, to give some necessary details of the frightful attack of  which you have been the victim?    \"Answer. I feel much better, monsieur, and I will tell you all I know.  When I entered my chamber I did not notice anything unusual there.    \"Q. Excuse me, mademoiselle,--if you will allow me, I will ask you some  questions and you will answer them. That will fatigue you less than  making a long recital.    \"A. Do so, monsieur.    \"Q. What did you do on that day?--I want you to be as minute and precise  as possible. I wish to know all you did that day, if it is not asking  too much of you.    \"A. I rose late, at ten o'clock, for my father and I had returned home  late on the night previously, having been to dinner at the reception  given by the President of the Republic, in honour of the Academy of  Science of Philadelphia. When I left my chamber, at half-past ten, my  father was already at work in the laboratory. We worked together  till midday. We then took half-an-hour's walk in the park, as we were  accustomed to do, before breakfasting at the chateau. After breakfast,  we took another walk for half an hour, and then returned to the  laboratory. There we found my chambermaid, who had come to set my room  in order. I went into The Yellow Room to give her some slight orders and  she directly afterwards left the pavilion, and I resumed my work with  my father. At five o'clock, we again went for a walk in the park and  afterward had tea.    \"Q. Before leaving the pavilion at five o'clock, did you go into your  chamber?    \"A. No, monsieur, my father went into it, at my request to bring me my  hat.    \"Q. And he found nothing suspicious there?    \"A. Evidently no, monsieur.    \"Q. It is, then, almost certain that the murderer was not yet concealed  under the bed. When you went out, was the door of the room locked?    \"A. No, there was no reason for locking it.    \"Q. You were absent from the pavilion some length of time, Monsieur  Stangerson and you?    \"A. About an hour.    \"Q. It was during that hour, no doubt, that the murderer got into the  pavilion. But how? Nobody knows. Footmarks have been found in the park,  leading away from the window of the vestibule, but none has been found  going towards it. Did you notice whether the vestibule window was open  when you went out?    \"A. I don't remember.    \"Monsieur Stangerson. It was closed.    \"Q. And when you returned?    \"Mademoiselle Stangerson. I did not notice.    \"M. Stangerson. It was still closed. I remember remarking aloud: 'Daddy  Jacques must surely have opened it while we were away.'    \"Q. Strange!--Do you recollect, Monsieur Stangerson, if during your  absence, and before going out, he had opened it? You returned to the  laboratory at six o'clock and resumed work?    \"Mademoiselle Stangerson. Yes, monsieur.    \"Q. And you did not leave the laboratory from that hour up to the moment  when you entered your chamber?    \"M. Stangerson. Neither my daughter nor I, monsieur. We were engaged on  work that was pressing, and we lost not a moment,--neglecting everything  else on that account.    \"Q. Did you dine in the laboratory?    \"A. For that reason.    \"Q. Are you accustomed to dine in the laboratory?    \"A. We rarely dine there.    \"Q. Could the murderer have known that you would dine there that  evening?    \"M. Stangerson. Good Heavens!--I think not. It was only when we returned  to the pavilion at six o'clock, that we decided, my daughter and I,  to dine there. At that moment I was spoken to by my gamekeeper, who  detained me a moment, to ask me to accompany him on an urgent tour of  inspection in a part of the woods which I had decided to thin. I put  this off until the next day, and begged him, as he was going by the  chateau, to tell the steward that we should dine in "]]]
