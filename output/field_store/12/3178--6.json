But if the choicest work of Divinity is  imperfect, by what are we to judge of the Divine perfections? Can a work  with which the author himself is so little satisfied, cause us to admire  his skill? Physical man is subject to a thousand infirmities, to  countless evils, to death; the moral man is full of defects; and yet  they exhaust themselves by telling us that he is the most beautiful work  of the most perfect of beings.          LXIX.--THE PERFECTION OF GOD DOES NOT SHOW TO ANY MORE ADVANTAGE IN THE  PRETENDED CREATION OF ANGELS AND PURE SPIRITS.    It appears that God, in creating more perfect beings than men, did not  succeed any better, or give stronger proofs of His perfection. Do we not  see in many religions that angels and pure spirits revolted against  their Master, and even attempted to expel Him from His throne? God  intended the happiness of angels and of men, and He has never succeeded  in rendering happy either angels or men; pride, malice, sins, the  imperfections of His creatures, have always been opposed to the wishes  of the perfect Creator.          LXX.--THEOLOGY PREACHES THE OMNIPOTENCE OF ITS GOD, AND CONTINUALLY SHOWS  HIM IMPOTENT.    All religion is visibly founded upon the principle that \"God proposes  and man disposes.\" All the theologies of the world show us an unequal  combat between Divinity on the one side, and His creatures on the other.  God never relies on His honor; in spite of His almighty power, He could  not succeed in making the works of His hands as He would like them to  be. To complete the absurdity, there is a religion which pretends that  God Himself died to redeem the human race; and, in spite of His death,  men are not in the least as this God would desire them to be!          LXXI.--ACCORDING TO ALL THE RELIGIOUS SYSTEMS OF THE EARTH, GOD WOULD BE  THE MOST CAPRICIOUS AND THE MOST INSENSATE OF BEINGS.    Nothing could be more extravagant than the role which in every country  theology makes Divinity play. If the thing was real, we would be obliged  to see in it the most capricious and the most insane of beings; one  would be obliged to believe that God made the world to be the theater of  dishonoring wars with His creatures; that He created angels, men,  demons, wicked spirits, but as adversaries, against whom He could  exercise His power. He gives them liberty to offend Him, makes them  wicked enough to upset His projects, obstinate enough to never give up:  all for the pleasure of getting angry, and being appeased, of  reconciling Himself, and of repairing the confusion they have made. Had  Divinity formed at once His creatures such as they ought to be in order  to please Him, what trouble He might have spared Himself! or, at least,  how much embarrassment He might have saved to His theologians! According  to all the religious systems of the earth, God seems to be occupied but  in doing Himself injury; He does it as those charlatans do who wound  themselves, in order to have occasion to show the public the value of  their ointments. We do not see, however, that so far Divinity has been  able to radically cure itself of the evil which is caused by men.          LXXII.--IT IS ABSURD TO SAY THAT EVIL DOES NOT COME FROM GOD.    God is the author of all; still we are assured that evil does not come  from God. Whence, then, does it come? From men? But who has made men? It  is God: then that evil comes from God. If He had not made men as they  are, moral evil or sin would not exist in the world. We must blame God,  then, that man is so perverse. If man has the power to do wrong or to  offend God, we must conclude that God wishes to be offended; that God,  who has created man, resolved that evil should be done by him: without  this, man would be an effect contrary to the cause from which he derives  his being.          LXXIII.--THE FORESIGHT ATTRIBUTED TO GOD, WOULD GIVE TO GUILTY MEN WHOM  HE PUNISHES, THE RIGHT TO COMPLAIN OF HIS CRUELTY.    The faculty of foresight, or the ability to know in advance all which is  to happen in the world, is attributed to God. But this foresight can  scarcely belong to His glory, nor spare Him the reproaches which men  could legitimately heap upon Him. If God had the foresight of the  future, did He not foresee the fall of His creatures whom He had  destined to happiness? If He resolved in His decrees to allow this fall,  there is no doubt that He desired it to take place: otherwise it would  not have happened. If the Divine foresight of the sin of His creatures  had been necessary or forced, it might be supposed that God was  compelled by His justice to punish the guilty; but God, enjoying the  faculty of foresight and the power to predestinate everything, would it  not depend upon Himself not to impose upon men these cruel laws? Or, at  least, could He not have dispensed with creating beings whom He might be  compelled to punish and to render unhappy by a subsequent decree? What  does it matter whether God destined men to happiness or to misery by a  previous decree, the effect of His foresight, or by a subsequent decree,  the effect of His justice. Does the arrangement of these decrees change  the fate of the miserable? Would they not have the right to complain of  a God who, having the power of leaving them in oblivion, brought them  forth, although He foresaw very well that His justice would force Him  sooner or later to punish them?          LXXIV.--ABSURDITY OF THE THEOLOGICAL FABLES UPON ORIGINAL SIN AND UPON  SATAN.    Man, say you, issuing from the hands of God, was pure, innocent, and  good; but his nature became corrupted in consequence of sin. If man  could sin, when just leaving the hands of God, his nature was then not  perfect! Why did God permit him to sin, and his nature to become  corrupt? Why did God allow him to be seduced, knowing well that he would  be too weak to resist the tempter? Why did God create a Satan, a  malicious spirit, a tempter? Why did not God, who was so desirous of  doing good to mankind, why did He not annihilate, once for all, so many  evil genii whose nature rendered them enemies of our happiness? Or  rather, why did God create evil spirits, whose victories and terrible  influences upon the human race He must have foreseen? Finally, by what  fatality, in all the religions of the world, has the evil principle such  a marked advantage over the good principle or over Divinity?          LXXV.--THE DEVIL, LIKE RELIGION, WAS INVENTED TO ENRICH THE PRIESTS.    We are told a story of the simple-heartedness of an Italian monk, which  does him honor. This good man preaching one day felt obliged to announce  to his auditory that, thanks to Heaven, he had at last discovered a sure  means of rendering all men happy. \"The devil,\" said he, \"tempts men but  to have them as comrades of his misery in hell. Let us address  ourselves, then, to the Pope, who possesses the keys of paradise and of  hell; let us ask him to beseech God, at the head of the whole Church, to  reconcile Himself with the devil; to take him back into His favor; to  re-establish him in His first rank. This can not fail to put an end to  his sinister projects against mankind.\" The good monk did not see,  perhaps, that the devil is at least fully as useful as God to the  ministers of religion. These reap too many benefits from their  differences to lend themselves willingly to a reconciliation between the  two enemies ties, upon whose contests their existence and their revenues  depend. If men would cease to be tempted and to sin, the ministry of  priests would become useless to them. Manicheism is evidently the  support of all religions; but unfortunately the devil, being invented to  remove all suspicion of malice from Divinity, proves to us at every  moment the powerlessness or the awkwardness of his celestial Adversary.          LXXVI.--IF GOD COULD NOT RENDER HUMAN NATURE SINLESS, HE HAS NO RIGHT TO  PUNISH MAN.    Man's nature, it is said, must necessarily become corrupt. God could not  endow him with sinlessness, which is an inalienable portion of Divine  perfection. But if God could not render him sinless, why did He take the  trouble of creating man, whose nature was to become corrupt, and which,  consequently, had to offend God? On the other side, if God Himself was  not able to render human nature sinless, what right had He to punish men  for not being sinless? It is but by the right of might. But the right of  the strongest is violence; and violence is not suited to the most Just  of Beings. God would be supremely unjust if He punished men for not  having a portion of the Divine perfections, or for not being able to be  Gods like Himself.    Could not God have at least endowed men with that sort of perfection of  which their nature is susceptible? If some men are good or render  themselves agreeable to their God, why did not this God bestow the same  favor or give the same dispositions to all beings of our kind? Why does  the number of wicked exceed so greatly the number of good people? Why,  for every friend, does God find ten thousand enemies in a world which  depended upon Him alone to people with honest men? If it is true that  God intends to form in heaven a court of saints, of chosen ones, or of  men who have lived in this world according to His views, would He not  have had a court more numerous, more brilliant, and more honorable to  Him, if it were composed of all the men to whom, in creating them, He  could have granted the degree of goodness necessary to obtain eternal  happiness? Finally, were it not easier not to take man from nothingness  than to create him full of defects, rebellious to his Creator,  perpetually exposed to lose himself by a fatal abuse of his liberty?  Instead of creating men, a perfect God ought to have created only docile  and submissive angels.

It will be a  more difficult job to free Muata and get away ourselves.\"    Venning described how he had seen the jackal approach the chief, and  as he and Mr. Hume went into the village, leaving Compton in the  boat, they cast an anxious glance at the square already agleam with  fires in the growing dusk. Muata was still at the post, his head  drooping and his body relaxed.    \"That's bad,\" muttered the hunter; \"he looks quite exhausted.\"    \"Perhaps he's shamming.\"    \"Let us hope so. In any case we may have to wait until past  midnight, as I am afraid our hosts will not let me off. It would be  better if we could get away early.\"    Fortune favoured them, for as the Zanzibar boy approached  with a  message from the officers, there arose the sound of rifle-shots from  the forest beyond. The people in the square shouted a reply, and  presently a party of men, dressed in long white robes, appeared.  They halted in the square, and the leader came on alone. He stooped  to stare into the face of Muata as he passed,  then approached.    \"Welcome, Hassan! My people are feasting; thanks to the skill of my  friend here;\" and the Belgian who had come forward indicated Mr.  Hume.    The Arab peered into Mr. Hume's face and salaamed, with an evil  smile on his wide, thin-lipped mouth.    \"I am thankful,\" he said in the native dialect, \"for your kindness  in bringing back my slave\"--pointing towards Muata.    \"It was a small thing,\" said Mr. Hume.    \"But it pleases me; and when you reach my zareba, all that is mine  to command is yours.\"    He looked at Venning, and the boy noticed that the pupils of the  eyes had a white speck, which gave to them a sinister appearance.    \"Good,\" said the Belgian. \"We will have a night. Pardon me for a  short time while I discuss a little matter touching the reward for  Muata with my friend Hassan.\"    The two went off, the Arab casting a ferocious look back at the  chief.    Venning tugged at the hunter's arm.  \"Look,\" he whispered.    Muata was slipping down the post, as if his legs had utterly given  way. The party of new-comers were stacking  their arms at the  \"indaba\" house at the end of the square, and the village people were  talking, laughing, and eating. Muata reached the ground, but not in  a state of collapse, for the next instant the two watchers saw him  crawl to the shadow of a hut, where he remained as if stretching his  limbs.    \"Come,\" said Mr. Hume, in a fierce whisper, recovering from  his  surprise; and the two went swiftly to the river.    Compton had already cast off and was holding by the boat-hook.    \"Bring her in.\"    The Okapi ran her stern into the bank, and the two stepped aboard,  Mr. Hume going forward to the wheel, with his rifle in his hand.    \"Shove her off; run as silently as you can out of hearing, and then  work the levers.\"    Compton looked inquiringly at Venning as he picked up the oars, and  then at the village, from which came a loud babble.    \"Is he free already?\"    Venning nodded.    \"Good;\" and then they bent themselves to the oars with every nerve  on the quiver, and their eyes on the shore.    \"Stop! Back-water!\"    Obediently they stopped the way of the boat and backed her,  wondering what had gone wrong. A turn of the wheel sent them in  among the canoes. There was a flash of steel, a plunge of the strong  arm down into the boats, accompanied by a ripping noise. Then the  hunter waded ashore, and with his great hunting-knife ripped up the  boats lying on the bank. Quickly he was back at his place.    \"Now, off!\"    Again they pushed off, the boys with their excitement increasing  after this interlude, which showed them the imminence of danger. A  few long strokes took the Okapi well out; then she was put about  with her nose up-stream.    \"The levers now, my lads!\"    They perched themselves on the saddle-seats, and at the clanking of  the levers the beautiful craft slipped swiftly up-stream.    Then out of the dark there rose the mournful howl of a jackal,  almost instantly replied to by a similar call at a distance.    \"The chief calling to his jackal,\" said Mr. Hume. \"Thank Heaven, he  has got away. Now I will let him know we are also off;\" and he, too,  gave the jackal  hunting-cry.    Back out of the darkness came the chief's exultant war-cry, and on  it a furious shout from the village, followed by the discharge of a  rifle, and the rolling alarm of a war-drum. Then shone out the glare  of torches at the river bank, and a savage yell announced that the  men had discovered the injury done to the canoes.    One of the purchases made in London had been a lamp with very fine  reflectors. This Mr. Hume fixed on a movable bracket within reach of  his arm as he sat at the wheel, and when the lights at the village  faded astern, he lit the lamp, in order to thread a passage by its  light through the dark waters. As the noise of shouting, the  drumming, and the report of fire-arms died down, other sounds  reached their strained hearing--the booming of the Congo bittern,  the harsh roar of a bull crocodile, and the cries of water-birds.    Then Venning laughed--a little short nervous laugh. \"We have done  it,\" he said.    \"We have, indeed,\" said Compton.    \"But if we can only pick up Muata and his jackal, we should be all  right. Just a nice party.\"    The rudder-chains clanked; the boat set up a heavy wash as she  turned from her course.  There was a splashing, and something  snorted almost in Venning's face.    \"Nearly ran into a hippo!\" sang out Mr. Hume. \"We must keep out into  mid-river; it's too risky inshore. Tell me when you are tired.\"    \"We're quite fresh yet,\" replied Compton. \"It is easier than  sculling.\"    \"Moves like clockwork,\" said Venning, gaily. \"I could keep on all  night.\"    \"We'll have to keep on all night and all to-morrow,\" muttered Mr.  Hume; and in a few minutes he relieved Compton, making him put on a  heavy coat before taking the wheel. \"It's the chill that is  dangerous. In an hour you will relieve Venning.\"    Turn and turn the boys relieved each other at intervals, but Mr.  Hume swang to his lever till the dawn, when the mast was stepped,  the sail spread, and the spirit-lamp got out for the making of  coffee. After breakfast the awning was spread, the mosquito curtains  stretched round, and the boys were ordered to sleep. They demurred  at first, but the hunter rather sharply insisted, and no sooner were  they stretched on the rugs than they were asleep. The yoke had been  slipped over the rudder, and, using the lines, Mr. Hume sailed the  Okapi single-handed, taking her across the lake-like width till he  was under the wooded hills of the south bank, where he beat about  for an hour or so in the hope that Muata might have covered the  distance at the native's trotting-pace. It was, he told himself, not  likely, however, that the chief could have done so, after being for  hours bound to a post; and after a time he beat out again into mid-  stream afar off, so that no village natives should spy upon the  craft. He did not share in the triumph of his young companions.  Too  well he knew that they had risked everything by their secret  departure; but he could not see that any other course was open to  them, as if they had remained it would have been difficult for them  to prove that they were not concerned in Muata's escape.  He knew,  too, that if he had abandoned the chief, as the price of security,  the boys would have lost all faith in him.    What, however, he did feel was, that the responsibility rested on  him. If a mistake had been made it was his mistake, and if the boys  suffered from it the blame would be his.    So he beat out into mid-stream, where the sail of the low-lying  craft would be but a speck when viewed from the shore, and with a  beam wind laid her on a course which she kept almost dead straight,  with a tack at long intervals only.  In the shade of the awning the  boys slept the dreamless sleep of the healthy, and he let them sleep  on till the sun stood almost above the mast, sending down a blaze  that scorched. Then he beached the Okapi on the shelving shore of a  sand-spit, without vegetation of any kind to give shelter to  mosquitoes, and awoke them.    \"All hands to bathe!\" he shouted; and the three of them were soon  in, and no sooner in than out; for, according to the hunter, the  virtue of a bathe was not in long immersion, but in friction. \"With  their heads well protected, but their bodies bare to the sun, the  friction was obtained by rubbing handfuls of the dry, clean sand  over limbs and body till the skin glowed.    \"Now I will snatch a few winks while you work the levers, until the  wind springs up again.\"    Mr. Hume stretched himself forward under the awning after unstopping  the mast; and the two friends, after tossing a bucket of water over  the canvas awning, took their seats, clad in pyjamas and body-belts  only, and bent gaily to the levers which \"click-clanked\" merrily.  Their feet were naked, for Mr. Hume had taught the lesson that the  feet should be cool and the head protected; their arms were bare to  the elbow, of a fine mahogany hue; their movements were brisk; but  the best evidence of health was in the clearness of their eyes.  Fever shows its touch in the \"gooseberry\" eye, dull and clouded; in  the moist pallor of the skin, and in a general listlessness. Even if  they are free from fever, white men in Central Africa often grow  listless because of insufficient nutriment. Their flesh-diet is  chiefly the white meat of birds, and their blood-cells are really  starved by the small amount of nitrogenous matter. A deficient diet"]]]
