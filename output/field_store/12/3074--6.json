He  says (_First Principles of Piano Playing_): \"The two chief rules of  technic, as regards the key, are, therefore: Always feel how much the  key resists you: feel how much the key _wants_ for every note. Second,  Always listen for the moment each sound begins, so that you may learn to  direct your effort to the sound only, and not to the key bed. You must  never hit a key down, nor hit _at_ it. The finger-tip may fall on the  key, and in gently reaching the key you may follow up such fall by  acting against the key. This action against the key must be for the sole  purpose of making it move--in one of the many ways which each give us  quite a different kind of sound. And you must always direct such action  to the point in key descent where the sound begins.\"    I quote also this little summary from the same work:    \"(a) It is only by making the hammer-end of the key move that you can  make a sound. (b) The swifter the movement the louder the sound. (c)  The more gradual this swiftness is obtained the more beautiful the  quality of sound. (d) For brilliant tone you may hit the string by means  of the key, but do not, by mistake, hit the key instead. (e) You must  'aim' the key to the _beginning_ of each sound, because the hammer falls  off the string as you hear that beginning, and it is too late then to  influence the sound except its continuance. (f) It is wrong to squeeze  the key beds, because it prevents tone, impairs musical result, impedes  agility, and is, besides, fatiguing. (g) You must feel the 'giving way  point' of the key, so that you may be able to tell how much force is  required for each note. Never, therefore, really hit the keys.\"    Mr. Matthay as minutely gives directions as to the muscular problems of  touch and technique. For instance, he explains how all varieties of  tone, good and bad, are caused, all inflections of Duration, and the  laws which govern the attainment of Agility and ease of Technique; and  also explains the nature of incorrect muscular actions which prevent the  attainment of all these things. He shows where the released arm weight  should be applied, and again, where it should be eliminated; makes  clear the two opposite forms of technic implied by \"flat\" and \"bent\"  finger actions, and he goes exhaustively into the little-understood  question of forearm rotary exertions, the correct application of which  he proves to be necessary for every note we play.    In speaking of methods in piano teaching, Mr. Matthay said to me:    \"I can say I have no method _of playing_, and moreover I have not much  faith in people who have. My teachings merely show how all playing, good  or bad, is accomplished. There are certain principles, however, which  every player should know, but which, I am sorry to say, are as yet  scarcely apprehended even by the best teachers. The great pianists have  experimented till they have hit upon effects which they can repeat if  all conditions are favorable, and they are in the mood. As a rule they  do not know the laws underlying these effects. You may ask the greatest  pianists, for example, how to play octaves. 'Oh, I play them  thus'--illustrating. Just what to do to attain this result they cannot  explain. In my own case I have done much experimenting, but always with  the view to discovering _how_ things are done--the facts and laws  governing actual tone production and interpretation. I made a study of  Rubinstein's playing, for I found he played a great deal better than I  did. So I discovered many things in listening to him, which he perhaps  could not have explained to me. These facts are incontrovertible and I  have brought many of my colleagues to see the truth of them. More than  this, I have brought many even of my older colleagues who had a  life-time of wrong mental habits to impede them, to realize the truth of  my teachings.    \"The work of a teacher should speak for itself. For my own part I never  advertise, for I can point to hundreds of pupils--this is no  exaggeration in the least!--who are constantly before the public, as  concert pianists and successful teachers.    \"If there is one thing that rouses me deeply, it is the incompetence of  so many teachers of piano. They say to the pupil: 'You play badly, you  must play better'; but they do not tell the pupil _how_ to play better.  They give doses of etudes, sonatas and pieces, yet never get at the  heart of the matter at all. It is even worse than the fake singing  teachers; I feel like saying it is damnable!\"    It was my privilege to be present at some of Mr. Matthay's private  lessons, given at the Royal Academy. Several young men were to try for  one of the medals, and were playing the same piece, one of the  Strauss-Tausig Valse Caprices.    Matthay listens to a complete performance of the work in hand, then  turns back to the beginning and goes over it again for corrections and  suggestions. He enters into it with absolute devotion, directing with  movements of head and hands as a conductor might direct an orchestra;  sometimes he dashes down a chord in the treble to urge more force; at  other times lays a restraining hand on the player's arm, where the tone  should be softer. His blue pencil is often busy adding phrasing marks.  In the pauses he talks over with the pupil the character of the piece,  and the effects he thinks should be made. In short his lessons are most  helpful and illuminating.    I also had the opportunity to attend a pupils' \"Practise Concert,\" and  here the results attained were little short of marvelous. Small  children, both boys and girls, played difficult pieces, like the Grieg  Variations for two pianos, the Weber _Invitation to the Dance_, and  works by Chopin and Liszt, with accuracy and fluency. Almost every  selection was played from memory. The tone was always musical and often  of much power, and the pupils seemed thoroughly to understand what they  were doing and the meaning of the music. They certainly exemplified the  professor's maxim:    \"Never touch the piano without trying to make music.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Not long afterward I received a copy of the new book, which had just  come from the press. Its comprehensive title is _Musical Interpretation,  its Laws and Principles, and their Application in Teaching and  Performing_. The material was first presented in the form of lectures;  on repeated requests it has been issued in book form. The author at the  outset claims no attempt to treat such a complex problem exhaustively;  he has, however, selected the following seven points for elucidation:    1. The difference between Practise and Strumming.  2. The difference between Teaching and Cramming.  3. How one's mind can be brought to bear on one's work.  4. Correct ideas of Time and Shape.  5. Elements of Rubato and its application.  6. Elements of Duration and Pedaling and their application.  7. Some details as to the application of the Element of Tone-variety.    Such themes must cause the thoughtful reader to pause and think. They  are treated with illuminating originality. The great aim of the teacher  must ever be to awaken thought along correct lines; the pupil must be  assisted to concentrate his thought on what he is doing: to constantly  think and listen. Teaching does not consist merely in pointing out  faults; the teacher must make clear the _cause_ of each fault and the  way to correct it. That section of the book devoted to the Element of  Rubato, is illustrated with many examples from well-known compositions,  by which the principle is explained. He shows how frequently this  principle is misunderstood by the inexperienced, who seem to think that  rubato means breaking the time; whereas true rubato is the _bending_ of  the time, but not _breaking_ it. If we give extra time to certain notes,  we must take some time from other notes, in order to even things up.    The subject of Pedaling is aptly explained by means of numerous  illustrations. The author deplores the misuse of the damper pedal,  which can be made to ruin all the care and effort bestowed on phrasing  and tonal effects by the fingers. The fault can, in most cases, be  traced to inattention to the sounds coming from the piano.    There are quotable paragraphs on every page, which in their sincerity  and earnestness, their originality of expression, stamp themselves on  the reader's imagination. Every teacher who is serious in his work and  has the best interests of his pupils at heart, should read and ponder  these pages.          XIII    HAROLD BAUER    THE QUESTION OF PIANO TONE      Buried deep in the heart of old Paris, in one of the narrow, busy  thoroughfares of the city, stands the ancient house in which the master  pianist, Harold Bauer, has made a home.    One who is unfamiliar with Paris would never imagine that behind those  rows of uninviting buildings lining the noisy, commercial street, there  lived people of refined and artistic tastes. All the entrances to the  buildings look very much alike--they seem to be mere slits in the walls.  I stopped before one of the openings, entered and crossed a paved  courtyard, climbed a winding stone stairway, rang at a plain wooden  doorway, and was ushered into the artist's abode. Once within, I hardly  dared to speak, lest what I saw might vanish away, as with the wave of a  fairy's wand. Was I not a moment before down in that dusty, squalid  street, and here I am now in a beautiful room whose appointments are  all of quiet elegance--costly but in exquisite taste, and where absolute  peace and quiet reign. The wide windows open upon a lovely green garden,  which adds the final touch of restful repose to the whole picture.    Mr. Bauer was giving a lesson in the music salon beyond, from which  issued, now and again, echoes of well-beloved themes from a Chopin  sonata. When the lesson was over he came out to me.    \"Y"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1561"],[0,"Pagan and Christian Creeds: Their Origin and Meaning (#11)"],[1,"a member of the Emu tribe, and disguised as an actual  emu, having been ceremonially slaughtered as a firstfruits and promise  of the expected and prayed-for emu-crop; just as the same certainly  HAS happened in the case of men wearing beast-masks of Bulls or Rams  or Bears being sacrificed in propitiation of Bull-gods, Ram-gods or  Bear-gods or simply in pursuance of some kind of magic to favor the  multiplication of these food-animals.    \"In the light of totemistic ways of thinking we see plainly enough the  relation of man to food-animals. You need or at least desire flesh food,  yet you shrink from slaughtering 'your brother the ox'; you desire his  mana, yet you respect his tabu, for in you and him alike runs the common  life-blood. On your own individual responsibility you would never kill  him; but for the common weal, on great occasions, and in a fashion  conducted with scrupulous care, it is expedient that he die for his  people, and that they feast upon his flesh.\" (1)     (1) Themis, p. 140.      In her little book Ancient Art and Ritual (1) Jane Harrison describes  the dedication of a holy Bull, as conducted in Greece at Elis, and at  Magnesia and other cities. \"There at the annual fair year by year the  stewards of the city bought a Bull 'the finest that could be got,' and  at the new moon of the month at the beginning of seed-time (? April)   Bull was led in procession at the head of which went the chief priest  and priestess of the city. With them went a herald and sacrificer,  and two bands of youths and maidens. So holy was the Bull that nothing  unlucky might come near him. The herald pronounced aloud a prayer for  'the safety of the city and the land, and the citizens, and the women  and children, for peace and wealth, and for the bringing forth of grain  and all other fruits, and of cattle.' All this longing for fertility,  for food and children, focuses round the holy Bull, whose holiness is  his strength and fruitfulness.\" The Bull is sacrificed. The flesh is  divided in solemn feast among those who take part in the procession.  \"The holy flesh is not offered to a god, it is eaten--to every man his  portion--by each and every citizen, that he may get his share of the  strength of the Bull, of the luck of the State.\" But at Athens the  Bouphonia, as it was called, was followed by a curious ceremony. \"The  hide was stuffed with straw and sewed up, and next the stuffed animal  was set on its feet and yoked to a plough as though it were ploughing.  The Death is followed by a Resurrection. Now this is all important. We  are accustomed to think of sacrifice as the death, the giving up, the  renouncing of something. But SACRIFICE does not mean 'death' at all. It  means MAKING HOLY, sanctifying; and holiness was to primitive man just  special strength and life. What they wanted from the Bull was just that  special life and strength which all the year long they had put into him,  and nourished and fostered. That life was in his blood. They could not  eat that flesh nor drink that blood unless they killed him. So he must  die. But it was not to give him up to the gods that they killed him,  not to 'sacrifice' him in our sense, but to have him, keep him, eat him,  live BY him and through him, by his grace.\"     (1) Home University Library, p. 87.      We have already had to deal with instances of the ceremonial eating of  the sacred he-Lamb or Ram, immolated in the Spring season of the year,  and partaken of in a kind of communal feast--not without reference (at  any rate in later times) to a supposed Lamb-god. Among the Ainos in the  North of Japan, as also among the Gilyaks in Eastern Siberia, the Bear  is the great food-animal, and is worshipped as the supreme giver of  health and strength. There also a similar ritual of sacrifice occurs. A  perfect Bear is caught and caged. He is fed up and even pampered to the  day of his death. \"Fish, brandy and other delicacies are offered to him.  Some of the people prostrate themselves before him; his coming into  a house brings a blessing, and if he sniffs at the food that brings a  blessing too.\" Then he is led out and slain. A great feast takes place,  the flesh is divided, cupfuls of the blood are drunk by the men;  the tribe is united and strengthened, and the Bear-god blesses the  ceremony--the ideal Bear that has given its life for the people. (1)       (1) See Art and Ritual, pp. 92-98; The Golden Bough, ii, 375  seq.; Themis, pp. 140, 141; etc.      That the eating of the flesh of an animal or a man conveys to you some  of the qualities, the life-force, the mana, of that animal or man, is an  idea which one often meets with among primitive folk. Hence the common  tendency to eat enemy warriors slain in battle against your tribe. By  doing so you absorb some of their valor and strength. Even the enemy  scalps which an Apache Indian might hang from his belt were something  magical to add to the Apache's power. As Gilbert Murray says, (1) \"you  devoured the holy animal to get its mana, its swiftness, its strength,  its great endurance, just as the savage now will eat his enemy's brain  or heart or hands to get some particular quality residing there.\"  Even--as he explains on the earlier page--mere CONTACT was often  considered sufficient--\"we have holy pillars whose holiness consists  in the fact that they have been touched by the blood of a bull.\" And in  this connection we may note that nearly all the Christian Churches have  a great belief in the virtue imparted by the mere 'laying on of hands.'     (1) Four Stages of Greek Religion, p. 36.      In quite a different connection--we read (1) that among the Spartans a  warrior-boy would often beg for the love of the elder warrior whom he  admired (i. e. the contact with his body) in order to obtain in that  way a portion of the latter's courage and prowess. That through the  mediation of the lips one's spirit may be united to the spirit of  another person is an idea not unfamiliar to the modern mind; while the  exchange of blood, clothes, locks of hair, etc., by lovers is a custom  known all over the world. (2)     (1) Aelian VII, iii, 12: [gr autoi goun (oi paides) deontai twn  erastwn] [gr eispnein autois]. See also E. Bethe on \"Die Dorische  Knabenliebe\" in the Rheinisches Museum, vol. 26, iii, 461.     (2) See Crawley's Mystic Rose, pp. 238, 242.      To suppose that by eating another you absorb his or her soul is somewhat  naive certainly. Perhaps it IS more native, more primitive. Yet there  may be SOME truth even in that idea. Certainly the food that one eats  has a psychological effect, and the flesh-eaters among the human race  have a different temperament as a rule from the fruit and vegetable  eaters, while among the animals (though other causes may come in  here) the Carnivora are decidedly more cruel and less gentle than the  Herbivora.    To return to the rites of Dionysus, Gilbert Murray, speaking of  Orphism--a great wave of religious reform which swept over Greece and  South Italy in the sixth century B.C.--says: (1) \"A curious relic of  primitive superstition and cruelty remained firmly imbedded in Orphism,  a doctrine irrational and unintelligible, and for that very reason  wrapped in the deepest and most sacred mystery: a belief in the  SACRIFICE OF DIONYSUS HIMSELF, AND THE PURIFICATION OF MAN BY HIS  BLOOD. It seems possible that the savage Thracians, in the fury of their  worship on the mountains, when they were possessed by the god and became  'wild beasts,' actually tore with their teeth and hands any hares,  goats, fawns or the like that they came across.... The Orphic  congregations of later times, in their most holy gatherings, solemnly  partook of the blood of a bull, which was by a mystery the blood of  Dionysus-Zagreus himself, the Bull of God, slain in sacrifice for the  purification of man.\" (2)     (1) See Notes to his translation of the Bacch[ae] of Euripides.     (2) For a description of this orgy see Theocritus, Idyll xxvi;  also for explanations of it, Lang's Myth, Ritual and Religion, vol. ii,  pp, 241-260, on Dionysus. The Encyclop[ae]dia Brit., article \"Orpheus,\"  says:--\"Orpheus, in the manner of his death, was considered to personate  the god Dionysus, and was thus representative of the god torn to pieces  every year--a ceremony enacted by the Bacchae in the earliest times with  a human victim, and afterwards with a bull, to represent the bull-formed  god. A distinct feature of this ritual was [gr wmofagia] (eating the  flesh of the victim raw), whereby the communicants imagined that they  consumed and assimilated the god represented by the victim, and thus  became filled with the divine ecstasy.\" Compare also the Hindu doctrine  of Praj[pati, the dismembered Lord of Creation.      Such instances of early communal feasts, which fulfilled the double part  of confirming on the one hand the solidarity of the tribe, and on the  other of bringing the tribe, by the shedding of the blood of a divine  Victim into close relationship with the very source of its life,  are plentiful to find. \"The sacramental rite,\" says Professor  Robertson-Smith, (1) \"is also an atoning rite, which brings the  community again into harmony with its alienated god--atonement being  simply an act of communion designed to wipe out all memory of previous  estrangement.\" With this subject I shall deal more specially in chapter  vii below. Meanwhile as instances of early Eucharists we may mention the  following cases, remembering always that as the blood is regarded as the  Life, the drinking or partaking of, or sprinkling with, blood is always  an acknowledgment of the common life; and that the juice of the grape  being regarded as the blood of the Vine, wine in the later ceremonials  quite easily and naturally takes the place of the blood in the early  sacrifices.
