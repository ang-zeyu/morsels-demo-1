I am not aware  that any one is bidding you yield that right; very certainly I am not. I  leave that matter entirely to yourself. I also acknowledge your rights  and my obligations under the Constitution in regard to your slaves. I  confess I hate to see the poor creatures hunted down and caught and  carried back to their stripes and unrequited toil; but I bite my lips  and keep quiet. In 1841, you and I had together a tedious low-water trip  on a steamboat, from Louisville to St. Louis. You may remember, as I  well do, that from Louisville to the mouth of the Ohio, there were on  board ten or a dozen slaves shackled together with irons. That sight was  a continued torment to me, and I see something like it every time I  touch the Ohio or any other slave border. It is not fair for you to  assume that I have no interest in a thing which has, and continually  exercises, the power of making me miserable. You ought rather to  appreciate how much the great body of the Northern people do crucify  their feelings in order to maintain their loyalty to the Constitution  and the Union. I do oppose the extension of slavery, because my judgment  and feeling so prompt me, and I am under no obligations to the contrary.  If for this you and I must differ, differ we must. You say if you were  President, you would send an army and hang the leaders of the Missouri  outrages upon the Kansas elections; still, if Kansas fairly votes  herself a slave State she must be admitted, or the Union must be  dissolved. But how if she votes herself a slave State unfairly; that  is, by the very means for which you say you would hang men? Must she  still be admitted, or the Union dissolved? That will be the phase of the  question when it first becomes a practical one. In your assumption that  there may be a fair decision of the slavery question in Kansas, I  plainly see that you and I would differ about the Nebraska law. I look  upon that enactment, not as a law, but as a violence from the beginning.  It was conceived in violence, is maintained in violence, and is being  executed in violence. I say it was conceived in violence, because the  destruction of the Missouri Compromise, under the circumstances, was  nothing less than violence. It was passed in violence, because it could  not have passed at all but for the votes of many members in violence of  the known will of their constituents. It is maintained in violence,  because the elections since clearly demand its repeal, and the demand is  openly disregarded.    You say men ought to be hung for the way they are executing the law; I  say that the way it is being executed is quite as good as any of its  antecedents. It is being executed in the precise way which was intended  from the first, else why does no Nebraska man express astonishment or  condemnation? Poor Reeder is the only public man who has been silly  enough to believe that anything like fairness was ever intended, and he  has been bravely undeceived.    That Kansas will form a slave constitution, and with it ask to be  admitted into the Union, I take to be already a settled question, and so  settled by the very means you so pointedly condemn. By every principle  of law ever held by any court North or South, every negro taken to  Kansas _is_ free; yet in utter disregard of this--in the spirit of  violence merely--that beautiful Legislature gravely passes a law to hang  any man who shall venture to inform a negro of his legal rights. This is  the subject and real object of the law. If, like Haman, they should hang  upon the gallows of their own building, I shall not be among the  mourners for their fate. In my humble sphere, I shall advocate the  restoration of the Missouri Compromise so long as Kansas remains a  Territory; and when, by all these foul means, it seeks to come into the  Union as a slave State, I shall oppose it. I am very loath in any case  to withhold my assent to the enjoyment of property acquired or located  in good faith; but I do not admit that good faith in taking a negro to  Kansas to be held in slavery is a probability with any man. Any man who  has sense enough to be the controller of his own property has too much  sense to misunderstand the outrageous character of the whole Nebraska  business. But I digress. In my opposition to the admission of Kansas, I  shall have some company, but we may be beaten. If we are, I shall not,  on that account, attempt to dissolve the Union. I think it probable,  however, we shall be beaten. Standing as a unit among yourselves, you  can, directly and indirectly, bribe enough of our men to carry the day,  as you could on the open proposition to establish a monarchy. Get hold  of some man in the North whose position and ability are such that he can  make the support of your measure, whatever it may be, a Democratic-party  necessity, and the thing is done. Apropos of this, let me tell you an  anecdote. Douglas introduced the Nebraska Bill in January. In February  afterward, there was a called session of the Illinois Legislature. Of  the one hundred members composing the two branches of that body, about  seventy were Democrats. These latter held a caucus, in which the  Nebraska Bill was talked of, if not formally discussed. It was thereby  discovered that just three, and no more, were in favour of the measure.  In a day or two Douglas's orders came on to have resolutions passed  approving the bill; and they were passed by large majorities! The truth  of this is vouched for by a bolting Democratic member. The masses too,  Democratic as well as Whig, were even nearer unanimous against it; but  as soon as the party necessity of supporting it became apparent, the way  the Democrats began to see the wisdom and justice of it was perfectly  astonishing.    You say that if Kansas fairly votes herself a free State, as a Christian  you will rejoice at it. All decent slaveholders talk that way, and I do  not doubt their candour; but they never vote that way. Although in a  private letter or conversation you will express your preference that  Kansas should be free, you would vote for no man for Congress who would  say the same thing publicly. No such man could be elected from any  district in a slave State. You think Stringfellow and company ought to  be hung.... The slave-breeders and slave-traders are a small, odious,  and detested class among you; and yet in politics they dictate the  course of all of you, and are as completely your masters as you are the  master of your own negroes. You inquire where I now stand. That is a  disputed point. I think I am a Whig; but others say there are no Whigs,  and that I am an Abolitionist. When I was at Washington, I voted for the  Wilmot Proviso as good as forty times; and I never heard of any one  attempting to unwhig me for that. I now do no more than oppose the  extension of slavery. I am not a Know-nothing; that is certain. How  could I be? How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes be in  favour of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy  appears to me to be pretty rapid. As a nation, we began by declaring  that _all men are created equal_. We now practically read it, _all men  are created equal except negroes_. When the Know-nothings get control,  it will read, _all men are created equal except negroes_ and foreigners  and Catholics. When it comes to this, I shall prefer emigrating to some  country where they make no pretence of loving liberty--to Russia, for  instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy  of hypocrisy.... My kindest regards to Mrs. Speed. On the leading  subject of this letter I have more of her sympathy than I have of yours;  and yet let me say I am your friend for ever.         A. LINCOLN.          _Mr. Lincoln's Speech. May 19, 1856_      Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I was over at [cries of \"Platform!\" \"Take  the platform!\"]--I say, that while I was at Danville Court, some of our  friends of anti-Nebraska got together in Springfield and elected me as  one delegate to represent old Sangamon with them in this convention, and  I am here certainly as a sympathizer in this movement and by virtue of  that meeting and selection. But we can hardly be called delegates  strictly, inasmuch as, properly speaking, we represent nobody but  ourselves. I think it altogether fair to say that we have no  anti-Nebraska party in Sangamon, although there is a good deal of  anti-Nebraska feeling there; but I say for myself, and I think I may  speak also for my colleagues, that we who are here fully approve of the  platform and of all that has been done [A voice: \"Yes!\"]; and even if we  are not regularly delegates, it will be right for me to answer your call  to speak. I suppose we truly stand for the public sentiment of Sangamon  on the great question of the repeal, although we do not yet represent  many numbers who have taken a distinct position on the question.    We are in a trying time--it ranges above mere party--and this movement  to call a halt and turn our steps backward needs all the help and good  counsels it can get; for unless popular opinion makes itself very  strongly felt, and a change is made in our present course, _blood will  flow on account of Nebraska, and brother's hand will be raised against  brother_! [The last sentence was uttered in such an earnest, impressive,  if not, indeed, tragic, manner, as to make a cold chill creep over me.  Others gave a similar experience.]    I have listened with great interest to the earnest appeal made to  Illinois men by the gentleman from Lawrence [James S. Emery] who has  just addressed us so eloquently and forcibly. I was deeply moved by his  statement of the wrongs done to free-State men out there.

One of the richest and most interesting  examples of domestic architecture in England is St. Mary's Hall,  erected in the time of Henry VI. Its origin is connected with ancient  guilds of the city, and in it were stored their books and archives.  The grotesquely carved roof, minstrels' gallery, armoury, state-chair,  great painted window, and a fine specimen of fifteenth-century  tapestry are interesting features of this famous hall, which furnishes  a vivid idea of the manners and civic customs of the age when Coventry  was the favourite resort of kings and princes. It has several fine  churches, though the cathedral was levelled with the ground by that  arch-destroyer Henry VIII. Coventry remains one of the most  interesting towns in England.    One other walled town we will single out for especial notice in this  chapter--the quaint, picturesque, peaceful, placid town of Rye on the  Sussex coast. It was once wooed by the sea, which surrounded the rocky  island on which it stands, but the fickle sea has retired and left it  lonely on its hill with a long stretch of marshland between it and the  waves. This must have taken place about the fifteenth century. Our  illustration of a disused mooring-post (p. 24) is a symbol of the  departed greatness of the town as a naval station. The River Rother  connects it with the sea, and the few barges and humble craft and a  few small shipbuilding yards remind it of its palmy days when it was  a member of the Cinque Ports, a rich and prosperous town that sent  forth its ships to fight the naval battles of England and win honour  for Rye and St. George. During the French wars English vessels often  visited French ports and towns along the coast and burned and pillaged  them. The French sailors retaliated with equal zest, and many of our  southern towns have suffered from fire and sword during those  adventurous days.    [Illustration: Old Houses formerly standing in Spon Street Coventry]    Rye was strongly fortified by a wall with gates and towers and a  fosse, but the defences suffered grievously from the attacks of the  French, and the folk of Rye were obliged to send a moving petition to  King Richard II, praying him \"to have consideration of the poor town  of Rye, inasmuch as it had been several times taken, and is unable  further to repair the walls, wherefore the town is, on the sea-side,  open to enemies.\" I am afraid that the King did not at once grant  their petition, as two years later, in 1380, the French came again and  set fire to the town. With the departure of the sea and the  diminishing of the harbour, the population decreased and the  prosperity of Rye declined. Refugees from France have on two notable  occasions added to the number of its inhabitants. After the Massacre  of St. Bartholomew seven hundred scared and frightened Protestants  arrived at Rye and brought with them their industry, and later on,  after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, many Huguenots settled  here and made it almost a French town. We need not record all the  royal visits, the alarms of attack, the plagues, and other incidents  that have diversified the life of Rye. We will glance at the relics  that remain. The walls seem never to have recovered from the attack of  the French, but one gate is standing--the Landgate on the north-east  of the town, built in 1360, and consisting of a broad arch flanked by  two massive towers with chambers above for archers and defenders.  Formerly there were two other gates, but these have vanished save only  the sculptured arms of the Cinque Ports that once adorned the Strand  Gate. The Ypres tower is a memorial of the ancient strength of the  town, and was originally built by William de Ypres, Earl of Kent, in  the twelfth century, but has received later additions. It has a stern,  gaunt appearance, and until recent times was used as a jail. The  church possesses many points of unique interest. The builders began in  the twelfth century to build the tower and transepts, which are  Norman; then they proceeded with the nave, which is Transitional; and  when they reached the choir, which is very large and fine, the style  had merged into the Early English. Later windows were inserted in the  fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The church has suffered with the  town at the hands of the French invaders, who did much damage. The old  clock, with its huge swinging pendulum, is curious. The church has a  collection of old books, including some old Bibles, including a  Vinegar and a Breeches Bible, and some stone cannon-balls, mementoes  of the French invasion of 1448.    [Illustration: West Street, Rye]    Near the church is the Town Hall, which contains several relics of  olden days. The list of mayors extends from the time of Edward I, and  we notice the long continuance of the office in families. Thus the  Lambs held office from 1723 to 1832, and the Grebells from 1631 to  1741. A great tragedy happened in the churchyard. A man named Breedes  had a grudge against one of the Lambs, and intended to kill him. He  saw, as he thought, his victim walking along the dark path through the  shrubs in the churchyard, attacked and murdered him. But he had made a  mistake; his victim was Mr. Grebell. The murderer was hanged and  quartered. The Town Hall contains the ancient pillory, which was  described as a very handy affair, handcuffs, leg-irons, special  constables' staves, which were always much needed for the usual riots  on Gunpowder Plot Day, and the old primitive fire-engine dated 1745.  The town has some remarkable plate. There is the mayor's handbell  with the inscription:--          O MATER DEI        MEMENTO MEI.           1566.      PETRUS GHEINEUS         ME FECIT.    The maces of Queen Elizabeth with the date 1570 and bearing the  fleur-de-lis and the Tudor rose are interesting, and the two silver  maces presented by George III, bearing the arms of Rye and weighing  962 oz., are said to be the finest in Europe.    [Illustration: Monogram and Inscription in the Mermaid Inn, Rye]    The chief charm of Rye is to walk along the narrow streets and lanes,  and see the picturesque rows and groups of old fifteenth-and  sixteenth-century houses with their tiled roofs and gables,  weather-boarded or tile-hung after the manner of Sussex cottages,  graceful bay-windows--altogether pleasing. Wherever one wanders one  meets with these charming dwellings, especially in West Street and  Pump Street; the oldest house in Rye being at the corner of the  churchyard. The Mermaid Inn is delightful both outside and inside,  with its low panelled rooms, immense fire-places and dog-grates. We  see the monogram and names and dates carved on the stone fire-places,  1643, 1646, the name Loffelholtz seeming to indicate some foreign  refugee or settler. It is pleasant to find at least in one town in  England so much that has been left unaltered and so little spoilt.    [Illustration: Inscription in the Mermaid Inn, Rye]          CHAPTER IV    IN STREETS AND LANES      I have said in another place that no country in the world can boast of  possessing rural homes and villages which have half the charm and  picturesqueness of our English cottages and hamlets.[10] They have to  be known in order that they may be loved. The hasty visitor may pass  them by and miss half their attractiveness. They have to be wooed in  varying moods in order that they may display their charms--when the  blossoms are bright in the village orchards, when the sun shines on  the streams and pools and gleams on the glories of old thatch, when  autumn has tinged the trees with golden tints, or when the hoar frost  makes their bare branches beautiful again with new and glistening  foliage. Not even in their summer garb do they look more beautiful.  There is a sense of stability and a wondrous variety caused by the  different nature of the materials used, the peculiar stone indigenous  in various districts and the individuality stamped upon them by  traditional modes of building.      [10] _The Charm of the English Village_ (Batsford).    We have still a large number of examples of the humbler kind of  ancient domestic architecture, but every year sees the destruction of  several of these old buildings, which a little care and judicious  restoration might have saved. Ruskin's words should be writ in bold,  big letters at the head of the by-laws of every district council.      \"Watch an old building with anxious care; guard it as best you    may, and at any cost, from any influence of dilapidation. Count    its stones as you would the jewels of a crown. Set watchers about    it, as if at the gate of a besieged city; bind it together with    iron when it loosens; stay it with timber when it declines. Do not    care about the unsightliness of the aid--better a crutch than a    lost limb; and do this tenderly and reverently and continually,    and many a generation will still be born and pass away beneath its    shadow.\"    [Illustration: Relic of Lynn Siege in Hampton Court, King's Lynn]    [Illustration: Hampton Court, King's Lynn, Norfolk]    If this sound advice had been universally taken many a beautiful old  cottage would have been spared to us, and our eyes would not be  offended by the wondrous creations of the estate agents and local  builders, who have no other ambition but to build cheaply. The  contrast between the new and the old is indeed deplorable. The old  cottage is a thing of beauty. Its odd, irregular form and various  harmonious colouring, the effects of weather, time, and accident,  environed with smiling verdure and sweet old-fashioned garden flowers,  its thatched roof, high gabled front, inviting porch overgrown with  creepers, and casement windows, all combine to form a fair and  beautiful home. And then look at the modern cottage with its glaring  brick walls, slate roof, ungainly stunted chimney, and note the  difference. Usually these modern cottages are built in a row,"]]]
