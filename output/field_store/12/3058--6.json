Such a large quantity of pulse appears to us excessive, and  would cause discomfort to most persons. We much doubt whether those  Indians who are strict vegetarians could consume such quantities.    Some valuable investigations were made on the diet of a family of  fruitarians, at the Californian Agricultural Experimental Station, July,  1900, by Professor M.E. Jaffa (bulletin 107). The proportion of food, both  proteid and carbo-hydrate used was surprisingly small. The research is  particularly important, as the diet was not an experimental one, tried  during a short period only; but that to which the family were accustomed.  The family consisted of two women and three children; they had all been  fruitarians for five to seven years, and made no change in their dietary  during the experiment. They only had two meals a day, the food being eaten  uncooked. The quantities of all the foods and other particulars are  detailed in the bulletin. The first meal was at 10-30 a.m., and always  consisted of nuts followed by fruits. The other meal was about 5 p.m.,  when they usually ate no nuts, substituting olive oil and honey. The nuts  used were almonds, Brazil, pine, pignolias and walnuts; the fresh fruits  were apples, apricots, bananas, figs, grapes, oranges, peaches and pears.  Other foods were dates, raisins, pickled olives, olive oil and honey. One  person (_b_) ate a little celery and tomatoes, and another (_c_) a little  cereal food. In the following table are given the average daily quantities  of the food constituents in grammes:--Proteids, fat, carbo-hydrate, crude  fibre, value in calories and nutrient ratio. The crude fibre is classed as  a carbo-hydrate and included in the calorie value, and also in calculating  the nutrient ratio.                                            Pro. Fat. C'r'b. Fibre. Cal.

(_a_) The tentative standard for a woman at light work calls for 90  grammes of proteids and 2,500 calories; it is thus seen that the quantity  of food eaten was far below that usually stated as being necessary. The  subject, however, was a very small woman, 5 feet in height, taking almost  no physical exercise. She believed, as do fruitarians generally, that  people need far less raw than cooked food. (_b_) The food eaten was even  less in quantity than in the previous dietary. One reason for this was the  fact that the subject was, for part of the time at least, under great  mental strain, and did not have her usual appetite. Even this small amount  of food, judging by her appearance and manner, seemed sufficient for her  needs, enabling her to do her customary housework and take care of her two  nieces and nephew, the subjects of the other experiments. (_c_) This girl  was given cereals and vegetables when she craved them, but her aunt says  she never looks nor feels so well when she has much starchy food, and  returns to her next meal of uncooked food with an increased appreciation  of its superiority. The commonly accepted dietary standard for a child 13  years old and of average activity, is not far from 90 grammes of proteids  and 2,450 calories, yet the girl had all the appearance of being well fed  and in excellent health and spirits. (_d_) During the 22 days of  experiment, there was an increase in weight of 2 pounds, due to the fact  that the family had been in straitened circumstances, and the food  provided was more abundant during the study. (_e_) The subject had been  very delicate as a baby. She was very small for her age, being 10 pounds  under the average weight, and 7 inches less than the average height. It is  interesting to note that her only gain in weight during the past year was  made during this dietary and the one immediately following. This was due  to her being urged to eat all she wanted, of what she most preferred, as  the food was provided by those making the study. The proteid is less than  the tentative standard for a child of 1 to 2 years old, but the subject  appeared perfectly well and was exceedingly active. She impressed one as  being a healthy child, but looked younger than her age. (_ee_) The subject  is the same as in the previous experiment (_e_), but after an interval of  8 months, her seventh birthday occurred during the time.    Professor Jaffa, who made the investigation, says:--\"It would appear that  all the subjects were decidedly under-nourished, even making allowance for  their light weight. But when we consider that the two adults have lived  upon this diet for seven years, and think they are in better health and  capable of more work than they ever were before, we hesitate to pronounce  judgment. The three children had the appearance of health and strength.  They ran and jumped and played all day like ordinary healthy children, and  were said to be unusually free from colds and other complaints common to  childhood. The youngest child, and the only one who has lived as a  fruitarian almost from infancy was certainly undeveloped. She looked fully  two years younger than she was. Still, there are so many children who are  below the average in development, whose dietaries conform to the ordinary  standards, that it would be unfair to draw any conclusions until many more  such investigations are made.\"    The research shows that not only is there need of a revision of the  \"standard\" quantity of proteids, but also of the carbo-hydrates and fats.  It is generally said by those who have no practical experience amongst  vegetarians, that the latter require a much larger quantity of food than  do those who include flesh. The truth is that vegetarians eat less, often  much less. It is a common experience that vegetable food has a more  staying power, and a much longer period can be allowed between meals,  without the inconvenience that a flesh-eater, especially a flesh and  alcohol consumer, suffers. This is due, in part at least, to its less  stimulating character and its slower digestion. This fact has been shown  by the success of vegetarians in feats of strength and endurance, and  especially in the comparatively fresh condition in which they have  finished long walking, cycling, tennis, and other matches. Those who  attempt to prolong their powers of endurance by flesh extracts and  stimulating foods and drinks, usually finish in a very exhausted  condition. The superior endurance and recovery from wounds, when compared  with our English soldiers, of simple feeding men, such as the Zulus, Turks  and Japanese, has often been remarked. It is often said that vegetable  food, as it contains more fibre and is slower of digestion, taxes the  bodily organs more. If we attempted to eat uncooked, the more fibrous  vegetables, the grains, and unripe fruit, it would be quite true, but it  is not so of the ordinary food of vegetarians. A slowness of digestion  does not necessarily imply a greater strain on the system. As vegetables,  in particular, are for the longest period of time in the intestines, and  undergo the greater part of their digestion there, a gentle and slow  process of digestion in that organ may be more thorough. It may also  entail less expenditure of nervous energy than if the food had been of  such a stimulating character, as to be hurried along the digestive tract.  Digestion is for the most part a chemical process. If the food is of right  kind and quantity, thoroughly masticated, assisted if necessary by  cookery, and the digestive ferments are normal, digestion proceeds without  any sensible expenditure or energy or consciousness of its accomplishment.  There is nothing improbable in a flesh-eater requiring more food than a  simple living vegetarian. His food contains more proteid, and  excrementitious matter or extractives; these stimulate the digestive  organs and overtax the excretory ones. Generally, he is fond of  condiments, salt, and elaborate cooking, often also of alcohol; if a man,  probably of tobacco. He lives, as it were, at high pressure.    There are on record certain experiments which appear to indicate the  necessity of a large proportion of proteid, especially when the diet has  been of vegetable origin. These experiments are inconclusive, because the  subject has been accustomed to an ordinary flesh diet, perhaps also to  alcoholic drinks. The change to a comparatively non-stimulating diet  cannot be made, and the digestive organs expected to adapt themselves in  a few days. Perhaps not even a month or a year would suffice, for some  people, and yet that same diet would suit others. In some experiments the  food has not been appetising, the subject has even taken it with  reluctance or even loathing; an excess of some food has been eaten which  no vegetarian or anybody else would think of using in a practical dietary.    Sometimes persons on changing from an ordinary flesh dietary, lose weight  and strength. Generally, it is found that they have done little more than  discontinue the flesh, without substituting suitable foods. Authorities  think it is from a deficiency of proteid, and recommend an addition of  such foods as pulse, wheatmeal, oatmeal, eggs, milk, cheese, and such as a  reference to the table of analyses, show a low nutrient ratio figure. This  may also be due to an insufficiency of food eaten, owing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15240"],[0,"A Journal of a Tour in the Congo Free State (#11)"],[1," not rise again for some hours. One unfortunate  animal was however, shot in the back and rearing straight up on his hind  legs rushed for some yards in that attitude until a second shot in the  head put him out of his misery.    Next day we reach Lukolela, a Wood Post and telegraph station. The line  runs along the bank all the way from Leopoldville to Coquilhatville and  was very difficult to erect. A space had to be cleared in the forest  nearly two hundred feet wide and the line erected in the centre on iron  posts, so that any falling trees would not destroy it. At first, the  elephants strongly resented these novel posts and frequently knocked  them down as easily as if they had been nine pins, but have since become  used to them. At Lukolela there is excellent teak wood which is  fashioned into doors and windows and shipped to various places ready for  building. The nights are quite cool, although we are near the Equator  and the heat in the day time is not nearly as oppressive as it is at  Aden or Shanghai in the summer. Cultivation is much more advanced here  than in the lower Congo and the physique of the natives is remarkably  fine.    The navigation of the river here becomes very difficult, for the water  is shallow at this season of the year and there are many sand banks  which frequently change their position. Charts are therefore,  practically useless and each skipper has to feel his way each voyage.  Indeed, the whole time two boys sit on the bows of the vessel with long  poles sounding the water and shouting out the depth. It is curious that  when the vessel is travelling in shallow water, the engines at once go  slow of their own accord. One of the engineers explained that this  phenomena was produced by the difficulty the wheels experienced in  dragging away, so to speak, the water from under the ship when there was  little depth. Still the ships, frequently run on the banks, but as they  are flat bottomed, are not usually injured. The method of mooring is  very rudimentary although practical. One of the crew jumps overboard  with a steel rope, swims ashore and makes it fast to a tree. All of them  are expert swimmers and seem to enjoy their frequent dips, and as their  clothes consist of a loin cloth only, they do not require to undress.    On August 1st at sunset we reach Irebu, an exceedingly beautiful place.  An avenue of palms stretches parallel to the river and about twenty  yards from it the bank itself being fenced by white wooden rails. This  leads to a large open square around which are the brick houses of the  European officers. Beyond, along the river front, are more brick houses,  the Mess and the Magazines, and gardens are laid out the whole length of  the town. This is one of the large military training centres, where  about a dozen officers prepare more than a thousand recruits for the  Force Publique.    In the evening the place was illuminated by very simple, but effective,  means. Stakes were driven into the ground and on each was placed a tin  which presumably had contained condensed milk. These were filled with  palm oil and pieces of wood to serve as wicks. The mosquitoes here are  very bad indeed and it is necessary to take quinine every day to  counteract the effects of their poison.    At daybreak next morning most of the troops were exercising in the  square and their precision and manoeuvring were really marvellous. Any  European colonel might indeed be proud to hear such a single click as  his regiment shouldered arms. The officers state that the natives attend  very carefully all the time for the word of command and act very quickly  after it is given. The native corporals evidently make good instructors  and the raw recruit is soon converted into a smart and responsible  soldier. This military education is certainly the best that could be  given to a savage; it teaches him punctuality, regularity, obedience and  collective responsibility; it shows him how to build houses and keep  them clean and it gives him an idea of justice for he knows he will be  punished for wrong doing. The soldier therefore soon becomes an  altogether different person and realises that he is no longer an  animal-man living wild in the forest, but a soldier-man and a friend of  the great _Bulamatadi_. who governs the country. What we may call the  caste feeling has indeed contributed greatly to civilising the country.  Anyone who is brought into direct contact with the whites as a soldier,  a worker in the plantation or on the roads, soon feels that he is  superior to the wild bushman and then becomes more attached to his new  master than to his own cousins. It is rather amusing to hear the native  domestics or _boys_. who probably rank higher than any other natives on  the social ladder, speaking of the _indigenes_. with great contempt as  though they were quite another and an inferior species. Speaking of  _Bulamatadi_, it may be of interest to state the origin and meaning of  the term--it means literally in the native tongue _one who breaks  stones_. and was given to Stanley, when he blasted rocks to make roads  the term being afterwards buried with him on his coffin. Since then it  has been applied to all officials of the State and is used to connote  anything and everything connected with the State. Thus the State side of  the river is Bulamatadi, a State Post is Bulamatadi, a State steamer is  Bulamatadi, anything indeed belonging to the State is Bulamatadi. White  men traders and hunters, not State officials, are _mundellas_, but the  native at once has a nick name for everyone which describes his chief  characteristic. Lord Mountmorres usually wore long hunting boots and was  named _big boots_. and as I wore eyeglasses, I became _double eyes_.    We left Irebu on August 2nd and at once disturbed many crocodiles and  hippos, which abound in this district. An unfortunate accident happened  in the afternoon. One of the crew fell overboard and must have been  drawn under the stern wheel and struck by a paddle, for he never  re-appeared and no sign of the poor fellow could be found, although  diligent search was made for a long time.    Just before sunset a canoe comes alongside and fastens to the ship,  although it is travelling at full speed. It is indeed wonderful to see  the way the natives manipulate these narrow dug-outs not two feet wide.  In this one were three fishermen with some fish which looked like trout  for sale. At once a great clamouring takes place among the native  passengers and it soon becomes plain that the chief fisherman was a good  man of business. Having taken an empty bottle for one fish and a piece  of cloth for another, he refused more of those articles and demanded  either salt or mitakos for his goods. In a short time however, he had  disposed of his cargo and paddled contentedly away.    [Illustration: NATIVES OF THE UPPER CONGO.]    The natives are very vain and take much trouble over their personal  appearance. As their clothes are very simple this is concentrated on  their tatooage and on their hair dressing. From a hopeless looking  tangle of black tow a very pretty erection is created by the barbers who  are of both sexes. Often the hair has five or six separate partings and  quills or feathers are inserted into the ridges in between. All the  women here wear a simple piece of cloth as they do in the Lower Congo  and sometimes a plain leather belt is worn round the waist. The arms and  legs are bare and covered with plain bangles made of mitakos. The women  wear no hat of any kind, but the men ape the Europeans and appear in  old helmets or straw hats. Both sexes are very clean personally, and  bathe frequently in the river, but never dry themselves afterwards. The  men keep on their loin cloths, but if they wear also shirts or trousers,  take these off, while the women bathe in a white linen loin cloth and  everyone afterwards pulls on his other clothes without drying. Many  natives rub a red powder into the skin made from cam-wood and thus  acquire a copper colour, while others paint their faces with various  stripes of red, yellow or white. On the Congo however, where the natives  are becoming civilised, this custom seems to be dying out.    On August 3rd we cross the Equator marked by a post on one side of the  river and the point of an island in the centre. Here used to be a  settlement, but most of the people have moved higher up. There is still  a Mission near the place and a good road runs along the bank between  plantations of bananas and gardens to Coquilhatville which we reach in  the afternoon.    [Illustration: BOTANICAL GARDENS AT EALA.]          CHAPTER IV.    The Equator District.      Coquilhatville, the capital of this important District is the largest  town in the Upper Congo. The roads are formed by bamboos laid in rows,  upon which sand and mud are placed the whole forming an effective  pavement for foot passengers and no other is required for there are no  carriages and only a few horses. All the officers don white uniforms  with full dress, badges and medals, and together we proceed to make a  formal call on Captain Stevens, the Commissaire of the District with  whom is staying Mr. Malfeyt, Commissaire du Roi. Some of the officers  take their dogs with them, which at once make a furious onslaught on  the numerous cats of the Commissaire and have to be suppressed. Mgr.  Derikx places a particularly pugnacious fox-terrier under the basket  work of his chair the little animal being literally sat upon by the  dignitary of the Church.    The Residency is a large brick building situated on a low hill and  raised above the ground, the space beneath being enclosed and  loop-holed, thus forming a small fort. The gardens are particularly  pretty and well kept. Beer is handed round and we sit chatting on the  verandah until Mr. Grenfell, the head of the Baptist Mission, arrives.
