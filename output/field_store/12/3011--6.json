In this philosophy the  conception of Soul was not simply, as with us, the immaterial subject of  consciousness.  How warily the interpreter has to tread here, every one  knows who has dipped, even superficially, into the controversies among  Platonists themselves.  All admit the distinction between the rational  and the irrational part or principle, the latter including, first, the  sensibility, and secondly, the Plastic, or that lower which in obedience  to its sympathies enables the soul to attach itself to, and to organize  into a suitable body those substances of the universe to which it is  most congruous.  It is more difficult to determine whether Plato or his  principal followers, recognized in the rational soul or nous a distinct  and separable entity, that which is sometimes discriminated as \"the  Spirit.\"  Dr. Henry More, no mean authority, repudiates this  interpretation.  \"There can be nothing more monstrous,\" he says, \"than  to make two souls in man, the one sensitive, the other rational, really  distinct from one another, and to give the name of Astral spirit to the  former, when there is in man no Astral spirit beside the Plastic of the  soul itself, which is always inseparable from that which is rational.  Nor upon any other account can it be called Astral, but as it is liable  to that corporeal temperament which proceeds from the stars, or rather  from any material causes in general, as not being yet sufficiently  united with the divine body--that vehicle of divine virtue or power.\"  So he maintains that the Kabalistic three souls--Nephesh, Ruach,  Neschamah--originate in a misunderstanding of the true Platonic  doctrine, which is that of a threefold \"vital congruity.\"  These  correspond to the three degrees of bodily existence, or to the three  \"vehicles,\" the terrestrial, the aerial, and the ethereal.  The latter  is the augoeides--the luciform vehicle of the purified soul whose  irrational part has been brought under complete subjection to the  rational.  The aerial is that in which the great majority of mankind  find themselves at the dissolution of the terrestrial body, and in which  the incomplete process of purification has to be undergone during long  ages of preparation for the soul's return to its primitive, ethereal  state.  For it must be remembered that the preexistence of souls is a  distinguishing tenet of this philosophy as of the Kabala.  The soul has  \"sunk into matter.\" From its highest original state the revolt of its  irrational nature has awakened and developed successively its \"vital  congruities\" with the regions below, passing, by means of its \"Plastic,\"  first into the aerial and afterwards into the terrestrial condition.  Each of these regions teems also with an appropriate population which  never passes, like the human soul, from one to the other--\"gods,\"  \"demons,\" and animals.*  As to duration, \"the shortest of all is that of  the terrestrial vehicle.  In the aerial, the soul may inhabit, as they  define, many ages, and in the ethereal, for ever.\"    ---------  * The allusion here is to those beings of the several kingdoms of the  elements which we Theosophists, following after the Kabalists, have  called the \"Elementals.\"  They never become men.  --Ed. Theos.  ---------    Speaking of the second body, Henry More says \"the soul's astral vehicle  is of that tenuity that itself can as easily pass the smallest pores of  the body as the light does glass, or the lightning the scabbard of a  sword without tearing or scorching of it.\"  And again, \"I shall make  bold to assert that the soul may live in an aerial vehicle as well as in  the ethereal, and that there are very few that arrive to that high  happiness as to acquire a celestial vehicle immediately upon their  quitting the terrestrial one;  that heavenly chariot necessarily  carrying us in triumph to the greatest happiness the soul of man is  capable of, which would arrive to all men indifferently, good or bad, if  the parting with this earthly body would suddenly mount us into the  heavenly.  When by a just Nemesis the souls of men that are not  heroically virtuous will find themselves restrained within the compass  of this caliginous air, as both Reason itself suggests, and the  Platonists have unanimously determined.\" Thus also the most  thorough-going, and probably the most deeply versed in the doctrines of  the master among modern Platonists, Thomas Taylor (Introduction.  Phaedo):--\"After this our divine philosopher informs that the pure soul  will after death return to pure and eternal natures;  but that the  impure soul, in consequence of being imbued with terrene affections,  will be drawn down to a kindred nature, and be invested with a gross  vehicle capable of being seen by the corporeal eye.*  For while a  propensity to body remains in the soul, it causes her to attract a  certain vehicle to herself;  either of an aerial nature, or composed  from the spirit and vapours of her terrestrial body, or which is  recently collected from surrounding air;  for according to the arcana of  the Platonic philosophy, between an ethereal body, which is simple and  immaterial and is the eternal connate vehicle of the soul, and a terrene  body, which is material and composite, and of short duration, there is  an aerial body, which is material indeed, but simple and of a more  extended duration; and in this body the unpurified soul dwells for a  long time after its exit from hence, till this pneumatic vehicle being  dissolved, it is again invested with a composite body;  while on the  contrary the purified soul immediately ascends into the celestial  regions with its ethereal vehicle alone.\"    ----------  * This is the Hindu theory of nearly every one of the Aryan  philosophies.--Ed. Theos.  ----------    Always it is the disposition of the soul that determines the quality of  its body.  \"However the soul be in itself affected,\" says Porphyry  (translated by Cudworth), \"so does it always find a body suitable and  agreeable to its present disposition, and therefore to the purged soul  does naturally accrue a body that comes next to immateriality, that is,  an ethereal one.\"  And the same author, \"The soul is never quite naked  of all body, but hath always some body or other joined with it, suitable  and agreeable to its present disposition (either a purer or impurer  one).  But that at its first quitting this gross earthly body, the  spirituous body which accompanieth it (as its vehicle) must needs go  away fouled and incrassated with the vapours and steams thereof, till  the soul afterwards by degrees purging itself, this becometh at length a  dry splendour, which hath no misty obscurity nor casteth any shadow.\"  Here it will be seen, we lose sight of the specific difference of the  two future vehicles--the ethereal is regarded as a sublimation of the  aerial.  This, however, is opposed to the general consensus of Plato's  commentators. Sometimes the ethereal body, or augoeides, is appropriated  to the rational soul, or spirit, which must then be considered as a  distinct entity, separable from the lower soul.  Philoponus, a Christian  writer, says, \"that the Rational Soul, as to its energie, is separable  from all body, but the irrational part or life thereof is separable only  from this gross body, and not from all body whatsoever, but hath after  death a spirituous or airy body, in which it acteth--this I say is a  true opinion which shall afterwards be proved by us.... The irrational  life of the soul hath not all its being in this gross earthly body, but  remaineth after the soul's departure out of it, having for its vehicle  and subject the spirituous body, which itself is also compounded out of  the four elements, but receiveth its denomination from the predominant  part, to wit, Air, as this gross body of ours is called earthy from what  is most predominant therein.\"--Cudworth, \"Intell. Syst.\"  From the same  source we extract the following:  \"Wherefore these ancients say that  impure souls after their departure out of this body wander here up and  down for a certain space in their spirituous vaporous and airy body,  appearing about sepulchres and haunting their former habitation.  For  which cause there is great reason that we should take care of living  well, as also of abstaining from a fouler and grosser diet;  these  Ancients telling us likewise that this spirituous body of ours being  fouled and incrassated by evil diet, is apt to render the soul in this  life also more obnoxious to the disturbances of passions.  They further  add that there is something of the Plantal or Plastic life, also  exercised by the soul, in those spirituous or airy bodies after death;  they being nourished too, though not after the same manner, as those  gross earthy bodies of ours are here, but by vapours, and that not by  parts or organs, but throughout the whole of them (as sponges), they  imbibing everywhere those vapours. For which cause they who are wise  will in this life also take care of using a thinner and dryer diet, that  so that spirituous body (which we have also at this present time within  our proper body) may not be clogged and incrassed, but attenuated.  Over  and above which, those Ancients made use of catharms, or purgations to  the same end and purpose also.  For as this earthy body is washed by  water so is that spirituous body cleansed by cathartic vapours--some of  these vapours being nutritive, others purgative.  Moreover, these  Ancients further declared concerning this spirituous body that it was  not organized, but did the whole of it in every part throughout exercise  all functions of sense, the soul hearing, seeing and perceiving all  sensibles by it everywhere.  For which cause Aristotle himself affirmeth  in his Metaphysics that there is properly but one sense and one Sensory.  He by this one sensory meaneth the spirit, or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14392"],[0,"George Du Maurier, the Satirist of the Victorians (#11)"],[1," in  impressing readers with the reality of the character. The delicacy of du  Maurier's psychology in this portrait of a middle-aged man of the period  is in marked contrast with the improbability of so many of his  renderings of elderly people wherever he went outside of his stock  types. It justifies his realism and mistrust of memory drawing. Through  his failure to sustain his interest in life always at this pitch his art  at the end of his career showed just the lack of this close observation  of character. It often then seems too content to rest its claims on  accurate drawing, even when what was drawn was not worth accuracy. And  this is the fault of all the modern school.    Good drawing does not so much interest us in things as in the drama  centred in them. Thus we have actually such things as horror, passion,  gentleness, and other invisible things conveyed to us in the lines of a  drawing. We may indeed know genius from talent by the much more of the  invisible which it transfers to visible line. Du Maurier, in drawing  children, for instance, secures their prepossessing qualities. Drawing  is great when it conveys something which in itself has not an  outline--like the \"atmosphere\" of a Victorian drawing-room.      Section 10    Intensely artistic natures make everything very self-expressive without  conscious intention. For this reason an artist's handwriting tends to be  more worth looking at than other people's. The draughtsman lavishes some  of his skill upon his handwriting. This more particularly applies to the  signature, which is written with fuller consciousness than other  words. Artists, owing to their intense interest in \"appearances,\"  generally start by being a little self-conscious about their signature.  But that period passes, and the autograph becomes set, to grow fragile  with old age and shrink, but not to alter in its real characteristics.  The signature at the foot of a picture presents a rather different  problem from the signature at the foot of a letter. It must necessarily  be a more deliberate and self-conscious affair, but it is no less  expressive. German deliberation was never so well expressed as in Albert  Durer's signature.    [Illustration: Caution    \"Don't keep your Beer-Barrel in the same cellar as your _Dust-Bin!_\"    _Punch_, February 23, 1867.]    Self-advertisers always give themselves away with their signature. As a  rule, the finer the artist the more natural his signature in style. And  fine artists like to subscribe to the great tradition of their craft,  that the work is everything, the workman only someone in the fair light  of its effect; the name is added out of pride but not vain-glory, with  that modest air with which a hero turns the conversation from himself.  Naturalness and mastery arrive at the same moment; students cannot sign  their works naturally. Du Maurier's signature passed through many  transformations, and there were times, too, when the artist was quite  undecided between the plentiful choice of his Christian names--George  Louis Palmella Busson. An artist beginning his career at the present day  with such a choice of names would most certainly have made use of the  \"Palmella\" in full--an advertisement asset. But advertisement _is_  vulgar. Du Maurier belonged to the Victorians, who were never vulgar.    [Illustration]    FOOTNOTES:    [1] _The Life and Letters of Charles Samuel Keene_, by Charles Somes  Layard. London: Sampson Low, Marston & Co., Ltd., 1892.          III    DU MAURIER AS AUTHOR    Section 1      Queen Victoria was the Queen of Hearts; her reign was the reign of  sentiment. The redundancy of tender reference to Prince Albert at  Windsor has been known to bore visitors to the town. Life must have been  tiring in those days, tossed, as everyone was, if we believe the art of  the time, from one wave of sentiment to another. Men went \"into the  city\" to get a little rest, and there framed this code: that there  should be no sentiment in business.    So the Victorians put their sentiment into art, into stories and  illustrations. They put some of the best of their black-and-white art  into a Magazine called _Good Words_. Only the Victorians could have  invented such a title for a Magazine, or lived up to it.    The literary tradition of that time, so far as the novel was concerned,  expired with du Maurier. He came near to having a style as natural as  Thackeray's, and he was quite as sentimental.    Before he began to write novels, he prided himself upon the fact that a  store of \"plots\" for novels lay undeveloped in his mind. It was the  offer of a \"plot\" to Mr. Henry James one evening when they were walking  up and down the High Street, Bayswater, that resulted in du Maurier  becoming a novelist. Du Maurier told him the plot of _Trilby._ \"But you  ought to write that story,\" cried James. \"I can't write,\" he replied; \"I  have never written. If you like the plot so much you may take it.\" Mr.  James said that it was too valuable a present to take, and that du  Maurier must write the story himself.    On reaching home that night he set to work. By the next morning he had  written the first two numbers not of _Trilby_ but of _Peter Ibbetson_.  \"It seemed all to flow from my pen, without effort in a full stream,\" he  said, \"but I thought it must be poor stuff, and I determined to look for  an omen to learn whether any success would attend this new departure. So  I walked out into the garden, and the very first thing that I saw was a  large wheelbarrow, and that comforted me and reassured me, for, as you  will remember, there is a wheelbarrow in the first chapter of _Peter  Ibbetson._\"[2]    _Peter Ibbetson_--\"The young man, lonely, chivalrous and disquieted by a  touch of genius,\" as the hero has been well described--was written for  money, and brought its author a thousand pounds.    _Peter Ibbetson_ was not put above _Trilby_ in the author's lifetime;  but we believe it to have much more vitality than the latter work. The  actual writing of it was not perhaps taken quite so seriously as that of  _Trilby_, and it gains nothing on that account; but it is a book in  which there is intensity, in which everything is not spread out thinly  as in _Trilby_. Du Maurier himself believed that _Peter Ibbetson_ was  the better book. It certainly witnesses to the nobility of the author's  mind; it expresses the quick sympathy of the artist temperament--the  instinct for finding extenuating circumstances which artists share with  women, and which both rightly regard as the same thing as the sense of  justice. The tale of _Peter Ibbetson_ breathes a great human sympathy.  The simplicity with which it is written adds to its effect. We cross a  track of horror in it by the ray of a generous light. It is by this book  I like to think that du Maurier will be remembered as a writer. It was  characteristic of him that he could touch a theme that in all  superficial aspects was sordid without the loss of the bloom of true  romance. The real plot of this story, however, does not lie with  incident, but with the maintenance of an elevated frame of mind in  defiance of circumstances. The author realises that mind triumphs always  more easily over matter than over \"circumstances.\" To the damage of the  plot he brings his hero the utmost psychic assistance from an  inadmissible source, but the picture of the prisoner's soul prevailing  in the face of complete temporal disaster is still a true one.    Du Maurier's publishers believed in _Trilby_ from the very first. They  began by offering double the _Peter Ibbetson_ terms, while generously  urging him to retain his rights in the book by accepting a little less  in a lump sum and receiving a royalty. But so little faith did he pin to  _Trilby_ that he said \"No!\"    Within a few weeks the \"boom\" began. And when Harpers' saw what  proportions it was likely to assume, they voluntarily destroyed the  agreement, and arranged to allow him a handsome royalty on every copy  sold. An admirer of Byron, du Maurier repudiated as cruelly unfair the  poet's line, \"Now Barabbas was a publisher.\" The publisher also handed  over to him the dramatic rights with which he had parted for a small sum  like fifty pounds, and thus he became a partner in the dramatic property  called _Trilby_ as a \"play.\"    [Illustration]      Section 2    _Trilby_ was a name that had long lain _perdu_ somewhere \"at the back of  du Maurier's head.\" He traced it to a story by Charles Nodier, in which  Trilby was a man. The name Trilby also appears in a poem by Alfred de  Musset. And to this name, and to the story of a woman which was once  told to him, du Maurier's _Trilby_ owed her birth. \"From the moment the  name occurred to me,\" he said, \"I was struck with its value. I at once  realised that it was a name of great importance. I think I must have  felt as happy as Thackeray did when the title of _Vanity Fair_ suggested  itself to him.\"    _Trilby_ is written with a daintiness that corresponds with the neatness  of its illustrations. It has the attractiveness which du Maurier had  such skill in giving. But though dealing with Bohemia, the author is  conventional; that is, he keeps strictly to the surface of things. And  every true sentiment of the book is spoilt by the quickly following  laugh in which the author betrays his dread of being thought to take  anything seriously.    [Illustration: Berkeley Square, 5 P.M.    _Punch_, August 24, 1867.]    The machinery of the plot is crude; perhaps this reason as well as the  delicate one assigned made Mr. Henry James refuse it. But du Maurier had  a curious skill in revealing states of mind of real psychological and  pathological interest. The sudden cessation of the power to feel  affection, and of the ability to respond emotionally to nature, the  curious loss of bloom in mental faculty in the case of Little Billee, in  this we have an inquiry into a by no means unusual state of mind"]]]
