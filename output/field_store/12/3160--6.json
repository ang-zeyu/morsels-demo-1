This pylon measures 104 feet in length, and is 32 feet 6 inches wide,  by 58 feet high. It contains no internal chambers, but merely a narrow  staircase which leads to the top of the doorway, and thence to the  summit of the towers. Four long angular grooves run up the facade of the  towers to a height of about twenty feet from the ground, and are in  the same line with a similar number of square holes which pierce the  thickness of the building higher up. In these grooves were placed  Venetian masts, made of poles spliced together and held in their place  by means of hooks and wooden stays which projected from the four holes;  these masts were to carry at their tops pennons of various colours.  Such was the temple of Khonsu, and the majority of the great Theban  buildings--at Luxor, Qurneh, and Bamesseum, or Medinet-Uabu--were  constructed on similar lines. Even in their half-ruined condition there  is something oppressive and uncanny in their appearance. The gods  loved to shroud themselves in mystery, and, therefore, the plan of  the building was so arranged as to render the transition almost  imperceptible from the blinding sunlight outside to the darkness of  their retreat within. In the courtyard, we are still surrounded by vast  spaces to which air and light have free access. The hypostyle hall,  however, is pervaded by an appropriate twilight, the sanctuary is veiled  in still deeper darkness, while in the chambers beyond reigns an almost  perpetual night. The effect produced by this gradation of obscurity  was intensified by constructional artifices. The different parts of the  building are not all on the same ground-level, the pavement rising as  the sanctuary is approached, and the rise is concealed by a few steps  placed at intervals. The difference of level in the temple of Khonsu is  not more than five feet three inches, but it is combined with a still  more considerable lowering of the height of the roof. From the pylon  to the wall at the further end the height decreases as we go on; the  peristyle is more lofty than the hypostyle hall, this again is higher  than the sanctuary and the hall of columns, and the chamber beyond it  drops still further in altitude.*         * This is \"the law of progressive diminution of heights\" of       Perrot-Chipiez.    Karnak is an exception to this rule; this temple had in the course of  centuries undergone so many restorations and additions, that it formed a  collection of buildings rather than a single edifice. It might have  been regarded, as early as the close of the Theban empire, as a kind of  museum, in which every century and every period of art, from the XIIth  dynasty downwards, had left its distinctive mark.*         * A on the plan denotes the XIIth dynasty temple; B is the       great hypostyle hall of Seti I. and Ramses II.; C the temple       of Ramses III.    [Illustration: 081.jpg THE TEMPLE OF AMON AT KARNAK]    All the resources of architecture had been brought into requisition  during this period to vary, at the will of each sovereign, the  arrangement and the general effect of the component parts. Columns with  sixteen sides stand in the vicinity of square pillars, and lotiform  capitals alternate with those of the bell-shape; attempts were even made  to introduce new types altogether. The architect who built at the back  of the sanctuary what is now known as the colonnade of Thutmosis  III., attempted to invert the bell-shaped capital; the bell was turned  downwards, and the neck attached to the plinth, while the mouth rested  on the top of the shaft. This awkward arrangement did not meet with  favour, for we find it nowhere repeated; other artists, however, with  better taste, sought at this time to apply the flowers symbolical of  Upper and Lower Egypt to the decorations of the shafts. In front of the  sanctuary of Karnak two pillars are still standing which have on them  in relief representations respectively of the fullblown lotus and the  papyrus. A building composed of so many incongruous elements required  frequent restoration--a wall which had been undermined by water needed  strengthening, a pylon displaying cracks claimed attention, some  unsafe colonnade, or a colossus which had been injured by the fall of  a cornice, required shoring up--so that no sooner had the corvee for  repairs completed their work in one part, than they had to begin again  elsewhere.    [Illustration: 082.jpg THE TWO STELE-PILLARS AT KARNAK]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Beato.    The revenues of Amon must, indeed, have been enormous to have borne the  continual drain occasioned by restoration, and the resources of the god  would soon have been exhausted had not foreign wars continued to furnish  him during several centuries with all or more than he needed.    The gods had suffered severely in the troublous times which had followed  the reign of Seti II., and it required all the generosity of Ramses III.  to compensate them for the losses they had sustained during the anarchy  under Arisu. The spoil taken from the Libyans, from the Peoples of the  Sea, and from the Hittites had flowed into the sacred treasuries, while  the able administration of the sovereign had done the rest, so that on  the accession of Ramses IV. the temples were in a more prosperous state  than ever.* They held as their own property 169 towns, nine of which  were in Syria and Ethiopia; they possessed 113,433 slaves of both sexes,  493,386 head of cattle, 1,071,780 arurse of land, 514 vineyards and  orchards, 88 barks and sea-going vessels, 336 kilograms of gold both in  ingots and wrought, 2,993,964 grammes of silver, besides quantities of  copper and precious stones, and hundreds of storehouses in which they  kept corn, oil, wine, honey, and preserved meats--the produce of their  domains. Two examples will suffice to show the extent of this latter  item: the live geese reached the number of 680,714, and the salt or  smoked fish that of 494,800.** Amon claimed the giant share of this  enormous total, and three-fourths of it or more were reserved for his  use, namely---86,486 slaves, 421,362 head of cattle, 898,168 _arurse_  of cornland, 433 vineyards and orchards, and 56 Egyptian towns. The nine  foreign towns all belonged to him, and one of them contained the temple  in which he was worshipped by the Syrians whenever they came to pay  their tribute to the king's representatives: it was but just that his  patrimony should surpass that of his compeers, since the conquering  Pharaohs owed their success to him, who, without the co-operation of the  other feudal deities, had lavished victories upon them.         * The donations of Ramses III., or rather the total of the       donations made to the gods by the predecessors of that       Pharaoh, and confirmed and augmented by him, are enumerated       at length in the _Great Harris Papyrus_.         ** An abridgement of these donations occupies seven large       plates in the _Great Harris Papyrus_.    His domain was at least five times more considerable than that of Ra of  Heliopolis, and ten times greater than that of the Memphite Phtah, and  yet of old, in the earlier times of history, Ra and Phtah were reckoned  the wealthiest of the Egyptian gods. It is easy to understand the  influence which a god thus endowed with the goods of this world  exercised over men in an age when the national wars had the same  consequences for the immortals as for their worshippers, and when the  defeat of a people was regarded as a proof of the inferiority of  its patron gods. The most victorious divinity became necessarily the  wealthiest, before whom all other deities bowed, and whom they, as well  as their subjects, were obliged to serve.    So powerful a god as Amon had but few obstacles to surmount before  becoming the national deity; indeed, he was practically the foremost of  the gods during the Ramesside period, and was generally acknowledged  as Egypt's representative by all foreign nations.* His priests shared in  the prestige he enjoyed, and their influence in state affairs increased  proportionately with his power.         * From the XVIIIth dynasty, at least, the first prophet of       Amon had taken the precedence of the high priests of       Heliopolis and Memphis, as is proved by the position he       occupies in the Egyptian hierarchy in the _Hood Papyrus_.    The chief of their hierarchy, however, did not bear the high titles  which in ancient times distinguished those of Memphis and Heliopolis; he  was content with the humble appellation of first prophet of Amon. He  had for several generations been nominated by the sovereign, but he was  generally chosen from the families attached hereditarily or otherwise  to the temple of Karnak, and must previously have passed through every  grade of the priestly hierarchy. Those who aspired to this honour had to  graduate as \"divine fathers;\" this was the first step in the initiation,  and one at which many were content to remain, but the more ambitious or  favoured advanced by successive stages to the dignity of third, and then  of second, prophet before attaining to the highest rank.*         * What we know on this subject has been brought to light       mainly by the inscriptions on the statue of Baukuni-Khonsu       at Munich, published and commented on by Deveria, and by       Lauth. The cursus honorum of Rama shows us that he was first       third, then second prophet of Amon, before being raised to       the pontificate in the reign of Minephtah.    The Pharaohs of the XIXth dynasty jealously supervised the promotions  made in the Theban temples, and saw that none was elected except him who  was devoted to their interests--such as, for example, Baukuni-khonsu  and Unnofri under Ramses II. Baukuni-khonsu distinguished himself by his  administrative"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17327"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 7 (of 12) (#11)"],[1,"established here an Assyrian  colony, and, besides being the scene of royal festivities, it became  henceforth the centre of operations against the mountain tribes.         * The mountain cantons of Saratini and Duppani (Kalpani       l'Adpani?), situated immediately to the south of the Nahr-el-       Kebir, correspond to the southern part of Gebel-el-Akrad,       but I cannot discover any names on the modern map at all       resembling them.         ** Beyond Duppani, Assur-nazir-pal encamped on the banks of       a river whose name is unfortunately effaced, and then       reached Aribua; this itinerary leads us to the eastern slope       of the Gebel Ansarieh in the latitude of Hamath. The only       site I can find in this direction fulfilling the       requirements of the text is that of Masiad, where there       still exists a fort of the Assassins. The name Aribua is       perhaps preserved in that of Rabao, er-Rabahu, which is       applied to a wady and village in the neighbourhood of       Masiad.         *** Lukhuti must not be sought in the plains of the Orontes,       where Assur-nazir-pal would have run the risk of an       encounter with the King of Hamath or his vassals; it must       represent the part of the mountain of Ansarieh lying between       Kadmus, Masiad, and Tortosa.    The forts of the latter were destroyed, their houses burned, and  prisoners were impaled outside the gates of their cities. Having  achieved this noble exploit, the king crossed the intervening spurs of  Lebanon and marched down to the shores of the Mediterranean. Here he  bathed his weapons in the waters, and offered the customary sacrifices  to the gods of the sea, while the Phoenicians, with their wonted  prudence, hastened to anticipate his demands--Tyre, Sidon, Byblos,  Mahallat, Maiza, Kaiza, the Amorites and Arvad,* all sending tribute.         * The point where Assur-nazir-pal touched the sea-coast       cannot be exactly determined: admitting that he set out from       Masiad or its neighbourhood, he must have crossed the       Lebanon by the gorge of the Eleutheros, and reached the sea-       board somewhere near the mouth of this river.    One point strikes us forcibly as we trace on the map the march of this  victorious hero, namely, the care with which he confined himself to  the left bank of the Orontes, and the restraint he exercised in  leaving untouched the fertile fields of its valley, whose wealth was  so calculated to excite his cupidity. This discretion would be  inexplicable, did we not know that there existed in that region a  formidable power which he may have thought it imprudent to provoke. It  was Damascus which held sway over those territories whose frontiers he  respected, and its kings, also suzerains of Hamath and masters of half  Israel, were powerful enough to resist, if not conquer, any enemy who  might present himself. The fear inspired by Damascus naturally explains  the attitude adopted by the Hittite states towards the invader, and  the precautions taken by the latter to restrict his operations within  somewhat narrow limits. Having accepted the complimentary presents of  the Phoenicians, the king again took his way northwards--making a slight  detour in order to ascend the Amanos for the purpose of erecting there  a stele commemorating his exploits, and of cutting pines, cedars,  and larches for his buildings--and then returned to Nineveh amid the  acclamations of his people.    In reading the history of this campaign, its plan and the principal  events which took place in it appear at times to be the echo of what had  happened some centuries before. The recapitulation of the halting-places  near the sources of the Tigris and on the banks of the Upper Euphrates,  the marches through the valleys of the Zagros or on the slopes of  Kashiari, the crushing one by one of the Mesopotamian races, ending in a  triumphal progress through Northern Syria, is almost a repetition, both  as to the names and order of the places mentioned, of the expedition  made by Tiglath-pileser in the first five years of his reign. The  question may well arise in passing whether Assur-nazir-pal consciously  modelled his campaign on that of his ancestor, as, in Egypt, Ramses  III. imitated Ramses II., or whether, in similar circumstances, he  instinctively and naturally followed the same line of march. In  either case, he certainly showed on all sides greater wisdom than his  predecessor, and having attained the object of his ambition, avoided  compromising his success by injudiciously attacking Damascus or Babylon,  the two powers who alone could have offered effective resistance. The  victory he had gained, in 879, over the brother of Nabu-baliddin had  immensely flattered his vanity. His panegyrists vied with each other in  depicting Karduniash bewildered by the terror of his majesty, and the  Chaldaeans overwhelmed by the fear of his arms; but he did not allow  himself to be carried away by their extravagant flatteries, and  continued to the end of his reign to observe the treaties concluded  between the two courts in the time of his grandfather Ramman-nirari.*         * His frontier on the Chaldaean side, between the Tigris and       the mountains, was the boundary fixed by Ramman-nirari.    He had, however, sufficiently enlarged his dominions, in less than ten  years, to justify some display of pride. He himself described his empire  as extending, on the west of Assyria proper, from the banks of the  Tigris near Nineveh to Lebanon and the Mediterranean;* besides which,  Sukhi was subject to him, and this included the province of Rapiku on  the frontiers of Babylonia.**         * The expression employed in this description and in similar       passages, _ishtu ibirtan naru_, translated _from the ford       over the river_, or better, _from the other side of the       river_, must be understood as referring to Assyria proper:       the territory subject to the king is measured in the       direction indicated, starting from the rivers which formed       the boundaries of his hereditary dominions. _From the other       bank of the Tigris_ means from the bank of the Tigris       opposite Nineveh or Oalah, whence the king and his army set       out on their campaigns.         ** Rapiku is mentioned in several texts as marking the       frontier between the Sukhi and Chaldaea.    He had added to his older provinces of Amidi, Masios and Singar, the  whole strip of Armenian territory at the foot of the Taurus range, from  the sources of the Supnat to those of the Bitlis-tchai, and he held the  passes leading to the banks of the Arzania, in Kirruri and Gilzan, while  the extensive country of Nairi had sworn him allegiance. Towards the  south-east the wavering tribes, which alternately gave their adherence  to Assur or Babylon according to circumstances, had ranged themselves on  his side, and formed a large frontier province beyond the borders of his  hereditary kingdom, between the Lesser Zab and the Turnat. But, despite  repeated blows inflicted on them, he had not succeeded in welding  these various factors into a compact and homogeneous whole; some small  proportion of them were assimilated to Assyria, and were governed  directly by royal officials,* but the greater number were merely  dependencies, more or less insecurely held by the obligations of  vassalage or servitude. In some provinces the native chiefs were under  the surveillance of Assyrian residents;** these districts paid an annual  tribute proportionate to the resources and products of their country:  thus Kirruri and the neighbouring states contributed horses, mules,  bulls, sheep, wine, and copper vessels; the Aramaeans gold, silver,  lead, copper, both wrought and in the ore, purple, and coloured or  embroidered stuffs; while Izalla, Nirbu, Nirdun, and Bit-Zamani had to  furnish horses, chariots, metals, and cattle.         * There were royal governors in Suru in Bit-Khalupi, in       Matiate, in Madara, and in Nairi.         ** There were \"Assyrian\" residents in Kirruri and the       neighbouring countries, in Kirkhi, and in Nairi.    The less civilised and more distant tribes were not, like these,  subject to regular tribute, but each time the sovereign traversed their  territory or approached within reasonable distance, their chiefs sent  or brought to him valuable presents as fresh pledges of their loyalty.  Royal outposts, built at regular intervals and carefully fortified,  secured the fulfilment of these obligations, and served as depots for  storing the commodities collected by the royal officials; such outposts  were, Damdamusa on the north-west of the Kashiari range, Tushkhan on the  Tigris, Tilluli between the Supnat and the Euphrates, Aribua among the  Patina, and others scattered irregularly between the Greater and Lesser  Zab, on the Khabur, and also in Nairi. These strongholds served as  places of refuge for the residents and their guards in case of a revolt,  and as food-depots for the armies in the event of war bringing them  into their neighbourhood. In addition to these, Assur-nazir-pal also  strengthened the defences of Assyria proper by building fortresses at  the points most open to attack; he repaired or completed the defences of  Kaksi, to command the plain between the Greater and Lesser Zab and the  Tigris; he rebuilt the castles or towers which guarded the river-fords  and the entrances to the valleys of the Gebel Makhlub, and erected at  Calah the fortified palace which his successors continued to inhabit for  the ensuing five hundred years.    Assur-nazir-pal had resided at Nineveh from the time of his accession to  the throne; from thence he had set out on four successive campaigns, and  thither he had returned at the head of his triumphant troops, there he  had received the kings who came to pay him homage, and the governors  who implored his help against foreign attacks; thither he had sent  rebel chiefs, and "]]]
