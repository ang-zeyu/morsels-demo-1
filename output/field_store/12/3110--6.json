If you will have it stronger,  put but four Gallons and a half of water to one of honey.    You may use what Herbs or Roots you please, either for their tast or  vertue, after the manner here set down.    If you make it work with yeast, you must have great care, to draw it into  bottles soon after it hath done working, as after a fortnight or three  weeks. For that will make it soon grow stale, and it will thence grow sower  and dead before you are aware. But if it work singly of itself, and by help  of the Sun without admixtion of either Leaven or Yeast, it may be kept long  in the Barrel, so it be filled up to the top, and kept very close stopp'd.    I conceive it will be exceeding good thus: when you have a strong  Honey-liquor of three parts of water to one of Honey, well-boiled and  scummed, put into it Lukewarm, or better (as soon as you take it from the  fire) some Clove-gilly-flowers, first wiped, and all the whites clipped  off, one good handful or two to every Gallon of Liquor. Let these infuse 30  or 40 hours. Then strain it from the flowers, and either work it with  yeast, or set it in the Sun to work; when it hath almost done working, put  into it a bag of like Gilly-flowers (and if they are duly dried, I think  they are the better) hanging it in at the bung. And if you will put into  it some spirit of wine, that hath drawn a high Tincture from  Clove-gilly-flowers (dried I conceive is best) and some other that hath  done the like from flowers and tops of Rosemary, and some that hath done  the like from Cinnamon and Ginger, I believe it will be much the nobler,  and last the longer.    I conceive, that bitter and strong herbs, as Rosemary, Bayes,  Sweet-marjoram, Thyme, and the like, do conserve Meathe the better and  longer, being as it were in stead of hops. But neither must they, no more  than Clove-gilly-flowers, be too much boiled: For the Volatil pure Spirit  flies away very quickly. Therefore rather infuse them. Beware of infusing  Gillyflower in any vessel of Metal, (excepting silver:) For all Metals will  spoil and dead their colour. Glased earth is best.      SACK WITH CLOVE-GILLY FLOWERS    If you will make a Cordial Liquor of Sack with Clove-gilly-flowers, you  must do thus. Prepare your Gilly-flowers, as is said before, and put them  into great double glass-bottles, that hold two gallons a piece, or more;  and put to every gallon of Sack, a good half pound of the wiped and cut  flowers, putting in the flowers first, and then the Sack upon them. Stop  the glasses exceeding close, and set them in a temperate Cellar. Let them  stand so, till you see that the Sack hath drawn out all the principal  tincture from them, and that the flowers begin to look palish; (with an eye  of pale, or faint in Colour) Then pour the Sack from them, and throw away  the exhausted flowers, or distil a spirit from them; For if you let them  remain longer in the Sack, they will give an earthy tast to them. You may  then put the tincted Sack into fit bottles for your use, stopping them very  close. But if the season of the flowers be not yet past, your Sack will be  better, if you put it upon new flowers, which I conceive will not be the  worse, but peradventure the better, if they be a little dried in the shade.  If you drink a Glass or two of this sack at a meal, you will find it a  great Cordial.    Upon better consideration; I conceive the best way of making Hydromel with  Clove-gilly-flowers, is thus: Boil your simple Liquor to its full height  (with three parts of water to one of Honey), take a small parcel out, to  make a strong infusion of flowers, pouring it boyling hot upon the flowers  in earthen vessels. If you have great quantity, as six to one, of Liquor,  you will easily draw out the tincture in fourteen or sixteen hours  infusion; otherwise you may quicken your liquor with a parcel of Sack. In  the mean time make the great quantity of Liquor work with yest. When it  hath almost done fermenting, but not quite, put the infusion to it warm,  and let it ferment more if it will. When that is almost done, put to it a  bag with flowers to hang in the bung.    I conceive that Hydromel made with Juniper-berries (first broken and  bruised) boiled in it, is very good. Adde also to it Rosemary and  Bay-leaves.    Upon tryal of several ways, I conclude (as things yet appear to me) that to  keep Meath long, it must not be fermented with yest (unless you put Hops  to it) but put it in the barrel, and let it ferment of it self, keeping a  thick plate of lead upon the bung, to lie close upon it, yet so that the  working of the Liquor may raise it, to purge out the foulness, and have  always some new made plain Liquor, to fill it up as it sinks, warm whiles  it works: but cold during three or four month's after. Then stop the bung  exceeding close. And when you will make your Mead with Cherries or  Morello-Cherries, or Raspes, or Bilberries, or Black-cherries, put their  juyce to the Liquor when you tun it, without ever boiling it therein; about  one quart of juyce to every three or four gallons of Liquor. You may  squeese out the clear juyce, and mingle it with the Liquor, and hang the  Magma in a bag in the bung. I think it is best to break the stones of the  Cherries, before you put their Magma into the bag.    Since I conceive, that Clove-gilly-flowers must never be boiled in the  Liquor: that evaporateth their Spirits, which are very volatile: But make a  strong infusion of them, and besides hang a Bag of them in the bung. I  conceive that it is good to make the Liquor pretty strong (not too much,  but so as the taste may be gratefull) of some strong herbs, as Rosemary,  Bay-leaves, Sweet-marjoram, Thyme, Broad-thyme, and the like. For they  preserve the drink, and make it better for the stomack and head. Standing  in the Sun is the best way of Fermentation, when the drink is strong. The  root of Angelica or Elecampane, or Eringo, or Orris, may be good and  pleasant, to be boiled in the Liquor. Raspes and Cherries and Bilberies are  never to be boiled, but their juyce put into the Liquor, when it is  tunning. Use onely Morello-Cherries (I think) for pleasure, and black ones  for health. I conceive it best to use very little spice of any kind in  Meathes.      METHEGLIN COMPOSED BY MY SELF OUT OF SUNDRY RECEIPTS    In sixty Gallons of water, boil ten handfuls of Sweet-bryar-leaves;  Eye-bright, Liverwort, Agrimony, Scabious, Balme, Wood-bettony,  Strawberry-leaves, Burnet, of each four handfuls; of Rosemary, three  handfuls; of Minth, Angelica, Bayes and Wild-thyme, Sweet-Marjoram, of each  two handfuls: Six Eringo-roots. When the water hath taken out the vertue of  the herbs and roots, let it settle, and the next day pour off the clear,  and in every three Gallons of it boil one of honey, scumming it well, and  putting in a little cold water now and then to make the scum rise, as also  some whites of Eggs. When it is clear scummed, take it _off_, and let it  cool; then work it with Ale-yest; tun it up, and hang it in a bag, with  Ginger, Cinamom, Cloves and Cardamom. And as it worketh over, put in some  strong honey-drink warmed. When it works no more, stop it up close.    In twenty Gallons of water boil Sweet-bryar-leaves, Eye-bright, Rosemary,  Bayes, Clove-gilly-flowers of each five handfuls, and four Eringo-roots. To  every two gallons and a half of this decoction, put one gallon of honey;  boil it, &c. When it is tunned up, hang in it a bag containing five  handfuls of Clove-gilly-flowers, and sufficient quantity of the spices  above.    In both these Receipts, the quantity of the herbs is too great. The strong  herbs preserve the drink, and make it nobler. Use Marjoram and Thyme in  little quantity in all.      MY LADY COWERS WHITE MEATHE USED AT SALISBURY    Take to four Gallons of water, one Gallon of Virgin-honey; let the water be  warm before you put in the honey; and then put in the whites of 3 or 4 Eggs  well beaten, to make the scum rise. When the honey is throughly melted and  ready to boil, put in an Egge with the shell softly; and when the Egge  riseth above the water, to the bigness of a groat in sight, it is strong  enough of the honey. The Egge will quickly be hard, and so will not rise;  Therefore you must put in another, if the first do not rise to your sight;  you must put in more water and honey proportionable to the first, because  of wasting away in the boiling. It must boil near an hour. You may, if you  please, boil in it, a little bundle of Rosemary, Sweet-marjoram, and Thyme;  and when it tasteth to your liking, take it forth again. Many do put  Sweet-bryar berries in it, which is held very good. When your Meath is  boiled enough take it off the fire, and put it into a Kiver; when it is  blood-warm, put in some Ale-barm, to make it work, and cover it close with  a blancket in the working. The next morning tun it up, and if you please  put in a bag with a little Ginger and a little Nutmeg bruised; and when it  hath done working, stop it up close for a Moneth, and then Bottle it.      SIR THOMAS GOWER'S METHEGLIN FOR HEALTH    First boil the water and scum it; Then to 12 Gallons put 6 handfuls of  Sweet-bryar-leaves, of Sweet-marjoram, Rosemary, Thyme, of each one a  handful: Flowers of Marigold, Borrage, Bugloss, Sage, each two handfuls.  Boil all together very gently, till a third waste. To eight Gallons of this  put two Gallons of pure honey, and boil them till the Liquor bear an Egge,  the breadth of threepence or a Groat, together with such spices as you like  (bruised, but not beaten) an ounce of all is sufficient.    You must observe carefully. 1. Before you set the Liquor to boil, to cause  a lusty Servant (his Arms well washed) to mix the honey and water together,  labouring it with his hands at least an hour without intermission. 2.

From the Deccan, moreover, their influence  has spread practically all over India and, especially, in the native  States, which have recruited amongst the Chitpavans some of their ablest  public servants. Amongst Chitpavans are to be found many of the most  enlightened and progressive Indians of our times and many have served  the British _Raj_ with unquestioned loyalty and integrity. But amongst  many others--perhaps indeed amongst the great majority--there has  undoubtedly been preserved for the last hundred years from the time of  the downfall of the Peshwa dominion to the present day, an unbroken  tradition of hatred towards British rule, an undying hope that it might  some day be subverted and their own ascendency restored. Not to go back  to the exploits of Nana Sahib, himself a Chitpavan, and his followers  during the Mutiny, or to the Ramoshi rebellion round Poona in 1879, it  was in Poona that the native Press, mainly conducted by Brahmans, first  assumed that tone of virulent hostility towards British rule and British  rulers which led to the Press Act of 1879, and some of the worst  extracts quoted at that time by the Government of India in support of  that measure were taken from Poona newspapers. It was in Poona that some  years later the assassination of two English officials by a young  Chitpavan Brahman was the first outcome of a fresh campaign, leading  directly to political murder. It was by another Chitpavan Brahman that  Mr. Jackson was murdered last December at Nasik; his accomplices were  with one exception Chitpavan Brahmans, and to the same sept of Brahmans  belong nearly all the defendants in the great conspiracy trial now  proceeding at Bombay.    But if there were already, more than 20 years ago, wild and  irreconcilable spirits bent on fomenting disaffection, there were  amongst the Deccanee Brahmans themselves a small intellectual _elite_  who, though by no means servile apologists of British rule, fully  realized that their primary duty was not to stir up popular passion  against alien rulers, but to bring Hindu society into closer communion  with the higher civilization which those rulers, whatever their  shortcomings, undoubtedly represented. Conspicuous amongst such men was  Mahadev Govind Ranade. Equally conspicuous in the opposite camp was a  man of a very different stamp, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, who was destined to  become one of the most dangerous pioneers of disaffection. It was a  Hindu gentleman and a Brahman who told me that if I wanted to study the  psychology of Indian unrest I should begin by studying Tilak's career.  \"Tilak's onslaught in Poona upon Ranade, his alliance with the bigots of  orthodoxy, his appeals to popular superstition in the new Ganpati  celebrations, to racial fanaticism in the 'Anti-Cow-killing Movement,'  to Mahratta sentiment in the cult which he introduced of Shivaji, his  active propaganda amongst schoolboys and students, his gymnastic  societies, his preaching in favour of physical training, and last but  not least his control of the Press and the note of personal violence  which he imparted to newspaper polemics, represent the progressive  stages of a highly-organized campaign which has served as a model to the  apostles of unrest all over India.\" This was a valuable piece of advice,  for, if any one can claim to be truly the father of Indian unrest, it is  Bal Gangadhar Tilak. The story of his initial campaign in the Deccan,  though it dates back to the closing decades of the last century, is  still well worth studying, and has, in fact, never received adequate  attention, for on the one hand it pricks the shallow view that Indian  unrest is merely an echo of the Japanese victories in Manchuria, and, on  the other hand, it illustrates clearly the close connexion that exists  between the forces of Indian political disaffection and those of social  and religious reaction, whilst the methods which he employed and the  results which attended his activity have been reproduced with singular  fidelity in subsequent phases of the movement.    When Tilak entered upon public life in the early eighties, the Brahmans  of the Deccan were divided into two camps, one of which, headed at first  by the late Mr. Justice Ranade, consisted of a small intellectual  _elite_, who held, without forgoing their right to criticize British  administrators or to promote political reforms by constitutional  methods, that Indians of all creeds, including the Hindus, should begin  by reforming their own social institutions, and bring them into greater  harmony with Western standards. Tilak, a Chitpavan Brahman of  considerable erudition, who had graduated with honours at Bombay, had,  however, inherited his full share of Chitpavan hostility to British  ascendency. He was also by temperament and ambition impatient of all  restraint, and jealous of the commanding authority which a man like  Ranade owed quite as much to the nobility of his character as to his  social position and force of intellect. In opposition to Ranade, with  whom he had at first co-operated as an educationist, Tilak drifted  rapidly into the reactionary camp. The battle was first engaged over the  control of the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha and the Education Society, two  progressive associations which, though mainly composed of Brahmans,  included a sprinkling of Mahomedans and of non-Brahman Hindus. Tilak had  thrown himself into journalism, and after the repeal of the Indian Press  Law on the return of a Liberal Administration to office at home in 1881,  he had been amongst the first to revive the incendiary methods which it  had temporarily and very successfully checked. His first onslaught upon  Ranade's position, however, failed, and instead of supplanting him, it  was he who was compelled in 1890 to sever his connexion with the  Education Society.    Tilak's defeat was short lived. The introduction of the Age of Consent  Bill, in 1890, to mitigate the evils of Hindu child-marriage, gave him a  fresh opening. Ranade, discouraged and alarmed by the violence of the  Tilak party, had by this time retired from the forefront of the fray,  but in Dr. Bhandarkar, Mr. Justice Tilang, Mr. A.K. Nulkar, Mr. (now Sir  N.G.) Chandavarkar, and other courageous Hindu reformers, with whom Mr.  Gokhale was always ready to co-operate against the forces of religious  superstition, he had left disciples ready to carry on the good fight.  Tilak raised against them a storm of passion and prejudice. In the  columns of the _Kesari_, of which he had become sole proprietor, he  denounced every Hindu who supported the measure as a renegade and a  traitor to the cause of Hinduism, and thus won the support of  conservative orthodoxy, which had hitherto viewed with alarm some of his  literary excursions into the field of Vedantic exegesis. With the help  of the brothers Natu, who were the recognized leaders of Hindu  orthodoxy, he carried his propaganda into the schools and colleges in  the teeth of the Moderate party, and, proclaiming that unless they  learnt to employ force the Hindus must expect to be impotent witnesses  of the gradual downfall of all their ancient institutions, he proceeded  to organize gymnastic societies in which physical training and the use  of more or less primitive weapons were taught in order to develop the  martial instincts of the rising generation.    If amongst many Brahmans of Maharashtra hatred of the British is the  dominant passion, amongst the Mahratta population at large whatever  there is of racial and religious jealousy is mainly directed against the  Mahomedans. This is partly, no doubt, a legacy of the old days of  Mahomedan supremacy. In 1893 some riots in Bombay of a more severe  character than usual gave Tilak an opportunity of broadening the new  movement by enlisting in its support the old anti-Mahomedan feeling of  the people. He not only convoked popular meetings in which his fiery  eloquence denounced the Mahomedans as the sworn foes of Hinduism, but he  started an organization known as the \"Anti-Cow-Killing Society,\" which  was intended and regarded as a direct provocation to the Mahomedans,  who, like ourselves, think it no sacrilege to eat beef. In vain did  liberal Hindus appeal to him to desist from these inflammatory methods.  Their appeals had no effect upon him, and merely served his purpose by  undermining the little authority they still possessed. Government had  forbidden Hindu processions to play music whilst passing in front of  Mahomedan mosques, as this was a fertile cause of riotous affrays. Tilak  not only himself protested against this \"interference with the liberties  of the people,\" but insisted that the Sarvajanik Sabha should identify  itself with the \"national\" cause and memorialize Government for the  removal of a prohibition so offensive to Hindu sentiment. The Moderates  hesitated, but were overawed by popular clamour and the threats of the  Tilak Press. The Mahomedans and a few other members repudiated the  memorial and resigned. Tilak, though not yet in absolute control of the  Sabha, became already practically its master. No one knew better than he  how to compel submission by packed meetings and organized rowdyism.    Tilak's propaganda had at the same time steadily assumed a more and more  anti-British character, and it was always as the allies and the tools of  Government, in its machinations against Hinduism, that the Hindu  reformers and the Mahomedans had in turn been denounced. In order to  invest it with a more definitely religious sanction, Tilak placed it  under the special patronage of the most popular deity in India. Though  Ganesh, the elephant-headed god, is the god of learning whom Hindu  writers delight to invoke on the title-page of their books, there is  scarcely a village or a frequented roadside in India that does not show  some rude presentment of his familiar features, usually smeared over  with "]]]
