And so life's shifting scenes came fast to Rupert Ames; and they were  mostly scenes of dreariness and trial; but he did not altogether give  up. Many of his friends were his friends still, and he could have  drowned his sorrow in the social whirl; but he preferred to sit at home  during the long winter evenings, beside his fire and shaded lamp, and  forget himself in his books. He seemed to be drifting away from his  former life, into a strange world of his own. He lost all interest in  his surroundings. To him, the world was getting empty and barren and  cold.    The former beautiful valley was a prison. The hills in which his boyhood  had been spent lost all their loveliness. How foolish, anyway, he began  to think, to always live in a narrow valley, and never know anything of  the broad world without. Surely the soul will grow small in such  conditions.    Early that spring, Rupert packed his possessions in a bundle which he  tied behind the saddle on his horse and bade good-bye to his friends.    \"Where are you going, Rupe?\" they asked.    But his answer was always, \"I don't know.\"          VIII.      \"No chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous:    nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of    righteousness unto them that are exercised    thereby.\"--_Heb. 12:11_.      Rupert Ames had ridden all day, resting only at noon to permit his horse  to graze. As for himself, he was not tired. The long pent-up energy had  begun to escape, and it seemed that he could have ridden, or walked, or  in any way worked hard for a long time without need of rest. Move, move  he must. He had been dormant long enough; thinking, thinking, nothing  but that for months. It would have driven him mad had he not made a  change. Where was he going? No one knew; Rupert himself did not know;  anywhere for a change; anywhere to get away, for a time, from the scenes  and remembrances of the valley and town of Willowby.    At dark he rode into a village at the mouth of a gorge. Lights gleamed  from the windows. A strong breeze came from the gorge, and the trees  which lined the one stony street all leaned away from the mountain.  Rupert had never been in the place before, but he had heard of Windtown.  Was there a hotel? he asked a passer-by. No; but they took lodgers at  Smith's, up the hill. At Smith's he, therefore, put up his horse and  secured supper and bed. Until late at night he walked up and down  Windtown's one street, and even climbed the cliffs above the town.    Next morning he was out early, and entered the canyon as the sun began  to illumine its rocky domes and cast long shafts of light across the  chasm. A summer morning ride through a canyon of the Rockies is always  an inspiration, but Rupert was not conscious of it. Again, at noon, he  fed his horse a bag of grain, and let him crop the scanty bunch-grass on  the narrow hillside. A slice of bread from his pocket, dipped into the  clear stream, was his own meal. Then, out of the canyon, and up the  mountain, and over the divide he went. All that afternoon he rode over a  stretch of sagebrush plain. It was nearly midnight when he stopped at a  mining camp. In the morning he sold his horse for three twenty-dollar  gold pieces, and with his bundle on his back, walked to the railroad  station, a distance of seven miles.    \"I want a ticket,\" said he to the man at the little glass window.    \"Where to?\"    \"To--to--well, to Chicago.\"    The man looked suspiciously at Rupert, and then turned to a card hanging  on the wall.    \"Twenty-eight-fifty,\" he said.    Two of the gold pieces were shoved under the glass, and Rupert received  his ticket and his change.    In the car, he secured a seat near the window that he might see the  country. It was the same familiar mountains and streams all that day,  but the next morning when he awoke and looked out of the car windows, a  strange sight met his gaze. In every direction, as far as he could see,  stretched the level prairie, over which the train sped in straight lines  for miles and miles. \"We must be in Kansas,\" he thought. \"What a sight,  to see so much level land.\"    But what was he going to do in Chicago? To see the world, to mingle in  the crowd, to jostle with his fellow-beings--what else, he did not know.    Chicago! What a sight to the man of the mountains! Streets, houses,  people and the continuous din and traffic of the city nearly turned his  head for a time. What an ideal place in which to lose one's self. Rupert  had a bundle no longer, but in his pocket just fifteen dollars and ten  cents. He kept well out of the clutches of the sharpers in the city,  and lived quite comfortably for a week, seeing the sights of the  wonderful city. Then, when his money was getting low, he tried to get  work, as he wished to remain longer. But Rupert was a farmer, and they  were not in demand within the city limits. Outside the city, Rupert fell  in with a body of travelers who were going West--walking, and riding on  the trains when they had a chance. He joined them. Somehow, he had  ceased to consider what his doings might lead to, and as for misgivings  as to the company he was keeping, that did not trouble him. For many  days there was more walking than riding. Rupert was not expert at  swinging himself under the cars and hanging to the brakebeams, so he  traveled with the more easy-going element, who slept in the haylofts at  night and got what food they could from farmhouses, though Rupert  hoarded his little store of money and usually paid for what he got. Then  he lost all track of time. It must have been far into the summer when  Rupert separated from his companions, and found himself at the base of  the mountains. Here he spent his last cent for a loaf of bread.    That night Rupert felt a fever burning within him, and in the morning he  was too weak to travel. He, therefore, lay in the hay which had served  him for a bed until the sun shone in upon him; then he again tried to  get out, but he trembled so that he crawled back into the loft and there  lay the whole day. Towards evening he was driven out by the owner of the  barn. Rupert staggered along until he came to another hayloft, which he  succeeded in reaching without being seen. All that night he tossed in  fever and suffered from the pains which racked his body. The next day a  farmer found him, and seeing his condition, brought him some food. Then  on he went again. His mind was now in a daze. Sometimes the mountains,  the houses, and the fences became so jumbled together that he could not  distinguish one from the other. Was he losing his mind? Or was it but  the fever? Was the end coming?--and far from home, too--Home?--he had no  home. One place was as good as another to him. He had no distinct  recollection how he got to the usual hayloft, nor how long he lay there.  It was one confused mass of pains and dreams and fantastic shapes. Then  the fever must have burned out, for he awoke one night with a clear  brain. Then he slept again.    On awakening next morning and crawling out, he saw the sun shining on  the snow-tipped peaks of the mountains. He had dreamed during the night  of his mother and Virginia and Nina, and the dream had impressed him  deeply. His haggard face was covered with a short beard; his clothes  were dirty, and some rents were getting large. Yes, he had reached the  bottom. He could go no further. He was a tramp--a dirty tramp. He had  got to the end of his rope. He would reach the mountains which he still  loved, and there on some cliff he would lie down and die. He would do  it--would do it!    All that day he walked. He asked not for food. He wanted nothing from  any man. Alone he had come into the world, alone he would leave it. His  face was set and hard. Up the mountain road he went, past farmhouse and  village, up, farther up, until he reached a valley that looked like one  he knew, but there was no town there, nothing but a level stretch of  bench-land and a stream coursing down the lower part of the valley.  Groves of pines extended over the foothills up towards the peaks. Up  there he would go. Under the pines his bones would lie and bleach.    He left the wagon road, and followed a trail up the side of the hill.  The sun was nearing the white mountain peaks. An autumn haze hung over  the valley and made the distance dim and blue. The odor from the trees  greeted him, and recalled memories of the time when, full of life and  hope, he had roamed his native pine-clad hills. He was nearing home,  anyway. The preacher had said that dying was only going home. If there  was a hereafter, it could be no worse than the present; and if death  ended all, well, his bones would rest in peace in this lone place. The  wolf and the coyote might devour his flesh--let them--and their night  howl would be his funeral dirge.    Far up, he went into the deepest of the forest. The noise of falling  waters came to him as a distant hymn. He sat on the ground to rest,  before he made his last climb. Mechanically, he took from his pocket a  small book, his testament--his sole remaining bit of property. He opened  it, and his eyes fell on some lines which he had penciled on the margin,  seemingly, years and years ago. They ran as follows:      \"'Tis sorrow builds the shining ladder up,    Whose golden rounds are our calamities.\"    And the passages to which they pointed read:      \"My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord, nor faint    when thou art rebuked of him; for whom the Lord loveth he    chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. If ye    receive chastenings, God dealeth with you as with sons, for what    son is he whom the father chasteneth not?\"    The book dropped from the reader's trembling grasp. It was then that the  Angel of Mercy said, \"It is enough,\" and touched the young man's heart.  The long pent-up spring burst forth, and Rupert sobbed like a child.

So it was that, year after year, we sent a good round gift to those  barbarians. You know our Government is often slow in meeting its  obligations, and it happened now and then we were late in sending our  tribute to the swarthy rulers. When that occurred, the Dey, or Bashaw,  imposed a heavy fine to remind us of the expense of trifling with him.  We meekly bowed our heads, paid it, and tried to be more prompt  afterward. Then, too, the mighty ruler sometimes expressed a wish to  receive naval stores instead of money, and we were happy to oblige him.  Of course, he set his own valuation on what he received, which was  generally about one-half of what they cost our Government, but we made  no complaint.    It came about that the Dey of Tripoli got the idea into his head that we  were not paying him as much as we did his neighbors. In his impatience,  he decided to give us a lesson as badly needed as it was in the case of  France, to which I have alluded. So he declared war against the United  States. It would be interesting to know what ideas the Dey had of the  Republic on the other side of the Atlantic.    One good thing resulted from our flurry with France. A number of good  ships had been added to our navy. Better still, many young officers,  brave, skilful and glowing with patriotic ardor, were serving on those  ships. They eagerly welcomed the chance of winning glory. To them the  war with Tripoli offered the very opportunity for which they longed.    Among these was William Bainbridge, who was born in 1774 and died in  1833. He began life as a sailor at the age of fifteen, and was in  several engagements before he was appointed to the navy in 1798, during  our war with France.    Another was Stephen Decatur, born in Maryland in 1779 and killed in a  duel with Commodore Barron in 1820. His father was a gallant officer in  the Revolution, and his two sons were among the bravest officers who  ever trod the quarter deck. Both entered the service in 1798, and  Stephen is generally regarded as the best type of the young American  naval officer during the early years of the present century.    Still another was Charles Stewart, born in Philadelphia in 1778, and,  like those whom I have named, he entered the navy as lieutenant in 1798.  It will always be one of my pleasantest recollections that I was well  acquainted with Stewart, and spent many hours talking with him about the  stirring scenes in which he took part. He lived to be more than ninety  years of age, dying in 1869, and for a good many years occupied a modest  little home, just below Bordentown, New Jersey. When eighty-eight years  old he was as active as a man of half his years. I came upon him one  wintry day, when he was of that age, and found him in the barn,  shoveling corn into a hopper, of which a sturdy Irishman was turning the  crank. The old admiral kept his hired man busy and enjoyed his own work.  He was of small figure, always wore an old-fashioned blue swallow-tail  with brass buttons, took snuff, and would laugh and shake until his  weatherbeaten face was purple over some of his reminiscences of the  early days of the Republic.    Think of it! He remembered seeing Benedict Arnold burned in effigy in  Philadelphia in 1781; he recalled Paul Jones, and had drunk wine and  talked with Washington.    Stewart and Decatur were of about the same age, and attended the old  Academy in Philadelphia. They were bosom friends from boyhood. Stewart  told me that Decatur was a good student, but there was hardly a boy in  the school, anywhere near his own age, with whom he did not have a  fight. He would \"rather fight than eat,\" but he was not a bully, and  never imposed upon any one younger or weaker than himself.    A great many of my talks with old Admiral Stewart related to the war  with Tripoli, which began in 1801 and lasted nearly four years. As you  will learn, Stewart had a great deal to do with that war, and most of  the incidents that follow were told to me by him, a fact which insures  their truthfulness and interest.    Among others to whom I shall refer was Commodore Richard Dale, who was  born in 1756, and died in 1826. He was older, as you will notice, than  the three whom I have mentioned. As to his bravery, it is enough to say  that he was first lieutenant on the _Bonhomme Richard_ during her  terrible fight under Paul Jones with the _Serapis_, and served with  that wonderful naval hero on the _Alliance_ and the _Ariel_. Had he not  been made of the right stuff he never could have held such a position  when a very young man.    [Illustration: COMMODORE EDWARD PREBLE.]    Another hero was Commodore Edward Preble, born in 1761 and died in 1807.  When only sixteen years old he joined a privateer, and at eighteen was  active in the attacks of the _Protector_ on the British privateer  _Admiral Duff_. He was on the _Winthrop_, and fought bravely in the  battle which resulted in the capture of a British armed brig. He was  commissioned lieutenant in 1798, and the year following commanded the  _Essex_.    From what I have told you, it will be seen that it was a gallant band  that our Government sent into the Mediterranean in 1801 to chastise the  barbarians and compel them to respect the Stars and Stripes.          CHAPTER VIII.    The First Serious Engagement--Loss of the Philadelphia--The Scheme of  Captain Bainbridge--Exploit of Lieutenant Decatur.      Andrew Sterrett was executive officer of the _Constellation_, which  captured the French frigate _L'Insurgente_, in 1799, and _La Vengeance_,  in 1800. It fell to his lot, while in command of the _Enterprise_, a  vessel of 12 guns, to have the first serious fight in the war with  Tripoli. When off Malta, he met a Tripolitan vessel of 14 guns, and they  fought furiously for two hours, at the end of which time the enemy  hauled down his flag. The Americans left their guns and broke into  cheers, whereupon the Tripolitan fired a broadside. Nothing loath,  Lieutenant Sterrett resumed the battle. The Tripolitans ran in close and  attempted to board, but were repulsed, and, under the fierce fire of the  _Enterprise_, they again hauled down their flag.    \"I guess they mean it this time,\" remarked Lieutenant Sterrett, but the  words were hardly spoken when the enemy let fly with another broadside.    As may be supposed, this exhausted the patience of the American  commander. He ordered his men to their guns, and mentally resolved to  finish the job without fail. Circling round his antagonist, he raked her  from stem to stern, shot away the mizzen mast, made a sieve of the hull  and killed and wounded fifty men. He was still at it, when, through the  smoke, he caught sight of the swarthy captain, leaping up and down on  the deck, swinging his arms and shrieking in broken English that he had  surrendered. To show he was in earnest, he flung his colors overboard.    \"Now throw your guns and powder after your flag,\" shouted Sterrett.    He was promptly obeyed; and, resolved to take no chances, Sterrett then  compelled him to cut away his masts, after which he was permitted to rig  a jury mast and a single sail.    \"Now go home to your Dey,\" said his conqueror, \"and give him my  compliments.\"    Not a man was killed on board the _Enterprise_, though, as has been  shown, the loss of the enemy was severe.    [Illustration: CAPTAIN WILLIAM BAINBRIDGE.]    The American squadron in that part of the world was increased, and a  number of engagements took place, with the advantage invariably on the  side of our countrymen. By the opening of 1803 there were nine of our  ships, carrying two hundred and fourteen guns, in the Mediterranean  waters. The fine frigate _Philadelphia_ captured a Moorish cruiser upon  which were found papers signed by the Governor of Tangier authorizing  the commander to destroy American commerce. Commodore Preble sailed into  the harbor and demanded an explanation of the emperor. He denied having  given any such authority to his subordinate, and in making his denial  undoubtedly told a falsehood. Nevertheless, he was so scared that he  signed anew the treaty of 1786, deprived the governor of his commission  and confiscated his estates.    Captain William Bainbridge was in command of the _Philadelphia_, and was  detailed to help in blockading Tripoli. His companion vessel was sent in  pursuit of a corsair, so that the _Philadelphia_ was left alone to  perform blockade duty. On the last day of October, 1803, Captain  Bainbridge observed a Tripolitan vessel trying to make port. He gave  chase, but the coast was dangerous, abounding with shoals and reefs,  with which the fugitive vessel was familiar, while Captain Bainbridge  had to keep sounding and regulating his speed in accordance with the  degree of danger.    In the midst of the pursuit, and while every precaution was taken, the  crew, to their dismay, heard a dull, grating sound, whose meaning they  well knew; the bow of the frigate rose six feet out of the water, and  the stoppage was so sudden that nearly every one was thrown off his  feet.    A hurried examination showed that the _Philadelphia_ was inextricably  fast, and could not be freed until the tide rose. Meanwhile the corsairs  would issue from the harbor near at hand, and, choosing their own  position, batter the frigate to pieces and kill or make prisoners of the  crew.    Every possible effort was made to release the ship, but she was too  firmly spiked on the jagged reef to be budged, and the dreaded peril  speedily appeared. The Tripolitans soon discovered the plight of the  American, and nine gunboats hurried out from the harbor. Fire was opened  on"]]]
