Also he removed the other pot from the fire, leaving it,  however, quite close.    \"Well, all eyes?\" he bantered, suddenly staring at her. \"Didn't I say  I'd surprise you?\"    \"Don't mind me. This is about the happiest and most bewildered  moment--of my life,\" replied Carley.    Returning to the table, Glenn dug at something in a large red can. He  paused a moment to eye Carley.    \"Girl, do you know how to make biscuits?\" he queried.    \"I might have known in my school days, but I've forgotten,\" she replied.    \"Can you make apple pie?\" he demanded, imperiously.    \"No,\" rejoined Carley.    \"How do you expect to please your husband?\"    \"Why--by marrying him, I suppose,\" answered Carley, as if weighing a  problem.    \"That has been the universal feminine point of view for a good many  years,\" replied Glenn, flourishing a flour-whitened hand. \"But it never  served the women of the Revolution or the pioneers. And they were the  builders of the nation. It will never serve the wives of the future, if  we are to survive.\"    \"Glenn, you rave!\" ejaculated Carley, not knowing whether to laugh or be  grave. \"You were talking of humble housewifely things.\"    \"Precisely. The humble things that were the foundation of the great  nation of Americans. I meant work and children.\"    Carley could only stare at him. The look he flashed at her, the sudden  intensity and passion of his ringing words, were as if he gave her a  glimpse into the very depths of him. He might have begun in fun, but he  had finished otherwise. She felt that she really did not know this  man. Had he arraigned her in judgment? A flush, seemingly hot and cold,  passed over her. Then it relieved her to see that he had returned to his  task.    He mixed the shortening with the flour, and, adding water, he began  a thorough kneading. When the consistency of the mixture appeared to  satisfy him he took a handful of it, rolled it into a ball, patted and  flattened it into a biscuit, and dropped it into the oven he had set  aside on the hot coals. Swiftly he shaped eight or ten other biscuits  and dropped them as the first. Then he put the heavy iron lid on the  pot, and with a rude shovel, improvised from a flattened tin can, he  shoveled red coals out of the fire, and covered the lid with them. His  next move was to pare and slice potatoes, placing these aside in a pan.  A small black coffee-pot half full of water, was set on a glowing  part of the fire. Then he brought into use a huge, heavy knife, a  murderous-looking implement it appeared to Carley, with which he cut  slices of ham. These he dropped into the second pot, which he left  uncovered. Next he removed the flour sack and other inpedimenta from the  table, and proceeded to set places for two--blue-enamel plate and cup,  with plain, substantial-looking knives, forks, and spoons. He went  outside, to return presently carrying a small crock of butter. Evidently  he had kept the butter in or near the spring. It looked dewy and cold  and hard. After that he peeped under the lid of the pot which contained  the biscuits. The other pot was sizzling and smoking, giving forth  a delicious savory odor that affected Carley most agreeably. The  coffee-pot had begun to steam. With a long fork Glenn turned the slices  of ham and stood a moment watching them. Next he placed cans of three  sizes upon the table; and these Carley conjectured contained sugar,  salt, and pepper. Carley might not have been present, for all the  attention he paid to her. Again he peeped at the biscuits. At the  edge of the hot embers he placed a tin plate, upon which he carefully  deposited the slices of ham. Carley had not needed sight of them to know  she was hungry; they made her simply ravenous. That done, he poured the  pan of sliced potatoes into the pot. Carley judged the heat of that  pot to be extreme. Next he removed the lid from the other pot, exposing  biscuits slightly browned; and evidently satisfied with these, he  removed them from the coals. He stirred the slices of potatoes round  and round; he emptied two heaping tablespoonfuls of coffee into the  coffee-pot.    \"Carley,\" he said, at last turning to her with a warm smile, \"out here  in the West the cook usually yells, 'Come and get it.' Draw up your  stool.\"    And presently Carley found herself seated across the crude table from  Glenn, with the background of chinked logs in her sight, and the smart  of wood smoke in her eyes. In years past she had sat with him in the  soft, subdued, gold-green shadows of the Astor, or in the sumptuous  atmosphere of the St. Regis. But this event was so different, so  striking, that she felt it would have limitless significance. For one  thing, the look of Glenn! When had he ever seemed like this, wonderfully  happy to have her there, consciously proud of this dinner he had  prepared in half an hour, strangely studying her as one on trial? This  might have had its effect upon Carley's reaction to the situation,  making it sweet, trenchant with meaning, but she was hungry enough and  the dinner was good enough to make this hour memorable on that score  alone. She ate until she was actually ashamed of herself. She laughed  heartily, she talked, she made love to Glenn. Then suddenly an idea  flashed into her quick mind.    \"Glenn, did this girl Flo teach you to cook?\" she queried, sharply.    \"No. I always was handy in camp. Then out here I had the luck to fall  in with an old fellow who was a wonderful cook. He lived with me for a  while. ... Why, what difference would it have made--had Flo taught me?\"    Carley felt the heat of blood in her face. \"I don't know that it would  have made a difference. Only--I'm glad she didn't teach you. I'd rather  no girl could teach you what I couldn't.\"    \"You think I'm a pretty good cook, then?\" he asked.    \"I've enjoyed this dinner more than any I've ever eaten.\"    \"Thanks, Carley. That'll help a lot,\" he said, gayly, but his eyes shone  with earnest, glad light. \"I hoped I'd surprise you. I've found out here  that I want to do things well. The West stirs something in a man. It  must be an unwritten law. You stand or fall by your own hands. Back East  you know meals are just occasions--to hurry through--to dress for--to  meet somebody--to eat because you have to eat. But out here they are  different. I don't know how. In the city, producers, merchants, waiters  serve you for money. The meal is a transaction. It has no significance.  It is money that keeps you from starvation. But in the West money  doesn't mean much. You must work to live.\"    Carley leaned her elbows on the table and gazed at him curiously and  admiringly. \"Old fellow, you're a wonder. I can't tell you how proud I  am of you. That you could come West weak and sick, and fight your way to  health, and learn to be self-sufficient! It is a splendid achievement.  It amazes me. I don't grasp it. I want to think. Nevertheless I--\"    \"What?\" he queried, as she hesitated.    \"Oh, never mind now,\" she replied, hastily, averting her eyes.      The day was far spent when Carley returned to the Lodge--and in spite of  the discomfort of cold and sleet, and the bitter wind that beat in her  face as she struggled up the trail--it was a day never to be forgotten.  Nothing had been wanting in Glenn's attention or affection. He had been  comrade, lover, all she craved for. And but for his few singular words  about work and children there had been no serious talk. Only a play day  in his canyon and his cabin! Yet had she appeared at her best? Something  vague and perplexing knocked at the gate of her consciousness.        CHAPTER IV    Two warm sunny days in early May inclined Mr. Hutter to the opinion that  pleasant spring weather was at hand and that it would be a propitious  time to climb up on the desert to look after his sheep interests. Glenn,  of course, would accompany him.    \"Carley and I will go too,\" asserted Flo.    \"Reckon that'll be good,\" said Hutter, with approving nod.    His wife also agreed that it would be fine for Carley to see the  beautiful desert country round Sunset Peak. But Glenn looked dubious.    \"Carley, it'll be rather hard,\" he said. \"You're soft, and riding and  lying out will stove you up. You ought to break in gradually.\"    \"I rode ten miles today,\" rejoined Carley. \"And didn't mind it--much.\"  This was a little deviation from stern veracity.    \"Shore Carley's well and strong,\" protested Flo. \"She'll get sore, but  that won't kill her.\"    Glenn eyed Flo with rather penetrating glance. \"I might drive Carley  round about in the car,\" he said.    \"But you can't drive over those lava flats, or go round, either. We'd  have to send horses in some cases miles to meet you. It's horseback if  you go at all.\"    \"Shore we'll go horseback,\" spoke up Flo. \"Carley has got it all over  that Spencer girl who was here last summer.\"    \"I think so, too. I am sure I hope so. Because you remember what the  ride to Long Valley did to Miss Spencer,\" rejoined Glenn.    \"What?\" inquired Carley.    \"Bad cold, peeled nose, skinned shin, saddle sores. She was in bed two  days. She didn't show much pep the rest of her stay here, and she never  got on another horse.\"    \"Oh, is that all, Glenn?\" returned Carley, in feigned surprise. \"Why,  I imagined from your tone that Miss Spencer's ride must have occasioned  her discomfort.... See here, Glenn. I may be a tenderfoot, but I'm no  mollycoddle.\"    \"My dear, I surrender,\" replied Glenn, with a laugh. \"Really, I'm  delighted. But if anything happens--don't you blame me. I'm quite sure  that a long horseback ride, in spring, on the desert, will show you a  good many things about yourself.\"    That was how Carley came to find herself, the afternoon of the next day,  astride a self-willed and unmanageable little mustang, riding in the  rear of her friends, on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18828"],[0,"Selections From the Writings of the Báb (#11)"],[1,"God, inasmuch  as ye have strayed in error far from the Truth. Verily We have taken a  covenant from every created thing upon its coming into being concerning  the Remembrance of God, and there shall be none to avert the binding  command of God for the purification of mankind, as ordained in the Book  which is written by the hand of the Bab. _Chapter LXVIII._          \"The people, during the absence of the Bab, re-enacted ...\"      The people, during the absence of the Bab, re-enacted the episode of the  Calf by setting up a blaring figure which embodied animal features in  human form(45) ...    Whenever the people ask Thee of the appointed Hour say: Verily the  knowledge of it is only with My Lord,(46) Who is the Knower of the unseen.  There is none other God but Him--He Who hath created you from a single  soul,(47) and I have no control over what profiteth Me or harmeth Me, but  as My Lord pleaseth.(48) Indeed God is Self-Sufficient and He, My Lord,  standeth supreme over all things. _Chapter LXIX._          \"Doth it seem strange to the people that We should have ...\"      Doth it seem strange to the people that We should have revealed the Book  to a man from among themselves in order to purge them and give them the  good tidings that they shall be rewarded with a sure stance in the  presence of their Lord? He indeed beareth witness unto all things...    When the verses of this Book are recited to the infidels they say: 'Give  us a book like the Qur'an and make changes in the verses.' Say: 'God hath  not given Me that I should change them at My pleasure.' I follow only what  is revealed unto Me. Verily, I shall fear My Lord on the Day of  Separation, whose advent He hath, in very truth, irrevocably ordained.(49)  _Chapter LXXI._          \"O Peoples of the earth! Verily the true God calleth ...\"      O Peoples of the earth! Verily the true God calleth saying: He Who is the  Remembrance is indeed the sovereign Truth from God, and naught remaineth  beyond truth but error,(50) and naught is there beyond error save fire,  irrevocably ordained...    O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Point to Thy truthful breast through the power of truth  and exclaim: I swear by the One true God, herein lieth the vicegerency of  God; I am indeed the One Who is regarded as the Best Reward(51) and I am  indeed He Who is the Most Excellent Abode. _Chapter LXXII._          \"O ye concourse of the believers! Utter not words of ...\"      O ye concourse of the believers! Utter not words of denial against Me once  the Truth is made manifest, for indeed the mandate of the Bab hath  befittingly been proclaimed unto you in the Qur'an aforetime. I swear by  your Lord, this Book is verily the same Qur'an which was sent down in the  past. _Chapter LXXXI._          \"O Thou cherished Fruit of the heart! Give ear to the ...\"      O Thou cherished Fruit of the heart! Give ear to the melodies of this  mystic Bird warbling in the loftiest heights of heaven. The Lord hath, in  truth, inspired Me to proclaim: Verily, verily, I am God, He besides Whom  there is none other God. He is the Almighty, the All-Wise.    O My servants! Seek ye earnestly this highest reward, as I have indeed  created for the Remembrance of God gardens which remain inscrutable to  anyone save Myself, and naught therein hath been made lawful unto anyone  except those whose lives have been sacrificed in His Path. Hence beseech  ye God, the Most Exalted, that He may grant you this meritorious reward,  and He is in truth the Most High, the Most Great. Had it been Our wish, We  would have brought all men into one fold round Our Remembrance, yet they  will not cease to differ,(52) unless God accomplish what He willeth  through the power of truth. In the estimation of the Remembrance this  commandment hath, in very truth, been irrevocably ordained...    God hath indeed chosen Thee to warn the people, to guide the believers  aright and to elucidate the secrets of the Book. _Chapter LXXXV._          \"Should it be Our wish, it is in Our power to compel, ...\"      Should it be Our wish, it is in Our power to compel, through the agency of  but one letter of Our Revelation, the world and all that is therein to  recognize, in less than the twinkling of an eye, the truth of Our  Cause....    Truly other apostles have been laughed to scorn before Thee,(53) and Thou  art none other but the Servant of God, sustained by the power of Truth.  Ere long We shall prolong the days of such as have rejected the Truth by  reason of that which their hands have wrought,(54) and verily God will not  deal unjustly with anyone, even to the extent of a speck on a date-stone.  _Chapter LXXXVII._          \"O ye peoples of the earth! By the righteousness of God, ...\"      O ye peoples of the earth! By the righteousness of God, the True One, the  testimony shown forth by His Remembrance is like unto a sun which the hand  of the merciful Lord hath raised high in the midmost heart of the heaven,  wherefrom it shineth in the plenitude of its meridian splendour...    With each and every Prophet Whom We have sent down in the past, We have  established a separate Covenant concerning the Remembrance of God and His  Day. Manifest, in the realm of glory and through the power of truth, are  the Remembrance of God and His Day before the eyes of the angels that  circle His mercy-seat. _Chapter XCI._          \"O Hour of the Dawn! Ere the resplendent glory of the ...\"      O Hour of the Dawn! Ere the resplendent glory of the divine Luminary  sheddeth its radiance from the Dayspring of this Gate, call thou to mind  that the appointed Day of God will indeed be at hand in less than the  twinkling of an eye. Thus hath the decree of God been issued in the Mother  Book. _Chapter XCIV._          \"O Concourse of the faithful! Verily the object of each ...\"      O Concourse of the faithful! Verily the object of each and every sign  revealed by God in the Scriptures or in the world at large or in the  hearts of men is but to make them fully realize that this Remembrance is  indeed the True One from God. Verily God is cognizant of all things  through the power of eternal Truth...    O ye that circle the throne of glory! Hearken unto My Call which is raised  from the midst of the Burning Bush, 'Verily I am God and there is none  other God but Me. Hence worship Me, and for the sake of Him Who is the  Most Great Remembrance, offer ye prayers, purged from the insinuations of  the people, for verily your Lord, the One true God, is none other than the  Sovereign Truth. Indeed such as invoke others besides Him are deservedly  numbered among the inmates of the fire, while He Who is the Remembrance of  God verily abideth, firm and undeviating, on the Path of Truth amidst the  Burning Bush.'...    O peoples of the earth! Inflict not upon the Most Great Remembrance what  the Umayyads cruelly inflicted upon Husayn in the Holy Land. By the  righteousness of God, the True One, He is indeed the Eternal Truth, and  unto Him God, verily, is a witness. _Chapter XVII._          \"God had, in truth, proposed Our Mission unto the ...\"      God had, in truth, proposed Our Mission unto the heavens and the earth and  the mountains, but they refused to bear it and were afraid thereof.  However, Man, this 'Ali, Who is none other but the Great Remembrance of  God, undertook to bear it. Hence God, the All-Encompassing, hath referred  to Him in His Preserved Book as the 'Wronged One', and by reason of His  being undistinguished before the eyes of men, He hath, according to the  judgement of the Book, been entitled 'the Unknown'...(55)    Erelong We will, in very truth, torment such as waged war against Husayn  [Imam Husayn], in the Land of the Euphrates, with the most afflictive  torment, and the most dire and exemplary punishment....    God knoweth well the heart of Husayn, the heat of His burning thirst and  His long-suffering for the sake of God, the Incomparable, the Ancient of  Days; and unto Him God is verily a witness. _Chapter XII._          \"Hearken unto the Voice of Thy Lord calling from ...\"      Hearken unto the Voice of Thy Lord calling from Mount Sinai, 'Verily there  is no God but Him, and I am the Most Exalted One Who hath been veiled in  the Mother Book according to the dispensations of Providence.' _Chapter  XIX._          \"This Book which We have sent down is indeed abounding ...\"      This Book which We have sent down is indeed abounding in blessings(56) and  beareth witness to the Truth, so that the people may realize that the  conclusive Proof of God in favour of His Remembrance is similar to the one  wherewith Muhammad, the Seal of the Prophets, was invested, and verily  great is the Cause as ordained in the Mother Book. _Chapter LXVI._          \"This Remembrance is indeed the glorious Remnant of ...\"      This Remembrance is indeed the glorious Remnant of the Light of God, and  He will be best for you,(57) if ye in very truth remain faithful to God,  the Most Exalted...    We have in truth sent Thee forth unto all men, by the leave of God,  invested with Our signs and reinforced by Our unsurpassed sovereignty. He  is indeed the appointed Bearer of the Trust of God...    O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Persevere steadfastly as Thou art bidden and let not the  faithless amongst men nor their utterances grieve Thee, since Thy Lord  shall, by the righteousness of God, the Most Great, pass judgement upon  them on the Day of Resurrection, and surely God witnesseth all things.  _Chapter LXXXIV._          \"This Religion is indeed, in the sight of God, the essence ...\"      This Religion is indeed, in the sight of God, the essence of the Faith of  Muhammad; haste ye then to attain the celestial Paradise and the  all-highest Garden of His good-pleasure in the presence of the One True  God, could ye but be patient and thankful before the evidences of the  signs of God. _Chapter XLVIII._          \"O My servants!
