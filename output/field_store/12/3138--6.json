Some tribes joined the \"false  prophets,\" of whom four had arisen in different parts of Arabia; some  relapsed into their ancient heathenism; while others proposed a  compromise--they would observe the stated times of prayer, but would be  excused the tithe. Every-where was rampant anarchy. The apostate tribes  attacked Medina, but were repulsed by the brave old Caliph Abu Bekr, who  refused to abate one jot or tittle, as the successor of Mohammed, of the  obligations of Islam. Eleven columns were sent forth under as many  leaders, trained in the warlike school of Mohammed. These fought their  way, step by step, successfully; and thus, mainly through the wisdom and  firmness of Abu Bekr and the valor and genius of Khalid, \"the Sword of  God,\" the Arab tribes, one by one, were overcome and forced back into  their allegiance and the profession of Islam. The reconquest of Arabia  and re-imposition of Mohammedanism as the national faith, which it took  a whole year to accomplish, is thus described by an Arabian author, who  wrote at the close of the second century of the Mohammedan era:         After his decease there remained not one of the followers of the       prophet that did not apostatize, saving only a small company of his       \"Companions\" and kinsfolk, who hoped thus to secure the government       to themselves. Hereupon Abu Bekr displayed marvelous skill, energy,       and address, so that the power passed into his hands.... And thus       he persevered until the apostate tribes were all brought back to       their allegiance, some by kindly treatment, persuasion, and craft;       some through terror and fear of the sword; and others by the       prospect of power and wealth as well as by the lusts and pleasures       of this life. And so it came to pass that all the Bedouin tribes       were in the end converted outwardly, but not from inward       conviction.[39]    [Sidenote: The Arabs thus reclaimed were, at the first, sullen.]  The temper of the tribes thus reclaimed by force of arms was at the  first strained and sullen. But the scene soon changed. Suddenly the  whole peninsula was shaken, and the people, seized with a burning zeal,  issued forth to plant the new faith in other lands. It happened on this  wise:    [Sidenote: Roused by war-cry, they issue from the peninsula, A.D. 634,  _et. seq._  The opposing forces.  Arab enthusiasm.]  The columns sent from Medina to reduce the rebellious tribes to the  north-west on the Gulf of Ayla, and to the north-east on the Persian  Gulf, came at once into collision with the Christian Bedouins of Syria  on the one hand and with those of Mesopotamia on the other. These again  were immediately supported by the neighboring forces of the Roman and  Persian empires, whose vassals respectively they were. And so, before  many months, Abu Bekr found his generals opposed by great and imposing  armies on either side. He was, in fact, waging mortal combat at one and  the same moment with the Kaiser and the Chosroes, the Byzantine emperor  and the great king of Persia. The risk was imminent, and an appeal went  forth for help to meet the danger. The battle-cry resounded from one end  of Arabia to the other, and electrified the land. Levy after levy, _en  masse_, started up at the call from every quarter of the peninsula, and  the Bedouin tribes, as bees from their hive, streamed forth in swarms,  animated by the prospect of conquest, plunder, and captive damsels, or,  if slain in battle, by the still more coveted prize of the \"martyr\" in  the material paradise of Mohammed. With a military ardor and new-born  zeal in which carnal and spiritual aspirations were strangely blended,  the Arabs rushed forth to the field, like the war-horse of Job, \"that  smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains and the  shouting.\" Sullen constraint was in a moment transformed into an  absolute devotion and fiery resolve to spread the faith. The Arab  warrior became the missionary of Islam.    [Sidenote: Arabs, a military body, subsidized and mobilized by Omar.]  It was now the care of Omar, the second caliph or ruler of the new-born  empire, to establish a system whereby the spirit militant, called into  existence with such force and fervor, might be rendered permanent. The  entire Arabian people was subsidized. The surplus revenues which in  rapidly increasing volume began to flow from the conquered lands into  the Moslem treasuries were to the last farthing distributed among the  soldiers of Arabian descent. The whole nation was enrolled, and the name  of every warrior entered upon the roster of Islam. Forbidden to settle  anywhere, and relieved from all other work, the Arab hordes became, in  fact, a standing army threatening the world. Great bodies of armed men  were kept thus ever mobilized, separate and in readiness for new  enterprise.    [Sidenote: Mission of Islam described by Fairbairn.]  The change which came over the policy of the Founder of the Faith at  Medina, and paved the way for this marvelous system of world-wide rapine  and conversion to Islam, is thus described by a thoughtful and sagacious  writer:         Medina was fatal to the higher capabilities of Islam. Mohammed       became then a king; his religion was incorporated in a State that       had to struggle for its life in the fashion familiar to the       rough-handed sons of the desert. The prophet was turned into the       legislator and commander; his revelations were now laws, and now       military orders and manifestoes. The mission of Islam became one       that only the sword could accomplish, robbery of the infidel became       meritorious, and conquest the supreme duty it owed to the world....         The religion which lived an unprospering and precarious life, so       long as it depended on the prophetic word alone, became an       aggressive and victorious power so soon as it was embodied in a       State.[40]    [Sidenote: And by von Kremer.]  Another learned and impartial authority tells us:         The Mussulman power under the first four caliphs was nothing but a       grand religio-political association of Arab tribes for universal       plunder and conquest under the holy banner of Islam, and the       watch-word, \"There is no god but the Lord, and Mohammed is       his apostle.\" On pretext of spreading the only true religion the       Arabs swallowed up fair provinces lying all around, and, driving a       profitable business, enriched themselves simultaneously in a       worldly sense.[41]    [Sidenote: Religious merit of \"fighting in the ways of the Lord.\"]  The motives which nerved the armies of Islam were a strange combination  of the lower instincts of nature with the higher aspirations of the  spirit. To engage in the Holy War was the rarest and most blessed of all  religious virtues, and conferred on the combatant a special merit; and  side by side with it lay the bright prospect of spoil and female slaves,  conquest and glory. \"Mount thy horse,\" said Osama ibn Zeid to Abu Bekr  as he accompanied the Syrian army a little way on its march, out of  Medina. \"Nay,\" replied the caliph, \"I will not ride, but I will walk and  soil my feet a little space in the ways of the Lord. Verily, every  footstep in the ways of the Lord is equal in merit to manifold good  works, and wipeth away a multitude of sins.\"[42] And of the \"martyrs,\"  those who fell in these crusading campaigns, Mohammed thus described the  blessed state:         Think not, in any wise, of those killed in the ways of the Lord, as       if they were dead. Yea, they are alive, and are nourished with       their Lord, exulting in that which God hath given them of his       favor, and rejoicing in behalf of those who have not yet joined       them, but are following after. No terror afflicteth them, neither       are they grieved.--Sura iii.    [Sidenote: Material fruits of Moslem crusade.]  The material fruits of their victories raised the Arabs at once from  being the needy inhabitants of a stony, sterile soil, where, with  difficulty, they eked out a hardy subsistence, to be the masters of rich  and luxuriant lands flowing with milk and honey. After one of his great  victories on the plains of Chaldea, Khalid called together his troops,  flushed with conquest, and lost in wonder at the exuberance around them,  and thus addressed them: \"Ye see the riches of the land. Its paths drop  fatness and plenty, so that the fruits of the earth are scattered abroad  even as stones are in Arabia. If but as a provision for this present  life, it were worth our while to fight for these fair fields and banish  care and penury forever from us.\" Such were the aspirations dear to the  heart of every Arab warrior. Again, after the battle of Jalola, a few  years later, the treasure and spoil of the Persian monarch, captured by  the victors, was valued at thirty million of dirhems (about a million  sterling). The royal fifth (the crown share of the booty) was sent as  usual to Medina under charge of Ziad, who, in the presence of the Caliph  Omar, harangued the citizens in a glowing description of what had been  won in Persia, fertile lands, rich cities, and endless spoil, besides  captive maids and princesses.    [Sidenote: Rich booty taken in the capital of Persia, A.D. 637.]  In relating the capture of Medain (the ancient Ctesiphon) tradition  revels in the untold wealth which fell into the hands of Sad, the  conqueror, and his followers. Besides millions of treasure, there was  endless store of gold and silver vessels, rich vestments, and rare and  precious things. The Arabs gazed bewildered at the tiara, brocaded  vestments, jeweled armor, and splendid surroundings of the throne. They  tell of a camel of silver, life-size, with a rider of gold, and of a  golden horse with emeralds for teeth, the neck set with rubies, the  trappings of gold. And we may read in Gibbon of the marvelous banqueting  carpet,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16997"],[0,"A Journey through the Kingdom of Oude, Volumes I & II (#11)"],[1,"ry, Captain Magness, and Soba Sing, lately  Captain Buckley's; in these, all that are disabled from wounds or  sickness are kept on the strength of the corps, and each corps has  with it a large invalid establishment of this kind unrecognized by  the Government. They could not get their men to fight, without it.  These regiments are put up at auction every season, and often several  times during one season; the contractor who bids highest gets the  services of the best for the season or the occasion; the purchase-  money is divided between the minister and the Court favourites,  singers, &c. These are really efficient corps, and the others might  soon be made the same. The men are as fine-looking and brave as those  of our, regular infantry, for Oude teems with such men, who have from  their boyhood been fighting against contractors under the heads of  their clan or families.    7. The rest are for the most part commanded by boys, or Court  favourites, who seldom see them, keep about two-thirds of what are  borne on the rolls and paid for, and take about one-third of the pay  of what remain for themselves. The singer, Rajee-od Dowla, the prime  favourite above named, has two regiments thus treated, and of course  altogether inefficient, ragged, hungry, and discontented. It will be  easy to remedy all this, get excellent men, and inspire them with  excellent spirit by instituting a modified pension establishment for  men disabled in the discharge of their duties, and providing for  their regular pay and efficient command.    8. This would prevent the necessity of employing British troops,  except on rare and great occasions; the settlement of the land-  revenue, and knowledge that they would be employed if required, would  keep the great landholders in obedience. It would be well to have  back the corps of infantry and two guns that were taken away from  Pertanghurh, in Oude, in 1835. This is all the addition that would be  required to secure an efficient Government; and the scale to which  our troops in Oude had been reduced up to that time (1835) was  generally considered the lowest compatible with our engagements. A  regiment of cavalry had been borrowed from Pertanghurh for the Nepaul  and Mahratta wars in 1814 and 1817; it was finally withdrawn in 1823.    9. The judicial Courts would be well conducted while the presiding  officers felt secure in their tenure of office, which they would do  when their dismissal depended upon proof of guilt or incompetency  sufficient to satisfy a Board guaranteed by our Government.    10. The police would soon become efficient under the supervision and  control of respectable revenue-officers, having the same feeling of  security in their tenure of office. All the revenue-officers would,  of course, be servants of Government instead of contractors. There  would be grades answering to our commissioners of divisions, say  four; 2nd, to our collectors of revenue, say twenty-eight; 3rd,  deputy-collectors, say twenty-eight; all under the Board, and guided  by the member intrusted with that branch of the administration: all  would be responsible for the police over their respective  jurisdictions.    11. Oude ought to be, and would soon be, under such a system, a  garden; the soil is the finest in India, so are the men; and there is  no want of an educated class for civil office: on the contrary, they  abound almost as much as the class of soldiers. From the numerous  rivers which flow through the country the water is everywhere near  the surface, and the peasantry would manure and irrigate every field,  if they could do so in peace and security, with a fair prospect of  being permitted to reap the fruits. The terrible corruption of the  Court is the great impediment to all this good: the savings would  more than pay all the increased outlay required for rendering  establishments efficient in all branches, while the treasury would  receive at least one-third more than the expenditure; that is,  1,50,00,000 Rs., or one crore and a half.    12. From the time the treaty of 1801 was made, up to within the last  few years, the term \"internal enemies\" was interpreted to mean the  great landholders who might be in resistance to the Government, and  this interpretation was always acted upon; the only difficulty was in  ascertaining whether the resistance was or was not, under the  circumstances, justifiable. While employed in Oude with my regiment,  and on the staff in 1818 and 1819, I saw much of the correspondence  between the Resident and Commandant; many letters from the Resident,  Colonel Baillie, mentioning how bitterly Saadulullee, with whom that  treaty was made, had complained, that after the sacrifice of half his  kingdom for the aid of British troops in keeping down these powerful  and refractory landholders, he could not obtain their assistance  without being subject to such humiliating remonstrances as he got  from officers commanding stations whenever he asked for it. Aid was  often given, and forts innumerable were reduced from time to time,  but the privilege of building them up again was purchased from the  same or another contractor next season.    13. At this time I have calls for at least two battalions and a train  of artillery, from about six quarters, to enforce orders on these  landholders. Captain Hearsey has had men of his Frontier Police  killed and wounded by them on the western border, and declares that  nothing can be done to secure offenders, refugees from our districts,  with a less force. Captain Orr has had several men wounded, and  prisoners taken from him, by the same class on the eastern border,  and declares to the same effect. Sixteen sepoys of our army, 59th N.  I., on their way home on furlough were attacked and two of them  killed, three weeks ago, by a third Zumeendar, at Peernugger, his own  estate, within ten miles of the Setapore Cantonments, where we have a  regiment. Captain Barlow's regiment and artillery, and another, with  all Captain Hearsey's Frontier Police, are in pursuit of him. Four  others have committed similar outrages on our officers and sepoys and  their families, and the Government declares its utter inability to  enforce obedience or grant any redress, without a larger force than  they have to send. Great numbers of the same class are plundering and  burning villages, and robbing and murdering on the highway, and  laughing at the impotency of the sovereign. It was certainly for aid  in coercing these \"internal enemies\" that the Sovereign of Oude ceded  his territories to us, and for no other, and that aid may be afforded  at little cost, and to the great benefit of all under the system I  have submitted for your Lordship's consideration. It will be very  rarely required, and when called for, a mere demonstration will, in  three cases out of four, be sufficient to effect the object.    14, After a time, or when the heir-apparent comes of age, the duties  of the guaranteed members of the Board may safely be united to a  supervision over the settlement made with the principal landholders,  whose obedience our Government may consider itself bound to aid in  enforcing; all the rest may be left to a competent sovereign; and  there will be nothing in the system opposed to native usages,  feelings, and institutions, to prevent its being adhered to. I should  mention, that many of these landholders have each armed and  disciplined bodies of two thousand foot and five hundred horse; and,  what is worse, the command of as many as they like of \"Passies,\"  armed with bows and arrows. These Passies are reckless thieves and  robbers of the lowest class, whose only professions are thieving and  acting as Chowkedars, or village police. They are at the service of  every refractory Zumeendar, for what they can get in booty in his  depredations. The disorders in Oude have greatly increased this  class, and they are now roughly estimated at a hundred thousand  families; these are the men from whom travellers on the road suffer  most.    15. A second Assistant would be required for a time to enable the  Resident to shift off the daily detail of the treasury, which has  become the largest in India,--I believe, beyond those at the three  Presidencies.    A good English copyist, capable of mapping, will be required in the  Resident's office at 150, and two Persian writers 100; total 250.  These are the only additions which appear to me to be required.    16. I annex a list of the regiments now in the King's service,  Telungas, or regulars, and Nujeebs, or irregulars; and with my next  official report I will submit a list of all the establishments, civil  and military.    17. The King's habits will not alter; he was allowed by his father to  associate, as at present, with these singers from his boyhood, and he  cannot endure the society of other persons. His determination to live  exclusively in their society, and to hear and see nothing of what his  officers do or his people suffer, he no longer makes any attempt to  conceal. It would be idle to hope for anything from him but a  resignation of power into more competent hands; whatever he retains  he will assuredly give to his singers and eunuchs, or allow them to  take. No man can take charge of any office without anticipating the  income by large gratuities to them, and the average gratuity which a  contractor for a year, of a district yielding three lacs of rupees a-  year, is made to pay, before he leaves the capital to enter upon his  charge, is estimated to be fifty thousand rupees: this he exacts from  the landholders as the first payment, for which they receive no  credit in the public account. All other offices are paid for in the  same way.    18. The King would change his minister to-morrow if the singers were  to propose it; and they would propose it if they could get better  terms or perquisites under any other. No minister could hold office a  week without their acquiescence. Under"]]]
