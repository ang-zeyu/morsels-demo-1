It was so utterly and inconceivably unlike what  Hamar, Curtis and Kelson had imagined the Unknown--and yet, withal, so  monstrous (not merely in its shape but in its suggestions), and so  vividly real and livid, that they were not merely terrified--they were  stricken with a terror that rendered them dumb and helpless. And as  they looked at it, from out the trunk, shot an enormous thing--white  and glistening, and fashioned like a human tongue. And after pointing  derisively at them, it withdrew; whereupon all the fruit shook, as if  convulsed with unseemly laughter. They then saw between the foremost  branches of the tree a big eye. The white of it was thick and pasty,  the iris spongy in texture, and the pupil bulging with a lurid light.  It stared at them with a steady stare--insolent and quizzical. Hamar  and his friends stared back at it in fascinated horror, and would have  continued staring at it indefinitely, had not Hamar's mercenary  instincts come to their rescue. He recollected that time was pressing,  and that unless he got into communication with the strange thing at  once, according to the book, it would vanish--and he might never be  able to get in touch with it again. Thus egged on, he made a great  effort to regain his courage, and at length succeeded in forcing  himself to speak. Though his voice was weak and shaking he managed to  pronounce the prescribed mode of address, viz.:--\"Bara phonen etek  mo,\" which being interpreted is, \"Spirit from the Unknown, give ear to  me.\" He then explained their earnest desire to pay homage to the  Supernatural, and to be initiated into the mysteries of the Black Art.  When Hamar had concluded his address, the anticipations of the three  as to how it would be answered, or whether it would be answered at  all--were such that they were forced to hold their breath almost to  the point of suffocation. If the Thing _could_ speak what would its  voice be like? The seconds passed, and they were beginning to prepare  themselves for disappointment, when suddenly across the intervening  space separating them from the Unknown, the reply came--came in soft,  silky, lisping tones--human and yet not human, novel and yet in some  way--a way that defied analysis--familiar. Strange to say, they all  three felt that this familiarity belonged to a far back period of  their existence, no less than to a more modern one--to a period, in  fact, to which they could affix no date. And, although a perfect unity  of expression suggested that the utterance of the Thing was the  utterance of one being only, a certain variation in its tones, a  rising and falling from syllable to syllable, led them to infer that  the voice was not the voice of one but of many.    \"You are anxious to acquire knowledge of the Secrets associated with  the Great Atlantean Magic?\" the voice lisped.    \"We are!\" Hamar stammered, \"and we are willing to give our souls in  exchange for them.\"    \"Souls!\" the voice lisped, whilst trunk and branches swayed lightly,  and the air was full of silent merriment. \"Souls! you speak in terms  you do not understand. To acquire the secrets of Black Magic, all you  have to do is to agree that during a brief period--a period of a few  months, you will live together in harmony; that you will make use of  the powers you acquire to the detriment of all save yourselves; that  you will never allow your minds to revert to anything spiritual;  and--that you will abstain from--marrying.\"    \"And if we succeed in carrying out the conditions?\" Hamar asked.    [Illustration: THE INITIATION]    \"Then,\" the voice replied, \"you will retain free, untrammelled  possession of your knowledge.\"    \"For how long?\" Curtis queried.    \"For the natural term of your lives--that is to say, for as long as  you would have lived had you never been initiated into the secrets of  magic.\"    \"And if we fail?\"    \"You will pass into the permanent possession of the Unknown.\"    \"Does that mean we shall die the moment we fail?\" Kelson inquired  timidly.    \"Die!\" the voice lisped. \"Again you speak in terms you do not  understand. You may be sent for.\"    \"You say--in perfect harmony.\" Hamar put in. \"Does that mean without a  quarrel, however slight?\"    \"It means without a quarrel that would lead to separation. The moment  you disunite the compact is broken.\"    \"What advantages will the secrets bring us?\" Hamar inquired. \"Can we  gain unlimited wealth?\"    \"Yes!\" the voice replied. \"Unlimited wealth and influence.\"    \"And health?\"    \"So long as you fulfil the conditions of the compact you will enjoy  perfect health. Will you, or will you not, pledge yourselves?\"    \"I am ready if you fellows are,\" Hamar whispered.    \"I am!\" Curtis cried. \"Anything is better than the life we are living  at present.\"    \"And I, too,\" Kelson said. \"I agree with Ed.\"    \"Very well then,\" the voice once more lisped. \"Each of you take a  fruit and eat it, and the compact is irrevocably struck. You cannot  back out of it without incurring the consequences already named. Don't  be afraid, step up here and help yourselves--one apiece--mind, no  more.\" And again it seemed to Hamar, Curtis and Kelson as if the tree  and everything around it was convulsed with silent laughter.    \"Come on!\" Hamar cried, somewhat imperatively. \"Don't waste time.  You've decided, and besides, remember this affair may turn out trumps.  I'll go first,\" and walking up to the tree he plucked a fruit and  began to eat it. Curtis and Kelson slowly followed suit.    \"I believe I'm eating a live slug, or a toad,\" Curtis muttered, with a  retch.    \"And I, too,\" Kelson whispered. \"It's filthy. I shall be sick. If I  am, will it make any difference to the compact, I wonder?\"    What the fruit really tasted like they could never decide. It reminded  them of many things and of nothing. It was sweet yet bitter; it  repelled but at the same time pleased them; it was as perplexing as  the voice--as enigmatical. When they had eaten it they resumed their  former positions on the ground, and the voice once again addressed  them.    \"The fruit you have consumed has created in you a fitness to make use  of the powers about to be conferred. You have acquired the faculty of  sorcery--you will be initiated by stages, into the knowledge and  practice of it. These stages, seven in number, will cover the period  of your compact, _i.e._ twenty-one months, and at the end of every  three months--when a fresh stage is reached--you will receive fresh  powers.    \"In the first stage, the stage you are now entering upon, you will  receive the power of divination. You will be told how to detect the  presence of water and all kinds of metals, and how to read people's  thoughts.    \"In the second stage--exactly three months from to-day--you will  receive the gift of second-sight; the power of separating your  immaterial from your material body and projecting it, anywhere you  will, on the physical plane; and, to a large extent, you will be  enabled to circumvent gravity. Thus you will be able to perform all  manner of jugglery tricks--tricks that will set the whole world  gaping. Profit by them.    \"In the third stage you will possess the secrets of invisibility; of  walking on the water; of breathing under the water; of taming wild  beasts; and of understanding their language.    \"In the fourth stage you will understand how to inflict all manner of  diseases, and work all sorts of spells; such, for instance, as  bewitching milk, causing people to have fits, bad dreams, etc. You  will also know how to create plagues--plagues of insects, or of any  other noxious thing.    \"In the fifth stage you will possess absolute knowledge of the art of  medicine and be able to cure every ailment.    \"In the sixth stage you will acquire the power of producing vampires  and werwolves from the human being, and of transforming people from  the human to any animal guise.    \"In the seventh and final stage you will be given the complete mastery  of every art and science--including astrology, astronomy, necromancy,  etc.; and for this stage is reserved the greatest power of  all--namely, the complete dominion over woman's will and affections.  The powers of creating life, and of extending life beyond the now  natural limit, and of avoiding accidents, will never be conferred on  you. Neither shall you learn, not at least during your physical  existence--who or what we are, or the secrets of creation.    \"Each successive stage will cancel the preceding one--that is to say,  the powers you have acquired in the first stage will be annulled on  your arriving at the second stage, and so on. But if you carry out  your compact faithfully--that is to say, if at the end of the  twenty-one months you are still united--all the powers you have held  hitherto, in the different stages, temporarily, will return to you and  remain in your possession permanently. Have you anything to say?\"    \"Yes!\" Hamar answered; \"I fully understand all you have explained to  us and I like the idea of it immensely. The fear of our coming to any  serious loggerheads and of dissolving partnership doesn't worry me  much--but I must say, it seems very remote--the prospect of gaining  such tremendous powers--powers that will give us practically  everything we want--save youth--\"    \"Youth you will never regain,\" lisped the voice. \"And elixirs of life,  surely you must know, are no longer sought after, by beings of the  planet Earth. They are quite out of date. You will, of course, learn  the most efficacious means of making yourselves and other people  youthful in appearance.\"    \"Yes, but how shall we learn these secrets?\" Kelson nerved himself to  ask.    \"They will be revealed to you in various ways--sometimes when asleep.  You will receive preliminary instructions as to divination before this  time to-morrow.\"    \"And meanwhile, we shall be in want of money,\" Curtis remarked.    \"No!\" the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14328"],[0,"The Consolation of Philosophy (#11)"],[1," origin,  however faint, and though in a vision dim and clouded, yet in some wise,  notwithstanding, ye discern the true end of happiness, and so the aim of  nature leads you thither--to that true good--while error in many forms  leads you astray therefrom. For reflect whether men are able to win  happiness by those means through which they think to reach the proposed  end. Truly, if either wealth, rank, or any of the rest, bring with them  anything of such sort as seems to have nothing wanting to it that is  good, we, too, acknowledge that some are made happy by the acquisition  of these things. But if they are not able to fulfil their promises, and,  moreover, lack many good things, is not the happiness men seek in them  clearly discovered to be a false show? Therefore do I first ask thee  thyself, who but lately wert living in affluence, amid all that  abundance of wealth, was thy mind never troubled in consequence of some  wrong done to thee?'    'Nay,' said I, 'I cannot ever remember a time when my mind was so  completely at peace as not to feel the pang of some uneasiness.'    'Was it not because either something was absent which thou wouldst not  have absent, or present which thou wouldst have away?'    'Yes,' said I.    'Then, thou didst want the presence of the one, the absence of the  other?'    'Admitted.'    'But a man lacks that of which he is in want?'    'He does.'    'And he who lacks something is not in all points self-sufficing?'    'No; certainly not,' said I.    'So wert thou, then, in the plenitude of thy wealth, supporting this  insufficiency?'    'I must have been.'    'Wealth, then, cannot make its possessor independent and free from all  want, yet this was what it seemed to promise. Moreover, I think this  also well deserves to be considered--that there is nothing in the  special nature of money to hinder its being taken away from those who  possess it against their will.'    'I admit it.'    'Why, of course, when every day the stronger wrests it from the weaker  without his consent. Else, whence come lawsuits, except in seeking to  recover moneys which have been taken away against their owner's will by  force or fraud?'    'True,' said I.    'Then, everyone will need some extraneous means of protection to keep  his money safe.'    'Who can venture to deny it?'    'Yet he would not, unless he possessed the money which it is possible to  lose.'    'No; he certainly would not.'    'Then, we have worked round to an opposite conclusion: the wealth which  was thought to make a man independent rather puts him in need of further  protection. How in the world, then, can want be driven away by riches?  Cannot the rich feel hunger? Cannot they thirst? Are not the limbs of  the wealthy sensitive to the winter's cold? \"But,\" thou wilt say, \"the  rich have the wherewithal to sate their hunger, the means to get rid of  thirst and cold.\" True enough; want can thus be soothed by riches,  wholly removed it cannot be. For if this ever-gaping, ever-craving want  is glutted by wealth, it needs must be that the want itself which can be  so glutted still remains. I do not speak of how very little suffices for  nature, and how for avarice nothing is enough. Wherefore, if wealth  cannot get rid of want, and makes new wants of its own, how can ye  believe that it bestows independence?'        SONG III.    THE INSATIABLENESS OF AVARICE.          Though the covetous grown wealthy        See his piles of gold rise high;      Though he gather store of treasure        That can never satisfy;      Though with pearls his gorget blazes,        Rarest that the ocean yields;      Though a hundred head of oxen        Travail in his ample fields;      Ne'er shall carking care forsake him        While he draws this vital breath,      And his riches go not with him,        When his eyes are closed in death.        IV.      'Well, but official dignity clothes him to whom it comes with honour and  reverence! Have, then, offices of state such power as to plant virtue in  the minds of their possessors, and drive out vice? Nay, they are rather  wont to signalize iniquity than to chase it away, and hence arises our  indignation that honours so often fall to the most iniquitous of men.  Accordingly, Catullus calls Nonius an \"ulcer-spot,\" though \"sitting in  the curule chair.\" Dost not see what infamy high position brings upon  the bad? Surely their unworthiness will be less conspicuous if their  rank does not draw upon them the public notice! In thy own case, wouldst  thou ever have been induced by all these perils to think of sharing  office with Decoratus, since thou hast discerned in him the spirit of a  rascally parasite and informer? No; we cannot deem men worthy of  reverence on account of their office, whom we deem unworthy of the  office itself. But didst thou see a man endued with wisdom, couldst thou  suppose him not worthy of reverence, nor of that wisdom with which he  was endued?'    'No; certainly not.'    'There is in Virtue a dignity of her own which she forthwith passes over  to those to whom she is united. And since public honours cannot do this,  it is clear that they do not possess the true beauty of dignity. And  here this well deserves to be noticed--that if a man is the more scorned  in proportion as he is despised by a greater number, high position not  only fails to win reverence for the wicked, but even loads them the more  with contempt by drawing more attention to them. But not without  retribution; for the wicked pay back a return in kind to the dignities  they put on by the pollution of their touch. Perhaps, too, another  consideration may teach thee to confess that true reverence cannot come  through these counterfeit dignities. It is this: If one who had been  many times consul chanced to visit barbaric lands, would his office win  him the reverence of the barbarians? And yet if reverence were the  natural effect of dignities, they would not forego their proper function  in any part of the world, even as fire never anywhere fails to give  forth heat. But since this effect is not due to their own efficacy, but  is attached to them by the mistaken opinion of mankind, they disappear  straightway when they are set before those who do not esteem them  dignities. Thus the case stands with foreign peoples. But does their  repute last for ever, even in the land of their origin? Why, the  prefecture, which was once a great power, is now an empty name--a burden  merely on the senator's fortune; the commissioner of the public corn  supply was once a personage--now what is more contemptible than this  office? For, as we said just now, that which hath no true comeliness of  its own now receives, now loses, lustre at the caprice of those who have  to do with it. So, then, if dignities cannot win men reverence, if they  are actually sullied by the contamination of the wicked, if they lose  their splendour through time's changes, if they come into contempt  merely for lack of public estimation, what precious beauty have they in  themselves, much less to give to others?'        SONG IV.    DISGRACE OF HONOURS CONFERRED BY A TYRANT.          Though royal purple soothes his pride,        And snowy pearls his neck adorn,      Nero in all his riot lives        The mark of universal scorn.        Yet he on reverend heads conferred        Th' inglorious honours of the state.      Shall we, then, deem them truly blessed        Whom such preferment hath made great?        V.      'Well, then, does sovereignty and the intimacy of kings prove able to  confer power? Why, surely does not the happiness of kings endure for  ever? And yet antiquity is full of examples, and these days also, of  kings whose happiness has turned into calamity. How glorious a power,  which is not even found effectual for its own preservation! But if  happiness has its source in sovereign power, is not happiness  diminished, and misery inflicted in its stead, in so far as that power  falls short of completeness? Yet, however widely human sovereignty be  extended, there must still be more peoples left, over whom each several  king holds no sway. Now, at whatever point the power on which happiness  depends ceases, here powerlessness steals in and makes wretchedness; so,  by this way of reckoning, there must needs be a balance of wretchedness  in the lot of the king. The tyrant who had made trial of the perils of  his condition figured the fears that haunt a throne under the image of a  sword hanging over a man's head.[G] What sort of power, then, is this  which cannot drive away the gnawings of anxiety, or shun the stings of  terror? Fain would they themselves have lived secure, but they cannot;  then they boast about their power! Dost thou count him to possess power  whom thou seest to wish what he cannot bring to pass? Dost thou count  him to possess power who encompasses himself with a body-guard, who  fears those he terrifies more than they fear him, who, to keep up the  semblance of power, is himself at the mercy of his slaves? Need I say  anything of the friends of kings, when I show royal dominion itself so  utterly and miserably weak--why ofttimes the royal power in its  plenitude brings them low, ofttimes involves them in its fall? Nero  drove his friend and preceptor, Seneca, to the choice of the manner of  his death. Antoninus exposed Papinianus, who was long powerful at  court, to the swords of the soldiery. Yet each of these was willing to  renounce his power. Seneca tried to surrender his wealth also to Nero,  and go into retirement; but neither achieved his purpose. When they  tottered, their very greatness dragged them down. What manner of thing,  then, is this power which keeps men in fear while they possess it--which  when thou art fain to keep, thou art not safe, and when thou desirest to  lay it aside thou canst not rid thyself of? Are friends any protection  who have been attached by fortune, not by virtue? Nay; him whom good"]]]
