The ropes extended to  opposite anchorages, where each was passed over a branch of the tree and  belayed on a cleat within easy reach. A fellow could draw himself up  clear of the ground by pulling on the free end of the fall, as a painter  does; then tying the swing fast in this position, he would pull himself  across the stream by means of the rope stretched to the opposite  anchorage. The swing could be drawn back by the next one who wanted to  cross. We also used this aerial line for transporting loads from one  island to the other.    [Illustration: Fig. 96. The Rope Railway.]      SUSPENSION BRIDGE.    [Illustration: Fig 97. Barrel-stave Flooring.]    [Illustration: Fig. 98. The Suspension Bridge.]    Our aerial railway didn't last long. We soon tired of it, and instead  utilized the materials for a rope suspension bridge. We procured from  Lumberville half a dozen old barrels and used the staves as a flooring  for the bridge. The staves were linked together by a pair of ropes at  each end woven over and under, as indicated in the drawing Fig. 97.  Notches were cut in the staves to hold the ropes from slipping off. The  flexible flooring thus constructed was stretched across the river and  secured to stakes driven firmly in the ground. A pair of parallel ropes  were extended across the stream about three feet above the flooring,  with which they were connected at intervals of five feet. The bridge was  25 feet long, and while rather shaky, owing to the fact that there were  no braces to prevent it from swaying sidewise, still it was very strong  and did excellent service.      PONTOON BRIDGE.    [Illustration: Fig. 99. The Pontoon Bridge.]    At the head of the mill-race, where the channel was fifty feet wide, we  built a pontoon bridge. We were fortunate in securing six good cider  barrels at low cost, also a quantity of \"slabs\" from one of the sawmills  of Lumberville. \"Slab\" is the lumberman's name for the outside piece of  a log which is sawn off in squaring up the sides. We made a raft of  these materials and floated them down the river to Lake Placid. The  bridge was made by anchoring the barrels in the channel about eight feet  apart, and laying on them the floor beams, which supported a flooring of  slabs. The floor beams were narrow planks 1 inch by 4 inches, taken from  the bridge wreck, and they were placed on edge to prevent sagging. Of  course we had no anchors for securing the barrels, but used instead  large stones weighing about 100 pounds each, around which the anchor  lines were fastened. We found it rather difficult to sink these  improvised anchors at just the right places, for we were working at the  very mouth of the mill-race, and were in constant danger of having our  scow sucked down into the swirling channel. Once we were actually drawn  into the mill-race and tore madly down the rushing stream. By Bill's  careful steering we managed to avoid striking the shore, and just as we  were off the Tiger's Tail Reddy succeeded in swinging a rope around an  overhanging limb and bringing us to a sudden stop. A moment later we  might have been dashed against the rocks in the rapids below and our  boat smashed. Shooting rapids in a scow is a very different matter from  riding through them on a plank.      THE KING ROD TRUSS.    Our bridge building operations were not entirely confined to the island.  Two of them were built on the Schreiner grounds at Lamington. Reddy  Schreiner's home was situated a little distance above the town where  Cedar Brook came tumbling down a gorge in the hills and spread out into  the Schreiners' ice pond. Thence it pursued its course very quietly  through the low and somewhat swampy ground in the Schreiners' back yard.  Over this brook Reddy was very anxious to build a bridge. Accordingly,  before returning to school in the fall Bill made out a careful set of  plans for the structure, and after we had gone the rest of the society,  under Reddy's guidance, erected the bridge.    [Illustration: Fig. 100. The King Rod Bridge.]    The structure was a cross between a suspension bridge and a spar bridge.  The banks of the stream were so low that, instead of resting the floor  of the bridge on top of the inclined frames, as we had done over the  mill-race, it was suspended from the spars by means of wires. The  crossing ends of the spars were nailed together and their lower ends  were firmly planted about four feet apart in the banks of the brook. A  stick nailed to the apex of each pair of spars served temporarily to  brace them apart. The center cross beam of the bridge was now suspended  from the spars by means of heavy galvanized iron wire (No. 14, I should  say). The beam was hung high enough to allow for stretch of the wire,  making the roadway incline upward from both sides to the center. Aside  from carrying the floor of the bridge, this beam was used to brace the  inclined spars when the temporary crosspiece was removed. The ends of  the beam projected about thirty inches beyond the bridge at each side,  and they supported braces which extended diagonally upward to the  crossing ends of the spars. When this was done the temporary crosspiece  above referred to was removed. As the span between the center cross beam  and the banks was a little too long to provide a steady floor, a couple  of intermediate cross beams were suspended from the inclined spars. The  floor beams were then laid in place and covered with a flooring of  slabs.      STIFFENING THE BRIDGE.    The bridge was a pretty good one, except for a slight unsteadiness  between the center and either end. When Uncle Ed saw it he showed us at  once where the trouble lay. Our intermediate cross beams were hung from  the center of the spars, and consequently made them bend, because the  strain came across their length, while at the center of the bridge there  was no chance for the spars to bend, because the strain was exerted  along their length, that is, it tended merely to push the ends of the  spars deeper into the banks. To remedy the trouble he proposed propping  up the center of each spar with a brace running from the center  crosspiece. The dotted lines in Fig. 100 show how these braces were  applied. They made the floor perfectly solid throughout, and gave the  bridge a much better appearance. Uncle Ed told us that the structure  might be called a \"king rod truss,\" except that in place of rods we had  used wires.    [Illustration: The King Rod Bridge.]    [Illustration: The Bridge over Cedar Brook Gorge.]      THE KING POST BRIDGE.    The other bridge on the Schreiner property was built in the following  summer, just before we started on our second expedition to Willow Clump  Island. It spanned the brook at the gorge, and was therefore a more  difficult engineering feat. Mr. Schreiner himself asked us to build it,  and we felt greatly honored by the request. A search was made in the Van  Syckel library for a suitable type. At last we found one that seemed  properly suited to the requirements. It was called a \"king post truss,\"  and was very similar to the king rod bridge. While the design of the  bridge was simple, yet it required some ingenuity to put it together. In  setting up the other bridge the scow had been anchored in the center of  the stream and used as a working platform, from which it had been an  easy matter to put the various parts together. In this case our scow was  obviously of no use, so we laid a couple of long logs across the chasm,  and a few slats were nailed across them to provide a temporary bridge or  working platform. The platform sagged considerably at the center,  because the span was fully eighteen feet; but the logs were large, and  we knew they were strong enough to support our weight. However, as an  extra precaution, we tied the ends to stakes driven in the ground, so  that they could not possibly slip off the banks.    [Illustration: Fig. 101. The King Post Frame.]    [Illustration: Fig. 102. The King Posts Set in Position.]    [Illustration: Fig. 103. The Permanent Cross Beam Made Fast.]    First we set about constructing the king posts, which were made as shown  in Fig. 101. Two stout posts 7 feet long were connected at the top by a  tie stick, which spaced them 4 feet apart. To make a secure fastening  they were notched together and strengthened with diagonal braces. Each  king post was notched on opposite sides, at about thirty inches from the  top. A temporary tie piece was also nailed across the lower ends of the  king posts. The frame thus formed was set up at the center of the span  and temporarily held by nailing the lower tie piece to the working  platform. Four stout spars were now cut, each about fifteen feet long.  Taking a pair at a time, we planted their lower ends firmly in the  opposite banks and sawed off their upper ends until they could just be  hammered into the notches in the king post. This required careful  fitting, but by making the spars a little too long to start with, and  then shaving them down with a draw-knife, we managed to make fairly good  joints. A couple of long wire nails in each spar made the structure  perfectly secure. The king posts were now sawed off just above the  temporary tie piece, and the permanent cross beam was fastened to these  ends with straps of heavy wire wound tightly about them. The working  platform sagged so much that we were able to lay this cross beam above  it. From the ends of the cross beam diagonal braces extended to the king  posts (Fig. 103). Our working platform was now removed and replaced with  the permanent floor beams, which were firmly nailed to the center cross  beam and to the inclined spars at the shore ends. The floor beams were  quite heavy and needed no support between the king posts and shore. A  rustic floor was made of small logs sawed in two at Mr. Schreiner's  sawmill. Light poles were nailed to the flooring along each edge, giving  a finish to the bridge.

But I have no time to talk  now; only meet me, and bring as many of the foundationers as you can  collect into the left-hand corner of the playground, just behind the  Botanical Laboratory, at recess.\"    Kate made no answer, unless a toss of her head could have been taken as  a reply. Her first impulse was to take no notice of Susy's  remarks--little Susy Hopkins, the daughter of a small stationer in the  town, a girl who had scarcely scraped through in her examination. It was  intolerable that she should put on such airs.    The work of the school began, and all the girls were busy. Kate was  clever, and she meant to try for one of the big scholarships. She would  get her forty pounds a year when the time came, and go to Holloway  College or some other college. She was not a lady by birth; she had not  a single instinct of a true lady within her; but she was intensely  ambitious. She did not care so much for beauty as for style; she made  style her idol. The look that Cassandra wore as she walked quietly  across the room, the set of her dress, the still more wonderful set of  her head as it was placed on her queenly young shoulders--these were the  things that burnt into Kate's soul and made her restless and  dissatisfied. She would willingly have given all her father's  wealth--and he was quite well-to-do for his class--- to have Cassandra's  face, Cassandra's voice, Cassandra's figure. Cassandra was not at all a  pretty girl, but her appearance appealed to all the wild ambitions in  Kate's soul. She had a jealous contempt of Ruth Craven, who, although a  foundation girl, managed to look like a lady; but her envy was centered  round Cassandra. As to the Irish girl, she had scarcely noticed her up  to the present.    Work went on that morning with much verve and vigor. It was a pleasant  morning: the windows were open; the schoolrooms were all well  ventilated; the teachers, the best of their kind, were stimulating in  their lectures and in their conversation. There was a look of business  and animation throughout the whole place: it was like a hive of bees. At  last the moment of recess arrived. Kate just raised her head, looked  over the shoulders of her companions, and saw Susy Hopkins darting  restlessly about, catching one girl by the sleeve, another by the arm,  whispering in the ear of a third, flinging her arm round the neck of a  fourth; and as she spoke to the girls they looked interested,  astonished, and cordial. They moved away to that lonely part of the  playground which was situated at the back of the Botanical Laboratory.  Kate had made up her mind not to take the least notice of Susy. She was  pacing up and down alone; for, most provoking, all her chosen friends  had gone off with that young lady. Suddenly she saw Ruth Craven going  very quietly by. By all the laws of the foundationers, Ruth ought to  speak to her companions in misfortune. Kate rushed up to her.    \"What are they all doing there?\" she said. \"Do you happen to know Susy  Hopkins?\"    \"No,\" replied Ruth gently. \"She came up to me just now and asked me to  join her and some other girls at the back of the Laboratory. I don't  know that I want to.\"    \"I am curious,\" said Kate. \"Of course, I am no friend of Susy's; she is  a most contemptible little wretch; but I may as well know what it is all  about. Come with me, won't you?\"    Ruth hesitated.    \"Come along; we may as well know. There is probably some mischief on  foot, and it is only fair that we should be forewarned.\"    \"I don't want to know,\" said Ruth; but as Kate slipped her hand through  her arm and pulled her along, she said resignedly, \"Well, if I must I  must.\"    As they strolled across the big playground, Ruth turned and glanced at  Cassandra; but Cassandra was busy making friends with Florence, who was  very angry with her for her desertion of the day before, and took no  notice of Ruth. The Irish girl was nowhere in sight. Ruth sighed and  continued her walk with Kate.    The most lonely and most dreary part of the playground was that little  portion which was situated at the back of the Laboratory. Nothing grew  there; the ground was innocent of grass, and much worn by the tramping  of young feet. There were swings and garden-seats and preparations for  tennis and other games in the rest of the big playground, but nothing  had ever been done at the back of the Laboratory. When the two girls  arrived they found five other girls waiting for them. Their names were,  of course, Susy Hopkins, who considered herself on this delightful  occasion quite the leader; a gentle and refined-looking girl of the name  of Mary Rand; Rosy Myers, who was pretty and frivolous, with dark eyes  and fair hair; Clara Sawyer, who was renowned for her vulgar taste in  dress; and Hannah Johnson, a heavy-looking girl with a scowling brow and  a very pronounced jaw. Hannah Johnson was about the plainest girl in the  school. When Susy saw Kate Rourke and Ruth Craven she uttered a little  scream of delight.    \"Now we are complete,\" she said. \"Listen to me, all you girls, for I  haven't too long in which to tell you; that horrid bell will ring us  back to lessons and dullness in less than no time. The most wonderful,  delightful chance is offered to us. I met her yesterday, and she decided  to do it. She is a brick of bricks. She will make the most tremendous  difference in our lives. You know, although you pretend not to feel it,  but you all must know how we foundationers are sat upon and objected to  in the school. We bear it as meekly as we can for the sake of our  so-called advantages; but if we can be snubbed, we are, and if we can be  neglected, we are--although it isn't the teachers we have to complain  of, but the girls. Sometimes things are past bearing, and yet we are  powerless. There are three hundred paying girls, and there are one  hundred foundationers. What chance has one hundred against three?\"    \"What is the good of bringing all that up, Susy?\" said Mary Rand. \"We  are foundationers, and we ought to be thankful.\"    \"The education is splendid; we ought not to forget that,\" said Ruth  Craven.    Susy turned on Ruth as though she would like to eat her.    \"It is all very fine for you,\" she said. \"Just because you happen to be  pretty, they take you up. I wonder one of your fine friends doesn't pay  for you, and so save your position out and out.\"    \"I wouldn't allow her to,\" replied Ruth, her eyes flashing fire. \"I had  much rather be a foundationer. I mean to prove that I am every bit as  good as a paying girl. I mean to make you all respect me, so there!\"    \"That'll do, Spitfire,\" said Kate Rourke. \"The time is passing, and we  must get to the bottom of Susy Hopkins's remarkable address.--What's up,  Susy? What's up?\"    \"This,\" said Susy. \"You know the Irish girl who has come to live with  the Tennants?\"    \"Can't say I do,\" said Kate.    \"Well, you will soon. She's a regular out-and-out beauty.\"    \"I know her,\" cried Ruth Craven. \"She is most lovely.\"    \"She's better,\" said Susy; \"she's bewitching. See; she gave me this.\"  Here she pointed proudly to the Irish diamond brooch, which she had  stuck in the bosom of her dress. The diamond had been polished, and  flashed brightly; the silver setting was also as good as was to be  found. The girls crowded round to admire, and \"Oh, my!\" \"Oh, dear!\" \"Did  you ever?\" and \"Well, I never!\" sounded on all sides.    \"You will be so set up now, Susan Hopkins, that we won't be able to bear  you in the same class,\" said Clara Sawyer.    \"Go on,\" exclaimed Hannah Johnson--\"go on and tell us what you want.  Your horrid brooch doesn't interest us. What have you got to say?\"    \"You are mad with jealousy, and you know it,\" answered Susy. \"Well, I am  coming to the great news. The Irish girl's name is Kathleen O'Hara, and  she comes from a castle over in the wild west of Ireland. Her father is  very rich, and he keeps dogs and horses and carriages and--oh,  everything that rich people keep. Compared to the other girls in the  school, she is ten times a lady; and she has a true lady's heart. And  she has taken a dislike, as far as I can see, to Alice Tennant.\"    \"And I'm sure I'm not surprised,\" said Rosy Myers.    \"Stuck-up thing!\" said Clara Sawyer.    \"Dirt beneath our feet!\" exclaimed Hannah Johnson.    \"Well; she doesn't like her either, though she doesn't use that kind of  language,\" continued Susy. \"Anyhow, she wants to befriend _us_--Oh, do  let me speak!\"--as Kate interrupted with a hasty exclamation. \"She  thinks that we are just as good as herself. There is no false pride  about a real lady, girls; and the end of it is that she has a plan to  propose--something for our benefit and for her benefit. See for  yourselves; this is her letter. It is in her own beautiful Irish,  handwriting. You can read it, only don't tear it all to bits.\"    The girls did read the letter. They pressed close together, and one  peeped over the shoulder of her companion, another stood on tiptoe,  while a third tried to snatch the letter from the hand of her fellow;  but all managed to read the words: \"Get as many foundation girls as you  can to meet me, at whatever place you like to appoint, this evening. I  have a plan to propose.\" This letter and the end of the postscript  excited the girls; there was no doubt whatever of that. \"The plan is  _gloryious_.\" They laughed at the word, smiled into each others' faces,  and stood very close together consulting.    \"The old quarry,\" whispered Rosy.    \"That's the place!\" exclaimed Mary.    \"Let us meet her, we seven by ourselves,\" was Kate's final suggestion.  \"We will then know what she wants, and if there is anything in it. We  can form a committee, and get other girls to join by degrees. Hurrah! I  do say this is fun.\"    Susy was now quite petted by her companions. The conference hastily  ended, and on entering"]]]
