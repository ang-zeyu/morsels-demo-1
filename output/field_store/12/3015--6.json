The statues will alternate with beautiful little fountains, and  will form rows on each side of the avenue.           *       *       *       *       *    POWER'S STATUE OF EVE is now-having been rescued from the waters off the  coast of Spain--on the way to New York, and it will soon be here. The  Prince Demidoff has purchased the figure of the Greek Slave, originally  commenced for Mr. Robb of New Orleans, for L700, being L100 more than Mr.  Robb was to have given for it. The Prince has placed it in a room by  itself, in his palace at St. Donato, near Florence. He is one of the  finest critics of art now living, and his collection of masterpieces  constitutes to the man of taste one of the chief attractions of Italy.  From a letter of Powers now before us, we learn that the model of his  \"America\" was finished, and on the first of August the marble was about  to be commenced, in the same size. This the sculptor and his friends  think will be his greatest work. We are happy in being able to mention a  fact eminently honorable to a distinguished American gentleman, in this  connection. When the statue of Eve was lost, Powers wrote to the  underwriters to pay the insurance ($6000) to Mr. J.S. Preston of South  Carolina, upon whom the loss was to fall; but Mr. Preston instantly upon  hearing the circumstance directed that every cent of the money should  be sent to the artist, expressing only a regret that the country suffered  the loss of a performance so admirable. Mr. Powers had not at this time  heard of the loss of the statue of Mr. Calhoun. This great work has not  yet been recovered, but Mr. Kellogg has still hopes of its being rescued  in perfect safety.           *       *       *       *       *    The Venice _Statuto_ of the 13th August announces that Venice and Italy  have experienced an irreparable loss. The celebrated Barbarigo Gallery,  known for ages, comprised amongst other masterpieces seventeen paintings  of Titian, the Magdalen, Venus, St. Sebastian; the famous portraits of  the Doge Barbarigo, of Philip XIV., &c. After the extinction of the  Barbarigo family, Count Nicholas Giustiniani, the brothers Barbaco, and  the merchants Benetti, who became proprietors of the collection,  presented it to the Government. The Viceroy Raniere offered it for sale  in 1847 to the Austrian Government, which refused to buy it. It has been  lately purchased by the Court of Russia for five hundred and sixty  thousand francs.           *       *       *       *       *    PAINTING AND SCULPTURES of the early northern artists from the eighth to  the sixteenth century have just been discovered in great numbers in  Gothland, by Dr. Marilignis, of the Stockholm Royal Academy of Fine Arts.  He was sent to search for them by the Academy, and has spent eighteen  months in his mission. A large proportion of the pictures were found in  chapels built during the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and were covered  with thick coats of plaster, which had to be removed with great care. The  results of Dr. Marilignis' investigations will be published by the  Swedish Government.           *       *       *       *       *    THE INAUGURATION OF THE STATUE OF LARREY, the famous surgeon of the  Imperial army, at the Val-de-Grace, took place in Paris lately. Among the  assistants at this solemnity not the least interesting portion was a  corps of one hundred invalids upon whom Larrey had operated. The hero of  the day was Dupin, who walked in to the flourish of drums and trumpets at  the head of the commission of the monument. The statue of bronze, by  David, of Angers, was unvailed amid the clang of \"sonorous metal blowing  martial sounds.\" Old Dupin, in a fit of happy inspiration, jumped up on  the chair from which he presided, and delivered perhaps the best speech  he ever made. He drew, in lively touches, the mission of the man whose  hospital is the battle-field, of his intrepid coolness and humane  devotion. Larrey was wounded, while binding the wounds of others, in  Egypt and at Waterloo, in the days of glory and of disaster. The  President of the Assembly spoke with much feeling, and when he came down  from his chair a general rush was made by his friends to embrace him.           *       *       *       *       *    THE STANDISH GALLERY OF PICTURES in the Louvre was decreed by the French  courts, a few days before his death, to be the private property of the  late Louis Philippe. It was left to the king by Mr. Frank Hall Standish,  in 1838. The library of this collection is very valuable. It contains  among other rare books the Bible of Cardinal Ximenes, valued alone at  $5000. One of the last acts of Louis Philippe was to present it to the  French people. He was desirous only of vindicating his rights in the  courts. The gallery therefore will not be removed.           *       *       *       *       *    THE ANNUAL EXHIBITION OF PICTURES by Duesseldorf artists was opened in  that city about the middle of July. Landscapes are rather predominant. In  their line the works of Alexander Michelis, August Kossler, Weba and  Fischer are the best. Ten pictures of peasant life in Norway by Adolf  Tidemond, a Norwegian artist, are said to display very remarkable merit.  They were retained in the exhibition only a few days, being destined for  the royal chateau of Oskarshall. Of historical pictures there is nothing  worth mentioning.           *       *       *       *       *    The _Brussells Herald_ states that the artistic value of the works of art  contained in the churches of Antwerp, eleven in number, is by the late  financial report of the province estimated at 49,763,000 francs-nearly  ten millions of dollars.           *       *       *       *       *    LEUTZE'S PICTURE of Washington Crossing the Delaware is nearly finished  at Duesseldorf, and is much praised by several letter-writers who have  seen it.           *       *       *       *       *    MR.

The family of EDGAR A. POE was one of the oldest and most  reputable in Baltimore. David Poe, his paternal grandfather, was a  Quartermaster-General in the Maryland line during the Revolution, and the  intimate friend of Lafayette, who, during his last visit to the United  States, called personally upon the General's widow, and tendered her  acknowledgments for the services rendered to him by her husband. His  great-grandfather, John Poe, married in England, Jane, a daughter of  Admiral James McBride, noted in British naval history, and claiming  Kindred with some of the most illustrious English families. His father,  David Poe, jr., the fourth son of the Quartermaster-General, was several  years a law student in Baltimore, but becoming enamored of an English  actress, named Elizabeth Arnold, whose prettiness and vivacity more than  her genius for the stage made her a favorite, he eloped with her, and  after a short period, having married her, became himself an actor. They  continued six or seven years in the theaters of the principal cities, and  finally died, within a few weeks of each other, in Richmond, leaving  three children, Henry, Edgar, and Rosalie, in utter destitution.    Edgar Poe, who was born in Baltimore, in January, 1811, was at this  period of remarkable beauty, and precocious wit. Mr. John Allan, a  merchant of large fortune and liberal disposition, who had been intimate  with his parents, having no children of his own, adopted him, and it was  generally understood among his acquaintances that he intended to make him  the heir of his estate. The proud, nervous irritability of the boy's  nature was fostered by his guardian's well-meant but ill-judged  indulgence. Nothing was permitted which could \"break his spirit.\" He must  be the master of his masters, or not have any. An eminent and most  estimable gentleman of Richmond has written to me, that when Poe was only  six or seven years of age, he went to a school kept by a widow of  excellent character, to whom was committed the instruction of the  children of some of the principal families in the city. A portion of  the grounds was used for the cultivation of vegetables, and its invasion  by her pupils strictly forbidden. A trespasser, if discovered, was  commonly made to wear, during school hours, a turnip or carrot, or  something, of this sort, attached to his neck as a sign of disgrace. On  one occasion Poe, having violated the rules, was decorated with the  promised badge, which he wore in sullenness until the dismissal of the  boys, when, that the full extent of his wrong might be understood by his  patron, of whose sympathy he was confident, he eluded the notice of the  schoolmistress, who would have relieved him of his esculent, and made the  best of his way home, with it dangling at his neck. Mr. Allan's anger was  aroused, and he proceeded instantly to the school-room, and after  lecturing the astonished dame upon the enormity of such an insult to his  son and to himself, demanded his account, determined that the child  should not again be subject to such tyranny. Who can estimate the effect  of this puerile triumph upon the growth of that morbid self-esteem which  characterized the author in after life?    In 1816, he accompanied Mr. and Mrs. Allan to Great Britain, visited the  most interesting portions of the country, and afterward passed four or  five years in a school kept at Stoke Newington, near London, by the Rev.  Dr. Bransby. In his tale, entitled \"William Wilson,\" he has introduced a  striking description of this school and of his life here. He says:        \"My "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14451"],[0,"African Camp Fires (#11)"],[1,"not obscure the  white brilliance. The thermometer stood now only at 82 deg., but the  dripping tropical sweat-bath in which our camp was pitched considerably  raised the sensible heat. A bird with a most diabolical shrieking note  cursed in the shadows. Another, a pigeon-like creature, began softly,  and continued to repeat in diminishing energy until it seemed to have  run down, like a piece of clockwork.    Our way next morning led for some time through this lovely but damp  jungle. Then we angled up the side of a hill to emerge into the  comparatively open country atop what we Westerners would call a \"hog's  back\"--a long narrow spurlike ridge mounting slowly to the general  elevation of the main hills. Here were high green bushes, with little  free open passages between them, and occasionally meadow-like openings  running down the slopes on one side or the other. Before us, some miles  distant, were the rounded blue hills.    We climbed steadily. It was still very early morning, but already the  day was hot. Pretty soon we saw over the jungle to the gleaming waters  of the inlet, and then to the sea. Our \"hog's back\" led us past a ridge  of the hills, and before we knew it we had been deposited in a shallow  valley three or four miles wide between parallel ridges; the said valley  being at a considerable elevation, and itself diversified with rolling  hills, ravines, meadow land, and wide flats. On many of the ridges were  scattered cocoanut palms, and occasional mango groves, while many smokes  attested the presence of natives.    These we found in shambas or groups of little farms, huddled all  together, with wilderness and brush and trees, or the wide open green  grass lawn between. The houses were very large and neat-looking. They  were constructed quite ingeniously from coco branches. Each branch made  one mat. The leaves were all brought over to the same side of the stem,  and then plaited. The resulting mat was then six or seven feet long by  from twelve to sixteen inches broad, and could be used for a variety of  purposes. Indeed, we found Melville's chapter in \"Typhee\" as to the  various uses of the cocoanut palm by no means exaggerated. The nuts,  leaves, and fibre supplied every conceivable human want.    The natives were a pleasant, friendly, good-looking lot. In fact, so  like was their cast of countenance to that of the white-skinned people  we were accustomed to see that we had great difficulty in realizing that  they were mere savages, costume--or lack of it--to the contrary  notwithstanding. Under a huge mango tree two were engaged in dividing a  sheep. Sixty or seventy others stood solemnly around watching. It may  have been a religious ceremony, for all I know; but the affair looked to  be about two parts business to sixty of idle and cheerful curiosity. We  stopped and talked to them a little, chaffed the pretty girls--they were  really pretty--and marched on.    About noon our elegant guide stopped, struck an attitude, and pointed  with his silver-headed rattan cane.    \"This,\" said he, \"is where we must camp.\"    We marched through a little village. A family party sat beneath the  veranda of a fine building--a very old wrinkled couple; two stalwart  beautiful youths; a young mother suckling her baby; two young girls; and  eight or ten miscellaneous and naked youngsters. As the rest of the  village appeared to be empty, I imagined this to be the caretaker's  family, and the youngsters to belong to others. We stopped and spoke,  were answered cheerfully, suggested that we might like to buy chickens,  and offered a price. Instantly with a whoop of joy the lot of them were  afoot. The fowl waited for no further intimations of troublous times,  but fled squawking. They had been there before. So had our hosts; for  inside a minute they had returned, each with a chicken--and a broad  grin.    After due payment we proceeded on a few hundred yards, and pitched camp  beneath two huge mango trees.    Besides furnishing one of the most delicious of the tropical fruits,  the mango is also one of the most beautiful of trees. It is tall,  spreads very wide, and its branches sweep to within ten feet of the  ground. Its perfect symmetry combined with the size and deep green of  its leaves causes it to resemble, from a short distance, a beautiful  green hill. Beneath its umbrella one finds dense shade, unmottled by a  single ray of sunlight, so that one can lie under it in full confidence.  For, parenthetically, even a single ray of this tropical sunlight is to  the unprotected a very dangerous thing. But the leaves of the mango have  this peculiarity, which distinguishes it from all other trees--namely,  that they grow only at the very ends of the small twigs and branches. As  these, of course, grow only at the ends of the big limbs, it follows  that from beneath the mango looks like a lofty green dome, a veritable  pantheon of the forest.    We made our camp under one of these trees; gave ourselves all the space  we could use; and had plenty left over--five tents and a cook camp, with  no crowding. It was one of the pleasantest camps I ever saw. Our green  dome overhead protected us absolutely from the sun; high sweet grass  grew all about us; the breeze wandered lazily up from the distant  Indian Ocean. Directly before our tent door the slope fell gently away  through a sparse cocoanut grove whose straight stems panelled our view,  then rose again to the clear-cut outline of a straight ridge opposite.  The crest of this was sentinelled by tall scattered cocoanut trees, the  \"bursting star\" pyrotechnic effect of their tops being particularly fine  against the sky.    After a five hours' tropical march uphill we were glad to sit under our  green dome, to look at our view, to enjoy the little breeze, and to  drink some of the cocoanuts our friends the villagers brought in.    FOOTNOTES:    [3] \"The Land of Footprints.\"          X.    THE SABLE.      About three o'clock I began to feel rested and ambitious. Therefore I  called up our elegant guide and Memba Sasa, and set out on my first hunt  for sable. F. was rather more done up by the hard morning, and so did  not go along. The guide wore still his red tarboosh, his dark short  jacket, his saffron yellow nether garment--it was not exactly a  skirt--and his silver-headed rattan cane. The only change he made was to  tuck up the skirt, leaving his long legs bare. It hardly seemed  altogether a suitable costume for hunting; but he seemed to know what he  was about.    We marched along ridges, and down into ravines, and across gulleys  choked with brush. Horrible thickets alternated with and occasionally  surrounded open green meadows hanging against the side hills. As we  proceeded, the country became rougher, the ravines more precipitous. We  struggled up steep hills, fairly bucking our way through low growth that  proved all but impenetrable. The idea was to find a sable feeding in one  of the little open glades; but whenever I allowed myself to think of the  many adverse elements of the game, the chances seemed very slim. It took  a half-hour to get from one glade to the next; there were thousands of  glades. The sable is a rare shy animal that likes dense cover fully as  well if not better than the open. Sheer rank bull luck alone seemed the  only hope. And as I felt my strength going in that vicious struggle  against heavy brush and steep hills, I began to have very strong doubts  indeed as to that sable.    For it was cruel, hard work. In this climate one hailed a car or a  rickshaw to do an errand two streets away, and considered oneself quite  a hero if one took a leisurely two-mile stroll along the cliff heads at  sunset. Here I was, after a five-hour uphill march, bucking into brush  and through country that would be considered difficult going even in  Canada. At the end of twenty minutes my every garment was not wringing  but dripping wet, so that when I carried my rifle over my arm water ran  down the barrel and off the muzzle in a steady stream. After a bit of  this my knees began to weaken; and it became a question of saving  energy, of getting along somehow, and of leaving the actual hunting to  Memba Sasa and the guide. If they had shown me a sable, I very much  doubt if I could have hit it.    However, we did not see one, and I staggered into camp at dusk pretty  well exhausted. From the most grateful hot bath and clean clothes I  derived much refreshment. Shortly I was sitting in my canvas chair,  sipping a cocoanut, and describing the condition of affairs to F., who  was naturally very curious as to how the trick was done.    \"Now,\" I concluded, \"I know just about what I can and what I cannot do.  Three days more of this sort of work will feed me up. If we do not run  across a sable in that time, I'm afraid we don't get any.\"    \"Two days will do for me,\" said he.    We called up the guide and questioned him closely. He seemed quite  confident; and asserted that in this country sable were found, when they  were found at all, which was not often. They must be discovered in the  small grassy openings. We began to understand why so very few people get  sable.    We dismissed the guide, and sat quietly smoking in the warm soft  evening. The air was absolutely still save for various night insects and  birds, and the weird calling of natives across the valleys. Far out  towards the sea a thunderstorm flashed; and after a long interval the  rumblings came to us. So very distant was it that we paid it little  attention, save as an interesting background to our own still evening.  Almost between sentences of our slow conversation, however, it rushed up  to the zenith, blotting out the stars. The tall palms began to sway and  rustle in the forerunning breeze. Then with a swoop it was upon us, a  tempest of fury. We turned in; and all night long the heavy deluges of  rain fell, roaring like surf on an unfriendly coast.    By morning this had"]]]
