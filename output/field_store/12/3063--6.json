Despite the lateness of the hour at which he had  departed, he had had no thought of rest and was setting out in quest  of further evidence to point to the author of Sir Marcus's death. The  room was laden with tobacco smoke, for our conference had lasted more  than two hours, but dusk was very fully established and when presently  as I sat there in the dark contemplating the horrible labyrinth into  which my steps had drifted, Coates entered.    \"Ah, Coates,\" I said, \"light up.\"    He switched on the electric light and I saw layers of smoke--clouds  drifting from the open window towards the newly opened door.    \"Shall you be going out again to-night, sir?\" asked Coates, standing  rigidly to attention as was his custom when addressing me.    \"I think not, Coates,\" I replied. \"I have done enough for one day, but  I should be glad if you would ring up the New Avenue Theater and  inquire if Miss Merlin will speak to me. It will be about time now for  the performance to have finished.\"    \"Very good, sir,\" said Coates, and proceeded to make the call, whilst  I sat listlessly smoking and listening to his voice. Presently:    \"Miss Merlin did not appear to-night, sir,\" he announced: \"she is  indisposed.\"    \"I thought as much,\" I muttered. \"I could hardly have expected after  such a day of horror and excitement that she would have been capable  of appearing to-night. Ring up her flat, Coates,\" I added. \"I should  like to speak to her, for I know she is in great trouble.\"    \"Indeed, sir,\" Coates permitted himself to remark. \"Is it something to  do with the discovery at the docks this morning, sir?\"    \"It is, Coates,\" I replied. \"It is an utterly damnable business.\"    \"Indeed, sir,\" said Coates again, and went to the telephone.    Three minutes later I was talking to Isobel.    \"I find it utterly impossible to tell you what has happened,\" she  declared, \"since I saw you last. I feel incapable of thinking, and of  course it was quite out of the question for me to go to the theater  to-night. But it is not so bad as it might have been.\" She hesitated,  then: \"I was only able to give them very short notice unfortunately,  but from a selfish point of view, as you know--I was leaving the  stage--very shortly--\"    \"Yes,\" I answered dully, \"I know; but have you seen the police?\"    \"I have seen Inspector Gatton,\" she replied; \"but as he told me that  he was coming along to you, no doubt you know what took place.\"    \"No,\" I replied; \"he did not mention the visit, but you quite  recognize the fact, Isobel, that he does not regard you as being in  any way concerned in this ghastly affair.\"    \"He was awfully kind,\" she admitted; \"in fact I quite changed my  opinion regarding the methods of the police authorities after my  interview with Inspector Gatton; but although he was so extremely  tactful with me, I really cannot forgive him his suspicions, which he  was at scarcely any pains to disguise, regarding Eric.\"    \"Regarding Eric!\" I exclaimed.    \"Oh,\" continued Isobel, \"he may have concealed his views from you, as  he knows that you are--a friend of Eric's; but he was less careful  about concealing them from me. To all intents and purposes Eric is  under police surveillance!\"    \"But this is utterly incredible!\" said I. \"You don't mean to tell me,  Isobel, that Coverly has persisted in his silence respecting his  movements last night? If he has done so, in the circumstances he has  only himself to thank. Social position and everything else counts for  nothing when an inquiry concerning a murder is concerned. He knows  that perfectly well.\"    I think I spoke hotly, and certainly I spoke with a certain  indignation, for I very strongly resented Coverly's attitude in the  case, which could only add to the difficulties and sorrows of Isobel's  position.    Yet a moment afterwards I regretted that I had done so, for:    \"Are _you_ going to quarrel with me, too?\" she asked pathetically.    \"What do you mean? Who has been quarreling with you?\"    \"Eric quarreled with me fiercely at the solicitors' to-day, and when I  begged of him to be frank respecting his movements last night, his  attitude became\"--she hesitated--\"almost unbearable. He did not seem  to realize that I was only thinking of him, nor did he seem to realize  the construction which I might have placed upon his silence. I mean,  Jack, what can he possibly have to conceal?\"    Temporarily I felt myself to have become tongue-tied. What _could_ it  be that Coverly was concealing? The idea of complicity in the crime I  scouted; nothing could have induced me to believe it. Only one  explanation presented itself to my mind, as evidently it had presented  itself to Isobel's--another woman. However:    \"You may depend,\" I said, endeavoring to speak soothingly, \"that he  has some good and sufficient reason for this silence, and one which is  not in any way discreditable. Nevertheless he will have to reconsider  his attitude in the near future. Of course there are times when almost  every one of us would be hard put to it to establish an alibi if we  were called upon to do so--as regards witnesses of our movements, I  mean; but at least we can state roughly where we were during any hour  of the day, even if we have to trust to luck to find witnesses to  prove the truth of words. His attitude of silence, Isobel, is  ridiculous.\"    \"Have you seen the evening papers?\" she asked pathetically.    \"Some of them,\" I replied.    \"They have got my name in already,\" she continued, \"and my photograph  appears in one. It is outrageous how they leap at an opportunity for  scandal.\"    \"It will all be cleared up,\" I said, speaking with as much confidence  as I had at my command. \"You know and I know that Coverly is innocent  and I don't believe that Gatton thinks him guilty.\"    A while longer we talked and then I returned rather wearily to my  chair in the room where the air was still laden with tobacco fumes.    Without believing it to contain any very special significance as I had  supposed, but merely attracted by the strangeness of the passage, I  remembered how Gatton had harped upon Maspero's description of the  attributes of Bast. \"Sometimes she plays with her victim as with a  mouse,\" etc. The big book with its fine plates, several of them  representing cats similar to that which Gatton had left behind for my  more particular examination, still lay open upon the table, and I  reread those passages appertaining to the character of the  cat-goddess, which I had marked for Gatton's information. Scarce  noting what I read--for all the time I was turning over in my mind the  manifold problems of the case--I sat there for an hour perhaps, in  fact until I was interrupted by the entrance of Coates.    \"Shall you require me again to-night, sir?\" he inquired.    \"No,\" I replied; \"you had better turn in now, as in all probability we  shall be early afoot to-morrow, Coates. Inspector Gatton will probably  be calling for me.\"    \"Very good. Good-night, sir,\" said Coates; and performing a smart  about-turn, he walked out of the room.    I went on reading, not in quest of any particular information, but in  that idle mood when one reads anything, interesting or otherwise. For  a time I heard my conscientious batman fastening doors and windows as  was his nightly custom; then the door of his own room closed and I  heard him no more.    When I first became aware of the howling of distant dogs I know not;  but it was with a great start that I was aroused from my semi-reverie  by the ringing of the door-bell. I realized that I had sat much longer  than I had supposed. It was a quarter to one.    Gatton was my first thought; there must be an unexpected development  in the case calling in some way for my services. Coates was a sound  sleeper and evidently had not been awakened by the ringing of the  bell; therefore, arrayed as I was in pajamas, slippers and bath-robe  (for this, during the hot weather was my indoor costume) I walked out  along the little corridor, unbolted the front door and opened it.    A woman stood there.    For a moment I thought foolishly that it was Isobel, and my heart gave  a great leap. But the delusion was instantly dispelled when my visitor  spoke.    Her voice had a totally different tone from that of Isobel--it was a  low, almost caressing voice, with a vaguely husky note in it,  fascinating in a way, yet although I found myself unable to account  for the fact, vaguely uncanny--queer.    \"Please excuse me,\" she said. \"You will naturally wonder what has  brought a visitor to your door at this hour of the night, and indeed  my explanation is a strange one.\"    She glanced apprehensively over her shoulder as she spoke, out into  the darkness of the roadway. I observed that she was apparently in  evening dress and wore a very handsome cloak, having a thick silk  scarf so draped about her head and shoulders that her face was quite  concealed. Very clearly, now, I could hear the howling of dogs.    Instinct is a curious thing, and that which it prompted me to do at  the moment when I found myself confronting this strange woman was  promptly to awaken Coates! Honestly I was afraid of her and wished for  nothing better than to have the closed door between us. This was all  the more unaccountable as she had the appearance and manners of a  cultured woman, presenting indeed a figure of great elegance as she  stood there with her tall slender form outlined by the moonlight which  slanted down through the trees to form a scimitar of light upon the  path behind her.    Of course I could never have acted upon this singular instinct, but  the decision was taken out of my hands; for suddenly my visitor  uttered a low cry of fear, swayed dizzily and seemed about to fall.    Perforce I stepped forward to support her and before I knew what had  happened, she had tottered into the passage, resting heavily upon my  shoulder.    \"Close the door!\" she said in that low husky voice. \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15344"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Sophomore Year at High School (#11)"],[1,"Anne the next day the details of the meeting, and in some  measure prepared her for what would undoubtedly follow. Anne had laughed a  little at the account of Miriam's remarks regarding her father, and the  girls' evident disapproval of the theatrical profession.    \"How silly they are,\" she said to Grace, who felt secretly relieved to  know that Anne was not mortally hurt over Miriam's attack. \"They don't  know anything about professional people. Of course, there are plenty of  worthless actors, but some of them are really very fine men and women.  Miriam may abuse my family all she chooses, but I do feel unhappy to think  that those girls believe me dishonorable and under-handed.\"    \"They wouldn't if they had any sense,\" responded Grace hotly, \"I never  believed that those girls could be so snobbish. I always thought them  above such petty meanness. Don't pay any attention to them, Anne. They  aren't worth it. I am going to interview Julia Crosby and make her  acknowledge that she wasn't referring to you the other day. There is  something queer about it all. I believe that there is some kind of secret  understanding between Miriam and Julia; that this is a deliberate plot on  their part to injure you and humiliate me, and I shall find out the truth  before I am through.\"    \"But what has Julia Crosby against me?\" queried Anne, \"I hardly know her.\"    \"She hasn't forgotten the way David defended you at Mrs. Gray's Christmas  ball last year,\" answered Grace, \"Besides, you're a sophomore. Isn't that  a good enough reason?\"    \"I suppose it is,\" said Anne wearily.    Grace kept her word and hailed Julia Crosby on the following afternoon as  she was leaving the High School. It seemed a favorable opportunity for  Julia was alone.    \"Miss Crosby,\" said Grace coldly. \"I should like to speak to you about a  very important matter.\"    \"There's nothing to hinder you, Miss Harlowe,\" replied Julia brusquely.  \"I'm here. Are you sure that it really is important?\"    She stopped and eyed Grace insolently.    \"I am very sure that it is important, Miss Crosby,\" said Grace. \"Not long  ago a certain sophomore overheard you telling a member of your class that  we sophomores could thank a girl in our class for our basketball defeat. A  certain girl had already been unjustly accused of betraying our signals.  When your remark was repeated to the team, they immediately decided that  you meant her. Since then her classmates have taken the matter up and are  determined to cut her acquaintance.\"    \"Well what has all this childish prattle to do with me?\" demanded Julia  rudely.    \"It has this to do with you, that you can set the matter right by saying  it was not Anne. You know perfectly well she had nothing to do with it. I  don't know how you got those signals, but I do know that Anne never gave  them to you.\"    \"Did I say that she did?\" asked Julia.    \"No,\" said Grace, \"neither did you say that she didn't.\"    \"Very true,\" replied Julia in a disagreeable tone, \"and I don't intend to  say so either. She may or she may not have given them to me. I'll never  tell. She's a snippy, conceited, little prig, and a little punishment for  her sins will do her good.\"    \"You are a cruel, heartless girl,\" cried Grace angrily. \"Knowing Anne to  be innocent, you refuse to clear her name of the suspicion resting upon  it. Let me tell you one thing. I know who tripped me the day of the game,  and so does Anne. If you don't clear Anne instantly, I shall go straight  to Miss Thompson with it.\"    Grace's threat went home. Julia stood in actual dread of the principal. It  looked as though the tables had been turned at last. If Grace went to Miss  Thompson what a commotion there would be!    In a moment, however, Julia recovered herself. What was it Miss Thompson  had said about rough play? Ah, Julia remembered now, and with the  recollection of the principal's words came the means of worsting Grace  Harlowe in her efforts to vindicate Anne.    \"You may go to Miss Thompson if you think it wise,\" she said with a  malicious smile, \"but I wouldn't advise it--that is, unless you have  gotten over caring for basketball.\"    \"What do you mean?\" asked Grace. Then like a flash she understood. If she  should tell Miss Thompson the truth, the principal would believe her.  Julia would receive her just deserts but, oh, bitter thought, there would  be no more basketball that season.    Grace felt that she had no right to sacrifice the pleasure of so many  others, even for Anne's sake. It would only increase the feeling against  both Anne and herself, and after all, Julia might still hold out in her  insinuations against Anne.    \"How can you be so contemptible?\" she said to her smiling enemy. \"You  never win anything honestly. I see it is useless for me to appeal to you  for something which you cannot give, and that is fair play!\" With a slight  bow, Grace walked quickly away, leaving Julia a little astonished at her  sudden departure and not at all pleased at Grace's frankly expressed  opinion.    Grace lost no time in relating to Anne her fruitless interview with the  junior captain.    \"I am so humiliated to think I failed. I expected that threatening to tell  Miss Thompson would bring her to her senses, but she is too cunning for  me,\" sighed Grace.    The two girls were walking home from school.    \"Shall you tell Nora and Jessica?\" asked Anne.    \"No,\" said Grace. \"Let us keep the sprained ankle part of the story a  secret. They are loyal to you, at any rate, and Nora would be so angry. I  am afraid I couldn't keep her from going straight to Miss Thompson and  making a general mess of things. I am so sorry, Anne, dear, but I guess we  shall have to weather the gale together. It will die out after a while,  just as all those things do. Hush! Don't say anything now. Here come Nora  and Jessica.\"    \"What do you think!\" cried Nora. \"Edna Wright is giving a party next  Saturday, and she isn't going to invite either you or Anne.\"    \"How shocking!\" said Grace. \"We shall both die of grief at having been  slighted.\"    She spoke lightly, and no one but Anne guessed how much the news hurt her.    \"We are not going,\" declared Nora, \"and we told her so.\"    \"What did she say?\" asked Grace.    \"We didn't give her time to answer,\" said Nora, \"but rushed off to find  you. The whole thing is perfectly ridiculous! The idea of a lot of silly  little school girls thinking they own the earth. It's all Miriam's fault.  She has tried to be leader of her class ever since it was organized but  mark what I say, she'll never accomplish it. Pride will get a fall, one of  these days, and I hope I'll be around when it happens.\"    \"Never mind, Nora,\" said Grace soothingly. \"Anne and I don't care. We'll  give a party at the same time, to our own crowd. I'll tell you what we'll  do. We will have a surprise party for Mrs. Gray. I'll write to Tom Gray  and ask him to come down for next Saturday. That will be a double surprise  to dear Mrs. Gray.\"    \"Fine!\" cried Jessica. \"We'll have Hippy and Reddy and David. Then our  circle will be complete. The other crowd will be furious. Those boys are  all popular, and I know that Edna intends to invite them.\"    \"Let's tell them at once, then,\" said Nora, \"before the other girls get a  chance.\"    The boys were promptly invited. Grace sent a note to Tom Gray, who found  it possible to get away for the week end.    Reddy, Hippy and David received invitations to the other party, but  politely declined. Miriam endeavored to point out to her brother the folly  of his conduct, but David simply stared at her and said nothing. He knew  to what lengths her jealousy had carried her during the freshman year, and  although Nora had entirely omitted his sister's name from the conversation  when telling him of the recent trouble that had arisen, still David felt  that Miriam was at the bottom of it.    Failing to elicit any response from her brother, she flew into a rage and  did not speak to him for a week, while David went serenely on his way,  and let her get over it as best she might.    The surprise party proved a success. Mrs. Gray's delight at seeing her  \"Christmas children\" and having her beloved nephew with her was worth  seeing. The young people did all the \"stunts\" they knew for her  entertainment, and the boys repeated their Shakespearian performance for  the old lady, who laughed until she could laugh no more.    It was their turn to be surprised, however, when the old butler suddenly  appeared and announced that supper was served. Mrs. Gray had held a word  of conversation with him directly after their arrival, which resulted in  an array of good things calculated to tempt the appetite of any healthy  boy or girl.    After supper they had an old-fashioned \"sing,\" with Jessica at the piano,  ending with \"Home, Sweet Home\" and the inevitable \"Good Night, Ladies.\"    \"I'm sure we had a better time than the other crowd,\" said Nora as they  all walked down the street.    \"Of course,\" said Grace, but a little feeling of sadness swept over her as  she realized for the first time in her short life she had been slighted by  any of her school friends.          CHAPTER X    THE SOPHOMORE BALL      It was the night of the sophomore ball. For a week past the class had been  making preparations. The gymnasium had been transformed into a veritable  bower of beauty. Every palm in Oakdale that could be begged, borrowed or  rented was used for the occasion. Drawing rooms had been robbed of their  prettiest sofa cushions and hangings, to make attractive cosy corners in  the big room.    The walls were decorated with evergreens and class banners, while the  class colors, red and gold, were everywhere in evidence. The sophomores  had been recklessly extravagant in the matter of cut flowers, and bowls of  red roses and carnations ornamented the various tables, loaned by fond  mothers for the gratification of sophomore vanity.    The girls had worked hard"]]]
