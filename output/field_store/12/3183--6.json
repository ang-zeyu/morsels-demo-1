Whilst the kings of France  continued to reside in other cities, Paris was confided to the  governments Counts, who held not a very high rank amongst the nobility  in the first instance, but gradually increased their power until Eudes,  Count of Paris, in 922 ultimately became King of France, which also was  the destiny of two other nobles who held the same title, Robert the  brother of Eudes, and Hugh Capet.    The progress of Paris and indeed the whole of France was retarded  continually by famine, fourteen seasons of scarcity happening in the  course of twenty-three years; in fact, from 843 to 899 such was often  the state of desolation, that hunger impelled human beings to murder  each other to feed upon the flesh of their bodies, which in many  instances were sold, and bought with eagerness by those who were  famishing with want. Unwholesome food caused thousands to be afflicted  with a disease which was called the sacred fire, the ardent malady, and  the infernal evil, the sufferers feeling as if they were devoured by an  internal flame. To give some idea of the luxury of costume which existed  in those days at Paris, it is but requisite to quote an address of Abbon  the poet to the Parisians, written about the year 890, wherein hen  observes: \"An _agraffe_ (a clasp) of gold fastens the upper part of  your dress; to keep off the cold you cover yourselves with the purple  of Tyre, you will have no other cloak than a chlamyde embroidered with  gold, your girdle must be ornamented with precious stones, and gold  must sparkle even upon your shoes, and on the cane which you carry. O  France! if you do not abandon such luxurious extravagance, you will  lose your courage and your country.\" Hugh Capet, who became king of  France in 987, fixed his residence at Paris, thus again constituting it  the capital of the kingdom, and his son and successor Robert, being a  strict devotee, built and repaired several churches which had been  greatly injured by the Normans, and Paris began in his reign to assume  an appearance of improvement, which continued until it received a check  from an ill-timed joke of Philippe the First, who made a satirical  remark upon William the Conqueror of England having become rather  unwieldy, which so provoked that choleric monarch that he laid waste a  great portion of Philippe's dominions; when his progress was checked by  his falling from his horse, which occasioned his death and thus  delivered Philippe from a most powerful enemy. In the following reign,  that of Lewis the Fat, learning began to make considerable progress, and  the colleges of Paris to acquire a high celebrity, and amongst the  professors whose reputation was of the highest, was Abelard, no one  before having succeeded in attracting so many pupils. In 1118 he  established a school in Paris, but from a variety of persecutions which  he endured, he was frequently obliged to retire to different parts of  France; his unfortunate attachment to Heloise is but too well known, and  she ultimately became the abbess of a convent which Abelard founded at  Nogent-sur-Seine, and which he called Paraclet. The number of pupils at  one time are stated to have been three thousand, and he instructed them  in the open air; it is also asserted that of his followers fifty became  either bishops or archbishops, twenty cardinals, and one pope, Celestin  II. In fact the fame of Abelard had arrived at such an altitude that he  was the means of giving a new era to Paris, which was designated the  city of letters; other professors became highly celebrated, and some  authors pretend that the immense concourse of students who ultimately  flocked to Paris, exceeded the number of the inhabitants, and there was  much difficulty in finding the means of lodging them; how great must  have been the anxiety for learning, as the masters were exceedingly  brutal and imparted their knowledge to the pupil by the force of blows,  which at length deterred many students from placing themselves under the  charge of such preceptors. This extraordinary desire for obtaining  education appears to have been almost a sudden impulse, as the immediate  descendants of Hugh Capet could not read or write, but were obliged to  make a mark as the signature to their edicts, whilst those who possessed  that accomplishment were styled clerks. Although much brilliance was  shed over the reign of Louis the Sixth by the learning of Abelard and  the professors who followed him, yet soon after the barbarous custom was  introduced of trial by combat; the idea might probably have been  suggested by Louis having challenged Henry the First of England to  decide their differences in a single encounter. Although Lewis the Fat  was so bulky as to have obtained the cognomen by which he was always  designated, he was one of the most active kings of France; constantly  harrassed by perpetual wars with his neighbours and nobles, which he  carried on personally and generally successfully, he first undertook the  fortifying of Paris and is supposed to have constructed the greater and  the lesser Chatelet, two towers on the opposite sides of the Seine,  although many authors pretend that they were of a much more ancient  date; he also built walls round a certain portion of the suburbs, which  by that time had become part of Paris. It was said of Lewis VI, \"He  might have been a better king, a better man he could not.\" He died in  1137.    In the succeeding reign of Louis VII, surnamed the Younger, many  privileges were granted to the Parisians which greatly increased the  prosperity of the city; several public buildings were erected, amongst  the rest an hospital which was the first ever built in Paris. But  according to the descriptions of all authors who wrote at that period  upon the subject, the streets were in a filthy condition in many parts  of the city, and the names which have long since been changed were as  dirty and indecent; some were absolutely ridiculous; as Did you find me  Hard, Bertrand Sleeps, Cut Bread, John Bread Calf (alluding to the leg);  the last still exists, as also Bad Advice, Bad Boys, etc. It was in this  reign that the first crusade from France took place, and Louis VII was  followed by 200,000 persons, and after various encounters with the  Saracens, he owed his preservation to his own personal prowess; he was  divorced from his Queen Eleanor, who afterwards married Henry II of  England, and proved herself a detestable character in both kingdoms.  Louis VII abolished one law which had long disgraced France, allowing  the officers of the King on his arrival in Paris or other towns in his  dominions, to enter any private house and take for the monarch's use  such bedding or other articles of furniture as his Majesty might  require. Louis also by force of arms compelled his nobles to desist from  robbing the merchants, dealers, and the poor of their property. At this  period the _Fete des Fous_, or feast of madmen was celebrated to its  full extent, and anything more absurd, more farcical, or more  irreverential cannot well be imagined. Dulaure, in his voluminous  History of Paris, gives a most detailed account of this extraordinary  mockery, of which I will give my readers a very brief abridgment.    On the first of January the clergy went in procession to the bishop who  had been elected as the grand master of the fete, conducting him  solemnly to the church with all the ecclesiastical banners usually borne  on important occasions, amidst the ringing of bells; when arrived at the  choir, he was placed in the episcopal seat, and mass was performed with  the most extravagant gesticulations. The priests figuring away in the  most ridiculous dresses; some in the costume of buffoons, others in  female attire with their faces daubed with soot, or covered with hideous  masks, some dancing, others jumping, or playing different games,  drinking, and eating puddings, sausages, etc., offering them to the  high-priest whilst he was celebrating high mass; also burning old shoes  in the chalice, instead of incense, to produce a disagreeable scent; at  length, elevated by wine, their orgies began to have the appearance of  those of demons, roaring, howling, singing, and laughing until the walls  of the church echoed with their yells. This was often carried on until  they worked themselves up to a pitch of madness, and then they began  boxing each other until the floor of the church would be smeared with  blood; upon which most severe expiations were exacted from them; as,  however, much has been shed in the cause of the church, it was not to be  permitted that the holy sanctuary should ever be stained with aught so  impure. The ecclesiastics at last quitting the church, got into carts  filled with mud and filth, amusing themselves with flinging it upon the  crowds who followed them in such streets as were wide enough for a cart  to pass. It is conjectured that these festivities, with their  nonsensical ceremonies, were of pagan origin, and probably the  celebration of the Carnival is derived from the same source; many  attempts were made to abolish so disgraceful a custom as the continuance  of the Fetes des Fous, with the absurdities incidental to its revelries,  but it was not until the Parisians became more enlightened that any  monarch could succeed in its entire suppression.    In 1180 Philippe Auguste succeeded his father, and did more for Paris  than all the works of his predecessors united; he reconstructed Notre  Dame, and made it such as it now is with respect to the grand body of  the building; but the variety of little chapels contained within it, and  the elaborate workmanship, with the bas, mezzo and alto relievos with  which it abounds, occupied two centuries. On the exterior of the  building on the south side, about three feet and a half from the ground,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17763"],[0,"The Mystery of the Hasty Arrow (#11)"],[1," arms  went suddenly up and she fell--backward--the arrow showing in her breast.  If I told the story a hundred times, I could not tell it differently.\"    \"We do not wish you to, Mr. Travis. Only there must be somewhere in your  mind a recollection of the angle which her body presented to the railing  as she came forward.\"    The unhappy man shook his head, at which token of helplessness Mr. Gryce  beckoned to Sweetwater and whispered a few words in his ear. The man  nodded and withdrew, going the length of the gallery, where he  disappeared among the arches, to reappear shortly after in the gallery  opposite. When he reached Section II, Mr. Gryce again addressed the  witness, who, to his surprise and to that of the Coroner as well, had  become reabsorbed in his own thoughts to the entire disregard of what  this movement might portend. It took a sharp word to rouse him.    \"I am going to ask you to watch the young man who has just shown himself  on the other side, and tell us to what extent his movements agree with  those made by the young lady prior to her collapse and fall to the  floor.\"    For an instant indignation robbed the stranger of all utterance. Then he  burst forth:    \"You would make a farce of what is so sad and dreadful, and she scarcely  cold! It is dishonoring to the young lady. I cannot look at that young  man--that hideous young man--and think of her and of how she looked and  walked the instant before her death.\"    The two officials smiled; they could not help it. Sweetwater was  certainly no beauty, and to associate him in any kind of physical  comparison with the dead girl was certainly incongruous. Yet they both  felt that the point just advanced by them should be settled and settled  now while the requisite remembrance was fresh in the mind of this  invaluable witness. But in order to get at what they wanted, some show  of consideration for his feelings was evidently necessary. Police  persistence often defeats its own ends. If he was to be made to do what  they wished, it would have to be through the persuasion of some one  outside the Force. To whom should they appeal? The question answered  itself. Mr. Roberts was approaching from the front, and to him they  turned. Would he use his influence with this stranger?    \"He may listen to you,\" urged the Coroner in the whispered conference  which now followed, \"if you explain to him how much patience you and all  the rest of the people in the building have had to exercise in this  unhappy crisis. He seems a good enough fellow, but not in line with our  ideas.\"    Mr. Roberts, who saw the man for the first time, surveyed him in  astonishment.    \"Where was he standing?\" he asked.    \"Just where you see him now--or so he says.\"    \"He couldn't have been. Some one would have observed him--the woman who  was in the compartment with the stricken girl, or the man studying coins  in the one next to it.\"    \"So it would seem,\" admitted the Coroner. \"But if he were behind the  pedestal----\"    \"Behind the pedestal!\"    \"That's where we think he was. But no matter about that now!--we can  explain that to you later. At present all we want is for you to reassure  him.\"    Not altogether pleased with his task, but seeing no good reason for  declining it, the affable director approached the Englishman, who,  recognizing one of his own social status, seemed to take heart and turn  a willing ear to Mr. Roberts' persuasions. The result was satisfactory.    When the Coroner again called Mr. Travis' attention to Sweetwater  awaiting orders in the opposite gallery he did not refuse to look, though  his whole manner showed how much he was affected by this forced  acquiescence in their plans.    \"You will watch the movements of the young man we have placed over  there,\" the Coroner had said; \"and when he strikes a position  corresponding to that taken by the young lady at the moment she was shot,  lift up your hand, thus. I will not ask you to speak.\"    \"But you forget that there is blood on that floor. That man will step in  it. I cannot lend myself to such sacrilege. It is wrong. Let the lady be  buried first.\"    The outburst was so natural, the horror so unfeigned, that not only the  men he addressed but all within hearing showed the astonishment it  caused.    \"One would think you knew the victim of this random shot!\" the Coroner  intimated with a fresh and close scrutiny of this very reluctant witness.  \"Did you? Was she a friend of yours?\"    \"No, no!\" came in quick disavowal. \"No friend. I have never exchanged a  word with her--never.\"    \"Then we will proceed. One cannot consider sensibilities in a case like  this.\" And he made a signal to Sweetwater, who turned his body this way  and that.    The distressed Englishman watched these movements with slowly dilating  eyes.    \"It's the angle we want--the angle at which she presented her body to the  gallery front,\" explained the relentless official.    A shudder, then the rigidity of fixed attention, broken in another  moment, however, by an impulsive movement and the unexpected question:    \"Is it to find the man who did it that you are enacting this horrible  farce?\"    Somewhat startled, the Coroner retorted:    \"If you object on that account----\"    But Mr. Travis as vehemently exclaimed:    \"But I don't! I want the man caught. One should not shoot arrows about in  a place where there are beautiful young women. I want him caught and  punished.\"    As they were all digesting this unexpected avowal, they saw his hand go  up. The Coroner gave a low whistle, and the detective in obedience to it  stood for one instant stock-still--then bent quickly to the floor.    \"What is he doing?\" cried Mr. Travis.    \"Yes, what is he doing?\" echoed Mr. Roberts.    \"Running a mark about his shoes to fix their exact location,\" was the  grim response.          VII    \"YOU THINK THAT OF ME!\"      \"We're certainly up against it this time,\" were the words with which Dr.  Price led the detective down the gallery. \"What sort of an opinion can a  man form of a fellow like that? Is he fool or knave?\"    Mr. Gryce showed no great alacrity in answering. When he did speak it was  to say:    \"We shall have to go into the matter a little more deeply before we can  trust our judgment as to his complete sincerity. But if you want to know  whether I believe him to have loosed the arrow which killed that innocent  child, I am ready from present appearances to say yes. Who else was there  to do it? He and he only was on the spot. But it was a chance action,  without intention or wish to murder. No man, even if he were a fool,  would choose such a place or such a means for murder.\"    \"That's true; but how does it help to call it accident? Accident calls  for a bow in hand, an arrow within reach, an impulse to try one's skill  at a fancied target. Now the arrow--whatever may be said of the bow--was  not within the reach of anyone standing in this gallery. The arrow came  from the wall at the base of which this young woman died. It had to be  brought from there here. That does not look like accident, but crime.\"    Yet as the Coroner uttered this acknowledgment, he realized as plainly as  Mr. Gryce how many incongruous elements lay in the way of any such  solution of the mystery. If they accepted the foreigner's account of  himself,--which for some reason neither seemed ready to dispute,--into  what a maze of improbabilities it at once led them! A stranger just  off ship! The victim a mere schoolgirl! The weapon such an unusual one as  to be _outre_ beyond belief. Only a madman--But there! Travis had less  the appearance of a lunatic than Mrs. Taylor. It must have been an  accident as Gryce said; and yet--    If there is much virtue in an _if_, there is certainly a modicum  of the same in a _yet_, and the Coroner, in full recognition of this  stumbling-block, remarked with unusual dryness:    \"I agree with you that some half-dozen questions are necessary before we  wade deeper into this quagmire. Where shall we go to have it out?\"    \"The Curator will allow us to use his office. I will see that Mr. Travis  joins us there.\"    \"See that he comes before he has a chance to fall into one of his  reveries.\"    But quickly as Mr. Gryce worked, he was not speedy enough to prevent the  result mentioned. The man upon whose testimony so much hinged did not  even lift his eyes when brought again into their presence.    The Coroner, in his determination to be satisfied on this point, made  short work of rousing him from his abstraction. With a few leading  questions he secured his attention and then without preamble or apology  asked him with what purpose he had come to America and why he had been so  anxious to visit the museum that he hastened directly to it from the  steamer without making an effort to locate himself in some hotel.    The ease with which this apparently ingenuous stranger had managed to  meet the opening queries of this rough-and-ready official was suddenly  broken. He stammered and turned red and made so many abortive attempts to  reply that the latter grew impatient and finally remarked:    \"If the truth will incriminate you, you are quite justified in holding it  back!\"    \"Incriminate me!\" With the repetition of this alarming word, a change of  the most marked character took place in young Travis' manner. \"What does  that mean?\" he asked. \"I am not sure that I understand your use of that  word _incriminate_.\"    Dr. Price explained himself, to the seeming horror of the startled  Englishman.    \"You think that of me!\" he cried, \"of me, who----\"    But here indignation made him speechless, till some feeling stronger  than the one subduing him to silence forced him again into speech, and  he supplemented in broken tones: \"I am only a stranger to you and  consequently am willing to pardon your misconception of my character and  the principles by which I regulate my life. I have a horror of crime and  all violence; besides,"]]]
