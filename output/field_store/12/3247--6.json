But, alas! the traveler  soon finds that this ceremony of words does not extend to deeds. He is  never expected to call for the services so pompously proffered. So long  as he stays in Quito he will not lose sight of the contrast between big  promise and beggarly performance. This outward civility, however, is not  hypocritical; it is mere mechanical prattle; the speaker does not expect  to be taken at his word. The love of superlatives and the want of good  faith may be considered as prominent characteristics. \"The readiness  with which they break a promise or an agreement (wrote Colonel Hall  forty years ago) can only be equaled by the sophistical ingenuity with  which they defend themselves for having done so.\" The Quitonians, who  are sensible of their shortcomings, have this standing apology: \"Our  vices we owe to Spain; our virtues to ourselves.\"[26]    [Footnote 26: \"When speaking of these countries, the manner in which  they have been brought up by their unnatural parent, Spain, should  always be borne in mind. On the whole, perhaps, more credit is due for  what has been done, than blame for that which may be  deficient.\"--_Darwin's Journal of Researches_, p. 158.]    Such is the mutual distrust, partnerships are almost unknown; we do not  remember a single commercial firm, save a few made up of brothers, or  father and son. With this moral debility is joined the procrastinating  spirit of the oriental. _Manana_ (to-morrow), like the _Boukra_ of the  Arabs, is the universal winding up of promises. And very often, if one  promises a thing to-morrow, he means the day after that. It is  impossible to start a man into prompt compliance; he will not commence a  piece of work when you wish nor when he promises. No amount of cajolery,  bribery, or threats will induce a Quitonian to do any thing or be any  where in season. If there were a railroad in Ecuador, every body would  be too late for the first train. There are only one or two watch-tinkers  in the great city, and, as may be inferred, very few watches are in  running order. As a consequence, the people have very little idea of  time. But this is not the sole reason for their dilatoriness; they are  indifferent. Nobody seems to want to make money (though all are in sad  need of it); nobody is in a hurry; nobody is busy save the tailors, who  manifest a commendable diligence. Contempt for labor, a Spanish  inheritance, and lack of energy, are traits which stand out in _alto  relievo_.    One can form his own judgment of the spiritless people from the single  statement which we have from Dr. Jameson, that during the last forty  years not ten Quitonians have visited the grand crater of Pichincha,  though it is possible to ride horseback to its very edge. Plenty of  gentlemen by profession walk the streets and cathedral terrace, proud as  a Roman senator under his toga, yet not ashamed to beg a cup of coffee  at the door of a more fortunate fellow-citizen. Society is in a constant  struggle between ostentation and want.    Nature has done more for Ecuador than for Ecuadorians. She laid out this  beautiful valley for an Elysian field; \"de Quito al Cielo\" (from Quito  to Heaven) is not an empty adage; and it is painful to look upon  tottering walls and impassable roads, upon neglected fields and an idle  population--poor as poverty in the lap of boundless natural wealth. The  only really live man in the republic is the president, Senor G. Garcia  Moreno, a man of wide views and great energy, standing in these respects  head and shoulders above his fellow-citizens. Quito and Quito Valley owe  nearly all their improvements to this one man.    It is easy to say what would be the industry of a people who spend much  of their time repeating traditions of treasures buried by the Incas, and  stories of gold deposits in the mountains. Of commerce there is scarcely  enough to deserve the name. Quito is an ecclesiastical city, and is  nearly supported by Guayaquil. Without capital, without energy, without  business habits, Quitonians never embark in grand commercial schemes  and industrial enterprises. There is not a highway for commerce in any  direction, only a natural path (called by the innocent natives a road),  which rises to the altitude of fourteen thousand feet, by which the  beasts of burden pick their way over the Cordillera. And this is open  only six months in the year. Should a box designed for Quito arrive at  Guayaquil at the beginning of the rainy season, it must tarry half a  year till _Nature_ makes the road passable.    The unstable condition of the country does not encourage great  undertakings; all business is periodically paralyzed by revolution.  Merchants generally buy their goods in Lima, to which city and Guayaquil  the fabrics of England and France are brought by foreigners in foreign  ships. The shops of Quito, as we have remarked, are very small, without  windows, and with only one wooden door. The door is double, and is  fastened by a ponderous padlock. They are open from 7 A.M. till sunset,  excepting between nine and ten and between three and four, when the  stores are closed for breakfast and dinner; the merchants never trusting  their clerks, even when they have any, which is not usually the case.  They have no fixed price, but get what they can. The majority know  nothing of wholesale, and refuse to sell by the quantity, fearing a  cheat. An Indian woman will sell you a real's worth of oranges any  number of times, but she would object to parting with a dollar's  worth--her arithmetic can not comprehend it.    In the _portals_ or arcades of the Aguirre mansion and the nuncio's  palace are the stalls of the haberdashers. Articles are not wrapped in  paper; customers must get them home the best way they can. Ladies of the  higher class seldom go out shopping, but send for samples. It is  considered disgraceful to either sex to be seen carrying any thing  through the streets of Quito. The common people buy only for immediate  wants--a dose of medicine, or a handful of potatoes at a time. Nearly  all liquids, kerosene as well as wine, are sold by the bottle.    There was no bank in Quito in 1867, but an attempt has just been made to  establish one. The paper money of Guayaquil is often at nine per cent.  discount in the capital. The currency is silver adulterated with one  third of copper. The smallest coin, the cale, is worth about two and a  half cents. Above that are medios (five cents), reals (ten cents), two,  four, and eight reals. Eight reals make a soft dollar ($0 80); ten  reals, a hard dollar ($1 00). There is no copper coin--oranges and  loaves of bread are sometimes used to make change; and nearly all the  gold in circulation are New Granada _condors_ and Peruvian _onzas_. Many  of the silver pieces have large holes cut in the centre, so that they  resemble rings. Government set the example (and the people followed) on  the plea that it would prevent the exportation of coin. The plan has  succeeded, for it does not pass out of the valley.    Nearly the only sign of progress is the late introduction of the grape  and silk-worm; and these give so much promise of success that the  threadbare nobility have already begun to count their coming fortunes.  Husbandry is more pastoral than agricultural. Thousands of cattle are  raised on the paramos, but almost wholly for beef. \"A dislike to milk  (observes Humboldt), or at least the absence of its use before the  arrival of Europeans, was, generally speaking, a feature common to all  nations of the New Continent, as likewise to the inhabitants of China.\"  Some cheese (mostly unpressed curd) and a little butter are made, but in  the patriarchal style. Only one American churn is in operation; the  people insist upon first boiling the milk and then stirring with a  spoon. Custom is omnipotent here, and its effects hereditary. Milking is  done at any hour of the day, or whenever milk is wanted. The operation  is a formidable one to these bull-fighting people. Stopping at a  hacienda near Pelileo for a drink of milk, we were eye-witness of a  comical sight. A mild-looking cow was driven up to the door; the woman,  evidently the bravest member of the household, seized the beast by the  horns; a boy tied the hind legs with a long rope, and held on to one end  of it at a respectful distance; while the father, with outstretched  arms, milked into a calabash.    Agricultural machinery is not in use. The first threshing-machine Quito  ever saw was made in 1867 by some California miners, but it remained  unsold when we last saw it. The spade is not known; the nearest approach  to it is a crowbar flattened at one end. Hoes are clumsy and awkward.  Yankee plows are bought more as curiosities than for use. Many a crooked  stick is seen scratching the land, as in Egypt, which the cattle drag by  their horns. Sometimes a number of sharp-nosed hogs are tied together  and let into a field, and driven from place to place till the whole is  rooted up. Corn is planted by making holes in the ground with a stick,  and dropping in the seed. The soil and climate of Ecuador, so infinitely  varied, offer a home to almost every useful plant. The productions of  either India could be naturalized on the lowlands, while the highlands  would welcome the grains and fruits of Europe. But intertropical people  do not subdue nature like the civilized men of the North; they only pick  up a livelihood.    Spanish Americans, like Castilians on the banks of the Tagus, have a  singular antipathy to trees. When Garcia Moreno made a park of the dusty  Plaza Mayor, he was ridiculed, even threatened. To plant a fruit or  shade tree (a thing of foresight and forethought for others) in a land  where people live for self, and from hand to mouth, is considered  downright folly in theory and practice. A large portion of the valley,  left treeless, is becoming less favorable for cultivation.

Si autem ex veneratione magna percipere non       praesumitur, laudanda est.\" Augustine asks, \"Si post       illusionem, quae par somnum solet accidere, vel corpus       Domini quilibet accipere valeat; vel, si sacerdos sit, sacra       mysteria celebrare?\" Gregory answers this learned question       by many learned distinctions.]    And as the pagans practised sacrifices, and feasted with the priests on  their offerings, he also exhorted the missionary to persuade them, on  Christian festivals, to kill their cattle in the neighborhood of the  church, and to indulge themselves in those cheerful entertainments to  which they had been habituated.[*] These political compliances  show that, notwithstanding his ignorance and prejudices, he was  not unacquainted with the arts of governing mankind. Augustine was  consecrated archbishop of Canterbury, was endowed by Gregory with  authority over all the British churches, and received the pall, a badge  of ecclesiastical honor, from Rome.[**] Gregory also advised him not  to be too much elated with his gift of working miracles;[***] and as  Augustine, proud of the success of his mission, seemed to think himself  entitled to extend his authority over the bishops of Gaul, the  pope informed him that they lay entirely without the bounds of his  jurisdiction.[****]    The marriage of Ethelbert with Bertha, and, much more his embracing  Christianity, begat a connection of his subjects with the French,  Italians, and other nations on the continent, and tended to reclaim them  from that gross ignorance and barbarity, in which all the Saxon tribes  had been hitherto involved.[*****] Ethelbert also enacted,[******] with  the consent of the states of his kingdom, a body of laws, the first  written laws promulgated by any of the northern conquerors; and his  reign was in every respect glorious to himself and beneficial to his  people. He governed the kingdom of Kent fifty years; and dying in 616,  left the succession to his son, Eadbald. This prince, seduced by a  passion for his mother-in-law, deserted, for some time, the Christian  faith, which permitted not these incestuous marriages: his whole people  immediately returned with him to idolatry. Laurentius, the successor of  Augustine found the Christian worship wholly abandoned, and was prepared  to return to France, in order to escape the mortification of preaching  the gospel without fruit to the infidels.         [* Bede lib. i. cap. 30. Spell. Concil. p. 89.       Greg. Epist. lib. ix. epist. 71.]         [** Chron. Sax. p. 23,24.]         [*** H. Hunting, lib. iii. Spell. Concil. p. 83.       Bede, lib. i.

Malms, p. 10.]         [****** Wilkins, Leges Sax. p. 13.]    Mellitus and Justus, who had been consecrated bishops of London and  Rochester, had already departed the kingdom,[*] when Laurentius, before  he should entirely abandon his dignity, made one effort to reclaim the  king. He appeared before that prince, and, throwing off his vestments,  showed his body all torn with bruises and stripes which he had received.  Eadbald, wondering that any man should have dared to treat in that  manner a person of his rank, was told by Laurentius, that he had  received this chastisement from St. Peter, the prince of the apostles,  who had appeared to him in a vision, and severely reproving him for his  intention to desert his charge, had inflicted on him these visible marks  of his displeasure.[**] Whether Eadbald was struck with the miracle,  or influenced by some other motive, he divorced himself from his  mother-in-law, and returned to the profession of Christianity:[***]  his whole people returned with him. Eadbald reached not the fame or  authority of his father, and died in 640, after a reign of twenty-five  years, leaving two sons, Erminfrid and Ercombert.         [* Bede, lib. ii. cap 5.]         [** Bede, lib. ii cap. 2. Chron. Sax. p. 26.       Higden, lib. v]         [*** Brompton, p 739.]    Ercombert, though the younger son, by Emma, a French princess,  found means to mount the throne. He is celebrated by Bede for two  exploits--for establishing the fast of Lent in his kingdom, and for  utterly extirpating idolatry, which, notwithstanding the prevalence of  Christianity, had hitherto been tolerated by the two preceding monarchs.  He reigned twenty-four years, and left the crown to Egbert, his son,  who reigned nine years. This prince is renowned for his encouragement of  learning; but infamous for putting to death his two cousins-german, sons  of Erminfrid, his uncle. The ecclesiastical writers praise him for his  bestowing on his sister, Domnona, some lands in the Isle of Thanet,  where she founded a monastery.      The bloody precaution of Egbert could not fix the crown on the head of  his son Edric. Lothaire, brother of the deceased prince, took possession  of the kingdom; and in order to secure the power in his family, he  associated with him Richard, his son, in the administration of the  government. Edric, the dispossessed prince, had recourse to Edilwach,  king of Sussex, for assistance; and being supported by that prince,  fought a battle with his uncle, who was defeated and slain. Richard fled  into Germany, and afterwards died in Lucca, a city of Tuscany. William  of Malmsbury ascribes Lothaire's bad fortune to two crimes--his  concurrence in the murder of his cousins, and his contempt for  relics.[*]    Lothaire reigned eleven years; Edric, his successor, only two. Upon the  death of the latter, which happened in 686 Widred, his brother, obtained  possession of the crown. But as the succession had been of late so much  disjointed by revolutions and usurpations, faction began to prevail  among the nobility; which invited Cedwalla, king of Wessex, with his  brother Mollo, to attack the kingdom. These invaders committed great  devastations in Kent; but the death of Mollo, who was slain in a  skirmish,[**] gave a short breathing time to that kingdom. Widred  restored the affairs of Kent, and, after a reign of thirty-two  years,[***] left the crown to his posterity. Eadbert, Ethelbert, and  Alric, his descendants, successively mounted the throne. After the  death of the last, which happened in 794, the royal family of Kent was  extinguished; and every factious leader, who could entertain hopes of  ascending the throne, threw the state into confusion.[****] Egbert, who  first succeeded, reigned but two years; Cuthred, brother to the king of  Mercia, six years; Baldred, an illegitimate branch of the royal family,  eighteen; and after a troublesome and precarious reign, he was, in the  year 823, expelled by Egbert, king of Wessex, who dissolved the Saxon  Heptarchy, and united the several kingdoms under his dominion.         [* W. Malms, p. 11.]         [** Higden, lib. v.]         [*** Chron. Sax. p. 52.]         [**** W. Malms, lib. i. cap. 1, p.11.]          THE KINGDOM OF NORTHUMBERLAND    Adelfrid, king of Bernicia, having married Acca, the daughter of AElla,  king of Deiri, and expelled her infant brother, Edwin, had united all  the counties north of Humber into one monarchy, and acquired a great  ascendant in the Heptarchy. He also spread the terror of the Saxon  arms to the neighboring people; and by his victories over the Scots  and Picts, as well as Welsh, extended on all sides the bounds of his  dominions. Having laid siege to Chester, the Britons marched out with  all their forces to engage him; and they were attended by a body of  twelve hundred and fifty monks from the monastery of Bangor, who stood  at a small distance from the field of battle, in order to encourage the  combatants by their presence and exhortations. Adelfrid, inquiring into  the purpose of this unusual appearance, was told that these priests had  come to pray against him: \"Then are they as much our enemies,\" said he,  \"as those who intend to fight against us;\"[*] and he immediately sent a  detachment, who fell upon them, and did such execution, that only fifty  escaped with their lives.[**] The Britons, astonished at this event,  received a total defeat: Chester was obliged to surrender; and Adelfrid,  pursuing his victory, made himself master of Bangor, and entirely  demolished the monastery, a building so extensive, that there was a  mile's distance from one gate of it to another; and it contained two  thousand one hundred monks, who are said to have been there maintained  by their own labor.[***] Notwithstanding Adelfrid's success in war,  he lived in inquietude on account of young Edwin, whom he had unjustly  dispossessed of the crown of Deiri. This prince, now grown to man's  estate, wandered from place to place, in continual danger from the  attempts of Adelfrid; and received at last protection in the court  of Redwald, king of the East Angles; where his engaging and gallant  deportment procured him general esteem and affection. Redwald, however,  was strongly solicited, by the king of Northumberland, to kill or  deliver up his guest: rich presents were promised him if he would  comply, and war denounced against him in case of his refusal. After  rejecting several messages of this kind, his generosity began to yield  to the motives of interest; and he retained the last ambassador, till  he should come to a resolution in a case of such importance. Edwin,  informed of his friend's perplexity, was yet determined at all hazards  to remain in East Anglia; and thought, that if the protection of that  court failed him, it were better to die than prolong a life so much  exposed to the persecutions of his powerful rival.
