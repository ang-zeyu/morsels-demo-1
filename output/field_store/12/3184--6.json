James noticed it  also, and saw that she seemed depressed and quiet. He supposed that her  grandfather had been telling her that he was going to take her away,  for hitherto nothing had been said, in her hearing, as to the  approaching termination of the stay with his mother.    As they came out of church, Mrs. Walsham had waited for a moment at the  door, and had told the butler at the Hall that she wished particularly  to speak to him, that afternoon, if he could manage to come down. They  were not strangers, for the doctor had attended John's wife in her last  illness, and he had sometimes called with messages from the Hall, when  the doctor was wanted there.    John Petersham was astonished, indeed, when Mrs. Walsham informed him  that the little girl he had seen in her pew, in church, was his  master's granddaughter.    \"You don't say so, ma'am. You don't say as that pretty little thing is  Master Herbert's child! But why didn't you say so afore? Why, I have  caught myself looking at her, and wondering how it was that I seemed to  know her face so well; and now, of course, I sees it. She is the  picture of Master Herbert when he was little.\"    \"I couldn't say so before, John, because I only knew it myself last  night. Her grandfather--that is, her other grandfather, you  know--placed her with me to educate, and, as he said, to make a little  lady of, two years ago; but it was only last night he told me.\"    \"Only to think of it!\" the butler ejaculated. \"What will the squire  say?\"    \"Yes, that is the point, John. What will the squire say? Her  grandfather thinks he will have nothing to say to her.\"    \"Nothing to say to her, ma'am! Why, he will be off his head with joy.  Didn't he search for her, and advertise for her, and do all he could to  find her for months? It wasn't till he tried for over a year that he  gave it up, and sent for Richard Horton to come to him.\"    \"Her grandfather can only judge by what he knows, John. He tells me  that the son wrote to his father, over and over again, on his deathbed,  and that he never came near him, or took any notice of the letters.\"    \"That's true enough, ma'am,\" the butler said sadly; \"and it is what has  pretty nigh broken the squire's heart. He was obstinate like at first,  and he took me with him when he travelled about across the sea among  the foreigners, and when he was at a place they called Athens, he got a  fever and he was down for weeks. We came home by sea, and the winds was  foul, and we made a long voyage of it, and when we got home there was  letters that had been lying months and months for us, and among them  was those letters of Master Herbert's.    \"The squire wasn't an hour in the house afore the carriage was round to  the door, and we posted as hard as horses could take us right across  England to Broadstairs, never stopping a minute except to change  horses; and when we got there it was a month too late, and there was  nothing to do but to go to the churchyard, and to see the stone under  which Master Herbert and his young wife was laid.    \"The house where they had died was shut up. There had been a sale, and  the man who was the father of Master Herbert's wife was gone, and we  learned there had been a baby born, and that had gone too. The squire  was like a madman, blaming himself for his son's death, and a-raving to  think what must Master Herbert have thought of him, when he never  answered his letters. I had a terrible time with him, and then he set  to work to find the child; but, as I told you, we never did find it, or  hear a word of it from that time to this, and the squire has never held  up his head. He will be pretty well out of his mind with joy.\"    \"I am very glad to hear what you say, John,\" Mrs. Walsham said. \"I  could hardly fancy the squire, who always has borne such a name for  kindness, being so hard that he would not listen to his dying son's  entreaties.\"    \"No, ma'am. The squire was hard for a bit. Master Herbert's marriage  was a sad disappointment to him. He had made up his mind he was going  to do so well, and to cut such a figure in the world; but he would have  come round. Lord bless you, he only meant to hold out for a bit. When  he was ill at Athens, he was talking all the time about forgiving his  son, and I could see how hard it had been to him to keep separated from  him. On the voyage home he fidgeted ever so at the delay, and I knew  that the first thing he did, when he got back, would be to write to  Master Herbert and tell him to bring his wife down to the Hall. There's  not a hard corner in the squire's heart.    \"I thank the good God for the news you have told me, ma'am; it's the  best I ever heard in all my life.\"    Mrs. Walsham now told him how the child had been brought up, and then  the sergeant himself, who was waiting in the next room, was brought in;  and to him John Petersham related the story of the squire's illness,  the reason of the letters not reaching him for months after they had  been written, and his intense sorrow and self reproach at having  arrived too late, and told him of the efforts that had been made to  find the child. The sergeant listened in grave silence.    \"I am glad it is so,\" he said, after a pause. \"I have misjudged the  squire, and I am glad of it. It will be a blow to me to lose the child.  I do not pretend that it won't; but it is for her good, and I must be  content. He can hardly object to my seeing her sometimes, and if I know  that she is well and happy, that is all I care for; and now the sooner  it's over the better. Can she come up this evening?\"    \"Surely she can,\" John Petersham said. \"The squire dines at five. If  you will bring her up at six, I will take her in to him.\"    And so it was arranged, and in his walk with Aggie, afterwards, the  sergeant told her the history of her parents, and that Squire Linthorne  was her other grandfather, and that she was to go up and see him that  evening.    Aggie had uttered her protest against fate. She did not wish to leave  her grampa who had been so good to her, and Mrs. Walsham, and James.  The description of the big house and its grandeurs, and the pleasures  of a pony for herself, offered no enticement to her; and, weeping, she  flung her arms round her grandfather's neck and implored him not to  give her up.    \"I must, my dear. It is my duty. I wish to God that it were not. You  know how I love you, Aggie, and how hard it is for me to part with you;  but it is for your good, my darling. You mayn't see it now, but when  you get older you will know it. It will not be so hard now on me, dear,  nor on you, as it would have been had I given you up two years ago; but  we have learned to do a little without each other.\"    \"But you will come and see me, just as you have here, won't you?\" Aggie  said, still weeping.    \"I hope so, my dear. You see, the squire is your father's father, while  I am only your mother's father, and somehow the law makes him nearer to  you than I am, and he will have the right to say what you must do.\"    \"I won't stay with him. I won't,\" Aggie said passionately, \"if he won't  let you come.\"    \"You must not say that, dear,\" the sergeant said. \"We must all do our  duty, even when that duty is hard to do, and your duty will be to obey  the squire's orders, and to do as he tells you. I have no doubt he will  be very kind, and that you will be very happy with him, and I hope he  will let you see me sometimes.\"    It was a long time before the child was at all reconciled. When her  sobs began to cease, her grandfather told her what she was to do when  she saw the squire.    \"You will remember, my dear, that I have been more fortunate than he  has. I have had you all these years, and he has had no one to love or  care for him. You must remember that he was not to blame, because he  objected to his son marrying my daughter. They were not in the same  position of life, and it was only natural that he should not like it,  at first; and, as I told you, he was coming home to make them both  happy, when he found it was too late.    \"You must think, dear, that while I have been happy all these years  with you, he has been sorrowing and grieving, and you must try and love  him, and make up to him for what he has suffered. I know you will not  forget your old friends. You will love me whether you see me often or  not; and Mrs. Walsham, who has been very kind to you; and James, you  know, who saved your life.\"    \"I shall never forget anyone, grampa. I shall always love you better  than anyone,\" the child exclaimed, throwing her arms round his neck  with a fresh burst of tears.    \"There, there, my pet,\" the sergeant said soothingly. \"You must not cry  any more. I want you to look your best this evening, you know, and to  do credit to us all. And now, I think we have settled everything, so we  will be going back to tea.\"    That evening, the squire was sitting by himself in the great dining  room, occasionally sipping the glass of port, which John Petersham had  poured out before he left the room. The curtains were drawn, and the  candles lighted; for it was late in September, and the evenings were  closing in fast; and the squire was puzzling over John Petersham's  behaviour at dinner.    Although the squire was not apt to observe closely what was passing  around him, he had been struck with the old butler's demeanour. That  something was wrong with him was clear. Usually he was the most quiet  and methodical of servants, but he had blundered several times in the  service. He had handed his master dishes when his plate "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17770"],[0,"Christmas Stories And Legends (#11)"],[1,"by  permission of the authors and also the publishers--Milton Bradley  Company.          THE MAGI IN THE WEST AND THEIR SEARCH FOR THE CHRIST[*]    A Tale for the Christmas-Tide    By Frederick E. Dewhurst      [Sidenote: The Mountain of Vision]    Now, it happened a long time ago, in the year ----, but the exact year  does not matter, because you will not find this story written in the  history of any of the nations of the world. But in one of the  countries of Europe bordering on the Mediterranean Sea was a lofty  mountain, which, to the dwellers in the plains below, seemed to reach  to the very sky. At times its summit was covered with clouds, so that  it could not be seen; at other times it stood out fair and clear, as  though silently asking the people to look up and not down. The lower  slopes of the mountain were covered with olive trees, with groves of  oranges and lemons, and with vineyards, and they were dotted here and  there with the little white cottages of the peasants who made their  living from these groves and vineyards, the fruit of which they sold  in the city not far away.    [Sidenote: Sunset in the Sea]    Along the mountain-side wound a foot-trail even to the summit, and  nowhere, in all the region, was there a finer view of the  Mediterranean than from the summit of this mountain. In the long  summer afternoons the peasants and children would climb to the top and  look off on the lovely picture of land and sea. Then they would eat  their simple lunch of bread and dates and olives and quench their  thirst from the spring on the mountain-side, which they called  \"Dew-of-heaven,\" so clear and fresh and sparkling was it; and when the  sun began to touch the western sky with his pencils of gold and  carmine and purple, they hastened down, that they might reach their  cottages before the night shut in.    [Sidenote: A Stranger Cometh]    On the day when this story begins a man was standing on the summit of  the mountain looking across the sea in the direction where you will  find Tyre and Joppa on the map. He was, very plainly, not one of the  peasants who lived on the mountain-side. He looked about sixty years  of age; he was tall and erect, though he carried a staff in his hand.  His hair and beard were long and flowing, and almost gray, but his eye  was clear and penetrating, and he was looking across the sea as though  he expected some one to appear.    And while he stood there gazing seaward, there appeared a second man  on the summit, helping himself up with his staff, and panting with the  effort of the long climb. From his dress and manner it was plain that  this man, too, was not one of the peasants, for, like the first comer,  he seemed to belong to another age and clime. The two men glanced at  each other and gave such greeting as strangers might who should meet  in so solitary a spot as a mountain summit. Then both lapsed into  silence and looked off across the sea.    [Sidenote: And Findeth a Friend]    Presently the last comer seemed to awake from his reverie. He walked  over to the place where the other man was sitting, still gazing off  toward Joppa, and touched him on the shoulder: \"A thousand pardons, my  friend,\" he said, \"but my mind is haunted with some far-off  recollection, as though in some other land and some far-off time I had  seen thy face. Wilt thou have the kindness to tell me thy name?\"    Without lifting his eyes from the sea, and in a tone which seemed  regretful and sad, the stranger replied: \"My name is Gaspard.\"    [Sidenote: A Far-off Pilgrimage Recalled]    \"Gaspard! Indeed, then have I seen thee! Look at me, my friend; dost  thou not remember me? My name is Melchoir. Dost thou not recall that  time, how long I know not, when thou and I and Balthazar followed a  star which led us to a little Jewish hamlet, thou bearing gold and I  frankincense, and Balthazar myrrh? Dost thou not remember how, on the  long journey thither, we talked about the young Prince, whom we  expected to find in a royal palace, and how at last when we reached  the village, following the star, we were led not to a palace but to a  little inn, and not even to a room within the inn, but to the  stable-yard, where we found a sweet-faced woman bending over a babe  cradled in a manger; and standing near, a sturdy peasant, proud and  happy, whose name was Joseph? Dost thou not remember, too, that when  we had recovered from our surprise, we left our gifts and greetings,  and went our way as men who had been dreaming? Gaspard, dost thou not  remember?\"    [Sidenote: And Wanderings in Many Lands]    And Gaspard, looking now intently in the other's face, replied: \"Yes,  Melchoir, I remember thee, and I remember the journey of which thou  hast spoken better than I remember aught else. Neither have I  forgotten the surprise and disappointment with which we came to the  place whither the star led us; nor how, after leaving our gifts, we  went away as in a dream; and, Melchoir, I have been dreaming ever  since. Even here hast thou found me in a dream of perplexity. I am  still Gaspard, the wandering magician; for how many years I know not,  I have wandered up and down these lands of Europe. I have crossed the  seas; in every place I have sought to find the kingdom over which we  were told this young prince was one day to reign. Dost thou not  remember that we were told His kingdom was to last forever, that He  would reign in it himself forever and would never die? Alas! I have  lost the old power of the magician's art. I can summon no star to  guide me to the place where I shall find this kingdom and its king.\"    [Sidenote: If Only Balthazar Were Here]    \"Truly, Gaspard,\" answered Melchoir, \"the story of your wanderings is  but the repetition of my own; and even now was I drawn to this  mountain summit on the self-same errand that brought you here,--to see  if I could not discover in the direction of yonder land, where  Bethlehem was, some star which might prove to be His star, and which  might guide me in the new quest. If only our old companion, Balthazar,  were with us now, he might give us the clew to our search, for not  only was he more skilful in the magician's art, but he was braver and  more courageous, and withal more serene in spirit.\"    [Sidenote: A Song in the Air]    Now, even while Melchoir was speaking, a voice was heard a little way  down the mountain. Gaspard and Melchoir stopped to listen. The voice  was singing, and the words of the song floated up to them distinctly:        If the sun has hid its light,      If the day has turned to night,      If the heavens are not benign,      If the stars refuse to shine--                      Heart of man lose not thy hope;                    Door, there's none that shall not ope;                    Path, there's none that shall not clear;                    Heart of man! why shouldst thou fear?        If for years should be thy quest,      If for years thou hast no rest,      If thou circlest earth and sea,      If thou worn and weary be--                      Heart of man, lose not thy hope;                    Door, there's none that shall not ope;                    Path, there's none that shall not clear;                    Heart of man! why shouldst thou fear?    [Sidenote: Balthazar Cometh]    \"That,\" exclaimed Gaspard and Melchoir together, \"is the voice of  Balthazar,\" and they hastened to meet him, for he was now almost at  the summit, and the refrain of his song was still upon his lips. At  that moment Balthazar sprang up from the sloping path into full view  of the two men, and, giving each a hand, exclaimed: \"Gaspard,  Melchoir, beloved companions, I have found you at last. The peasants  below were not mistaken. From their description, I was certain I  should find you here. And you, too, have been searching these long  years for the kingdom of the Christ! and, like me, you have met with  disappointment; but, comrades, be not of faint heart:        Door, there's none that shall not ope;      Path, there's none that shall not clear.    Let us hasten down the mountain, for see! the sky is already growing  gold and crimson beyond the pillars of Hercules. Let us seek the  wayfarer's lodging with the hospitable peasants in the valley, and  tomorrow let us begin our search for the Christ anew. We have wandered  alone; let us invoke now the star to guide us together.\"    [Sidenote: Forget Not Hospitality]    That night, therefore, the three strangers lodged with the simple  peasant people in the valley, partaking with thankfulness of the  coarse bread, the dates and the red wine--the common fare of their  daily life. Nor did they fail to notice a motto inscribed above the  fireplace in rude Greek letters:           *       *       *       *       *    On the morrow they were ready to begin their search together for the  Christ, and they hoped not to wander far before they should find at  least the outskirts of His kingdom. But whither should they go? In  what direction should they first turn their steps?    [Sidenote: Once More a Star]    While they were thus wondering and debating, Balthazar suddenly  exclaimed: \"I see the star!\" And behold, a little way before them, and  at no great distance above their heads, they discerned in the gray of  the early morning a star of pale, opal light, which seemed to move  forward as the men moved toward it.    \"We must follow the star!\" Balthazar said in a whisper. Silently and  breathlessly his companions followed on.    Now, so intently did the three men keep their eyes fixed upon the  star, and so eagerly did they follow in the direction where it seemed  to lead, that it was only after a considerable time they discovered  that they had become separated from each other, and that their paths  were getting farther and farther apart. Yet, there before each of them  was the star, shining with its soft, opalescent light, and still  ringing in their ears were the words of Balthazar--\"we must"]]]
