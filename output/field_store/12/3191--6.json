By Jove, there is!\"    A vigorous pull had dislodged a drawer in a very unexpected situation.  Winona would certainly never have thought of its existence, nor would  Percy, if the newspaper had not given away the secret. He looked eagerly  inside.    \"No treasures hidden in here! Absolutely nothing at all, except this  piece of paper.\"    \"Perhaps Aunt Harriet has never found it out,\" ventured Winona.    Percy did not answer immediately. He was reading the writing on the  paper.    \"You bet she has!\" he cried at last, flushing angrily. \"I never thought  she'd much opinion of me, but I call this the limit! It's going where it  deserves!\" and acting on a sudden impulse he flung the cause of offense  into the fire.    For a moment Winona did not realize what he had done. By the time she  reached the hearth the paper was already half consumed. She made a  snatch at it with the tongs, but a flame sprang up and forestalled her.  She had just time to read the words \"last Will and Testament of me  Har--\" before the whole sank into ashes. She turned to her brother with  a white, scared face.    \"Percy! You've never burnt Aunt Harriet's will?\"    Ashamed already of his impetuous act the boy nevertheless tried to bluff  the matter off.    \"It was an abominable shame! When I'm named Beach after her too! I  wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't read it myself!\" he blustered.    \"Read what?\"    \"I shan't tell you! Look here, Win, you must promise on your honor that  you'll never breathe a word about this.\"    \"Perhaps Aunt Harriet ought to know.\"    \"She mustn't know: _mustn't_, I tell you! I say, Win, I'm not at all  sure that what I've just done isn't a chargeable offense--I believe they  call it a felony. You wouldn't like to see me put into prison, would  you? Then hold your tongue about it! Give me your word! Can you keep a  secret?\"    \"I promise!\" gasped Winona (Percy was squeezing her little finger nail  in orthodox fashion and the agony was acute). \"I promise faithfully.\"    She was in a terrible quandary. Her natural straightforwardness urged  her to make a clean breast of the whole affair. Had she been the actual  transgressor she would certainly have done so and faced the  consequences. But this was Percy's secret, not her own. He was no  favorite with his aunt, and so outrageous an act would prejudice him  fatally in her eyes. The hint about prison frightened Winona. She knew  nothing of law, but she thought it highly probable that burning a will  was a punishable crime. Suppose Aunt Harriet's rigid conscience obliged  her to communicate with the police and deliver Percy into the hands of  justice. Such a horrible possibility must be avoided at all costs. The  sound of a latch-key in the door made her start. In a panic she rushed  to the old cupboard and pushed back the secret drawer into its place.  When Miss Beach entered the dining-room her nephew and niece were  sitting reading by the fireside. Their choice of literature might  perhaps have astonished her, for Percy was poring over Sir Oliver  Lodge's \"Man and the Universe,\" while Winona's nose was buried in  Herbert Spencer's \"Sociology,\" but if indeed she noticed it, she perhaps  set it down to a laudable desire to improve their minds, and placed the  matter to their credit. Percy took his departure next morning, and  Winona saw him off at the railway station.    \"Remember, you've to keep that business dark,\" he reminded her. \"Aunt  Harriet must never find out. She's been jawing me no end about  responsibility, and looking after the kids and supporting the mater and  all that. Rubbed it in hard, I can tell you! Great Juggins! Do I look  like the mainstay of a family?\"    As Winona watched his boyish face laughing at her from the window of the  moving train she decided that he certainly did not. She sighed as she  turned to leave the station. Life seemed suddenly to have assumed new  perplexities. Percy's act weighed heavily on her mind. It seemed such a  base return for all Aunt Harriet was doing on their behalf. She longed  to thank her for her kindness and say how much she appreciated going to  the High School, but she could not find the words. Theknowledge of the  secret raised an extra barrier between herself and her aunt. So she sat  at lunch time even shyer and more speechless than usual, and let the  ball of conversation persistently drop.    \"Fretting for her brother, I suppose,\" thought Miss Beach. \"She can talk  fast enough with friends of her own age. Well, I suppose an old body  like myself mustn't expect to be company for a girl of fifteen!\"    She was too proud to let the hurt feeling show itself on her face,  however, and propping up the newspaper beside her plate, she plunged  into the latest accounts from the Front.          CHAPTER VI    A Crisis      Winona had been more than a month, nearly five weeks indeed, at the  Seaton High School. In the first few days of her introduction to  V.a. she had told herself that the difficulty of the work  consisted largely in its newness, and that as soon as she grew  accustomed to it she would sail along as swimmingly as Garnet Emerson,  or Olave Parry, or Hilda Langley, or Agatha James. Most unfortunately  she found her theory acted in the opposite direction. Closer  acquaintance with her Form subjects proved their extreme toughness. She  was not nearly up to the standard of the rest of the girls. Her Latin  grammar was shaky, her French only a trifle better, she had merely a  nodding acquaintance with geometry, and had not before studied  chemistry. Her teacher seemed to expect her to understand many things of  which she had hitherto never heard, and was apparently astounded at her  ignorance. Winona puzzled over her text-books during many hours of  preparation, but she made little headway. The royal road to learning,  which she had fondly hoped to tread, was proving itself a stony and  twisting path.    \"_You_ seem to get on all right?\" she said wistfully to Garnet one day.    \"Why, yes. Of course one has to work,\" admitted her friend. \"Miss  Huntley keeps one up to the mark. But one must expect that in  V.a. They don't put scholarship holders in the Preparatory.\"    \"I was all at sea in math. this morning.\"    \"You were rather a duffer, certainly. The problems weren't as difficult  as the ones they gave us in the entrance exam. If those didn't floor  you, why couldn't you work these?\"    \"But they did floor me. I barely managed half the paper. I reckoned I'd  failed in it.\"    Garnet looked surprised.    \"Then your other subjects must have been extremely good to make up for  it. I was told that we should probably stand or fall by maths. You were  ripping in everything else, I suppose? Scored no end?\"    Winona did not answer the question. She was conscious that none of her  papers could have merited such an eulogium. She envied Garnet's grasp of  the form work. Try as she would, her own exercises and translations were  poor affairs, and her ill-trained memory found it difficult to marshal  the enormous number of facts that were daily forced upon it. Miss  Huntley at first was patient, but as the weeks wore on, and Winona still  wallowed in a quagmire of amazing mistakes, she grew sarcastic. The girl  winced under some of her cutting remarks. Apparently the mistress  imagined her failure to be due to laziness and inattention, and sooner  than confess that she could not understand the work, Winona was silent.  She never mentioned the long hours she spent poring over her books in  Aunt Harriet's dining-room. After all, it was better to be thought idle  than stupid. But it was humiliating to feel that she was counted among  the slackers of the Form, while Garnet was already winning laurels. The  contrast between the two scholarship holders could not fail to be  noticed.    Miss Huntley (privately known to the Form as \"Bunty\") was a clever, but  rather remorseless teacher. She had been on the staff since the opening  of the school two years before, and she was determined at all costs to  maintain the high standard inaugurated at its foundation. She was  herself the product of High School education, and knew to the last  scruple how much to require from girls in V.a. To those who  appeared to be really trying their best she was ready to give  intelligent help, but she had no mercy for slackers. She was possessed  of a certain amount of dry humor, greatly appreciated by the form _en  bloc_, though each quaked privately lest, through some unlucky slip, she  might find herself the object of the smart but withering satires.  Despite her strictness, \"Bunty\" was popular. She was an admirable tennis  player, and a formidable champion in a match \"Mistresses _v._ Girls.\"  Her strong personality fascinated Winona, who would have done much to  gain her approval. So far, however, she was entirely on Miss Huntley's  black list.    Matters came to a crisis over a difficult bit of Vergil. Latin was,  next to mathematics, the most painfully wobbling of Winona's shaky  subjects. She had puzzled in vain over this particular piece of  translation. The words, indeed, she had found in the dictionary, but she  could not twist them into sense.    \"Old Vergil's utterly stumped me to-day!\" she mourned to Garnet, as they  met in the dressing-room before nine o'clock. \"If Bunty puts me to  construe anywhere on page 21, I'm a gone coon. I'm feeling in a blue  funk, I can tell you.\"    \"Poor old bluebottle! Don't wrinkle up your forehead like that--you're  making permanent lines! It's a bad trick, and just spoils you.\"    \"I can't help it when I'm worried!\"    \"Then don't worry.\"    \"Oh, it's easy enough for you; you don't have to receive the vials of  Bunty's scorn.\"    Winona hoped against hope that the difficult page might fall to somebody  else's turn. Miss Huntley took no particular order, but selected girls  at random to construe the lesson.

Napoleon had entered the city with his army, and was himself    occupying the palace of the Kremlin, when, one night, by order of    the Russian governor, every wood house and every granary    simultaneously burst into a blaze. All efforts to extinguish them    were vain, and Napoleon found himself compelled to march his army    through the fire. Retiring to an eminence he saw the whole city    enveloped in vast sheets of flame, and clouds of smoke, and    apparently all on fire. And far as he was concerned it might as    well have been, for though houses enough were left to supply    every soldier with a room, yet without provisions or fuel, and a    Russian army to cut off supplies, he and his army could not    subsist there. During the fire some houses were probably burnt,    but the city was not. In the Kremlin a magazine blew up, cracking    the church of Ivan more than a hundred feet up, but setting    nothing on fire.      \"Mr. Douglas saw the fire-marks around the city, where wood    houses and granaries for winter supplies now stand as of old; but    there appears no marks of conflagration within the city.\"    Any wary sceptic, indeed, might have found much ground for doubt in  the very accounts themselves that were given of the conflagration.  For, the Russians have always denied that _they_ burned it; and the  French equally disclaimed the act. Each of the two parties between  whom the accusation lay, strenuously denied it. And it must be  acknowledged that each had very strong presumptions of innocence to  urge. It was certainly most _unlikely_ that the Russians should  themselves destroy their ancient and venerable capital; and that, too,  when they were boasting of having just gained a great victory at  Borodino over an army which, therefore, they might hope to defeat  again, and to drive out of their city. And it was no less unlikely  that the French should burn down a city of which they had possession,  and which afforded shelter and refreshment to their troops. This would  have been one of the most improbable circumstances of that most  improbable (supposed) campaign. To add to the marvel, we are told that  the French army nevertheless waited for five weeks, without any  object, amid the ashes of this destroyed city, just at the approach,  of winter, and as if on purpose to be overtaken and destroyed by snows  and frost!    However, all the difficulties of the question whether any of these  things took place at all, were by most persons overlooked, because  the question itself never occurred to them, in their eagerness to  decide _who_ it was that burned the city. And at length it comes out  that the answer is, NOBODY!      THE END.          POSTSCRIPT.      With respect to the foregoing arguments, it has been asserted (though  without even any attempt at proof) that they go to prove that the  Bible-narratives contain nothing more miraculous than the received  accounts of Napoleon Buonaparte. And this is indeed true, if we use  the word \"_miraculous_\" in the very unusual sense in which Hume (as is  pointed out in the foregoing pages) has employed it; to signify simply  \"_improbable_;\" an abuse of language on which his argument mainly  depends.    It is indeed shown, that there are at least as many and as great  _improbabilities_ in the history of Buonaparte as in any of the  Scripture-narratives; and that as plausible objections,--if not more  so,--may be brought against the one history as the other.    But taking words in their ordinary, established sense, the assertion  is manifestly the opposite of the truth. For, any one who does,--in  spite of all the improbabilities,--_believe_ the truth of _both_  histories, is, evidently, a believer in miracles; since he believes  two narratives, one of which is _not_ miraculous, while the other is.  The history of Buonaparte contains--though much that is very  improbable--nothing that is to be called, according to the established  use of language, miraculous. And the Scriptures contain, as an  _essential_ part of their narrative, _Miracles_, properly so called.    To talk of believing the Bible, all _except the Miracles_, would be  like professing to believe the accounts of Buonaparte, _except_ only  his commanding armies, and having been at Elba and at Saint Helena.           *       *       *       *       *    One cannot doubt that in the course of the _forty years_ that this  little Work has been before the Public, some real, valid refutation of  the argument would have been adduced, if any such could have been  devised.    1860.           *       *       *       *       *"]]]
