It seemed as if it must be different from other places  and that something strange must have happened to it during ten years.  Besides that, if she liked it she could go into it every day and shut  the door behind her, and she could make up some play of her own and play  it quite alone, because nobody would ever know where she was, but would  think the door was still locked and the key buried in the earth. The  thought of that pleased her very much.    Living as it were, all by herself in a house with a hundred  mysteriously closed rooms and having nothing whatever to do to amuse  herself, had set her inactive brain to working and was actually  awakening her imagination. There is no doubt that the fresh, strong,  pure air from the moor had a great deal to do with it. Just as it had  given her an appetite, and fighting with the wind had stirred her blood,  so the same things had stirred her mind. In India she had always been  too hot and languid and weak to care much about anything, but in this  place she was beginning to care and to want to do new things. Already  she felt less \"contrary,\" though she did not know why.    She put the key in her pocket and walked up and down her walk. No one  but herself ever seemed to come there, so she could walk slowly and look  at the wall, or, rather, at the ivy growing on it. The ivy was the  baffling thing. Howsoever carefully she looked she could see nothing but  thickly-growing, glossy, dark green leaves. She was very much  disappointed. Something of her contrariness came back to her as she  paced the walk and looked over it at the tree-tops inside. It seemed so  silly, she said to herself, to be near it and not be able to get in. She  took the key in her pocket when she went back to the house, and she made  up her mind that she would always carry it with her when she went out,  so that if she ever should find the hidden door she would be ready.    Mrs. Medlock had allowed Martha to sleep all night at the cottage, but  she was back at her work in the morning with cheeks redder than ever and  in the best of spirits.    \"I got up at four o'clock,\" she said. \"Eh! it was pretty on th' moor  with th' birds gettin' up an' th' rabbits scamperin' about an' th' sun  risin'. I didn't walk all th' way. A man gave me a ride in his cart an'  I can tell you I did enjoy myself.\"    She was full of stories of the delights of her day out. Her mother had  been glad to see her and they had got the baking and washing all out of  the way. She had even made each of the children a dough-cake with a bit  of brown sugar in it.    \"I had 'em all pipin' hot when they came in from playin' on th' moor.  An' th' cottage all smelt o' nice, clean hot bakin' an' there was a good  fire, an' they just shouted for joy. Our Dickon he said our cottage was  good enough for a king to live in.\"    In the evening they had all sat round the fire, and Martha and her  mother had sewed patches on torn clothes and mended stockings and Martha  had told them about the little girl who had come from India and who had  been waited on all her life by what Martha called \"blacks\" until she  didn't know how to put on her own stockings.    \"Eh! they did like to hear about you,\" said Martha. \"They wanted to know  all about th' blacks an' about th' ship you came in. I couldn't tell 'em  enough.\"    Mary reflected a little.    \"I'll tell you a great deal more before your next day out,\" she said,  \"so that you will have more to talk about. I dare say they would like to  hear about riding on elephants and camels, and about the officers going  to hunt tigers.\"    \"My word!\" cried delighted Martha. \"It would set 'em clean off their  heads. Would tha' really do that, Miss? It would be same as a wild beast  show like we heard they had in York once.\"    \"India is quite different from Yorkshire,\" Mary said slowly, as she  thought the matter over. \"I never thought of that. Did Dickon and your  mother like to hear you talk about me?\"    \"Why, our Dickon's eyes nearly started out o' his head, they got that  round,\" answered Martha. \"But mother, she was put out about your seemin'  to be all by yourself like. She said, 'Hasn't Mr. Craven got no  governess for her, nor no nurse?' and I said, 'No, he hasn't, though  Mrs. Medlock says he will when he thinks of it, but she says he mayn't  think of it for two or three years.'\"    \"I don't want a governess,\" said Mary sharply.    \"But mother says you ought to be learnin' your book by this time an' you  ought to have a woman to look after you, an' she says: 'Now, Martha, you  just think how you'd feel yourself, in a big place like that, wanderin'  about all alone, an' no mother. You do your best to cheer her up,' she  says, an' I said I would.\"    Mary gave her a long, steady look.    \"You do cheer me up,\" she said. \"I like to hear you talk.\"    Presently Martha went out of the room and came back with something held  in her hands under her apron.    \"What does tha' think,\" she said, with a cheerful grin. \"I've brought  thee a present.\"    \"A present!\" exclaimed Mistress Mary. How could a cottage full of  fourteen hungry people give any one a present!    \"A man was drivin' across the moor peddlin',\" Martha explained. \"An' he  stopped his cart at our door. He had pots an' pans an' odds an' ends,  but mother had no money to buy anythin'. Just as he was goin' away our  'Lizabeth Ellen called out, 'Mother, he's got skippin'-ropes with red  an' blue handles.' An' mother she calls out quite sudden, 'Here, stop,  mister! How much are they?' An' he says 'Tuppence,' an' mother she  began fumblin' in her pocket an' she says to me, 'Martha, tha's brought  me thy wages like a good lass, an' I've got four places to put every  penny, but I'm just goin' to take tuppence out of it to buy that child a  skippin'-rope,' an' she bought one an' here it is.\"    She brought it out from under her apron and exhibited it quite proudly.  It was a strong, slender rope with a striped red and blue handle at each  end, but Mary Lennox had never seen a skipping-rope before. She gazed at  it with a mystified expression.    \"What is it for?\" she asked curiously.    \"For!\" cried out Martha. \"Does tha' mean that they've not got  skippin'-ropes in India, for all they've got elephants and tigers and  camels! No wonder most of 'em's black. This is what it's for; just watch  me.\"    And she ran into the middle of the room and, taking a handle in each  hand, began to skip, and skip, and skip, while Mary turned in her chair  to stare at her, and the queer faces in the old portraits seemed to  stare at her, too, and wonder what on earth this common little cottager  had the impudence to be doing under their very noses. But Martha did not  even see them. The interest and curiosity in Mistress Mary's face  delighted her, and she went on skipping and counted as she skipped  until she had reached a hundred.    \"I could skip longer than that,\" she said when she stopped. \"I've  skipped as much as five hundred when I was twelve, but I wasn't as fat  then as I am now, an' I was in practice.\"    Mary got up from her chair beginning to feel excited herself.    \"It looks nice,\" she said. \"Your mother is a kind woman. Do you think I  could ever skip like that?\"    \"You just try it,\" urged Martha, handing her the skipping-rope. \"You  can't skip a hundred at first, but if you practise you'll mount up.  That's what mother said. She says, 'Nothin' will do her more good than  skippin' rope. It's th' sensiblest toy a child can have. Let her play  out in th' fresh air skippin' an' it'll stretch her legs an' arms an'  give her some strength in 'em.'\"    It was plain that there was not a great deal of strength in Mistress  Mary's arms and legs when she first began to skip. She was not very  clever at it, but she liked it so much that she did not want to stop.    \"Put on tha' things and run an' skip out o' doors,\" said Martha. \"Mother  said I must tell you to keep out o' doors as much as you could, even  when it rains a bit, so as tha' wrap up warm.\"    Mary put on her coat and hat and took her skipping-rope over her arm.  She opened the door to go out, and then suddenly thought of something  and turned back rather slowly.    \"Martha,\" she said, \"they were your wages. It was your twopence really.  Thank you.\" She said it stiffly because she was not used to thanking  people or noticing that they did things for her. \"Thank you,\" she said,  and held out her hand because she did not know what else to do.    Martha gave her hand a clumsy little shake, as if she was not accustomed  to this sort of thing either. Then she laughed.    \"Eh! tha' art a queer, old-womanish thing,\" she said. \"If tha'd been our  'Lizabeth Ellen tha'd have give me a kiss.\"    Mary looked stiffer than ever.    \"Do you want me to kiss you?\"    Martha laughed again.    \"Nay, not me,\" she answered. \"If tha' was different, p'raps tha'd want  to thysel'. But tha' isn't. Run off outside an' play with thy rope.\"    Mistress Mary felt a little awkward as she went out of the room.  Yorkshire people seemed strange, and Martha was always rather a puzzle  to her. At first she had disliked her very much, but now she did not.    The skipping-rope was a wonderful thing. She counted and skipped, and  skipped and counted, until her cheeks were quite red, and she was more  interested than she had ever been since she was born. The sun was  shining and a little wind was blowing--not a rough wind, but one which  came in delightful little gusts and brought a fresh scent of newly  turned earth with it. She skipped round the fountain garden, and up one  walk and down another. She skipped at last into the kitchen-garden and  saw Ben Weatherstaff digging and talking to his robin, which was hopping  about him. She skipped down the walk toward him and he lifted his head  and looked at her with a curious"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1740"],[0,"The Flying U's Last Stand (#11)"],[1,", and he gripped the arms of his chair, and he clamped his mouth  shut and did not speak a word.    The Happy Family had expected him to swear at them stormily; to accuse  them of vile things; to call them such names as his memory could seize  upon or his ingenuity invent. They had been careful to prepare a list of  plausible reasons for leaving then. They had first invented a gold  rumor that they hoped would sound convincing, but Andy had insisted upon  telling him straightforwardly that they did not favor fence-building and  ditch-digging and such back-breaking toil; that they were range men  and they demanded range work or none; that if they must dig ditches and  build fences and perform like menial tasks, they preferred doing it  for themselves. \"That,\" said Andy, \"makes us out such dirty, low-down  sons-of-guns we'd have to climb a tree to look a snake in the eye, but  it's got the grain of truth that'll make it go down. We DON'T love this  farming graft, and the Old Man knows it. He's heard us kicking often  enough. That's where it'll git him. He'll believe this last stretch of  fence is what made us throw him down, and he'll be so mad he'll cuss us  out till the neighbors'll think the smoke's a prairie fire. We'll get  our time, all right' and the things he'll say will likely make us so  hot we can all talk convincing when we hit town. Keep a stiff upper lip,  boys. We got to do it, and he'll make us mad, so it won't be as hard as  you imagine.\"    The theory was good, and revealed a knowledge of human nature that  made one cease to wonder why Andy was a prince of convincing liars. The  theory was good--nothing in the world was the matter with it, except  that in this particular instance it did not work. The Old Man did not  ask for their reasons, excuses or explanations. Neither did he say  anything or do anything to make them mad. He just sat there, with his  face gray and hard, and said nothing at all.    The Little Doctor appeared with the required books and a fountain pen;  saw the Happy Family standing there like condemned men at the steps;  saw the Old Man's face, and trembled wide-eyed upon the verge of speech.  Then she decided that this was no time for questioning and hurried,  still wide of eye, away from sight of them. The Happy Family did not  look at one another--they looked chiefly at the wall of the house.    The Old Man reckoned the wages due each one, and wrote a check for the  exact amount. And he spoke no word that did not intimately concern the  matter in hand. He still had that gray, hard look in his face that froze  whatever explanation they would otherwise have volunteered. And when  he handed the last man--who was Patsy--his check, he got up stiffly and  turned his back on them, and went inside and closed the door while yet  they lingered, waiting to explain.    At the bunk-house, whence they walked silently, Slim turned suddenly  upon their leader. His red face had gone a sallow white, and the whites  of his eyes were veined with red.    \"If that there land business falls down anywhere because you lied to us,  Andy Green' I'll kill you fer this\" he stated flatly.    \"If it Does, Slim, I'll stand and let yuh shoot me as full of lead as  you like,\" Andy promised, in much the same tone. Then he strove to shake  off the spell of the Old Man's stricken silence. \"Buck up, boys. He'll  thank us for what we aim to do--when he knows all about it.\"    \"Well, it seems to me,\" sighed Weary lugubriously, \"we mighta managed it  without hitting the Old Man a wallop in the back, like that.\"    \"How'n hell did I know he'd take it the way he did?\" Andy questioned  sharply, and began throwing his personal belongings into his \"war-bag\"  as if he had a grudge against his own clothes.    \"Aw, looks to me like he was glad to git shet of us!\" grumbled Happy  Jack. \"I betche he's more tickled than sorry, right now.\"    It was an exceedingly unhappy Family that rode up the Hog's Back upon  their private mounts, and away from the Flying U; in spite of Chip's  assurance that he would tell the Old Man all about it as soon as he  could, it was an ill-humored Family that rode into Dry Lake and cashed  their several checks at the desk of the General store which also did  an informal banking business, and afterwards took the train for Great  Falls.    The news spread through the town that old J. G. Whitmore had fired the  Happy Family in a bunch for some unforgivable crime against the peace  and dignity of the outfit, and that the boys were hatching up some  scheme to get even. From the gossip that was rolled relishfully upon the  tongues of the Dry Lake scandal lovers, the Happy Family must have been  more than sufficiently convincing.        CHAPTER 7. THE COMING OF THE COLONY    If you would see northern Montana at its most beautiful best, you should  see it in mid-May when the ground-swallows are nesting and the meadow  larks are puffing their throats and singing of their sweet ecstasy  with life; when curlews go sailing low over the green, grassy billows,  peering and perking with long bills thrust rapier-wise through the sunny  stillness, and calling shrilly, \"Cor-r-ECK, cor-r-eck!\"--which, I take  it, is simply their opinion of world and weather given tersely in plain  English. You should see the high prairies then, when all the world  is a-shimmer with green velvet brocaded brightly in blue and pink and  yellow flower-patterns; when the heat waves go quivering up to meet the  sun, so that the far horizons wave like painted drop-scenes stirred by a  breeze; when a hypnotic spell of peace and bright promises is woven over  the rangeland--you should see it then, if you would love it with a sweet  unreason that will last you through all the years to come.    The homeseekers' Syndicate, as represented by Florence Grace  Hallman--she of the wheat-yellow hair and the tempting red lips and the  narrow, calculating eyes and stubborn chin--did well to wait for the  spell of the prairies when the wind flowers and the lupines blue the  hillsides and the new grass paints green the hollows.    There is in us all a deep-rooted instinct to create, and never is that  instinct so nearly dominant as in the spring when the grass and the  flowers and the little, new leaves and the birds all sing the song of  Creation together. Then is when case-hardened city dwellers study the  bright array of seed-packets in the stores, and meditate rashly upon  the possibilities of back-yard gardening. Then is when the seasoned  country-dwellers walk over their farms in the sunset and plan largely  for harvest time. Then is when the salaried-folk read avidly the  real-estate advertisements, and pore optimistically over folders and  dream of chicken ranches and fruit ranches and the like. Surely, then,  the homeseekers' Syndicate planned well the date of their excursion into  the land of large promise (and problematical fulfillment) which lay east  of Dry Lake.    Rumors of the excursion seeped through the channels of gossip and set  the town talking and chuckling and speculating--after the manner of very  small towns.    Rumors grew to definite though erroneous statements of what was to take  place. Definite statements became certified facts that bore fruit in  detailed arrangements.    Came Florence Grace Hallman smilingly from Great Falls, to canvass the  town for \"accommodations.\" Florence Grace Hallman was a capable woman  and a persuasive one, though perhaps a shade too much inclined to take  certain things for granted--such as Andy's anchored interest in her and  her project, and the probability of the tract remaining just as it had  been when last she went carefully over the plat in the land office.  Florence Grace Hallman had been busy arranging the details of the coming  of the colony, and she had neglected to visit the land office  lately. Since she cannily represented the excursion as being merely a  sight-seeing trip--or some such innocuous project--she failed also to  receive any inkling of recent settlements.    On a certain sunny morning in mid-May, the Happy Family stood upon the  depot platform and waited for the westbound passenger, that had attached  to it the special car of the homeseekers' Syndicate. The Happy Family  had been very busy during the past three weeks. They had taken all the  land they could, and had sighed because they could still look from their  claims upon pinnacles as yet unclaimed save by the government. They had  done well. From the south line of Meeker's land in the very foothills  of the Bear Paws, to the north line of the Flying U, the chain of  newly-filed claims remained unbroken. It had taken some careful work  upon the part of the Happy Family to do this and still choose land  not absolutely worthless except from a scenic viewpoint. But they had  managed it, with some bickering and a good deal of maneuvering. Also  they had hauled loads of lumber from Dry Lake, wherewith to build their  monotonously modest ten-by-twelve shacks with one door and one  window apiece and a round hole in the roof big enough for a length of  stove-pipe to thrust itself aggressively into the open and say by its  smoke signal whether the owner was at home. And now, having heard of the  mysterious excursion due that day, they had come to see just what would  take place.    \"She's fifteen minutes late,\" the agent volunteered, thrusting his head  through the open window. \"Looking for friends, boys?\"    \"Andy is,\" Pink informed him cheerfully. \"The rest of us are just  hanging around through sympathy. It's his girl coming.\"    \"Well, I guess he thinks he needs a housekeeper now,\" the agent grinned.  \"Why don't you fellows get busy now and rustle some cooks?\"    \"Girls don't like to cook over a camp-fire,\" Cal Emmett told him  soberly. \"We kinda thought we ought to build our shacks first.\"    \"You can pick you out some when the train gets in,\" said the agent,  accepting a match from Weary. \"There's a carload of--\" He "]]]
