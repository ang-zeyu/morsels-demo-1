Snow, a delicate white powder, was falling on the coverlet of snow.    Outside, on the sill, the importunate robin lay supine, his little  heart beating no more behind the shabby finery of his breast, but  his glazing eyes half-open as though even in death he were still  questioning. Above him and all around him brooded the genius of  infinity, dispassionate, inscrutable, grey.    Jacynth turned and mutely beckoned her husband to the window.    They stood there, these two, gazing silently down.    Presently Jacynth said: \"Adrian, are you sure that we, you and I, for  all our theories, and all our efforts, aren't futile?\"    \"No, dear. Sometimes I am not sure. But--there's a certain comfort in  not being sure. To die for what one knows to be true, as many saints  have done--that is well. But to live, as many of us do nowadays, in  service of what may, for aught we know, be only a half-truth or not  true at all--this seems to me nobler still.\"    \"Because it takes more out of us?\"    \"Because it takes more out of us.\"    Standing between the live bird and the dead, they gazed across  the river, over the snow-covered wharves, over the dim, slender  chimneys from which no smoke came, into the grey-black veil of the  distance. And it seemed to them that the genius of infinity did not  know--perhaps did not even care--whether they were futile or not,  nor how much and to what purpose, if to any purpose, they must go  on striving.        CHRISTMAS    _By_    G.S. STR**T      One likes it or not. This said, there is plaguey little else to say of  Christmas, and I (though I doubt my sentiments touch you not at all)  would rather leave that little unsaid. Did I confess a distaste for  Christmas, I should incur your enmity. But if I find it, as I protest  I do, rather agreeable than otherwise, why should I spoil my pleasure  by stringing vain words about it? Swift and the broomstick--yes. But  that essay was done at the behest of a clever woman, and to annoy the  admirers of Robert Boyle. Besides, it was hardly--or do you think it  was?--worth the trouble of doing it. There was no trouble involved?  Possibly. But I am not the Dean. And anyhow the fact that he never did  anything of the kind again may be taken to imply that he would not be  bothered. So would not I, if I had a deanery.    That is an hypothesis I am tempted to pursue. I should like to fill  my allotted space before reaching the tiresome theme I have set  myself ... A deanery, the cawing of rooks, their effect on the nervous  system, Trollope's delineations of deans, the advantages of the  Mid-Victorian novel ... But your discursive essayist is a nuisance.  Best come to the point. The bore is in finding a point to come to.  Besides, the chances are that any such point will have long ago been  worn blunt by a score of more active seekers. Alas!    Since I wrote the foregoing words, I have been out for a long walk,  in search of inspiration, through the streets of what is called the  West End. Snobbishly so called. Why draw these crude distinctions? We  all know that Mayfair happens to lie a few miles further west than  Whitechapel. It argues a lack of breeding to go on calling attention  to the fact. If the people of Whitechapel were less beautiful or less  well-mannered or more ignorant than we, there might be some excuse.  But they are not so. True, themselves talk about the East End, but  this only makes the matter worse. To a sensitive ear their phrase  has a ring of ironic humility that jars not less than our own coarse  boastfulness. Heaven knows they have a right to be ironic, and who  shall blame them for exercising it? All the same, this sort of thing  worries me horribly.    I said that I found Christmas rather agreeable than otherwise. But I  was speaking as one accustomed to live mostly in the past. The walk I  have just taken, refreshing in itself, has painfully reminded me that  I cannot hit it off with the present. My life is in the later days of  the eighteenth and the earlier days of the nineteenth century. This  twentieth affair is as a vision, dimly foreseen at odd moments, and  put from me with a slight shudder. My actual Christmases are spent  (say) in Holland House, which has but recently been built. Little  Charles Fox is allowed by his father to join us for the earlier stages  of dessert. I am conscious of patting him on the head and predicting  for him a distinguished future. A very bright little fellow, with  his father's eyes! Or again, I am down at Newstead. Byron is in his  wildest spirits, a shade too uproarious. I am glad to escape into  the park and stroll a quiet hour on the arm of Mr. Hughes Ball. Years  pass. The approach of Christmas finds one loth to leave one's usual  haunts. One is on one's way to one's club to dine with Postumus and  dear old \"Wigsby\" Pendennis, quietly at one's consecrated table near  the fireplace. As one is crossing St. James's Street an ear-piercing  grunt causes one to reel back just in time to be not run over by  a motor-car. Inside is a woman who scowls down at one through the  window--\"Serve you right if we'd gone over you.\" Yes, I often have  these awakenings to fact--or rather these provisions of what life  might be if I survived into the twentieth century. Alas!    I have mentioned that woman in the motor-car because she is germane  to my theme. She typifies the vices of the modern Christmas. For her,  by the absurd accident of her wealth, there is no distinction between  people who have not motor-cars and people who might as well be run  over. But I wrong her. If we others were all run over, there would be  no one before whom she could flaunt her loathsome air of superiority.  And what would she do then, poor thing? I doubt she would die of  boredom--painfully, one hopes. In the same way, if the shop-keepers  in Bond Street knew there was no one who could not afford to buy the  things in their windows, there would be an end to the display that  makes those windows intolerable (to you and me) during the month of  December. I had often suspected that the things there were not meant  to be bought by people who could buy them, but merely to irritate the  rest. This afternoon I was sure of it. Not in one window anything  a sane person would give to any one not an idiot, but everywhere a  general glossy grin out at people who are not plutocrats. This sort  of thing lashes me to ungovernable fury. The lion is roused, and I  recognise in myself a born leader of men. Be so good as to smash those  windows for me.    One does not like to think that Christmas has been snapped up, docked  of its old-world kindliness, and pressed into the service of an odious  ostentation. But so it has. Alas! The thought of Father Christmas  trudging through the snow to the homes of gentle and simple alike  (forgive that stupid, snobbish phrase) was agreeable. But Father  Christmas in red plush breeches, lounging on the doorstep of Sir  Gorgius Midas--one averts one's eyes.    I have--now I come to think of it--another objection to the modern  Christmas. It would be affectation to pretend not to know that  there are many Jews living in England, and in London especially. I  have always had a deep respect for that race, their distinction in  intellect and in character. Being not one of them, I may in their  behalf put a point which themselves would be the last to suggest. I  hope they will acquit me of impertinence in doing this. You, in your  turn, must acquit me of sentimentalism. The Jews are a minority, and  as such must take their chances. But may not a majority refrain from  pressing its rights to the utmost? It is well that we should celebrate  Christmas heartily, and all that. But we could do so without an  emphasis that seems to me, in the circumstances, 'tother side good  taste. \"Good taste\" is a hateful phrase. But it escaped me in the heat  of the moment. Alas!          THE FEAST    _By_    J*S*PH C*NR*D      The hut in which slept the white man was on a clearing between the  forest and the river. Silence, the silence murmurous and unquiet of a  tropical night, brooded over the hut that, baked through by the sun,  sweated a vapour beneath the cynical light of the stars. Mahamo lay  rigid and watchful at the hut's mouth. In his upturned eyes, and along  the polished surface of his lean body black and immobile, the stars  were reflected, creating an illusion of themselves who are illusions.    The roofs of the congested trees, writhing in some kind of agony  private and eternal, made tenebrous and shifty silhouettes against the  sky, like shapes cut out of black paper by a maniac who pushes them  with his thumb this way and that, irritably, on a concave surface of  blue steel. Resin oozed unseen from the upper branches to the trunks  swathed in creepers that clutched and interlocked with tendrils  venomous, frantic and faint. Down below, by force of habit, the  lush herbage went through the farce of growth--that farce old and  screaming, whose trite end is decomposition.    Within the hut the form of the white man, corpulent and pale, was  covered with a mosquito-net that was itself illusory like everything  else, only more so. Flying squadrons of mosquitoes inside its meshes  flickered and darted over him, working hard, but keeping silence so  as not to excite him from sleep. Cohorts of yellow ants disputed him  against cohorts of purple ants, the two kinds slaying one another  in thousands. The battle was undecided when suddenly, with no such  warning as it gives in some parts of the world, the sun blazed up over  the horizon, turning night into day, and the insects vanished back  into their camps.    The white man ground his knuckles into the corners of his eyes,  emitting that snore final and querulous of a middle-aged man awakened  rudely.
