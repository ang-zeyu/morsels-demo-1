Translated Into English in the Original Metres (#11)"],[1,"I'll wreak;  Yet, truly, I've some inclination  On summer holidays to seek  A little freedom and recreation.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Use well your time! It flies so swiftly from us;  But time through order may be won, I promise.  So, Friend (my views to briefly sum),  First, the _collegium logicum_.  There will your mind be drilled and braced,  As if in Spanish boots 'twere laced,  And thus, to graver paces brought,  'Twill plod along the path of thought,  Instead of shooting here and there,  A will-o'-the-wisp in murky air.  Days will be spent to bid you know,  What once you did at a single blow,  Like eating and drinking, free and strong,--  That one, two, three! thereto belong.  Truly the fabric of mental fleece  Resembles a weaver's masterpiece,  Where a thousand threads one treadle throws,  Where fly the shuttles hither and thither.  Unseen the threads are knit together.  And an infinite combination grows.  Then, the philosopher steps in  And shows, no otherwise it could have been:  The first was so, the second so,  Therefore the third and fourth are so;  Were not the first and second, then  The third and fourth had never been.  The scholars are everywhere believers,  But never succeed in being weavers.  He who would study organic existence,  First drives out the soul with rigid persistence;  Then the parts in his hand he may hold and class,  But the spiritual link is lost, alas!  _Encheiresin natures_, this Chemistry names,  Nor knows how herself she banters and blames!    STUDENT    I cannot understand you quite.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Your mind will shortly be set aright,  When you have learned, all things reducing,  To classify them for your using.    STUDENT    I feel as stupid, from all you've said,  As if a mill-wheel whirled in my head!    MEPHISTOPHELES    And after--first and foremost duty--Of  Metaphysics learn the use and beauty!  See that you most profoundly gain  What does not suit the human brain!  A splendid word to serve, you'll find  For what goes in--or won't go in--your mind.  But first, at least this half a year,  To order rigidly adhere;  Five hours a day, you understand,  And when the clock strikes, be on hand!  Prepare beforehand for your part  With paragraphs all got by heart,  So you can better watch, and look  That naught is said but what is in the book:  Yet in thy writing as unwearied be,  As did the Holy Ghost dictate to thee!    STUDENT    No need to tell me twice to do it!  I think, how useful 'tis to write;  For what one has, in black and white,  One carries home and then goes through it.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Yet choose thyself a faculty!    STUDENT    I cannot reconcile myself to Jurisprudence.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Nor can I therefore greatly blame you students:  I know what science this has come to be.  All rights and laws are still transmitted  Like an eternal sickness of the race,--  From generation unto generation fitted,  And shifted round from place to place.  Reason becomes a sham, Beneficence a worry:  Thou art a grandchild, therefore woe to thee!  The right born with us, ours in verity,  This to consider, there's, alas! no hurry.    STUDENT    My own disgust is strengthened by your speech:  O lucky he, whom you shall teach!  I've almost for Theology decided.    MEPHISTOPHELES    I should not wish to see you here misguided:  For, as regards this science, let me hint  'Tis very hard to shun the false direction;  There's so much secret poison lurking in 't,  So like the medicine, it baffles your detection.  Hear, therefore, one alone, for that is best, in sooth,  And simply take your master's words for truth.  On _words_ let your attention centre!  Then through the safest gate you'll enter  The temple-halls of Certainty.    STUDENT    Yet in the word must some idea be.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Of course! But only shun too over-sharp a tension,  For just where fails the comprehension,  A word steps promptly in as deputy.  With words 'tis excellent disputing;  Systems to words 'tis easy suiting;  On words 'tis excellent believing;  No word can ever lose a jot from thieving.    STUDENT    Pardon! With many questions I detain you.  Yet must I trouble you again.  Of Medicine I still would fain  Hear one strong word that might explain you.  Three years is but a little space.  And, God! who can the field embrace?  If one some index could be shown,  'Twere easier groping forward, truly.    MEPHISTOPHELES (_aside_)    I'm tired enough of this dry tone,--  Must play the Devil again, and fully.    (_Aloud_)    To grasp the spirit of Medicine is easy:  Learn of the great and little world your fill,  To let it go at last, so please ye,  Just as God will!  In vain that through the realms of science you may drift;  Each one learns only--just what learn he can:  Yet he who grasps the Moment's gift,  He is the proper man.  Well-made you are, 'tis not to be denied,  The rest a bold address will win you;  If you but in yourself confide,  At once confide all others in you.  To lead the women, learn the special feeling!  Their everlasting aches and groans,  In thousand tones,  Have all one source, one mode of healing;  And if your acts are half discreet,  You'll always have them at your feet.  A title first must draw and interest them,  And show that yours all other arts exceeds;  Then, as a greeting, you are free to touch and test them,  While, thus to do, for years another pleads.  You press and count the pulse's dances,  And then, with burning sidelong glances,  You clasp the swelling hips, to see  If tightly laced her corsets be.    STUDENT    That's better, now! The How and Where, one sees.    MEPHISTOPHELES    My worthy friend, gray are all theories,  And green alone Life's golden tree.    STUDENT    I swear to you, 'tis like a dream to me.  Might I again presume, with trust unbounded,  To hear your wisdom thoroughly expounded?    MEPHISTOPHELES    Most willingly, to what extent I may.    STUDENT    I cannot really go away:  Allow me that my album first I reach you,--  Grant me this favor, I beseech you!    MEPHISTOPHELES    Assuredly.    (_He writes, and returns the book_.)    STUDENT (_reads_)    _Eritis sicut Deus, scientes bonum et malum_.  (_Closes the book with reverence, and withdraws_)    MEPHISTOPHELES    Follow the ancient text, and the snake thou wast ordered to trample!  With all thy likeness to God, thou'lt yet be a sorry example!    (FAUST _enters_.)    FAUST    Now, whither shall we go?    MEPHISTOPHELES    As best it pleases thee.  The little world, and then the great, we'll see.  With what delight, what profit winning,  Shalt thou sponge through the term beginning!    FAUST    Yet with the flowing beard I wear,  Both ease and grace will fail me there.  The attempt, indeed, were a futile strife;  I never could learn the ways of life.  I feel so small before others, and thence  Should always find embarrassments.    MEPHISTOPHELES    My friend, thou soon shalt lose all such misgiving:  Be thou but self-possessed, thou hast the art of living!    FAUST    How shall we leave the house, and start?  Where hast thou servant, coach and horses?    MEPHISTOPHELES    We'll spread this cloak with proper art,  Then through the air direct our courses.  But only, on so bold a flight,  Be sure to have thy luggage light.  A little burning air, which I shall soon prepare us,  Above the earth will nimbly bear us,  And, if we're light, we'll travel swift and clear:  I gratulate thee on thy new career!

To-day you're like wet straw, so tame;  And usually you're all aflame.    BRANDER    Now that's your fault; from you we nothing see,  No beastliness and no stupidity.    FROSCH    (_Pours a glass of wine over_ BRANDER'S _head_.)  There's both together!    BRANDER    Twice a swine!    FROSCH    You wanted them: I've given you mine.

He's split my ears, that fellow.    SIEBEL    When the vault echoes to the song,  One first perceives the bass is deep and strong.    FROSCH    Well said! and out with him that takes the least offence!  _Ah, tara, lara da_!    ALTMAYER    _Ah, tara, lara, da_!    FROSCH    The throats are tuned, commence!

Thank God, each morning, therefore,  That you have not the Roman realm to care for!  At least, I hold it so much gain for me,  That I nor Chancellor nor Kaiser be.  Yet also we must have a ruling head, I hope,  And so we'll choose ourselves a Pope.  You know the quality that can  Decide the choice, and elevate the man.

I'll wait my proper time for laughter:  Me by the nose she led, and now she'll lead you after.  Her paramour should be an ugly gnome,  Where four roads cross, in wanton play to meet her:  An old he-goat, from Blocksberg coming home,  Should his good-night in lustful gallop bleat her!  A fellow made of genuine flesh and blood  Is for the wench a deal too good.  Greet her? Not I: unless, when meeting,  To smash her windows be a greeting!

Then she put her eyeglass up, and gazed at her  show pupil disturbedly.    \"Becky!\" she exclaimed.  \"My dearest Sara!\"    Sara advanced a step toward her.    \"I want her because I know she will like to see the presents,\" she  explained.  \"She is a little girl, too, you know.\"    Miss Minchin was scandalized.  She glanced from one figure to the other.    \"My dear Sara,\" she said, \"Becky is the scullery maid. Scullery  maids--er--are not little girls.\"    It really had not occurred to her to think of them in that light.  Scullery maids were machines who carried coal scuttles and made fires.    \"But Becky is,\" said Sara.  \"And I know she would enjoy herself.  Please let her stay--because it is my birthday.\"    Miss Minchin replied with much dignity:    \"As you ask it as a birthday favor--she may stay.  Rebecca, thank Miss  Sara for her great kindness.\"    Becky had been backing into the corner, twisting the hem of her apron  in delighted suspense.  She came forward, bobbing curtsies, but between  Sara's eyes and her own there passed a gleam of friendly understanding,  while her words tumbled over each other.    \"Oh, if you please, miss!  I'm that grateful, miss!  I did want to see  the doll, miss, that I did.  Thank you, miss.  And thank you,  ma'am,\"--turning and making an alarmed bob to Miss Minchin--\"for  letting me take the liberty.\"    Miss Minchin waved her hand again--this time it was in the direction of  the corner near the door.    \"Go and stand there,\" she commanded.  \"Not too near the young ladies.\"    Becky went to her place, grinning.  She did not care where she was  sent, so that she might have the luck of being inside the room, instead  of being downstairs in the scullery, while these delights were going  on.  She did not even mind when Miss Minchin cleared her throat  ominously and spoke again.    \"Now, young ladies, I have a few words to say to you,\" she announced.    \"She's going to make a speech,\" whispered one of the girls. \"I wish it  was over.\"    Sara felt rather uncomfortable.  As this was her party, it was probable  that the speech was about her.  It is not agreeable to stand in a  schoolroom and have a speech made about you.    \"You are aware, young ladies,\" the speech began--for it was a  speech--\"that dear Sara is eleven years old today.\"    \"DEAR Sara!\" murmured Lavinia.    \"Several of you here have also been eleven years old, but Sara's  birthdays are rather different from other little girls' birthdays. When  she is older she will be heiress to a large fortune, which it will be  her duty to spend in a meritorious manner.\"    \"The diamond mines,\" giggled Jessie, in a whisper.    Sara did not hear her; but as she stood with her green-gray eyes fixed  steadily on Miss Minchin, she felt herself growing rather hot. When  Miss Minchin talked about money, she felt somehow that she always hated  her--and, of course, it was disrespectful to hate grown-up people.    \"When her dear papa, Captain Crewe, brought her from India and gave her  into my care,\" the speech proceeded, \"he said to me, in a jesting way,  'I am afraid she will be very rich, Miss Minchin.' My reply was, 'Her  education at my seminary, Captain Crewe, shall be such as will adorn  the largest fortune.'  Sara has become my most accomplished pupil. Her  French and her dancing are a credit to the seminary.  Her  manners--which have caused you to call her Princess Sara--are perfect.  Her amiability she exhibits by giving you this afternoon's party. I  hope you appreciate her generosity.  I wish you to express your  appreciation of it by saying aloud all together, 'Thank you, Sara!'\"    The entire schoolroom rose to its feet as it had done the morning Sara  remembered so well.    \"Thank you, Sara!\" it said, and it must be confessed that Lottie jumped  up and down.  Sara looked rather shy for a moment. She made a  curtsy--and it was a very nice one.    \"Thank you,\" she said, \"for coming to my party.\"    \"Very pretty, indeed, Sara,\" approved Miss Minchin.  \"That is what a  real princess does when the populace applauds her.  Lavinia\"--scathingly--\"the sound you just made was extremely like a  snort.  If you are jealous of your fellow-pupil, I beg you will express  your feelings in some more lady-like manner.  Now I will leave you to  enjoy yourselves.\"    The instant she had swept out of the room the spell her presence always  had upon them was broken.  The door had scarcely closed before every  seat was empty.  The little girls jumped or tumbled out of theirs; the  older ones wasted no time in deserting theirs. There was a rush toward  the boxes.  Sara had bent over one of them with a delighted face.    \"These are books, I know,\" she said.    The little children broke into a rueful murmur, and Ermengarde looked  aghast.    \"Does your papa send you books for a birthday present?\" she exclaimed.  \"Why, he's as bad as mine.  Don't open them, Sara.\"    \"I like them,\" Sara laughed, but she turned to the biggest box.  When  she took out the Last Doll it was so magnificent that the children  uttered delighted groans of joy, and actually drew back to gaze at it  in breathless rapture.    \"She is almost as big as Lottie,\" someone gasped.    Lottie clapped her hands and danced about, giggling.    \"She's dressed for the theater,\" said Lavinia.  \"Her cloak is lined  with ermine.\"    \"Oh,\" cried Ermengarde, darting forward, \"she has an opera-glass in her  hand--a blue-and-gold one!\"    \"Here is her trunk,\" said Sara.  \"Let us open it and look at her  things.\"    She sat down upon the floor and turned the key.  The children crowded  clamoring around her, as she lifted tray after tray and revealed their  contents.  Never had the schoolroom been in such an uproar. There were  lace collars and silk stockings and handkerchiefs; there was a jewel  case containing a necklace and a tiara which looked quite as if they  were made of real diamonds; there was a long sealskin and muff, there  were ball dresses and walking dresses and visiting dresses; there were  hats and tea gowns and fans. Even Lavinia and Jessie forgot that they  were too elderly to care for dolls, and uttered exclamations of delight  and caught up things to look at them.    \"Suppose,\" Sara said, as she stood by the table, putting a large,  black-velvet hat on the impassively smiling owner of all these  splendors--\"suppose she understands human talk and feels proud of being  admired.\"    \"You are always supposing things,\" said Lavinia, and her air was very  superior.    \"I know I am,\" answered Sara, undisturbedly.  \"I like it.  There is  nothing so nice as supposing.  It's almost like being a fairy.  If you  suppose anything hard enough it seems as if it were real.\"    \"It's all very well to suppose things if you have everything,\" said  Lavinia.  \"Could you suppose and pretend if you were a beggar and lived  in a garret?\"    Sara stopped arranging the Last Doll's ostrich plumes, and looked  thoughtful.    \"I BELIEVE I could,\" she said.  \"If one was a beggar, one would have to  suppose and pretend all the time.  But it mightn't be easy.\"    She often thought afterward how strange it was that just as she had  finished saying this--just at that very moment--Miss Amelia came into  the room.    \"Sara,\" she said, \"your papa's solicitor, Mr. Barrow, has called to see  Miss Minchin, and, as she must talk to him alone and the refreshments  are laid in her parlor, you had all better come and have your feast  now, so that my sister can have her interview here in the schoolroom.\"    Refreshments were not likely to be disdained at any hour, and many  pairs of eyes gleamed.  Miss Amelia arranged the procession into  decorum, and then, with Sara at her side heading it, she led it away,  leaving the Last Doll sitting upon a chair with the glories of her  wardrobe scattered about her; dresses and coats hung upon chair backs,  piles of lace-frilled petticoats lying upon their seats.    Becky, who was not expected to partake of refreshments, had the  indiscretion to linger a moment to look at these beauties--it really  was an indiscretion.    \"Go back to your work, Becky,\" Miss Amelia had said; but she had  stopped to pick up reverently first a muff and then a coat, and while  she stood looking at them adoringly, she heard Miss Minchin upon the  threshold, and, being smitten with terror at the thought of being  accused of taking liberties, she rashly darted under the table, which  hid her by its tablecloth.    Miss Minchin came into the room, accompanied by a sharp-featured, dry  little gentleman, who looked rather disturbed.  Miss Minchin herself  also looked rather disturbed, it must be admitted, and she gazed at the  dry little gentleman with an irritated and puzzled expression.    She sat down with stiff dignity, and waved him to a chair.    \"Pray, be seated, Mr. Barrow,\" she said.    Mr. Barrow did not sit down at once.  His attention seemed attracted by  the Last Doll and the things which surrounded her.  He settled his  eyeglasses and looked at them in nervous disapproval. The Last Doll  herself did not seem to mind this in the least. She merely sat upright  and returned his gaze indifferently.    \"A hundred pounds,\" Mr. Barrow remarked succinctly. \"All expensive  material, and made at a Parisian modiste's. He spent money lavishly  enough, that young man.\"    Miss Minchin felt offended.  This seemed to be a disparagement of her  best patron and was a liberty.    Even solicitors had no right to take liberties.    \"I beg your pardon, Mr. Barrow,\" she said stiffly.  \"I do not  understand.\"    \"Birthday presents,\" said Mr. Barrow in the same critical manner, \"to a  child eleven years old!  Mad extravagance, I call it.\"    Miss Minchin drew herself up still more rigidly.    \"Captain Crewe is a man of fortune,\" she said.  \"The diamond mines  alone--\"    Mr. Barrow wheeled round upon her.  \"Diamond mines!\" he broke out.  \"There are none!  Never were!\"    Miss Minchin"]]]
