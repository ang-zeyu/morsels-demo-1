STUFFED FIGS    Cut a slit in the side of dried figs, take out some of the pulp  with the tip of a teaspoon. Mix with one-quarter cup of the pulp and  one-quarter cup of finely chopped crystalized ginger, a teaspoon of  grated orange or lemon rind; and a tablespoon of lemon juice. Fill the  figs with mixture, stuffing them so that they look plump.          SUGARLESS PRESERVES      QUINCE OR PEAR PRESERVES      1 lb. fruit    1 cup corn syrup    1/4 lb. ginger root or 2 oz. crystalized ginger    Steam or cook sliced and pared fruit in small amount of water until  tender.

APPLE, QUINCE, PEACH, PEAR OR PLUM JAM      1 cup left-over cooked fruit or pulp from skins and core    3/4 cup corn syrup    2 tablespoons vinegar    1/2 teaspoon mixed ground spices, allspice, cloves and nutmeg    Cook slowly until thick.      PUMPKIN OR CARROT MARMALADE    Reduce 1 pint grape juice one-half by boiling slowly. Add 1 cup  vegetables (pumpkin or carrot). Add 2 teaspoons spices and 1 cup corn  syrup. Boil until of consistency of honey and place in sterilized jars  or glasses.      GRAPE JUICE      5 lb. grapes    1 pint water    1 cup corn syrup    Cook grapes in water until soft. Mash; drain through jelly bag or  wet cheesecloth. Add corn syrup. Boil 5 minutes. Put into sterilized  bottles. If cork stoppers are used cover them with melted sealing wax.      SYRUP FOR SPICED APPLES, PEARS, PEACHES, GRAPES      1 cup corn syrup    2 oz. stick cinnamon    12 allspice berries    6 whole cloves    1/4 cup vinegar    Boil 5 minutes. Add any fruit and cook slowly 20 minutes or until  fruit is clear and syrup thick. If hard fruits, such as pears,  quinces, etc., are used, steam for 20 minutes before adding to syrup.      SYRUP FOR CANNED FRUIT      1 cup corn syrup    1 cup water    Bring to boiling point. Use same as sugar and water syrup.      SYRUP FOR PRESERVED FRUIT      2 cups crystal corn syrup       For each three pounds of fruit    1/2 cup water    Use same as water and sugar syrup.      CRANBERRY JELLY      1 pint cranberries    1/2 cup water    About 1 cup corn syrup    Cook cranberries in water very slowly until tender. Leave whole or  press through colander. Measure amount of mixture and add equal amount  of corn syrup. Cook slowly until mixture forms jelly when tested on  cold plate. Turn into mold which has been rinsed in cold water.      APRICOT AND RAISIN MARMALADE      1 cup of apricots    1-1/2 cups cold water    1 cup corn syrup    1/2 cup chopped seeded raisins    1 teaspoon orange rind    Soak apricots and raisins in the water two hours.

[Illustration]          SAVE FAT    _REASONS WHY OUR GOVERNMENT ASKS US TO SAVE FAT, WITH PRACTICAL  RECIPES FOR FAT CONSERVATION_      With the world-wide decrease of animal production, animal fats are now  growing so scarce that the world is being scoured for new sources of  supply. Our Government has asked the housewife to conserve all the  fats that come to her home and utilize them to the best advantage. To  this end it is necessary to have some knowledge of the character of  different fats and the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15478"],[0,"New York Times Current History: The European War, Vol 2, No. 1, April, 1915 (#11)"],[1,"be briefly summarized here. Economists,  statisticians, physiologists, agricultural chemists, food specialists,  and geologists have all taken part in producing a composite view of the  whole subject; it is not a book of special contributions by individual  specialists, but is written in one cast and represents the compared and  boiled-down conclusions of the sixteen scholars.    The authors by no means regard the problem of feeding Germany without  foreign assistance as an easy and simple one; on the contrary, they say  it is a serious one, and calls for the supreme effort of the authorities  and of every individual German; and only by energetic, systematic, and  continued efforts of Government and people can they prevent a shortage  of food from negativing the success of German arms. Yet they feel bound  to grapple the problem as one calling for solution by the German people  alone, for very small imports of food products can be expected from the  neutral countries of Europe, and none at all from the United States and  other oversea countries, and the small quantities that do come in will  hardly be more than enough to make good the drain upon Germany's own  available stocks in helping to feed the people of Belgium and Poland.    The simplest statistical elements of the problem are the following:  Germany, with a population of 68,000,000, was consuming food products,  when the war broke out, equivalent to an aggregate of 90,420 billion  calories, including 2,307,000 tons of albumen; whereas the amount now  available, under unchanged methods of living and feeding, is equal to  only 67,870 billion calories, with 1,543,000 tons of albumen. Thus,  there will be an apparent deficit of 22,590 billion calories and 764,000  tons of albumen. On the other hand, the authors hold that the minimum  physiological requirements are only 56,750 billion calories, containing  1,605,000 tons of albumen, which would give a large surplus of calories  and a small deficit of albumen, but they make certain recommendations  which, if carried into effect, would bring the available supply up to  81,250 billion calories and 2,023,000 tons of albumen.    Germany raises (average for 1912-13) about 4,500,000 tons of wheat and  imports nearly 2,000,000 tons, (about 73,000,000 bushels.) On the other  hand, it exports about 530,000 tons net of the 11,900,000 tons of rye  produced. It imports nearly 3,000,000 tons of low-grade barley and about  1,000,000 of maize, both chiefly for feeding stock. Its net imports of  grain and legumes are 6,270,000 tons. Of its fruit consumption, about 30  per cent. has been imported. While Germany has been producing nearly its  entire meat supply at home, this has been accomplished only by the very  extensive use of foreign feedstuffs. The authors of this work estimate  that the imports of meats and animals, together with the product from  domestic animals fed with foreign feedstuffs, amount to not less than 33  per cent. of the total consumption. They also hold that about 58 per  cent. of the milk consumed in Germany represents imports and the product  of cows fed with foreign feedstuffs. Nearly 40 per cent. of the egg  consumption was hitherto imported. The consumption of fish has averaged  576,000 tons, of which not less than 62 per cent. was imported; and the  home fisheries are now confined, besides the internal waters, almost  wholly to the Baltic Sea--which means the loss of the catch of 142,000  tons hitherto taken from the North Sea. Even the German's favorite  beverage, beer, contains 13 per cent. of imported ingredients.    The authors assume, as already intimated, that nearly all of these  imports will be lost to Germany during the full duration of the war, and  they take up, under this big limitation, the problem of showing how  Germany can live upon its own resources and go on fighting till it wins.  They undertake to show how savings can be made in the use of the  supplies on hand, and also how production can be increased or changed so  as to keep the country supplied with food products.    In the first place, they insist that the prohibition of the export of  grain be made absolute; in other words, the small exception made in  favor of Switzerland, which has usually obtained most of its grain from  Germany, must be canceled. Savings in the present supplies of grain and  feedstuffs must be made by a considerable reduction in the live stock,  inasmuch as the grain, potatoes, turnips, and other stuffs fed to  animals will support a great many more men if consumed directly by them.  From the stock of cattle the poorer milkers must be eliminated and  converted into beef, 10 per cent. of the milch cows to be thus disposed,  of. Then swine, in particular, must be slaughtered down to 65 per cent.  of the present number, they being great consumers of material suitable  for human food. In Germany much skim milk and buttermilk is fed to  swine; the authors demand that this partial waste of very valuable  albumens be stopped. The potato crop--of which Germany produces above  50,000,000 tons a year, or much more than any other land--must be more  extensively drawn upon than hitherto for feeding the people. To this end  potato-drying establishments must be multiplied; these will turn out a  rough product for feeding animals, and a better sort for table use. It  may be added here that the Prussian Government last Autumn decided to  give financial aid to agricultural organizations for erecting drying  plants; also, that the Imperial Government has decreed that potatoes up  to a maximum of 30 per cent. may be used by the bakers in making  bread--a measure which will undoubtedly make the grain supply suffice  till the 1915 crop is harvested. It is further recommended that more  vegetables be preserved, whether directly in cold storage or by canning  or pickling. Moreover, the industrial use of fats suitable for human  food (as in making soaps, lubricating oils, &c.) must be stopped, and  people must eat less meat, less butter, and more vegetables. Grain must  not be converted into starch. People must burn coke rather than coal,  for the coking process yields the valuable by-product of sulphate of  ammonia, one of the most valuable of fertilizers, and greatly needed by  German farmers now owing to the stoppage of imports of nitrate of soda  from Chile.    In considering how the German people may keep up their production of  food, the authors find that various factors will work against such a  result. In the first place, there is a shortage of labor, nearly all the  able-bodied young and middle-aged men in the farming districts being in  the war. There is also a scarcity of horses, some 500,000 head having  already been requisitioned for army use, and the imports of about  140,000 head (chiefly from Russia) have almost wholly ceased. The people  must therefore resort more extensively to the use of motor plows, and  the State Governments must give financial assistance to insure this  wherever necessary; and such plows on hand must be kept more steadily in  use through company ownership or rental. It may be remarked here, again,  that the Prussian Government is also assisting agricultural  organizations to buy motor plows. The supply of fertilizers has also  been cut down by the war. Nitrate has just been mentioned. The authors  recommend that the Government solve this problem by having many of the  existing electrical plants turn partly to recovering nitrogen from the  atmosphere. This, they say, could be done without reducing the present  production of electricity for ordinary purposes, since only 19 per cent.  of the effective capacity of the 2,000,000 horse power producible by the  electrical plants of Germany is actually used. The supply of phosphoric  fertilizers is also endangered through the stoppage of imports of  phosphate rock (nearly 1,000,000 tons a year) as well as the material  from which to make sulphuric acid; also, through the reduction in the  production of the iron furnaces of the country, from the slag of which  over 2,000,000 tons of so-called Thomas phosphate flour was produced,  will involve a big reduction in the make of that valuable fertilizer.  Thus, there is a lack of horses, of fertilizers, and of the guiding hand  of man. This last, however, can be partly supplied by utilizing for farm  work such of the prisoners of war as come from the farm. As Germany now  holds considerably more than 600,000 prisoners, it can draw many farm  laborers from among them. Prisoners are already used in large numbers in  recovering moorland for agricultural purposes.    This latter remark suggests one of the recommendations of the authors  for increasing agricultural production--the increased recovery of  moorlands. They show that Germany has at least 52,000 square miles (more  than 33,000,000 acres) of moors convertible into good arable land,  which, with proper fertilizing, can be made at once richly productive;  they yield particularly large crops of grain and potatoes. Moreover, the  State Governments must undertake the division of large landed estates  among small proprietors wherever possible--and this is more possible  just now than ever, owing to the fact that many large owners have been  killed in battle. The reason for such a division is that the small  holder gets more out of the acre than the large proprietor.    As Germany makes a large surplus of sugar, the authors advise that the  area planted in beets be reduced and the land thus liberated be planted  in grain, potatoes, and turnips; as a matter of fact, it is reported  that the Government is now considering the question of reducing the  beetroot acreage by one-fourth. The authors also recommend that sugar be  used to some extent in feeding stock, sweeting low-grade hay and roots  with it to make them more palatable and nutritious. It is also regarded  as profitable to leave 20 per cent. of sugar in the beets, so as to  secure a more"]]]
