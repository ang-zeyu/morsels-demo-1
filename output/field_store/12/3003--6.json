The other, the fern-hole, was in a fern thicket next the clover field.  It was small and damp, and useless except as a last retreat. It also was  the work of a woodchuck, a well-meaning, friendly neighbor, but a  hare-brained youngster whose skin in the form of a whip-lash was now  developing higher horse-power in the Olifant working team.    \"Simple justice,\" said the old man, \"for that hide was raised on stolen  feed that the team would 'a' turned into horse-power anyway.\"    The Cottontails were now sole owners of the holes, and did not go near  them when they could help it, lest anything like a path should be made  that might betray these last retreats to an enemy.    There was also the hollow hickory, which, though nearly fallen, was  still green, and had the great advantage of being open at both ends.  This had long been the residence of one Lotor, a solitary old coon whose  ostensible calling was frog-hunting, and who, like the monks of old, was  supposed to abstain from all flesh food. But it was shrewdly suspected  that he needed but a chance to indulge in a diet of rabbit. When at last  one dark night he was killed while raiding Olifant's hen-house, Molly,  so far from feeling a pang of regret, took possession of his cosy nest  with a sense of unbounded relief.          IV      Bright August sunlight was flooding the Swamp in the morning. Everything  seemed soaking in the warm radiance. A little brown swamp-sparrow was  teetering on a long rush in the pond. Beneath him there were open spaces  of dirty water that brought down a few scraps of the blue sky, and  worked it and the yellow duckweed into an exquisite mosaic, with a  little wrong-side picture of the bird in the middle. On the bank behind  was a great vigorous growth of golden green skunk-cabbage, that cast a  dense shadow over the brown swamp tussocks.    The eyes of the swamp-sparrow were not trained to take in the color  glories, but he saw what we might have missed; that two of the  numberless leafy brown bumps under the broad cabbage-leaves were furry,  living things, with noses that never ceased to move up and down whatever  else was still.    It was Molly and Rag. They were stretched under the skunk-cabbage, not  because they liked its rank smell, but because the winged ticks could  not stand it at all and so left them in peace.    Rabbits have no set time for lessons, they are always learning; but what  the lesson is depends on the present stress, and that must arrive  before it is known. They went to this place for a quiet rest, but had  not been long there when suddenly a warning note from the ever-watchful  bluejay caused Molly's nose and ears to go up and her tail to tighten to  her back. Away across the Swamp was Olifant's big black and white dog,  coming straight toward them.    \"Now,\" said Molly, \"squat while I go and keep that fool out of  mischief.\" Away she went to meet him and she fearlessly dashed across  the dog's path.    \"Bow-ow-ow,\" he fairly yelled as he bounded after Molly, but she kept  just beyond his reach and led him where the million daggers struck fast  and deep, till his tender ears were scratched raw, and guided him at  last plump into a hidden barbed-wire fence, where he got such a gashing  that he went homeward howling with pain. After making a short double, a  loop and a baulk in case the dog should come back, Molly returned to  find that Rag in his eagerness was standing bolt upright and craning his  neck to see the sport.    This disobedience made her so angry that she struck him with her hind  foot and knocked him over in the mud.    One day as they fed on the near clover field a red-tailed hawk came  swooping after them. Molly kicked up her hind legs to make fun of him  and skipped into the briers along one of their old pathways, where of  course the hawk could not follow. It was the main path from the  Creekside Thicket to the Stove-pipe brush-pile. Several creepers had  grown across it, and Molly, keeping one eye on the hawk, set to work and  cut the creepers off. Rag watched her, then ran on ahead, and cut some  more that were across the path. \"That's right,\" said Molly, \"always keep  the runways clear, you will need them often enough. Not wide, but clear.  Cut everything like a creeper across them and some day you will find you  have cut a snare. \"A what?\" asked Rag, as he scratched his right ear  with his left hind foot.    \"A snare is something that looks like a creeper, but it doesn't grow and  it's worse than all the hawks in the world,\" said Molly, glancing at the  now far-away red-tail, \"for there it hides night and day in the runway  till the chance to catch you comes.\"    \"I don't believe it could catch me,\" said Rag, with the pride of youth  as he rose on his heels to rub his chin and whiskers high up on a smooth  sapling. Rag did not know he was doing this, but his mother saw and  knew it was a sign, like the changing of a boy's voice, that her little  one was no longer a baby but would soon be a grown-up Cottontail.          V      There is magic in running water. Who does not know it and feel it? The  railroad builder fearlessly throws his bank across the wide bog or lake,  or the sea itself, but the tiniest rill of running water he treats with  great respect, studies its wish and its way and gives it all it seems to  ask. The thirst-parched traveller in the poisonous alkali deserts holds  back in deadly fear from the sedgy ponds till he finds one down whose  centre is a thin, clear line, and a faint flow, the sign of running,  living water, and joyfully he drinks.    There is magic in running water, no evil spell can cross it. Tam  O'Shanter proved its potency in time of sorest need. The wild-wood  creature with its deadly foe following tireless on the trail scent,  realizes its nearing doom and feels an awful spell. Its strength is  spent, its every trick is tried in vain till the good Angel leads it to  the water, the running, living water, and dashing in it follows the  cooling stream, and then with force renewed takes to the woods again.    There is magic in running water. The hounds come to the very spot and  halt and cast about; and halt and cast in vain. Their spell is broken by  the merry stream, and the wild thing lives its life.    And this was one of the great secrets that Raggylug learned from his  mother--\"after the Brierrose, the Water is your friend.\"    One hot, muggy night in August, Molly led Rag through the woods. The  cotton-white cushion she wore under her tail twinkled ahead and was his  guiding lantern, though it went out as soon as she stopped and sat on  it. After a few runs and stops to listen, they came to the edge of the  pond. The hylas in the trees above them were singing '_sleep, sleep,_'  and away out on a sunken log in the deep water, up to his chin in the  cooling bath, a bloated bullfrog was singing the praises of a '_jug o'  rum._'    \"Follow me still,\" said Molly, in rabbit, and 'flop' she went into the  pond and struck out for the sunken log in the middle. Rag flinched but  plunged with a little 'ouch,' gasping and wobbling his nose very fast  but still copying his mother. The same movements as on land sent him  through the water, and thus he found he could swim. On he went till he  reached the sunken log and scrambled up by his dripping mother on the  high dry end, with a rushy screen around them and the Water that tells  no tales. After this in warm, black nights, when that old fox from  Springfield came prowling through the Swamp, Rag would note the place of  the bullfrog's voice, for in case of direst need it might be a guide to  safety. And thenceforth the words of the song that the bullfrog sang  were, '_Come, come, in danger come_.'    This was the latest study that Rag took up with his mother-it was really  a post-graduate course, for many little rabbits never learn it at all.          VI      No wild animal dies of old age. Its life has soon or late a tragic end.  It is only a question of how long it can hold out against its foes. But  Rag's life was proof that once a rabbit passes out of his youth he is  likely to outlive his prime and be killed only in the last third of  life, the downhill third we call old age.    The Cottontails had enemies on every side. Their daily life was a series  of escapes. For dogs, foxes, cats, skunks, coons, weasels, minks,  snakes, hawks, owls, and men, and even insects were all plotting to  kill them. They had hundreds of adventures, and at least once a day they  had to fly for their lives and save themselves by their legs and wits.    More than once that hateful fox from Springfield drove them to taking  refuge under the wreck of a barbed-wire hog-pen by the spring. But once  there they could look calmly at him while he spiked his legs in vain  attempts to reach them.    Once or twice Rag when hunted had played off the hound against a skunk  that had seemed likely to be quite as dangerous as the dog.    Once he was caught alive by a hunter who had a hound and a ferret to  help him. But Rag had the luck to escape next day, with a yet deeper  distrust of ground holes. He was several times run into the water by the  cat, and many times was chased by hawks and owls, but for each kind of  danger there was a safeguard. His mother taught him the principal  dodges, and he improved on them and made many new ones as he grew older.  And the older and wiser he grew the less he trusted to his legs, and the  more to his wits for safety.    Ranger was the name of a young hound in the neighborhood. To train him  his master used to put him on the trail of one of the Cottontails. It  was nearly always Rag that they ran, for the young buck enjoyed the runs  as much as they did, the spice of danger in them being just enough for  zest. He would say:    \"Oh, mother! here comes the dog again, I must have a run to-day.\"    \"You are too bold, Raggy, my son!\" she might "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14241"],[0,"More English Fairy Tales (#11)"],[1,"to perform his task. When he reached the wood, he laid himself  down to think what course he would follow, for he knew how weak he was  compared to those he had undertaken to kill. He had not waited long,  when he saw them coming with a waggon to fetch wood for fuel. My! they  were big ones, with huge heads and long tusks for teeth. Johnny hid  himself in the hollow of a tree, thinking only of his own safety.  Feeling himself safe, he peeped out of his hiding-place, and watched the  two at work. Thus watching he formed his plan of action. He picked up a  pebble, threw it with force at one of them, and struck him a sharp blow  on the head. The giant in his pain turned at once on his companion, and  blamed him in strong words for hitting him. The other denied in anger  that he had thrown the pebble. John now saw himself on the high way to  gain his reward and the hand of the King's daughter. He kept still, and  carefully watched for an opportunity of striking another blow. He soon  found it, and right against the giant's head went another pebble. The  injured giant fell on his companion in fury, and the two belaboured each  other till they were utterly tired out. They sat down on a log to  breathe, rest, and recover themselves.    While sitting, one of them said, \"Well, all the King's army was not able  to take us, but I fear an old woman with a rope's end would be too much  for us now.\"    \"If that be so,\" said Johnny Gloke, as he sprang, bold as a lion, from  his hiding-place, \"What do you say to Johnny Gloke with his old roosty  sword?\" So saying he fell upon them, cut off their heads, and returned  in triumph. He received the King's daughter in marriage and for a time  lived in peace and happiness. He never told the mode he followed in his  dealing with the giants.    Some time after a rebellion broke out among the subjects of his  father-in-law. John, on the strength of his former valiant deed, was  chosen to quell the rebellion. His heart sank within him, but he could  not refuse, and so lose his great name. He was mounted on the fiercest  horse that ever saw sun or wind, and set out on his desperate task. He  was not accustomed to ride on horseback, and he soon lost all control of  his steed. It galloped off at full speed, in the direction of the rebel  army. In its wild career it passed under the gallows that stood by the  wayside. The gallows was somewhat old and frail, and down it fell on the  horse's neck. Still the horse made no stop, but always forward at  furious speed towards the rebels. On seeing this strange sight  approaching towards them at such a speed they were seized with terror,  and cried out to one another, \"There comes Johnny Gloke that killed the  two giants with the gallows on his horse's neck to hang us all.\" They  broke their ranks, fled in dismay, and never stopped till they reached  their homes. Thus was Johnny Gloke a second time victorious. So in due  time he came to the throne and lived a long, happy, and good life as  king.          Coat o' Clay      Once on a time, in the parts of Lindsey, there lived a wise woman. Some  said she was a witch, but they said it in a whisper, lest she should  overhear and do them a mischief, and truly it was not a thing one could  be sure of, for she was never known to hurt any one, which, if she were  a witch, she would have been sure to do. But she could tell you what  your sickness was, and how to cure it with herbs, and she could mix rare  possets that would drive the pain out of you in a twinkling; and she  could advise you what to do if your cows were ill, or if you'd got into  trouble, and tell the maids whether their sweethearts were likely to be  faithful.    But she was ill-pleased if folks questioned her too much or too long,  and she sore misliked fools. A many came to her asking foolish things,  as was their nature, and to them she never gave counsel--at least of a  kind that could aid them much.    Well, one day, as she sat at her door paring potatoes, over the stile  and up the path came a tall lad with a long nose and goggle eyes and his  hands in his pockets.    \"That's a fool, if ever was one, and a fool's luck in his face,\" said  the wise woman to herself with a nod of her head, and threw a potato  skin over her left shoulder to keep off ill-chance.    \"Good-day, missis,\" said the fool. \"I be come to see thee.\"    \"So thou art,\" said the wise woman; \"I see that. How's all in thy folk  this year?\"    \"Oh, fairly,\" answered he. \"But they say I be a fool.\"    \"Ay, so thou art,\" nodded she, and threw away a bad potato. \"I see that  too. But wouldst o' me? I keep no brains for sale.\"    \"Well, see now. Mother says I'll ne'er be wiser all my born days; but  folks tell us thou canst do everything. Can't thee teach me a bit, so  they'll think me a clever fellow at home?\"    \"Hout-tout!\" said the wise woman; \"thou 'rt a bigger fool than I  thought. Nay, I can't teach thee nought, lad; but I tell thee summat.  Thou 'lt be a fool all thy days till thou gets a coat o' clay; and then  thou 'lt know more than me.\"    \"Hi, missis; what sort of a coat's that?\" said he.    \"That's none o' my business,\" answered she, \"Thou 'st got to find out  that.\"    And she took up her potatoes and went into her house.    The fool took off his cap and scratched his head.    \"It's a queer kind of coat to look for, sure-_ly_,\" said he, \"I never  heard of a coat o' clay. But then I be a fool, that's true.\"    So he walked on till he came to the drain near by, with just a pickle of  water and a foot of mud in it.    \"Here's muck,\" said the fool, much pleased, and he got in and rolled in  it spluttering. \"Hi, yi!\" said he--for he had his mouth full--\"I've got  a coat o' clay now to be sure. I'll go home and tell my mother I'm a  wise man and not a fool any longer.\" And he went on home.    Presently he came to a cottage with a lass at the door.    \"Morning, fool,\" said she; \"hast thou been ducked in the horse-pond?\"    \"Fool yourself,\" said he, \"the wise woman says I'll know more 'n she  when I get a coat o' clay, and here it is. Shall I marry thee, lass?\"    \"Ay,\" said she, for she thought she'd like a fool for a husband, \"when  shall it be?\"    \"I'll come and fetch thee when I've told my mother,\" said the fool, and  he gave her his lucky penny and went on.    When he got home his mother was on the doorstep.    \"Mother, I 've got a coat o' clay,\" said he.    \"Coat o' muck,\" said she; \"and what of that?\"    \"Wise woman said I'd know more than she when I got a coat o' clay,\" said  he, \"so I down in the drain and got one, and I'm not a fool any longer.\"    \"Very good,\" said his mother, \"now thou canst get a wife.\"    \"Ay,\" said he, \"I'm going to marry so-an'-so.\"    \"What!\" said his mother, \"_that_ lass? No, and that thou 'lt not. She's  nought but a brat, with ne'er a cow or a cabbage o' her own.\"    \"But I gave her my luck penny,\" said the fool.    \"Then thou 'rt a bigger fool than ever, for all thy coat o' clay!\" said  his mother, and banged the door in his face.    \"Dang it!\" said the fool, and scratched his head, \"that's not the right  sort o' clay sure-_ly_.\"    So back he went to the highroad and sat down on the bank of the river  close by, looking at the water, which was cool and clear.    By-and-by he fell asleep, and before he knew what he was  about--plump--he rolled off into the river with a splash, and scrambled  out, dripping like a drowned rat.    \"Dear, dear,\" said he, \"I'd better go and get dry in the sun.\" So up he  went to the highroad, and lay down in the dust, rolling about so that  the sun should get at him all over.    Presently, when he sat up and looked down at himself, he found that the  dust had caked into a sort of skin over his wet clothes till you could  not see an inch of them, they were so well covered. \"Hi, yi!\" said he,  \"here's a coat o' clay ready made, and a fine one. See now, I'm a clever  fellow this time sure-_ly_, for I've found what I wanted without looking  for it! Wow, but it's a fine feeling to be so smart!\"    And he sat and scratched his head, and thought about his own cleverness.    But all of a sudden, round the corner came the squire on horseback, full  gallop, as if the boggles were after him; but the fool had to jump,  even though the squire pulled his horse back on his haunches.    \"What the dickens,\" said the squire, \"do you mean by lying in the middle  of the road like that?\"    \"Well, master,\" said the fool, \"I fell into the water and got wet, so I  lay down in the road to get dry; and I lay down a fool an' got up a wise  man.\"    \"How's that?\" said the squire.    So the fool told him about the wise woman and the coat o' clay.    \"Ah, ah!\" laughed the squire, \"whoever heard of a wise man lying in the  middle of the highroad to be ridden over? Lad, take my word for it, you  are a bigger fool than ever,\" and he rode on laughing.    \"Dang it!\" said the fool, as he scratched his head. \"I've not got the  right sort of coat yet, then.\" And he choked and spluttered in the dust  that the squire's horse had raised.    So on he went in a melancholy mood till he came to an inn, and the  landlord at his door smoking.    \"Well, fool,\" said he, \"thou 'rt fine and dirty.\"    \"Ay,\" said the fool, \"I be dirty outside an' dusty in, but it's not the  right thing yet.\"    And he told the landlord all about the wise woman and the coat o' clay.    \"Hout-tout!\" said the landlord, with a wink. \"I know what's wrong. Thou  'st got a skin o' dirt outside and all dry dust inside. Thou must  moisten it, lad, with a good drink, and then thou 'lt have a real  all-over coat o' clay.\"    \"Hi,\" said the fool, \"that's a good word.\"    So down he sat and began to drink. But it was wonderful how much liquor  it took to moisten so much dust; and each time he got to the bottom of  the pot he found he was still dry. At last he began to feel very merry  and pleased with himself.    \"Hi, yi!\" said he. \"I've got a real coat o' clay now outside and  "]]]
