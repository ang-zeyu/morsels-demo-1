A delay of a       few days in all probability would have spared Europe one of the       greatest wars in history.    On the other hand, be it remembered that the fact that any negotiations  between Austria and Russia were carried on up to the last hour was  solely the result of the uninterrupted German efforts to maintain  peace, which fact Sir Maurice de Bunsen very wisely buries in silence.  These negotiations, by the way, hardly were as promising of success as  is made to appear. The Austrian version of it is found in the Vienna  Fremdenblatt of Sept. 25, 1914. There the most important spots of  Bunsen's report, that Austria-Hungary had been ready to moderate several  points of its note to Servia, are mentioned, as follows:         As we are told by a well-informed source, these assertions do not       at all correspond to the facts; furthermore, from the very nature       of the steps undertaken by the dual monarchy in Belgrade, this       would have been entirely inconceivable.    A glance at the date shows that the Bunsen report is misleading, for he  himself tells that Count Berchtold, on July 30, had expressed his  consent to a continuation of the exchange of thought in Petersburg; the  latter, therefore, could not begin before the 31st, while in the night  from July 30 to 31 the mobilization of the entire Russian Army against  Germany was ordered in Petersburg, finally making impossible the  continuation of the last German attempt at mediation in Vienna.    The truth is, in spite of Russian and English twistings, that without  the interval caused by Germany's efforts in Vienna, which interval  England allowed to pass unused in Petersburg, the war would have broken  out a few days sooner.    Let us consider how the fact of the Russian mobilization, the dimensions  and tendency of which was brought to the knowledge of the London Cabinet  at the very latest on July 24, must affect Germany.    On July 24 the Russian Government declared, in an official communique,  it would be impossible for it to remain indifferent in an Austro-Servian  conflict.    Germany's Hand Forced.    This declaration was followed immediately by military measures which  represented the beginning of Russian mobilization long planned. But even  on July 27 the Russian Minister of War, Suchomlinof, assured  the German Military Attache upon word of honor (Annex 11 of the German  \"White Paper\") that no order for mobilization had been given and no  reservists had been drawn and no horse had been commandeered.    Although in this conversation there had been left no doubt to the  Russian Minister of War concerning the fact that measures of  mobilization against Austria must be considered by Germany also as very  threatening toward itself, during the next days news of the Russian  mobilization arrived in quick succession.    On the 29th mobilization of Southern and Southwestern Russia was  ordered, which was extended on the 30th to twenty-three provinces.    On the night of the 30th to the 31st, while the efforts of the Kaiser to  maintain peace were continuing and were receiving friendly attention in  Vienna, in St. Petersburg the mobilization of the entire Russian Army  was ordered. Even as late as 2 P.M. on the 31st, however, (German \"White  Paper,\" Page 18, of NEW YORK TIMES reprint,) the Czar telegraphed the  Kaiser that the military measures now being taken were meant for  defensive purposes against Austria's preparations, and he gave his  pledge as far away from desiring war.    In the face of such evident duplicity of Russian politics, a further  delay such as was desired by Sir Maurice de Bunsen would have been for  every German statesman a crime against the security of his own country.    On the other hand, upon what German measures did the Russian Government  base its order for mobilization? The British \"White Paper\" proves how  frivolously steps leading to the most serious results were ordered in  St. Petersburg. On July 30 Sir George Buchanan telegraphed:         M. Sazonof told us that absolute proof was in possession of the       Russian Government that Germany was making military and naval       preparations against Russia, more particularly in the direction of       the Gulf of Finland,--(British \"White Paper\" No. 97.)    Proofs Lacking.    On the other hand, Buchanan's telegram of July 31 (British \"White  Paper\" No. 113) states:         Russia has also reason to believe that Germany is making active       military preparations, and she cannot afford to let her get a       start.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 113.)    So, from one day to the next the \"absolute proof\" changed to a reason  for the assumption. In reality, both were assertions that lack all  proof.    The finishing part of a telegram sent by the British Ambassador in  Berlin to Sir Edward Grey on July 31 deserves special mention:         He [the German Secretary of State] again assured me that both the       Emperor William, at the request of the Emperor of Russia and the       German Foreign Office, had even up till last night been urging       Austria to show willingness to continue discussion--and telephonic       communications from Vienna had been of a promising nature--but       Russia's mobilization had spoiled everything.--(British \"White       Paper\" No. 121.)    Therefore, the German Chancellor, in his memorandum placed before the  Reichstag, stated with full justification:         The Russian Government has smashed the laborious attempts at       mediation on the part of the European State Chancelleries, on the       eve of success, by the mobilization, endangering the safety of the       empire. The measures for a mobilization, about whose seriousness       the Russian Government was fully acquainted from the beginning, in       connection with their constant denial, show clearly that Russia       wanted war.         To this is to be added that the English Government also was made       fully cognizant of the intentions of the Russian mobilization, by a       witness that could not be suspected, namely, its own representative       in St. Petersburg, and therefore must bear full responsibility.             *       *       *       *       *          II.    GREY'S OMISSIONS AND ERRORS.      We have seen from the \"Blue Book\" that the Secretary of State in London  was informed at the very latest on July 24 by his Ambassador in St.  Petersburg of the plan of the Russian mobilization and consequently of  the tremendous seriousness of the European situation. Yet eight to nine  days had to elapse before the beginning of the war. Let us see whether  Sir Edward Grey used this time to preserve peace, according to his  own documents.    From this testimony it appears that even at the beginning of the last  and decisive part of the European crisis, which began on June 28, 1914,  with the assassination of the Austrian heir to the throne, Sir Edward  Grey refrained from considering a direct participation of his country in  the possible world war. At least, this must be the impression gained  from his remarks to the representatives of the two powers with whom  England is today at war. Thus, he said to the Austro-Hungarian  Ambassador, Count Mensdorff, on July 23:         The possible consequences of the present situation were terrible.       If as many as four great powers of Europe--let us say Austria,       France, Russia, and Germany--were engaged in war, it seemed to me       that it must involve the expenditure of so vast a sum of money and       such an interference with trade that a war would be accompanied or       followed by a complete collapse of European credit and       industry.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 3.)    Here Grey speaks only of four of the big powers at most that may go to  war, without even hinting at the fifth, namely, England. On July 24 he  had another conversation with the Austrian Ambassador, the theme of  which was the note--meanwhile presented to Servia. It caused  apprehensions on his part, but he declared again:         The merits of the dispute between Austria and Servia were not the       concern of his Majesty's Government....         I [Grey] ended by saying that doubtless we should enter into an       exchange of views with other powers, and that I must await their       views as to what could be done to mitigate the difficulties of the       situation.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 5.)    We are already striking the fateful peculiarity of Grey's policy to  hesitate where prompt action, or at least a clear and open conduct,  would have been his duty. This weakness of his nature has been used with  great art by French and Russian diplomacy. This is illustrated by the  conversation of July 24 between him and the French Ambassador, Cambon,  in London:         M. Cambon said that, if there was a chance of mediation by the four       powers he had no doubt that his Government would be glad to join       in it; but he pointed out that we could not say anything in St.       Petersburg till Russia had expressed some opinion or taken some       action. But, when two days were over, Austria would march into       Servia, for the Servians could not possibly accept the Austrian       demand. Russia would be compelled by her public opinion to take       action as soon as Austria attacked Servia, and, therefore, once the       Austrians had attacked Servia it would be too late for any       mediation.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 10.)    Thus, England must not give any advice to Russia before it knows  Russia's intent and even its measures. But inasmuch as Austria will have  proceeded against Servia by that time Russia must make war, and the  conclusion is that even on July 24 the catastrophe is considered  unavoidable. Grey shows himself more and more hypnotized by the  fatalistic view that it is too late. Hence he reports also on July 24 a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16350"],[0,"Curiosities of Literature,  Vol. 2 (#11)"],[1,"to that \"obliquity of  distorted wit,\" of Barton Holyday, who has composed a strange comedy, in  five acts, performed at Christ Church, Oxford, 1630, _not_ for the  _entertainment_, as an anecdote records, of James the First?    The title of the comedy of this unclassical classic, for Holyday is  known as the translator of Juvenal with a very learned commentary, is  TEXNOTAMIA, or the Marriage of the Arts, 1630, quarto; extremely dull,  excessively rare, and extraordinarily high-priced among collectors.    It may be exhibited as one of the most extravagant inventions of a  pedant. Who but a pedant could have conceived the dull fancy of forming  a comedy, of five acts, on the subject of _marrying the Arts_! They are  the dramatis personae of this piece, and the bachelor of arts describes  their intrigues and characters. His actors are Polites, a  magistrate;--Physica;--Astronomia, daughter to Physica;--Ethicus, an old  man;--Geographus, a traveller and courtier, in love with  Astronomia;--Arithmetica, in love with  Geometres;--Logicus;--Grammaticus, a schoolmaster;--Poeta;--Historia, in  love with Poeta;--Rhetorica, in love with Logicus;--Melancholico,  Poeta's man;--Phantastes, servant to Geographus;--Choler, Grammaticus's  man.    All these refined and abstract ladies and gentlemen have as bodily  feelings, and employ as gross language, as if they had been every-day  characters. A specimen of his grotesque dulness may entertain:--        Fruits of dull heat, and sooterkins of wit.    Geographus opens the play with declaring his passion to Astronomia, and  that very rudely indeed! See the pedant wreathing the roses of Love!    \"_Geog._ Come, now you shall, Astronomia.    _Ast._ What shall I, Geographus?    _Geog._ Kisse!    _Ast._ What, in spite of my teeth!    _Geog._ No, not so! I hope you do not use to kisse with your teeth.    _Ast._ Marry, and I hope I do not use to kisse without them.    _Geog._ Ay, but my fine wit-catcher, I mean you do not show your teeth  when you kisse.\"    He then kisses her, as he says, in the different manners of a French,  Spanish and Dutch kiss. He wants to take off the zone of Astronomia. She  begs he would not fondle her like an elephant as he is; and Geographus  says again, \"Won't you then?\"    _Ast._ Won't I what?    _Geo._ Be kinde?    _Ast._ Be kinde! How?\"    Fortunately Geographus is here interrupted by Astronomia's mother  Physica. This dialogue is a specimen of the whole piece: very flat, and  very gross. Yet the piece is still curious,--not only for its absurdity,  but for that sort of ingenuity, which so whimsically contrived to bring  together the different arts; this pedantic writer, however, owes more to  the subject, than the subject derived from him; without wit or humour,  he has at times an extravagance of invention. As for  instance,--Geographus and his man Phantastes describe to Poeta the lying  wonders they pretend to have witnessed; and this is one:--    \"_Phan._ Sir, we met with a traveller that could speak six languages at  the same instant.    _Poeta_. How? at the same instant, that's impossible!    _Phan._ Nay, sir, the actuality of the performance puts it beyond all  contradiction. With his tongue he'd so vowel you out as smooth _Italian_  as any man breathing; with his eye he would sparkle forth the proud  _Spanish_; with his nose blow out most robustious _Dutch_; the creaking  of his high-heeled shoe would articulate exact _Polonian_; the knocking  of his shinbone feminine _French_; and his belly would grumble most pure  and scholar-like _Hungary_.\"    This, though extravagant without fancy, is not the worst part of the  absurd humour which runs through this pedantic comedy.    The classical reader may perhaps be amused by the following strange  conceits. Poeta, who was in love with Historia, capriciously falls in  love with Astronomia, and thus compares his mistress:--        Her _brow_ is like a brave _heroic_ line      That does a sacred majestie inshrine;      Her _nose, Phaleuciake_-like, in comely sort,      Ends in a _Trochie_, or a long and short.      Her _mouth_ is like a pretty _Dimeter_;      Her _eie-brows_ like a little-longer _Trimeter_.      Her _chinne_ is an _adonicke_, and her _tongue_      Is an _Hypermeter_, somewhat too long.      Her _eies_ I may compare them unto two      Quick-turning _dactyles_, for their nimble view.      Her _ribs_ like staues of _Sapphicks_ doe descend      Thither, which but to name were to offend.      Her _arms_ like two _Iambics_ raised on hie,      Doe with her brow bear equal majestie;      Her _legs_ like two straight _spondees_ keep apace      Slow as two _scazons_, but with stately grace.    The piece concludes with a speech by Polites, who settles all the  disputes and loves of the Arts. Poeta promises for the future to attach  himself to Historia. Rhetorica, though she loves Logicus, yet as they do  not mutually agree, she is united to Grammaticus. Polites counsels  Phlegmatico, who is Logicus's man, to leave off smoking, and to learn  better manners; and Choler, Grammaticus's man, to bridle himself;--that  Ethicus and Oeconoma would vouchsafe to give good advice to Poeta and  Historia;--and Physica to her children Geographus and Astronomia! for  Grammaticus and Rhetorica, he says, their tongues will always agree, and  will not fall out; and for Geometres and Arithmetica, they will be very  regular. Melancholico, who is Poeta's man, is left quite alone, and  agrees to be married to Musica: and at length Phantastes, by the  entreaty of Poeta, becomes the servant of Melancholico, and Musica.  Physiognomus and Cheiromantes, who are in the character of gipsies and  fortune-tellers, are finally exiled from the island of Fortunata, where  lies the whole scene of the action in the residence of the _Married  Arts_.    The pedant-comic-writer has even attended to the dresses of his  characters, which are minutely given. Thus Melancholico wears a black  suit, a black hat, a black cloak, and black worked band, black gloves,  and black shoes. Sanguis, the servant of Medicus, is in a red suit; on  the breast is a man with his nose bleeding; on the back, one letting  blood in his arm; with a red hat and band, red stockings and red pumps.    It is recorded of this play, that the Oxford scholars resolving to give  James I. a relish of their genius, requested leave to act this notable  piece. Honest Anthony Wood tells us, that it being too grave for the  king, and too scholastic for the auditory, or, as some have said, the  actors had taken too much wine, his majesty offered several times, after  two acts, to withdraw. He was prevailed to sit it out, in mere charity  to the Oxford scholars. The following humorous epigram was produced on  the occasion:--        At _Christ-church marriage_, done before the king,      Lest that those mates should want _an offering_,      The king himself _did offer_;--What, I pray?      He _offered twice_ or _thrice_--to go away!\"          A CONTRIVANCE IN DRAMATIC DIALOGUE.      Crown, in his \"City Politiques,\" 1688, a comedy written to satirise the  Whigs of those days, was accused of having copied his character too  closely after life, and his enemies turned his comedy into a libel. He  has defended himself in his preface from this imputation. It was  particularly laid to his charge, that in the characters of Bartoline, an  old corrupt lawyer, and his wife Lucinda, a wanton country girl, he  intended to ridicule a certain Serjeant M---- and his young wife. It was  even said that the comedian mimicked the odd speech of the aforesaid  Serjeant, who, having lost all his teeth, uttered his words in a very  peculiar manner. On this, Crown tells us in his defence, that the  comedian must not be blamed for this peculiarity, as it was an  _invention_ of the author himself, who had taught it to the player. He  seems to have considered it as no ordinary invention, and was so pleased  with it that he has most painfully printed the speeches of the lawyer in  this singular gibberish; and his reasons, as well as his discovery,  appear remarkable.    He says, that \"Not any one old man more than another is mimiqued, by Mr.  Lee's way of speaking, which all comedians can witness, was my own  _invention_, and Mr. Lee was taught it by me. To prove this farther, I  have _printed_ Bartoline's part in that manner of spelling by which I  taught it Mr. Lee. They who have no teeth cannot pronounce many letters  plain, but perpetually lisp and break their words, and some words they  cannot bring out at all. As for instance _th_ is pronounced by thrusting  the tongue hard to the teeth, therefore that sound they cannot make, but  something like it. For that reason you will often find in Bartoline's  part, instead of _th_, _ya_, as _yat_ for that; _yish_ for this; _yosh_  for those; sometimes a _t_ is left out, as _housand_ for thousand;  _hirty_ for thirty. _S_ they pronounce like _sh_, as _sher_ for sir;  _musht_ for must; _t_ they speak like _ch_,--therefore you will find  _chrue_ for true; _chreason_ for treason; _cho_ for to; _choo_ for two;  _chen_ for ten; _chake_ for take. And this _ch_ is not to be pronounced  like _k_, as 'tis in Christian, but as in child, church, chest. I desire  the reader to observe these things, because otherwise he will hardly  understand much of the lawyer's part, which in the opinion of all is the  most divertising in the comedy; but when this ridiculous way of speaking  is familiar with him, it will render the part more pleasant.\"    One hardly expects so curious a piece of orthoepy in the preface to a  comedy. It may have required great observation and ingenuity to have  discovered the cause of old toothless men mumbling their words. But as a  piece of comic humour, on which the author appears to have prided  himself, the effect is far from fortunate. Humour arising from a  personal defect is but a miserable substitute for that of a more genuine  kind. I shall"]]]
