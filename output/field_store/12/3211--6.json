Next morning scald 1-1/2 pounds salt  pork, scrape it well, rinse, and with 1 teaspoonful of dried onion or  half of a fresh one, put on to boil with the beans in cold water. Cook  slowly for several hours. When the water boils low, add more boiling  water and boil until the beans are soft.    To make soup, dip out a heaping cupful of the boiled beans, mash them to  a paste, then pour the liquid from the boiled beans over the paste and  stir until well mixed; if too thin add more beans; if too thick add hot  water until of the right consistency, place the soup over the fire to  reheat, and serve very hot. To bake beans, remove the pork from the  drained, partially cooked beans, score it across the top and replace it  in the pot in midst of and extending a trifle above the surface of the  beans, add 1 cup of hot water and securely cover the top of the pot with  a lid or some substitute. Sink the pot well into the glowing coals and  shovel hot coals over all. Add more hot water from time to time if  necessary.    Beans cooked in a bean hole rival those baked in other ways. Dig the  hole about 1-1/2 feet deep and wide, build a fire in it, and keep it  burning briskly for hours; the oven hole must be _hot_. When the beans  are ready, rake the fire out of the hole; then sink the pot down into  the hole and cover well with hot coals and ashes, placing them all over  the sides and top of the pot. Over these shovel a thick layer of earth,  protecting the top with grass sod or thick blanket of leaves and bark,  that rain may not penetrate to the oven. Let the beans bake all night.      =Bacon=    Sliced bacon freshly cut is best; do not bring it to camp in jars or  cans, but cut it as needed. Each girl may have the fun of cooking her  own bacon.    Cut long, slender sticks with pronged ends, sharpen the prongs and they  will hold the bacon; or use sticks with split ends and wedge in the  bacon between the two sides of the split, then toast it over the fire.  Other small pieces of meat can be cooked in the same way. Bacon boiled  with greens gives the vegetable a fine flavor, as it also does  string-beans when cooked with them. It may, however, be boiled alone for  dinner, and is good fried for breakfast.      =Game Birds=    Game birds can be baked in the embers. Have ready a bed of red-hot coals  covered with a thin layer of ashes, and after drawing the bird, dip it  in water to wet the feathers; then place it on the ash-covered red  coals, cover the bird with more ashes, and heap on quantities of red  coals. If the bird is small it should be baked in about one-half hour.  When done strip off the skin, carrying feathers with it, and the bird  will be clean and appetizing. Birds can also be roasted in the bean-pot  hole, but in this way, they must first be picked, drawn, and rinsed  clean; then cut into good-sized pieces and placed in the pot with fat  pork, size of an egg, for seasoning; after pouring in enough water to  cover the meat, fasten the pot lid on securely and bury the pot in the  glowing hot hole under a heap of red-hot coals. Cover with earth, the  same as when baking beans.      =Fish=    Fish cooked in the embers is very good, and you need not first remove  scales or fins, but clean the fish, season it with salt and pepper, wrap  it in fresh, wet, green leaves or wet blank paper, not printed paper,  and bury in the coals the same as a bird. When done the skin, scales,  and fins can all be pulled off together, leaving the delicious hot fish  ready to serve.    To boil a fish: First scale and clean it; then cut off head and tail.  If you have a piece of new cheesecloth to wrap the fish in, it can be  stuffed with dressing made of dry crumbs of bread or biscuits well  seasoned with butter, or bits of pork, pepper, and a very small piece of  onion. The cloth covering must be wrapped around and tied with white  string. When the fish is ready, put it into boiling water to which has  been added 1 tablespoonful of vinegar and a little salt. The vinegar  tends to keep the meat firm, and the dressing makes the fish more of a  dinner dish; both, however, can be omitted. Allow about twenty minutes  for boiling a three-pound fish.    The sooner a fish is cooked after being caught the better. To scale a  fish, lay it on a flat stone or log, hold it by the head and with a  knife scrape off the scales. Scale each side and, with a quick stroke,  cut off the head and lower fins. The back fin must have incisions on  each side in order to remove it. Trout are merely scraped and cleaned by  drawing out the inside with head and gills. Do this by forcing your hand  in and grasping tight hold of the gullet.    To clean most fish it is necessary to slit open the under side, take out  the inside, wash the fish, and wipe it dry with a clean cloth.    If the camping party is fond of fish, and fish frequently forms part of  a meal, have a special clean cloth to use exclusively for drying the  fish.                _Provisions for One Person for Two Weeks.

Make sure after each meal that all kitchen refuse is collected and  deposited in the big garbage hole, previously dug for that purpose, and  well covered with a layer of fresh earth.    [Illustration: 27    ANOTHER WAY OF HANGING THE CRANE OUT OF DOORS    28 29    Camp fires and camp sanitation.]    _Impress upon your mind that fresh earth is a disinfectant and keeps  down all odors._    Erect a framework with partially open side entrance for a retiring-room.  Use six strong forked-topped poles planted in an irregular square as  uprights (Fig. 28), and across these lay slender poles, fitting the ends  well into the forked tops of the uprights (Fig. 28). Half-way down from  the top, place more cross poles, resting them on the crotches left on  the uprights. Have these last cross poles as nearly the same distance  from the ground as possible and over them hang thick branches, hooking  the branches on by the stubs on their heavy ends. Also hang thickly  foliaged branches on the top cross poles, using the stubs where smaller  branches have been lopped off as hooks, as on the lower row (Fig. 29);  then peg down the bottom ends of the hanging branches to the ground with  sharpened two-pronged crotches cut from branches. The upper row of  branches should overlap the under row one foot or more. Make the seat by  driving three stout stakes firmly into the ground; two at the back, one  in front, and on these nail three crosspieces.    Never throw dish water or any refuse near your tent or on the camp  grounds.    _Burn_ or _bury_ all trash, remembering that earth and fire are your  good servants, and with their assistance you can have perfect camp  cleanliness, which will go a long way toward keeping away a variety of  troublesome flies and make camp attractive and wholesome.      =Camp Spirit=    Thoughtfulness for others; kindliness; the willingness to do your share  of the work, and more, too; the habit of making light of all  discomforts; cheerfulness under all circumstances; and the determination  never to sulk, imagine you are slighted, or find fault with people,  conditions, or things. To radiate good-will, take things as they come  and _enjoy them_, and to do your full share of entertainment and  fun-making--this is the true camp spirit.

He has property of  his own, however; receives presents at his installation; and can always  raise a sum by making a razzia on any neighbouring freebooters.    It is a fundamental law in Aheer, that the Sultan of Aghadez shall  belong to a particular family, which is said to derive its origin from  Constantinople. Therefore when, in consequence of some discontent,  Abd-el-Kader was deposed last year, the malcontents chose a relative,  Hamed-el-Argau; but he also displeasing, a rival was set up in Makita,  also of the same family. This caused great confusion, and the Walad  Suleiman took the opportunity to make forays against Aheer. The prudent  then resolved to restore the old Sultan, and succeeded, as I have  already said, in their endeavours. When Dr. Barth arrived in Aghadez,  the investiture was about to take place. The Sultan is chosen by the  Kilgris and Iteesan tribes, who nourish a deadly hatred against their  kindred, the Kailouees. On the present occasion, however, a marabout  proclaimed peace and good-will between these ancient enemies. It was  necessary, indeed, that some understanding should be come to, as after  the election the ratification of En-Noor and Lousou is required.  En-Noor, especially, is greatly respected by the people of Aghadez, as  the grand supporter of authority in Asben. The new Sultan is usually  brought from Sakkatou in state by the tribes Iteesan and Kilgris. A vast  crowd of them, with their families and flocks, had marched up and  occupied a camp near the town; but they departed on the same day that  Dr. Barth arrived--even before he entered.    Early in the morning, Dr. Barth paid his respects to the Sultan. He was  a stout man, about fifty-five years of age--benevolent-looking, as far  as could be judged in spite of his face-wrappers. He sat in a large  room, supported by two massive columns, and received his visitors  kindly. The presents pleased him, and were acknowledged by the  counter-present of a fat ram, and by meals sent every day.    The ceremony of investiture took place on the 16th of October, and seems  to have been an imposing spectacle. Certain intricate forms are used to  express the combination of various Tuarick tribes in choosing this  foreign sultan. Succeeding it was the great festival, on which a  procession took place, in which the new chief, wearing the burnouse  which I had sent him, took part, with a great number of Tuaricks in  their best array. Immediately afterwards a razzia (of which both we and  Dr. Barth heard various conflicting reports) was agreed upon against the  tribes of the north, especially those who had molested our  expedition--the Fadeea. It was highly successful, and may perhaps be  useful in procuring respect for future travellers. Two thousand men went  out upon this foray, in which Abd-el-Kader was accompanied by  Astakeelee, the Sultan of the Kailouees. Some, indeed, say that the  latter only acted. Very little resistance was made, and I hear of only  one man being killed. The fellow who stole Barth's maharee was compelled  to restore him. Dr. Barth, however, though well-pleased on the whole  with his reception, did not venture to present the treaty. He obtained  some letters of recommendation to Soudan. Many of the distinguished  persons of Aghadez visited Dr. Barth during his stay, and altogether his  reception was satisfactory.    I have already mentioned that the Sultan of Aghadez, though elected and  controlled by a kind of aristocracy of sheikhs of various tribes, is  invested with the power of life and death. He is said to have a  frightful dungeon, into which guilty persons are thrown upon swords  sticking upright in the ground. In his warlike expeditions he is  regarded, however, as chief of some tribes only. The Kailouees have a  sultan of their own, and encamp apart. The Sakonteroua, or Sheikh of  Aghadez, exercises considerable influence. He is obliged annually to  accompany the great salt-caravan, which sometimes numbers ten thousand  camels--Saharan statistics--to Sakkatou.    The town of Aghadez was formerly divided into a variety of quarters, the  names of which still remain, although the space they occupied--three  miles in circuit--is now principally filled with ruins. With the  exception of five or six rubbish-hills, the whole space is level. The  houses are spacious, with large rooms and court-yards. They are of mud,  whitewashed, and furnished with flat terraces. Doves, children, and  young ostriches, enliven the streets. There are some mosques, but none  of imposing architecture. One, however, has a lofty tower, almost  pyramidal in shape, supported on a basement of pillars, and rising to  the height of about ninety feet. There is a kind of ladder inside; but  Dr. Barth was not allowed to ascend, being told that the entrance was  walled up.    The land around the town is slightly undulating, and covered in the  depressions with the _Acacia Arabica_. Herbage and good water abound.  There are no orchards near, except in Wady Ameluli; but El-Hakhsas,  three hours distant, produces melons, cucumbers, and melochiyeh, and  supplies the whole town.    The women of Aghadez are reported to be free and easy in character, and  let loose tremendously as soon as the Sultan had departed on his razzia.  Dr. Barth had some difficulty in keeping them at a distance. There are  more children, however, to be observed in Aghadez than in most Aheer  towns.    This journey of Dr. Barth's has considerably extended our acquaintance,  both with the geography and the political state of Asben or Aheer. We  see now that it is strictly a portion of the Sahara, intersected with  fertile valleys, that towards the south begin to assume quite a tropical  character. The inhabitants are various in origin and in name; but it is  difficult to describe their subdivisions with any accuracy. According to  the natives, there are only two great tribes--the Kailouees, which  division includes the Kailouees proper, the Kaltadak, and the Kalfadai;  and, secondly, the Kilgris, including the Kilgris proper, the Iteesan,  and the Ashraf. But, in questions of detail, numerous other names appear  which it is difficult to arrange under any proper head. The Kailouees  are, I think, of genuine Targhee origin, although, as I have already  mentioned, with a mixture of the Soudan races. The Kaltadak and the  Kalfadai seem to be identical with the borderers who attacked us on our  first entrance into this country. The Kilgris are located southward,  beyond Aghadez, along the Sakkatou route, and even far into Soudan,  where the influence of the Targhee races seems to be rapidly on the  increase.    According to some of the Tanelkum Sheikhs, the following are the names  of the principal Targhee tribes scattered over the desert of Sahara,  excluding the inhabitants of Aheer:--    1. Ouraghen     family of Shafou.    2. Emanghasatan   \"    of Hateetah.    3. Amana          \"    of Jabour.    These are Ghat Tuaricks--Azghers.[9]    4. Aheethanaran, the tribe of Janet.    5. Hagar (Ahagar), pure Hagars and Maghatah, who stand to them somewhat  in the relation of the Kourglouss of Algiers to the Turks. They occupy  the tract between Ghat, Tuat, and Timbuctoo.    6. Sagamaram; located on the route from Aisou to Tuat.    7. Oulimad; tribes surrounding Timbuctoo in great numbers. In  conjunction with the Berebisheers, a tribe of Arabs, they shut up the  road between Aghadez and Timbuctoo by their predatory character.    8. Tanelkum, located in Fezzan.      [9] The three tribes of Ghat are called Azgher, in        contradiction to the Hagar. A Tanelkum explained the        meaning of this last word (which I have usually written        Haghar) to mean \"wandering\" or \"wanderers.\" The word is        sometimes written Hogar.    We have been making inquiries of the Tanelkums about the population of  Ghat and its deserts. The Tanelkums say, that ten or twelve years ago  Khanouhen brought up about ten thousand maharees against the then  masters of Mourzuk, the Walad Suleiman, headed by Abd-el-Galeel. The ten  thousand maharees were the whole force and strength of the Azgher,  Khanouhen having called out every male; for every man of the Azgher is a  warrior. The Arabs, seeing the number of the Tuaricks, deemed it  expedient to make peace. From this circumstance, it would be supposed  that the Azgher may number from five to ten thousand families, nearly  all located west of the Soudan route, along the lines of the Ghadamez  and Tuat routes; where, it is said, there are fertile valleys, in which  dates and corn are cultivated. But at Ghat I could never learn anything  of these wadys. During my last visit I had no time, and the people there  had no inclination to give me information about this fertile portion of  the Azgher desert. On the former occasion, I learned from Haj Ahmed that  there was a running stream, on the banks of which corn was cultivated,  at about four days west of Ghat. This is probably the locality of Janet.  For myself, I do not believe the Azgher Tuaricks number more than two  thousand families.    Of the population of Aheer I have been able to learn nothing definite;  that is to say, nothing which I can absolutely depend upon. Some make it  reach above fifty thousand souls. There are, however, only forty towns,  exclusive of Aghadez; and about twenty places where people live in  tents. I wrote down a second list of them, with their directions, and  some guess at the number of male inhabitants. The son of the Tanelkum  Sheikh considers the Kailouee warriors to amount to about fourteen  thousand; which, indeed, will make the whole population above sixty  thousand. The accounts I have received, therefore, seem to be  sufficiently exact for general purposes.    The Tanelkum"]]]
