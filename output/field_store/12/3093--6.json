And the  Fir Tree was stuck upright in a cask that was filled with sand; but no  one could see that it was a cask, for green cloth was hung all round it,  and it stood on a large gaily-colored carpet. Oh! how the Tree quivered!  What was to happen? The servants, as well as the young ladies, decorated  it. On one branch there hung little nets cut out of colored paper, and  each net was filled with sugarplums; and among the other boughs gilded  apples and walnuts were suspended, looking as though they had grown  there, and little blue and white tapers were placed among the leaves.  Dolls that looked for all the world like men--the Tree had never beheld  such before--were seen among the foliage, and at the very top a  large star of gold tinsel was fixed. It was really splendid--beyond  description splendid.    \"This evening!\" they all said. \"How it will shine this evening!\"    \"Oh!\" thought the Tree. \"If the evening were but come! If the tapers  were but lighted! And then I wonder what will happen! Perhaps the other  trees from the forest will come to look at me! Perhaps the sparrows will  beat against the windowpanes! I wonder if I shall take root here, and  winter and summer stand covered with ornaments!\"    He knew very much about the matter--but he was so impatient that for  sheer longing he got a pain in his back, and this with trees is the same  thing as a headache with us.    The candles were now lighted--what brightness! What splendor! The  Tree trembled so in every bough that one of the tapers set fire to the  foliage. It blazed up famously.    \"Help! Help!\" cried the young ladies, and they quickly put out the fire.    Now the Tree did not even dare tremble. What a state he was in! He was  so uneasy lest he should lose something of his splendor, that he was  quite bewildered amidst the glare and brightness; when suddenly both  folding-doors opened and a troop of children rushed in as if they would  upset the Tree. The older persons followed quietly; the little ones  stood quite still. But it was only for a moment; then they shouted that  the whole place re-echoed with their rejoicing; they danced round the  Tree, and one present after the other was pulled off.    \"What are they about?\" thought the Tree. \"What is to happen now!\" And  the lights burned down to the very branches, and as they burned down  they were put out one after the other, and then the children had  permission to plunder the Tree. So they fell upon it with such violence  that all its branches cracked; if it had not been fixed firmly in the  ground, it would certainly have tumbled down.    The children danced about with their beautiful playthings; no one looked  at the Tree except the old nurse, who peeped between the branches; but  it was only to see if there was a fig or an apple left that had been  forgotten.    \"A story! A story!\" cried the children, drawing a little fat man towards  the Tree. He seated himself under it and said, \"Now we are in the shade,  and the Tree can listen too. But I shall tell only one story. Now which  will you have; that about Ivedy-Avedy, or about Humpy-Dumpy, who  tumbled downstairs, and yet after all came to the throne and married the  princess?\"    \"Ivedy-Avedy,\" cried some; \"Humpy-Dumpy,\" cried the others. There was  such a bawling and screaming--the Fir Tree alone was silent, and he  thought to himself, \"Am I not to bawl with the rest? Am I to do nothing  whatever?\" for he was one of the company, and had done what he had to  do.    And the man told about Humpy-Dumpy that tumbled down, who  notwithstanding came to the throne, and at last married the princess.  And the children clapped their hands, and cried. \"Oh, go on! Do go on!\"  They wanted to hear about Ivedy-Avedy too, but the little man only told  them about Humpy-Dumpy. The Fir Tree stood quite still and absorbed  in thought; the birds in the wood had never related the like of this.  \"Humpy-Dumpy fell downstairs, and yet he married the princess! Yes, yes!  That's the way of the world!\" thought the Fir Tree, and believed it all,  because the man who told the story was so good-looking. \"Well, well! who  knows, perhaps I may fall downstairs, too, and get a princess as wife!\"  And he looked forward with joy to the morrow, when he hoped to be decked  out again with lights, playthings, fruits, and tinsel.    \"I won't tremble to-morrow!\" thought the Fir Tree. \"I will enjoy to  the full all my splendor! To-morrow I shall hear again the story of  Humpy-Dumpy, and perhaps that of Ivedy-Avedy too.\" And the whole night  the Tree stood still and in deep thought.    In the morning the servant and the housemaid came in.    \"Now then the splendor will begin again,\" thought the Fir. But they  dragged him out of the room, and up the stairs into the loft: and here,  in a dark corner, where no daylight could enter, they left him. \"What's  the meaning of this?\" thought the Tree. \"What am I to do here? What  shall I hear now, I wonder?\" And he leaned against the wall lost in  reverie. Time enough had he too for his reflections; for days and nights  passed on, and nobody came up; and when at last somebody did come, it  was only to put some great trunks in a corner, out of the way. There  stood the Tree quite hidden; it seemed as if he had been entirely  forgotten.    \"'Tis now winter out-of-doors!\" thought the Tree. \"The earth is hard and  covered with snow; men cannot plant me now, and therefore I have been  put up here under shelter till the spring-time comes! How thoughtful  that is! How kind man is, after all! If it only were not so dark here,  and so terribly lonely! Not even a hare! And out in the woods it was  so pleasant, when the snow was on the ground, and the hare leaped by;  yes--even when he jumped over me; but I did not like it then! It is  really terribly lonely here!\"    \"Squeak! Squeak!\" said a little Mouse, at the same moment, peeping out  of his hole. And then another little one came. They snuffed about the  Fir Tree, and rustled among the branches.    \"It is dreadfully cold,\" said the Mouse. \"But for that, it would be  delightful here, old Fir, wouldn't it?\"    \"I am by no means old,\" said the Fir Tree. \"There's many a one  considerably older than I am.\"    \"Where do you come from,\" asked the Mice; \"and what can you do?\" They  were so extremely curious. \"Tell us about the most beautiful spot on the  earth. Have you never been there? Were you never in the larder, where  cheeses lie on the shelves, and hams hang from above; where one dances  about on tallow candles: that place where one enters lean, and comes out  again fat and portly?\"    \"I know no such place,\" said the Tree. \"But I know the wood, where the  sun shines and where the little birds sing.\" And then he told all about  his youth; and the little Mice had never heard the like before; and they  listened and said,    \"Well, to be sure! How much you have seen! How happy you must have  been!\"    \"I!\" said the Fir Tree, thinking over what he had himself related.  \"Yes, in reality those were happy times.\" And then he told about  Christmas-eve, when he was decked out with cakes and candles.    \"Oh,\" said the little Mice, \"how fortunate you have been, old Fir Tree!\"    \"I am by no means old,\" said he. \"I came from the wood this winter; I am  in my prime, and am only rather short for my age.\"    \"What delightful stories you know,\" said the Mice: and the next night  they came with four other little Mice, who were to hear what the Tree  recounted: and the more he related, the more he remembered himself; and  it appeared as if those times had really been happy times. \"But they may  still come--they may still come! Humpy-Dumpy fell downstairs, and yet  he got a princess!\" and he thought at the moment of a nice little Birch  Tree growing out in the woods: to the Fir, that would be a real charming  princess.    \"Who is Humpy-Dumpy?\" asked the Mice. So then the Fir Tree told the  whole fairy tale, for he could remember every single word of it; and the  little Mice jumped for joy up to the very top of the Tree. Next night  two more Mice came, and on Sunday two Rats even; but they said the  stories were not interesting, which vexed the little Mice; and they,  too, now began to think them not so very amusing either.    \"Do you know only one story?\" asked the Rats.    \"Only that one,\" answered the Tree. \"I heard it on my happiest evening;  but I did not then know how happy I was.\"    \"It is a very stupid story! Don't you know one about bacon and tallow  candles? Can't you tell any larder stories?\"    \"No,\" said the Tree.    \"Then good-bye,\" said the Rats; and they went home.    At last the little Mice stayed away also; and the Tree sighed: \"After  all, it was very pleasant when the sleek little Mice sat round me, and  listened to what I told them. Now that too is over. But I will take good  care to enjoy myself when I am brought out again.\"    But when was that to be? Why, one morning there came a quantity of  people and set to work in the loft. The trunks were moved, the tree was  pulled out and thrown--rather hard, it is true--down on the floor, but a  man drew him towards the stairs, where the daylight shone.    \"Now a merry life will begin again,\" thought the Tree. He felt the fresh  air, the first sunbeam--and now he was out in the courtyard. All passed  so quickly, there was so much going on around him, the Tree quite forgot  to look to himself. The court adjoined a garden, and all was in flower;  the roses hung so fresh and odorous over the balustrade, the lindens  were in blossom, the Swallows flew by, and said, \"Quirre-vit! My husband  is come!\" but it was not the Fir Tree that they meant.    \"Now, then, I shall really enjoy life,\" said he exultingly, and spread  out his branches; but, alas, they were all withered and yellow! It was  in a corner that he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16042"],[0,"The Wonder Book of Bible Stories (#11)"],[1,"ay; in its  place an altar of the Lord, and on it the pieces of the Asherah were  burning as wood under a sacrifice to the Lord. The people looked at the  broken and burning idols; and they said: \"Who has done this?\"    Some one said: \"Gideon, the son of Joash, did this last night.\"    Then they came to Joash, Gideon's father, and said:    \"We are going to kill your son because he has destroyed the image of  Baal, who is our god.\"    And Joash, Gideon's father, said: \"If Baal is a god, he can take care of  himself, and punish the man who has destroyed his image. Why should you  help Baal? Let Baal help himself.\"    And when they saw that Baal could not harm the man who had broken down  his altar and his image, the people turned from Baal, back to their own  Lord God.    Gideon sent messengers through all Manasseh on the west of Jordan, and  the tribes near on the north; and the men of the tribes gathered around  him, with a few swords and spears, but very few, for the Israelites were  not ready for war. They met beside a great spring on Mount Gilboa,  called \"the fountain of Harod.\" Mount Gilboa is one of the three  mountains on the east of the plain of Esdraelon, or the plain of  Jezreel, where once there had been a great battle. On the plain,  stretching up the side of another of these mountains, called \"the Hill  of Moreh,\" was the camp of a vast Midianite army. For as soon as the  Midianites heard that Gideon had undertaken to set his people free, they  came against him with a mighty host.    Gideon was a man of faith. He wished to be sure that God was leading  him, and he prayed to God and said:    \"O Lord God, give me some sign that thou wilt save Israel through me.  Here is a fleece of wool on this threshing floor. If to-morrow morning  the fleece is wet with dew, while the grass around it is dry, then I  shall know that thou art with me; and that thou wilt give me victory  over the Midianites.\"    Very early the next morning, Gideon came to look at the fleece. He found  it wringing wet with dew, while all around the grass was dry. But Gideon  was not yet satisfied. He said to the Lord:    \"O Lord, be not angry with me; but give me just one more sign. To-morrow  morning let the fleece be dry, and let the dew fall all around it, and  then I will doubt no more.\"    The next morning, Gideon found the grass, and the bushes wet with dew,  while the fleece of wool was dry. And Gideon was now sure that God had  called him, and that God would give him victory over the enemies of  Israel.    The Lord said to Gideon: \"Your army is too large. If Israel should win  the victory, they would say, 'we won it by our own might.' Send home all  those who are afraid to fight.\"    For many of the people were frightened, as they looked at the host of  their enemies, and the Lord knew that these men would only hinder the  rest in the battle. So Gideon sent word through the camp:    \"Whoever is afraid of the enemy may go home.\" And twenty-two thousand  people went away, leaving only ten thousand in Gideon's army. But the  army was stronger though it was smaller, for the cowards had gone, and  only the brave men were left.    But the Lord said to Gideon: \"The people are yet too many. You need only  a few of the bravest and best men to fight in this battle. Bring the men  down the mountain, past the water, and I will show you there how to find  the men whom you need.\"    In the morning Gideon, by God's command called his ten thousand men out,  and made them march down the hill, just as though they were going to  attack the enemy. And as they were beside the water, he noticed how they  drank, and set them apart in two companies, according to their way of  drinking.    When they came to the water, most of the men threw aside their shields  and spears, and knelt down and scooped up a draft of the water with both  hands together like a cup. These men Gideon commanded to stand in one  company.    There were a few men who did not stop to take a large draft of water.  Holding spear and shield in the right hand, to be ready for the enemy if  one should suddenly appear, they merely caught up a handful of the water  in passing and marched on, lapping up the water from one hand. God said  to Gideon:    \"Set by themselves these men who lapped up each a handful of water.  These are the men whom I have chosen to set Israel free.\"    Gideon counted these men, and found that there were only three hundred  of them, while all the rest bowed down on their faces to drink. The  difference between them was that the three hundred were earnest men, of  one purpose; not turning aside from their aim even to drink, as the  others did. Then, too, they were watchful men, always ready to meet  their enemies.    So Gideon, at God's command, sent back to the camp on Mount Gilboa all  the rest of his army, nearly ten thousand men, keeping with himself only  his little band of three hundred.    Gideon's plan did not need a large army; but it needed a few careful,  bold men, who should do exactly as their leader commanded them. He gave  to each man a lamp, a pitcher, and a trumpet, and told the men just what  was to be done with them. The lamp was lighted, but was placed inside  the pitcher, so that it could not be seen. He divided his men into three  companies, and very quietly led them down the mountain in the middle of  the night, and arranged them all in order around the camp of the  Midianites.    [Illustration: _The men blew their trumpets with a mighty noise_]    Then at one moment a great shout rang out in the darkness, \"The sword of  the Lord and of Gideon,\" and after it came a crash of breaking pitchers,  and then a flash of light in every direction. The three hundred men had  given the shout, and broken their pitchers, so that on every side  lights were shining. The men blew their trumpets with a mighty noise;  and the Midianites were roused from sleep, to see enemies all round  them, lights beaming and swords flashing, while everywhere the sharp  sound of the trumpets was heard.    They were filled with sudden terror, and thought only of escape, not of  fighting. But wherever they turned, their enemies seemed to be standing  with swords drawn. They trampled each other down to death, flying from  the Israelites. Their own land was in the east, across the river Jordan,  and they fled in that direction, down one of the valleys between the  mountains.    Gideon had thought that the Midianites would turn toward their own land,  if they should be beaten in the battle, and he had already planned to  cut off their flight. The ten thousand men in the camp he had placed on  the sides of the valley leading to the Jordan. There they slew very many  of the Midianites as they fled down the steep pass toward the river. And  Gideon had also sent to the men of the tribe of Ephraim, who had thus  far taken no part in the war, to hold the only place at the river where  men could wade through the water. Those of the Midianites who had  escaped from Gideon's men on either side of the valley were now met by  the Ephraimites at the river, and many more of them were slain. Among  the slain were two of the princes of the Midianites, named Oreb and  Zeeb.    A part of the Midianite army was able to get across the river, and to  continue its flight toward the desert; but Gideon and his brave three  hundred men followed closely after them, fought another battle with  them, destroyed them utterly, and took their two kings, Zebah and  Zalmunna, whom he killed. After this great victory the Israelites were  freed forever from the Midianites. They never again ventured to leave  their home in the desert to make war on the tribes of Israel.    After this, as long as Gideon lived, he ruled as Judge in Israel. The  people wished him to make himself a king.    \"Rule over us as king,\" they said, \"and let your son be king after you,  and his son king after him.\"    But Gideon said:    \"No, you have a king already; for the Lord God is the King of Israel. No  one but God shall be king over these tribes.\"    Of all the fifteen men who ruled as Judges of Israel, Gideon, the fifth  Judge, was the greatest, in courage, in wisdom, and in faith in God.          THE STORY OF SAMSON, THE STRONG MAN      Now we are to learn of three judges who ruled Israel in turn. Their  names were Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon. None of these were men of war, and in  their days the land was quiet.    But the people of Israel again began to worship idols; and as a  punishment God allowed them once more to pass under the power of their  enemies. The seventh oppression, which now fell upon Israel, was by far  the hardest, the longest and the most widely spread of any, for it was  over all the tribes. It came from the Philistines, a strong and warlike  people who lived on the west of Israel upon the plain beside the Great  Sea. They worshipped an idol called Dagon, which was made in the form of  a fish's head on a man's body.    These people, the Philistines, sent their armies up from the plain  beside the sea to the mountains of Israel and overran all the land. They  took away from the Israelites all their swords and spears, so that they  could not fight; and they robbed their land of all the crops, so that  the people suffered for want of food. And as before, the Israelites in  their trouble, cried out to the Lord, and the Lord heard their prayer.    In the tribe-land of Dan, which was next to the country of the  Philistines, there was living a man named Manoah. One day an angel came  to his wife and said:    \"You shall have a son, and when he grows up he will begin to save Israel  from the hand of the Philistines. But your son must never drink any wine  or strong drink as long as he lives. And his hair must be allowed to  grow long and must never be cut, for he shall be a Nazarite under a vow  to the Lord.\"    When a child was given especially to God, or when a man gave himself to  some work for God, he was forbidden to"]]]
