The moderate gain  which those dark days of agriculture brought to the economical farmer,  was not obtained: the close, the all but niggardly care by which he  could win and keep his crown-piece,--gold was seldom in the farmer's  hand,--was either above or below the mind of the poet, and Mossgiel,  which, in the hands of an assiduous farmer, might have made a  reasonable return for labour, was unproductive, under one who had  little skill, less economy, and no taste for the task.    Other reasons for his failure have been assigned. It is to the credit  of the moral sentiments of the husbandmen of Scotland, that when one  of their class forgets what virtue requires, and dishonours, without  reparation, even the humblest of the maidens, he is not allowed to go  unpunished. No proceedings take place, perhaps one hard word is not  spoken; but he is regarded with loathing by the old and the devout; he  is looked on by all with cold and reproachful eyes--sorrow is foretold  as his lot, sure disaster as his fortune; and is these chance to  arrive, the only sympathy expressed is, \"What better could he expect?\"  Something of this sort befel Burns: he had already satisfied the kirk  in the matter of \"Sonsie, smirking, dear-bought Bess,\" his daughter,  by one of his mother's maids; and now, to use his own words, he was  brought within point-blank of the heaviest metal of the kirk by a  similar folly. The fair transgressor, both for her fathers and her own  youth, had a large share of public sympathy. Jean Armour, for it is of  her I speak, was in her eighteenth year; with dark eyes, a handsome  foot, and a melodious tongue, she made her way to the poet's  heart--and, as their stations in life were equal, it seemed that they  had only to be satisfied themselves to render their union easy. But  her father, in addition to being a very devout man, was a zealot of  the Old Light; and Jean, dreading his resentment, was willing, while  she loved its unforgiven satirist, to love him in secret, in the hope  that the time would come when she might safely avow it: she admitted  the poet, therefore, to her company in lonesome places, and walks  beneath the moon, where they both forgot themselves, and were at last  obliged to own a private marriage as a protection from kirk censure.  The professors of the Old Light rejoiced, since it brought a scoffing  rhymer within reach of their hand; but her father felt a twofold  sorrow, because of the shame of a favourite daughter, and for having  committed the folly with one both loose in conduct and profane of  speech. He had cause to be angry, but his anger, through his zeal,  became tyrannous: in the exercise of what he called a father's power,  he compelled his child to renounce the poet as her husband and burn  the marriage-lines; for he regarded her marriage, without the kirk's  permission, with a man so utterly cast away, as a worse crime than her  folly. So blind is anger! She could renounce neither her husband nor  his offspring in a lawful way, and in spite of the destruction of the  marriage lines, and renouncing the name of wife, she was as much Mrs.  Burns as marriage could make her. No one concerned seemed to think so.  Burns, who loved her tenderly, went all but mad when she renounced  him: he gave up his share of Mossgiel to his brother, and roamed,  moody and idle, about the land, with no better aim in life than a  situation in one of our western sugar-isles, and a vague hope of  distinction as a poet.    How the distinction which he desired as a poet was to be obtained,  was, to a poor bard in a provincial place, a sore puzzle: there were  no enterprising booksellers in the western land, and it was not to be  expected that the printers of either Kilmarnock or Paisley had money  to expend on a speculation in rhyme: it is much to the honour of his  native county that the publication which he wished for was at last  made easy. The best of his poems, in his own handwriting, had found  their way into the hands of the Ballantynes, Hamiltons, Parkers, and  Mackenzies, and were much admired. Mrs. Stewart, of Stair and Afton, a  lady of distinction and taste, had made, accidentally, the  acquaintance both of Burns and some of his songs, and was ready to  befriend him; and so favourable was the impression on all hands, that  a subscription, sufficient to defray the outlay of paper and print,  was soon filled up--one hundred copies being subscribed for by the  Parkers alone. He soon arranged materials for a volume, and put them  into the hands of a printer in Kilmarnock, the Wee Johnnie of one of  his biting epigrams. Johnnie was startled at the unceremonious freedom  of most of the pieces, and asked the poet to compose one of modest  language and moral aim, to stand at the beginning, and excuse some of  those free ones which followed: Burns, whose \"Twa Dogs\" was then  incomplete, finished the poem at a sitting, and put it in the van,  much to his printer's satisfaction. If the \"Jolly Beggars\" was omitted  for any other cause than its freedom of sentiment and language, or  \"Death and Doctor Hornbook\" from any other feeling than that of being  too personal, the causes of their exclusion have remained a secret. It  is less easy to account for the emission of many songs of high merit  which he had among his papers: perhaps he thought those which he  selected were sufficient to test the taste of the public. Before he  printed the whole, he, with the consent of his brother, altered his  name from Burness to Burns, a change which, I am told, he in after  years regretted.    In the summer of the year 1786, the little volume, big with the hopes  and fortunes of the bard made its appearance: it was entitled simply,  \"Poems, chiefly in the Scottish Dialect; by Robert Burns;\" and  accompanied by a modest preface, saying, that he submitted his book to  his country with fear and with trembling, since it contained little of  the art of poesie, and at the best was but a voice given, rude, he  feared, and uncouth, to the loves, the hopes, and the fears of his own  bosom. Had a summer sun risen on a winter morning, it could not have  surprised the Lowlands of Scotland more than this Kilmarnock volume  surprised and delighted the people, one and all. The milkmaid sang his  songs, the ploughman repeated his poems; the old quoted both, and  ever the devout rejoiced that idle verse had at last mixed a tone of  morality with its mirth. The volume penetrated even into Nithsdale.  \"Keep it out of the way of your children,\" said a Cameronian divine,  when he lent it to my father, \"lest ye find them, as I found mine,  reading it on the Sabbath.\" No wonder that such a volume made its way  to the hearts of a peasantry whose taste in poetry had been the marvel  of many writers: the poems were mostly on topics with which they were  familiar: the language was that of the fireside, raised above the  vulgarities of common life, by a purifying spirit of expression and  the exalting fervour of inspiration: and there was such a brilliant  and graceful mixture of the elegant and the homely, the lofty and the  low, the familiar and the elevated--such a rapid succession of scenes  which moved to tenderness or tears; or to subdued mirth or open  laughter--unlooked for allusions to scripture, or touches of sarcasm  and scandal--of superstitions to scare, and of humour to  delight--while through the whole was diffused, as the scent of flowers  through summer air, a moral meaning--a sentimental beauty, which  sweetened and sanctified all. The poet's expectations from this little  venture were humble: he hoped as much money from it as would pay for  his passage to the West Indies, where he proposed to enter into the  service of some of the Scottish settlers, and help to manage the  double mystery of sugar-making and slavery.    The hearty applause which I have recorded came chiefly from the  husbandman, the shepherd, and the mechanic: the approbation of the  magnates of the west, though not less-warm, was longer in coming. Mrs.  Stewart of Stair, indeed, commended the poems and cheered their  author: Dugald Stewart received his visits with pleasure, and wondered  at his vigour of conversation as much as at his muse: the door of the  house of Hamilton was open to him, where the table was ever spread,  and the hand ever ready to help: while the purses of the Ballantynes  and the Parkers were always as open to him as were the doors of their  houses. Those persons must be regarded as the real patrons of the  poet: the high names of the district are not to be found among those  who helped him with purse and patronage in 1786, that year of deep  distress and high distinction. The Montgomerys came with their praise  when his fame was up; the Kennedys and the Boswells were silent: and  though the Cunninghams gave effectual aid, it was when the muse was  crying with a loud voice before him, \"Come all and see the man whom I  delight to honour.\" It would be unjust as well as ungenerous not to  mention the name of Mrs. Dunlop among the poet's best and early  patrons: the distance at which she lived from Mossgiel had kept his  name from her till his poems appeared: but his works induced her to  desire his acquaintance, and she became his warmest and surest friend.    To say the truth, Burns endeavoured in every honourable way to obtain  the notice of those who had influence in the land: he copied out the  best of his unpublished poems in a fair hand, and inserting them in  his printed volume, presented it to those who seemed slow to buy: he  rewarded the notice of this one with a song--the attentions of that  one with a sally of encomiastic verse: he left psalms of his own  composing in the manse when he feasted with a divine: he enclosed  \"Holy Willie's Prayer,\" with an injunction to be grave, to one who  loved mirth: he sent the \"Holy Fair\" to one whom he invited to drink a  gill out of a mutchkin stoup, at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18505"],[0,"A Popular Schoolgirl (#11)"],[1,"lood, to help people to  remember, and we want, in our small way, not to let the Great War be  forgotten, but to do our bit to help with the future of the race.    \"I'm not any great hand at speaking or explaining, so I want you each to  take a copy of the rules of 'The Rainbow League' and to read them  quietly over at home. Then any girl who likes to join can put her name  down. All the Sixth want to become members, and I hope lots of others  will too. That's all I have to say. I'm afraid I'm rather a bungler, but  you'll understand everything if you read the papers. I'm going to give  them out now.\"    Lispeth, very red in the face, came down from the platform, and, aided  by her fellow-prefects, began to distribute papers right and left to the  girls as they filed from the benches. Amongst the others, Ingred took  hers, and put it in her pocket. She did not care to discuss it with the  crowd, so retired to a corner of the hostel garden, and, amid a shower  of falling autumn leaves, opened the typewritten sheet, and read as  follows:         The Rainbow League         A Society for Schoolgirls who wish to help in the great work of       reconstruction after the War         WHAT THE LEAGUE HOLDS         That every soul is of infinite and equal value, because all are the       children of one Father.         That every girl must do her best to help all other girls, and to       advance the Sisterhood of Women.         That woman's greatest and strongest weapons are love and sweetness.         That by conscious radiation of unselfish love to her fellow-beings,       a girl may undoubtedly raise the moral atmosphere of the world       around her.         That every girl, however young, can help this glorious old country,       and that, joined together for good, the schoolgirls of a nation can       influence the well-being of a race.         That good can always triumph over evil, and that love and       unselfishness will wipe out many social blots, and put beauty in       their place.         As the rainbow has seven prismatic colors, these may stand for       seven talents of woman.         Violet = Virtue--the bed-rock of woman's       influence.         Indigo = Industry--which means willing service.         Blue = Beauty--in its many and varied forms.         Green = Generosity--to give of our best to       others.         Yellow = Youth--to offer our best years to God.         Orange = Order--which includes organization.         Red = Radiation--the Love Force going out to       others.         Fellowship         Every member of the League shall pledge herself to forward its       objects and to take an active part in any schemes of help that may       be instituted in connection with it.         Flower Emblem. The Iris.         Motto. \"Freely ye have received, freely give.\"    Ingred sat for a moment or two, watching the petals blow from the last  roses on the bush that hung over the worn stone wall. The old Abbey lay  on one hand, the buildings of the new school on the other. They seemed  the very personification of ancient and modern.    \"The world can't stand still,\" she thought, \"and if it's got to move on,  I suppose I'd better help to give it a shove in the right direction.\"    Walking into the hostel, she met Nora and Fil walking arm-in-arm.    \"Hullo, Ingred! Have you read the paper about the Rainbow League?\" asked  Fil eagerly. \"I think it's ripping! Nora and I are both going to join.\"    \"And so am I,\" said Ingred, as she passed by them, and went upstairs.          CHAPTER VII    Hockey      Ingred signed her name next morning as a member of the Rainbow League,  and received a neat notebook with a Japanese design of purple irises  stencilled on the cover. Though the new society was supposed to be run  entirely by the girls themselves, it was much encouraged at  head-quarters, and special allowances were made for its activities. Miss  Burd sent for a book on _Toy-making at Home_, and gave the Handicraft  classes an indulgence to concentrate for the present on the construction  of little windmills, carts, dolls' furniture, trains, jigsaw puzzles,  and other articles described in its fascinating pages. Such a number of  girls had joined the League that many willing hands were at work, and at  Christmas they hoped to have a sale of the best of the toys in aid of a  fund for War Orphans, and to send the remainder to be given away as  treats for poor children.    Lispeth was highly enthusiastic, and full of future schemes.    \"We'll do toy-making this term,\" she decreed, \"and then next term we can  think of something else. In the spring and summer we'll have a Posy  Union to send bunches of flowers to sick people. We can't do anything of  that, of course, during the winter, unless some of you like to put down  bulbs; it would be lovely to give a pot of purple crocuses to a little  crippled child! I think making the toys is just A1. I want to start a  manufactory!\"    \"Barring the glue,\" said Susie Wakefield. \"It smells simply abominable  when it boils over. Why doesn't somebody bring out a patent for  sweet-scented glue?\"    \"Sweet-scented glue! You Sybarite!\"    \"Why not? They could make it out of all those delicious gums and resins  you read about in books on the Spice Islands, instead of--by the by,  what is glue made of?\"    \"Horses' hoofs, I believe, but I fancy it's better not to ask what it's  made of. I don't think your gums and resins would do the deed so well.  We'd best stick to good old-fashioned glue.\"    \"That's just what I complained of--I _do_ stick to it, or rather it  sticks to me. I get it all over my hands, and smears down my overall.\"    \"Then you're an untidy workwoman, old sport, and I can't do anything for  you except recommend 'Gresolvent.'\"    The girls were grateful for the latitude of the Handicraft class, for  otherwise they would have had little or no time to give to the  construction of toys. The homework of the College was stiff, and  certain games were compulsory. The hockey season had begun, and fixtures  had been made with other schools in the neighborhood.    \"We must see that the old Coll. keeps up its reputation,\" said Blossom  Webster, the games captain. \"Last year, when we had Lennie Peters and  Sophy Aston, we did a thing or two, didn't we? 'What girl has done, girl  can do!' and we've just got to buck up and try.\"    \"Rather!\" agreed the team.    Among the various matches which had been arranged was one with The  Clinton High School Old Girls' Association. It was an amateur team of  enthusiasts, who, debarred from playing any longer for their school, had  established a club of their own. They had sent a challenge to Grovebury  College, and it had been accepted.    \"Saturday morning's a weird time for a match!\" said Blossom, re-reading  the letter to her chums. \"But their captain says it's the only time they  can get their field. It's used by another club in the afternoons, so  she's fixed eleven o'clock.\"    \"It suits me rather decently,\" said Janie Potter. \"I'm going out to tea  in the afternoon, so I couldn't have come if the match had been at  three. Don't stare at me like that! _No_ I'm _not_ a slacker! I must  accept invitations to tea sometimes, even if I _am_ in the team. What a  dragon you are, Blossom!\"    \"Good thing some one keeps the team up, or you'd be gadding off  tea-drinking instead of playing!\" returned Blossom grimly. \"Grovebury  expects every girl to do her duty on Saturday. It will be bad luck for  the season if we lose our first match.\"    The Clinton Old Girls' Association had its field at Denscourt, a town  ten miles away from Grovebury. It was arranged by the team, and for any  girls from the college who cared to come as spectators, to meet at the  railway station at 10:15, and travel together under the escort of Miss  Giles.    Ingred, who was a keen player, and very proud of having been placed in  the reserve, was to spend Friday night at the hostel, instead of  returning as usual to Wynch-on-the-Wold.    Nora, Verity, and Fil were also to be numbered among the spectators.    On the eventful morning, as the girls were just finishing breakfast, a  telegram arrived for Rachel Grant. She tore open the yellow envelope,  and her face fell as she read the brief message. Her mother was  seriously ill, and she must return home immediately. Mrs. Best went  upstairs at once to arrange for her hurried journey, and to help her to  pack.    Downstairs at the breakfast-table the girls discussed the bad news. They  were very sorry for Rachel, and also for themselves, for she was their  right inner.    \"It's like our luck!\" fretted Janie Potter.    \"Too disgusting for words!\" groused Doreen Hayward.    \"Poor old Rachel!\" groaned Fil.    \"What's going to be done?\" asked everybody, as they folded their  serviettes and left the table.    That question was answered by Miss Giles, who beckoned to Ingred in the  hall, and said briefly:    \"Ingred, will you fetch your hockey-stick and pads?\"    Ingred did not need telling twice. To take Rachel's place was indeed an  honor. Such a chance did not come often. With huge satisfaction she  donned her neat navy-blue skirt, edged with its orange band, and her  blouse with its orange collar and cuffs.    \"You lucker!\" sighed Nora enviously. \"I'd just jolly well give  everything I have to be in the match to-day. It's not much sport to  stand by and cheer. Oh, don't think I'm trying to get out of coming! I'm  going to look on and see that you do your duty. If you're not playing  up, I'll hiss!\"    \"I'll do my best,\" laughed Ingred, \"and if I drop down for sheer lack of  breath, I shall expect you and Verity to carry me home. There!\"    \"Right you are! It's a bargain, though you'd be a jolly heavy burden, I  can tell you.\"    The team, Miss Giles, and about twenty girls as spectators, were  punctual to their appointment, and assembled at the station just in time  for the train.
