At Beni Hasan, it is  finely clustered throughout its height. In the processional hall of  Thothmes III., at Luxor, and at Medamot, a circle of small pointed leaves  and channellings around the base lessens the effect, and reduces it to a  mere grooved and truncated cone. In the hypostyle hall of Karnak, at  Abydos, at the Ramesseum, and at Medinet Habu, various other ornaments, as  triangular leaves, hieroglyphic inscriptions, or bands of cartouches  flanked by uraei, fill the space thus unfortunately obtained. Neither is  the abacus hidden as in the campaniform capital, but stands out boldly, and  displays the cartouche of the royal founder.    [Illustration: Fig. 71.--Hathor-head capital, Ptolemaic.]      III. _Columns with Hathor-head Capitals_.--We find examples of the Hathor-  headed column dating from ancient times, as at Deir el Bahari; but this  order is best known in buildings of the Ptolemaic period, as at Contra  Latopolis, Philae, and Denderah. The shaft and the base present no special  characteristics. They resemble those of the campaniform columns. The  capital is in two divisions. Below we have a square block, bearing on each  face a woman's head in high relief and crowned with a naos. The woman has  the ears of a heifer. Her hair, confined over the brow by three vertical  bands, falls behind the ears, and hangs long on the shoulders. Each head  supports a fluted cornice, on which stands a naos framed between two  volutes, and crowned by a slender abacus (fig. 71). Thus each column has  for its capital four heads of Hathor. Seen from a distance, it at once  recalls the form of the sistrum, so frequently represented in the bas-  reliefs as held in the hands of queens and goddesses. It is in fact a  sistrum, in which the regular proportions of the parts are disregarded. The  handle is gigantic, while the upper part of the instrument is unduly  reduced. This notion so pleased the Egyptian fancy that architects did not  hesitate to combine the sistrum design with elements borrowed from other  orders. The four heads of Hathor placed above a campaniform capital,  furnished Nectenebo with a composite type for his pavilion at Philae (fig.  72). I cannot say that the compound is very satisfactory, but the column is  in reality less ugly than it appears in engravings.    [Illustration: Fig. 72.--Campaniform and Hathor-headed capital, Philae.]    [Illustration: Fig. 73.--Section of the hypostyle hall at Karnak to show  the  arrangement of the two varieties: campaniform and lotus-bud columns.]    Shafts of columns were regulated by no fixed rules of proportion or  arrangement. The architect might, if he chose, make use of equal heights  with very different diameters, and, regardless of any considerations apart  from those of general harmony, might design the various parts according to  whatever scale best suited him. The dimensions of the capital had no  invariable connection with those of the shaft, nor was the height of the  shaft dependent on the diameter of the column. At Karnak, the campaniform  columns of the hypostyle hall measure 10 feet high in the capital, and 55  feet high in the shaft, with a lower diameter of 11 feet 8 inches. At  Luxor, the capital measures 11-1/2 feet, the shaft 49 feet, and the  diameter at the spring of the base 11-1/4 feet. At the Ramesseum, the shaft  and capital measure 35 feet, and the spring diameter is 6-1/2 feet. The  lotus-bud or clustered column gives similar results. At Karnak, in the  aisles of the hypostyle hall, the capital is 10 feet high, the shaft 33  feet, and the base diameter 6-3/4 feet. At the Ramesseum, the capital is 5-  1/2 feet high, the shaft 24-1/2 feet, and the base diameter 5 feet 10  inches. We find the same irregularity as to architraves. Their height is  determined only by the taste of the architect or the necessities of the  building. So also with the spacing of columns. Not only does the inter-  columnar space vary considerably between temple and temple, or chamber and  chamber, but sometimes--as in the first court at Medinet Habu--they vary in  the same portico. We have thus far treated separately of each type; but  when various types were associated in a single building, no fixed relative  proportions were observed. In the hypostyle hall at Karnak, the campaniform  columns support the nave, while the lotus-bud variety is relegated to the  aisles (fig. 73). There are halls in the temple of Khonsu where the lotus-  bud column is the loftiest, and others where the campaniform dominates the  rest. In what remains of the Medamot structure, campaniform and lotus-bud  columns are of equal height. Egypt had no definite orders like those of  Greece, but tried every combination to which the elements of the column  could be made to lend themselves; hence, we can never determine the  dimensions of an Egyptian column from those of one of its parts.

[13] French \"Promenoir\"; this is perhaps best expressed by \"Processional      Hall,\" in accordance with the description of its purpose on p. 67.      --A.B.E.          2. THE TEMPLE.    [Illustration: Fig. 74.--Plan of temple of the Sphinx.]    Most of the famous sanctuaries--Denderah, Edfu, Abydos--were founded before  Men a by the _Servants of Hor_.[14] Becoming dilapidated or ruined in the  course of ages, they have been restored, rebuilt, remodelled, one after the  other, till nothing remains of the primitive design to show us what the  first Egyptian architecture was like. The funerary temples built by the  kings of the Fourth Dynasty have left some traces.[15] That of the second  pyramid of Gizeh was so far preserved at the beginning of the last century,  that Maillet saw four large pillars standing. It is now almost entirely  destroyed; but this loss has been more than compensated by the discovery,  in 1853, of a temple situate about fifty yards to the southward of the  sphinx (fig. 74). The facade is still hidden by the sand, and the inside is  but partly uncovered. The core masonry is of fine Turah limestone. The  casing, pillars, architraves, and roof were constructed with immense blocks  of alabaster or red granite (Note 9). The plan is most simple: In the  middle (A) is a great hall in shape of the letter T, adorned with sixteen  square pillars 16 feet in height; at the north-west corner of this hall is  a narrow passage on an inclined plane (B), by which the building is now  entered;[16] at the south-west corner is a recess (C) which contains six  niches, in pairs one over the other. A long gallery opening at each end  into a square chamber, now filled with rubbish (E), completes the plan.  Without any main door, without windows, and entered through a passage too  long to admit the light of day, the building can only have received light  and air through slanting air-slits in the roofing, of which traces are yet  visible on the tops of the walls (_e, e_) on each side of the main hall  (Note 10). Inscriptions, bas-reliefs, paintings, such as we are accustomed  to find everywhere in Egypt, are all wanting; and yet these bare walls  produce as great an impression upon the spectator as the most richly  decorated temples of Thebes. Not only grandeur but sublimity has been  achieved in the mere juxtaposition of blocks of granite and alabaster, by  means of purity of line and exactness of proportion.    Some few scattered ruins in Nubia, the Fayum, and Sinai, do not suffice to  prove whether the temples of the Twelfth Dynasty merited the praises  lavished on them in contemporary inscriptions or not. Those of the Theban  kings, of the Ptolemies, and of the Caesars which are yet standing are in  some cases nearly perfect, while almost all are easy of restoration to  those who conscientiously study them upon the spot. At first sight, they  seem to present an infinite variety as to arrangement; but on a closer view  they are found to conform to a single type. We will begin with the  sanctuary. This is a low, small, obscure, rectangular chamber, inaccessible  to all save Pharaoh and the priests. As a rule it contained neither statue  nor emblem, but only the sacred bark, or a tabernacle of painted wood  placed upon a pedestal. A niche in the wall, or an isolated shrine formed  of a single block of stone, received on certain days the statue, or  inanimate symbol of the local god, or the living animal, or the image of  the animal, sacred to that god. A temple must necessarily contain this one  chamber; and if it contained but this one chamber, it would be no less a  temple than the most complex buildings. Very rarely, however, especially in  large towns, was the service of the gods thus limited to the strictly  necessary. Around the sanctuary, or \"divine house,\" was grouped a series of  chambers in which sacrificial and ceremonial objects were stored, as  flowers, perfumes, stuffs, and precious vessels. In advance of this block  of buildings were next built one or more halls supported on columns; and in  advance of these came a courtyard, where the priests and devotees  assembled. This courtyard was surrounded by a colonnade to which the public  had access, and was entered through a gateway flanked by two towers, in  front of which were placed statues, or obelisks; the whole being surrounded  by an enclosure wall of brickwork, and approached through an avenue of  sphinxes. Every Pharaoh was free to erect a hall still more sumptuous in  front of those which his predecessors had built; and what he did, others  might do after him. Thus, successive series of chambers and courts, of  pylons and porticoes, were added reign after reign to the original nucleus;  and--vanity or piety prompting the work--the temple continued to increase  in every direction, till space or means had failed.
