[Illustration: FIG. 1.--THE ADER FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS]    The transmitters are four in number, and are actuated by the same  number of musicians, each humming into them his part of the quartet  (Fig. 1). This transmitter, represented apart in elevation and section  in Fig. 2, is identical with the one used in the curious experiment  with the singing condenser. At A is a mouthpiece before which the  musician hums his part as upon a reed pipe. He causes the plate, B, to  vibrate in unison with the sound that he emits, and this produces  periodical interruptions of varying rapidity between the disk, B, and  the point, C. The button, D, serves to regulate the distance in such a  way that the breakings of the circuit shall be very complete and  produce sounds in the receivers as pure as allowed by this special  mode of transmission, in which all the harmonics are systematically  suppressed in order to re-enforce the fundamental.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--DETAILS OF THE TRANSMITTER.]    This transmitter interrupter is interposed in the circuit of a battery  of accumulators, with the five receivers that it actuates, in such a  way that the four transmitters and five receivers form in reality four  groups of distinct autonomous transmission, the accordance of which is  absolutely dependent upon that of the artists who make them vibrate.    The five receivers are arranged over the front door of the telephone  pavilion, near the Eiffel tower (Fig. 3). Each consists of a horseshoe  magnet provided, between its branches, with two small iron cores  having a space of a few millimeters between them (Fig. 4). Each of  these soft iron cores carries a copper wire bobbin, N, the number of  spirals of which is properly calculated for the effect to be produced.  Opposite the vacant space left by the two cores, there is a small  piece, t, of rectangular form, and also of soft iron, fixed to a  vibrating strip of firwood, L, of about 4 inches section. The  periodical breaking of the circuit produced by the transmitter causes  a variation in the magnetization of the iron cores of the five  receivers and makes the firwood strips vibrate energetically. These  vibrations are received and poured forth as it were in front of the  telephone pavilion, by large brass trumpets arranged in front of each  receiver, as shown in Fig. 3.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--THE ADER FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS]    It would be difficult for us to pass any judgment whatever upon the  musical and artistic value of these transmissions of trumpet music to  a distance; we prefer to confess our incompetency in the matter. But  it is none the less certain that these experiments are having the same  success that they had at their inception in 1881 at the Universal  Exposition of Electricity, and they allow us to foresee that there is  a time coming in which it will be possible to transmit speech to a  distance with the same intensity that the present trumpet flourishes  have. Although all the tentatives hitherto made in this direction have  not given very brilliant results, we must not despair of attaining the  end some day or other. Less than fifteen years ago the telephone did  not exist; now it covers the world with its lines.--_La Nature._    [Illustration: Fig. 4.--DETAILS OF THE RECEIVER.]           *       *       *       *       *          NOTES ON DYEWOOD EXTRACTS AND SIMILAR PREPARATIONS.    By LOUIS SIEBOLD, F.I.C., F.C.S.      During the last ten years there has been an enormous increase in the  production of these preparations, and the time will come when their  application in dyeing and calico printing will become so general as to  completely supersede the employment of the raw materials. The  manufacture of these extracts, to be thoroughly successful, requires  to be so conducted as to secure the perfect exhaustion of the dyewoods  without the slightest destruction or deterioration of the coloring  matters contained in them; and though nothing like perfection has been  reached in the attainment of these objects, it is certain that the  processes of extraction and evaporation now employed by the best  makers are a very great improvement on the older methods. Indeed,  there is no difficulty nowadays in procuring dyewood extracts of high  excellence if the consumer is willing to pay a price for them  corresponding to their quality, and knows how to avail himself of the  aid of chemical skill to control his purchases. Unfortunately,  however, there is so much hankering after cheap articles, and so  little care is taken to ascertain their real quality, that every scope  is afforded to the malpractices of the adulterer. There are many dye  and print works in which large quantities of these extracts are used  without being subjected to trustworthy tests. Moreover, much of the  testing is done by fallacious methods and often by biased hands. So  fallacious, indeed, are some of these tests, that grossly adulterated  extracts are often declared superior to the purer ones, the cause of  this being the application of an insufficient proportion of mordant in  the dyeing or printing trials, and the consequent waste of the excess  of coloring matter in the case of the purer preparation.    Professional analytical chemists have hitherto given but little  attention to these preparations, and the employment of experienced  chemists in works is as yet far from general. The testing of dyewood  extracts in such a manner as to throw full light on their purity, the  quality of raw material from which they are prepared, their exact  commercial value their suitability for special purposes, and the  proportion and nature of any adulterants they may contain, is of  course a difficult and tedious task, and must be left to the expert  who is in possession of authentic specimens prepared by himself of all  the different extracts made from every variety and quality of raw  materials, and who combines a thorough knowledge of experimental  dyeing and printing with a large experience in the chemical  investigation of these preparations. But when the object of the  testing is merely careful comparison of the sample in question with an  original sample or previous deliveries, the case is much simplified,  and comes within the scope of the general chemist or the laboratory  attached to works. A few years ago I recommended carefully conducted  dyeing trials on woolen cloth mordanted with bichromate of potash as  the best and simplest mode adapted to such cases, and my subsequent  experience enables me to confirm that observation to the fullest  extent. Most of these extracts contain the coloring matter in two  states, the developed and the undeveloped, and an oxidizing mordant  such as bichromate of potash causes the latter as well as the former  to enter completely into combination with a metallic base; whereas  many of the other mordants, such as alumina or tin compounds, merely  take up the developed portion of the coloring matter together with  such small and variable proportions of the undeveloped as might  undergo oxidation during the process of dyeing. I would therefore  suggest dyeing trials with alumina, tin, iron, etc., only as  subsidiary tests indicating the suitability of an extract for certain  special purposes, while recommending the trial with bichromate of  potash as the one giving the best information respecting the actual  strength of the extract in relation to the raw material from which it  was obtained, and as giving a fair idea of the money value of the  sample. Cotton dyeing does not, as a general rule, afford a good means  of assaying extracts, as it is generally done under conditions which  do not admit of complete exhaustion of the dye bath, but it might  often with advantage be resorted to as an additional trial throwing  further light on the degree of oxidation or development of the  coloring matter. Printing trials are apt to give fallacious results  unless the proportion of mordant is carefully adjusted to the amount  of coloring matter present, and several trials with different  proportions would be necessary to prevent erroneous conclusions. For  the trials with bichromate of potash on wool I would recommend pieces  of cloth weighing about 150 grains, and the most suitable proportion  of bichromate of potash is 3 per cent. of the weight of the cloth. The  requisite number of pieces (equal to the number of samples to be  tested) should be thoroughly scoured and then heated in the bichromate  solution at or near the boiling point for not less than 11/2 hours,  after which they should be well washed and then dyed separately in the  solutions of equal weights of the extracts at the same temperature and  for the same length of time; 15 grains of extract is a suitable  quantity for a first trial under these conditions. These trials can  then be repeated with different relative proportions of extract in  order to ascertain what weight of a sample would give the same depth  of color as 15 grains of the standard example. Many precautions are  required both in the mordanting and dyeing processes in order to  obtain trustworthy results; and though the trials with bichromate of  potash give the most reliable information of any single test, they  should be supplemented by the subsidiary tests already alluded to, and  also by a chemical examination, in order to obtain a knowledge, not  merely of the wood strength, but also of the general nature of the  extract. An adulteration with molasses or glucose can be best  determined by fermentation in comparison with a pure sample. Mineral  adulterants may, of course, be detected by an estimation and analysis  of the ash, after making due allowances for variations due to  differences in different kinds of the same dyewoods. The estimation of  the individual coloring matters in these extracts by means of a  chemical analysis is under all circumstances "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16983"],[0,"The Kitáb-i-Íqán (#11)"],[1,"text is not meant that which these foolish and abject  souls have fancied, even as some maintain that Jewish and Christian  divines have effaced from the Book such verses as extol and magnify the  countenance of Muhammad, and instead thereof have inserted the contrary.  How utterly vain and false are these words! Can a man who believeth in a  book, and deemeth it to be inspired by God, mutilate it? Moreover, the  Pentateuch had been spread over the surface of the earth, and was not  confined to Mecca and Medina, so that they could privily corrupt and  pervert its text. Nay, rather, by corruption of the text is meant that in  which all Muslim divines are engaged today, that is the interpretation of  God's holy Book in accordance with their idle imaginings and vain desires.  And as the Jews, in the time of Muhammad, interpreted those verses of the  Pentateuch, that referred to His Manifestation, after their own fancy, and  refused to be satisfied with His holy utterance, the charge of  \"perverting\" the text was therefore pronounced against them. Likewise, it  is clear, how in this day, the people of the Qur'an have perverted the  text of God's holy Book, concerning the signs of the expected  Manifestation, and interpreted it according to their inclination and  desires.    In yet another instance, He saith: \"A part of them heard the Word of God,  and then, after they had understood it, distorted it, and knew that they  did so.\"(65) This verse, too, doth indicate that the meaning of the Word  of God hath been perverted, not that the actual words have been effaced.  To the truth of this testify they that are sound of mind.    Again in another instance, He saith: \"Woe unto those who, with their own  hands, transcribe the Book corruptly, and then say: 'This is from God,'  that they may sell it for some mean price.\"(66) This verse was revealed  with reference to the divines and leaders of the Jewish Faith. These  divines, in order to please the rich, acquire worldly emoluments, and give  vent to their envy and misbelief, wrote a number of treatises, refuting  the claims of Muhammad, supporting their arguments with such evidences as  it would be improper to mention, and claimed that these arguments were  derived from the text of the Pentateuch.    The same may be witnessed today. Consider how abundant are the  denunciations written by the foolish divines of this age against this most  wondrous Cause! How vain their imaginings that these calumnies are in  conformity with the verses of God's sacred Book, and in consonance with  the utterances of men of discernment!    Our purpose in relating these things is to warn you that were they to  maintain that those verses wherein the signs referred to in the Gospel are  mentioned have been perverted, were they to reject them, and cling instead  to other verses and traditions, you should know that their words were  utter falsehood and sheer calumny. Yea \"corruption\" of the text, in the  sense We have referred to, hath been actually effected in particular  instances. A few of these We have mentioned, that it may become manifest  to every discerning observer that unto a few untutored holy Men hath been  given the mastery of human learning, so that the malevolent opposer may  cease to contend that a certain verse doth indicate \"corruption\" of the  text, and insinuate that We, through lack of knowledge, have made mention  of such things. Moreover, most of the verses that indicate \"corruption\" of  the text have been revealed with reference to the Jewish people, were ye  to explore the isles of Qur'anic Revelation.    We have also heard a number of the foolish of the earth assert that the  genuine text of the heavenly Gospel doth not exist amongst the Christians,  that it hath ascended unto heaven. How grievously they have erred! How  oblivious of the fact that such a statement imputeth the gravest injustice  and tyranny to a gracious and loving Providence! How could God, when once  the Day-star of the beauty of Jesus had disappeared from the sight of His  people, and ascended unto the fourth heaven, cause His holy Book, His most  great testimony amongst His creatures, to disappear also? What would be  left to that people to cling to from the setting of the day-star of Jesus  until the rise of the sun of the Muhammadan Dispensation? What law could  be their stay and guide? How could such people be made the victims of the  avenging wrath of God, the omnipotent Avenger? How could they be afflicted  with the scourge of chastisement by the heavenly King? Above all, how  could the flow of the grace of the All-Bountiful be stayed? How could the  ocean of His tender mercies be stilled? We take refuge with God, from that  which His creatures have fancied about Him! Exalted is He above their  comprehension!    Dear friend! Now when the light of God's everlasting Morn is breaking;  when the radiance of His holy words: \"God is the light of the heavens and  of the earth\"(67) is shedding illumination upon all mankind; when the  inviolability of His tabernacle is being proclaimed by His sacred  utterance: \"God hath willed to perfect His light;\"(68) and the Hand of  omnipotence, bearing His testimony: \"In His grasp He holdeth the kingdom  of all things,\" is being outstretched unto all the peoples and kindreds of  the earth; it behooveth us to gird up the loins of endeavour, that haply,  by the grace and bounty of God, we may enter the celestial City: \"Verily,  we are God's,\" and abide within the exalted habitation: \"And unto Him we  do return.\" It is incumbent upon thee, by the permission of God, to  cleanse the eye of thine heart from the things of the world, that thou  mayest realize the infinitude of divine knowledge, and mayest behold Truth  so clearly that thou wilt need no proof to demonstrate His reality, nor  any evidence to bear witness unto His testimony.    O affectionate seeker! Shouldst thou soar in the holy realm of the spirit,  thou wouldst recognize God manifest and exalted above all things, in such  wise that thine eyes would behold none else but Him. \"God was alone; there  was none else besides Him.\" So lofty is this station that no testimony can  bear it witness, neither evidence do justice to its truth. Wert thou to  explore the sacred domain of truth, thou wilt find that all things are  known only by the light of His recognition, that He hath ever been, and  will continue for ever to be, known through Himself. And if thou dwellest  in the land of testimony, content thyself with that which He, Himself,  hath revealed: \"Is it not enough for them that We have sent down unto Thee  the Book?\"(69) This is the testimony which He, Himself, hath ordained;  greater proof than this there is none, nor ever will be: \"This proof is  His Word; His own Self, the testimony of His truth.\"    And now, We beseech the people of the Bayan, all the learned, the sages,  the divines, and witnesses amongst them, not to forget the wishes and  admonitions revealed in their Book. Let them, at all times, fix their gaze  upon the essentials of His Cause, lest when He, Who is the Quintessence of  truth, the inmost Reality of all things, the Source of all light, is made  manifest, they cling unto certain passages of the Book, and inflict upon  Him that which was inflicted in the Dispensation of the Qur'an. For,  verily, powerful is He, the King of divine might, to extinguish with one  letter of His wondrous words, the breath of life in the whole of the Bayan  and the people thereof, and with one letter bestow upon them a new and  everlasting life, and cause them to arise and speed out of the sepulchres  of their vain and selfish desires. Take heed, and be watchful; and  remember that all things have their consummation in belief in Him, in  attainment unto His day, and in the realization of His divine presence.  \"There is no piety in turning your faces toward the east or toward the  west, but he is pious who believeth in God and the Last Day.\"(70) Give  ear, O people of the Bayan, unto the truth whereunto We have admonished  you, that haply ye may seek the shelter of the shadow extended, in the Day  of God, upon all mankind.    END OF PART ONE            PART TWO          _Verily He Who is the Day-star of Truth and Revealer of the      Supreme Being holdeth, for all time, undisputed sovereignty over      all that is in heaven and on earth, though no man be found on      earth to obey Him. He verily is independent of all earthly      dominion, though He be utterly destitute. Thus We reveal unto thee      the mysteries of the Cause of God, and bestow upon thee the gems      of divine wisdom, that haply thou mayest soar on the wings of      renunciation to those heights that are veiled from the eyes of      men._      The significance and essential purpose underlying these words is to reveal  and demonstrate unto the pure in heart and the sanctified in spirit that  they Who are the Luminaries of truth and the Mirrors reflecting the light  of divine Unity, in whatever age and cycle they are sent down from their  invisible habitations of ancient glory unto this world, to educate the  souls of men and endue with grace all created things, are invariably  endowed with an all-compelling power, and invested with invincible  sovereignty. For these hidden Gems, these concealed and invisible  Treasures, in themselves manifest and vindicate the reality of these holy  words: \"Verily God doeth whatsoever He willeth, and ordaineth whatsoever  He pleaseth.\"    To every discerning and illumined heart it is evident that God, the  unknowable Essence, the divine Being, is immensely exalted beyond every  human attribute, such as corporeal existence, ascent and descent, egress  and regress. Far be it from His glory that human tongue should adequately  recount His praise, or that human heart comprehend His fathomless mystery.  He is and hath ever been veiled in the ancient eternity of His Essence,  and will remain in His Reality"]]]
