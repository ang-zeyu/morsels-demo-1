[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1726"],[0,"Theaetetus (#11)"],[1,"is obvious that this  explanation (supposing the distinction between impressions on the mind  and impressions on the senses to be admitted) does not account for all  forms of error; and Plato has excluded himself from the consideration of  the greater number, by designedly omitting the intermediate processes  of learning and forgetting; nor does he include fallacies in the use of  language or erroneous inferences. But he is struck by one possibility  of error, which is not covered by his theory, viz. errors in arithmetic.  For in numbers and calculation there is no combination of thought and  sense, and yet errors may often happen. Hence he is led to discard the  explanation which might nevertheless have been supposed to hold good  (for anything which he says to the contrary) as a rationale of error, in  the case of facts derived from sense.    Another attempt is made to explain false opinion by assigning to error  a sort of positive existence. But error or ignorance is essentially  negative--a not-knowing; if we knew an error, we should be no longer in  error. We may veil our difficulty under figures of speech, but these,  although telling arguments with the multitude, can never be the real  foundation of a system of psychology. Only they lead us to dwell upon  mental phenomena which if expressed in an abstract form would not be  realized by us at all. The figure of the mind receiving impressions is  one of those images which have rooted themselves for ever in language.  It may or may not be a 'gracious aid' to thought; but it cannot be  got rid of. The other figure of the enclosure is also remarkable as  affording the first hint of universal all-pervading ideas,--a notion  further carried out in the Sophist. This is implied in the birds, some  in flocks, some solitary, which fly about anywhere and everywhere. Plato  discards both figures, as not really solving the question which to us  appears so simple: 'How do we make mistakes?' The failure of the enquiry  seems to show that we should return to knowledge, and begin with that;  and we may afterwards proceed, with a better hope of success, to the  examination of opinion.    But is true opinion really distinct from knowledge? The difference  between these he seeks to establish by an argument, which to us appears  singular and unsatisfactory. The existence of true opinion is proved  by the rhetoric of the law courts, which cannot give knowledge, but  may give true opinion. The rhetorician cannot put the judge or juror in  possession of all the facts which prove an act of violence, but he may  truly persuade them of the commission of such an act. Here the idea of  true opinion seems to be a right conclusion from imperfect knowledge.  But the correctness of such an opinion will be purely accidental; and is  really the effect of one man, who has the means of knowing, persuading  another who has not. Plato would have done better if he had said that  true opinion was a contradiction in terms.    Assuming the distinction between knowledge and opinion, Theaetetus, in  answer to Socrates, proceeds to define knowledge as true opinion, with  definite or rational explanation. This Socrates identifies with another  and different theory, of those who assert that knowledge first begins  with a proposition.    The elements may be perceived by sense, but they are names, and cannot  be defined. When we assign to them some predicate, they first begin to  have a meaning (onomaton sumploke logou ousia). This seems equivalent  to saying, that the individuals of sense become the subject of knowledge  when they are regarded as they are in nature in relation to other  individuals.    Yet we feel a difficulty in following this new hypothesis. For must not  opinion be equally expressed in a proposition? The difference between  true and false opinion is not the difference between the particular and  the universal, but between the true universal and the false. Thought may  be as much at fault as sight. When we place individuals under a  class, or assign to them attributes, this is not knowledge, but a very  rudimentary process of thought; the first generalization of all, without  which language would be impossible. And has Plato kept altogether clear  of a confusion, which the analogous word logos tends to create, of a  proposition and a definition? And is not the confusion increased by the  use of the analogous term 'elements,' or 'letters'? For there is no real  resemblance between the relation of letters to a syllable, and of the  terms to a proposition.    Plato, in the spirit of the Megarian philosophy, soon discovers a flaw  in the explanation. For how can we know a compound of which the simple  elements are unknown to us? Can two unknowns make a known? Can a whole  be something different from the parts? The answer of experience is that  they can; for we may know a compound, which we are unable to analyze  into its elements; and all the parts, when united, may be more than all  the parts separated: e.g. the number four, or any other number, is more  than the units which are contained in it; any chemical compound is more  than and different from the simple elements. But ancient philosophy  in this, as in many other instances, proceeding by the path of mental  analysis, was perplexed by doubts which warred against the plainest  facts.    Three attempts to explain the new definition of knowledge still remain  to be considered. They all of them turn on the explanation of logos. The  first account of the meaning of the word is the reflection of thought in  speech--a sort of nominalism 'La science est une langue bien faite.' But  anybody who is not dumb can say what he thinks; therefore mere speech  cannot be knowledge. And yet we may observe, that there is in this  explanation an element of truth which is not recognized by Plato; viz.  that truth and thought are inseparable from language, although mere  expression in words is not truth. The second explanation of logos is the  enumeration of the elementary parts of the complex whole. But this is  only definition accompanied with right opinion, and does not yet attain  to the certainty of knowledge. Plato does not mention the greater  objection, which is, that the enumeration of particulars is endless;  such a definition would be based on no principle, and would not help us  at all in gaining a common idea. The third is the best explanation,--the  possession of a characteristic mark, which seems to answer to the  logical definition by genus and difference. But this, again, is equally  necessary for right opinion; and we have already determined, although  not on very satisfactory grounds, that knowledge must be distinguished  from opinion. A better distinction is drawn between them in the Timaeus.  They might be opposed as philosophy and rhetoric, and as conversant  respectively with necessary and contingent matter. But no true idea of  the nature of either of them, or of their relation to one another, could  be framed until science obtained a content. The ancient philosophers  in the age of Plato thought of science only as pure abstraction, and to  this opinion stood in no relation.    Like Theaetetus, we have attained to no definite result. But an  interesting phase of ancient philosophy has passed before us. And the  negative result is not to be despised. For on certain subjects, and in  certain states of knowledge, the work of negation or clearing the ground  must go on, perhaps for a generation, before the new structure can begin  to rise. Plato saw the necessity of combating the illogical logic of  the Megarians and Eristics. For the completion of the edifice, he makes  preparation in the Theaetetus, and crowns the work in the Sophist.    Many (1) fine expressions, and (2) remarks full of wisdom, (3) also  germs of a metaphysic of the future, are scattered up and down in  the dialogue. Such, for example, as (1) the comparison of Theaetetus'  progress in learning to the 'noiseless flow of a river of oil';  the satirical touch, 'flavouring a sauce or fawning speech'; or the  remarkable expression, 'full of impure dialectic'; or the lively images  under which the argument is described,--'the flood of arguments pouring  in,' the fresh discussions 'bursting in like a band of revellers.'  (2) As illustrations of the second head, may be cited the remark of  Socrates, that 'distinctions of words, although sometimes pedantic, are  also necessary'; or the fine touch in the character of the lawyer,  that 'dangers came upon him when the tenderness of youth was unequal to  them'; or the description of the manner in which the spirit is broken  in a wicked man who listens to reproof until he becomes like a child; or  the punishment of the wicked, which is not physical suffering, but the  perpetual companionship of evil (compare Gorgias); or the saying, often  repeated by Aristotle and others, that 'philosophy begins in wonder,  for Iris is the child of Thaumas'; or the superb contempt with which  the philosopher takes down the pride of wealthy landed proprietors by  comparison of the whole earth. (3) Important metaphysical ideas are: a.  the conception of thought, as the mind talking to herself; b. the notion  of a common sense, developed further by Aristotle, and the explicit  declaration, that the mind gains her conceptions of Being, sameness,  number, and the like, from reflection on herself; c. the excellent  distinction of Theaetetus (which Socrates, speaking with emphasis,  'leaves to grow') between seeing the forms or hearing the sounds of  words in a foreign language, and understanding the meaning of them; and  d. the distinction of Socrates himself between 'having' and 'possessing'  knowledge, in which the answer to the whole discussion appears to be  contained.    ...    There is a difference between ancient and modern psychology, and we  have a difficulty in explaining one in the terms of the other.

Oh  that the gods would clothe me with such strength as his,  that I might take vengeance on the wooers for their cruel  transgression, who wantonly devise against me infatuate  deeds! But the gods have woven for me the web of no such  weal, for me or for my sire. But now I must in any wise  endure it.'    Then Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots, made answer:  'Dear friend, seeing thou dost call these things to my  remembrance and speak thereof, they tell me that many  wooers for thy mother's hand plan mischief within the halls  in thy despite. Say, dost thou willingly submit thee to  oppression, or do the people through the land hate thee,  obedient to the voice of a god? Who knows but that Odysseus  may some day come and requite their violence, either  himself alone or all the host of the Achaeans with him? Ah,  if but grey-eyed Athene were inclined to love thee, as once  she cared exceedingly for the renowned Odysseus in the land  of the Trojans, where we Achaeans were sore afflicted, for  never yet have I seen the gods show forth such manifest  love, as then did Pallas Athene standing manifest by him,--  if she would be pleased so to love thee and to care for  thee, then might certain of them clean forget their  marriage.'    And wise Telemachus answered him, saying: 'Old man, in no  wise methinks shall this word be accomplished. This is a  hard saying of thine, awe comes over me. Not for my hopes  shall this thing come to pass, not even if the gods so  willed it.'    Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, spake to him again:  'Telemachus, what word hath escaped the door of thy lips?  Lightly might a god, if so he would, bring a man safe home  even from afar. Rather myself would I have travail and much  pain ere I came home and saw the day of my returning, than  come back and straightway perish on my own hearth-stone,  even as Agamemnon perished by guile at the hands of his own  wife and of Aegisthus. But lo you, death, which is common  to all, the very gods cannot avert even from the man they  love, when the ruinous doom shall bring him low of death  that lays men at their length.'    And wise Telemachus answered her, saying: 'Mentor, no  longer let us tell of these things, sorrowful though we be.  There is none assurance any more of his returning, but  already have the deathless gods devised for him death and  black fate. But now I would question Nestor, and ask him of  another matter, as one who above all men knows judgments  and wisdom: for thrice, men say, he hath been king through  the generations of men; yea, like an immortal he seems to  me to look upon. Nestor, son of Neleus, now tell me true:  how died the son of Atreus, Agamemnon of the wide domain?  Where was Menelaus? What death did crafty Aegisthus plan  for him, in that he killed a man more valiant far than he?  Or was Menelaus not in Argos of Achaia but wandering  elsewhere among men, and that other took heart and slew  Agamemnon?'    Then Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots, answered him:  'Yea now, my child, I will tell thee the whole truth.  Verily thou guessest aright even of thyself how things  would have fallen out, if Menelaus of the fair hair, the  son of Atreus, when he came back from Troy, had found  Aegisthus yet alive in the halls. Then even in his death  would they not have heaped the piled earth over him, but  dogs and fowls of the air would have devoured him as he lay  on the plain far from the town. {*} Nor would any of the  Achaean women have bewailed him; so dread was the deed he  contrived. Now we sat in leaguer there, achieving many  adventures; but he the while in peace in the heart of  Argos, the pastureland of horses, spake ofttimes, tempting  her, to the wife of Agamemnon. Verily at the first she  would none of the foul deed, the fair Clytemnestra, for she  had a good understanding. Moreover there was with her a  minstrel, whom the son of Atreus straitly charged as he  went to Troy to have a care of his wife. But when at last  the doom of the gods bound her to her ruin, then did  Aegisthus carry the minstrel to a lonely isle, and left him  there to be the prey and spoil of birds; while as for her,  he led her to his house, a willing lover with a willing  lady. And he burnt many thigh slices upon the holy altars  of the gods, and hung up many offerings, woven-work and  gold, seeing that he had accomplished a great deed, beyond  all hope. Now we, I say, were sailing together on our way  from Troy, the son of Atreus and I, as loving friends. But  when we had reached holy Sunium, the headland of Athens,  there Phoebus Apollo slew the pilot of Menelaus with the  visitation of his gentle shafts, as he held between his  hands the rudder of the running ship, even Phrontis, son of  Onetor, who excelled the tribes of men in piloting a ship,  whenso the storm-winds were hurrying by. Thus was Menelaus  holden there, though eager for the way, till he might bury  his friend and pay the last rites over him. But when he in  his turn, faring over the wine-dark sea in hollow ships,  reached in swift course the steep mount of Malea, then it  was that Zeus of the far-borne voice devised a hateful  path, and shed upon them the breath of the shrill winds,  and great swelling waves arose like unto mountains. There  sundered he the fleet in twain, and part thereof he brought  nigh to Crete, where the Cydonians dwelt about the streams  of Iardanus. Now there is a certain cliff, smooth and sheer  towards the sea, on the border of Gortyn, in the misty  deep, where the South-West Wind drives a great wave against  the left headland, towards Phaestus, and a little rock  keeps back the mighty water. Thither came one part of the  fleet, and the men scarce escaped destruction, but the  ships were broken by the waves against the rock; while  those other five dark-prowed ships the wind and the water  bare and brought nigh to Egypt. Thus Menelaus, gathering  much livelihood and gold, was wandering there with his  ships among men of strange speech, and even then Aegisthus  planned that pitiful work at home. And for seven years he  ruled over Mycenae, rich in gold, after he slew the son of  Atreus, and the people were subdued unto him. But in the  eighth year came upon him goodly Orestes back from Athens  to be his bane, and slew the slayer of his father, guileful  Aegisthus, who killed his famous sire. Now when he had  slain him, he made a funeral feast to the Argives over his  hateful mother, and over the craven Aegisthus. And on the  selfsame day there came to him Menelaus of the loud  war-cry, bringing much treasure, even all the freight of  his ships. So thou, my friend, wander not long far away  from home, leaving thy substance behind thee and men in thy  house so wanton, lest they divide and utterly devour all  thy wealth, and thou shalt have gone on a vain journey.  Rather I bid and command thee to go to Menelaus, for he  hath lately come from a strange country, from the land of  men whence none would hope in his heart to return, whom  once the storms have driven wandering into so wide a sea.  Thence not even the birds can make their way in the space  of one year, so great a sea it is and terrible. But go now  with thy ship and with thy company, or if thou hast a mind  to fare by land, I have a chariot and horses at thy  service, yea and my sons to do thy will, who will be thy  guides to goodly Lacedaemon, where is Menelaus of the fair  hair. Do thou thyself entreat him, that he may give thee  unerring answer. He will not lie to thee, for he is very  wise.'    {* Reading [Greek]. v. 1. '[Greek], which must be wrong.}    Thus he spake, and the sun went down and darkness came on.  Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, spake among them,  saying: 'Yea, old man, thou hast told all this thy tale  aright. But come, cut up the tongues of the victims and mix  the wine, that we may pour forth before Poseidon and the  other deathless gods, and so may bethink us of sleep, for  it is the hour for sleep. For already has the light gone  beneath the west, and it is not seemly to sit long at a  banquet of the gods, but to be going home.'    So spake the daughter of Zeus, and they hearkened to her  voice. And the henchmen poured water over their hands, and  pages crowned the mixing bowls with drink, and served out  the wine to all, after they had first poured for libation  into each cup in turn; and they cast the tongues upon the  fire, and stood up and poured the drink-offering thereon.  But when they had poured forth and had drunken to their  heart's content, Athene and godlike Telemachus were both  set on returning to the hollow ship; but Nestor would have  stayed them, and accosted them, saying: 'Zeus forfend it,  and all the other deathless gods, that ye should depart  from my house to the swift ship, as from the dwelling of  one that is utterly without raiment or a needy man, who  hath not rugs or blankets many in his house whereon to  sleep softly, he or his guests. Nay not so, I have rugs and  fair blankets by me. Never, methinks, shall the dear son of  this man, even of Odysseus, lay him down upon the ship's  deck, while as yet I am alive, and my children after me are  left in my hall to entertain strangers, whoso may chance to  come to my house.'    Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, spake to him again:  'Yea, herein hast thou spoken aright, dear father: and  Telemachus may well obey thee, for before all things this  is meet. Behold, he shall now depart with thee, that he may  sleep in thy halls; as for me I will go to the black ship,  that I may cheer my company and tell them all. For I avow  me to be the one elder among them; those others are but  younger men, who follow for love of him, all of them of  like age with the high-souled Telemachus. There will I lay  me down by"]]]
