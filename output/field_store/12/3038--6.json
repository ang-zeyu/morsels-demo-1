One day, our little Harry spent the morning with his young playmate,  Johnny Crane, who lived in a fine house, and on Sundays rode to church in  the grandest carriage to be seen in all the country round.    2. When Harry returned home, he said, \"Mother, Johnny has money in both  pockets!\"    3.  \"Has he, dear?\"    4. \"Yes, ma'am; and he says he could get ever so much more if he wanted  it.\"    5. \"Well, now, that's very pleasant for him,\" I returned, cheerfully, as a  reply was plainly expected. \"Very pleasant; don't you think so?\"    6.  \"Yes, ma'am; only--\"    7.  \"Only what, Harry?\"    8. \"Why, he has a big popgun, and a watch, and a hobbyhorse, and lots of  things.\" And Harry looked up at my face with a disconsolate stare.    9. \"Well, my boy, what of that?\"    10. \"Nothing, mother,\" and the telltale tears sprang to his eyes, \"only I  guess we are very poor, aren't we?\"    11. \"No, indeed, Harry, we are very far from being poor. We are not so  rich as Mr. Crane's family, if that is what you mean.\"    12. \"O mother!\" insisted the little fellow, \"I do think we are very poor;  anyhow, I am!\"    13.  \"O Harry!\" I exclaimed, reproachfully.    14. \"Yes, ma'am I am,\" he sobbed; \"I have scarcely any thing--I mean  anything that's worth money--except things to eat and wear, and I'd have  to have them anyway.\"    15. \"Have to have them?\" I echoed, at the same time laying my sewing upon  the table, so that I might reason with him on that point; \"do you not  know, my son--\"    16. Just then Uncle Ben looked up from the paper he had been reading:  \"Harry,\" said he, \"I want to find out something about eyes; so, if you  will let me have yours, I will give you a dollar apiece for them.\"    17. \"For my eyes!\" exclaimed Harry, very much astonished.    18. \"Yes,\" resumed Uncle Ben, quietly, \"for your eyes. I will give you  chloroform, so it will not hurt you in the least, and you shall have a  beautiful glass pair for nothing, to wear in their place. Come, a dollar  apiece, cash down! What do you say? I will take them out as quick as a  wink.\"    19. \"Give you my eyes, uncle!\" cried Harry, looking wild at the very  thought, \"I think not.\" And the startled little fellow shook his head  defiantly.    20. \"Well, five, ten, twenty dollars, then.\" Harry shook his head at every  offer.    21. \"No, sir! I wouldn't let you have them for a thousand dollars! What  could I do without my eyes? I couldn't see mother, nor the baby, nor the  flowers, nor the horses, nor anything,\" added Harry, growing warmer and  warmer.    22. \"I will give you two thousand,\" urged Uncle Ben, taking a roll of bank  notes out of his pocket. Harry, standing at a respectful distance, shouted  that he never would do any such thing.    23. \"Very well,\" continued the uncle, with a serious air, at the same time  writing something in his notebook, \"I can't afford to give you more than  two thousand dollars, so I shall have to do without your eyes; but,\" he  added, \"I will tell you what I will do, I will give you twenty dollars if  you will let me put a few drops from this bottle in your ears. It will not  hurt, but it will make you deaf. I want to try some experiments with  deafness, you see. Come quickly, now! Here are the twenty dollars all  ready for you.\"    24. \"Make me deaf!\" shouted Harry, without even looking at the gold pieces  temptingly displayed upon the table. \"I guess you will not do that,  either. Why, I couldn't hear a single word if I were deaf, could I?\"    25. \"Probably not,\" replied Uncle Ben. So, of course, Harry refused again.  He would never give up his hearing, he said, \"no, not for three thousand  dollars.\"    26. Uncle Ben made another note in his book, and  then came out with large  bids for \"a right arm,\" then \"left arm,\" \"hands,\" \"feet,\" \"nose,\" finally  ending with an offer of ten thousand dollars for \"mother,\" and five  thousand for \"the baby.\"    27. To all of these offers Harry shook his head, his eyes flashing, and  exclamations of surprise and indignation bursting from his lips. At last,  Uncle Ben said he must give up his experiments, for Harry's prices were  entirely too high.    28. \"Ha! ha!\" laughed the boy, exultingly, and he folded his dimpled arms  and looked as if to say, \"I'd like to see the man who could pay them!\"    29. \"Why, Harry, look here!\" exclaimed Uncle Ben, peeping into his  notebook, \"here is a big addition sum, I tell you!\" He added the numbers,  and they amounted to thirty-two thousand dollars.    30. \"There, Harry,\" said Uncle Ben, \"don't you think you are foolish not  to accept some of my offers?\" \"No, sir, I don't,\" answered Harry,  resolutely. \"Then,\" said Uncle Ben, \"you talk of being poor, and by your  own showing you have treasures for which you will not take thirty-two  thousand dollars. What do you say to that?\"    31. Harry didn't know exactly what to say. So he blushed for a second, and  just then tears came rolling down his cheeks, and he threw his chubby arms  around my neck. \"Mother,\" he whispered, \"isn't God good to make everybody  so rich?\"      DEFINITIONS.--8.

Father Time, your footsteps go     Lightly as the falling snow.     In your swing I'm sitting, see!     Push me softly; one, two; three,     Twelve times only. Like a sheet,     Spread the snow beneath my feet.     Singing merrily, let me swing     Out of winter into spring.    2. Swing me out, and swing me in!     Trees are bare, but birds begin     Twittering to the peeping leaves,     On the bough beneath the eaves.     Wait,--one lilac bud I saw.     Icy hillsides feel the thaw.     April chased off March to-day;     Now I catch a glimpse of May.    3. Oh, the smell of sprouting grass!     In a blur the violets pass.     Whispering from the wildwood come     Mayflower's breath and insect's hum.     Roses carpeting the ground;     Thrushes, orioles, warbling sound:--     Swing me low, and swing me high,     To the warm clouds of July.    4. Slower now, for at my side     White pond lilies open wide.     Underneath the pine's tall spire     Cardinal blossoms burn like fire.     They are gone; the golden-rod     Flashes from the dark green sod.     Crickets in the grass I hear;     Asters light the fading year.    5. Slower still! October weaves     Rainbows of the forest leaves.     Gentians fringed, like eyes of blue,     Glimmer out of sleety dew.     Meadow green I sadly miss:     Winds through withered sedges hiss.     Oh, 't is snowing, swing me fast,     While December shivers past!    6. Frosty-bearded Father Time,     Stop your footfall on the rime!     Hard you push, your hand is rough;     You have swung me long enough.     \"Nay, no stopping,\" say you? Well,     Some of your best stories tell,     While you swing me--gently, do!--     From the Old Year to the New.      DEFINITIONS.--2. Twit'ter-ing, making a succession of small, chirping  noises. Glimpse, a short, hurried view. 3. Blur, a dim, confused  appearance. 6. Rime, whitefrost, hoarfrost.        XXVII. HARRY AND HIS DOG. (79)    1. \"Beg, Frisk, beg,\" said little Harry, as he sat on an inverted basket,  at his grandmother's door, eating, with great satisfaction, a porringer of  bread and milk. His little sister Annie, who had already dispatched her  breakfast, sat on the ground opposite to him, now twisting her flowers  into garlands, and now throwing them away.    2. \"Beg, Frisk, beg!\" repeated Harry, holding a bit of bread just out of  the dog's reach; and the obedient Frisk squatted himself on his hind legs,  and held up his fore paws, waiting for master Harry to give him the  tempting morsel.    3. The little boy and the little dog were great friends. Frisk loved him  dearly, much better than he did anyone else; perhaps, because he  recollected that Harry was his earliest and firmest friend during a time  of great trouble.    4. Poor Frisk had come as a stray dog to Milton, the place where Harry  lived. If he could have told his own story, it would probably have been a  very pitiful one, of kicks and cuffs, of hunger and foul weather.    5. Certain it is, he made his appearance at the very door where Harry was  now sitting, in miserable plight, wet, dirty, and half starved; and that  there he met Harry, who took a fancy to him, and Harry's grandmother, who  drove him off with a broom.    6. Harry, at length, obtained permission for the little dog to remain as a  sort of outdoor pensioner, and fed him with stray bones and cold potatoes,  and such things as he could get for him. He also provided him with a  little basket to sleep in, the very same which, turned up, afterward  served Harry for a seat.    7. After a while, having proved his good qualities by barking away a set  of pilferers, who were making an attack on the great pear tree, he was  admitted into the house, and became one of its most vigilant and valued  inmates. He could fetch or carry either by land or water; would pick up a  thimble or a ball of cotton, if little Annie should happen to drop them;  or take Harry's dinner to school for him with perfect honesty.    8. \"Beg, Frisk, beg!\" said Harry, and gave him, after long waiting, the  expected morsel. Frisk was satisfied, but Harry was not. The little boy,  though a good-humored fellow in the main, had turns of naughtiness, which  were apt to last him all day, and this promised to prove one of his worst.  It was a holiday, and in the afternoon his cousins, Jane and William, were  to come and see him "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14883"],[0,"Grandmother Elsie (#11)"],[1," our Vi is one  in a thousand.\"    \"Thank you, mamma, for saying it,\" Elsie said, her eyes shining with  pleasure. \"She seems all that to me; but I thought it might be that  mother love magnified her good qualities and made me blind to her  imperfections.\"    Violet, in the nursery at home, was showing herself worthy of these  encomiums by her efforts to amuse the little ones and keep them from  missing the dear mother who had been so constantly with them of late. She  played quiet little games with them, told them beautiful stories, showed  them pictures and drew others for them, dressed dolls for Rosie and cut  paper horses for Walter.    Several hours were passed thus, then seeing them begin to look weary--for  they were still weak from their recent illness--she coaxed them to lie  down while she sang them to sleep.    The closed eyes and soft breathing telling that they slept, she rose and  bent over them a moment, gazing tenderly into each little face, then  drawing out her watch and turning to the old nurse, whispered, \"It is time  for me to dress for dinner, mammy. I'll go now, but if they wake and want  me let me know at once.\"    Her toilet was scarcely completed when the sound of wheels caught her  ears.    \"There! mamma has come! Dear, dear mamma!\" she said half aloud, and  presently hastened from the room to meet and welcome her.    But instead a servant was coming leisurely up the broad stairway.    \"Where is mamma, Prilla?\" the young girl asked in a slightly disappointed  tone.    \"Miss Elsie not come yet, Miss Wilet. De gentlemen is in de drawin'-room,\"  Prilla answered, handing two visiting-cards to her young mistress.    \"'Donald Keith, U.S.A.,'\" read Violet with a brightening countenance, as  she glanced at the first.    On the other was inscribed, \"L. Raymond, U.S.N.\"    Violet hastening to the drawing-room, met her cousin with outstretched  hand and cordial greeting.    \"I am so glad you have come, Cousin Donald! We have all wanted you to see  Ion.\"    \"Thank you, Cousin Violet; you can't have wished it more than I, I am  sure,\" he said, with a look of delight. \"Allow me to introduce my friend,  Captain Raymond, of the navy. You see I took your grandfather at his word  and brought a friend with me.\"    Violet had already given her hand to her cousin's friend--as such he must  have no doubtful welcome--but at Donald's concluding sentence she turned  to him again with a look of surprised inquiry, which he was about to  answer, when the door opened and Mr. Dinsmore, his wife and daughter came  in.    There were fresh greetings and introductions, Mr. Dinsmore saying, as he  shook hands with the guests, \"So you received my hasty note, Donald, and  accepted for yourself and friend? That was right. You are both most  welcome, and we hope will find Ion pleasant enough to be willing to  prolong your stay and to desire to visit us again.\"    \"Thank you, I was certain of that before I came,\" said Donald.    \"And I surely am now that I am here,\" remarked the captain gallantly, and  with an admiring glance from Mrs. Dinsmore's still fresh, bright, and  comely face to the more beautiful ones of Elsie and her daughter.    Elsie's beauty had not faded, she was still young and fair in appearance,  with the same sweetly pure and innocent expression which old Mrs. Dinsmore  had been wont to stigmatize as \"that babyish look.\" And Violet's face was  peerless in its fresh young beauty.    As for the captain himself, he was a man of commanding presence, noble  countenance, and magnificent physique, with fine dark eyes and an  abundance of dark brown curling hair and beard; evidently Donald's senior  by some years, yet not looking much, if at all, over thirty.    The two older ladies presently left the room to reappear shortly in dinner  dress.    While they were gone Mr. Dinsmore engaged the captain in conversation,  and Donald and Violet talked together in a low aside.    \"Your sister is well, I hope?\" he remarked interrogatively.    \"Elsie? We had letters from her and Edward this morning. They were well at  the time of writing.\"    \"They are not at home then?\" he said in a tone of surprise and  disappointment.    \"Oh, no! had you not heard?\" and Violet's eyes filled. \"It is very  foolish, I'm afraid,\" she went on in half tremulous tones, in answer to  his inquiring look, \"but I can't help feeling that Lester Leland has  robbed me of my sister.\"    \"She is married? and has gone to a home of her own?\"    Violet answered by telling the story as succinctly as possible.    \"He was in Italy pursuing his art studies,\" she said. \"They had become  engaged shortly before he went, and a few weeks ago we heard he was very  ill with typhoid fever. Elsie at once said she must go to him, she could  not let him die for lack of good nursing. So grandpa and mamma consented  to her going with Edward and our faithful old Ben--papa's foster-brother  and body-servant, who travelled for years with him in Europe--for  protectors.    \"Of course she took a maid too, and Aunt Louise offered to go with them,  but was taken sick in New York, so had to be left behind.    \"They found Lester very but not hopelessly ill, and the joy of seeing them  had an excellent effect. So they were married, Cousin Donald. Just think  how sad for poor Elsie! away from mamma and all of us except Edward!\"    \"It was sad for her, I am sure!\" he said with warm sympathy, \"and very,  very noble and unselfish in her to leave all for him.\"    \"Yes; and yet not more, I think, than any right-minded woman would do for  the man she loved well enough to marry.\"    Harold and Herbert came in at that moment full of boyish enthusiasm and  delight over the arrival of \"Cousin Donald,\" whom they liked and admired  extremely; in especial for his fine figure, soldierly bearing, and  pleasant, kindly manner.    They had hardly done shaking hands with him and Captain Raymond, to whom  their grandfather introduced them with a look of paternal pride, when  their mother and \"Grandma Rose\" returned to the drawing-room, and dinner  was announced.          CHAPTER VIII.        \"A man's heart deviseth his way; but the Lord directeth his      steps.\"--_Prov._ 16:9.      The boys were greatly disappointed on learning from the talk at the  dinner-table that Cousin Donald's furlough was so short that he could give  but two days to his Ion friends.    There were many expressions of regret. Then Mr. Dinsmore said, \"If you  must leave us so soon we must make good use of our time, by taking you at  once to see relatives, friends, and places of interest in the  neighborhood. If you and the captain are not too weary to enjoy a ride or  drive, we will go to Roselands for a call this afternoon, then on to the  Oaks to take tea with my son Horace and his family.\"    \"You can assure us of a welcome at both places?\" Donald said inquiringly  and with a slight smile.    \"You need not have the slightest fear on that score,\" was the quick,  earnest rejoinder.    \"I for one,\" remarked the captain, \"am not in the least fatigued, and if  the ladies are to be of the party, accept with pleasure and thanks.\"    \"I also,\" said Donald, with a look at Violet which seemed to express a  hope that she was not intending to remain behind.    Mrs. Dinsmore and Mrs. Travilla excused themselves from going on the plea  of fatigue from recent nursing of the sick and the long drive of the  morning, Elsie adding that her little convalescents ought hardly to be  deprived of mamma all day.    \"Then we will take Vi,\" said Mr. Dinsmore, looking affectionately at her;  \"she has shut herself up with those same convalescents all the morning and  needs air and exercise.\"    \"Yes, papa,\" her mother said, \"and I know she would enjoy a gallop on her  favorite pony. Cousin,\" turning to Donald, \"we have both riding and  carriage horses at your and the captain's service; please do not hesitate  to express your preference.\"    They thanked her, and after a little more discussion it was arranged that  the whole party, including Harold and Herbert, should ride.    The horses were ordered at once and they set out very shortly after  leaving the table. Mr. Dinsmore and the captain headed the cavalcade,  Donald and Violet came next, riding side by side, and the two lads brought  up the rear.    Donald was well satisfied with the arrangement, and he and Vi found a  good deal of enjoyment in recalling the scenes, doings, and happenings of  the past summer; particularly of the weeks spent together on the New  Jersey coast.    Also Vi rehearsed to him Edward's account of Elsie's wedding and his  description of the suite of apartments he had had fitted up for their use.  Edward expected to spend the winter there, she said.    It was all very interesting to Donald. He thought Lester Leland a man to  be envied, yet perhaps less so than he who should secure for his own the  fair, sweet maiden riding by his side.    They passed a pleasant hour at Roselands, seeing all the family except the  invalid, then rode on to the Oaks, where they found a warm welcome and  most delightful and hospitable entertainment.    Then the return to Ion by moonlight was very enjoyable.    It was still early when they arrived; the two older ladies awaited them in  the parlor, and some time was spent in pleasant converse before retiring  for the night.    \"I have not yet had the pleasure of seeing my little favorites, Rosie and  Walter, Cousin Elsie,\" remarked Donald.    \"No,\" she said, \"and they are very eager for an interview with you. They  are in bed now, but I hope they will be well enough to join us at  breakfast to-morrow.\"    \"They have been quite sick?\"    \"Yes, were dangerously ill for a time, and though about again, still need  constant care lest they should take cold.\"    The guests given adjoining rooms, opened the door of communication between  and had a little private chat together before seeking their pillows.    \"These relatives of yours, Keith, are extremely "]]]
