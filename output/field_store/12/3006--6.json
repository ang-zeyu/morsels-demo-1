After these storms, as though it were being  pushed up from below, the river seemed to rise in the centre, to  become convex. By some optical illusion, it seemed to fall away on  either hand to the depth of three or four feet.    But as a rule we had a brilliant, gorgeous sunshine that made the  eddying waters flash and sparkle, and caused the banks of sand to  glare like whitewashed walls, and turn the sharp, hard fronds of the  palms into glittering sword-blades. The movement of the boat  tempered the heat, and in lazy content we sat in our lookout box and  smiled upon the world. Except for the throb of the engine and the  slow splash, splash, splash of the wheel there was no sound. We  might have been adrift in the heart of a great ocean. So complete  was the silence, so few were the sounds of man's presence, that at  times one almost thought that ours was the first boat to disturb the  Congo.    Although we were travelling by boat, we spent as much time on land  as on the water. Because the _Deliverance_ burnt wood and, like an  invading army, \"lived on the country,\" she was always stopping to  lay in a supply. That gave Anfossi and myself a chance to visit the  native villages or to hunt in the forest.    To feed her steamers the State has established along the river-bank  posts for wood, and in theory at these places there always is a  sufficient supply of wood to carry a steamer to the next post. But  our experience was either that another steamer had just taken all  the wood or that the boys had decided to work no more and had hidden  themselves in the bush. The State posts were \"clearings,\" less than  one hundred yards square, cut out of the jungle. Sometimes only  black men were in charge, but as a rule the _chef de poste_ was a  lonely, fever-ridden white, whose only interest in our arrival was  his hope that we might spare him quinine. I think we gave away as  many grains of quinine as we received logs of wood. Empty-handed we  would turn from the wood post and steam a mile or so farther up the  river, where we would run into a bank, and a boy with a steel hawser  would leap overboard and tie up the boat to the roots of a tree.  Then all the boys would disappear into the jungle and attack the  primeval forest. Each was supplied with a machete and was expected  to furnish a _bras_ of wood. A _bras_ is a number of sticks about as  long and as thick as your arm, placed in a pile about three feet  high and about three feet wide. To fix this measure the head boy  drove poles into the bank three feet apart, and from pole to pole at  the same distance from the ground stretched a strip of bark. When  each boy had filled one of these openings all the wood was carried  on board, and we would unhitch the _Deliverance_, and she would  proceed to burn up the fuel we had just collected. It took the  twenty boys about four hours to cut the wood, and the _Deliverance_  the same amount of time to burn it. It was distinctly a  hand-to-mouth existence. As I have pointed out, when it is too dark  to see the currents, the Congo captains never attempt to travel. So  each night at sunset Captain Jensen ran into the bank, and as soon  as the plank was out all the black passengers and the crew passed  down it and spent the night on shore. In five minutes the women  would have the fires lighted and the men would be cutting grass  for bedding and running up little shelters of palm boughs and  hanging up linen strips that were both tents and mosquito nets.     [Illustration: The Native Wife of a _Chef de Poste_.]    In the moonlight the natives with their camp-fires and torches made  most wonderful pictures. Sometimes for their sleeping place the  captain would select a glade in the jungle, or where a stream had  cut a little opening in the forest, or a sandy island, with tall  rushes on either side and the hot African moon shining on the white  sand and turning the palms to silver, or they would pitch camp in a  buffalo wallow, where the grass and mud had been trampled into a  clay floor by the hoofs of hundreds of wild animals. But the fact  that they were to sleep where at sunrise and at sunset came  buffaloes, elephants, and panthers, disturbed the women not at all,  and as they bent, laughing, over the iron pots, the firelight shone  on their bare shoulders and was reflected from their white teeth and  rolling eyes and brazen bangles.    Until late in the night the goats would bleat, babies cry, and the  \"boys\" and \"mammies\" talked, sang, quarrelled, beat tom-toms, and  squeezed mournful groans out of the accordion of civilization. One  would have thought we had anchored off a busy village rather than at  a place where, before that night, the inhabitants had been only the  beasts of the jungle and the river.          IV    AMERICANS IN THE CONGO      In trying to sum up what I found in the Congo Free State, I think  what one fails to find there is of the greatest significance. To  tell what the place is like, you must tell what it lacks. One must  write of the Congo always in the negative. It is as though you  asked: \"What sort of a house is this one Jones has built?\" and were  answered: \"Well, it hasn't any roof, and it hasn't any cellar, and  it has no windows, floors, or chimneys. It's that kind of a house.\"    When first I arrived in the Congo the time I could spend there  seemed hopelessly inadequate. After I'd been there a month, it  seemed to me that in a very few days any one could obtain a  painfully correct idea of the place, and of the way it is  administered. If an orchestra starts on an piece of music with all  the instruments out of tune, it need not play through the entire  number for you to know that the instruments are out of tune.    The charges brought against Leopold II, as King of the Congo, are  three:    (_a_) That he has made slaves of the twenty million blacks he  promised to protect.    (_b_) That, in spite of his promise to keep the Congo open to trade,  he has closed it to all nations.    (_c_) That the revenues of the country and all of its trade he has  retained for himself.    Any one who visits the Congo and remains only two weeks will be  convinced that of these charges Leopold is guilty. In that time he  will not see atrocities, but he will see that the natives are  slaves, that no foreigner can trade with them, that in the interest  of Leopold alone the country is milked.    He will see that the government of Leopold is not a government. It  preserves the perquisites and outward signs of government. It coins  money, issues stamps, collects taxes. But it assumes none of the  responsibilities of government. The Congo Free State is only a great  trading house. And in it Leopold is the only wholesale and retail  trader. He gives a bar of soap for rubber, and makes a \"turn-over\"  of a cup of salt for ivory. He is not a monarch. He is a shopkeeper.    And were the country not so rich in rubber and ivory, were the  natives not sweated so severely, he also would be a bankrupt  shopkeeper. For the Congo is not only one vast trading post, but  also it is a trading post badly managed. Even in the republics of  Central America where the government changes so frequently, and  where each new president is trying to make hay while he can, there  is better administration, more is done for the people, the rights of  other nations are better respected.    Were the Congo properly managed, it would be one of the richest  territories on the surface of the earth. As it is, through ignorance  and cupidity, it is being despoiled and its people are the most  wretched of human beings. In the White Book containing the reports  of British vice-consuls on conditions in the Congo from April of  last year to January of this year, Mr. Mitchell tells how the  enslavement of the people still continues, how \"they\" (the  conscripts, as they are called) \"are hunted in the forest by  soldiers, and brought in chained by the neck like criminals.\" They  then, though conscripted to serve in the army, are set to manual  labor. They are slaves. The difference between the slavery under  Leopold and the slavery under the Arab raiders is that the Arab was  the better and kinder master. He took \"prisoners\" just as Leopold  seizes \"conscripts,\" but he had too much foresight to destroy whole  villages, to carry off all the black man's live stock, and to uproot  his vegetable gardens. He purposed to return. And he did not wish to  so terrify the blacks that to escape from him they would penetrate  farther into the jungle. His motive was purely selfish, but his  methods, compared with those of Leopold, were almost considerate.  The work the State to-day requires of the blacks is so oppressive  that they have no time, no heart, to labor for themselves.    In every other colony--French, English, German--in the native  villages I saw vegetable gardens, goats, and chickens, large,  comfortable, three-room huts, fences, and, especially in the German  settlement of the Cameroons at Duala, many flower gardens. In Bell  Town at Duala I walked for miles through streets lined with such  huts and gardens, and saw whole families, the very old as well as  the very young, sitting contentedly in the shade of their trees, or  at work in their gardens. In the Congo native villages I saw but one  old person, of chickens or goats that were not to be given to the  government as taxes I saw none, and the vegetable gardens, when  there were any such, were cultivated for the benefit of the _chef de  poste_, and the huts were small, temporary, and filthy. The dogs in  the kennels on my farm are better housed, better fed, and much  better cared for, whether ill or well, than are the twenty millions  of blacks along the Congo River. And that these human beings are so  ill-treated is due absolutely to the cupidity of one man, and to the  apathy of the rest of the world. And it is due as much "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1430"],[0,"Beautiful Stories from Shakespeare (#11)"],[1,"behind him calling on him to stop.    It was the Count Paris, who was to have married Juliet that very day.    \"How dare you come here and disturb the dead bodies of the Capulets, you  vile Montagu?\" cried Paris.    Poor Romeo, half mad with sorrow, yet tried to answer gently.    \"You were told,\" said Paris, \"that if you returned to Verona you must  die.\"    \"I must indeed,\" said Romeo. \"I came here for nothing else. Good, gentle  youth--leave me! Oh, go--before I do you any harm! I love you better  than myself--go--leave me here--\"    Then Paris said, \"I defy you, and I arrest you as a felon,\" and Romeo,  in his anger and despair, drew his sword. They fought, and Paris was  killed.    As Romeo's sword pierced him, Paris cried--    \"Oh, I am slain! If thou be merciful, open the tomb, and lay me with  Juliet!\"    And Romeo said, \"In faith I will.\"    And he carried the dead man into the tomb and laid him by the dear  Juliet's side. Then he kneeled by Juliet and spoke to her, and held  her in his arms, and kissed her cold lips, believing that she was dead,  while all the while she was coming nearer and nearer to the time of her  awakening. Then he drank the poison, and died beside his sweetheart and  wife.    Now came Friar Laurence when it was too late, and saw all that had  happened--and then poor Juliet woke out of her sleep to find her husband  and her friend both dead beside her.    The noise of the fight had brought other folks to the place too, and  Friar Laurence, hearing them, ran away, and Juliet was left alone. She  saw the cup that had held the poison, and knew how all had happened, and  since no poison was left for her, she drew her Romeo's dagger and thrust  it through her heart--and so, falling with her head on her Romeo's  breast, she died. And here ends the story of these faithful and most  unhappy lovers.                *    *    *    *    *    *    *    And when the old folks knew from Friar Laurence of all that had  befallen, they sorrowed exceedingly, and now, seeing all the mischief  their wicked quarrel had wrought, they repented them of it, and over the  bodies of their dead children they clasped hands at last, in friendship  and forgiveness.          PERICLES        Pericles, the Prince of Tyre, was unfortunate enough to make an enemy of  Antiochus, the powerful and wicked King of Antioch; and so great was the  danger in which he stood that, on the advice of his trusty counselor,  Lord Helicanus, he determined to travel about the world for a time. He  came to this decision despite the fact that, by the death of his father,  he was now King of Tyre. So he set sail for Tarsus, appointing Helicanus  Regent during his absence. That he did wisely in thus leaving his  kingdom was soon made clear.    Hardly had he sailed on his voyage, when Lord Thaliard arrived from  Antioch with instructions from his royal master to kill Pericles. The  faithful Helicanus soon discovered the deadly purpose of this wicked  lord, and at once sent messengers to Tarsus to warn the King of the  danger which threatened him.    The people of Tarsus were in such poverty and distress that Pericles,  feeling that he could find no safe refuge there, put to sea again. But  a dreadful storm overtook the ship in which he was, and the good vessel  was wrecked, while of all on board only Pericles was saved. Bruised  and wet and faint, he was flung upon the cruel rocks on the coast of  Pentapolis, the country of the good King Simonides. Worn out as he was,  he looked for nothing but death, and that speedily. But some fishermen,  coming down to the beach, found him there, and gave him clothes and bade  him be of good cheer.    \"Thou shalt come home with me,\" said one of them, \"and we will have  flesh for holidays, fish for fasting days, and moreo'er, puddings and  flapjacks, and thou shalt be welcome.\"    They told him that on the morrow many princes and knights were going  to the King's Court, there to joust and tourney for the love of his  daughter, the beautiful Princess Thaisa.    \"Did but my fortunes equal my desires,\" said Pericles, \"I'd wish to make  one there.\"    As he spoke, some of the fishermen came by, drawing their net, and it  dragged heavily, resisting all their efforts, but at last they hauled it  in, to find that it contained a suit of rusty armor; and looking at it,  he blessed Fortune for her kindness, for he saw that it was his own,  which had been given to him by his dead father. He begged the fishermen  to let him have it that he might go to Court and take part in the  tournament, promising that if ever his ill fortunes bettered, he would  reward them well. The fishermen readily consented, and being thus fully  equipped, Pericles set off in his rusty armor to the King's Court.    In the tournament none bore himself so well as Pericles, and he won the  wreath of victory, which the fair Princess herself placed on his brows.  Then at her father's command she asked him who he was, and whence he  came; and he answered that he was a knight of Tyre, by name Pericles,  but he did not tell her that he was the King of that country, for he  knew that if once his whereabouts became known to Antiochus, his life  would not be worth a pin's purchase.    Nevertheless Thaisa loved him dearly, and the King was so pleased with  his courage and graceful bearing that he gladly permitted his daughter  to have her own way, when she told him she would marry the stranger  knight or die.    Thus Pericles became the husband of the fair lady for whose sake he  had striven with the knights who came in all their bravery to joust and  tourney for her love.    Meanwhile the wicked King Antiochus had died, and the people in Tyre,  hearing no news of their King, urged Lord Helicanus to ascend the vacant  throne. But they could only get him to promise that he would become  their King, if at the end of a year Pericles did not come back.  Moreover, he sent forth messengers far and wide in search of the missing  Pericles.    Some of these made their way to Pentapolis, and finding their King  there, told him how discontented his people were at his long absence,  and that, Antiochus being dead, there was nothing now to hinder him from  returning to his kingdom. Then Pericles told his wife and father-in-law  who he really was, and they and all the subjects of Simonides greatly  rejoiced to know that the gallant husband of Thaisa was a King in his  own right. So Pericles set sail with his dear wife for his native land.  But once more the sea was cruel to him, for again a dreadful storm broke  out, and while it was at its height, a servant came to tell him that  a little daughter was born to him. This news would have made his heart  glad indeed, but that the servant went on to add that his wife--his  dear, dear Thaisa--was dead.    While he was praying the gods to be good to his little baby girl,  the sailors came to him, declaring that the dead Queen must be thrown  overboard, for they believed that the storm would never cease so long  as a dead body remained in the vessel. So Thaisa was laid in a big chest  with spices and jewels, and a scroll on which the sorrowful King wrote  these lines:       \"Here I give to understand      (If e'er this coffin drive a-land),      I, King Pericles, have lost      This Queen worth all our mundane cost.      Who finds her, give her burying;      She was the daughter of a King;      Besides this treasure for a fee,      The gods requite his charity!\"    Then the chest was cast into the sea, and the waves taking it, by and  by washed it ashore at Ephesus, where it was found by the servants of a  lord named Cerimon. He at once ordered it to be opened, and when he  saw how lovely Thaisa looked, he doubted if she were dead, and took  immediate steps to restore her. Then a great wonder happened, for she,  who had been thrown into the sea as dead, came back to life. But feeling  sure that she would never see her husband again, Thaisa retired from the  world, and became a priestess of the Goddess Diana.    While these things were happening, Pericles went on to Tarsus with his  little daughter, whom he called Marina, because she had been born at  sea. Leaving her in the hands of his old friend the Governor of Tarsus,  the King sailed for his own dominions.    Now Dionyza, the wife of the Governor of Tarsus, was a jealous and  wicked woman, and finding that the young Princess grew up a more  accomplished and charming girl than her own daughter, she determined to  take Marina's life. So when Marina was fourteen, Dionyza ordered one of  her servants to take her away and kill her. This villain would have done  so, but that he was interrupted by some pirates who came in and carried  Marina off to sea with them, and took her to Mitylene, where they sold  her as a slave. Yet such was her goodness, her grace, and her beauty,  that she soon became honored there, and Lysimachus, the young Governor,  fell deep in love with her, and would have married her, but that he  thought she must be of too humble parentage to become the wife of one in  his high position.    The wicked Dionyza believed, from her servant's report, that Marina was  really dead, and so she put up a monument to her memory, and showed it  to King Pericles, when after long years of absence he came to see  his much-loved child. When he heard that she was dead, his grief was  terrible to see. He set sail once more, and putting on sackcloth, vowed  never to wash his face or cut his hair again. There was a pavilion  erected on deck, and there he lay alone, and for three months he spoke  word to none.    At last it chanced that his ship came into the port of Mitylene, and  Lysimachus, the Governor, went on board to enquire whence the vessel  came. When he heard the story of Pericles' sorrow and silence, he  bethought him of Marina, and believing that she could rouse the King  from his stupor, sent for her and bade her try her utmost to persuade  the King to speak,"]]]
