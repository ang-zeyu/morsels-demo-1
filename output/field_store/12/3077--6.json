At the moment when he was stating them in his mind,  three days after the scene at the Vaudeville, he was sitting, dressed  like a retired tradesman, in an old overcoat, with a muffler round his  neck, on a bench in the Avenue Victor-Hugo, at some distance from the  Square Lamartine. Victoire had his instructions to pass by that bench at  the same hour every morning.    \"Yes,\" he repeated to himself, \"the crystal stopper: everything turns on  that... Once I get hold of it...\"    Victoire arrived, with her shopping-basket on her arm. He at once  noticed her extraordinary agitation and pallor:    \"What's the matter?\" asked Lupin, walking beside his old nurse.    She went into a big grocer's, which was crowded with people, and,  turning to him:    \"Here,\" she said, in a voice torn with excitement. \"Here's what you've  been hunting for.\"    And, taking something from her basket, she gave it to him.    Lupin stood astounded: in his hand lay the crystal stopper.    \"Can it be true? Can it be true?\" he muttered, as though the ease of the  solution had thrown him off his balance.    But the fact remained, visible and palpable. He recognized by its shape,  by its size, by the worn gilding of its facets, recognized beyond any  possible doubt the crystal stopper which he had seen before. He even  remarked a tiny, hardly noticeable little scratch on the stem which he  remembered perfectly.    However, while the thing presented all the same characteristics, it  possessed no other that seemed out of the way. It was a crystal stopper,  that was all. There was no really special mark to distinguish it from  other stoppers. There was no sign upon it, no stamp; and, being cut from  a single piece, it contained no foreign object.    \"What then?\"    And Lupin received a quick insight into the depth of his mistake. What  good could the possession of that crystal stopper do him so long as he  was ignorant of its value? That bit of glass had no existence in itself;  it counted only through the meaning that attached to it. Before taking  it, the thing was to be certain. And how could he tell that, in taking  it, in robbing Daubrecq of it, he was not committing an act of folly?    It was a question which was impossible of solution, but which forced  itself upon him with singular directness.    \"No blunders!\" he said to himself, as he pocketed the stopper. \"In this  confounded business, blunders are fatal.\"    He had not taken his eyes off Victoire. Accompanied by a shopman, she  went from counter to counter, among the throng of customers. She next  stood for some little while at the pay-desk and passed in front of  Lupin.    He whispered her instructions:    \"Meet me behind the Lycee Janson.\"    She joined him in an unfrequented street:    \"And suppose I'm followed?\" she said.    \"No,\" he declared. \"I looked carefully. Listen to me. Where did you find  the stopper?\"    \"In the drawer of the table by his bed.\"    \"But we had felt there already.\"    \"Yes; and I did so again this morning. I expect he put it there last  night.\"    \"And I expect he'll want to take it from there again,\" said Lupin.    \"Very likely.\"    \"And suppose he finds it gone?\"    Victoire looked frightened.    \"Answer me,\" said Lupin. \"If he finds it gone, he'll accuse you of  taking it, won't he?\"    \"Certainly.\"    \"Then go and put it back, as fast as you can.\"    \"Oh dear, oh dear!\" she moaned. \"I hope he won't have had time to find  out. Give it to me, quick.\"    \"Here you are,\" said Lupin.    He felt in the pocket of his overcoat.    \"Well?\" said Victoire, holding out her hand.    \"Well,\" he said, after a moment, \"it's gone.\"    \"What!\"    \"Yes, upon my word, it's gone... somebody's taken it from me.\"    He burst into a peal of laughter, a laughter which, this time, was free  from all bitterness.    Victoire flew out at him:    \"Laugh away!... Putting me in such a predicament!...\"    \"How can I help laughing? You must confess that it's funny. It's  no longer a tragedy that we're acting, but a fairy-tale, as much a  fairy-tale as Puss in Boots or Jack and the Beanstalk. I must write it  when I get a few weeks to myself: The Magic Stopper; or, The Mishaps of  Poor Arsene.\"    \"Well... who has taken it from you?\"    \"What are you talking about?... It has flown away... vanished from my  pocket: hey presto, begone!\"    He gave the old servant a gentle push and, in a more serious tone:    \"Go home, Victoire, and don't upset yourself. Of course, some one saw  you give me the stopper and took advantage of the crowd in the shop to  pick my pocket of it. That only shows that we are watched more closely  than I thought and by adversaries of the first rank. But, once more, be  easy. Honest men always come by their own... Have you anything else to  tell me?\"    \"Yes. Some one came yesterday evening, while M. Daubrecq was out. I saw  lights reflected upon the trees in the garden.\"    \"The portress' bedroom?\"    \"The portress was up.\"    \"Then it was some of those detective-fellows; they are still hunting.  I'll see you later, Victoire. You must let me in again.\"    \"What! You want to...\"    \"What do I risk? Your room is on the third floor. Daubrecq suspects  nothing.\"    \"But the others!\"    \"The others? If it was to their interest to play me a trick, they'd have  tried before now. I'm in their way, that's all. They're not afraid of  me. So till later, Victoire, at five o'clock exactly.\"    One further surprise awaited Lupin. In the evening his old nurse told  him that, having opened the drawer of the bedside table from curiosity,  she had found the crystal stopper there again.    Lupin was no longer to be excited by these miraculous incidents. He  simply said to himself:    \"So it's been brought back. And the person who brought it back and who  enters this house by some unexplained means considered, as I did, that  the stopper ought not to disappear. And yet Daubrecq, who knows that he  is being spied upon to his very bedroom, has once more left the stopper  in a drawer, as though he attached no importance to it at all! Now what  is one to make of that?\"    Though Lupin did not make anything of it, nevertheless he could not  escape certain arguments, certain associations of ideas that gave him  the same vague foretaste of light which one receives on approaching the  outlet of a tunnel.    \"It is inevitable, as the case stands,\" he thought, \"that there must  soon be an encounter between myself and the others. From that moment I  shall be master of the situation.\"    Five days passed, during which Lupin did not glean the slightest  particular. On the sixth day Daubrecq received a visit, in the small  hours, from a gentleman, Laybach the deputy, who, like his colleagues,  dragged himself at his feet in despair and, when all was done, handed  him twenty thousand francs.    Two more days; and then, one night, posted on the landing of the  second floor, Lupin heard the creaking of a door, the front-door, as he  perceived, which led from the hall into the garden. In the darkness  he distinguished, or rather divined, the presence of two persons, who  climbed the stairs and stopped on the first floor, outside Daubrecq's  bedroom.    What were they doing there? It was not possible to enter the room,  because Daubrecq bolted his door every night. Then what were they  hoping?    Manifestly, a handiwork of some kind was being performed, as Lupin  discovered from the dull sounds of rubbing against the door. Then words,  uttered almost beneath a whisper, reached him:    \"Is it all right?\"    \"Yes, quite, but, all the same, we'd better put it off till to-morrow,  because...\"    Lupin did not hear the end of the sentence. The men were already groping  their way downstairs. The hall-door was closed, very gently, and then  the gate.    \"It's curious, say what one likes,\" thought Lupin. \"Here is a house in  which Daubrecq carefully conceals his rascalities and is on his guard,  not without good reason, against spies; and everybody walks in and out  as in a booth at a fair. Victoire lets me in, the portress admits the  emissaries of the police: that's well and good; but who is playing false  in these people's favour? Are we to suppose that they are acting alone?  But what fearlessness! And how well they know their way about!\"    In the afternoon, during Daubrecq's absence, he examined the door of the  first-floor bedroom. And, at the first glance, he understood: one of the  lower panels had been skilfully cut out and was only held in place by  invisible tacks. The people, therefore, who had done this work were the  same who had acted at his two places, in the Rue Matignon and the Rue  Chateaubriand.    He also found that the work dated back to an earlier period and that, as  in his case, the opening had been prepared beforehand, in anticipation  of favourable circumstances or of some immediate need.    The day did not seem long to Lupin. Knowledge was at hand. Not only  would he discover the manner in which his adversaries employed those  little openings, which were apparently unemployable, since they did  not allow a person to reach the upper bolts, but he would learn who the  ingenious and energetic adversaries were with whom he repeatedly and  inevitably found himself confronted.    One incident annoyed him. In the evening Daubrecq, who had complained of  feeling tired at dinner, came home at ten o'clock and, contrary to his  usual custom, pushed the bolts of the hall-door. In that case, how would  the others be able to carry out their plan and go to Daubrecq's room?  Lupin waited for an hour after Daubrecq put out his light. Then he went  down to the deputy's study, opened one of the windows ajar and returned  to the third floor and fixed his rope-ladder so that, in case of need,  he could reach the study without passing though the house. Lastly, he  resumed his post on the second-floor landing.    He did not have to wait long. An hour earlier than on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1565"],[0,"The Last Days of Pompeii (#11)"],[1,"presentiment of evil, turn for refuge to each other, their gaze at the  same moment left the mountain, and full of unimaginable tenderness, met.  What need had they of words to say they loved?        Chapter VI    THE FOWLER SNARES AGAIN THE BIRD THAT HAD JUST ESCAPED, AND SETS HIS  NETS FOR A NEW VICTIM.    IN the history I relate, the events are crowded and rapid as those of  the drama.  I write of an epoch in which days sufficed to ripen the  ordinary fruits of years.    Meanwhile, Arbaces had not of late much frequented the house of Ione;  and when he had visited her he had not encountered Glaucus, nor knew he,  as yet, of that love which had so suddenly sprung up between himself and  his designs.  In his interest for the brother of Ione, he had been  forced, too, a little while, to suspend his interest in Ione herself.  His pride and his selfishness were aroused and alarmed at the sudden  change which had come over the spirit of the youth.  He trembled lest he  himself should lose a docile pupil, and Isis an enthusiastic servant.  Apaecides had ceased to seek or to consult him.  He was rarely to be  found; he turned sullenly from the Egyptian--nay, he fled when he  perceived him in the distance. Arbaces was one of those haughty and  powerful spirits accustomed to master others; he chafed at the notion  that one once his own should ever elude his grasp. He swore inly that  Apaecides should not escape him.    It was with this resolution that he passed through a thick grove in the  city, which lay between his house and that of Ione, in his way to the  latter; and there, leaning against a tree, and gazing on the ground, he  came unawares on the young priest of Isis.    'Apaecides!' said he--and he laid his hand affectionately on the young  man's shoulder.    The priest started; and his first instinct seemed to be that of flight.  'My son,' said the Egyptian, 'what has chanced that you desire to shun  me?'    Apaecides remained silent and sullen, looking down on the earth, as his  lips quivered, and his breast heaved with emotion.    'Speak to me, my friend,' continued the Egyptian.  'Speak. Something  burdens thy spirit.  What hast thou to reveal?'    'To thee--nothing.'    'And why is it to me thou art thus unconfidential?'    'Because thou hast been my enemy.'    'Let us confer,' said Arbaces, in a low voice; and drawing the reluctant  arm of the priest in his own, he led him to one of the seats which were  scattered within the grove.  They sat down--and in those gloomy forms  there was something congenial to the shade and solitude of the place.    Apaecides was in the spring of his years, yet he seemed to have  exhausted even more of life than the Egyptian; his delicate and regular  features were worn and colorless; his eyes were hollow, and shone with a  brilliant and feverish glare: his frame bowed prematurely, and in his  hands, which were small to effeminacy, the blue and swollen veins  indicated the lassitude and weakness of the relaxed fibres.  You saw in  his face a strong resemblance to Ione, but the expression was altogether  different from that majestic and spiritual calm which breathed so divine  and classical a repose over his sister's beauty.  In her, enthusiasm was  visible, but it seemed always suppressed and restrained; this made the  charm and sentiment of her countenance; you longed to awaken a spirit  which reposed, but evidently did not sleep.  In Apaecides the whole  aspect betokened the fervor and passion of his temperament, and the  intellectual portion of his nature seemed, by the wild fire of the eyes,  the great breadth of the temples when compared with the height of the  brow, the trembling restlessness of the lips, to be swayed and  tyrannized over by the imaginative and ideal.  Fancy, with the sister,  had stopped short at the golden goal of poetry; with the brother, less  happy and less restrained, it had wandered into visions more intangible  and unembodied; and the faculties which gave genius to the one  threatened madness to the other.    'You say I have been your enemy,' said Arbaces, 'I know the cause of  that unjust accusation: I have placed you amidst the priests of  Isis--you are revolted at their trickeries and imposture--you think that  I too have deceived you--the purity of your mind is offended--you  imagine that I am one of the deceitful...'    'You knew the jugglings of that impious craft,' answered Apaecides; 'why  did you disguise them from me?--When you excited my desire to devote  myself to the office whose garb I bear, you spoke to me of the holy life  of men resigning themselves to knowledge--you have given me for  companions an ignorant and sensual herd, who have no knowledge but that  of the grossest frauds; you spoke to me of men sacrificing the earthlier  pleasures to the sublime cultivation of virtue--you place me amongst men  reeking with all the filthiness of vice; you spoke to me of the friends,  the enlighteners of our common kind--I see but their cheats and  deluders!  Oh!  it was basely done!--you have robbed me of the glory of  youth, of the convictions of virtue, of the sanctifying thirst after  wisdom.  Young as I was, rich, fervent, the sunny pleasures of earth  before me, I resigned all without a sign, nay, with happiness and  exultation, in the thought that I resigned them for the abstruse  mysteries of diviner wisdom, for the companionship of gods--for the  revelations of Heaven--and now--now...'    Convulsive sobs checked the priest's voice; he covered his face with his  hands, and large tears forced themselves through the wasted fingers, and  ran profusely down his vest.    'What I promised to thee, that will I give, my friend, my pupil: these  have been but trials to thy virtue--it comes forth the brighter for thy  novitiate--think no more of those dull cheats--assort no more with those  menials of the goddess, the atrienses of her hall--you are worthy to  enter into the penetralia.  I henceforth will be your priest, your  guide, and you who now curse my friendship shall live to bless it.'    The young man lifted up his head, and gazed with a vacant and wondering  stare upon the Egyptian.    'Listen to me,' continued Arbaces, in an earnest and solemn voice,  casting first his searching eyes around to see that they were still  alone.  'From Egypt came all the knowledge of the world; from Egypt came  the lore of Athens, and the profound policy of Crete; from Egypt came  those early and mysterious tribes which (long before the hordes of  Romulus swept over the plains of Italy, and in the eternal cycle of  events drove back civilization into barbarism and darkness) possessed  all the arts of wisdom and the graces of intellectual life.  From Egypt  came the rites and the grandeur of that solemn Caere, whose inhabitants  taught their iron vanquishers of Rome all that they yet know of elevated  in religion and sublime in worship.  And how deemest thou, young man,  that that Egypt, the mother of countless nations, achieved her  greatness, and soared to her cloud-capt eminence of wisdom?--It was the  result of a profound and holy policy.  Your modern nations owe their  greatness to Egypt--Egypt her greatness to her priests.  Rapt in  themselves, coveting a sway over the nobler part of man, his soul and  his belief, those ancient ministers of God were inspired with the  grandest thought that ever exalted mortals.  From the revolutions of the  stars, from the seasons of the earth, from the round and unvarying  circle of human destinies, they devised an august allegory; they made it  gross and palpable to the vulgar by the signs of gods and goddesses, and  that which in reality was Government they named Religion.  Isis is a  fable--start not!--that for which Isis is a type is a reality, an  immortal being; Isis is nothing.  Nature, which she represents, is the  mother of all things--dark, ancient, inscrutable, save to the gifted  few.  \"None among mortals hath ever lifted up my veil,\" so saith the  Isis that you adore; but to the wise that veil hath been removed, and we  have stood face to face with the solemn loveliness of Nature.  The  priests then were the benefactors, the civilizers of mankind; true, they  were also cheats, impostors if you will.  But think you, young man, that  if they had not deceived their kind they could have served them?  The  ignorant and servile vulgar must be blinded to attain to their proper  good; they would not believe a maxim--they revere an oracle.  The  Emperor of Rome sways the vast and various tribes of earth, and  harmonizes the conflicting and disunited elements; thence come peace,  order, law, the blessings of life. Think you it is the man, the emperor,  that thus sways?--no, it is the pomp, the awe, the majesty that surround  him--these are his impostures, his delusions; our oracles and our  divinations, our rites and our ceremonies, are the means of our  sovereignty and the engines of our power.  They are the same means to  the same end, the welfare and harmony of mankind.  You listen to me rapt  and intent--the light begins to dawn upon you.'    Apaecides remained silent, but the changes rapidly passing over his  speaking countenance betrayed the effect produced upon him by the words  of the Egyptian--words made tenfold more eloquent by the voice, the  aspect, and the manner of the man.    'While, then,' resumed Arbaces, 'our fathers of the Nile thus achieved  the first elements by whose life chaos is destroyed, namely, the  obedience and reverence of the multitude for the few, they drew from  their majestic and starred meditations that wisdom which was no  delusion: they invented the codes and regularities of law--the arts and  glories of existence.  They asked belief; they returned the gift by  civilization.  Were not their very cheats a virtue!  Trust me, whosoever  in yon far heavens of a diviner and more beneficent nature look down  upon our world, smile approvingly on the wisdom which has"]]]
