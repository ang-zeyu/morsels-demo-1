It never entered into my head that I should get an early appointment;  the fact of the Quartermaster-General thinking of me as a possible  recruit was quite enough for me. I was in no hurry to leave the Horse  Artillery, to which I was proud of belonging, and in which I hoped to  see service while still on the frontier. I left Simla very pleased  with the result of my visit, and very grateful to Colonel Becher, who  proved a good friend to me ever after, and I made my way to Mian Mir,  where I went through the riding-school course, and then returned to  Peshawar.    (1856) The winter of 1855-56 passed much as the cold weather generally  does in the north of India. Our amusements consisted of an occasional  race-meeting or cricket match. Polo was unknown in those days, and  hunting the jackal, a sport which has been a source of so much  recreation to the Peshawar garrison for thirty odd years, had not then  been thought of. It was a pleasant change to visit the outposts, and  whenever I got the chance I rode over to Mardan, where the Corps  of Guides were stationed, commanded by that gallant soldier, Harry  Lumsden,[8] who had raised the corps in 1846 under the auspices of  Henry Lawrence. Many were the good gallops I enjoyed with his hawks,  hunting the _aubara_.[9] Of work there was plenty at Peshawar, for the  Brigadier, Sydney Cotton,[10] kept us alive with field days, carefully  instilling into us his idea that parade-grounds were simply useful for  drill and preliminary instruction, and that as soon as the rudiments  of a soldier's education had been learnt, the troops should leave  their nursery, and try as far as possible to practise in peace what  they would have to do in war. Sydney Cotton was never tired of  explaining that the machinery of war, like all other machinery, should  be kept, so to speak, oiled and ready for use.    My dream of a staff appointment was realized more quickly than I had  expected. In the early part of 1856 the Surveyor-General applied for  the services of two or three experienced officers to assist in the  survey of Kashmir. Lumsden, the D.A.Q.M.G., was one of those selected  for the duty, and I was appointed to officiate for him. So delighted  was I to get my foot on the lowest rung of the staff ladder, that I  cheerfully agreed to the condition my Captain insisted upon, that I  should perform my regimental duties in addition to the staff work.  Things went merrily with me for a short time, when most unexpectedly  my hopes of some day becoming Quartermaster-General of the Army in  India were dashed to the ground by the Governor-General refusing  to confirm my appointment, because I had not passed the prescribed  examination in Hindustani. A rule existed requiring a language test,  but it had seldom been enforced, certainly not in the case of 'acting  appointments,' so that this refusal came as a great blow to me. It  had, however, excellent results, for it made me determined to pass in  Hindustani. It was then May, and in July the half-yearly examination  was to be held. I forthwith engaged the best _munshi_[11] at Peshawar,  shut myself up, and studied Indian literature from morning till night,  until I felt pretty confident of success.    Just before the examination took place, the officer who had stepped  into my shoes when I was turned out (Lieutenant Mordaunt Fitz-Gerald,  of my own regiment) was offered an appointment in the Punjab Frontier  Force. He consulted me as to the advisability of accepting it, and  I told him I thought he ought not to do so. I considered this most  disinterested advice, for I had good reason to believe that I should  be re-appointed to the staff, should the appointment again become  vacant. Fortunately for me, Fitz-Gerald followed the usual procedure  of those who delight in consulting their friends. He listened to my  advice, and then decided not to follow it. Accordingly, he joined the  Punjab Frontier Force, whilst I, having passed the examination, went  back to the coveted appointment, and continued in the department, with  the exception of one or two short intervals, until 1878, when I left  it as Quartermaster-General.    The autumn of 1856 was a very sickly one at Peshawar; fever was rife  amongst the troops, and in the hope of shaking it off Brigadier Cotton  got permission to take a certain number into camp. It was September,  and the sun was still very hot, so that it was necessary to begin the  daily march long before dawn in order to reach the new camping ground  while it was still tolerably cool. We crossed the Kabul river at  Nowshera, which place was then being made into a station for troops,  and marched about the Yusafzai plain for three weeks. The chief  difficulty was the absence of water, and I had to prospect the country  every afternoon for a sufficient supply, and to determine, with regard  to this _sine qua non_, where the camp should be pitched the next day.  On one occasion the best place I could discover was between two and  three miles off the main road. There was no difficulty in reaching it  by day, but I was afraid of some mistake being made when we had to  leave it in the small hours of the morning, few things being more  bewildering than to find one's way in the dark from a camp pitched in  the open country when once the tents have been struck. It was my duty  to lead the column and see that it marched off in the right direction;  knowing how anxious the Brigadier was that the new ground should be  reached while it was cool, and the men be thus saved from exposure to  the sun, I was careful to note my position with regard to the stars,  and to explain to the officer who was in orders to command the advance  guard the direction he must take. When the time came to start, and the  Brigadier was about to order the bugler to sound the march, I saw that  the advance guard was drawn up at right angles to the way in which we  had to proceed. The officer commanding it was positive he was right,  and in this he was supported by Brigadier Cotton and some of the other  officers; I was equally positive that he was wrong, and that if we  marched as he proposed, we should find ourselves several miles out  of our course. The Brigadier settled the question by saying I was  responsible for the troops going in the right direction, and ordering  me to show the way. The country was perfectly bare, there was not  a tree or object of any kind to guide me, and the distance seemed  interminable. I heard opinions freely expressed that I was on the  wrong road, and at last, when the Brigadier himself came up to me and  said he thought I must have lost the way, I really began to waver in  my conviction that I was right. At that moment my horse stumbled into  a ditch, which proved to be the boundary of the main road. I was  immensely relieved, the Brigadier was delighted, and from that moment  I think he was satisfied that I had, what is so essential to a  Quartermaster-General in the field, the bump of locality.    In October the Artillery moved into the practice camp at Chamkanie,  about five miles from Peshawar. It was intended that we should remain  there for a couple of months, but before the end of that time I had  to join the General at Rawal Pindi, where he had gone on a tour of  inspection. Being anxious not to shirk my regimental duty, I did not  leave Chamkanie until the last moment, and had but one day in which  to reach Rawal Pindi, a distance of one hundred miles, which I  accomplished on horseback between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m., only stopping at  Attock a short time for refreshment.    This tour with General Reed ended my staff duties for a time, as  the survey in Kashmir had come to an end and Lumsden rejoined his  appointment before Christmas.

He was an officer  of unusual energy and activity, a fine rider, a pattern drill, and a  thorough soldier all round. He was not fortunate enough to see much  active service, but it must have been a source of consolation to him  to feel, when ending his days as Governor of the Royal Hospital at  Chelsea, that it was in a great measure owing to his foresight and  decision that there was no serious disturbance at Peshawar during the  eventful summer of 1857.]    [Footnote 11: Instructor in Oriental languages.]           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER V.  1856-1857      Lord Dalhousie's Afghan policy--Treaty with Dost Mahomed    --War with Persia--The advantage of the Amir's friendship    --John Nicholson--'A pillar of strength on the frontier'      Towards the close of the year 1856, a rumour reached us that the Amir,  Dost Mahomed Khan, was shortly expected to arrive at Peshawar to meet  the Chief Commissioner, Sir John Lawrence, who had recently been made  a K.C.B.

I desire no consolation which taketh away from me compunction,  I love no contemplation which leadeth to pride.  For all that is  high is not holy, nor is everything that is sweet good; every  desire is not pure; nor is everything that is dear to us pleasing  unto God.  Willingly do I accept that grace whereby I am made  humbler and more wary and more ready to renounce myself.  He who  is made learned by the gift of grace and taught wisdom by the  stroke of the withdrawal thereof, will not dare to claim any good  thing for himself, but will rather confess that he is poor and  needy.  Give unto God the thing which is God's,(1) and ascribe to  thyself that which is thine; that is, give thanks unto God for  His grace, but for thyself alone confess thy fault, and that thy  punishment is deserved for thy fault.    4. Sit thou down always in the lowest room and thou shalt be  given the highest place.(2)  For the highest cannot be without  the lowest.  For the highest saints of God are least in their own  sight, and the more glorious they are, so much the lowlier are  they in themselves; full of grace and heavenly glory, they are  not desirous of vain-glory; resting on God and strong in His  might, they cannot be lifted up in any wise.  And they who  ascribe unto God all the good which they have received, \"seek not  glory one of another, but the glory which cometh from God only,\"  and they desire that God shall be praised in Himself and in all  His Saints above all things, and they are always striving for  this very thing.    5. Be thankful, therefore, for the least benefit and thou shalt  be worthy to receive greater.  Let the least be unto thee even as  the greatest, and let that which is of little account be unto  thee as a special gift.  If the majesty of the Giver be  considered, nothing that is given shall seem small and of no  worth, for that is not a small thing which is given by the Most  High God.  Yea, though He gave punishment and stripes, we ought  to be thankful, because He ever doth for our profit whatever He  suffereth to come upon us.  He who seeketh to retain the favour  of God, let him be thankful for the favour which is given, and  patient in respect of that which is taken away.  Let him pray  that it may return; let him be wary and humble that he lose it  not.    (1) Matthew xxii. 21.   (2) Luke xiv. 10.      CHAPTER XI    Of the fewness of those who love the Cross of Jesus    Jesus hath many lovers of His heavenly kingdom, but few bearers of  His Cross.  He hath many seekers of comfort, but few of  tribulation.  He findeth many companions of His table, but few of  His fasting.  All desire to rejoice with Him, few are willing to  undergo anything for His sake.  Many follow Jesus that they may  eat of His loaves, but few that they may drink of the cup of His  passion.  Many are astonished at His Miracles, few follow after  the shame of His Cross.  Many love Jesus so long as no  adversities happen to them.  Many praise Him and bless Him, so  long as they receive any comforts from Him.  But if Jesus hide  Himself and withdraw from them a little while, they fall either  into complaining or into too great dejection of mind.    2. But they who love Jesus for Jesus' sake, and not for any  consolation of their own, bless Him in all tribulation and  anguish of heart as in the highest consolation.  And if He should  never give them consolation, nevertheless they would always  praise Him and always give Him thanks.    3. Oh what power hath the pure love of Jesus, unmixed with any  gain or love of self!  Should not all they be called mercenary  who are always seeking consolations?  Do they not prove  themselves lovers of self more than of Christ who are always  seeking their own gain and advantage?  Where shall be found one  who is willing to serve God altogether for nought?    4. Rarely is any one found so spiritual as to be stripped of all  selfish thoughts, for who shall find a man truly poor in spirit  and free of all created things?  \"His value is from afar, yea  from the ends of the earth.\"  A man may give away all his goods,  yet that is nothing; and if he do many deeds of penitence, yet  that is a small thing; and though he understand all knowledge,  yet that is afar off; and if he have great virtue and zealous  devotion, yet much is lacking unto him, yea, one thing which is  the most necessary to him of all.  What is it then?  That having  given up all things besides, he give up himself and go forth from  himself utterly, and retain nothing of self-love; and having done  all things which he knoweth to be his duty to do, that he feel  that he hath done nothing.  Let him not reckon that much which  might be much esteemed, but let him pronounce himself to be in  truth an unprofitable servant, as the Truth Himself saith, When  ye have done all things that are commanded you, say, we are  unprofitable servants.(1)  Then may he be truly poor and naked in  spirit, and be able to say with the Prophet, As for me, I am poor  and needy.(2)  Nevertheless, no man is richer than he, no man  stronger, no man freer.  For he knoweth both how to give up  himself and all things, and how to be lowly in his own eyes.    (1) Luke xvii. 10.   (2) Psalm xxv. 16.      CHAPTER XII    Of the royal way of the Holy Cross    That seemeth a hard saying to many, If any man will come after  Me, let him deny himself and take up his Cross and follow Me.(1)  But it will be much harder to hear that last sentence, Depart  from me, ye wicked, into eternal fire.(2)  For they who now  willingly hear the word of the Cross and follow it, shall not  then fear the hearing of eternal damnation.  This sign of the  Cross shall be in heaven when the Lord cometh to Judgment.  Then  all servants of the Cross, who in life have conformed themselves  to the Crucified, shall draw nigh unto Christ the Judge with  great boldness.    2. Why fearest thou then to take up the cross which leadeth to a  kingdom?  In the Cross is health, in the Cross is life, in the  Cross is protection from enemies, in the Cross is heavenly  sweetness, in the Cross strength of mind, in the Cross joy of  the spirit, in the Cross the height of virtue, in the Cross  perfection of holiness.  There is no health of the soul, no hope  of eternal life, save in the Cross.  Take up therefore, thy cross  and follow Jesus and thou shalt go into eternal life.  He went  before thee bearing His Cross and died for thee upon the Cross,  that thou also mayest bear thy cross and mayest love to be  crucified upon it.  For if thou be dead with Him, thou shalt also  live with Him, and if thou be a partaker of His sufferings thou  shalt be also of His glory.    3. Behold everything dependeth upon the Cross, and everything  lieth in dying; and there is none other way unto life and to true  inward peace, except the way of the Holy Cross and of daily  mortification.  Go where thou wilt, seek whatsoever thou wilt,  and thou shalt find no higher way above nor safer way below, than  the way of the Holy Cross.  Dispose and order all things  according to thine own will and judgment, and thou shalt ever  find something to suffer either willingly or unwillingly, and  thus thou shalt ever find thy cross.  For thou shalt either feel  pain of body, or tribulation of spirit within thy soul.    4. Sometimes thou wilt be forsaken of God, sometimes thou wilt be  tried by thy neighbour, and which is more, thou wilt often be  wearisome to thyself.  And still thou canst not be delivered nor  eased by any remedy or consolation, but must bear so long as God  will.  For God will have thee learn to suffer tribulation without  consolation, and to submit thyself fully to it, and by  tribulation be made more humble.  No man understandeth the  Passion of Christ in his heart so well as he who hath had  somewhat of the like suffering himself.  The Cross therefore is  always ready, and every where waiteth for thee.  Thou canst not  flee from it whithersoever thou hurriest, for whithersoever thou  comest, thou bearest thyself with thee, and shalt ever find  thyself.  Turn thee above, turn thee below, turn thee without,  turn thee within, and in them all thou shalt find the Cross; and  needful is it that thou everywhere possess patience if thou wilt  have internal peace and gain the everlasting crown.    5. If thou willingly bear the Cross, it will bear thee, and will  bring thee to the end which thou seekest, even where there shall  be the end of suffering; though it shall not be here.  If thou  bear it unwillingly, thou makest a burden for thyself and greatly  increaseth thy load, and yet thou must bear it.  If thou cast  away one cross, without doubt thou shalt find another and  perchance a heavier.    6. Thinketh thou to escape what no mortal hath been able to  avoid?  Which of the saints in the world hath been without the  cross and tribulation?  For not even Jesus Christ our Lord was  one hour without the anguish of His Passion, so long as He lived.  It behooved, He said, Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead,  and so enter into his glory.(3)  And how dost thou seek another  way than this royal way, which is the way of the Holy Cross?    7. The whole life of Christ was a cross and martyrdom, and dost  thou seek for thyself rest and joy?  Thou art wrong, thou art  wrong, if thou seekest aught but to suffer tribulations, for this  whole mortal life is full of miseries, and set round with  crosses.  And the higher a man hath advanced in the spirit, the  heavier crosses he will often find, because the sorrow of his  banishment increaseth with the strength of his love.    8. But yet the man who is thus in so many wise afflicted, is not  without refreshment of consolation, because he feeleth abundant  fruit to be growing within him out of the bearing of his cross.  For whilst he willingly submitteth himself to it, every"]]]
