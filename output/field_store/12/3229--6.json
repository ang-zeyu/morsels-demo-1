If you  desire any further information on this subject, ask any liberal-minded  landed proprietor who takes an interest in the prosperity of his humble  neighbors to describe to you the small credit societies and similar  associations which have recently sprung up in his neighborhood. Nor is  it only in agricultural affairs that the peasants have manifested a  progressive spirit. If you should happen to pass through the industrial  districts around Moscow, you will see many gigantic factories, which  employ thousands of hands. Incredible as it may seem, not a few of these  were founded by unlettered peasants, whose sons and grandsons have  become millionaires.    Let us now go up a step in the social scale and inquire whether those  born in the mercantile class are as progressive as the peasantry.  Formerly they were regarded, and not without reason, as extremely  conservative, and certainly they used to show little sympathy with  education or culture; but in recent years their character has been  profoundly modified by the ever-increasing influx of foreign capital and  foreign enterprise. The upper ranks at least are now being Europeanized  in the best sense of the term, not only in their methods of doing  business, but also in many other respects. Their homes are becoming more  comfortable and elegant according to modern ideas, refinement is  gradually permeating their daily life, and the sons of not a few of them  are being sent abroad to complete their education in universities or  technical colleges.    Compared with the peasantry and the mercantile community, the clergy as  a class do not show signs of great progress, but I must do them the  justice to say that they do not obstruct. Toward science and culture the  Russian Church has always maintained an attitude of neutrality, and it  has rarely troubled the adherents of other confessions by aggressive  missionary propaganda, while among its own flock it has systematically  fostered a spirit of humility and resignation to the Divine will. This  helps to explain the wonderful tolerance habitually shown by all classes  toward people of another faith. I remember once asking a common laborer  what he thought of the Mussulman Tartars among whom he happened to be  living, and his reply, given with evident sincerity, was: \"Not a bad  sort of people.\" \"And what about their religion?\" I inquired. \"Not at  all a bad sort of faith; you see, they received it, like the color of  their skins, from God.\" He assumed, of course, in his simple piety, that  whatever comes from God must be good.    Why, then, it may be asked, is this tolerance not extended to the Jews?  They complain, and apparently not without reason, that they are subject  to certain disabilities and exposed to persecution in Russia. Thereby  hangs a tale! Peter the Great would not allow Jews to settle in his  dominions on the ground that his single-minded, ignorant subjects could  not compete with a naturally clever race endowed with a marvelous talent  for money-making. Under his successors, by the annexation of Poland,  several millions of Polish Jews became Russian subjects; but the policy  of exclusion, so far as Russia proper is concerned, has been maintained  down to the present day, so that, throughout the purely Russian  provinces, Jews are not yet allowed to settle in the villages. If you  ask the reason, you will probably be told that if a single Jew were  allowed to live in a village, all the Orthodox inhabitants would soon be  deeply in debt to him. In some respects, however, the old regulations  have been relaxed. A certain proportion of Jewish students are admitted  to the universities and higher schools, and such of them as pass their  examinations may settle in the towns and freely exercise their  professions. As a matter of fact, a considerable proportion of the most  capable barristers, physicians, bankers, &c., in Petrograd, Moscow, and  other cities are Jews by race and religion, and I have never heard of  any of them being persecuted. Anti-Semitic feeling, so far as it exists,  has nothing to do with religious beliefs. It is confined to such people  as the trader who suffers from the competition of Jewish rivals, or the  peasant who finds that the money-lender, from whom he has borrowed at a  high rate of interest, exacts rigorously the fulfillment of the  contract. The pillaging of Jewish shops and houses which occurred some  years ago in certain towns of the southwestern provinces and was  graphically described in the English press was due to pecuniary rather  than religious enmity, and was organized by political intriguers.    In order to complete my cursory review of the various social classes  from the point of view of social and political progress, I must say  something of the nobility and gentry; but I need not say much, because  their general character is pretty well known in Western Europe. They are  well educated, highly cultured, remarkably open-minded, most anxious to  acquaint themselves with the latest ideas in science, literature, and  art, and very fond of studying the most advanced foreign theories of  social and political development, with a view to applying them to their  own country. Thus it may safely be asserted that they are unquestionably  progressive. They are, in fact, more disposed to rush forward regardless  of consequences than to lag behind in the race, so that their impatience  has sometimes to be restrained in the sphere of politics by the  Government. This brings us face to face with the important question as  to how far the Government and the Supreme Ruler are favorable to  national progress and enlightenment.    The antiquated idea that Czars are always heartless tyrants who devote  much of their time to sending troublesome subjects to Siberia is now  happily pretty well exploded, but the average Englishman is still  reluctant to admit that an avowedly autocratic Government may be, in  certain circumstances, a useful institution. There is no doubt, however,  that in the gigantic work of raising Russia to her present level of  civilization the Czars have played a most important part. As for the  present Czar, he has followed, in a humane spirit, the best traditions  of his ancestors. Any one who has had opportunities of studying closely  his character and aims, and who knows the difficulties with which he has  had to contend, can hardly fail to regard him with sympathy and  admiration. Among the qualities which should commend him to Englishmen  are his scrupulous honesty and genuine truthfulness. Of these--were I  not restrained by fear of committing a breach of confidence--I might  give some interesting illustrations.    As a ruler Nicholas II. habitually takes a keen, sympathetic interest in  the material and moral progress of his country, and is ever ready to  listen attentively and patiently to those who are presumably competent  to offer sound advice on the subject. At the same time he is very  prudent in action, and this happy combination of zeal and caution, which  distinguishes him from his too impetuous countrymen, has been signally  displayed in recent years. During the revolutionary agitation which  followed close on the disastrous Japanese war, when the impetuous  would-be reformers wished to overturn the whole existing fabric of  administration, and the timid counselors recommended vigorous retrograde  measures, he wisely steered a middle course, which has resulted in the  creation of a moderate form of parliamentary institutions. That seems to  indicate that Nicholas II. has something of the typical Englishman's  love of compromise.    So much for the first of the two reasons commonly adduced to prove that  Russia is an undesirable ally. I trust I have said enough to show that  the idea of her being the great modern stronghold of barbarism,  ignorance, and tyrannical government is very far from the truth. Now I  come to the second reason--that she has repeatedly threatened our  interests in the past and is sure to threaten them in the future because  she has an insatiable territorial appetite.    That Russia has a formidable territorial appetite cannot be denied, but  it ill becomes us Britishers to reproach her on that score, because, if  we may judge by results, our own territorial appetite is at least  equally formidable. Like her, we began our national life with a very  modest amount of territory, and now the British Empire is considerably  larger than the Empire of the Czars. According to recent trustworthy  statistics, the former contains over 13,000,000 square miles, and the  latter less than 8,500,000. To this I may add that the motives and  methods of annexation have a strong family resemblance. Both of us have  been urged forward partly by rapidly increasing population and partly by  national ambition; and both of us have systematically added to our  dominions, partly by colonization and partly by conquest. As examples of  colonizing expansion we may take Siberia and Australia, and as examples  of expansion by conquest we may point to Russian Central Asia and  British India.    Fortunately for the peace of the world, the two spheres of expansion  long lay wide apart. The Russians, as a continental nation hemmed in by  no natural frontiers, naturally overflowed into adjacent thinly peopled  territory and spread out very much as a drop of oil spreads out on soft  paper; while we, being islanders with an adventurous seafaring  population, chose our fields of colonization and conquest in various  distant regions of the globe. Thus, until comparatively recent times, we  had no occasion to come into conflict with our rivals, or, to speak more  accurately, the two nations were not rivals at all. Now, it is true, we  have approached within striking distance of each other, and there is  some danger of our coming into hostile contact. Of this danger and the  possibility of averting it I shall"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18891"],[0,"Dot and the Kangaroo (#11)"],[1,"in pursuit, and Dot's Kangaroo,  with little Dot in her pouch, was leaping and bounding at a terrific  pace to save both their lives!          CHAPTER VIII      It was fortunate that the Kangaroo could not think of all that might  befall them, or she never could have had the courage for the wonderful  feats of jumping she performed. Poor little Dot, whose busy brain  pictured all kinds of terrible fates, was so overcome with fear that she  seemed hardly to know what had happened; and the more she thought, the  more terrified she became.    The Kangaroo did not attempt to continue the upward ascent, but followed  a slope of the rugged hill, leaping from rock to rock. This was better  than trying to escape where the trees and shrubs would have prevented  her making those astonishing bounds. But the clouds had left the moon  clear for a while, so that the Blackfellows and the dogs easily followed  every movement, as they pursued the hunt on a smoother level below. The  Blacks were trying to hurry on, so as to cut off the Kangaroo's retreat  at a spur of the hill, where, to get away, she would have to leave the  rocks and descend towards them. In the meantime Dot's ears were filled  with the sounds of snarling snaps from the dingo dogs, and hideous  noises from the Blacks, encouraging the animals to attack the Kangaroo.  But what pained her most were the gasps and little moans of her good  friend, as she put such tremendous power into every leap she made for  their lives; crashing through twigs, and scattering stones and pebbles,  in the wild speed of their flight.    Then Dot's busy little brain told her another thing, which made her more  miserable. It was becoming quite clear that the poor Kangaroo was  getting rapidly exhausted, owing to her having to bear Dot's weight. Her  panting became more and more distressing, and so did her sad moans; and  flecks of foam from her straining lips fell on Dot's face and hands. Dot  knew that her Kangaroo was trying to save her at the risk of her own  life. Without the little girl in her pouch, she might get away safely;  but, with her to carry, they would both probably fall victims to the  fierce Blacks and their dogs.    \"Kangaroo! Kangaroo!\" she cried, \"put me down; drop Dot anywhere,  anywhere, but don't get killed yourself!\"    But all Dot heard was a little hissing sound from the brave animal,  which sounded like, \"Never again!\"    \"You will be killed,\" moaned Dot.    \"Together!\" said the little hissing voice, as another great bound  brought them to the spur of the hill; and then the Kangaroo had to  pause.    In that moment Dot seemed to hear and see everything. They were perched  on a rock, and the moonlight lit all their surroundings like day. To the  right was a deep black chasm, with a white foaming waterfall pouring  into the darkness below. In front was the same wide chasm, only less  wide, and beyond it, on the other side of the great yawning cleft in the  earth, was a wild spread of morass country--a gloomy, terrible-looking  place. To the left was a steep slope of small rocks and stones, leading  downwards to the hollow of sedgy land that fringed the cliffs of the  chasm. The only retreat possible was to pass down this declivity, and  try to escape by the sedgy land, and this is what the Black huntsmen had  expected. It was a very weird and desolate place; and everything looked  dark and dismal, under the moonlight, as it streamed between stormy  black clouds. In that light Dot could see the Blacks hurrying forward.  Already one of the dogs had far outrun the others, and with wolfish gait  and savage sounds, was pressing towards their place of observation.    The panting, trembling Kangaroo saw the approaching dog, also, and  leaped down from the crag. As she dropped to earth, she stooped, and  quickly lifted Dot out of her pouch, and, almost before Dot could  realize the movement, she found herself standing alone, whilst the  Kangaroo hopped forward to the front of a big boulder, as if to meet the  dog. Here the poor hunted creature took her stand, with her back close  to the rock. Gentle and timid as she was, and unfitted by nature to  fight for her life against fierce odds, it was brave indeed of the poor  Kangaroo to face her enemies, prepared to do battle for the lives of  little Dot and herself.    So noble did Dot's Kangaroo look in that desperate moment, standing  erect, waiting for her foe, and conquering her naturally frightened  nature by a grand effort of courage, that it seemed impossible that  either dogs or men should be so cruel as to take her life. For a moment  the dingo hound seemed daunted by her bravery, and paused a little way  off, panting, with its great tongue lolling out of its mouth. Dot could  see its sharp wicked teeth gleaming in the moonlight. For a few seconds  it hesitated to make the attack, and looked back down the slope, to see  if the other dogs were coming to help; but they were only just beginning  the ascent, and the shouting Blackfellows were further off still. Then  the dog could no longer control its savage nature. It longed to leap at  the poor Kangaroo's throat--that pretty furry throat that Dot's arms had  so often encircled lovingly, and it was impatient to fix its terrible  teeth there, and hold, and hold, in a wild struggle, until the poor  Kangaroo should gradually weaken from fear and exhaustion, and be choked  to death. These thoughts filled the dog with a wicked joy. It wouldn't  wait any longer for the other dingo hounds. It wanted to murder the  Kangaroo all by itself; so, with a toss of its head, and a terrible  snarl, it sprang forward ferociously, with open jaws, aiming at the  victim's throat.    Dot clasped her cold hands together. Tears streamed down her cheeks, and  her little voice, choking with sobs, could only wail, \"Oh! dear  Kangaroo! my dear Kangaroo! Don't kill my dear Kangaroo!\" and she ran  forward to throw herself upon the dog and try to save her friend.    But before the terrified little girl could reach the big rock, the dog  had made its spring upon her friend. The brave Kangaroo, instead of  trying to avoid her fierce enemy, opened her little arms, and stood  erect and tall to receive the attack. The dog in its eagerness, and  owing to the nature of the ground, misjudged the distance it had to  spring. It failed to reach the throat it had aimed at, and in a moment  the Kangaroo had seized the hound in a tight embrace. There was a  momentary struggle, the dog snapping and trying to free itself, and the  Kangaroo holding it firmly. Then she used the only weapon she had to  defend herself from dogs and men,--the long sharp claw in her foot.  Whilst she held the dog in her arms, she raised her powerful leg, and  with that long, strong claw, tore open the dog's body. The dog yelped in  pain as the Kangaroo threw it to the ground, where it lay rolling in  agony and dying; for the Kangaroo had given it a terrible wound. The  other dogs were still some distance below, and the cries of their  companion caused them to pause in fear and wonder, while the Black men  could be seen advancing in the dim light, flourishing their spears and  boomerangs.    It was quite impossible to retreat that way; and where Dot and her  Kangaroo were, they were hemmed in by a rocky cliff and the deep black  chasm. The Kangaroo saw at a glance where lay their only chance of life.  She picked up Dot, placed her in her pouch, and without a word leaped  forward towards that fearful gulf of darkness and foaming waters. As  they neared the spot, Dot saw that the hunted animal was going to try  and leap across to the other side. It seemed impossible that with one  bound she could span that terrible place and reach the sedged morass  beyond; and still more impossible that it should be done by the poor  animal with heavy Dot in her pouch. Again Dot cried, \"Oh! darling  Kangaroo, leave me here, and save yourself. You can never, never do it  carrying me!\"    All she heard was something like \"try,\" or \"we'll die.\" She could not  make out what the Kangaroo said, for the crashing of the waterfall, the  whistling of the wind, and the scattering of stones as they dashed  forward, made such a storm of noises in her ears. She could see when  they reached the grassy fringe of the precipice, where the Kangaroo was  able to quicken her pace, and literally seemed to fly to their fate.  Then came the last bound before the great spring. Dot held her breath,  and a feeling of sickness came over her. Her head seemed giddy, and she  could not see, but she clasped her hands together and said, \"God help my  Kangaroo!\" and then she felt the fearful leap and rush through the air.    Yes! they had just reached the other side. No! they had not quite: what  was the matter? What a struggle! stones falling, twigs and grasses  wrenching, the courageous Kangaroo fighting for a foothold on the very  brink of the precipice. What a terrible moment! Every second Dot felt  sure they would fall backward and drop deep into the gully below, to be  dashed to pieces on the rocks and the tree tops. But God did help Dot's  Kangaroo; the little reeds and rushes held tightly in the earth, and the  poor struggling animal, exerting all her remaining strength, gained the  reedy slope safely. She staggered forward a few reeling hops, and then  fell to the earth like a dead creature. In an instant Dot was out of the  pouch and had her arm round the poor animal's neck, crying, as she saw  blood and foam oozing from her mouth, and a strange dim look in her sad  eyes. \"Don't die, dear Kangaroo! Oh, please don't die!\" cried Dot,  wringing her hands, and burying her face in the fur of the poor gasping  creature.    \"Dot,\" panted the Kangaroo, \"make a noise,--Cry loud!--not safe yet!\"    The little girl didn't understand why the Kangaroo wanted her to make a  noise, and she had, in her fear and sorrow, quite forgotten their  pursuers. But now she turned, and could hear"]]]
