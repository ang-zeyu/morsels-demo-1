In the Metamba country adjacent to the  Lualaba, a quarrel with a wife often ends in the husband killing her and  eating her heart, mixed up in a huge mess of goat's flesh: this has the  charm character. Fingers are taken as charms in other parts, but in  Bambarre alone is the depraved taste the motive for cannibalism.    _Bambarre, 18th August, 1870._--I learn from Josut and Moenepembe, who  have been to Katanga and beyond, that there is a Lake N.N.W. of the  copper mines, and twelve days distant; it is called Chibungo, and is  said to be large. Seven days west of Katanga flows another Lualaba,  the dividing line between Rua and Lunda or Londa; it is very large,  and as the Lufira flows into Chibungo, it is probable that the Lualaba  West and the Lufira form the Lake. Lualaba West and Lufira rise by  fountains south of Katanga, three or four days off. Luambai and Lunga  fountains are only about ten miles distant from Lualaba West and  Lufira fountains: a mound rises between them, the most remarkable in  Africa. Were this spot in Armenia it would serve exactly the  description of the garden of Eden in Genesis, with its four rivers,  the Gihon, Pison, Hiddekel, and Euphrates; as it is, it possibly gave  occasion to the story told to Herodotus by the Secretary of Minerva in  the City of Sais, about two hills with conical tops, Crophi and Mophi.  \"Midway between them,\" said he, \"are the fountains of the Nile,  fountains which it is impossible to fathom: half the water runs  northward into Egypt; half to the south towards Ethiopia.\"    Four fountains rising so near to each other would readily be supposed to  have one source, and half the water flowing into the Nile and the other  half to the Zambesi, required but little imagination to originate,  seeing the actual visitor would not feel bound to say how the division  was effected. He could only know the fact of waters rising at one spot,  and separating to flow north and south. The conical tops to the mound  look like invention, as also do the names.    A slave, bought on Lualaba East, came from Lualaba West in about twelve  days: these two Lualabas may form the loop depicted by Ptolemy, and  upper and lower Tanganyika be a third arm of the Nile.    Patience is all I can exercise: these irritable ulcers hedge me in now,  as did my attendants in June, but all will be for the best, for it is in  Providence and not in me.    The watershed is between 700 and 800 miles long from west to east, or  say from 22 deg. or 23 deg. to 34 deg. or 35 deg. East longitude. Parts of it are  enormous sponges; in other parts innumerable rills unite into rivulets,  which again form rivers--Lufira, for instance, has nine rivulets, and  Lekulwe other nine. The convex surface of the rose of a garden  watering-can is a tolerably apt similitude, as the rills do not spring  off the face of it, and it is 700 miles across the circle; but in the  numbers of rills coming out at different heights on the slope, there is  a faint resemblance, and I can at present think of no other example.    I am a little thankful to old Nile for so hiding his head that all  \"theoretical discoverers\" are left out in the cold. With all real  explorers I have a hearty sympathy, and I have some regret at being  obliged, in a manner compelled, to speak somewhat disparagingly of the  opinions formed by my predecessors. The work of Speke and Grant is part  of the history of this region, and since the discovery of the sources  of the Nile was asserted so positively, it seems necessary to explain,  not offensively, I hope, wherein their mistake lay, in making a somewhat  similar claim. My opinions may yet be shown to be mistaken too, but at  present I cannot conceive how. When Speke discovered Victoria Nyanza in  1858, he at once concluded that therein lay the sources of the Nile. His  work after that was simply following a foregone conclusion, and as soon  as he and Grant looked towards the Victoria Nyanza, they turned their  backs on the Nile fountains; so every step of their splendid achievement  of following the river down took them further and further away from the  Caput Nili. When it was perceived that the little river that leaves the  Nyanza, though they called it the White Nile, would not account for that  great river, they might have gone west and found headwaters (as the  Lualaba) to which it can bear no comparison. Taking their White Nile at  80 or 90 yards, or say 100 yards broad, the Lualaba, far south of the  latitude of its point of departure, shows an average breadth of from  4000 to 6000 yards, and always deep.    Considering that more than sixteen hundred years have elapsed since  Ptolemy put down the results of early explorers, and emperors, kings,  philosophers--all the great men of antiquity in short longed to know the  fountains whence flowed the famous river, and longed in  vain--exploration does not seem to have been very becoming to the other  sex either. Madame Tinne came further up the river than the centurions  sent by Nero Caesar, and showed such indomitable pluck as to reflect  honour on her race. I know nothing about her save what has appeared in  the public papers, but taking her exploration along with what was done  by Mrs. Baker, no long time could have elapsed before the laurels for  the modern re-discovery of the sources of the Nile should have been  plucked by the ladies. In 1841 the Egyptian Expedition under D'Arnauld  and Sabatier reached lat. 4 deg. 42': this was a great advance into the  interior as compared with Linant in 1827, 13 deg. 30' N., and even on the  explorations of Jomard(?); but it turned when nearly a thousand miles  from the sources.    [The subjoined account of the soko--which is in all probability an  entirely new species of chimpanzee, and _not_ the gorilla, is  exceedingly interesting, and no doubt Livingstone had plenty of stories  from which to select. Neither Susi nor Chuma can identify the soko of  Manyuema with the gorilla, as we have it stuffed in the British Museum.  They think, however, that the soko is quite as large and as strong as  the gorilla, judging by the specimens shown to them, although they could  have decided with greater certainty, if the natives had not invariably  brought in the dead sokos disembowelled; as they point out, and as we  imagine from Dr. Livingstone's description, the carcase would then  appear much less bulky. Livingstone gives an animated sketch of a soko  hunt.]    _24th August, 1870._--Four gorillas or sokos were killed yesterday: an  extensive grass-burning forced them out of their usual haunt, and coming  on the plain they were speared. They often go erect, but place the hand  on the head, as if to steady the body. When seen thus, the soko is an  ungainly beast. The most sentimental young lady would not call him a  \"dear,\" but a bandy-legged, pot-bellied, low-looking villain, without a  particle of the gentleman in him. Other animals, especially the  antelopes, are graceful, and it is pleasant to see them, either at rest  or in motion: the natives also are well made, lithe and comely to  behold, but the soko, if large, would do well to stand for a picture of  the Devil.    He takes away my appetite by his disgusting bestiality of appearance.  His light-yellow face shows off his ugly whiskers, and faint apology for  a beard; the forehead villainously low, with high ears, is well in the  back-ground of the great dog-mouth; the teeth are slightly human, but  the canines show the beast by their large development. The hands, or  rather the fingers, are like those of the natives. The flesh of the feet  is yellow, and the eagerness with which the Manyuema devour it leaves  the impression that eating sokos was the first stage by which they  arrived at being cannibals; they say the flesh is delicious. The soko is  represented by some to be extremely knowing, successfully stalking men  and women while at their work, kidnapping children, and running up trees  with them--he seems to be amused by the sight of the young native in his  arms, but comes down when tempted by a bunch of bananas, and as he lifts  that, drops the child: the young soko in such a case would cling closely  to the armpit of the elder. One man was cutting out honey from a tree,  and naked, when a soko suddenly appeared and caught him, then let him  go: another man was hunting, and missed in his attempt to stab a soko:  it seized the spear and broke it, then grappled with the man, who called  to his companions, \"Soko has caught me,\" the soko bit off the ends of  his fingers and escaped unharmed. Both men are now alive at Bambarre.    The soko is so cunning, and has such sharp eyes, that no one can stalk  him in front without being seen, hence, when shot, it is always in the  back; when surrounded by men and nets, he is generally speared in the  back too, otherwise he is not a very formidable beast: he is nothing, as  compared in power of damaging his assailant, to a leopard or lion, but  is more like a man unarmed, for it does not occur to him to use his  canine teeth, which are long and formidable. Numbers of them come down  in the forest, within a hundred yards of our camp, and would be unknown  but for giving tongue like fox-hounds: this is their nearest approach to  speech. A man hoeing was stalked by a soko, and seized; he roared out,  but the soko giggled and grinned, and left him as if he had done it in  play. A child caught up by a soko is often abused by being pinched and  scratched, and let fall.    The soko kills the leopard occasionally, by seizing both paws, and  biting them so as to disable them, he then goes up a tree, groans over  his wounds, and sometimes recovers, while the leopard dies: at other  times, both soko and leopard die. The lion kills him at once, and  sometimes tears his limbs off, but does not eat him.

It had but five chambers, but the barrel was ten inches long;  one had to cap it, and to put in the powder and the wadded bullet  separately; but the last-named would have killed an elephant. The oak  case that I bought with it cumbers my desk as I write, and, shut,  you would think that it had never contained anything more lethal than  fruit-knives. I open it, and there are the green-baize compartments, one  with a box of percussion caps, still apparently full, another that could  not contain many more wadded-bullets, and a third with a powder-horn  which can never have been much lighter. Within the lid is a label  bearing the makers' names; the gentlemen themselves are unknown to me,  even if they are still alive; nevertheless, after five-and-forty years,  let me dip my pen to Messrs. Deane, Adams and Deane!    That night I left this case in my room, locked, and the key in my  waistcoat pocket; in the right-hand side-pocket of my overcoat I carried  my Deane and Adams, loaded in every chamber; also my right hand, as  innocently as you could wish. And just that night I was not followed! I  walked across Regent's Park, and I dawdled on Primrose Hill, without  the least result. Down I turned into the Avenue Road, and presently was  strolling between green fields towards Finchley. The moon was up, but  nicely shaded by a thin coating of clouds which extended across the sky:  it was an ideal night for it. It was also my last night in town, and I  did want to give the beggars their last chance. But they did not even  attempt to avail themselves of it: never once did they follow me: my  ears were in too good training to make any mistake. And the reason only  dawned on me as I drove back disappointed: they had followed me already  to the gunsmith's!    Convinced of this, I entertained but little hope of another midnight  visitor. Nevertheless, I put my light out early, and sat a long time  peeping through my blind; but only an inevitable Tom, with back hunched  up and tail erect, broke the moonlit profile of the back-garden wall;  and once more that disreputable music (which none the less had saved my  life) was the only near sound all night.    I felt very reluctant to pack Deane and Adams away in his case next  morning, and the case in my portmanteau, where I could not get at it in  case my unknown friends took it into their heads to accompany me out of  town. In the hope that they would, I kept him loaded, and in the same  overcoat pocket, until late in the afternoon, when, being very near my  northern destination, and having the compartment to myself, I locked the  toy away with considerable remorse for the price I had paid for it. All  down the line I had kept an eye for suspicious characters with an eye  upon me; but even my self-consciousness failed to discover one; and I  reached my haven of peace, and of fresh fell air, feeling, I suppose,  much like any other fool who has spent his money upon a white elephant.          CHAPTER IX. MY CONVALESCENT HOME      The man Braithwaite met me at the station with a spring cart. The very  porters seemed to expect me, and my luggage was in the cart before I  had given up my ticket. Nor had we started when I first noticed that  Braithwaite did not speak when I spoke to him. On the way, however, a  more flagrant instance recalled young Rattray's remark, that the man was  \"not like other people.\" I had imagined it to refer to a mental, not  a physical, defect; whereas it was clear to me now that my prospective  landlord was stone-deaf, and I presently discovered him to be dumb as  well. Thereafter I studied him with some attention during our drive of  four or five miles. I called to mind the theory that an innate physical  deficiency is seldom without its moral counterpart, and I wondered how  far this would apply to the deaf-mute at my side, who was ill-grown,  wizened, and puny into the bargain. The brow-beaten face of him was  certainly forbidding, and he thrashed his horse up the hills in a  dogged, vindictive, thorough-going way which at length made me jump  out and climb one of them on foot. It was the only form of protest that  occurred to me.    The evening was damp and thick. It melted into night as we drove.  I could form no impression of the country, but this seemed desolate  enough. I believe we met no living soul on the high road which we  followed for the first three miles or more. At length we turned into a  narrow lane, with a stiff stone wall on either hand, and this eventually  led us past the lights of what appeared to be a large farm; it was  really a small hamlet; and now we were nearing our destination. Gates  had to be opened, and my poor driver breathed hard from the continual  getting down and up. In the end a long and heavy cart-track brought us  to the loneliest light that I have ever seen. It shone on the side of a  hill--in the heart of an open wilderness--as solitary as a beacon-light  at sea. It was the light of the cottage which was to be my temporary  home.    A very tall, gaunt woman stood in the doorway against the inner glow.  She advanced with a loose, long stride, and invited me to enter in a  voice harsh (I took it) from disuse. I was warming myself before the  kitchen fire when she came in carrying my heaviest box as though it had  nothing in it. I ran to take it from her, for the box was full of books,  but she shook her head, and was on the stairs with it before I could  intercept her.    I conceive that very few men are attracted by abnormal strength in a  woman; we cannot help it; and yet it was not her strength which first  repelled me in Mrs. Braithwaite. It was a combination of attributes. She  had a poll of very dirty and untidy red hair; her eyes were set close  together; she had the jowl of the traditional prize-fighter. But far  more disagreeable than any single feature was the woman's expression,  or rather the expression which I caught her assuming naturally, and  banishing with an effort for my benefit. To me she was strenuously  civil in her uncouth way. But I saw her give her husband one look, as  he staggered in with my comparatively light portmanteau, which she  instantly snatched out of his feeble arms. I saw this look again before  the evening was out, and it was such a one as Braithwaite himself had  fixed upon his horse as he flogged it up the hills.    I began to wonder how the young squire had found it in his conscience to  recommend such a pair. I wondered less when the woman finally ushered  me upstairs to my rooms. These were small and rugged, but eminently snug  and clean. In each a good fire blazed cheerfully; my portmanteau was  already unstrapped, the table in the sitting-room already laid; and I  could not help looking twice at the silver and the glass, so bright was  their condition, so good their quality. Mrs. Braithwaite watched me from  the door.    \"I doubt you'll be thinking them's our own,\" said she. \"I wish they  were; t'squire sent 'em in this afternoon.\"    \"For my use?\"    \"Ay; I doubt he thought what we had ourselves wasn't good enough. An'  it's him 'at sent t' armchair, t'bed-linen, t'bath, an' that there  lookin'-glass an' all.\"    She had followed me into the bedroom, where I looked with redoubled  interest at each object as she mentioned it, and it was in the glass--a  masqueline shaving-glass--that I caught my second glimpse of my  landlady's evil expression--levelled this time at myself.    I instantly turned round and told her that I thought it very kind of Mr.  Rattray, but that, for my part, I was not a luxurious man, and that I  felt rather sorry the matter had not been left entirely in her hands.  She retired seemingly mollified, and she took my sympathy with her,  though I was none the less pleased and cheered by my new friend's zeal  for my comfort; there were even flowers on my table, without a doubt  from Kirby Hall.    And in another matter the squire had not misled me: the woman was an  excellent plain cook. I expected ham and eggs. Sure enough, this was my  dish, but done to a turn. The eggs were new and all unbroken, the ham  so lean and yet so tender, that I would not have exchanged my humble,  hearty meal for the best dinner served that night in London. It made a  new man of me, after my long journey and my cold, damp drive. I was for  chatting with Mrs. Braithwaite when she came up to clear away. I  thought she might be glad to talk after the life she must lead with her  afflicted husband, but it seemed to have had the opposite effect on her.  All I elicited was an ambiguous statement as to the distance between the  cottage and the hall; it was \"not so far.\" And so she left me to my pipe  and to my best night yet, in the stillest spot I have ever slept in  on dry land; one heard nothing but the bubble of a beck; and it seemed  very, very far away.    A fine, bright morning showed me my new surroundings in their true  colors; even in the sunshine these were not very gay. But gayety was the  last thing I wanted. Peace and quiet were my whole desire, and both were  here, set in scenery at once lovely to the eye and bracing to the soul.    From the cottage doorstep one looked upon a perfect panorama of  healthy, open English country. Purple hills hemmed in a broad, green,  undulating plateau, scored across and across by the stone walls of the  north, and all dappled with the shadows of rolling leaden clouds with  silver fringes. Miles away a church spire stuck like a spike out of the  hollow, and the smoke of a village dimmed the trees behind. No nearer  habitation could I see. I have mentioned a hamlet which we passed in the  spring-cart. It lay hidden behind some hillocks to the left. My landlady  told me it was better than half a mile away, and \"nothing when you get  there; no shop; no post-office; not even a public--house.\"    I inquired in which direction lay the hall. She pointed to the nearest  trees, a small forest "]]]
