Saint-Saens  remarks, to the polyphony which had governed music since Bach's day, and  which is perhaps, after all, \"a heresy destined to disappear.\"[90]    [Footnote 89: _Ibid_. \"A rare peculiarity,\" adds Schumann, \"which  distinguishes nearly all his melodies.\" Schumann understands why Berlioz  often gives as an accompaniment to his melodies a simple bass, or chords  of the augmented and diminished fifth--ignoring the intermediate parts.]    [Footnote 90: \"What will then remain of actual art? Perhaps Berlioz will  be its sole representative. Not having studied the pianoforte, he had an  instinctive aversion to counterpoint. He is in this respect the opposite  of Wagner, who was the embodiment of counterpoint, and drew the utmost  he could from its laws\" (Saint-Saens).]    How much finer, to my idea, are Berlioz's recitatives, with their long  and winding rhythms,[91] than Wagner's declamations, which--apart from  the climax of a subject, where the air breaks into bold and vigorous  phrases, whose influence elsewhere is often weak--limit themselves to  the quasi-notation of spoken inflections, and jar noisily against the  fine harmonies of the orchestra. Berlioz's orchestration, too, is of a  more delicate temper, and has a freer life than Wagner's, flowing in an  impetuous stream, and sweeping away everything in its course; it is also  less united and solid, but more flexible; its nature is undulating and  varied, and the thousand imperceptible impulses of the spirit and of  action are reflected there. It is a marvel of spontaneity and caprice.    [Footnote 91: Jacques Passy notes that with Berlioz the most frequent  phrases consist of twelve, sixteen, eighteen, or twenty bars. With  Wagner, phrases of eight bars are rare, those of four more common, those  of two still more so, while those of one bar are most frequent of all  (_Berlioz et Wagner_, article published in _Le Correspondant_, 10 June,  1888).]    In spite of appearances, Wagner is a classicist compared with Berlioz;  he carried on and perfected the work of the German classicists; he made  no innovations; he is the pinnacle and the close of one evolution of  art. Berlioz began a new art; and one finds in it all the daring and  gracious ardour of youth. The iron laws that bound the art of Wagner are  not to be found in Berlioz's early works, which give one the illusion of  perfect freedom.[92]        [Footnote 92: One must make mention here of the poorness and awkwardness  of Berlioz's harmony--which is incontestable--since some critics and  composers have been able to see (Am I saying something  ridiculous?--Wagner would say it for me) nothing but \"faults of  orthography\" in his genius. To these terrible grammarians--who, two  hundred years ago, criticised Moliere on account of his \"jargon\"--I  shall reply by quoting Schumann.         \"Berlioz's harmonies, in spite of the diversity of their effect,       obtained from very scanty material, are distinguished by a sort of       simplicity, and even by a solidity and conciseness, which one only       meets with in Beethoven.... One may find here and there harmonies       that are commonplace and trivial, and others that are incorrect--at       least according to the old rules. In some places his harmonies have       a fine effect, and in others their result is vague and       indeterminate, or it sounds badly, or is too elaborate and       far-fetched. Yet with Berlioz all this somehow takes on a certain       distinction. If one attempted to correct it, or even slightly to       modify it--for a skilled musician it would be child's play--the       music would become dull\" (Article on the _Symphonie fantastique_).    But let us leave that \"grammatical discussion\" as well as what Wagner  wrote on \"the childish question as to whether it is permitted or not to  introduce 'neologisms' in matters of harmony and melody\" (Wagner to  Berlioz, 22 February, 1860). As Schumann has said, \"Look out for fifths,  and then leave us in peace.\"]    As soon as the profound originality of Berlioz's music has been grasped,  one understands why it encountered, and still encounters, so much secret  hostility. How many accomplished musicians of distinction and learning,  who pay honour to artistic tradition, are incapable of understanding  Berlioz because they cannot bear the air of liberty breathed by his  music. They are so used to thinking in German, that Berlioz's speech  upsets and shocks them. I can well believe it. It is the first time a  French musician has dared to think in French; and that is the reason why  I warned you of the danger of accepting too meekly German ideas about  Berlioz. Men like Weingartner, Richard Strauss, and Mottl--thoroughbred  musicians--are, without doubt, able to appreciate Berlioz's genius  better and more quickly than we French musicians. But I rather mistrust  the kind of appreciation they feel for a spirit so opposed to their own.  It is for France and French people to learn to read his thoughts; they  are intimately theirs, and one day will give them their salvation.           *       *       *       *       *    Berlioz's other great originality lay in his talent for music that was  suited to the spirit of the common people, recently raised to  sovereignty, and the young democracy. In spite of his aristocratic  disdain, his soul was with the masses. M. Hippeau applies to him Taine's  definition of a romantic artist: \"the plebeian of a new race, richly  gifted, and filled with aspirations, who, having attained for the first  time the world's heights, noisily displays the ferment of his mind and  heart.\" Berlioz grew up in the midst of revolutions and stories of  Imperial achievement. He wrote his cantata for the _Prix de Rome_ in  July, 1830, \"to the hard, dull noise of stray bullets, which whizzed  above the roofs, and came to flatten themselves against the wall near  his window.\"[93] When he had finished this cantata, he went, \"pistol in  hand, to play the blackguard in Paris with the _sainte canaille_.\" He  sang the _Marseillaise_, and made \"all who had a voice and heart and  blood in their veins\"[94] sing it too. On his journey to Italy he  travelled from Marseilles to Livourne with Mazzinian conspirators, who  were going to take part in the insurrection of Modena and Bologna.  Whether he was conscious of it or not, he was the musician of  revolutions; his sympathies were with the people.    [Footnote 93: _Memoires_, I, 155.]    [Footnote 94: These words are taken from Berlioz's directions on the  score of his arrangement of the _Marseillaise_ for full orchestra and  double choir.] Not only did he fill his scenes in the theatre with  swarming and riotous crowds, like those of the Roman Carnival in the  second act of _Benvenuto_ (anticipating by thirty years the crowds of  _Die Meistersinger_), but he created a music of the masses and a  colossal style. His model here was Beethoven; Beethoven of the Eroica,  of the C minor, of the A, and, above all, of the Ninth Symphony. He was  Beethoven's follower in this as well as other things, and the apostle  who carried on his work.[95] And with his understanding of material  effects and sonorous matter, he built edifices, as he says, that were  \"Babylonian and Ninevitish,\"[96] \"music after Michelangelo,\"[97] \"on an  immense scale.\"[98]    [Footnote 95: \"From Beethoven,\" says Berlioz, \"dates the advent in art  of colossal forms\" (_Memoires_, II, 112). But Berlioz forgot one of  Beethoven's models--Haendel. One must also take into account the  musicians of the French revolution: Mehul, Gossec, Cherubini, and  Lesueur, whose works, though they may not equal their intentions, are  not without grandeur, and often disclose the intuition of a new and  noble and popular art.]    [Footnote 96: Letter to Morel, 1855. Berlioz thus describes the  _Tibiomnes_ and the _Judex_ of his _Te Deum_. Compare Heine's judgment:  \"Berlioz's music makes me think of gigantic kinds of extinct animals, of  fabulous empires.... Babylon, the hanging gardens of Semiramis, the  wonders of Nineveh, the daring buildings of Mizraim.\"]    [Footnote 97: _Memoires_, I, 17.]    [Footnote 98: Letter to an unknown person, written probably about 1855,  in the collection of Siegfried Ochs, and published in the _Geschichte  der franzoesischen Musik_ of Alfred Bruneau, 1904. That letter contains a  rather curious analytical catalogue of Berlioz's works, drawn up by  himself. He notes there his predilection for compositions of a \"colossal  nature,\" such as the _Requiem_, the _Symphonie funebre et triomphale_,  and the _Te Deum_, or those of \"an immense style,\" such as the  _Imperiale_.]    It was the _Symphonie funebre et triomphale_ for two orchestras and a  choir, and the _Te Deum_ for orchestra, organ, and three choirs, which  Berlioz loved (whose finale _Judex crederis_ seemed to him the most  effective thing he had ever written[99]), as well as the _Imperiale_,  for two orchestras and two choirs, and the famous _Requiem_, with its  \"four orchestras of brass instruments, placed round the main orchestra  and the mass of voices, but separated and answering one another at a  distance.\" Like the _Requiem_, these compositions are often crude in  style and of rather commonplace sentiment, but their grandeur is  overwhelming. This is not due only to the hugeness of the means  employed, but also to \"the breadth of the style and to the formidable  slowness of some of the progressions--whose final aim one cannot  guess--which gives these compositions a strangely gigantic  character.\"[100] Berlioz has left in these compositions striking  examples of the beauty that may reveal itself in a crude mass of music.  Like the towering Alps, they move one by their very immensity.

Few poets have been subjected to more various turns of fortune, than  the gentleman whose memoirs we are now about to relate. He was amongst  the first who refined our poetry, and did more for the interest of the  drama, than any who ever wrote for the stage. He lived in times of  general confusion, and was no unactive member of the state, when its  necessities demanded his assistance; and when, with the restoration,  politeness and genius began to revive, he applied himself to the  promotion of these rational pleasures, which are fit to entertain a  cultivated people. This great man was son of one Mr. John Davenant, a  citizen of Oxford, and was born in the month of February, 1605; all  the biographers of our poet have observed, that his father was a man  of a grave disposition, and a gloomy turn of mind, which his son did  not inherit from him, for he was as remarkably volatile, as his father  was saturnine. The same biographers have celebrated our author's  mother as very handsome, whose charms had the power of attracting the  admiration of Shakespear, the highest compliment which ever was paid  to beauty. As Mr. Davenant, our poet's father, kept a tavern,  Shakespear, in his journies to Warwickshire, spent some time there,  influenced, as many believe, by the engaging qualities of the handsome  landlady. This circumstance has given rise to a conjecture, that  Davenant was really the son of Shakespear, as well naturally as  poetically, by an unlawful intrigue, between his mother and that great  man; that this allegation is founded upon probability, no reader can  believe, for we have such accounts of the amiable temper, and moral  qualities of Shakespear, that we cannot suppose him to have been  guilty of such an act of treachery, as violating the marriage honours;  and however he might have been delighted with the conversation, or  charmed with the person of Mrs. Davenant, yet as adultery was not then  the fashionable vice, it would be injurious to his memory, so much as  to suppose him guilty.    Our author received the first rudiments of polite learning from Mr.  Edward Sylvester, who kept a grammar school in the parish of All  Saints in Oxford. In the year 1624, the same in which his father was  Mayor of the city, he was entered a member of the university of  Oxford, in Lincoln's-Inn College, under the tuition of Mr. Daniel  Hough, but the Oxford antiquary is of opinion, he did not long remain  there, as his mind was too much addicted to gaiety, to bear the  austerities of an academical life, and being encouraged by some  gentlemen, who admired the vivacity of his genius, he repaired to  court, in hopes of making his fortune in that pleasing, but dangerous  element. He became first page to Frances, duchess of Richmond, a lady  much celebrated in those days, as well for her beauty, as the  influence she had at court, and her extraordinary taste for grandeur,  which excited her to keep a kind of private court of her own, which,  in our more fashionable aera, is known by the name of Drums, Routs, and  Hurricanes. Sir William afterwards removed into the family of Sir Fulk  Greville, lord Brooke, who being himself a man of taste and erudition,  gave the most encouraging marks of esteem to our rising bard. This  worthy nobleman being brought to an immature fate, by the cruel hands  of an assassin, 1628, Davenant was left without a patron, though not  in very indigent circumstances, his reputation having increased,  during the time he was in his lordship's service: the year ensuing the  death of his patron, he produced his first play to the world, called  Albovino, King of the Lombards, which met with a very general, and  warm reception, and to which some very honourable recommendations were  prefixed, when it was printed, in several copies of verses, by men of  eminence, amongst whom, were, Sir Henry Blount, Edward Hyde,  afterwards earl of Clarendon, and the honourable Henry Howard. Our  author spent the next eight years of his life in a constant attendance  upon court, where he was highly caressed by the most shining  characters of the times, particularly by the earl of Dorset, Edward  Hyde, and Lord Treasurer Weston: during these gay moments, spent in  the court amusements, an unlucky accident happened to our author,  which not a little deformed his face, which, from nature, was very  handsome. Wood has affirmed, that this accident arose from libidinous  dalliance with a handsome black girl in Axe-yard, Westminster. The  plain fact is this, Davenant was of an amorous complexion, and was so  unlucky as to carry the marks of his regular gallantries in the  depression of his nose; this exposed him to the pleasant raillery of  cotemporary wits, which very little affected him, and to shew that he  was undisturbed by their merriment, he wrote a burlesque copy of  verses upon himself. This accident happened pretty early in his life,  since it gave occasion to the following stanzas in Sir John Suckling's  Sessions of the Poets, which we have transcribed from a correct copy  of Suckling's works.      Will Davenant ashamed of a foolish mischance,    That he had got lately travelling in France,    Modestly hop'd the handsomness of his muse,    Might any deformity about him excuse.      Surely the company had been content,    If they cou'd have found any precedent,    But in all their records in verse, or prose,    There was none of a laureat, who wanted a nose.    Suckling here differs from the Oxford historian, in saying that Sir  William's disorder was contracted in France, but as Wood is the  highest authority, it is more reasonable to embrace his observation,  and probably, Suckling only mentioned France, in order that it might  rhime with mischance.    Some time after this, Davenant was rallied by another hand, on account  of this accident, as if it had been a jest that could never die; but  what is more extraordinary, is, that Sir William himself could not  forget the authoress of this misfortune, but has introduced her in his  Gondibert, and, in the opinion of some critics, very improperly. He  brings two friends, Ulfinore the elder, and Goltho the younger, on a  journey to the court of Gondibert, but in this passage to shew, as he  would insinuate the extream frailty of youth, they were arrested by a  very unexpected accident, notwithstanding the wife councils, which  Ulfinore had just received from his father[1]. The lines which have an  immediate reference to this fair enchantress, are too curious to be  here omitted.                                      I.      The black-ey'd beauty did her pride display,    Thro' a large window, and in jewels shone,    As if to please the world, weeping for day,    Night had put all her starry jewels on.

This, beauty gaz'd on both, and Ulfinore    Hung down his head, but yet did lift his eyes    As if he fain would see a little more,    For much, tho' bashful, he did beauty prize.
