[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19142"],[0,"The Devil Doctor (#11)"],[1,"a loud  and dreadful cry uttered with all the strength of Slattin's lungs.    \"Oh, God!\" he cried, and again--\"Oh, God!\"    This in turn merged into a sort of hysterical sobbing.    I was on my feet now, and automatically making for the door. I had a  vague impression of Nayland Smith's face beside me, the eyes glassy  with a fearful apprehension. Then the door was flung open, and, in the  bright light of the hall-way, I saw Slattin standing--swaying and  seemingly fighting with the empty air.    \"What is it? For God's sake, what has happened?\" reached my ears  dimly--and the man Burke showed behind his master. White-faced I saw  him to be; for now Smith and I were racing up the steps.    Ere we could reach him, Slattin, uttering another choking cry, pitched  forward and lay half across the threshold.    We burst into the hall, where Burke stood with both his hands raised  dazedly to his head. I could hear the sound of running feet upon the  gravel, and knew that Carter was coming to join us.    Burke, a heavy man with a lowering, bull-dog type of face, collapsed  on to his knees beside Slattin, and began softly to laugh in little  rising peals.    \"Drop that!\" snapped Smith, and grasping him by the shoulders, he sent  him spinning along the hall-way, where he sank upon the bottom step of  the stairs, to sit with his outstretched fingers extended before his  face, and peering at us grotesquely through the crevices.    There were rustlings and subdued cries from the upper part of the  house. Carter came in out of the darkness, carefully stepping over the  recumbent figure; and the three of us stood there in the lighted hall  looking down at Slattin.    \"Help me to move him back,\" directed Smith tensely; \"far enough to  close the door.\"    Between us we accomplished this, and Carter fastened the door. We were  alone with the shadow of Fu-Manchu's vengeance; for as I knelt beside  the body on the floor, a look and a touch sufficed to tell me that  this was but clay from which the spirit had fled!    Smith met my glance as I raised my head, and his teeth came together  with a loud snap; the jaw muscles stood out prominently beneath the  dark skin; and his face was grimly set in that old, half-despairful  expression which I knew so well but which boded so ill for whomsoever  occasioned it.    \"Dead, Petrie--already?\"    \"Lightning could have done the work no better. Can I turn him over?\"    Smith nodded.    Together we stooped and rolled the heavy body on its back. A flood of  whispers came sibilantly from the stairway. Smith spun around rapidly,  and glared upon the group of half-dressed servants.    \"Return to your rooms!\" he rapped imperiously: \"let no one come into  the hall without my orders.\"    The masterful voice had its usual result; there was a hurried retreat  to the upper landing. Burke, shaking like a man with an ague, sat on  the lower step, pathetically drumming his palms upon his uplifted  knees.    \"I warned him, I warned him!\" he mumbled monotonously, \"I warned him,  oh, I warned him!\"    \"Stand up!\" shouted Smith, \"stand up and come here!\"    The man, with his frightened eyes turning to right and left, and  seeming to search for something in the shadows about him, advanced  obediently.    \"Have you a flask?\" demanded Smith of Carter.    The detective silently administered to Burke a stiff restorative.    \"Now,\" continued Smith, \"you, Petrie, will want to examine him, I  suppose?\" He pointed to the body. \"And in the meantime I have some  questions to put to you, my man.\"    He clapped his hand upon Burke's shoulder.    \"My God!\" Burke broke out, \"I was ten yards from him when it  happened!\"    \"No one is accusing you,\" said Smith less harshly; \"but since you were  the only witness, it is by your aid that we hope to clear the matter  up.\"    Exerting a gigantic effort to regain control of himself, Burke nodded,  watching my friend with a childlike eagerness. During the ensuing  conversation, I examined Slattin for marks of violence; and of what I  found, more anon.    \"In the first place,\" said Smith, \"you say that you warned him. When  did you warn him, and of what?\"    \"I warned him, sir, that it would come to this--\"    \"That _what_ would come to this?\"    \"His dealings with the Chinamen!\"    \"He had dealings with Chinamen?\"    \"He accidentally met a Chinaman at an East End gaming-house, a man he  had known in 'Frisco--a man called Singapore Charlie--\"    \"What! Singapore Charlie!\"    \"Yes, sir, the same man that had a dope-shop, two years ago, down  Ratcliffe way--\"    \"There was a fire--\"    \"But Singapore Charlie escaped, sir.\"    \"And he is one of the gang?\"    \"He is one of what we used to call, in New York, the Seven Group.\"    Smith began to tug at the lobe of his left ear, reflectively, as I saw  out of the corner of my eye.    \"The Seven Group!\" he mused. \"That is significant. I always suspected  that Dr. Fu-Manchu and the notorious Seven Group were one and the  same. Go on, Burke.\"    \"Well, sir,\" the man continued more calmly, \"the lieutenant--\"    \"The lieutenant!\" began Smith; then: \"Oh! of course; Slattin used to  be a police lieutenant!\"    \"Well, sir, he--Mr. Slattin--had a sort of hold on this Singapore  Charlie, and two years ago, when he first met him, he thought that  with his aid he was going to pull off the biggest thing of his life--\"    \"Forestall _me_, in fact?\"    \"Yes, sir; but you got in first with the big raid--and spoiled it.\"    Smith nodded grimly, glancing at the Scotland Yard man, who returned  his nod with equal grimness.    \"A couple of months ago,\" resumed Burke, \"he met Charlie again down  East, and the Chinaman introduced him to a girl--some sort of an  Egyptian girl.\"    \"Go on!\" snapped Smith. \"I know her.\"    \"He saw her a good many times--and she came here once or twice. She  made out that she and Singapore Charlie were prepared to give away the  boss of the Yellow gang--\"    \"For a price, of course?\"    \"I suppose so,\" said Burke; \"but I don't know. I only know that I  warned him.\"    \"H'm!\" muttered Smith. \"And now, what took place to-night?\"    \"He had an appointment here with the girl,\" began Burke.    \"I know all that,\" interrupted Smith. \"I merely want to know what  took place after the telephone call.\"    \"Well, he told me to wait up, and I was dozing in the next room to the  study--the dining-room--when the 'phone bell aroused me. I heard the  lieutenant--Mr. Slattin--coming out, and I ran out too, but only in  time to see him taking his hat from the rack--\"    \"But he wears no hat!\"    \"He never got it off the peg! Just as he reached up to take it, he  gave a most frightful scream, and turned around like lightning as  though some one had attacked him from behind!\"    \"There was no one else in the hall?\"    \"No one at all. I was standing down there outside the dining-room just  by the stairs, but he didn't turn in my direction, he turned and  looked right behind him--where there was no one--nothing. His cries  were frightful.\" Burke's voice broke, and he shuddered feverishly.  \"Then he made a rush for the front door. It seemed as though he had  not seen me. He stood there screaming; but, before I could reach him,  he fell....\"    Nayland Smith fixed a piercing gaze upon Burke.    \"Is that all you know?\" he demanded slowly.    \"As God is my judge, sir, that's all I know, and all I saw. There was  no living thing near him when he met his death.\"    \"We shall see,\" muttered Smith. He turned to me. \"What killed him,  Petrie?\" he asked shortly.    \"Apparently something which occasioned a minute wound on the left  wrist,\" I replied, and, stooping, I raised the already cold hand in  mine.    A tiny, inflamed wound showed on the wrist; and a certain puffiness  was becoming observable in the injured hand and arm. Smith bent down  and drew a quick, sibilant breath.    \"You know what this is, Petrie?\" he cried.    \"Certainly. It was too late to employ a ligature and useless to  inject ammonia. Death was practically instantaneous. His heart....\"    There came a loud knocking and ringing.    \"Carter!\" cried Smith, turning to the detective, \"open that door to no  one--no one. Explain who I am--\"    \"But if it is the inspector--?\"    \"I said, open the door to _no one_!\" snapped Smith. \"Burke, stand  exactly where you are! Carter, you can speak to whoever knocks through  the letter-box. Petrie, don't move for your life! It may be here, in  the hall way!...\"          CHAPTER IX    THE CLIMBER      Our search of the house of Abel Slattin ceased only with the coming of  the dawn and yielded nothing but disappointment. Failure followed upon  failure; for, in the grey light of the morning, our own quest  concluded, Inspector Weymouth returned to report that the girl,  Karamaneh, had thrown him off the scent.    Again he stood before me, the big, burly friend of old and dreadful  days: a little greyer above the temples, which I set down for a record  of former horrors; but deliberate, stoical, thorough, as ever. His  blue eyes melted in the old generous way as he saw me, and he gripped  my hand in greeting.    \"Once again,\" he said, \"your dark-eyed friend has been too clever for  me, doctor. But the track, as far as I could follow, leads to the old  spot. In fact\"--he turned to Smith, who, grim-faced and haggard,  looked thoroughly ill in that grey light--\"I believe Fu-Manchu's lair  is somewhere near the former opium-den of Shen-Yan--'Singapore  Charlie'!\"    Smith nodded.    \"We will turn our attention in that direction,\" he replied, \"at a very  early date.\"    Inspector Weymouth looked down at the body of Abel Slattin.    \"How was it done?\" he asked softly.    \"Clumsily for Fu-Manchu,\" I replied. \"A snake was introduced into the  house by some means--\"    \"By Karamaneh!\" rapped Smith.    \"Very possibly by Karamaneh,\" I continued firmly. \"The thing has  escaped us.\"    \"My own idea,\" said Smith, \"is that it was concealed about his  clothing. When he fell"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19145"],[0,"The Time Traders (#11)"],[1," in her own group. Walking with a proud stride, her eyes  boldly met Ashe's. A shining disk hung about her neck on a thong, and  another decorated the woven belt of her cloth tunic. Her hair was bound  in a thread net fastened with jet pins.    \"I greet Cassca, who is the First Sower.\" There was a formal note in  Ashe's voice. \"But why should Cassca hide from Assha?\"    \"There has been death on your hill, Assha--\" she sniffed--\"you smell of  it now--Lurgha's death. Those who come from that hill may well be some  who no longer walk in their bodies.\" Cassca placed her fingers  momentarily on Ashe's outstretched palm before she nodded. \"No spirit  are you, Assha, for all know that a spirit is solid to the eye, but not  to the touch. So it would seem that you were not burned up by Lurgha,  after all.\"    \"This matter of a message from Lurgha--\" he prompted.    \"It came out of the empty air in the hearing not only of Nodren, but  also of Hangor, Effar, and myself, Cassca. For we stood at that time  near the Old Place....\" She made a curious gesture with the fingers of  her right hand. \"It will soon be the time of sowing, and though Lurgha  brings sun and rain to feed the grain, yet it is in the Great Mother  that the seed lies. Upon her business only women may go into the Inner  Circle.\" She gestured again. \"But as we met to make the first sacrifice  there came music out of the air such as we have never heard, voices  singing like birds in a strange tongue.\" Her face assumed an awesome  expression. \"Afterward a voice said that Lurgha was angered with the  hill of the men-from-afar and that in the night he would send his Wrath  against them, and that Nodren must witness this thing so that he could  see what Lurgha did to those he would punish. So it was done by Nodren.  And there was a sound in the air----\"    \"What kind of a sound?\" Ashe asked quietly.    \"Nodren said it was a hum and there was the dark shadow of Lurgha's bird  between him and the stars. Then came the smiting of the hill with  thunder and lightning, and Nodren fled, for the Wrath of Lurgha is a  fearsome thing. Now do the people come to the Great Mother's Place with  many fine offerings that she may stand between them and that Wrath.\"    \"Assha thanks Cassca, who is the handmaiden of the Great Mother. May the  sowing prosper and the reaping be good this year!\" Ashe said finally,  ignoring Lal, who still groveled on the road.    \"You go from this place, Assha?\" she asked. \"For though I stand under  the protecting hand of the Mother and so do not fear, yet there are  others who will raise their spears against you for the honor of Lurgha.\"    \"We go, and again thanks be to you, Cassca.\"    He turned back the way they had come, and Ross fell in beside him as the  woman watched them out of sight.          CHAPTER 6      \"That bird of Lurgha's--\" said Ross, once they were out of sight of  Cassca and Lal, \"could it have been a plane?\"    \"Sounds like it,\" snapped his companion. \"If the Reds have done their  work efficiently, and there's no reason to suppose otherwise, then there  is no use in contacting either Dorhta's town or Munga's. The same  announcement concerning the Wrath of Lurgha was probably made there--to  their good purpose, not ours.\"    \"Cassca didn't seem to be overly impressed with Lurgha's curse, not as  much as the man was.\"    \"She is the closest thing to a priestess that this tribe knows, and she  serves a goddess older and more powerful than Lurgha--the Mother Earth,  the Great Mother, goddess of fertility and growth. Nodren's people  believe that unless Cassca performs her mysteries and sows part of the  first field in the spring there won't be any harvest. Consequently, she  is secure in her office and doesn't fear the Wrath of Lurgha too much.  These people are now changing from one type of worship to another, but  some of Cassca's beliefs will persist clear down to our day, taking on  the coating of 'magic' and a lot of other enameling along the way.\"    Ashe had been talking as a man talks to cover up furious thinking. Now  he paused again and turned toward the sea. \"We have to stick it out  somewhere until the sub comes to pick us up. We'll need shelter.\"    \"Will the tribesmen be after us?\"    \"They may well be. Let the right men get to talking up a holy  extermination of those upon whom the Wrath of Lurgha has fallen and we  could be in for plenty of trouble. Some of those men are trained hunters  and trackers, and the Reds may have planted an agent to report the  return of anyone to our post. Just now we're about the most important  time travelers out, for we know the Reds have appeared on this line.  They must have a large post here, too, or they couldn't have sent a  plane on that raid. You can't build a time transport large enough to  take through a considerable amount of material. Everything used by us in  this age has to be assembled on this side, and the use of all machines  is limited to where they can not be seen by any natives. Luckily large  sections of this world are mostly wilderness and unpopulated in the  areas where we operate the base posts. So if the Reds have a plane, it  was put together here, and that means a big post somewhere.\" Again Ashe  was thinking aloud as he pushed ahead of Ross into the fringes of a  wood. \"Sandy and I scouted this territory pretty well last spring. There  is a cave about half a mile to the west; it will shelter us for  tonight.\"    Ashe's plans would probably have been easily accomplished if the cave  had been unoccupied. Without incident they came down into a hollow  through which trickled a small stream, its banks laced with a thin  edging of ice. Under Ashe's direction Ross collected an armload of  firewood. He was no woodsman and his prolonged exposure to the chilling  drizzle made him eager for even the very rough shelter of a cave, so  eager that he plunged forward carelessly. His foot came down on a  slippery patch of mud, sending him sprawling on his face. There was a  growl, and a white bulk rushed him. The cloak, rucked up about his  throat and shoulders, then saved his life, for only stout cloth was  caught between those fangs.    With a startled cry, Ross rolled as he might have to escape a man's  attack, struggling to unsheath his dagger. A white-hot flash of pain  scored his upper arm. The breath was driven out of him as a fight raged  over his prone body; he heard grunts, snarls, and was severely pommeled.  Then he was free as the bodies broke away. Shaken, he got to his knees.  A short distance away the fight was still in progress. He saw Ashe  straddle the body of a huge white wolf, his legs clamped about the  animal's haunches, his hooked arm under the beast's head, forcing it up  and back while his dagger rose and sank twice in the underparts of the  heaving body.    Ross held his own weapon ready. He leaped from a half crouch, and his  dagger sank cleanly home behind the short ribs. One of their blows must  have reached the animal's heart. With an almost human cry the wolf  stiffened convulsively. Then it was still. Ashe squatted near it,  methodically driving his dagger into the moist soil to clean the blade.    A red rivulet trickled down his thigh where the lower edge of his  kilt-tunic had been ripped up to the link belt. He was breathing hard,  but otherwise he was as composed as always. \"These sometimes hunt in  pairs at this season,\" he observed. \"Be ready with your bow--\"    Ross strung his with the cord he had been keeping dry within the breast  folds of his tunic. He fitted an arrow to the string, grateful to be a  passable marksman. The slash on his arm smarted in protest as he moved,  and he noted that Ashe did not try to get up.    \"A bad one?\" Ross indicated the blood now thickening into a stream along  Ashe's thigh.    Ashe pulled away the torn tunic and exposed a nasty looking gash on the  outside of his hip. He pressed his palm against the gaping wound and  motioned Ross to scout ahead. \"See if the cave is clear. We can't do  anything until we know that.\"    Reluctantly Ross followed the stream until he found the cave, a  snug-looking place with an overhang to keep it dry. The unpleasant smell  of a lair hung about its mouth. He chose a stone from the stream,  chucked it into the dark opening, and waited. The stone rattled as it  struck an inner wall, but there was no other sound. A second stone from  a different angle followed the first, with the same results. Ross was  now certain that the cave was unoccupied. Once they were inside with a  fire going at the entrance, they could hope to keep it free of  intruders. A little heartened, he cast about a bit upstream and then  turned back to where he had left Ashe.    \"No male?\" the other greeted him. \"This is a female, and she was close  to whelping--\" He nudged the white wolf with his toe. His hands held a  pad of rags against his hip, and his face was shaded with pain.    \"Nothing in the cave anyway. Let's see about this....\" Ross laid aside  the bow and kneeled to examine Ashe's thigh wound. His own slash was  more of a smarting graze, but this tear was deep and ugly.    \"Second plate--belt--\" Ashe got the words out between set teeth, and  Ross clicked open the hidden recess in the other's bronze belt to bring  out a small packet. Ashe made a wry face as he swallowed three of the  pills within. Ross mashed another pill onto the bandage he prepared,  and when the last cumbersome fold was secure Ashe relaxed.    \"Let us hope that works,\" he commented a little bleakly. \"Now come here  where I can get my hands on you and let me see your scratch. Animal  bites can be a nasty business.\"    Bandaged in turn, with the bitterness of the anti-septo pill on his  tongue, Ross helped Ashe limp upstream to the cave. He left the older  man outside while he cleaned up the floor of the cave and then made his  companion as comfortable as he could on a bed of bracken. The fire Ross  had longed for was built."]]]
