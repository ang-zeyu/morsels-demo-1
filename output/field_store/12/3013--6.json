It was now two months since he had been installed as schoolmaster in  Tant Sannie's household, and he had grown mighty and more mighty day  by day. He visited the cabin no more, sat close to Tant Sannie drinking  coffee all the evening, and walked about loftily with his hands under  the coat-tails of the German's black cloth and failed to see even a  nigger who wished him a deferential good morning. It was therefore with  no small surprise that the German perceived Bonaparte's red nose at the  door.    \"Walk in, walk in,\" he said joyfully. \"Boy, boy, see if there is any  coffee left. Well, none. Make a fire. We have done supper, but--\"    \"My dear friend,\" said Bonaparte, taking off his hat, \"I came not  to sup, not for mere creature comforts, but for an hour of brotherly  intercourse with a kindred spirit. The press of business and the weight  of thought, but they alone, may sometimes prevent me from sharing the  secrets of my bosom with him for whom I have so great a sympathy. You  perhaps wonder when I shall return the two pounds--\"    \"Oh, no, no! Make a fire, make a fire, boy. We will have a pot of hot  coffee presently,\" said the German, rubbing his hands and looking about,  not knowing how best to show his pleasure at the unexpected visit.    For three weeks the German's diffident \"Good evening\" had met with a  stately bow; the chin of Bonaparte lifting itself higher daily; and his  shadow had not darkened the cabin doorway since he came to borrow the  two pounds. The German walked to the head of the bed and took down a  blue bag that hung there. Blue bags were a speciality of the German's.  He kept above fifty stowed away in different corners of his room--some  filled with curious stones, some with seeds that had been in his  possession fifteen years, some with rusty nails, buckles, and bits of  old harness--in all, a wonderful assortment, but highly prized.    \"We have something here not so bad,\" said the German, smiling knowingly,  as he dived his hand into the bag and took out a handful of almonds and  raisins; \"I buy these for my chickens. They increase in size, but they  still think the old man must have something nice for them. And the old  man--well, a big boy may have a sweet tooth sometimes, may he not? Ha,  ha!\" said the German, chuckling at his own joke, as he heaped the plate  with almonds. \"Here is a stone--two stones to crack them--no late patent  improvement--well, Adam's nut-cracker; ha, ha! But I think we shall  do. We will not leave them uncracked. We will consume a few without  fashionable improvements.\"    Here the German sat down on one side of the table, Bonaparte on the  other; each one with a couple of flat stones before him, and the plate  between them.    \"Do not be afraid,\" said the German, \"do not be afraid. I do not forget  the boy at the fire; I crack for him. The bag is full. Why, this is  strange,\" he said suddenly, cracking upon a large nut; \"three kernels! I  have not observed that before. This must be retained. This is valuable.\"  He wrapped the nut gravely in paper, and put it carefully in his  waistcoat pocket. \"Valuable, very valuable!\" he said, shaking his head.    \"Ah, my friend,\" said Bonaparte, \"what joy it is to be once more in your  society.\"    The German's eyes glistened, and Bonaparte seized his hand and squeezed  it warmly. They then proceeded to crack and eat. After a while Bonaparte  said, stuffing a handful of raisins into his mouth:    \"I was so deeply grieved, my dear friend, that you and Tant Sannie had  some slight unpleasantness this evening.\"    \"Oh, no, no,\" said the German; \"it is all right now. A few sheep  missing; but I make it good myself. I give my twelve sheep, and work in  the other eight.\"    \"It is rather hard that you should have to make good the lost sheep,\"  said Bonaparte; \"it is no fault of yours.\"    \"Well,\" said the German, \"this is the case. Last evening I count the  sheep at the kraal--twenty are missing. I ask the herd; he tells me they  are with the other flock; he tells me so distinctly; how can I think he  lies? This afternoon I count the other flock. The sheep are not there. I  come back here: the herd is gone; the sheep are gone. But I cannot--no,  I will not--believe he stole them,\" said the German, growing suddenly  excited. \"Some one else, but not he. I know that boy. I knew him three  years. He is a good boy. I have seen him deeply affected on account of  his soul. And she would send the police after him! I say I would rather  make the loss good myself. I will not have it; he has fled in fear.  I know his heart. It was,\" said the German, with a little gentle  hesitation, \"under my words that he first felt his need of a Saviour.\"    Bonaparte cracked some more almonds, then said, yawning, and more as  though he asked for the sake of having something to converse about than  from any interest he felt in the subject:    \"And what has become of the herd's wife?\"    The German was alight again in a moment.    \"Yes; his wife. She has a child six days old, and Tant Sannie would turn  her out into the fields this night. That,\" said the German rising, \"that  is what I call cruelty--diabolical cruelty. My soul abhors that deed.  The man that could do such a thing I could run him through with a  knife!\" said the German, his grey eyes flashing, and his bushy black  beard adding to the murderous fury of his aspect. Then suddenly  subsiding, he said, \"But all is now well; Tant Sannie gives her word  that the maid shall remain for some days. I go to Oom Muller's tomorrow  to learn if the sheep may not be there. If they are not, then I return.  They are gone, that is all. I make it good.\"    \"Tant Sannie is a singular woman,\" said Bonaparte, taking the tobacco  bag the German passed to him.    \"Singular! Yes,\" said the German; \"but her heart is on her right side.  I have lived long years with her, and I may say, I have for her an  affection, which she returns. I may say,\" added the German with warmth,  \"I may say, that there is not one soul on this farm for whom I have not  an affection.\"    \"Ah, my friend,\" said Bonaparte, \"when the grace of God is in our  hearts, is it not with us all? Do we not love the very worm we tread  upon, and as we tread upon it? Do we know distinctions of race, or of  sex, or of colour? No!         \"'Love so amazing, so divine,         It fills my soul, my life, my all.'\"    After a time he sank into a less fervent mood, and remarked:    \"The coloured female who waits upon Tant Sannie appears to be of a  virtuous disposition, an individual who--\"    \"Virtuous!\" said the German; \"I have confidence in her. There is that in  her which is pure, that which is noble. The rich and high that walk this  earth with lofty eyelids might exchange with her.\"    The German here got up to bring a coal for Bonaparte's pipe, and they  sat together talking for a while. At length Bonaparte knocked the ashes  out of his pipe.    \"It is time that I took my departure, dear friend,\" he said; \"but,  before I do so, shall we not close this evening of sweet communion and  brotherly intercourse by a few words of prayer? Oh, how good and how  pleasant a thing it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! It is  like the dew upon the mountains of Hermon; for there the Lord bestowed a  blessing, even life for evermore.\"    \"Stay and drink some coffee,\" said the German.    \"No, thank you, my friend; I have business that must be done tonight,\"  said Bonaparte. \"Your dear son appears to have gone to sleep. He is  going to take the wagon to the mill tomorrow! What a little man he is.\"    \"A fine boy.\"    But though the boy nodded before the fire he was not asleep; and they  all knelt down to pray.    When they rose from their knees Bonaparte extended his hand to Waldo,  and patted him on the head.    \"Good night, my lad,\" said he. \"As you go to the mill tomorrow, we shall  not see you for some days. Good night! Good-bye! The Lord bless and  guide you; and may He bring you back to us in safety and find us all as  you have left us!\" He laid some emphasis on the last words. \"And you,  my dear friend,\" he added, turning with redoubled warmth to the German,  \"long, long shall I look back to this evening as a time of refreshing  from the presence of the Lord, as an hour of blessed intercourse with a  brother in Jesus. May such often return. The Lord bless you!\" he added,  with yet deeper fervour, \"richly, richly.\"    Then he opened the door and vanished out into the darkness.    \"He, he, he!\" laughed Bonaparte, as he stumbled over the stones. \"If  there isn't the rarest lot of fools on this farm that ever God Almighty  stuck legs to. He, he, he! When the worms come out then the blackbirds  feed. Ha, ha, ha!\" Then he drew himself up; even when alone he liked to  pose with a certain dignity; it was second nature to him.    He looked in at the kitchen door. The Hottentot maid who acted as  interpreter between Tant Sannie and himself was gone, and Tant Sannie  herself was in bed.    \"Never mind, Bon, my boy,\" he said, as he walked round to his own room,  \"tomorrow will do. He, he, he!\"        Chapter 1.VIII. He Catches the Old Bird.    At four o'clock the next afternoon the German rode across the plain,  returning from his search for the lost sheep. He rode slowly, for he had  been in the saddle since sunrise and was somewhat weary, and the heat  of the afternoon made his horse sleepy as it picked its way slowly along  the sandy road. Every now and then a great red spider would start out  of the karoo on one side of the path and run across to the other, but  nothing else broke the still monotony. Presently, behind one of the  highest of the milk-bushes that dotted the roadside, the German caught  sight of a Kaffer woman, seated there evidently for such shadow as the  milk-bush might afford from the sloping rays of the sun.    The German turned the horse's head out of the road. It was not his way  to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14411"],[0,"The Children's Six Minutes (#11)"],[1,"    The tree of the Christmas season has some specifically Christmas  messages. First, it is evergreen. That reminds us of the eternal  Saviour, \"the same yesterday, to-day and forever.\" At the very tiptop of  the tree we place a star. There it shines, high above all else,  reminding us of the higher, holier life to which we are summoned. The  star beckons us to loftier aspirations. Christ came down from heaven. He  became one of us, sharing our human life. But he is ever above us as  well as with us, luring us on to the life of God. The Christmas tree is  ablaze with lights. Jesus brought light into the world. How dark the  world would be without him! About the base of the tree, and suspended  from the branches are many gifts. They are tokens of the love and esteem  we hold for each other, and remind us of God's great gift of love,  Christ himself.    MEMORY VERSE, _John_ 3: 16        \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,      that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have      everlasting life.\"    MEMORY HYMN [112]        _\"There's a song in the air.\"_          THE BEST WORD      What is the best word! I think I can hear each of you as he answers. One  says \"Mother is the best word.\" Another says, \"Father.\" Still another,  \"Daddy.\" A fourth one answers, \"Home.\" Now I hear a voice that says,  \"America.\" Another voice shouts, \"Friend.\" Yes, there are many, many  words to which we might rightfully give the title \"best word.\"    But for this season of the year, and for this particular Sunday, there  is one word that stands out from among all the others. That one word is  \"Christmas.\" To-morrow will be Christmas day. I think this word  \"Christmas\" is the best word because it includes all the other good  words.    In your home you have a rug. There are many colors in that rug, yet it  is all one fabric. The many colors are skillfully woven and beautifully  blended to make the one fabric. Think of this word Christmas as a rug,  made up of many words of many colors. We see in this rug the word  \"mother.\" What would Christmas be without mother! We see also the word  father, and the words sister, brother, grandfather, grandmother, aunt,  uncle, friend, home. Then clearest of all in this wonderful rug is the  word Christ. Christ is Christmas. Yes, Christmas is the best word for it  gathers within its meaning all other good words.        \"This happy day, whose risen sun Shall set not through eternity;      This holy day, when Christ, the Lord, Took on him our humanity;      For little children everywhere A joyous season still we make; We      bring our precious gifts to them, Even for the dear Child, Jesus'      sake.\"    MEMORY VERSE, _John_ 1: 4        \"In him was life; and the life was the light of men.\"    MEMORY HYMN [107]        _\"Joy to the world!\"_          LAST BUT NOT LEAST      How often have we heard this phrase! You girls and boys use it, \"Here I  am, last but not least.\"    When Jesus was on earth there was often a discussion among the disciples  concerning rank among them. Some were fearful that they would be last.  One day a mother, very proud of her two sons, as mothers are apt to be,  asked Jesus to grant permission that her two sons might sit, the one on  his left hand, the other on his right, in the kingdom. Then He made a  very beautiful as well as perfectly true statement, \"Whosoever will be  chief among you, let him be your servant; even as the Son of man came  not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a  ransom for many.\"    There was another time, when Jesus sat at supper with his disciples,  wishing to show them, by example, the utter worthlessness of station,  for station's sake, rose from the table, took a towel and basin, and  began to wash the disciples' feet. Peter objected, but when he  understood, he said, \"Not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.\"  At the last Jesus said, \"Verily I say unto you, the servant is not  greater than his Lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent  him.\"    Girls and boys, if you desire a high place in life, begin low. If you  want to occupy a leading place you must be willing to serve in the  least. It always has been so, it will never change, this great law of  life, that he who would be first must be willing to be last. It is the  eternal law of service.    MEMORY VERSE, _Mark_ 10: 31        \"... But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.\"    MEMORY HYMN [402]        _\"Hark, the voice of Jesus calling.\"_"]]]
