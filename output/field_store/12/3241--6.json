[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19116"],[0,"How to Sing (#11)"],[1,",--that is, the least risky range to exploit and  preserve,--even if this has to be done only temporarily.    Copious vocal resources may with impunity be brought before the public  and thereby submitted to strain, only after long and regular study.    The pure head tone, without admixture of palatal resonance, is feeble  close at hand, but penetrating and of a carrying power equalled by no  other. Palatal resonance without admixture of the resonance of the  head cavities (head tones) makes the tone very powerful when heard  near by, but without vibrancy for a large auditorium. This is the  proof of how greatly _every_ tone needs the proper admixture.          SECTION XVIII    THE HIGHEST HEAD TONES      As we have already seen, there is almost no limit to the height that  can be reached by the pure head tone without admixture of palatal  resonance. Very young voices, especially, can reach such heights, for  without any strain they possess the necessary adaptability and skill  in the adjustment to each other of the larynx, tongue, and pillars of  the fauces. A skill that rests on ignorance of the true nature of the  phenomenon must be called pure chance, and thus its disappearance is  as puzzling to teacher and listener as its appearance had been in the  first place. How often is it paired with a total lack of ability to  produce anything but the highest head tones! As a general rule such  voices have a very short lease of life, because their possessors are  exploited as wonders, before they have any conception of the way to  use them, of tone, right singing, and of cause and effect in general.  An erroneous pressure of the muscles, a wrong movement of the tongue  (raising the tip, for instance, [Illustration]), an attempt to  increase the strength of the tone,--all these things extinguish  quickly and for all time the wonder-singer's little light.    We Lehmann children in our youth could sing to the very highest pitch.  It was nothing for my sister Marie to strike the 4-line _e_ a hundred  times in succession, and trill on it for a long time. She could have  sung in public at the age of seven. But since our voices, through the  circumstances of our life and surroundings, were forced to early  exertions, they lost their remarkable high notes; yet enough was left  to sing the _Queen of Night_ (in Mozart's opera \"Die Zauberfloete\"),  with the high _f_.    After I had been compelled to use my lower and middle ranges much  more, in the study of dramatic parts, I omitted the highest notes from  my practice, but could not then always have relied on them. Now that I  know on what it all depends, it is very easy for me to strike high  _f_, not only in passing, but to combine it with any tone through  three octaves. But upon the least pressure by any organ, the head  resonance loses its brilliancy; that is, the breath no longer streams  into the places where it should, and can create no more whirling  currents of sound to fill the spaces.    But one should not suppose that the head tones have no power. When  they are properly used, their vibrancy is a substitute for any amount  of power.    As soon as the head tones come into consideration, one should _never_  attempt to sing an open _ah_, because on _ah_ the tongue lies  flattest. One should think of an _[=a]_, and in the highest range even  an _[=e]_; should mix the _[=a]_ and _[=e]_ with the _ah_, and thereby  produce a position of the tongue and soft palate that makes the path  clear for the introduction of the breath into the cavities of the  head.    [Illustration: Red lines denote vocal sensation in the highest head  tones without mixture.]    Singers who, on the other hand, pronounce _[=a]_ and _[=e]_ too  sharply, need only introduce an admixture of _oo_; they thereby lower  the position of the larynx, and thus give the vowel and tone a darker  color.    Since the stream of breath in the highest tones produces currents  whirling with great rapidity, the more rapidly the higher the tone is,  the slightest pressure that may injure the form in which they  circulate may ruin the evenness of the tone, its pitch, perhaps the  tone itself. Each high tone must _soar gently_, like the overtones.    The upper limits of a bass and baritone voice are    [Music illustration]    where, consequently, the tones must be mixed. Pure head tones, that  is, falsetto, are never demanded higher than this. I regard it,  however, as absolutely necessary for the artist to give consideration  to his falsetto, that he may include it among his known resources.  Neither a bass nor a baritone should neglect to give it the proper  attention, and both should learn to use it as one of their most  important auxiliary forces.    With what mastery did Betz make use of it; how noble and beautiful his  voice sounded in all its ranges; of what even strength it was, and how  infallibly fresh! And let no one believe that Nature gave it to him  thus. As a beginner in Berlin he was quite unsatisfactory. He had the  alternative given him either to study with great industry or to seek  another engagement, for his successor had already been selected. Betz  chose to devote himself zealously to study; he began also to play the  'cello; he learned to _hear_, and finally raised himself to be one of  our first singers, in many roles never to be forgotten. Betz knew,  like myself, many things that to-day are neither taught nor learned.          SECTION XIX    EXTENSION OF THE COMPASS AND EQUALIZATION OF REGISTERS      The whole secret of both consists in the proper raising and lowering  of the soft palate, and the pillars of the fauces connected with it.  This divides into two resonating divisions the breath coming from the  source of supply, and forced against the chest, whereby it is put  under control, as it escapes vocalized from the larynx. It consists  also in the singer's natural adaptability and skill, in so placing the  palate and resonance of the head cavities, or keeping them in  readiness for every tone, as the pitch, strength, and duration of the  individual tones or series of connected tones, with their propagation  form, shall demand.          SECTION XX    THE TREMOLO      Big voices, produced by large, strong organs, through which the breath  can flow in a broad, powerful stream, are easily disposed to suffer  from the tremolo, because the outflow of the breath against the vocal  cords occurs too _immediately_. The breath is sent directly out from  the lungs and the body, instead of being driven by the abdominal  pressure forward against the chest and the controlling apparatus. Not  till this has been done, should it be admitted, in the smallest  amounts, and under control to the vocal cords. It does not pause, but  streams through them without burdening them, though keeping them  always more or less stretched, in which the muscular power of  contraction and relaxation assists. Streaming _gently_ out from the  vocal cords, it is now led, with the support of the tongue, to its  resonance chambers, all the corners of which it fills up equally. Even  the strongest vocal cords cannot for any length of time stand the  uncontrolled pressure of the breath. They lose their tension, and the  result is the tremolo.    In inhaling, the chest should be raised not at all or but very little.  (For this reason exercises for the expansion of the chest must be  practised.) The pressure of the breath _against_ the chest must be  maintained as long as it is desired to sustain a tone or sing a  phrase. As soon as the pressure of the abdomen and chest ceases, the  tone and the breath are at an end. Not till toward the very end of the  breath, that is, of the tone or the phrase, should the pressure be  slowly relaxed, and the chest slowly sink.    While I am singing, I must press the breath against the chest  _evenly_, for in this way alone can it be directed evenly against the  vocal cords, which is the chief factor in a steady tone and the only  possible and proper use of the vocal cords.    The uninterrupted control of the breath pressure against the chest  gives to the tone, as soon as it has found a focal point on the raised  palate at the attack, the basis, the body, which must be maintained  even in the softest pianissimo. Control of the breath should never  cease. The tone should never be made too strong to be kept under  control, nor too weak to be kept under control. This should be an  inflexible rule for the singer.    I direct my whole attention to the pressure against the chest, which  forms the door of the supply chamber of breath. Thence I admit to the  vocal cords uninterruptedly only just so much as I wish to admit. I  must not be stingy, nor yet extravagant with it. Besides giving  steadiness, the pressure against the chest (the controlling apparatus)  establishes the strength and the duration of the tone. Upon the  proper control depends the length of the breath, which, without  interruption, rises from here toward the resonating chambers, and,  expelled into the elastic form of the resonating apparatus, there must  obey our will.    [Illustration: Vocal Cords.]    It can now be seen how easily the vocal cords can be injured by an  uncontrolled current of breath, if it is directed against them in all  its force. One need only see a picture of the vocal cords to  understand the folly of exposing these delicate little bands to the  explosive force of the breath. They cannot be protected too much; and  also, they cannot be too carefully exercised. They must be spared all  work not properly theirs; this must be put upon the chest tension  muscles, which in time learn to endure an out-and-out thump.    Even the vibrato, to which full voices are prone, should be nipped in  the bud, for gradually the tremolo, and later even worse, is developed  from it. Life can be infused into the tone by means of the lips--that  is, in a way that will do no harm. But of that later.    Vibrato is the first stage,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19138"],[0,"Resonance in Singing and Speaking (#11)"],[1,"action, but by  cultivating normal action.      EXERCISES FOR PRACTICE    The following exercises are designed for the primary development of a  correct tone and for the test of the perfection of every tone at every  stage of development. They are based upon the assumption that all  tones of the voice should be focused and delivered precisely alike.  Their use should constitute a part of the daily practice of the singer  or speaker.    I give but few exercises for each point to be gained. Intelligent  teachers and pupils will add an infinite variety to suit each case,  but the exercises given appear to me to be the best for initial  practice. It is important that each exercise in its order shall be  thoroughly mastered before taking up the next. Only in this way can  rapid progress be made, for it is not the multiplicity of exercises,  but the thoughtful application of principles in the few, that leads to  results.    The sound of _hng_ will always place the voice in proper focus by  developing the resonance of the nose and head. The thin bones of the  nose will first respond to the sound and after practice the vibrations  can be felt on any part of the head and even more distinctly on the  low than on the high tones. To attain this, repeat the sound _hung_  times without number, prolonging the _ng_ sound at least four counts.  To insure the proper course of the vowel sounds through the nasal  passages, follow _hung_ with the vowel _ee_, as this vowel is more  easily focused than any other; then with _oo_, _oh_, _aw_ and _ah_.    _Ah_ is by far the most difficult sound to focus and should never be  used for initial practice. Much valuable time has been lost by the  custom of using this sound at first. It should come last.    The _h_ is chosen to introduce the vowel sound because in the  preparation to produce the sound of the letter _h_ the epiglottis is  wide open and the vocal cords entirely relaxed, and because less  change of the tongue is required when the vowel sound follows.      Preliminary Exercise    _Practise this softly on any pitch easy for the voice._    [Music illustration: Hung-ee. Hung-oo. Hung-oh. Hung-aw. Hung-ah.  Hung-ee _etc._]    Begin the tone quietly on an easy pitch and continue it softly to the  end. Later, after these exercises are mastered on one pitch, use every  note within the easy compass of the voice. Leave stridency of tone to  the locust. It is no part of a perfect tone. It never appeared in the  voices of the most famous singers. Those who allowed themselves to use  it passed off the stage early in life. Much better results will be  obtained by practising without any accompaniment. The sound of the  piano or other instrument distracts the pupil, prevents both pupil and  teacher from hearing the voice, and hinders progress.      IMPORTANT DIRECTIONS    The manner in which Exercise I and those that follow is practised is  of the utmost importance. Therefore carefully note and apply the  following:    1. Fully pronounce the word _hung_ (_u_ as in _stung_) at once, and  prolong the tone, not on the vowel sound but on the _ng_ sound. This  establishes the proper head and nasal resonance at the very beginning  of the exercise.    2. In passing from _ng_ to _ee_ be very careful not to change the  initial focus or lose the sensation of nasal and head resonance. Do  not therefore move the lips or the chin. The only change at this point  is the slight movement of the tongue required to pronounce _ee_, which  must be a pure vowel without a trace of the preceding _g_.    3. In passing from _ee_ to _oo_, from _oo_ to _oh_, and so on, do so  with the least possible movement of lips and chin. _The initial  sensation of nasal and head resonance must not be lost._    4. Each vowel sound must be distinct in enunciation and pure in  quality. Avoid blurring one with the other. Give each its true  individuality.    5. As jewels of different hue hung on a string, so must this exercise  be the stringing of vowels on a continuous stream of sound.      Exercise I    TO ESTABLISH NASAL AND HEAD RESONANCE    This is an exercise for focusing or placing the voice and developing  the vibrations of the nasal and head cavities, the most essential  parts of the resonant apparatus. If the nostrils are kept fully open,  no nasal twang will be heard. The strength of the tone will correspond  to the force of the vibrations of the nose and head, which can be  plainly felt by resting the finger lightly upon the side of the nose.  The vibrations may eventually be plainly felt on the top and back of  the head.    Attack, that is, begin the tone, _softly_ and on no account force it  in the least. Pronounce the full word _at once_, prolong the _ng_ four  counts as indicated, and sing the five vowel sounds on a continuous,  unbroken tone. Articulate entirely with the lips and without moving  the under jaw. In this, as in the following exercises, keep the under  jaw relaxed and open the mouth so as to separate the teeth as wide  apart as is consistent with the action of the lips. See also the  illustrations of proper lip position given at the close of Chapter II.    _Practice this exercise on any pitch easy for the voice._    [Music illustration: Hung-ee-oo-oh-aw-ah _etc._]    Repeat this many times until the nose and head vibrations are fully  recognized and established. After mastery of this exercise is  acquired, any words ending in _ng_ may be repeated. The word _noon_  sung quietly on each note of the voice with the final consonant  prolonged will be found helpful.      EXERCISES FOR SPEAKERS    When the placing of the voice is accomplished on the one tone  (Exercise I), the speaker can go on with practice in reading and  reciting, allowing the voice to change its pitch at its will, only  being careful that all the tones are alike in quality.    A profitable exercise for speakers is to pronounce any word or  syllable ending with _ng_, as _ming_, _bing_, _sing_, _ring_, _ting_,  and follow it with some familiar lines in a monotone, being sure that  the tone is the same and produces the same vibrations in the nose and  head.    In the case of a person already a public speaker, this new _regime_  may not immediately manifest itself in performance, but gradually the  right principles will assume control, and speaking be done with ease  and effectiveness. Continual daily practice of exercises should be  kept up.    If a speaker has a musical ear and some musical knowledge, he will  derive great benefit by following out the practice of the exercises  for singers. In no way can the voice for speaking be improved so  rapidly or decisively as by musical training.      Exercise II    TO ESTABLISH HEAD AND NASAL RESONANCE    As in Exercise I, sing softly, seeking purity of vowel sounds and  quality of tone. Fully pronounce _hung_ at once, prolonging the _ng_  four counts as indicated. Pass from one vowel to the next with the  least possible change in the position of the lips and chin. The stream  of sound is to be unbroken, the tone focus unchanged, and the  sensation of resonance in the upper chambers continuous.    [Music illustration: Hung-ee-oo-oh-aw-ah _etc._]    [Music illustration: Hung-ee-oo-oh-aw-ah _etc._]      Exercise III    UPPER RESONANCE CONTINUED    Follow the directions for Exercise I. Sing quietly in a pitch that is  easy for the voice, and modulate up or down by half steps.    [Music illustration: Hung-ee-oo-oh-aw-ah _etc._]      Exercise IV    UPPER RESONANCE CONTINUED    The last exercise carried the voice an interval of a third; this  carries the voice an interval of a fifth. Follow carefully the  directions of Exercise I. Be sure to pronounce _hung_ at once,  prolonging the tone not on the vowel but on the _ng_. _Sing softly._  Vary the pitch to suit the voice.    [Music illustration: Hung-ee-oo-oh-aw-ah _etc._]      Exercise V    UPPER RESONANCE CONTINUED    The last exercise carried the voice an interval of a fifth, this one  has a range of a sixth, while Exercise VI has a range of an octave.  Carefully follow the Important Directions on page 60.    _Sing softly_ in a pitch that is easy for the voice.    [Music illustration: Hung-ee-oo-oh-aw-ah _etc._]    [Music illustration: Hung-ee-oo-oh-aw-ah _etc._]      Exercise VI    TO ENLARGE THE THROAT AND THUS MAGNIFY THE TONE    Pronounce the word _hung_ at once, opening the mouth well. Prolonging  the _ng_ sound as indicated will insure the proper focus.    Sing the five vowel sounds throughout the scale as indicated. At first  practise only on scales that are in easy range.    [Music illustration:    1. Hung-ee  2. Hung-oo  3. Hung-oh  4. Hung-aw  5. Hung-ah    _etc._]      VIa    [Music illustration:    1. Hung-ee  2. Hung-oo  3. Hung-oh  4. Hung-aw  5. Hung-ah    _etc._]      Exercise VII    FOR PRODUCTION OF THE VOWEL SOUNDS IN PROPER FOCUS    Produce the _hung_ at once, and add the vowel. _Be sure that the vowel  sound follows the same course as the \"ng\" sound which precedes it, and  produces the same sensation in the nose._    The vowels are arranged in the order chosen because _ee_ is the most  easily focused while _ah_ is by far the most difficult to focus, and  hence the worst possible sound for initial practice. _Think_ of the  tone as being made in the nose and head.    Let there be no break or stopping of the tone when passing from the  _ng_ sound to the vowel. Simply change the tone into the vowel desired  by the proper change in the articulating organs.    Sing the five vowel sounds connectedly, being sure that each vowel is  correctly placed before passing to the next. The proper use of the  lips will aid greatly in focusing the vowels. Start with the scale  that is in comfortable range.
