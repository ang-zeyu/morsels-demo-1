Jan knew what that meant. His legs  trembled as he pressed forward. Oh, if he could only make this man  understand that he did not mean to hurt or frighten the little girls! He  only wanted some one to take off this horrible muzzle.    The dog's pleading eyes were lifted to the man's face and then, unable  to stand any longer, Jan fell weakly to the ground and pulled himself  forward, inch by inch, to show that he meant no harm, and all the while  his ragged tail kept beating very feebly. The man looked at him, then  lowered the gun.    \"Come here, girls! Your bear is only a lost dog!\"    Jan did not look around at the patter of feet, but his paws went to the  muzzle, and as he lay with his head against the man's feet, the  pitifully pleading eyes and tugging paws of the dog spoke as plainly as  words.    \"Poor fellow!\" said a gentle voice, then a woman's fingers worked  carefully at the strap and Jan felt the muzzle fall away.    He touched her hand with his dry, stiff tongue, and saw the two little  sunbonnet children, laughing, yet still afraid of the big dog, come to  their mother's side. The man noticed the broken rope and examined the  collar.    \"No name or license,\" he spoke at last, \"but somebody will be looking  for him. I wonder how long he has been wandering around with this muzzle  on him, poor chap!\"    \"Bring water, children,\" said the mother, \"and the things that were left  over from lunch. He must be hungry.\"    The tin pail was rescued from the ground and filled twice with water  before Jan's thirst was slaked and he looked up with grateful eyes and  dripping jaws. While he was drinking his fill, a basket had been opened  by the children and slices of cold meat and bits of buttered bread were  placed before him. He swallowed the food greedily, but paused between  gulps to wag his tail and let them know how he thanked them.    For some time after this he lay quietly resting while the sunbonnet  children sat close beside him and wondered where he came from and what  his name was. Ruth, the younger, put out her hand to touch him timidly.    \"I'm not afraid of him. He won't bite. He isn't a bear to eat us all up,  is he, Charlotte?\"    \"I--I--aren't afraid, either,\" Charlotte's voice was uncertain, but her  hand touched the dog's big head. Then both children lost all fear of  him and Jan forgot about William and the hours of suffering, for the two  little girls curled close to him, and soon they were all three fast  asleep.    The sun was almost setting when the father and mother tucked the basket  and shawls into the automobile. Jan watched with puzzled eyes as they  carefully put away some little boards. He had noticed when he woke from  his doze that both the man and the woman were sitting on stools with  these boards propped before them, and they were making marks on them.  The father was already in the machine and the little girls climbed in,  then the mother put her foot on the step and Jan let out a wild howl  that made them all start. He thought they were going to leave him behind  and he knew that he could never run fast enough to follow them.    \"Good gracious! What a howl!\" exclaimed the man, laughing. \"We won't  leave you. Jump up, old chap!\"    Jan lost no time scrambling into the automobile, then it ran swiftly  along a smooth road which finally twisted through a beautiful canyon.  Great trees were on all sides and a tiny stream bubbled and danced far  below. Birds sang and rabbits dashed out of the brush with swift hops  and jerks, but Jan did not want to eat the rabbits now. The children  kept laughing and clapping their hands, calling to Jan, \"Look, look,  quick!\" Sometimes their hands pressed his head to make him turn where  they pointed.    Jan was very happy on that ride, but he still hoped that by and by he  might get back home to Hippity-Hop and the captain.          Chapter X    THE HOME OF THE SUNBONNET BABIES      The home of Jan's new friends was perched high on the top of a mountain  peak, far above the canyon through which they had driven. Jan heard them  call this place Topango Pass. The house stood alone with overhanging oak  trees and a garden full of flowers that made him think of the yard in  front of the captain's bungalow.    A big stone fireplace was near the house, and pink geraniums grew  closely around the little home, while over the porch climbed yellow  roses that looked as if the fairies had hidden their gold among the  green leaves.    \"This is Roseneath,\" announced Charlotte to Jan as the automobile  stopped in front of the porch and the two girls jumped out, followed by  the dog.    \"Charlotte!\" Ruth said suddenly, stopping halfway up the path, \"we've  got to find a name for that dog right away!\"    It was a very serious matter, so the children sat on the lowest step of  the porch and Jan squatted before them. He wished he could help by  telling his name and about the Hospice, but all he could do was to sit  still and look from one eager little face to the other. After trying  several names they decided on \"Bruin.\"    \"Because he is so big and black, just like a bear!\"    Jan rather liked the name. It sounded like Bruno, but of course, the  sunbonnet children did not know anything about Bruno and the Hospice, so  they said Jan was very smart to remember the new name without any  trouble at all.    The next morning he was wakened early by the children's voices and  hurried to meet them in front of the house. Charlotte had a tin bucket  in her hand and Jan wondered if they were going to pick more berries.  But they went down a path that led to the stable and then he stood still  in surprise.    Right in front of them was a strange creature about the size of a common  dog. It had long, white hair, a white beard like a very old man's, two  horns curved back over its head and its feet had sharp-pointed hoofs. It  was tied by a rope and back of it was a smaller animal of the same  kind.    Charlotte went past the larger one and sat down on a little wooden stool  beside the smaller animal and soon the tin pail was full of milk. Back  to the house trotted the children, and Jan, very much puzzled, kept  beside them. In the kitchen they found the mother cooking breakfast. Jan  lifted his nose and sniffed at the odor of broiling steak and hot  biscuit.    \"Milk for the berries we picked yesterday,\" the mother of the sunbonnet  children said smiling. \"Won't we have a fine breakfast this morning! And  there's a nice bone in the steak for Bruin, too!\"    She poured a little milk into a pan and placed it on the floor for Jan.  He knew that the white animal must have been a cow, yet it was not like  the cow at the Pixleys' home, but when he tasted the milk, it was just  as nice as the big, yellow cow's milk.    While breakfast was being eaten, the children and their parents chatted  together and Jan looked about the place. The walls of the rooms were  hung with beautiful pictures, among them many fat little babies with  sunbonnets hiding their faces. He was sure that if the sunbonnets were  pushed back he would see the faces of Ruth and Charlotte laughing at  him.    As time went by Jan was quite happy and learned to love his gentle  playmates very dearly. He grew accustomed to seeing the artists sitting  before boards, painting pictures like those on the walls. Even the  little girls, Ruth and Charlotte, sometimes sat on the ground and made  him lie still while they worked away with pencils and pieces of paper  and told him they were making his picture to put in a book. It did not  quite explain matters to Jan when Ruth held up one of these papers in  front of his nose and said, \"You see, Bruin, we're going to be  ill--us--trators like mother when we grow up, and then we'll put you in  a book, maybe!\"    After Jan had several good baths the ugly black dye began to wear off  and his white shirt-front and paws and the white streak on his nose  showed plainly. Then the rusty black fur on his entire body became its  natural tawny red and grew rapidly. The Melvilles now realized that Jan  had been stolen and often wondered who had lost him. They asked the few  people they saw but none of them had heard of such a dog, so the family  felt that Jan belonged to them.    Ruth and Charlotte were much interested when their parents told them  that Bruin was a St. Bernard dog, and all about the noble animals that  lived at the Hospice, for the two artists had visited the place many  years before Ruth or Charlotte had been born. When their mother finished  telling them these things, Ruth exclaimed, \"Mother! Then you and daddy  and Charlotte and me are all St. Bernard dogs, because we found Bruin  when he was lost, didn't we?\"    Jan was not the only pet of this family. The \"Melville Menagerie\" was  what their mother called the collection of animals. There were two  grown-up goats, named Captain Kidd and Mrs. Cream; two baby-goats,  Peaches and Strawberry; a mother cat named Chicago, because she was  smoke color, and her three kittens, Texas, California, and Pennsylvania.  Next was the canary bird, Pitty-Sing, and last, but not least, five  horn-toads which were nameless, but who lived peacefully together in a  box with sand to burrow in.    All of these members of the family interested Jan, but he wanted to be  friends with the old cat and her kittens, because he missed Hippity-Hop.  Whenever he tried to go near them, the four jumped to their feet, arched  their backs, and spat at him so rudely that he gave up making friends,  and decided that only three-legged cats liked dogs.    Each day about three o'clock all work was put aside by the artists, for  this was the time they went to visit \"The Land of Make-Believe.\"  Sometimes they were gypsies, and supper was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14900"],[0,"The Black Man's Place in South Africa (#11)"],[1,"  Can it be said that mental capacity and collective will-power were  lacking in any of these people? On the contrary, it is admitted that  they were possessed of mental powers as great as those of the restless  Europeans of to-day who are rushing onward in a ceaseless pursuit of  change, a pursuit made possible only by continuous victory over the  forces of conservatism, and this victory, as I think, is gained not  through the outward circumstances of climate and geographical  surroundings, but through a \"divine discontent\" which is kindled, we  know not how, in the leaders of the world, regardless of time and place,  as says the poet of one whom he hails as the deliverer of his country:        \"A flaming coal      Lit at the stars and sent      To burn the sin of patience from her soul,      The scandal of content.\"    It is this inward fire rather than any outward pressure that prompts the  captive spirit to break loose from the fetters of the unmoving giant,  custom, the greatest of all tyrants, who grows stronger as he grows  older. The difficulty of reversing the ways and conditions that have  been induced from birth is tremendous, and progress has never been  possible without breaking away, always at great risk to the innovators,  the stoned prophets of all ages, from the powerful grip of hoary and  hallowed custom, which is the essence of conservatism. Initiative  implies the breaking of the commandment which enjoins everyone to honour  his father and mother that he may live long in the land, a sanction  which entails continued adherence to the ancestral ways and ideas, and  which, being rooted in instinctive fear of innovation, has power over us  all.    Progress, then, has everywhere been the result, in the beginning, of  individual initiative in men who were possessed of the power of  personality, the \"born\" leaders of the world who, whether they figured  as chiefs or kings, witchdoctors or priests, prophets or lawgivers, were  all reformers in their various ways. We see how these restless spirits  have appeared everywhere at irregular intervals, not only in localities  favoured by nature, but often in the most unlikely places, and there is  no reason for thinking that this sporadic cropping up of new leaders  will ever cease.    But although we believe that progress has been started always and  everywhere by the efforts of reformers that have occurred as spontaneous  variations from the dead level of their fellows independent of time and  circumstances, we need not deny the effect of environment, especially  the effect of an inimical environment, upon a new movement after it has  been started, and it may well be that the physical disadvantages of the  great \"dark\" continent may have made difficult, if not impossible, in  the past that meeting and friction of different cultures which seem to  be essential to the birth of intellectual life, so that here the  admitted isolation of the inhabitants during many centuries may have  served to squelch initiative and foster stagnation. Nevertheless the  influence of environment must not be over-rated for we see that general  contentment with resulting inertia have existed for untold ages in  places where now the sounds and shocks of daily progress reverberate in  a thousand fields of civilised activity without any change being  discernible either in the bodily or mental calibre of the people  themselves, and this must surely teach us that it is not incapacity nor  yet unfavourable physical environment, but that, more than anything  else, it is the dead weight of human conservatism that holds down a  nation or a race to its particular level; that it is the human element  in the general milieu that determines human development, a lesson that  has been well summed up in the Chinese aphorism \"A man is more like the  age he lives in than he is like his father and mother.\"    Some years ago a theory was advanced which assumed the presence from the  beginning of an inherently superior race of blond Europeans who, it was  supposed, left their lairs in the North from time to time to harass and  conquer essentially inferior people in the South whom they innervated  through intermarriage with their superior mentality, and thereby  succeeded in rearing those mighty civilisations that waned and fell when  the \"blue\" blood of the invaders became absorbed and lost in the old  autochthonous streams. Apart from the lack of cogent evidence this  theory, if it may be so called, is unsatisfactory in that it does not  explain why these putative super-men failed to establish within their  own stimulating environment any of those great cultures that were set up  in places and under climatic conditions which are supposed to have been  far less provocative to progress. To-day the theories of Gobineau and  Houston Chamberlain who both held up the Teutons as being at all times  the greatest and noblest of human kind, do not impress the non-Teuton  part of the world, nor do the later apostles of the more recent \"Nordic\"  race faith, like Madison Grant, and others of his school, succeed in  persuading thinking men and women that the Scandinavians and the English  are the only people that ever could initiate and sustain great  civilisations. The fact that great civilisations have been built up and  are now being developed by people who were and are neither blond nor  Nordic makes it impossible to believe these pretensions to exclusive  racial genius and merit. \"All the talk,\" says Professor Flinders Petrie,  \"about Nordic supremacy is vanity when we look at the facts in Europe.  Dark Iberians and Picts, Asiatics, Gaels and Celts, are the basis of our  peoples. Further, it is in the time of stress and difficulty that the  older stocks come again to the top. The majority of the men of power  among the Allies have not been fair Nordics but dark men of the  underlying races.\"[19]    Recent study has indeed dissipated that fascinating idyl about the old  race of tall, blond Aryans as the originators of our present  civilisation, for it has been shown that the so-called Aryan  civilisation was inferior in many ways to the primitive culture of  neolithic times, and it can now hardly be doubted that our classical  civilisation is of Mediterranean origin though Aryanised in speech. It  is now generally accepted that history points not to Scandinavia and  Germany, but to the lands lying round the Mediterranean Sea as  furnishing the matrix out of which civilisation has sprung. It is to the  South rather than to the North, to the early people of Egypt, Palestine,  Greece and Rome, and not to the primitive inhabitants of Scandinavia and  Germany, that we must look for those great men whose intellect and  character were strong enough to overcome the natural conservatism of  their times. The mind of the early white men of the North never soared  higher than a valhalla peopled with puerile deities and blood-stained  warriors whereas the swarthy thinkers of the South discovered the unseen  God, invented art and philosophy and developed law and government. And  though the Church proclaims the highest of all born leaders, Christ  himself, to be the very son of God, yet was he a native of Palestine and  not a fair-haired, blue-eyed Teuton as represented by mediaeval painters  of Germany and Holland.    It is no doubt true that the invaders and the immigrants have often  achieved more in their new surroundings than in their homelands, as the  Moors in Spain and the Irish in America, but it must not be forgotten  that the civilisation which the new-comers have enriched by virtue of  their new found freedom from home conservatism has not been of their  making; they may have added thereto but they did not beget it; the  spade-work, which is the hardest part, had been done before they  arrived.    Looking, round the world to-day we see clearly that race is not the  determining factor in contemporary progress. In Japan we see a people,  admittedly not white, who until yesterday were stagnating under a system  of childish feudalism, now developing at a great pace a culture similar  with and not inferior to that of modern Europe, while in Western Ireland  we see white people living in a state of sloth and squalor below that of  many \"raw\" Bantu tribes in South Africa. These facts show that any race,  white black, or yellow, may be kept down simply by the forces of  conservatism, chief among which is priestcraft operating through  prejudice and superstition in the name of religion. To say this is not  to cavil at the priests of any particular time or creed. We must have  priests as well as prophets. The prophet of a new faith begins his  mission by breaking the images of the priests before him and is  succeeded by his own priests who set up new images and dogmas wherewith  to conserve the new-found creed until it in turn becomes too old when,  in the never-ceasing course of evolution, the law of variation bids a  new prophet arise. The priest must needs be to preserve the world from  the anarchy of too many reformers, but his power, if long continued,  tends to inhibit the divine spirit of discontent which makes for human  advancement. It is the priest's duty to preserve the old and to hinder  the new, and when he finds he can no longer ignore the new inventions  that are made around him he will at most accept the new learning as a  means only to preserve the old order whose servant he is. The founder of  the Society of Jesus enjoined his followers: \"Let us all think in the  same way, let us all speak in the same manner, if possible,\" and it is  reported of him that he said that were he to live five hundred years he  would always repeat \"no novelties in theology, in philosophy or logic,  not even in grammar.\" In Africa priestcraft, in its primitive form of  witchcraft, has continued for unnumbered ages to perpetuate the  elementary creed of ancestor worship whose chief article is that the  ways of the fathers"]]]
