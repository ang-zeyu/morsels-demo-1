Ambros,  the historian, quotes a number of these melodies, but falls  into a strange mistake, for his version of a folk song called  \"_Tsin-fa_\" is as follows:        [Figure 01]    Now this is exactly as if a Chinaman, wishing to give his  countrymen an idea of a Beethoven sonata, were to eliminate  all the harmony and leave only the bare melody accompanied by  indiscriminate beats on the gong and a steady banging on two or  three drums of different sizes. This is certainly the manner  in which the little melody just quoted would be accompanied,  and not by European chords and rhythms.    If we could eliminate from our minds all thoughts of music and  bring ourselves to listen only to the _texture_ of sounds, we  could better understand the Chinese ideal of musical art. For  instance, if in listening to the deep, slow vibrations of a  large gong we ignore completely all thought of pitch, fixing  our attention only upon the roundness and fullness of the sound  and the way it gradually diminishes in volume without losing  any of its pulsating colour, we should then realize what the  Chinese call music. Confucius said, \"When the music master Che  first entered on his office, the finish with the _Kwan-Ts'eu_  (Pan's-pipes) was magnificent--how it filled the ears!\" And  that is just what Chinese music aims to do, it \"fills the ears\"  and therefore is \"magnificent.\"[03]    With their views as to what constitutes the beautiful in music  it is not strange that the Chinese find our music detestable. It  goes too fast for them. They ask, \"Why play another entirely  different kind of sound until one has already enjoyed to  the full what has gone before?\" As they told Pere Amiot  many years ago: \"Our music penetrates through the ear to the  heart, and from the heart to the soul; that your music cannot  do.\" Amiot had played on a harpsichord some pieces by Rameau  (\"_Les Cyclopes_,\" \"_Les Charmes_,\" etc.) and much flute music,  but they could make nothing of it.    According to their conception of music, sounds must follow one  another slowly, in order to pass through the ears to the heart  and thence to the soul; therefore they went back with renewed  satisfaction to their long, monotonous chant accompanied by  a pulsating fog of clangour.    Some years ago, at the time of that sudden desire of China,  or more particularly of Li Hung Chang, to know more of  occidental civilization, some Chinese students were sent  by their government to Berlin to study music. After about a  month's residence in Berlin these students wrote to the Chinese  government asking to be recalled, as they said it would be  folly to remain in a barbarous country where even the most  elementary principles of music had not yet been grasped.    To go deeply into the more technical side of Chinese music  would be a thankless task, for in the Chinese character  the practical is entirely overshadowed by the speculative.  All kinds of fanciful names are given to the different tones,  and many strange ideas associated with them. Although our modern  chromatic scale (all but the last half-tone) is familiar to  them, they have never risen to a practical use of it even to  this day. The Chinese scale is now, as it always has been,  one of five notes to the octave, that is to say, our modern  major scale with the fourth and seventh omitted.    From a technical point of view, the instruments of bamboo attain  an importance above all other Chinese instruments. According  to the legend, the Pan's-pipes of bamboo regulated the tuning  of all other instruments, and as a matter of fact the pipe  giving the note F, the universal tonic, is the origin of  all measures also. For this pipe, which in China is called  the \"musical foot,\" is at the same time a standard measure,  holding exactly twelve hundred millet seeds, and long enough  for one hundred millet seeds to stand end on end within it.    In concluding this consideration of the music of the  Chinese, I would draw attention to the unceasing repetition  which constitutes a prominent feature in all barbarous or  semi-barbarous music. In the \"Hymn of the Ancestors\" this  endless play on three or four notes is very marked.        [Figure 02]    In other songs it is equally apparent.        [Figure 03] etc.        [Figure 04]        [Figure 05] etc.    This characteristic is met with in the music of the American  Indians, also in American street songs, in fact in all music of  a primitive nature, just as our school children draw caricatures  similar to those made by great chiefs and medicine men in the  heart of Africa, and, similarly, the celebrated \"graffiti\"  of the Roman soldiers were precisely of the same nature as  the beginnings of Egyptian art. In art, the child is always  a barbarian more or less, and all strong emotion acting on  a naturally weak organism or a primitive nature brings the  same result, namely, that of stubborn repetition of one idea.  An example of this is Macbeth, who, in the very height of his  passion, stops to juggle with the word \"sleep,\" and in spite  of the efforts of his wife, who is by far the more civilized  of the two, again and again recurs to it, even though he  is in mortal danger. When Lady Macbeth at last breaks down,  she also shows the same trait in regard to her bloodstained  hands. It is not so far from Scotland to the Polar regions,  and there we find that when Kane captured a young Eskimo and  kept him on his ship, the only sign of life the prisoner gave  was to sing over and over to himself the following:        [Figure 06]    Coming back again to civilization, we find Tennyson's Elaine, in  her grief, repeating, incessantly the words, \"Must I then die.\"    The music of the Siamese, Burmese, Javanese, and Japanese has  much in common with that of the Chinese, the difference between  the first two and the last named being mainly in the absence  of the _king_, or musical stones, or rather the substitution  of sets of drums in place of it. For instance, the Burmese  drum-organ, as it is called, consists of twenty-one drums  of various sizes hung inside a great hoop. Their gong-organ  consists of fifteen or more gongs of different sizes strung  inside a hoop in the same manner. The player takes his place  in the middle of the hoop and strikes the drums or gongs  with a kind of stick. These instruments are largely used in  processions, being carried by two men, just as a sedan chair is  borne; the player, in order to strike all the gongs and bells,  must often walk backwards, or strike them behind his back.    In Javanese and Burmese music these sets of gongs and drums are  used incessantly, and form a kind of high-pitched, sustained  tone beneath which the music is played or sung.    In Siamese music the wind instruments have a prominent  place. After having heard the Siamese Royal Orchestra a number  of times in London, I came to the conclusion that the players  on the different instruments _improvise_ their parts, the only  rule being the general character of the melodies to be played,  and the finishing together. The effect of the music was that  of a contrapuntal nightmare, hideous to a degree which one who  has not heard it cannot conceive. Berlioz, in his \"Soirees de  l'orchestre,\" well described its effect when he said:        \"After the first sensation of horror which one cannot      repress, one feels impelled to laugh, and this hilarity      can only be controlled by leaving the hall. So long      as these impossible sounds continue, the fact of their      being gravely produced, and in all sincerity _admired_      by the players, makes the 'concert' appear inexpressibly      'comic.'\"    The Japanese had the same Buddhistic disregard for euphony,  but they have adopted European ideas in music and are rapidly  becoming occidentalized from a musical point of view. Their  principal instruments are the _koto_ and the _samisen_. The  former is similar to the Chinese _che_, and is a kind of large  zither with thirteen strings, each having a movable bridge by  means of which the pitch of the string may be raised or lowered.  The _samisen_ is a kind of small banjo, and probably originated  in the Chinese _kin_.    From Buddhism to sun worship, from China to Peru and Mexico,  is a marked change, but we find strange resemblances in the  music of these peoples, seeming almost to corroborate the  theory that the southern American races may be traced back to  the extreme Orient. We remember that in the Chinese sacred  chants--\"official\" music as one may call it--all the notes  were of exactly the same length. Now Garcilaso de la Vega  (1550), in his \"Commentarios Reales,\" tells us that unequal  time was unknown in Peru, that all the notes in a song were  of exactly the same length. He further tells us that in his  time the voice was but seldom heard in singing, and that  all the songs were played on the flute, the words being so  well known that the melody of the flute immediately suggested  them. The Peruvians were essentially a pipe race, while, on the  other hand, the instruments of the Mexicans were of the other  extreme, all kinds of drums, copper gongs, rattles, musical  stones, cymbals, bells, etc., thus completing the resemblance  to Chinese art. In Prescott's \"Conquest of Peru\" we may read  of the beautiful festival of Raymi, or adoration of the sun,  held at the period of the summer solstice. It describes how the  Inca and his court, followed by the whole population of the  city, assembled at early dawn in the great square of Cuzco,  and how, at the appearance of the first rays of the sun,  a great shout would go up, and thousands of wind instruments  would break forth into a majestic song of adoration. That the  Peruvians were a gentler nation than the Mexicans can be seen  from their principal instrument, the pipe.    While it has been strenuously denied that on such occasions  human sacrifices were offered in Peru, the Mexicans, that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16358"],[0,"The English Gipsies and Their Language (#11)"],[1,"of England had, not a peculiar cant, but a special  _language_.    And now for the letters.  One day Ward'engro of the K'allis's Gav, asked  me to write him a letter to his daughter, in Rommany.  So I began to  write from his dictation.  But being, like all his race, unused to  literary labour, his lively imagination continually led him astray, and  as I found amusement in his so doing, it proved to be an easy matter to  induce him to wander off into scenes of gipsy life, which, however  edifying they might be to my reader, would certainly not have the charm  of novelty to the black-eyed lady to whom they were supposed to be  addressed.  However, as I read over from time to time to my Rommany chal  what I had written, his delight in actually hearing his own words read  from writing, partook of all the pride of successful authorship--it was,  my dear sir, like your delight over your first proof sheet.    Well, this was the letter.  A translation will be found following it.    THE PANNI GAV, _Dec_. 16, 1871.    MY KAMLI CHAVI,--Kushti bak!  My cammoben to turo mush an' turo dadas an'  besto bak.

He lelled the juva to the wardo,  and just before she welled odoi, she hatched her wast in her poachy, an'  chiv it avree, and the prastramengro hatched it apre.  So they bitchered  her for shurabun.    (Here my Gipsy suggested that _stardo_ or _staramangro_ might be used for  greater elegance, in place of shurabun.)

MY DEAR DAUGHTER,--Good luck! my love to your husband and your father,  and best luck!  We've had bad fortune, my sister has been sick this here  week, we're doing very badly and could not get any money.  Your two  brothers are doing well, running about the country selling things.  Your  old uncle came to his sister and stayed three days, and went away like an  old dog and never gave me a penny.    Nothing much new.  A girl here took a watch the other day from another  girl, and the one who lost it said: \"Give it back to me and I won't hurt  you.\"  But the other girl said \"No,\" and so they sent for the constable.  He took the girl to the station (or carriage), and just before she got  there she put her hand in her pocket and threw it away, and the policeman  picked it up.  So they sent her to prison.    I have no horse, and can't get any money to buy _none_.  My dear  daughter, if you could send me a few pounds it would be agreeable.  I  carry my _traps_ on my back now.  I saw my uncle the other day among a  lot of Gipsies, all drinking.  There were the women fighting there, and  the men fighting, and there was a great _shindy_, some with black eyes,  and some with heads cut so that the blood ran down on the road.  There  were two or three pounds to pay in the morning for the horses and asses  that were in the pound.    Your brother has got a capital horse that can go along the road nicely.  L---, too, has a large fine horse.  He went to the fair in --- with a  broken-winded horse and a glandered.  You could have killed that horse  and nobody said a word to you.  I gave it some lard to stop his  breathing, and I sold it for nine pound to a gentleman whom you know  well.    Lotty was at the fair telling fortunes to the ladies.  She got some  excellent food, and her apron was quite full, when she saw her husband  and cried out: \"Come here!  I've got some nice victuals!\"  She said to a  girl: \"Put you money in your hand and I'll tell you your fortune.\"  And  she took half a sovereign from the lady.  She told her: \"You love a  gentleman who is far away.  He is dark, and there is another gentleman, a  fair-haired man that loves you, and you'll soon get a letter.  You'll  marry before two years, and be the mother of three children.\"    There was a horse going with a waggon along the road; and I saw a youth,  and asked him, \"How much money?\" (for the horse), and he replied to me,  \"Ten pounds.\"  I said, \"Is that your horse?\"  \"Yes.\"  Well, a Gipsy gave  him ten pounds for the horse, and sold it for twelve pounds to a great  gentleman.  It was a good black horse, with a (handsome) strong leg  (literally large), but it had a bad foot; it was the _near_ foot, and it  was a kicker.  He gave it some opium medicament to keep quiet (literally  to stop there), and held his rein (_i.e_., trotted him so as to show his  pace, and conceal his faults) on the road.    At the cock-shy a gentleman came, and Wantelo halloed out, \"Three sticks  for a penny, eighteen for a sixpence!\"  And the gentleman took a stick,  and we had five shillings for three dozen throws!  The gentleman played  well, and got five cocoanuts, and took us to his carriage and gave me  three glasses of brandy, so that I was almost drunk.  He was a good  gentleman, and his lady was as good as her husband.    There was another man playing; and I said, \"Set the sticks more back, set  'em there; don't go further or he'll get all the things!  Set 'em back!\"  A Gipsy girl talked to the gentlemen (_i.e_., persuaded them to play),  and got fifteen shillings from one.  And no more to-day from your dear  brother,    M.    * * * * *    One thing in the foregoing letter is worth noting.  Every remark or  incident occurring in it is literally true--drawn from life--_pur et  simple_.  It is, indeed, almost the _resume_ of the entire life of many  poor Gipsies during the summer.  And I may add that the language in which  it is written, though not the \"deep\" or grammatical Gipsy, in which no  English words occur--as for instance in the Lord's Prayer, as given by Mr  Borrow in his appendix to the Gipsies in Spain {70}--is still really a  fair specimen of the Rommany of the present day, which is spoken at races  by cock-shysters and fortune-tellers.    The \"Water Village,\" from which it is dated, is the generic term among  Gipsies for all towns by the sea-side.  The phrase _kushto_ (or  _kushti_), _bak_!--\"good luck!\" is after \"_Sarishan_!\" or \"how are you?\"  the common greeting among Gipsies.  The fight is from life and to the  life; and the \"two or three pounds to pay in the morning for the horses  and asses that got impounded,\" indicates its magnitude.  To have a beast  in pound in consequence of a frolic, is a common disaster in Gipsy life.    During the dictation of the foregoing letter, my Gipsy paused at the word  \"broken-winded horse,\" when I asked him how he could stop the heavy  breathing?    \"With ballovas (or lard and starch)--long enough to sell it.\"    \"But how would you sell a glandered horse?\"    Here he described, with great ingenuity, the manner in which he would  _tool_ or manage the horse--an art in which Gipsies excel all the world  over--and which, as Mr Borrow tells us, they call in Spain \"_de  pacuaro_,\" which is pure Persian.
