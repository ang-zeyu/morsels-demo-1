Three divine and heroic cycles of myths are known in Ireland, one  telling of the Tuatha De Danann, the others of Cuchulainn and of the  Fians. They are distinct in character and contents, but the gods of the  first cycle often help the heroes of the other groups, as the gods of  Greece and India assisted the heroes of the epics. We shall see that  some of the personages of these cycles may have been known in Gaul; they  are remembered in Wales, but, in the Highlands, where stories of  Cuchulainn and Fionn are still told, the Tuatha De Danann are less known  now than in 1567, when Bishop Carsewell lamented the love of the  Highlanders for \"idle, turbulent, lying, worldly stories concerning the  Tuatha Dedanans.\"[153]    As the new Achaean religion in Greece and the Vedic sacred books of India  regarded the aboriginal gods and heroes as demons and goblins, so did  Christianity in Ireland sometimes speak of the older gods there. On the  other hand, it was mainly Christian scribes who changed the old  mythology into history, and made the gods and heroes kings. Doubtless  myths already existed, telling of the descent of rulers and people from  divinities, just as the Gauls spoke of their descent from Dispater, or  as the Incas of Peru, the Mikados of Japan, and the kings of Uganda  considered themselves offspring of the gods. This is a universal  practice, and made it the more easy for Christian chroniclers to  transmute myth into history. In Ireland, as elsewhere, myth doubtless  told of monstrous races inhabiting the land in earlier days, of the  strife of the aborigines and incomers, and of their gods, though the  aboriginal gods may in some cases have been identified with Celtic gods,  or worshipped in their own persons. Many mythical elements may therefore  be looked for in the euhemerised chronicles of ancient Ireland. But the  chroniclers themselves were but the continuers of a process which must  have been at work as soon as the influence of Christianity began to be  felt.[154] Their passion, however, was to show the descent of the Irish  and the older peoples from the old Biblical personages, a process dear  to the modern Anglo-Israelite, some of whose arguments are based on the  wild romancing of the chroniclers.    Various stories were told of the first peopling of Ireland. Banba, with  two other daughters of Cain, arrived with fifty women and three men,  only to die of the plague. Three fishermen next discovered Ireland, and  \"of the island of Banba of Fair Women with hardihood they took  possession.\" Having gone to fetch their wives, they perished in the  deluge at Tuath Inba.[155] A more popular account was that of the coming  of Cessair, Noah's granddaughter, with her father, husband, a third man,  Ladru, \"the first dead man of Erin,\" and fifty damsels. Her coming was  the result of the advice of a _laimh-dhia_, or \"hand-god,\" but their  ship was wrecked, and all save her husband, Finntain, who survived for  centuries, perished in the flood.[156] Cessair's ship was less  serviceable than her grandparent's! Followed the race of Partholan, \"no  wiser one than the other,\" who increased on the land until plague swept  them away, with the exception of Tuan mac Caraill, who after many  transformations, told the story of Ireland to S. Finnen centuries  after.[157] The survival of Finntain and Tuan, doubles of each other,  was an invention of the chroniclers, to explain the survival of the  history of colonists who had all perished. Keating, on the other hand,  rejecting the sole survivor theory as contradictory to Scripture,  suggests that \"aerial demons,\" followers of the invaders, revealed all  to the chroniclers, unless indeed they found it engraved with \"an iron  pen and lead in the rocks.\"[158]    Two hundred years before Partholan's coming, the Fomorians had  arrived,[159] and they and their chief Cichol Gricenchos fought  Partholan at Mag Itha, where they were defeated. Cichol was footless,  and some of his host had but one arm and one leg.[160] They were demons,  according to the chroniclers, and descendants of the luckless Ham.  Nennius makes Partholan and his men the first Scots who came from Spain  to Ireland. The next arrivals were the people of Nemed who returned to  Spain, whence they came (Nennius), or died to a man (Tuan). They also  were descendants of the inevitable Noah, and their sojourn in Ireland  was much disturbed by the Fomorians who had recovered from their defeat,  and finally overpowered the Nemedians after the death of Nemed.[161]  From Tory Island the Fomorians ruled Ireland, and forced the Nemedians  to pay them annually on the eve of Samhain (Nov. 1st) two-thirds of  their corn and milk and of the children born during the year. If the  Fomorians are gods of darkness, or, preferably, aboriginal deities, the  tribute must be explained as a dim memory of sacrifice offered at the  beginning of winter when the powers of darkness and blight are in the  ascendant. The Fomorians had a tower of glass in Tory Island. This was  one day seen by the Milesians, to whom appeared on its battlements what  seemed to be men. A year after they attacked the tower and were  overwhelmed in the sea.[162] From the survivors of a previously wrecked  vessel of their fleet are descended the Irish. Another version makes the  Nemedians the assailants. Thirty of them survived their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14674"],[0,"Ten Great Religions: An Essay in Comparative Theology (#11)"],[1,"master minds of our  race. The supposition that a man of low morals or small intellect, an  impostor or an enthusiast, could influence the world, is a theory which  is an insult to human nature. The time for such theories has happily gone  by. We now know that nothing can come of nothing,--that a fire of straw  may make a bright blaze, but must necessarily soon go out. A light which  illuminates centuries must be more than an ignis fatuus. Accordingly we  should approach Confucius with respect, and expect to find something good  and wise in his writings. It is only a loving spirit which will enable us  to penetrate the difficulties which surround the study, and to apprehend  something of the true genius of the man and his teachings. As there is no  immediate danger of becoming his followers, we can see no objections to  such a course, which also appears to be a species of mental hospitality,  eminently in accordance with the spirit of our own Master.    Confucius belongs to that small company of select ones whose lives have  been devoted to the moral elevation of their fellow-men. Among them he  stands high, for he sought to implant the purest principles of religion  and morals in the character of the whole people, and succeeded in doing  it. To show that this was his purpose it will be necessary to give a brief  sketch of his life.    His ancestors were eminent statesmen and soldiers in the small country of  Loo, then an independent kingdom, now a Chinese province. The year of his  birth was that in which Cyrus became king of Persia. His father, one of  the highest officers of the kingdom, and a brave soldier, died when  Confucius was three years old. He was a studious boy, and when fifteen  years old had studied the five sacred books called Kings. He was married  at the age of nineteen, and had only one son by his only wife. This son  died before Confucius, leaving as his posterity a single grandchild, from  whom the great multitudes of his descendants now in China were derived.  This grandson was second only to Confucius in wisdom, and was the teacher  of the illustrious Mencius.    The first part of the life of Confucius was spent in attempting to reform  the abuses of society by means of the official stations which he held, by  his influence with princes, and by travelling and intercourse with men.  The second period was that in which he was recalled from his travels to  become a minister in his native country, the kingdom of Loo. Here he  applied his theories of government, and tested their practicability. He  was then fifty years old. His success was soon apparent in the growing  prosperity of the whole people. Instead of the tyranny which before  prevailed, they were now ruled according to his idea of good  government,--that of the father of a family. Confidence was restored to  the public mind, and all good influences followed. But the tree was not  yet deeply enough rooted to resist accidents, and all his wise  arrangements were suddenly overthrown by the caprice of the monarch, who,  tired of the austere virtue of Confucius, suddenly plunged into a career  of dissipation. Confucius resigned his office, and again became a  wanderer, but now with a new motive. He had before travelled to learn, now  he travelled to teach. He collected disciples around him, and, no longer  seeking to gain the ear of princes, he diffused his ideas among the common  people by means of his disciples, whom he sent out everywhere to  communicate his doctrines. So, amid many vicissitudes of outward fortune,  he lived till he was seventy-three years old. In the last years of his  life he occupied himself in publishing his works, and in editing the  Sacred Books. His disciples had become very numerous, historians  estimating them at three thousand, of whom five hundred had attained to  official station, seventy-two had penetrated deeply into his system, and  ten, of the highest class of mind and character, were continually near his  person. Of these Hwuy was especially valued by him, as having early  attained superior virtue. He frequently referred to him in his  conversations. \"I saw him continually advance,\" said he, \"but I never saw  him stop in the path of knowledge.\" Again he says: \"The wisest of my  disciples, having one idea, understands two. Hwuy, having one understands  ten.\" One of the select ten disciples, Tszee-loo, was rash and impetuous  like the Apostle Peter. Another, Tszee-Kung, was loving and tender like  the Apostle John; he built a house near the grave of Confucius, wherein to  mourn for him after his death.    The last years of the life of Confucius were devoted to editing the  Sacred Books, or Kings. As we now have them they come from him. Authentic  records of Chinese history extend back to 2357 B.C., while the Chinese  philosophy originated with Fuh-he, who lived about 3327 B.C. He it was who  substituted writing for the knotted strings which before formed the only  means of record. He was also the author of the Eight Diagrams,--each  consisting of three lines, half of which are whole and half broken in  two,--which by their various combinations are supposed to represent the  active and passive principles of the universe in all their essential  forms. Confucius edited the Yih-King, the Shoo-King, the She-King, and the  Le-Ke, which constitute the whole of the ancient literature of China which  has come down to posterity.[1] The Four Books, which contain the doctrines  of Confucius, and of his school, were not written by himself, but composed  by others after his death.    One of these is called the \"Immutable Mean,\" and its object is to show  that virtue consists in avoiding extremes. Another--the Lun-Yu, or  Analects--contains the conversation or table-talk of Confucius, and  somewhat resembles the Memorabilia of Xenophon and Boswell's Life of  Johnson.[12]    The life of Confucius was thus devoted to communicating to the Chinese  nation a few great moral and religious principles, which he believed would  insure the happiness of the people. His devotion to this aim appears in  his writings. Thus he says:--    \"At fifteen years I longed for wisdom. At thirty my mind was fixed in the  pursuit of it. At forty I saw clearly certain principles. At fifty I  understood the rule given by heaven. At sixty everything I heard I easily  understood. At seventy the desires of my heart no longer transgressed the  law.\"    \"If in the morning I hear about the right way, and in the evening I die, I  can be happy.\"    He says of himself: \"He is a man who through his earnestness in seeking  knowledge forgets his food, and in his joy for having found it loses all  sense of his toil, and thus occupied is unconscious that he has almost  reached old age.\"    Again: \"Coarse rice for food, water to drink, the bended arm for a  pillow,--happiness may be enjoyed even with these; but without virtue both  riches and honor seem to me like the passing cloud.\"    \"Grieve not that men know not you; grieve that you know not men.\"    \"To rule with equity is like the North Star, which is fixed, and all the  rest go round it.\"    \"The essence of knowledge is, having it, to apply it; not having it, to  confess your ignorance.\"    \"Worship as though the Deity were present.\"    \"If my mind is not engaged in my worship, it is as though I worshipped  not.\"    \"Formerly, in hearing men, I heard their words, and gave them credit for  their conduct; now I hear their words, and observe their conduct.\"    \"A man's life depends on virtue; if a bad man lives, it is only by good  fortune.\"    \"Some proceed blindly to action, without knowledge; I hear much, and  select the best course.\"    He was once found fault with, when in office, for not opposing the  marriage of a ruler with a distant relation, which was an offence against  Chinese propriety. He said: \"I am a happy man; if I have a fault, men  observe it.\"    Confucius was humble. He said: \"I cannot bear to hear myself called equal  to the sages and the good. All that can be said of me is, that I study  with delight the conduct of the sages, and instruct men without weariness  therein.\"    \"The good man is serene,\" said he, \"the bad always in fear.\"    \"A good man regards the ROOT; he fixes the root, and all else flows out of  it. The root is filial piety; the fruit brotherly love.\"    \"There may be fair words and an humble countenance when there is little  real virtue.\"    \"I daily examine myself in a threefold manner: in my transactions with  men, if I am upright; in my intercourse with friends, if I am faithful;  and whether I illustrate the teachings of my master in my conduct.\"    \"Faithfulness and sincerity are the highest things.\"    \"When you transgress, do not fear to return.\"    \"Learn the past and you will know the future.\"    The great principles which he taught were chiefly based on family  affection and duty. He taught kings that they were to treat their  subjects as children, subjects to respect the kings as parents; and these  ideas so penetrated the national mind, that emperors are obliged to seem  to govern thus, even if they do not desire it. Confucius was a teacher of  reverence,--reverence for God, respect for parents, respect and reverence  for the past and its legacies, for the great men and great ideas of former  times. He taught men also to regard each other as brethren, and even the  golden rule, in its negative if not its positive form, is to be found in  his writings.    Curiously enough, this teacher of reverence was distinguished by a  remarkable lump on the top of his head, where the phrenologists have  placed the organ of veneration.[13] Rooted in his organization, and  strengthened by all his convictions, this element of adoration seemed to  him the crown of the whole moral nature of man. But, while full of  veneration, he seems to have been deficient in the sense of spiritual  things. A personal God was unknown to him; so that his worship was  directed, not to "]]]
