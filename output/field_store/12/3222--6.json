[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18790"],[0,"The Insect Folk (#11)"],[1,"ings, do  you not?    Are the four wings alike?    No, John says, the upper ones are narrow and stiff and serve as wing  covers.    The inner ones are broader and more delicate. They fold up when not in  use and are used to fly with.    Very good indeed, John. Now I will tell you something. The Orthoptera  all have mouth parts made to bite with. They do not bite anything but  what they eat, however. They are quite harmless so far as we are  concerned.    The young Orthoptera look like the old ones, only they have no wings.  They hatch out of the egg with a head, a six-legged thorax, and an  abdomen.    Now, come, let us look at all of our orthopterous friends again,  cockroaches first.    [Illustration]    How do they get about, John?    Yes, indeed, they run, the rascals. They run fast too. They are flat and  their six legs are very much alike. They are well built for running and  hiding in cracks.    Suppose we call them the _Running Orthoptera_.    Now, look at our mantis.    He does not run very much. How is he different from the others?    Ah, yes, he has big front legs, and little Nell says he grabs things  with them.    [Illustration]    So he does. Now, what shall we call these grabbers?    The Grabbing Orthoptera, Ned says.    Suppose we say instead the _Grasping Orthoptera_, because grasping  sounds a little better than grabbing. Do you not think so?    [Illustration]    Now for Mr. Walking Stick.    We cannot very well call him a member of the Running Orthoptera, can we?    Ah, Mollie has it. We must call his kind the _Walking Orthoptera_.    His six legs are all long and slender, and he moves them slowly.    [Illustration]    Now for those fellows with the long hind legs, the locusts and katydids  and crickets. Yes, all of you are ready to name them.    We call them--what?    May says, the Hopping Orthoptera.    John thinks Jumping Orthoptera would sound better.    And that is what we name them, the _Jumping Orthoptera_.    How many kinds of Jumping Orthoptera are we acquainted with, Ned? Now,  think before you speak.    He says we know the shorthorned grasshoppers, or locusts, the  longhorned, or meadow, grasshoppers, and the crickets.    Very well done, Ned.    May wants to know what has become of the katydids and the cricket-like  grasshoppers--she thinks Ned has left them out.    Ned says they belong to the longhorned grasshoppers.    Now you shall have a list of the Orthoptera that will help you to  remember them.    If we can group together things that are like each other, it is easier  to remember them.           ORDER ORTHOPTERA.          _Running Orthoptera._            Cockroaches, Croton Bugs.        _Grasping Orthoptera._            Praying Mantis.        _Walking Orthoptera._            Walking Sticks.        _Jumping Orthoptera._            Shorthorned Grasshoppers, or Locusts.            Longhorned, or Meadow, Grasshoppers.            Crickets.    There are a great many species of Orthoptera in the world, and we have  seen but a very few of them.    But I can tell you, we feel a little better acquainted with you  orthopterous fellows than we did.    The dragon fly says we have not given him a place.    But, dear dragon fly, you belong to another family. You are not an  orthopterous insect.    Your order is called the ODO-NA-TA.    The wings of the Odonata are very different from those of the  Orthoptera.    [Illustration]    You remember how they are?    Yes, Ned, they are stiff and covered with a close network of fine veins,  and all four of them are alike.    No wing covers, you see.    I do not know why they have the name Odonata.    The young Odonata are not like their parents, excepting that they have a  head, a thorax with six legs, and an abdomen. But they certainly do not  look like their parents!    No, John, the May flies do not belong to the Odonata. Their wings are  quite different.    [Illustration]    Do you not remember how small the hind wings are?    The name of their order is EPH-E-MER-I-DA.    There is a big name for a little insect!    It comes from the Greek word _ephemeros_, and you know what it means.    What? Has everybody forgotten about the dainty little ephemerae, that  live but a day?    That is what _ephemeros_ means, lasting but a day.    The stone flies have four wings, but they are not like those of the  Odonata, or of the Ephemerida.    Do you remember how the hind wings are folded?    Yes, May, in plaits, so these are the plaited wings, or  PLE-COP-TE-RA, from _pteran_, a wing, and _plecos_, plaited.    The little silver fish, as you remember, has no wings at all,  so its order is called THY-SA-NU-RA, from its bristle tail,  _thysanos_, in Greek, meaning a tassel, and _oura_, the tail.          HEMIPTERA          THE GREAT BUG FAMILY    [Illustration]      Now, my children, do you know what a bug is? Most people do not.    They call every insect a \"bug,\" but bugs are bugs, flies are flies, ants  are ants, and neither flies nor ants are bugs.    Indeed, no insects are bugs--excepting just bugs!    Our croton bugs are not really bugs. They do not belong to the bug  family.    [Illustration]    A bug has four wings--when it has any.    But its wings are not like those of the Orthoptera or Odonata or  Ephemerida or Plecoptera.    Some bugs have no wings.    Young bugs are like old bugs, only smaller, and they have no wings.    You remember the Orthoptera and Odonata bite their food.    They chew it up and swallow it.    Bugs do not bite, they suck. Their mouth parts are often grown together  in the form of a tube that is sometimes very sharp.    They stick these sharp tubes or beaks into their food, and suck it up.          THE WATER BOATMAN      What, May; you want to see a bug? Well, that is easy enough.    Here is one in this pond at our feet. Do you know it?    [Illustration]    Yes, John; it is the water boatman.    Nell says she doesn't see it.    There, Nell, that little thing that shines like silver under the water.  It is clinging to a weed.    No, we cannot see it very well unless we catch it.    Ned, do you think you can be spry enough to scoop it out with the net?    There, he has it,--no, it is off.    Well, we shall never see that one again; but here, in this corner of the  pond, see, several of them.    [Illustration]    Now don't be in too great a hurry, Ned; they are hard to catch.    He has it!    Here, don't touch it,--bugs are biters, remember.    Put it in this tumbler of water, and clap the cover over  it--quick--so!--now we have it.    What is that, Mollie? I just said bugs do not bite, and now I call them  biters?    I don't wonder you are puzzled.    They do _not_ bite, but they pierce with their mouth tubes, and that  feels just as though they bit us. So we commonly speak of bugs as  biting.    If you wish to be very exact, we will hereafter speak of bugs as  piercing or sucking.    Now, Mr. Water Boatman, we are going to have a good look at you.    Nell says it is not like silver any more, but just a little black and  gray speckled bug.    That is because it is now on top of the water. When it goes under it is  surrounded with a layer of air, and that is what makes it look as though  it had on a silver dress.    May wants to know how it manages to take a layer of air down under the  water. If you were to look at it with a magnifying glass, May, you would  see it is covered with fine hairs; the air becomes entangled in these  hairs. Do you not remember how the leaf of the jewel weed, or  touch-me-not, as it is also called, shines when you plunge it in water?  It, too, is covered with fine hairs that hold air. Many leaves shine in  this way when put under water, and always because of the fine hairs  that prevent the air from being pushed out by the water. You see the  hairs on the bugs serve the same purpose as those on the leaves; they  hold fast the air.    Our water boatman breathes this air that surrounds him.    You know how insects breathe do you not?    Dear me, then I shall have to tell you.    They have no lungs; of course, so they cannot breathe with lungs as we  do.    Take a long breath--see how your chest rises--that is because you filled  your lungs full of air.    Well, the insects have to breathe air.    Every living thing has to breathe air. Nothing in the world could live  without air.    Even plants breathe the air, you know.    Now, there is a little row of holes or pores along each side of the  abdomen of the insect.    These are the breathing pores. No, May, the insects do not breathe  through their mouths, they breathe through their sides.    [Illustration]    You can see the breathing pores, or spiracles, as they are called, very  plainly in many insects.    You can see them on the abdomen of the locust, and in some caterpillars  they are bright-colored spots.    There are spiracles on the sides of the thorax, too, but they do not  show so plainly as those on the abdomen.    The spiracles open into air tubes that carry air to the blood of the  insect.    [Illustration: _Spiracles_]    If you watch a grasshopper or a bee, you can plainly see it breathe. The  abdomen moves in the bee as though it were panting. These movements of  the abdomen cause the air to go in and out. All insects move their  abdomens to send the air in and out, but it does not show plainly in all  of them, for, though insects need air, some of them can get along with  very little.    Yes, John, insects have blood. It is not just like our blood, but still  it is blood.    It is not generally red in color, though sometimes it is reddish, and  sometimes it is brown, or violet, or even bright green.    Yes, that seems strange to you, but you remember how ears are ears, and  serve to hear with, no matter where on the body of the creature they are  located. So blood is blood, and serves the purpose of blood, no matter  what its color. The blood of some insects has a very bad odor, and in  the case of certain beetles, when they are disturbed,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18794"],[0,"Three Years' War (#11)"],[1," 28: This harbour, then the only harbour in South Africa open  to us, was subsequently forbidden us by the Portuguese Government, whose  officials even went so far as to arrest eight hundred of our burghers  (who, for want of horses, had taken refuge in Portuguese territory), and  to send them to Portugal. The ports of German West Africa cannot be  counted among those which were available for us. Not only were they too  far from us to be of any service, but also, in order to reach them, it  would have been necessary to go through English territory, for they were  separated from us by Griqualand West, Bechuanaland, and isolated  portions of Cape Colony. We had, therefore, during the latter portion of  the war, to depend for supplies upon what little we were able to capture  from the enemy.]          CHAPTER VIII    The Burghers Receive Permission to Return to their Homes      Thus Bloemfontein had fallen into the hands of the English; but whatever  valuables it contained were spared by the enemy. I did not myself  consider the place much superior to any other town, and I would not have  thought it a matter of any great importance if it had been destroyed.  Still, I felt it to be very regrettable that the town should have been  surrendered without a shot.    How can I describe my feelings when I saw Bloemfontein in the hands of  the English? It was enough to break the heart of the bravest man amongst  us. Even worse than the fall of our capital was the fact that, as was  only to be expected, the burghers had become entirely disheartened; and  it seemed as if they were incapable now of offering any further  resistance. The commandos were completely demoralized. Indeed! the  burghers from Fauresmith and Jacobsdal had already returned home from  Poplar Grove without asking for permission to do so; and now all the  others were hurrying back in the greatest disorder to their own  districts.    I felt sure that Lord Roberts' troops would remain for some time in the  capital, in order to obtain the rest they must have sorely needed. And I  now asked myself what I could do whilst the English were remaining  inactive. For notwithstanding all that had happened, I had not for a  single moment the thought of surrender. It seemed to me that my best  course was to allow the burghers, who had now been away from their  families for six months, an opportunity to take breath![29]    After everything had been arranged I went to Brandfort and thence to  Kroonstad, at which place I was to meet President Steyn, who had left  Bloemfontein the evening before it fell.    On my road to Kroonstad I fell in with General P.J. Joubert, who had  come to the Free State, hoping to be able to discover some method for  checking the advance of Lord Roberts. He was anything but pleased to  hear that I had given my men permission to remain at home till the 25th  of March.    \"Do you mean to tell me,\" he asked, \"that you are going to give the  English a free hand, whilst your men take their holidays?\"    \"I cannot catch a hare, General, with unwilling dogs,\" I made reply.    But this did not satisfy the old warrior at all. At last I said:    \"You know the Afrikanders as well as I do, General. It is not our fault  that they don't know what discipline means. Whatever I had said or done,  the burghers would have gone home; but I'll give you my word that those  who come back will fight with renewed courage.\"    I knew very well that there were some who would not return, but I  preferred to command ten men who were willing to fight, rather than a  hundred who shirked their duties.    Meanwhile President Steyn had proclaimed Kroonstad as the seat of the  Government, so that in future all matters were to be settled there.    On March 20th, 1900, a war council was held, which was attended by  from fifty to sixty officers. President Steyn presided; and there  sat beside him that simple statesman, grown grey in his country's  service--President Kruger.    The chief officers at this council were Commandant General Joubert,  Generals De la Rey, Philip Botha, Froneman, C.P. Cronje, J.B. Wessels,  and myself. A number of the members of both Governments also put in an  appearance at this meeting.    Do not let it be imagined that the object we had in view was to come to  an agreement on any peace proposal made by the English. Nothing could  have been further from our minds than this. Lord Salisbury's letter to  our two Presidents, demanding unconditional surrender, had rendered any  thought of peace impossible. On the contrary, we were concerned to  discover the best method of continuing the war. We knew, I need scarcely  say, that humanly speaking ultimate victory for us was out of the  question--that had been clear from the very beginning. For how could our  diminutive army hope to stand against the overwhelming numbers at the  enemy's command? Yet we had always felt that no one is worthy of the  name of man who is not ready to vindicate the right, be the odds what  they may. We knew also, that the Afrikanders, although devoid of all  military discipline, had the idea of independence deeply rooted in their  hearts, and that they were worthy to exist as a Free Nation under a  Republican form of Government.    I shall not enter upon all that happened at that meeting. I shall merely  note here that besides deciding to continue the war more energetically  than ever, we agreed unanimously that the great waggon-camps should be  done away with, and that henceforth only horse-commandos should be  employed. The sad experience we had gained from six months' warfare,  and more especially the great misfortune that had overtaken the big  waggon-camp of General Cronje, were our reasons for this new  regulation.[30]    I left the meeting firmly determined that, come what might, I should  never allow another waggon-camp. But, as the reader will see before he  has concluded the perusal of these pages, it was not until many months  had elapsed that the waggons were finally suppressed. All the mischief  that they were destined to bring upon the African Nation was not yet  completed.    One of the effects of this council was to produce an unusually good  spirit among the officers and burghers. There was only one thought in my  mind, and only one word on every tongue: \"FORWARD!\"    I proceeded from Kroonstad to the railway bridge at Zand River, and  remained there until the 25th of March, when the commandos reassembled.  What I had foreseen occurred. The burghers were different men  altogether, and returned with renewed courage to the fight. They  streamed in such large numbers on this and the following days, that my  highest hopes were surpassed. It is true that certain burghers had  remained behind. Such was the case with the men from Fauresmith and  Jacobsdal, and with a large proportion of the commandos from  Philippolis, Smithfield, Wepener, and Bloemfontein. But with these  burghers I was unable to deal on account of Lord Roberts' Proclamations,  which made it impossible for me to compel the burghers to join the  commando; and I decided that I had better wait until I had done some  good work with the men I had, before I made any attempt to bring the  others back to the commando.    On the 25th of March we went to Brandfort. The arrival of the burghers  at the village doubled and even trebled its population. I was forced to  close the hotels, as I discovered that my men were being supplied with  drink. From this I do not wish the reader to infer that the Afrikanders  are drunkards, for this is far from being the case. On the contrary,  when compared with other nations, they are remarkable for their  sobriety, and it is considered by them a disgrace for a man to be drunk.    [Footnote 29: The men I still had with me belonged to commandos from  Bloemfontein, Ladybrand, Wepener, Ficksburg, Bethlehem and Winburg. They  were respectively under Commandants Piet Fourie, Crowther, Fouche, De  Villiers, Michal Prinsloo and Vilonel; and these Commandants took orders  from Vechtgeneraals J.B. Wessels, A.P. Cronje, C.C. Froneman, W. Kolbe  and Philip Botha.    The Colesberg and Stormberg commandos had received the order to go  northwards in the direction of Thaba'Nchu and Ladybrand. These commandos  also had been panic-stricken since General Cronje's surrender.    The Kroonstad, Heilbron, Harrismith and Vrede burghers, under  Commander-in-Chief Prinsloo, were directed to remain where they were,  and guard the Drakensberg.    General De la Rey followed my example, and gave his men permission to  return home for some time.]    [Footnote 30: This council also enacted that officers should be very  chary in accepting doctors' certificates. The old law had laid it down  that if a burgher produced a medical certificate, declaring him unfit  for duty, he should be exempted from service. That there had been a  grave abuse of this was the experience of almost every officer. There  were several very dubious cases; and it was curious to note how many  sudden attacks of heart disease occurred--if one were to credit the  medical certificates. I remember myself that on the 7th of March, when  the burghers fled from Poplar Grove, I had thrust upon me suddenly eight  separate certificates, which had all been issued that morning, each  declaring that some burgher or other was suffering from disease of the  heart. When the eighth was presented to me, and I found that it also  alleged the same complaint, I lost all patience, and let the doctor know  that was quite enough for one day. When this question of certificates  was discussed at the council, I suggested in joke that no certificate  should be accepted unless it was signed by three old women, as a  guarantee of good faith. The system had indeed been carried to such  lengths, and certificates had been issued right and left in such a  lavish manner, that one almost suspected that the English must have had  a hand in it!]          CHAPTER IX    Sanna's"]]]
