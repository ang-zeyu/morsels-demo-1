The son of a peasant or of some poor  wretch, who had begun life by keeping a register of the bread and  vegetables in some provincial government office, had been often known  to crown his long and successful career by exercising a kind of  vice-regency over the half of Egypt. His granaries overflowed with corn,  his storehouses were always full of gold, fine stuffs, and precious  vases, his stalls \"multiplied the backs\" of his oxen; the sons of his  early patrons, having now become in turn his _proteges_, did not venture  to approach him except with bowed head and bended knee.    No doubt the Amten whose tomb was removed to Berlin by Lepsius, and put  together piece by piece in the museum, was a _parvenu_ of this kind. He  was born rather more than four thousand years before our era under one  of the last kings of the IIIrd dynasty, and he lived until the reign of  the first king of the IVth dynasty, Snofrui. He probably came from the  Nome of the Bull, if not from Xois itself, in the heart of the Delta.  His father, the scribe Anupumonkhu, held, in addition to his office,  several landed estates, producing large returns; but his mother,  Nibsonit, who appears to have been merely a concubine, had no personal  fortune, and would have been unable even to give her child an education.  Anupumonkhu made himself entirely responsible for the necessary  expenses, \"giving him all the necessities of life, at a time when he had  not as yet either corn, barley, income, house, men or women servants,  or troops of asses, pigs, or oxen.\" As soon as he was in a condition to  provide for himself, his father obtained for him, in his native Nome,  the post of chief scribe attached to one of the \"localities\" which  belonged to the Administration of Provisions. On behalf of the Pharaoh,  the young man received, registered, and distributed the meat, cakes,  fruits, and fresh vegetables which constituted the taxes, all on his  own responsibility, except that he had to give an account of them to the  \"Director of the Storehouse\" who was nearest to him. We are not told how  long he remained in this occupation; we see merely that he was  raised successively to posts of an analogous kind, but of increasing  importance. The provincial offices comprised a small staff of _employes,  _ consisting always of the same officials:--a chief, whose ordinary  function was \"Director of the Storehouse;\" a few scribes to keep the  accounts, one or two of whom added to his ordinary calling that of  keeper of the archives; paid ushers to introduce clients, and, if need  be, to bastinado them summarily at the order of the \"director;\" lastly,  the \"strong of voice,\" the criers, who superintended the incomings and  outgoings, and proclaimed the account of them to the scribes to be noted  down forthwith. A vigilant and honest crier was a man of great value.    [Illustration: 068.jpg THE FUNERAL STELE OF THE TOMB OF AMTEN, THE  \"GRAND HUNTSMAN.\"]    He obliged the taxpayer not only to deliver the exact number of measures  prescribed as his quota, but also compelled him to deliver good measure  in each case; a dishonest crier, on the contrary, could easily favour  cheating, provided that he shared in the spoil. Amten was at once  \"crier\" and \"taxer of the colonists\" to the civil administrator of the  Xoite nome: he announced the names of the peasants and the payments they  made, then estimated the amount of the local tax which each, according  to his income, had to pay. He distinguished himself so pre-eminently in  these delicate duties, that the civil administrator of Xois made him one  of his subordinates. He became \"Chief of the Ushers,\" afterwards \"Master  Crier,\" then \"Director of all the King's flax\" in the Xoifce nome--an  office which entailed on him the supervision of the culture, cutting,  and general preparation of flax for the manufacture which was carried  on in Pharaoh's own domain. It was one of the highest offices in the  Provincial Administration, and Amten must have congratulated himself on  his appointment.    From that moment his career became a great one, and he advanced quickly.  Up to that time he had been confined in offices; he now left them to  perform more active service. The Pharaohs, extremely jealous of their  own authority, usually avoided placing at the head of the nomes in their  domain, a single ruler, who would have appeared too much like a prince;  they preferred having in each centre of civil administration, governors  of the town or province, as well as military commanders who were jealous  of one another, supervised one another, counterbalanced one another, and  did not remain long enough in office to become dangerous. Amten held all  these posts successively in most of the nomes situated in the centre or  to the west of the Delta. His first appointment was to the government  of the village of Pidosu, an unimportant post in itself, but one which  entitled him to a staff of office, and in consequence procured for him  one of the greatest indulgences of vanity that an Egyptian could enjoy.  The staff was, in fact, a symbol of command which only the nobles,  and the officials associated with the nobility, could carry without  transgressing custom; the assumption of it, as that of the sword with  us, showed every one that the bearer was a member of a privileged class.    [Illustration: 072.jpg STATUE OF AMTEN, FOUND IN HIS TOMB]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Lepsius, Denkm., ii. 120 a;       the original is in the Berlin Museum.    Amten was no sooner ennobled, than his functions began to expand;  villages were rapidly added to villages, then towns to towns, including  such an important one as Buto, and finally the nomes of the Harpoon, of  the Bull, of the Silurus, the western half of the Saite nome, the nome  of the Haunch, and a part of the Fayum came within his jurisdiction. The  western half of the Saite nome, where he long resided, corresponded with  what was called later the Libyan nome. It reached nearly from the apex  of the Delta to the sea, and was bounded on one side by the Canopic  branch of the Nile, on the other by the Libyan range; a part of the  desert as well as the Oases fell under its rule. It included among  its population, as did many of the provinces of Upper Egypt, regiments  composed of nomad hunters, who were compelled to pay their tribute  in living or dead game. Amten was metamorphosed into Chief Huntsman,  scoured the mountains with his men, and thereupon became one of the most  important personages in the defence of the country. The Pharaohs had  built fortified stations, and had from time to time constructed walls at  certain points where the roads entered the valley--at Syene, at Coptos,  and at the entrance to the Wady Tumilat. Amten having been proclaimed  \"Primate of the Western Gate,\" that is, governor of the Libyan marches,  undertook to protect the frontier against the wandering Bedouin from the  other side of Lake Mareotis. His duties as Chief Huntsman had been  the best preparation he could have had for this arduous task. They had  forced him to make incessant expeditions among the mountains, to explore  the gorges and ravines, to be acquainted with the routes marked out by  wells which the marauders were obliged to follow in their incursions,  and the pathways and passes by which they could descend into the plain  of the Delta; in running the game to earth, he had gained all the  knowledge needful for repulsing the enemy. Such a combination of  capabilities made Amten the most important noble in this part of Egypt.  When old age at last prevented him from leading an active life, he  accepted, by way of a pension, the governorship of the nome of  the Haunch: with civil authority, military command, local priestly  functions, and honorary distinctions, he lacked only one thing to make  him the equal of the nobles of ancient family, and that was permission  to bequeath without restriction his towns and offices to his children.    His private fortune was not as great as we might be led to think. He  inherited from his father only one estate, but had acquired twelve  others in the nomes of the Delta whither his successive appointments had  led him--namely, in the Saite, Xoite, and Letopolite nomes. He received  subsequently, as a reward for his services, two hundred portions of  cultivated land, with numerous peasants, both male and female, and an  income of one hundred loaves daily, a first charge upon the funeral  provision of Queen Hapunimait. He took advantage of this windfall to  endow his family suitably. His only son was already provided for, thanks  to the munificence of Pharaoh; he had begun his administrative career by  holding the same post of scribe, in addition to the office of provision  registrar, which his father had held, and over and above these he  received by royal grant, four portions of cornland with their population  and stock. Amten gave twelve portions to his other children and fifty to  his mother Nibsonit, by means of which she lived comfortably in her old  age, and left an annuity for maintaining worship at her tomb. He built  upon the remainder of the land a magnificent villa, of which he has  considerately left us the description. The boundary wall formed a square  of 350 feet on each face, and consequently contained a superficies of  122,500 square feet. The well-built dwelling-house, completely furnished  with all the necessities of life, was surrounded by ornamental and  fruit-bearing trees,--the common palm, the nebbek, fig trees, and  acacias; several ponds, neatly bordered with greenery, afforded a  habitat for aquatic birds; trellised vines, according to custom,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17323"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 3 (of 12) (#11)"],[1," the hero. It would appear even that Gilgames is       recognized from the beginning as King of Uruk, the well-       protected.    Ishtar saw him thus adorned, and the same passion consumed her which  inflames mortals.* \"To the love of Gilgames she raised her eyes, the  mighty Ishtar, and she said, 'Come, Gilgames, be my husband, thou! Thy  love, give it to me, as a gift to me, and thou shalt be my spouse, and  I shall be thy wife. I will place thee in a chariot of lapis and gold,  with golden wheels and mountings of onyx: thou shalt be drawn in it by  great lions, and thou shalt enter our house with the odorous incense of  cedar-wood. When thou shalt have entered our house, all the country by  the sea shall embrace thy feet, kings shall bow down before thee, the  nobles and the great ones, the gifts of the mountains and of the plain  they will bring to thee as tribute. Thy oxen shall prosper, thy sheep  shall be doubly fruitful, thy mules shall spontaneously come under the  yoke, thy chariot-horse shall be strong and shall galop, thy bull  under the yoke shall have no rival.'\" Gilgames repels this unexpected  declaration with a mixed feeling of contempt and apprehension: he abuses  the goddess, and insolently questions her as to what has become of her  mortal husbands during her long divine life. \"Tammuz, the spouse of thy  youth, thou hast condemned him to weep from year to year.** Nilala, the  spotted sparrow-hawk, thou lovedst him, afterward thou didst strike  him and break his wing: he continues in the wood and cries: 'O, my  wings!'*** Thou didst afterwards love a lion of mature strength, and  then didst cause him to be rent by blows, seven at a time.**** Thou  lovedst also a stallion magnificent in the battle; thou didst devote him  to death by the goad and whip: thou didst compel him to galop for ten  leagues, thou didst devote him to exhaustion and thirst, thou didst  devote to tears his mother Silili.         * Ishtar's declaration to Gilgames and the hero's reply have       been frequently translated and summarized since the       discovery of the poem. Smith thought to connect this episode       with the \"Descent of Ishtar to Hades,\" which we shall meet       with further on in this History, but his opinion is no       longer accepted. The \"Descent of Ishtar\" in its present       condition is the beginning of a magical formula: it has       nothing to do with the acts of Gilgames.         ** Tammuz-Adonis is the only one known to us among this long       list of the lovers of the goddess. The others must have been       fairly celebrated among the Chaldaeans, since the few words       devoted to each is sufficient to recall them to the memory       of the reader, but we have not as yet found anything       bearing upon their adventures in the table of the ancient       Chaldaeo-Assyrian classics, which had been copied out by a       Ninevite scribe for the use of Assur-bani-pal, the title of       the poems is wanting.         *** The text gives _kappi_, and the legend evidently refers       to a bird whose cry resembles the word meaning \"my       wings.\" The spotted sparrow-hawk utters a cry which may be       strictly understood and interpreted in this way.         **** This is evidently the origin of our fable of the       \"Amorous Lion.\"    Thou didst also love the shepherd Tabulu, who lavished incessantly upon  thee the smoke of sacrifices, and daily slaughtered goats to thee; thou  didst strike him and turn him into a leopard; his own servants went in  pursuit of him, and his dogs followed his trail.* Thou didst love  Ishullanu, thy father's gardener, who ceaselessly brought thee presents  of fruit, and decorated every day thy table. Thou raisedst thine eyes to  him, thou seizedst him: 'My Ishullanu, we shall eat melons, then shalt  thou stretch forth thy hand and remove that which separates us.'  Ishullanu said to thee: 'I, what dost thou require from me? O my mother,  prepare no food for me, I myself will not eat: anything I should eat  would be for me a misfortune and a curse, and my body would be stricken  by a mortal coldness.' Then thou didst hear him and didst become angry,  thou didst strike him, thou didst transform him into a dwarf, thou didst  set him up on the middle of a couch; he could not rise up, he could not  get down from where he was. Thou lovest me now, afterwards thou wilt  strike me as thou didst these.\"**         * The changing of a lover, by the goddess or sorceress       who loves him, into a beast, occurs pretty frequently in       Oriental tales; as to the man changed by Ishtar into a       brute, which she caused to be torn by his own hounds, we may       compare the classic story of Artemis surprised at her bath       by Actseon.         ** As to the misfortune of Ishullanu, we may compare the       story in the _Abrabian Nights_ of the Fisherman and the       Genie shut up in the leaden bottle. The king of the Black       Islands was transformed into a statue from the waist to the       feet by the sorceress, whom he had married and afterwards       offended; he remained lying on a bed, from which he could       not get down, and the unfaithful one came daily to whip him.    \"When Ishtar heard him, she fell into a fury, she ascended to heaven.  The mighty Ishtar presented herself before her father Anu, before her  mother Anatu she presented herself, and said: 'My father, Grilgames  has despised me. Grilgames has enumerated my unfaithfulnesses, my  unfaithfulnesses and my ignominies.' Anu opened his mouth and spake to  the mighty Ishtar: 'Canst thou not remain quiet now that Gilgames  has enumerated to thee thy unfaithfulnesses, thy unfaithfulnesses and  ignominies?'\" But she refused to allow the outrage to go unpunished.  She desired her father to make a celestial urus who would execute her  vengeance on the hero; and, as he hesitated, she threatened to destroy  every living thing in the entire universe by suspending the impulses of  desire, and the effect of love. Anu finally gives way to her rage: he  creates a frightful urus, whose ravages soon rendered uninhabitable the  neighbourhood of Uruk the well-protected. The two heroes, Gilgames and  Eabani, touched by the miseries and terror of the people, set out on the  chase, and hastened to rouse the beast from its lair on the banks of  the Euphrates in the marshes, to which it resorted after each murderous  onslaught.    [Illustration: 068.jpg GILGAMES AND EABANI FIGHTING WITH MONSTERS.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a Chaldaean intaglio in the New       York Museum. The original is about an inch and a half in       height.    A troop of three hundred valiant warriors penetrated into the thickets  in three lines to drive the animal towards the heroes. The beast with  head lowered charged them; but Eabani seized it with one hand by the  right horn, and with the other by the tail, and forced it to rear.  Gilgames at the same instant, seizing it by the leg, plunged his dagger  into its heart. The beast being despatched, they celebrated their  victory by a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and poured out a libation to  Sharnash, whose protection had not failed them in this last danger.  Ishtar, her projects of vengeance having been defeated, \"ascended the  ramparts of Uruk the well-protected. She sent forth a loud cry, she  hurled forth a malediction: 'Cursed be Gilgames, who has insulted me,  and who has killed the celestial urus.' Eabani heard these words of  Ishtar, he tore a limb from the celestial urus and threw it in the face  of the goddess: 'Thou also I will conquer, and I will treat thee like  him: I will fasten the curse upon thy sides.' Ishtar assembled her  priestesses, her female votaries, her frenzied women, and together they  intoned a dirge over the limb of the celestial urus. Gilgames assembled  all the turners in ivory, and the workmen were astonished at the  enormous size of the horns; they were worth thirty _mimae_ of lapis,  their diameter was a half-cubit, and both of them could contain six  measures of oil.\" He dedicated them to Shamash, and suspended them on  the corners of the altar; then he washed his hands in the Euphrates,  re-entered Uruk, and passed through the streets in triumph. A riotous  banquet ended the day, but on that very night Eabani felt himself  haunted by an inexplicable and baleful dream, and fortune abandoned the  two heroes. Gilgames had cried in the intoxication of success to the  women of Uruk: \"Who shines forth among the valiant? Who is glorious  above all men? Gilgames shines forth among the valiant, Gilgames is  glorious above all men.\" Ishtar made him feel her vengeance in the  destruction of that beauty of which he was so proud; she covered him  with leprosy from head to foot, and made him an object of horror to his  friends of the previous day. A life of pain and a frightful death--he  alone could escape them who dared to go to the confines of the world in  quest of the Fountain of Youth and the Tree of Life which were said to  be there hidden; but the road was rough, unknown, beset by dangers, and  no one of those who had ventured upon it had ever returned. Gilgames  resolved to brave every peril rather than submit to his fate, and  proposed this fresh adventure to his friend Eabani, who, notwithstanding  his sad forebodings, consented to accompany him. They killed a tiger  on the way, but Eabani was mortally wounded in a struggle in which they  engaged in the neighbourhood of Nipur, and breathed his last after an  agony of twelve days' duration.    \"Gilgames wept bitterly over his friend Eabani, grovelling on the bare  earth.\" The selfish fear of death struggled in his spirit with regret at  having lost so dear a companion, a tried friend in so many encounters.  \"I do not wish to die like Eabani: sorrow has entered my heart, the fear  of death has taken possession of me, and I am overcome. But I will go  with rapid steps to the strong Shamashnapishtim, son"]]]
