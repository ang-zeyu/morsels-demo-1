Sprains or injuries of lateral ligaments of the extremities, ringbone  and certain foot affections, are made manifest by a side to side  movement or a pivotal movement. In fact, wherever it is possible to  cause undue or unusual tension to be exerted upon an inflamed structure,  manifestation of pain is the response. In an inflamed condition of the  lateral side of the phalanges, unequal weight-bearing such as a rough  road surface will, by virtue of the leverage which the solar surface of  the foot affords, cause undue strain upon such inflamed parts, and  increased lameness is evident.    When an animal is made to travel in a circle, when a member affected  with supporting-leg-lameness is on the inner side of the circle,  lameness is accentuated because weight is borne by the lame leg for a  greater length of time, the result of such circuitous manner of  locomotion. In swinging-leg-lameness, on the other hand, because pain is  increased at the time an affected member is being advanced, lameness is  increased when the subject is made to travel in a circle, with the lame  leg on the outside of a circle thus described.    In supporting-leg-lameness, the transientness of the weight-bearing  period upon the affected member is the determining factor in the  production of lameness. This unequal period of weight-bearing upon the  front legs, for instance, causes an acceleration in the advancement of  the sound member, in order to relieve the diseased one which is bearing  weight. In other words, when an animal that is affected with  supporting-leg-lameness travels in a straight line, since weight is  borne by the diseased leg for an abnormally short period of time, the  sound member needs be in the act of advancement a correspondingly short  period. The result is then, an unequal division of stride; a nodding of  the head with the catching up of weight by the sound leg,--in front leg  affections--and this is termed _limping_.    With continuous exertion as in travel for a considerable distance, in  some cases, lameness becomes less evident--as in spavin. This \"warming  out\" process is due in a measure to the parts becoming less sensitive  upon exertion, and is to be seen, to a limited extent, in all  inflammatory affections that are not too severe; consequently, in some  cases, examination of a lame animal should begin in the stall, for in  instances where the impediment is not marked, there may be no evidence  of lameness after the subject has walked a few steps. In other cases,  lameness increases as the subject continues to travel, and often to the  extent that the impediment becomes too severe to allow the animal being  serviceable. Therefore, one can not, in every case of lameness observed,  positively determine the gravity of the situation, without having seen  the affected animal in action for a sufficient length of time to  understand the nature of the condition existing. This necessitates  driving the animal for several miles in certain cases.    Sometimes it is impossible to arrive at any definite conclusion, as the  result of a single examination, and it then becomes necessary to see the  subject again at a later date, or under more favorable circumstances.  This is to be expected in some conditions where there exists rheumatic  affections, and also in some foot diseases.    In the examination of young animals, unused to harness and to other  strange incumbrances, one is obliged to make allowance for impediments  of gait, which are not occasioned by diseased conditions. Such  affections have been termed \"false lameness.\" Young mules that are not  well broken to harness, are difficult subjects for examination and in  some cases it is necessary to have them led or driven for a considerable  distance before one can definitely interpret the nature of the  impediment in the gait when lameness is not pronounced. It is especially  difficult to satisfactorily examine such subjects, for the reason that  their normal rebellious temperaments cause resistance whenever a strange  person approaches them, as it is necessary to do for an examination by  palpation. In such cases--if an examination does not reveal the cause of  trouble, rest must be recommended and further examination made at a  later date, whereupon any new developments may be noted, if such changes  exist.      Special Methods of Examination.    After having completed a general examination of a lame animal--obtaining  the history of the case, noting its temperament, type, size,  conformation, position assumed while at repose, swellings or  enlargements if present, causing the subject to move to note the degree  and character of lameness manifested; palpating and manipulating the  parts affected to acquire a fairly definite notion of the nature of an  inflammation or to recognize crepitation it becomes necessary in some  cases to employ peculiar means of examination in singular instances.  This may be done by making use of cocain in solution for the production  of local anesthesia as in lameness of the phalanges. Such means are not,  in themselves, dependable but are valuable when used in conjunction with  all other available and practical methods.    Trial use of various shoes in order to shift the weight from one part of  the foot to another or to cause an animal to \"break over\" in a different  manner so that the gait may be changed, constitutes a special test  procedure. The use of hoof testers or of a hammer to note the degree or  presence of supersensitiveness is another means that is of practical  service. No examination, in any case of lameness, is complete without  having removed the shoe and scrutinized the solar surface of the foot.    [Illustration: Fig. 1--Hoof testers with special jaws of sufficient size  to grasp the largest foot.]    Diagnosis by exclusion, finally, is resorted to, and, as in any other  case where the recognition of cause is difficult, exclusion of the  existence of conditions,--one at a time, by an analysis of  symptoms--generally enables the practictioner to eliminate all but the  disturbing element.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 4: By stride is meant the distance between two successive  imprints of the same foot. The term is not used in this work as being  synonymous with step.]          SECTION III.    LAMENESS IN THE FORE LEG.      Anatomo-Physiological Review of parts of the Fore Leg.    For supporting weight, whether the subject is at rest or in motion, the  bony column of the leg, together with attached ligaments, tendons and  muscles, is wonderfully well adapted by nature for the function which  they perform. The several bones which go to make up the supportive  portion of the leg, are so joined at their points of articulation, that  a minimum degree of strain is put upon each attachment.    The upper third of the scapula, with its cartilage of prolongation, is  sufficiently broad and flattened that it fits snugly against the thorax  without necessity for a complicated method of attachment--the clavicle  being absent, attachment is muscular.    Smith[5] has very aptly stated that:    \"It seems quite legitimate to regard the muscular union between the  thorax and forelimb as a joint. There are no bones resting on each  other, no synovia; but where the scapula has its largest range of  movement there is a remarkable amount of areolar tissue, which renders  movement easy. The whole central area beneath the scapula and humerus  not occupied by muscular attachment, is filled with this easy-moving,  apparently gaseously distended, crepitant, areolar tissue over which the  fore legs glide on the chest wall as freely as if the parts were a  large, well lubricated joint.\"    The scapulohumeral articulation (shoulder joint) is an enarthrodial  (ball and socket) joint but because of its being held more or less  firmly against the thoracic wall by muscular and tendinous attachment,  and because a part of this attachment affords a means of support for the  body itself, there is no need for binding ligaments and movement is  possible in all directions even though restricted as to extent.

The fascia and the ulnar head of the flexor carpi ulnaris have been  removed. 1, Distal end of humerus; 2, median vessels and nerve. (From  Sisson's \"Anatomy of the Domestic Animals\").]    Undue extension, (by extension is meant such movement as will cause the  long axis of two articulating bones to assume a position which  approaches or forms a straight line--opposite to flexion), of the  scapulohumeral joint is impossible while weight is borne, because of the  normally flexed position of the humerus on the scapula; whereas flexion,  beyond desirable limits, is inhibited by the biceps brachii (flexor  brachii or coracoradialis) muscle.    The distal end of the humerus, however, articulating with the radius and  ulna in a fashion that no support is lent by any sort of contact with  the body, is a ginglymus (hinge) joint and lateral motion, because of  the long transverse diameter of its articular portions, is easily  prevented by the medial and lateral ligaments (internal and external  ligaments). Flexion of this, the humeroradioulnar joint (elbow), is  restrained by the triceps brachii and extension is checked by the biceps  brachii (flexor brachii).    The carpal joint (erroneously called the knee joint), is composed of the  several carpal bones which interarticulate and, when taken as a group,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16378"],[0,"The Art of Perfumery, and Methods of Obtaining the Odors of Plants (#11)"],[1,"kingdom; hence, if mixed in the proportion  of measure for measure, it completely covers the smell of all other  bodies.    EXTRACT OF PATCHOULY.    Rectified spirit,       1 gallon.  Otto of patchouly,      1-1/4 oz.    \"     rose,             1/4 oz.    The essence of patchouly thus made is that which is found in the  perfumers' shops of Paris and London. Although few perfumes have had  such a fashionable run, yet when smelled at in its pure state, it is far  from agreeable, having a kind of mossy or musty odor, analogous to  Lycopodium, or, as some say, it smells of \"old coats.\"    The characteristic smell of Chinese or Indian ink is due to some  admixture of this herb.    The origin of the use of patchouly as a perfume in Europe is curious. A  few years ago real Indian shawls bore an extravagant price, and  purchasers could always distinguish them by their odor; in fact, they  were perfumed with patchouly. The French manufacturers had for some time  successfully imitated the Indian fabric, but could not impart the odor.    At length they discovered the secret, and began to import the plant to  perfume articles of their make, and thus palm off homespun shawls as  real Indian! From this origin the perfumers have brought it into use.  Patchouly herb is extensively used for scenting drawers in which linen  is kept; for this purpose it is best to powder the leaves and put them  into muslin sacks, covered with silk, after the manner of the  old-fashioned lavender-bag. In this state it is very efficacious in  preventing the clothes from being attacked by moths. Several  combinations of patchouly will be given in the recipes for \"bouquets and  nosegays.\"    PEA (SWEET).--A very fine odor may be abstracted from  the flowers of the chick-vetch by maceration in any fatty body, and then  digesting the pomade produced in spirit. It is, however, rarely  manufactured, because a very close    IMITATION OF THE ESSENCE OF SWEET PEA.    can be prepared thus:--    Extract of tuberose,               1/2 pint.    \"        fleur d'orange,         1/2  \"    \"        rose from pomatum,      1/2  \"    \"        vanilla,                    1 oz.    Scents, like sounds, appear to influence the olfactory nerve in certain  definite degrees. There is, as it were, an octave of odors like an  octave in music; certain odors coincide, like the keys of an instrument.  Such as almond, heliotrope, vanilla, and orange-blossoms blend together,  each producing different degrees of a nearly similar impression. Again,  we have citron, lemon, orange-peel, and verbena, forming a higher octave  of smells, which blend in a similar manner. The metaphor is completed by  what we are pleased to call semi-odors, such as rose and rose geranium  for the half note; petty grain, neroli, a black key, followed by fleur  d'orange. Then we have patchouli, sandal-wood, and vitivert, and many  others running into each other.    From the odors already known we may produce, by uniting them in proper  proportion, the smell of almost any flower, except jasmine.    The odor of some flowers resembles others so nearly that we are almost  induced to believe them to be the same thing, or, at least, if not  evolved from the plant as such, to become so by the action of the  air-oxidation. It is known that some actually are identical in  composition, although produced from totally different plants, such as  camphor, turpentine, rosemary. Hence we may presume that chemistry will  sooner or later produce one from the other, for with many it is merely  an atom of water or an atom of oxygen that causes the difference. It  would be a grand thing to produce otto of roses from oil of rosemary, or  from the rose geranium oil, and theory indicates its possibility.    The essential oil of almonds in a bottle that contains a good deal of  air-oxygen, and but a very little of the oil, spontaneously passes into  another odoriferous body, benzoic acid; which is seen in crystals to  form over the dry parts of the flask. This is a natural illustration of  this idea. In giving the recipe for \"sweet pea\" as above, we form it  with the impression that its odor resembles the orange-blossom, which  similarity is approached nearer by the addition of the rose and  tuberose.    The vanilla is used merely to give permanence to the scent on the  handkerchief, and this latter body is chosen in preference to extract of  musk or ambergris, which would answer the same purpose of giving  permanence to the more volatile ingredients; because the vanilla  strikes the same key of the olfactory nerve as the orange-blossom, and  thus no new idea of a different scent is brought about as the perfume  dies off from the handkerchief. When perfumes are not mixed upon this  principle, then we hear that such and such a perfume becomes \"sickly\" or  \"faint\" after they have been on the handkerchief a short time.    PINE-APPLE.--Both Dr. Hoffman and Dr. Lyon Playfair have fallen  into some error in their inferences with regard to the application of  this odor in perfumery. After various practical experiments conducted in  a large perfumatory, we have come to the conclusion that it cannot be so  applied, simply because when the essence of pine-apple is smelled at,  the vapor produces an involuntary action of the larynx, producing cough,  when exceedingly dilute. Even in the infinitesimal portions it still  produces disagreeable irritation of the air-pipes, which, if prolonged,  such as is expected if used upon a handkerchief, is followed by intense  headache. It is obvious, therefore, that the legitimate use of the  essence of pine-apple (butyric ether) cannot be adapted with benefit to  the manufacturing perfumer, although invaluable to the confectioner as a  flavoring material. What we have here said refers to the artificial  essence of pine-apple, or butyrate of ethyloxide, which, if very much  diluted with alcohol, resembles the smell of pine-apple, and hence its  name; but how far the same observations are applicable to the true  essential oil from the fruit or epidermis of the pine-apple, remains to  be seen _when_ we procure it. As the West Indian pine-apples are now  coming freely into the market, the day is probably not distant when  demonstrative experiments can be tried; but hitherto it must be  remembered our experiments have only been performed with a body  _resembling in smell_ the true essential oil of the fruit. The physical  action of all ethers upon the human body is quite sufficient to prevent  their application in perfumery, however useful in confectionary, which  it is understood has to deal with another of the senses,--not of smell,  but of taste. The commercial \"essence of pine-apple,\" or \"pine-apple  oil,\" and \"jargonelle pear-oil,\" are admitted only to be _labelled_  such, but really are certain organic acid ethers. For the present, then,  perfumers must only look on these bodies as so many lines in the \"Poetry  of Science,\" which, for the present, are without practical application  in his art.    PINK.--_Dianthus Caryophyllus._--The clove pink emits a most  fragrant odor, \"especially at night,\" says Darwin.        \"The lavish pink that scents the garden round,\"    is not, however, at present applied in perfumery, except in name.    IMITATION ESSENCE OF CLOVE PINK.    Esprit rose,                 1/2 pint.     \"   fleur d'orange,       1/4   \"     \"     \"   de cassie,      1/4   \"     \"   vanilla,                  2 oz.  Oil of cloves,               10 drops.    It is remarkable how very much this mixture resembles the odor of the  flower, and the public never doubt its being the \"real thing.\"    RHODIUM.--When rose-wood, the lignum of the _Convolvulus  scoparius_, is distilled, a sweet-smelling oil is procured, resembling  in some slight degree the fragrance of the rose, and hence its name. At  one time, that is, prior to the cultivation of the rose-leaf geranium,  the distillates from rose-wood and from the root of the _Genista  canariensis_ (Canary-rose-wood), were principally drawn for the  adulteration of real otto of roses, but as the geranium oil answers so  much better, the oil of rhodium has fallen into disuse, hence its  comparative scarcity in the market at the present day, though our  grandfathers knew it well. One cwt. of wood yields about three ounces of  oil.    Ground rose-wood is valuable as a basis in the manufacture of sachet  powders for perfuming the wardrobe.    The French have given the name jacaranda to rose-wood, under the idea  that the plant called jacaranda by the Brazilians yields it, which is  not the case; \"the same word has perhaps been the origin of  palisander--palixander, badly written.\"--_Burnett_.    ROSE.--        \"Go, crop the gay rose's vermeil bloom,      And waft its spoils, a sweet perfume,            In incense to the skies.\"        OGILVIE.    This queen of the garden loses not its diadem in the perfuming world.  The oil of roses, or, as it is commonly called, the otto, or attar, of  roses, is procured (contrary to so many opposite statements) simply by  distilling the roses with water.    The otto, or attar, of rose of commerce is derived from the _Rosa  centifolia provincialis_. Very extensive rose farms exist at Adrianople  (Turkey in Europe); at Broussa, now famous as the residence of  Abd-el-Kader; and at Uslak (Turkey in Asia); also at Ghazepore, in  India.    The cultivators in Turkey are principally the Christian inhabitants of  the low countries of the Balkan, between Selimno, and Carloya, as far as  Philippopolis, in Bulgaria, about 200 miles from Constantinople. In good  seasons, this district yields 75,000 ounces; but in bad seasons only  20,000 to 30,000 ounces of attar are obtained. It is estimated that it  requires at least 2000 rose blooms to yield one drachm of otto.    The otto slightly varies in odor from different districts; many places  furnish an otto which solidifies more readily than others, and,  therefore, this is not a sure "]]]
