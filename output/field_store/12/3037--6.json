[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14874"],[0,"Elsie's Womanhood (#11)"],[1,"    She found a rustic seat placed for her under a giant oak, and garlanded  with fragrant flowers. Aunt Phillis, Aunt Chloe, Uncle Joe, and the rest  of the house-servants, gathered in a semicircle around it, while beyond,  the men, women, and children from the quarter sat or lay upon the grass,  enjoying the rest from the toils of the week, the quiet, the balmy air  laden with the fragrance of the magnolia and orange, and all the sweet  sights and sounds of rural life in that favored region.    Every one rose at the appearance of their young mistress, and there were  murmurs of delight and gratitude coming from all sides. \"Now bress de  Lord, she read the good book for us.\" \"She good an' lubly as de angels.\"  \"Missus berry kind, de darkies neber forget.\"    Elsie acknowledged it all with a smile and a few kindly words, then  commanding silence by a slight motion of the hand, addressed them in a  clear, melodious voice, which, though not loud, could be distinctly heard  by every one of the now almost breathless listeners.    \"I shall read to you of Jesus and some of His own words,\" she said, \"but  first we will ask Him to help us to understand, to love, and to obey His  teachings.\"    Then folding her hands and lifting her eyes to the clear blue sky above,  she led them in a prayer so simple and childlike, so filial and loving in  spirit and expression, that the dullest understood it, and felt that she  spoke to One who was very near and dear to her.    After that she read with the same distinct utterance the third chapter of  John's Gospel, and commented briefly upon it. \"You all want to go to  heaven?\" she said, closing the book.    \"Yes, Miss Elsie.\" \"Yes missus, we all does.\"    \"But to be able to go there you must know the way, and now I want to make  sure you do know it. Can you tell me what you must do to be saved?\"    There were various answers. \"Be good,\" \"Mine de rules an' do 'bout right.\"  \"Pray to de Lord,\" etc., etc.    Elsie shook her head gravely. \"All that you must do, and more besides.  What does Jesus say? 'God so loved the world, that He gave His only  begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have  everlasting life.' We must believe _in_ Jesus--believe all that the Bible  tells us about Him, that He was very God and very man, that He came down  from heaven, was born a little babe and laid in a manger, that He grew up  to be a man, went about doing good, and at last suffered and died the  cruel death of the cross; and all to save poor lost sinners.    \"But even that is not enough: the devils believe so much; they know it is  all true. But beside this, we must believe _on_ Christ Jesus. He offers to  be our Saviour. 'Come unto Me ... and I will give you rest.' 'Him that  cometh unto Me, I will in no wise cast out,' And you must come, you must  take the eternal life He offers you; you must rest on Him and Him only.    \"Suppose you were out on the bayou yonder, and the boat should upset and  float beyond your reach, or be swept away from you by the wind and waves,  and you couldn't swim; but just as you are sinking, you find a plank  floating near; you catch hold of it, you find it strong and large enough  to bear your weight, and you throw yourself upon it and cling to it for  life. Just so you must cast yourself on Jesus, and cling to Him with all  your strength: and He will save you; for He is able and willing 'to save  to the uttermost all that come unto God by Him.'    \"He will wash away your sins in His own precious blood, and dress you in  the beautiful robe of His perfect righteousness; that is, set His goodness  to your account, so that you will be saved just as if you had been as good  and holy as He was. Then you will love Him and try to do right to please  Him; not to buy heaven; you cannot do that, for 'all our righteousnesses  are as filthy rags,' and we cannot be saved unless we trust only in Jesus  and His righteousness.\"    Something in the faces before her caused Elsie to turn her head. Her  father stood with grave, quiet air, but a few feet from her.    \"Papa,\" she said, in an undertone, and blushing slightly, \"I did not know  you were here. Will you not speak to them? you can do it so much better  than I.\"    She sat down, and stepping to her side he made a brief and simply worded  address on the necessity of repentance and faith in Jesus, \"the only  Saviour of sinners,\" His willingness to save _all_ who come to Him, and  the great danger of delay in coming. Then with a short prayer and the  singing of a hymn, they were dismissed.    With murmured thanks and many a backward look of admiring love at their  already almost idolized young mistress, and her father, who had won their  thorough respect and affection years ago, they scattered to their homes.    \"You must have a shawl and hat, for the air begins to grow cool,\" said Mr.  Dinsmore to his daughter.    \"Yes, massa, I'se brought dem,\" said Chloe, hurrying up almost out of  breath, with the required articles in her hand.    \"Thank you, mammy, you are always careful of your nursling;\" Elsie said,  smilingly, as the shawl was wrapped carefully about her shoulders and the  hat placed upon her head.    Her father drew her hand within his arm and led her across the lawn.    \"There is one spot, very dear to us both, which we have not yet visited,\"  he said, low and feelingly, \"and I have rather wondered at your delay in  asking me to take you there.\"    She understood him. \"Yes, sir,\" she said, \"I should have done so last  evening, but that you looked weary. It has hardly been out of my mind  since we came, and I have only waited for a suitable time.\"    \"None could be better than the present,\" he answered.    On a gently sloping hillside, and beneath the shade of a beautiful  magnolia, they found what they sought: a grave, with a headstone on which  was carved the inscription:                \"Fell asleep in Jesus,                  March 15, 18--,           ELSIE, WIFE OF HORACE DINSMORE,             and only remaining child of             WILLIAM AND ELSPETH GRAYSON,              Aged 16 years, and 2 weeks.      'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord.'\"    They read it standing side by side.    \"How young,\" murmured the daughter, tears filling her eyes, \"how young to  be a wife, a mother, and to die and leave husband and child! Oh, papa, how  I used to long for her, and dream of her--my own precious mamma!\"    \"When, my darling?\" he asked in moved tones, drawing her tenderly to him  and passing an arm about her waist.    \"Before I knew you, papa, and before you began to love me so dearly and be  father and mother both, to me, as you have been for so many years,\" The  low, sweet voice was tremulous with emotion, and the soft eyes lifted to  his were brimming over with tears of mingled grief and joy, gratitude and  love.      \"I have tried to be,\" he said; \"but no one could supply her place. What a  loving, tender mother she would have been! But let us forget our loss in  the bliss of knowing that it is so well with her.\"    It was a family burying-ground; there were other graves; those of our  Elsie's grandparents, and several of their sons and daughters who had died  in infancy or early youth; and in the midst uprose a costly monument,  placed there by Mr. Grayson after the death of his wife. The spot showed  the same care as the rest of the estate, and was lovely with roses and  other sweet flowers and shrubs.    \"My mother's grave!\" said Elsie, bending over it again. \"Papa, let us  kneel down beside it and pray that we may meet her in heaven.\"    He at once complied with the request, giving thanks for the quiet rest of  her who slept in Jesus, and asking that, when each of them had done and  suffered all God's holy will here on earth, they might be reunited to her  above, and join in her glad song of praise to redeeming love.    Elsie joined fervently in the \"Amen,\" and rising, they lingered a moment  longer, then wended their way in sweet and solemn silence to the house.    They sat together in the library after tea, each occupied with a book. But  Elsie seemed little interested in hers, looking off the page now and then,  as if in deep and troubled thought. At length closing it, she stole round  to the side of her father's easy chair, and taking possession of a  footstool, laid her head on his knee.    \"I have my little girl again to-night,\" he said, passing his hand  caressingly over her hair and cheek.    \"I almost wish it was, papa.\"    \"Why? is anything troubling you, dearest?\" And he pushed his book aside,  ready to give his whole attention to her.    \"I am anxious about my poor people, papa; they are so ignorant of the  truths necessary to salvation; and what can I teach them in three or four  weeks? I have almost decided that I ought--that I must stay as many  months.\"    \"And that without even consulting your father? much less considering his  permission necessary to your action?\" Though the words seemed to convey  reproach, if not reproof, his tone was gentle and tender.    \"No, no, papa! I must cease to think it my duty if you forbid it.\"    \"As I do most positively, _I_ cannot stay, and I should never think for a  moment of leaving you here!\"    \"But, papa, how then am I to do my duty by these poor ignorant creatures?  how can I let them perish for lack of knowledge whom Christ has put into  my care?\"    \"Procure a chaplain, who shall hold regular services for them every  Sabbath, and do pastoral work among them through the week. You will not  grudge him his salary.\"    \"Papa, what an excellent idea! Grudge him his salary? No, indeed; if I can  get the right man to fill the place, he shall have a liberal one. And then  he will be a check upon Mr. Spriggs, and inform me if the people are  abused. But how shall I find him?\"    \"What do you do when in want of something you do not know exactly how to  procure?\"    \"Pray for direction and help,\" she answered, low and reverently.    \"We "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14875"],[0,"Elsie's children (#11)"],[1,"res.  Alas, they are not for me!\" quickly succeeded by another,--\"Ah, that sweet  child cannot live to maturity, and be always as happy and free from care,  as now.\"    Her mother's shrill voice recalled her to herself, \"Why do you stand  there? What's that they gave you?\"    \"A note, mother. It's directed to me.\"    \"Then make haste and read it.\"    \"Shall I not give you your breakfast first?\"    \"No, no! do as I bid you.\"    So the girl read the missive aloud without delay.    It was from Mrs. Travilla, and stated that she had already written to  engage a room for Mrs. Gibson in a cottage in a quiet little seaside town;  a place recommended by Doctor Morton as very suitable; and that she would  secure a competent nurse to go with her.    \"Why can't she send you, too, instead of hiring a stranger to go with me?\"  here interrupted Mrs. Gibson, angrily.    \"Wait, mother,\" said Sally in quivering tones, tears of joy and gratitude  filling her eyes.    She dashed them away and read on.    \"I have another plan for you. Doctor Morton told you his opinion,--that  your case was hopeless. But do not despair; mistakes are often made even  by the most skilful men. A friend of mine, whose trouble was very similar  to yours--consulted a number of excellent oculists all of whom told her  the nerve of her eye was affected and there was no help for it, she would  certainly go blind; then as a last hope she went to Doctor Thomson of  Philadelphia, who succeeded in giving her entire relief. If you are  willing, I will send you to him. And now the first thing is to provide  your mother and yourself each with a suitable outfit. Come up to the Crags  as early this morning as you can, and we will make arrangements.\"          CHAPTER TENTH.        \"When we see the flower seeds wafted,       From the nurturing mother tree,       Tell we can, wherever planted,       What the harvesting will be;       Never from the blasting thistle,       Was there gathered golden grain,       Thus the seal the child receiveth,       From its mother will remain.\"                            --MRS. HALE.      For once Mrs. Gibson had the grace to feel a passing emotion of gratitude  to this kind benefactor, and shame that she herself had been so ready with  fault-finding instead of thanks.    As for Sally, she was completely overcome, and dropping into a chair, hid  her face and cried heartily.    \"Come, don't be a fool,\" her mother said at last; \"there's too much to be  done to waste time in crying, and besides you'll hurt your eyes.\"    Sally rose hastily, removed the traces of her tears, and began setting the  table for their morning meal.    \"How soon are you going?\" her mother asked at its conclusion.    \"Just as soon as I can get the things cleared away and the dishes washed;  if you think you can spare me.\"    \"Of course I can. I feel well enough this morning to help myself to  anything I'm likely to want.\"    There was still half an hour to spare before breakfast when, after a round  of five or six miles on their ponies, Philip and Elsie reached the Crags.    \"What shall you do with yours?\" asked Philip, remarking upon that fact.    \"Read,\" she answered, looking back at him with a smile as she tripped  lightly up the stairs.    Dinah was in waiting to smooth her hair and help her change the pretty  riding hat and habit for a dress better suited to the house; then Elsie,  left alone, seated herself by a window with her Bible in her hand.    For a moment her eyes rested upon the blue distant mountains, softly  outlined against the deeper blue of the sky, watched the cloud shadows  floating over the nearer hills and valleys here richly wooded, there  covered with fields of waving grain her ear the while drinking in with  delight many a sweet rural sound, the songs of birds, the distant lowing  of cattle, and bleating of sheep--her heart swelling with ardent love and  thankfulness to him who had given her so much to enjoy.    Dinah had left the door open, that the fresh air might course freely  through the room, and Gertrude coming, some minutes later, in search of  her friend, stood watching Elsie for a little unperceived.    \"Dear me!\" she exclaimed at length, \"how many times a day do you pore over  that book?\"    Elsie looked up with a smile as sweet as the morning, \"I am allowed to  read it as often as I please.\"    \"Allowed? not compelled? not ordered?\"    \"No, only I must have a text ready for mamma every morning.\"    \"Getting one ready for to-morrow?\"    \"No, just reading. I had time for only a verse or two before my ride.\"    \"Well, that would be plenty for me. I can read it, too, as often as I  like, but a chapter or two on Sunday, generally does me for all the week.  There's the bell; come let's go down.\"    Vi met them at the door of the breakfast-room. \"Oh, Elsie, did you have a  pleasant ride? Is Sally Gibson coming soon?\"    \"I don't know; mamma said I need not wait for an answer.\"    There was time for no more, and Vi must put a restraint upon herself,  repressing excitement and curiosity for the present, as mamma expected her  children to be very quiet and unobtrusive at table when away from home.    Vi was delighted when just as they were leaving the table, a servant  announced that a young person who called herself Miss Gibson, was asking  for Miss Travilla; for Vi never liked waiting, and was always eager to  carry out immediately any plan that had been set on foot.    Mrs. Gibson was not troubled with any delicacy of feeling about asking for  what she wanted, and had made out a list of things to be provided for  herself and Sally, which the girl was ashamed to show; so extravagant  seemed its demands.    When urged by her benefactress, she mentioned a few of the most necessary  articles, modestly adding that the generous gift Mrs. Travilla had already  bestowed, ought to be sufficient to supply all else that might be  required.    Elsie, seating herself at her writing desk and taking out pen, ink and  paper, looked smilingly into the eager faces of her two little girls.    \"What do you think about it, dears?\"    \"Oh, they must have more things; a good many more, and we want to help pay  for them with our money.\"    \"You see, Miss Sally, they will be sadly disappointed if you refuse to  accept their gifts,\" Elsie said. \"Now I'm going to make out a list and you  must all help me, lest something should be forgotten. Mrs. Ross has kindly  offered us the use of her carriage, and we will drive to the nearest town  and see what we can find there, the rest we will order from New York.\"    The list was made out amid much innocent jesting and merry laughter of  both mother and children,--Sally a deeply interested and delighted  spectator of their pleasing intercourse--the mother so sweet, gentle and  affectionate, the children so respectful and loving to her, so kind and  considerate to each other.    In fact, the girl was so occupied in watching them, that she was not aware  till Mrs. Travilla read it over aloud, that this new list was longer and  more extravagant than the one she had suppressed.    \"Oh, it is too much, Mrs. Travilla!\" she cried, the tears starting to her  eyes.    \"My dear child,\" returned Elsie, playfully, \"I'm a wilful woman and will  have my own way. Come, the carriage is in waiting and we must go.\"    The shopping expedition was quite a frolic for the children, and a great  treat to poor, overworked Sally. \"She looks so shabby; I'd be ashamed to  go with her to the stores or anywhere, or to have her ride in the carriage  with me,\" Gertrude had said to Vi as the little girls were having their  hats put on; but Vi answered indignantly, \"She's clean and tidy, and she  isn't vulgar or rude, and I do believe she's good; and mamma says dress  and riches don't make the person.\"    And that seemed to be the feeling of all; Elsie, too, had purposely  dressed herself and her children as plainly as possible; so that Sally,  though at first painfully conscious of the deficiencies in her attire,  soon forgot all about them, and gave herself up to the thorough enjoyment  of the pleasures provided for her.    She felt that it would be very ungrateful did she not share the hearty  rejoicing of the children over \"her pretty things\" as they eagerly  selected and paid for them with their own pocket money, seeming fully to  realize the truth of the Master's declaration, \"It is more blessed to give  than to receive.\"    Vi would have had the making of the new dresses begun at once, wanting  Sally to return with them to the Crags, and let Dinah fit her immediately,  but was overruled by her mamma.    \"No, my dear, Sally must go home to her sick mother now, and Dinah shall  go to them after dinner.\"    \"But mamma, I want to begin my part. You know you said I could hem nicely,  and might do some on the ruffles or something.\"    \"Yes, daughter, and so you shall, but must rest awhile first.\"    Violet had often to be held back in starting upon some new enterprise, and  afterward encouraged or compelled to persevere, while Elsie was more  deliberate at first, more steadfast in carrying out what she had once  undertaken. Each had what the other lacked, both were very winsome and  lovable, and they were extremely fond of one another; scarcely less so of  their brothers and the darling baby sister.    \"When may I begin, mamma?\" asked Vi, somewhat impatiently.    \"After breakfast to-morrow morning you may spend an hour at your needle.\"    \"Only an hour, mamma? It would take all summer at that rate.\"    \"Ah, what a doleful countenance, daughter mine!\" Elsie said laughingly, as  she bent down and kissed the rosy cheek. \"You must remember that my two  little girls are not to carry the heavy end of this, and the sewing will  be done in good season without overworking them. I could not permit that;  I must see to it that they have plenty of time for rest and for healthful  play. I appoint you one hour a day, and shall allow you to spend one more,"]]]
