His painted face was a mask to frighten any sensible Terran child; his  general appearance was not attractive. But he was a flyer, and he  wanted to talk shop, as well as they could with no common speech.  Since the scarlet-wound nobleman on Raf's right was completely  engrossed in the feast, pursuing a few scraps avidly about the dish,  the Terran gave all his attention to the officer.    Twittering words poured in a stream from the warrior's lips. Raf shook  his head regretfully, and the other jerked his shoulders in almost  human impatience. Somehow that heartened Raf.    With many guesses to cover gaps, probably more than half of which were  wrong, Raf gathered that the officer was one of a very few who still  retained the almost forgotten knowledge of how to pilot the remaining  airworthy craft in this crumbling city. On their way to the building  with the curved roof, Raf had noted the evidences that the inhabitants  of this metropolis could not be reckoned as more than a handful and  that most of these now lived either within the central building or  close to it. A pitiful collection of survivors lingering on in the  ruins of their past greatness.    Yet he was impressed now by no feeling that the officer, eagerly  trying to make contact, was a degenerate member of a dying race. In  fact, as Raf glanced at the aliens about the room, he was conscious of  an alertness, of a suppressed energy which suggested a young and  vigorous people.    The officer was now urging him to go some place, and Raf, his dislike  for being in the heart of the strangers' territory once more aroused,  was about to shake his head in a firm negative when a second idea  stopped him. He had resisted separation from the flitter. Perhaps he  could persuade the alien, under the excuse of inspecting a strange  machine, to take him back to the flyer. Once there he would stay. He  did not know what Captain Hobart and Lablet thought they could  accomplish here. But, as for himself, Raf was sure that he was not  going to feel easy again until he was across the northern mountain  chain and coming in for a landing close by the _RS 10_.    It was as if the alien officer had read his thoughts, for the warrior  uncrossed his black legs and got nimbly to his feet with a lithe  movement, which Raf, cramped by sitting in the unfamiliar posture,  could not emulate. No one appeared to notice their withdrawal. And  when Raf hesitated, trying to catch Hobart's eye and make some  explanation, the alien touched his arm lightly and motioned toward one  of the curtained doorways. Conscious that he could not withdraw from  the venture now, Raf reluctantly went out.    They were in a hall where bold bands of color interwove in patterns  impossible for Terran eyes to study. Raf lowered his gaze hurriedly to  the gray floor under his boots. He had discovered earlier that to try  to trace any thread of that wild splashing did weird things to his  eyesight and awakened inside him a sick panic. His space boots, with  the metal, magnetic plates set in the soles, clicked loudly on the  pavement where his companion's bare feet made no whisper of sound.    The hall gave upon a ramp leading down, and Raf recognized this. His  confidence arose. They were on their way out of the building. Here the  murals were missing so that he could look about him for reference  points.    He was sure that the banquet hall was some ten stories above street  level. But they did not go down ten ramps now. At the foot of the  third the officer turned abruptly to the left, beckoning Raf along.  When the Terran remained stubbornly where he was, pointing in the  direction which, to him, meant return to the flitter, the other made  gestures describing an aircraft in flight. His own probably.    Raf sighed. He could see no way out unless he cut and ran. And long  before he reached the street from this warren they could pick him up.  Also, in spite of all the precautions he had taken to memorize their  way here, he was not sure he could find his path back to the flyer,  even if he were free to go. Giving in, he went after the officer.    Their way led out on one of the spider-web bridges which tied building  and tower into the complicated web which was the city. Raf, as a pilot  of flitter, had always believed that he had no fear of heights. But he  discovered that to coast above the ground in a flyer was far different  than to hurry at the pace his companion now set across one of these  narrow bridges suspended high above the street. And he was sure that  the surface under them vibrated as if the slightest extra poundage  would separate it from its supports and send it, and them, crashing  down.    Luckily the distance they had to cover was relatively short, but Raf  swallowed a sigh of relief as they reached the door at the other end.  They were now in a tower which, unluckily, proved to be only a way  station before another swing out over empty space on a span which  sloped down! Raf clutched at the guide rail, the presence of which  suggested that not all the users of this road were as nonchalant as  the officer who tripped lightly ahead. This must explain the other's  bare feet--on such paths they were infinitely safer than his own  boots.    The downward sloping bridge brought them to a square building which  somehow had an inhabited look which those crowding around it lacked.  Raf gained its door to become aware of a hum, a vibration in the wall  he touched to steady himself, hinting at the drive of motors, the  throb of machinery inside the structure. But within, the officer  passed along a corridor to a ramp which brought them out, after what  was for Raf a steep climb, upon the roof. Here was not one of the  tongue-shaped craft such as had first met them in the city, but a  gleaming globe. The officer stopped, his eyes moving from the Terran  to the machine, as if inviting Raf to share in his own pride. To the  pilot's mind it bore little resemblance to any form of aircraft past  or present with which he had had experience in his own world. But he  did not doubt that it was the present acme of alien construction, and  he was eager to see it perform.    He followed the officer through a hatch at the bottom of the globe,  only to be confronted by a ladder he thought at first he could not  climb, for the steps were merely toe holds made to accommodate the  long, bare feet of the crew. By snapping on the magnetic power of his  space boots, Raf was able to get up, although at a far slower speed  than his guide. They passed several levels of cabins before coming  out in what was clearly the control cabin of the craft.    To Raf the bank of unfamiliar levers and buttons had no meaning, but  he paid strict attention to the gestures of his companion. This was  not a space ship he gathered. And he doubted whether the aliens had  ever lifted from their own planet to their neighbors in this solar  system. But it was a long-range ship with greater cruising power than  the other flyer he had seen. And it was being readied now for a voyage  of some length.    The Terran pilot squatted down on the small stool before the controls.  Before him a visa plate provided a clear view of the sky without and  the gathering clouds of evening. Raf shifted uncomfortably. That  signal of the passing of time triggered his impatience to be  away--back to the _RS 10_. He did not want to spend the night in this  city. Somehow he must get the officer to take him back to the  flitter--to be there would be better than shut up in one of the alien  dwellings.    Meanwhile he studied the scene on the visa plate, trying to find the  roof on which they had left the flitter. But there was no point he was  able to recognize.    Raf turned to the officer and tried to make clear the idea of  returning to his own ship. Either he was not as clever at the sign  language as the other, or the alien did not wish to understand. For  when they left the control cabin, it was only to make an inspection  tour of the other parts of the globe, including the space which held  the motors of the craft and which, at another time, would have kept  Raf fascinated for hours.    In the end the Terran broke away and climbed down the thread of ladder  to stand on the roof under the twilight sky. Slowly he walked about  the broad expanse of the platform, attempting to pick out some  landmark. The central building of the city loomed high, and there were  any number of towers about it. But which was the one that guarded the  roof where the flitter rested? Raf's determination to get back to his  ship was a driving force.    The alien officer had watched him, and now a three-fingered hand was  laid on Raf's sleeve while its owner looked into Raf's face and  mouthed a trilling question.    Without much hope the pilot sketched the set of gestures he had used  before. And he was surprised when the other led the way down into the  building. This time they did not go back to the bridge, which had  brought them across the canyons of streets, but kept on down ramps  within the building.    There was a hum of activity in the place. Aliens, all in tight black  wrappings and burnished metal breastplates, their faces barred with  black and white paint, went on errands through the halls or labored at  tasks Raf could not understand. It now seemed as if his guide were  eager to get him away.    It was when they reached the street level that the officer did pause  by one door, beckoning Raf imperiously to join him. The Terran obeyed  reluctantly--and was almost sick.    He was staring down at a dead, very dead body. By the stained rags  still clinging to it, it was one of the aliens, a noble, not one of  the black-clad warriors. The gaping wounds which had almost torn the  unfortunate apart were like nothing Raf had ever seen.    With a guttural sound which expressed his feelings as well as any  words, the officer picked up from the floor a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18464"],[0,"The Wit and Humor of America, Volume I. (of X.) (#11)"],[1,"that water, at a certain temperature, boils. Miss Lyberg,  apparently seeking to earn her living in the kitchen, had no certain  views as to when the boiling point was reached. Rumors seemed vaguely to  have reached her that things called eggs dropped into water would, in  the course of time--any time, and generally less than a week--become  eatable. Letitia bought a little egg-boiler for her--one of those  antique arrangements in which the sands of time play to the soft-boiled  egg. The maiden promptly boiled it with the eggs, and undoubtedly  thought that the hen, in a moment of perturbation, or aberration, had  laid it. I say \"thought\" because it is the only term I can use. It is,  perhaps, inappropriate in connection with Gerda.    Potatoes, subjected to the action of hot water, grow soft. She was  certain of that. Whether she tested them with the poker, or with her  hands or feet, we never knew. I inclined to the last suggestion. The  situation was quite marvelous. Here was an alleged worker, in a  particular field, asking the wages of skilled labor, and densely  ignorant of every detail connected with her task. It seemed unique.  Carpenters, plumbers, bricklayers, seamstresses, dressmakers,  laundresses--all the sowers and reapers in the little garden of our  daily needs, were forced by the inexorable law of competition to possess  some inkling of the significance of their undertakings. With the cook it  was different. She could step jubilantly into any kitchen without the  slightest idea of what she was expected to do there. If she knew that  water was wet and that fire was hot, she felt amply primed to demand a  salary.    Impelled by her craving for Swedish literature, Letitia struggled with  Miss Lyberg. Compared with the Swede, my exquisitely ignorant wife was  a culinary queen. She was an epicurean caterer. Letitia's slate-pencil  coffee was ambrosia for the gods, sweetest nectar, by the side of the  dishwater that cook prepared. I began to feel quite proud of her. She  grew to be an adept in the art of boiling water. If we could have lived  on that fluid, everything would have moved clockworkily.    \"I've discovered one thing,\" said Letitia on the evening of the third  day. \"The girl is just a peasant, probably a worker in the fields. That  is why she is so ignorant.\"    I thought this reasoning foolish. \"Even peasants eat, my dear,\" I  muttered. \"She must have seen somebody cook something. Field-workers  have good appetites. If this woman ever ate, what did she eat and why  can't we have the same? We have asked her for no luxuries. We have  arrived at the stage, my poor girl, when all we need is, prosaically, to  'fill up.' You have given her opportunities to offer us samples of  peasant food. The result has been _nil_.\"    \"It _is_ odd,\" Letitia declared, a wrinkle of perplexity appearing in  the smooth surface of her forehead. \"Of course, she says she doesn't  understand me. And yet, Archie, I have talked to her in pure Swedish.\"    \"I suppose you said, 'Pray give me a piece of venison,' from the  conversation book.\"    \"Don't be ridiculous, Archie. I know the Swedish for cauliflower, green  peas, spinach, a leg of mutton, mustard, roast meat, soup, and--\"    \"'If the wind be favorable, we shall be at Gothenburg in forty hours,'\"  I interrupted. She was silent, and I went on: \"It seems a pity to end  your studies in Swedish, Letitia, but fascinating though they be, they  do not really necessitate our keeping this barbarian. You can always  pursue them, and exercise on me. I don't mind. Even with an American  cook, if such a being exist, you could still continue to ask for venison  steak in Swedish, and to look forward to arriving at Gothenburg in forty  hours.\"    Letitia declined to argue. My mood was that known as cranky. We were in  the drawing-room, after what we were compelled to call dinner. It had  consisted of steak burned to cinders, potatoes soaked to a pulp, and a  rice pudding that looked like a poultice the morning after, and possibly  tasted like one. Letitia had been shopping, and was therefore unable to  supervise. Our delicate repast was capped by \"black\" coffee of an  indefinite straw-color, and with globules of grease on the surface.  People who can feel elated with the joy of living, after a dinner of  this description, are assuredly both mentally and morally lacking. Men  and women there are who will say: \"Oh, give me anything. I'm not  particular--so long as it is plain and wholesome.\" I've met many of  these people. My experience of them is that they are the greatest  gluttons on earth, with veritably voracious appetites, and that the best  isn't good enough for them. To be sure, at a pinch, they will demolish a  score of potatoes, if there be nothing else; but offer them caviare,  canvas-back duck, quail, and nesselrode pudding, and they will look  askance at food that is plain and wholesome. The \"plain and wholesome\"  liver is a snare and a delusion, like the \"bluff and genial\" visitor  whose geniality veils all sorts of satire and merciless comment.    Letitia and I both felt weak and miserable. We had made up our minds not  to dine out. We were resolved to keep the home up, even if, in return,  the home kept us down. Give in, we wouldn't. Our fighting blood was up.  We firmly determined not to degenerate into that clammy American  institution, the boarding-house feeder and the restaurant diner. We  knew the type; in the feminine, it sits at table with its bonnet on, and  a sullen gnawing expression of animal hunger; in the masculine, it puts  its own knife in the butter, and uses a toothpick. No cook--no lack of  cook--should drive us to these abysmal depths.    Letitia made no feint at Ovid. I simply declined to breathe the breath  of _The Lives of Great Men_. She read a sweet little classic called \"The  Table; How to Buy Food, How to Cook It, and How to Serve It,\" by  Alessandro Filippini--a delightful _table-d'hote_-y name. I lay back in  my chair and frowned, waiting until Letitia chose to break the silence.  As she was a most chattily inclined person on all occasions, I reasoned  that I should not have to wait long. I was right.    \"Archie,\" said she, \"according to this book, there is no place in the  civilized world that contains so large a number of so-called high-livers  as New York City, which was educated by the famous Delmonico and his  able lieutenants.\"    \"Great Heaven!\" I exclaimed with a groan, \"why rub it in, Letitia? I  should also say that no city in the world contained so large a number of  low-livers.\"    \"'Westward the course of Empire sways,'\" she read, \"'and the great glory  of the past has departed from those centers where the culinary art at  one time defied all rivals. The scepter of supremacy has passed into the  hands of the metropolis of the New World.'\"    \"What sickening cant!\" I cried. \"What fiendishly exaggerated restaurant  talk! There are perhaps fifty fine restaurants in New York. In Paris  there are five hundred finer. Here we have places to eat in; there they  have artistic resorts to dine in. One can dine anywhere in Paris. In New  York, save for those fifty fine restaurants, one feeds. Don't read any  more of your cook-book to me, my girl. It is written to catch the  American trade, with the subtile pen of flattery.\"    \"Try and be patriotic, dear,\" she said soothingly. \"Of course, I know  you wouldn't allow a Frenchman to say all that, and that you are just  talking cussedly with your own wife.\"    A ring at the bell caused a diversion. We hailed it. We were in the  humor to hail anything. The domestic hearth _was_ most trying. We were  bored to death. I sprang up and ran to the door, a little pastime to  which I was growing accustomed. Three tittering young women, each  wearing a hat in which roses, violets, poppies, cornflowers,  forget-me-nots, feathers and ribbons ran riot, confronted me.    \"Miss Gerda Lyberg?\" said the foremost, who wore a bright red gown, and  from whose hat six spiteful poppies lurched forward and almost hit me in  the face.    For a moment, dazed from the cook-book, I was nonplussed. All I could  say was \"No,\" meaning that I wasn't Miss Gerda Lyberg. I felt so sure  that I wasn't that I was about to close the door.    \"She lives here, I believe,\" asserted the damsel, again shooting forth  the poppies.    I came to myself with an effort. \"She is the--the cook,\" I muttered  weakly.    \"We are her friends,\" quoth the damsel, an indignant inflection in her  voice. \"Kindly let us in. We've come to the Thursday sociable.\"    The three bedizened ladies entered without further parley and went  toward the kitchen, instinctively recognizing its direction. I was  amazed. I heard a noisy greeting, a peal of laughter, a confusion of  tongues, and then--I groped my way back to Letitia.    \"They've come to the Thursday sociable!\" I cried.    \"Who?\" she asked in astonishment, and I imparted to her the full extent  of my knowledge. Letitia took it very nicely. She had always heard, she  said, in fact Mrs. Archer had told her, that Thursday nights were  festival occasions with the Swedes. She thought it rather a pleasant and  convivial notion. Servants must enjoy themselves, after all. Better a  happy gathering of girls than a rowdy collection of men. Letitia thought  the idea felicitous. She had no objections to giving privileges to a  cook. Nor had I, for the matter of that. I ventured to remark, however,  that Gerda didn't seem to be a cook.    \"Then let us call her a 'girl,'\" said Letitia.    \"Gerda is a girl, only because she isn't a boy,\" I remarked tauntingly.  \"If by 'girl' you even mean servant, then Gerda isn't a girl. Goodness  knows what she is. Hello! Another ring!\"    This time Miss Lyberg herself went to the door, and we listened. More  arrivals for the sociable; four Swedish guests, all equally gaily  attired in flower hats. Some of them wore bangles, the noise of which,  in the hall, sounded like"]]]
