The more we look  into human nature, the more evident it becomes that there is much in  each one of us of which we are only dimly aware. It is now time for us  to look a little deeper,--to find where we keep these instinctive  tendencies with which it is possible to live so intimately without  even suspecting their existence. We shall find that they occupy a  realm of their own, and that this realm, while quite out of sight, is  yet open to exploration.          CHAPTER V    _In which we look below the surface and discover a veritable  wonderland_    THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND    STRANGERS TO OURSELVES      =Hidden Strings.= A collie dog lies on the hearthrug. A small boy with  mischievous intent ties a fine thread to a bone, hides himself behind  a chair, and pulls the bone slowly across the floor. The dog is thrown  into a fit of terror because he does not know about the hidden string.    A Chinese in the early days of San Francisco stands spell-bound at the  sight of a cable car. \"No pushee. No pullee. Go allee samee like  hellee!\" He does not know about the hidden string.    A woman of refinement and culture thinks a thought that horrifies her  sensitive soul. It is entirely out of keeping with her character as  she knows it. In her misunderstanding she considers it wicked and  thrusts it from her, wondering how it ever could have been hers. She  does not know about the hidden string.    In the last two chapters we thought together about some of these  strings, examining the fibers of which they are made and learning in  what directions they pull. We found them to be more powerful than we  should have supposed, more insistent and less visible. We found that  instinctive desire is the string, the cable that energizes our every  act, but that our desires are neither single nor simple, and are but  rarely on the surface. Many of us live with them a long time, feeling  the tug, but not recognizing the string.    =There's a Reason.= We take our thoughts and feelings and actions for  granted, without stopping very often to wonder where they come from.  But there is always a reason. When the law of cause and effect reaches  the doorsill of our minds, it does not stop short to give way to the  law of chance. We wake up in the morning with a certain thought on  top. We say it \"just happens.\" But nothing ever just happens. No  thought that ever comes into our heads has been without its  history,--its ancestors and its determining causes. But what about  dreams? They, at least, you say, have no connections, no past and no  future, only a weird, fantastic present. Strange to say, dreams have  been found to be as closely related to our real selves, as interwoven  with the warp and woof of our lives as are any of our waking thoughts.  Even dreams have a reason.    We find ourselves holding certain beliefs and prejudices, interested  in certain things and indifferent to others, liking some foods, some  colors and disliking others. Search our minds as we will, we find no  clue to many of these inner trends. Why?    The answer is simple. The cause is hidden below the surface. If we try  to explain ourselves on the basis of the open-to-inspection part of  our minds, we must come to the conclusion that we are queer creatures  indeed. Only by assuming that there is more to us than we know, can we  find any rational basis for the way we think and feel and act.    =A Real Mind.= We learn of our internal machinery by what it does. We  must infer a part of our minds which introspection does not reveal, a  mind within the mind, able to work for us even while we are unaware of  its existence. This inner mind is usually known as the subconscious,  the mind under the level of consciousness.[16] We forget a name, but  we know that it will come to us if we think about something else.  Presently, out of somewhere, there flashes the word we want. Where was  it in the meanwhile, and what hunted it out from among all our other  memories and sent it up into consciousness? The something which did  that must be capable of conserving memories, of recognizing the right  one and of communicating it,--surely a real mind.    [Footnote 16: Writers of the psycho-analytic school use the word  \"unconscious\" to denote the lower layers of this region, and  \"fore-conscious\" to denote its upper layers. Morton Prince uses the  terms \"unconscious\" and \"conscious\" to denote the different strata. As  there is still a good deal of confusion in the use of terms, it has  seemed to us simpler to use throughout only the general term  \"subconscious.\"]    One evening my collaborator fumbled unsuccessfully for the name of a  certain well-known journalist and educator. It was on the tip of her  tongue, but it simply would not come, not even the initial letter. In  a whimsical mood she said to herself just as she went to sleep,  \"Little subconscious mind, you find that name to-night.\" In the middle  of the night she awoke, saying, \"Williams--Talcott Williams.\" The  subconscious, which has charge of her memories, had been at work while  she slept.    The history of literature abounds in stories of under-the-surface  work. The man of genius usually waits until the mood is on, until the  muse speaks; then all his lifeless material is lighted by new  radiance. He feels that some one outside himself is dictating. Often  he merely holds the pen while the finished work pours itself out  spontaneously as if from a higher source.    But it is not only the man of genius who makes use of these unseen  powers. He may have readier access to his subconscious than the rest  of us, but he has no monopoly. The most matter-of-fact man often says  that he will \"sleep over\" a knotty problem. He puts it into his mind  and then goes about his business, or goes to sleep while this unseen  judge weighs and balances, collects related facts, looks first at one  side of the question and then at the other, and finally sends up into  consciousness a decision full of conviction, a decision that has been  formulated so far from the focus of attention that it seems to be  something altogether new, a veritable inspiration.    We must infer the subconscious from what it does. Things  happen,--there must be a cause. Some of the things that happen  presuppose imagination, reason, intelligence, will, emotion, desire,  all the elements of mind. We cannot see this mind, but we can see its  products. To deny the subconscious is to deny the artist while looking  at his picture, to disbelieve in the poet while reading his poem, and  to doubt the existence of the explosive while listening to the report.  The subconscious is an artist, a poet, and an explosive by turns. If  we deny its existence, a good portion of man's doings are  unintelligible. If we admit it, many of his actions and his  afflictions which have seemed absurd stand out in a new light as  purposeful efforts with a real and adequate cause.    =The Submerged Nine Tenths.= The more deeply psychologists and  physicians have studied into these things, the more certainly have  they been forced to the conclusion that the conscious mind of man, the  part that he can explore at will, is by far the smaller part of his  personality. Since this is to some people a rather startling  proposition, we can do no better than quote the following statement  from White on the relation of consciousness to the rest of the psychic  life:         Consciousness includes only that of which we are _aware_, while       outside of this somewhat restricted area there lies a much wider       area in which lie the deeper motives for conduct, and which not       only operates to control conduct, but also dictates what may and       what may not become conscious. Stanley Hall has very forcibly put       the matter by using the illustration of the iceberg. Only       one-tenth of the iceberg is visible above water; nine-tenths is       beneath the surface. It may appear in a given instance that the       iceberg is being carried along by the prevailing winds and       surface currents, but if we keep our eyes open we shall sooner or       later see a berg going in the face of the wind, and, so,       apparently putting to naught all the laws of aerodynamics. We can       understand this only when we come to realize that much the       greater portion of the berg is beneath the surface and that it is       moving in response to invisible forces addressed against this       submerged portion.         Consciousness only arises late in the course of evolution and       only in connection with adjustments that are relatively complex.       When the same or similar conditions in the environment are       repeatedly presented to the organism so that it is called upon to       react in a similar and almost       identical way each time, there tends to be organized a mechanism       of reaction which becomes more and more automatic and is       accompanied by a state of mind of less and less awareness.[17]    [Footnote 17: White: _Mechanisms of Character Formation_.]    It is easy to see the economy of this arrangement which provides  ready-made patterns of reaction for habitual situations and leaves  consciousness free for new decisions. Since an automatic action,  traveling along well-worn brain paths, consumes little energy and  causes the minimum of fatigue, the plan not only frees consciousness  from a confusing number of details, but also works for the  conservation of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14988"],[0,"Cicero's Tusculan Disputations (#11)"],[1," two is the best, the immortal Gods know; but I do not  believe that any mortal man does.\"    XLII. Surely I would rather have had this man's soul than all the  fortunes of those who sat in judgment on him; although that very thing  which he says no one except the Gods know, namely, whether life or  death is most preferable, he knows himself, for he had previously  stated his opinion on it; but he maintained to the last that favorite  maxim of his, of affirming nothing. And let us, too, adhere to this  rule of not thinking anything an evil which is a general provision of  nature; and let us assure ourselves, that if death is an evil, it is an  eternal evil, for death seems to be the end of a miserable life; but if  death is a misery, there can be no end of that. But why do I mention  Socrates, or Theramenes, men distinguished by the glory of virtue and  wisdom? when a certain Lacedaemomian, whose name is not so much as  known, held death in such contempt, that, when led to it by the ephori,  he bore a cheerful and pleasant countenance; and, when he was asked by  one of his enemies whether he despised the laws of Lycurgus, \"On the  contrary,\" answered he, \"I am greatly obliged to him, for he has  amerced me in a fine which I can pay without borrowing, or taking up  money at interest.\" This was a man worthy of Sparta. And I am almost  persuaded of his innocence because of the greatness of his soul. Our  own city has produced many such. But why should I name generals, and  other men of high rank, when Cato could write that legions have marched  with alacrity to that place from whence they never expected to return?  With no less greatness of soul fell the Lacedaemonians at Thermopylae, on  whom Simonides wrote the following epitaph:        Go, stranger, tell the Spartans, here we lie,      Who to support their laws durst boldly die.[24]    What was it that Leonidas, their general, said to them? \"March on with  courage, my Lacedaemonians. To-night, perhaps, we shall sup in the  regions below.\" This was a brave nation while the laws of Lycurgus were  in force. One of them, when a Persian had said to him in conversation,  \"We shall hide the sun from your sight by the number of our arrows and  darts,\" replied, \"We shall fight, then in the shade.\" Do I talk of  their men? How great was that Lacedaemonian woman, who had sent her son  to battle, and when she heard that he was slain, said, \"I bore him for  that purpose, that you might have a man who durst die for his country!\"  However, it is a matter of notoriety that the Spartans were bold and  hardy, for the discipline of a republic has great influence.    XLIII. What, then, have we not reason to admire Theodorus the Cyrenean,  a philosopher of no small distinction, who, when Lysimachus threatened  to crucify him, bade him keep those menaces for his courtiers? \"To  Theodorus it makes no difference whether he rot in the air or  underground.\" By which saying of the philosopher I am reminded to say  something of the custom of funerals and sepulture, and of funeral  ceremonies, which is, indeed, not a difficult subject, especially if we  recollect what has been before said about insensibility. The opinion of  Socrates respecting this matter is clearly stated in the book which  treats of his death, of which we have already said so much; for when he  had discussed the immortality of the soul, and when the time of his  dying was approaching rapidly, being asked by Criton how he would be  buried, \"I have taken a great deal of pains,\" saith he, \"my friends, to  no purpose, for I have not convinced our Criton that I shall fly from  hence, and leave no part of me behind. Notwithstanding, Criton, if you  can overtake me, wheresoever you get hold of me, bury me as you please:  but believe me, none of you will be able to catch me when I have flown  away from hence.\" That was excellently said, inasmuch as he allows his  friend to do as he pleased, and yet shows his indifference about  anything of this kind. Diogenes was rougher, though of the same  opinion; but in his character of a Cynic he expressed himself in a  somewhat harsher manner; he ordered himself to be thrown anywhere  without being buried. And when his friends replied, \"What! to the birds  and beasts?\" \"By no means,\" saith he; \"place my staff near me, that I  may drive them away.\" \"How can you do that,\" they answer, \"for you will  not perceive them?\" \"How am I then injured by being torn by those  animals, if I have no sensation?\" Anaxagoras, when he was at the point  of death at Lampsacus, and was asked by his friends, whether, if  anything should happen to him, he would not choose to be carried to  Clazomenae, his country, made this excellent answer, \"There is,\" says  he, \"no occasion for that, for all places are at an equal distance from  the infernal regions.\" There is one thing to be observed with respect  to the whole subject of burial, that it relates to the body, whether  the soul live or die. Now, with regard to the body, it is clear that,  whether the soul live or die, that has no sensation.    XLIV. But all things are full of errors. Achilles drags Hector, tied to  his chariot; he thinks, I suppose, he tears his flesh, and that Hector  feels the pain of it; therefore, he avenges himself on him, as he  imagines. But Hecuba bewails this as a sore misfortune:        I saw (a dreadful sight) great Hector slain,      Dragg'd at Achilles' car along the plain.    What Hector? or how long will he be Hector? Accius is better in this,  and Achilles, too, is sometimes reasonable:        I Hector's body to his sire convey'd,      Hector I sent to the infernal shade.    It was not Hector that you dragged along, but a body that had been  Hector's. Here another starts from underground, and will not suffer his  mother to sleep:        To thee I call, my once-loved parent, hear,      Nor longer with thy sleep relieve thy care;      Thine eye which pities not is closed--arise;      Ling'ring I wait the unpaid obsequies.    When these verses are sung with a slow and melancholy tune, so as to  affect the whole theatre with sadness, one can scarce help thinking  those unhappy that are unburied:        Ere the devouring dogs and hungry vultures...    He is afraid he shall not have the use of his limbs so well if they are  torn to pieces, but is under no such apprehensions if they are burned:        Nor leave my naked bones, my poor remains,      To shameful violence and bloody stains.    I do not understand what he could fear who could pour forth such  excellent verses to the sound of the flute. We must, therefore, adhere  to this, that nothing is to be regarded after we are dead, though many  people revenge themselves on their dead enemies. Thyestes pours forth  several curses in some good lines of Ennius, praying, first of all,  that Atreus may perish by a shipwreck, which is certainly a very  terrible thing, for such a death is not free from very grievous  sensations. Then follow these unmeaning expressions:                                             May      On the sharp rock his mangled carcass lie,      His entrails torn, to hungry birds a prey!      May he convulsive writhe his bleeding side,      And with his clotted gore the stones be dyed!    The rocks themselves were not more destitute of feeling than he who was  hanging to them by his side; though Thyestes imagines he is wishing him  the greatest torture. It would be torture, indeed, if he were sensible;  but as he is not, it can be none; then how very unmeaning is this:        Let him, still hovering o'er the Stygian wave,      Ne'er reach the body's peaceful port, the grave!    You see under what mistaken notions all this is said. He imagines the  body has its haven, and that the dead are at rest in their graves.  Pelops was greatly to blame in not having informed and taught his son  what regard was due to everything.    XLV. But what occasion is there to animadvert on the opinions of  individuals, when we may observe whole nations to fall into all sorts  of errors? The Egyptians embalm their dead, and keep them in their  houses; the Persians dress them over with wax, and then bury them, that  they may preserve their bodies as long as possible. It is customary  with the Magi to bury none of their order, unless they have been first  torn by wild beasts. In Hyrcania, the people maintain dogs for the  public use; the nobles have their own--and we know that they have a  good breed of dogs; but every one, according to his ability, provides  himself with some, in order to be torn by them; and they hold that to  be the best kind of interment. Chrysippus, who is curious in all kinds  of historical facts, has collected many other things of this kind; but  some of them are so offensive as not to admit of being related. All  that has been said of burying is not worth our regard with respect to  ourselves, though it is not to be neglected as to our friends, provided  we are thoroughly aware that the dead are insensible. But the living,  indeed, should consider what is due to custom and opinion; only they  should at the same time consider that the dead are noways interested in  it. But death truly is then met with the greatest tranquillity when the  dying man can comfort himself with his own praise. No one dies too soon  who has finished the course of perfect virtue. I myself have known many  occasions when I have seemed in danger of immediate death; oh! how I  wish it had come to me! for I have gained nothing by the delay. I had  gone over and over again the duties of life; nothing remained but to  contend with fortune. If reason, then, cannot sufficiently fortify us  to enable us to feel a contempt for death, at all events let our past  life prove that we have lived long enough, and even longer than was  necessary; for notwithstanding the deprivation of sense, the dead are  not without that good which peculiarly belongs to them, namely, the  praise and glory which they have"]]]
