Nothing short of His all-encompassing grace, His  all-pervading mercy, could have possibly achieved it. How could it,  otherwise, have been possible for sheer nothingness to have acquired by  itself the worthiness and capacity to emerge from its state of  non-existence into the realm of being?    Having created the world and all that liveth and moveth therein, He,  through the direct operation of His unconstrained and sovereign Will,  chose to confer upon man the unique distinction and capacity to know Him  and to love Him--a capacity that must needs be regarded as the generating  impulse and the primary purpose underlying the whole of creation.... Upon  the inmost reality of each and every created thing He hath shed the light  of one of His names, and made it a recipient of the glory of one of His  attributes. Upon the reality of man, however, He hath focused the radiance  of all of His names and attributes, and made it a mirror of His own Self.  Alone of all created things man hath been singled out for so great a  favor, so enduring a bounty.    These energies with which the Day Star of Divine bounty and Source of  heavenly guidance hath endowed the reality of man lie, however, latent  within him, even as the flame is hidden within the candle and the rays of  light are potentially present in the lamp. The radiance of these energies  may be obscured by worldly desires even as the light of the sun can be  concealed beneath the dust and dross which cover the mirror. Neither the  candle nor the lamp can be lighted through their own unaided efforts, nor  can it ever be possible for the mirror to free itself from its dross. It  is clear and evident that until a fire is kindled the lamp will never be  ignited, and unless the dross is blotted out from the face of the mirror  it can never represent the image of the sun nor reflect its light and  glory.    And since there can be no tie of direct intercourse to bind the one true  God with His creation, and no resemblance whatever can exist between the  transient and the Eternal, the contingent and the Absolute, He hath  ordained that in every age and dispensation a pure and stainless Soul be  made manifest in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. Unto this subtle, this  mysterious and ethereal Being He hath assigned a twofold nature; the  physical, pertaining to the world of matter, and the spiritual, which is  born of the substance of God Himself. He hath, moreover, conferred upon  Him a double station. The first station, which is related to His innermost  reality, representeth Him as One Whose voice is the voice of God Himself.  To this testifieth the tradition: \"Manifold and mysterious is My  relationship with God. I am He, Himself, and He is I, Myself, except that  I am that I am, and He is that He is.\" And in like manner, the words:  \"Arise, O Muhammad, for lo, the Lover and the Beloved are joined together  and made one in Thee.\" He similarly saith: \"There is no distinction  whatsoever between Thee and Them, except that They are Thy Servants.\" The  second station is the human station, exemplified by the following verses:  \"I am but a man like you.\" \"Say, praise be to my Lord! Am I more than a  man, an apostle?\" These Essences of Detachment, these resplendent  Realities are the channels of God's all-pervasive grace. Led by the light  of unfailing guidance, and invested with supreme sovereignty, They are  commissioned to use the inspiration of Their words, the effusions of Their  infallible grace and the sanctifying breeze of Their Revelation for the  cleansing of every longing heart and receptive spirit from the dross and  dust of earthly cares and limitations. Then, and only then, will the Trust  of God, latent in the reality of man, emerge, as resplendent as the rising  Orb of Divine Revelation, from behind the veil of concealment, and implant  the ensign of its revealed glory upon the summits of men's hearts.    From the foregoing passages and allusions it hath been made indubitably  clear that in the kingdoms of earth and heaven there must needs be  manifested a Being, an Essence Who shall act as a Manifestation and  Vehicle for the transmission of the grace of the Divinity Itself, the  Sovereign Lord of all. Through the Teachings of this Day Star of Truth  every man will advance and develop until he attaineth the station at which  he can manifest all the potential forces with which his inmost true self  hath been endowed. It is for this very purpose that in every age and  dispensation the Prophets of God and His chosen Ones have appeared amongst  men, and have evinced such power as is born of God and such might as only  the Eternal can reveal.    Can one of sane mind ever seriously imagine that, in view of certain words  the meaning of which he cannot comprehend, the portal of God's infinite  guidance can ever be closed in the face of men? Can he ever conceive for  these Divine Luminaries, these resplendent Lights either a beginning or an  end? What outpouring flood can compare with the stream of His  all-embracing grace, and what blessing can excel the evidences of so great  and pervasive a mercy? There can be no doubt whatever that if for one  moment the tide of His mercy and grace were to be withheld from the world,  it would completely perish. For this reason, from the beginning that hath  no beginning the portals of Divine mercy have been flung open to the face  of all created things, and the clouds of Truth will continue to the end  that hath no end to rain on the soil of human capacity, reality and  personality their favors and bounties. Such hath been God's method  continued from everlasting to everlasting.            XXVIII: HAPPY IS THE MAN WHO WILL ARISE TO SERVE...      Happy is the man who will arise to serve My Cause, and glorify My  beauteous Name. Take hold of My Book with the power of My might, and  cleave tenaciously to whatsoever commandment thy Lord, the Ordainer, the  All-Wise, hath prescribed therein. Behold, O Muhammad, how the sayings and  doings of the followers of _Sh_i'ih Islam have dulled the joy and fervor  of its early days, and tarnished the pristine brilliancy of its light. In  its primitive days, whilst they still adhered to the precepts associated  with the name of their Prophet, the Lord of mankind, their career was  marked by an unbroken chain of victories and triumphs. As they gradually  strayed from the path of their Ideal Leader and Master, as they turned  away from the Light of God and corrupted the principle of His Divine  unity, and as they increasingly centered their attention upon them who  were only the revealers of the potency of His Word, their power was turned  into weakness, their glory into shame, their courage into fear. Thou dost  witness to what a pass they have come. Behold, how they have joined  partners with Him Who is the Focal-Point of Divine unity. Behold how their  evil doings have hindered them from recognizing, in the Day of  Resurrection, the Word of Truth, exalted be His glory. We cherish the hope  that this people will henceforth shield themselves from vain hopes and  idle fancies, and will attain to a true understanding of the meaning of  Divine unity.    The Person of the Manifestation hath ever been the representative and  mouthpiece of God. He, in truth, is the Day Spring of God's most excellent  Titles, and the Dawning-Place of His exalted Attributes. If any be set up  by His side as peers, if they be regarded as identical with His Person,  how can it, then, be maintained that the Divine Being is One and  Incomparable, that His Essence is indivisible and peerless? Meditate on  that which We have, through the power of truth, revealed unto thee, and be  thou of them that comprehend its meaning.            XXIX: THE PURPOSE OF GOD IN CREATING MAN HATH...      The purpose of God in creating man hath been, and will ever be, to enable  him to know his Creator and to attain His Presence. To this most excellent  aim, this supreme objective, all the heavenly Books and the  divinely-revealed and weighty Scriptures unequivocally bear witness. Whoso  hath recognized the Day Spring of Divine guidance and entered His holy  court hath drawn nigh unto God and attained His Presence, a Presence which  is the real Paradise, and of which the loftiest mansions of heaven are but  a symbol. Such a man hath attained the knowledge of the station of Him Who  is \"at the distance of two bows,\" Who standeth beyond the  Sadratu'l-Muntaha. Whoso hath failed to recognize Him will have condemned  himself to the misery of remoteness, a remoteness which is naught but  utter nothingness and the essence of the nethermost fire. Such will be his  fate, though to outward seeming he may occupy the earth's loftiest seats  and be established upon its most exalted throne.    He Who is the Day Spring of Truth is, no doubt, fully capable of rescuing  from such remoteness wayward souls and of causing them to draw nigh unto  His court and attain His Presence. \"If God had pleased He had surely made  all men one people.\" His purpose, however, is to enable the pure in spirit  and the detached in heart to ascend, by virtue of their own innate powers,  unto the shores of the Most Great Ocean, that thereby they who seek the  Beauty of the All-Glorious may be distinguished and separated from the  wayward and perverse. Thus hath it been ordained by the all-glorious and  resplendent Pen....    That the Manifestations of Divine justice, the Day Springs of heavenly  grace, have when they appeared amongst men always been destitute of all  earthly dominion and shorn of the means of worldly ascendancy, should be  attributed to this same principle of separation and distinction which  animateth the Divine Purpose. Were the Eternal Essence to manifest all  that is latent within Him, were He to shine in the plentitude of His  glory, none would be found to question His power or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16949"],[0,"Flowers from a Persian Garden and Other Papers (#11)"],[1,"roof is free; what would happen? You are a  young man--jump down.\" The man jumped down, and his ankle was  dislocated, and for a whole year he was bedridden, and his ankle came  not back to its place. Next year the man again went on the roof of his  house and repaired it. Then he called to his wife, \"Ho! wife, how shall  I come down?\" The woman said, \"Jump not; thine ankle has not yet come to  its place--come down gently.\" The man replied, \"The other time, for that  I followed thy words, and not those of the Apostle [i.e., Muhammed], was  my ankle dislocated, and it is not yet come to its place; now shall I  follow the words of the Apostle, and do the contrary of what thou sayest  [Kuran, iii, 29.]\" And he jumped down, and straightway his ankle came to  its place.       [25] \"Bear in mind,\" says Thorkel to Bork, in the Icelandic          saga of Gisli the Outlaw, \"bear in mind that a woman's          counsel is always unlucky.\"--On the other hand, quoth          Panurge, \"Truly I have found a great deal of good in the          counsel of women, chiefly in that of the old wives among          them.\"           *       *       *       *       *    In the Turkish collection of jests ascribed to Khoja Nasru 'd-Din  Efendi[26] is the following, which has been reproduced amongst ourselves  within comparatively recent years, and credited to an Irish priest:    One day the Khoja went into the pulpit of a mosque to preach to the  people. \"O men!\" said he, \"do you know what I should say unto you?\" They  answered: \"We know not, Efendi.\" \"When you do know,\" said the Khoja, \"I  shall take the trouble of addressing you.\" The next day he again  ascended into the pulpit, and said, as before: \"O men! do you know what  I should say unto you?\" \"We do know,\" exclaimed they all with one voice.  \"Then,\" said he, \"what is the use of my addressing you, since you  already know?\" The third day he once more went into the pulpit, and  asked the same question. The people, having consulted together as to the  answer they should make, said: \"O Khoja, some of us know, and some of us  do not know.\" \"If that be the case, let those who know tell those who do  not know,\" said the Khoja, coming down. A poor Arab preacher was once,  however, not quite so successful. Having \"given out,\" as we say, for his  text, these words, from the Kuran, \"I have called Noah,\" and being  unable to collect his thoughts, he repeated, over and over again, \"I  have called Noah,\" and finally came to a dead stop; when one of those  present shouted, \"If Noah will not come, call some one else.\" Akin to  this is our English jest of the deacon of a dissenting chapel in  Yorkshire, who undertook, in the vanity of his heart, to preach on the  Sunday, in place of the pastor, who was ill, or from home. He conducted  the devotional exercises fairly well, but when he came to deliver his  sermon, on the text, \"I am the Light of the world,\" he had forgot what  he intended to say, and continued to repeat these words, until an old  man called out, \"If thou be the light o' the world, I think thou needs  snuffin' badly.\"       [26] The Khoja was contemporary with the renowned conqueror          of nations, Timur, or Timurleng, or, as the name is          usually written in this country, Tamarlane, though there          does not appear to be any authority that he was the          official jester at the court of that monarch, as some          writers have asserted. The pleasantries ascribed to the          Khoja--the title now generally signifies Teacher, or          School-master, but formerly it was somewhat equivalent          to our \"Mr,\" or, more familiarly, \"Goodman\"--have been          completely translated into French. Of course, a large          proportion of the jests have been taken from Arabian and          Persian collections, though some are doubtless genuine;          and they represent the Khoja as a curious compound of          shrewdness and simplicity. A number of the foolish          sayings and doings fathered on him are given in my _Book          of Noodles_, 1888.    To return to the Turkish jest-book. One day the Khoja borrowed a  cauldron from a brazier, and returned it with a little saucepan inside.  The owner, seeing the saucepan, asked: \"What is this?\" Quoth the Khoja:  \"Why, the cauldron has had a young one\"; whereupon the brazier, well  pleased, took possession of the saucepan. Some time after this the Khoja  again borrowed the cauldron and took it home. At the end of a week the  brazier called at the Khoja's house and asked for his cauldron. \"O set  your mind at rest,\" said the Khoja; \"the cauldron is dead.\" \"O Khoja,\"  quoth the brazier, \"can a cauldron die?\" Responded the Khoja: \"Since you  believed it could have a young one, why should you not also believe that  it could die?\"    The Khoja had a pleasant way of treating beggars. One day a man knocked  at his door. \"What do you want?\" cried the Khoja from above. \"Come  down,\" said the man. The Khoja accordingly came down, and again said:  \"What do you want?\" \"I want charity,\" said the man. \"Come up stairs,\"  said the Khoja. When the beggar had come up, the Khoja said: \"God help  you\"--the customary reply to a beggar when one will not or cannot give  him anything. \"O master,\" cried the man, \"why did you not say so below?\"  Quoth the Khoja: \"When I was above stairs, why did you bring me down?\"    Drunkenness is punished (or punishable) by the infliction of eighty  strokes of the bastinado in Muslim countries, but it is only flagrant  cases that are thus treated, and there is said to be not a little  private drinking of spirits as well as of wine among the higher classes,  especially Turks and Persians. It happened that the governor of  Suricastle lay in a state of profound intoxication in a garden one day,  and was thus discovered by the Khoja, who was taking a walk in the same  garden with his friend Ahmed. The Khoja instantly stripped him of his  _ferage_, or upper garment, and, putting it on his own back, walked  away. When the governor awoke and saw that his ferage had been stolen,  he told his officers to bring before him whomsoever they found wearing  it. The officers, seeing the ferage on the Khoja, seized and brought him  before the governor, who said to him: \"Ho! Khoja, where did you obtain  that ferage?\" The Khoja responded \"As I was taking a walk with my friend  Ahmed we saw a fellow lying drunk, whereupon I took off his ferage and  went away with it. If it be yours, pray take it.\" \"O no,\" said the  governor, \"it does not belong to me.\"    Even being robbed could not disturb the Khoja's good humour. When he was  lying in bed one night a loud noise was heard in the street before his  house. Said he to his wife: \"Get up and light a candle, and I will go  and see what is the matter.\" \"You had much better stay where you are,\"  advised his wife. But the Khoja, without heeding her words, put the  counterpane on his shoulders and went out. A fellow, on perceiving him,  immediately snatched the counterpane from off the Khoja's shoulders and  ran away. Shivering with cold, the Khoja returned into the house, and  when his wife asked him the cause of the noise, he said: \"It was on  account of our counterpane; when they got that, the noise ceased at  once.\"    But in the following story we have a very old acquaintance in a new  dress: One day the Khoja's wife, in order to plague him, served up some  exceedingly hot broth, and, forgetting what she had done, put a spoonful  of it in her mouth, which so scalded her that the tears came into her  eyes. \"O wife,\" said the Khoja, \"what is the matter with you--is the  broth hot?\" \"Dear Efendi,\" said she, \"my mother, who is now dead, loved  broth very much; I thought of that, and wept on her account.\" The Khoja,  thinking that what she said was truth, took a spoonful of the broth,  and, it burning his mouth, he began to bellow. \"What is the matter with  you?\" said his wife. \"Why do you cry?\" Quoth the Khoja: \"You cry because  your mother is gone, but I cry because her daughter is here.\"[27]       [27] This is how the same story is told in our oldest English          jest-book, entitled _A Hundred Mery Talys_ (1525): A          certain merchant and a courtier being upon a time at          dinner, having a hot custard, the courtier, being          somewhat homely of manner, took part of it and put it in          his mouth, which was so hot that it made him shed tears.          The merchant, looking on him, thought that he had been          weeping, and asked him why he wept. This courtier, not          willing it to be known that he had brent his mouth with          the hot custard, answered and said, \"Sir,\" quod he, \"I          had a brother which did a certain offence, wherefore he          was hanged.\" The merchant thought the courtier had said          true, and anon, after the merchant was disposed to eat          of the custard, and put a spoonful of it into his mouth,          and brent his mouth also, that his eyes watered. This          courtier, that perceiving, spake to the merchant; and          said, \"Sir,\" quod he, \"why do ye weep now?\" The merchant          perceived how he had been deceived, and said, \"Marry,\"          quod he, \"I weep because thou wast not hanged when that          thy brother was hanged.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Many of the Muslim jests, like some our of own, are at the expense of  poor preachers. Thus: there was in Baghdad a preacher whom no one  attended after hearing him but once. One Friday when he came down from  the pulpit he discovered that the only one who remained in the mosque  was the muezzin--all his hearers had left him to finish his discourse  as, and when, he pleased--and, still worse, his slippers had also  disappeared. Accusing the muezzin of having stolen them, \"I am rightly  served by your suspicion,\" retorted he, \"for being the only one that  remained to hear you.\"--In Gladwin's _Persian "]]]
