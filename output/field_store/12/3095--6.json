(p. 86, ll. 3-6)    In the Sapphic strophe of Francisco de la Torre (d. 1594),  the short line has seven syllables, and the long line may  have inner rhythmic accent on the sixth, or on the fourth  syllable. Thus:      El frio Boreas y el helado Noto    Apoderados de la mar insana    Anegaron agora en este puerto            Una dichosa nave.    (_iTirsi, Tirsi! vuelve y endereza_)    The Sapphic strophe of Francisco de la Torre has been not  infrequently imitated. Thus, Becquer:      Volveran las obscuras golondrinas    En tu balcon sus nidos a colgar,    Y, otra vez, con el ala a sus cristales            Jugando llamaran.      (p. 122, l. 24-p. 123, l. 2)[32]    [Footnote 32: These long lines are especially cantabile, as  most are accented on the third and sixth syllables. Only  one is accented on the fourth and eighth.]    The 7-syllable line is commonly used in combination with  those of eleven syllables (see above). In the seventeenth  century, particularly, the 7-syllable line was used in  anacreontics, artistic _romances, quintillas,_                page lxvi  etc., in imitation of the Italian _settenario_, as in  Villegas' _Cantilena_ beginning:      Yo vi sobre un tomillo    Quejarse un pajarillo,    Viendo su nido amado,    De quien era caudillo,    De un labrador robado.    In present-day songs the 7-syllable line is rather rare,  except in combination with lines of five syllables, as in:      Camino de Valencia,      Camino largo...    And:      A la puerta del cielo      Venden zapatos...    In these lines there is no fixed inner rhythmic accent.    The Old Spanish Alexandrine verse-line was composed of two  7-syllable half-lines. In the thirteenth and fourteenth  centuries numerous monkish narrative poems (_mester de  clerecia_) were written in this measure:      En el nonbre del Padre,--que fizo toda cosa,    E de don Jhesu Christo,--Fijo dela Gloriosa,    Et del Spiritu Sancto,--que egual dellos posa,    De un confessor sancto--quiero fer vna prosa...    (Gonzalo de Berceo)    The old Alexandrine fell before the rising popularity of  the _arte mayor_ verse early in the fifteenth century. In  the eighteenth century a 13-syllable Alexandrine appears  in Spanish in imitation of the classic French line. This  later Spanish Alexandrine is not composed of two distinct  half-lines. It also has, like its French                     page lxvii  prototype, alternate couplets of masculine and feminine  lines (_versos agudos_ and _versos llanos_ or _graves_).  Thus, Iriarte:      En cierta catedral una campana habia    Que solo se tocaba algun solemne dia    Con el mas recio son, con pausado compas,    Cuatro golpes o tres solia dar, no mas.    There is an inner rhythmic accent on the sixth syllable.  Iriarte also revived the older Alexandrine, but without  hiatus:      Cuando veo yo algunos,--que de otros escritores    A la sombra se arriman,--y piensan ser autores...    Recent poets have revived the old Alexandrine.[33] Thus,  Ruben Dario uses it, even retaining the hiatus between the  half-lines; but instead of grouping the lines in quatrains  with monorime, as the old monks did, he uses assonance  in alternate lines, which is, so far as I know, without  precedent:      Es con voz de la Biblia--o verso de Withman    Que habria que llegar--hasta ti, icazador!    Primitivo y moderno,--sencillo y complicado,    Con un algo de Washington--y mucho de Nemrod...    (p. 211, ll. 1-4)    [Footnote 33: For their use of this line with ternary  movement, see p. lxxix.]    Lines of five or six syllables usually have a mingled  binary and ternary movement:      Una barquera    Halle bizarra,    De pocos anos    Y muchas gracias.      (N. Moratin)                                                              page lxviii    Sali a las diez    A ver a Clori    (No lo acerte):    Horas menguadas    Debe de haber...      (L. Moratin)    Lines of 5+5 syllables (_versos asclepiadeos_) are  occasionally written:      Id en las alas--del raudo cefiro,    Humildes versos,--de las floridas    Vegas que diafano--fecunda el Arlas,    Adonde lento--mi patrio rio    Ve los alcazares--de Mantua excelsa.      (L. Moratin)    The Mexican poet Pesado used the same line in his  _Serenata_:      iOh tu que duermes--en casto lecho,    De sinsabores--ajeno el pecho,    Y a los encantos--de la hermosura    Unes las gracias--del corazon,    Deja el descanso,--doncella pura,    Y oye los ecos--de mi cancion!    (P. 199, ll. 1-6)    The same measure appears in a patriotic song, _Himno de  Riego_:      En las cabezas--el proclamo    La suspirada--constitucion,    Y enarbolando--marcial pendon,    A los leales--acaudillo...[34]    [Footnote 34: It should be noted that these latter verses,  like most Spanish patriotic songs, are sung with ternary  movement, thus:      En las cabezas--el proclamo...]                                                                page lxix  This 10-syllable measure is cantabile, and its phrases are  too short and too regular to make good recitative verse.    _Versos alcaicos_ differ from the _asclepiadeos_ in that  the former have, in a strophe, two lines of 5 + 5, one of  nine, and one of ten syllables. Thus, in these lines of  Victorio Giner (who probably introduced this strophe into  Spain in the second half of the nineteenth century):      Y si los nautas, cantando el pielago,    Con remos hieren y espumas alzan,      Se aduerme a los ecos sus penas    Y a los ecos su batel avanza.    Juan Luis Estelrich (_Poesias_, 1900) uses _versos  alcaicos_ with the first two lines of each strophe  _esdrujulo_, in imitation of Carducci:      Carmen, tu nombre trae al espiritu    Vuelo de aromas, susurro de arboles,      Los pios consorcios del cielo,    Y el cantar melodioso del Lacio.      (_A Carmen Valera._)[35]    [Footnote 35: Cf. Mele, _op. cit._]    _Romances_ in lines of 6 + 6 (or 6 + 5) syllables occur  in popular Spanish verse, as in the Asturian _romance_ of  _Don Bueso_, beginning:      Camina don Bueso--mananita fria    a tierra de moros--a buscar amiga...    (Men. Pel., _Ant._ X, 56: cf. also _Ant._ XI, 102)    This measure was also used in _endechas_, as in _Los  comendadores de Cordoba_ (fifteenth century), beginning:      iLos comendadores,--por mi mal os vi!    Yo vi a vosotros,--vosotros a mi...                                                                 page lxx  The 9-syllable line was not well received in Spain, and it  has been little used. Iriarte, in his desire to vary the  metrical constructions of his fables, used it at least  once:      Sobre una mesa, cierto dia,    Dando estaba conversacion    A un Abanico y a un Manguito    Un Paraguas o Quitasol...    There is certainly no fixed inner rhythmic accent in these  lines. The fact seems to be that the 9-syllable line is  too long to be uttered comfortably in one phrase, or  breath-group, and it is too short to be regularly divided  into parts by cesura.      B. VERSE WITH TERNARY MOVEMENT    Verse with regular ternary movement may occur in lines of  any length, but it is commonly found only in lines of ten,  eleven or twelve syllables. Many ternary lines of five and  six syllables are found, but they are almost invariably  mingled with binary lines. This _rondel antiguo_ (Nebrija,  quoted by Men. Pel., _Ant._ V. 66) is ternary throughout,  it would seem:      Despide plazer    y pone tristura;    crece en querer    vuestra hermosura.    For mixed movements, see the _serranilla_ on p. 45, l. 9  f.    In lines with _regular_ ternary movement, properly  speaking, every primary stress receives a rhythmic accent,  and these accents are always separated by two                 page lxxi  atonic syllables, as in:      Yo no se como bailan aqui,    Que en mi tierra no bailan ansi...    Rarely one finds 6-syllable and 9-syllable lines with  regular ternary movement, and these are probably never of  popular origin. Thus:      Serena la luna    Alumbra en el cielo,    Domina en el suelo    Profunda quietud...    (Espronceda, _El reo de muerte_, II)      Y luego el estrepito crece    Confuso y mezclado en un son,    Que ronco en las bovedas hondas    Tronando furioso zumbo...    (Espronceda, _Estudiante de Salamanca_)    Formerly the Spanish 10-syllable line occurred usually in  combination with other lines, as in:        En la calle de Atocha, iliton!          Que vive mi dama;      Yo me llamo Bartolo, iliton!    Litoque, vitoque, y[36] ella Catanla.    --En la calle del Sordo, iliton!         Que vive mi mozo,      Pues a cuanto le pido, iliton!    Litoque, vitoque, que siempre esta sordo.    [Footnote 36: There is hiatus here.]    (Quinones de Benavente, _Entremeses, bailes, loas y  sainetes_, quoted by Mila y Fontanals, _Obras completas_,  Vol. V, p. 324 f.)                                                               page lxxii  Calderon used it in the _Vina del Senor_:        A la vina, a la vina, zagales;    Zagales, venid, venid a la vina.      A la vina, a la vina, zagales,    Y vaya de jira, de bulla y de baile.    Zagales, venid, venid a la vina,    Y vaya de baile, de bulla y de jira.    A recent number of the _Ilustracion Espanola y Americana _  (15 Enero, 1911) contains lines of similar construction by  Don Rafael Torrome:        Al mirar su carita sonriente,          Tan dulce y tan buena,      Siempre observo que mi alma presiente,          Con duelo y con pena,      Que mas tarde este mundo inclemente      Trocara en sentimientos de hiena    Los puros afectos de su alma inocente.    Iriarte did not hesitate to write fables in these  10-syllable lines alone:      De sus hijos la torpe Aveturda    El pesado volar conocia...    And the romanticists of the nineteenth century used it not  infrequently:      Con inmovil, ironica mueca    Inclinaron formando en redor...    (Espronceda, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1606"],[0,"Kenilworth (#11)"],[1,"him not to fear  that I will come, and in such a manner that all the grief Amy has given  him shall be forgotten--the poor Amy is now greater than she dare name.  Go, good Tressilian--I have injured thee too, but believe me I have  power to heal the wounds I have caused. I robbed you of a childish  heart, which was not worthy of you, and I can repay the loss with  honours and advancement.\"    \"Do you say this to me, Amy?--do you offer me pageants of idle ambition,  for the quiet peace you have robbed me of!--But be it so I came not  to upbraid, but to serve and to free you. You cannot disguise it from  me--you are a prisoner. Otherwise your kind heart--for it was once a  kind heart--would have been already at your father's bedside.--Come,  poor, deceived, unhappy maiden!--all shall be forgot--all shall be  forgiven. Fear not my importunity for what regarded our contract--it was  a dream, and I have awaked. But come--your father yet lives--come, and  one word of affection, one tear of penitence, will efface the memory of  all that has passed.\"    \"Have I not already said, Tressilian,\" replied she, \"that I will surely  come to my father, and that without further delay than is necessary to  discharge other and equally binding duties?--Go, carry him the news;  I come as sure as there is light in heaven--that is, when I obtain  permission.\"    \"Permission!--permission to visit your father on his sick-bed, perhaps  on his death-bed!\" repeated Tressilian, impatiently; \"and permission  from whom? From the villain, who, under disguise of friendship, abused  every duty of hospitality, and stole thee from thy father's roof!\"    \"Do him no slander, Tressilian! He whom thou speakest of wears a sword  as sharp as thine--sharper, vain man; for the best deeds thou hast  ever done in peace or war were as unworthy to be named with his, as thy  obscure rank to match itself with the sphere he moves in.--Leave me!  Go, do mine errand to my father; and when he next sends to me, let him  choose a more welcome messenger.\"    \"Amy,\" replied Tressilian calmly, \"thou canst not move me by thy  reproaches. Tell me one thing, that I may bear at least one ray of  comfort to my aged friend:--this rank of his which thou dost boast--dost  thou share it with him, Amy?--does he claim a husband's right to control  thy motions?\"    \"Stop thy base, unmannered tongue!\" said the lady; \"to no question that  derogates from my honour do I deign an answer.\"    \"You have said enough in refusing to reply,\" answered Tressilian;  \"and mark me, unhappy as thou art, I am armed with thy father's full  authority to command thy obedience, and I will save thee from the  slavery of sin and of sorrow, even despite of thyself, Amy.\"    \"Menace no violence here!\" exclaimed the lady, drawing back from him,  and alarmed at the determination expressed in his look and manner;  \"threaten me not, Tressilian, for I have means to repel force.\"    \"But not, I trust, the wish to use them in so evil a cause?\" said  Tressilian. \"With thy will--thine uninfluenced, free, and natural will,  Amy, thou canst not choose this state of slavery and dishonour. Thou  hast been bound by some spell--entrapped by some deceit--art now  detained by some compelled vow. But thus I break the charm--Amy, in the  name of thine excellent, thy broken-hearted father, I command thee to  follow me!\"    As he spoke he advanced and extended his arm, as with the purpose of  laying hold upon her. But she shrunk back from his grasp, and uttered  the scream which, as we before noticed, brought into the apartment  Lambourne and Foster.    The latter exclaimed, as soon as he entered, \"Fire and fagot! what  have we here?\" Then addressing the lady, in a tone betwixt entreaty  and command, he added, \"Uds precious! madam, what make you here out of  bounds? Retire--retire--there is life and death in this matter.--And  you, friend, whoever you may be, leave this house--out with you, before  my dagger's hilt and your costard become acquainted.--Draw, Mike, and  rid us of the knave!\"    \"Not I, on my soul,\" replied Lambourne; \"he came hither in my  company, and he is safe from me by cutter's law, at least till we meet  again.--But hark ye, my Cornish comrade, you have brought a Cornish flaw  of wind with you hither, a hurricanoe as they call it in the Indies.  Make yourself scarce--depart--vanish--or we'll have you summoned before  the Mayor of Halgaver, and that before Dudman and Ramhead meet.\" [Two  headlands on the Cornish coast. The expressions are proverbial.]    \"Away, base groom!\" said Tressilian.--\"And you, madam, fare you  well--what life lingers in your father's bosom will leave him at the  news I have to tell.\"    He departed, the lady saying faintly as he left the room, \"Tressilian,  be not rash--say no scandal of me.\"    \"Here is proper gear,\" said Foster. \"I pray you go to your chamber, my  lady, and let us consider how this is to be answered--nay, tarry not.\"    \"I move not at your command, sir,\" answered the lady.    \"Nay, but you must, fair lady,\" replied Foster; \"excuse my freedom, but,  by blood and nails, this is no time to strain courtesies--you MUST go to  your chamber.--Mike, follow that meddling coxcomb, and, as you desire  to thrive, see him safely clear of the premises, while I bring this  headstrong lady to reason. Draw thy tool, man, and after him.\"    \"I'll follow him,\" said Michael Lambourne, \"and see him fairly out  of Flanders; but for hurting a man I have drunk my morning's draught  withal, 'tis clean against my conscience.\" So saying, he left the  apartment.    Tressilian, meanwhile, with hasty steps, pursued the first path which  promised to conduct him through the wild and overgrown park in which the  mansion of Foster was situated. Haste and distress of mind led his steps  astray, and instead of taking the avenue which led towards the village,  he chose another, which, after he had pursued it for some time with a  hasty and reckless step, conducted him to the other side of the demesne,  where a postern door opened through the wall, and led into the open  country.    Tressilian paused an instant. It was indifferent to him by what road he  left a spot now so odious to his recollections; but it was probable  that the postern door was locked, and his retreat by that pass rendered  impossible.    \"I must make the attempt, however,\" he said to himself; \"the only means  of reclaiming this lost--this miserable--this still most lovely and most  unhappy girl, must rest in her father's appeal to the broken laws of his  country. I must haste to apprise him of this heartrending intelligence.\"    As Tressilian, thus conversing with himself, approached to try some  means of opening the door, or climbing over it, he perceived there was  a key put into the lock from the outside. It turned round, the bolt  revolved, and a cavalier, who entered, muffled in his riding-cloak, and  wearing a slouched hat with a drooping feather, stood at once within  four yards of him who was desirous of going out. They exclaimed at  once, in tones of resentment and surprise, the one \"Varney!\" the other  \"Tressilian!\"    \"What make you here?\" was the stern question put by the stranger to  Tressilian, when the moment of surprise was past--\"what make you here,  where your presence is neither expected nor desired?\"    \"Nay, Varney,\" replied Tressilian, \"what make you here? Are you come  to triumph over the innocence you have destroyed, as the vulture or  carrion-crow comes to batten on the lamb whose eyes it has first plucked  out? Or are you come to encounter the merited vengeance of an honest  man? Draw, dog, and defend thyself!\"    Tressilian drew his sword as he spoke, but Varney only laid his hand  on the hilt of his own, as he replied, \"Thou art mad, Tressilian. I own  appearances are against me; but by every oath a priest can make or a man  can swear, Mistress Amy Robsart hath had no injury from me. And in truth  I were somewhat loath to hurt you in this cause--thou knowest I can  fight.\"    \"I have heard thee say so, Varney,\" replied Tressilian; \"but now,  methinks, I would fain have some better evidence than thine own word.\"    \"That shall not be lacking, if blade and hilt be but true to me,\"  answered Varney; and drawing his sword with the right hand, he threw his  cloak around his left, and attacked Tressilian with a vigour which,  for a moment, seemed to give him the advantage of the combat. But this  advantage lasted not long. Tressilian added to a spirit determined on  revenge a hand and eye admirably well adapted to the use of the rapier;  so that Varney, finding himself hard pressed in his turn, endeavoured  to avail himself of his superior strength by closing with his adversary.  For this purpose, he hazarded the receiving one of Tressilian's passes  in his cloak, wrapped as it was around his arm, and ere his adversary  could, extricate his rapier thus entangled, he closed with him,  shortening his own sword at the same time, with the purpose of  dispatching him. But Tressilian was on his guard, and unsheathing his  poniard, parried with the blade of that weapon the home-thrust which  would otherwise have finished the combat, and, in the struggle which  followed, displayed so much address, as might have confirmed, the  opinion that he drew his origin from Cornwall whose natives are such  masters in the art of wrestling, as, were the games of antiquity  revived, might enable them to challenge all Europe to the ring. Varney,  in his ill-advised attempt, received a fall so sudden and violent that  his sword flew several paces from his hand and ere he could recover his  feet, that of his antagonist was; pointed to his throat.    \"Give me the instant means of relieving the victim of thy treachery,\"  said Tressilian, \"or take the last look of your Creator's blessed sun!\"    And while Varney, too confused or too sullen to reply, made a sudden  effort to arise, his adversary drew back his arm, and would have"]]]
