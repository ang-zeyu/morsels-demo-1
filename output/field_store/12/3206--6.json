That he wrote the sublime judgment song there is now  practically no question.    The label on the discovered manuscript would suggest that the writer did  not consider it either a hymn or a poem. Like the inspired prophets he  had meditated--and while he was musing the fire burned. The only title  he wrote over it was \"_Prosa de mortuis_,\" Prosa (or prosa oratio)--from  _prorsus_, \"straight forward\"--appears here in the truly conventional  sense it was beginning to bear, but not yet as the antipode of \"poetry.\"  The modest author, unconscious of the magnitude of his work, called it  simply \"Plain speech concerning the dead.\"[7]    [Footnote 7: \"Proses\" were original passages introduced into  ecclesiastical chants in the 10th century. During and after the 11th  century they were called \"Sequences\" (i.e. _following_ the \"Gospel\" in  the liturgy), and were in metrical form, having a prayerful tone.  \"Sequentia pro defunctis\" was the later title of the \"Dies Irae.\"]    The hymn is much too long to quote entire, but can be found in _Daniel's  Thesaurus_ in any large public library. As to the translations of it,  they number hundreds--in English and German alone, and Italy, Spain and  Portugal have their vernacular versions--not to mention the Greek and  Russian and even the Hebrew. A few stanzas follow, with their renderings  into English (always imperfect) selected almost at random:            Quantus tremor est futurus          Quando Judex est venturus,          Cuncta stricte discussurus!            Tuba mirum spargens sonum          Per sepulcra regionum,          Coget omnes ante thronum!        O the dread, the contrite kneeling      When the Lord, in Judgment dealing,      Comes each hidden thing revealing!        When the trumpet's awful tone      Through the realms sepulchral blown,      Summons all before the Throne!    The solemn strength and vibration of these tremendous trilineals suffers  no general injury by the variant readings--and there are a good many. As  a sample, the first stanza was changed by some canonical redactor to get  rid of the heathen word Sybilla, and the second line was made the  third:            Dies Irae, dies illa          Crucis expandens vexilla,          Solvet saeclum in favilla.        Day of wrath! that day foretold,      With the cross-flag wide unrolled,      Shall the world in fire enfold!    In some readings the original \"in favilla\" is changed to \"_cum_  favilla,\" \"_with_ ashes\" instead of \"in ashes\"; and \"Teste Petro\" is  substituted for \"Teste David.\"      _THE TUNE._    The varieties of music set to the \"Hymn of Judgment\" in the different  sections and languages of Christendom during seven hundred years are  probably as numerous as the pictures of the Holy Family in Christian  art. It is enough to say that one of the best at hand, or, at least,  accessible, is the solemn minor melody of Dr. Dykes in William Henry  Monk's _Hymns Ancient and Modern_. It was composed about the middle of  the last century. Both the _Evangelical_ and _Methodist Hymnals_ have  Dean Stanley's translation of the hymn, the former with thirteen stanzas  (six-line) to a D minor of John Stainer, and the latter to a C major of  Timothy Matthews. The _Plymouth Hymnal_ has seventeen of the trilineal  stanzas, by an unknown translator, to Ferdinand Hiller's tune in F  minor, besides one verse to another F minor--hymn and tune both  nameless.    All the composers above named are musicians of fame. John Stainer,  organist of St. Paul's Cathedral, was a Doctor of Music and Chevalier of  the Legion of Honor, and celebrated for his works in sacred music, to  which he mainly devoted his time. He was born June 6, 1840. He died  March 31, 1901.    Rev. Timothy Richard Matthews, born at Colmworth, Eng., Nov. 20, 1826,  is a clergyman of the Church of England, incumbent of a Lancaster charge  to which he was appointed by Queen Alexandra.    Ferdinand Hiller, born 1811 at Frankfort-on-the-Main, of Hebrew  parentage, was one of Germany's most eminent musicians. For many years  he was Chapel Master at Cologne, and organized the Cologne Conservatory.  His compositions are mostly for instrumental performance, but he wrote  cantatas, motets, male choruses, and two oratorios, one on the  \"Destruction of Jerusalem.\" Died May 10, 1855.    The Very Rev. Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, Dean of Westminster, was an author  and scholar whom all sects of Christians delighted to honor. His  writings on the New Testament and his published researches in Palestine,  made him an authority in Biblical study, and his contributions to sacred  literature were looked for and welcomed as eagerly as a new hymn by  Bonar or a new poem by Tennyson. Dean Stanley was born in 1815, and died  July 18th, 1881.      THOMAS A KEMPIS.    Thomas a Kempis, sub-prior of the Convent of St. Agnes, was born at  Hamerkin, Holland, about the year 1380, and died at Zwoll, 1471. This  pious monk belonged to an order called the \"Brethren of the Common Life\"  founded by Gerard de Groote, and his fame rests entirely upon his one  book, the _Imitation of Christ_, which continues to be printed as a  religious classic, and is unsurpassed as a manual of private devotion.  His monastic life--as was true generally of the monastic life of the  middle ages--was not one of useless idleness. The Brethren taught school  and did mechanical work. Besides, before the invention of printing had  been perfected and brought into common service, the multiplication of  books was principally the work of monkish pens. Kempis spent his days  copying the Bible and good books--as well as in exercises of devotion  that promoted religious calm.    His idea of heaven, and the idea of his order, was expressed in that  clause of John's description of the City of God, Rev. 22:3, \"_and His  servants shall serve Him_.\" Above all other heavenly joys that was his  favorite thought. We can well understand that the pious quietude wrought  in his mind and manners by his habit of life made him a saint in the  eyes of the people. The frontispiece of one edition of his _Imitatio  Christi_ pictures him as being addressed before the door of a convent  by a troubled pilgrim,--        \"O where is peace?--for thou its paths hast trod,\"    --and his answer completes the couplet,--        \"In poverty, retirement, and with God.\"    Of all that is best in inward spiritual life, much can be learned from  this inspired Dutchman. He wrote no hymns, but in his old age he  composed a poem on \"Heaven's Joys,\" which is sometimes called \"Thomas a  Kempis' Hymn\":        High the angel choirs are raising        Heart and voice in harmony;      The Creator King still praising        Whom in beauty there they see.        Sweetest strains from soft harps stealing,      Trumpets' notes of triumph pealing,      Radiant wings and white stoles gleaming      Up the steps of glory streaming;      Where the heavenly bells are ringing;     \"Holy! holy! holy!\" singing        To the mighty Trinity!     \"Holy! holy! holy!\" crying,      For all earthly care and sighing        In that city cease to be!    These lines are not in the hymnals of today--and whether they ever found  their way into choral use in ancient times we are not told. Worse poetry  has been sung--and more un-hymnlike. Some future composer will make a  tune to the words of a Christian who stood almost in sight of his  hundredth year--and of the eternal home he writes about.      MARTIN LUTHER.    \"_Ein Feste Burg Ist Unser Gott._\"    Of Martin Luther Coleridge said, \"He did as much for the Reformation by  his hymns as he did by his translation of the Bible.\" The remark is so  true that it has become a commonplace.    The above line--which may be seen inscribed on Luther's tomb at  Wittenberg--is the opening sentence and key-note of the Reformer's  grandest hymn. The forty-sixth Psalm inspired it, and it is in harmony  with sublime historical periods from its very nature, boldness, and  sublimity. It was written, according to Welles, in the memorable year  when the evangelical princes delivered their protest at the Diet of  Spires, from which the word and the meaning of the word \"Protestant\" is  derived. \"Luther used often to sing it in 1530, while the Diet of  Augsburg was sitting. It soon became the favorite psalm with the people.  It was one of the watchwords of the Reformation, cheering armies to  conflict, and sustaining believers in the hours of fiery trial.\"    \"After Luther's death, Melancthon, his affectionate coadjutor, being one  day at Weimar with his banished friends, Jonas and Creuziger, heard a  little maid singing this psalm in the street, and said, 'Sing on, my  little girl, you little know whom you comfort:'\"        A mighty fortress is our God,        A bulwark never failing;      Our helper He, amid the flood        Of mortal ills prevailing.      For still our ancient foe      Doth seek to work us woe;      His craft and power are great,      And, armed with cruel hate,        On earth is not his equal.           *       *       *       *       *        The Prince of Darkness grim--      We tremble not for him:      His rage we can endure,      For lo! his doom is sure,        One little word shall fell him.        That word above all earthly powers--        No thanks to them--abideth;      The Spirit and the gifts are ours,        Through Him who with us sideth.      Let goods and kindred go,      This mortal life also;      The body they may kill,      God's truth abideth still,        His kingdom is for ever.    Martin Luther was born in Eisleben, in Saxony, Nov. 10, 1483. He was  educated at the University of Erfurth, and became an Augustinian monk  and Professor of Philosophy and Divinity in the University of  Wittenberg. In 1517 he composed and placarded his ninety-five Theses  condemning certain practices of the Romish Church and three years later  the Pope published"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18445"],[0,"Bohemians of the Latin Quarter (#11)"],[1,"that the  park keeper does not surprise them.\"    Then he leaned his forehead on his hand and plunged further into the  flowery thickets of sentiment. But at this sweet moment of his dream  Rodolphe was suddenly awakened by a park keeper, who came up and tapped  him on the shoulder.    \"It is closing time, sir,\" said he.    \"That is lucky,\" thought Rodolphe. \"If I had stayed here another five  minutes I should have had more sentiment in my breast than is to be  found on the banks of the Rhine or in Alphonse Karr's romances.\"    And he hastened from the gardens humming a sentimental ballad that was  for him the _Marseillaise_ of love.    Half an hour later, goodness knows how, he was at the Prado, seated  before a glass of punch and talking with a tall fellow celebrated on  account of his nose, which had the singular privilege of being aquiline  when seen sideways, and a snub when viewed in front. It was a nose that  was not devoid of sharpness, and had a sufficiency of gallant adventures  to be in such a case to give good advice and be useful to its friend.    \"So,\" said Alexander Schaunard, the man with the nose, \"you are in  love.\"    \"Yes, my dear fellow, it seized on me, just now, suddenly, like a bad  toothache in the heart.\"    \"Pass me the tobacco,\" said Alexander.    \"Fancy,\" continued Rodolphe, \"for the last two hours I have met nothing  but lovers, men and women in couples. I had the notion of going into the  Luxembourg Gardens, where I saw all manner of phantasmagorias, that  stirred my heart extraordinarily. Ellegies are bursting from me, I bleat  and I coo; I am undergoing a metamorphosis, and am half lamb half turtle  dove. Look at me a bit, I must have wool and feathers.\"    \"What have you been drinking?\" said Alexander impatiently, \"you are  chaffing me.\"    \"I assure you that I am quite cool,\" replied Rodolphe. \"That is to say,  no. But I will announce to you that I must embrace something. You see,  Alexander, it is not good for man to live alone, in short, you must help  me to find a companion. We will stroll through the ballroom, and the  first girl I point out to you, you must go and tell her that I love  her.\"    \"Why don't you go and tell her yourself?\" replied Alexander in his  magnificent nasal bass.    \"Eh? my dear fellow,\" said Rodolphe. \"I can assure you that I have quite  forgot how one sets about saying that sort of thing. In all my love  stories it has been my friends who have written the preface, and  sometimes even the _denouement_; I never know how to begin.\"    \"It is enough to know how to end,\" said Alexander, \"but I understand  you. I knew a girl who loved the oboe, perhaps you would suit her.\"    \"Ah!\" said Rodolphe. \"I should like her to have white gloves and blue  eyes.\"    \"The deuce, blue eyes, I won't say no--but gloves--you know that we  can't have everything at once. However, let us go into the aristocratic  regions.\"    \"There,\" said Rodolphe, as they entered the saloon favored by the  fashionables of the place, \"there is one who seems nice and quiet,\" and  he pointed out a young girl fairly well dressed who was seated in a  corner.    \"Very good,\" replied Alexander, \"keep a little in the background, I am  going to launch the fire-ship of passion for you. When it is necessary  to put in an appearance I will call you.\"    For ten minutes Alexander conversed with the girl, who from time to time  broke out in a joyous burst of laughter, and ended by casting towards  Rodolphe a smiling glance which said plainly enough, \"Come, your  advocate has won the cause.\"    \"Come,\" said Alexander, \"the victory is ours, the little one is no doubt  far from cruel, but put on an air of simplicity to begin with.\"    \"You have no need to recommend me to do that.\"    \"Then give me some tobacco,\" said Alexander, \"and go and sit down beside  her.\"    \"Good heavens,\" said the young girl when Rodolphe had taken his place by  her side, \"how funny you friend is, his voice is like a trumpet.\"    \"That is because he is a musician.\"    Two hours later Rodolphe and his companion halted in front of a house  in the Rue St. Denis.    \"It is here that I live,\" said the girl.    \"Well, my dear Louise, when and where shall I see you again?\"    \"At your place at eight o'clock tomorrow evening.\"    \"For sure?\"    \"Here is my pledge,\" replied Louise, holding up her rosy cheek to  Rodolphe's, who eagerly tasted this ripe fruit of youth and health.    Rodolphe went home perfectly intoxicated.    \"Ah!\" said he, striding up and down his room, \"it can't go off like  that, I must write some verses.\"    The next morning his porter found in his room some thirty sheets of  paper, at the top of which stretched in solitary majesty of line--        \"Ah; love, oh! love, fair prince of youth.\"    That morning, contrary to his habits, Rodolphe had risen very early, and  although he had slept very little, he got up at once.    \"Ah!\" he exclaimed, \"today is the great day. But then twelve hours to  wait. How shall I fill up these twelve eternities?\"    And as his glance fell on his desk he seemed to see his pen wriggle as  though intending to say to him \"Work.\"    \"Ah! yes, work indeed! A fig for prose. I won't stop here, it reeks of  ink.\"    He went off and settled himself in a cafe where he was sure not to meet  any friends.    \"They would see that I am in love,\" he thought, \"and shape my ideal for  me in advance.\"    After a very brief repast he was off to the railway station, and got  into a train. Half an hour later he was in the woods of Ville d'Avray.    Rodolphe strolled about all day, let loose amongst rejuvenated nature,  and only returned to Paris at nightfall.    After having put the temple which was to receive his idol in nature,  Rodolphe arrayed himself for the occasion, greatly regretting not being  able to dress in white.    From seven to eight o'clock he was a prey to the sharp fever of  expectation. A slow torture, that recalled to him the old days and the  old loves which had sweetened them. Then, according to habit, he already  began to dream of an exalted passion, a love affair in ten volumes, a  genuine lyric with moonlight, setting suns, meetings beneath the  willows, jealousies, sighs and all the rest. He was like this every time  chance brought a woman to his door, and not one had left him without  bearing away any aureola about her head and a necklace of tears about  her neck.    \"They would prefer new boots or a bonnet,\" his friend remarked to him.    But Rodolphe persisted, and up to this time the numerous blunders he had  made had not sufficed to cure him. He was always awaiting a woman who  would consent to pose as an idol, an angel in a velvet gown, to whom he  could at his leisure address sonnets written on willow leaves.    At length Rodolphe heard the \"holy hour\" strike, and as the last stroke  sounded he fancied he saw the Cupid and Psyche surmounting his clock  entwine their alabaster arms about one another. At the same moment two  timid taps were given at the door.    Rodolphe went and opened it. It was Louise.    \"You see I have kept my word,\" said she.    Rodolphe drew the curtain and lit a fresh candle.    During this operation the girl had removed her bonnet and shawl, which  she went and placed on the bed. The dazzling whiteness of the sheets  caused her to smile, and almost to blush.    Louise was rather pleasing than pretty; her fresh colored face presented  an attractive blending of simplicity and archness. It was something like  an outline of Greuze touched up by Gavarni. All her youthful attractions  were cleverly set off by a toilette which, although very simple,  attested in her that innate science of coquetry which all women possess  from their first swaddling clothes to their bridal robe. Louise  appeared besides to have made an especial study of the theory of  attitudes, and assumed before Rodolphe, who examined her with the  artistic eye, a number of seductive poses. Her neatly shod feet were of  satisfactory smallness, even for a romantic lover smitten by Andalusian  or Chinese miniatures. As to her hands, their softness attested  idleness. In fact, for six months past she had no longer any reason to  fear needle pricks. In short, Louise was one of those fickle birds of  passage who from fancy, and often from necessity, make for a day, or  rather a night, their nest in the garrets of the students' quarter, and  remain there willingly for a few days, if one knows how to retain them  by a whim or by some ribbons.    After having chatted for an hour with Louise, Rodolphe showed her, as an  example, the group of Cupid and Psyche.    \"Isn't it Paul and Virginia?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Rodolphe, who did not want to vex her at the outset by  contradicting her.    \"They are very well done,\" said Louise.    \"Alas!\" thought Rodolphe, gazing at her, \"the poor child is not up to  much as regards literature. I am sure that her only orthography is that  of the heart. I must buy her a dictionary.\"    However, as Louise complained of her boots incommoding her, he  obligingly helped her to unlace them.    All at once the light went out.    \"Hallo!\" exclaimed Rodolphe, \"who has blown the candle out?\"    A joyful burst of laughter replied to him.    A few days later Rodolphe met one of his friends in the street.    \"What are you up to?\" said the latter. \"One no longer sees anything of  you.\"    \"I am studying the poetry of intimacy,\" replied Rodolphe.    The poor fellow spoke the truth. He sought from Louise more than the  poor girl could give him. An oaten pipe, she had not the strains of a  lyre. She spoke to, so to say, the jargon of love, and Rodolphe  insisted upon speaking the classic language. Thus they scarcely  understood each other.    A week later, at the same ball at which she had found Rodolphe, Louise  met a fair young fellow, who danced with her several times, and at the  close of the entertainment took her home with him.    He was a second year's student. He spoke the "]]]
