In ordinary cases it might be necessary to prove  the party's claim to respectability, but, in this instance, I feel  myself relieved from any such obligation, knowing, as I do, that there  is no one in this court, no one in these realms--I might almost add,  no one in this world--to whom the fame of my most respectable, my most  distinguished, and much injured client is unknown. Not to know JORROCKS  is indeed to argue oneself unknown.\"    \"This is a case of no ordinary interest, and I approach it with a deep  sense of its importance, conscious of my inability to do justice to the  subject, and lamenting that it has not been entrusted to abler hands.  It is a case involving the commercial and the sporting character of  a gentleman against whom the breath of calumny has never yet been  drawn--of a gentleman who in all the relations of life, whether as a  husband, a fox-hunter, a shooter, or a grocer, has invariably preserved  that character and reputation, so valuable in commercial life, so  necessary in the sporting world, and so indispensable to a man moving in  general society. Were I to look round London town in search of a bright  specimen of a man combining the upright, sterling integrity of the  honourable British merchant of former days with the ardour of the  English fox-hunter of modern times, I would select my most respectable  client, Mr. Jorrocks. He is a man for youth to imitate and revere!  Conceive, then, the horror of a man of his delicate sensibility--of his  nervous dread of depreciation--being compelled to appear here this  day to vindicate his character, nay more, his honour, from one of the  foulest attempts at conspiracy that was ever directed against any  individual. I say that a grosser attack was never made upon the  character of any grocer, and I look confidently to the reversion of this  unjust, unprecedented conviction, and to the triumphant victory of my  most respectable and public-spirited client. It is not for the sake of  the few paltry shillings that he appeals to this court--it is not for  the sake of calling in question the power of the constituted authorities  of this county--but it is for the vindication and preservation of a  character dear to all men, but doubly dear to a grocer, and which once  lost can never be regained. Look, I say, upon my client as he sits below  the witness-box, and say, if in that countenance there appears any  indication of a lawless or rebellious spirit; look, I say, if the milk  of human kindness is not strikingly portrayed in every feature, and  truly may I exclaim in the words of the poet:\"      If to his share some trifling errors fall,    Look in his face, and you'll forget them all.'    \"I regret to be compelled to trespass upon the valuable time of the  court; but, sir, this appeal is based on a trespass, and one good  trespass deserves another.\"    The learned gentleman then proceeded to detail the proceedings of the  day's shooting, and afterwards to analyse the enactments of the new Game  Bill, which he denounced as arbitrary, oppressive, and ridiculous, and  concluded a long and energetic speech, by calling upon the court to  reverse the decision of the magistrate, and not support the preposterous  position of fining a man for a trespass committed by his toe.    After a few minutes had elapsed, Mr. Sergeant Bumptious, a stiff,  bull-headed little man, desperately pitted with the smallpox, rose to  reply, and looking round the court, thus commenced:    \"Five-and-thirty years have I passed in courts of justice, but never,  during a long and extensive practice, have I witnessed so gross a  perversion of that sublimest gift, called eloquence, as within the last  hour\"--here he banged his brief against the table, and looked at Mr.  Smirk, who smiled.--\"I lament, sir, that it has not been employed in a  better cause--(bang again--and another look). My learned friend has,  indeed, laboured to make the worse appear the better cause--to convert  into a trifle one of the most outrageous acts that ever disgraced a  human being or a civilised country. Well did he describe the importance  of this case!--important as regards his client's character--important  as regards this great and populous county--important as regards those  social ties by which society is held together--important as regards  a legislative enactment, and important as regards the well-being and  prosperity of the whole nation--(bang, bang, bang). I admire the  bombastic eloquence with which my learned friend introduced his  most distinguished client--his most delicate minded--sensitive  client!--Truly, to hear him speaking I should have thought he had been  describing a lovely, blushing young lady, but when he comes to exhibit  his paragon of perfection, and points out that great, red-faced, coarse,  vulgar-looking, lubberly lump of humanity--(here Bumptious looked at  Jorrocks as he would eat him)--sitting below the witness-box, and  seeks to enlist the sympathies of your worships on the Bench--of you,  gentlemen, the high-minded, shrewd, penetrating judges of this important  cause--(and Bumptious smiled and bowed along the Bench upon all whose  eyes he could catch)--on behalf of such a monster of iniquity, it  does make one blush for the degradation of the British  Bar--(bang--bang--bang--Jorrocks here looked unutterable things). Does  my learned friend think by displaying his hero as a fox-hunter,  and extolling his prowess in the field, to gain over the sporting  magistrates on the Bench? He knows little of the upright integrity--the  uncompromising honesty--the undeviating, inflexible impartiality that  pervades the breast of every member of this tribunal, if he thinks  for the sake of gain, fear, favour, hope, or reward, to influence  the opinion, much less turn the judgment, of any one of them.\" (Here  Bumptious bowed very low to them all and laid his hand upon his heart.  Tomkins nodded approbation.) \"Far, far be it from me to dwell with  unbecoming asperity on the conduct of anyone--we are all mortals--and  alike liable to err; but when I see a man who has been guilty of an act  which has brought him all but within the verge of the prisoners' dock; I  say, when I see a man who has been guilty of such an outrage on society  as this ruffian Jorrocks, come forward with the daring effrontery  that he has this day done, and claim redress where he himself is the  offender, it does create a feeling in my mind divided between disgust  and amazement\"--(bang).    Here Jorrock's cauldron boiled over, and rising from his seat with an  outstretched shoulder-of-mutton fist, he bawled out, \"D--n you, sir,  what do you mean?\"    The court was thrown into amazement, and even Bumptious quailed before  the fist of the mighty Jorrocks. \"I claim the protection of the court,\"  he exclaimed. Mr. Tomkins interposed, and said he should certainly order  Mr. Jorrocks into custody if he repeated his conduct, adding that it was  \"most disrespectful to the justices of our lord the king.\"    Bumptious paused a little to gather breath and a fresh volume of venom  wherewith to annihilate Jorrocks, and catching his eye, he transfixed  him like a rattlesnake, and again resumed.    \"How stands the case?\" said he. \"This cockney grocer--for after all  he is nothing else--who I dare say scarcely knows a hawk from a  hand-saw--leaves his figs and raisins, and sets out on a marauding  excursion into the county of Surrey, and regardless of property--of  boundaries--of laws--of liberties--of life itself--strides over every  man's land, letting drive at whatever comes in his way! The hare he shot  on this occasion was a pet hare!--For three successive summers had  Miss Cheatum watched and fed it with all the interest and anxiety of a  parent. I leave it to you, gentlemen, who have daughters of your own,  with pets also, to picture to yourselves the agony of her mind in  finding that her favourite had found its way down the throat of that  great guzzling, gormandising, cockney cormorant; and then, forsooth,  because he is fined for the outrageous trespass, he comes here as the  injured party, and instructs his counsel to indulge in Billingsgate  abuse that would disgrace the mouth of an Old Bailey practitioner! I  regret that instead of the insignificant fine imposed upon him, the law  did not empower the worthy magistrate to send him to the treadmill,  there to recreate himself for six or eight months, as a warning to the  whole fraternity of lawless vagabonds.\" Here he nodded his head at  Jorrocks as much as to say, \"I'll trounce you, my boy!\" He then produced  maps and plans of the different estates, and a model of the shed, to  show how it had all happened, and after going through the case in such a  strain as would induce one to believe it was a trial for murder or high  treason, concluded as follows:    \"The eyes of England are upon us--reverse this conviction, and you let  loose a rebel band upon the country, ripe for treason, stratagem, or  spoil--you overturn the finest order of society in the world; henceforth  no man's property will be safe, the laws will be disregarded, and even  the upright, talented, and independent magistracy of England brought  into contempt. But I feel convinced that your decision will be  far otherwise--that by it you will teach these  hot-headed--rebellious--radical grocers that they cannot offend with  impunity, and show them that there is a law which reaches even the  lowest and meanest "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15399"],[0,"The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, Or Gustavus Vassa, The (#11)"],[1,"it remained silent.    My master lodged at the house of a gentleman in Falmouth, who had a  fine little daughter about six or seven years of age, and she grew  prodigiously fond of me; insomuch that we used to eat together, and  had servants to wait on us. I was so much caressed by this family that  it often reminded me of the treatment I had received from my little  noble African master. After I had been here a few days, I was sent on  board of the ship; but the child cried so much after me that nothing  could pacify her till I was sent for again. It is ludicrous enough,  that I began to fear I should be betrothed to this young lady; and  when my master asked me if I would stay there with her behind him, as  he was going away with the ship, which had taken in the tobacco again,  I cried immediately, and said I would not leave her. At last, by  stealth, one night I was sent on board the ship again; and in a little  time we sailed for Guernsey, where she was in part owned by a  merchant, one Nicholas Doberry. As I was now amongst a people who had  not their faces scarred, like some of the African nations where I had  been, I was very glad I did not let them ornament me in that manner  when I was with them. When we arrived at Guernsey, my master placed me  to board and lodge with one of his mates, who had a wife and family  there; and some months afterwards he went to England, and left me in  care of this mate, together with my friend Dick: This mate had a  little daughter, aged about five or six years, with whom I used to be  much delighted. I had often observed that when her mother washed her  face it looked very rosy; but when she washed mine it did not look so:  I therefore tried oftentimes myself if I could not by washing make my  face of the same colour as my little play-mate (Mary), but it was all  in vain; and I now began to be mortified at the difference in our  complexions. This woman behaved to me with great kindness and  attention; and taught me every thing in the same manner as she did her  own child, and indeed in every respect treated me as such. I remained  here till the summer of the year 1757; when my master, being appointed  first lieutenant of his majesty's ship the Roebuck, sent for Dick and  me, and his old mate: on this we all left Guernsey, and set out for  England in a sloop bound for London. As we were coming up towards the  Nore, where the Roebuck lay, a man of war's boat came alongside to  press our people; on which each man ran to hide himself. I was very  much frightened at this, though I did not know what it meant, or what  to think or do. However I went and hid myself also under a hencoop.  Immediately afterwards the press-gang came on board with their swords  drawn, and searched all about, pulled the people out by force, and put  them into the boat. At last I was found out also: the man that found  me held me up by the heels while they all made their sport of me, I  roaring and crying out all the time most lustily: but at last the  mate, who was my conductor, seeing this, came to my assistance, and  did all he could to pacify me; but all to very little purpose, till I  had seen the boat go off. Soon afterwards we came to the Nore, where  the Roebuck lay; and, to our great joy, my master came on board to us,  and brought us to the ship. When I went on board this large ship, I  was amazed indeed to see the quantity of men and the guns. However my  surprise began to diminish as my knowledge increased; and I ceased to  feel those apprehensions and alarms which had taken such strong  possession of me when I first came among the Europeans, and for some  time after. I began now to pass to an opposite extreme; I was so far  from being afraid of any thing new which I saw, that, after I had been  some time in this ship, I even began to long for a battle. My griefs  too, which in young minds are not perpetual, were now wearing away;  and I soon enjoyed myself pretty well, and felt tolerably easy in my  present situation. There was a number of boys on board, which still  made it more agreeable; for we were always together, and a great part  of our time was spent in play. I remained in this ship a considerable  time, during which we made several cruises, and visited a variety of  places: among others we were twice in Holland, and brought over  several persons of distinction from it, whose names I do not now  remember. On the passage, one day, for the diversion of those  gentlemen, all the boys were called on the quarter-deck, and were  paired proportionably, and then made to fight; after which the  gentleman gave the combatants from five to nine shillings each. This  was the first time I ever fought with a white boy; and I never knew  what it was to have a bloody nose before. This made me fight most  desperately; I suppose considerably more than an hour: and at last,  both of us being weary, we were parted. I had a great deal of this  kind of sport afterwards, in which the captain and the ship's company  used very much to encourage me. Sometime afterwards the ship went to  Leith in Scotland, and from thence to the Orkneys, where I was  surprised in seeing scarcely any night: and from thence we sailed with  a great fleet, full of soldiers, for England. All this time we had  never come to an engagement, though we were frequently cruising off  the coast of France: during which we chased many vessels, and took in  all seventeen prizes. I had been learning many of the manoeuvres of  the ship during our cruise; and I was several times made to fire the  guns. One evening, off Havre de Grace, just as it was growing dark, we  were standing off shore, and met with a fine large French-built  frigate. We got all things immediately ready for fighting; and I now  expected I should be gratified in seeing an engagement, which I had so  long wished for in vain. But the very moment the word of command was  given to fire we heard those on board the other ship cry 'Haul down  the jib;' and in that instant she hoisted English colours. There was  instantly with us an amazing cry of--Avast! or stop firing; and I  think one or two guns had been let off, but happily they did no  mischief. We had hailed them several times; but they not hearing, we  received no answer, which was the cause of our firing. The boat was  then sent on board of her, and she proved to be the Ambuscade man of  war, to my no small disappointment. We returned to Portsmouth, without  having been in any action, just at the trial of Admiral Byng (whom I  saw several times during it): and my master having left the ship, and  gone to London for promotion, Dick and I were put on board the Savage  sloop of war, and we went in her to assist in bringing off the St.  George man of war, that had ran ashore somewhere on the coast. After  staying a few weeks on board the Savage, Dick and I were sent on shore  at Deal, where we remained some short time, till my master sent for us  to London, the place I had long desired exceedingly to see. We  therefore both with great pleasure got into a waggon, and came to  London, where we were received by a Mr. Guerin, a relation of my  master. This gentleman had two sisters, very amiable ladies, who took  much notice and great care of me. Though I had desired so much to see  London, when I arrived in it I was unfortunately unable to gratify my  curiosity; for I had at this time the chilblains to such a degree that  I could not stand for several months, and I was obliged to be sent to  St. George's Hospital. There I grew so ill, that the doctors wanted to  cut my left leg off at different times, apprehending a mortification;  but I always said I would rather die than suffer it; and happily (I  thank God) I recovered without the operation. After being there  several weeks, and just as I had recovered, the small-pox broke out on  me, so that I was again confined; and I thought myself now  particularly unfortunate. However I soon recovered again; and by this  time my master having been promoted to be first lieutenant of the  Preston man of war of fifty guns, then new at Deptford, Dick and I  were sent on board her, and soon after we went to Holland to bring  over the late Duke of ---- to England.--While I was in this ship an  incident happened, which, though trifling, I beg leave to relate, as I  could not help taking particular notice of it, and considering it then  as a judgment of God. One morning a young man was looking up to the  fore-top, and in a wicked tone, common on shipboard, d----d his eyes  about something. Just at the moment some small particles of dirt fell  into his left eye, and by the evening it was very much inflamed. The  next day it grew worse; and within six or seven days he lost it. From  this ship my master was appointed a lieutenant on board the Royal  George. When he was going he wished me to stay on board the Preston,  to learn the French horn; but the ship being ordered for Turkey I  could not think of leaving my master, to whom I was very warmly  attached; and I told him if he left me behind it would break my heart.  This prevailed on him to take me with him; but he left Dick on board  the Preston, whom I embraced at parting for the last time. The Royal  George was the largest ship I had ever seen; so that when I came on  board of her I was surprised at the number of people, men, women, and  children, of every denomination; and the largeness of the guns, many  of them also of brass, which I had never seen before. Here were also  shops or stalls of every kind of goods, and people crying their  different commodities about the ship as in a town. To me it appeared a  little world, into which I was again cast without a friend, for I had  no longer my dear companion Dick. We did not stay long here. My master  was not many weeks on board before he got an appointment to be sixth  lieutenant of the Namur, which was then at Spithead, fitting up for  Vice-admiral Boscawen, who was going with a large"]]]
