So Brennus told off the most surefooted mountaineers he  could find, and at night, two and two, they crept up the crag, so  silently that no alarm was given, till just as they came to the top,  some geese that were kept as sacred to Juno, and for that reason had  been spared in spite of the scarcity, began to scream and cackle, and  thus brought to the spot a brave officer called Marcus Manlius, who  found two Gauls in the act of setting foot on the level ground on the  top. With a sweep of his sword he struck off the hand of one, and with  his buckler smote the other on the head, tumbling them both headlong  down, knocking down their fellows in their flight, and the Capitol was  saved.    By way of reward every Roman soldier brought Manlius a few grains of the  corn he received from the common stock and a few drops of wine, while  the tribune who was on guard that night was thrown from the rock.    Foiled thus, and with great numbers of his men dying from the fever that  always prevailed in Rome in summer, Brennus thought of retreating, and  offered to leave Rome if the garrison in the Capitol would pay him a  thousand pounds' weight of gold. There was treasure enough in the  temples to do this, and as they could not tell what Camillus was about,  nor if Pontius had reached him safely, and they were on the point of  being starved, they consented. The gold was brought to the place  appointed by the Gauls, and when the weights proved not to be equal to  the amount that the Romans had with them, Brennus resolved to have all,  put his sword into the other scale, saying, \"Vae victis\"--\"Woe to the  conquered.\" But at that moment there was a noise outside--Camillus was  come. The Gauls were cut down and slain among the ruins, those who fled  were killed by the people in the country as they wandered in the fields,  and not one returned to tell the tale. So the ransom of the Capitol was  rescued, and was laid up by Camillus in the vaults as a reserve for  future danger.    This was the Roman story, but their best historians say that it is made  better for Rome than is quite the truth, for that the Capitol was really  conquered, and the Gauls helped themselves to whatever they chose and  went off with it, though sickness and weariness made them afterwards  disperse, so that they were mostly cut off by the country people.    Every old record had been lost and destroyed, so that, before this,  Roman history can only be hearsay, derived from what the survivors  recollected; and the whole of the buildings, temples, senate-house, and  dwellings lay in ruins. Some of the citizens wished to change the site  of the city to Veii; but Camillus, who was Dictator, was resolved to  hold fast by the hearths of their fathers, and while the debate was  going on in the ruins of the senate-house a troop of soldiers were  marching in, and the centurion was heard calling out, \"Plant your ensign  here; this is a good place to stay in.\" \"A happy omen,\" cried one of the  senators; \"I adore the gods who gave it.\" So it was settled to rebuild  the city, and in digging among the ruins there were found the golden  rod of Romulus, the brazen tables on which the Laws of the Twelve Tables  were engraved, and other brasses with records of treaties with other  nations. Fabius was accused of having done all the harm by having broken  the law of nations, but he was spared at the entreaty of his friends.  Manlius was surnamed Capitolinus, and had a house granted him on the  Capitol; and Camillus when he laid down his dictatorship, was saluted as  like Romulus--another founder of Rome.    The new buildings were larger and more ornamented than the old ones; but  the lines of the old underground drains, built in the mighty Etruscan  fashion by the elder Tarquin as it was said, were not followed, and this  tended to render Rome more unhealthy, so that few of her richer citizens  lived there in summer or autumn, but went out to country houses on the  hills.    [Illustration: ENTRY OF THE FORUM ROMANUM BY THE VIA SACRA]          CHAPTER XIII.    THE PLEBEIAN CONSULATE.    B.C. 367.      All the old enemies of Rome attacked her again when she was weak and  rising out of her ruins, but Camillus had wisely persuaded the Romans to  add the people of Veii, Capena, and Falerii to the number of their  citizens, making four more tribes; and this addition to their numbers  helped them beat off their foes.    But this enlarged the number of the plebeians, and enabled them to make  their claims more heard. Moreover, the old quarrel between poor and  rich, debtor and creditor, broke out again. Those who had saved their  treasure in the time of the sack had made loans to those who had lost to  enable them to build their houses and stock their farms again, and  after a time they called loudly for payment, and when it was not  forthcoming had the debtors seized to be sold as slaves. Camillus  himself was one of the hardest creditors of all, and the barracks where  slaves were placed to be sold were full of citizens.    [Illustration: COSTUMES.]    Marcus Manlius Capitolinus was full of pity, and raised money to redeem  four hundred of them, trying with all his might to get the law changed  and to save the rest; but the rich men and the patricians thought he  acted only out of jealousy of Camillus, and to get up a party for  himself. They said he was raising a sedition, and Publius Cornelius  Cossus was named Dictator to put it down. Manlius was seized and put  into chains, but released again. At last the rich men bought over two of  the tribunes to accuse him of wanting to make himself a king, and this  hated title turned all the people against their friend, so that the  general cry sentenced him to be cast down from the top of the Tarpeian  rock; his house on the Capitol was overthrown, and his family declared  that no son of their house should ever again bear the name of Manlius.    [Illustration: COSTUME.]    Yet the plebeians were making their way, and at last succeeded in  gaining the plebeian magistracies and equal honors with the patricians.  A curious story is told of the cause of the last effort which gained the  day. A patrician named Fabius Ambustus had two daughters, one of whom he  gave in marriage to Servius Sulpicius, a patrician and military tribune,  the other to Licinius Stolo. One day, when Stolo's wife was visiting her  sister, there was a great noise and thundering at the gates which  frightened her, until the other Fabii said it was only her husband  coming home from the Forum attended by his lictors and clients, laughing  at her ignorance and alarm, until a whole troop of the clients came in  to pay their court to the tribune's wife.    Stolo's wife went home angry and vexed, and reproached her husband and  her father for not having made her equal with her sister, and so wrought  on them that they put themselves at the head of the movement in favor of  the plebeians; and Licinius and another young plebeian named Lucius  Sextius, being elected year after year tribunes of the people, went on  every time saying _Veto_ to whatever was proposed by anybody, and giving  out that they should go on doing so till three measures were  carried--viz., that interest on debt should not be demanded; that no  citizen should possess more than three hundred and twenty acres of the  public land, or feed more than a certain quantity of cattle on the  public pastures; and, lastly, that one of the two consuls should always  be a plebeian.    They went on for eight years, always elected by the people and always  stopping everything. At last there was another inroad of the Gauls  expected, and Camillus, though eighty years old, was for the fifth time  chosen Dictator, and gained a great victory upon the banks of the Anio.  The Senate begged him to continue Dictator till he could set their  affairs to rights, and he vowed to build a temple to Concord if he could  succeed. He saw indeed that it was time to yield, and persuaded the  Senate to think so; so that at last, in the year 367, Sextius was  elected consul, together with a patrician, AEmilius. Even then the Senate  would not receive Sextius till he was introduced by Camillus. From this  time the patricians and plebeians were on an equal footing as far as  regarded the magistracies, but the priesthood could belong only to the  patricians. Camillus lived to a great age, and was honored as having  three times saved his country. He died at last of a terrible pestilence  which raged in Rome in the year 365.    The priests recommended that they should invite the players from Etruria  to perform a drama in honor of the feats of the gods, and this was the  beginning of play-acting in Rome.    Not long after there yawned a terrible chasm in the Forum, most likely  from an earthquake, but nothing seemed to fill it up, and the priests  and augurs consulted their oracles about it. These made answer that it  would only close on receiving of what was most precious. Gold and  jewels were thrown in, but it still seemed bottomless, and at last the  augurs declared that it was courage that was the most precious thing in  Rome. Thereupon a patrician youth named Marcus Curtius decked himself in  his choicest robes, put on his armor, took his shield, sword, and spear,  mounted his horse, and leapt headlong into the gulf, thus giving it the  most precious of all things, courage and self-devotion. After this one  story says it closed of itself, another that it became easy to fill it  up with earth.    The Romans thought that such a sacrifice must please the gods and bring  them success in their battles; but in the war with the Hernici that was  now being waged the plebeian consul was killed, and no doubt there was  much difficulty in getting the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16672"],[0,"The Last Journals of David Livingstone, in Central Africa, from 1865 to His (#11)"],[1,"up and said he had been sent by  the sepoys, who declared they would come no further. It was with the  utmost difficulty they had come so far, or that the havildar had  forced them on, they would not obey him--would not get up in the  mornings to march; lay in the paths, and gave their pouches and  muskets to the natives to carry: they make themselves utterly useless.  The black buffalo is dead; one camel ditto, and one mule left behind  ill. Were I not aware of the existence of the tsetse, I should say  they died from sheer bad treatment and hard work.    I sent a note to be read to the sepoys stating that I had seen their  disobedience, unwillingness, and skulking, and as soon as I received  the havildar's formal evidence, I would send them back. I regretted  parting with the havildar only.    A leopard came a little after dark while the moon was shining, and  took away a little dog from among us; it is said to have taken off a  person a few days ago.    _22nd May, 1866._--The men returned with but little food in return for  much cloth. Matumora is very friendly, but he has nothing to give save  a little green sorghum, and that he brings daily.    A south wind blows strongly every afternoon. The rains ceased about  the middle of May, and the temperature is lowered. A few heavy night  showers closed the rainy season.    _23rd--24th May, 1866._--I took some Lunar observations.    _25th May, 1866._--Matumora is not Ndonde. A chief to the south-west  of this owns that name and belongs to the Matumbwe tribe.    _26th May, 1866._--I sent Musa westwards to buy food, and he returned  on the evening of 27th without success; he found an Arab slave-dealer  waiting in the path, who had bought up all the provisions. About 11  P.M. we saw two men pass our door with two women in a chain; one man  carried fire in front, the one behind, a musket. Matumora admits that  his people sell each other.    _27th May, 1866._--The havildar and Abraham came up. Havildar says  that all I said in my note was true, and when it was read to the  sepoys they bewailed their folly, he adds that if they were all sent  away disgraced, no one would be to blame but themselves. He brought  them to Hassane's, but they were useless, though they begged to be  kept on: I may give them another trial, but at present they are a sad  incumbrance. South-west of this the Manganja begin; but if one went by  them, there is a space beyond in the south-west without people.    The country due west of this is described by all to be so mountainous  and beset by Mazitu, that there is no possibility of passing that way.  I must therefore make my way to the middle of the Lake, cross over,  and then take up my line of 1863.    _2nd June, 1866._--The men sent to the Matambwe south-east of this  returned with a good supply of grain. The sepoys won't come; they say  they cannot,--a mere excuse, v because they tried to prevail on the  Nassick boys to go slowly like them, and wear my patience out. They  killed one camel with the butt ends of their muskets, beating it till  it died. I thought of going down disarming them all, and taking five  or six of the willing ones, but it is more trouble than profit, so I  propose to start westwards on Monday the 4th, or Tuesday the 5th. My  sepoys offered Ali eight rupees to take them to the coast, thus it  has been a regularly organized conspiracy.    From the appearance of the cow-buffalo, I fear the tsetse is its chief  enemy, but there is a place like a bayonet wound on its shoulder, and  many of the wounds or bruises on the camels were so probed that I  suspect the sepoys.    Many things African are possessed of as great vitality in their line  as the African people. The white ant was imported accidentally into  St. Helena from the coast of Guinea, and has committed such ravages in  the town of St. James, that numerous people have been ruined, and the  governor calls out for aid against them. In other so-called new  countries a wave of English weeds follows the tide of English  emigration, and so with insects; the European house-fly chases away  the blue-bottle fly in New Zealand. Settlers have carried the  house-fly in bottles and boxes for their new locations, but what  European insect will follow us and extirpate the tsetse? The Arabs  have given the Makonde bugs, but we have the house-fly wherever we go,  the blue-bottle and another like the house-fly, but with a sharp  proboscis; and several enormous gad-flies. Here there is so much room  for everything. In New Zealand the Norwegian rat is driven off by even  the European mouse; not to mention the Hanoverian rat of Waterton,  which is lord of the land. The Maori say that \"as the white man's rat  has driven away the native rat, so the European fly drives away our  own; and as the clover kills our fern, so will the Maori disappear  before the white man himself.\" The hog placed ashore by Captain Cook  has now overrun one side of the island, and is such a nuisance that a  large farmer of 100,000 acres has given sixpence per head for the  destruction of some 20,000, and without any sensible diminution; this  would be no benefit here, for the wild hogs abound and do much damage,  besides affording food for the tsetse: the brutes follow the ewes with  young, and devour the poor lambs as soon as they make their  appearance.    _3rd June, 1866._--The cow-buffalo fell down foaming at the mouth, and  expired. The meat looks fat and nice, and is relished by the people, a  little glariness seemed to be present on the foreleg, and I sometimes  think that, notwithstanding the dissimilarity of the symptoms observed  in the camels and buffaloes now, and those we saw in oxen and horses,  the evil may be the tsetse, after all, but they have been badly used,  without a doubt. The calf has a cut half an inch deep, the camels have  had large ulcers, and at last a peculiar smell, which portends death.  I feel perplexed, and not at all certain as to the real causes of  death.    I asked Matumora if the Matambwe believed in God, he replied, that he  did not know Him, and I was not to ask the people among whom I was  going if they prayed to Him, because they would imagine that I wished  them to be killed. I told him that we loved to speak about Him, &c. He  said, when they prayed they offered a little meal and then prayed, but  did not know much about Him.    They have all great reverence for the Deity, and the deliberate way in  which they say \"We don't know Him\" is to prevent speaking  irreverently, as that may injure the country. The name is \"Mulungu\":  Makochera afterwards said, that \"He was not good, because He killed so  many people.\"    _4th June, 1866._--Left Ngomano. I was obliged to tell the Nassick  boys that they must either work or return, it was absurd to have them  eating up our goods, and not even carrying their own things, and I  would submit to it no more: five of them carry bales, and two the  luggage of the rest. Abraham and Richard are behind. I gave them bales  to carry, and promised them ten rupees per month, to begin on this  date. Abraham has worked hard all along, and his pay may be due from  7th April, the day we started from Kindany.    _5th June, 1866._--We slept at a village called Lamba, on the banks of  the Rovuma, near a brawling torrent of 150 yards, or 200 perhaps, with  many islands and rocks in it. The country is covered with open forest,  with patches of cultivation everywhere, but all dried up at present  and withered, partly from drought and partly from the cold of winter.  We passed a village with good ripe sorghum cut down, and the heads or  ears all laid neatly in a row, this is to get it dried in the sun, and  not shaken out by the wind, by waving to and fro; besides it is also  more easily watched from being plundered by birds. The sorghum  occasionally does not yield seed, and is then the _Sorghum  saccharatum_, for the stalk contains abundance of sugar, and is much  relished by the natives. Now that so much has failed to yield seed,  being indeed just in flower, the stalks are chewed as if sugar-cane,  and the people are fat thereon; but the hungry time is in store when  these stalles are all done. They make the best provision in their  power against famine by planting beans and maize in moist spots. The  common native pumpkin forms a bastard sort in the same way, but that  is considered very inferior.    _6th June, 1866._--Great hills of granite are occasionally in sight  towards the north, but the trees, though scraggy, close in the view.  We left a village, called Mekosi, and goon came to a slaving party by  a sand stream. They said that they had bought two slaves, but they had  run away from them, and asked us to remain with them; more civil than  inviting. We came on to Makochera, the principal headman in this  quarter, and found him a merry laughing mortal, without any good looks  to recommend his genial smile,--low forehead, covered with deep  wrinkles; flat nose, somewhat of the Assyrian shape; a big mouth and  lean body. He complained of the Machinga (a Waiyau tribe north of him  and the Rovuma) stealing his people. Lat. of village, 11 deg. 22' 49\" S.  The river being about 2' north, still shows that it makes a trend to  the north after we pass Ngomano. Makochera has been an elephant  hunter. Few acknowledge as a reason for slaving that sowing and  spinning cotton for clothing is painful. I waited some days for the  Nassick boys, who are behind, though we could not buy any food except  at enormous prices and long distances off.    _7th June, 1866._--The havildar and two sepoys came up with Abraham,  but Richard, a Nassick boy, is still behind from weakness. I sent  three off to help him with the only cordials we could muster. The  sepoys sometimes profess inability to come on, but it is unwillingness  to encounter hardship: I must move on whether they come or not, for we  cannot obtain food here. I sent the sepoys some cloth, and on the 8th"]]]
