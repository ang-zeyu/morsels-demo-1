Their internal structure is very nearly similar;  their food is the same, consisting of decomposing vegetable matter;  their habits are identical: they live underground in tunnels which  are frequently renewed; they make a rough egg-shaped cocoon of earthy  materials. Environment, diet, industry and internal structure are all  similar; and yet one of these three larvae, the Cetonia's, reveals a  most singular dissimilarity from its fellow-trenchermen: alone among  the Scarabaeidae and, more than that, alone in all the immense order of  insects, it walks upon its back.    If the differences were a matter of a few petty structural details,  falling within the finical department of the classifier, we might pass  them over without hesitation; but a creature that turns itself upside  down in order to walk with its belly in the air and never adopts any  other method of locomotion, though it possesses legs and good legs at  that, assuredly deserves examination. How did the animal acquire its  fantastic mode of progress and why does it think fit to walk in a  fashion the exact contrary of that adopted by other beasts?    To these questions the science now in fashion always has a reply  ready: adaptation to environment. The Cetonia-larva lives in crumbling  galleries which it bores in the depths of the soil. Like the sweep who  obtains a purchase with his back, loins and knees to hoist himself up  the narrow passage of a chimney, it gathers itself up, applies the tip  of its belly to one wall of its gallery and its sturdy back to another;  and the combined effort of these two levers results in moving it  forward. The legs, which are used very little, indeed hardly at all,  waste away and tend to disappear, as does any organ which is left  unemployed; the back, on the other hand, the principal motive agent,  grows stronger, is furrowed with powerful folds and bristles with  grappling-hooks or hairs; and gradually, by adaptation to its  environment, the creature loses the art of walking, which it does not  practise, and replaces it by that of crawling on its back, a form of  progress better suited to underground corridors.    So far so good. But now tell me, if you please, why the larvae of the  Oryctes and the Scarabaeus, living in vegetable mould, the larva of the  Anoxia, dwelling in the sand, and the larva of the Cockchafer in our  cultivated fields have not also acquired the faculty of walking on their  backs? In their galleries they follow the chimney-sweep's methods quite  as cleverly as the Cetonia-grub; to move forward they make valiant use  of their backs without yet having come to ambling with their bellies  in the air. Can they have neglected to accommodate themselves to the  demands of their environment? If evolution and environment cause the  topsy-turvy progress of the one, I have the right, if words have  any meaning whatever, to demand as much of the others, since their  organization is so much alike and their mode of life identical.    I have but little respect for theories which, when confronted with two  similar cases, are unable to interpret the one without contradicting the  other. They make me laugh when they become merely childish. For  example: why has the tiger a coat streaked black and yellow? A matter of  environment, replies one of our evolutionary masters. Ambushed in bamboo  thickets where the golden radiance of the sun is intersected by stripes  of shadow cast by the foliage, the animal, the better to conceal itself,  assumed the colour of its environment. The rays of the sun produced the  tawny yellow of the coat; the stripes of shadow added the black bars.    And there you have it. Any one who refuses to accept the explanation  must be very hard to please. I am one of these difficult persons. If it  were a dinner-table jest, made over the walnuts and the wine, I would  willingly sing ditto; but alas and alack, it is uttered without a  smile, in a solemn and magisterial manner, as the last word in science!  Toussenel, in his day, asked the naturalists an insidious question.  (Alphonse Toussenel (1803-1885), the author of a number of learned and  curious works on ornithology.--Translator's Note.) Why, he enquired,  have Ducks a little curly feather on the rump? No one, so far as I know,  had an answer for the teasing cross-examiner: evolution had not been  invented then. In our time the reason why would be forthcoming in a  moment, as lucid and as well-founded as the reason why of the tiger's  coat.    Enough of childish nonsense. The Cetonia-grub walks on its back because  it has always done so. The environment does not make the animal; it is  the animal that is made for the environment. To this simple philosophy,  which is quite antiquated nowadays, I will add another, which Socrates  expressed in these words:    \"What I know best is that I know nothing.\"        CHAPTER 6. THE TACHYTES.    The family of Wasps whose name I inscribe at the head of this chapter  has not hitherto, so far as I know, made much noise in the world. Its  annals are limited to methodical classifications, which make very poor  reading. The happy nations, men say, are those which have no history.  I accept this, but I also admit that it is possible to have a history  without ceasing to be happy. In the conviction that I shall not disturb  its prosperity, I will try to substitute the living, moving insect for  the insect impaled in a cork-bottomed box.    It has been adorned with a learned name, derived from the Greek  Tachytes, meaning rapidity, suddenness, speed. The creature's godfather,  as we see, had a smattering of Greek; its denomination is none the  less unfortunate: intended to instruct us by means of a characteristic  feature, the name leads us astray. Why is speed mentioned in this  connection? Why a label which prepares the mind for an exceptional  velocity and announces a race of peerless coursers? Nimble diggers of  burrows and eager hunters the Tachytes are, to be sure, but they are no  better than a host of rivals. Not the Sphex, nor the Ammophila, nor the  Bembex, nor many another would admit herself beaten in either flying  or running. At the nesting-season, all this tiny world of huntresses is  filled with astounding activity. The quality of a speedy worker being  common to all, none can boast of it to the exclusion of the rest.    Had I had a vote when the Tachytes was christened, I should have  suggested a short, harmonious, well-sounding name, meaning nothing else  than the thing meant. What better, for example, than the term Sphex? The  ear is satisfied and the mind is not corrupted by a prejudice, a  source of error to the beginner. I have not nearly as much liking for  Ammophila, which represents as a lover of the sands an animal whose  establishments call for compact soil. In short, if I had been forced, at  all costs, to concoct a barbarous appellation out of Latin or Greek in  order to recall the creature's leading characteristic, I should have  attempted to say, a passionate lover of the Locust.    Love of the Locust, in the broader sense of the Orthopteron, an  exclusive, intolerant love, handed down from mother to daughter with  a fidelity which the centuries fail to impair, this, yes, this indeed  depicts the Tachytes with greater accuracy than a name smacking of  the race-course. The Englishman has his roast-beef; the German his  sauerkraut; the Russian his caviare; the Neapolitan his macaroni; the  Piedmontese his polenta; the man of Carpentras his tian. The Tachytes  has her Locust. Her national dish is also that of the Sphex, with whom I  boldly associate her. The methodical classifier, who works in cemeteries  and seems to fly the living cities, keeps the two families far removed  from each other because of considerations and attaching to the nervures  of the wings and the joints of the palpi. At the risk of passing for a  heretic, I bring them together at the suggestion of the menu-card.    To my own knowledge, my part of the country possesses five species, one  and all addicted to a diet of Orthoptera. Panzer's Tachytes (T. Panzeri,  VAN DER LIND), girdled with red at the base of the abdomen, must be  pretty rare. I surprise her from time to time working on the hard  roadside banks and the trodden edges of the footpaths. There, to a depth  of an inch at most, she digs her burrows, each isolated from the  rest. Her prey is an adult, medium-sized Acridian (Locust or  Grasshopper.--Translator's Note.), such as the White-banded Sphex  pursues. The captive of the one would not be despised by the other.  Gripped by the antennae, according to the ritual of the Sphex, the  victim is trailed along on foot and laid beside the nest, with the head  pointing towards the opening. The pit, prepared in advance, is closed  for the time being with a tiny flagstone and some bits of gravel, in  order to avoid either the invasion of a passer-by or obstruction by  landslips during the huntress' absence. A like precaution is taken by  the White-banded Sphex. Both observe the same diet and the same customs.    The Tachytes clears the entrance to the home and goes in alone. She  returns, puts out her head and, seizing her prey by the antennae,  warehouses it by dragging backwards. I have repeated, at her expense,  the tricks which I used to play on the Sphex. (For the author's  experiments with the Languedocian, the Yellow-winged and the White-edged  Sphex, cf. \"The Hunting Wasps\": chapter 11.--Translator's Note.) While  the Tachytes is underground, I move the game away. The insect comes up  again and sees nothing at its door; it comes out and goes to fetch its  Locust, whom it places in position as before. This done, it goes in  again by itself. In its absence I once more pull back the prey. Fresh  emergence of the Wasp, who puts things to rights and persists in going  down again, still by herself, however often I repeat the experiment.

The most  terrific among these is the Supper of Paolo Veronese at S. Giorgio, in  which the gifts of nature are so nobly seconded by the exhibition of  talent, which appears to have been transmitted by succession through  this school, nearly until the present day. Such ability consists in  finely designing all the details of any work, however great, including  the transmission and gradations of light, so that the eye of itself  seems to follow its track, and embraces the entire effect from one end  of the canvass to the other. And it has been observed by several who  have witnessed ancient paintings (a violation of good taste, of late but  too common,) cut up and curtailed to adapt them to the size of walls and  doors, that such an operation often succeeds tolerably well with the  pictures of other schools, but is extremely difficult with those of the  Venetians; so intimately is one part connected with another, and  harmonized with the whole.    These, along with other similar qualities that flatter the eye of the  spectator, that attract the learned and the unlearned, and seem to  transport the mind by the novelty and the reality of the representation,  constitute a style which is termed by Reynolds the ornamental, who,  likewise, among all the schools, yields the palm in this to the  Venetians; a style afterwards introduced by Vovet into France, by Rubens  into Flanders, and by Giordano into Naples and into Spain. The same  English critic places it in the second rank, next to the grand style,  and remarks that the professors of the sublime were fearful of falling  into luxurious and pompous exhibitions of the accessaries; no less  because prejudicial to the artist's industry in point of design and in  point of expression, than because the transitory impression which it  produces upon the spectator, seldom reaches the heart. And truly, as the  sublime of Tully is more simple than the ornament of Pliny, and seems to  dread any excitement of admiration for the beautiful, lest its energy  should be unnerved by too studied a degree of elegance; so is it with  the grandeur of Michelangiolo and of Raffaello, that without seeking to  occupy us with the illusions of art, goes at once to the heart;  terrifies or inspires us; awakens emotions of pity, of veneration, and  the love of truth, exalting us, as it were, above ourselves, and leading  us to indulge, even in spite of ourselves, the most delicious of all  feelings, in that of wonder. It is upon this account that Reynolds  considered it dangerous for students to become enamoured of the Venetian  style; an opinion, which, judiciously understood, may prove of much  service to such artists as are calculated to succeed in the more  sublime. But since amidst such diversity of talent, there must appear  artists better adapted to adorn than to express; it would not be  advisable that their genius should be urged into a career in which it  will leave them always among the last, withdrawing them, at the same  time, from another in which they might have taken the lead. Let him,  therefore, who in this art of silent eloquence possesses not the energy  and spirit of Demosthenes, apply himself wholly, heart and soul, to the  elegance, the pomp, and the copiousness of Demetrius Phalereus.    Let it not from this be supposed, that the sole merit of the Venetians  consists in surprising the spectator by the effects of ornament and  colour, and that the customary style and true method of painting, were  not understood in those parts. Yet I am aware of the opinion of many  foreigners, who having never removed beyond their native spot, are  inclined to pronounce a general censure upon these artists, as being  ignorant of design, too laboured in their composition, unacquainted with  ideal beauty, and even unable to understand expression, costume, and  grace; finally, that the rapidity so much in vogue with the whole of the  school,[41] led them to despise the rules of art, not permitting them to  complete the work before them, out of an anxiety to engage in other  labours, for the sake of the profits afforded by them. To some of their  painters, doubtless, these observations may apply, but assuredly not to  the whole; for if one city be obnoxious to them, another is not so much  so; or if they can be affirmed of a certain epoch or class of artists,  it would be an idle attempt to fix them upon all. This school is in  truth most abundant, no less in artists than in fine examples in every  characteristic of the art; but neither one nor the other are  sufficiently known and appreciated. Yet it is hoped the reader will be  enabled to form a more correct idea of both; and after having cultivated  an acquaintance with the Bellini, the Giorgioni, and the Titians,  besides other masters, will trace, as it were from one parent stock, the  various offshoots transplanted throughout the state, imbibing, according  to the nature of the soil, and the vicinity of other climes, new tastes  and qualities, without losing at the same time their original and native  flavour. And if in the progress of our history we shall here and there,  among plants of nobler growth, meet with some \"_lazzi sorbi_,\" to use  the words of our poet, some bitter apples, growing at their side; let  these only be attacked; but let not the disgrace attaching to a few  careless artists be calumniously extended to the whole of their school.    The happy era we are now entering upon, commences with Giorgione and  with Titian, two names which, connected together, yet in competition  with each other, divided between them, as it were, the whole body of  disciples throughout the capital and the state; insomuch that we find no  city that had not more or less adopted for its model one or other of  these masters. I shall proceed to describe them separately, each with  his own class, as I believe such a method most favourable, to shew how  the whole of the school I am describing was almost entirely derived and  propagated from two masters of a similar style. Giorgio Barbarelli of  Castelfranco, more generally known by the name of Giorgione, from a  certain grandeur conferred upon him by nature, no less of mind than  form, and which appears also impressed upon his productions, as the  character is said to be in the handwriting, was educated in the school  of the Bellini. But impelled by a spirit conscious of its own powers, he  despised that minuteness in the art which yet remained to be exploded,  at once substituting for it a certain freedom and audacity of manner, in  which the perfection of painting consists. In this view he may be said  to be an inventor; no artist before his time having acquired that  mastery of his pencil, so hardy and determined in its strokes, and  producing such an effect in the distance. From that period he continued  to ennoble his manner, rendering the contours more round and ample, the  foreshortenings more new, the expression of the countenance more warm  and lively, as well as the motions of his figures. His drapery, with all  the other accessaries of the art became more select, the gradations of  the different colours more soft and natural, and his chiaroscuro more  powerful and effective. It was in this last indeed, that Venetian  painting was the most deficient, while it had been introduced into the  rest of the schools by Vinci previous to the sixteenth century. Vasari  is of opinion that from the same artist, or rather from some of his  designs, it was first acquired by Giorgione, a supposition that Boschini  will not admit, maintaining that he was only indebted for it to himself,  being his own master and scholar. And, in truth, the taste of Lionardo  and of the Milanese artists who acquired it from him, not only differs  in point of design, inclining in the contours and in the features more  towards the graceful and the beautiful, while Giorgione affects rather a  round and full expression; but it is contrasted with it, likewise, in  the chiaroscuro. The composition of Lionardo abounds much more in  shades, which are gradually softened with greater care; while in regard  to his lights he is far more sparing, and studies to unite them in a  small space with a degree of vividness that produces surprise.  Giorgione's composition, on the other hand, is more clear and open, and  with less shade; his middle tints, also, partake in nothing of the  ironcast and grey, but are natural and beautiful; and in short, he  approaches nearer to the style of Coreggio, if Mengs at least judges  rightly, than to any other master. Still I am far from concluding that  Vinci in no way contributed to the formation of Giorgione's new manner;  every improvement in the art having taken its rise from some former one,  which being admired for its novelty, became familiar to surrounding  artists by example, and to more distant ones by its reputation, thus  adding what was before wanting to the perfection of the art. And in this  way have geniuses in different parts arisen, destined to increase and  improve such advantages. This, if I mistake not, has been the case with  the science of perspective, subsequent to the time of Pier della  Francesca; with regard to foreshortening after Melozzo; and also with  chiaroscuro after Lionardo.    The works of Giorgione were, for the chief part, executed in fresco,  upon the facades of the houses, more particularly in Venice, where there  now remains scarcely a relic of them, as if to remind us only of what  have perished. Many of his pictures, on the other hand, both there and  in other places, painted in oil and preserved in private houses, are  found in excellent condition; the cause of which is attributed to the  strong mixture of the colours, and to the full and liberal use of his  pencil. In particular we meet with portraits, remarkable for the soul of  their expression, for the air of"]]]
