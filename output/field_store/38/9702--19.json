He said:    \"I suppose you know pretty well what the process of government was in the  bad old times?\"    \"I am supposed to know,\" said I.    (Hammond)  What was the government of those days?  Was it really the  Parliament or any part of it?    (I)  No.    (H.)  Was not the Parliament on the one side a kind of watch-committee  sitting to see that the interests of the Upper Classes took no hurt; and  on the other side a sort of blind to delude the people into supposing  that they had some share in the management of their own affairs?    (I)  History seems to show us this.    (H.)  To what extent did the people manage their own affairs?    (I)  I judge from what I have heard that sometimes they forced the  Parliament to make a law to legalise some alteration which had already  taken place.    (H.)  Anything else?    (I)  I think not.  As I am informed, if the people made any attempt to  deal with the _cause_ of their grievances, the law stepped in and said,  this is sedition, revolt, or what not, and slew or tortured the  ringleaders of such attempts.    (H.)  If Parliament was not the government then, nor the people either,  what was the government?    (I)  Can you tell me?    (H.)  I think we shall not be far wrong if we say that government was the  Law-Courts, backed up by the executive, which handled the brute force  that the deluded people allowed them to use for their own purposes; I  mean the army, navy, and police.    (I)  Reasonable men must needs think you are right.    (H.)  Now as to those Law-Courts.  Were they places of fair dealing  according to the ideas of the day?  Had a poor man a good chance of  defending his property and person in them?    (I)  It is a commonplace that even rich men looked upon a law-suit as a  dire misfortune, even if they gained the case; and as for a poor one--why,  it was considered a miracle of justice and beneficence if a poor man who  had once got into the clutches of the law escaped prison or utter ruin.    (H.)  It seems, then, my son, that the government by law-courts and  police, which was the real government of the nineteenth century, was not  a great success even to the people of that day, living under a class  system which proclaimed inequality and poverty as the law of God and the  bond which held the world together.    (I)  So it seems, indeed.    (H.)  And now that all this is changed, and the \"rights of property,\"  which mean the clenching the fist on a piece of goods and crying out to  the neighbours, You shan't have this!--now that all this has disappeared  so utterly that it is no longer possible even to jest upon its absurdity,  is such a Government possible?    (I)  It is impossible.    (H.)  Yes, happily.  But for what other purpose than the protection of  the rich from the poor, the strong from the weak, did this Government  exist?    (I.)  I have heard that it was said that their office was to defend their  own citizens against attack from other countries.    (H.)  It was said; but was anyone expected to believe this?  For  instance, did the English Government defend the English citizen against  the French?    (I)  So it was said.    (H.)  Then if the French had invaded England and conquered it, they would  not have allowed the English workmen to live well?    (I, laughing)  As far as I can make out, the English masters of the  English workmen saw to that: they took from their workmen as much of  their livelihood as they dared, because they wanted it for themselves.    (H.)  But if the French had conquered, would they not have taken more  still from the English workmen?    (I)  I do not think so; for in that case the English workmen would have  died of starvation; and then the French conquest would have ruined the  French, just as if the English horses and cattle had died of  under-feeding.  So that after all, the English _workmen_ would have been  no worse off for the conquest: their French Masters could have got no  more from them than their English masters did.    (H.)  This is true; and we may admit that the pretensions of the  government to defend the poor (_i.e._, the useful) people against other  countries come to nothing.  But that is but natural; for we have seen  already that it was the function of government to protect the rich  against the poor.  But did not the government defend its rich men against  other nations?    (I)  I do not remember to have heard that the rich needed defence;  because it is said that even when two nations were at war, the rich men  of each nation gambled with each other pretty much as usual, and even  sold each other weapons wherewith to kill their own countrymen.    (H.)  In short, it comes to this, that whereas the so-called government  of protection of property by means of the law-courts meant destruction of  wealth, this defence of the citizens of one country against those of  another country by means of war or the threat of war meant pretty much  the same thing.    (I)  I cannot deny it.    (H.)  Therefore the government really existed for the destruction of  wealth?    (I)  So it seems.  And yet--    (H.)  Yet what?    (I)  There were many rich people in those times.    (H.)  You see the consequences of that fact?    (I)  I think I do.  But tell me out what they were.    (H.)  If the government habitually destroyed wealth, the country must  have been poor?    (I)  Yes, certainly.    (H.)  Yet amidst this poverty the persons for the sake of whom the  government existed insisted on being rich whatever might happen?    (I)  So it was.    (H.)  What must happen if in a poor country some people insist on being  rich at the expense of the others?    (I)  Unutterable poverty for the others.  All this misery, then, was  caused by the destructive government of which we have been speaking?    (H.)  Nay, it would be incorrect to say so.  The government itself was  but the necessary result of the careless, aimless tyranny of the times;  it was but the machinery of tyranny.  Now tyranny has come to an end, and  we no longer need such machinery; we could not possibly use it since we  are free.  Therefore in your sense of the word we have no government.  Do  you understand this now?    (I)  Yes, I do.  But I will ask you some more questions as to how you as  free men manage your affairs.    (H.)  With all my heart.  Ask away.          CHAPTER XII: CONCERNING THE ARRANGEMENT OF LIFE      \"Well,\" I said, \"about those 'arrangements' which you spoke of as taking  the place of government, could you give me any account of them?\"    \"Neighbour,\" he said, \"although we have simplified our lives a great deal  from what they were, and have got rid of many conventionalities and many  sham wants, which used to give our forefathers much trouble, yet our life  is too complex for me to tell you in detail by means of words how it is  arranged; you must find that out by living amongst us.  It is true that I  can better tell you what we don't do, than what we do do.\"    \"Well?\" said I.    \"This is the way to put it,\" said he: \"We have been living for a hundred  and fifty years, at least, more or less in our present manner, and a  tradition or habit of life has been growing on us; and that habit has  become a habit of acting on the whole for the best.  It is easy for us to  live without robbing each other.  It would be possible for us to contend  with and rob each other, but it would be harder for us than refraining  from strife and robbery.  That is in short the foundation of our life and  our happiness.\"    \"Whereas in the old days,\" said I, \"it was very hard to live without  strife and robbery.  That's what you mean, isn't it, by giving me the  negative side of your good conditions?\"    \"Yes,\" he said, \"it was so hard, that those who habitually acted fairly  to their neighbours were celebrated as saints and heroes, and were looked  up to with the greatest reverence.\"    \"While they were alive?\" said I.    \"No,\" said he, \"after they were dead.\"    \"But as to these days,\" I said; \"you don't mean to tell me that no one  ever transgresses this habit of good fellowship?\"    \"Certainly not,\" said Hammond, \"but when the transgressions occur,  everybody, transgressors and all, know them for what they are; the errors  of friends, not the habitual actions of persons driven into enmity  against society.\"    \"I see,\" said I; \"you mean that you have no 'criminal' classes.\"    \"How could we have them,\" said he, \"since there is no rich class to breed  enemies against the state by means of the injustice of the state?\"    Said I: \"I thought that I understood from something that fell from you a  little while ago that you had abolished civil law.  Is that so,  literally?\"    \"It abolished itself, my friend,\" said he.  \"As I said before, the civil  law-courts were upheld for the defence of private property; for nobody  ever pretended that it was possible to make people act fairly to each  other by means of brute force.  Well, private property being abolished,  all the laws and all the legal 'crimes' which it had manufactured of  course came to an end.  Thou shalt not steal, had to be translated into,  Thou shalt work in order to live happily.  Is there any need to enforce  that commandment by violence?\"    \"Well,\" said I, \"that is understood, and I agree with it; but how about  crimes of violence? would not their occurrence (and you admit that they  occur) make criminal law necessary?\"    Said he: \"In your sense of the word, we have no criminal law either.  Let  us look at the matter closer, and see whence crimes of violence spring.  By far the greater part of these in past days were the result of the laws  of private property, which forbade the satisfaction of their natural  desires to all but a privileged few, and of the general visible coercion  which came of those laws.

The acting Quartermaster General, Col.       D. H. Rucker, April 10, 1867, addressed a letter to all the       officers in charge of depots, with instructions not to issue any       more of the shoes in question, but to report to this office the       quantity remaining in store. From these reports it appears that       there were in store at that time 362,012 pairs M. S. Bootees, all       of which were ordered to be, and have since been sold at public       auction.[81]    The exact complaint against the shoes was not recorded. Possibly the  entire shoe was stitched by machine. It was found that although  machine-stitched shoes were more durable in some respects and the upper  parts of most shoes continued to be machine stitched, pegged soles for  the more durable varieties remained the fashion for a decade or more, as  did custom hand-stitched shoes for those who could afford them.      OTHER USES    The use of sewing machines in all types of manufacturing that required  stitching of any type continued to grow each year. While the principal  purpose for which they were utilized continued to be the manufacture of  clothing items, by the year 1900 they were also used for awnings, tents,  and sails; cloth bags; bookbinding and related book manufacture; flags  and banners; pocketbooks, trunks, and valises; saddlery and harnesses;  mattresses; umbrellas; linen and rubber belting and hose; to the  aggregate sum of nearly a billion dollars--$979,988,413.[82]      SEWING-MACHINE ATTACHMENTS    The growing popularity of the sewing machine offered still another boost  to the economy--the development of many minor, related manufacturing  industries. The repetitive need for machine needles, the development of  various types of attachments to simplify the many sewing tasks, and the  ever-increasing need for more and better sewing thread--the sewing  machine consumed from two to five times as much thread as stitching by  hand--created new manufacturing establishments and new jobs.    [Illustration: Figure 59.--SHANK'S patent bobbin winder, 1870.  (Smithsonian photo P-6398.)]    [Illustration: Figure 60.--SWEET'S patent binder, 1853.

(Smithsonian  photo P-6399.)]    [Illustration: Figure 63.--HARRIS' patent buttonhole attachment, 1882.  (Smithsonian photo P-63103.)]    The method of manufacturing machine needles did not differ appreciably  from the method used in making the common sewing needle, but the latter  had never become an important permanent industry in the United States.  Since the manufacture of practical sewing machines was essentially an  American development and the eye-pointed needle a vital component of the  machine, it followed that the manufacture of needles would also develop  here. Although such a manufacture was established in 1852,[83] foreign  imports still supplied much of the need in the 1870s. As more highly  specialized stitching machines were developed, an ever-increasing  variety of needles was required, and the industry grew.    [Illustration: Figure 64.--THE TREADLE OF THE MACHINE was also used to  help create music. George D. Garvie and George Wood received patent  267,874, Nov. 21, 1882, for \"a cover for a sewing machine provided with  a musical instrument and means for transmitting motion from the shaft of  the sewing machine to the operating parts of the musical instrument.\"  Although no patent model was submitted by the inventors, the \"Musical  Sewing Machine Cover\" was offered for sale as early as October 1882, as  shown by this advertisement that appeared in _The Sewing Machine News_  that month. (Smithsonian photo 57983.)]    Soon after the sewing machine was commercially successful, special  attachments for it were invented and manufactured. These ranged from the  simplest devices for cutting thread to complicated ones for making  buttonholes (see figs. 56 through 66).    [Illustration: Figure 65.--THIS FANNING ATTACHMENT was commercially  available from James Morrison & Co. in the early 1870s; it sold for one  dollar as stated in the advertising brochure from which this engraving  was copied. Other inventors also patented similar implements.  (Smithsonian photo 45513.)]    The first patent for an attachment was issued in 1853 to Harry Sweet for  a binder, used to stitch a special binding edge to the fabric. Other  related attachments followed; among these were the hemmer which was  similar to the binder, but turned the edge of the same piece of fabric  to itself as the stitching was performed. Guides for stitching braid in  any pattern, as directed by the movement of the goods below, were also  developed; this was followed by the embroiderer, an elaborate form of  braider. The first machine to stitch buttonholes was patented in 1854  and the first buttonhole attachment in 1856, but the latter was not  practical until improvements were made in the late 1860s. Special  devices for refilling the bobbins were invented and patented as early as  1862, and the popularity of tucked and ruffled garments inspired  inventors to provide sewing-machine attachments for these purposes also.  To keep the seamstress cool, C. D. Stewart patented an attachment for  fanning the operator by an action derived from the treadle (fig. 65).  While electric sewing machines did not become common until the 20th  century, several 19th-century inventors considered the possibility of  attaching a type of motor to the machine. One was the 1871 patent of  Solomon Jones, who added an \"electro motor\" to an 1865 Bartlett machine  (fig. 66). The attachments that were developed during the latter part of  the 19th century numbered in the thousands; many of these were  superfluous. Most of the basic ones in use today were developed by the  1880s and remain almost unchanged. Even the recently popular home zigzag  machine, an outgrowth of the buttonhole machine, was in commercial use  by the 1870s.    [Illustration: Figure 66.--JONES \"ELECTRO MOTOR\" PATENT MODEL of 1871 on  a Bartlett sewing machine. (Smithsonian photo P-63104.)]    Sewing-machine improvements have been made from time to time. Like other  mechanical items the machine has become increasingly automatic, but the  basic principles remain the same. One of the more recent developments,  patented[84] in 1933 by Valentine Naftali et al., is for a manufacturing  machine that imitates hand stitching. This machine uses a two-pointed  \"floating needle\" that is passed completely through the fabric--the very  idea that was attempted over one hundred years ago. The machine is  currently used by commercial manufacturers to produce decorative  edge-stitching that very closely resembles hand stitching.      THREAD FOR THE MACHINE    [Illustration: Figure 67.--SIX-CORD cabled thread.]    The need for a good thread durable enough to withstand the action of  machine stitching first created a problem and ultimately another new  industry in this country. When the sewing machine was first developed  the inventors necessarily had to use the sewing thread that was  available. But, although the contemporary thread was quite suitable for  hand sewing, it did not lend itself to the requirements of the machine.  Cotton thread, then more commonly a three-ply variety, had a glazed  finish and was wiry. Silk thread frequently broke owing to abrasion at  the needle eye. For the most part linen thread was too coarse, or the  fine variety was too expensive. All of the thread had imperfections that  went unnoticed in the hands of a seamstress, but caused havoc in a  machine. Quality silk thread that would withstand the rigors of machine  stitching could be produced, but it was quite expensive also. A new type  of inexpensive thread was needed; the obvious answer lay in improving  the cotton thread.[85]    In addition to the popular three-ply variety, cotton thread was also  made by twisting together either two single yarns or more than three  yarns. Increasing the number of yarns produced a more cylindrical  thread. The earliest record of a six-ply cotton thread was about  1840.[86] And in 1850 C. E. Bennett of Portsmouth, New Hampshire,  received a gold medal for superior six-cord, or six-ply, spool cotton at  the Fair of the American Institute. But the thread was still wiry and  far from satisfactory. By the mid-1860s the demonstrated need for thread  manufacturers in America brought George A. Clark and William Clark,  third generation cotton-thread manufacturers of Paisley, Scotland, to  Newark, New Jersey, where they built a large mill. George Clark decided  that a thread having both a softer finish and a different construction  was needed. He produced a six-cord cabled thread, made up of three  two-ply yarns (see fig. 67). The thread was called \"Clark's 'Our New  Thread,'\" which was later shortened to O.N.T. The basic machine-thread  problem was solved. When other manufacturers used the six-cord cabled  construction they referred to their thread as \"Best Six-Cord\"[87] or  \"Superior Six-Cord\"[88] to distinguish it from the earlier variety made  up of six single yarns in a simple twist. Another new side industry of  the sewing machine was successfully established.      MANUFACTURE AND EXPORT, TO 1900    Sewing machines were a commodity in themselves, both at home and abroad.  In 1850, there were no establishments exclusively devoted to the  manufacture of sewing machines, the few constructed were made in small  machine shops. The industry, however, experienced a very rapid growth  during the next ten years. By 1860 there were 74 factories in 12  States,[89] mainly in the East and Midwest,[90] producing over 111,000  sewing machines a year. In addition, there were 14 "]]]
