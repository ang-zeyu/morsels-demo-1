For  Thou hadst not forgiven me any of these things in Christ, nor had He  abolished by His Cross the enmity which by my sins I had incurred with  Thee. For how should He, by the crucifixion of a phantasm, which I  believed Him to be? So true, then, was the death of my soul, as that  of His flesh seemed to me false; and how true the death of His body,  so false was the life of my soul, which did not believe it. And now the  fever heightening, I was parting and departing for ever. For had I then  parted hence, whither had I departed, but into fire and torments, such  as my misdeeds deserved in the truth of Thy appointment? And this she  knew not, yet in absence prayed for me. But Thou, everywhere present,  heardest her where she was, and, where I was, hadst compassion upon me;  that I should recover the health of my body, though frenzied as yet  in my sacrilegious heart. For I did not in all that danger desire Thy  baptism; and I was better as a boy, when I begged it of my mother's  piety, as I have before recited and confessed. But I had grown up to my  own shame, and I madly scoffed at the prescripts of Thy medicine, who  wouldest not suffer me, being such, to die a double death. With which  wound had my mother's heart been pierced, it could never be healed. For  I cannot express the affection she bore to me, and with how much more  vehement anguish she was now in labour of me in the spirit, than at her  childbearing in the flesh.    I see not then how she should have been healed, had such a death of mine  stricken through the bowels of her love. And where would have been those  her so strong and unceasing prayers, unintermitting to Thee alone? But  wouldest Thou, God of mercies, despise the contrite and humbled heart of  that chaste and sober widow, so frequent in almsdeeds, so full of duty  and service to Thy saints, no day intermitting the oblation at Thine  altar, twice a day, morning and evening, without any intermission,  coming to Thy church, not for idle tattlings and old wives' fables; but  that she might hear Thee in Thy discourses, and Thou her in her prayers.  Couldest Thou despise and reject from Thy aid the tears of such an one,  wherewith she begged of Thee not gold or silver, nor any mutable or  passing good, but the salvation of her son's soul? Thou, by whose gift  she was such? Never, Lord. Yea, Thou wert at hand, and wert hearing and  doing, in that order wherein Thou hadst determined before that it should  be done. Far be it that Thou shouldest deceive her in Thy visions and  answers, some whereof I have, some I have not mentioned, which she laid  up in her faithful heart, and ever praying, urged upon Thee, as  Thine own handwriting. For Thou, because Thy mercy endureth for ever,  vouchsafest to those to whom Thou forgivest all of their debts, to  become also a debtor by Thy promises.    Thou recoveredst me then of that sickness, and healedst the son of Thy  handmaid, for the time in body, that he might live, for Thee to bestow  upon him a better and more abiding health. And even then, at Rome, I  joined myself to those deceiving and deceived \"holy ones\"; not with  their disciples only (of which number was he, in whose house I had  fallen sick and recovered); but also with those whom they call \"The  Elect.\" For I still thought \"that it was not we that sin, but that I  know not what other nature sinned in us\"; and it delighted my pride, to  be free from blame; and when I had done any evil, not to confess I had  done any, that Thou mightest heal my soul because it had sinned against  Thee: but I loved to excuse it, and to accuse I know not what other  thing, which was with me, but which I was not. But in truth it was  wholly I, and mine impiety had divided me against myself: and that sin  was the more incurable, whereby I did not judge myself a sinner; and  execrable iniquity it was, that I had rather have Thee, Thee, O God  Almighty, to be overcome in me to my destruction, than myself of Thee to  salvation. Not as yet then hadst Thou set a watch before my mouth, and a  door of safe keeping around my lips, that my heart might not turn  aside to wicked speeches, to make excuses of sins, with men that work  iniquity; and, therefore, was I still united with their Elect.    But now despairing to make proficiency in that false doctrine, even  those things (with which if I should find no better, I had resolved to  rest contented) I now held more laxly and carelessly. For there half  arose a thought in me that those philosophers, whom they call Academics,  were wiser than the rest, for that they held men ought to doubt  everything, and laid down that no truth can be comprehended by man:  for so, not then understanding even their meaning, I also was clearly  convinced that they thought, as they are commonly reported. Yet did I  freely and openly discourage that host of mine from that over-confidence  which I perceived him to have in those fables, which the books of  Manichaeus are full of. Yet I lived in more familiar friendship with  them, than with others who were not of this heresy. Nor did I maintain  it with my ancient eagerness; still my intimacy with that sect (Rome  secretly harbouring many of them) made me slower to seek any other way:  especially since I despaired of finding the truth, from which they had  turned me aside, in Thy Church, O Lord of heaven and earth, Creator of  all things visible and invisible: and it seemed to me very unseemly to  believe Thee to have the shape of human flesh, and to be bounded by the  bodily lineaments of our members. And because, when I wished to think on  my God, I knew not what to think of, but a mass of bodies (for what was  not such did not seem to me to be anything), this was the greatest, and  almost only cause of my inevitable error.    For hence I believed Evil also to be some such kind of substance, and  to have its own foul and hideous bulk; whether gross, which they called  earth, or thin and subtile (like the body of the air), which they  imagine to be some malignant mind, creeping through that earth. And  because a piety, such as it was, constrained me to believe that the good  God never created any evil nature, I conceived two masses, contrary  to one another, both unbounded, but the evil narrower, the good more  expansive. And from this pestilent beginning, the other sacrilegious  conceits followed on me. For when my mind endeavoured to recur to the  Catholic faith, I was driven back, since that was not the Catholic faith  which I thought to be so. And I seemed to myself more reverential, if I  believed of Thee, my God (to whom Thy mercies confess out of my mouth),  as unbounded, at least on other sides, although on that one where the  mass of evil was opposed to Thee, I was constrained to confess Thee  bounded; than if on all sides I should imagine Thee to be bounded by the  form of a human body. And it seemed to me better to believe Thee to have  created no evil (which to me ignorant seemed not some only, but a bodily  substance, because I could not conceive of mind unless as a subtile  body, and that diffused in definite spaces), than to believe the nature  of evil, such as I conceived it, could come from Thee. Yea, and our  Saviour Himself, Thy Only Begotten, I believed to have been reached  forth (as it were) for our salvation, out of the mass of Thy most lucid  substance, so as to believe nothing of Him, but what I could imagine in  my vanity. His Nature then, being such, I thought could not be born  of the Virgin Mary, without being mingled with the flesh: and how that  which I had so figured to myself could be mingled, and not defiled, I  saw not. I feared therefore to believe Him born in the flesh, lest  I should be forced to believe Him defiled by the flesh. Now will Thy  spiritual ones mildly and lovingly smile upon me, if they shall read  these my confessions. Yet such was I.    Furthermore, what the Manichees had criticised in Thy Scriptures, I  thought could not be defended; yet at times verily I had a wish to  confer upon these several points with some one very well skilled in  those books, and to make trial what he thought thereon; for the words  of one Helpidius, as he spoke and disputed face to face against the  said Manichees, had begun to stir me even at Carthage: in that he  had produced things out of the Scriptures, not easily withstood, the  Manichees' answer whereto seemed to me weak. And this answer they  liked not to give publicly, but only to us in private. It was, that the  Scriptures of the New Testament had been corrupted by I know not whom,  who wished to engraff the law of the Jews upon the Christian faith: yet  themselves produced not any uncorrupted copies. But I, conceiving of  things corporeal only, was mainly held down, vehemently oppressed and  in a manner suffocated by those \"masses\"; panting under which after the  breath of Thy truth, I could not breathe it pure and untainted.    I began then diligently to practise that for which I came to Rome, to  teach rhetoric; and first, to gather some to my house, to whom, and  through whom, I had begun to be known; when lo, I found other offences  committed in Rome, to which I was not exposed in Africa. True, those  \"subvertings\" by profligate young men were not here practised, as was  told me: but on a sudden, said they, to avoid paying their  master's stipend, a number of youths plot together, and remove to  another;--breakers of faith, who for love of money hold justice cheap.  These also my heart hated, though not with a perfect hatred: for  perchance I hated them more because I was to suffer by them, than  because they did things utterly unlawful. Of a truth such are base  persons, and they go a whoring from Thee, loving these fleeting  mockeries of things temporal, and filthy lucre, which fouls the hand  that grasps it; hugging the fleeting world, and despising Thee,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32982"],[0,"Student's Hand-book of Mushrooms of America, Edible and Poisonous (#16)"],[1,". Viscidi.--Pileus naked, viscid. Example, Ag. (Hypholoma) _oedipus_.    3. Velutini.--Pileus silky, with innate fibrils. Example, Ag.  (Hypholoma) _velutinus_.    4. Flocculosi.--Pileus clad with floccose superficial evanescent scales.  Example, Ag. (Hypholoma) _cascus_.    5. Appendiculati.--Pileus smooth and hygrophanous. Example, Ag.  (Hypholoma) _Candollianus_.    The species are not numerous. They are generally either gregarious or  caespitose, and are often found in clusters upon tree stumps, or  springing from the buried roots of stumps. A few species are found in  short grass in open places; but few are recorded as edible, and one, H.  _fascicularis_, has been classed as deleterious by Berkeley, Cooke, and  some of the earlier authors. I find, however, no authenticated case of  poisoning by this species, and, indeed, have as yet found no species of  Hypholoma which could be satisfactorily identified as H. fascicularis.    The few species of Hypholoma which I have tested have been palatable,  and one or two are of very delicate flavor.         [Illustration: Plate VIII.       EDIBLE       Agaricus (Hypholoma) _sublateritius_ Fries (Hypholoma sublatertium)       \"Brick Top.\"       Group from Seabrooke Woods, Md.       T. Taylor, del.]         PLATE VIII.         =Ag. (Hypholoma) sublateritius= Schaeff. \"_Red Tuft_.\" (=Hypholoma       sublateritium=) \"_The Brick Top_.\"         EDIBLE.    The cap of this species is fleshy and obtuse, convexo-plane, sometimes  showing a superficial whitish cloudiness upon the margin coming from the  veil, which soon disappears, leaving it smooth and dry; color tawny  brick red, with pale straw margin; flesh compact and whitish, turning  yellow when wilted. Stem stuffed and fibrillose, tapering downward. Near  its attachment to the cap the color is very light yellow; lower down and  towards the root it is covered with patches and lines of burnt sienna  color. It bears no distinct ring. In very young plants the filmy veil is  sometimes perceived, reaching from the margin of the cap to the stem.  This disappears as the cap expands, sometimes leaving the stem obscurely  annulate. Gills adnate in full-grown specimens, slightly decurrent,  somewhat crowded, dingy white or cinereous, turning to dark olive, never  yellow; in old or wilted specimens changing to a dark brown. In old  specimens the cap is a reddish brown and the gills are sometimes stained  with the purplish brown of the spores.    This is a very common species and very abundant in pine and oak woods. I  have seen an oak stump in Prince George's County, Md., measuring from 3  to 4 feet in height, literally covered with mushrooms of this species.  This mushroom has been recorded as suspicious by some writers, probably  owing to its slightly bitter taste, but I have thoroughly tested its  edible qualities, both uncooked and prepared in various ways for the  table, using the caps only. It keeps well when dried, and when ground  into powder, with the addition of boiling water and a little pepper and  salt, makes a very pleasant and nutritious beverage. It is most abundant  in the early autumn, and is gathered in this latitude well into the  winter, even when the snow is on the ground.    Our American plant is less heavy and more graceful in aspect than the  same species in England, as figured in English works, but the general  characteristics are the same.    Ag. (Hypholoma) _fascicularis_ Hudson, recorded as deleterious, is  figured in \"Cooke's Illustrations.\"    Dr. Berkeley thus distinguishes these two species from each other. Cap  of _sublateritius_ is obtuse, discoid; that of _fascicularis_,  subumbonate. Flesh of the former, compact, dingy-white; that of the  latter, yellow. Stem in _sublateritius_ is \"stuffed,\" attenuated  downwards, ferruginous; stem of _fascicularis_ hollow, thin, flexuose.  The gills in both species are adnate, crowded; but in _fascicularis_  they are also linear and deliquescent, and are _yellow_ in color.    NOTE.--In the Friesian arrangement of the genera of the order Agaricini,  which is adopted by M. C. Cooke, Hypholoma finds place as a subgenus of  the genus Agaricus, spore series Pratelli. Saccardo in his Sylloge  elevates Hypholoma to the rank of a separate genus and places it in his  spore series Melanosporae.         [Illustration: Plate IX.       EDIBLE       Agaricus (Hypholoma) _Candollianus_, Fries., variety _incertus_ Peck       Figured from specimens collected in the District of Columbia       T. Taylor, del.]         PLATE IX.         =Agaricus (Hypholoma) incertus= Peck. (_Hypholoma incertum_.)         EDIBLE.    Cap fleshy but fragile, smooth and hygrophanous, moist; at first convex,  then expanding; color creamy white. Gills adnate, narrow, crowded,  whitish in young specimens, turning to a pinkish dun color, later to a  rosy cinnamon, sometimes showing when mature a slightly purplish tint.  Stem smooth, slender, long and hollow, with slight striations near the  apex, white. Specimens occur in which the stem is obscurely annulate  arising from the attachment to it of fragments of the veil, but usually  it is ringless.    The typical species of Hypholoma have the fleshy part of the cap  confluent with the stem, but in H. _incertum_ the stem is not confluent  and is easily separated from the cap as in the Lepiotas. This mushroom  was first recorded by Peck in his early reports as the variety  \"_incertus_\" of the species Agaricus (Hypholoma) Candollianus, but has  since been recorded by Saccardo as a distinct species, Hypholoma  incertum.    Two species of Hypholoma have the same habit and sufficiently resemble  _incertum_ to be taken for it, if not carefully examined as to points of  difference. These are H. _Candollianum_, named in honor of A. De  Candolle, and H. _appendiculatum_. In the first named of these two  species the cap is whitish, the gills at first violet in color, changing  to dark cinnamon brown. In H. appendiculatum the pileus is rugose when  dry, and sprinkled with atoms. It is darker in color than that of H.  incertum; Cooke says tawny or pale ochre; Massee says bay, then tawny.  The gills are sub-adnate, in color resembling those of H. incertum; stem  slender, smooth, and white.    From the foregoing it will be seen that H. _incertum_ agrees more nearly  with H. _Candollianum_ in the color of the cap, but more nearly with H.  _appendiculatum_ in the color of the gills. Saccardo recognizes the  three as \"distinct species of the _genus Hypholoma_.\" As all are edible,  the slight differences observed are interesting chiefly to the  mycologist. The mycophagist will find them equally valuable from a  gastronomic point of view. In taste they resemble the common mushroom.  They are more fragile, however, and require less cooking than the  cultivated mushroom. Broiled on toast or cooked for ten minutes in a  chafing dish, they make a very acceptable addition to the lunch menu.    The specimens figured in Plate IX were selected from a crop of thirty or  more growing in the author's garden, in very rich soil at the base of a  plum-tree stump. For several seasons past small crops have been gathered  from the same spot, as well as around the base of a flourishing peach  tree. Quantities of all three species have been gathered in the short  grass of the Capitol grounds for a number of seasons, and in the various  parks of the District of Columbia. Specimens have been received from  western New York and Massachusetts. Those growing upon soil very heavily  fertilized are apt to be somewhat stouter and shorter stemmed than those  coming up through the short grass in the parks.          ANALYTICAL TABLE.      The following compendious analytical table showing prominent  characteristics of the leading genera and subgenera of the order  Agaricini, according to Fries, Worthington Smith, and other botanists,  which appears in Cooke's Hand Book, revised edition, will be found  helpful to the collector in determining the genus to which a specimen  may belong.
