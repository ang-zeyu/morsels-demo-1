Will you give us a hand, Collins?\" For Price and Mosey  were silently returning to their teams.    \"Certainly, I will.\"    \"Well, it's a half day's contract I'll git some breakfast ready,  while you (fellows) unloosens the ropes.\"    Thompson and I released the bullocks from the pole, unfastened the ropes,  and brought the wagon down to its wheels again.  Then Cooper  summoned us to breakfast.    \"You'll jist take sort o' pot-luck, Collins,\" he remarked.  \"I should 'a' baked some soda bread an' boiled some meat last night,  on'y for bein' too busy doin' nothing.  Laziness is catchin'.  That's why I hate a lot o' fellers campin' together; it's nothing but yarn,  yarn; an' your wagon ain't greazed, an' your tarpolin ain't looked to;  an' nothin done but yarn, yarn; an' you floggin' in your own mind  at not gittin' ahead o' your work.  That's where women's got the purchase  on us (fellows).  When a lot o' women gits together,  one o' them reads out something religious, an' the rest all wires in at sewin',  or knittin', or some (adj.) thing.  They can't suffer to be idle,  nor to see anybody else idle--women can't.\" Cooper was an observer.  It was pleasant to hear him philosophise.    The work of reloading was made severe and tedious by the lack  of any better skids than the poles of the two wagons--was, indeed,  made impossible under the circumstances, but for Cooper's enormous  and wellsaved strength.  Our toil was enlivened, however,  by an argument as to the esoteric cause of the capsize.  Cooper maintained  that nothing better could have been hoped for, after leaving Kenilworth shed  on a Friday; Thompson, untrammelled by such superstition,  contended that the misadventure was solely due to travelling on Sunday;  whilst I held it to be merely a proof that Cooper, in spite of his sins,  wasn't deserted yet.  Each of us supported his argument by a wealth  of illustrative cases, and thus fortified his own stubborn opinion  to his own perfect satisfaction.  Then, descending to more tangible things,  we discussed Cleopatra.  Here we were unanimous in deciding  that the horse had, as yet, disclosed only two faults, and these not the faults  of the Irishman's horse in the weary yarn.  One of them, we concluded,  was to buck like a demon on being first mounted, and the other was to grope  backward for the person who went to catch him after delivery of loading.    In the meantime, four horsemen, with three pack-horses, went by;  then two horse teams, loaded outward; then Stewart, of Kooltopa,  paused to give a few words of sympathy as he drove past; then far ahead,  we saw two wool teams, evidently from Boolka, converging slowly  toward the main track; then more wool came in sight from the pine-ridge,  five or six miles behind.  By this time, it was after mid-day; and Cooper,  having tied the last levers, looked round before descending from the load.    \"Somebody on a grey horse comin' along the track from the ram-paddick,  an' another (fellow) on a brown horse comin' across the plain,\" he remarked.  \"Wonder if one o' them's Martin-an' he's rose a horse at the station?\"    \"I was thinking about to-night,\" replied Thompson.  \"I'd forgot Martin.  Duffing soon comes under the what-you-may-call-him.\"    \"Statute of Limitations?\" I suggested.    \"Yes.  Come and have a drink of tea, and a bit of Cooper's pastry.  His cookery does n't fatten, but it fills up.\"    \"O you (adj.) liar,\" gently protested the Cornstalk, as he seated himself  on the ground beside the tucker-box.  \"Is this Martin?\"--for the man  on the grey horse was approaching at a canter.    \"No,\" I replied; \"he's a stranger to me.\"    \"But that's Martin on the brown horse,\" said Thompson, with rising vexation.  \"Keep him on a string, Tom, if you can.  Don't let him drive us into a lie  about last night, for, after all, I'll be hanged if I'm man enough  to tell him the truth, nor won't be for the next fortnight or three weeks.\"    By this time, the man on the grey horse was passing us.  In response to Thompson's invitation, he stopped and dismounted.    \"Jist help yourself, an' your friends'll like you the better,  as the sayin' is,\" said Cooper, handing him a pannikin.    \"Thanks.  I'll do so; I didn't have any breakfast this morning,\"  replied the stranger, picking up a johnny-cake (which liberal shepherds  give a grosser name), and eating it with relish, while the interior lamina  of dough spued out from between the charred crusts under the pressure  of his strong teeth.  \"Been having a little mishap?\"    \"Yes; nothing broke, though.\"    \"How long since my lads passed?  I see their tracks on the road.\"    \"About three hours,\" replied Thompson.  \"Did you meet an old man  and a young fellow, with wool-grey horse behind one of the wagons?  Good day, Mr. Martin.  Have a drink of tea?\"    \"Yes, I met them,\" replied the stranger.  \"Old Price's teams,  I think--Good day, Martin--six or seven miles from here;  Dixon travelling behind, with another fellow driving his team--  long-lost brother, apparently.\"    \"Where did you fellows have your bullocks last night?\" demanded Martin,  his eye resting on the sun-cracked stucco which covered three-fourths  of Damper's colossal personality.    \"And did you see a dark chestnut horse; bang tail; star and snip;  white hind feet; saddle and bridle on?\" I asked.  \"I ran across Moriarty  this morning,\" I continued, turning politely to Martin; \"and he told me  he was after a horse of that description; but he was in a hurry\"----    \"Dark chestnut horse; bang tail; star and snip; white hind feet;  JR near shoulder; like 2 in circle off thigh,\" said the stranger reflectively.   \"Yes; I saw the horse this morning, but the owner has got him again--  red-headed young fellow; tweed pants, strapped with moleskin. I met him  at the Nalrooka boundary shortly after sunrise--thirty miles from here,  I should say.  I was speaking to him.  He told me the horse had slung him  and got away from him last night, and he had found him by good luck  before daylight this morning.  He came down on his hand, poor beggar;  it's swelled like a boxing-glove.  But he's taking it out of the horse.\"    Now, in the Riverina of that period, it was considered much more disgraceful  to be had by a scoundrel than to commit a felony yourself;  therefore Martin, partly grasping the situation, assumed an oblivious,  and even drowsy, air.    \"Did the young fellow say where he was going?\" I asked,  pitying Martin's dilemma, and admiring his greatness of soul,  for I had more than once been there myself.    \"No; he only wanted to borrow a pipe of tobacco; but after we parted  I saw him strike out across the plain to the right.\"    Martin yawned, turned his horse, and rode slowly toward the selection.  Very slowly, so that the stranger might overtake him soon.  Come weal,  come woe, he would n't trail his honour in the dust before three cynical  onlookers.    \"Well, I'll push on,\" said the stranger, setting down his pannikin.  \"I want to pull my chaps, and I'm thinking about my horse.  I say\"--  glancing after Martin, and lowering his voice--\"you fellows have a devil  of a bad show for to-night.\"    \"You're right,\" replied Thompson.    \"Tell you what you'll do:  Camp at the belars, and they'll think  you're on for the ration-paddock; then, between the two lights,  just scoot for the Dead Horse Swamp.\"    \"Never any grass there,\" said Thompson.    \"That's the beauty of it,\" replied the stranger.  \"They've been putting down  a tank in the middle of the swamp this winter; and the contractor  had about a dozen young fellows, every one of them with a horse and a dog,  kicking up (sheol)'s delight.  There has n't been a smell of a sheep  within coo-ee of the swamp for the last three months; and the paddock  was mustered for shearing just before the contractor left.  It's into your hand for to-night.  Well, I must\"----    \"I beg your pardon,\" said Thompson hesitatingly--\"Are you coming  direct from Hay?\"    \"Well, I left on Saturday morning.\"    \"The mailman was telling me,\" continued Thompson wistfully,  \"that Permewan and Wright had three ton of dynamite for Broken Hill.  Do you know is it gone yet?\"    \"Not when I left,\" replied the Encyclopedia Australiensis.  \"They're offering eighty, and I've no doubt they'll spring to a hundred.  Extra-hazardous tack; and there's not a blade of grass once you pass  the Merowie.  Good day, boys.\" And, nodding to us collectively, he departed.    \"Steve,\" said I; \"are you a man to go fooling with high explosives,--  considering the thing that's on you?\"    \"Well,\" replied Thompson doggedly, \"it's come to this with me,  that I must make a spoon or spoil a horn; and if that infernal thing  would only keep off till I got the stuff delivered, I'd be right.  My bullocks are fit for any track in Australia.\"    \"Let's git down to Hay fust,\" interposed Cooper; \"then you can do as you like;  but I'll be wantin' a way-bill that'll take me safe out o' Port Phillip.  Say, Collins; I'll buy that new saddle off o' you.  Mine's all in splinters,  for my horse he's a beggar to roll.\"    \"I'd hardly feel justified in selling it,\" I replied.  \"But I'll tell you  what I'll do:  I'll sell you my own saddle cheap--say, three notes--  and give you Bum's bridle in.\"    Cooper agreed to the proposal.  Then, as Pup had been eating about ten pounds  of salt mutton, stolen from the bullock drivers' stores, I enticed him  to take a good drink of water, knowing he would need it before the day  was over.  It was absolutely imperative that I should go thirty miles,  and then, if possible, camp alone.  So I shook hands with the outlaws,  and started; leading Bunyip till he should become accustomed  to his new companion.    If the unmannerly reader wishes to know why I was bound to a stage  of exactly thirty miles, I have no objection to state that,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34736"],[0,"True Christianity (#16)"],[1,"7. The naked child is thus clothed with the mercy of God. He lifts up his  hands, receives all from God, and is made a partaker of grace and health,  truth and holiness. It is, therefore, this receiving of Christ in the  heart, that makes a man holy and happy.    8. Righteousness proceeds therefore solely from faith, and not from works.  Indeed, faith receives the whole Christ, and accepts him, together with  all that he has. Then sin and death, the devil and hell, must flee, and  are unable any longer to preserve their ground. Nay, so effectually and so  powerfully do the merits of Christ justify the sinner, that if the sins of  the whole world were charged on one man, they would not avail to condemn  him, if he believed in Christ.    9. Inasmuch, therefore, as Christ lives and dwells in thy heart by faith  (Eph. 3:17), never, O believer! indulge the thought, that his indwelling  in thee, is a dead work unattended with any vital power. Rather believe  that it is a quickening principle, a mighty work, and an effectual  transforming of thy mind. Faith effects two things: it first _engrafts_  thee into Christ, and gives him freely to thee, with all that he has; and  then, it _renews_ thee in Christ, that thou mayest grow, flourish, and  live in him. The wild graft is introduced into the stock, for no other end  than that it may flourish and bear fruit. As by the apostasy of Adam and  the temptation of the devil, the seed of the serpent was sown in man,  growing up into a tree and bearing the fruits of death; even so by the  divine word and the Holy Spirit, is faith sown in man, as the seed of God.  See Chap. II. In this seed all divine virtues and properties are, in a  most wonderful manner, comprehended; which gradually expand themselves  from day to day. This tree is adorned with a profusion of heavenly fruit;  as love, patience, humility, meekness, peace, chastity, righteousness. And  thus the whole kingdom of God descends into man. For true and saving faith  renews the whole man, purifies the heart, sanctifies the soul, and  delivers from the love of the world. It unites with God; it hungers and  thirsts after righteousness; it works love; and it brings peace, joy,  patience, and comfort in adversity: it overcomes the world; it makes us  sons of God, and heirs of the treasures of heaven; and it constitutes us  joint-heirs with the Lord Jesus Christ. But if any one should not be  conscious of that joyfulness which faith imparts and does not experience  its consoling influences, let him not, on that account, despair; but  rather let him trust in the grace which is promised in Christ: for this  promise ever remains sure, immovable, and everlasting. And though, through  the infirmities incident to human nature, he should stumble and fall; yet,  if the sinner return by unfeigned repentance, and more cautiously watch  against the sin which so easily besets him, the grace of God will not be  withdrawn. For Christ is and will ever be _Christ_ and a Saviour, whether  the faith that embraces him be strong or weak. A weak faith has an equal  share in Christ with a strong faith, for faith, whether it be weak or  strong, possesses the whole Christ. The grace which is promised is common  to all Christians, and is eternal, and on this grace faith must rely,  whether it be weak or strong. The Lord will revisit thy soul in his own  time, with a sense of his gracious favor, and of his abundant  consolations, although, at the present, he may think fit to put a veil  over it in thy heart. Ps. 37:23, 24; 77:7-10. Upon this subject, see Book  II.          Chapter VI.      Showing How The Vital Power Of The Word Of God Should Be Manifested In Man                                Through Faith.          _Behold, the kingdom of God is within you._--JOHN 17:21.      Inasmuch as man's whole welfare depends on his regeneration and renewal,  it was the will of God that all those changes which ought to take place in  man _spiritually_ and by faith, should be also _outwardly_ set forth in  the words of Holy Scripture. Since the Word is the seed of God (Luke 8:11)  within us, it is necessary that it should also spring up and spiritually  bear fruit. That must be accomplished _in us_ by faith, which is declared  _without us_ in the letter of Scripture; and if this effect be not  produced, then the Word is evidently to us but a dead seed, destitute of  life and energy. Hence, we ought in faith and in spirit to learn by our  own happy experience the truth of that which the Scriptures have outwardly  declared.    2. When God revealed his will in his Word, he never designed that the  latter should be a dead letter, but that it should grow up in us to a new  and inward man; otherwise the Word is of no benefit to us. These truths  may be explained more clearly by a reference to some example, as that of  Cain and Abel. The nature, manners, and actions of these two persons, as  they are recorded in Scripture, clearly explain the motions and workings  of the old and the new man in the breast of the believer. Cain perpetually  endeavors to oppress and destroy Abel. What else is this but the daily  strife of the flesh and spirit, and the enmity subsisting between the  serpent and the seed of the woman? With Abraham, the Christian is required  to quit his own country, leaving all that he possesses, even life itself,  in order that he may walk before God with a perfect heart, obtain the  victory, and enter into the land of promise and kingdom of heaven. Such is  the meaning of the Lord's words: \"If any man come to me, and hate not his  father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters,  yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple;\" that is, he must  renounce all these rather than renounce Christ. Luke 14:26. With Lot, he  must depart from Sodom and Gomorrah, forsaking the wicked course of the  world; not looking back with Lot's wife, but obeying Christ's injunction  (Luke 17:32), in order that his deliverance may be completed. Hither are  all the wars and battles of Israel against the heathen and infidel nations  to be referred; for what is represented under this history but the  continual strife between the flesh and the spirit? Whatsoever is recorded  of the Mosaical priesthood, the tabernacle, the ark of the covenant, or  the mercy-seat, with the sacrifices, etc.,--all has relation to the  Christian believer. For unto him it appertains to pray in spirit and in  truth; to burn spiritual incense; and to slay the sin-offering by  presenting his body, through mortification, as a reasonable service and  sacrifice, so that Christ may truly dwell in him by faith.    3. And if we advert to the New Testament itself, what is this but an  outward expression of those truths, which are to be inwardly fulfilled by  faith, in the experience of the believer? If I become a new creature in  Christ, it is incumbent on me to live and walk in him; in him and with  him, to flee into exile, and to be a stranger upon the earth. The virtues  that resided in him I ought to practise; humility, contempt of the world,  meekness, and patience; and I am bound to be fervent in acts of benignity,  charity, and loving kindness. In and with Christ I should exercise mercy,  and pardon and love my enemies, and, with him, do the Father's will. I  must be tempted by Satan with him; and, with him, I must obtain the  victory. I am to be derided, despised and vilified for the sake of the  truth that is in me; and, if called to it, I ought to die for and with  him, after the example of the saints, and in testimony that he, by faith,  hath lived in me, and I in him.    4. This is to be conformed to the image of Christ; this is to be born with  and in Christ; to put on Christ; to grow up and be strong in Christ; to  live with Christ in banishment; to be baptized with his baptism; to be  scoffed and crucified with him; to die with him; to be buried with him; to  rise with him from the dead; and to reign with him to all eternity.    5. If ever thou desirest to live in a constant union and conformity with  thy Head and Saviour, thou art in this manner to die daily with him, and  to crucify the flesh. Rom. 6:5, 6. Should this divine harmony not exist,  and another way be devised more consonant to thy fancy, then Christ will  not be _within_ but _without_ thee; far from thy faith, thy heart, and thy  spirit; and, in that case, he will profit thee nothing. But if thou permit  him to dwell in thy heart by faith, he will be thy strength, thy comfort,  and thy salvation.    6. All this, O man! doth faith in Christ effect within the heart; and thus  the Word of God becomes a living Word, and, as it were, a living witness  in us of all those things which are externally declared in the Scriptures.  Hence, faith is termed by the apostle a substance and an evidence, Heb.  11:1.    7. It is therefore evident, that all the sermons, discourses, and  epistles, contained in the Word of God, whether proceeding from Christ, or  the prophets, or the apostles; and, in a word, that all the Scriptures, in  general, as it regards their complete fulfilment, belong to man, and to  every man individually. Not only do the plain doctrines appertain to us;  but all the parables and miracles with which the history of Christ  abounds, have their final reference to man.    8. The purpose for which they were written was, that they might be  spiritually fulfilled in our own experience. When, therefore, I read that  Christ healed others, I promise myself the same relief; for we live in  unity one with another, Christ with me, and I with Christ. When I read  further, how he cured the blind, I am encouraged to believe that he will  restore me to the enjoyment of spiritual sight, who am blind by nature:  and so, with regard to all his other miracles. Only own thyself to be  blind, lame, deaf, or leprous; to be dead in trespasses and sins; and  then, he will surely heal thy maladies, and quicken that which"]]]
