The old male cells can be recognized by their position on the outer  edges and by their capacity, measuring on an average the same as a  column of sand 31 millimetres high in a glass tube 5 millimetres wide.  (1.21 x.195 inches.--Translator's Note.) These cells contain males of  the second or third generation and none but males. In the old female  cells, those in the middle, whose capacity is measured by a similar  column of sand 45 millimetres high (1.75 inches.--Translator's Note.),  are females and none but females.    This presence of both sexes at a time, even when there are but two cells  free, one spacious and the other small, proves in the plainest fashion  that the regular distribution observed in the complete nests of recent  production is here replaced by an irregular distribution, harmonizing  with the number and holding-capacity of the chambers to be stocked. The  Mason-bee has before her, let me suppose, only five vacant cells: two  larger and three smaller. The total space at her disposal would do for  about a third of the laying. Well, in the two large cells, she puts  females; in the three small cells, she puts males.    As we find the same sort of thing in all the old nests, we must needs  admit that the mother knows the sex of the egg which she is going to  lay, because that egg is placed in a cell of the proper capacity. We can  go further and admit that the mother alters the order of succession of  the sexes at her pleasure, because her layings, between one old nest and  another, are broken up into small groups of males and females according  to the exigencies of space in the actual nest which she happens to be  occupying.    Just now, in the new nest, we saw the Mason-bee arranging her total  laying into series first of females and next of males; and here she  is, mistress of an old nest of which she has not the power to alter the  arrangement, breaking up her laying into sections comprising both sexes  just as required by the conditions imposed upon her. She therefore  decides the sex of the egg at will, for, without this prerogative, she  could not, in the chambers of the nest which she owes to chance, deposit  unerringly the sex for which those chambers were originally built; and  this happens however small the number of chambers to be filled.    When the nest is new, I think I see a reason why the Mason-bee  should seriate her laying into females and then males. Her nest is  a half-sphere. That of the Mason-bee of the Shrubs is very nearly a  sphere. Of all shapes, the spherical shape is the strongest. Now these  two nests require an exceptional power of resistance. Without protection  of any kind, they have to brave the weather, one on its pebble, the  other on its bough. Their spherical configuration is therefore very  practical.    The nest of the Mason-bee of the Walls consists of a cluster of upright  cells backing against one another. For the whole to take a spherical  form, the height of the chambers must diminish from the centre of the  dome to the circumference. Their elevation is the sine of the meridian  arc starting from the plane of the pebble. Therefore, if they are to  have any solidity, there must be large cells in the middle and small  cells at the edges. And, as the work begins with the central chambers  and ends with those on the circumference, the laying of the females,  destined for the large cells, must precede that of the males, destined  for the small cells. So the females come first and the males at the  finish.    This is all very well when the mother herself founds the dwelling, when  she lays the first rows of bricks. But, when she is in the presence  of an old nest, of which she is quite unable to alter the general  arrangement, how is she to make use of the few vacant rooms, the large  and the small alike, if the sex of the egg be already irrevocably fixed?  She can only do so by abandoning the arrangement in two consecutive  rows and accommodating her laying to the varied exigencies of the home.  Either she finds it impossible to make an economical use of the old  nest, a theory refuted by the evidence, or else she determines at will  the sex of the egg which she is about to lay.    The Osmiae themselves will furnish the most conclusive evidence on the  latter point. We have seen that these Bees are not generally miners, who  themselves dig out the foundation of their cells. They make use of the  old structures of others, or else of natural retreats, such as hollow  stems, the spirals of empty shells and various hiding-places in walls,  clay or wood. Their work is confined to repairs to the house, such  as partitions and covers. There are plenty of these retreats; and the  insect would always find first-class ones if it thought of going any  distance to look for them. But the Osmia is a stay-at-home: she returns  to her birth-place and clings to it with a patience extremely difficult  to exhaust. It is here, in this little familiar corner, that she prefers  to settle her progeny. But then the apartments are few in number and of  all shapes and sizes. There are long and short ones, spacious ones and  narrow. Short of expatriating herself, a Spartan course, she has to use  them all, from first to last, for she has no choice. Guided by these  considerations, I embarked on the experiments which I will now describe.    I have said how my study, on two separate occasions, became a populous  hive, in which the Three-horned Osmia built her nests in the various  appliances which I had prepared for her. Among these appliances, tubes,  either of glass or reed, predominated. There were tubes of all lengths  and widths. In the long tubes, entire or almost entire layings, with a  series of females followed by a series of males, were deposited. As I  have already referred to this result, I will not discuss it again. The  short tubes were sufficiently varied in length to lodge one or other  portion of the total laying. Basing my calculations on the respective  lengths of the cocoons of the two sexes, on the thickness of the  partitions and the final lid, I shortened some of these to the exact  dimensions required for two cocoons only, of different sexes.    Well, these short tubes, whether of glass or reed, were seized upon as  eagerly as the long tubes. Moreover, they yielded this splendid result:  their contents, only a part of the total laying, always began with  female and ended with male cocoons. This order was invariable; what  varied was the number of cells in the long tubes and the proportion  between the two sorts of cocoons, sometimes males predominating and  sometimes females.    The experiment is of paramount importance; and it will perhaps make the  result clearer if I quote one instance from among a multitude of similar  cases. I give the preference to this particular instance because of  the rather exceptional fertility of the laying. An Osmia marked on the  thorax is watched, day by day, from the commencement to the end of her  work. From the 1st to the 10th of May, she occupies a glass tube in  which she lodges seven females followed by a male, which ends the  series. From the 10th to the 17th of May, she colonizes a second tube,  in which she lodges first three females and then three males. From the  17th to the 25th of May, a third tube, with three females and then two  males. On the 26th of May, a fourth tube, which she abandons, probably  because of its excessive width, after laying one female in it. Lastly,  from the 26th to the 30th of May, a fifth tube, which she colonizes  with two females and three males. Total: twenty-five Osmiae, including  seventeen females and eight males. And it will not be superfluous to  observe that these unfinished series do not in any way correspond with  periods separated by intervals of rest. The laying is continuous, in so  far as the variable condition of the atmosphere allows. As soon as one  tube is full and closed, another is occupied by the Osmia without delay.    The tubes reduced to the exact length of two cells fulfilled my  expectation in the great majority of cases: the lower cell was occupied  by a female and the upper by a male. There were a few exceptions.  More discerning than I in her estimate of what was strictly necessary,  better-versed in the economy of space, the Osmia had found a way of  lodging two females where I had only seen room for one female and a  male.    This experiment speaks volumes. When confronted with tubes too small to  receive all her family, she is in the same plight as the Mason-bee  in the presence of an old nest. She thereupon acts exactly as the  Chalicodoma does. She breaks up her laying, divides it into series as  short as the room at her disposal demands; and each series begins with  females and ends with males. This breaking up, on the one hand, into  sections in all of which both sexes are represented and the division, on  the other hand, of the entire laying into just two groups, one female,  the other male, when the length of the tube permits, surely provide us  with ample evidence of the insect's power to regulate the sex of the egg  according to the exigencies of space.    And besides the exigencies of space one might perhaps venture to add  those connected with the earlier development of the males. These burst  their cocoons a couple of weeks or more before the females; they are the  first who hasten to the sweets of the almond-tree. In order to release  themselves and emerge into the glad sunlight without disturbing the  string of cocoons wherein their sisters are still sleeping, they must  occupy the upper end of the row; and this, no doubt, is the reason that  makes the Osmia end each of her broken layings with males. Being next to  the door, these impatient ones will leave the home "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34211"],[0,"A Treatise on Physiology and Hygiene (#16)"],[1,"in the body, and, like flint, is capable of striking fire with steel. In  the interior of each tooth is a cavity, containing blood-vessels and a  nerve, which enter it through a minute opening at the point of the root  (Fig. 19).    [Sidenote: 7. The milk teeth? The permanent teeth?]    7. There are two sets of teeth; first, those belonging to the earlier years  of childhood, called the milk teeth, which are twenty in number and small.  At six or eight years of age, when the jaw expands, and when the growing  body requires a more powerful and numerous set, the roots of {83} the milk  teeth are absorbed, and the latter are \"shed,\" or fall out, one after  another (Fig. 18), to make room for the permanent set.    [Illustration: FIG. 18.--SECTION OF THE JAWS.    1' 2' 3' 4' 5', The Milk Teeth; 1\" to 8\", The Germs of the Permanent Set.]    [Sidenote: 8, 9. Number of teeth? How distributed?]    8. There are thirty-two teeth in the permanent set, as many being in one  jaw as the other. Each half-jaw has eight teeth, similarly shaped and  arranged in the same order: thus, two incisors, one canine, two bicuspids,  and three molars. The front teeth are small, sharp, and chisel-edged, and  are well adapted for cutting purposes; hence their name incisors. The  canines stand next, one on each side of the jaw; these receive their name  from their resemblance to the long, pointed tusks of the dog (Fig. 19).  {84}    [Illustration: FIG. 19.--SECTION OF THE JAWS--RIGHT SIDE.    V, A, N, Veins, Arteries, and Nerves of the Teeth. The root of one tooth in  each jaw is cut vertically to show the cavity and the blood-vessels, etc.,  within it. 1 to 8, Permanent Teeth.]    9. The bicuspids, next in order, are larger and have a broader crown than  the former; while behind them are the molars, the largest and most powerful  of the entire set. These large back teeth, or \"grinders,\" present a broad,  rough surface, suitable for holding and crushing the food. The third molar,  or \"wisdom tooth,\" is the last to be cut, and does not appear until about  the twenty-first year. {85} The order of arrangement of the teeth is  indicated by the following dental formula:--    [Illustration]    [Sidenote: 10. Different forms of teeth? Human teeth? The inference?]    10. It is interesting, at this point, to notice the different forms of  teeth in different animals, and observe how admirably their teeth are  suited to the respective kinds of food upon which they subsist. In the  _carnivora_, or flesh-feeders, the teeth are sharp and pointed, enabling  them both to seize their prey, and tear it in pieces; while the  _herbivora_, or vegetable-feeders, have broad, blunt teeth, with rough  crowns, suitable for grinding the tough grasses and grains upon which they  feed. Human teeth partake of both forms; some of them are sharp, and others  are blunt; they are therefore well adapted for the mastication of both  flesh and vegetables. Hence we argue that, although man may live  exclusively upon either vegetable or animal food, he should, when possible,  choose a diet made up of both varieties.    [Sidenote: 11. Cleaning of teeth? Effects of not cleaning?]    11. PRESERVATION OF THE TEETH.--In order that the teeth shall remain in a  sound and serviceable condition, some care is of course requisite. In the  first place, they require frequent cleansing; for every time we take food,  some particles of it remain in the mouth; and these, on account of the heat  and moisture present, soon begin to putrefy. This not only renders the  breath very offensive, but promotes decay of the teeth. {86}    [Sidenote: 12. Effects upon the saliva? Formation of tartar? How prevented?  How destroyed?]    12. The saliva, or moisture of the mouth, undergoes a putrefactive change,  and becomes the fertile soil in which a certain minute fungus has its  growth. This fluid, too, if allowed to dry in the mouth, collects upon the  teeth in the form of an unsightly, yellow concretion, called tartar. To  prevent this formation, and to remove other offensive substances, the teeth  should be frequently cleaned with water, applied by means of a soft  tooth-brush. The destruction of the tartar fungus is best effected by the  use of a weak solution of carbolic acid.    [Sidenote: 13. Destruction of the enamel? How guarded against?]    13. Again, it should be borne in mind that the enamel, Nature's protection  for the teeth, when once destroyed, is not formed anew; and the body of the  tooth thus exposed, is liable to rapid decay. On this account, certain  articles are to be guarded against; such as sharply acid substances that  corrode the enamel, and hard substances that break or scratch it--as gritty  tooth powders, metal tooth picks, and the shells of hard nuts. Sudden  alternations from heat to cold, when eating or drinking, also tend to crack  the enamel.    [Sidenote: 14. Mixing of food with the saliva? What is the saliva? How  secreted? The salivary glands?]    14. INSALIVATION.--When the morsel of food is cut and ground by the teeth,  it is at the same time also intimately mixed with the saliva, or fluids of  the mouth. This constitutes the second step of digestion, and is called  insalivation. The saliva, the first of the digestive solvents, is a  colorless, watery, and frothy fluid. It is secreted (_i. e._ separated from  the blood) partly by the mucous membrane which lines the mouth; but chiefly  by the salivary glands, of which there are three pairs situated near the  mouth.    [Sidenote: 15. The flow of saliva? The thought of food? Anxiety and grief?  Animals fed upon dry and coarse food?]    {87} 15. These glands consist of clusters of very small pouches, around  which a delicate network of blood-vessels is arranged: they empty into the  mouth by means of little tubes, or ducts. The flow from these glands is at  all times sufficient to maintain a soft and moist condition of the tongue  and mouth; but when they are excited by the presence and taste of food,  they pour forth the saliva more freely. Even the mere thought of food will  at times cause the saliva to flow, as when the appetite is stimulated by  the sight or smell of some savory article; so that the common expression is  correct that \"the mouth waters\" for the favorite articles of food. Anxiety  and grief prevent its flow, and cause \"the tongue to cleave to the roof of  the mouth.\" In the horse and other animals, that feed upon dry and coarse  fodder, and require an abundant supply of saliva, we find large salivary  glands, as well as powerful muscles of mastication.    [Illustration: FIG. 20.--STRUCTURE OF A SALIVARY GLAND.]    [Illustration: FIG. 21.--THE HEAD OF A HORSE, showing the large salivary  gland (_a_), its duct (_b_), the muscles of mastication (_c_, _d_, _e_,  _f_, and _g_).]    [Sidenote: 16. Importance of the process? The first place? The second? The  third?]    16. The mingling of the saliva with the food seems a simple process, but it  is one that plays an important part {88} in digestion. In the first place,  it facilitates the motions of mastication, by moistening the food and  lubricating the various organs of the mouth. Secondly, it prepares the way  for other digestive acts: by the action of the teeth, the saliva is forced  into the solid food, softens the harder substances, and assists in  converting the whole morsel into a semi-solid, pulpy mass, that can be  easily swallowed, and readily permeated by other digestive fluids. The  saliva also, by dissolving certain substances, as sugar and salt, develops  the peculiar taste of each; whereas, if the tongue be dry and coated, they  are tasteless. Hence, if substances are insoluble, they are devoid of  taste.    [Sidenote: 17. Its final importance? Starch? How effected? Ptyalin?]    17. Finally, the saliva has the property of acting chemically upon the  food. As we have before stated (Chap. IV.), starch, as starch, cannot enter  the tissues of the body; but, in order to become nutriment, must first be  changed to grape sugar. This change is, in part, effected by the saliva,  and takes place almost instantly, whenever it comes in contact with cooked  starch. This important function is due to an organic ingredient of the  saliva called _ptyalin_. This substance has been extracted from the saliva  by the chemist, and has been found, by experiment, to convert into sugar  two thousand times its own weight of starch.    [Sidenote: 18. Each of the processes? Why is a knowledge of the digestive  functions important? How shown?]    18. IMPORTANCE OF MASTICATION AND INSALIVATION.--Each of these processes  complements the other, and makes the entire work available; for, by their  joint action, they prepare the food in the best possible manner for further  digestive changes. The knowledge of these preliminary functions will appear  the more important, when we reflect that they are the only ones which we  can regulate by the will. For, as soon as the act of swallowing begins, the  food not only passes out of sight, but beyond {89} control; and the  subsequent acts of digestion are consequently involuntary and unconsciously  performed.    [Sidenote: 19. Rapid eating? Describe the process and effects.]    19. It is generally known that rapid eating interferes with digestion. How  does this occur? In the first place, in rapid eating, the flow of the  saliva is insufficient to moisten the solid parts of the food, so that they  remain too hard and dry to be easily swallowed. This leads to the free and  frequent use of water, or some other beverage, at meals, to \"wash down\" the  food,--a most pernicious practice. For these fluids, not only cannot take  the place of the natural digestive juices, but, on the contrary, dilute and  weaken them.    [Sidenote: 20. Loss of taste? Another effect of rapid eating? Mistakes?]    20. Secondly, the saliva being largely the medium of the sense of taste,  the natural flavors of the food are not developed, and consequently it"]]]
