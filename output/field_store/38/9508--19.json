During nearly two years Arras was subjected to the  arbitrary examinations and tortures of the inquisitors; and  an appeal to the Parliament of Paris could alone stop the  proceedings, 1461. The chance of acquittal by the verdict of the  public was little: it was still less by the sentence of judicial  tribunals.      [72] The 'Osculum in tergo' seems to be an indispensable    part of the Homagium or _Diabolagium_.          PART III.    MODERN FAITH.          CHAPTER I.         The Bull of Innocent VIII.--A new Incentive to the vigorous       Prosecution of Witchcraft--The 'Malleus Maleficarum'--Its       Criminal Code--Numerous Executions at the Commencement of       the Sixteenth Century--Examination of Christian       Demonology--Various Opinions of the Nature of       Demons--General Belief in the Intercourse of Demons and       other non-human Beings with Mankind.      Perhaps the most memorable epoch in the annals of witchcraft is  the date of the promulgation of the bull of Pope Innocent VIII.,  when its prosecution was formally sanctioned, enforced, and  developed in the most explicit manner by the highest authority in  the Church. It was in the year 1484 that Innocent VIII. issued  his famous bull directed especially against the crime in Germany,  whose inquisitors were empowered to seek out and burn the  malefactors _pro strigiatus haeresi_. The bull was as follows:  'Innocent, Bishop, servant of the servants of God, in order to  the future memorial of the matter.... In truth it has come to our  ears, not without immense trouble and grief to ourselves, that  in some parts of Higher Germany ... very many persons of both  sexes, deviating from the Catholic faith, abuse themselves with  the demons, Incubus and Succubus; and by incantations, charms,  conjurations, and other wicked _superstitions_, by criminal acts  and offences have caused the offspring of women and of the lower  animals, the fruits of the earth, the grape, and the products of  various plants, men, women, and other animals of different kinds,  vineyards, meadows, pasture land, corn, and other vegetables of  the earth, to perish, be oppressed, and utterly destroyed; that  they torture men and women with cruel pains and torments,  internal as well as external; that they hinder the proper  intercourse of the sexes, and the propagation of the human  species. Moreover, they are in the habit of denying the very  faith itself. We therefore, willing to provide by opportune  remedies according as it falls to us by our office, by our  apostolical authority, by the tenor of these presents do appoint  and decree that they be convicted, imprisoned, punished, and  mulcted according to their offences.... By the apostolic rescript  given at Rome.'    This, in brief, is an outline of the proclamation of Innocent  VIII., the principles of which were developed in the more  voluminous work of the 'Malleus Maleficarum,'[73] or Hammer of  Witches, five years later. In the interval, the effect of so  forcible an appeal from the Head of the Church was such as might  be expected. Cumanus, one of the inquisitors in 1485, burned  forty-one witches, first shaving them to search for 'marks.'  Alciatus, a lawyer, tells us that another ecclesiastical officer  burned one hundred witches in Piedmont, and was prevented in his  plan of daily _autos-da-fe_ only by a general uprising of the  people, who at length drove him out of the country, when the  archbishop succeeded to the vacant office. In several provinces,  even the servile credulity of the populace could not tolerate the  excesses of the judges; and the inhabitants rose _en masse_  against their inquisitorial oppressors, dreading the entire  depopulation of their neighbourhood. As a sort of apology for the  bull of 1484 was published the 'Malleus'--a significantly  expressive title.[74] The authors appointed by the pope were  Jacob Sprenger, of the Order of Preachers, and Professor of  Theology in Cologne; John Gremper, priest, Master in Arts; and  Henry Institor. The work is divisible, according to the title,  into three parts--Things that pertain to Witchcraft; The Effects  of Witchcraft; and The Remedies for Witchcraft.      [73] Ennemoser (_History of Magic_), a modern and milder    Protestant, excepts to the general denunciations of Pope    Innocent ('who assumed this name, undoubtedly, because he    wished it to indicate what he really desired to be') by    Protestant writers who have used such terms as 'a scandalous    hypocrite,' 'a cursed war-song of hell,' 'hangmen's slaves,'    'rabid jailers,' 'bloodthirsty monsters,' &c.; and thinks    that 'the accusation which was made against Innocent could    only have been justly founded if the pope had not    participated in the general belief, if he had been wiser    than his time, and really seen that the heretics were no    allies of the devil, and that the witches were no heretics.'      [74] The complete title is 'MALLEUS MALEFICARUM in tres    partes divisus, in quibus I. Concurrentia ad maleficia; II.    Maleficiorum effectus; III. Remedia adversus maleficia. Et    modus denique procedendi ac puniendi maleficas abunde    continetur, praecipue autem omnibus inquisitoribus et divini    verbi concionatoribus utilis et necessarius.' The original    edition of 1489 is the one quoted by Hauber, _Bibliotheca    Mag._, and referred to by Ennemoser, _History of Magic_.    In this apology the editors are careful to affirm that they  _collected_, rather than _furnished_, their materials originally,  and give as their venerable authorities the names of Dionysius  the Areopagite, Chrysostom, Hilary, Augustin, Gregory I.,  Remigius, Thomas Aquinas, and others. The writers exult in the  consciousness of security, in spite of the attempts of the  demons, day and night, to deter them from completing their  meritorious labours. Stratagems of every sort are employed in  vain. In their judgment the worst species of human wickedness  sink into nothing, compared with apostasy from the Church and, by  consequence, alliance with hell. A genuine or pretended dread of  sorcery, and an affected contempt for the female sex, with an  extremely low estimate of its virtues (adopting the language of  the Fathers), characterises the opinions of the compilers.    Ennemoser has made an abstract from the 'Demonomagie' of Horst  (founded on Hauber's original work), of the 'Hexenhammer,' under  its three principal divisions. The third part, which contains the  Criminal Code, and consists of thirty-five questions, is the most  important section. It is difficult to decide which is the more  astonishing, the perfect folly or the perfect iniquity of the  Code: it is easier to understand how so many thousands of victims  were helplessly sacrificed. The arrest might take place on the  simple rumour of a witch being found somewhere, without any  previous denunciation. The most abandoned and the most infamous  persons may be witnesses: no criminal is too bad. Even a witch or  heretic (the _worst_ criminal in the eye of ecclesiastical law)  is capable of giving evidence. Husbands and wives may witness one  against the other; and the testimony of children was received as  good evidence.    The ninth and tenth chapters consider the question 'whether a  defence was to be allowed; if an advocate defended his client  beyond what was requisite, whether it was not reasonable that he  too should be considered guilty; for he is a patron of witches  and heretics.... Thirteenth chapter: What the judge has to notice  in the torture-chamber. Witches who have given themselves up for  years, body and soul, to the devil, are made by him so insensible  to pain on the rack, that they rather allow themselves to be torn  to pieces than confess. Fourteenth chapter: Upon torture and the  mode of racking. In order to bring the accused to voluntary  confession, you may promise her her life; which promise, however,  may afterwards be withdrawn. If the witch does not confess the  first day, the torture to be continued the second and third days.  But here the difference between continuing and repeating is  important. The torture may not be _continued_ without fresh  evidence, but it may be _repeated_ according to judgment.  Fifteenth chapter: Continuance of the discovery of a witch by her  marks. Amongst other signs, weeping is one. It is a damning thing  if the accused, on being brought up, cannot shed tears. The  clergy and judges lay their hands on the head of the accused, and  adjure her by the hot tears of the Most Glorified Virgin that in  case of her innocence, she shed abundant tears in the name of God  the Father.'[75]      [75] Ennemoser's _History of Magic_. Translated by W.    Howitt. There are three kinds of men whom witchcraft cannot    touch--magistrates; clergymen exercising the pious rites of    the Church; and saints, who are under the immediate    protection of the angels.    The 'Bull' and 'Malleus' were the code and textbook of Witchcraft  amongst the Catholics, as the Act and 'Demonologie' of James VI.  were of the Protestants. Perhaps the most important result of the  former was to withdraw entirely the authorised prosecution and  punishment of the criminals from the civil to the ecclesiastical  tribunals. Formerly they had a divided jurisdiction. At the  same time the fury of popular and judicial fanaticism was  greatly inflamed by this new sanction. Immediately, and almost  simultaneously, in different parts of Europe, heretical witches  were hunted up, tortured, burned, or hanged; and those parts of  the Continent most infected with the widening heresy suffered  most. The greater number in Germany seems to show that the  dissentients from Catholic dogma there were rapidly increasing,  some time before Luther thundered out his denunciations.
