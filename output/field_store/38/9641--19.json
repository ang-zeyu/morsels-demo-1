The  undifferentiated stage is followed by the third stage, in which the  contrectation impulse becomes differentiated, so that in normal  individuals the sexual impulse becomes unmistakably heterosexual.  Normally, this differentiated stage endures until the time of the final  extinction of the sexual impulse.    I do not believe that an undifferentiated stage occurs in every one  without exception. On the other hand, I have absolutely no doubt that it  occurs very frequently indeed--far more frequently than is commonly  believed--and that it occurs in persons whose subsequent sexual  development is perfectly normal. Moreover, during the undifferentiated  stage, in addition to heterosexual and homosexual inclinations, perverse  sentiments may make their appearance. Masochistic, sadistic, fetichistic  excitations of all kinds are met with, and sexual inclination towards  animals is by no means rare. As regards the last named, the inclination  is directed especially towards the animals with which the child is most  intimately associated, as, for instance, a dog, a cat, a bird, a horse,  and the like. Again, during the period of undifferentiated sexual  impulse all kinds of disordered ideas may become associated with that  impulse; for instance, an impulse may arise to touch the saliva, or some  other excretory product, of the beloved being, human or animal, as the  case may be, and even to take such a product into the mouth. Many  persons completely forget all these manifestations of the  undifferentiated sexual impulse which have formed part of their own  early experiences. The causes of such oblivion have been discussed in  the first chapter (p. 5).    Yet another reason may be mentioned for regarding a knowledge of the  undifferentiated stage of the sexual impulse as of great importance. In  works on the pathology of the sexual impulse we are frequently assured  that in this or that specific instance the perversion was inborn,  because perverse sensations have existed since the days of childhood.  But the existence of the undifferentiated stage teaches us that we are  not justified in inferring, from the mere fact of the primary occurrence  of a \"perverse\" mode of sexual sensibility, that this perversion is  congenital; for the primary direction of the contrectation impulse  during the undifferentiated stage often depends to a considerably  greater extent upon chance than upon an inherited predisposition.    The undifferentiated stage begins at very various ages. I have known  instances in which it could be traced back to the fifth, year of life. I  regard it as probable, however, that it may begin even earlier than  this. But more commonly it begins somewhat later; not infrequently at  the age of seven or eight, and very often at the age of nine or ten  years. As previously mentioned, I do not maintain that an  undifferentiated stage is of universal occurrence. When such a stage is  absent, the symptoms of the differentiated sexual impulse often make  their appearance at the age at which in other cases the undifferentiated  stage of the impulse usually begins. In the case of a large number of  men, inquiry will show that at the age of nine or ten they began to  experience an inclination towards persons of the female sex; in a good  many this occurs even at the age of eight, and in a few yet earlier; as  regards women, _mutatis mutandis_, the same conditions obtain. In cases  in which an undifferentiated stage is well marked, its duration is  likewise very variable. In isolated instances it lasts until the age of  twenty, or even a few years longer. Ordinarily, however, the  differentiation of the impulse becomes manifest at an earlier  age--between the ages of fifteen and seventeen years. Beyond question,  in the great majority of cases, the \"perverse\" sentiments of childhood  subsequently disappear spontaneously. But when I come to discuss sexual  perversions in detail, I shall point out that this disappearance, in  certain circumstances, fails to occur.    I take this opportunity of referring to a beautiful example of the  undifferentiated sexual impulse which is found in _Wilhelm Meisters  Wanderjahren_. In the twelfth chapter of the second book, Wilhelm  describes \"one of the earliest incidents of his youth\":--\"The elder of  these boys, a year or two my own senior, the son of the fisherman,  seemed to take no pleasure in this sport with flowers. This boy, by whom  at his first appearance I had been greatly attracted, invited me to go  with him to the river, a fairly wide stream which flowed past at a  little distance. We sat side by side in a shady spot with our  fishing-rods.... As we sat there quietly, leaning towards one another,  he seemed to grow rather weary of our inaction, and he drew my attention  to a flat stretch of gravel which extended from our feet beneath the  surface of the water. This would be a fine place to bathe. At last,  jumping to his feet, he cried out that the chance was too good to be  missed, and almost before I realised his intention, he had stripped, and  was in the water. Being a good swimmer, he soon left the shallows, swam  across the stream, and then back again into the deep water near the bank  on which I was sitting. My own mood was a strange one. Grasshoppers  danced round about me, ants crawled to and fro, many-coloured beetles  hung from the twigs, and brilliant dragon flies hovered in the air; my  companion caught sight of a great crayfish, flashing merrily out from  its hole beneath the roots overhanging the water, and cleverly eluding  an attempt to seize it by darting back into its lair. The air was so  warm and moist; in the sunshine one longed for the shade, and even in  the coolness of the shade one longed for the still greater coolness of  the water. Thus it was easy for him to entice me into the stream; his  invitation, once or twice repeated, proved irresistible, notwithstanding  my fear of a scolding from my parents, mingled with some dread of the  unknown element. Soon I undressed upon the gravelly bank, and ventured  gently into the water, not too far down the gradually shelving bank;  here he let me wait awhile, swimming out himself across the stream; then  he returned to my side, and as he left the water, standing upright, to  dry himself in the bright sunshine, it seemed to me that my eyes must be  dazzled by the power of the sun, so blindingly beautiful was the human  form--far more beautiful than I had ever before imagined. He seemed to  look at me with equal attention. Dressing quickly, we stood beside each  other with all barriers broken down, our spirits were drawn closely  together, and with ardent kisses we swore eternal friendship.\"    Groos rightly sees in this passage a delicate intimation of sexual  sensibility. A little later we read how Wilhelm, having made an  appointment with this boy to meet him one evening in the forest,  encounters a young girl, a little younger than himself. \"Spring flowers  of all kinds were growing in the beautifully adorned fields, among the  grass, and along the hedges. My companion was beautiful, blond, gentle;  we walked trustingly side by side, each holding the other by the hand,  and seeming to wish for nothing better in the world.... When, after the  lapse of so many years, I look back upon my former state, it seems to me  to have been a truly enviable one. Unexpectedly, in the same instant, I  experienced the sentiments of friendship and of love; for as I  unwillingly took leave of the beautiful child, I was consoled by the  thought of explaining these ideas to my young boy-friend, by the  prospect of confiding in him, and of rejoicing in his participation in  these newly discovered sentiments.\"    The following description of the period of the undifferentiated sexual  impulse has been placed at my disposal:--    CASE 1.--X. is now thirty-four years of age, happily married, with  several healthy children. He is himself a thoroughly healthy man, with  normal impulses, and free from all bodily and mental abnormality. His  description of the period of the undifferentiated sexual impulse may  best be given in his own words. \"At the age of nine, when I was still  living in the country, and was being educated by a private tutor, a  passionate affection for him took possession of me. Generally speaking,  he was good-natured and indulgent, but was at times strict, I used my  utmost endeavours to be near him as much as possible. I was happy when  he touched me. Gradually this inclination increased; everything that he  had touched, everything that he had warmed with his body, I also wished  to touch. If he had drunk from a glass, I secretly drank from it myself,  so that my lips might touch the very spot where his had rested. At the  age of ten I began to attend the public school in the town, I sat beside  a fellow-pupil who, like myself, came from the country. Soon I conceived  a fondness for him. He was not only my playmate, I wished always that we  should do our work together; whenever he had any other companion than  myself, I was profoundly unhappy. Was this jealousy? I believe it was.  When he left the school--it must have been about a year after I had  entered--I was at first very unhappy, but my fondness for him was soon  replaced by a passion for his sister, a girl about twelve years of age.  I had made her acquaintance through so often working with her brother,  and through visiting his parents' house. She was a pretty girl. At  first, after my friend had departed, I went to the house occasionally,  in order to hear some news of him, and of his doings in the school  abroad to which he had been sent. In the house that had been his home I  had also an indefinite feeling that I was near him once again. But  gradually my liking for his sister grew, and I was glad that her parents  gave me"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28434"],[0,"The Astronomy of Milton's 'Paradise Lost' (#16)"],[1,"to move with irregularity: sometimes a planet was observed to advance,  then become stationary, and afterwards affect a retrograde movement.  Those inequalities of motion could not be explained by means of the  revolution of crystalline spheres alone, but were accounted for by  imagining the existence of a small circle, or epicycle, whose centre  corresponded with a fixed point in the larger circle, or eccentric, as  it was called. This small circle revolved on its axis when carried round  with the larger one, and round it the planet also revolved, which when  situated in its outer portion would have a forward, and when in its  inner portion a retrograde, motion.    The theory of eccentrics and epicycles was sufficient for a time to  account for the inequalities of motion already described, and by this  means the Ptolemaic system was enabled to retain its ascendency for a  longer period than it otherwise would have done. But more recent  discoveries brought to light discrepancies and difficulties which were  explained away by adding epicycle to epicycle. This created a most  complicated entanglement, and hastened the downfall of a system which,  after an existence of many centuries, sank into oblivion, and is now  remembered as a belief of bygone ages.    The devices which the upholders of this system were compelled to adopt,  in order 'to save appearances,' with 'centric and eccentric,' cycle and  epicycle, 'orb in orb,' are in this manner appropriately described by  Milton, as indicating the confusion arising from a theory based upon  false hypotheses.    Continuing his reply, the Angel says:--        Already by thy reasoning this I guess,      Who art to lead thy offspring, and supposest      That bodies bright and greater should not serve      The less not bright, nor Heaven such journies run,      Earth sitting still, when she alone receives      The benefit. Consider, first, that great      Or bright infers not excellence. The Earth,      Though, in comparison of Heaven, so small,      Nor glistering, may of solid good contain      More plenty than the Sun that barren shines,      Whose virtue on itself works no effect,      But in the fruitful Earth; there first received,      His beams, inactive else, their vigour find,      Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries      Officious, but to thee, Earth's habitant.      And, for the Heaven's wide circuit, let it speak      The Maker's high magnificence, who built      So spacious, and his line stretched out so far,      That Man may know he dwells not in his own--      An edifice too large for him to fill,      Lodged in a small partition; and the rest      Ordained for uses to his Lord best known,      The swiftness of those Circles attribute,      Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,      That to corporeal substances could add      Speed almost spiritual. Me thou think'st not slow,      Who since the morning-hour set out from Heaven      Where God resides, and ere midday arrived      In Eden--distance inexpressible      By numbers that have name. But this I urge,      Admitting motion in the Heavens, to show      Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved;      Not that I so affirm, though so it seem      To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.      God, to remove his ways from human sense,      Placed Heaven from Earth so far, that earthly sight,      If it presume, might err in things too high,      And no advantage gain.--viii. 85-122.    Notwithstanding the Angel's severe criticism of the Ptolemaic system, he  does not unreservedly support the conclusions arrived at by Adam, but  endeavours to show that his reasoning may not be altogether correct. He  questions the validity of his argument that bodies of greater size and  brightness should not serve the smaller, though not bright, and that  heaven should move, while the Earth remained at rest. He argues that  great or bright infers not excellence, and that the Earth, though small,  may contain more virtue than the Sun, that 'barren shines,' whose beams  create no beneficial effect, except when directed on the fruitful  Earth. He reminds Adam that those bright luminaries minister not to the  Earth, but to himself, 'Earth's habitant,' and directs his attention to  the magnificence and extent of the surrounding universe, of which he  occupies but a small portion. The diurnal swiftness of the orbs that  move round the Earth he attributes to God's omnipotence, that to  material bodies 'could add speed almost spiritual.'    The Angel, after alluding to his rapid flight through space, suggests  that God placed heaven so far from Earth that man might not presume to  inquire into things which it would be of no advantage for him to know.  He then suddenly changes to the Copernican system, which he lucidly  describes in the following lines:--                                  What if the Sun      Be centre to the World, and other stars      By his attractive virtue and their own      Incited, dance about him various rounds?      Their wandering course, now high, now low, then hid,      Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,      In six thou seest; and what if, seventh to these      The planet Earth, so steadfast though she seem,      Insensibly three different motions move?      Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe,      Moved contrary with thwart obliquities,      Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift      Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed      Invisible else above all stars, the wheel      Of day and night; which needs not thy belief,      If Earth, industrious of herself, fetch day      Travelling east, and with her part averse      From the Sun's beam meet night, her other part      Still luminous by his ray. What if that light,      Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air,      To the terrestrial Moon be as a star,      Enlightening her by day, as she by night      This Earth--reciprocal, if land be there,      Fields and inhabitants? Her spots thou seest      As clouds, and clouds may rain, and rain produce      Fruits in her softened soil, for some to eat      Allotted there; and other Suns, perhaps,      With their attendant Moons, thou wilt descry,      Communicating male and female light--      Which two great sexes animate the World,      Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live.      For such vast room in Nature unpossessed      By living soul, desert and desolate,      Only to shine, yet scarce to contribute      Each orb a glimpse of light, conveyed so far      Down to this habitable, which returns      Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.--viii. 122-58.    The Copernican theory, which is less complicated and more easily  understood than the Ptolemaic, is described by Milton with accuracy and  methodical skill.    The Sun having been assigned that central position in the system which  his magnitude and importance claim as his due, the planets circling in  orbits around him have their motions described in a manner indicative of  the precise knowledge which Milton acquired of this theory. At this time  the law of gravitation was unknown, and, although the ellipticity of the  orbits of the planets had been discovered by Kepler, the nature of the  motive force which guided and retained them in their paths still  remained a mystery. It was believed that the planets were whirled round  the Sun, as if by the action of magnetic fibres; a mutual attractive  influence having been supposed to exist between them and the orb,  similar to that of the opposite poles of magnets.    Milton alludes to this theory in the following lines:--                                They, as they move      Their starry dance in numbers that compute      Days, months, and years, towards his all-cheering lamp      Turn swift their various motions, or are turned      By his magnetic beam.--iii. 579-83.    An important advance upon this theory was made by Horrox, who, in his  study of celestial dynamics, attributed the curvilineal motion of the  planets to the influence of two forces, one projective, the other  attractive. He illustrated this by observing the path described by a  stone when thrown obliquely into the air. He perceived that its motion  was governed by the impulse imparted to it by the hand, and also by the  attractive force of the Earth. Under these two influences, the stone  describes a graceful curve, and in its descent falls at the same angle  at which it rose. Hence arises the general law: 'When two spheres are  mutually attracted, and if not prevented by foreign influences, their  straight paths are deflected into curves concave to each other, and  corresponding with one of the sections of a cone, according to the  velocity of the revolving body. If the velocity with which the revolving  body is impelled be equal to what it would acquire by falling through  half the radius of a circle described from the centre of deflection, its  orbit will be circular; but if it be less than that quantity, its path  becomes elliptical.'    Newton afterwards embraced this law in his great principle of  gravitation, and demonstrated that the force which guides and retains  the Earth and planets in their orbits resides in the Sun. By the orb's  attractive influence a planet, after having received its first impulse,  is deflected from its original straight path, and bent towards that  luminary, and by the combined action of the projective and attractive  forces is made to describe an orbit which, if elliptical, has one of its  foci occupied by the Sun. So evenly balanced are those two forces, that  one is unable to gain any permanent ascendency over the other, and  consequently the planet traverses its orbit with unerring regularity,  and, if undisturbed by external influences, will continue in its path  for all time.    Milton describes the position of the planets in the sky as--        Now high, now low, then hid;    and their motions--        Progressive, retrograde,"]]]
