He found the  substance of it in an old legend, which dates from the 16th century.  The flying Dutchman is a sort of wandering Jew, condemned to sail  forever on the seas, until he has found a woman, whose love to him is  faithful unto death.    In the first act we find ourselves on the high seas.  Daland, a  Norwegian skipper, has met with {85} several misfortunes on his way  home, and is compelled to anchor on a deserted shore.  There he finds  the flying Dutchman, who vainly roves from sea to sea to find death and  with it peace.  His only hope is dooms day.  He has never found a  maiden faithful to him, and he knows not how often and how long he has  vainly tried to be released from his doom.  Once, every seven years, he  is allowed to go on shore, and take a wife.  This time has now come  again, and hearing from Daland, that he has a daughter, sweet and pure,  he begins to hope once more, and offers all his wealth to the father  for a shelter under the Norwegian's roof and for the hand of his  daughter Senta.--Daland is only too glad to accept for his child, what  to him seems an immense fortune and so they sail home together.    In the second act we find Senta in the spinning-room.  The servants of  the house are together spinning and singing.  Senta is amongst them,  but her wheel does not turn, she is dreamily regarding an old picture.  It is that of the flying Dutchman, whose legend so deeply touches her,  that she has grown to love its hero, without having in reality seen him.    Senta has a wooer already in the person of Erick the hunter, but she  does not care much for him.  With deep feeling she sings to the  spinning maidens the ballad of the doomed man, as she has heard it from  Mary, her nurse:    An old captain wanted to sail round the Cape {86} of Good Hope, and as  the wind was against him, he swore a terrible oath, that he never would  leave off trying.  The devil heard him and doomed him to sail on to  eternity, but God's angel had pity on him and showed him, how he could  find deliverance through a wife, faithful unto the grave.    All the maidens pray to God, to let the maiden be found at last, when  Senta ecstatically exclaims: \"I will be his wife!\"  At this moment her  father's ship is announced.  Senta is about to run away to welcome him,  but is detained by Erick, who tries to win her for himself.  She  answers evasively; then Daland enters and with him a dark and gloomy  stranger.  Senta stands spell-bound: she recognizes the hero of her  picture.  The Dutchman is not less impressed, seeing in her the angel  of his dreams and as it were his deliverer, and so, meeting by the  guidance of a superior power, they seem created for each other and  Senta, accepting the offer of his hand, swears to him eternal fidelity.    In the third act we see the flying Dutchman's ship; everybody  recognizes it by its black mast and its blood-red sail.  The Norwegian  sailors call loudly to the marines of the strange ship, but nothing  stirs, everything seems dead and haunted.  At last the unearthly  inhabitants of the Dutch ship awake; they are old and gray and  wrinkled, all doomed to the fate of their captain.  They begin a wild  and gloomy song, which sends a chill into the hearts of the stout  Norwegians.    {87}    Meanwhile Erick, beholding in Senta the betrothed of the Dutchman, is  in despair.  Imploring her to turn back, he calls up old memories and  at last charges her with infidelity to him.    As soon as the Dutchman hears this accusation, he turns from Senta,  feeling that he is again lost.  But Senta will not break her faith.  Seeing the Dutchman fly from her, ready to sail away, she swiftly runs  after him and throws herself from the cliff into the waves.    By this sacrifice the spell is broken, the ghostly ship sinks for ever  into the ocean, and an angel bears the poor wanderer to eternal rest,  where he is re-united to the bride, who has proved faithful unto death.          THE FOLKUNGS.    Grand Opera in five acts by EDMUND KRETSCHMER.    Text by MOSENTHAL.      The composer of this opera evidently belongs to the most talented of  our days, and it is no wonder that his two operas \"Henry the Lion\" and  \"The Folkungs\", have rapidly found their way to every stage of  importance.  Particularly \"The Folkungs\" is such a happy combination of  modern orchestration, abundance of fine melody, and northern  characteristical coloring, that it charms the connoisseur as well as  the unlearned.    The scene is laid in Sweden, in the 13th century.    The first act represents the convent Nydal on the snowy heights of the  Kyoeles.  Sten Patrik, the confidant and abettor of Bengt, Duke of  Schoonen, {88} has allured Prince Magnus, second son of King Erick of  Sweden, to follow him out of his convent, and has brought him hither by  ruse and force.  He now announces to the Prince, that he may choose  between death and a nameless life in the convent Nydal, and Magnus,  having no choice, swears on Sten's sword that he, Prince Magnus, will  be forever dead to the world.    The monks receive him into their brotherhood, as he answers to the  Abbot Ansgar's questions, that he is an orphan, homeless, abandoned,  seeking peace only.  The Abbot first subjects Magnus to a trial of his  constancy, by letting him hold the night-vigil in storm and snow.--The  monks retire, leaving the unhappy Prince outside the gates.  While he  sinks into deep reverie, Lars Olafson, the castellan of the King's  castle of Bognaes, and son of the Prince's nurse, appears.  He seeks his  Prince, who so mysteriously disappeared from the world, and relates to  Magnus, that King Erick is dead, as well as his eldest son, and that  Prince Magnus is called to come and claim his throne and bride.  Princess Maria, the only surviving Folkung, is already being wooed by  their enemy, Duke Bengt of Schoonen, and now the listener understands  the vile plot against himself.  And as Lars calls him to defend his  country and his Princess against the Duke and his confederates the  Danes, Magnus considers it a sign from heaven that he is to die for his  country, a course of action, which his oath does not prohibit.    When the Abbot calls his new guest, he has {89} disappeared, and Sten  Patrik consoles himself with the thought that the fugitive must have  perished in the raging snow-storm.    The second act shows us Princess Maria in her castle Bognaes on the lake  of Maelar.  She is the King's niece and successor to the throne.  She  takes a last farewell from her people, and Bengt appears to lead her to  Upsala for the coronation.    The nurse Kariri and her son Olaf assure her of her folk's fidelity,  and when she has departed, Lars calls the men together, and presenting  the youth from Skoelen as their leader, makes them take oath of faith on  their standard.--Karin recognizes the Prince in the stranger, but he  firmly denies his identity, and with glowing words calls the people to  rise against their common foe.    The next scene begins with the act of coronation.--The crowned Queen  Maria is to announce her choice of a husband from the Mora-stone, when  her words are arrested by a look from Magnus, in whom she recognizes  the youth she loved.    But, though almost mad with longing and torment, Magnus, mindful of his  oath, still denies himself, and the Duke with his friend Sten, who both  believed themselves lost, impetuously demand the impostor's arrest.  But the Queen asserts her right to judge him herself.    In the fourth act Magnus is brought to his mother's sleeping room.  The  charm of youthful remembrances surround him, and hearing an old ballad,  which Karin sings, he forgets himself and so {90} proves his identity  beyond any doubt to the hidden listeners.  Maria rushes forward; he  folds her to his breast in a transport of love, and only when Karin  greets him as her King, he remembers that he has broken his oath, and  without more reflection precipitates himself from the balcony into the  sea.  Maria sinks back in a swoon.    In the last act Sten Patrik comes, to remind Bengt of his promise to  give him Schoonen.  The Duke refuses to pay him, now that Sweden is in  revolt and the Prince living.  Sten threatens to reveal his treachery  against Magnus.  Bengt is about to kill the only accomplice in his  deed, when Maria, who has heard all, arrests his arm, and accuses him  of murder.  Then she rushes to the balcony to call her people to  vengeance.  Bengt draws his sword to stab her, but the people throng  in, seize and throw him into the sea.  Now Maria hears with rapture  that Magnus lives and has driven away the Danes.  With him enter the  monks, whose Abbot releases the Prince from his oath.  Maria lovingly  embracing him, places her crown on her bridegroom's head and all cry  hail! to their King Magnus Ericson.          FRA DIAVOLO.    Comic Opera in three acts by AUBER.    Text by SCRIBE.      This nice little opera, though not equal in beauty and perfection to  the \"Muette de Portici\" by the same author, is notwithstanding, a happy  {91} invention of Auber's, particularly because the local tints are so  well caught.  The banditti are painted with bright and glowing colors,  and the part of the heroine, Zerline is the most grateful ever written  for a soubrelte.  The text by Scribe abounds in happy sallies and  lively details.  It is laid at Terracina in Italy.  Fra Diavolo is a  celebrated and much feared chief of brigands.  The Roman court of  justice has set a price of 10,000 piastres on his head.  In the first  act we meet with the Roman soldiers who undertake to win the money.  Their captain Lorenzo has a double aim in trying to catch the brigand.  He is Zerline's lover, but having no money, Zerline's father Matteo,  the owner of a hotel, threatens to give her to a rich farmer's son.  Meanwhile Fra Diavolo has forced his society on a rich English lord,  Cookburn by name, who "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24652"],[0,"Diversions in Sicily (#16)"],[1,"volunteers after landing at Marsala.  We saw Monte Inice and the heights  above Segesta.  We saw Pantellaria, halfway to Africa, but we could not  see Africa itself for Cape Bon is only visible under very exceptional  atmospheric conditions.    I have been on the mountain in the spring and eaten quails for supper.  It was the time of their migration, and they had been caught as they  rested on the islands.  I have never been able to ascertain exactly what  it is that the quails do.  First I read in a book that when going north  in the spring they rest on Levanzo and when returning south in the  autumn, on Favognana.  Levanzo being north of Favognana this meant that,  in both cases, they choose for their resting-place the second island they  come to.  There is no mistake about this being what I read, for I made a  memoria technica about it at the time out of what Rockstro, my old  counterpoint master, used to say musicians do in performing the diatonic  major scale unaccompanied.  In ascending they pass over the grave  supertonic and take the acute supertonic, and in descending they pass  over the acute supertonic and take the grave supertonic; the two  supertonics being only a comma apart, as the two islands are only a very  little way from one another.    Then I was told by a native of Trapani that this is just what the quails  do not do, and that, in fact, they rest on the first island they come to,  namely, on Favognana when going north, and on Levanzo when going south,  being too tired to fly across the geographical comma that divides the two  islands.  I was next told by another native of Trapani that the quails  rest on all the three islands indiscriminately and not merely on Levanzo  and Favognana, thus destroying any attempt at purity of intonation and  introducing equal temperament along with Marettimo, which had not  hitherto been touched upon.  He also said that if in any year it was  found that the quails avoided any one of the islands, the reason would be  that there were too many people on it.  Finally, I was told by another  native that when the quails were going north in the spring of 1906 the  wind suddenly changed and blew most of them into Trapani itself, and  people picked them up by hundreds in the streets.  It does not matter, of  course, so long as one gets the quails for supper, but if one really did  want to know, one would have as much difficulty as in finding out how  Orlando got hold of la Durlindana and where it originally came from.    The student from Castelvetrano was still there with his melancholy eyes,  studying philosophy.  He said he found the mountain more suitable for his  purpose than his native town because it was more tranquil.  I had been at  Castelvetrano, but had not noticed that it was a particularly noisy  place, indeed, I could no more have distinguished between the  tranquillity of Castelvetrano and that of the mountain than between the  acute and the grave supertonic.    The next time I met this student he had completed his studies and was  employed as a clerk in the Italian railway station at Chiasso, the  frontier town on the S. Gottardo, at an annual salary of 1,080 lire,  which is about 43 pounds 4s.  He could hardly have been sent to a station  more remote from his native town.  He had had a holiday of twelve days,  and had gone home to embrace his adorata mamma.  The government gave him  a free pass, so he travelled by rail, crossing from Reggio to Messina,  and it took him forty-six hours.  When he arrived at Castelvetrano he was  so knocked up by the journey and the change of air that he was obliged to  go to bed, where he remained till it was time for him to get up and  return to Chiasso, and this means that he was in bed for more than a  fortnight, because his holiday was extended to twenty days in  consideration of his illness.  He was quite contented about his position  and prospects and told me these facts without any complaint.  On the  whole, Mount Eryx would appear to be not such a bad school for  philosophers: nevertheless, when one considers the large part played in  evolution by the inherited desire of the organism to live beyond its  income, one may doubt whether it is good for a country's progress that  many of its men should be so philosophically contented with so little.  They do not, however, include the whole of the population, for Italy  cannot be said to be without examples of aggressive discontent.  It is  somewhere between the two extremes that practical commonsense should be  looked for.  In the meantime, if it is a question of sharing a supper of  spring quails on Mount Eryx, a peaceful, gentle philosopher is probably a  more agreeable companion than a socialistic nihilist.    If one had the power of choosing one's company, this philosopher would  counsel one not to exercise it; for he looks upon choosing as a  presumptuous kind of trying to control nature.  I pointed out that one  cannot altogether detach oneself from nature and that doing nothing is  still choosing not to choose, but he replied that it is the lesser evil,  as in choosing not to write a tragedy in five acts, which I had to admit  can seldom be wrong.  Further he asked, inasmuch as we had neither  arranged our meeting nor ordered the quails, were we not at the moment  both enjoying the advantage of having acted on his philosophy?  I bowed  and said I had been particularly fortunate this evening; but in Sicily  one is always safe because the people are so charming that the art of  travelling among them consists in allowing things to happen and in being  ready to welcome whatever may come.    Perhaps the best season for going on the mountain is the late summer and  early autumn, when the Trapanese come up for the villegiatura.  It is not  too hot during the day, as it is by the sea, and it can be almost chilly  by night, which it never is below.  Every one is in a holiday frame of  mind; even the ladies of Eryx go out, whereas during the winter they  seldom leave the house, unless, perhaps, after a storm for a turn in the  balio to see how the trees look when laden with snow.  There are picnics  and excursions to other places on the slopes of the mountain where  friends are passing the summer who presently return the visits by coming  up to breakfast with us.  There is a touring company performing in the  theatre, there is music, there are drives and all manner of quiet  amusements.    On the mainland of Italy, tobacconists' shops display the Royal Arms with  a notice that they are licensed to sell tobacco and salt.  Here a license  is necessary only for tobacco, salt being free in Sicily.  This combines  with the absence of rain to make the manufacture of salt profitable; but  should a thunderstorm dilute the pans, the fresh water must be evaporated  out again and time and money are lost.  Storms come so rarely in the  summer, however, that the caprices of the weather interfere but little  either with the salt works or the excursions.    If there is no excursion or no special occupation, we go to the caffe or  the club, or call on the chemist who is sure to be surrounded by friends,  or sit in the balio smoking and talking nonsense by the hour.  And there  is always the inexhaustible wonder of the great view.  The spacious dome  of the sky, which curves above and around, unites at the horizon with the  inverted dome of the earth and sea, which curves around and below, the  two together forming an enormous hollow globe in the midst of which the  top of the mountain seems to be suspended like the floating island of  Laputa.  Conte Pepoli can sit in his castle and watch the half-tame  ravens, with little silver bells on their necks, as they flit around the  window and perch on the crazy wooden balcony where an old priest is  asleep in a chair, over the edge of a precipice of many hundred feet,  backed by leagues upon leagues of Sicily.        CHAPTER IX--THE MADONNA AND THE PERSONAGGI      In August, 1901, I was on the mountain and saw a procession representing  Noah's Ark and the Universal Deluge--one of those strange and picturesque  cavalcades that were formerly more common than they are now.    Usually, in other parts of Italy, the same story is repeated at the same  season: in one place, always the Passion at Easter; in another, always  the Nativity at Christmas, and so forth.  On the mountain they have the  procession at irregular intervals, after perhaps three or four years, and  the story, though now, as a rule, scriptural, is never the same again.  When it does occur, it is as an extra embellishment of the annual harvest  thanksgiving; it takes place by night and always introduces the Madonna  di Custonaci.  And now it is time to say a few words about this famous  Madonna, whose influence is felt throughout the whole comune at all  times, but nowhere more than on the Mountain, and at no time more than  during the harvest thanksgiving.    Mount Eryx, as every one knows, was in classical times famous for the  worship of Venus: here stood perhaps the most celebrated of all her  temples--the one with which her name is most familiarly associated--and  here, long before Horace wrote of \"Erycina ridens,\" she was worshipped as  Aphrodite by the Greeks, and as Astarte or Ashtaroth by the Phoenicians.  Hardly any vestige of a temple can now be made out, but the remains of  the Pelasgic walls that protected the city in prehistoric ages are still  to be seen near the Trapani gate.  The late Samuel Butler (author of  _Erewhon_) wrote _The Authoress of the Odyssey_ (Longmans, 1897) in  support of his view that the _Odyssey_ was written by a woman who lived  at Trapani and upon the mountain, and who in the poem described her own  country.  In Chapter XII. he quotes Thucydides (vi. 2), to show that the  Sicans had inhabited this corner of the island from a very remote period,  having come probably from Spain.  After the fall of Troy, some of the  Trojans, who had"]]]
