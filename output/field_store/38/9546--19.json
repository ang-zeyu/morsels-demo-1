He did his best, therefore, to conceal his vexations from  the public eye. But his violent passions and his intemperate habits  disqualified him for the part of a dissembler. His gloomy looks, when he  came out of the council chamber, showed how little he was pleased  with what had passed at the board; and, when the bottle had gone round  freely, words escaped him which betrayed his uneasiness. [70]    He might, indeed, well be uneasy. Indiscreet and unpopular measures  followed each other in rapid succession. All thought of returning to the  policy of the Triple Alliance was abandoned. The King explicitly avowed  to the ministers of those continental powers with which he had lately  intended to ally himself, that all his views had undergone a change, and  that England was still to be, as she had been under his grandfather,  his father, and his brother, of no account in Europe. \"I am in no  condition,\" he said to the Spanish Ambassador, \"to trouble myself about  what passes abroad. It is my resolution to let foreign affairs take  their course, to establish my authority at home, and to do something for  my religion.\" A few days later he announced the same intentions to the  States General. [71] From that time to the close of his ignominious  reign, he made no serious effort to escape from vassalage, though, to  the last, he could never hear, without transports of rage, that men  called him a vassal.    The two events which proved to the public that Sunderland and  Sunderland's party were victorious were the prorogation of the  Parliament from February to May, and the departure of Castelmaine for  Rome with the appointments of an Ambassador of the highest rank. [72]    Hitherto all the business of the English government at the papal court  had been transacted by John Caryl. This gentleman was known to his  contemporaries as a man of fortune and fashion, and as the author of two  successful plays, a tragedy in rhyme which had been made popular by  the action and recitation of Betterton, and a comedy which owes all  its value to scenes borrowed from Moliere. These pieces have long been  forgotten; but what Caryl could not do for himself has been done for him  by a more powerful genius. Half a line in the Rape of the Lock has made  his name immortal.    Caryl, who was, like all the other respectable Roman Catholics, an enemy  to violent courses, had acquitted himself of his delicate errand at Rome  with good sense and good feeling. The business confided to him was well  done; but he assumed no public character, and carefully avoided all  display. His mission, therefore, put the government to scarcely any  charge, and excited scarcely any murmurs. His place was now most  unwisely supplied by a costly and ostentatious embassy, offensive in the  highest degree to the people of England, and by no means welcome to the  court of Rome. Castelmaine had it in charge to demand a Cardinal's hat  for his confederate Petre.    About the same time the King began to show, in an unequivocal manner,  the feeling which he really entertained towards the banished Huguenots.  While he had still hoped to cajole his Parliament into submission and to  become the head of an European coalition against France, he had affected  to blame the revocation of the edict of Nantes, and to pity the unhappy  men whom persecution had driven from their country. He had caused it to  be announced that, at every church in the kingdom, a collection would  be made under his sanction for their benefit. A proclamation on this  subject had been drawn up in terms which might have wounded the pride of  a sovereign less sensitive and vainglorious than Lewis. But all was now  changed. The principles of the treaty of Dover were again the principles  of the foreign policy of England. Ample apologies were therefore made  for the discourtesy with which the English government had acted towards  France in showing favour to exiled Frenchmen. The proclamation which  had displeased Lewis was recalled. [73] The Huguenot ministers were  admonished to speak with reverence of their oppressor in their public  discourses, as they would answer it at their peril. James not only  ceased to express commiseration for the sufferers, but declared that he  believed them to harbour the worst designs, and owned that he had been  guilty of an error in countenancing them. One of the most eminent of the  refugees, John Claude, had published on the Continent a small volume  in which he described with great force the sufferings of his brethren.  Barillon demanded that some opprobrious mark should be put on his book.  James complied, and in full council declared it to be his pleasure  that Claude's libel should be burned by the hangman before the Royal  Exchange. Even Jeffreys was startled, and ventured to represent that  such a proceeding was without example, that the book was written in a  foreign tongue, that it had been printed at a foreign press, that it  related entirely to transactions which had taken place in a foreign  country, and that no English government had ever animadverted on  such works. James would not suffer the question to be discussed. \"My  resolution,\" he said, \"is taken. It has become the fashion to treat  Kings disrespectfully; and they must stand by each other. One King  should always take another's part: and I have particular reasons for  showing this respect to the King of France.\" There was silence at  the board. The order was forthwith issued; and Claude's pamphlet was  committed to the flames, not without the deep murmurs of many who had  always been reputed steady loyalists. [74]    The promised collection was long put off under various pretexts. The  King would gladly have broken his word; but it was pledged so solemnly  that he could not for very shame retract. [75] Nothing, however, which  could cool the zeal of congregations was omitted. It had been expected  that, according to the practice usual on such occasions, the people  would be exhorted to liberality from the pulpits. But James was  determined not to tolerate declamations against his religion and his  ally. The Archbishop of Canterbury was therefore commanded to inform  the clergy that they must merely read the brief, and must not presume  to preach on the sufferings of the French Protestants. [76] Nevertheless  the contributions were so large that, after all deductions, the sum of  forty thousand pounds was paid into the Chamber of London. Perhaps none  of the munificent subscriptions of our own age has borne so great a  proportion to the means of the nation. [77]    The King was bitterly mortified by the large amount of the collection  which had been made in obedience to his own call. He knew, he said, what  all this liberality meant. It was mere Whiggish spite to himself and his  religion. [78] He had already resolved that the money should be of no  use to those whom the donors wished to benefit. He had been, during some  weeks, in close communication with the French embassy on this subject,  and had, with the approbation of the court of Versailles, determined on  a course which it is not very easy to reconcile with those principles of  toleration to which he afterwards pretended to be attached. The refugees  were zealous for the Calvinistic discipline and worship. James therefore  gave orders that none should receive a crust of bread or a basket of  coals who did not first take the sacrament according to the Anglican  ritual. [79] It is strange that this inhospitable rule should have been  devised by a prince who affected to consider the Test Act as an outrage  on the rights of conscience: for, however unjustifiable it may be to  establish a sacramental test for the purpose of ascertaining whether  men are fit for civil and military office, it is surely much more  unjustifiable to establish a sacramental test for the purpose of  ascertaining whether, in their extreme distress, they are fit objects of  charity. Nor had James the plea which may be urged in extenuation of  the guilt of almost all other persecutors: for the religion which he  commanded the refugees to profess, on pain of being left to starve,  was not his own religion. His conduct towards them was therefore less  excusable than that of Lewis: for Lewis oppressed them in the hope of  bringing them over from a damnable heresy to the true Church: James  oppressed them only for the purpose of forcing them to apostatize from  one damnable heresy to another.    Several Commissioners, of whom the Chancellor was one, had been  appointed to dispense the public alms. When they met for the first time,  Jeffreys announced the royal pleasure. The refugees, he said, were too  generally enemies of monarchy and episcopacy. If they wished for relief,  they must become members of the Church of England, and must take the  sacrament from the hands of his chaplain. Many exiles, who had come full  of gratitude and hope to apply for succour, heard their sentence, and  went brokenhearted away. [80]    May was now approaching; and that month had been fixed for the meeting  of the Houses: but they were again prorogued to November. [81] It  was not strange that the King did not wish to meet them: for he had  determined to adopt a policy which he knew to be, in the highest degree,  odious to them. From his predecessors he had inherited two prerogatives,  of which the limits had never been defined with strict accuracy, and  which, if exerted without any limit, would of themselves have sufficed  to overturn the whole polity of the State and of the Church. These were  the dispensing power and the ecclesiastical supremacy. By means of the  dispensing power the King purposed to admit Roman Catholics, not merely  to civil and military, but to spiritual, offices. By means of the  ecclesiastical supremacy he hoped to make the Anglican clergy his  instruments "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/244"],[0,"A Study in Scarlet (#16)"],[1," of the mountains and the  balsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to  the young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger,  her cheek more rudy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon  the high road which ran by Ferrier's farm felt long-forgotten thoughts  revive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping  through the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father's mustang,  and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the West.  So the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her father  the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of American  girlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope.    It was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had  developed into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious  change is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of  all does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the  touch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns,  with a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has  awoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and remember  the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life. In the  case of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself, apart  from its future influence on her destiny and that of many besides.    It was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as  the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields and  in the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty high  roads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to the  west, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the Overland  Route lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were droves of  sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands, and trains  of tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their interminable  journey. Through all this motley assemblage, threading her way with the  skill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy Ferrier, her fair  face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out  behind her. She had a commission from her father in the City, and was  dashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness  of youth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed. The  travel-stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment, and even  the unemotional Indians, journeying in with their pelties, relaxed their  accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale-faced  maiden.    She had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road  blocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking  herdsmen from the plains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass this  obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap. Scarcely  had she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed in behind  her, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of  fierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to deal with  cattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took advantage of  every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way  through the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures,  either by accident or design, came in violent contact with the flank of  the mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant it reared up upon  its hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way that  would have unseated any but a most skilful rider. The situation was full  of peril. Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns  again, and goaded it to fresh madness. It was all that the girl could  do to keep herself in the saddle, yet a slip would mean a terrible death  under the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals. Unaccustomed to  sudden emergencies, her head began to swim, and her grip upon the bridle  to relax. Choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the  struggling creatures, she might have abandoned her efforts in despair,  but for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance. At  the same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by  the curb, and forcing a way through the drove, soon brought her to the  outskirts.    \"You're not hurt, I hope, miss,\" said her preserver, respectfully.    She looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily. \"I'm awful  frightened,\" she said, naively; \"whoever would have thought that Poncho  would have been so scared by a lot of cows?\"    \"Thank God you kept your seat,\" the other said earnestly. He was a tall,  savage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse, and  clad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over his  shoulders. \"I guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier,\" he remarked,  \"I saw you ride down from his house. When you see him, ask him if he  remembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis. If he's the same Ferrier, my  father and he were pretty thick.\"    \"Hadn't you better come and ask yourself?\" she asked, demurely.    The young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyes  sparkled with pleasure. \"I'll do so,\" he said, \"we've been in the  mountains for two months, and are not over and above in visiting  condition. He must take us as he finds us.\"    \"He has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,\" she answered,  \"he's awful fond of me. If those cows had jumped on me he'd have never  got over it.\"    \"Neither would I,\" said her companion.    \"You! Well, I don't see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow.  You ain't even a friend of ours.\"    The young hunter's dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy  Ferrier laughed aloud.    \"There, I didn't mean that,\" she said; \"of course, you are a friend now.  You must come and see us. Now I must push along, or father won't trust  me with his business any more. Good-bye!\"    \"Good-bye,\" he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over  her little hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with her  riding-whip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of  dust.    Young Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn.  He and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver,  and were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital  enough to work some lodes which they had discovered. He had been as keen  as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawn  his thoughts into another channel. The sight of the fair young girl,  as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his volcanic,  untamed heart to its very depths. When she had vanished from his sight,  he realized that a crisis had come in his life, and that neither silver  speculations nor any other questions could ever be of such importance to  him as this new and all-absorbing one. The love which had sprung up in  his heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but rather the  wild, fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper. He  had been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook. He swore in  his heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human  perseverance could render him successful.    He called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until  his face was a familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in the  valley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning  the news of the outside world during the last twelve years. All this  Jefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested  Lucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer in California, and  could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost  in those wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a  silver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were to be  had, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became a  favourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues. On  such occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her bright,  happy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer  her own. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms,  but they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her  affections.    It was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled  up at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. He  threw the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.    \"I am off, Lucy,\" he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing  tenderly down into her face; \"I won't ask you to come with me now, but  will you be ready to come when I am here again?\"    \"And when will that be?\" she asked, blushing and laughing.    \"A couple of months at the outside. I will come and claim you then, my  darling. There's no one who can stand between us.\"    \"And how about father?\" she asked.    \"He has given his consent, provided we get these mines working all  right. I have no fear on that head.\"    \"Oh, well; of course, if you and father have arranged it all, there's  no more to be said,\" she whispered, with her cheek against his broad  breast.    \"Thank God!\" he said, hoarsely, stooping and kissing her. \"It is  settled, then. The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. They are  waiting for me at the canon. Good-bye, my own darling--good-bye. In two  months you shall see me.\"    He tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his  horse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though  afraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at  what he was leaving. She stood at the gate, gazing after him until  he vanished from her sight. Then she walked back into the house, the  happiest girl in all Utah."]]]
