It was built entirely upon the ice; and, as the hunter well knew,  there was a hole in its floor by which the animals could get into the  water at will.  How then was he to prevent them from escaping by the  hole, while we removed the covering or roof?  This was what puzzled me,  and I watched his movements with interest.    \"Instead of digging into the house, he commenced cutting a hole in the  ice with his ice-chisel about two feet from the edge of the mud.  That  being accomplished, he cut another, and another, until four holes were  pierced forming the corners of a square, and embracing the house of the  muskrat within.    \"Leaving this house, he then proceeded to pierce a similar set of holes  around another that also stood out on the open lake.  After that he went  to a third one, and this and then a fourth were prepared in a similar  manner.    \"He now returned to the first, this time taking care to tread lightly  upon the ice and make as little stir as possible.  Having arrived there,  he took out from his bag a square net made of twisted deer-thongs, and  not much, bigger than a blanket.  This in a most ingenious manner he  passed under the ice, until its four corners appeared opposite the four  holes; where, drawing them through, he made all last and `taut' by a  line stretching from one corner to the other.    \"His manner of passing the net under the ice I have pronounced  ingenious.  It was accomplished by reeving a line from hole to hole by  means of the long slender pole already mentioned.  The pole, inserted  through one of the holes, conducted the line, and was itself conducted  by means of two forked sticks that guided it, and pushed it along to the  other holes.  The line being attached to the comers of the net made it  an easy matter to draw the latter into its position.    \"All the details of this curious operation were performed with a  noiseless adroitness which showed `Old Foxey' was no novice at  `rat-catching.'    \"The net being now quite taut along the lower surface of the ice, must  of course completely cover the hole in the `floor.'  It followed,  therefore, that if the muskrats were `at home,' they were now `in the  trap.'    \"My companion assured me that they would be found inside.  The reason  why he had not used the net on first cutting the holes, was to give any  member of the family that had been frightened out, a chance of  returning; and this he knew they would certainly do, as these creatures  cannot remain very long under the water.    \"He soon satisfied me of the truth of his statement.  In a few minutes,  by means of the ice-chisel and pickaxe, we had pierced the crust of the  dome; and there, apparently half asleep,--because dazzled and blinded by  the sudden influx of light--were no less than eight full-grown  musquashes!    \"Almost before I could count them, Old Foxey had transfixed the whole  party, one after the other, with his long spear.    \"We now proceeded to another of the houses, at which the holes had been  cut.  There my companion went through a similar series of operations;  and was rewarded by a capture of six more `rats.'    \"In the third of the houses only three were found.    \"On opening a fourth, a singular scene met our eyes.  There was but, one  muskrat alive, and that one seemed to be nearly famished to death.  Its  body was wasted to mere `skin and bone;' and the animal had evidently  been a long time without food.  Beside it lay the naked skeletons of  several small animals that I at once saw were those of the muskrat.  A  glance at the bottom of the nest explained all.  The hole, which in the  other houses had passed through the ice, and which we found quite open,  in this one was frozen up.  The animals had neglected keeping it open,  until the ice had got too thick for them to break through; and then,  impelled by the cravings of hunger, they had preyed upon each other,  until only one, the strongest, survived!    \"I found upon counting the skeletons that no less than eleven had  tenanted this ice-bound prison.    \"The Indian assured me that in seasons of very severe frost such an  occurrence is not rare.  At such times the ice forms so rapidly, that  the animals--perhaps not having occasion to go out for some hours--find  themselves frozen in; and are compelled to perish of hunger, or devour  one another!    \"It was now near night--for we had not reached the lake until late in  the day--and my companion proposed that we should leave farther  operations until the following morning.  Of course I assented to the  proposal, and we betook ourselves to some pine-trees that grew on a high  bank near the shore, where we had determined to pass the night.    \"There we kindled a roaring fire of pine-knots; but we had grown very  hungry, and I soon found that of the provisions I had brought, and upon  which I had already dined, there remained but a scanty fragment for  supper.  This did not trouble my companion, who skinned several of the  `rats,' gave them a slight warming over the fire, and then ate them up  with as much _gout_ as if they had been partridges.  I was hungry, but  not hungry enough for that; so I sat watching him with some  astonishment, and not without a slight feeling of disgust.    \"It was a beautiful moonlight night, one of the clearest I ever  remember.  There was a little snow upon the ground, just enough to cover  it; and up against the white sides of the hills could be traced the  pyramidal outlines of the pines, with their regular gradations of dark  needle-clothed branches.  They rose on all sides around the lake,  looking like ships with furled sails and yards square-set.    \"I was in a reverie of admiration, when I was suddenly aroused by a  confused noise, that resembled the howling and baying of hounds.  I  turned an inquiring look upon my companion.    \"`Wolves!' he replied, unconcernedly, chawing away at his `roast rat.'    \"The howling sounded nearer and nearer; and then there was a rattling  among dead trees, and the quickly-repeated `crunch, crunch,' as of the  hoofs of some animal breaking through frozen snow.  The next moment a  deer dashed past in full run, and took to the ice.  It was a large buck,  of the `Caribou' or reindeer species (_Cervus tarandus_), and I could  see that he was smoking with heat, and almost run down.    \"He had hardly passed the spot when the howl again broke out in a  continued strain, and a string of forms appeared from out the bushes.  They were about a dozen in all; and they were going at full speed like a  pack of hounds on the view.  Their long muzzles, erect ears, and huge  gaunt bodies, were outlined plainly against the snowy ground.  I saw  that they were wolves.  They were white wolves, and of the largest  species.    \"I had suddenly sprung to my feet, not with the intention of saving the  deer, but of assisting in its capture; and for this purpose I seized the  spear, and ran out.  I heard my companion, as I thought, shouting some  caution after me; but I was too intent upon the chase to pay any  attention to what he said.  I had at the moment a distinct perception of  hunger, and an indistinct idea of roast venison for supper.    \"As I got down to the shore, I saw that the wolves had overtaken the  deer, and dragged it down upon the ice.  The poor creature made but poor  running on the slippery track, sprawling at every bound; while the sharp  claws of its pursuers enabled them to gallop over the ice like cats.  The deer had, no doubt, mistaken the ice for water, which these  creatures very often do, and thus become an easy prey to wolves, dogs,  and hunters.    \"I ran on, thinking that I would soon scatter the wolves, and rob them  of their prey.  In a few moments I was in their midst, brandishing my  spear; but to my surprise, as well as terror, I saw that, instead of  relinquishing the deer, several of them still held on it, while the rest  surrounded me with open jaws, and eyes glancing like coals of fire.    \"I shouted and fought desperately, thrusting the spear first at one and  then at another; but the wolves only became more bold and fierce,  incensed by the wounds I was inflicting.    \"For several minutes I continued this unexpected conflict.  I was  growing quite exhausted; and a sense of terrible dread coming over me,  had almost paralysed me, when the tall, dark form of the Indian,  hurrying over the ice, gave me new courage; and I plied the spear with  all my remaining strength, until several of my assailants lay pierced  upon the ice.  The others, now seeing the proximity of my companion with  his huge ice-chisel, and frighted, moreover, by his wild Indian yells,  turned tail and scampered off.    \"Three of them, however, had uttered their last howl, and the deer was  found close by--already half devoured!    \"There was enough left, however, to make a good supper for both myself  and my companion; who, although, he had already picked the bones of  three muskrats, made a fresh attack upon the venison, eating of it as  though he had not tasted food for a fortnight.\"        CHAPTER ELEVEN.    MUSQUITOES AND THEIR ANTIDOTE.    Our next day's journey brought us again into heavy timber--another creek  bottom.  The soil was rich and loamy, and the road we travelled was  moist, and in some places very heavy for our waggon.  Several times the  latter got stalled in the mud, and then the whole party were obliged to  dismount, and put their shoulders to the wheel.  Our progress was marked  by some noise and confusion, and the constant din made by Jake talking  to his team, his loud sonorous \"woha!\" as they were obliged to halt, and  the lively \"gee-up--gee-up\" as they moved on again--frighted any game  long before we could come up with it.  Of course we were compelled to  keep by the waggon until we had made the passage of the miry flat.    We were dreadfully annoyed by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23519"],[0,"The Mormon Menace: The Confessions of John Doyle Lee, Danite (#16)"],[1,"for counsel. He  told us that the Saints would gather again in Illinois. We asked  him at what point, and he said:    \"I do not know yet, but the further north we go the fewer  poisonous serpents we will find.\"    He then advised us to attend private meetings and be set apart to  the ministry. Public meetings could not be held by the terms of  the treaty. We did attend private meetings, and I was ordained in  the Quorum of Seventies, under the hands of Joseph Young and Levi  Hancock. Stewart was ordained to the lesser Priesthood, which  gave him authority to preach and baptize, but not to confirm.    The office that I held gave me authority to preach, baptize, and  confirm by the laying on of hands, for the reception of the Holy  Ghost, and to ordain and set apart Elders, Priests, Teachers, and  Deacons, and to ordain a Seventy or High Priest, as the office of  a Seventy belongs to the Melchisedek Priesthood; yet a Seventy or  High Priest is generally ordained and set apart by the presidents  of the several quorums.    After we were ordained we attended a private feast and blessing  meeting, at which my wife and I got our Patriarchal Blessing,  under the hands of Isaac Morley, Patriarch. This office properly  belongs to those that are ordained and set apart to that calling,  to bless the fatherless and the widow especially; but he can  bless others who ask it and pay one dollar for the blessing.  Often the widow and the poor are blessed free, but this is at the  option of the Patriarch. My Patriarchal Blessing was in the  following form:    \"Brother John Doyle Lee: In the name of Jesus of Nazareth, and by  virtue and authority of the Holy Priesthood, in me vested, I lay  my hands upon thy head, and confer upon thee a Patriarchal or  Father's Blessing. Thou art of Ephriam, through the loins of  Joseph, that was sold into Egypt. And inasmuch as thou hast  obeyed the requirements of the gospel of salvation, thy sins are  forgiven thee. Thy name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life,  never more to be blotted out. Thou art lawful heir to all the  blessings of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the new and everlasting  covenant. Thou shalt travel until thou art satisfied with seeing.  Thousands shall hear the everlasting gospel proclaimed from thy  lips. Kings and princes shall acknowledge thee to be their father  in the new and everlasting covenant. Thou shalt have a numerous  posterity, who shall rise up and bless thee. Thou shalt have  houses and habitations, flocks, fields, and herds. Thy table  shall be strewed with the rich luxuries of the earth, to feed thy  numerous family and friends who shall come unto thee. Thou shalt  be a counselor in Israel, and many shall come unto thee for  instruction. Thou shalt have power over thine enemies. They that  oppose thee shall yet come bending unto thee. Thou shalt sit  under thine own vine and fig tree, where none shall molest or  make thee afraid. Thou shalt be a blessing to thy family and to  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Thou shalt  understand the hidden things of the Kingdom of Heaven. The spirit  of inspiration shall be a light in thy path and a guide to thy  mind. Thou shalt come forth in the morning of the first  resurrection, and no power shall hinder, except the shedding of  innocent blood, or consenting thereto. I seal thee up to eternal  life. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy  Ghost, Amen, and Amen.\"    To a true believer in the faith of the Latter-day Saints a  blessing of this kind, from under the hand of a Patriarch, was  then, and is now, next to a boon of eternal life. A Patriarch is  a man highly favored of God, possesses the gift of discerning  spirits, and can read the present and future destiny of men.  Patriarchal blessings strengthen, stimulate and encourage true  Saints to press on to perfection while passing through this world  of sorrows, cares and disappointments.    Having been ordained and blessed, my next step was to arm myself  with the Armor of Righteousness, and in my weakness pray for  strength to face a frowning world. I had put my hands to the plow  and I was determined that, with God's help, I would never turn  back to the sinful elements of the world, the flesh, and the  devil.        CHAPTER VII - THE SAINTS GATHER AT NAUVOO    About the middle of February, 1839, I started back for Fayette  County, Illinois, with my family, in company with Brother Levi  Stewart and Riley Helm, two of my old Illinois neighbors. While  traveling through Missouri we were kindly treated by most of the  people; many of them requested us to stop and settle down by  them. I refused to do so, for I knew there was no safety for a  true Saint in that State at that time.    When we crossed the Mississippi River at Quincy, and touched  Illinois soil, I felt like a new man, and a free American citizen  again. At this place I found many of the Saints who had preceded  us camped along the river. Some had obtained employment; all  appeared happy in the faith and strong in the determination to  build up the Kingdom. Here I parted with Riley Helm, as his team  had given out and he could go no farther. I gave him twenty-five  cents in money - all that I had in the world - and twelve pounds  of nails, to buy food with until he could get aid from some other  quarter. I had laid in enough provisions at Brother Morris' to  last me until I could reach my old home again. I started from  Quincy by way of Mr. Vanleven's, the man I sold my cattle to,  taking his note, when going to join the Saints.    Without meeting with any remarkable adventures, I arrived at Mr.  Vanleven's house and was kindly received by him. He had the money  ready for me, and paid me in full all he owed on the cattle. I  now saw that some honesty yet remained in the world. I took two  hundred dollars and left the rest of it with my friend and  banker, so that it would be safe in case I met another storm of  oppression. I then went to Vandalia, Illinois, and put up with my  wife's sister's husband, Hickerson. He was in good circumstances.  I left my wife with her sister, after laying in a supply of  provisions for her and our child. I then commenced preparing for  a mission. I did not know where I was to go, but I felt it my  duty to go forth and give my testimony to the truth of the gospel  as revealed by Joseph, the prophet of the everlasting God.  Brother Stewart was to go with me, he having made arrangements  for the comfort of his family during his absence.    The time I started on my first mission was about the 1st of  April, 1839. I bade adieu to my little family and started forth,  an illiterate, inexperienced man, without purse or scrip. I could  hardly quote a passage of Scripture, yet I went forth to say to  the world that I was a minister of the gospel, bearing a message  from on High, with the authority to call upon all men to repent,  be baptized for the remission of their sins, and receive the Holy  Spirit by the laying on of hands. I had never attempted to preach  a discourse in my life. I expected trials, and I had them to  undergo many times.    Brother Stewart and myself started forth on foot, with our  valises on our backs. We walked about thirty miles the first day,  and as night was approaching we called at a house for lodging.  They had been having a log rolling there that day, and quite a  number of people were around the house. We asked for lodging and  refreshments.    Our request was carried back to the supper-room to the man of the  house, and we stood at the gate awaiting the reply. Presently the  man came out and said that no Mormon preacher could stay in his  house; and if we wished to save our scalps we had better be  making tracks lively.    Brother Stewart took him at his word, and started off at a double  quick. I followed, but more slowly. We made no reply to that  man's remarks. A mile further on we again called for lodging.    The man could not keep us, as he was poor, and his family sick;  but he directed us to a house half a mile from the traveled road,  where he said a man lived that was an infidel, but would not turn  a hungry man from his door.    We went to the house and asked for entertainment. The man said he  never turned a man from his door hungry, but would as soon  entertain horse thieves as Mormon preachers; that he looked upon  all Mormons as thieves, robbers, and scoundrels. There was  determination in his voice as he addressed us in this manner. He  held his rifle in his hand while speaking. Then he said:    \"Walk in, gentlemen. I never turn the hungry away.\" He addressed  his wife, a very pretty, unassuming lady, and said, \"Get these  men some supper, for I suppose they feel pretty lank.\"    There was a good supper soon on the table; but I could not eat.  Brother Stewart ate his supper, and soon was enjoying himself  talking to the family. He was a great talker; liked to hear  himself talk. They requested me to eat, but I thanked them, and  said rest would do me more good than eating. I soon retired, but  did not sleep. I was humiliated; my proud spirit was broken and  humbled; the rough words used toward me bad stricken me to the  heart. At daylight we were on our way again.    About ten o'clock we arrived at a little town, and went to the  public pump to get a drink. While there a woman came to the pump  and asked us if we were Mormon preachers. We told her we were,  but had never preached yet. She invited us to her house, saying  she owned the hotel; that she was a widow; that she would inform  the people of the town we were there, and as it was the Sabbath  we could preach in her house, for she wished to hear the strange  doctrine. We consented to remain, and went home with her and had  something to eat.    At 11 o'clock, a. m., I made my debut to quite an attentive  audience. I both quoted and made Scripture. I had been fasting  and praying until I had become as humble as a child. My whole  mind and"]]]
