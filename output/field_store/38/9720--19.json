Across the wing at, roughly, about  a third of its length from the body runs the _basal nervure_ (5); this  extends in a somewhat zigzag line from the _post-costal_ to the _posterior  nervure_ crossing the _median_, and {137} thereby enclosing two cells, the  _upper basal cell_ (_B_) and the _lower basal cell_ (_C_). From the centre  of the apical nerve of each of these cells extends a longitudinal nervure;  the upper of these runs out nearly to the apical margin of the wing and is  called the _cubital nervure_ (6); this is united to the nervure of the  _marginal cell_ by one, two, or three cross nervures, enclosing thereby  one, two, or three cells called the first (_D_), second (_E_), and third  (_F_) _submarginal cells_. The nervure from the lower basal cell is a short  one, as it is met by a cross nervure called the first _recurrent nervure_  (10), which runs from the _cubital_ to the _posterior_, thereby enclosing  two cells, the first (_G_) and second (_H_) _discoidal_. The _second  recurrent_ (11) leaves the _cubital_ nearer the apex of the wing than the  first, meeting a nervure which, springing from the outer posterior angle of  the second discoidal, closes the third discoidal (_I_), and, curving  slightly upwards, nearly reaches the apical margin of the wing. Beyond the  second recurrent, and behind this last nervure which we have been talking  about, are two spaces not actually enclosed, but called the _first_ (_J_)  _and second_ (_K_) _apical cells_.    The posterior wings have very few cells. {138} Like the anterior pair they  have three longitudinal nervures; the _anterior_ (7), which runs close and  parallel to the anterior nerveless margin, and often touches it at about  half the length of the wing; the _median_ (8) and _posterior_ (9) run in  diverging lines from the base towards the exterior margin of the wing, the  anterior and median nervures being almost always joined by a cross nervure,  and the median usually united to the posterior by a cross or curved  nervure. The actual base of the anterior wing is covered by a little convex  somewhat shell-like cap, called the _tegula_ (_T_). The abdomen is composed  of a series of segments in linear arrangement (_c_^1 _c_^2, etc.). These  call for no special remark, beyond what has been said in the chapter on  males and females, but those who wish to investigate the very interesting  questions connected with the terminal segments of these creatures should  consult some more technical work.[3] The arrangements of the mouth parts  and of the apical segments of the Hymenoptera afford perhaps the most  important structural {139} characters of the order, but they involve an  amount of dissection and study which can only be undertaken by those who  are inclined to give themselves up to this subject as a speciality.           *       *       *       *       *      {141}    INDEX      Abdomen, 125    Acetabulum, 135    Ammophila, 22    Andrena, 9, 12, 15, 48, 77, 79, 122, 139      -- fulva, 121      --

Nor can platinum be cemented into the silica by means of  arsenic enamel, nor by any of the softer glasses used for such purposes.  I have come near to success by using kaolin, but the results with this  material do not afford a real solution of the problem, though they may  perhaps point to a hopeful line of attack. Possibly platinum wires might  be soldered into the tubes (see _Laboratory Arts_, R. Threlfall), but  this also is uncertain.    The process of preparing silica tubes, etc., from Lumps of Brazil  Crystal may be described conveniently under the following headings. I  describe the various processes fully in these pages, as those who are  interested in the matter will probably wish to try every part of the  process in the first instance. But I may say that in practice I think  almost every one will find it advantageous to start with purchased  silica tubes, just as a glass-worker starts with a supply of purchased  glass tubes. The manufacturer can obtain his oxygen at a lower price  than the retail purchaser, and a workman who gives much time to such  work can turn out silica tube so much more quickly than an amateur, that  I think it will be found that both time and money can be saved by  purchasing the tube. At the same time the beginner will find it worth  while to learn and practise each stage of the process at first, as every  part of the work described may be useful in the production of finished  apparatus from silica tubes.    This being so, I am glad to be able to add that a leading firm of  dealers in apparatus[25] has commenced making silica goods on a  commercial scale, so that the new material is now available for all  those who need it or wish to examine its properties.    [25] Messrs. Baird and Tatlock.      =Preparing non-splintering Silica from Brazil Pebble.=--The best variety  of native Silica is Brazil Pebble, which may be obtained in chips or  larger masses. These should be thoroughly cleaned, heated in boiling  water, and dropped into cold water, the treatment being repeated till  the masses have cracked to such an extent that they may be broken easily  by blows from a clean steel pestle or hammer.    The fragments thus produced must be hand-picked, and those which are not  perfectly free from foreign matter should be rejected. The pure and  transparent pieces must then be heated to a yellow-red heat in a covered  platinum dish in a muffle or reverberatory furnace and quickly plunged  into a deep clean vessel containing clean distilled water; this process  being repeated, if necessary, till the product consists of semi-opaque  friable masses, very much like a white enamel in appearance. After these  have been washed with distilled water, well drained and dried, they may  be brought into the hottest part of an oxy-gas flame safely, or pressed  suddenly against masses of white hot silica without any preliminary  heating, such as is necessary in the case of natural quartz. Quartz  which has not been submitted to the above preparatory process, splinters  on contact with the flame to such an extent that very few would care to  face the trouble and expense of working with so refractory a material.  But after the above treatment, which really gives little trouble, all  the difficulties which hampered the pioneer workers in silica disappear  as if by magic.      =Apparatus.=--Very little special apparatus need be provided for working  with silica, but it is absolutely essential to protect the eyes with  very dark glasses. These should be so dark as to render it a little  difficult to work with them at first. If long spells of work are  undertaken, two pairs of spectacles should be provided, for the glasses  quickly become hot enough to cause great inconvenience and even injury  to the eyes.    Almost any of the available oxy-gas burners may be used, but they vary  considerably in efficiency, and it is economical to obtain a very  efficient burner. The 'blow-through' burners are least satisfactory, and  I have long since abandoned the use of them. Some of the safety  'mixed-gas jets' have an inconvenient trick of burning-back, with sharp  explosions, which are highly disconcerting, if the work be brought too  near the nozzle of the burner. I have found the patent burner of Mr.  Jackson (Brin's Oxygen Company, Manchester) most satisfactory, and it  offers the advantage that several jets can be combined in a group easily  and inexpensively for work on large apparatus. The large roaring flames  such as are used, I understand, for welding steel are very expensive,  and not very efficient for the work here described.      =The method of making Silica Tubes.=--Before commencing to make a tube a  supply of vitreous silica in rods about one or two millimetres in  diameter must be prepared. To make one of these, hold a fragment of the  non-splintering silica described above in the oxy-gas flame by means of  forceps tipped with platinum so as to melt one of its corners, press a  small fragment of the same material against the melted part till the two  adhere and heat it from below upwards,[26] till it becomes clear and  vitreous, add a third fragment in a similar manner, then a fourth, and  so on till an irregular rod has been formed. Finally re-heat this rod in  sections and draw it out whilst plastic into rods or coarse threads of  the desired dimensions. If one works carefully the forceps do not suffer  much. I have had one pair in almost constant use for several years; they  have been used in the training of five beginners and are still  practically uninjured.    [26] This is to avoid bubbles in the finished glass.    The beginner should work with a gauge and regulator on the bottle of  oxygen, and should watch the consumption of oxygen closely. A large  expenditure of oxygen does not by any means necessarily imply a  corresponding output of silica, even by one who has mastered the initial  difficulties.    When a supply of the small rods of vitreous silica has been provided,  bind a few of them round a rod of platinum (diameter say, 1 mm.) by  means of platinum wires at the two ends and heat the silica gradually,  beginning at one end after slightly withdrawing the platinum core from  that end, till a rough tube about four or five centimetres in length has  been formed. Close one end of this, expand it, by blowing, into a small  bulb, attach a silica rod to the remote end of the bulb, re-heat the  bulb and draw it out into a fine tube. Blow a fresh bulb on one end of  this and again draw it out, proceeding in this way till you have a tube  about six or eight centimetres in length. All larger tubes and vessels  are produced by developing this fine tube suitably.      =Precautions.=--The following points must be carefully kept in mind,  both during the making of the first tube and afterwards:--    (1) The hottest spot in the oxy-gas flame is at a point very near the  tip of the inner cone of the flame, and silica can be softened best at  this hot spot. The excellence of a burner does not depend on the size of  its flame, so much as on the temperature of its \"hot spot,\" and the  success of the worker depends on his skill in bringing his work exactly  to this part of the flame. Comparatively large masses of silica may be  softened in a comparatively small jet if the hot spot is properly  utilised.    (2) Silica is very apt to exhibit a phenomenon resembling  devitrification during working. It becomes covered with a white  incrustation, which seems to be comparatively rich in alkali.[27] This  incrustation is very easily removed by re-heating the whitened surface,  provided that the material has been kept scrupulously clean. If the  silica has been brought into the flame when dusty, or even after much  contact with the hands of the operator, its surface is very apt to be  permanently injured. _Too much attention cannot be given to cleanliness  by the workman._    [27] The rock crystal exhibits a yellow flame when first heated in the  oxy-gas flame, and most samples contain spectroscopic quantities of  lithium.    (3) When a heated tube or bulb of silica is to be expanded by blowing,  it is best not to remove it from the flame, for if that is done it will  lose its plasticity quickly unless it be large. The better plan is to  move it slightly from the \"hot spot\" into the surrounding parts of the  flame at the moment of blowing.    It is best to blow the bulb through an india-rubber tube attached to the  open end of the silica tube. At first one frequently bursts the bulbs  when doing this, but holes are easily repaired by stopping them with  plastic silica applied by the softened end of a fine rod of silica and  expanding the lump, after re-heating it, by blowing. After a few hours'  practice these mishaps gradually become rare.    I find it a good plan to interpose a glass tube packed with granulated  potash between the mouth and the silica tube. This prevents the interior  of the tube from being soiled. The purifying material must not be packed  so closely in the tube as to prevent air from passing freely through it  under a very low pressure.    It may be mentioned here that a finished tube usually contains a little  moisture, and a recognisable quantity of nitric peroxide. These may be  removed by heating the tube and drawing filtered air through it, but not  by washing, as it is difficult to obtain water which leaves no residue  on the silica.      =Making larger tubes and other apparatus of Silica.=--In order to  convert a small bulb of silica into a larger one or into a large tube,  proceed as follows:--Heat one end of a fine rod of silica and apply it  to the bulb so as to form a ring as shown in the figure. Then heat the  ring and the end of the bulb till it softens, and expand the end by  blowing. If this process is repeated, the bulb first becomes ovate and  then forms a short tube which can be lengthened at will, but the most  convenient way to obtain a very long tube "]]]
