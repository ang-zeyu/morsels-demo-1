She had then, by means of a handful of soft  soap, taken from Polly's soap-bowl during the dish-washing, and a bit of  old cotton, plastered both herself and \"Baby\" to a comfortable degree of  stickiness.    \"Phronsie,\" said Polly--\"dear me! what you doing? the big dog's out  there, you know, that scared the naughty organ-man; and the boy--\" but  before the words were half out, Phronsie had slipped from under her  hands, and to Polly's extreme dismay, clattered out into the kitchen.    \"Here she is!\" cried Jasper, meeting her at the door. The little soapy  hands were grasped, and kissing her--\"Ugh!\" he said, as the soft soap  plentifully spread on her face met his mouth.    \"Oh, Phronsie! you shouldn't,\" cried Polly, and then they all burst out  into a peal of laughter at Jasper's funny grimaces.    \"She's been washing 'Baby,\" explained Polly, wiping her eyes, and  looking at Phronsie who was hanging over Prince in extreme affection.  Evidently Prince still regarded her as his especial property.    \"Have you got a baby?\" asked Jasper. \"I thought she was the baby,\"  pointing to Phronsie.    \"Oh, I mean her littlest dolly; she always calls her 'Baby,\" said Polly.  \"Come, Phronsie, and have your face washed, and a clean apron on.\"    When Phronsie could be fairly persuaded that Prince would not run  away during her absence, she allowed herself to be taken off; and soon  re-appeared, her own, dainty little self. Ben, in the meantime, had  been initiating Jasper into the mysteries of cutting the wood, the  tool-house, and all the surroundings of the \"little brown house.\" They  had received a re-inforcement in the advent of Joel and David, who  stared delightedly at Phronsie's protector, made friends with the dog,  and altogether had had such a thoroughly good time, that Phronsie,  coming back, clapped her hands in glee to hear them.    \"I wish mammy was home,\" said Polly, polishing up the last cup  carefully.    \"Let me put it up,\" said Jasper, taking it from her, \"it goes up here,  don't it, with the rest?\" reaching up to the upper-shelf of the old  cupboard.    \"Yes,\" said Polly.    \"Oh, I should think you'd have real good times!\" said the boy,  enviously. \"I haven't a single sister or brother.\"    \"Haven't you?\" said Polly, looking at him in extreme pity. \"Yes, we do  have real fun,\" she added, answering his questioning look; \"the house is  just brimful sometimes, even if we are poor.\"    \"We aren't poor,\" said Joel, who never could bear to be pitied. Then,  with a very proud air, he said in a grand way, \"At any rate, we aren't  going to be, long, for something's coming!\"    \"What do you mean, Joey?\" asked Ben, while the rest looked equally  amazed.    \"Our ships,\" said Joel confidently, as if they were right before their  eyes; at which they all screamed!    \"See Polly's stove!\" cried Phronsie, wishing to entertain in her turn.  \"Here 'tis,\" running up to it, and pointing with her fat little finger.    \"Yes, I see,\" cried Jasper, pretending to be greatly surprised; \"it's  new, isn't it?\"    \"Yes,\" said the child; \"it's very all new; four yesterdays ago!\"    And then Polly stopped in sweeping up and related, with many additions  and explanations from the others, the history of the stove, and good Dr.  Fisher (upon whom they all dilated at great length), and the dreadful  measles, and everything. And Jasper sympathized, and rejoiced with them  to their hearts content, and altogether got so very home-like, that they  all felt as if they had known him for a year. Ben neglected his work a  little, but then visitors didn't come every day to the Peppers; so  while Polly worked away at her bread, which she was \"going to make like  biscuits,\" she said, the audience gathered in the little old kitchen was  in the merriest mood, and enjoyed everything to the fullest extent.    \"Do put in another stick, Bensie dear,\" said Polly; \"this bread won't be  fit for anything!\"    \"Isn't this fun, though!\" cried Jasper, running up to try the oven; \"I  wish I could ever bake,\" and he looked longingly at the little brown  biscuits waiting their turn out on the table.    \"You come out some day,\" said Polly, sociably, \"and we'll all try  baking--mammy'd like to have you, I know,\" feeling sure that nothing  would be too much for Mrs. Pepper to do for the protector of little  Phronsie.    \"I will!\" cried Jasper, perfectly delighted. \"You can't think how  awfully dull it is out in Hingham!\"    \"Don't you live there?\" asked Polly, with a gasp, almost dropping a tin  full of little brown lumps of dough she was carrying to the oven.    \"Live there!\" cried Jasper; and then he burst out into a merry laugh.  \"No, indeed! I hope not! Why, we're only spending the summer there,  father and I, in the hotel.\"    \"Where's your mother?\" asked Joel, squeezing in between Jasper and  his audience. And then they all felt instinctively that a very wrong  question had been asked.    \"I haven't any mother,\" said the boy, in a low voice.    They all stood quite still for a moment; then Polly said, \"I wish you'd  come out sometime; and you may bake--or anything else,\" she added; and  there was a kinder ring to her voice than ever.    No mother! Polly for her life, couldn't imagine how anybody could feel  without a mother, but the very words alone smote her heart; and there  was nothing she wouldn't have done to give pleasure to one who had done  so much for them.    \"I wish you could see our mother,\" she said, gently. \"Why, here she  comes now! oh, mamsie, dear,\" she cried. \"Do, Joe, run and take her  bundle.\"    Mrs. Pepper stopped a minute to kiss Phronsie--her baby was dearer than  ever to her now. Then her eye fell on Jasper, who stood respectfully  waiting and watching her with great interest.    \"Is this,\" she asked, taking it all in at the first glance--the boy with  the honest eyes as Ben had described him--and the big, black dog--\"is  this the boy who saved my little girl?\"    \"Oh, ma'am,\" cried Jasper, \"I didn't do much; 'twas Prince.\"    \"I guess you never'll know how much you did do,\" said Mrs. Pepper. Then  looking with a long, keen gaze into the boy's eyes that met her own so  frankly and kindly: \"I'll trust him,\" she said to herself; \"a boy with  those eyes can't help but be good.\"    \"Her eyes are just the same as Polly's,\" thought Jasper, \"just such  laughing ones, only Polly's are brown,\" and he liked her on the spot.    And then, somehow, the hubbub ceased. Polly went on with her work, and  the others separated, and Mrs. Pepper and Jasper had a long talk. When  the mother's eyes fell on Phronsie playing around on the floor, she gave  the boy a grateful smile that he thought was beautiful.    \"Well, I declare,\" said Jasper, at last, looking up at the old clock in  the corner by the side of the cupboard, \"I'm afraid I'll miss the stage,  and then father never'll let me come again. Come, Prince.\"    \"Oh, don't go,\" cried Phronsie, wailing. \"Let doggie stay! Oh, make him  stay, mammy!\"    \"I can't, Phronsie,\" said Mrs. Pepper, smiling, \"if he thinks he ought  to go.\"    \"I'll come again,\" said Jasper, eagerly, \"if I may, ma'am.\"    He looked up at Mrs. Pepper as he stood cap in hand, waiting for the  answer.    \"I'm sure we should be glad if your father'll be willing,\" she added;  thinking, proudly, \"My children are an honor to anybody, I'm sure,\" as  she glanced around on the bright little group she could call her own.  \"But be sure, Jasper,\" and she laid her hand on his arm as she looked  down into his eyes, \"that you father is willing, that's all.\"    \"Oh, yes, ma'am,\" said the boy; \"but he will be, I guess, if he feels  well.\"    \"Then come on Thursday,\" said Polly; \"and can't we bake something then,  mammy?\"    \"I'm sure I don't care,\" laughed Mrs. Pepper; \"but you won't find much  but brown flour and meal to bake with.\"    \"Well, we can pretend,\" said Polly; \"and we can cut the cakes with the  heart-shape, and they'll do for anything.    \"Oh, I'll come,\" laughed Jasper, ready for such lovely fun in the old  kitchen; \"look out for me on Thursday, Ben!\"    So Jasper and Prince took their leave, all the children accompanying  them to the gate; and then after seeing him fairly started on a smart  run to catch the stage, Prince scampering at his heels, they all began  to sing his praises and to wish for Thursday to come.    But Jasper didn't come! Thursday came and went; a beautiful, bright,  sunny day, but with no signs of the merry boy whom all had begun to  love, nor of the big black dog. The children had made all the needful  preparations with much ostentation and bustle, and were in a state of  excited happiness, ready for any gale. But the last hope had to be given  up, as the old clock ticked away hour after hour. And at last Polly  had to put Phronsie to bed, who wouldn't stop crying enough to eat her  supper at the dreadful disappointment.    \"He couldn't come, I know,\" said both Ben and Polly, standing staunchly  up for their new friend; but Joel and David felt that he had broken his  word.    \"He promised,\" said Joel, vindictively.    \"I don't believe his father'd let him,\" said Polly, wiping away a sly  tear; \"I know Jasper'd come, if he could.\"    Mrs. Pepper wisely kept her own counsel, simply giving them a kindly  caution:    \"Don't you go to judging him, children, till you know.\"    \"Well, he promised,\" said Joel, as a settler.    \"Aren't you ashamed, Joel,\" said his mother, \"to talk about any one  whose back is turned? Wait till he tells you the reason himself.\"    Joel hung his head, and then began to tease David in the corner, to make  up for his disappointment.    The next morning Ben had to go to the store after some more meal. As he  was going out rather dismally, the storekeeper, who was also postmaster,  called out, \"Oh, halloa, there!\"    \"What is it?\" asked Ben, turning back, thinking perhaps Mr. Atkins  hadn't given him the right change.

Immerse in aniline gentian violet, five to thirty       seconds.         5. Wash in water.         6. Dry and mount.         ~4. Ribbert's Method.~--         _Stain._--         Measure out and mix:        Acetic acid, glacial      12.5 c.c.      Alcohol, absolute         50.0 c.c.      Distilled water          100.0 c.c.         Warm to 36 deg. C. (e. g., in the \"hot\" incubator) and       saturate with dahlia. Filter.         METHOD.--         1. Prepare and fix films in the usual manner.         2. Cover the film with the stain and allow it to act for one       or two seconds only.         3. Wash thoroughly in water.         4. Dry and mount.      ~To Demonstrate Flagella.~    ~1. Muir's Modified Pitfield.~--This is the best method and gives the most  reliable results, for not only is the percentage of successful  preparations higher than with any other, but the bacilli and flagella  retain their relative proportions.         (a) ~Mordant.~--        Tannic acid, 10 per cent. aqueous solution            10 c.c.      Corrosive sublimate, saturated aqueous solution        5 c.c.      Alum, saturated aqueous solution                       5 c.c.      Carbolic fuchsin (Ziehl)                               5 c.c.        Mix thoroughly.    A precipitate forms which must be allowed to settle for a few hours.    Decant off the clear fluid into tubes and centrifugalise thoroughly.    This solution is at its best some four or five days after manufacture;  it keeps for about a couple of weeks, but must be re-centrifugalised  each time, before use.    (b) _Stain._--        Alum, saturated aqueous solution                 25 c.c.      Gentian violet, saturated alcoholic solution      5 c.c.    Filter.    This stain must be freshly prepared.    METHOD.--The cultivations employed should be smear agar cultures, twelve  to eighteen hours old if incubated at 37 deg. C, twenty-four to thirty  hours if incubated at 22 deg. C.    1. Remove a very small quantity of the growth by means of the platinum  spatula.    2. Emulsify it with a few cubic centimetres of distilled water in a  watch-glass, by gently moving the spatula to and fro in the water. Do  not rub up the growth on the side of the watch-glass. Some workers  prefer to use tap water, others employ normal saline solution, but  distilled water gives the best emulsion.    3. Spread a thin film of the emulsion on a newly flamed cover-slip,  using no force, but rather _leading_ the drop over the cover-slip with  the platinum loop.    4. Allow the film to dry in the air, properly protected from falling  dust.    5. Fix by passing thrice through the Bunsen flame, holding the  cover-slip whilst doing so by one corner between the finger and thumb.    6. Pour on the film as much of the mordant as the cover-glass will hold.  Grasp the cover-slip with the forceps and hold it, high above the flame,  until steam rises. Allow the steaming mordant to remain in contact with  the film two minutes.    7. Wash well in water and dry carefully.    8. Pour on the film as much of the stain as the cover-glass will hold.  Steam over the flame as before for two minutes.    9. Wash well in water.    10. Dry and mount.         ~2. \"Pitfield\" Original Method.~--         (a) _Mordant._--        Tannic acid     1 gramme      Water          10 c.c.         (b) _Stain._--        Saturated aqueous solution of alum              10 c.c.      Saturated alcoholic solution of gentian violet   1 c.c.      Distilled water                                  5 c.c.         Mix equal parts of a and b before using.         1. Prepare and fix the film in the manner described above.         2. Boil the mixture and immerse the cover-slip in it, whilst       still hot, for one minute.         3. Wash in water.         4. Examine in water; if satisfactory, dry and mount in       Canada balsam.         ~3. MacCrorrie's Method.~--         _Mordant-Stain._--         Measure out and mix.        Night blue, saturated alcoholic solution    10 c.c.      Potash alum, saturated aqueous solution     10 c.c.      Tannin, 10 per cent. aqueous solution       10 c.c.         NOTE.--The addition of gallic acid, 0.1 to 0.2 gramme, may       improve the solution, but is not necessary.         METHOD.--         1. Prepare and fix the films as above.         2. Pour some of the mordant-stain on the film and warm       gently, high above the flame, for two minutes (or place in       the \"hot\" incubator for a like period).         3. Wash thoroughly in water.         4. Dry and mount.         ~4. Loeffler's Method.~--         (a) _Mordant._--        Tannic acid, 20 per cent. aqueous solution     10 c.c.      Ferrous sulphate, saturated aqueous solution    5 c.c.      Haematoxylin solution                           3 c.c.      Carbolic acid, 1 per cent. aqueous solution     4 c.c.         This solution must be freshly prepared.         _Haematoxylin solution_ is prepared by boiling 1 gramme       logwood    with 8 c.c. distilled water, filtering and replacing the loss from  evaporation.        _Alternative Mordant_ (Bunge's Mordant).--        Tannic acid, 20 per cent. aqueous solution       10 c.c.      Ferrous sulphate, saturated aqueous solution      5 c.c.      Fuchsin, saturated alcoholic solution             1 c.c.        (b) _Stain._--        Weigh out          Methylene-blue        }          Or methylene-violet   } 4 grammes          Or fuchsin            }    and dissolve in        Aniline water, freshly saturated and filtered     100 c.c.    METHOD.--    1. Prepare and fix films as above.    2. Pour the mordant on to the film and warm cautiously over the flame  till steam rises; keep the mordant gently steaming for one minute.    3. Wash well in distilled water till no more colour is discharged; if  necessary, wash carefully with absolute alcohol.    4. Filter a few drops of the stain on to the film, warm as before, and  allow the steaming stain to act for one minute.    5. Wash well in distilled water.    6. Dry and mount.    NOTE.--The flagella of some organisms can be demonstrated better by  means of an alkaline stain or an acid stain--a point to be determined  for each. Speaking generally, those bacilli which give rise to an acid  reaction in the culture medium require an alkali; those which form  alkali in cultivation require an acid. According to requirements,  therefore, Loeffler recommends the addition of sodium hydrate, 1 per  cent. aqueous solution, 1 c.c.; or an equal quantity of an exactly  comparable solution of sulphuric acid.    ~5. Van Ermengem's Method.~--This method, being merely a precipitation of  a silver salt on the micro-organisms and not a true stain, creates a  false impression as to the relative proportions of bacteria and  flagella.          (a) _Fixing Fluid._--        Osmic acid, 2 per cent. aqueous solution        10 c.c.      Tannic acid, 20 per cent. aqueous solution      20 c.c.      Acetic acid, glacial                             1 c.c.         The fixing fluid should be prepared some days before use and       filtered as required. In colour it should be distinctly       violet.         (b) _Sensitising Solution._--         Silver nitrate, 0.5 per cent. aqueous solution.         This solution must be kept in a dark blue glass bottle or in       a dark cupboard.         Filter immediately before use.         (c) _Reducing Solution._--         Weigh out        Gallic acid                    5 grammes      Tannic acid                    3 grammes      Potassium acetate, fused      10 grammes         and dissolve in        Distilled water           350 c.c.         Filter.         This solution will keep active for several days, but fresh       solution must be used for each preparation.         METHOD.--         1. Prepare emulsion, make and fix films as above in the       preceding method, steps 1 to 4.         2. Pour on the film as much of the fixing solution as the       cover-glass will hold, heat carefully over the flame till       steam rises, and allow the steaming fixing fluid to act for       five minutes.         3. Wash well in water.         4. Wash in absolute alcohol.         5. Wash in distilled water.         6. Pour some of the sensitising solution on the film and       allow it to act for from thirty seconds to one minute; blot       off the excess of fluid with filter paper.         7. Without washing, transfer the film to a watch-glass       containing the reducing solution and allow it to remain       therein for from thirty seconds to one minute; blot off the       excess of fluid with filter paper.         8. Without washing, again treat the film with the       sensitising solution, this time until the film commences to       turn black.         9. Wash in distilled water.         10. Dry and mount.    ~To Stain Nuclei of Yeast Cells.~    1. Prepare and fix film in the usual manner.    2. Soak in ferric ammonia sulphate 3 per cent. aqueous solution for two  hours.    3. Wash thoroughly in water.    4. Stain in haematoxylin solution (see page 95) for thirty minutes.    5. Wash in water.    6. Differentiate in ferric ammonia sulphate solution for 1-1/2-2  minutes, examining wet under microscope during the process.      ~To Stain Spores.~    ~1. Single Stain.~--    1. Prepare cover-slip film in the usual way.    2. In fixing, pass the cover-slip film fifteen or thirty times through  the flame instead of only three. This destroys the resisting power of  the spore membrane and allows the stain to reach the interior.    3. Stain in the usual way with methylene-blue or fuchsin.    4. Wash in water.    5. Dry and mount.    ~2. Double Stain.~--    1. Prepare and fix film in the usual way--i. e., pass three times  through flame to fix.    2. Cover the film with hot carbol-fuchsin and hold in the forceps above  a small flame until the fluid begins to steam. Set the cover-slip down  and allow it to cool. Repeat the process when the stain ceases to steam"]]]
