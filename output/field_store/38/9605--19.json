[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26490"],[0,"Lord Milner's Work in South Africa (#16)"],[1,"must  first be possessed of some more precise information of the political  situation in the Cape Colony at this time.    [Sidenote: The Sprigg ministry.]    At the period of Lord Milner's appointment the political forces set in  motion by the Raid were operating already to prepare the way for the  new and significant combinations of persons and parties in the Cape  Colony that took definite form in the parliamentary crisis of May,  1898. The Ministry now in office was that formed by Sir Gordon Sprigg  upon Mr. Rhodes's resignation of the premiership after the Raid  (January 6th, 1896). Like every other Cape Ministry of the last  thirteen years, it was dependent upon the support of the Afrikander  Bond, which supplied two out of the six members of the cabinet--Mr.  Pieter Faure, Minister of Agriculture, and a moderate Bondsman, and  Dr. Te Water, the intimate friend of Mr. Hofmeyr, and his direct  representative in the Ministry. Another minister, Sir Thomas Upington,  who had succeeded Mr. Philip Schreiner as Attorney-General, had been  himself Prime Minister in the period 1884-6, when he and Sir Gordon  Sprigg (then Treasurer-General), had opposed the demand for the  intervention of the Imperial Government in Bechuanaland, successfully  and strenuously advocated by Mr. J. W. Leonard and Mr. Merriman. It  was, therefore, eminently, what would be called in France \"a Ministry  of the Centre.\" Sir Gordon Sprigg's regard for British interests was  too lukewarm to command the confidence of the more decided advocates  of British supremacy; while, on the other hand, his more or less  friendly relations with Mr. Rhodes aroused the suspicions of the Dutch  extremists. But Dr. Te Water's presence in the Ministry, offering in  itself a sufficient assurance that no measures deemed by Mr. Hofmeyr  to be contrary to the interests of the Bond would be adopted, had  secured for the Government the votes of the majority of the Dutch  members of the Legislative Assembly. An example of the subserviency of  the Sprigg Ministry to the Bond at this date was afforded upon Lord  Milner's arrival. As we have seen, the Home Government determined to  reinforce the South African garrison, in order to strengthen its  demand upon the Transvaal Government for the repeal of the Aliens  Immigration Law. Although no direct opposition was offered by the  Ministry to this measure, the insufficiency of barrack accommodation  in the Cape Colony was used as a pretext for placing obstacles in the  way of its accomplishment. These difficulties were successfully  overcome by Lord Milner, and in the end the reinforcements arrived  without giving rise to any political excitement.[32]             [Footnote 32: By August the South African garrison had been           raised to the very moderate strength of rather more than           8,000 troops.]    [Sidenote: Navy contribution bill.]    A more disagreeable incident was the covert attempt made by the Bond  to obstruct the business of the Cape Parliament, in order that Sir  Gordon Sprigg might be prevented from taking his place among the other  prime ministers of the self-governing colonies at the Colonial  Conference, and representing the Cape in the Jubilee celebrations in  England.[33] This was the beginning of a disagreement between the  Ministry and the Bond, which gradually increased in seriousness after  Sir Gordon's return from England, until it culminated in the  resignation of Dr. Te Water (May, 1898). The offer of an annual  contribution to the cost of the British Navy, which was affirmed in  principle by the Cape Parliament at this time, was understood in  England to be a mark of Afrikander attachment to the British  connection. In point of fact the measure received practically no  support from the Bondsmen in Parliament; while, outside of Parliament,  on Bond platforms and in the Bond Press, the Government's action in  the matter was employed as an effective argument to stimulate  disaffection in the ranks of its Dutch supporters. Mr. Hofmeyr,  however, was careful not to allow the Bond, as an organisation, to  commit itself to any overt opposition to the principle of a  contribution to the British Navy--an attitude which would have been  obviously inconsistent with the Bond's profession of loyalty--and with  characteristic irony the third reading of the Navy Contribution Bill  was eventually passed, a year later, without a division in the  Legislative Assembly by a Ministry[34] placed in office by Bond votes  for the declared purpose of opposing the policy of the Imperial  Government on the one question--the reform of the Transvaal  Administration--upon the issue of which depended the maintenance of  British supremacy in South Africa.             [Footnote 33: Sir Gordon Sprigg's long service as a minister           of the Crown fully entitled him to this honour; nor was his           presence rendered any the less desirable by the fact that Sir           Henry de Villiers, the Chief Justice, was also attending the           Jubilee in England.]             [Footnote 34: The Schreiner Ministry.]    [Sidenote: Rhodes's position.]    But circumstances of deeper significance contributed to deprive the  Sprigg Ministry of the support of the Bond, causing its majority to  dwindle, and driving Sir Gordon himself, in an increasing degree, into  the opposite camp. The British population for the first time showed a  tendency to organise itself in direct opposition to the Bond. As Sir  Gordon Sprigg grew more Imperialist, the Progressive party was formed  for parliamentary purposes; while for the purpose of combating the  Afrikander nationalist movement in general an Imperialist  organisation, called the South African League, was established with  the avowed object of maintaining British supremacy in South Africa.  Mr. Cecil Rhodes, immediately after the Raid, announced his intention  of taking no further part in the politics of the Cape Colony, and of  devoting himself, for the future, to the development of Rhodesia. But  upon his return from England, after giving evidence before the  Committee of Inquiry into the Raid, he was received with so much  warmth by the British population at Capetown in July, 1897, that he  had retracted this decision, and determined to assume the same  position of real, though not nominal, leadership of what was  afterwards the Progressive party as Mr. Hofmeyr held in the Bond. Mr.  Rhodes's return to political life, following, as it did, upon the  report of the Committee of Inquiry, aroused the most bitter hostility  against him on the part of his former associates in the Bond. And the  Sprigg Ministry, by their increasing reliance upon the new party of  which he was the leader, incurred the distrust of its Dutch supporters  to a corresponding extent. In the meantime the Bond leaders had  adopted Mr. Philip Schreiner, who was not a member of the Bond, as  their parliamentary chief in the place of Rhodes, and this new  combination was strengthened by the accession of Mr. J. X. Merriman  and Mr. J. W. Sauer. Thus the opening months of the new year, 1898,  found the population of the Cape Colony grouping itself roughly, for  the first time, into two parties with definite and mutually  destructive aims. On the one side there was the Sprigg Ministry, now  almost exclusively supported by the British section of the Cape  electorate, soon to be organised on the question of \"redistribution\"  into the Progressive party, with Rhodes as its real, though not its  recognised, leader; and on the other there was the Bond party, with  Schreiner as its parliamentary chief and Hofmeyr as its real leader,  depending in no less a degree upon the Dutch population of the  Colony, and naturally opposed to an electoral reform that threatened  to deprive this population of its parliamentary preponderance. And in  a few months' time, as we shall see, the Schreiner-Bond coalition took  for its immediate aim the prevention of British interference in the  Transvaal; while the Progressive party came, no less openly, to avow  its determination to promote and support the action of the Imperial  Government in seeking to obtain redress for the Uitlander grievances.    The movements here briefly indicated were, of course, perfectly well  known to Lord Milner as constitutional Governor of the Colony. But at  Graaf Reinet he probes the situation too deeply, and speaks with too  authoritative a tone, to allow us to suppose that the remonstrance  which he then addressed to the Cape Dutch was based upon any sources  of knowledge less assured than his own observation and experience. For  the Graaf Reinet speech is not an affair of ministers' minutes or  party programmes; it is the straight talk of a man taught by eye and  ear, and informed by direct relationships with the persons and  circumstances that are envisaged in his words. To restate our  question, which among these facts of personal observation and  experience produced the change from the ready appreciation of the Cape  Dutch, shown in the Jubilee despatch, to the earnest remonstrance of  the Graaf Reinet speech? The historian cannot claim, like the writer  of creative literature, to exhibit the working of the human mind. In  the terms of the Aristotelian formula, he can relate only what \"has\"  happened, leaving to the craftsman whose pen is enlarged and ennobled  by the universal truth of art to tell what \"must\" happen. But such  satisfaction as the lesser branch of literature can afford is at the  disposal of the reader, in \"good measure, pressed down, and running  over.\" Without assuming, then, the philosophic certainty of poetry, we  know that between the Jubilee despatch and the Graaf Reinet speech the  development of the great South African drama reached its  \"turning-point\" in the Transvaal; while in the Cape Colony Lord Milner  was learning daily more of the \"formidable personalities\" and the  \"embarrassing problems\" to which Mr. Asquith had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26500"],[0,"Anecdotes of Dogs (#16)"],[1,"of one of his journies, observed a dog watching over a dead body; and  hearing that he had been there three days without meat or drink,  ordered the body to be buried, and the dog taken care of and brought  to him. A few days afterwards there was a muster of the soldiers, so  that every man had to march in order before the king. The dog lay  quiet for some time; but when he saw the murderers of his late master  pass by, he flew upon them with extraordinary fury, barking, and  tearing their garments, and frequently turning about to the king;  which both excited the king's suspicion, and that of all who stood  about him. The men were in consequence apprehended, and though the  circumstances which appeared in evidence against them were very  slight, they confessed the crime, and were accordingly punished.    Montfaucon mentions a similar case of attachment and revenge which  occurred in France, in the reign of Charles V.[E] The anecdote has  been frequently related, and is as follows:--A gentleman named  Macaire, an officer of the king's body-guard, entertained, for some  reason, a bitter hatred against another gentleman, named Aubry de  Montdidier, his comrade in service. These two having met in the Forest  of Bondi, near Paris, Macaire took an opportunity of treacherously  murdering his brother-officer, and buried him in a ditch. Montdidier  was unaccompanied at the moment, excepting by a dog (probably a  wolf-hound), with which he had gone out, perhaps to hunt. It is not  known whether the dog was muzzled, or from what other cause it  permitted the deed to be accomplished without its interference. Be  this as it might, the hound lay down on the grave of its master, and  there remained till hunger compelled it to rise. It then went to the  kitchen of one of Aubry de Montdidier's dearest friends, where it was  welcomed warmly, and fed. As soon as its hunger was appeased the dog  disappeared. For several days this coming and going was repeated, till  at last the curiosity of those who saw its movements was excited, and  it was resolved to follow the animal, and see if anything could be  learned in explanation of Montdidier's sudden disappearance. The dog  was accordingly followed, and was seen to come to a pause on some  newly-turned-up earth, where it set up the most mournful wailings and  howlings. These cries were so touching, that passengers were  attracted; and finally digging into the ground at the spot, they found  there the body of Aubry de Montdidier. It was raised and conveyed to  Paris, where it was soon afterwards interred in one of the city  cemeteries.    The dog attached itself from this time forth to the friend, already  mentioned, of its late master. While attending on him, it chanced  several times to get a sight of Macaire, and on every occasion it  sprang upon him, and would have strangled him had it not been taken  off by force. This intensity of hate on the part of the animal  awakened a suspicion that Macaire had had some share in Montdidier's  murder, for his body showed him to have met a violent death. Charles  V., on being informed of the circumstances, wished to satisfy himself  of their truth. He caused Macaire and the dog to be brought before  him, and beheld the animal again spring upon the object of its hatred.  The king interrogated Macaire closely, but the latter would not admit  that he had been in any way connected with Montdidier's murder.    Being strongly impressed by a conviction that the conduct of the dog  was based on some guilty act of Macaire, the king ordered a combat to  take place between the officer and his dumb accuser, according to the  practice in those days between human plaintiffs and defendants. This  remarkable combat took place on the isle of Notre Dame at Paris, in  presence of the whole court. The king allowed Macaire to have a strong  club, as a defensive weapon; while, on the other hand, the only  self-preservative means allowed to the dog consisted of an empty cask,  into which it could retreat if hard pressed. The combatants appeared  in the lists. The dog seemed perfectly aware of its situation and  duty. For a short time it leapt actively round Macaire, and then, at  one spring, it fastened itself upon his throat, in so firm a manner  that he could not disentangle himself. He would have been strangled  had he not cried for mercy, and avowed his crime. The dog was pulled  from off him; but he was only liberated from its fangs to perish by  the hands of the law. The fidelity of this dog has been celebrated in  many a drama and poem, and there is a monument of him in basso relievo  still to be seen in the castle of Montargis. The dog which attracted  such celebrity has been usually called 'the dog of Montargis,' from  the combat having taken place at the chateau of that name.    The strength of these dogs must have been very great. A nobleman  informed me, that when he was a boy, and staying on a visit with the  Knight of Kerry, two Irish wolf-dogs made their escape from the place  in which they were confined, and pulled down and killed a horse, which  was in an adjoining paddock.    The following affecting anecdote of an Irish wolf-dog, called \"the dog  of Aughrim,\" affords a proof of the extraordinary fidelity of these  animals to their masters, and puts to shame the vaunted superiority of  many human brutes.    At the hard-fought battle of Aughrim, or Vidconnel, an Irish officer  was accompanied by his wolf-hound. This gentleman was killed and  stripped in the battle, but the dog remained by his body both by day  and night. He fed upon some of the other bodies with the rest of the  dogs, yet he would not allow them or anything else to touch that of  his master. When all the other bodies were consumed, the other dogs  departed, but this used to go in the night to the adjacent villages  for food, and presently to return again to the place where his  master's bones were only then left. This he continued to do from July,  when the battle was fought, until the January following, when a  soldier being quartered near, and going that way by chance, the dog,  fearing he came to disturb his master's bones, flew upon the soldier,  who, being surprised at the suddenness of the thing, unslung his  carbine, he having been thrown on his back, and killed the noble  animal. He expired with the same fidelity to the remains of his  unfortunate master, as that master had shown devotion to the cause of  his unhappy country.    In the \"Irish Penny Journal\" there is an interesting account of the  Irish wolf-dog, from which the following anecdote is taken.    In the mountainous parts of the county Tyrone, the inhabitants  suffered much from the wolves, and gave from the public fund as much  for the head of one of these animals, as they would now give for the  capture of a notorious robber on the highway. There lived in those  days an adventurer, who, alone and unassisted, made it his occupation  to destroy these ravagers. The time for attacking them was in the  night, and midnight was fixed upon for doing so, as that was their  wonted time for leaving their lairs in search of food, when the  country was at rest and all was still; then, issuing forth, they fell  on their defenceless prey, and the carnage commenced. There was a  species of dog for the purpose of hunting them, called the wolf-dog;  the animal resembled a rough, stout, half-bred greyhound, but was much  stronger. In the county Tyrone there was then a large space of ground  enclosed by a high stone wall, having a gap at each of the two  opposite extremities, and in this were secured the flocks of the  surrounding farmers. But, secure as this fold was deemed, it was often  entered by the wolves, and its inmates slaughtered. The neighbouring  proprietors having heard of the noted wolf-hunter above mentioned, by  name Rory Carragh, sent for him, and offered the usual reward, with  some addition, if he would undertake to destroy the two remaining  wolves that had committed such devastation. Carragh, undertaking the  task, took with him two wolf-dogs, and a little boy twelve years of  age, the only person who would accompany him, and repaired at the  approach of midnight to the fold in question. \"Now,\" said Carragh to  the boy, \"as the two wolves usually enter the opposite extremities of  the sheep-fold at the same time, I must leave you and one of the dogs  to guard this one while I go the other. He steals with all the caution  of a cat, nor will you hear him, but the dog will, and will give him  the first fall. If, therefore, you are not active when he is down to  rivet his neck to the ground with this spear, he will rise up and kill  both you and the dog. So good night.\"    \"I'll do what I can,\" said the little boy, as he took the spear from  the wolf-hunter's hand.    The boy immediately threw open the gate of the fold, and took his seat  in the inner part, close to the entrance, his faithful companion  crouching at his side, and seeming perfectly aware of the dangerous  business he was engaged in. The night was very dark and cold, and the  poor little boy, being benumbed with the chilly air, was beginning to  fall into a kind of sleep, when at that instant the dog, with a roar,  leaped across, and laid his mortal enemy upon the earth. The boy was  roused into double activity by the voice of his companion, and drove  the spear through the wolf's neck as he had been directed, at which  time Carragh appeared, bearing the head of the other.    This anecdote is taken from a biography of a Tyrone family, published  in Belfast in 1829.    It is now time to attempt a description of this celebrated dog, and  here our difficulties commence. Some writers have affirmed that it was  rough-coated, and had the appearance of a greyhound--       \"The greyhound! the great hound! the graceful of limb!      Rough fellow! tall fellow! &c.;\"    while others assert that it was of a mastiff-like appearance, and  smooth, strong, "]]]
