Growing political stability and continued international commitment    to Afghan reconstruction create an optimistic outlook for    maintaining improvements in the Afghan economy in 2005.

This  same hour was that of M. le gouverneur's supper also. He had a guest  to-day, and the spit turned more heavily than usual. Roast partridges,  flanked with quails and flanking a larded leveret; boiled fowls; hams,  fried and sprinkled with white wine, _cardons_ of Guipuzcoa and _la  bisque ecrevisses_: these, together with soups and _hors d'oeuvres_,  constituted the governor's bill of fare. Baisemeaux, seated at table,  was rubbing his hands and looking at the bishop of Vannes, who, booted  like a cavalier, dressed in gray and sword at side, kept talking of  his hunger and testifying the liveliest impatience. M. de Baisemeaux de  Montlezun was not accustomed to the unbending movements of his greatness  my lord of Vannes, and this evening Aramis, becoming sprightly,  volunteered confidence on confidence. The prelate had again a little  touch of the musketeer about him. The bishop just trenched on the  borders only of license in his style of conversation. As for M. de  Baisemeaux, with the facility of vulgar people, he gave himself up  entirely upon this point of his guest's freedom. \"Monsieur,\" said he,  \"for indeed to-night I dare not call you monseigneur.\"    \"By no means,\" said Aramis; \"call me monsieur; I am booted.\"    \"Do you know, monsieur, of whom you remind me this evening?\"    \"No! faith,\" said Aramis, taking up his glass; \"but I hope I remind you  of a capital guest.\"    \"You remind me of two, monsieur. Francois, shut the window; the wind may  annoy his greatness.\"    \"And let him go,\" added Aramis. \"The supper is completely served, and  we shall eat it very well without waiters. I like exceedingly to be  _tete-a-tete_ when I am with a friend.\" Baisemeaux bowed respectfully.    \"I like exceedingly,\" continued Aramis, \"to help myself.\"    \"Retire, Francois,\" cried Baisemeaux. \"I was saying that your greatness  puts me in mind of two persons; one very illustrious, the late cardinal,  the great Cardinal de la Rochelle, who wore boots like you.\"    \"Indeed,\" said Aramis; \"and the other?\"    \"The other was a certain musketeer, very handsome, very brave, very  adventurous, very fortunate, who, from being abbe, turned musketeer, and  from musketeer turned abbe.\" Aramis condescended to smile. \"From  abbe,\" continued Baisemeaux, encouraged by Aramis's smile--\"from abbe,  bishop--and from bishop--\"    \"Ah! stay there, I beg,\" exclaimed Aramis.    \"I have just said, monsieur, that you gave me the idea of a cardinal.\"    \"Enough, dear M. Baisemeaux. As you said, I have on the boots of a  cavalier, but I do not intend, for all that, to embroil myself with the  church this evening.\"    \"But you have wicked intentions, nevertheless, monseigneur.\"    \"Oh, yes, wicked, I own, as everything mundane is.\"    \"You traverse the town and the streets in disguise?\"    \"In disguise, as you say.\"    \"And you still make use of your sword?\"    \"Yes, I should think so; but only when I am compelled. Do me the  pleasure to summon Francois.\"    \"Have you no wine there?\"    \"'Tis not for wine, but because it is hot here, and the window is shut.\"    \"I shut the windows at supper-time so as not to hear the sounds or the  arrival of couriers.\"    \"Ah, yes. You hear them when the window is open?\"    \"But too well, and that disturbs me. You understand?\"    \"Nevertheless I am suffocated. Francois.\" Francois entered. \"Open the  windows, I pray you, Master Francois,\" said Aramis. \"You will allow him,  dear M. Baisemeaux?\"    \"You are at home here,\" answered the governor. The window was opened.  \"Do you not think,\" said M. de Baisemeaux, \"that you will find yourself  very lonely, now M. de la Fere has returned to his household gods at  Blois? He is a very old friend, is he not?\"    \"You know it as I do, Baisemeaux, seeing that you were in the musketeers  with us.\"    \"Bah! with my friends I reckon neither bottles of wine nor years.\"    \"And you are right. But I do more than love M. de la Fere, dear  Baisemeaux; I venerate him.\"    \"Well, for my part, though 'tis singular,\" said the governor, \"I prefer  M. d'Artagnan to him. There is a man for you, who drinks long and well!  That kind of people allow you at least to penetrate their thoughts.\"    \"Baisemeaux, make me tipsy to-night; let us have a merry time of it as  of old, and if I have a trouble at the bottom of my heart, I promise  you, you shall see it as you would a diamond at the bottom of your  glass.\"    \"Bravo!\" said Baisemeaux, and he poured out a great glass of wine and  drank it off at a draught, trembling with joy at the idea of being, by  hook or by crook, in the secret of some high archiepiscopal misdemeanor.  While he was drinking he did not see with what attention Aramis was  noting the sounds in the great court. A courier came in about eight  o'clock as Francois brought in the fifth bottle, and, although the  courier made a great noise, Baisemeaux heard nothing.    \"The devil take him,\" said Aramis.    \"What! who?\" asked Baisemeaux. \"I hope 'tis neither the wine you drank  nor he who is the cause of your drinking it.\"    \"No; it is a horse, who is making noise enough in the court for a whole  squadron.\"    \"Pooh! some courier or other,\" replied the governor, redoubling his  attention to the passing bottle. \"Yes; and may the devil take him, and  so quickly that we shall never hear him speak more. Hurrah! hurrah!\"    \"You forget me, Baisemeaux! my glass is empty,\" said Aramis, lifting his  dazzling Venetian goblet.    \"Upon my honor, you delight me. Francois, wine!\" Francois entered.  \"Wine, fellow! and better.\"    \"Yes, monsieur, yes; but a courier has just arrived.\"    \"Let him go to the devil, I say.\"    \"Yes, monsieur, but--\"    \"Let him leave his news at the office; we will see to it to-morrow.  To-morrow, there will be time to-morrow; there will be daylight,\" said  Baisemeaux, chanting the words.    \"Ah, monsieur,\" grumbled the soldier Francois, in spite of himself,  \"monsieur.\"    \"Take care,\" said Aramis, \"take care!\"    \"Of what? dear M. d'Herblay,\" said Baisemeaux, half intoxicated.    \"The letter which the courier brings to the governor of a fortress is  sometimes an order.\"    \"Nearly always.\"    \"Do not orders issue from the ministers?\"    \"Yes, undoubtedly; but--\"    \"And what to these ministers do but countersign the signature of the  king?\"    \"Perhaps you are right. Nevertheless, 'tis very tiresome when you are  sitting before a good table, _tete-a-tete_ with a friend--Ah! I beg your  pardon, monsieur; I forgot it is I who engage you at supper, and that I  speak to a future cardinal.\"    \"Let us pass over that, dear Baisemeaux, and return to our soldier, to  Francois.\"    \"Well, and what has Francois done?\"    \"He has demurred!\"    \"He was wrong, then?\"    \"However, he _has_ demurred, you see; 'tis because there is something  extraordinary in this matter. It is very possible that it was not  Francois who was wrong in demurring, but you, who are in the wrong in  not listening to him.\"    \"Wrong? I to be wrong before Francois? that seems rather hard.\"    \"Pardon me, merely an irregularity. But I thought it my duty to make an  observation which I deem important.\"    \"Oh! perhaps you are right,\" stammered Baisemeaux. \"The king's order  is sacred; but as to orders that arrive when one is at supper, I repeat  that the devil--\"    \"If you had said as much to the great cardinal--hem! my dear Baisemeaux,  and if his order had any importance.\"    \"I do it that I may not disturb a bishop. _Mordioux!_ am I not, then,  excusable?\"    \"Do not forget, Baisemeaux, that I have worn the soldier's coat, and I  am accustomed to obedience everywhere.\"    \"You wish, then--\"    \"I wish that you would do your duty, my friend; yes, at least before  this soldier.\"    \"'Tis mathematically true,\" exclaimed Baisemeaux. Francois still  waited: \"Let them send this order of the king's up to me,\" he repeated,  recovering himself. And he added in a low tone, \"Do you know what it is?  I will tell you something about as interesting as this. 'Beware of fire  near the powder magazine;' or, 'Look close after such and such a one,  who is clever at escaping,' Ah! if you only knew, monseigneur, how many  times I have been suddenly awakened from the very sweetest, deepest  slumber, by messengers arriving at full gallop to tell me, or  rather, bring me a slip of paper containing these words: 'Monsieur de  Baisemeaux, what news?' 'Tis clear enough that those who waste their  time writing such orders have never slept in the Bastile. They would  know better; they have never considered the thickness of my walls, the  vigilance of my officers, the number of rounds we go. But, indeed, what  can you expect, monseigneur? It is their business to write and torment  me when I am at rest, and to trouble me when I am happy,\" added  Baisemeaux, bowing to Aramis. \"Then let them do their business.\"    \"And do you do yours,\" added the bishop, smiling.    Francois re-entered; Baisemeaux took from his hands the minister's  order. He slowly undid it, and as slowly read it. Aramis pretended to  be drinking, so as to be able to watch his host through the glass. Then,  Baisemeaux, having read it: \"What was I just saying?\" he exclaimed.    \"What is it?\" asked the bishop.    \"An order of release! There, now; excellent news indeed to disturb us!\"    \"Excellent news for him whom it concerns, you will at least agree, my  dear governor!\"    \"And at eight o'clock in the evening!\"    \"It is charitable!\"    \"Oh! charity is all very well, but it is for that fellow who says he  is so weary and tired, but not for me who am amusing myself,\" said  Baisemeaux, exasperated.    \"Will you lose by him, then? And is the prisoner who is to be set at  liberty a good payer?\"    \"Oh, yes, indeed! a miserable, five-franc rat!\"    \"Let me see it,\" asked M. d'Herblay. \"It is no indiscretion?\"    \"By no means; read it.\"    \"There is 'Urgent,' on the paper; you have seen that, I suppose?\"    \"Oh, admirable!
