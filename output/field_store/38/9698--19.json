Si autem secundo modo, ut si quis petat per  Assisam vel per aliud Breve tenementum, ubi petere debet redditum; si  juratores dicant pro petente locus erit convictioni propter errorem rei,  si Assisa capiatur in modum Assisæ. Secus enim si in modum juratæ. Si  autem Breve competens fuerit & cum querens vel petens intentionem suam  proposuerit & tenens excipiat contra articulos Brevis & contra  intentionem & illos in toto vel in parte negaverit, tunc oportebit  querentem vel tenentem intentionem suam probare per Assisam vel per  inquisitionem.    _Ss. 12._ Et quo casu si Juratores male juraverint locus erit  convictioni quia Assisa capiatur de articulis Brevis in modum Assisæ si  sit Assisa. Si autem talis sit exceptio quæ non tangit aliquem articulum  Brevis & ex toto concedatur intentio querentis, & querela justa  videatur; elidi tamen poterit per exceptionem, ut si incidat alia actio  opposita in modum exceptionis, ut si tenens dicat se esse in possessione  & justè per conventionem vel conditionem, & hoc probare paratus sit per  Assisam, sed eliditur actio & Assisa præcedens cum denegari non poterit;  oportet igitur probare conventionem quæ est alia actio & extra Assisam,  quæ & multas habet probationes. Probatur enim quandoque per instrumentum  & per testes, quandoque per Assisam pro defectu cartæ captam in modum  juratæ de consensu partium, & si proponens probare voluerit quod dicit  exceptio nulla erit & querens obtinebit.    _Ss. 13._ Si autem querens se ponere voluerit in juratam denegetur ei  actio, & quo casu non erit locus convictioni propter consensum. Et illud  idem erit si status opponatur in modum exceptionis & fiat Assisa si  querens personam habeat standi in judicio, & quod petere possit per  Assisam, oportet quod tenens probet illum esse talem quia intentio  querentis in toto conceditur si personam habeat stanti in judicio, quo  probato vel non probato terminabitur actio, sed per parentes non debet  probatio admitti cum præjudicaretur Domino si talem excipientem petere  vellet in servitutem si probatio faceret pro servo, sed de servo  existente sub potestate Domini admitti poterit probatio per parentes, &  quo casu terminabitur quæstio status unico judicio & Assisa. Si autem  servus clamaverit in libertatem & contra Dominum objicientem super  virtutem petierit judicium si ponere se debet in Assisam de statu ante  restitutionem terræ & bonorum, cessabit judicium & alia actione opus  erit Domino, eo quod servus ad aliam responsionem compelli non debet dum  tamen in statu fuerit libero nisi gratis hoc voluerit; probare enim  poterit tenens exceptionem suam multis modis, sicut per parentes  petentis si eos ad manum habuerit, & sinon, alium diem ipsos habere  sufficiet, & si nullos habuerit per instrumentum exceptionis vel in fine  per Assisam si aliam non habet probationem: contra quam petens replicare  poterit multipliciter. Dicere enim poterit quod liber sit & paratus se  liberum probare per parentes, vel per instrumentum manumissionis, vel  per privilegium. Si autem nihil replicando proposuerit petens, tunc in  fine per Assisam in modum juratæ captam judicabitur, nec ei  præjudicabitur imposterum quoad statum quamvis jurator contra eum  fecerit, nec erit locus convictioni cum non capiatur in modum Assisæ.  Servitus enim opposita nihil tangit Assisam magis quam conventio, sed  semper manet Assisa integra quamvis per exceptiones fuerit elisa. Si  autem capta fuerit Assisa in absentia tenentis, vel cum præsens fuerit  non exceperit sed statim se posuerit in Assisam sive juratores dicant  pro uno sive pro alio in articulis Brevis & falso cum dicant fortè  conventionem intervenisse, vel quod querens servus sit vel bastardus cum  non sit, vel aliud quid tale quod loco exceptionis proponatur à tenente,  locus erit convictioni quia Assisa capta est in modum Assisæ licet quasi  de consensu partium. Si autem cum tenens absens fuerit nil dicatur  contra Assisam ex providentia discreti Justiciarii tenentur juratores  reddere rationem de veredicto suo, & si postmodum de convictione agatur  per justam ignorantiam & per justum errorem poterunt juratores excusari.  In magna autem Assisa non jacet convictio eo quod tenens gratis & non de  necessitate ponit eum in magnam Assisam, cum in electione sit ejus vel  duellum.    _Ss. 14._ Item, est quoddam Sacramentum quod à parte parti defertur in  judicio in quo nulla sequitur convictio, & similiter à judice parti,  sufficiat enim Dominum ultorem expectare.    _Ss. 15._ Item, de dampnis nulla sequitur convictio sed potius  certificatio, ut si juratores nimis gravaverint disseisitorem in  dampnis.    _Ss. 16._ Item, in purgationibus nec in defensionibus per Legem contra  sectam productam, nec in inquisitionibus juratis generaliter locum  habebit convictio. Sunt tamen quædam juratæ speciales quæ quandoque  convictionem admittunt, ex gratia tamen Principis per constitutionem.    _Ss. 17._ Si autem in juramento vel judicio aliquando sit erratum  videndum erit si error sit excusabilis vel non, ab hoc quod mitigetur  poena.    _Ss. 18._ Si autem crassa sit ignorantia ut si factum de facili sciri  non possit nisi per præsumptionem, ut si conventio vel contractus  aliquis sit factus in occulto ita quod pauci præsentes exiterint, talis  error excusabilis est. Si autem in publico & palam, ita quod omnes de  patria vel quasi hoc sciverint & soli juratores hoc ignoraverint vel  dubitaverint, non excusantur à perjurio. Si autem factum narraverint  sicut veritas se habuit & Justiciarii secundùm narrationem suam  judicaverint, judicium potiùs erit fatuum quam falsum, cum credant tale  judicium tale sequi factum, falsum tamen erit judicium: necessaria est  igitur diligens examinatio Judicis in omni Assisa & errorem redigant in  veritatem, & cum obscurum sit judicium recurrendum erit ad majus  Consilium; de singulis enim dubitare non est inutile, & velox Consilium  sequitur p[oen]itentia.    _Ss. 19._ Non enim competit cuicunque petenti convictio, sed ipsi tantum  cui competit Assisa sicut ipsi qui in seisina fuerit nomine proprio &  non alieno. Nec ad eosdem Justiciarios pertinebit captio convictionis,  certificationis & Assisæ nisi recenter convictio petatur, in quo casu  capi poterit sine Brevi ex Officio judicis ex virtute sui waranti, quia  cum cui aliqua causa delegetur omnia videntur ei concessa sine quo causa  explicari non possit. Cum igitur convictio & certificatio ex Assisa  dependeant nec sine convictione vel certificatione plenè terminari  possit Assisa ad ipsum merito pertinebit capere convictionem &  certificationem cui competit plena jurisdictio capiendi Assisam. Post  tempus autem transibit judicium Assisæ in rem judicatam nec sine Brevi  deinceps capi non poterunt, & quamvis hujusmodi exceptiones,  convictiones vel certificationes extra comitatum capiantur, non tamen  præjudicabitur carta de libertatibus eo quod aliud privilegium habet  Assisa & aliud jurata.    _Ss. 20._ Per hoc autem quod forma Brevis originalis inseri debet in  Brevi de convictione, videtur aptè quod convictio tantum locum habet de  articulis in Brevibus Assisæ contentis ubi ulla objicitur exceptio, sed  capitur in modum Assisæ & quod ubi excipitur de conventione vel  opponitur causa status vel hujusmodi locum non habet convictio, quia  vertitur Assisa in juratam ad inquirendum de exceptione si dedicatur,  vel si non fiat secundum conventionem eo quod necessitas juris partes ad  hoc compellit.    _Ss. 21._ Impetrato igitur Brevi ex parte summonitoris bene poterit  summonitus diem ad suum essoniari, & cum alio die præsentes fuerint  parte, & 24 non venerint, detur alius dies & 24 attachientur quod sint  ad illum diem, præsentibus itaque juratoribus & querente, si summonitus  non venerit, attachietur. Et si querens non venerit præsente illo de quo  queritur recedat jurata sine die, expectato tamen quarto die  summonitionis & plegii pro querente de prosequendo in misericordia.    _Ss. 22._ Cum autem partes in judicio comparuerint in præsentia 12. &  24. summonitus nihil exceperit contra juratores nec alio modo quare  convictio debet remanere ad tempus vel imperpetuum, tunc imprimis  audiatur recordum Assisæ secundum quod capta fuerit, & inquiratur à  querente in quo vel in quibus 12 juratores falsum fecerint sacramentum  in articulis brevis vel etiam in quæstionibus vel exceptionibus si  Assisa capta fuerit in modum Assisæ, & ubi nulla fuerit proposita  exceptio à tenente, sed dicta post sacramentum à juratoribus, & quo casu  locus erit convictioni si juratores male juraverint in exceptionibus  sicut in articulis principalibus in brevi comprehensis, & secundum quod  ita fuerint sicut querens dicit vel non procedat jurata per sacramentum  24.    _Ss. 22._ Jurare debent in modum juratæ, & non in modum assisæ, & cum  juraverint justiciarius ostendat eis formam querelæ & super quibus  dicere debeat veritatem, utrum videlicet ille qui queritur justè fuerit  disseisitus, vel non & rationem dicti querentis eis exprimat, & secundum  quod dixerint pro una parte vel pro alia sequitur absolutio vel  condemnatio. Et cum 24 pronuntiare veredictum suum sint parati,  diligenter in pronuntiatione sunt à justiciario examinandi, ut dictum  suum rationibus probabilibus vel saltem manifestis præsumptionibus  affirment.    _Ss. 24._ Decipi enim poterunt 24 sicut & decepti fuerunt primi  juratores, & quo sequeretur falsa pronuntiatio vel fatua. Si autem  discordes inveniantur 24 in veredicto suo associentur eis alii pro  afforciamento. Si autem nihil sciverint de veritate intercedentibus  interrogationibus & examinationibus, remanebit suo loco possessio, eo  quod querens nihil probat, & idem erit si dubitaverint.

Some dogs show a great dislike to, strenuously fighting with, the collar  and chain; others will exhibit the most piteous distress, by squatting  upon their hocks, and whining, while they pant vehemently, and look  imploringly up to the face of their leader. The first are probably not  aware of the intention of the bonds to which they are subjected, and  should not be harshly rebuked. The voice ought to assure them, and means  be resorted to calculated to allay their fears. Gentleness and firmness  will in two or three days render such animals perfectly submissive for  ever after. The last kind are rank impostors. No one not familiar with  these animals would credit the arts which they can with such excellent  effect and apparent genuineness practise to gain their ends. They have  been used to be carried, and they prefer riding in the arms of a human  being. Their insinuating tricks ought to be rewarded only by laughter,  accompanied with an admonition.    Dogs are very intelligent. They understand much more than men choose to  give them credit for. Their pride is enormous, and through this feeling  they are easily moved. Laughter, when directed against himself, no dog can  endure, and the slightest reprimand is always answered by an immediate  change of aspect. Rather than have their dignity offended, dogs will  quickly become honest, especially when deceit is experienced to be of no  avail. People who are physiognomists may detect this sentiment impressed  upon the countenance. Upon the next page is a portrait of a Mastiff. Mark  the absolute Asiatic dignity, only outwardly slurred over by a  heedlessness of behaviour. Does it not seem as though the creature,  through very pride reposing upon strength, was above forms? Who could  think of laughing at such gravity? Would it not be like ridiculing nature  to insult one who has such outward claims to our respect?    Sporting dogs will always take the exercise that is beneficial, and for  such the cold bath is much to be recommended. Only in skin diseases should  the tepid bath be resorted to. It is of much service when the skin is hot  and inflamed, but after it, exercise ought not to be neglected. For  healthy animals the hot or warm bath should never be employed; but the sea  is frequently as beneficial to dogs as to their owners; only always  bearing in mind that the head should be preserved dry.    [Illustration: THE MASTIFF.]    Vermin often are very troublesome to dogs, and I have known these animals  destroyed because their owners were ignorant of the process by which the  annoyance might have been readily conquered. There are many powerful drugs  recommended by different writers to effect this end; but though all of  them are sufficiently potent to annihilate the parasite, most of them are  also strong enough to kill the dog. When fleas are numerous, the dog must  be taken from the place where it has been accustomed to sleep. The bed  must be entirely removed, and the kennel sluiced--not merely washed--with  boiling water, after which it ought to be painted over with spirits of  turpentine. The dog itself ought to be washed with eggs and water, as  before directed; but with the yelk of every egg a teaspoonful of spirits  of turpentine should be blended. After this, the animal should have pine  shavings to sleep upon, and if these are frequently renewed, the annoyance  will seldom be again complained of. As, however, exceptional cases will  always start up, should the tribe not be entirely dispersed, the washing  must be repeated; or if from want of time or other cause it be  inconvenient to renew that operation, a little powdered camphor rubbed  into the coat will mostly abate and often eradicate the nuisance.    Lice often cover the body of the dog, and especially crowd upon its head  around the eyes and lips. There need be no dread of their presence, since  these vermin will not live upon the human being, though similar to the  kind which will. When they are perceived, the dog should be carried into  some place in which grease stains are not of much consequence. It ought  then to be covered with castor oil till the hair is completely saturated.  In this state it should be allowed to remain at least twelve hours, at the  expiration of which time the oil may be removed with yelk of eggs and  water: only an additional number of eggs will be required. As to the  quantity of castor oil which may be necessary, a moderate-sized dog with a  long coat will require about a pound, and a large Newfoundland four times  that amount. The process, as might be anticipated, operates upon the  bowels; but I have never found it to do so with any dangerous power; on  the contrary, the laxative effect is generally in these cases beneficial.    Medicine to the dog requires to be administered with caution. The nostrums  which are so particularly recommended by grooms and farriers ought never  to be made use of. The veterinary surgeon is less likely to commit error;  but there are, however, few of the profession who devote attention to the  dog with the zeal which the comprehension of its diseases and their  treatment demand. Huntsmen and gamekeepers are generally from practical  experience not altogether inapt dog doctors, where the larger and more  robust kind of animal is to be treated, but for the smaller and petted  species these persons ought not to be consulted. Many of their receipts  are harsh--not a few of them inoperative--and some even dangerous; while  all for the most part are pushed down at random, or in total ignorance of  any effect the agents employed may induce beyond the intended one of doing  good or working a certain cure. Nevertheless, with the kind of animals  generally entrusted to their charge, such persons are so far successful  that, in the absence of better advice, they deserve to be consulted for  the larger species of dogs. The human physician will also, on occasions,  be enabled to prescribe advantageously for the canine race; but not  knowing the treatment of the diseases, and the symptoms being too often  deceptive, the highest opinions are by no means to be absolutely relied  upon.    Dog-doctoring is, in fact, a separate branch of science so intricate as to  call for intense study strengthened by constant observation. No one not  attached to the animal should attempt to master it, for success in such a  case would be hopeless. The annoyances are so great that the patience is  continually being tried; and the facts on which reliance can be placed are  so few, that he who is content to depend upon the received assertions will  never be able to realize his expectation. Nothing is more erroneous than  to believe that there is any close analogy between man and the dog in the  operation of medicinal substances. Aloes, rhubarb, &c., are not purgatives  to the dog; but castor oil, which to the human being is a gentle laxative,  to the dog is an active purge; while Epsom salts are a violent hydragogue  to the canine patient, producing copious and watery stools. Common salt is  in large doses a poison, and in apparent small quantities is so strong an  emetic as to be dangerous. Salivation speedily ensues upon the use of  minute quantities of mercury, which therefore cannot be considered safe in  the hands of the general practitioner. Secale cornutum has little specific  action beyond that of inducing vomiting; and strychnia cannot be with  security administered, on account of its poisonous operation upon the  animal. Other instances, casting more than suspicion upon the inferences  which every writer upon Materia Medica draws from the action of drugs  given to dogs, could easily be quoted, but they would here be somewhat  out of place; and probably sufficient has been said to check a dangerous  reliance upon results that admit of no positive deduction.    It is painful to peruse the \"_experiments_\" made especially by the French  authors. We read that so much of some particular agent caused death to a  dog in such a period; but he must be wise indeed who learns anything from  statements of this kind. The word dog represents animals of various sizes  and very diverse constitutions; therefore no conclusion can be drawn from  an assertion that does not embrace every particular. Unfortunately,  however, the operators think it no disgrace to their scientific  attainments to put forth such loose and idle assertions; nor do they seem  to hold it derogatory to their intelligence that they assume to reach a  show of certainty by experimentalising upon a creature about which, as  their reports bear witness, they literally know nothing. Equally  unsatisfactory are the surgical and physiological experiments made upon  these creatures. No results deduced from such acts can be of the slightest  importance. The anatomy of the dog is not by them generally understood.  There is no book upon this subject that is deserving of commendation; and,  to instance the ignorance which prevails even in places where a  superficial knowledge ought to exist, I will mention but one circumstance.    At the Royal Veterinary College there is a professor of Particular  Anatomy, whose duty it is specially to instruct the pupils concerning the  dog. The lectures, however, embrace but little, and that little is  principally devoted to wandering remarks upon the osseous structure. Of  the value of such teaching some opinion may be formed when the skeleton at  the College actually exhibits the bones placed in wrong or unnatural  situations. After the proof thereby afforded, with what reliance can any  sane mind accept the awful declarations of those anatomists who, upon the  living bodies of these creatures, have, according to their own accounts,  exhibited a nicety and certainty of skill which the profoundest  acquaintance with the"]]]
