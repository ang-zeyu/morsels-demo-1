He is also found in parts  of the East and in the Sunny South.  He is a great climber and is  perfectly at home in trees or among rocks.  He eats seeds, grain,  many kinds of nuts, leaves and other parts of plants.  In the  colder sections he lays up stores for winter.\"    \"What kind of a home does he have?\" asked Happy Jack.    \"His home usually is a very remarkable affair,\" replied Old Mother  Nature.  \"It depends largely on where he is.  When he is living in  rocky country, he makes it amongst the rocks.  In some places he  burrows in the ground.  But more often it is on the surface of the  ground--a huge pile of sticks and thorns in the very middle of  which is his snug, soft nest.  The sticks and thorns are to protect  it from enemies.  When he lives down where cactus grow, those queer  plants with long sharp spines, he uses these, and there are few  enemies who will try to pull one of these houses apart to get at him.    \"When he is alarmed or disturbed, he has a funny habit of drumming on  the ground with his hind feet in much the same way that Peter Rabbit  and Jumper the Hare thump, only he does it rapidly.  Sometimes he  builds his house in a tree.  When he finds a cabin in the woods he  at once takes possession, carrying in a great mass of sticks and  trash.  He is chiefly active at night, and a very busy fellow he  is, trading and collecting.  He has none of the mean disposition  of Robber the Brown Rat.  Mrs. Trader has two to five babies at  a time and raises several families in a year.  As I said before,  Trader is one of the most interesting little people I know of, and  he does very, very funny things.    \"Now we come to the handsomest member of the family, Longfoot the  Kangaroo Rat, so called because of his long hind legs and tail and  the way in which he sits up and jumps.  Really he is not a member  of the Rat branch of the family, but closely related to the Pocket  Mice.  You see, he has pockets in his cheeks.\"    \"Like mine?\" asked Striped Chipmunk quickly.    \"No, they are on the outside instead of the inside of his cheeks.  Yours are inside.\"    \"I think mine must be a lot handier,\" asserted Striped Chipmunk,  nodding his head in a very decided way.    \"Longfoot seems to think his are quite satisfactory,\" replied Old  Mother Nature.  \"He really is handsome, but he isn't a bit vain  and is very gentle.  He never tries to bite when caught and taken  in a man's hand.\"    \"But you haven't told us how big he is or what he looks like,\"  protested impatient Peter.    \"When he sits up or jumps he looks like a tiny Kangaroo.  But that  doesn't mean anything to you, and you are no wiser than before,  for you never have seen a Kangaroo,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"In the first place he is about the size of Striped Chipmunk.  That is, his body is about the size of Striped Chipmunk's; but  his tail is longer than his head and body together.\"    \"My, it must be some tail!\" exclaimed Peter Rabbit admiringly.    Old Mother Nature smiled.  \"It is,\" said she.  \"You would like that  tail, Peter.  His front legs are short and the feet small, but his  hind legs are long and the feet big.  Of course you have seen  Nimbleheels the Jumping Mouse, Peter.\"    Peter nodded.  \"Of course,\" he replied.  \"My how that fellow can jump!\"    \"Well, Longfoot is built on the same plan as Nimbleheels and for the  same purpose,\" continued Old Mother Nature.  \"He is a jumper.\"    \"Then I know what that long tail is for,\" cried Peter.  \"It is to  keep him balanced when he is in the air so that he can jump straight.\"    \"Right again, Peter,\" laughed Old Mother Nature.  \"That is just what  it is for.  Without it, he never would know where he was going to  land when he jumped.  As I told you, he is a handsome little fellow.  His fur is very soft and silky.  Above, it is a pretty yellowish-brown,  but underneath it is pure white.  His cheeks are brown, he is white  around the ears, and a white stripe crosses his hips and keeps right  on along the sides of his tail.  The upper and under parts of his  tail are almost or quite black, and the tail ends in a tuft of long  hair which is pure white.  His feet are also white.  His head is  rather large for his size, and long.  He has a long nose.  Longfoot  has a number of cousins, some of them much smaller than he, but they  all look very much alike.\"    \"Where do they live?\" asked Johnny Chuck, for Johnny had been unable  to stay away from school another day.    \"In the dry, sandy parts of the Southwest, places so dry that it  seldom rains, and water is to be found only long distances apart,\"  replied Old Mother Nature.    \"Then how does Longfoot get water to drink?\" demanded Chatterer the  Red Squirrel.    \"He gets along without drinking,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"Such  moisture as he needs he gets from his food.  He eats seeds, leaves  of certain plants and tender young plants just coming up.  He  burrows in the ground and throws up large mounds of earth.  These  have several entrances.  One of these is the main entrance, and  during the day this is often kept closed with earth.  Under the  mound he has little tunnels in all directions, a snug little bedroom  and storerooms for food.  He is very industrious and dearly loves  to dig.    \"Longfoot likes to visit his relatives sometimes, and where there  are several families living near together, little paths lead from  mound to mound.  He comes out mostly at night, probably because he  feels it to be safer then.  Then, too, in that hot country it is  cooler at night.  The dusk of early evening is his favorite  playtime.  If Longfoot has a quarrel with one of his relatives they  fight, hopping about each other, watching for a chance to leap and  kick with those long, strong hind feet.  Longfoot sometimes drums  with his hind feet after the manner of Trader the Wood Rat.    \"Now I think this will do for this morning.  If any of you should  meet Whitefoot the Wood Mouse, tell him to come to school to-morrow  morning.  And you might tell Danny Meadow if you little folks want  school to continue.\"    \"We do!\" cried Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare and Happy Jack  Squirrel and Chatterer the Red Squirrel and Striped Chipmunk and  Johnny Chuck as one.        CHAPTER XV  Two Unlike Little Cousins    Whitefoot the Wood Mouse is one of the smallest of the little people  who live in the Green Forest.  Being so small he is one of the most  timid.  You see, by day and by night sharp eyes are watching for  Whitefoot and he knows it.  Never one single instant, while he is  outside where sharp eyes of hungry enemies may see him, does he  forget that they are watching for him.  To forget even for one little  minute might mean--well, it might mean the end of little Whitefoot,  but a dinner for some one with a liking for tender Mouse.    So Whitefoot the Wood Mouse rarely ventures more than a few feet  from a hiding place and safety.  At the tiniest sound he starts  nervously and often darts back into hiding without waiting to find  out if there really is any danger.  If he waited to make sure he  might wait too long, and it is better to be safe than sorry.  If you  and I had as many real frights in a year, not to mention false frights,  as Whitefoot has in a day, we would, I suspect, lose our minds.  Certainly we would be the most unhappy people in all the Great World.    But Whitefoot isn't unhappy.  Not a bit of it.  He is a very happy  little fellow.  There is a great deal of wisdom in that pretty  little head of his.  There is more real sense in it than in some  very big heads.  When some of his neighbors make fun of him for  being so very, very timid he doesn't try to pretend that he isn't  afraid.  He doesn't get angry.  He simply says:    \"Of course I'm timid, very timid indeed.  I'm afraid of almost  everything.  I would be foolish not to be.  It is because I am  afraid that I am alive and happy right now.  I hope I shall never  be less timid than I am now, for it would mean that sooner or  later I would fail to run in time and would be gobbled up.  It  isn't cowardly to be timid when there is danger all around.  Nor  is it bravery to take a foolish and needless risk.  So I seldom  go far from home.  It isn't safe for me, and I know it.\"    This being the way Whitefoot looked at matters, you can guess how  he felt when Chatterer the Red Squirrel caught sight of him and  gave him Old Mother Nature's message.    \"Hi there, Mr. Fraidy!\" shouted Chatterer, as he caught sight  of Whitefoot darting under a log.  \"Hi there!  I've got a message  for you!\"    Slowly, cautiously, Whitefoot poked his head out from beneath the  old log and looked up at Chatterer.  \"What kind of a message?\" he  demanded suspiciously.    \"A message you'll do well to heed.  It is from Old Mother Nature,\"  replied Chatterer.    \"A message from Old Mother Nature!\" cried Whitefoot, and came out  a bit more from beneath the old log.    \"That's what I said, a message from Old Mother Nature, and if you  will take my advice you will heed it,\" retorted Chatterer.  \"She  says you are to come to school with the rest of us at sun-up  to-morrow morning.\"    Then Chatterer explained about the school and where it was held  each morning and what a lot he and his friends had already learned  there.  Whitefoot listened with something very like dismay in his  heart.  That place where school was held was a long way off.  That  is, it was a long way for him, though to Peter Rabbit or Jumper the  Hare it wouldn't have seemed long at all.  It meant that he would  have to leave all his hiding places and the thought made him shiver.    But Old Mother Nature had sent for him and not once did he even  think of disobeying.  \"Did you say that school begins at sun-up?\"  he asked, and when Chatterer nodded Whitefoot sighed.  It was a  sigh of relief."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24416"],[0,"Life and Work in Benares and Kumaon, 1839-1877 (#16)"],[1," feel the glory of Kasee, the Splendid  City, had departed, when, stripped of its sacredness, crowds of pilgrims  no longer filled its streets, frequented its temples, or bathed at its  ghats. They would feel as the Jews did in their dark and disastrous  days, when the ways to Zion were untrodden, and there was the silence of  desolation within its gates.    When the peculiarities of Benares are in any degree realized, the work  of making known the gospel to its inhabitants may appear formidable to  the extent of hopelessness.    It is formidable, very formidable, but it can appear hopeless only when  we forget the command of our Saviour to preach the Gospel to every  creature, when we forget the power of the truth, the adaptation of the  Gospel to the human heart, its past triumphs, and the promised aid of  the Holy Spirit. The very strength of this fortress of idolatry should  call forth the courage of Christ's soldiers by directing their eyes to  Him as their great and glorious Leader. Such was the courage of the  Apostles and their immediate successors, when instead of going to small  towns and villages, and working from them towards the cities where the  Gospel might be expected to meet with the most determined opposition,  they assailed at once with their spiritual weapons the high places of  idolatry, of power which claimed worship as well as homage, and of  learning which aimed in its own strength, and aimed unsuccessfully, at  the solution of the deepest questions which affect mankind. They went to  Ephesus, to Rome, and to Athens, and secured in them a measure of  success, which prepared the way for a mighty revolution throughout the  Roman Empire.    Towards the end of the last century, when there was a great awakening of  the missionary spirit, devoted Christians, animated by apostolic  example, formed the purpose of going with the Gospel to Benares. Robert  Haldane sold a fine estate, that with a band of chosen companions he  might preach the Gospel to its inhabitants. He was obliged to abandon  the enterprise by the prohibition of the East India Company; and then,  in company with his brother and others similarly minded, he turned to  home mission work, which for a time was prosecuted by them with ardent  zeal and great success.    [Sidenote: HINDUISM AND CHRISTIANITY.]    In 1781 the city and district of Benares, which had for some time paid  tribute to our Government, were brought directly under our rule. We are  sure no Christian missionary would have been previously tolerated in  Benares for a day. He could not speak of Jesus Christ as the Lord of all  and the Saviour of the world without implying that Mahadeo and the other  gods of Benares were no God. His teaching would be speedily discerned in  its antagonism to the genius of the place, and would ensure his speedy  expulsion, if not his death. To the present hour no missionary is  allowed to plant his foot in Mecca, or Medina, the sacred cities of the  Muhammadans. Till a very recent period, when the Pope's political power  came to an end, no Protestant minister was allowed to open his mouth in  proclaiming the Gospel in Rome. The mild Hindu can be as fanatical as  the Muhammadan and the Roman Catholic in resenting an attack on his  religion, and in persecuting its opponents.    We have no historical records from which we can learn how Buddhism was  overthrown in India; but, as we have already observed, we have reason to  conclude it was not overthrown by argument and persuasion, but by fire  and sword. The intense hatred shown to the Gospel by those who are  imbued by the spirit of Hinduism will not allow us to doubt that, if  they had the power, they would forbid all Christian effort, and  especially such effort in their sacred city. They were long under the  rule of the Muhammadans, and were subjected by them to grievous  indignities, which they were helpless to avert or resent; but their  attachment to Hinduism, instead of being diminished, was inflamed by the  treatment they received, and during the semi-independent position they  held previous to coming under our sway they had both the power and the  will effectually to prevent the entrance of a new antagonistic religion.  The superior strength and daring of the English were so signally shown  in the overthrow of Rajah Cheit-Singh by Warren Hastings, that  opposition to the new _regime_ was seen to be hopeless, and the people  quietly submitted to their new rulers. So far as they knew the temper  and policy of the English, they might conclude their religion would at  their hands not only be safe from violence, but protected from every  attempt at proselytism. The policy which would have left Hinduism  undisturbed was successfully opposed by the Christian feeling of  England, and the way was opened for the Christian missionary into the  very fortress of Hindu idolatry. For this entrance we are not in any way  indebted to the mildness of Hindu religionists, but to the resolute,  persevering, courageous effort of men of God, who contended successfully  against the worldly selfishness which would have doomed the millions of  India to perpetual night.    [Sidenote: STREET PREACHING.]    We have observed that mission operations were tentatively begun in  Benares in the second decade of this century. The work was carried on in  a very quiet unostentatious manner. Some time elapsed before any open  aggressive effort was put forth. If Bishop Heber's counsel had been  followed there would have been no departure from the first timid mode  of action. He says in his journal, \"The custom of street preaching, of  which the Baptist and other Dissenting missionaries in Bengal are very  fond, has never been resorted to by those employed by the Church  Missionary Society, and never shall be so long as I have any influence  or authority over them. I plainly see it is not necessary, and I see no  less plainly that though it may be safe among the timid Bengalees, it  would be very likely to produce mischief here. All which the  missionaries do is to teach schools, read prayers, and preach in their  churches, and to visit the houses of such persons as wish for  information on religious subjects.\" If the good man had lived a few  years longer he would have seen ministers of his own Church forward in  modes of action which he disapproved, and would doubtless have wished  them God-speed, as his successors in the diocese of Calcutta have done.  The Bishop of Lahore, Dr. French, took a prominent part for years in  outdoor preaching.    The missionary has of course met with opposition in many forms; the  opposition has often been keen and bitter, but it has not taken the form  of violence to person or injury to property. The Gospel has been for  many years proclaimed in the most public places in Benares, crowds have  heard it, and no hand has been raised against the preacher. In the  memoirs of the Rev. William Smith, of the Church Mission, who was  indefatigable in evangelistic labour, than whom none was better known in  Benares, it is mentioned that on a few occasions mud was thrown at him,  but it did him no harm. On one occasion, after a very keen discussion,  when my Hindu opponents had been extremely angry, on coming out from the  place a native Christian by my side was struck on the head by a stone,  which was evidently intended for me. Happily the young man speedily  recovered from the blow. The night was dark, and the act was not brought  home to any one. The people present expressed indignation at the deed.  On another occasion a man drew his sword half-way out of the scabbard  (it was the fashion of the time to go about armed), and said he would  gladly cut off my head, because I was trying to turn away his people  from their religion; but he knew if he did he would be hanged, and as he  wished to live a little longer he restrained himself. He gave me a  scowl, which showed how ready he was for the crime if he could commit it  with impunity. On another occasion most vigorous drumming was carried on  above our heads, which made speaking and hearing impossible. As after  many years spent in Benares I cannot recollect any more violent acts  than those I have mentioned, the reader may infer how little reason we  have to complain of danger to life or limb.    [Sidenote: POSITION OF THE MISSIONARY IN BENARES.]    Nothing approaching the treatment of Dr. Kalley by the Popish priests of  Madeira has been ever experienced by any missionary in Benares at the  hand of Hindu priests. The perfect security, with which in ordinary  times we went about our work, is in marked contrast to the experience of  many a labourer in the home mission-field, not only in the early days of  Methodism, but down to our own time, to say nothing of the violence to  which the Salvation Army has been exposed. The fact that we belong to  the ruling race, and that it is understood by all an attack on us will  be promptly and severely punished, has had, no doubt, much to do in  enabling us to carry on our operations so quietly and safely. There has  been an ebullition at times on the occasion of baptisms, but it has  soon subsided. Gradually the people have come to understand us  sufficiently to be convinced we are bent on promoting their good, and  they regard us in consequence with a friendly feeling. Most pleasant  proof has been given that many of the inhabitants of Benares have come  to look on missionaries not only with respect but affection. I well  remember gratifying acts of courtesy and kindness, which could not have  been prompted by sinister motives.    I must not omit to say that while missionaries have carried on their  work openly and boldly, they have felt themselves bound to treat the  people courteously, and to abstain from the use of violent and abusive  words. There are places where they do not deem themselves entitled to  declare their message--such as sacred places where worship is being  carried on. Mr. Smith, of"]]]
