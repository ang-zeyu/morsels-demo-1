Their father, paternal uncles, paternal grandfather,  and granduncles all suffered in the same way from headaches, which ceased at  the age of fifty-four or fifty-five in all those who lived so long. None of  the females of the family were affected. (14/44. These cases are given by Mr.  Sedgwick on the authority of Dr. H. Stewart in 'Med.-Chirurg. Review' April  1863 pages 449, 477.)]    It is impossible to read the foregoing accounts, and the many others which  have been recorded, of diseases coming on during three or even more  generations in several members of the same family at the same age, especially  in the case of rare affections in which the coincidence cannot be attributed  to chance, and to doubt that there is a strong tendency to inheritance in  disease at corresponding periods of life. When the rule fails, the disease is  apt to come on earlier in the child than in the parent; the exceptions in the  other direction being very much rarer. Dr. Lucas (14/45. 'Hered. Nat.' tome 2  page 852.) alludes to several cases of inherited diseases coming on at an  earlier period. I have already given one striking instance with blindness  during three generations; and Mr. Bowman remarks that this frequently occurs  with cataract. With cancer there seems to be a peculiar liability to earlier  inheritance: Sir J. Paget, who has particularly attended to this subject, and  tabulated a large number of cases, informs me that he believes that in nine  cases out of ten the later generation suffers from the disease at an earlier  period than the previous generation. He adds, \"In the instances in which the  opposite relation holds, and the members of later generations have cancer at a  later age than their predecessors, I think it will be found that the non-  cancerous parents have lived to extreme old ages.\" So that the longevity of a  non-affected parent seems to have the power of influencing the fatal period in  the offspring; and we thus apparently get another element of complexity in  inheritance.    The facts, showing that with certain diseases the period of inheritance  occasionally or even frequently advances, are important with respect to the  general descent-theory, for they render it probable that the same thing would  occur with ordinary modifications of structure. The final result of a long  series of such advances would be the gradual obliteration of characters proper  to the embryo and larva, which would thus come to resemble more and more  closely the mature parent-form. But any structure which was of service to the  embryo or larva would be preserved by the destruction at this stage of growth  of each individual which manifested any tendency to lose its proper character  at too early an age.    Finally, from the numerous races of cultivated plants and domestic animals, in  which the seeds or eggs, the young or old, differ from one another and from  those of the parent-species;--from the cases in which new characters have  appeared at a particular period, and afterwards been inherited at the same  period;--and from what we know with respect to disease, we must believe in the  truth of the great principle of inheritance at corresponding periods of life.    SUMMARY OF THE THREE PRECEDING CHAPTERS.    Strong as is the force of inheritance, it allows the incessant appearance of  new characters. These, whether beneficial or injurious,--of the most trifling  importance, such as a shade of colour in a flower, a coloured lock of hair, or  a mere gesture,--or of the highest importance, as when affecting the brain, or  an organ so perfect and complex as the eye,--or of so grave a nature as to  deserve to be called a monstrosity,--or so peculiar as not to occur normally  in any member of the same natural class,--are often inherited by man, by the  lower animals, and plants. In numberless cases it suffices for the inheritance  of a peculiarity that one parent alone should be thus characterised.  Inequalities in the two sides of the body, though opposed to the law of  symmetry, may be transmitted. There is ample evidence that the effects of  mutilations and of accidents, especially or perhaps exclusively when followed  by disease, are occasionally inherited. There can be no doubt that the evil  effects of the long-continued exposure of the parent to injurious conditions  are sometimes transmitted to the offspring. So it is, as we shall see in a  future chapter, with the effects of the use and disuse of parts, and of mental  habits. Periodical habits are likewise transmitted, but generally, as it would  appear, with little force.    Hence we are led to look at inheritance as the rule, and non-inheritance as  the anomaly. But this power often appears to us in our ignorance to act  capriciously, transmitting a character with inexplicable strength or  feebleness. The very same peculiarity, as the weeping habit of trees, silky  feathers, etc., may be inherited either firmly or not at all by different  members of the same group, and even by different individuals of the same  species, though treated in the same manner. In this latter case we see that  the power of transmission is a quality which is merely individual in its  attachment. As with single characters, so it is with the several concurrent  slight differences which distinguish sub-varieties or races; for of these,  some can be propagated almost as truly as species, whilst others cannot be  relied on. The same rule holds good with plants, when propagated by bulbs,  offsets, etc., which in one sense still form parts of the same individual, for  some varieties retain or inherit through successive bud-generations their  character far more truly than others.    Some characters not proper to the parent-species have certainly been inherited  from an extremely remote epoch, and may therefore be considered as firmly  fixed. But it is doubtful whether length of inheritance in itself gives  fixedness of character; though the chances are obviously in favour of any  character which has long been transmitted true or unaltered still being  transmitted true as long as the conditions of life remain the same. We know  that many species, after having retained the same character for countless  ages, whilst living under their natural conditions, when domesticated have  varied in the most diversified manner, that is, have failed to transmit their  original form; so that no character appears to be absolutely fixed. We can  sometimes account for the failure of inheritance by the conditions of life  being opposed to the development of certain characters; and still oftener, as  with plants cultivated by grafts and buds, by the conditions causing new and  slight modifications incessantly to appear. In this latter case it is not that  inheritance wholly fails, but that new characters are continually superadded.  In some few cases, in which both parents are similarly characterised,  inheritance seems to gain so much force by the combined action of the two  parents, that it counteracts its own power, and a new modification is the  result.    In many cases the failure of the parents to transmit their likeness is due to  the breed having been at some former period crossed; and the child takes after  his grandparent or more remote ancestor of foreign blood. In other cases, in  which the breed has not been crossed, but some ancient character has been lost  through variation, it occasionally reappears through reversion, so that the  parents apparently fail to transmit their own likeness. In all cases, however,  we may safely conclude that the child inherits all its characters from its  parents, in whom certain characters are latent, like the secondary sexual  characters of one sex in the other. When, after a long succession of bud-  generations, a flower or fruit becomes separated into distinct segments,  having the colours or other attributes of both parent-forms, we cannot doubt  that these characters were latent in the earlier buds, though they could not  then be detected, or could be detected only in an intimately commingled state.  So it is with animals of crossed parentage, which with advancing years  occasionally exhibit characters derived from one of their two parents, of  which not a trace could at first be perceived. Certain monstrosities, which  resemble what naturalists call the typical form of the group in question,  apparently come under the same law of reversion. It is assuredly an  astonishing fact that the male and female sexual elements, that buds, and even  full-grown animals, should retain characters, during several generations in  the case of crossed breeds, and during thousands of generations in the case of  pure breeds, written as it were in invisible ink, yet ready at any time to be  evolved under certain conditions.    What these conditions precisely are, we do not know. But any cause which  disturbs the organisation or constitution seems to be sufficient. A cross  certainly gives a strong tendency to the reappearance of long-lost characters,  both corporeal and mental. In the case of plants, this tendency is much  stronger with those species which have been crossed after long cultivation and  which therefore have had their constitutions disturbed by this cause as well  as by crossing, than with species which have always lived under their natural  conditions and have then been crossed. A return, also, of domesticated animals  and cultivated plants to a wild state favours reversion; but the tendency  under these circumstances has been much exaggerated.    When individuals of the same family which differ somewhat, and when races or  species are crossed, the one is often prepotent over the other in transmitting  its character.

Vega is one of those stars which evidently are not only enormously  larger than the sun (one estimate makes the ratio in this case nine  hundred to one), but whose physical condition, as far as the  spectroscope reveals it, is very different from that of our ruling orb.  Like Sirius, Vega displays the lines of hydrogen most conspicuously, and  it is probably a much hotter as well as a much more voluminous body  than the sun.    Close by, toward the east, two fourth-magnitude stars form a little  triangle with Vega. Both are interesting objects for the telescope, and  the northern one, epsilon, has few rivals in this respect. Let us first  look at it with an opera glass. The slight magnifying power of such an  instrument divides the star into two twinkling points. They are about  two and a quarter minutes of arc apart, and exceptionally sharp-sighted  persons are able to see them divided with the naked eye. Now take the  three-inch telescope and look at them, with a moderate power. Each of  the two stars revealed by the opera glass appears double, and a fifth  star of the ninth magnitude is seen on one side of an imaginary line  joining the two pairs. The northern-most pair is named epsilon_1, the  magnitudes being fifth and sixth, distance 3\", p. 15 deg.. The other pair is  epsilon_2, magnitudes fifth and sixth, distance 2.3\", p. 133 deg.. Each pair  is apparently a binary; but the period of revolution is unknown. Some  have guessed a thousand years for one pair, and two thousand for the  other. Another guess gives epsilon_1 a period of one thousand years, and  epsilon_2 a period of eight hundred years. Hall, in his double-star  observations, simply says of each, \"A slow motion.\"    Purely by guesswork a period has also been assigned to the two pairs in  a supposed revolution around their common center, the time named being  about a million years. It is not known, however, that such a motion  exists. Manifestly it could not be ascertained within the brief period  during which scientific observations of these stars have been made. The  importance of the element of time in the study of stellar motions is  frequently overlooked, though not, of course, by those who are engaged  in such work. The sun, for instance, and many of the stars are known  to be moving in what appear to be straight lines in space, but  observations extending over thousands of years would probably show that  these motions are in curved paths, and perhaps in closed orbits.    If now in turn we take our four-inch glass, we shall see something else  in this strange family group of epsilon Lyrae. Between epsilon_1 and  epsilon_2, and placed one on each side of the joining line, appear two  exceedingly faint specks of light, which Sir John Herschel made famous  under the name of the _debillissima_. They are of the twelfth or  thirteenth magnitude, and possibly variable to a slight degree. If you  can not see them at first, turn your eye toward one side of the field of  view, and thus, by bringing their images upon a more sensitive part of  the retina, you may glimpse them. The sight is not much, yet it will  repay you, as every glance into the depths of the universe does.    The other fourth-magnitude star near Vega is zeta, a wide double,  magnitudes fourth and sixth, distance 44\", p. 150 deg.. Below we find beta,  another very interesting star, since it is both a multiple and an  eccentric variable. It has four companions, three of which we can easily  see with our three-inch; the fourth calls for the five-inch; the  magnitudes are respectively four, seven or under, eight, eight and a  half, and eleven; distances 45\", p. 150 deg.; 65\", p. 320 deg.; 85\", p. 20 deg.; and  46\", p. 248 deg.. The primary, beta, varies from about magnitude three and a  half to magnitude four and a half, the period being twelve days,  twenty-one hours, forty-six minutes, and fifty-eight seconds. Two  unequal maxima and minima occur within this period. In the spectrum of  this star some of the hydrogen lines and the D_3 line (the latter  representing helium, a constituent of the sun and of some of the stars,  which, until its recent discovery in a few rare minerals was not known  to exist on the earth) are bright, but they vary in visibility.  Moreover, dark lines due to hydrogen also appear in its spectrum  simultaneously with the bright lines of that element. Then, too, the  bright lines are sometimes seen double. Professor Pickering's  explanation is that beta Lyrae probably consists of two stars, which,  like the two composing beta Aurigae, are too close to be separated with  any telescope now existing, and that the body which gives the bright  lines is revolving in a circle in a period of about twelve days and  twenty-two hours around the body which gives the dark lines. He has also  suggested that the appearances could be accounted for by supposing a  body like our sun to be rotating in twelve days and twenty-two hours,  and having attached to it an enormous protuberance extending over more  than one hundred and eighty degrees of longitude, so that when one end  of it was approaching us with the rotation of the star the other end  would be receding, and a splitting of the spectral lines at certain  periods would be the consequence. \"The variation in light,\" he adds,  \"may be caused by the visibility of a larger or smaller portion of this  protuberance.\"    Unfortunate star, doomed to carry its parasitical burden of hydrogen and  helium, like Sindbad in the clasp of the Old Man of the Sea! Surely, the  human imagination is never so wonderful as when it bears an astronomer  on its wings. Yet it must be admitted that the facts in this case are  well calculated to summon the genius of hypothesis. And the puzzle is  hardly simplified by Belopolsky's observation that the body in beta Lyrae  giving dark hydrogen lines shows those lines also split at certain  times. It has been calculated, from a study of the phenomena noted  above, that the bright-line star in beta Lyrae is situated at a distance  of about fifteen million miles from the center of gravity of the  curiously complicated system of which it forms a part.    We have not yet exhausted the wonders of Lyra. On a line from beta to  gamma, and about one third of the distance from the former to the  latter, is the celebrated Ring Nebula, indicated on the map by the  number 4447. We need all the light we can get to see this object well,  and so, although the three-inch will show it, we shall use the  five-inch. Beginning with a power of one hundred diameters, which  exhibits it as a minute elliptical ring, rather misty, very soft and  delicate, and yet distinct, we increase the magnification first to two  hundred and finally to three hundred, in order to distinguish a little  better some of the details of its shape. Upon the whole, however, we  find that the lowest power that clearly brings out the ring gives the  most satisfactory view. The circumference of the ring is greater than  that of the planet Jupiter. Its ellipticity is conspicuous, the length  of the longer axis being 78\" and that of the shorter 60\". Closely  following the nebula as it moves through the field of view, our  five-inch telescope reveals a faint star of the eleventh or twelfth  magnitude, which is suspected of variability. The largest instruments,  like the Washington and the Lick glasses, have shown perhaps a dozen  other stars apparently connected with the nebula. A beautiful sparkling  effect which the nebula presents was once thought to be an indication  that it was really composed of a circle of stars, but the spectroscope  shows that its constitution is gaseous. Just in the middle of the open  ring is a feeble star, a mere spark in the most powerful telescope. But  when the Ring Nebula is photographed--and this is seen beautifully in  the photographs made with the Crossley reflector on Mount Hamilton by  the late Prof. J. E. Keeler--this excessively faint star imprints its  image boldly as a large bright blur, encircled by the nebulous ring,  which itself appears to consist of a series of intertwisted spirals.    Not far away we find a difficult double star, 17, whose components are  of magnitudes six and ten or eleven, distance 3.7\", p. 325 deg..    From Lyra we pass to Cygnus, which, lying in one of the richest parts of  the Milky Way, is a very interesting constellation for the possessor of  a telescope. Its general outlines are plainly marked for the naked eye  by the figure of a cross more than twenty degrees in length lying along  the axis of the Milky Way. The foot of the cross is indicated by the  star beta, also known as Albireo, one of the most charming of all the  double stars. The three-inch amply suffices to reveal the beauty of this  object, whose components present as sharp a contrast of light yellow and  deep blue as it would be possible to produce artificially with the  purest pigments. The magnitudes are three and seven, distance 34.6\", p.  55 deg.. No motion has been detected indicating that these stars are  connected in orbital revolution, yet no one can look at them without  feeling that they are intimately related to one another. It is a sight  to which one returns again and again, always with undiminished pleasure.  The most inexperienced observer admires its beauty, and after an hour  spent with doubtful results in trying to interest a tyro in double stars  it is always with a sense of assured success that one turns the  telescope to beta Cygni.    Following up the beam of the imaginary cross along the current of the  Milky Way, every square degree of which is here worth long gazing into,  we come to a pair of stars which contend for the name-letter chi. On our  map the letter is attached to the southernmost of the two, a variable of  long period--four hundred and six days--whose changes of brilliance lie  "]]]
