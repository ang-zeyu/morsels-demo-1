Thor strode to the cat, determined to lift her up and fling her amongst  the mocking Giants. He put his hands to the cat, but he could not raise  her. Up, up went Thor's arms, up, up, as high as they could go. The  cat's arched back went up to the roof, but her feet were never taken off  the ground. And as he heaved and heaved with all his might he heard the  laughter of the Giants all round him.    He turned away, his eyes flaming with anger. \"I am not wont to try to  lift cats,\" he said. \"Bring me one to wrestle with, and I swear you  shall see me overthrow him.\"    \"Here is one for you to wrestle with, Asa Thor,\" said the King. Thor  looked round and saw an old woman hobbling toward him. She was  blear-eyed and toothless. \"This is Ellie, my ancient nurse,\" said the  Giant King. \"She is the one we would have you wrestle with.\"    \"Thor does not wrestle with old women. I will lay my hands on your  tallest Giants instead.\"    \"Ellie has come where you are,\" said the Giant King. \"Now it is she who  will lay hands upon you.\"    The old woman hobbled toward Thor, her eyes gleaming under her falling  fringes of gray hair. Thor stood, unable to move as the hag came toward  him. She laid her hands upon his arms. Her feet began to trip at his. He  tried to cast her from him. Then he found that her feet and her hands  were as strong against his as bands and stakes of iron.    Then began a wrestling match in earnest between Thor and the ancient  crone Ellie. Round and round the hall they wrestled, and Thor was not  able to bend the old woman backward nor sideways. Instead he became  less and less able under her terrible grasp. She forced him down, down,  and at last he could only save himself from being left prone on the  ground by throwing himself down on one knee and holding the hag by the  shoulders. She tried to force him down on the ground, but she could not  do that. Then she broke from him, hobbled to the door and went out of  the hall.    Thor rose up and took the hammer from Loki's hands. Without a word he  went out of the hall and along the ways and toward the gate of the  Giants' City. He spoke no word to Loki nor to the lad Thialfi who went  with him for the seven weeks that they journeyed through Joetunheim.          [Illustration]    HOW THOR AND LOKI BEFOOLED THRYM THE GIANT      Loki told another tale about Thor--about Thor and Thrym, a stupid Giant  who had cunning streaks in him. Loki and Thor had been in this Giant's  house. He had made a feast for them and Thor had been unwatchful.    Then when they were far from Joetunheim Thor missed Mioelnir, missed the  hammer that was the defence of Asgard and the help of the Gods. He could  not remember how or where he had mislaid it. Loki's thoughts went toward  Thrym, that stupid Giant who yet had cunning streaks in him. Thor, who  had lost the hammer that he had sworn never to let out of his sight, did  not know what to do.    But Loki thought it would be worth while to see if Thrym knew anything  about it. He went first to Asgard. He hurried across the Rainbow Bridge  and passed Heimdall without speaking to him. To none of the Dwellers in  Asgard whom he met did he dare relate the tidings of Thor's loss. He  spoke to none until he came to Frigga's palace.    To Frigga he said, \"You must lend me your falcon dress until I fly to  Thrym's dwelling and find out if he knows where Mioelnir is.\"    \"If every feather was silver I would give it to you to go on such an  errand,\" Frigga said.    So Loki put on the falcon dress and flew to Joetunheim and came near  Thrym's dwelling. He found the Giant upon a hillside putting golden and  silver collars upon the necks of his hounds. Loki in the plumage of a  falcon perched on the rock above him, watching the Giant with falcon  eyes.    And while he was there he heard the Giant speak boastful words. \"I put  collars of silver and gold on you now, my hounds,\" said he, \"but soon we  Giants will have the gold of Asgard to deck our hounds and our steeds,  yea, even the necklace of Freya to put upon you, the best of my hounds.  For Mioelnir, the defence of Asgard, is in Thrym's holding.\"    Then Loki spoke to him. \"Yea, we know that Mioelnir is in thy possession,  O Thrym,\" said he, \"but know thou that the eyes of the watchful Gods are  upon thee.\"    \"Ha, Loki, Shape-changer,\" said Thrym, \"you are there! But all your  watching will not help you to find Mioelnir. I have buried Thor's hammer  eight miles deep in the earth. Find it if you can. It is below the caves  of the Dwarfs.\"    \"It is useless for us to search for Thor's hammer,\" said Loki; \"eh  Thrym?\"    \"It is useless for you to search for it,\" said the Giant sulkily.    \"But what a recompense you would gain if you restored Thor's hammer to  the Dwellers in Asgard,\" Loki said.    \"No, cunning Loki, I will never restore it, not for any recompense,\"  said Thrym.    \"Yet bethink thee, Thrym,\" said Loki. \"Is there nought in Asgard you  would like to own? No treasure, no possession? Odin's ring or Frey's  ship, Skidbladnir?\"    \"No, no,\" said Thrym. \"Only one thing could the Dwellers in Asgard offer  me that I would take in exchange for Mioelnir, Thor's hammer.\"    \"And what would that be, Thrym?\" said Loki, flying toward him.    \"She whom many Giants have striven to gain--Freya, for my wife,\" said  Thrym.    Loki watched Thrym for long with his falcon eyes. He saw that the Giant  would not alter his demand. \"I will tell the Dwellers in Asgard of your  demand,\" he said at last, and he flew away.    Loki knew that the Dwellers in Asgard would never let Freya be taken  from them to become the wife of Thrym, the stupidest of the Giants. He  flew back.    By this time all the Dwellers in Asgard had heard of the loss of  Mioelnir, the help of the Gods. Heimdall shouted to him as he crossed the  Rainbow Bridge to ask what tidings he brought back. But Loki did not  stop to speak to the Warden of the Bridge but went straight to the hall  where the Gods sat in Council.    To the AEsir and the Vanir he told Thrym's demand. None would agree to  let the beautiful Freya go live in Joetunheim as a wife to the stupidest  of the Giants. All in the Council were cast down. The Gods would never  again be able to help mortal men, for now that Mioelnir was in the  Giants' hands all their strength would have to be used in the defence of  Asgard.    So they sat in the Council with looks downcast. But cunning Loki said,  \"I have thought of a trick that may win back the hammer from stupid  Thrym. Let us pretend to send Freya to Joetunheim as a bride for him. But  let one of the Gods go in Freya's veil and dress.\"    \"Which of the Gods would bring himself to do so shameful a thing?\" said  those in the Council.    \"Oh, he who lost the hammer, Thor, should be prepared to do as much to  win it back,\" said Loki.    \"Thor, Thor! Let Thor win back the hammer from Thrym by Loki's trick,\"  said the AEsir and the Vanir. They left it to Loki to arrange how Thor  should go to Joetunheim as a bride for Thrym.    Loki left the Council of the Gods and came to where he had left Thor.  \"There is but one way to win the hammer back, Thor,\" he said, \"and the  Gods in Council have decreed that you shall take it.\"    \"What is the way?\" said Thor. \"But no matter what it is, tell me of it  and I shall do as thou dost say.\"    \"Then,\" said laughing Loki, \"I am to take you to Joetunheim as a bride  for Thrym. Thou art to go in bridal dress and veil, in Freya's veil and  bridal dress.\"    \"What! I dress in woman's garb?\" shouted Thor.    \"Yea, Thor, and wear a veil over your head and a garland of flowers upon  it.\"    \"I--I wear a garland of flowers?\"    \"And rings upon thy fingers. And a bunch of housekeeper's keys in thy  girdle.\"    \"Cease thy mockery, Loki,\" said Thor roughly, \"or I shall shake thee.\"    \"It is no mockery. Thou wilt have to do this to win Mioelnir back for the  defence of Asgard. Thrym will take no other recompense than Freya. I  would mock him by bringing thee to him in Freya's veil and dress. When  thou art in his hall and he asks thee to join hands with him, say thou  wilt not until he puts Mioelnir into thy hands. Then when thy mighty  hammer is in thy holding thou canst deal with him and with all in his  hall. And I shall be with thee as thy bridesmaid! O sweet, sweet maiden  Thor!\"    \"Loki,\" said Thor, \"thou didst devise all this to mock me. I in a bridal  dress! I with a bride's veil upon me! The Dwellers in Asgard will never  cease to laugh at me.\"    \"Yea,\" said Loki, \"but there will never be laughter again in Asgard  unless thou art able to bring back the hammer that thine unwatchfulness  lost.\"    \"True,\" said Thor unhappily, \"and is this, thinkst thou, Loki, the only  way to win back Mioelnir from Thrym?\"    \"It is the only way, O Thor,\" said the cunning Loki.    So Thor and Loki set out for Joetunheim and the dwelling of Thrym. A  messenger had gone before them to tell Thrym that Freya was coming with  her bridesmaid; that the wedding-feast was to be prepared and the guests  gathered and that Mioelnir was to be at hand so that it might be given  over to the Dwellers in Asgard. Thrym and his Giant mother hastened to  have everything in readiness.    Thor and Loki came to the Giant's house in the dress of a bride and a  bridesmaid. A veil was over Thor's head hiding his beard and his fierce  eyes. A red-embroidered robe he wore and at his side hung a girdle of  housekeeper's keys. Loki was veiled, too. The hall of Thrym's great  house was swept and garnished and great tables were laid for the feast.  And Thrym's mother was going"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24750"],[0,"Mizora: A Prophecy (#16)"],[1,"ciples. It was derogatory to one's character to seek  office.\"    \"Was dishonesty more prominent in one party than another?\" I asked,  thinking how very Americanish this history sounded.    \"We, who look back upon the conditions of those times and view it with  dispassionate judgment, can perceive corruption in both political  parties. The real welfare of the country was the last thing considered  by a professional politician. There was always something that was to  benefit the people brought forward as a party issue, and used as a means  of working up the enthusiasm or fears of the people, and usually dropped  after the election.    \"The candidate for election in those days might be guilty of heinous  crimes, yet the party covered them all, and over that covering the  partisan newspaper spread every virtue in the calendar. A stranger to  the country and its customs reading one of their partisan newspapers  during a political campaign, might conclude that the party _it_  advocated was composed of only the virtues of the country, and their  leader an epitome of the supremest excellence.    \"Reading in the same paper a description of the opposing party, the  stranger might think it composed of only the degraded and disreputable  portion of the nation, and its leader the scum of all its depravity. If  curiosity should induce a perusal of some partisan paper of the other  party, the same thing could be read in its columns, with a change of  names. It would be the opposite party that was getting represented in  the most despicable character, and _their_ leader was the only one who  possessed enough honesty and talent to keep the country from going to  wreck. The other party leader was the one who was guilty of all the  crimes in the calendar. A vast number of people were ignorant enough to  cling blindly to one party and to believe every word published by its  partisan papers. This superstitious party faith was what the  unscrupulous politicians handled dexterously for their own selfish ends.  It was not until education became universal, and a higher culture was  forced upon the majority--the working classes--that politics began to  purify itself, and put on the dignity of real virtue, and receive the  respect that belongs to genuine justice.    \"The people became disgusted with defamatory political literature, and  the honorable members of both parties abjured it altogether. In such a  government as this, two great parties could not exist, where one was  altogether bad and the other altogether good. It became apparent to the  people that there was good in both parties, and they began to elect it  irrespective of party prejudice. Politicians began to work for their  country instead of themselves and their party, and politics took the  noble position that the rights of humanity designed it for. I have been  giving you quite a history of our ancient politics. Our present  condition is far different. As the people became enlightened to a higher  degree, the government became more compact. It might now be compared to  a large family. There are one hundred States in the Union. There was a  time when every State made its own laws for its own domestic government.  One code of laws is now enforced in every State. In going from one State  to another citizens now suffer no inconvenience from a confusion of  laws. Every State owes allegiance to the General Government. No State or  number of States could set up an independent government without  obtaining the consent and legal dissolution from the General Government.  But such a thing will never be thought of. We have prospered as a great  united Nation. Our union has been our strength, our prosperity.\"    I visited with Wauna a number of the States' Capitals. In architecture  the Mizora people display an excellent taste. Their public buildings  might all be called works of art. Their government buildings,  especially, were on a scale of magnificent splendor. The hollow square  seemed to be a favorite form. One very beautiful capitol building was of  crystal glass, with facing and cornices of marble onyx. It looked more  like a gigantic gem than anything I could compare it to, especially when  lighted up by great globes of white fire suspended from every ceiling.    Upon my entrance into Mizora, I was led into the belief that I had  arrived at a female seminary, because the dining and sleeping  accommodations for the stateswoman were all in the Capitol building. I  observed that the State Capitols were similarly accommodated. In Mizora  the home is the heart of all joy, and wherever a Mizora woman goes, she  endeavors to surround herself with its comforts and pleasures. That was  the reason that the splendid Capitol building had its home-like  appointments, was a Nation of women exclusively--at least as far as I  had as yet been able to discover.    Another reason for the homes of all officials of the Government being  within the public buildings, was because all the personal expenses,  excepting clothing, were paid by the Government. The salaries of  Government positions were not large, compared with those of the  sciences; but as their social and political dues were paid out of the  public treasury, the salaries might be considered as net profit. This  custom had originated many centuries in the past. In those early days,  when a penurious character became an incumbent of public office, the  social obligations belonging to it were often but niggardly requited.  Sometimes business embarrassments and real necessity demanded economy;  so, at last, the Government assumed all the expenses contingent upon  every office, from the highest to the lowest. By this means the occupant  of a Government office was freed from every care but those of state.    The number and style of all social entertainments that were obligatory  of the occupant of a public office, were regulated by law. As the people  of Mizora believed in enjoyment, the entertainments provided by the  Government as the necessary social dues of its officers, were not few,  nor scantily furnished.          CHAPTER XII.      The artificial light in Mizora puzzled me longest to understand. When I  first noticed it, it appeared to me to have no apparent source. At the  touch of a delicate hand, it blazed forth like a star in the center of  the ceiling. It diffused a soft and pleasing brilliancy that lent a  charm to everything it revealed. It was a dreamy daylight, and was  produced by electricity.    In large halls, like a theatre or opera house, the light fell in a soft  and penetrating radiance from the center of the dome. Its source was not  visible to either audience or actresses, and, in consequence, occasioned  no discomfort to the eyes. The light that illuminated the stage was  similarly arranged. The footlights were not visible. They were in the  rear of the stage. The light came upward like the rays of the setting  sun, revealing the setting of the stage with vivid distinctness. I can  best describe the effect of this singular arrangement by calling  attention to the appearance of the sun when declining behind a small  elevation. How sharply every object is outlined before it? How soft and  delicate is the light in which everything is bathed? Every cloud that  floats has all of its fleecy loveliness limned with a radiant clearness.    I was very desirous to know how this singular effect was produced, and  at my request was taken to the stage. An opening in the back part of it  was covered with pink colored glass. Powerful electric lights from below  the stage were reflected through this glass upon it. The glass was  highly refractive and so perfectly translucent, I at first thought there  was none there, and when I stood upon its edge, and looked down into a  fiery gulf below, I instinctively thought of the \"Lost People,\" who are  said to wander amid torturing yet unconsumable flames. But, happily, the  ones I gazed upon were harmless ones.    The street lights of Mizora were at a considerable elevation from the  ground. They were in, or over, the center of the street, and of such  diffuse brilliancy as to render the city almost as light as day. They  were in the form of immense globes of soft, white fire, and during the  six months that answered to the Mizora night, were kept constantly  burning. It was during this period that the Aurora Borealis shone with  such marvelous brilliancy.    Generally, its display was heralded by an arc of delicate green-tinted  light, that spanned the heavens. The green tint deepened into emerald,  assuming a delicate rose hue as it faded upward into rays that diverged  from the top until the whole resembled a gigantic crown. Every ray  became a panorama of gorgeous colors, resembling tiny sparks, moving  hither and thither with inconceivable swiftness. Sometimes a veil of  mist of delicate green hue depended from the base of the crown, and  swayed gently back and forth. As soon as the swaying motion commenced,  the most gorgeous colors were revealed. Myriads of sparks, no larger  than snow-flakes, swarmed across the delicate green curtain in every  conceivable color and shade, but always of that vapory, vivid softness  that is indescribable. The dancing colors resembled gems encased in a  film of mist.    One display that I witnessed I shall attempt to describe. The arc of  delicate green appeared first, and shot upward diverging rays of all the  warm, rich hues of red. They formed a vast crown, outlined with a  delicate halo of fire. A veil of misty green fluttered down from its  base, and, instantly, tiny crowns, composed of every brilliant color,  with a tracery of fire defining every separate one, began to chase one  another back and forth with bewildering rapidity. As the veil swayed to  and fro, it seemed to shake the crowns into skeins of fire, each thread  strung with countless minute globes of every conceivable color and hue.  Those fiery threads, aerial as thistle down,"]]]
