As the secretion from the pancreas resembles  saliva in its general appearance, and probably in its office of assisting  digestion, by preventing the fermentation of the aliment; as would appear  by the experiments of Pringle and Macbride; there is reason to suspect,  that a sympathy may exist between the salivary and pancreatic glands; and  that the perpetual stimulus of the former by tobacco might in process of  time injure the latter. See Tobacco, Article III. 2. 2.    8. _Torpor renis._ Inirritability or paralysis of the kidnies is probably  frequently mistaken for gravel in them. Several, who have lived rather  intemperately in respect to fermented or spirituous liquors, become  suddenly seized about the age of sixty, or later, with a total stoppage of  urine; though they have previously had no symptoms of gravel. In these  cases there is no water in the bladder; as is known by the introduction of  the catheter, of which those made of elastic gum are said to be preferable  to metallic ones; or it may generally be known by the shape of the abdomen,  either by the eye or hand. Bougies and catheters of elastic gum are sold at  N^o 37, Red Lion-street, Holborn, London.    M. M. Electric shocks, warm bath. Emetics. See calculus renis, Class I. 1.  3. 9. When no gravel has been previously observed, and the patient has been  a wine-drinker rather than an ale-drinker, the case is generally owing to  inirritability of the tubuli uriniferi, and is frequently fatal. See Class  I. 2. 4. 20.    9. _Punctae mucosae vultus._ Mucous spots on the face. These are owing to  the inactivity of the excretory ducts of the mucous glands; the thinner  part of this secretion exhales, and the remainder becomes inspissated, and  lodges in the duct; the extremity of which becomes black by exposure to the  air.    M. M. They may be pressed out by the finger-nails. Warm water. Ether  frequently applied. Blister on the part?    10. _Maculae cutis fulvae._ Morphew or freckles. Tawny blotches on the skin  of the face and arms of elderly people, and frequently on their legs after  slight erysipelas. The freckles on the face of younger people, who have red  hair, seem to be a similar production, and seem all to be caused by the  coalescence of the minute arteries or capillaries of the part. In a scar  after a wound the integument is only opake; but in these blotches, which  are called morphew and freckles, the small vessels seem to have become  inactive with some of the serum of the blood stagnating in them, from  whence their colour. See Class III. 1. 2. 12.    M. M. Warm bathing. A blister on the part?    11. _Canities._ Grey hair. In the injection of the vessels of animals for  the purposes of anatomical preparations, the colour of the injected fluid  will not pass into many very minute vessels; which nevertheless uncoloured  water, or spirits, or quicksilver will permeate. The same occurs in the  filtration of some coloured fluids through paper, or very fine sand, where  the colouring matter is not perfectly dissolved, but only diffused through  the liquid. This has led some to imagine, that the cause of the whiteness  of the hair in elderly people may arise from the diminution, or greater  tenuity, of the glandular vessels, which secrete the mucus, which hardens  into hair; and that the same difference of the tenuity of the secerning  vessels may possibly make the difference of colour of the silk from  different silk-worms, which is of all shades from yellow to white.    But as the secreted fluids are not the consequence of mechanical  filtration, but of animal selection; we must look out for another cause,  which must be found in the decreasing activity of the glands, as we advance  in life; and which affects many of our other secretions as well as that of  the mucus, which forms the hair. Hence grey hairs are produced on the faces  of horses by whatever injures the glands at their roots, as by corrosive  blisters; and frequently on the human subject by external injuries on the  head; and sometimes by fevers. And as the grey colour of hair consists in  its want of transparency, like water converted into snow; there is reason  to suppose, that a defect of secreted moisture simply may be the cause of  this kind of opacity, as explained in Cataracta, Class I. 2. 2. 13.    M. M. Whatever prevents the inirritability and insensibility of the system,  that is, whatever prevents the approach of old age, will so far counteract  the production of grey hairs, which is a symptom of it. For this purpose in  people, who are not corpulent, and perhaps in those who are so, the warm  bath twice or thrice a week is particularly serviceable. See Sect. XXXIX.  5. 1. on the colours of animals, and Class I. 1. 2. 15.    12. _Callus._ The callous skin on the hands and feet of laborious people is  owing to the extreme vessels coalescing from the perpetual pressure they  are exposed to.    As we advance in life, the finer arteries lose their power of action, and  their sides grow together; hence the paleness of the skins of elderly  people, and the loss of that bloom, which is owing to the numerous fine  arteries, and the transparency of the skin, that encloses them.    M. M. Warm bath. Paring the thick skin with a knife. Smoothing it with a  pumice stone. Cover the part with oiled silk to prevent the evaporation of  the perspirable matter, and thus to keep it moist.    13. _Cataracta_ is an opacity of the crystalline lens of the eye. It is a  disease of light-coloured eyes, as the gutta serena is of dark ones. On  cutting off with scissars the cornea of a calf's eye, and holding it in the  palm of one's hand, so as to gain a proper light, the artery, which  supplies nutriment to the crystalline humour, is easily and beautifully  seen; as it rises from the centre of the optic nerve through the vitreous  humour to the crystalline. It is this point, where the artery enters the  eye through the cineritious part of the optic nerve, (which is in part near  the middle of the nerve,) which is without sensibility to light; as is  shewn by fixing three papers, each of them about half an inch in diameter,  against a wall about a foot distant from each other, about the height of  the eye; and then looking at the middle one, with one eye, and retreating  till you lose sight of one of the external papers. Now as the animal grows  older, the artery becomes less visible, and perhaps carries only a  transparent fluid, and at length in some subjects I suppose ceases to be  pervious; then it follows, that the crystalline lens, losing some fluid,  and gaining none, becomes dry, and in consequence opake; for the same  reason, that wet or oiled paper is more transparent than when it is dry, as  explained in Class I. 1. 4. 1. The want of moisture in the cornea of old  people, when the exhalation becomes greater than the supply, is the cause  of its want of transparency; and which like the crystalline gains rather a  milky opacity. The same analogy may be used to explain the whiteness of the  hair of old people, which loses its pellucidity along with its moisture.  See Class I. 2. 2. 11.    M. M. Small electric shocks through the eye. A quarter of a grain of  corrosive sublimate of mercury dissolved in brandy, or taken in a pill,  twice a day for six weeks. Couching by depression, or by extraction. The  former of these operations is much to be preferred to the latter, though  the latter is at this time so fashionable, that a surgeon is almost  compelled to use it, lest he should not be thought an expert operator. For  depressing the cataract is attended with no pain, no danger, no  confinement, and may be as readily repeated, if the crystalline should rise  again to the centre of the eye. The extraction of the cataract is attended  with considerable pain, with long confinement, generally with fever, always  with inflammation, and frequently with irreparable injury to the iris, and  consequent danger to the whole eye. Yet has this operation of extraction  been trumpeted into universal fashion for no other reason but because it is  difficult to perform, and therefore keeps the business in the hands of a  few empyrics, who receive larger rewards, regardless of the hazard, which  is encountered by the flattered patient.    A friend of mine returned yesterday from London after an absence of many  weeks; he had a cataract in a proper state for the operation, and in spite  of my earnest exhortation to the contrary, was prevailed upon to have it  extracted rather than depressed. He was confined to his bed three weeks  after the operation, and is now returned with the iris adhering on one side  so as to make an oblong aperture; and which is nearly, if not totally,  without contraction, and thus greatly impedes the little vision, which he  possesses. Whereas I saw some patients couched by depression many years ago  by a then celebrated empyric, Chevalier Taylor, who were not confined above  a day or two, that the eye might gradually be accustomed to light, and who  saw as well as by extraction, perhaps better, without either pain, or  inflammation, or any hazard of losing the eye.    As the inflammation of the iris is probably owing to forcing the  crystalline through the aperture of it in the operation of extracting it,  could it not be done more safely by making the opening behind the iris and  ciliary process into the vitreous humour? but the operation would still be  more painful, more dangerous, and not more useful than that by depressing  it.    14. _Innutritio ossium._ Innutrition of the bones. Not only the blood  effused in vibices and petechiae, or from bruises, as well as the blood and  new vessels in inflamed parts, are reabsorbed by the increased action of  the lymphatics; but the harder materials, which constitute the fangs of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27638"],[0,"The 2001 CIA World Factbook (#16)"],[1," with HIV/AIDS: NA    HIV/AIDS - deaths: NA    Nationality: noun:  Andorran(s)    adjective:  Andorran    Ethnic groups: Spanish 43%, Andorran 33%, Portuguese 11%, French 7%,  other 6% (1998)    Religions: Roman Catholic (predominant)    Languages: Catalan (official), French, Castilian    Literacy: definition:  NA    total population:  100%    male:  NA%    female:  NA%        Andorra    Government    Country name: conventional long form:  Principality of Andorra    conventional short form:  Andorra    local long form:  Principat d'Andorra    local short form:  Andorra    Government type: parliamentary democracy (since March 1993) that  retains as its heads of state a coprincipality;

An estimated 9  million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free  status and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative  advantage has recently eroded as the economies of neighboring France  and Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of  goods and lower tariffs. The banking sector, with its \"tax haven\"  status, also contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural  production is limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food  has to be imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep  raising. Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars,  and furniture. Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is  treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs)  and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.

A 1994 peace accord between the government  and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)  provided for the integration of former UNITA insurgents into the  government and armed forces. A national unity government was  installed in April of 1997, but serious fighting resumed in late  1998, rendering hundreds of thousands of people homeless. Up to 1.5  million lives may have been lost in fighting over the past quarter  century.
